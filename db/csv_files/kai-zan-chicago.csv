Kai Zan
"Best Japanese in Chicago. Three tips for when you visit:1. Get the omakase. Kai Zan chefs know what you want more than you do. Trust me on this.2. Make a reservation. You will never get in without one. And be prepared to get up and leave after 90 minutes; they're strict here.3. If it's not on the omakase menu, do yourself a favor and add on an order of the escolar pearls.Prepare to have your mind blown!"
"Finally I got to try out this place for my birthday! Boy was it a treat!My suggestion is to ask what the chef's choice includes and if it floats your boat, go for it! That was exactly what I did. This way you are able to try out a little bit of everything on their menu. You won't regret the decision, I promise. There was so much food and it almost seemed endless. In addition to the tasting menu, we ordered the uni toro tartare and dessert in the end. One of my favorite dish of the night was the uni toro tartare! I love the DIY concept to this dish, and it almost seem endless. You just need to work for your food. Mix the tartare together really good and channel your inner sushi chef to make your own rolls. As much of a turn off the time limit is when you make the reservations, I did not feel at all pressured during the service. We did take a bit of time to make a decision, but our server was very patient with us. He walked us through the menu and elaborated on any questions I had along with making great suggestions. The pace was on point, however my ONLY critic is that from sitting at the bar and seeing how the kitchen flowed, what I noticed was the timing and preparation of the food. Some of the hot food was sitting there longer than I would have liked it because when I got my food expecting it to be hot, it was warm, if not almost cold. Of the hot food, only the soup and dynamite mussel were actually hot. Everything else minus the raw stuff were almost cold, which was a bit disappointing. The concept of clean and simple flavors is what I left with at this place. The tasting menu flowed from simple to variety and back to simple again. Nothing distracted your palette of the original flavors. As the tasting menu ends with a showcasing a selection of sashimi, I thought was genius because the menu took you on such an adventure, but made sure to remind you of the origin with the main ingredients of the night, fish. Just the concept of something as simple as fish can be created and paired with different things, but yet alone it can still be appreciated. To end this wonderful experience, we had a cup of green tea (FREE) and Cashew Panna Cotta. Not too sweet or heavy. Simple but yet so many textures and layers involved in just a little dessert. It was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday dinner! Cheers."
"Are you kidding me?? This place is magic! If you have not eaten here, please do yourself a favor and go NOW! I took my best friend for his birthday and we were blown away! I have had sushi and chefs tasting menus before, but this is by far THE best!! Great ambience and great service!! All I can say is Thank you Thank you Thank you!!! It's a great place for an intimate meal. Get the chefs choice menu and you can't go wrong."
"Best Omakase Ever! I don't know why I didn't listen to everyone else in Chicago and made the trek to Kai Zan sooner. Like seriously, I've been missing out!!! I could write a book on how amazing it is, but please listen to the masses and come here pronto! Let me say that they have converted me to an uni lover. I have never really been a fan of uni and now I know it's because I've never had truly awesome uni. I love sushi and I'll even tolerate subpar sushi but really this is out of this world amazingly fresh and creatively composed sushi!!! I had their omakase with some food loving friends and now I feel like I can never go back and not get the omakase. It's worth every cent and the chef even added an extra course with an off the menu item that still makes my mouth water when I think about it. Service was amazing. They kept checking on us and explained every course that came out in detail. I have nothing bad to say. This is my new favorite for sushi!!!"
"Eskimo Clouds and Escolar Pearls were nothing short of fantastic.Kai Zan is a great Japanese fusion restaurant, but their omakase really isn't omakase, but rolls, sashimi, and some other wraps put together by the chef for you to extensively sample the menu. So, call it a sampler and not omakase.Kai Zan is definitely a place you have to come at least twice, as the second time you'll know what you like and have different expectations of it. Its not a place for sushi snobs like you'll find in New York and LA, but rather a place to enjoy the food and presentation and a wonderful restaurant to introduce your non-sushi loving friends to the fabulous world of sashimi.There are a lot of things that Kai Zan does wrong, first and foremost how it built up the eating experience with textures and flavours. Kai Zan is far from a traditional sushi restaurant, but some facets of Japanese food isn't a rule of thumb just to be structured and exotic, but should apply to all multiple course meals regardless of style. Perhaps Kai Zan tried a little too hard to be different that it sacrificed the dining experience for the sake uniqueness. On the other hand, that's probably all I can say poorly about Kai Zan. The food in the ""omakase"" was nearly impeccable and among the best I've ever while in the Midwest. Our server was friendly and patient, and contributed to us having a great time. Kai Zan hit a ton of the right spots, and they definitely did not skimp on buying the best fish available.The escolar pearls are to die for, and out of all the Korean sushi places I've had it, Kai Zan's is by far the most innovative. The Eskimo Clouds seem like an embodiment of Chicago's unique brand of Japanese food.If you love sushi, come to Kai Zan with an open mind. If you want to treat it like Zo or Ichimura, you're going to be sorely dissapointed. This is not a place for diehard sushi lovers, but its a fantastic restaurant at a fantastic price. Kai Zan isn't my type of restaurant, and I didn't love it, but objectively, its as good as it gets in the Modern Asian Fusion category. Seriously though, Kai Zan needs to include some uni in their cheaper omakase. Just order everything off the menu on your second visit. Its not a real omakase, so you can probably do a better job yourself.Oyster Shooter: 3/5Red Snapper: 3/5Uni: 4/5Salmon: 4/5Tuna: 3/5Toro: 3/5Hamachi: 4/5Escolar: 5/5Blueberry pie shot: 1/5Presentation: 3/5Service: 4/5Diversity: 4/5Price: $$$$/$$$$Satisfaction:Price- 5/5"
"This is really, really good.  It's most similar to having an Uchi (Houston/Austin) smack dab in Chicago.  Chicagoland is sorely missing good sushi omakases, and Kai Zan fits the mark.  This is a fusion joint, but, and this is a big but, they pay a lot of attention to detail and source very high quality ingredients.  For example, last evening I had a sushi omakase with Mitsu-san himself at Sushi Yasuda in NYC, and I noticed Kai Zan was using some of the same exact ingredients (I could tell by the Japanese writing).I did the premium omakase with a few additional dishes thrown in to placate my inner sushi cravings:1) Seared salmon marinated in soy and mirin (4/5) - interesting, almost smoky flavor.  Very good ginger.  Pickled wasabi.- Note, a lot of their fish are fatty cuts, but often marinated.  That is fine with me, as I imagine they might not get fish from Tokyo every day, and sushi is meant to be marinated :)2) Raw wagyu beef with a touch of toro and caviar in a maitake mushroom sauce (4/5) - this was almost an amuse bouche, in that it was one bite, I thought it should have come before the salmon3) Pei wei served katsu style with sweet potato tempura (3/5) -- Pei wei (?) is a Brazilian fish, and it was fried with a curry flavor.  I'm not as big on fried dishes, so I knocked this a point, but many people would probably like it.  The black plate was a bit severe4) Chawanmushi with rice chip, radishes and caviar (5/5) -- loved this.  This is where I became very impressed.  Very good egg custard, and the crispy rice was an interesting garnishment, which was meant to be broken into the soup almost like an oyster cracker5) Wagyu beef seared with crisp greens (5/5) -- extremely strong.  They source their waygu from Japan and it was cooked perfectly.  This is reason enough for the premium omakase.  I'm still salivating6) Toro, lobster with uni, and hotate with truffle oil nigiri (4.5/5) -- I liked the nigiri course at this juncture, because they went with big flavors.  Almost everything was marinated except the uni.  The toro was delicious, and the hotate with truffle oil melted in my mouth - The rice was very good with nice flavor, although a touch cold for me (should be room temperature or a bit above).  They serve three pieces at a time, which isn't a crime, but doesn't necessarily shine (sorry for the rhyme)7) Ika plus asparagus (3/5) -- This was a little dry compared to some of the other luscious dishes, although the pairing had an interesting crunch which served as an effective contrast to the oily aspect of the previous course8) Hamachi kama (4/5) -- I added this, as I was craving a classic dish.  The hamachi kama was cooked perfectly and was very juicy.  There was a very good ponzu sauce and pickled cabbage.  I enjoyed the miso soup with which it came (heavy on the tofu and mushrooms)9) Marinated toro with pickled wasabi and sea salt (5/5) -- they go big on the toro here, and the pickled wasabi is a lot of fun.  if you're a fan of Hayakawa down in Atlanta, you'd appreciate it here, too10) Cold smoked marinated Hamachi with pickled wasabi and micro greens and caviar (4/5) -- another strong dish, and it reminded me a lot of Uchi due to the smoke effect  (think Jar Jar Duck of Uchi fame)11)  Sashimi plate - Hamachi belly, toro, madai served with pickled wasabi (5/5) -- loved this.  Perfect cuts.  All very delicious.  I found it surprising to be served sashimi  at the end, but the server made note of this that they like to mix it up, and since the flavors were so rich it held up nicely12) Cucumber, king crab, uni roll (5/5) -- the chef comped this for me, which I found very kind.  It was a refreshing dish, and the uni was so sweet which paired nicely with the crisp cucumber and delicious, succulent crab.  It was almost a palette cleanser13) Nigiri dessert course (3/5) - uni, tamago, unagi.  The uni was delicious.  Straight from Santa Barbara.  The tamago was not layered as tightly as I would have expected and the searing was too dramatic, which took away from the lightness of the egg.  The unagi was BBQ'd too aggressively.  They were out of anagoService here is 5/5.  Everyone is extremely pleasant and even jovial.  The chefs are not Japanese, but clearly have mastered many aspects of the craft and I did not notice any diminution of knife skills.  They are very talented.  The space is cool, although the sushi bar is not large so make sure you get your spot.  I have this place tied with Katsu in Chicagoland for sushi omakase.  Katsu, of course, is where to go for more tradition nigiri, albeit with gold leaf, and Kai Zan is where to go for a great time and a lot of different tastes"
"As I reflect on all the sushi I've had in Chicago...Kai Zan takes my #1 spot for sushi! The boyfriend and I went here for an anniversary dinner a couple years ago, and to this day it was one of our top 3 meals in Chicago. If you go here, you MUST do omakase (the chef selects your dishes for you). We opted for the 12-course menu which was about $60/person. Every one of our courses was fresh and scrumptious, but I'd say our favorite course was the oyster shooters (and I don't even like oysters, so that's saying something!). The ambiance is trendy and intimate, great for a dinner date or special occassion. So if you like sushi and/or have a special occassion coming up, get your bootie down here! It may become your favorite sushi spot in Chicago too. =)"
"I'm sold. This is probably the freshest sushi/sashimi place I've been to in Chicago, and would highly recommend to anyone!!I've tried both the popular omasake tasting menu ($60) and the premium omasake tasting menu ($130). Both were excellent.Favorites from their menus are the oyster shooters (both), the wagyu beef (premium) and the fatty tuna fish (premium). Ambiance is intimate and upscale modern without being pretentious. If you have 3 or more in your party, you'll get their private booths, which I really enjoyed sitting at. Make reservations in advanced. It's not a large venue and seats go fast! It's popular for a reason."
"People love this place and I always wonder why. We went up eating here when we are starving after work and the portions are not enough and the prices are sky high. Sure it's cute, but there are other places that you can go to get some great sushi. The staff is really friendly and help you make some smart choices. If you do do I recommend the calamari strings and whatever the chef's special role is. I didn't like the limited dessert menu. As someone with a big sweet tooth that is a must!!"
"/TL;DRSuper accommodating with great service. Spectacular food. Best gem is when you ask the waitstaff for their recommendation, and they lock up because they have a hard time telling you which one they love most.Since we were in the loop, getting here required taking a bit of drive with Uber to get there. Well worth it though./ATMOSPHEREOne way to describe this place would be small. From the outside, it looks it. Inside, it's perfectly cramped which creates a type of intimate surrounding. The booths near the sushi bar are private in a way since the walls are very high. The decor was quite warm and inviting./FOODWe went with the recommendation the waitstaff provided. It was on point. If you need an idea, go for the pearls. We couldn't decide between the escolar or maguro pearls so they split a single dish. Honestly, it was the best thing we ate there.I don't know though. I mean... char siu? Ridiculous. So damn good. We also had a selection of maki rolls. They were probably my least favorite but still definitely memorable./SERVICEExcellent. Attentive. Knowledgable. A little slow at times... but Kai Zan was packed out! They were gracious with accommodating our late arrival. Glad, too, since it turned out to be one of the best sushi meals I've ever had.HOW TO READ MY REVIEWS:1 Star - Does not approach edible. Enter at your own risk.2 Stars - If I'm in the area, I'd pick something else.3 Stars - I would stop by if I happen to be in the area.4 Stars - I would pick this place out of other places nearby.5 Stars - I would go out of my way to dine here."
"I can honestly say that this was the best meal I've ever eaten.My boyfriend and I had made reservations to go to Kai Zan several months ago, but did not go due to the distance (& ended up paying a cancellation fee -- take note of this when making a reservation). We finally made the trek several weeks ago, and now wholeheartedly regret not going that first time. Kai Zan is small & unassuming. We sat at the sushi bar & were immediately greeted by the chef. After he learned that my boyfriend is a recent sushi convert, he gave us an amazing appetizer on the house. Throughout our entire meal, he continued to check in with us. It made for an awesome, intimate experience.My boyfriend and I both ordered the 10 piece omakase, featuring the ""greatest hits"" from the regular menu & several off the menu dishes. We started out with various sushi items, moved on to soup & hot dishes, and finished with the best maki & sashimi I have ever tasted. I was a bit hesitant when I noticed the final course was just sashimi -- I have always been a huge nigiri fan, but I hadn't quite mentally acquiesced to the idea of eating just pieces of raw fish at this point -- but I was absolutely blown away. The salmon/sake sashimi was probably the best thing I've ever tasted & now I'm completely hooked on (good) sashimi.I'd 100% recommend the omakase. You'll leave full and dreaming of your next visit for only $60 + tip. Then again, the highlights for me were the pearls, the ""Angry Crab,"" the fiesta maki, & the dynamite mussels -- all of which are on the regular menu. Just go. Go now.Random notes: I really hate wasabi. I didn't mention this, but only 1 item had too much wasabi for me -- a wasabi vegetable salad type deal that was part of the biggest plate in the meal. Didn't bother me. We arrived at our reservation a tad late & were reminded there is a 2 hour limit at the sushi bar. Again, didn't bother me. Finally, we had the DMZ rosé with our dinner. It was great & I have now discovered it is available at the grocery store for $10."
"YES! YES! YES! I took my date her for a late dinner on Friday and it was great. I loved the atmosphere. It's very intimate, perfect for a date. The service was amazing, no wait, they answered our questions and made suggestions. As this was both of our first times, our waitress recommended we try the Chef's Choice. It was a ten course, small bite, meal. Of course with something like this there were things I loved, and others I could have lived with out. Overall I was very impressed. My date and I both loved our experience. If you are ever in the area looking for good sushi or just a great dinner experience, I'd highly recommend Kai Zan. I know I will be coming back the next time I'm in Chicago."
"My husband and I went here a few time, it has always been wonderful. This last visit a few weeks ago I was ever so slightly disappointed in a piece of sashimi we got, I mentioned it to my husband and as it turned out, the manager over heard me and brought us a new piece. I asked her why she did that and she told us how important it was that we got what we expected and that the experience was a good one.  I was truly impressed by this actually... here is a place that always gets great reviews, is always busy, but still found so much value in making sure we were happy, even without us asking. Love this place!Vicki"
"Boo and I had an incredibly amazing and fabulous meal last night. We don't like to celebrate Valentine's Day, but we still needed a reason to have a nice dinner date night, so we decided that this would be our Valentine's dinner. I'm sure we could have found any old reason to come here, though. It's the best sushi in Chicago!I've already been here a couple times but it was his first time. I guess you could say that I popped his Kai Zan cherry *high fives all around*. He got the omakase and I got some a la carte dishes off the menu. It was THE perfect way that we could enjoy a variety of their best dishes. For those of you who don't know, the omakase is the ""chef's choice"" course meal of on-the-menu AND off-the-menu favorites, so you get the entire spectrum (literally, all different colors and textures) of dishes that they have to offer. And ever since they posted their new uni toro tartare dish on their FB page, I've been dreaming of and totally drooling over it. So it worked out that I didn't get the omakase, because who can afford getting the omakase AND ordering this dish? Maybe all you big baller shot callers out there, but not me.Just a quick note about the service here: our server was super friendly and informative. I wonder how long it took him to memorize every ingredient in the dishes he would bring out? Mad props. And the chef brothers are amazing with their culinary creations, which makes for a very legit omakase.My top 3:Uni-Toro Tartare: Holy mother of sea urchins, batman! I was definitely in UNI HEAVEN with this dish and I will definitely get it every single time I return. Because this #unilover just can't get enough! The uni and toro are served with quail eggs and some other delicious goodness that I can't seem to remember (wasabi and other stuff), all over a bed of rice. It's best to mix it all in together so that you end up getting all the flavors in one bite. There's a side of several small sheets of nori that you can wrap the tartare in. DIY sushi FTW!Hamachi collar: OMFG this was melt in your mouth food porn awesomeness! The meat was SO tender and buttery and paired well with the ponzu sauce that came on the side. It's a fairly medium sized collar with plenty of fish meat to pick off, so I'm very glad that we got to try this. It's sold at market price, which was only about $14. Some places will charge more than that, so we were pretty happy that it wasn't incredibly expensive.Uni/Oyster Shooters: First of all, the presentation is beautiful. The shooters come in a lovely martini shaped glass and you can see the uni (or oyster) in the ponzu sauce. And then on top, you see a gorgeous sprinkling of black tobiko (fish eggs), an egg porn worthy quail egg, and chopped scallions. Since the uni (or oyster) and quail egg is more on the ""slimy"" side as far as texture goes, it's balanced out with the flavor pops of the black tobiko and the crunch of the scallions. And then of course, the lemony ponzu sauce ties it all together so that it's not too ""heavy"".It is no longer BYOB but they offer beer and wine."
"Amazing, delicious, belly-satisfying omakase meal that I am still dreaming about. Ever since the first course, I have been making a mental list of all the people I must bring and tell about Kai Zan. Not to mention, wondering when exactly is too-soon of a return for myself?! On this particular visit to Chicago, my boyfriend chose Kai Zan as our first kick-off meal (& bless his soul for finding it). The small, intimate setting of Kai Zan was the cherry on top. Not too loud, not too many people. We decided on the omakase 10-course meal and it was the best decision ever. Priced at $60/person, not only was it worth every penny but also a steal if you ask me. A few of my favorites were the Escolar Pearls (spicy seared escolar with soy & truffle oil) and the uni shooter (uni and scallop in ponzu sauce with raw quail egg). I also liked that they ended our meal with an assorted sashimi plate. It was a nice, clean way to end the 10-course meal. More toward the bottom of my list would be the Madai Carpaccio, only because I felt that the pesto overpowered the dish. But there wasn't a single item we had that I did not like. There are too many dishes to go through individually, but check out my pictures! Each dish was perfectly unique in it's own way. This is not your typical omakase meal and although I was nervous for the whole ""fusion"" thing, each dish left me in awe. It was interesting that they incorporated traditional items along with cooked items -- like our 7th dish which they called a main dish. Without doubt, I would highly recommend the omakase ... although I'm sure everything on the menu is worth trying. Counting down until we meet again, Kai Zan."
"If you're like me and you hate making decisions, Kai Zan's Chef's Choice Omakase is the way to go. Yeah it has a bit of a hefty price tag of $60, but it's well worth it. You leave it up to the chef to pick out the best of the best and they deliver 10 courses to your table.My favorites were the Escolar and Maguro pearls (oh my gosh, so good), and the Angry Crab - wow. So delicious.I did not like the Uni and Oyster Shooters but that is a personal preference, you should give those a try.I have been to Kai Zan before and not included in the Chef's Choice was the Karaage, my friend loved it but I wasn't as much of a fan, I definitely prefer their fish over anything. We also had the Apple Pie Shot which is definitely worth ordering for dessert - really unique dessert that I don't mind bragging about.Also, even though it's no longer BYOB the wine is a great price. We ordered the Domaine des Cantarelles Cabernet Sauvignon for $30 and it was a great addition to the meal."
"""Express yourself"" isn't just a song by Madonna; it's attitude, individuality, creativity, innovation, and interpretation coming to a full-circle.  We came to Kai Zan this evening to celebrate our five (5)-year anniversary.  Five (5) years ago, I said yes to my best friend, my gold-digger (ok...that was a joke), my chef at home, and most importantly, my foodie companion!  Of course, a reservation is highly recommended, if not, required since the spots do get filled up quickly, for it's a small venue.  We were lucky because we sat right in front of Chef Carlo and Chef Melvin, the dynamic duo.  Japan and I have a special connection.  I didn't grow up watching Disney movies and playing my little pony.  I had an unusual passion for dorama (Japanese soap operas).  Among 1000 plus dorama I've seen in my 29-year-old life so far, one of my favorites was the one titled ""Bambino,"" starring Jun Matsumoto (from a Japanese musical group, Arashi).  ""Bambino"" was a nickname for a young man, who came to work at a popular Italian restaurant in Tokyo.  He came from feeling conceited and thought he was Mr. Know-it-all.  Soon after he experienced a series of frustrations at his work place.  Finally, his transformation led him to becoming a professional who has gained respect and recognitions among his peers and supervisors.  When I observed the professionals who were working in the kitchen, the scenes from ""Bambino"" came live in my head.  How cool!  I got to watch all the actions happening while enjoying great food.  I think it's time to talk about the Omakase.  We chose the basic Omakase featuring Chefs' recommendations ($60/person) from the menu.  1) fatty tuna maki roll (on the house): the natural, rich fat from the tuna was unbelievably abundant, but it was melted immediately in my mouth.  What a great start of the night!  2) madai carpaccio: I felt that it was an Italian take-on on Japanese red snapper.  That basil miso was soothing and wasn't overly sour.  It was a very elegant, sophisticated dish.  3) escolar/maguro pearls: each piece of fish was perfectly seared.  This was a good transition to the following courses.  4) uni and oyster shooter: there was absolutely nothing to be intimidated by!  The ponzu sauce was really smooth, which harmonized and acted like a ""lubricant"" to bring the oyster, uni, and quail egg altogether.5) angry crab: the tuna and the spicy crab weren't angry to each other!  I felt the tuna was more of the protagonist, and the spicy crab played the auxiliary role. In other words, I tasted more of the tuna, not much of the spicy crab itself.  6) char siu/beef tataki: surprisingly, this meat dish was light because of the addition of yuzu.  7) shiitake mushroom soup: it also featured a tiny piece of oyster on the bottom.  I enjoyed the broth; it was flavorful yet simple.8) an assortment of entree dishes: what a luxury way to present the takoyaki!  Although the takoyaki wasn't my favorite, the octopus with wasabi sauce was a nice change-up for the palate!  You could definitely experience ""umami"" with this chef's creative combo.  9) dynamite mussel: the flavor of sake was soaked throughly into the mussel.  Sprinkling some of the lemon juice was a must!  I'm now have a brand-new perspective on mussels.  10) fiesta maki: how could you go wrong with avocado and fresh raw seafood?  11) an assortment of sashimi: the presentation was impeccable!  That was an awesome final chapter of the Omakase.  The service was very attentive.  Dining at Kai Zan was certainly an unforgettable experience.  I have no doubt that we will be back for the premium Omakase!  The street parking was fairly easy on Chicago Ave.  Otherwise, the CTA 66 (Chicago) bus can take you there, and be sure that you get off at Rockwell/Chicago."
"As a vegetarian, they had very limited selection so I couldn't rate this high from my point of view. I have heard amazing things from others, as the Yelp reviews indicate, for non-vegetarian selection. Request the booths - the ambiance there is quite cool. We were sat at the counter, so it was fun seeing the colorful preparations designed quite well."
"We ended up coming to Kai Zan sort of on a whim--we were downtown, had time to kill, and we were craving fresh food. Not only did we get fresh, we got straight up raw. Kai Zan was exactly how a Japanese restaurant should be, absent of cream cheese and creamy sauces and with a focus on delicious simplicity. Best Japanese restaurant I've been to to date.Definitely get:The uni shooterThe red snapper collarIf they have it (it was a special on the night we went) the uni tartar which came topped with quail egg, rice, and more as well as little seaweed strips so you can make DIY sushi. Sake, per your waiter's recommendationsMake sure to ask for the specials if your waiter doesn't offer the information. And, if you don't think you're into the whole raw egg thing, keep an open mind!!"
"Yelp needs to have an extra credit rating or something, because I cannot praise Kai Zan enough.  We ended up here for my girlfriend's birthday.  She used to live over this way, and when we started dating and were comparing ""This is the best sushi place in the city"" stories, she mentioned Kai Zan and stuck to it.  Every place I mentioned, she would just say, ""I want to take you to Kai Zan.""  I put her off long enough to make it part of her birthday evening, and I am kicking myself for waiting so long.  This was the best sushi experience I have had in the city, period.  We started off with some chutoro, then dove into the Omakase.  The chutoro was delicious, better than the otoro I have had some places.  I will not recount each and every course of the Omakase as that has been done ad nauseum, but I will point out some highlights.  I would make a meal out of the escolar and maguro bites.  Delectable.  A close second in the ""eat this until I'm full"" was the maguro stuffed with crab.  The shooters course included one with oyster and one with uni and scallop.  Both had quail egg.  The uni/scallop shooter was the freshest, most oceanic thing I recall having ever tasted.  The only courses I would not rave about were the roll and the sashimi plate.  The roll was a good roll, but it was still just a roll that didn't really showcase the fish.  The sashimi plate was excellent save for the maguro which inexplicably did not seem to be of the same quality as that which had been used in the other maguro courses.  It was still better than what you get at most sushi restaurants, but by the time that course (the 10th) came, I was getting spoiled.  The service was just fine.  Very pleasant, described each dish well, answered all questions.  Only complaint is that the meal was a bit rushed as compared to other Omakase dinners I have had.  A few times the next dish was brought right as we were finishing a course, and once we had two on the table at the same time.  And I am not a slow eater.  I can be quite the pig, if I have to be honest, so I don't feel bad saying I felt rushed.  I really cannot understand any of the reviewers who have expressed disappointment with the prices at Kai Zan.  $60 for an Omakase of this quality is an absolute bargain.  Try getting all of those same dishes at Arami, Katsu, Macku Signature, Momotaro, whatever your favorite sushi place is, and I feel safe saying it's going to cost more by a decent amount, and there are not more than a handful of sushi restaurants in Chicago where the quality will be in the same ballpark. I have other daily drivers I will continue to go to, but Kai Zan just secured a position as the place I will go to when I really want to do it right."
Yup...the best sushi ever.It's all been said...just go.I loved the decor.  The private booths are fantastic.The food was plenty and amazing!!!I loved everything about this place except it's distance from my house.
I love the food here. The best sushi in Chicago is very fresh and authentic.  The chef came to our table to tell us that he had personally prepared the salmon skin himself.  The deserts are so delicious too.
"I hesitate to give 5 stars because I've only been there once.  Knowledgable and professional staff.  We sat at the bar, which I think I actually preferred over a booth, something about sitting side by side.  Everything we ordered-sushi, oyster shooters, appetizers, etc-was amazing.  I have to go back soon so I can raise it to a 5!"
"The waiter that took our order wasn't friendly. He looked like he was constantly despising other people and treated us like 2-year olds. But.... the food was great! So good that we could completely ignore the waiter as he ignored us. We ordered a $70 omakase ($60 if you don't want to share), 2 chutoro nigiris and a chicken teriyaki. I can't say I enjoyed all of them, and because there was no desert so it didn't feel like a complete omakase meal, but some of the dishes were AMAZINGLY Delicious.A lot of the things were not on the menu. But if you have sth you want in mind, you can always ask them to prepare it for you. (Here's our waiter trying to look like a pro: ""I mean, if you're a sushi bar, you have to have those things."")"
"My boyfriend and I thought we would grab a table on Friday right after I arrived to Chicago for the weekend. They were all booked -- highly recommend making a reservation. We made a reservation for the following Sunday at 8:15PM. I was glad they seated us at the bar. I enjoyed watching the orders come in and watching Chef Carlo & Chef Melvin create each dish spectacularly.  It felt like this was something they could do with their eyes closed, incredibly entertaining. We ordered the Chef's Choice ($60/person) and it was hands down the best sushi/sashimi experience that I've ever had. It's 10 courses -- I began to feel myself slow down at 5. We finished all, save for the last dish which they boxed up and we took home. There were a few dishes, like the shooters with quail eggs and scallops, where I had to stop a prepare myself for something new. No worries though, the flavors were delicious and fresh. It's a small restaurant, but the atmosphere is intimate and comfortable.  Our server was well-versed in each dish that came our way. The rest of the staff was very attentive. Our water glasses were never empty and our plates were cleared promptly. The chef slid an off-menu roll across the bar between the 7th and 8th course that was the most wonderful marriage of flavors and textures that I wish my boyfriend hadn't eaten his so that I could have another. 100% satisfied. I would recommend Kai Zan to everyone. I would love to go again. My advice is to try everything, take it slow, and arrive with an empty stomach."
"2 days after eating one of the most spectacular dinners of 2015 yet I'm still dreaming about every course served up at Kai Zan. I try to keep up with the foodie scene in Chicago even though I moved out to the east coast a year ago and stumbled upon Kai Zan's instagram page about a month ago. Kai Zan isn't your momma's sushi restaurant so check your expectations.. and everything you know about sushi at the door. Now step in. The decor will quite literally set the tone for the rest of the night, it's dark..moody...sexy... you may blush a little when you step in even. The staff is incredibly friendly though and you'll feel at ease immediately. If you're lucky you might get seated at the bar so you can watch the magic happen, but the cozy booths lend themselves to a more intimate seating if you're there as a couple or a small group and want your privacy. While stalking Kai Zan's instagram I basically had my heart set on trying out their Omakase menu ...but literally everything screams to be eaten and the choices are insane! how do you pick one over the other?? the Omakase is a 10 course hand selected menu by the chefs which really does introduce you to almost everything on the menu. It's special.. it truly is special. We started off with the Japanese Red Snapper wrapped around toro and topped with basil miso olive oil and tobiko... and ZOMG!!! I may have had a moment ... wink wink ....followed by more amazingness.. but my personal favorite had to be the Oyster and scallop shooters topped with ponzu sauce and fresh Uni.. how is this even real life? So glad we got 2 shooters each cuz there's no way I would have settled for just 1. I think the chef over heard me gushing about my love affair with Uni, cuz he ended up treating us to an extra course of hamachi with uni on the house.. over this amazing sweet mango sauce of some sort.. I stopped paying attention to every detail after some time.. you'll see the pictures on my IG and know what I'm talking about.  I just wanted to enjoy each bite and every moment. By the end of dinner we were sufficiently stuffed..split dessert between the two of us and had a couple drinks. Definitely made for a fun girl's night out and you really do need to go here with someone who appreciates sashimi in its best form. Save this one for a special night... but make it happen soon!"
"What happened to Kai Zan?My wife and I came here two years ago when they were trying and the place blew us away.  The menu was interesting and the food was enough to keep us talking about it, telling everyone we know to go, since.And then we show up yesterday and from the moment we walk in the door we could tell things have changed.The sushi was well, boring, bland, and less exciting than prepackaged sushi that you can get from 7/11.The hosts first words to us didn't mention our reservation notes at all, celebrating our first date after the birth of our child, but we were instead told that we have 90 minutes to eat and then they have to give the table to someone else.Our server was strange but knew what he was doing.  The menu was converted into a lame plastic laminate with the descriptions of the food being dead on.  Tune and cucumber - that literally all that's in there.This place sucks now"
"Man!!! This hit me right on every level. I love Asian food. Kimchee, sushi, bibimbap, sashimi, etc.  This place has it all. And they had amazing service. I went with the Chef's Choice. 10 amazing plates. I was stuffed. Tip: get the pickled vegetables...they were electrifying."
"Kai Zan is the most innovative and decadent sushi restaurant I have been to in Chicago. Highly recommend the Omakase if you're in the mood to treat your taste buds to some exciting flavor profile.  They have a great beer selection for those who love the enhanced ocean flavors brought on by beer.  The decor and the seating areas are minimalist yet cozy and inviting and the service is impeccable. Try it, expect to drop some bucks but you definitely won't regret it."
"The food was terrific. However their slouchy long-haired waiter rubbed our entire party wrong with the lax attitude rubbed us entirely the wrong way. He had no opinion on any of the dishes, made us feel stupid for not knowing the portion sizes, and made no efforts to make first time visitors feel welcome. Also, their wait staff picked up two dishes which weren't even completely finished. Hey! We still have ginger on the plate asshole! Michelin rated for the food, not the service. This food was AMAZING but find some new employees"
"This is the best dining experience I have had in Chicago.I went on a double date and the four of us sat in the most intimate dining alcove. I felt like we were in our own private dining room. The food was absolutely phenomenal. We all order the omakase and I highly recommend it. If you aren't feeling overly hungry you can split and omakase with one other person for $70. That price just adds a few additional portions.The sashimi is so fresh. The dishes we received included a few classics as well as more experimental tastes like the ""shooters"" which consisted of oyster, urchin, and quail egg with a bit of tobasco. The omakase is 10 courses brought out one by one. It's an experience not to be missed."
"On vacation from Florida, for my sushi night I wanted the best Chicago had to offer.Kai Zan did not disappoint.I chose Kai Zan because they were well known for their Omakase. (Chef chooses all dishes)My girlfriend got the special omakase ($120) and I got the regular ($60) and we shared everything.The best omakase I've ever had. Impeccable serviceSushi Chefs were amazing! After 3 museums, a great comedy show and an amazing architecture tour- it was my experience at Kai Zan that I will remember the longest.Thanks!"
"amazing first time experience!i went for my wedding anniversary and our server was justin.quite frankly this was a michelin star like experience.  we had the omakase!like a prie fix tasting menu for 60. it was awesome. 10 course dinner!red snapper with oil and tobiko carpacciooyster and scallop shooters with quail eggescolar and tuna makia spicy tuna bitedashi soup w tuna and mushrooma salad with garlic polenta and seared tunagrilled shrimp salad with tako yaki and pork belly and peanut sauce and octo w wasabifinished off with dynamite musclesand salmon spicy roll then sashimi were some of the coursesmy only critique is save one of the courses and change it to a desert if the chefs had made a desert finale we would be in heaven!its a lot of food even at 9 coursesamazing tastes and we had such a good time the ambience, service and food was better than i have had at high michelin star placesget the calamari as well!thanks for a great dining experience!"
"Magnificent! I came here with my boyfriend, sister, and brother-in-law. It was an early celebration for my sister, who happens to be a chef, so I was trying to choose the best meal in Chicago that wouldn't break the bank, and a place that we all haven't been to yet. And what do you know, Kai Zan was just that spot!We all got the Omakase Chef's Choice 12-course tasting. This is basically a surprise tasting, where everything is left to the Chef. Of course if you have any restrictions or allergies, the Chef will adjust the menu accordingly. I have to say, without exaggerating at all, this was the best seafood experience I have ever had in Chicago. Every single course contained the freshest and highest quality fish. I am super picky about sushi and especially sashimi, but this literally melts in your mouth. Every course was full of surprises and full of bold flavors. I have attached all of the food from the courses to this review if you want to check it out. It's BYOB but the corkage fee is $15, which has gone up from when they first started. The Omakase 12-course menu is $60/person, which is very very reasonable for the amount of quality food you get. Although the neighborhood seems sketchy, it's really not bad. Plus, parking is plentiful which makes it easier to get to.The one and only thing I would change is incorporating 1-2 dessert courses at the very end of the meal because after the ""main course"" there are more maki and sashimi courses."
Carlo and Melvin the brothers who own this have an amazing gift of creating interesting and delicious taste combinations. We had the Chefs Choice tonight and it was amazing!! The team they have built are top notch and first class!! Love.
"On my list for a LONG time, Kai Zan was just okay. Maybe my expectations were too high. I had the chef's menu - a couple exceptional dishes/bites, but a few that were so-so. Worth a try for newbies. I highly recommend you study the menu before you go. It's on the smaller side and a bit confusing. I was intimidated by it  - simply because it was so hard to dig into.Service was terrific."
"I'm going to keep it simple and sweet as possible if you don't want to read all of this: Kai Zan is geared towards a *very* specific sort of demographic. Not to say that this is a bad thing, but then from what I have experienced from this first time visit today, Kai Zan has definitely pulled the ""beginner's club"" card upon my boyfriend and I as we were in the restaurant for about nearly two hours, oogling over the 10-course wonder that is the premium Omakase dinner. I feel that Kai Zan tries to live up to its expectations and the ever-tenacious repertoire of tuna-loving ""sushi freaks"" based in the West who have not even gone outside the realms of the 'gang of four': salmon, tuna, yellowtail (hamachi), and ebi (shrimp), with their names in acronym form read out as 'stye', which is probably enough clues to why I think that my visit to Kai Zan has made me feel like someone who is completely clueless and new to sushi.Back to what I ordered: the 10-course Premium Omakase Dinner. It is advertised as having non-traditional ingredients, which looked very intriguing, as Kai Zan seems to pride itself over as having a Fusion element with their food as well. At the time my boyfriend and I ordered this, it was $130 per person. Under the assumption that Kai Zan interprets Omakase as ""up to the chef['s mood and choice]"", we were cool with everything until we realized that we're still in a sushi establishment based in the West. Our server, who I forgot the name of (I'm sorry in advance!) answered a few questions that we had as much as she could, mainly with concerns of being served rolls, wraps, and gimmicks to please the individuals who aim to eat foreign cuisines to appear more ""cultured"" or ""exotic"". Bad news was the Omakase here is very much a predetermined menu, which really made me a bit wary about what was about to come. Good news was she ensured that we wouldn't receive any of that bad stuff, which we are THANKFUL for, but then we stumbled upon the next level of how sushi culture became a realm for buzzwords and people trekking to Japan's Tsukiji Market in Tokyo just to take pictures of tuna, boasting about the price and name of the meat rather than the quality, and then leaving promptly without getting a taste.Buzzwords. Ootoro, Chuutoro, Akami, and Wagyu are the main triggers when it comes to thinking about Japanese food. We received all of these, if not more in our dinner tonight. I'm not sad about it. I'm not mad about it either. It's just that I felt a bit underwhelmed for paying $130 to receive stuff that is of excellent quality, taste, and presentation, but not that interesting nor memorable. So much for the innovation that seemed to burst out of this place. Out of the 10 dishes we had, at least 4 of them had some sort of tuna in it. Having one sort of thing once is great. Having one sort of thing in different variables but then are tangent to each other (i.e. ootoro nigiri with pickled wasabi, then shoyu glazed chuutoro)?? No, thank you!!! Also, there was no uni in our selection. I'm a bit shocked there myself, having paid that amount and not receiving the therapeutic treatment of sea urchin, but instead having a load of fatty-cut fish served to me with no innovative palate cleanser in sight or mind to balance the elements out. It was extremely heavy on the mouth, and by extension, the soul and the stomach; contrary to the nature of enjoying sushi, sashimi and nigiri. Sure, this would be an excellent sensory and pleasure overload to those who aren't that acquainted with the taste and art of raw fish, but then I was looking for something to remember, something unique. And that's why I decided on getting the Premium Omakase, let alone an Omakase meal. I left disappointed. I was expecting to be served stuff that will give me the chills, something that I wouldn't be able to recover from, leaving me wanting for more. I didn't feel like I got the Omakase treatment that usually entails a spur of the moment choice to go with whatever has been served to my table already, plus the requirement of ingenuity that comes with being called an 'Asian Fusion' place that would make my head, heart, and stomach race with excitement. After the 'honeymoon' period of my meal, I just felt completely empty and couldn't even recall what I have ate less than an hour ago. I would want to give Kai Zan another shot at redeeming themselves whenever I have the cash to spare, or if someone is willing to treat me there (*wink wink, nudge nudge*).If you want a good sushi experience here, get the Omakase. If you want an even better sushi experience here, research a bit before you visit, and write down what you want to try since Kai Zan can make stuff to order, as long as its a standard sushi, sashimi, or nigiri item of course. You played it too safe, Kai Zan. Until next time."
Get the omakase!!! It's 10 courses of amazingness! Be willing to try new things and you will have a great experience!
"The service is spectacular. Although we were designated with one server, multiple staffs check in with us and brought our food. Water was always filled. They had complementary green tea. It was amazing to sit in the bar because you will have the experience to watch the sushi chefs and cooks make the food for you. It was very enjoyable to watch. They take their time and are so careful with their food. I would suggest getting  the omasake if it's your first time. It's a sample of all their specialties for $60 which included about  9-10 courses of food. Personally, I thought the cooked food was alright. However, what was really delicious was the sushi and fish. I have never had fish this fresh. It's so fresh that it doesn't even taste like fish. Once you eat here, you'll realize what you have been missing your whole life. I love this place and recommend everyone to try this place. You will not regret! Proceed with caution as you will get addicted."
"Wow, probably one of the best omakase dinners I've ever had. There's a $60 option or a $120 premium option. The $60 option offers a tasting of some of the more popular items on the menu. The $120 option offers off menu, premium items.  I got the premium option obviously and it certainly did not disappoint. Literally everything I had was unique and delicious. Several of the items in the premium option include fatty tuna and uni, which are two of my favorites. A few of my friends got the $60 option and it also looked amazing. You really can't go wrong with either option.  The service was also very, very good. The waitresses were very knowledgeable and nice. The pace at which the food came out was also perfect.We ate here during our trip to Chicago and of all the spots we went to (Girl and the Goat, Avec, etc.) this was our favorite. Just tasted really fresh and clean."
"Kai Zan.Man.It's one classy restaurant.I love the private booths.  I love the regular tables, too.  The staff is nothing short of exceptional.  Accommodating, enthusiastic and wanting to make your experience amazing.And the experience is serious.  When I have brought people to Kai Zan I've preempted our visit by explaining that this is not your typical sushi experience.  Yeah, they have a few rolls, but you're not getting a spicy tuna roll.  You're getting shooters with oysters and raw quail egg.  You're getting interesting sashimi selections.  Not for the sushi virgin, probably, but definitely for those with adventurous palettes looking for something... different.  And exciting.  And most of all, really yummy.Best bet is to go for the chef's special, which will be a tour of what's freshest, best and most exciting that evening.  Be sure to tell them what you like and what you don't like.  They'll accommodate.  And you'll be glad you ordered it because you pay $60 and just get a bunch of awesome plates.  Definitely the way to go.Despite having a less than stellar reaction to uni last weekend (apparently it happens), I still rank Kai Zan with 5 sexy sushi stars.  They're awesome."
"I want to give 3 stars at first, the tuna and salmon sashimi is really bad,however, the Madai Carpaccio is soooo great! And recommend the escolar and Maguro pearls are nice too~"
I love everything about the place. The location is cool too since its kind of on the border of where everything ends on Chicago avenue. You wouldn't expect such a great sushi spot in Humboldt park.
"Hands down the BEST sushi I have had in Chicago, and trust me, I've frequented most places here. Born and raised in Chicago, I took a few years off and headed to LA. Lucky for me, I worked at one of the best Sushi places in the area, and since my return, I have craved the quality and flavors that I had on the west coast... FINALLY, yes FINALLY I have found THE place.Make reservations. This hidden gem is small. If you're seated at the Sushi bar, enjoy the scenic view of watching the chefs at work- seriously amazing.Order a bottle of cold sake and make it a night to remember.I suggest going the Omakase route. If you're feeling fancy and want something truley unique - go premium! You will not be disappointed. Forget your normal midwest sushi ordering of going to the roll route, and let these chefs do what they do best. 10 courses of surprises... the best surprises to ever hit your taste buds.Some highlights:Japanese red snapper topped w/ black tobiko, basil miso, and micro greensEscolar and Maguro with truffle oil soaked scallionsUni and Oyster ShootersFried tako with yaki sauce, wasabi mayo and bonito flakesNew Zealand mussels topped w/ black tobiko, and negi mayoSeasonal Japanese pickled vegetableSpicy crab wrapped in fresh tuna, topped w/ tempura crunchI can't wait to go back. I'm so pleased that this place exists."
"5 stars all the way.Been here a few times and every time has been perfect. Have done the a la carte option as well as the 10 course menu and neither disappoints. If it's your first time, I suggest doing the Omakase. All the fish is so fresh and delicious. A few favorites below:-orange rush-angry crab-either pearl-lobster sashimiI can't remember the name, but we had this sashimi that was served in a pot and coal-smoked. It was amazing. I suggest asking your server about it and, if they have it, order it."
"Japanese omakase is one of life's greatest joys.  It allows for maximum appreciation of what you're eating: everything is beautifully presented, every morsel a universe of harmonious flavors. I've had sushi omakase at Nakazawa and Gari, but Kai Zan is a totally different beast. The sheer variety and quantity were enough to justify the $60+ bill per person.Like Gari, they are quite experimental with their sushi. But they also serve tastings of other grilled and cooked items.  For example, we had takoyaki (!) and pork belly and uni and oyster shots.  It's a well planned and perfectly timed orchestration of courses.  As for quantity, you get more than a bite's worth per course.  In fact, we each got two pieces of several dishes, which is terrific because sometimes you just want to savor the same piece all over again (and again and again).Because it was our friend's birthday, we brought in a birthday cake, and they kindly provided the candles.  The inside is cozy with a bar in one room and private enclaves for big parties.  That Michelin bib gourmand win is well earned!"
"Wow. Not sure if this place is better than Seadog, but, very close. I HAVE TO GIVE 5 STARS THE FIRST VISIT I'M SORRY IT WAS TOO GREAT. I broke my rule, I usually have to go twice to a place before I give out the big red, but man everything was perfect. I liked how many different people had tasks, water guy, sushi guy, waiter guy, beer lady, host girl and they were all psyched to be there. I was solo so I really got nice attentive service which actually was quite wonderful and didn't make me feel like I was eating alone. Which is the way I prefer to eat alone. Small intimate place though so I wouldn't come with my whole biker gang, probably just Rodney and Tito and maybe Purple Steve. Even the guy sitting next to me alone at the sushi bar was just the right amount of talkative. I wrote a haiku about Kai Zan: I am a fan andI'll go again in the endWe all become fish"
"Had one of my favorite meals ever at Kai Zan and what a deal it was at $60 a person! I'm someone who generally orders similar things over and over even though I want to be trying new things, so a tasting menu is ideal. Not one course in this 11-course tasting menu let me down. The sashimi was melt in your mouth good, the mussel was dreamy, the pearls were divine. Ooh my mouth is watering.See my picture for most of the courses and do yourself a favor and go here ASAP."
"Not sure if I could like this place anymore.. I have been here twice and both times I was beyond blown away by the food, atmosphere and service. The first time I sampled various different items off the menu and the second time I did the Omasake tasting. Let me tell you that the Omasake tasting was by far the most amazing combination of things I have ever eaten. Everything is beyond fresh and you leave feeling very satisfied and full. My table of four chose to BYOB and for the four of us it was a flat fee of $30 for bringing our own wine. This may seem like a lot, but there was no limit on how many bottles we were allowed to bring so it made it worth while.If you have not tried this place, make your reservation now and prepare your taste buds to be in heaven!"
"Was visiting Chicago from St. Louis, and some friends brought me here.  Hands down the best sushi and Japanese plates I've had (for being in the Midwest.)My mother is Japanese, so I can be a harsh critic.For 4 people our bill was about $300.00, so your bill can definitely add up, but we left full and completely satisfied.  Even the waiter's knowledge of the menu (and things you can order off the menu) were impressive.  What a treat.   Oh, and be sure to make a reservation first!"
"EXTERIOR: 2.5/5INTERIOR: 3.5/5 (odd-shaped, very small interior. TIGHT SEATING)CUSTOMER SERVICE: 5/5 (the waiter was very attentive and honest, but it is very unusual to sit AT the sushi bar and not be able to speak with the sushi chef; the sneeze guard was enormous, and Kai Zan is run like a factory line; the person in front of the sushi bar area was a plater).CLEANLINESS: 5/5QUALITY OF FOOD: 3/5TASTE OF FOOD: 2.5-3/5-------(**note: I rate each eatery relative amongst its type/range in THAT city.  So, no, I'm not rating this restaurant compared to Alinea or some Michelin-star restaurant.  I rate it and analyze it's component qualities (above) from 1-5 compared to other eateries with similar food type, aura, and price range)(+) DISHES: madai carpaccio, angry crab, orange rush""ok"" DISHES:  4 uni shooters (uni quality was acceptable but not fantastic; seasoning is very American, using tabasco sauce, etc), 4 oyster shooters (I prefer my oysters to be very cold), kamo duck skewer (duck is hard to mess up; dish was unmemorable), 1 pair BBQ eel (eel is also hard to mess up)(-) DISHES: tako skewer (rubbery), char siu pork belly skewer with kimchi (pork not seasoned traditionally in the Korean style, and kimchi was extremely bland), 2 pairs of torched salmon sashimiCOMPLIMENTARY dishes: escolar pearls (I generally do not eat escolar, because of what it will do to your GI movement), maguro pearls (excellent), eskimo clouds, 2 apple pie shooters~~~~~We nearly ordered the entire menu and some things off the menu  I will say this, Kai Zan was given a $$$$ rating on Yelp, but in fact, I found it extremely affordable for a sushi spot.  It was more like $$, while Katsu (which we went to later in the week) was EXTREMELY expensive (and not worth it... it's like Nobu prices for medium-quality sushi).  For everything we ordered, I believe the bill was under $120?It should be noted that Kai Zan is not an authentic sushi restaurant in regards to their flavor profile and size of sushi.  Some inauthentic places border on large or small portions; Kai Zan is on the very small end.  Their makis are served in pieces of 4 that are square-sized.  They are very bite-sized.  However, they are very affordable (I believe ~$8-9 for the set of 4).I have been attempting to hunt down a fresh, amazing sushi spot in Chicago.  So far, I have had no success.  Kai Zan's sashimi quality was not remarkable; it was neither good nor bad.  However, I did not like how they prepared their sashimi.  I felt that the chefs generally needed more training with fish and various dishes.  For example, I asked for 2 pairs of torched salmon, and they did not know how to torch the salmon.  Sushi chefs will typically select fatty salmon belly, sprinkle it with rock salt, and torch it half-way.  However, where Kai Zan seems to excel is their customer service.  The waiter was very attentive.  In addition, while we were not able to speak with any of the sushi chefs, they realized we were ordering everything, and sent us a few complimentary dishes.In general, while I wasn't displeased with Kai Zan, I was surprised that it has a Michelin star.  Overall, I would recommend everyone try Kai Zan once to form their own opinion.  It wasn't a negative experience; the staff is very amenable, and the restaurant is fairly trendy right now."
"WORTHS YOUR EVERY PENNY!!Kai Zan is one of the best Japanese restaurants I have been to in the US. Their dishes were so fresh, innovative, and unbelievably delicious. I highly recommend the Uni and Tuna DIY hand roll and the salmon press. I love this place so much!"
"The best sushi in Chicago, hands down.  No need to run to overrated downtown, when you have an absolute 5-star restaurant with phenomenal service.  I took my boyfriend there for a celebratory dinner and he was stunned as much as I was.  And, I'm hard to please, especially when it comes to sushi in Chicago, LA, or New York.  We both had the 5 courses, every one was deliciously prepared, the first time I was happy enough to try sea urchin as well.  I need to go back; now that I'm in LA, I know I'll be hitting it up if I'm anywhere close to flying back to cold Chitown weather."
Wow!!! The atmosphere is nice and cozy . We ordered the Chef's Choice and it was amazing. My favorite course was oyster / uni shooters . Excellent service ! Can't wait to go back !!!
"Love, LOVE, the sushi here... Everything I have tried, I enjoyed immensely. The Green Monster roll and the Orange Rush are absolutely delicious... I do miss the days when it was BYOB... But options for booze, are never a bad thing!!"
One of the best dining experiences I've had so far. Very intimate and personal. Each dish comes with a bursts of unique flavors with nothing that tastes similar to one another. Great place for a date. It's reasonably priced for the treatment and great quality food you get. I would definitely come back when I get the chance again and try everything else. The hand roll uni and toro topped with quail egg was my favorite there. The char siu was out of this world.
"This was my 3rd dinner restaurant stop during a recent visit to Chicago.  It's a relatively small restaurant so you must make a reservation and stick to your reserved time because most likely they can't fit you in earlier or too much later - be prompt!  It is not a totally traditional Japanese restaurant but I do recommend the omakase to eat the best of the best here!  I loved the mushroom soup, the oyster and uni shooters, the char sui bite and the sashimi (so fresh, love!!) the best.  They spice up some of their dishes - let's just say the wasabe will clear your sinuses!  Service was attentive and patiently explained the menu and dishes.  And I love the decor of this place - you feel like you stepped into a home in a Japanese village.  Have them call you a taxi if needed after your meal as taxis aren't too frequent in this area."
"This is the best sushi spot in Chicago and I've been to many! It's up there with the real fancy shit in loop too, chefs menu is EXCELLENT! And the price is too good to be true ! I'm so impressed and so is my BF and he's been to Shiros in Seattle! Everyone is nice and smiley and our waitress was so adorable and well trained. It's tough to get in so I almost don't want to encourage people to come LOL, but I tell like everyone I know about them anyway. I hope they expand or something ... I love this place to pieces !"
"This is my first yelp review and I wanted to make sure it was for the favorite restaurant  of my wife and I in Chicago. We have lived all over the world and have fortunately (or unfortunately) tasted some great sushi, so we are kind of sushi snobs as a result. We have lived in Chicago for four years now and struggled to find something on par with where we have lived previosuly until we discovered Kai Zan in November 2012. In many ways, this has been our baby. We have watched it grow from a 17 seater relatively easy place to get a reservation place to a restaurant highly recommended and regarded by lthe ocal food press. That said, the service and personal touch has not changed as the place has grown up.The wait staff are really good and welcoming. Each table is given a 2 hour allocation, but we find them very accomodating if the group is having a good time and you run over a little bit. The owners Carlo and Melvin are a real treat. They offer amuse bouches. That could be because we come in about every 6 weeks, but my guess is it is something they just like to do. They make an effort to come by the tables to interact with the guests. Both of them are incredibly humble and warm people. One can even get off menu items. The uni toro tartare is an example of this!My recommendation to first time diners is to either do the $60 or $90 tasting. If you can afford the $90, I would recommend doing this. This place is great for groups as they have booths that can seat 6 people and contain the noise of the group very nicely.I was slighly saddened to see them move away from BYOB even though I am not a big drinker until I saw that the drink menu is quite reasonable. The last time we were in there a bottle of nice white wine was only $21. This is a place that is also good to bring people who may not be the biggest fans of sushi as they have char-broil items that are delicious as well. They did a pop up ramen night, which my wife said was delicious. It would be great to see them do this more often or even incorporate into the menu, but I can understand if they want to keep the menu more focused on traditional cuisine.Carlos and Melvin well done, you have a great restaurant and a place we always take visitors to town. This place is one of only two places (the other being Hot Doug's) that we have actually had people fly to town solely for the purpose of dining here. We cannot say enough good things about this place."
This deserves 10 stars!! Great quality of fish and the service was perfect. Me and my mom had the Chef's Choice and it was insanely good and also not too overpriced for what you are getting. Can't wait t go back!
"I've eaten here twice over the past year or so and it's still one of my favorite restaurants, and the best Japanese restaurant I've ever experienced. The combination of flavors and freshness of ingredients is out of this world! On both occasions I had the Chef's menu tasting. I recommend it if you want to sample a little of everything on the menu. I can't say enough good things about the food creations they've come up with. You've got to try it for yourself! On top of it all, the service is outstanding - friendly and attentive, but not overly so. Just the right amount. Atmosphere is casual and comfortable, not pretentious at all. If you enjoy eating out, Kai Zan should be high on your list of establishments to experience in Chicago!"
A sushi joynt with Billecart-Salmon rosé on the menu ... wow!The Omakase is the way to go.  Everything was thoughtfully prepared and fresh.  Definitely moves to the top of my fav sushi spots.Will definitely be back.
Chef's menu was amazing!!! Although I didn't appreciate being told by the hostess that there was  another reservation after (curse of the 5:30 rez) and thus there was a time limit on our booth because it made me feel rushed as we went through the 10 courses of amazing fish. Other than that rather curt notification from the hostess the food was amazing and the service staff was knowledgable and attentive.
"What is there to say that hasn't been said already...one of the top 5 meals I've had in Chicago! My biggest regret is not doing the $60 Omakase chefs experience.- Reservations - Get your reservation and get it a week early if you don't want to eat at 5 or 9. Please note, they are closed Wednesdays. The interior is intimate and casual, though unlike many small sushi restaurants who maximize space by decreasing your personal space, Kai Zan has booths lining the wall that feel spacious and personal thanks to trendy dividers. We sat at the sushi bar, which I worried would be crowded and uncomfortable but after the face I  think it is probably the best seat in the house! It allows you a glimpse in to the care and dedication put in to each dish and is way more exciting than reading words off the menu. - The Kai Zan difference -Sushigasm's await! I am one of those 'sushi' connoisseurs  who usually chooses the roll with the most cream cheese, avocado or spicy mayo. Kai Zan has for ever changed not only my sushi habits but my life. They're dishes are packed with fresh clean fish and flavors. Though if you are not a raw fish fan we saw them making up some of the entree offerings with noodles, seasonal vegetables and your choice of portion, they looked great and a really big portion. Our meal was $100 for 2 including, tip, appetizers, rolls, skewers, two desserts and the corkage fee! (prices are not online so off memory) + Appetizer:-Maguro Pearls 4pc - Rice spheres topped with fresh tuna, spicy mayo, chili oil and creamy wasabi+ Kushi Lava Rock Char Broiled Skewers:-Scallop - four bite sized scallops with caramelized onion sauce-Pork Belly - with kimchiAmazing smokey flavor and really cheap ($3-5), I'd say try them all!!+ Sushi:-Angry Crab ($9) 2 pieces - Fresh tuna, spicy crab with chef's tograshi.-Orange Rush ($10) 2 pieces - Salmon, scallop with citrus glaze.Both were out of this world in presentation and flavor, consisting of 95% fresh fish fillet these bites are hearty and satisfying. -Flaming Tuna Roll ($14) for 8 pieces -Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and avocado with seared tuna. Great flavor and  crunch. + Dessert: - Homemade Cheesecake with seasonal berries - the texture is a bit more gelatinous than most but its delicious- Lava Cake with Sesame ice cream - The ice cream has a slight peanut butter flavor and it is out of this world! Free tip:BYOB but it was a $15 corkage fee for 2, which I personally feel is outlandish, good thing their food is amazing!!"
Just get the Omakase and thank me later.
"Best sushi in the city. Went here for Valntine's Day and got the special which consisted of a 12 course small plate meal (very filling!) for $85 each. It gave us a good idea of what Kai Zan has to offer and was an awesome deal. The fish here is fresh a hell and the atmosphere is small and trendy. It gives you one of those feelings that you are ""in the know"" when it comes to Chicago sushi spots. Anyway, I enjoyed everything I tried (no lie) but my favs were: ANGRY CRAB (this is a MUST), Orange Rush, and the Oyster Shooters. I know the angry crab is expensive when its not in the deal, but try it...It meltsss in your mouth. Ever since Vday I have been craving this place like no other. Kai Zan is my happy place and I will be back."
"I had a wonderful meal at Kai Zan, as always. The scallop pearls (special) was phenomenal and the toro/uni on sushi rice bowl was cremy and delicious. I am only giving them 3 stars because our dining experience was significantly affected by constant reminders of ""how much time we have left for our designated meal time,"" when we were already told multiple times during the reservation process that we only have 1.75 hrs to dine. While it's understandable that at a high volume restaurant such as this they need to facilitate turnover, but there are ways of reminding your customers to wrap up other than telling us ""you only have 15 min,"" when we were already done eating and just having a cup of tea. So, 5 stars on the food. 3 after having deal with someone telling us that we need to get ourselves out of there on time."
"Terrific food! I was expecting a typical Japanese sushi restaurant with a few standout items, but the menu is quite different and exciting. I had dinner on a cold Sunday night with my mom, and I was glad that we had a reservation, since the space is kind of small.We shared a variety of items, including a couple of charbroiled skewers (shiitake and shrimp), the escolar pearls, the orange rush, and the flaming tuna maki. All were very good, but my favourite was the orange rush -- scallops wrapped in fish with a citrus glaze. Delicious! The portions were all small, besides the maki (standard 8 pieces), but we left feeling content after ordering the blondie & ice cream dessert. The blondie was probably the only item that didn't blow us away, although the salted caramel ice cream was wonderful.Service was a little slow to start, but once we ordered, the food arrived pretty quickly. The space is also very cramped, with a narrow aisle between the sushi bar and the booths. Not distracting while we were eating, but it required some awkward choreography to get down the aisle when we were leaving."
"Theeeee BEST sushi you will eat in Chicago. You see the reviews, it speaks for itself. Staff is super friendly, knowledgable and the sushi is to die for.If i could eat here every week, i would. Now i'm just trying to find another reason/occasion to go back!!!If you're still reading this.. StopGO. GO RIGHT NOW!"
Uni shooter and the Orange rush -  are the must have ! Everything was great :)We will definitely come back again
"We were certainly treated incredibly well here.  There was a mixup with the timing of our reservation, but the restaurant handled it cheerfully and efficiently.  The private booth was lovely and calming, our waiter was friendly, informative, and slightly ironic, and the pacing of our food was prompt without feeling rushed.  Unfortunately, I just can't say I liked the food particularly.  A couple of the early sushi/etc. dishes were tasty, vibrant, and flavorful.  But most of the others I found indifferent, occasionally mildly pleasant, occasionally mildly unpleasant.  And I am fully willing to concede that this may be a matter of taste (except for the occasional unbalanced dressings, and unripe avocado), but given Kai Zan's reputation I was quite surprised to be left with ""ok.""I would be inclined to bump up the rating given how nice they are and how superb the hospitality is, but I also have to think about price.  There are a lot of places in Chicago where you can have a mind-blowing evening for this kind of money.  I feel honor-bound to tell you that I do not think this is one of them."
"The service was great, but the fish is not. The premium Omagase never compares to the one from another restaurant in town Katsu. You can tell the chef has put a lot of efforts into decorating the dish, but again sashimi is more about how fresh the fish is rather then how the dish looks like. I would recommend if you are looking for a great dining experience but NOT if you are looking for great sashimi."
"The first time we tried to go to Kai Zan, we strolled in on a weekend night, but were told they were booked up with reservations all evening. Oh. Didn't realize that. We had dinner at a place across the street, and when I got home, I made reservations for a Saturday night at 7pm. We got there a few minutes early, so they offered us a seat to wait, and took a drink order. When I ordered my wine the bartender(?) told me it had a distinct taste, and offered to bring me a sample first. I tried it, liked it, and ordered a glass. A few minutes later, our seats at the sushi bar were ready. They warned me when they confirmed our reservation that that is where we might end up sitting, which is fine with us - it's fun to watch the chefs, and also, it's easier to have a conversation when sitting next to your dining companion instead of across the table. Everything we ordered came out promptly and was delicious. I had the green salad (I love ginger dressing), we shared the fried chicken (so tender), the calamari (it was good, I really liked the dipping sauce that came with it), the Char Siu (one of my husband's childhood favorites), the Fiesta Maki roll, the Green Monster roll (my favorite), and for dessert, the green tea ice cream, Lava Cake and Aebelskiver. Everything was delicious and the service was friendly and perfectly timed. And the prices were reasonable in my opinoin (for the quality of food and being in the city)."
"Honest review come here!!!! Best sushi in chicago!!!!!! Ever i mean eveeything is so good if u can get the chefs tasting if u cant ask the waiter n she will help u Go there n order this exactly for the best meal of ur life get the angry crab the orange rush the calamari, the escolar pears, the flaming tuna roll, the duck on a stick the uni but i forgot what its called comes with a qual egg n tunna n u make ur own rolls then get the black bean ice cream sounds weird ik but it is the best ice cream u will ever have trust me"
"My initial review removed a star only because of the service issue, but that issue has been addressed and resolved.  The owners quickly responded, acknowledged what happened, apologized, and offered to generously accommodate us on our next visit, which is all we could really ask for."
"I will always come back here. It was my second time at Kai Zan. As usual, the service was impeccable. Every staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgable in their foods. The dishes were incredible and I was very happy. My stomach was happy. What more is there to ask for? :)"
"I'm a huge fish and seafood snob because I'm from the east coast and used to a level of freshness often difficult to find in the Midwest. This place is spectacular. Everything is so fresh, innovative, and remarkably underrated. Chicago's best kept sushi secret. Puts bigger named places downtown in River north to shame. Get the deluxe tasting menu. Worth every penny."
"I took my girlfriend here for a special occasion.This was our first time here.Our server Arlene was wonderful in how she recommended all her favorite dishes to us since we didn't go for the omakase (chef's tasting menu). In a way she was giving us her tasting menu and did not disappoint! By far the star of the night was the escolar pearls.This dish had four bite size escolar nigiri lightly seared with a side of special ponzu sauce. Very light and refreshing. Just amazing!Everything she recommended was spot on. We ordered the angry crab  - spicy crab wrapped in fresh tuna, topped w/ tempura crunchWe each got one piece. The fatty tuna and spicy crab really go well together. Just divineorange rush - sushi scallops wrapped in salmon, lightly seared with a citrus glazeI would really recommend this too. Never knew salmon and scallops paired so well. Definitely you notice a theme where the dishes are great for one whole bite and the sushi is fresh and flavors really really go well togetherWe also got the following.Dynamite Mussels - better than the ones found in normal sushi restaurantsChar siu skewers - reminds me of the char siu found in ramen but so tenderhotate skewers - good scallopssalmon nigiri (super fresh)    At the end of the night she recommend this clam dashi that was not on the menu but definitely cleansed our palate. This officially became our favorite sushi restaurant!FYI:Make sure to get reservations before coming because its a small cozy place.Also it is byob but there is a 15 dollar cork feeif you have a party of 4 you get to sit in a cozy Japanese style enclosed table."
"As many of you know by now, when I travel, I do my best to explore the best in sushi from the area. Obviously, doing helps to expand the geographic reach of my blog, but it also paints a clear picture of different trends in the cuisine. Over time, I've noticed that while different cities may have a similar appetite for premium sushi restaurants, their style is far from the same. Take for example Seattle, where sustainable sushi is a key feature at Sushi Mishiko. Or in New York City, where traditional omakase (with famous sushi chefs) are what stands out at places like Ichimura or Nakazawa. Or in Miami, at Naoe (which I always find a way to sneak in to a blog post), which trumpets the fish flown in daily from Japan.In Chicago, I made a point to visit the strongly reviewed - and recently opened - Kai Zan. The style of Kai Zan is hard to describe, but for the purposes of this blog post, we'll refer to it as ""fusion"". It's not typical asian fusion however - it marries traditional omakase (think: nigiri and fresh fish unencumbered by excessive sauces or weird pairings) with tapas style small plates. There isn't breaded chicken or the like - everything is relatively similar to how it was caught, and everything is unique. The food is prepared strictly behind the sushi bar, where the grill and open concept kitchen meld perfectly into the sushi preparation area. The twin brothers who own the place both work behind the bar, and both try to make their presence known throughout your meal, which is what a customer always prefers from chef/owners. I tried to sample as diverse a menu as possible, while acquiescing to the server's suggestions. The maguro pearls were unique, almost like mini nigiri (pictured right). I also tried the Uni shooter, which was the only menu option that let me down on account of a bit too much citrus. I also self-selected a ""mini-omakase"" of a variety of nigiri. The highlights were the grilled scallop and grilled hamachi (pictured on my blog), but all sushi was prepared with generous cuts of fish, expertly sliced with no ""strings"" or hanging pieces. The rice was a bit cold for my tastes, but the desired texture was still there. Then again, the fact that this was my second dinner (once again, I promise I still fit through doorways) might have mangled my thoughts towards the end of the meal.The Atmosphere is laid back, but perfect for a romantic night out or (as I discovered) a lonely traveler. The staff is knowledgeable and more than willing to engage in conversation on sushi or anything else. Most importantly, the dishes that my server recommended hit​. Big time. Kai Zan was recommended to me by some kind souls on Instagram. I will happily pay it forward  - this place is not only a must-visit, but will likely be on the Michelin guide's radar moving forward. I can certainly see the ""fusion"" of traditional sushi and measured improvements being a staple in other cities in the near future. ​Highly recommended."
"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been covered by the countless other super fans below? For me, like the rest, it was a phenomenal dining experience--really, one of the best in Chicago. However, beyond the incredible flavors and presentation, it was the staff at Kai Zan made our visit truly memorable. It's worth recognizing. My husband and I were married at the courthouse the afternoon before our reservation, and although I made very brief mention of this during the reservation call, the staff took GREAT care to make us feel celebrated and special. The hostess and staff immediately, loudly congratulated us upon walking in, as did one of the head chefs. Half way through the Omakase, he enquired about the meal, gave us his best wishes table side and even threw in free dessert! Anyway, cynical readers may suspect that the aforementioned, borderline cloying sweetness of the staff may have colored my sensory experience. Fine. All you have to do is scroll down the page if you need further proof. Besides, this level of hospitality at other hip Chicago restaurants is nearly nonexistent (despite the fact that it costs the venue nothing and is so appreciated by clientele), so I don't mind gushing over it a bit. I love this place, it's extraordinary. I'll be back again and again."
"Each of the stars above represents 2 stars, because this place deserves 10!!! Simply blown away by the omakase -- the variety, the balance of flavors, the sheer amount, the quality of the ingredients, and of course the price. Excellent marriage between traditional Japanese and Western influences. Service was top notch too, servers very knowledgeable about the dishes and very considerate. I almost want to keep this to myself so I can still get a reservation easily!"
"Best sushi I've had in Chicago!  Amazing experience--the waitress was fantastic, the presentation was beautiful--and the food simply amazing!We did the tasting menu ($60pp) and so-so-so happy we did.  We were stuffed, and got to try the best of the best.  This is a MUST go!"
"Nice sushi place that has a $60 prix fix menu , and regular menus, but has 2 items that are well worth it. I think the snapper piece is a real good item but the name escapes me (it's the second plate that comes out) and the blue crush of tuna is also good. Perhaps just order these and save money. And grab a burger after. My biggest dislike is the use of mayonnaise (aka Chipoltle sauce or spicy mayo) in almost every dish. I think the fish could stand without this crutch."
"Sixty dollar omakase?! Yes, please! If you're not familiar with the term ""omakase,"" it basically means you're leaving it up to the chef to decide what you'll be eating. Definitely not recommended if you're a picky eater, especially when it comes to seafood. The omakase special included at least 10 assorted dishes, all of which were delicious. Overall, Kai Zan exceeded my expectations. I didn't think the quality of the dishes would be good (the price is pretty cheap for the quality of seafood you're getting). I also didn't think I would leave full (again, the price is cheap for the quantity of food). I left the restaurant very pleased (and extremely full) and can honestly say this was one of the best sushi experiences I've ever had. The restaurant is really nice and the staff were all friendly and attentive. I would definitely come back for the omakase."
"Oh man, I thought I wrote a review for this place. So so good. I'm not even the biggest sushi fan but I loved going here. We for sure splurged, not a cheap meal, but worth it. I enjoyed everything that was brought out and ordered. The orange rush and angry crab were my two favorites. BYOB, great for date night or double date night. We were waiting a tad for a table and they brought out free food for us, which was so nice and not expected. The service was perfect and they gave great recs to me as a newbie. Cannot wait to go back and splurge again."
"What a delightful, intimate BYOB!  I love the warm, welcoming ambiance, and appreciate the privacy of the separate booths.  The decor and food presentation were impressive.We were tempted to try the omakase, which was highly recommended for first-time visitors because it samples from the various parts of the menu, but we decided to focus on the sashimi with a few sides.  Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations, especially when I found myself deciding between two items.  All of her recommendations were spot-on.For starters, we tried the delicious escolar pearls and the tasty angry crab sushi.  For sashimi, we had the crab stick, yellowtail, sea bass, salmon, and shrimp.  All of the pieces were super fresh.  We ended with the grilled skewers, which were my least favorite part of the meal (still good, but not memorable).  Hubby tried the shitake ponzu and I tried the shrimp negi mayo grilled skewer.  I liked how there was an actual variety of choices for dessert, which is not common in Japanese restaurants.  I wanted to try more than one, but settled on the mango pudding.  It was not too heavy, just right in richness, and topped with fresh whipped cream and berries.  The perfect way to end a perfect meal."
"This place is spectacular.I went on a Saturday night with my brother (I know, awkward) and we had an early reservation - 5:15 p.m. You will absolutely need a reservation on a weekend ... I made our reservation the Thursday before, and my options were 5:15 and 9:30. But honestly, I totally get why. The food was delicious, the service was super courteous, and the ambiance was so charming. We both ordered the chef's special for $60 per person. I am somewhat cheap, and I still thought this was so worth it. 10 ""courses""/plates, and the selection was awesome. Every single plate was delicious and beautifully plated.Worth noting: Come with a somewhat adventurous spirit. This isn't really a typical sushi place. But everything is soooo delicious. You will NOT miss the average Philly role. Also, they serve beer, wine, and saki now. They still do BYOB as far as I know, but I believe they charge a $15 corking fee. Boo. But I still loved it! Our waiter recommended an awesome saki and it made our dinner extra delicious."
"The first thing you notice when walking in is the small but great atmosphere. The building can be hard to spot but that is all negative I can say about this place .We opted like many other people on here and went with the omakase and it will well worth it . The 10 course deliver some of the most amazing bites of food I have ever tasted. There were several times I had to stop and think to myself I was eating fish as the taste was nothing like any other sushi I have eaten . The staff was very friendly and brought the food out at the right times. We did have reservations, which I would recommend as even on Tuesday it was packed .Overall this was one of the best meals I have had and by far best sushi I have eaten . I will be back next time I am in Chicago ."
"From the outside it looks nondescript.   In fact, I thought I had the wrong place, because there is a sign that says ""Tattoos"" in the window.We ordered the Omikase tasting for the four of us.  I can't even remember how many courses there were... but each course... each different delicacy was better and more imaginative than the last.The flavours and presentations were fabulous.  The service was excellent, and the atmosphere was lovely and pleasant.  I can't say enough nice things about this place.  I will, indeed, be back.My favourite piece of sushi, during the entire tasting, was something called ""Angry Crab"", which was topped with a piece of Uni.Yuuu-uuummm."
"3 months ago I made reservations for two and asked my sister to join me for our first dining experience here.  We came here and was seated within 5 minutes for our late reservation.  I was really expecting the typical sushi restaurant with crazy speciality maki rolls that would include every condiment available to mankind plus the fish of their choosing.  I browsed through their minimal menu and was surprised to find the limited options to choose from.  However, to keep things simple we both order the $60 Omakase tasting menu.  The drink of choice was the Irritated Koala - a black tea beer.  Loved it.This specific menu will give you a taste of everything that they currently offer - from sushi, sashimi, soup, and cooked options.  I won't go into details as I'm sure other reviewers have already told you how great everything is.  Do know this... their raw serving (sushi and sashimi) was freakin' amazing.  Served with the perfect pairing of flavors, and a perfect balance of soy to smokiness.  Though their cooked food options still need some improvements, but the fact that they were able to ""WOW"" me with everything else made their 5-star rating well deserved.I do recommend anyone coming here for the first time to try the Omakase just so you can taste everything and decipher what food you like and dislike from their menu, so that your second experience can be much more enjoyable.  I've been to Kai Zan 3 more times since my initial visit 3 months ago.  My second visit I ordered everything ala carte (specials, sushi, and sashimi) and it was even better than I remembered.After leaving our first visit, my sister and I both felt that it was quite possibly one of the best meals we've had in Chicago.  How did we not find this place sooner?"
"This was our first visit to Kai Zan.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars if that were an option.  We went for my husbands birthday and they were quite helpful in assisting me in pulling off a surprise for him :) I really appreciated that.  It did bother me that knowing this dinner was for my husbands 30th birthday, they say us at the sushi bar instead of one of the booths.  The restaurant seemed romantic, unless you are seated at the sushi bar :-/We went specifically for the sushi.  The special sushi roll options were very limited, however, they are able to make any traditional sushi roll you like.  The price was a little on the pricey side, for the portions.The food they do have/ that we tried was pretty amazing.  Can't complain about the quality of the food at all :)My husband says it's the best sushi he's had in Chicago, so far.The service was also fantastic."
"Came back here yesterday and this place is my hands down favorite restaurant in the city but please don't share with too many people!  I ordered their new omakase menu (12 course for $90) and it was amazing.  They still are offering the old one as well because people love it.  I will only share a few of my favorites dishes but one was the Eskimo cloud, the seared lobster and scallop nigiri, and the salmon skin (think of a chicharone) topped with toro tartar.  I hope this review doesn't encourage anyone to go because I still want to be able to get a rezzy."
"Hands down the best sushi I've ever had. Every single thing I've tasted has been delicious - escolar pearls, angry crab, orange rush, and green monster being some of my favorites.My only gripe is the location - it is pretty far from where I live, wish it was closer to Lakeview!"
"I only came once and we did the tasting menu which was such a great deal for the amount of food you got for the price point. I'd say only one of the dishes failed (soup was way to fishy) but great presentation, variety and quantity to be well worth another trip.Next time I'd try some items not on the tasting menu but if its your first time, its a great way to explore their menu."
"This was great. We came in, sat down, ordered the tasting menu, and was done in about 30 minutes. The food was well prepared, had great presentation, and tasted as good as it was fresh. Only downside (surprisingly) was the speed of the service - it was too fast! I want to enjoy my dining experience, and sometimes time in between courses is actually a good thing. Otherwise, conversations keep getting interrupted by the food, and the experience just isn't the same. At one point, a dish was brought out even before my companion was done with the first dish!"
"Went there for a dinner before Christmas holiday! First impressions, I would say that the place is as small as it gets for a restaurant, heard that they could only fit about 22 seats. You barely have space to walk around (that is if you ever need to). The place isn't decorated like your typical sushi bar, because it isn't one. Kai Zan is more of a fusion sushi place, I don't think people who hate fusion sushi places would be fond of this place much. Although, it is not the typical fusion sushi either, where all their dishes are carefully made with great ingredients that go well together that are not things like stupid cream cheese or spicy mayo.All I hear about this place is its Omakase. The fact that I was there the first time and didn't want to bother looking at the menu much or take time to think my order through because everything sounds delicious leaned me towards ordering the Omakase. This way, I would be able to taste the best of the menu that the Chef wants to offer his diners. Overall food was great, everything had great balance to it. There's about 10 courses, so you don't really have to order anything else. I would say all their dishes are upscale fusion sushi, which is definitely what people who are a fan of sushi and want to explore somewhere else without leaving the traditional mindset."
Amazing sushi!  We got the tasting menu!  Very impressed with the quality of the seafood and the taste of the sushi without much of soy sauce over powering the freshness.  Probably one of the best sushi I've had in the US.
Amazing little sushi spot!
"I love this place!! I go here about once a month and it never disappoints. A couple things that I recommend you order:Uni, uni, and some more uniAngry crab= deliciosoEscolar Pearls: if you live super white tuna this is a must!!Escolar wrapped oysters with ponzu foam: I'm not a fan of oysters but theses were good.Try I nab a seat at the sushi bar. The chefs are great and super friendly"
"This place is amazing.  I had been wanting to try to for a long time, it was worth the wait.  My boyfriend and I opted for the Chef's menu and it was outstanding.  Definitely worth the price, some of the best quality fish I've ever had.  Each course offered something adventurous yet approachable.  Our waiter was knowledgable and the presentation of every course came with a detailed explanation was what was being served.  They now serve wine, beer and saki and BYOB is still an option but it comes with a $15 corkage fee."
"Best tasting and most creative sushi I've had in Chicago. Unagi shooters and black sesame ice cream lava cake are a must, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."
Kai Zan has amazing food and service.  Make your reservation early and come ready to enjoy the experience!
"This is in my Top 3 sushi restaurants in Chicago.Very fresh and delicious! Presentation is beautiful. Staff is efficient, though slightly stoic. Doesn't seem to be any more or less expensive than what typifies the genera.I was intrigued by the quail egg shooters.Word of caution: this place is very small, even with the recent expansion. MAKE A RESERVATION, or don't complain about how long you wait -or how nonplussed the staff is about fitting you in."
"We each ordered the chef's Selection Omakase and afterward got the Flaming Tuna, Green monster, and a mochi dessert. The service was impeccable in all aspects and the food has me reconsidering all the five star reviews I've given to sushi places in the past."
Love the uni here. Always fresh. The uni toro taretare is a must. Escolar pearls are also awesome here. My only complaint is that they recently added a corkage charge without giving notice. I would have opted out the $15 corkage and ordered their providing alcohol instead if i knew.
"Went here for my birthday dinner based on the awesome reviews and we were not as impressed.  It was difficult to find the restaurant since the windows advertise tattoos.  When I finally spotted it, parking was easy to find.We had a reservation and were seated immediately.  However, I was disappointed we were seated at the bar. But, the restaurant is BYOB so we popped open a bottle and began to drink (after paying  $5 corkage fee per bottle).We decided against the Chef's Choice meal.  It sounded like too much food and there were some courses I did not like.  So we ordered individual items.  All of the food was delicious and fresh.  I did not eat anything I did not like.I am still bitter that they crammed us into the bar when we had a reservation and it was my birthday.  There were some cozy looking tables and I was envious."
We both ordered the 10 course Omakase market price. It was fantastic. I'm too tired and full of awesome food to remember all the dishes perfectly but will focus on the highlights. All of the fish was superb. Stated. Second course was bar none my favorite- an oaky smoked mackerel served in a cold liquid nitrogen smoking granite bowl thing. K. Other things of note: a 'cappuccino' style broth dish- foamed top that you sip with shaved truffle-  with 3 small neck clams in the bottom- yay! The wagyu beef was buttery melty (I'm not a big beef person and it was nice). Fatty tuna surfaced a few times in the courses (nigiri and sashimi) can't go wrong there. The sea urchin came out served between tempura sesame leaves which I had never had before- like a little labia it tasted weirdly like the ocean as it should. Edible flowers throughout. Oh! and they ferment their wasabi and serve coarsely chopped in a saucy consistency rather than as a paste- lovely. Many complicated broths and sauces. We loved it.
Food was out of this world fantastic!  The flavors and textures of the sushi were more intense with each plate.  The servers were incredibly professional and knowledgeable. The chef/owners were very welcoming.  The whole experience made me realize I need to eat here more
"Sushi enamored foodies..........your search for divine perfection is over.  Kai Zan is here and it better be here to stay.  Kai Zan is magnificent.  Kai Zan is an addiction.  You won't be able to stop yourself from wanting to go back.     I was in love with this gem of a place before I even got there.  I mostly got Claudia to thank plus the abundance of rousing yelp reviews.  I had questions for the restaurant and wanted to see their drink menu which isn't posted.  The restaurant's phone system wasn't working so I contacted them via e-mail.  Claudia answered all my questions promptly and sent me the drink menu.  We originally had a 9:30 pm seating through Yelp SeatMe and I really wanted something a bit earlier. She was fabulous enough to email me and let me know a  8:15 pm reservation was available.  Talk about top-notch service; it really makes all the difference.The restaurant is still tiny but I heard had expanded recently.  We got one of those prime seats right next to the bar and cooking station where the sushi twins were hard at work.  Best seats in the house!Two words - Omakase menu.  This is a 12 course chef's tasting menu for $60/pp.  If sushi is a meaningful aspect of your foodie life, what's the point in looking elsewhere?  Well, maybe there's just one more option.  Allan, our server says there's a brand new tasting menu that offers a higher level of sushi experience and costs $100/person for 11 courses.  I decide to hold off on this until next time.  Let's face it; there will be a next time.  Plus, that's pretty pricey.My husband graciously accompanied me although he doesn't eat sushi.  So, he stuck with the ""cooked"" portion of the menu.  I will normally try everything he eats but I was so mesmerized with Omakase that I paid little attention to what he got.  I know he got beef steak and really enjoyed it.The Omakase was spectacular.  No words will truly do the menu justice.  There was fish galore.  There was carpaccio, maguro, tuna, oyster shooter with a zing that you slurp up, out of this world angry crab, more tuna, fish cloaked in avocado that literally melts in your mouth, salmon, scallops, octopus, shrimp tempura, roe toppings and an awesome soup.  There was more but I don't remember it all.  Last course was a platter of sashimi to die for.  In all, truly a roller coaster ride.  I was trying to jot down notes but couldn't keep up.  The fish was so fresh, there were many different and unique flavors, some topped with mayo and accompanied by wasabi for the kick.  Good sushi is never cheap and $60 is a great price for what you get.     At one point my husband says - ""That's a lot of fish"".  As in - ""Are you really going to eat all that?""  Oh heck yah it was a decent amount of fish and I ate every single last piece.They even serve the most wonderful version of soy sauce.  Not sure quite what's in it but I made it my mission to find enough food to soak it in.  I probably would have drank the left-over sauce if it came down to it.The restaurant started off as just BYO but they now serve wine and sake.  They don't however advertise their drink menu as you cannot find it on their website.  The BYO option is now $15/table.  I'm a firm believer that drinking anything but sake with sushi is a sin.  Allan's first recommendation was for us to try the ""wandering poet"" junmai ginjo and I couldn't agree more.  This happened to be the first pouring by sommelier Jill Gubesch at our Topolo dinner and is an outstanding sake.  Most of the sake is offered as 300 ml size options with around four offerings in the 720 ml size.  Sake tends to have a higher alcohol content than wine; we therefore opted for the 300 ml option.  About halfway through the meal, we went with ""bride of the fox""; another junmai ginjo.  Spectacular and once again an incredible smooth finish that was a flawless accompany to the food.We both wanted dessert and selected the homemade cheesecake and lava cake.  Both were delicious; portions were small which was perfect.  The lava cake was topped with sesame ice cream and was uniquely delectable, satisfying, without being extremely filling.Even the ambiance is sheer perfection.  The restaurant is small and intimate.  It works for couples that want to hang out or friends that want to get together.  It works for date night.  It works for girls night out.  It seriously works for any occasion.  The menu is a bit rushed but I do not hold this against the restaurant.  My preference would have been to spend double the time I was there as I like time between courses.  Their website states that parties of 2 are limited to 90 minutes of dining time as they are a small restaurant and there is high demand.  Guess I can live with that. Hey Michelin, time to give a sushi place in Chi-Town a couple of nods."
"Having moved from Hawaii recently and hearing all the good things about this place and their omakase menu made me super excited since it's literally 3 blocks from my house.  This place has really good items on the menu, but *do not* order the $60 per person omakase menu.  Based on my experience of omakase style in Hawaii, you get chef special sushi style courses.  Here, its 10 courses, but only 4 of the courses were actually sushi.  One of the courses was an octopus soup in a tiny cup, that was a slight upgrade over powdered miso soup only because there was octopus in it.  I'm actually not kidding.  I would say that at least 3 of the courses were actually cooked fish, and most of the courses were very heavy on the tuna.  I love tuna, but I'm looking for different types of flavors if I'm doing omakase - uni, unagi, etc.  Towards course 7, I actually told the waiter that we would really like sushi / sashimi, and he said ""good news, the last course is all sashimi"".  Maybe I'm spoiled having the opportunity to experience omakase style in Hawaii, but I really don't think that for $60 a person that this is good value.  I'd rather order what I want and spend the equivalent of $120 (for two) on exactly the fish that I would like to eat.  We did a menu calculation, and for $120, you can basically sample everything on their specialty menu.  Do this if you plan to spend $120!  Omakase should never include octopus soup in a shot glass and a seaweed salad with squid.  I would say 4 of 10 of the courses were up to par and delicious.Also, the $15 corking fee is a bit high I think.  They said this is new because now they have a liquor license for wine and beer.  I think when you are paying $120, its a bit high to pay $15 to uncork your own bottle of wine just because they now have a liquor license.  Feels greedy.Even though I'm giving this place 3 stars, I think if you stick to the menu and order what you want, you will be happy.  Just stay away from omakase style if you know what you are doing.I took a friend out for their birthday, and they overheard this and did bring us two deserts on the house.  They also  threw in an uni roll on the house because they could tell we weren't exactly thrilled with the omakase choice.  These were both very nice gestures that made everything more worthwhile, but I won't ever be doing ""chef's choice"" again."
This really is as good as sushi gets.  Every item we received had us wanting our incredibly knowledgeable server to just funnel down our throat.  I think I even heard someone ask if it would be acceptable to butt funnel oyster shooters if he ran out of room in his stomach.  Really.  I think I heard someone say that.
"Bottom line:  If you love sushi.  If you're a foodie.  This place.Full story:9.24.12I had read good things about this place.  Turns out they're all true.  We sat at the bar, essentially table number six.  I know this because whenever the chef called out 'Six!' we got a plate of food.  Also, there were only five tables.  KZ is intimate and lovely.  Total date place.As you will read (if you do any research), KZ doesn't Americanize the sushi with cream cheese and fries.  And whether or not pearls (rice spheres) exist in Japan, my wife and I dug them.  We got the escolar pearls because EVERYTHING I read said to try them - AWESOME.  We also got the green monster and flaming tuna rolls - GREAT.  And the enoki bacon from the kushi-lava rock char-boil - SO GOOD WE ORDERED ANOTHER ONE.  The special sushi was white tuna belly which they made into pearls for us - MAGNIFICENT.  All in all, it was a wonderful experience/meal, and I hesitate to write a review at all because I'd rather everyone NOT know how great this place is, but credit where credit's due.  It was AWESOME.Next time we'll probably try the omakase menu, because I know there will be a next time...PS.  Also, the service was great.* Addendum 10.20.12 Hmmm, next time didn't work out so well...  I've taken off a couple stars because when we went in for our 9pm reservation, they didn't have our reservation.  'Um, what?'  I'm sure it was a simple error, but when it's Saturday night at 9pm and you're starving and you've been waiting all day and you're excited to introduce your friends to a great new restaurant - it's um, VERY disappointing to say the least.  #uncool.  I'm sure we will try again and perhaps then I will put the stars back, but this last experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  I advise confirming your confirmation.(KZ isn't set up for opentable.)* Addendum 7.24.14SO this was a meal long in the making...  Long story less complicated (being that you've read this far), more than a year ago Kai Zan wrote to me after I yelped about the lost reservation.  They apologized and offered me an omakase menu to make things right.  I didn't see this until a month ago.  I thanked them for reaching out.  But here's the thing; they said the offer was still good.  Whuh?!  So I went last night with my wife.We had a nice table for two against the wall near the sushi bar.  (They've expanded, there are now more than five tables.)  We ordered a sake, and explained how my wife was allergic to scallops.Bring on the omakase...The omakase is the Chef's tasting menu; sorta like a sushi roller coaster mixed with a log ride of other culinary wonderment. In other words, I cannot tell you exactly what I ate, but it was an awesome ride.  To start, it ALL looked like Top Chef.  Everything was beautiful and meant to impress the judges.  Some bites worked my palette more than others.  There was one thing - maybe it was called Angry Crab - it was a total OMG bite.  We had a shooter with an oyster, there was one with a quail's egg.  We had sashimi, sushi, rolls, soup.  There was pork belly, shrimp, mushrooms, I don't even know what else.  It was familiar, but unlike anything I've ever had.  The final tray was a selection of sashimis.  Before I could say anything, the waiter asked if we wanted soy sauce - because up until then I'm sure soy sauce would have been wrong; sorta like ordering a dry aged medium rare prime rib, receiving it au jus on a hot plate, and then asking for ketchup. I'm not qualified to discuss or accurately describe the various flavor profiles that danced across my tongue.  All I can tell you is that it was a delightful and delicious experience; the likes of which if you enjoy sushi or consider yourself a foodie - Kai Zan.  It is everything you've read/heard.PS.  The service was exceptional.  There were so many courses, I think we were presented by each person working there.  They were all able to walk us through the different dishes; the takeaway being that the restaurant worked together as a team.PPS.  Yes, it's a nice little story, but Kai Zan is a true treasure.  I'm very happy to add back the stars.  Bonus:  To bring it all full circle, you can now make reservations for Kai Zan through Yelp."
"You don't come to Kai Zan just to fill your belly, you come to Kai Zan for an experience! This is by far the best Japanese restaurant in the city. Every item on the menu is carefully thought out and then crafted to perfection. Kai Zan is not your ordinary sushi restaurant. Menu items are innovative, unique and with a twist. The quality of the fish is nothing short than perfection and if you sit at the sushi bar you can get a first hand glimpse of magic in the making. The restaurant itself is quaint and cozy perfect for a romantic evening or to celebrate with friends. My husband and I really enjoy sitting at the bar just as much as anywhere else in the restaurant. I really can't say enough good things about Kai Zan. If you are thinking about trying it I would definitely recommend it. Make reservations in advance though, this place fills up quick and once you dine here you will see why."
Brilliant food. Really creative bent to sushi. Just the most amazing taste sensations. Don't be put off by front desks attitude on the phone or when you arrive.
"OMG. Best sushi restaurant I have ever been to in my 62 years.  We had the Chef Special Omakase.  Unbelievable.  It changes, but want you to read what we had.  Zuke salmon, Lamp pop, Chawan Mush which was a soup, Otoro, Lobster & Scallop nigiri, Kani Tsunomono, Otoro Shira Koji with cubed heirloom tomatoes and edible flowers, Aji and Whole Fried Horse Mackerel with sashimi, Otoro, Sake belly, & Hamachi bely, LIVE green and yellow Scallops, Gunkan Maki avocado and corn, and last Kushiro Oyster with Ankimo. Every flavor was different and great.The service was impeccable.  The explanations of the sushi items were very helpful.  If you can go, save up, it is worth it."
"Some of the best sushi I have had! Very inventive without being too saucy, fried etc. VERY fresh fish.  BYOB!! Logistics:  TS A VERY SMALL RESTURANT! Maybe 7 tables, but' they are expanding. They sat me, my brother and his wife at a 2 person table. well that wasnt going to work. They kindly let us sit in the new room which wasnt quite finished, but it was SO much better. Great service.Food: We opted for the $50 tasting menu. So much food for the price. It is a totally reasonable pre fixe. Favorites: angry crab, pearls, shooters, tempura jalepeno, mussels"
This place is outstanding. I'm speechless. I went here last night for my birthday. I am an avid sushi goer and this place blew my mind. I didn't even need soy sauce... The freshest seafood I've ever experienced. This a family owned establishment and they work very hard to provide a wonderful ambiance and dinning experience.... Which really doesn't even matter considering how wonderful the food is. Best sushi I've ever had.
"If I told you that you could get a 10 course meal that would both include some of the best sushi I've had in Chicago AND it would be filling, how much would you expect to pay? $100? $150? So you can expect my surprise when I realized that their 10 course omakase was only $60 a head. Here's how the meal went:When we were first seated, I was a little disappointed by how long it took a server to come by and help us out. But other than this hiccup, everything else went perfectly smoothly. We put our orders in and were soon served with... (some of these names are real. Some of these names are names I made up based on what I remember)- Madai Carpaccio - A great start to the meal. A soft but flavorful fish with hints of cilantro.- Tuna and Escolar - Just some great pieces of sushi that have a little more fat than the previous fish.- Oyster and Scallop + Uni shooters - One of my favorite dishes of the night. Both were rather slimy as they were topped with an egg but the flavor was unbelievable. Some of the best oysters and uni I've had.- Angry Crab - This is basically a crab roll wrapped in some delicious tuna. Just imagine the best crab roll you've had and know it's better than that.- Tunatini - This was a rather disappointing dish. It was basically a sashimi salad but the ingredients didn't really work well together. But all the ingredients were all very fresh.- Tuna Dashi - Favorite dish #2. A small piece of tuna on a skewer is placed inside a mushroom dashi (soup) and while the tuna is still on par with all the other fish I've been eating, the dashi was the star. The dashi was packed with flavor but it wasn't heavy. It was refreshing and clean and was one of the best soups I've ever had.- Shrimp, Crab Cake, Pork Belly, Octopus - I thought these were the last 4 dishes of the night but instead, they ended up being one dish. My favorite part was the pork belly. Soft, perfectly spiced but with a crispy exterior. The worst part was the greens the pork belly was placed on. Way too salty. Also the octopus was slightly too tart for my liking.- Mussel - Honestly, I don't even remember it because it came with the previous dish. But I'm pretty sure it was good.- Tuna/Salmon Roll - Another roll with tender, full-flavored fish.- Assorted Sashimi - A crazy way to end the night. I was barely able to finish this because I was so full but because the quality was so good, I got through it.TLDR: Go get the omakase. You won't be disappointed."
"I have been looking forward to eating here for a while and was seriously disappointed to the point that I have to write this review and can't even see myself giving the restaurant a second chance. Some of the food was delicious (seared hamachi, escolar pearls), some was good but way overpriced (beef skewer) and some was short of decent and still way overpriced (scallop skewer and mussels). The main problem is the abysmal service. Having been a server I am sensitive to basic server issues like a busy kitchen, a forgotten order or just a bad night. Words cannot describe just how much the awful service soured my experience at this restaurant. Our server seemed really put-upon to even be there, not to mention forgetting part of our order and not offering drinks. He really just made me feel icky for having spent $100 and feeling like I owed him something. The food is NOT worth the cost or service. Stay away."
"Its been almost two years now that I've been frequenting Kai Zan. From opening week. During the doldrums of winter. Back through Spring. During a renovation. And all times in between. Nothing has kept me from my frequent visits to the gracious owners, my buddies (and bros), Melvin and Carlo.A piece of uni usually arrives somewhere between 5 and 7 minutes post-arrival. Then another special uni-laden handroll lands mid-meal. And again, uni, right before I leave. I'm pretty sure even 2 years later, they still think my name is just ""Uni Girl.""The service is spot on. The fish is even better. With so much more to boast than just uni, the menu sings with originality, freshness, restraint and flavor. There is nothing better in Chicago. Nothing. Not Katsu. Not Arami. Not Toro. Nothing. I desire not to eat sushi anywhere else. I've even held off for almost two years writing this review in the hopes of keeping Kai Zan my little secret. But Chicago Magazine, Eater, Zagat, Time Out and Michelin foiled that plan. Secret's out. Kai Zan is everything."
"Cute, hidden place that I could not find until I followed the building numbers. It's tiny! With very limited seating. Good idea to make reservations, I got lucky and they were able to seat us. Cool things: BYOB! With 5 dollar corkage fee. And every month they have a new list of chef specials.Yummy things: Yep go for the Escolar pearls like everyone mentions. The Angry Crab roll was probably the best of the night... but it only comes in 2 pieces. It left me wanting more. Skip the Green Monster Roll. It was very mushy and avocado-y."
"The Kai Zan experience is one of the best restaurant experiences possible, easily the best sushi in Chicago, arguably the best sushi in the United States.  I make it a point to come here as often as possible and bring as many out-of-towners as possible.  The food is absurdly good, the very definition of the word umami.  The food is as tasty (braised pork belly skewer) as it is unique (salmon-wrapped scallop).  A fantastic balance is achieved between allowing the ingredients to shine, and pushing and tweaking them with the grill, various sauces, and original combinations.Must try dishes include: Angry Crab, Orange Rush, Grilled Hamachi Nigiri, Grilled Scallop Nigiri, Flaming Tuna, Green Monster, Madai Carpaccio (basil misto?!?!?), Momo Skewer, Tako Skewer, Kamo Skewer, Hotate Skewer, Char Siu Skewer, King Oyster Mushroom Skewer.  It is also quite important to listen to the specials as there are some fantastic gems in there as well.  Recent specials have included Otoro tuna, the highest grade of tuna belly.  (The Otoro was absurd)The vibe at Kai Zan is one of relaxation and serenity, dare I be cliché and call it zen-like.  Isolated booths are available for larger parties.  The wait staff is kind and respectful, but also distant enough where one can feel privacy and intimacy.  The one time we had to wait for a reserved table, the chefs were kind enough to give us a freebie snack (an absurd escolar lollipop).  I don't actually have anything negative to say about Kai Zan.  Go there.Grade: A+"
"Food here was pretty good.  It is also more pricey than most other sushi restaurants but I wanted to stray from norm and it was worth it.  Also your dining time is limited but they let you know that upfront.  The crowd reflects this as well as you will not find loud obnoxious BYOB Riff raff here.  Big plus in my book.  We had the omakase and many other dishes but can't remember them all.  I like the fact that they keep the spicy mayo, wasabi mayo, unagi sauce and shrimp tempura to a minimum if not none!  High five!!!   Dynamite, escolar pearls, scallop/oyster shooter and lobster nigiri were all standouts.  Nigiri and sashimi were both very fresh, kudos!!!If you know sushi, if you like sushi, if you're sick of maki's(despite what many Chicagoans think, makimonos w bunch cooked stuff and heavy sauce is NOT sushi) come here ready to spend and you will have great evening.  My hats off and respect to the sushi twins!"
"If you want a pretentious location with terrible service, then this is your spot. I was really looking forward to this place. I made reservations weeks in advance since it had all these great reviews, and they kept calling me to confirm telling me that we may have to sit at the bar because the restaurant may be full. We got there and the place was empty. The entire time we were there, it never filled up. The fuzzy long haired guy who served us...(Hawk...I believe was his name) set a vibe so terrible I almost wanted to get up and walk out. I asked a question about the menu and he just gave the biggest attitude and immediately discouraged us from ordering the sushi...why? Because its cheaper?We ordered the SOS...we wanted one to try and he discouraged us again saying we couldn't share it, so we got two. Why do you have a bite sized anything on your menu that I can't share? We ordered two though and umm, I would have preferred to share that one. Once I got it, it was missing ingredients and the fried salmon skin was cold. Ok...no big deal until that rubberband mistake of nasty cold calamari came. Did I order rubberbands or food??? So upon returning that, the pork belly skewer came out. It was okay, but by no means stellar. The one thing I enjoyed was the Green Monster roll. It was really good but I can get that at any sushi place with much better food and service, and actually leave full. I have never been to a restaurant where my waitor was so rude! I will always tip, but not this guy. I looked for the bus boy to tip him but he was M.I.A. upon leaving....probably because he was doing his job. The busser literally served us the entire time while Mr. Rude sat in a corner and crawled past us...never asking if we needed anything, enjoyed the meal...nothing...just wanted to raise the bill for his tip. I'll save that tip for someone who actually has people skills...this is right down there with Yusho, but worse. At least Yusho has great servers... But you have to ask yourself with these small plates places... is it about the small plates or just about being pretentious?!? There are lots of great small plates out there for decent prices...this is NOT one of them. If you want great sushi, go to Enso. Great place, great food, priced right, delicious and the service is wonderful, AND they don't litter with cheap throw away chop sticks when charging good money for food!"
"Short review: Go here. Ask for Arlene. Let her take care of you. Seriously, just do what she tells you.Longer review: Omakase is worth double what they charge. The uni was so good we couldn't stop eating it the day we were there. Just don't be afraid and eat anything they bring. The red snapper sashimi was superb. Can't rave enough."
"If someone says ""sushi"" and the first thing that comes to your mind is ""California roll"", I am not sure if I should tell you to run to Kai Zan or avoid it like the plague. There is a lot more to sushi/Japanese food than the Americanized cream cheese and/or mayonnaise concoctions. If you are open-minded, Kai Zan is the place for you. If not (or, just not so much), you can still find plenty to eat here, but I think you'd be missing out.  At the very least, I think everyone should come here and try at least one thing out of the box. You owe it to yourself.As such, I tried a few things outside my normal Japanese wheelhouse (wheelpagoda?), and was glad I did - not just in that I had some semblance of an adventurous spirit, but because it was all really good. For some normalcy, my DC and I had a flaming tuna roll, and eel/cucumber roll, tamago, shishito peppers, and mussels. Exploration involved hamachi collar, oyster and uni shooters (not entirely weird I know, but I'd never had either, and these had quail eggs in them - definitely not your normal shooters), and seared tongue. Yeah, I ate a cow's tongue. Never saw that one coming. DC told me it has the taste/texture of pot roast. DC was correct. Still...I can't believe what I put in my mouth. That's what *she* said. Oh, how I miss Michael Scott. At least when ""The Office"" was funny.Remember - you owe it to yourself."
"The chef's playground omakase was a great selection. The service was attentive and food fresh, inspired and absolutely delicious."
"I came to Kai Zan to celebrate my husbands birthday with another couple and had an amazing time. Granted, we are all sushi snobs and we usually stick to what we love which is Coast and Toro in Chicago but after all the hype and great reviews of this place, I decided to check it out. I made reservations like a few weeks in advance which apparently wasn't enough to land us the golden table. By ""golden table"" I mean those private four to six people booths. Now, those look freaking fantastic. When we came in around 8pm on a Saturday night, I kindly asked how long would the wait be for one of those fancy little private areas and the hostess up front told me about an hour. We didn't want to wait that long and just settled for our table. It wasn't too bad, by the window overlooking the bar, so we got to see all the action. I absolutely loved the decor and atmosphere here, perhaps more than Coast and Toro combined, it was sheek, but not overly done, not too loud and the wooden tables gave it that rustic feel which you don't usually get at these sushi places, it had that upscale feel without overwhelming prices. Okay, so now onto the important stuff, the goodies. We started with the dynamite mussels and Oh em gee were those amazing. You definitely need to try those, they are a tad spicy and comes six for $12. Definitely a great start to your meal. What I didn't like is that your sushi doesn't come out all at once, it comes out as it's ready. Having said that, they mixed up a few of our rolls adding avocado instead of cucumber and forgot to bring the green monster roll for my friend. But the server made up for it later on by giving us all dessert on the house since we had to wait a little longer than most people and some of the rolls were wrong. Anyways, we got the angry crab, made with fresh tuna, spicy crab with chef's togarashi. It was delicious and also comes in a hand roll version for $9. We seriously got three of those by the end of the night. Then my husband got what I believe is the fiesta roll with plenty of fresh fish which he seemed to enjoy, don't quote me on the name though and it's not on the website. We also got a bunch of simple spicy salmon, avocado with eel rolls just to get a feel of the fish. And the fish was super fresh and tasty and the prices overall were very decent for what you get. Like I said, although the service was a little shaky, she made up for it by the end and we got chocolate lava cake, mango pudding and green tea ice cream for the table. They were all yummy but not memorable. Sushi is where it's at in this place and next time I will definitely call way in advance to try to get that private room. Kai Zan, you're a new sushi favorite of mine."
"Bad costumer service !! , we made a reservation for 8:30pm party of two , got a confirmation by text . we also got a phone call around 5:00pm to make sure that we are coming and told us that we might have to wait 10 minutes .we got there at 8:30 sharp and was told that out table will be ready soon, at 8:45 we were offered to buy a drink from the bar(yes to pay for a drink while we wait to the table the was promised to us at 8:30). at 9:00 i was asking if we will get a table today so i was told that they are very sorry but there is a table the is about to order a dessert so we will have to wait ... this is a joke , totally amateurs and no professional management.after we left the place no one even bothered to call us and maybe offer some kind of compensation or any alternative option.will never go there again , don't waist your time or money ...   not everything in a good restaurant is food , when you pay good money you also want to be treated as human and not like a dog ..."
"Both of our birthday dinners were had here. It is that phenomenal. There is no where with the quality fish that Kai Zan has in all of Chicago. And I've been everywhere. The agedashi tofu, the pearls, the uni shooters. Anything you get, I believe, will be superb. Even the less exciting items: salmon avocado roll - still leaves you never wanting to go anywhere else. No longer BYOB, but we won't complain too much. Your sushi dreams come true."
The absolute best sushi in town!!!
"We are so happy to find the former Kyoto based twins who know how to prepare sushi. I wish I could remember their names! The menu has some Kyoto favorites, and then a number of other tasty preparations. Make sure to try the Escolar Pearls and the Green Monster. No longer BYO, but the food is amazing. We will be back!!"
"This place is awesome. We got like everything.. scallops, tuna, crab, octopus, etc.. Everything was great, really great. It would get 5 stars if I could afford to go there more.  Food bill for the 2 of us was $60, so plan to spend some dough. I am totally willing to pay a pretty penny for food this good and will again.. but thats the only reason for 4 instead of 5. The private booths are really cool!"
"Best sushi in Chicago, period. I went with a large group and we all had a fantastic experience! Most of us opted to do the  $60 Omakase menu and it was a creative, fresh explosion of flavors.  Parts of the meal may have been spent in silence as everyone was busy taking pictures(everything was so artfully arranged) and then dying from happiness with each bite. I'm still dreaming about the Escolar and Maguro pearls. Yummmm.Just remember, it's a marathon and not a sprint.  Make sure you save room for the Nigiri platter, I was stuffed by course number 10 and was super sad when they brought out a platter of Nigiri. (Don't worry, I still ate more).Desserts were good but nothing special. Also, it's BYOB with $5-6 dollar corking fee, woohoo!"
Do you really need any more convincing? Do the $60 Omakase and you will happy and full. Order the 21% alcohol sake and try the Japanese craft beers. Done.
"(psst: i have a 7:45 pm reservation tonight, 12/19 for 4 that i can't use. friend/message me if you can use the table)___________________________________incredible sushi. truly. not what you expect for sure, not from the neighborhood, maybe not from the exterior, just go with an open mind. and don't order a california roll--this is the place to be adventurous because it's all insanely good. at some point in the meal you will gasp and look around and try and figure out if what you're experiencing is real. it's *that* good, people."
"Kai Zan is pretty much my new favorite sushi place - EVER. I would do downright dirty and evil things for their veggie rolls.Here's my top faves about Kai Zan:- Unbelievable, intimate ambiance. If at all possible, reserve a booth on the left hand side of the restaurant. - Enoki bacon. Get 5. Hell, get 10. Enoki mushrooms wrapped tightly with a piece of grilled bacon with a side of ginger dressing...what's not to love?- Totally veggie friendly. I don't eat much seafood. In fact, I really don't eat any. The chefs at Kai Zan are more than willing to make just about any of their rolls vegetarian. Be warned though - you will still pay menu price.- Rice free rolls. Yep - that's right. Rice free. See below.- The Karaage (aka - fried chicken) Every dude at the table raved how it was the best fried chicken they've ever eaten. I didn't necessarily agree, but I didn't disagree either.- The Green Monster - Even though I prefer this ""vegetarian"", nothing is better than veggies wrapped in avocado.- Reservations accepted! Make sure you make them - the place is tiny and gets packed  fast.Love sushi. Love veggie rolls. Love Kai Zan."
"Best Sushi I've ever had. I am very picky so that's saying a lot. Do not leave without ordering the orange rush, pearl escolar, salmon belly."
"Solid food, great environment and the chef's choice was the way to go.  I thoroughly enjoyed this spot and with the reasonable pricing, I look forward to going back."
Amazing. amazing. Amazing!!!!  Everything we had from the chef's tasting menu was wonderful and super fresh.  We've already been back several times since our first visit.  Love this place!
"The food is awesome cause they are all special and creative. However, it has a limited time for each party. For example, you need to return the table at 6:30 pm if you arrive at 5:00 pm. So I think if you want to chat with your friends for a long time, maybe that's not a good place. Anyway, the food there are really amazing, I like it."
This is my favorite sushi place in the city hands down.  I've been there about 4 times now and each time has been amazing.  I've ordered off the menu as well as tried the Chef's Tasting.  I'd highly recommned the Chef's Tasting.  You get a lot of food for your money and it's all delicious.  They now serve beer and wine but you can still byob for a corking fee.  Parking is also very simple and free.
"I waffled a bit on 3 or 4 stars.  Why you ask?  Oh you didn't?  Well I'll tell you anyway.  The food was good.  CA caliber sushi?  No, but getting closer.  So Chi-town sushi-wise decidedly 4 stars.However, our experience was a little dampened because we felt rushed-- they told us we had to be done in an hour.  Admittedly, this was our fault for being 20 minutes late for our reservation.  Parking was a b*tch to find in the rain so keep that in mind.  Luckily I yelped this gem before coming so I made sure to get the Uni Toro Special and the Escolar pearls.  The Uni Toro was an inventive, delicious, and memorable offering.  The added richness from the quail egg was superb.Escolar pearls were good, but didn't leave the same impression as the Uni Toro.  My friend and I went a bit crazy with our ordering and they brought the food out so quickly that we ran out of counter space.  Everything else was good, though nothing made quite as much of an impression as the Uni Toro.  I'm partial to uni, so I appreciated the plethora of uni choices.  Next time, I'll make sure to be on time, and I'll try the omakase.Almost forgot to mention BYOB!!!  So bring it.  Don't forget it in the car like we did."
"I refrained from reviewing Kai Zan for two years because I already have to wait long enough for reservations. Sadly Check Please and Zagat have done much more to add to that wait than my lowly review ever could. First let me say that this has to be the most friendly, unpretentious and approchable sushi/Japaneese restaurant in the city. Every time I eat here the staff is so friendly and helpful. You can genuinely tell that they all love to work there and want to share their restaurant with you. If you have never eaten here or are unfamiliar with what to order, I reccomend splurging and going for the omokase tasting menu. Try sitting at the bar so you can watch chef brothers Melvin and Carlo prepare the plates. It is truly an experience to watch and converse with these two artesians as they craft some of the best seafood plates available in the city. If you wish to order from the menu instead, I would say it's hard to go wrong with any of the fresh seafood choices, although I would implore you not to miss the escolar pearls. Enjoy Kai Zan, but try not to tell too many people, or you will be waiting outside on Chicago Avenue with me."
This place is an experience. Every single thing we had was delightful - visually and taste wise. I think we spent almost double what we planned to spend because if something was amazing we would ask for another order of it. That seemed to happen a lot. The uni shooters were great. The escolar pearls might have been my favorite - I know we had two orders of them. The orange rush and salmon sashimi were other favorites. Food came out fast and we could not stop ordering different things. I will go with the Chef's menu next time just to see what we will end up with. I think we ended up doing 10-11 courses as it was. I forget a lot of what we had because I was having so much fun and pretty much everything was equally good. I can't speak about any of the hot dishes. We stuck to raw and could not go wrong.I highly recommend.
Service good! Food great! Best Japanese place in this area! Recommend its tasting menu!
I'm not sure my review will do justice. Please take an evening and visit Kai Zan for dinner. Truly phenomenal Japanese preparations. I hope this place is here for 10 years to come.
This place is awesome and the menu is unique.  The food is as good as it looks....
"Everything from the Chef's choice to the Kai zan favorites were fantastic! The angry crab and flaming tuna were my favorite. We ordered the Hotate, Angry Crab, Orange Rush, Beef Tataki, and the Char Siu. The only slightly disappointing thing was the beef....the chunks were big and chewy. They would've been better had they been a little more thinly sliced. Overall, we will definitely come back!"
"Omakase is a great experience.  I would definitely recommend this place.  Only reason I took away a star is the beer list was a bit low on actual Japanese beers  and I am not a Hipster so I don't need FLYING DRAGON ON TURTLE BACK 400 MINUTE IPA.Very cool date place and I will be back to try the entrees.EDIT:Any restaurant where the Owner cares enough to respond like they did is worthy of 5 stars!  Thanks and Congratulations, I will be telling this story everywhere I go!"
"I came here last month with the boy. We were celebrating Christmas early since we were going to be separated by the ocean during the holidays.To treat ourselves, we headed to Kai Zan! I made reservations for a Tuesday night dinner. When we arrived, I knew it was going to be a small space. But dear lord, it really was TINY. I think it might be slightly larger than my garage. We opted to get the omakase and it started off pretty slowly. We had the peppers, followed by a jalapeno popper, uni shooters, and I forgot what else. To be honest, I was quite disappointed. Perhaps I've been building up too much hype in my mind, but I thought that the offering was rather boring. I liked the shooters. Actually, I liked them a lot. But that was probably one of the few standout points of the meal. I started to really pay attention when we decided to order 2 additional dishes after we were done with the omakase just because we weren't full. Both were nice pieces of fish belly. It was served simply and it really let the fish speak for itself.The service was alright. We came in knowing that we were going to order the omakase, but when the food came, the hostess/waitress didn't explain what we were eating. We had to flag someone down to explain what was in front of us. But other than that, the chefs were nice. I don't know which brother it was, but he kept on asking if we were enjoying ourselves.The boy liked the overall meal more than I did. I just expected more, whether it was mixing up textures or serving it in a different way. It felt like everything was either wrapped in escolar, an escolar roll, a slice of escolar belly, etc. Sweet Jesus, what happened to other fish?! Sorry, just not enough innovation for me."
"I'm gonna have  to go with one star. Very bad service. I came with my girlfriend the other day and this place is so small, arrogant hostess, never had such bad experience, so disappointed with the service.The food has gotten worse than I remember. While the portions seem to be larger the flavor is worse. WILL NEVER COME BACK AND RECOMMEND ANYONE"
"Generally not a fan of ""Asian fusion"" type places - especially when it comes to Japanese cuisine - but, I must say I really enjoyed the food and my experience at Kai Zan.  The waitstaff was fantastic, very friendly and knowledgeable of every item - describing in detail what each dish consisted of down to each ingredient.  Took my brother here for his birthday and we ordered the Omakase (Chef's choice) which, I think, is a great deal considering it's a 10-course meal that allows you to try a variety of items.  Considering there were only two of us, we did an ""up-charge"" that adds $10 to the price of the Omakase where there were a few select single items that they doubled to allow us each to try.  My favorites: Dynamite mussels, orange rush, and oyster shooters.  The flavors and textures were amazing!"
"You hear that squeaking? It's the wheels on this hype wagon that's got me going along for the ride! I have a feeling that Kai Zan is entering THAT level of culinary hype status for snazzified sushi.   OMAKASE!!!Beautiful, light, tastefully prepared course by course. I can't think of anything else better than relinquishing your meal to the pros. For those looking for an adventure, it was an epic multicourse from uni, escolar pearls, mussels, scallops, an assortment of maritime goodies... I'll let the pictures speak for itself as everything was wonderfully drowned in flavors and garnishes. However, the pickled wasabi was a little too much for me to handle...  a little does go a long way. I wasn't a big fan of the bacon-wrapped enoki or the fried popper. My mussel was gritty. After we reached our $50 level, we had been asked if we wanted to proceed. After trying one more, we ended the meal with the mango mousse. I LOVE mango and you know they used the real stuff... slightly stringy, oh-so-creamy. Every dish came out with an intro from our servers, an emphasis on the thoughtfulness behind each creation. Dinner was a super intimate experience, I'm not sure how they'd be able to accommodate groups larger than 4. I almost feel your chances of nabbing seats prove increasingly difficult if you're bringing more than one other person. For the variety and value, I would say the omakase's your best bet. After having the roller coaster tour of all things Kai Zan, I shall be back with an appetite, BYOB, and friends (hopefully in one of the only two larger tables in the place)!"
Sushi was delicious and the staff was attentive and helpful.  Will definitely be back.
We had the Omakase course menu. It's a good experience if you have the money to blow. :P Pro- byobCon- pricey
"I have been back here 4 times since my first Yelp review.  We had previously gotten the chef tasting menu; however they now have a second more expensive chef tasting  (which to me was just the original tasting we had before but twice as much).  The ""1st tier"" tasting menu is still very good - it just has been repetitive courses time after time.  The final sashimi final course presentation has gotten smaller and smaller each time we have been.  They are now full service bar not BYO which also drives the price up.  Fish is still amazingly fresh and food is very very very good.  Have not had anything bad yet!  Would still go back - prices are just getting very harsh to justify!"
"Oh wow, shame on me for not updating this review. I have been back twice more. Food AND service were impeccable. My #1 spot for Japanese in Chicago. Coming from someone who lived in a fishing port in Japan for 2 years."
"I would love to rate this place but unfortunately no one at Kai Zan answer the phones and that presuaded me not to go.  Tried to make a reservation for 3ppl but was directed by Yelp to call the restaurant to give a credit card to reserve.  Ok..I called before 5 so I tried again at 5, 6 and then 7pm. I left a message.  U have great reviews because of great food, but it's kinda frustrating to call ur establishment and NO ONE can answer the phone.  Maybe u don't take reserves being that its small in there, then I suggest u take off the link to make a reservation from Yelp or just answer the phone.UPDATE:  I would like to say...I'm impressed with the quick response  and acknowledgement of my review.  I rated them at 1 star due to my frustrations to dine in there but now with an understanding of technically difficulties on their end I have given them a total of 4 stars.  (Sound so lame).  Anyways...I will attempt to reserve my next dinner plan at Kai Zan."
this place is awesome i don't think i can go back to low quality sushi. this is a palates dream.  i can't wait to come back
"This place is nice inside and the food is good and all, but boy are the prices inflated especially for the area!!! OMG Kai Zan get a grip, you're not better than the majority of the sushi places in and around Chicago. I've had just as good sushi, if not better, at other restaurants and at fraction of the cost. For the price we paid, I would have expected alot more food than what we got! And what's up with the food showing up in less than 5 minutes from the time we ordered it? Boy that's the quickest I've experienced, but I had to wonder if it was even fresh?Now onto the bigger reason I had to write this review, the waitress! Have you ever had a waitress who literally hovers over you as you are looking at the menu???? What the heck is that all about?!?! She did so twice, and the I think the only reason she didn't do it again after the second time is because my friend finally told her we need a few more minutes! Gosh, how obnoxious! I think she was eager to get us out of there prior to or by 7. We didn't have a reservation when we walked in, so they did seat us however, they made it pretty clear that we had to be out of there by 7 as they had that table reserved for a larger party at 7....so i suppose me and my friend were not large enough! Also, since it was our first  time there, we asked what she recommends. We realized later that everything she recommended were all the priciest items on the menu! What a scam! We spent $70, walked out of there still hungry! The experience was NOT a good one whatsoever! I probably would not have even written this review if it wasn't for the obnoxious, scam waitress and for her eagerness to get us out of there by 7 and suggesting all the most expensive items on the menu which we got very little considering the price! I hope she got her fat tip from her ""large party"" for basically trying to push us out of there before 7! Huge disappointment!"
"Went for my parents' anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time! The food was excellent as usual. We had the 10 course omokase menu for $60 per person which is packed with great courses full of bold flavors and impeccable presentation. Portion size was just right. Also, they are serving wine, beer, and sake now. We had a nice bottle of champagne. (You can still BYO for a corkage charge of $15 per 2 people.) I love the ambience and environment here - the booths feel like you are in your own private dining room. Service was very good - everyone was friendly and knowledgable. The chef even came out to wish my parents a happy anniversary! I love coming here and feel it is really a neighborhood gem!"
"Not only a amazing Japanese spot, I'd argue as one of the top 3 restaurants in Chicagoland. This intimate spot on west chicago is very meticulous about every dish that leaves the kitchen. I'm actually proud to bring guests and friends here. It's one of those places that you can let the server just order for you, and I don't usually do this at all. People are catching on to how special this place is, which makes same day reservations nearly impossible. My advice is to order as much as you can sample, so that you know what to order more of. I'd recommend the orange rush, dynamite mussels, and the oyster shooter, just to name a few. If you're a fan of saki, they'd be happy to let you sample whatever ones you'd like. I'd also recommend the Demon Slayer for a higher quality saki at a reasonable price. Enjoy :)"
"Looked like great food but the server told us we had to be done with dinner in 1 hour.  I was like, really?  Is this a cafeteria?  We got up and left.  Very disappointing"
"Hear ye, hear ye citizens of Chicago, this sushi place fan-diddly-astic. I fear that it could jump the shark if it gets any more good reviews.  But, the Vizconde twins did not disappoint when I sat promptly at 5 p.m. in front of them at the sushi bar after not having eating a single thing all day in anticipation of my omakase experience.  They completely toppled my previous favorite, Coast.  Dear Coast, I've already forgotten what you look like.  Just to give you a little perspective, I worked as a fine-dining server for 15 years in the best American and French restaurants.  I have a razor-tuned palate. When it comes to sushi, while I love it and have eaten at countless sushi bars, I'm a bit out of my element. I've  I don't know any Japanese terminology.  I only explain this to tell you that I do not lightly say this: This was not only the best sushi I've ever had.  It was the best meal I've ever experienced in Chicago in terms of the entire experience .  .  . and the value for the dollar.  I know when restaurants are screwing you over for a ""tasting menu"" and this does not happen at Kai Zan.  Now I know that their prices have risen slightly since their opening, but what I received for $60 last night was spot on.  BTW, Dear General Public: Do you know that whenever you eat out for brunch you are getting totally hosed on value for your dollar? Here the dollar sprouts little angel wings and flies further than you know it could in the overpriced universe known as Chicago.The food, everyone else on this forum has emphasized the food in great detail.  My favorite was the Angry Crab and the Scallop ""pearls"" with truffle oil.  The dashi broth course was also excellent.  And ending with the sashimi plate instead of starting with it .  .  . absolutely genius.  After already having had around 10 courses, you realize now matter how full you are you can slide down just one more perfectly cut piece of fish.  The Dynamite Mussel was also excellent, much more flavorful than the standard French presentation of mussels & frites.  I checked with the chef and, of course, even the mussels were sourced carefully, New Zealand  green lipped as I'd suspected.  They are richer, slightly larger, fattier, and more flavorful than the standard PEI mussel that is generally served in restaurants.  If you ever have your choice at the fishmonger, buy them when you see them.  Prepare them as you normally would, but they will taste better. Sitting at the sushi bar was a great experience and the chefs made a couple extra items in addition to the standard menu that night and handed them directly to me.  I always sit at the sushi bar so I can ask chefs to prepare me something off the menu, but these guys did it without me even having asked.  That really sealed my imminent return.  I began to wonder at one point if they suspected me of being a food writer, because I just kind of look like one and if you've read this far, you really can tell that I'm a writer, just not a food writer.  (Occasional psychology articles if you're interested.) One food critique that I'm going to include, and only because I read many other reviews on here that mentioned it too, is the Tuna-tini.  Now, I think American brains get a bit confused some of the time because we always want our taste buds to be knocked out of the park, and an important element of Japanese cuisine is subtlety and simplicity, as in the dashi broth.  The Tuna-tini is a simple salad composed of Blue Fin toro, avocados, and heirloom tomatoes over a bed of seaweed.  The server described a dressing that was in it, but I didn't taste it.  There was nothing to highlight all of the flavors, I'm really thinking this dish is calling out for a bit more acidity to cut the fatty tuna and avocado flavors and textures. Also, as much as I love the taste of Blue Fin toro, the entire world needs to stop eating it for a few years. It's clearly listed as a fish to be avoided by the Monterey Bay guide.  I had no problems with the service.  Many on this forum have complained of stoic or aloof service.  Dear General Populace, you are not at TGI Fridays.  The service needs to do their job not fulfill any inner-emotional vacuum that you might be having.  As long as servers make a suggestion or two, are knowledgeable about the food, are quick efficient, that's all you need.  They're not there to be your friend, they are doing their job.  Get over yourself.Obviously, I highly recommend you patronize this establishment.  It has a nice romantic atmosphere that is not trying to hard or overdone in anyway.  They serve alcohol but I was informed on the phone I could bring a bottle of wine or sake for a corkage fee of $15/two people.  A very reasonable corkage fee if I've ever heard one.  I seized on the idea and brought a nice white wine to enjoy. My next big meal out is definitely going to be the elevated omakase, with my beautiful wife and a bottle of demi-sec champagne.  Won't that be a lovely evening?"
"When we sat down, we began chatting with our server about all the rave reviews we'd heard about this unsuspecting sushi spot. He said that some people had told him it was, ""the best sushi in the world.""I don't know if I'd go THAT far (we are landlocked after all and this IS humboldt park), but the sushi dinner two friends and I had here last night was one of the best I've had. Yes, probably ever. The escolar and maguro pearls were amazing starters. So fresh you actually feel a fresh taste in your mouth - I kid you not. We had a number of other specialty rolls, and a few classics, and everything was top-notch quality and served at a perfect pace. We all commented afterward how it felt different than post meal at other sushi places - you feel refreshed and satisfied - and not bogged down by too much breading or preservatives. While it was tough to get a reso here, and the location is a bit of a trek depending on where you live, I highly recommend and would definitely go back! It's small, though, so plan on going 1:1 or with a 4 -person group at max."
"I'm celebrating my ROTD with an updated review! I've since been back a couple more times to try their omakase. Check out my titillating photos, courtesy of my favorite eating-partner-in-crime. (Forgive me that I didn't quite catch all the names of the dishes as I was too busy stuffing my face).Faves:- Uni Toro DIY hand roll- Yellowtail Sashimi with Kai Zan sauce- Orange Crush (Scallop wrapped in Seared Salmon)- Escolar Pearls- Toro!!!Passes:- FlatbreadOf the 20+ dishes I've tried here, I'd only pass on one of them. C'mon, that's pretty good odds. But I'll be honest. This isn't necessarily the best Japanese food I've ever had. The prices are lower here for a reason.  You probably won't get the quality here that you get at Arami. You're also not paying what you pay at Arami. But what they do at Kai Zan, they do really, really nicely. This a gem of a Japanese place and a fine addition to this otherwise quiet neighborhood. Now to decide whether to share this place with my friends or keep it all to myself..."
"Best sushi in the city! BYOB, cordial staff. Chef Sampler is enough for 2 with the appetizer and is between 60 - 80. Great deal!!"
"Flaming tuna app was one of the best things i've ever had.   Good Maki, not great but everything else made up for it.  The duck skewer was awesome.  when I go back I'll try more skewers"
"Simply put, this is one of the best (if not the best) sushi places in Chicago. It's pricey but worth it. I recommend the chef's choice pre fixe."
"Almost a year from my last visit, I came here to find that they have expanded next door to give ample room for bigger parties.Melvin and Carlo never disappoint and are constantly inventing new and creative flavors.I've had omikase from these guys at least a half a dozen times throughout their career and each time is better than the last.This is not your traditional sushi joint.  It's not for the purist.  This is sushi with fusion.  Fusion sushi. Fushi?  Lots of flavors going on at the same time.Spoiler alert: We ordered omikase and this is what we got from what I remember.  I don't remember all the names of each dish so I made up some of them.Escolar PearlsRed Snapper Italian CarpaccioRainbow Trout CarpaccioOyster shooterUni shooterAngry CrabDIY Uni rollsQuartet: Mushroom salad, Uni Jalapeno sticks, bacon wrapped enoki, octopus saladMushroom dashiDynamite MusselTunatini2 Maki rollsSashimi boat finale: Super White Tuna, Salmon Belly (My personal favorite), and 2 other types of TunaAfter this epic meal, I left stuffed and elated."
Best sushi in Chicago! GET THE TASTING MENU! Nothing in the city even comes close. WOW
"Wow! First off. I love that parking here is so easy! Street and FREE parking available. Definitely make reservations weeks in advance to get a table otherwise it's a long wait on the weekend.My husband and I came here to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary here. We were originally seated by the sushi bar with his reservation. We preferred a table, so my husband asked if we can get a table instead which we did after waiting for awhile. The hostess told us that for future reference we should make note of the occassion when making the reservation so she can get us a table. She was nice about it, so we will be sure to indicate what we are celebrating when making the reservation.We ordered a lot of sushi. They were all so fresh and good. We really like their special - the summer salad. We also ordered the tuna tini which we thought is okay. We ordered three rolls - spicy scallop which is REALLY good, tuna avocado which is good, and the fiesta roll which was ehhh.. We had two of their specialty - angry crab (MUST ORDER!!!!) and orange crush which was good! For the rest of the food we ordered sashimi of almost every kind. My favorite was the salmon. My husband really like the otoro and yellowtail. None of the sushi failed - it is one of the best sushi places in Chicago and it is not hard to find parking!! Definitely would come back. It is pretty expensive, but it's really good. Our waiter was really nice, too. Can't complain at all!"
"Had dinner last night, absolutely fabulous.  Food and service in this small quaint jewel is worth going to.  They don't have their liquor license so they have a BYOBThe food is prepared with such finesse and creativity, this place has nowhere to go but to the top of the charts.  We were served by the sister of the two brother chef team, this is a real family affair, and they know what they are doing.I won't go into detail about the food, you just gave to experience it yourself, and it is an experience.  Listen to their suggestions they will steer you in the right direction based on your likes and dislikes"
"The best sushi place in Chicago! Always fresh and delicious. First timers must try the Omakase.  It is always delicious and perfect for a special occasion.   Unfortunately it has gone up in price since they first opened, but it is still perfect.Favorite dishes are the Flaming Tuna roll and Escolar Pearls, but everything is good.  BYOB with a $5 corkage fee so make sure to bring a bottle of wine.  Reservations are usually necessary as it is a small restaurant.  They typically post any last minute openings they have on Facebook so make sure to check if you did not make a reservation in advanced."
"Superb restaurant. Reserved a booth for the family. Unique atmosphere. My family commented on the unique lights overhead. I recommend the calamari and any of the sushi. Had complimentary appetizers due to our multiple orders of sushi. Amazing experience. If I had time, I'd try the omakase menu. Come early to search for street parking."
"My wife and I had a fantastic date at Kai Zan.  We ended doing both of the omakase (both the Chefs Choice ($60) and the premium ($100, cost varies each night)). Both were amazing. The only downside of ordering both was occasionally there were one-bite plates. Not a big deal though. The food was incredible. The service was also great. Both meals were 10 courses. Highlights were the cold smoked fish served in a small stone bowl, scallop wrapped with wagyu beef, perfectly cooked pork that somehow tasted like foie gras, and a huge plate of sashimi. The classic omakase was incredible and I would highly recommend. If you're thinking about going for the premium, its well worth it.  There was a discrete bump in quality and presentation, although both were great. I would certainly recommend and will come back again someday."
"We found Kai Zan on accident.  We went in at 5:30pm on a Friday and they're reservation  only.  We said fine and walked out.  Pulled out the Yelp app and noticed all these 5-star reviews.  Went back in and told them we would be in-n-out.  Mission accomplished.I'll cut to the chase, Kai Zan is a culinary experience.  We did the omakase, which translates to ""I'll leave it to you"".  Cool.  I can't wait to go back.  I guess the owners are right in the middle of the action in the kitchen.  Talk about passion for food.  High praise.To put things in perspective, we did not even know this place was BYOB and still had a great time.  That's a first.  I liked the service.  I saw a few negative reviews, but this dining experience was as close to eating at someone's home as you can get."
"Impressive!  Went specifically for the Omakase and was not disappointed!  There are 12 generous courses and the fish was fresh and delicious.  Left the restaurant stuffed, but quite content that I didn't feel gypped of my $60 dinner!"
Best sushi experience I have had in Chicago. Amazing service. Melvin and Carlo are sushi gods. Melvin heard I liked uni and hooked me up on one of the rolls too! Went for my birthday and I will be back without a doubt. One of my first Yelp reviews - it was that good.
"This place is amazing!! Very creative and so fresh!  If you are looking for a place to have your typical dragon type roll's, this isn't the place.  The mussel's, angry crab, and orange rush are a few of my favorite things.  It can get pricey since you want to try everything so I wish they were still BYO. Service is great though and worth the $$ spent."
"5 stars for food, (romantic) atmosphere, and service.  I've never had fresher tasting ingredients in sushi than I have at Kai Zan.  You can really taste it in every bite.  Despite the past reviews regarding their poor service, we had a completely different experience.  (They were recently featured on Check Please which might have something to do with the improved quality of service.)Everything was amazing.  We decided NOT to do the omakase menu as we weren't feeling very adventurous that night.  We just wanted sushi and I'm pretty confident we made the right choice.  Maybe next time though.."
"Food is amazing. The presentation is gorgeous, everything is supremely fresh and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Seriously probably some of the best sushi if not the best in the city.Now what lost them one star was the cost of the beer. Granted they do have a $15 BYOB option but we figured we would just have one drink each so it wasn't worth it.  The beer is not on the drink menu so we were simply told the options and picked from what was told. We did order 2 craft beers and one was a large bottle (the size of a large Saporo if you ever got that) and I expected it to be a bit more than a typical restaurant. When the bill came I was honestly shocked to see that the larger beer came out to $22 and the smaller was $18. Now I realize that this is an upscale place but $40 for 2 beers (no tax or tip) is insane and should at least be listed in the menu to prepare people! Overall conclusion, I will definitely be back for the food but I will not be ordering any alcohol there."
"Is this place a gem?  Perhaps.  The omakase menu is affordable and always a great way to appreciate the chefs flexing their culinary muscle.  Having that said, I'm not a big fan of sushi being overpowered with lots of sauce that mask the freshness of the seafood.  Maybe this is why my favorite parts were the japanese smelt which was simply grilled and served with daikon radish and lemon and the soup at the beginning of the meal with a skewer of tuna that cooked itself in the broth.  We sat at the chef's table which I'm also not a big fan of because when eating out, I want to enjoy the company of the person I'm with - through great conversations and not by watching the chefs prepare our meal.  However, this experience allowed me to really observe the chef and if nothing else, it was evident that they were committed and passionate about their craft.  And this is why it's sad that their efforts to share their talents with their diners have to be ruined by an inept hostess who lack tact in basic customer service.  It was a rainy day in Chicago yesterday and after having just experienced lots of flooding, many roads were still difficult to navigate and rainy weather just has a way of slowing everyone down.  So we were a little late with our reservation but it was 5:45 p.m. on a Tuesday for crying out loud; we're not talking about 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday night.  The hostess took my name and immediately said:  ""We need your table back by 6:45 which should not be a problem if you order all your food at once?""  Are you serious?!  This is your welcome greeting?  Well she caught me on a really bad day and the last thing I wanted was to be told that I had a time limit to experience a restaurant that was just crowned as one of Chicago's best new restaurants!  Everything else tasted bad after that; the place was cramped and it was evident that they were rushing us from one course to the next so the tasting menu --- which is always supposed to be a relaxing experience, became a devouring menu that you had to force feed yourself to finish all your food at once because each course came right after one another.  And wouldn't you know it?  They finished by serving us by 6:45 p.m.?  Never again- omakase menu may be cheap but so was the entire experience!"
Probably the best sushi I've had in the city.  Pretty reasonable for the quality of both the food and staff.  There is a reason it takes a while to get a table.
"Kai Zan is a magnificent in terms of the quality of their food. However, this past trip, I was very disappointed in the service. We are treated poorly by all the staff -- after asking 3 times, we received a tea cup that we could drink tea out of without burning our hands. We asked for certain dishes with some of the sauces on the side but these requests were ignored. It was a shame since I have had an amazing experience in the past and had raved about it to my guest."
"For the food = 5 stars. For the service = 4 starsOne of the regular menu items, the Angry Crab, was fantastic.Also a special item, a just barely grilled hamachi, nigiri style was also great.Apparently they have only recently started bar service, but a nice selection of sake.The waitress said they had beer but really didn't know one from the other, and made no effort to find out, which was one of the few flaws in a really remarkable meal.Most creative sushi I have found. I am not an expert, and we normally ask for soy and wasabi;  half way through this meal I stopped using it, the food is so well crafted it doesn't need embellishment.We will return soon."
"This is our second time at KaiZan and I have to say that they exceeded our expectations again. Great service, very fresh fish, perfect mixture of flavor. Defiantly a must visit place. Presentation is out of this world as well  ."
Great sushi. Fresh fish. Unbelievable service. Our server's name was Erin and she was such a delight to have serving us. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves a delicious sushi meal. The chef's menu was the best! Thanks!
"SO DISAPPOINTED. I have read so many good things about Kai Zan and couldn't wait to come here to check it out. The hubs and I had reservations last night. In short- our pompous server tainted our experience and we felt like we got ripped off. The deets:  After being seated for 15 minutes, our waiter finally came by to offer to open our wine. Side note- the place is so small there are 5 tables and a sushi bar. We were seated at the sushi bar and he had to walk by us at least a dozen times before acknowledging us. Anyways, 10 MINUTES LATER he still hasn't delivered our opened bottle of wine. We wanted to walk out, and would have had he not been holding captive the wine we brought. In retrospect we should have walked out and just said sayonara to the vino. We started with the escolar pearls. They were really tasty but small for $8. Ok fine. Still feeling optimistic. We ordered the 3 of their featured sushi items. Eel wrapped in tuna, angry crab, and scallop wrapped in salmon. Each were $8. We expected them to be rolls. Instead, we discovered that they were 2 bites per order, equating to 1 bite per person. Where we felt the most taken advantage of though was on the sashimi we ordered. They had 2 sashimi specials of fresh fish they were featuring. One was a steelhead trout, the other was toro. The other sashimi items we were going to order were $3 a piece. Of course having been tempted by the sound of the specials, we ordered 2 pieces of each. When the bill came we found out they were 3 times the price of all other sashimi- $9 a piece!! Lovely surprise when the bill came to discover that 2 bites per person cost $36. Our server was MIA for the most part but when he was present to deliver our next dish, he couldn't be bothered. The whole experience just left a bad taste in my mouth.  I get that the fish quality was really good, and honestly we liked everything we got. That is the only thing keeping this from being a 1 star review. But we left starving after spending $80. There are so many great, super fresh sushi joints in the city and I'm just sorry I wasted a dime at this one."
"I love it. Service was impeccable by Alan. I went there 2 times the week I discovered this place. Japanese tho, is my favorite cuisine so I'm a lil biased. but! I am also very picky and can definitely tell the difference btw crappy Japanese and quality. Kaizan was quality. I had the:Orange Rush (must have)Calamari Fry (must have)Escolar Pearl (must have)Fiesta Roll Carmelized onion sauce on grilled scallop (must have)...to name a few..I have to tell u tho, this table across me had the chef special 5course menu thingy and damnnnn it looked delicious. I'm definitely gonna do that next time. I believe it's $50 a person for that. Overall, price wise, it was a bit of stretch for me..can't be doing the twice a week thing. But I really hope others will enjoy this place as much as my family and I did."
"Went last night with another couple. I wish I had thought to track how many times we said ""wow"". We all did the 10 course Omakase menu and were so glad we did.  We felt like you got a lot of sushi for $60 and everything was awesome.  We were seated in one of the private booths and were very happy with it.  I am not a food geek who wants to try every new and fancy and expensive restaurant but I am dying to go back and get the other chef's choice Omakase. Last night it was $120 and my experience with the $60 one just made me curious as to what else the chef will come up with.  Bravo!"
"Hands down my #1 favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago. Nothing beats Kai Zan on taste, ambiance, quality, and value. First came here in 2012 and haven't stopped since. Everything on the menu is amazing, and the creativity of the dishes and rolls really work. I would eat here every day if I could. Service is great, place is hip but not too hip where it's pretentious, cozy (not good for large parties over 8 max), and menu is just large enough. Priced right. I've told all my friends about this place and it has become their fave sushi place too. They have daily specials that change which is always nice, and an 11-course chef's tasting menu (totally worth it!).Some standouts: Green Monster, Angry Crab, Danielle, Orange Rush and Flaming Tuna.Basically order everything, you cannot go wrong here!"
"Amazing, amazing, amazing.  I can not rave enough about our experience at Kai Zan last night.  A friend had recommended the place to us as her favorite sushi place in the city.  Contrary to a lot of the complaints I've read in other reviews, I had no trouble making a reservation through the online seatme.com site that Kai Zan directs you to from their Facebook page.  We went on a Monday with a party of 3, and booked an 8pm res.Also, contrary to other reviewers comments, we had no problems with the service and had no feeling of being rushed.  My fiance and I arrived 5 minutes early and they prepared the table, seated us, and opened our wine for us to enjoy while we waited for our friend.  They may act differently on a busy weekend night, but with a space this small, it is understandable that they want to keep their tables used efficiently.Once our whole party was seated, our server Chris explained the menu and asked how we'd like to proceed.  Based on the overwhelming recommendations on yelp, we each decided to do the $50 omakase (Chef's Choice) tasting.  In a word...perfection.  Did we enjoy every single item completely?  No, of course not.  With the kind of variety Kai Zan offers, there's bound to be some items that don't agree with your personal tastes.  But every single item was prepared to perfection, presented beautifully, and only the utmost top quality ingredients were used.  We were completely and pleasantly full after the meal, no room left for anything additional.  It's the perfect amount of variety and quantity, and a tasting like this would easily be $85 at any of the other top sushi places in the city.  Trust me, if you appreciate sushi, this is the best $50 you will ever spend.  And the restaurant is BYOB so our bill was literally $50 each, plus a $5 corkage fee.  Not bad for one of the best meals I've ever had.You won't need any soy sauce or siracha sauce with this meal.  Just sit back, order the tasting, and let the chefs dazzle you with their brilliance and creativity. Favorites:- Uni shooters and oyster shooters: Both were delicious, but I was surprised to find that I liked the uni significantly better than the oyster (and I usually love all things oyster). - Escolar and maguro pearls: These were both equally delicious and just as everyone else has mentioned, easily a favorite of the night.- Angry Crab: A bite of heaven and the wasabi perfectly hits you at the end.  It's like it was created in layers so you can taste each individual layer as you're chewing and each has a distinct flavor.- Steelhead Trout Sashimi:  Imagine the best salmon sashimi you've ever had...and then imagine having something similar but twice as delicious.- Tako: The octopus salad was served at the perfect time, the vinegar was light and refreshing to cleanse our mouths and the touch of wasabi was nice.- Unagi Poppers: The jalapeno poppers were also very tasty, but I was a little confused.  They were said to have had unagi inside the jalapeno, but there was none, so I think somebody messed up there.  Either way, the panko covered jalapeno with cream cheese and eel sauce was not their most original creation of the night, but still tasty and enjoyable.- Shrimp with Shitaki Mushrooms: The shrimp was good but the moist and barely cooked shitaki mushroom cap with delicious ginger dressing and other sauces was fantastic.- Mussel: My memory escapes me, but we had a mussel on a shell dressed in deliciousness.  I had hoped we'd get to try the Orange Crush, but the mussel was a wonderful substitute.- Sushi Roll: The sushi roll came out towards the end, as we were all discussing how there was no way we could eat any more food, so my fiance ended up eating most of this for the team.  I'm not sure what the roll was called but it was a simple roll of tuna and cucumber, salmon and a bit of spicy sauce.  It was delicious, but I could only eat one bite.Not Our Favorites:- Agedashi Tofu: The broth that the tofu was served in was downright drinkable, but the tofu itself was bland and unseasoned and a little bit boring.- Enoki Bacon: I didn't try this one, but the other two said it was just ok.- Grilled Yellowtail: A little bit bland and boring as well.- Charred Smelt: I believe this dish was prepared to perfection and Chris seemed disappointed that we didn't enjoy it, as it's one of his favorites.  But the smelt was just a little bit too fishy for our tastes.  If you're okay with strong fish (and okay with eating whole fish, head to tail), you'll love this.Service was prompt and friendly.  They were great about clearing dishes quickly, always explained what each dish was and recommended the best way to eat it, and did not make us feel rushed at any time.  The place is very cozy and casual and welcoming.  I can't wait to go back again."
"Wow... seriously wow.  Came here on a double date because my wife's cousin got us a gift card to Kai Zan.  And let me tell you, it was awesome.The four of us made reservations for Sunday (Sat was already booked five days in advance).  Online reservations, easy to manage, shame they don't have their online menu/website up and working yet.We ordered the omakase ($50) and received a lot of food... I'm going to list all that I can remember, in case you choose not to go omakase, and instead order piece by piece.  Here's what I can remember.Escolar Pearls - Yes, these are amazing.  We each received four full bites of escolar pearls using super white tuna and lean tuna (maguro).  Best dish of the night.Angry Crab - A full 12 pieces for the table, so three pieces a person.  Another clear winner.Oyster shooters - Beautiful presentation, and one of the few ways my wife enjoyed raw oysters.  (Actually, the first time she's ever said she enjoyed raw oysters).Dynamite mussels:  Very flavorful and a great combination.  Mussels were slightly overcooked, but only in the barest of ways.Agedashi tofu:  Soul satisfying broth, but the tofu wasn't crisp/crunchy on the outside... I think we've just had better agedashi tofu elsewhere.Jalapeno poppers:  Perfectly fried, nice combination.Bacon wrapped enoki:  Not a huge fan... I think I was expecting the bacon to be more crisp and more texture to the enoki.Marinated shitake:  These were awesome... so packed with flavor, I saved these as my last bite for this particular dish.Yakitori smelt:  Tasty, good flavor, nice and smokey.  Reminded us of some filipino fish dishes in terms of preparation/smell.Steelhead trout:  Really, this tasted like salmon.  I would have never guessed that this was trout... but then again, they are both very closely related, so I guess it makes sense.  A phenomenal sashimi.Mango pudding:  Refreshingly light and simple, perfect way to end the meal.  Best shared with two people, though we did share with four as we had additional dessert plans afterwards.Verdict:  Get reservations early, as this place literally will only fit 22 people or so.  Great service, phenomenal food, and you have got to make your way here to enjoy it.  The Omakase is a steal, in all our opinions, and I hope they keep it that way because it will keep us coming back for more and more.  Only disappointment for the night was Agedashi tofu... but considering the amount of courses we had, one off course is nothing in light of everything we enjoyed.  Can't wait to come back again."
"I initially wrote a very strong review and decided to delete it based on owners response, not because I agree with them but it's not worth fighting over. It's not hard to please customers, offer good food, appropriate pricing and pleasant dining experience where you are not rushed.   I don't need them to stop over and greet us. I still disagree with some things they say and my opinion has not changed about this place.  I still will not return to this establishment. Wish the owners best of luck and hope a glimmer of what I said hits home   with them."
"I have been to Kai Zan twice now and I am a big fan. The service is excellent, the ambiance is quaint and cozy. For our second visit we opted for the chef's tasting menu, it was wonderful. Each dish was inventive and aesthetically pleasing. It also didn't taste half bad! Their sashimi is so fresh and tasty, the smokey mussels are amazing and angry crab roll is to die for. There were a few misses, which included a little tuna salad cup that was just okay but overall it was a great meal. Also the value for 11 courses can't be beat, $60 bucks for a ton of seafood. I'll go back soon and probably stick to the dishes that shined during the chef's tasting."
Second time there. We ordered the premium omakase. It costs more than the regular one. But every bite is worthy it. Try that one for sure.
Yummy!  Came here for a girls night and we all left very happy!  Everything we ordered was very good. We had 5 ppl in our group and they were able to adjust some orders that had 4 pieces to 5 pieces.  The only downside was that their drink list only consisted of sake and wine.  Will def come again to check out their omakase chefs choice!  Street parking was also easy on a Friday night.
"O.M.F.G. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. I had been here before, but my friend and I had been on a bar hop, so having a full evaluation of the sushi just wasn't happening. This time, however, I was sent into nirvana. I'll fully admit, I haven't had sushi from tokyo and whatever other great sushi cities one can come up with. I have had what I believe to be very good sushi, and Kai Zan is heads and shoulders above anything else I've had. I went here with 3 other friends. We're all very into wine, so yes, many bottles were brought. I do love that they are completely BYO, and yea, we kinda abused that. Thankfully the staff was cool with it and we made sure to reward them for that. Anyway, it's near impossible to get into all of the food. Mostly because we just let our waitress pick for us. So, food would just appear and she would tell us what we were having. I was only paying so much attention and more just focused on the killer fish in front of me. We started off with the oyster shooters and the escolar pearls. The oyster shooters are a complete trip with them being so wrong that they are insanely right. The escolar pearls were absolutely awesome and should be ordered by everyone. Here is where things got hazy as it was one order after the other. I do remember there being some steelhead trout sashimi that was amazing and a fiery crab (or was it angry crab?) that we had to order twice. The major point being though, everything put in front of us was both gorgeous in it's presentation and just as delicious as it looked. Kai Zan is a very small spot. We were there for a little over an hour and we could see a line forming out the door, so we did have to leave a bit sooner than we probably would've liked. But, it was also a friday night and I fully understand that they have to turn over tables since there is so much demand. I can't wait to come back and I'm already plotting yet another return."
"We all had omakase and for $50, i think it's a really good value! We got to taste almost everything from the March special menu and the couple daily special that the waiter mentioned when we first sat down...we were stuffed at the end of the tasting but we still managed to check out the dessert menu. They are all really good but we like the mango mousse the best The food and the quality of the ingredients were good and creative for $50...though we all thought the agedashi tofu wasn't that great. it was pretty firm, chewy and not crunchy at all. I wonder why they use the firm tofu vs the soft tofu like everywhere else...the place is really small...they literally only have a table each for 4 and ""6"" people..but to be honest, we were seated at the ""6-ppl"" table coz we have a group of 5, but i honestly don't know how that table can comfortably fit 6 people?! we had 3 people sit on one side and 2 people sat on the other. one of my friends on the 3-people side were ""half out"" of the table.. =/i want to go back to order the nigiris because our neighbours' looked pretty good and i was hoping one of the omakase courses would have the nigiris since i am not at all into rolls, fried stuff and mayo/cream cheese-in-everything...lol....i don't think rolls and these condiments were japanese invention...."
"We picked this place based on a high review online. But I honestly don't know what the hypes are about. First of all, they don't have any high chairs or booster seats, that means kids are not welcome. I understand that if they are an high end restaurant. But they are not. In fact, the way they design this place never considered having kids to dine in.  None of the table can really accommodate high chairs or booster seats. Food is really mediocre.  There's nothing special about any of the sushi or maki. Actually one of the maki we ordered had no flavor. Same goes with the charbroiled skewers. Menu has very limited selections. We don't know what else to order so we stopped after we had some maki rolls and few pieces of fish. The waitress gave us a dirty look after I told her we are not going to order more. I normally don't like to write review on restaurants. I think that if the place is bad then I'll just never go back again. But this place annoyed me so much that I just had to write a review. Our experience was just awful, from the first minute we walked in until we walked out. We will never go back."
"You can be a purist, or you can embrace change.  There's a lot of places that take traditional sushi and other Japanese cuisine and put a modern spin on it, but there's few that pull it off as well as Kai Zan, a nice spot in West Town that flies a bit under the radar because of it's location. Places like Japonais and Roka Akor get more buzz because of the chic decor and the River North location, but Kai Zan offers up similar food at similar quality, but at a slightly lower price point.  Add in that it's BYOB and you can see why it gets the Yelp cred that it gets.  We were able to score a same night reservation around 7pm.  It sounds like they keep to a pretty tight schedule as we were informed we had a little over an hour to eat when we sat down.  That put us off a little right off the bat, but ultimately after that, they never really pushed the issue and we ate without feeling rushed or pressed.The menu is split into cold and hot appetizers, sushi and rolls, and a few choice robata style entrees, along with a nice selection of seasonal specials.  We got a pretty wide mix of everything, although we were tempted to just go with one of the omakase choices (next time!)We started with the angry crab roll and medium-thin sliced piece of maguro wrapped around a ball of fresh lump crab meat mixed with a spicy mayo and topped with pankos.  A solid mix and a good way to start the meal.  The tuna was more meaty and tender than fatty and melded nicely with the crab.As someone who's always on the lookout for good fried chicken, karaage is tough to pass up.  While good, the karaage was one of the more forgettable dishes of the meal.  A bit salty on the batter and a bit overcooked.The hamachi kama, taken from the neck/collar of the yellowtail, was the highlight of the meal.  The grilled char gave the cooked fish a nice smokey flavor and the fish itself had a nice meaty texture.  Cooked yellowtail is quite different from the raw hamachi most of us are used to and has a very fishy flavor, almost like mackerel.  The portion size was very generous for the price.  These apparently are in somewhat limited supply so if it's in stock, I highly recommend grabbing one.Next up is the takoyaki - the skewer comes topped with just a touch of wasabi mayo, bonito flakes.  These little fried octopus balls were solid and the bonito flakes, the wasabi mayo, and the touch of teriyaki gave it a nice mix of sweet, salty, and spicy.Feeling like we had to sample a few things from every portion of the menu, we next ordered a few pieces from the grill. First,  the slightly fatty cut of pork belly, served with a small side of kimchi, and the second, a large prawn,which was just a bit undercooked but massive in size.To finish the meal off, we moved on to the raw fish portion of the meal.  The salmon was superbly fresh and well cut to a nice thickness, and the escolar simlarly so, although it lacked a bit of the usual crisp, moist bite that bursts when you bite into it.  We ended with a pair of raw ama ebi shrimps - fresh and sweet and followed by the meatiest, most flavorful shrimp heads I've ever had.  These almost made the meal in itself.Thankfully, the meal didn't necessarily need the extra support from the shrimp heads.  Even before that, there was a number of dishes that put this meal into the upper echelon of Japanese meals I've had in Chicago.  I'd put the sushi just a step down from Katsu, but still better than 95% of the joints in Chicago.  And we can't wait to go back.Pics and more up at: chohschow.com/2014/07/14…"
"I would give them 10 stars if I could.After hearing raving reviews from our friends husband and I decided to go there to celebrate something.. I forget if it was an anniversary or a birthday.Anyways, we went there early because we heard it gets extremely packed. Well, we must've gone too early because the restaurant was near empty.We chose to do Omakase and good lord we were already full halfway through.The server seemed aloof but seemed to warm up to us towards the end.  I think we got half of a smirk from him at the end.  Back to the Omakase. It. Was. AMAZING.Every dish was melt in your mouth delicious.  I can't remember how much we paid for the Omakase.. $60 0r $70?  Something along that range and we lost count of how many courses we were served.  Didn't matter since we were so full at the end.The chef/owner also came out at the end of our meal for a small chit-chat.Overall, great dining experience and I can't wait to go back,"
"This place is just about as amazing as people say it is. I highly recommend you go with the Omakase, just like I recommended you do the degustation menus in Paris. When there is an option to let the chef feed you, do it.Hard to remember all the dishes, but the uni shooters were lovely- a teensy bit acidic for my taste, the bacon wrapped mushrooms were great, and the little mushroom soups were so aromatic and full of flavor. Just the broth was amazing. Obviously all the fish was perfect- they are a little heavy with the spices instead of leaving the fish in its natural state, but it worked, so I was okay with that.The space is so tiny, you have to make reservations or you'll probably never get in. But it's BYOB, which is really nice. I'm a big fan of the BYOBs. I would definitely go back, and I think I would order off the menu this time, just kuz I've already done the Omakase, and I'd like to try more of the sushi. Overall a definite must in the Chicago Japanese food scene."
"I've eaten at a  variety of sushi restaurants throughout Chicago (and other major cities), but I will say without a doubt ... Kai Zan was THE BEST sushi I've ever had. From the cut of the fish, to the way it was prepared, to the seasoning ... everything was absolutely perfect. There were some pieces that fell apart in your mouth with only a ginger or wasabi dressing that was so simple but all you needed to complete the flavor. I don't think we used soy sauce/wasabi once. We ordered the OMAKASE CHEF'S CHOICE. The cost of the chef choice was $50 per person but we easily had $100-$150 worth of food each. The restaurant was extremely generous, and dish after dish kept coming out. Overall, I wish I could have given the place a 6. Reservations can be made online through their website. I would plan at least 2 to 3 weeks out for a weekend reservation. Absolutely worth a try for the sushi fan."
"Really enjoyed the experience. Sushi was fresh and creative. The Pearls on the appetizer menu are fabulous. We enjoyed every roll, although the spicy tuna needed more spice. The ambiance is great. Parking is incredibly difficult, but that was really the only negative aspect. Really great and creative, and wonderful service!We also had no trouble getting a reservation on a Thursday night. They were flexible and courteous, so we did not have the same negative feelings about the ""get in get out"" philosophy."
Great quality upscale Japanese restaurant. Everything is fresh and carefully made. The uni shooter is a gem! Sashimi is wonderful and worth the price. Would definately come again!
"My boyfriend and I made reservations to this place based on the reviews on yelp for our anniversary. Initially we almost didn't even walk inside the place because the area it was in was definitely not what we were expecting; the area looked a little bit run down. However after some decision making we decided to give it a go, and ended up being pleasantly surprised. We ordered the omakase (tasting menu) and were blown away! We sat right in front of the chefs while they prepared and made all their dishes, and they also made us feel welcome by asking us how we were and making small conversation. The food was amazing and our bill was priced right for what you got. Unlike others, our service was fine and we were seated as soon as we walked in. Overall a great place for a date or going out in general."
"Probably  some of the best sushi I've ever had! I got the omakase 10 course meal ($60) and it was definitely worth it! Each course came out quickly, one after the other which was great since I was on a bit of a time crunch. Each dish was delicious and EXTREMELY FRESH. Most of the dishes we received were part of the menu which was great because we got to try different things on the menu.  I can't stress enough how good this place was. Would 100% recommend this and am definitely going to go back."
"Just amazing. Fresh, creative and friendly"
I just have to write this review . It's one of the best dining experience we've had in Chicago. We like this better than L20 and that was when they initially got the three Michelin stars. The fish was so fresh and the preparation was so innovative and amazing.
"I've been here a couple times and love 99% of Melvin's and Carlo's creations!I highly recommend the omakase menu for those with hearty appetites (10 or so small courses for $50/pp).  You will be really full but not uncomfortably stuffed, and if you are, you are no fun!  My recommendations (a la carte, or if you can ask them to incorporate these into the omakase - not sure if they will allow it?):- Escolar pearls (nigiri - super white tuna with truffle!)- Orange crush (seared salmon and scallop)- Creamy roll (unagi & shrimp tempura wrapped in avocado instead of nori seaweed)- Hamachi collar (seared fish with lemon juice)- Unagi popper (jalapeno, unagi, and cream cheese - deep fried!)I do NOT recommend: ahi tuna flatbread, chawanmushi, or the katsu rollsSuggestion #1: Come here if you enjoy sushi at other restaurants already but are willing to try slightly more refined Japanese cuisine - both traditional and creative.Suggestion #2: Do not sit down and pour soy sauce right away because you will not need it.  Use the appropriate sauces that come with the dish because the food here is already so flavorful.Suggestion #3: Make reservations to be on the safe side because this restaurant only seats around 20 people.  Also, large parties would not fair well here.  Come here as a couple or in a group of 4 max.Suggestion #4: BYOB!"
"Outstanding! The best fish in town by far! Went 4 times in one month, can not wait to go back!"
"Reservations recommended, very limited seating!Well, well, well. Lookie here at little Kai Zan making some big waves in Humboldt Park. Fresh and inventive sushi has arrived, my dears. And, you should go get you some. Rawwwwwwwsome. We arrived around 630pm with a group of 4 on a Tuesday, and it would be good to note that they only have two tables that seat more than a 2-top, so as mentioned...make a reservation. This isn't a great spot for a big group. Even as is, the space is fairly tight. Better for a date spot. We were allowed to snag one of those bigger tables, but it was reserved starting at 8pm, so we had to hustle just a bit. Luckily all the food came out expediently! We started with a round of specials, some oyster shooters, seabass carpacio, among others. Everything was delicious. We ordered some special rolls (take care here, some only come with 2 pieces) as well as some standards: rainbow, california, spicy tuna, et al. Again, all exceeded expectations. Our service was wonderful from start to finish. Never felt rushed despite the timeline. All dishes and specialities explained with just the right amount of excitement. Wine opened, glasses distributed, smiles given. *BYOB with $5 corkage fee per bottle. *Some of the best sushi I've had in a very long time! *Street parking fairly easy (and non-permit) Fantastic, off the beaten path date spot that will impress your miss or mister with the quality, location and uniqueness. It's super indie, but just posh enough to be special. The food will knock your socks off, you can bring your own bottle of wine to impress...what's not to love?*Also, if you are waiting for a table...pop into Komodo or Squasht for some local shopping! Total bill for 4 was just over $115 (without tip), and we were stuffed and sated. A better value than anticipated. Now, take that someone special. You'll thank me, I promise!"
"Had the Omakase...it was incredible, and an amazing deal to boot. Don't forget it's BYOB!"
While the food was excellent - to be told we needed to get up from our seats because they needed them is completely unacceptable. If I am spending $250 for dinner - I DO not need to be rushed out.  There are plenty of great sushi options in Chicago.  Shameful that excellent food has to be ruined with awful service.
"Definitely would go back again.Service: GreatUnagi popper: Mediocre; good as a jalapeno popper but couldn't taste any unagiGreen Monster: very fresh and delicious; loved the texture, but it was supposed to have unagi in it and didn't taste anyEscolar pearls: Probably the best thing we had; truly amazingKaki fry: LOVE; and love the small salad it comes withAlthough not on the menu, we asked for a sashimi platter, and the waiter said the chef could prepare something for us - fantastic; only thing i didn't like was the saba, but ive also spent a lot of time in japan so perhaps i'm spoiled; all the fish was fresh and they gave 2 tempura shrimp heads as wellTip: everything was great except things that we ordered unagi in; they either serve quantities of unagi that are undetectable or their's isnt very good; would recommend everything but those pieces; having said that, those items were still delicious, just couldn't really taste the unagi! 1 of 2 really great sushi places in chicago"
"We had a superb dinner at Kai Zan.  What happened to be a lucky find on yelp, turned out to be a real gem.  The sushi was fresh and we loved the oyster shooters, uni nigiri as well as the uni and tuna special.  Service was attentive and food was outstanding!  We will be back soon to try the omakase.  Love the place!"
This is my new sushi spot for someone special or folks visiting Chicago. Why?Edibles- Oyster shooters- Seabass carpacio- Salmon wrapped scallops aka Orange Rush- Great sushi rollsNon-edibles- $5 bottle poppin' fee - Easy street parkingDone and done. Make reservations. Get after it.
Mother of Pearl!!!  This is worth every bit of time it takes to get a reservation and get in.  These are very very bad men.  Like bad in the MJ (both Jackson & Jordan) sense of the phrase.
"Wow.  I've dined here several times, and these guys never disappoint. Let me just say that this place not only serves some of the best sushi in the city, but  I felt the Kai Zan crew has dished out some of the best culinary experiences of my life. All for a fraction of the cost of some of the more higher-end spots in town. Word of advice: to get the most of your meal, go with the Omikase."
"Sensational sushi - fresh, wonderful flavors and very interesting options.  Not the overwhelming menu or over the top flavors. which often means no real flavor, of so many other places.  Our favorites are the Maguro pearls, Danielle and Angry Crab, and the Fiesta roll.  Also the different skewers are wonderful, particularly the different veggie options such as Shitake or asparagus.The restaurant is quite small but a very nice atmosphere.  Hard to get a reservation but worth it."
"I absolutely loved Kai Zan sushi.  If you enjoy little dive type sushi bars, then you will love this place.  It certainly is not a dive.  It's clean, nice, and trendy.  I referred to it as a dive more due to it being out of the heart of the city a bit and it pretty small.  We sat at the sushi bar and what's great about that is that you get to watch the chefs all while eating.  We decided not to do the amakazi but I must say everybody else was and it looked great. My favorite was the dynamite mussels.  Though it's not a real popular dish here or I mean it is not suggested by staff but we loved it is the spicy tuna and cucumber roll.  The fish is fresh and very good."
"Amazing little restaurant that transports you out of the city into a private top notch dining experience.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff and unreal Omakase.  We were celebrating our sons 23 birthday and opted for the Premium Omakase experience, a 12 course tasting that blew our minds.   Delicate layers of flavor, umami , stunning presentations, not one disappointing dish.    The omakase menus are pricier, but the regular dishes are quite reasonable.   Worth every penny and well worth the trip!"
"Super fresh and delicious! Some tasty morsels: the Unagi Poppers, Maguro Pearls, and the Mango Pudding dessert. BYOB and $5 corkage fee. Will be back."
"Dined at Kai 7/24/14.Despite the fact that I had heard amazing things about this restaurant, I was apprehensive after making my reservation, which I made online day of.  Over the course of my day, I was reminded multiple times, either in writing or verbally from restaurant staff (when calling to confirm) that my table was mine from 7-9pm.  I am comfortable giving my credit card number to book a reservation, but, as an industry worker, this is something I have never heard before.  Would I be rushed?  Might my Omakase be cut short?  What if I want dessert?  They did a very good job of instilling a sense of urgency and time into my mind (as I'm sure was intended) before even arriving at the restaurant.However, my fears were unfounded.  We arrived about 15 minutes early and were seated instantly in what I believe to be the newer area.  We sat in a luxuriously large and private booth meant to accommodate up to 6 I assume.  There were five of us and we had a TON of space to spread out.  Still feeling a little bit like we might need to hurry, we wasted no time in a ordering.  We actually ordered all of our food BEFORE discussing beverage, just to be safe.Between the five of us, four had Omakase and one ordered from the menu.  Someone (the kitchen or our server Abby) did  a wonderful job making sure that our lone ranger was fed in a way that timed very well with the rest of us eating Omakase.  So I don't have to say it over and over, we found all of our fish to be of the highest quality.I can't remember everything that I ate from the Omakase, but most of it has been previously mentioned here on yelp.  I can, however, say that we tried all but one of the daily specials.  We skipped the Lamb Pops (although I'm sure they were delicious) and started with the Scallop Sashimi, which we were told was freshly shucked, to order, from live scallops.  So clean tasting. Also we enjoyed Otoro tartare over rice with a quail egg, wasabi, some truffle and three MONSTROUS Uni lobes.  Finally the fried Aji, a mild mackerel.  So cool.  They served about 6-8 slices of Sashimi from the Aji, inside of the Aji.  The fish itself was fried, but because it has soft bones (like a softshell crab?) you can eat the whole fish.  I've had whole fish before, and I what they plate usually looks like in the end.  This was not that.  We were served a whole fish, and returned plates with no debris.  Awesome.We followed this with Omakase.  All I will say is that it feels to me like a steal.  At $60, you can't afford NOT to have it!  I would happily pay another 40-60 if Carlo and Melvin maybe added a Wagyu course, maybe used some fresh truffle instead of oil, I don't know.  I thought it was wonderful.After Omakase, we wanted to try some of the grilled skewers.  We were pretty filled up, but we had some time left on our table! Good thing we ordered quickly.  We tried the beef tongue, duck, pork belly shishito peppers.  The pepper were wonderful as well with ponzu (?) and bonito flakes.  We commented to our server that we felt the Uni was of an especially high quality and the kitchen sent for us the Escolar Pearls (oysters wrapped in escolar) each topped with another HUGE Uni lobe over a tobasco and ponzu foam as our final bite. THANKS CARLO AND MELVIN. A rich end to a rich meal.  All in all, we never felt rushed during the meal, loved everything we ate and look forward to bringing the rest of our friends back.  Everyone should hurry up and go before they get their Michelin star and Carlo and Melvin realize they are shortchanging themselves on price, because they are."
The sushi was amazing - some of the best I've had. Only a few selections for Maki rolls but they were delicious. MUST get the two Pearls apps. My only regret was not getting more Pearls.
"We have been trying to dine here for a while and finally got in on a Friday early evening. Place is small, but super cozy. We grabbed a bottle of wine just down the street and brought it in for a $5 corking fee. As recommended by our server, first timers, we went with their tasting menu. This created a very unique experience that we both enjoyed. We tried things we would've never thought of ordering.  Surprisingly, I liked the uni shooter, although I had to talk myself into trying it for the first time. The sashimi was out of this world, especially the white tuna and the portions were just right. Service was excellent, though we did feel a little rushed to finish some dishes so the next one can come out, but I guess it makes sense since they need to keep a certain pace. We walked out of there very satisfied and looking forward to going back."
"Kaizan has weird hours and if you try to make a reservation for a large group, they treat you poorly. The woman on the phone was less than courteous, informing me that it was a hardship to accommodate 8 people for dinner, and that for such a party, they require you to order the $60 chef's tasting menu. To make it easier for the chef. These cats need a lesson in customer service."
After my review.... I never received a follow up from the restaurant!??? I was looking for an apology or something... Beyond confused and repulsed by this establishment...
"Came here to celebrate with some friends. The server recommended the tasting menu, which was $60/person, telling us it was a great value for the money. The skeptic in me thought it was a great up sell, but we all opted for the tasting menu anyway. We were not disappointed. 10 courses, everything ranged from good to amazing. They were also very conscientious about all the various dietary restrictions for our party. Wonderful sushi, byob, and the private booths (if you can get them) are great!"
"Great sushi experience, felt like going to someone's home (when you visit, you will know what I mean; it looks and feels like a house) and being served with such care and importance. We did the $50 tasting menu. Each dish was a new  and fun experience. We marveled at the artistry of the presentation and dove into the delights. Each dish was paced almost perfectly.  Just as we finished one dish, enjoyed some saki and conversed, the next one arrived. A cycle repeated that at one point it seemed it would never end. The only thing stopping us was our full bellies. We had a reservation (recommended) but sat at the sushi bar, which happened to be directly in front of the both chefs. I noticed they were so interested and attentive to how we reacted to their creations, watching carefully out of the corner of their eyes. The moans, oohs and aahs brought a slight smile of great satisfaction and pride to their faces, knowing that they had succeeded in delighting us. Can't wait to return.  どうもありがとうございます Doumo arigatou gozaimasu. Thank you very much!!!"
"its in a very strange neighborhood for the kinda pricey place that it is.  however, the omakase menu was so much fun (AND SO FILLING).  we went for the omakase with all their ""greatest hits"" and enjoyed almost all of the dishes.  *favorites:  uni and oyster shooters!  *make reservations!"
"This place was fantastic - my wife an i celebrated our anniversary here and after reviewing the menu we decided to do the Chef's selection - i was totally blown away.We are sushi veterans but have never seen presentation and execution quite like this, i was actually a bit nervous when the sushi shooters came out but they were one of our favorite dishes.  our server was very easy going and informative - the plates were cleared on time and we did not ever feel rushed despite the busy restaurant.we sat at the sushi bar which was nice, the kitchen staff is friendly and very detail oriented.  i highly recommend this place."
"Listen: just do the $60 tasting menu, you will regret it if you don't. It has very unique and delicious creations that you will enjoy even if you are someone like me, who isn't very adventurous when it comes to sushi and sticks to a lot of basic rolls.Not only do you get 12 courses of food which are promptly delivered dish after dish, but it's also an incredible value.  You are probably getting over $100 worth of items by my guess.The service and decor are wonderful, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I also ordered some basic maki rolls, but I thought were maybe above-average at best, which isn't in line with the rest of the items I tried, which were exceptional.I think they focused all of their creative energy and quality on the tasting menu and let the quality of some of their basic rolls suffer.  Even though they are still quite good.  I will definitely be returning."
"There are so many sushi places in Chicago and way too many mediocre ones.  Kai Zan is definitely not one of those. It was impressive from beginning to end.  Food, service, decor, prices- Amazing. It's a very small place as mentioned in earlier reviews.  There's only a few tables and 3 booths that seat couples so it's probably not ideal for big groups but this is def a winning date spot.  Sitting at the sushi bar is highly recommended. The sushi chefs (infamous ""twins"" per prior reviews) were very attentive and made suggestions that did not disappoint.  It was fun watching them do their thing and peek at all the fresh ingredients. Food wise- Everything we had was light and palate pleasing, just as a good sushi meal should be. Don't leave without trying the ESCOLAR PEARLS. GET GET GET IT. So goooood. I'd go back for those bite-sized pieces of heaven alone. Between the 3 of us little asian girls- 2 bottles of wine, 1 app, 1 (comped!) mushroom dish,  3 rolls & 1 order of shishito peppers left us stuffed with satisfaction and amazingly, with cash to spare! Kai Zan- Thank you for reminding me that good, fresh sushi does exist in this city. I will be back!"
"Absolutely amazing. Without a doubt five stars. Intimate tables, great service and amazing food!! I read some people thought the food was rush when doing the coursed meal we didn't however. We got the omakase which was 14 courses our night. It was perfectly time. We didn't want to sit there all night!!! And for 60 bucks nonetheless, it's the best choice ever!!! Can't wait Togo back!!!"
"Great sushi, BYOB, and free street parking.All their signature sushi pieces and rolls are awesome.  If you don't want to have to pick out stuff on your own, just get the omakase and let the talented chefs surprise you!"
"While there are a few incredibly delicious bites to be enjoyed at Kai Zan, the bad outweighs the good.We chose to celebrate my brother's birthday here last night (Sat 6/21) and were seated in a cozy private booth.  Kai Zan is BYOB so we brought a few bottles of wine. Our server Chris was nice, and did his best to provide a good experience, but the philosophy of the management here is ""get in, get the hell out fast.""Three of us ordered the Omakase.  The pacing of the coursing is absurd!  We had three or four courses brought out within minutes, both hot and cold items.  There's no point in doing a tasting and exploring a restaurant's menu when the chefs insist on sending everything out in chaos without any direction or order.  We asked Chris what the deal was and he said he'd try to slow it down.  Sometimes three items at once would come out, then nothing for 20 to 30 minutes or so.  I realize this may sound a bit whiny, but again, how simple of a concept is it to allow guests to savor and reflect on each course, rather than just shove food at us like we're at a buffet?In addition to the ridiculous pacing, almost every dish had mayo on it.  In some instances it worked well, but often I felt it just distracted from what should be clean, thoughtful flavors.  The moment the last piece of sushi was eaten from our plates, they were cleared and a check was dropped.  Literally minutes after we paid, the receipts were collected, and the manager (I'm assuming, as she never introduced herself)  asked us to leave since she had other tables.  There's a tough balance for restaurants in providing a good experience to it's guests while also turning tables, but there was no tact or intelligence in this one.  The right thing to do would have been to politely give us a heads up that in a few minutes they'd need the table, and offer a remedy, such as, ""such and such bar down the street is fun, this place is good for coffee, etc..""  Kai Zan lacks tact, execution, and elegance, but not mayonaise."
Incredible - didn't care for the shooters - but the omakase was great!
"2nd time here and everything is so amazing! Service is great, the chef came out and checked on things- how wonderful!They were very accommodating as well! Will continue to come back!"
Wonderful place for authentic Japanese food! Started with a hot miso and nice salad before the fish started to roll off the bar. Sushi was true to form and delicious.  Staff was excellent and even mailed my credit card to me as I had already left town. Will definitely come back when in chicago again.
"WOW. This is the best sushi/ fresh fish fusion I have ever eaten. It is pricey, but you absolutely get your money's worth.The servers are lovely, and one of the chefs (Sam, perhaps?) is very friendly. My only complaint is that the booths (which are very private, if you are looking for that) feel a bit like a prison with their completely enclosed concrete structure. It's a little sterile for such awesome, ornate food."
"Well the secret is out so I might as well write my review.  Hands down my favorite sushi place ever which I would give 6 stars (sorry Nobu and Toro, but 5 stars is not bad).  Some places just stand out above the rest and Yelp does not have enough stars to properly differentiate the top of the pack from the rest of the pack.  I did remove some additional hype from this first paragraph so I don't have to make reservations months ahead some day.I don't know where to begin, so I'll will start with the Omakase.  Got that the first time, $60 a person, and it was a great deal with great quality food.  I won't go into details, but if you're a first timer, Just Do It.  Second time I went, I ordered more basic nigiri and maki + a few specialty items and everything was fresh and tasty as I expected.  Next time I go, I am going to order on the warmer side of the menu.  The truth is, you cannot make a mistake ordering at this place because everything is excellent.The waiter service has been top notch both times.  When you do make reservations, you do need to confirm them I believe.  You will usually get a call for confirmation the day before, and if not confirmed, a text message the day of your reservation to confirm.Luckily, it is in Humboldt Park rather than Lincoln Park, Lakeview, or Downtown, so making reservations in advance is not too ridiculous since it is a part of the city a lot of people (especially tourists) either don't know about or avoid.Lastly, it's places like Kai Zan that make me feel spoiled to live in Chicago and have access to this caliber of cuisine."
Great service.  Ambiance was superior.   Get the Chef's Choice
"Kai Zan is a great place to stop by for sushi in the city.  Street parking is easy to find.  I'd make a reservation in advance, since this place fills up fast.  The expansion to the restaurant was done beautifully down to the smallest detail.  All the dishes I have had here were carefully composed.  The ingredients are always fresh.  My favorite dishes here are: Orange Rush, Hamachi Collar, and Escolar Pearls.  A few items on their new menu I'd order again.  1. Calamari Fry: it was crispy, tender, and came with a creamy dipping sauce.  It has all the qualities I look for in an appetizer.  I could eat a whole plate of this, if calories didn't matter.  2. Mushroom Medley: a combination of 8 types of mushrooms in a light sake butter broth.3. Kai Zan Salad: Kind of like a low carb chirashi.  I would definitely order this dish again. I am not one who likes to spend 3 hours at a course meal, so the friendly quick service was perfect. I got places to go, things to see (had plans to visit the Sky Deck in Willis Tower). Will come back again soon!"
"This place is amazing and unique in the sushi elements. I had a reservation and saw a picture of an avocado specialty roll which was not on the menu. Upon asking about it, the waitress kindly took my phone and asked the chef if he could make it, he said yes! I HIGHLY recommend the Escolar, it's incredible."
"Exquisite. I'm not sure there are many other words that describe my experience here. We had the chefs special which we were so happy to do. Not only is it a ton of food, it gives such a variety of sushi and sushimi that I would have never tried any other way. The ambiance is beautiful and the staff is super friendly and helpful. Pretty much the most amazing sushi experience I've had in Chicago. Must try people!"
"Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in the city. I'm in trouble as this place is less than a mile from my apt. When we first discovered it my boyfriend and I kept switching off as Yelp Duke/Duchess because we just couldn't get enough. Sadly we have lost our reign as this restaurant has gained more of a following thanks to their Michelin star. Not to mention they have doubled in size. The food is all amazing, everything. Nothing I've ever ordered has been a disappointment. Although my boyfriend and were not the biggest fans of the tasting menu, probably because we know what we like. Our favs are the Unagi Poppers, Oyster Shooters, Orange Rush, and Escolar/Maguro Pearls. We always go for the specials. Despite their super cute two person booths, I prefer to sit at the bar here. We discovered another one of our favorite dishes- the Dynamite Mussels this way; watching the chefs sear them on the grill right in front of us. We have joked about stopping in just for the Oyster/Uni Shooters and walking out because they are just that good. Overall fantastic, and I will be back!"
"Best sushi in Chicago.  The fish is so fresh and delicious.  Seriously, the quality of the fish is amazing and the place is clean.  So happy to have found this place!"
"Amazing sushi! I have to say the best I've ever had! My husband took me here for my birthday. They were very accommodating with the fact that I had just broke my ankle the day before, so they put us in a booth too keep my foot out of the way. Everyone one was super friendly, sushi was so fresh. Amazing different combinations that I've never had. Would highly recommend the Pearls...amazing and the eel poppers but everything was wonderful! For dessert I had lava cake with sesame seed ice cream with was sooo good! Definitely will be back soon! With my comment on Good for Kids I put that I'm not sure even thou my 8 year was with us. My daughter is so use to going out for sushi and tapas. She use to it taking awhile and there is always the ipad...lol. So if they can't sit still I wouldn't recommend it."
"Smart girlfriend suggested Kai Zan for dinner.  As a restaurant manager and former oyster shucker, I have high sensitivity to how a restaurant smells and how the flow of the room translates into vibrations:  Kai Zan was the most impressive restaurant I've been to all year for these attributes.  Stepping off far West Chicago Ave, the open kitchen, four person partitioned wooden booths, two person grey banqueted booths, exposed wood, concrete and sunlight.  It smelled incredibly clean and inviting.  The server was polite and deferential and greeted us with warm hand towels.  The omikase started with shooters of briny, rich oyster, raw scallop and quail egg: we were instructed to break the tiny yolk to make it easy to swallow.  We had a steaming soup of mushroom and sesame with skewered tuna, the only miss.  This was followed by smelts, grilled to perfection and wholly edible.  Smelts are one of the best lake fish: the rule of thumb is what grows big faster is better because it has less time to absorb pollution.  We had raw crab, octopus, tuna, fried freshwater eel from China, superfresh yellowtail sashimi, grilled mussels, and resounding salmon belly.  Girlfriend said it was the best fish she's eaten in Chicago, and the best Japanese restaurant in the city.  I listen to her because she's good.  Kai Zan with good energy, delicious smells, amazing mouth-watering chef's tasting, and sparkling clean washroom called the ""Necessary Room"" is good too."
Absolutely fresh food. Had my most favorite sea urchin and sweet shrimp here. Highly recommend uni shooter and sea urchin & sweet shrimp sashimi. Everything is just perfect here. My greatest experience ever!
"I plan to write a longer, more thorough review but I had to at least give the 5 stars it deserves.  Melvin and Carlo are awesome and have done something wonderful with the small space the restaurant lives in.  They even said ""welcome back!"" when I came in last Thursday.  It's always nice when owners appreciate your business.Food is delicious, escolar and maguro pearls melt in your mouth.  If you're lucky enough to try the uni and uni/otoro tartar special, DO IT. This is a must go place and although I want Melvin and Carlo to get the business they deserve, I hope it doesn't get so busy that I can't squeeze in a reservation :)"
"Sushi at it's finest!! Not your everyday run of the mill sushi, expertly crafted, to balance flavors & unusual ingredients. The chefs are a treat to watch. Beautiful atmosphere for a date night or fun night out. I'm up for another visit soon :)."
"Never heard of Kai Zan? You're not alone. But this low key, charming Japanese restaurant is quickly on it's way to becoming my new favorite sushi joint. The decor very homey, other than the funky/cool electronic koi pond that greets you when you walk in the door.Don't miss the Escolar Pearls (rice spheres topped w/ scallion, super white tuna, truffle oil, spicy mayo, and chili oil), Orange Rush sushi (salmon, scallop w/ citrus glaze) or Angry Crab (fresh tuna, spicy crab). All three were incredible. From the April Specials Menu we tried the Fiesta Maki (tuna, salmon, jalapeno, avocado, cilantro) and Dynamite Mussel (grilled in a half shell, the most beautiful presentation of mussels I've seen) - both were fantastic as well. For dessert we ordered the green tea ice cream with red bean, which was good, but I didn't need more than a taste of it as it's more of a savory dessert. Everything that came out was absolutely beautiful and delicious, it was a perfect night.Note: Kai Zan is BYOB ONLY, so plan your wine or sake choice in advance. They have a very reasonable $5 corkage fee per table."
"Excellent meal. Order the omakase tasting menu and promptly received a steady stream of well prepared sushi/fusion courses. By the 4th course we were sort of dizzy with excitement and anticipation. We were seated at the bar and in true Japanese tradition, it was cozy and occasionally kitchen-like in atmosphere. Thankfully, the service and food was similarly focused on quality. The fish was fresh for being in the midwest. There was a nice selection of shellfish too, so the omakase menu really took us through a variety of flavors and textures.Where to begin? The pork belly with rapini was delectable. I wanted more. A lot more. The grilled smelt (nicely paired with a mushroom dashi) was that hit of fishiness that I love. You gotta eat the whole thing thing, head to tail. The red snapper with basil and olive oil was a great shout out to italian raw preparation. The truffle tuna nigiri was a subtle use of a luxury (and overpowering) ingredient. Lastly, uni shooter. Yeah, oyster shooter too but uni is my sushi kryptonite. The only time I used the soy sauce was with the maki and sashimi courses, which tells you something about how well seasoned each plate was. In fact, I could go on and describe every course mouth-watering detail but I'd like to end this review sometime in 2013. Maybe I could've loved this more if we had unagi and mackerel (aka: my other sushi kryptonites) but that's just me reaching for something negative to say. On the whole I was deeply impressed and satisfied with my meal. And so was my date.At one point, the tea kettle they were serving from broke and tea spilled all over the place. The staff couldn't have been nicer. Several members came up to see if we were okay. Everything landed on the table. No big whoop. They even offered to replace a possibly ruined plate. It wasn't. It was delicious. But it was very indicative of how they dealt with an emergency situation, which was with total professionalism. It made what was our holiday night out, special in an unexpected way. There are a lot of great sushi restaurants on Chicago Av. Kai Zan doesn't have to worry about them. Highly recommended."
"In terms of quality, it's probably my second favorite Japanese restaurant in Chicago (Katsu still reigns supreme). As for bang for your buck? This is tops and not only when it comes to Japanese food. Reservations should be done far in advance and driving is sort of necessary to reach the location. Definitely recommend booking for a party of 6 people as you will get your own booth. You receive a lot of privacy but not at the cost of service; this place is remarkable at looking after your every need. Everyone in my party got the omakase meal which I highly recommend. At $60 per person, everyone in my group was full after their meal. By comparison, pricier places downtown (cough cough Roka Akor) can barely get you an entree for that price. The omakase set menu includes skewers, soup, appetizers, sushi rolls (3 full rolls between the 5 of us!), and sashimi. Everything was very fresh and tasty and I liked how it wasn't too modern of a take on traditional fare. I was so happy I finally had the chance to visit and look forward to returning"
The other reviews are all spot on: (1) omakase is the way to go; (2) make sure you have the escolar pearls; (3) unagi poppers are as ridiculously amazing as they sound; (4) the service is questionable and they definitely want you to eat and GTFO.That sums it up.
"came here twice and got the omakase both times. do make reservations, as it'll be nice to get a more intimate booth to add to the ambiance. the omakase price is a little steep: $60. each time, though, the thoughtfulness of the flavors and presentations of each dish were not disappointing.my favorites from the chef's special were the pearls with truffle oil and the uni shooters. the pearls were incredibly delectable and truffle oil sauce added such a deep richness that i loved. we have a word for such a flavor in korean, but i'm not so sure how to translate it in english. perhaps savory is the best term for it. there's a subtle spice that helps to balance out the richness.the uni shooters were outstanding. at first gulp, you get the rich creaminess of the yolk and uni. add a little citrus tang from the ponzu. then, there's a hint of spice from the tabasco. the black roe atop most of the pieces is money. i love them. my friend wisely articulated them as ""balls of flavor"". this is, perhaps, the best sushi experience i've ever had."
"For Chicago, this is some of the best sushi I have ever had. Highly recommend!"
"Rarely do I give out five star reviews. It's not because I'm an elitist or speaking out of ignorance - like some reviewers like to do. Rather, it's because I'm a simple gal who has always been taught the value of quality service (thanks, mama!), and I've been fortunate enough to know what fresh ingredients taste like. Since I've also traveled all over, studying and absorbing different cultures, I'd say that my palate is also fairly astute and diverse.That said, Kai Zan is phenomenal. It delivers on all fronts with its friendly, knowledgable, and courteous wait staff to Japanese inspired dishes that are innovative and simply put, damn good. With its uber intimate interior, make sure you make reservations because it caps off close to 27 seats - though I've heard they are expanding its dining area. With its cozy setting, Kai Zan is better suited as a date spot instead of a large group of folks ready to rage. Take that business elsewhere in Chicago, like Sunda or Roka.Once you settle in, you'll be in for a culinary treat as your appetite is taken on a culinary euphoria that balances textures with delightful flavor profiles. A few favorites include the Orange Rush, Gomae, Zuke, Escolar Pearls, of course my personal fave and also something that's flown in thrice weekly is the uni. Melt in your mouth delicious. So, go. Eat, drink and be merry. Give a big ""Kampai"" to Melvin and Carlo. Just make sure you come hungry because you'll want to order everything on the menu. You've been forewarned :)"
I'm afraid to say how much I like this place bc then more people will go and I won't be able to get a table! Haha. First things first- it's byob so don't forget to bring yo own booze. In fact there is a really great liquor store right across the street we go there every time we go. The consistency is what I appreciate most about this place. We've gone and had the omekase every time and every time I have to unbutton my pants bc I'm full but a satisfied full with a big smile on my face!   Can't wait to go back!!
"My husband and I we both love sushi so we decide to give this place a try.First, our server was not good.Second, the food was pretty blend. tempura was really soggy not crispy.price was over price.Overall,Sorry Kai Zan, we won't be back."
"I am still impressed with the quality of the food they serve here. I am in love with the Green Monster roll, Uni, angry crab, and anything they serve. The thought of this place still makes my mouth water."
"So this is one of my new favorites - I've been here at least 5 times in the last 6 months.  It's not because it's the most authentic, because it's truly not.  The escolar balls, the orange rush, danielle (aforementioned three of our favorites) and their other sushi/sashimi bites and various grilled and raw options, all have an ingenious little twist from the standard sushi fare - but it's awesome.  I am the last person to endorse a sushi place that caters too much to sauces and pairings, but when the flavor combination is this good, you know that the sub-standard fish is not hiding behind the flavored mayo but it is taking that fresh fish to another level. On top of all of that, it is byob!  Bring a quality white to go with the quality fish, and you won't regret it!"
"We showed up a little before 8pm on a Monday night and were told we couldn't be seated until 8:30 - 8:45. We ended getting sat around 8:20 in a nice booth by the window.Our server was lovely and all the specials sounded amazing. We couldn't decide between everything and ended up doing the Omakase menu. 12 courses, but it really felt like 20 with all the different little bites. AMAZING!! Everything was delicious and well portioned so at the end we still had room for dessert. I had the chocolate lava cake and it was super soft and moist with great chocolatey flavor. Hands down fantastic service, food, and atmosphere.When we left, I texted all my sushi enthusiast friends and told them they MUST try it.The tasting menu was great because we tried many different things at a great price. Considering how much sushi I like to eat, I definitely would have spent that much, or more a la carte, and gotten less food for it.DELICIOUS! Great job, Kai Zan."
"I am in complete awe of this amazing eatery west of Western where I would never in my life have expected such a unique and upscale Japanese menu.BYOB = awesomesauceGo for the omakase if it's your first time - an exceptional value for all the delightful treasures this kitchen puts out.Finally tried uni for the first time in my life - the shooter was a zinger! As was the oyster one ..My favorite dish was a toss-up between the escolar/maguro pearls and the fighting kani (which we ordered seconds of).The rolls were delicious and one of the last few plates was a a ""sampler"" with a total high and low - high being the perfect octopus salad (which was so fitting after the Hawks clinched) and low being the jalapeno popper - just not my cup of tea.The mussel was gigantic with great flavor profile but mine was so gritty that I couldn't really enjoy it :-(Sad that I'm moving because this was the perfect place to experience so many new ingredients and dishes that I normally wouldn't order off the menu - well done Kai Zan and welcome to the west side!"
"Took my mom here for her bday. For a Tuesday early dinner we still need a reservation. The place is teeny tiny but feels airy and light. Our server was awesome and the food was killer. Took other yelpers advice and got the Escolar Pearls. I can't wait to get them again. The oyster shooters with quail egg and fly fish roe was also great. There's a ton on the menu I can't wait to go back for. I am treating my boyfriend to this place next week, mostly cuz I want more for myself!"
"Wow, what a deal, $50 for Omakase??? Gotta do that!!!"
"Absolutely the best sushi in ChicagoCreative, balanced flavors accompany the best quality fish.  Omakase is a fantastic way to sample best of menu."
"Cool take on escolar. Rare. And very tasty. Well, as they say: sake happens."
Kai Zan is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! The food is fantastic and the ambiance is perfect for a tiny BYOB.  I've had the chef's tasting menu and I've ordered off the menu a la carte. I even grab food to go when I'm feeling lazy.  The staff has only gotten better with time.  This is great place for a foodie who doesn't want to break the bank! This restaurant is making my neighborhood a better place to live and visit! Thanks so much Kai Zan- you guys are killing it!
"My kind of place!charming, intimate, and (my favorite) unpretentious. Most importantly, exquisite! By far, best sushi experience we've had in a while! not only for their one of a kind menu options, but the service is also worth mentioning. they truly enhanced our experience. Brandon even suggested a few options which ended up being our favorite bites of the night. We will definitely be returning. This time, with friends and family. Not all at the same time, the place is very small. oh, and don't forget, its byob."
"The sushi was very good, but the service from the hostess completely got us started on the wrong foot.  I got there first of my friends & was not greeted with a ""hello,"" immediately I was asked if I had a reservation.  Then was told there was no reservation under my friend's name, & that they had a table for us but that they needed it back at 9:00 PM.  Fine.  When my friend arrived, she was shocked to hear there was no reservation since they took her credit card # when she made it & said they'd charge for a no-show, &  she even had a saved voicemail from them confirming the reservation.  The hostess told her they found us a table, but that they'd need it back at 9:00 PM.  When the waiter came over to our table, he asked if we knew that they needed the table back at 8:45 PM.  Jeez.  Contrary to some other people, apparently, it doesn't elevate my dining experience to be treated like a bother.  I'm happy to spend my money elsewhere."
"We went last night for the omakase. was not planned, just happened to think omakase would be a great idea for $50. and it was a LOT of food.service is sketchy. our server spoke to low and i could barely hear what was on the plate. shooters, uni in broth, steamed scallop, sashimi, escolar pearls, eel tempura, and a huge range of other things that i can no longer remember.for the size of restaurant, cleanliness, quality of food it is excellent. none of the fish had an aftertaste."
"I've got a new favorite sushi spot!!! We winged it on a Sat night with no reservatin at 6:15 and snagged a spot at sushi bar. We were watching them make all these amazing dishes that I didn't see on the menu only to find they were part of the omakase menu. We had already ordered but next time for sure. Green Monster and Orange Rush were amazing. And we did some tuna, salmon, hamachi, and escolar that were all super fresh and great cuts. And how could I forget the escolar pearls? And we had a few skewers of scallops and shrimp as well.All-in-all fantastic."
"This was a mixed experience. Great booths and service. Prompter than many other sushi places I've seen - the meal didn't drag on at all. Most of the dishes were pretty good. But for a place of this caliber, pretty good just doesn't quite cut it. There was nothing I really disliked, but there was also nothing that truly blew me away. All the fish was fresh and prepared with attention. Kai Zan simply doesn't live up to its billing and can't match some of the other places that focus on this style (such as Cherry in NYC)."
"This really was a great place to go and eat. I went with two of my friends and ordered the omakase (chef's choice). And the chef's didn't disappoint.  Everything was put in great presentation. The fish was very good and fresh (considering that this is the midwest, this is super awesome) and the UNI. Oh the UNI, just was delight to eat. I had to order more. The experience was just so pleasant and it started with great service from the hosts and chefs which came by all the tables. They love making sushi and it shows. I highly recommend this place to anyone. It's worth the price. It's a bit small, but I like that. Please take the time and enjoy Kai Zan.  I will be going again soon."
"First time? Omakase tasting menu is the way to go. And If your worried about reservations, go during the week so you can skip a long wait or crampy crowd.As I walked in our server immediately addressed the beer we brought and put the six pack on ice and cracked our bomber of barley wine. I appreciate that kind of attentiveness, sometimes your beverages get ignored at BYOB spots. So THANK YOU!The Omakase menu is the chef's creation, which is a solid way to explore the menu and even some off menu items. Some highlights were the Escolar and Maguro Pearls, Oyster and Uni Shooters (raw quail egg in oyster shooter, OH YEAH!), Dynamite Mussels, Smoked Oyster wrapped in salmon, Octopus Salad, and countless and flawless pieces beautiful sushi with more components than I can ever remember. There vanilla ice cream and mango pudding were delicious as well. Kai Zan provides incredibly fresh, clean, and beautifully crafted food. The portions, progression, and value of the Omakase menu are perfect. This is perhaps one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. Some final quick tips: Nevada's across the street has a great beer selection for your last minute BYOB needs, plenty of FREE parking can be found on Chicago, and biggest tip is to GET YOUR BOOTY IN HERE IMMEDIATELY!!!"
"One of the best meals I've ever had and I cannot wait to go back.My friend made reservations for a large party there, which is kind of hard to do due to the seating arrangements. We insisted on all of us sitting together quite cozily in the front. None of us seemed to mind or care - we wanted to be together and not divide up. Almost all of us ate the Omekase menu and each dish was more amazing than the previous. Service was great and the chefs are super kind. I appreciate them tolerating us rowdy folks."
"I made reservations for the fella's birthday back at the end of November. I've been dying to return ever since. We opted for the omakase. Our server asked if there was anything that we'd like them to stay away from. I mentioned my hatred of cilantro (devil lettuce) and she said she'd inform the chefs, but other than that, chef's choice. She assured me that the fan favorites that I heard so much about would be a part of the menu. I was specifically looking for the escolar pearls. Man, those were amazing. As was everything else. We were so impressed that after we reached our $50 worth, we opted for one last course, even though we were stuffed. The service was pretty spot on. We were seated immediately. Courses were evenly timed. Each course was described in detail. One of the chefs came by and chatted us up for a bit. Overall our experience was lovely AND my fella thinks I'm awesome!I received a book on the art of sushi making for Christmas. Now I have an excuse to return sooner than later. I am going to sit at the sushi bar so that I can watch the masters in action. I'm also going to bring  ""kitchen beers"", because dammit, these dudes deserve it."
"There are very few things in the world I love more than seafood.(I am allowed to say that; I don't have children. My pets don't count, I cannot eat them. Yet. OK: The husband has a place up there as well.)Hearing glowing review after glowing review of Kai Zan left me filled with envy, anticipation and the very distinctive mouth tingling accompanied by the slightest surge of saliva that occurs when you think of something you really, really, really want to eat.I am sure you know what I mean.Well, ladies and gents, Kai Zan didn't disappoint on any account.I knew it was BYOB; I brought a lovely bottle of Pouilly Fuissé (one of my French faves; a Burgundy Chardonnay in translation) that pairs perfectly well with fish and holds up to the stong-profiled flavors of soy sauce.I knew it was small; my friend made a reservation for 6 pm. We were sitting at the counter; it was roomy, comfortable and manned by the very efficient Michelle who did an excellent job all throughout.But yes, it is SMALL. Think of it, and divide the size by two. That small.I knew it was delicious. And my, oh my....Specials are always a safe bet in a restaurant; they highlight the best of what's available that day. Kai Zan is no exception. So be attentive when the waiting staff explains them to you at the beginning of your meal, 'cause you don't want to miss, for example, a plump kumamoto oyster served as a shot with a raw quail egg, scallions and ponzu sauce. Or the uni and toro tartar concoction that you spread yourself on nori if you can resist eating the whole thing with a spoon (provided. You don't have to bring your own.)These two dishes blew up my mind, as well as my taste buds. Rich, flavorful, complex but also subdued in a way that let each ingredient shine while combining superbly with each other.A rare experience.Another great surprise was the bite-size kushi skewers; the shitake-ponzu one should illustrate ""umami"" in a dictionary. The best $3 spent on food in your life. It totally beat the crap of the scallop-onion one, and God knows I love scallops. Fact: Mushroom are definitely magic, with or without hallucinatory proprieties.You will also find more traditional sushi and sashimi, a few rolls and a couple of cooked dishes such as yaki, noodles and cooked protein for the non-raw eaters. But if you come here, you should really stick to the creatures of the sea because it's what they do.And they do it pretty damn fucking well.And yes, it totally requires the emphatic swearing."
"This place has great sushi but it was completely misleading.My boyfriend and I came in with no reservation (which I recommend making in advance since there are 5 booths and the sushi bar) we were told there was a reservation coming in so we had 45 min to eat which was completely fine with us.We had ordered miso soup which was great! the special, steal head trout which could of been better and we also ordered the shrimp and cucumber roll which had 8 pieces in it and another $8 roll (only had 2 pieces). We were very confused about the portion sizes since the server never specified. After our measly dinner, we were both completely unsatisfied, we had gone home and made more food.  Overall this place is nicely decorated and the concepts are well thought out but I will not be returning to Kai Zan."
"I almost don't want to tell people about this place it's so good.  There are only like 18 tables so make a reservation.  It's really tight in there but totally worth it.  The sushi is really tasty and unique!  It's expensive, but makes up for the cost of the food b/c it's BYOB!  There's a liquor store on the corner that sells sake too!"
"Want to know the next hot sushi spot in Chicago that you won't be able to get into? Kai Zan - out in Humbolt Park on Chicago ave. Simply put, it has all the right ingredients (pun intended) to go viral and cultish. It's small (like 20 seats), awesome decor, BYO, off the beaten path, and happens to serve delicious food that's not your typical maki roll from Dominicks. And it's crazy affordable. Not much else you need to score big.The meal started off with a bang by ordering the Escolar Pearls  (rice spheres topped with scallions and super white tuna soaked in soy sauce, truffle oil, spicy mayo, and chili oil, then lightly seared), and sides of edamame and gomae. The pearls of little rice with amazing flavors on top were so good and had four pieces for the three of us that we need another order. Easy call. Delicious. We all said we could come back for a meal entirely of Pearls (there's Maguro too, for variety).We followed the pearls with some sushi/sashimi. I believe we ordered some hamachi sashimi (not 100% on that), the flaming tuna roll and the orange rush sushi. The sashimi was nice but a little fatty/tough for my preference. Light sauce was very nice. Loved the flaming tuna, had a lot of fun items and nice texture variety. Really nice. Finally, the orange rush gives the pearls a run for their money for favorite of the meal. It's served on a single shell, and is a one bite show. There's scallop on some rice entirely wrapped in salmon with a nice citrus glaze. Big fan, would order again and multiple. We also tried some of the yakatori to get a little variety and try the menu. We had the chicken, shrimp and beef. Everything was nice and flavorful (though I'd stick with the amazing fish), and the shrimp was the best and most interesting option (and really cool presentation). We weren't hungry for more but also wasn't completely full and wanted to extend our experience. We asked for a chef's surprise and they brought us three huge pieces of fatty salmon belly (something only offered on the tasting menu). It was really nice, definitely fatty (in a good way) and super generous portion. A great way to end the meal.I very much look forward to getting back to try more items and some of my favorites. The BYO is just icing on the cake (liquor store across the street) and the bill was remarkable ($35/person). The space is cool, intimate and fun with great food and value. It's the next hot spot."
"This is some of the freshest sushi I've had in Chicago.  Kai Zan is really small, so it's nearly impossible to get a last minute reservation (or make a reservation change) and the location is a little off the beaten path, but it's definitely worth the trouble! I went with a friend on a Monday night and the place was completely full at 10pm (which admittedly might not be saying a ton because of how small it is). Kai Zan had been recommended to each of us recently, so we figured it was a must try...and we were definitely glad we did!We didn't order the Chef's tasting menu, but it came highly recommended by my friend and our server, so I'd definitely like to order it next time I'm there. We ordered a ton of items off the menu instead and some of our favorites were the escolar pearls appetizer and the angry crab sushi. The seasonal hamachi was also delicious. You can't go wrong with any of the nigiri, but the steelhead trout special was some of the most buttery, tender nigiri I've ever had. I love that Kai Zan's menu has really inventive flavor combinations that don't overpower the fish. If you like your rolls huge, deep fried, and with a lot of spicy mayo - this is not the place to go!This place only serves water and green tea, so the BYOB policy applies to just about every type of beverage, which means you get to spend all your hard earned money on some excellent sushi instead of booze :)While I had a great experience,  I can see why some Yelpers mention a pretentious wait staff. I got a little bit of that vibe when we asked for our server's recommendations, but nothing so over the top that it spoiled our meal."
Great sushi.  Now serving wine. Cant wait to go back favorite neighborhood sushi in Chicago.
"Great BYOB sushi spot in quiet west neighborhood that is becoming more well known everyday.  They recently expanded to allow for increased capacity and larger groups. Inventive menu, don't be shy! Orange Crush and the Pearls are my favorite. Never seen anything like these mussels before, you have to try!Great spot for groups, can bring own booze and keep the price much lower than in wicker park or river north."
This place is AMAZING!!!! You have to do the Chiefs Choice!! Everything was incredible!! Definitely coming back again!
"I had an inauspicious start here - called on three separate days to make a reservation, but no one answered during business hours.  Decided to risk it and showed up 5pm Sat, but of course they were completely booked (they said their phone was broken.....whatever).  Ended up making a reservation for SundayTwo of us ordered the omakase and I chose to a la carte it.  The most memorable: Angry Crab ($8) - spicy tongarashi crab wrapped in tunaEscolar Pearls ($8), Uni and Otoro Special - uni, otoro, quail egg, watercress and other delicious seasonings over a bed of rice with nori on the side to make small handrolls.The snapper and steelhead trout were also quite good in both the nigiri and sashimi forms. Things to pass on - Kushi Lava Rock Charbroil - beef, scallop, enoki in bacon ($4 - all quite bland)I didn't try the teppan yaki part of the menu (e.g. yakisoba or teriyaki) but their hot foods were below average for me...sorry!BYOB $5 corkageThe mango pudding with whipped cream ($4) is made in house and was a wonderful end to the meal.  For first timers, get the omakase!  For this price (~$50 ea), this has got to be hands-down, one of the best places in the city."
Excellent sushi!  Super fast and attentive wait staff.  Ran into heavy traffic and were late by 45 minutes which they had no problem accommodating.  Had to rush to make a concert and they pushed the food out quickly and we made the showtime with no problem.
The best sushi I ever had! Everything is fresh and amazing! Nice presentation! Foods are out of my expectation! Absolutely I will go back again!! Sooooo good! The price is totally worth it!
"In summary: One of the best sushi options in Chicago, but the reservation process is a bit of a disasterThings we've tried: Maguro and Escolar pearls. Orange rush. Flaming tuna. Green Monster. Fresh, unique and made with attention to detail. Everything was delicious.Reservation system: It's been a bit of a logistical nightmare; twice now. First time we were told that they had a table for us, but to our surprise we had to wait an extra hour for it. The second time, we were promptly provided with our table but were given a time limit of how long we can keep it (about 60 minutes). Not a fan of that policy. Perhaps adding a delivery service would be a way to make up for the lack of seating.In conclusion: Completely worth the visit despite the limited seating and reservation quirks. The quality of the food is top notch."
"Do yourself a favor and reserve a table at the best sushi joint in Chicago. Our favorites: Danielle. Orange Rush, Green Monster, Flaming Tuna, & Angry Crab."
Amazing specialty roles and the dessert is delicious! Very intimate setting with great music and very kind staff. A great date spot
"Third times a charm. After I left a negative, but accurate review for Kai Zan's reservation process, someone messaged me from the restaurant and said to come in for a free meal with a friend. I felt slightly odd cashing in on the offer, but took my best friend to see what the hype at Kai Zan was all about. My strongest recommendation is for you, dear reader, to find a way to go. I thought the food was absolutely amazing. My friend and I both decided to go for the Omakase and we were beyond delighted. We were filled to the brim on $50 worth of food (not including tax or tip).  Highlights were the - Gyu Tongue Kushi- Fiesta Maki- Dynamite Mussels- Oyster shooters- Tofu in brothI can't wait to go back. Making reservation now."
"The food was good but the experience I was bad I appriciate the sushi cheifs stand all day hard work. I think they have a great business though, the hours are open til 11pm friday, the hostess at the door when we just 2 people, arrived at10:45 informed they where calling last call ,well we disputed the hours. We drove into humbolt park neighborhood to specifically go there, she said she will ask and they let us in, I have been dieing to go there etc..... but that entrance made for a unwelcomed vibe, we should of left! The hostess was heard telling the chief ""I told them we where closed"". Too bad to conduct business like that is terrible.  Change the hours then.  Again that hostess was rude."
"Wow. This is the type of restaurant that will ruin other restaurants for you.  It was seriously life-changing.It's true, the escolar pearls and orange rush were really good.. however for both myself and my boyfriend, the ultimate star was their mussels appetizer. I'm not sure if it's on their menu year-round but if you see it, try it!"
"very limited seating of 22 (if that!), definitely need reservations!loved the chef special rolls, but the maki rolls were so small and normal. the fish is very fresh and creatively presented with out the different kind of sauces that covers up all the fish! will come back for affordable fresh fish!"
Amazing. The booths are really nice and private. The service was quick and attentive. BYOB so that's another plus and the fish is extremely fresh and very flavorful. Highly recommended.
"Felt fortunate enough to get a prime time Friday reservation and after recommendations was very excited to go. The recommendations were right on. We took the Omakase and was a great selection off the menu. It was also great to sit on the kitchen bar and watch these guys work. The food was awesome, from the escolar to the scallop shooters, to this pepper popper and the sashimi at the end. The only down sides, the place is cramped. I'm a big boy but I don't sit on multiple chairs. I was bumped into constantly which got pretty annoying about half way thru the meal. Also, the price... eh... It was good, but was it $60 good? I'm not so sure. So its a great experience, go if you can, and if you do, request a booth...Cheers"
The Chef's Omakase tasting selection is insanely good for $60.  Everything here is incredible.  Can't wait to go back.
"My wife and I have been to all the sushi places in the city and Kai Zan is hands down amazing! Hip area, beautiful space and an outstanding dinner! Will be back many more times and this us a must try!"
"Ohhh amazing!  I consider myself a sushi junkie and this place has changed the way I see sushi forever.  The service is wonderful, the sushi,  while a little higher price than other places,  is soo delicious.  The angry crab is pure heaven. It's byob and not great for groups larger than 4-6 and I'd stick to 2-4. Definitely worth the trip no matter where your coming from but make sure you make a reservation, especially if you have a long drive."
"we got the ""chef's choice"" which was mostly good ... there were some things I didn't care for : there was a shooter with a quail egg and raw oyster and some chile oil and some other things I can't remember. Our waiter told us to shoot the whole thing which was way too much to take .. I did't like all the raw textures together. I ate the seafood out of the serving dish, but left the quail egg. (I couldn't eat the raw egg) and it was a pretty awkward, b/c we were sitting at the bar, right in front of the chef's (owner I believe) who make the food and they seemed unhappy they I didn't eat it. I definitely got a weird vibe from that. Overall I didn't really like sitting at the bar, I felt like I was being watched what I ate pretty closely and they weren't the friendliest guys, which is fine, but it was just a strange vibe. Our waiter was very nice, and explained everything very nicely and recommend a nice wine and sake. I really enjoyed the nigiri, very fresh and there was also a mussel dish that was delicious. The food was fresh and the restaurant cozy but I just wasn't crazy about my experience. I prefer Arami. But definitely worth a visit."
"4.5 starsI have long awaited my visit to Kai Zan! Attempt #1 was foiled by lack of reservations. Lesson learned! Tiny restaurant good for sizes of 2. Also BYOB as well with small corkage fee. Seriously, amazing sushi and BYOB are my two favorite combinations.The tasting menu was legit. This place is the fancy sushi dressed up with creative truffled fireworks. But the simpler seared sashimis were buttery and phenomenal themselves. Beautiful presentation, but slightly rushed service.The tasting menu was so much fun since you get to try SO many different pieces of sushi and they include a lot of the specials. My favorites from the tasting menu were the salmon wrapped tuna and escolar with truffle oil, seared salmon sashimi, and the fatty yellowtail. The sashimi was so buttery and creamy--- it just melted in your mouth in a sushi explosion.My least favorite was the wasabi tako (octopus)-- To be fair, I do despise tako because it's often a filler on sashimi platters, but I gave it a chance. Way too much wasabi! It'll clear your sinuses unpleasantly. I also wasn't a fan of the shooter in the beginning-- very vinegary. Overall, a new sushi favorite in Chicago!"
"Oh hai!!!! Welcome to the neighborhood, Kai Zan. How I love you so very much!!!! I noticed that there's a new restaurant opened up next to Komoda but I wasn't very sure what type of restaurant it is. One day, after doing some work from Star Lounge, my boyfriend and i tried to come in for dinner. Sadly, it was about an hour of a wait and we can't wait that long :( so, the next day, i called in to make a reservations and 7pm right on time, when we walked in. we were seated at the booth, cool waters and hot towels were ready for us :) Our server.... Shame on me for not remembering his name was super nice and friendly. He introduced himself and asked if this is the first time we were there and showed us the yummiest items on the menu. And so, we had the Escolar Pearl, which is AMAZINGLY YUMMY!!!! It's a must try!!! The chicken karaage was also very delicious. We tried a few of the Omakase which also very very good and fresh. We had the green monster roll and the Angry Crab. Yum!!! Everything was very delicious. We tried the skewers but weren't very impressed by it, but that didin't ruined it at all. I am just happy to know that there's delicious sushi spot a block away from where I live. All the servers are very attentive and friendly. The place is too adorable. It's really small but very cozy and lovely. You can't come in a big group because on how small the place is and make sure you call in ahead of time for a reservation. I love everything about this place and definitely will be back sooner than later :)"
"Omakase all the way.  My brother lives by here and  told me about the omakase, but unfortunately for him his wife is not as adventurous with food so they ordered off the menu.  The only downfall which is minor is that we were sat right next to the window so any time the door opened it was cold, but a small price to pay for the phenomenal culinary experience.  The ambiance of the restaurant is ideal--I kind of felt like I was at a spa.  Great for date night and you can't beat the quality, creativity and presentation of the food.  Will definitely be going back!"
"Best Sushi ever. This place is amazing. Try both the pearls, angry crab and orange rush. Make a reservation. Enough said!"
"I am a huge fan of sushi and so when my foodie friend told me about Kai Zan and showed me the delectable pictures of uni nigiri I immediately made room in my schedule and prepared myself for lots of uni.But then we got there and could NOT find parking for the longest time. It was terrible---we ended up being 15 minutes late and they told us that we only had an hour and 15 minutes left to eat and so we better hurry. We had known about the hour and a half policy and tried our hardest to be on time but traffic and parking had worked against us that day. So we started out our meal totally frazzled and squeezed ourselves into the bar where my friend proceeded to order the omakase (because it looked delicious and didn't require making more decisions based on our time restraints). It was a lot of food and she really enjoyed it. Her favorites were definitely the amazing mussels that were broiled with some kind of sauce and the angry crab and orange rush sushi. I agreed with all of these assessments since the angry crab and orange rush were basically perfect little bites of food (their special nigiri) that were packed with flavor! I also loved the maguro pearls and escolar pearls. We were both disappointed to hear that they were out of uni that night but we still ended up having a delicious meal. The sushi was very fresh and cut well but a lot of the flavors seemed to keep repeating themselves (seemed to be a reliance on truffle oil and spicy mayo (though in moderation). Also we definitely kept checking our watches to see when we would get ""kicked out"". What made this more frustrating was the fact that our server disappeared for a long time near the later part of our meal and we were trying to order dessert while we still had time. But then when she returned she told us not to worry about going over our time and brought out our desserts with only 5 minutes of our hour and 15 remaining. So that was nice but we definitely would have preferred them to reassure us that there would be enough time since we felt rushed the whole meal..."
"LOVE this place!  It's small and so make reservations ahead of time, not great for large groups but a perfect date spot!DEF recommend the Omisake chef's multi-course option, everything was amazing!  My favorites:  Escolar Pearls (I could eat five dishes of these!), Zuke & Creamy Roll!  I'd pass on the fried stuff, just meh.  Was so full after the meal, a great deal!Try to get a seat at the sushi bar, it's so fun talking to Melvin and Carlos, they're great!"
"Definitely 4.5 stars, rounding up.RIght up there with one of the best sushi/japanese spots in chicago - not your run-of-the-mill, japanese and then some thai dishes on the side (blah).Finally swung by to experience this sleeper of a japanese concept on the border of ukranian village and humboldt park.  DESERVES ALL THE HYPE.Usually would not want to advertise it, but I feel this spot needs a push because on a Sunday evening, the restaurant was quiet and half-full (and its quite a small space as it is).   The space was very cozy and ""zen"".  We tried the omakase, which IMO is quite a good value for the quality and variety of food.  We went for two more rounds beyond the standard $50 which was enough to fill me up.Omakase starts with a best-of appetizer line-up and various raw sushi components following.  Wish there was more of a true progression, but it was all very tasty, so I guess I don't really care.What we loved:Maguro pearls - perfect small bite of sushi and flavorAngry crab sushi - soft texture of sushi wrapping flavor packed spicy craball the Uni dishes - uni with king crab, uni on seared yellow tail and straight up uni on rice AMAZING!Salmon belly & hamachi belly:  the salmon lightly dressed and succulent, the hamachi served straight up and perfectly buttery and fresh.Salmon wrapping scallop:  can't go wrong with this comboThe fish quality here is really great, not a step wrongI would say the cuisine is taking fresh sushi and putting a special twist on the sauces and flavoring.  the combinations of proteins where just decadent and much appreciated (salmon + scallop, tuna + crab, hamachi + uni, king crab + uni, YUM).Definitely coming back and bringing friends!"
"Upon entering you are transported to a wonderful, curated world that feels decidedly modern and Japanese.  Our lovely, small booth was perfect for two and elicited excited exclamations from my sister ""the patterns, the flowers, the coziness""- as it was her birthday, I was delighted!  The specials  - all of them too intriguing to pass up...at once complex, intricate and deliciously simple.   Our dinner was unhurried, perfectly timed and of the highest quality.  You know it's going to be good when the Chefs and waitstaff check in on you excitedly - wondering what you thought. Each item selected was balanced and worthy of a repeat.  Obviously, I was blown away. Reminiscent of Uchiko in Austin.  These dishes were not ""experimental"", rather very intentionally developed over time to leave you wanting more. BYOB.  Small, tiny really.  Plan ahead, make a reservation and prepare to be delighted."
"I use Yelp regularly for recommendations, but only write reviews if I am blown away (good or bad).  This place BLEW ME AWAY!  I have never tasted anything quite like the dishes they prepared and presented.  My husband and I ordered the chef's tasting menu (""omakase"") and I am so glad we did.  We got to sample so many amazing creations such as oyster and quail egg shooters, a caramelized scallop skewer, and chocolate lava cake with black sesame seed ice cream (I think!).  These are just a few of the creative and perfectly executed tastings that were placed before us.  This is a must for everyone to try - sushi lover or not.  In fact, the sushi is a mere filler on a menu like this!GO!!!!!"
Best sushi of my life.
"Look, all I can tell you is that I rarely give 5 stars.  This place is as good as it gets in Chicago.  It's that damn good.  Go, NOW, before you die... your soul will wander the spirit world forever if you don't go, haunting your family, wondering WHY DIDN'T I GO TO KAI ZAN FOR THE BEST DAMN SUSHI IN CHICAGO?  WHY? WHYYYY????  It ain't cheap, but great fresh seafood never is."
"New age/fusion sushi rarely works for me, but I can't help but admit that I was very impressed by the innovation flavors. The chefs here are very, very talented.First thing's first, make a reservation before coming here. This place is SMALL (ironic how I'm using large caps to say it's small). There were about 8 seats at the sushi bar, then there were 6 or 7 other small tables. We got lucky when they seated us without a reservation on a Monday night. With that said, I think small works for this place. The intimate setting, the friendliness of the staff & chefs, and being able to watch the chefs cook in front of you reminds me of Japanese izakayas.A very cool thing this place offers is the option of having the chef design a menu just for you by giving them a price range of how much you are willing to spend. I didn't try it this time because others wanted very specific things off the menu, but I am planning to try that next time based on the wonderful flavor we experienced here. There are many, many other places that charge much more for sushi that just taste really crappy...don't waste your money at those places. Though Yelp has this @ $$$, the pricing is really $$ and a half...very, very affordable. (plan on spending $50 - $75 a person here)."
"What can I say.... My girlfriend and I were looking to get sushi yesterday and the usual place was closed. I remembered driving past Kai Zan on my way home a few times (We are right up the street) and I always wanted to check it out. I called at about 3:30 to make a reservation  and showed up later that evening with a bottle of wine in tow. First and foremost... I would suggest making a reservation as this place only seats a handful of guests. Once that hurdle is passed, prepare yourself for some of the best sushi in Chicago. We were greeted by a very friendly wait staff who knew the menu (small) very well. Our waitress had a few suggestions that we tried as well as other things that looked appealing to us. The chef gave us a complimentary appetizer that was to die for. Fatty tuna with truffle oil. Can you go wrong??? The food was OUTSTANDING, the chefs are great, the waitstaff is stellar, and the prices are unbeatable. Our bill was $63 with a corking fee and we left stuffed. We have found our new sushi staple. Thanks Kai Zan!!!"
"Love the layout and the convenience near my stomping grounds. The sushi is presented like art. The rolls are delicious and cheap. Skewers are great, especially the scallop one. Byob. Will definitely be back regularly."
"So good. Had the chef's choice menu last night and enjoyed everything I ate.  Definitely should be on everyone's list and worth making a reservation in advance. Staff was nice and not pretentious at all for someone who had little japanese/sushi ordering experience. Fried oysters, some type of mussel/quail egg shooter (i think), angry crab were just some of the items on the chef's choice menu that stood out. if you go the chef's choice route, definitely do not snack beforehand. was left feeling very full but was worth it."
"The omakase menu here is easily the best, and by far the best priced sushi around. A true tasting of everything that they make, and not one of the courses was disappointing. Go with an appetite, because by the 10th course you'll be stuffed! The service is a little rushed, but I think that's because the restaurant is so small so they want to get people in and out, but that is the only negative thing I can say about the restaurant. Its a must for any out of town guests you want to take for a fancy (yet affordable) meal!"
"I feel bad about this review because we met one of the young owner/chefs at the end of our meal and he seemed like a great guy who probably really knows what he is doing as a chef but it seems clear that what Kai Zan is lacking is a business manager.  Our visit was for a birthday and thank God it was not the actual day of birthday meal but just part of the ""birthday weekend"".  To start, they need to get much better organized with reservation confirmation.  I was contacted three times by seemingly three different systems to ""confirm"" my reservation:  by phone (by a rather surly woman) the day before, by email the morning of, and by text about two hours before the meal (so, not a fan of ""seatme.com"" which I assume is a cheaper alternative to OpenTable).  Asking me to confirm my reservation three times is completely ridiculous.The surly problem continued upon our arrival.  We were unfortunately stuck with a young, brooding fellow who was just about the most uncommunicative and seemingly unhappy person to be waiting tables that we have ever encountered (and we eat out a LOT).  We could barely understand what he was saying because he spoke so quietly (when he spoke at all) and we felt like we were putting him out with our every request...like keeping our water glasses full.  He really set the tone for the entire meal and may have single-handedly helped to color our experience to be as bad as it seemed.  He was either really having a bad day or should consider some other occupation...for sure the restaurants management should help him with this revelation either way.This problem of keeping our water glasses full leads me to our next problem.  Why is it in this great food city of ours that so many new restaurants these days think that it is cool to be BYOB.  It is not cool...it may be trendy...but what it really is:  cheap!  OK the fact that we showed up without the sake bottles that we had in the hotel room was my fault.  I missed that it was BYOB.  So, this is truly mea culpa.  However, I really do not want to have to remember whether I need to bring my own sake or not...and sushi simply is not the same without sake.  But, beware, because it is worse than that.  They have almost nothing to drink!  We were told after we were seated that we could walk across the street and buy soft drinks if we wanted (because the store still ""looking like it was open"").  It is pretty much either green tea (apparently only hot, not cold) or water...and getting our waiter to keep either in our cups was difficult.  I am sorry but if you are not going to do me the favor of having a liquor license, at least have more than water and hot tea to drink!We moved ahead with the hot tea and water and tried to be open minded about the food.  We decided to try some of the fish (as sashimi) and still do the omakase (yes, we are pigs).  While we do enjoy rolls, we gauge sushi restaurants by the fish in sashimi form:  every fish has a unique flavor and you should be able to taste them.  For what our opinion is worth, the fish was reasonably good.  However, the selection was not impressive and they were out of some of those!The omakase experience that followed again demonstrated how much Kai Zan lacks, more than anything, an experienced restaurant manager.  We were absolutely inundated with a rapid fire arrival of course after course.  We were not alone in this complaint:  we heard at least a dozen complaints about the service coming way too fast from numerous other tables being relayed to the kitchen by the staff.  In short, everybody was being buried under courses and nobody was enjoying it.  And then the service stopped...all service.  For about 10 minutes we sat there with no food, no drink, no attention.  Eventually the service did restart but, still, with no attention to our pace.  Later, I was told that this was ""on purpose"".Overall, the food was almost as good and creative as Chicago Magazine ranted when they placed Kai Zan number five on the list of new restaurants for this year.   However, some dishes did not work:  one was somehow transformed into having a bologna-like taste!All in all, there is hope for Kai Zan because I think the chef(s) is (are) actually talented and knowledgeable.  However, to have rated this place number five on the best new list either colors the new restaurants in our city as really bad this year or leads us to think that maybe we should seek other sources than Chicago Magazine for our recommendations!  As much as I attempt to try everything at least twice, it will be hard to go back to Kai Zan.  The one real positive, I guess, is that the price is pretty reasonable so we could still afford to have a more satisfying sushi experience the next night."
"There's not a lot to be added to the already huge list of glowing reviews for Kai Zan.The experience was fantastic, the price was very reasonable and the fish was amazing!Sign of a good restaurant...people making reservations to come back before they finish their dinner!If you haven't already been, go there immediately but don't forget a reservation!"
The food is good but I highly doubt the wait is worth it. Especially the 45 minutes wait even with a reservation is definitely a turn down. I like Sunda better compare to this place.
"So yummy!  The escolar pearls are so amazing.  We loved everything that we had.I'm so happy this place opened.  The hood needed a good sushi restaurant.It's BYOB with a one time $5 corkage fee for the table.  I think it seats maybe 15 people, so make a reservation.  Great service, great food.  Check it out!"
"Our favorite sushi place in Chicago, by far. Been here 15-20 times. The Omakase is legit. Great combination of flavors and textures. Very happy they expanded and can seat more... More opportunities to enjoy now. Also love leaving a restaurant with only a $100 tab for two.. Doesn't happen often in Chicago."
"The wait for our RESERVATION to be seated at a table both times was an hour; therefore, we have never had the pleasure of actually dining at Kai zan the two times we had reservations. During one of our times, the manager tried to chill our red wine while we waited for our table; we told her that you don't chill red wine, EVER. They will also rush out other people because they cannot plan accordingly so they will ruin any date night you potentially have here if they want to turn over the table. Their managers will tell you the wait is 10 minutes and 30 minutes later you still won't be seated."
"I too am reluctant to write this review, but this is the restaurant that made me finally write a review. My wife and I went here for my Birthday. We sat at the bar and ordered the Omikase. Everything was fantastic. Each course was better than the last and I'm usually wary of inventive sushi as it brings to mind the ""kitchen sink rolls"" served all over, but everything was so balanced and delicious. The fish was fresh and took a front seat. The chefs/owners and the staff were very attentive and seemed to really enjoy being there and watching us swoon with every bite. I would love to eat here every week if I could afford it (I'm back in school). Although it is very reasonably priced considering the quality, and the byob makes affordable for those increasingly rarer nights out."
"If you have had the Twins food before, You know what you need to know, and are already eating at Kai Zan.If you haven't had Carlo and Melvin's food yet, you really, really need to go - and soon.The food is always very fresh, and very tasty - and pretty too!  Everything from the perfectly marinated Zuke Salmon, to the variety of rolls and noodle etc. has been a taste treat that I, and my friends, want to come back and get more of.As others have said, they built the interior out by hand, with some really interesting tricks that you might not notice unless shown... The decor is very neat as well - my favorite thing being the bait bucket lamps. Any way, get to Kai Zan before the seats are too hard to get! Pure awesomeness.Also, they are BYOB, but if you forget your beverages there is a store right across the corner from them - so very easy to get some.*Edit*I don't know why this review was filtered, everything in it is my opinion of the restaurant. Anyway, if you see this, go eat! Youll like it."
"This place was sweet.  It's in a very nondescript area.. you wouldn't know it's there just walking by.  It's BYOB, and there's a minimart right across the street.  So we bought 2 bottles of cold sake and brought it over.  Once you walk inside, you know it's going to be good.  Pretty hostess, hipster servers, clean/modern decor, personal asianstyle booth-rooms.  We sat in one and it's nice.  Immediately a server brought over warm towels to wash our hands and a bucket of ice for our cold sake and sake glasses.  Most of us got the Omakase, and it was Omakawesome.  Basically it's the $60 tasting menu.  It was probably 12+ dishes, and it was soooo much food and very good.  I can't remember it all, but that wasn't the point.  The point is they're bringing out a lot of yummy food fast and furious you just eat it.  I love that way of eating.  It was a lot of sushi favs like sashimi and rolls and carpaccio, and other raw items like oyster shooters, uni shooters w/ raw quail egg, and also yakitori type things like grilled mackerel, octopus salad, grilled mussel, fried jalapeno, bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, and then other random stuff like a crab dish, mushroom dashi, etc.  There were several other dishes as well.  It's a lot of food.  They don't try and overcomplicate the dishes w/ a ton of ingredients and flavors, but they do make some of the more unique dishes interesting.  Service was great and the dishes came out quick and plates cleared and dishes were described and they checked up on the one person in our party who didn't order the omakase.  I'd recommend this place to anyone!"
"We went back for the omakase for our anniversary and it was mind-blowing!  We have been to Alinea, and this was actually more enjoyable!  You will be stuffed, so don't go crazy on the beginning courses, because they just keep coming and coming.  Delicious, fresh, innovative sushi.  Our favorite sushi restaurant in the city!"
"George and I have been eagerly awaiting the opening of Melvin and Carlo's Ukraine Village 600 sq feet of their own creation Kai Zan (Its fun figuring out who is the Kai and who is the Zan!) The space is cozy and full of energy! Not only are they talented Chefs but equally talented with carpentry! I've posted a few of their mouthwatering creations that shows their creativity and their Kai Zan sauce is amazing. Fish is fresh. Homemade Tofu was a delight. Uni was soft and fresh. We usually just let the chefs choice for us (omakase); try their homemade cheese cake! Reservations should be made as it is a small space, BYOB as well! Looking forward to the next visit!"
"delicious, fresh, amazing, fabulous, can do no wrong.  go here for the best sushi in chicago!"
"Best sushi restaurant in Chicago in my opinion.  Love that it's BYO, love the new addition for more seating and to accommodate larger groups, and I love the specials and creativity of the chefs.  The fish is fresh and the rolls are inventive, I could eat the Maguro Pearl appetizer every day!"
Very enjoyable meal. Dishes are creative and tasty (though not exceptionally refined).It is excellent for the price and quality ratio.
"I've been meaning to try this restaurant for a while.  I am always on the lookout for good sushi places of all types.The decor was interesting, without being flashy, stuffy or kitsch.  I thought the place has a nice, homey feel from the second I walked in.  Strangely shaped, small and a bit cramped, but interesting, with some nice semi-private areas and not too loud.We tried a huge variety of sushi rolls and a few other dishes.  The kaki fry was an awesome version.  3 massive, juicy oysters with a nice, thin and crisp coating. We also tried a special of mixed mushrooms and tofu steamed in sake that was really delicious.  We enjoyed the rolls quite a bit.  The fish was fresh, presentation beautiful, and the special combinations were not heavy handed.We enjoyed the service as well.  Our server was knowledgable and accessible, and our water was filled and empty plates removed in a timely fashion.As for value, the place is not cheap, but not overpriced either.  We spent just over $90 for two including tip, but we really pigged out.  You could do it for $50-60 most of the time, which is about what I'd spend at Coast or similar places.  Portion size was decent in most cases, although a few of the specialty rolls were only 2 pieces, which for $8 is pretty small.Overall, a great experience and I'll be returning very soon."
"Got takeout from this place and it was Oh so delicious!!! I usually stick to the California rolls at other Sushi places, but I felt comfortable trying new bites here and I was not disappointed."
"I agree with some of the other reviews.  The bad outweighs the good.We felt rushed, omakase was poorly timed (i.e. 2-3 dishes at a time, server trying to take my plate away while I'm still eating).  Plus, I don't think the food is that creative or tasty.  Spicy mayo on everything. The flavor profile is pretty one-tone and the condiments (i.e. mayo, chili oil, tabasco, etc etc) take away from the freshness and the flavor of the seafood itself.  A good example of this would be the uni that was drowning in ponzu.  I did really appreciate that the seafood was fresh.  And I thought the decor of the place was awesome with its private booths!"
"Loved my meal here. A friend and I had reservations so we didn't have to wait at all. The servers take care of you as far as taking your order, checking in on you, refilling your water, etc. but if you're sitting at the bar, the cooks just hand the food directly to you. They don't wait until you're finished with your bite or there's a pause in your conversation and you have to grab it with your hands, so it was just a really odd/undesirable part of the experience. But it was minor.I loved everything I ate. Very fresh, simple flavors done right. Order what sounds good to you, but do try at least one sashimi dish. In general everything is priced very fairly/reasonably, and if you're running on a budget, the rolls are a great option.I'm sure it will earn 5 stars from me in no time -- I'll definitely be back!"
"Service=2 starsFood=5 starsI had no trouble making the reservation. However, the girl that works up front is very inexperienced and somewhat rude. We were originally seated  at the sushi bar, towards the back of the restaurant. When I realized how uncomfortable that seat was, because everyone that walked pass me, bumps into me; so I asked for a table instead. Because a table was not available, she got flustered. She then proceed to tell me that there is a 1.5hr  limit per table and that  we will need to give up the table according to our 6:30 reservation. Umm, okay? So, basically they are limiting to how much I want to order? I understand that this a small establishment and they want to turn tables around faster than usual, but I didn't feel like there is a need to announce that their customers.  As we were standing, waiting for a table to be free; she asked if we wanted to order appetizers. Um...excuse me, would you like for us to stand here and eat?  When we were finished with everything, they asked if they can bring the check. Ummm..can I order dessert please? By this time, we were WAY over our 1.5hr limit. So I know they wanted us out.  When we were waiting for our dessert, the girl up front came by and asked if we're ready for the check.  I was slightly annoyed by now. Over all,  The food at Kai Zan is a must! Our waiter was super helpful, and recommended a lot of good dishes. The Chef also came by twice to see how everything is.  I would absolutely return to to Kai Zan! I wish they would train their staff better. We had:Escolar pearlMaguro pearlZuki ( It was a little fishy)Green monster roll( rolled in avocado instead of seaweed)Toro Tartar- A MUST try! The concept and presentation is unique, and mouth watering. Orange Rush( Must try)Uni nigri-(very fresh)Salmon nigriAngry crab handroll. Fried Oysters"
"The food was wonderful and  most importantly the staff went out of their way to provide a welcoming dining experience. Cheery pick the menu and try as many plates as you desire, You will not go wrong."
Omakasi. Get it.  And bring some good wine along; this is a BYOB. Don't forget a robust appetite. You are in for a real gourmet treat. And the last course? It's to die for......
the omakase was absolutely delicious...the servers were polite and knowledgeable...will definitely go back
"I really like this place and am glad it's come to my corner of the UKV! I've been about 4-5 times already. Escolar Pearls were delicious, I always order the jalapeno poppers, and have not been disappointed with any of the rolls. You can clearly tell that the ingredients are fresh and of the highest quality.  The only food items I weren't so jazzed about were the okra & tofu (but I'm not a huge fan of okra) and the green tea ice cream. The $5 corkage fee isn't my favorite, but it still saves some $ to BYOB. The service is really warm and quick. I'll be back here and hope I can get a table- once people find out how good the place is, it is going to be consistently mobbed!"
"Had the omakase.  It was well worth it.  Service was great.  Great value at $50, lots of food, a great variety of flavors.  One of the beat Japanese-style restaurants i've been to in a long time.  Will definitely be back!"
"Oh Kai Zan, hands down you are the BEST SUSHI/Sashimi restaurant in ALL of Chicago!  I would recommend ordering the OMAKaSA and I""m certain that your taste buds will thank you afterwards."
"This place is really great, one of my favorite sushi places in the city and I'm a snob about sushi. Considering the quality of the fish-which was excellent-the menu is very fairly priced. My friends and I were sat in a cabana, the service was great, the ambiance comfortable and it's BYOB. Check it out!"
"Best affordable modern Japanese restaurant I've been to in Chicago.  We got the Omakase and it was delightful.  My favorites were the escolar pearls and the salmon belly sashimi.  But when you get the Omakase, you just get the best of everything.  So there is no need to order by taking people's recommendations on Yelp.The ambiance is beautiful.  We sat in the sunny little patio up front but the wood interior is gorgeous.  I hope to sit in a booth next time.  One of the twin brother owner chefs walked around to ask us if we enjoyed our meal.  The wait stuff was attentive and you can tell they love their food as well.  As they should.  Its so good.  Make a reservation now."
"Omakase! I got to say...Kai Zan has leaped into my top 10 restaurants in Chicago and I'll definitely be coming back.Fresh fish, creative preparation, and great service."
"I have been to macku, arami, mirai, japonais, sea dog, coast, butterfly. Kai Zan is the best. I felt like Arami was a similarly great sushi restaurant, but 3x the price. I have been to Kai Zan 5 or 6 times. I will keep going back. My one caveat to this review would be that everyone should try macku at least once. They have the most interesting sashimi and nigiri (but the rest of their menu is crap)."
"A lovely, if tiny, BYOB sushi place.   The sushi is fresh, unique, and creative.   The staff is very attentive.  And the prices are reasonable.Nice decor too - the bar is fun (as it should be at sushi places).   And the booths that line the opposite wall looked cozy and cute - could be a great date place!We went with a group and sat at the bar.   Everything we ordered from the menu (regular and specials) were lovely.   From their non-sushi menu, I recommend the bacon-wrapped mushrooms.  We ended the night with a couple of ""chef's choice"" rolls, and they were some of the best we had that night.  So definitely cozy up to the chefs if you can!"
Hidden gem. Amazing.  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better....it's. BYO.
"The digs get an A+The Sushi and Sashimi get somewhere between A- and B+ pending the dishes you order.The grill items get a D.... The only thing going on there was the presentation and the nice little cabbage and ginger dressing garnish on the side.  I wasn't tasting any soul in these dishes at all!!!The service can range between an A and a C- depending on the night...  Needs improvement to be more consistent to its potential.  They also badly need a coat rack or coat check there!!!!!  Unless you like sitting on your coat the whole meal.....The details:This is a really fun cozy place with cool atmosphere and a cool crowd. The sushi quality is really nice, but watch out for very pricy specials that are good but can really multiply the total in your bill.Regardless, most of the sushi is quite delicious.  On the other hand, I have tried several of the small portion grill items, and I have yet to find any that have any real taste.   Also, watch out for the oyster shooters.  It is not a fusion dish, but it was a totally confused over the top disaster that just had too much going on and could not pull together the flavors in any delicate or balanced way.Stick to the sushi there and you will fine.   The Gomae was also quite tasty and among the best in the city.  Get that too....Service needs to be more consistent.  I loved the restaurant, when the servers kept my drinks filled plentiful the first time and even helped pour our beers.  That was great, but....   The next time, drink refill requests were forgotten, the server never poured or refilled any of our BYO beer, servers did not appear for long extended time periods to continue the ordering process (costing the restaurant revenue loss as well), and somehow the whole great service experience I had the first time was totally lost in visit 2.  I also tried to cancel a reservation for visit 3 recenty, and the phone was busy or nobody would answer all afternoon."
"A couple people have told me about Kai Zan and after going I can see why. It is amazing!  The sushi is so fresh you can really taste the fish. It specializes in little bites more along the lines of nigiri and sashimi rather than huge rolls with lots of spicy mayo. So if that is what you like do NOT come here. We ordered so much it is hard to remember everything, but my favorites were the escolar pearls and the angry crab sushi! Beyond amazing! One thing to know is that it is BYOB for everything. I wanted a coke but they informed me that they only have water and green tea, but if you forget he mentioned a store across the street where you can get your libation of choice. It is also a bit hard to find. The sign is very small, blink and you miss it. But it is so worth it once you find it! Enjoy!"
Great hidden gem and BYOB sushi spot.  A little off the beaten path but food was excellent.  Make a reservation because it's very small and you will have to wait.  The green monster was an awesome sushi roll and I would definitely get it again.  Escolar pearls were also good but I wouldn't have to get them again.  Overall great date spot and great sushi.
"Unfortunately the recent expansion has taken it's toll.  I dont think that the small kitchen is dealing well with three times the diners.  Omakase rounds are ill timed...temperatures are mostly all now room.temperature.... service is less personal and consistent.  The raise in the omakase price would be justified if the food hadn't taken such a hit in quality.  Lastly, and most alarming... sashimi is a bit warm, texture is off, and pieces are cut peculiarly small.  The angry crab is still spot on...amazing...so good...as if a seperate chef is responsible for that one dish.  Sorry guys. Gotta be honest.  You were one of my faves... lots has changed."
"LOVE cozy little - off the beaten path places with great food, attentive staff and interesting decor.Stopped by Kai Zan on a Sunday evening, without a reservation, and waited about 10 minutes for a table.  Next time I'll either make a res., or for the spur of the moment cravings, pick up the phone and pray - because I'm guessing, as word gets out, short 10 minute waits may be a thing of the past.There were two of us, and for less than $40 we sampled:Escolar Pearls Angry Crab Orange CrushSpecialty Roll of the night - name escaping me - three different types of tuna and a kickSpicy OctopusHamachi / JalapenoFlavors were wonderful and soy sauce was only needed for the hamachi.  If I was forced to pick a favorite ... it would have to be the Orange Crush (which was a surprise from one of the chefs towards the end of our meal) or the Angry Crab.Thank you Kai Zan for a superb end of the weekend meal.  I will be seeing you again soon!"
"Although I was looking for a pure Omakase experience (aka, fish only), however, I probably found one of the best Kaiseki places in Chicago. The food, the creativity and the flavor here is great. At a price of 50 bucks, Kai Zan is a steal for the kind of food you get.Although I'd go back and just order the fish and nothing else, just to have a pure omakase experience."
