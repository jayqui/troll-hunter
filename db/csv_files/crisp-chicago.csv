Crisp
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but this place may actually beat out the Korean fried chicken joints in LA!?My good friend from grad school and I came here after we found it listed in Lonelyplanet. Now that we're both locals, we wanted to see what all the fuss was about with this Korean chicken place.When I first walked in, I didn't see a single Asian worker behind the counter or kitchen, and I immediately got skeptical. Thank goodness the lines and smell kept me patiently waiting for my order, because these chicken wings were AH-MAZING!I ordered the 5 Crisp BBQ Jumbo Wings for $9. At first I thought it was a bit pricy for just five wings, until they came out, and I was like... eff. These wings were HUGE. They were not kidding about the size of these babies. The Crisp BBQ style was smoky, sweet, and delicious. Chicken was tender and had great flavor! Seriously, some of the best I've had.A few rules to keep in mind:- Always order BONE-IN. It's just not as good when it's boneless.- Drown your food in the Atomic sauce. It's not spicy, it's just freaking ""out of this world"" GOOD.Crisp is absolutely worth the wait and money spent."
"When my girlfriend and I purchased 10 wings and fries to split we were hoping to just get a taste of what Crisp has to offer, little did we know we would leave stuffed full of amazing flavor. The wings were simply amazing, fried crispy yet wasn't dry, I literally ate off every part of the chicken wing. We both love spicy foods so we went with the buffalo spicy which was had so much flavor and spice. We simply had no complaints. this place just might have the best wings in Chicago. I know some may complain about the seating, we had to wait about 15 mins before a table opened up but the food was so delicious that we didn't even mind"
"This was the best Korean chicken wing place I've ever had in my life, and I come from a household where my grandma cooks traditional Korean food all the time. The prices may seem a little high but once you see & taste the wings you begin to understand why. They are HUGE and are fried to a crisp. I love my wings crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and that's exactly how they were cooked.My 3 friends & I shared 10 wings of the Crisp BBQ, 10 wings of the Seoul Sassy, and 1 Rice bowl. I personally loved the Crisp BBQ the best, it's just a unique flavor I haven't had at any other place. The bowl was disappointing. While it was filled with vegetables, they just tasted bland. We couldn't finish everything, it was just too much food. I would definitely come back for the wings!"
"Alright, Crisp, you win my vote for best wings in the city. I thought Birds Nest was as good as it gets, but you've got them beat.I made the mistake of getting 10 full wings, having my girlfriend do the same. MORE than enough (granted I still went through at least 10, she could barely finish the fifth). The wings were....crispy, not dried out, packed with flavor. The skin was so freaking tasty that I caught myself eating the winglett a few times.As for the sauce, I hear you're either on team Crisp BBQ or Seoul Sassy...loved them both. Seoul Sassy was really awesome, not too much sauce needed for the wing but packed a really great flavor. Crisp BBQ was a little saucier, really good, tangy bbq sauce.The shop is small, tough to get a table inside, but if you wait around for a little bit seats should open up.Overall, I'm coming back as soon as I need a wing fix."
"Crisp BBQ sauce: 3.5Sassy Seoul: 4The chicken with crisp BBQ sauce was good but the chili flavor from the sriracha seasoning overwhelmed the delicate sweetness of the meat. The sassy Seoul was the bomb . The crispiness is a deeper grilled crispiness than achieved with a flash fry, and the sweet caramalized sugars in the honey elevated it to unreal realms. But it was not perfect, a little too overdone and tough on the breast meat pieces. Also, after a while, teeth get rather Fried so deliciously done we didn't have space for sides.I do slightly prefer the Southern style of extremely crisp skin, and soft and juicy insides."
"My friend Cindy W is going to debate me on this one, but I still prefer Cafe Orient 33 wings through and through. They make be less crispy, but the flavor is better and the environment much nicer.I tried both the Seoul Sassy and the BBQ (got a whole chicken, with half and half). The two sauces were actually very similar in taste, but I did prefer the Seoul Sassy because it wasn't as sweet and overpowering. The breast pieces and the ends of the wings were too dry. If I come here again, I think I will just get the 5 piece wings, instead of a half chicken. Still all in all, these are very good wings, and I would have given it 4 stars if I was only rating the food.Tiny amount of seating available, and the napkins leave a lot to be desired... c'mon now, school cafeteria style brown paper towels?!?!"
"My sister send me a link for Crisp @ 2940 N Broadway.  After I looked at it on Yelp and saw the pictures of their wings & read a few of the reviews I knew I had to try their chicken wings.  It reminded me of the chicken wings I had in the Philippines at a place called ""Bon Chon"" in ""The Mall of Asia"".  We ate there and I have been trying to find a place in the U.S. that had wings like ""Bon Chon"". My friend moved back to the Philippines and he told me there is a Bon Chon in New York City.I Yelped Bon Chon in Chicago to see if they might have a restaurant here.  Instead of Bon Chon coming up ""CRISP"" came up.  I'm amazed that CRISP has been around for 7 years and today is the first time I have been there.  The wings are amazingly similar to Bon Chon and just as delicious.  If you haven't tried them and you enjoy eating great food you need to haul your buttocks (AKA Yo Ass) down to Bon Chon and try the wings.  My sister and I ordered a 10 piece order with 2 different types of chicken wings.  5 pieces of the Seoul Sassy.  This was a blend of ginger, garlic, soy, green onions & other spices. (Absolutely delicious). The other 5 were Crispy barbecue with a blend of American fusion barbecue sauce, a blend of spicy, sweet, prepared with fresh herbs & spices.   They also had a variety of condiments like Alison's Atomic Sauce (ancient family secret).  Gotta try this on your wingsThere are all sorts of other dishes on the menu which means I will definitely be going back to try them"
"This place is pretty good, and holy moley, do they load you up with wings!  I ordered a set of 10 full wings (meaning they don't separate the drumette from the wing), but I got stuffed after getting halfway through to my surprise, only to realize that I still had 10 full wings left.  They had given me 20, which in regular wing language at most places means I got 40 wings for $16.99.  I told them about it, but they didn't believe me!  I need to step up my wing eating game, apparently.  Of note, there were no visible Koreans working there, but the sauce was pretty good, and the wings did have a nice little crisp to them.  Kudos.  I've been perfecting my own recipe for a while, and their recipe was pretty tight.  Community seating, street metered parking, friendly service, yummy drink options."
"4 stars for taste, value, fast and efficient service, and location!I had their Seoul bowl, which was super tasty and very filling.  The meat was tender and had lots of flavor.  The boyf had the boneless wings and those were amazingly yummy.  Must have for sure.  Next time I come back, I will try their chicken waaaangs!Must try:  wings and their atomic sauce."
Really good crispy chicken I guess they pressure cook it and then deep fry and cover it in there sauces. The condiments they have are great. Especially the pink sauce.
Hands down best Korean fried chicken place I've been to! Their wings really are the WHOLE wing so keep that in mind when you're ordering. We got a mix of both flavors but I definitely liked the Seoul Sassy flavor more than the Crisp BBQ. I would say that the Crisp BBQ flavor has a hint of gochuchang flavor in it. The half order with 10 wings is a generous portion for 2 people.Definitely a must try if you're visiting Chicago!
"We came here late at night on a Saturday and got really fast service. The food was also really good. We had the whole jumbo wings, and no kidding they were whole with all three parts of the wing and really big. The crisp BBQ flavor was a very good balance between sweet, savory, and spicy. I'd highly recommend! We also ordered some of the bowls, and this is where I wish they could do a little differently. Essentially they have either the steak / chicken bowl which is all meat and rice, or the buddha bowls that is all vegetables and rice. I really wish they could make a mixed bowl where you get both meat and vegetables..... since we went with four people we were able to just order one of each bowl and mix the meat & veggies, but if I was with just myself or people who just wanted the chicken it would be a difficult situation."
"Let me start off by saying I do not regret my decision to try CRISP! Of course I tried the wings. The Seoul sassy wings are sooo TASTY!! The wings are served whole (pretty big) so you can get five for about $9. Yes, that does seem a little expensive at first, but, they are WHOLE wings. You are basically ordering ten.Anyways, the side of rice was the perfect compliment to the savory and flavorful wings. The place is small and you order at the counter. After you take a seat (very limited) they bring you your food.There are plenty of other things I want to try! Everything that came out of the kitchen looked delicious and I look forward to coming back!"
"Must Order: buddha bowl with just veggies or +beefThis was on my list of places across the US and I'm so glad we were able to have this delivered during our business meeting! Since I've been eating much smaller portions of meals (multiple times a day), I settled for a baby buddha bowl.I loved that the portion was still pretty big considering I had basically a mini bowl. Pour in some gochujang sauce and mix up the veggies and fried egg and you have a delicious bibimbap! It was so tasty that I kept raving about it during our lunch break. I also got the chance to try a co-worker's beef in their bowl and thought it was also really good. So if you're feeling more carnivorous then I would recommend adding the beef!If you enjoy Korean bibimbap, this is definitely a great option!"
"Came in here a little while ago, I'm a little behind on my reviews but let's get to it. The wings here are awesome. Very flavorful with a nice sweet kick to them and even though the sauce is wet the wings still maintain a solid crunch to them. We also got the Buddha bowl with a bajillion veggies in them which was really really good. All in all this place is a very good spot if you're craving a different take on wings and if you're in the mood for some good Korean food."
"Two of my friends recommended this place and I was curious to see if their comments were similar to the reviews on Yelp... I must say this place deserves their 4 stars. My friends told me how huge their wings were and I was completely skeptical. I did not believe their wings were gargantuan. But I took it into consideration when ordering. With that being said, I ordered the 5 piece chicken wings with Crisp BBQ sauce and a side of rice.As soon as I received my platter, I believed my friends when they said the portions are huge. As with the portion being huge, the wings were pretty severely delicious. The crisp BBQ had a nice sweet, tangy, and spicy kick to it. Every bite was orgasm in my mouth. The rice had sesame seeds sprinkled on top and was really soft which complimented the wings. I will definitely be back to try the other sauces."
"Oh man, this place is so, so good.  You know how usually when you get wings, you either get drums or flats?  They don't break up the wings here, so you get both drum/ flat in one and they are HUGE AND DELICIOUS.  My favorite is the Seoul Sassy (a MUST GET) but BBQ is good too, and the Buddha bowls are A+.  I go here at least once a month, I love it so much!"
"Crisp is a communal seating area where you would order food at the register and then get the number and sit anywhere you like. The seats are like picnic tables and if it is crowded, you might be sitting really close to strangers. My friend and I shared the 10 piece chicken wings (whole jumbo wings) in Crisp BBQ sauce and fries. 10 wings were more than enough for the two of us. I think I ate like three and was more than full! They really are jumbo sized. The fries were mediocre, nothing special. I would pass on the fries and try something else. The wings were pretty darn yummy and fried to perfection! I would definitely come back to try the other items like the Buddha bowl and burritos."
"We were strolling around Chicago and came upon crisp and saw it had a decent crowd and figured it had to be good. We ordered wings and fried chicken and a side of onion rings. The place is first come first serve searing after you order at the counter. Our food came promptly and it was hot. Every table had a whole roll of paper towel and some extra dressings. Our food was delicious, fresh, and the sauces on the chicken were very tasty. Good fast and tasty option for a quick and filling meal."
"Once upon a time, three girls trekked through the windy and rainy streets of Chicago on Memorial day in search of the most talked about chicken wings in all of the land. When they finally reached the orange Crisp awning, they were saddened by the fact that it was CLOSED! The next day they took the train over with the hope that it would be open and low and behold -- IT WAS and they lived happily ever after...Y'all, I can't tell you how happy I was to be able to try the deliciousness that were the CRISP wings. As a self-proclaimed chicken wing enthusiast, I would have to say the Seoul Sassy wings are some of the best chicken wings I have ever had. Maybe it was the sweet, salty, umami vibe I was getting from them or maybe it was the adrenaline rush from trying to find a seat in the tiny restaurant, but the overall experience eating at Crisp was fun, enjoyable, and exciting. The guys behind the counter were very friendly and helpful when it came to showing us noobs what to order. We also got the fries and I would say they were okay - maybe equivalent to Mickey D's on a good day. There appeared to be street parking outside and the restaurant itself is maybe a 15-20 minute walk from the train station. I would highly recommend this place to any visiting Chi-town. It's definitely on my list of ""to-go"" places the next time I'm back."
"I ordered the 6 piece boneless wings - half Seoul sassy and half suicide buffalo. Seoul sassy had a sweet flavor almost like empress chicken from a Chinese place. Suicide was the type of hot I like but not unbearable to eat - yet at the same time I was sweating a little (I agree it's gross to sweat when you eat), and comes with jalepenos (or some hot pepper) that was tough on my stomach. Don't be mistaken by the ""6 piece"" it was enough food for 2-3 people.Normally I don't like to get wings take-out because they become soggy but these were still hot and crispy (we do live close...)My gf ordered the baby Buddha bowl with beef. From what I tried I liked - she's picky and wasn't a huge fan.Going with a 5 for the online ordering, wings, and service."
"Came here with a group of hungry boys so we ordered 2 whole chickens, one was Seoul sassy and the other crisp bbq, as well as a side of kimchi. I think we were split half and half on who preferred either flavor, but both were really good and very different than your traditional chicken wing. The kimchi was good but basically just like your standard kimchi, nothing particularly special, not too salty and not to sour. My main problem with this place was just the seating arrangement was very awkward and crammed. There wasn't enough space for people to stand, let alone sit, even though this is food that you kind of need to sit next to the people your eating with. The large cafeteria tables were very crammed together and packed, but I guess I went around dinner time on a Sunday. Maybe try to get delivery instead if it's going to be a popular time. We also felt like none of us were full off of the chicken, even though we got 2 whole chickens for 4 people. Maybe we're just hungry and have huge appetites, but that might be something to consider. If I hadn't been here with a group, I personally would've gone for the Buddha bowl, they looked really good! I would consider coming back to try their other food because it all looked pretty good."
"I can't believe it took me this long to discover the wonder that is Crisp! This place was on my radar for awhile, and the wait was well worth it! The food was fresh and delicious. I ordered the Foodie's Choice Chicken Sandwich (no blue cheese, not a fan) with the crisp BBQ sauce = DIVINE! The sauce put a delicious, spicy, Korean spin on traditional fried chicken. The freshness of the spinach and tomato combined with the bevy of sauces aboard this beauty made for a delicious sandwich.The atomic sauce was also a standout and I found myself eating more fries just so I could have more of this sauce! I had a tough time deciding here - chicken sandwich or chicken wings? I wasn't disappointed with my sandwich, but I'll be back to try those wings sometime soon!"
"I'm giving this place 5 stars because it's one of the few places I always go to when I'm in town. Although it can get really busy at times, it's worth the wait. These finger-licking good wings are huge, and is always made fresh to order. I tried it all, but the Seoul Sassy, which is sweet and savory, is my favorite."
"I'm so disappointed to share this, especially because I've been noshing on Crisp's deliciousness since 2007 but this tragedy cannot be ignored.  My BF chose this joint recently for a low key lunch with friends for his birthday on Sunday afternoon.  The place was busy as usual but we were excited to introduce 3 of our friends to Crisp.  Everyone ordered and the wait wasn't to unbearable even though we couldn't all sit together. With happy, full tummys we packed up the remaining food to go and were on our way.  When the BF went to reheat and eat, he found this little guy in his Buddha Bowl. Not cool, very disgusting, & unfortunate that Crisp's kitchen is this dirty. Clean it up Crisp, clean it up.  You just lost some loyal customers!"
"Dear Crisp, You have ruined me for other wings.These giant (and, yes, crispy!) wings should be enjoyed with the BBQ sauce. This ain't no mamby pamby BBQ sauce. It's sweet and spicy and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. The flavor is so delicious that the most delicate of eater would lick their fingers clean rather than sacrifice a drop more than necessary to one of the many, many napkins you will use. Pros: The wings, duh! But it's also BYOB. So bring in your fave brew to enjoy those mouth watering wings. The fries are also lovely.Cons: It's tiny. We went fairly early and could still only get a seat at one of the counters, which was fine and we were grateful for it. But if you want a seat at a table, I don't know - you might have to get there when it opens or something. So limited seating. Also, super crowded. The lines to order will wrap throughout. Don't expect any elbow room. Crisp, my love, I will be back. I have heard great things about Sassy and must find out if they are indeed true."
"This is a Beyond excellent place to eat, the food is good, and the staff is fun and nice too. My only complaint is the space, the place is too confined, other than that it's a must eat for anyone in Chicago."
Spent a week in Chicago for the first time in May and as far as food goes this was the best place I tried.  I debated between one of the bowls and the wings but ended up trying the wings.  They were huge and very flavorful!  Definitely hope to make it back someday. :)
Have heard so much about this for so LONG and I finally was in the area and decided to check it out!!! Bibimbap is amazing with the sauce (whatever it is).  You can tell the veggies are fresh (huge plus). The rice was so delicious and sticky (the way it should be)!I also decided to get  a half order of the Seoul sassy and it was such a generous portion!! Such great sweet flavor!
"Korean fried chicken wings are the best. The sauce is so delicious here. The chicken is also cooked to perfection and the portions are large. The bowls also looked pretty good, but I've only gotten the chicken wings here. The place is a little small so if you're eating in (and it's busy) you might have to wait for a table. In addition the tables are long picnic tables, so unless you have a big group, you're probably sharing with a few other people. They also offer free green tea tea packets for free and hot water."
"It's the first place I take people too when they visit. I really like their chicken wings, Team Seoul Sassy all the way! While I enjoy how small the place is (super cozy, makes it mostly awesome) sometimes there are just super douchebags at the tables and they don't leave. The last time I was in there was this group of people drinking at one of the tables (they brought their own hard alcohol) and they were insanely loud, really rude, and generally unpleasant. Meeh. Anyway, if you can get it to go, this place is the best!"
"Crisp is a revelation in the world of Chicken wings.  5 wings there is 10 anywhere else because you get the whole wing, flapper and drum!My favorite flavors and the BBQ and Seoul Sassy, such flavor you will never forget it!BYOB too, but they also sell cans,Be forewarned, its a VERY small place, so be prepared to wait for a seat"
"It's my first time having korean chicken wings ever and those wings by CRISP are something I would knee for. There were a few flavors of sauces on the list but my friend and I picked the first two with the ""stars"" next to them (believed that they were recommended). As flavorful as it looks! This place is a must-go."
"Finger-licking, savory Korean fusion food!Warning: if you come during busy hours, be prepared to scavenge for seating. This is a tiny establishment, but it's worth it for the nomz.This place is known for their flavorful wings and tasty bibimbap bowls. My friends and I ordered the Seoul sassy wings, crisp BBQ chicken tenders, and a chicken bad boy buddha bowl... I'm drooling just typing this again! This was so tasty and I'm so glad we shared several dishes! I don't know how I could decide if it was just myself. Also I drizzled their atomic and buddha sauce as a compliment to the already great flavors. I wish I could just bottle a mix of the two sauces and take it home with me! Buddha bowl was good but the star of the meal was obviously the wings.Definitely come here for some atypical yet mind blowing flavors, but be mindful of the limited seating."
They are a little pricey but COMPLETELY WORTH IT. Both the flavors and the portions are big. I'm a huge wing person and I must say.... Over every other wing place THIS PLACE IS NOW MY GO TO!!
"I lived in Korea for my all life before moving to Chicago last year. And there is no doubt that I love Korean food. I always went to look for good Korean spots in Chicago but it hasn't really been successful. Crisp, on the other hand, was one of the places that I told my friends about. There are a lot of Korean restaurants in Chicago but Crisp is definitely one of the restaurants where you should visit in Chicago.Their menu is very simple yet interesting. There are two big parts of their menu, one is Korean-style fried chicken and the another is Bibimbap(Korean traditional rice dish where they put rice and various vegetables, beef, fried egg and Korean chilly paste called Gochujang). For fried chicken, they have different sauces than what you usually get from regular chicken wing places in America. Seoul Sassy is soy sauce based sauce which tastes very similar to what you actually get at fried chicken restaurants in Korea. Grandma's sauce is basically sweet chilly sauce which also is very similar to how it is in Korea. Fun thing about their Bibimbap is that they named it Buddha bowl. Also, they have 3 different size which offers different kinds and numbers of vegetables. For your choice of protein, they offer tofu, beef, and chicken. I really recommend you to try it with beef while it's how normally we eat in Korea, but my friend who went there with me was vegetarian so he just ate it with no protein. He still told me it was best food he had in a while! I liked the food overall because it's still very authentic but at the same time they adapted Korean food to American taste. It has more of sweetness and saltines and it was definately less spicy. So I think Crisp good for someone who is not ready to get very exotic but still wants to try something different. It will be worth trying!Besides food, there were bad parts as they had good parts. I realized that the size of restaurant was little small for amount of people who were visiting. It was Thursday afternoon when I visited, but the restaurant was full of people and there were many people who were taking food for carry out. It would have been nicer if the space was little bigger. Although people working there were very friendly and nice, the restaurant didn't have any feeling of Korea. Since I am very interested in spreading Korean culture to the world, I'd expect such a good Korean fusion restaurant to show that their food is based on Korean food so that people can feel friendly about Korean food in the future. Maybe they could put more décor like Korean flag that shows it's a Korean restaurant or hang pictures of Korea with Korean letters! Overall, I really liked that they had simple but good menu, and good sense of Korean flavors into it. For people who hasn't tried this place yet, I recommend you to try this spot to taste new sauces on fried chicken and I assure that their Buddha bowls will please you with new flavors and healthy balance!"
"I came here every time I visited my brotha in Chicago! It was just some tasty chicken wings and great Buddha bowl (big portion, too!!).  Price is very reasonable! The restaurant is small and seating is kinda of limited, but we never had to wait to long to get the table! See you next time when I'm in town! Yum!!"
"Someone I met told me I should try Crisp because they have the best wings in Chicago. I love fried chicken and the saucier they are the better. I listened and convinced my wife to go to diner here one day. This place does not disappoint. My wife is not much of a BBQ sauce person, but their BBQ wings she can not resist. Best wings I have ever tried.If you are in the area you have to try Crisp. If you are not in the area, you have to take a trip so that you can try Crisp!!!"
"Love ordering their whole chicken deal on days I don't feel like cooking dinner!!!! Very fast delivery and super reasonable prices. My only problem with Crisp is the ordering process. I always order by phone, and IF someone picks up the phone, I'm put on hold immediately. Most of the time there's a busy signal and the call won't even go through. But the chicken is so good, I keep coming back."
"Best wings you'll ever eat in Chicago.Usually service is super nice, too. Today is the one exception. I placed an online order to make sure my food was ready by the time I got there. As I paid, I asked my future husband if he still wanted to eat it there because it looked crowded. The cashier said with an attitude, ""We tell people we don't take reservations, so for you to place an order online and then sit here and eat it is very rude to the other diners here."" I looked at Mike and said, ""Well, guess we paid to park for nothing... Alright, thanks man."" So, we left. I have no problem with the cashier saying it's against policy to place a to go order and eat it there. We'd actually done it twice before and were never told otherwise. But he didn't have to accuse us of being line jumpers. It's rude to others? The people behind us who were about to order would have to wait a good 15 minutes to get their food. By that time, we would have been licking our fingers and tossing the bones out. And we certainly wouldn't have been taking up any space after that. I will come back to Crisp because this is really the only time I had a problem here. But I think if this had been my first experience, I would have really been pissed and given it a bad review. I hope management sees this and tells their employees to explain things without being rude."
"Stopped into this restaurant yesterday for my usual Chicken Strip Meal.  I had a craving for this meal.  I have been going to this restaurant for the last three years, however, after the experience I saw yesterday, I will NEVER return.  VERY UNSANITARY.  After placing my order with the gentleman at the counter, I sat down until my order was ready.  While sitting there, the counter person started to eat behind the counter then proceeded to place foil liners into to to boxes without washing his hands.  Again very unsanitary.  The worst thing is, he kept looking me while he was placing the liners in to the boxes.  When I asked my for money back and asked for the phone number for the owner, he was so smug about it.  An email will be sent to the owner about the situation.There are to many great restaurants in the neighborhood."
"The steak bimibap was delicious! However the lower rating comes partially from their selection of bibimbap bowls. The only bowl with meat did not have veggies, while their veggie bowls did not offer meat (besides the egg). I split two different bowls with friends and got a balanced meal, but it would have been nice to have the option of having both meat and vegetables in one bowl. Second, while the meal was very good, I was SO thirsty afterwards. High sodium? Perhaps. Not sure if I will be visiting again for that last reason."
"One of my favorite places in Chicago. 5 Seoul Sassy wings plus a Bad Boy Buddha is our go to combo for two and covers all the major food groups :)Also their fried mushrooms are amazing! My only complaint is that it's so hard to find seating. Open up another location, please!"
The best wings I've ever had in my life. I will never be able to go back to Buffalo Wild Wings. I could bathe in the Seoul sauce. I luv u crisp.
"The Spread: We ordered the half chicken, Crisp BBQ style, kimchi (duh, I can never resist when it's on the menu,) and Marty's Magic Mushrooms. The chicken was perfect just the way it was served: CRISP! And the BBQ sauce offered a nice combo of sweet and heat. Not sure what makes the mushrooms magic? To us they were just eh... fried mushrooms, IMO. But thumbs up to the Sriracha mayo dipping sauce that came on the side.  The Scene: BYOB, bustling, bright with communal picnic-style tables. The Service: Staff was kind enough to let us know that the kitchen was going to close in 5 minutes, so we got our order in just in time. When it was ready, the guy at the counter announced it as ""last but not least"" and gave us a big smile. :)"
"Oh Crisp, how I've missed amazing Korean chicken wings that just blow the competition right out of the water. The wings are the most awesome thing here. They are huge to the point where eating 2 will make you full! My favorite is actually the Crisp BBQ for its smokey but sweet flavor. The Seoul sassy is more sweet and tangy so it's something I have to be in the mood for. Buffalo is pretty good too! I really do not think it's too pricey considering the jumbo size of the wings!Fries - The small is big enough to feed two people. By itself, there's hardly any seasoning on the fries but the dark red sauce they have on the table is the most amazing substitute for ketchup (but they have ketchup too). The red sauce is like a sweeter, less spicier version of gochujang which makes it not spicy at all for me actually. But the dark red sauce, whatever it is, is still mm mm yummy! Note: Pretty small interior with limited seating, especially because it's so popular here. Consider placing an online/phone order for takeout which will speed things along...plus you get to eat without people crowding around trying to stalk you for your seat after you leave!"
"Man the wings are on fire, the sweet sauce is Amazing,  way better then wing stop. Great fires also. Only down fall is the seating there gets packed and have to wait but worth the wait for the wings. 5 Star's. It gets my Idriz Approval Stamp."
"Chicken wings are great, not my favorite just a bit too crispy. The beef bowl lacks seasonings, very bland & too much rice."
"Mmmm Korean double fried chicken, what's not to like?The pieces of chicken here are HUGE, we're not talking those little things you get at Buffalo Wild Wings, you'll probably fill up on just a few here.  The chicken is perfectly crispy and flavorful - my favorite is the Seoul Sassy but you can't go wrong with any of their flavors.The fries are also good, perfectly thin and crispy. Just like the wings, all their other food portions are huge too.  Great for sharing (especially the massive bibimbap).The best part is they're BYOB! The restaurant is small, so there might be a line during busy times.  Worth trying though!"
"The wings the wings the wings. What more can I say? Fantastic service, food and music. Wow! Amazing! Awesome! Great! Not enough adjectives lol."
"Overrated! Yes the sauce is good .. and its real chicken. But how is this place called crisp and the wings aren't crispy?? My expectation was for it to be crispy .. so I think I was just let down by that. Also, do not get the fries. Frozen fries that you can buy and self-make tastes better or equivalent."
Not sure how I haven't reviewed Crisp before! Best wings in Chicago. The Seoul Sassy sauce is everything you need and the onion rings are spot on.
"This is the place to go for fried Korean wings! The chickens are on steroid here so portions will be big. I ordered five seoul sassy wings but it looked like I got ten. I had to stop and count to make sure they didn't give me more. It looked a lot because they were just five full wings. The wings were THAT big! They were full of flavor! I would have liked to try the bbq wings also but that would mean I have to order ten wings. Ten wings means another ten pounds to my butt. haha. I got an order of fries as a side but honestly, those five ginormous wings were enough. It was so wasteful to throw away the fries but I couldn't finish them. The atomic and buddah sauces on the table were worth trying. I prefer the atomic sauce with the fries because it was creamy. Dont be alarm, the sauce wasn't that spicy considering the name ""atomic"" it's tolerable level of spicy. Service was friendly and I would come back next time I'm in town."
"Crisp's Seoul Sassy Korean fried chicken wings is one of my top favorite dishes. The sweet and tangy taste is so unforgettable that I often crave it. The wings are huge; a half portion is large enough to feed at least 2 people. To add some healthy but tasty ingredients to the meal, we'd also order one of the Buddah bowls to accompany the wings.  That way, we have a full meal of chicken, rice and veggies for 2...and sometimes we leave with leftover wings, so we have an incredible lunch the next day.  Highly recommend. The restaurant is pretty small and can get crowded, so we always opt for an early dinner around 5. Then we walk the neighborhood and grab dessert at one of neighboring dessert shops."
"I was famished so ordered a rice bowl and chicken sandwich.  I loved the rice bowl but for what it's worth, they should make it slightly cheaper.  In NY, they'd include a protein for the price Crisp is charing for.  The sandwich was quite tasty but I didn't like the bun it came in.  All in all, a great choice if you want to eat healthy but be prepared to pay a little more than you're used to for fast food."
"Finally tried this place after being skeptical about another over-hyped Asian place.Only qualm was that we got delivery using Postmates, in which the fees and delivery was more than what I should have paid for.Anywho, boo & I each got an original bad boy buddha (bibimbap), one with beef and the other with tofu. We also got a half order of chicken, in seoul sassy and crisp bbq. I liked that they separated the rice and wasn't already mixed in with the bowls. I accidentally ordered organic brown rice for one of the bowls, and boy was it amazing rice, even though it cost more. It was great that all the veggies still tasted fresh and vibrant after waiting roughly an hour for delivery. Boo surprisingly enjoyed the bibimbap, considering he's a burger type of guy. While bibimbaps were good, they weren't outstanding and definitely have had better.The chicken though is where it's at. Perfectly fried with great crispiness outside without the chicken being dry. The sauces are what impressed me the most. The descriptions really described it perfectly...a little spicy, smoky, sweet, ginger and soy notes. I usually don't care for sweet and am all about the spicy/salty but they really did it right here.Also feel like Crisp is very good bang for your buck, as you the original Buudha bowl or a half order of chicken is very satisfying for one person and costs right under or at $10. Would love to dine in next time and just go straight for the chicken and skip over the Buddha bowls."
"This place is good. ""How good?"", you ask. Well, one rainy evening I ordered my 10 wings in Seoul Sassy to-go. Worried that my delicious, crispy, fried chicken wings would get too moist in the carry-out box, I raced down Belmont towards Lake Shore Drive so I could get home ASAP and chow down. Long story short, I made a right turn too quickly and got a red light camera ticket....whatevers, chicken was still crisp and perfect when I got home!I don't really care for their other flavors and highly recommend Seoul Sassy which is a sweet, soy and garlic sauce. Their rice bowls are huge and tasty. Oh, I love their atomic sauce."
Best food of our 7 day trip to Chicago!! I want to come back soon jus to eat here!My husband and I got 10 wings and had plenty to eat.
"This place is awesome. It's fast, friendly, and, most importantly, absolutely delicious. I ordered ""5 chicken wings"" per the recommendation of the employee, and his choice of sauce as well. I had my food in less than 5 minutes, piping hot and to my delight, generously portioned. The wings are enormous and lightly (but entirely) covered in unique sauces that bounce between sweet and spicy. I had 6 wings in my basket which was a bonus. Awesome spot, definitely will be back. The kim chee was fine."
"Crisp is a must-try for any Chicagoan or out-of-towner who appreciates a memorable meal. I usually call-in my order versus dining in (really small place--always packed) since I live so close, and by the time I get there it's usually just a few minutes of waiting until the order is ready. A lot of people i know who don't like most American-style fried chicken love the texture and flavor of Crisp's chicken. The Seoul Sassy boneless chicken tenders are my go-to order, and the baby Buddha bowl is also a very solid choice--you can add tofu or other meat if you'd like and sub brown rice for white rice if you want, and their kimchi is very fantastic. Their french fries are also really great."
"Perhaps I waited too long to visit, but from the previous reviews, I was guessing that I was in for an ethereal wing experience. This was not that. The wings were tasty but really not crisp and I thought both Seoul Sassy and the BBQ sauces were too sweet. Maybe it was the batch we had (10 wings), but I think not dividing the wings into drums and flats also makes them prone to overcooking.  This is pretty good fried chicken, but just good and it's really not comparable to Korean fried chicken I've had. If I were to go there, I think I'd have to subtract at least one star because Korean fried chicken this ain't."
"BEST FRIED CHICKEN EVERRR!!! I love bonchon which is a korean chain restaurant of fried chicken BUT this one takes the cake. DELICIOUS!! We got the seoul sassy flavor (MY FAVORITE) and the crisp bbq. I highly recommend the seoul sassy- ON POINT. The wings were super flavorful, tender, and juicy!!! If I come back to chicago I would love to try the other items on the menu but def I'd be back for the wings. There must be crack on it or something because I ate it Friday and I'm still thinking about those delicious wings (it's monday now). 10 wings for around 16.95. WORTH EVERY PENNY.  They're whole wings, so comes with wing and thigh so it's pretty big. I love you crisp and if I lived in chicago I'd eat you everyday."
"It's as good as everyone says. Go there now. Hadn't been in quite some time, but today I was in the area so I popped in for a Not So Common chicken sandwich with Seoul Sassy sauce. Un-effing-real. The thing is HUGE and I'm the kind of person who is only able to eat half of every meal I order, but that thing was devoured in a matter of minutes. How on earth do they make it so damn tasty??? Employees are always very friendly as well. Hats off, Crisp!"
"There's actually not much to say other than Korean fried chicken. You can't go wrong there. I've been here multiple times and have also gotten the takeout. The seoul sassy sauce is sooo good that I've been hesitant to try anything else though I hear all the other sauces are good as well. When I come with a friend or two, we tend to go for the whole chicken special which is completely worth it. I've also had the buddha bowl here before but it's not that special. If you're going to go to crisp, you really should be getting the fried chicken and nothing else. The space is a little small, so it does get crowded easily but I've never had a problem with it."
"YUMMA!!! Korean fried chicken. Fried chicken and Korean food are among my favorite things to eat-- put these two together and it makes for a VERY happy tummy and an even happier Lissy. The restaurant itself is pretty small, so you'll most likely be sharing a table with another party. The wait is never super bad, though. BYOB or in my case BYOW (wine is life). The chicken wings are ginormous. 5 wings will fill up 2 people with average appetites. These are like the entire wing, people (the drum, the flapper, and the tip)! I'm a huge fan of the Seoul Sassy. A side of rice costs extra, but I'm asian & I'll eat rice with literally anything, so I'll pay it. Free water from one of those Korean water tanks every Korean family owns. Waitstaff are friendly. I just like being here."
"Am I really adding value to Yelp with this review? With so many raving reviews online, probably not, but how could I pass up reviewing the best chicken wings of my life? Five wings here is more than enough for one grown man -- some people are full by their third one. The wings are huge! We tried the following wings: BBQ: 5/5 -- Delicious delicious delicious delicious. I could take the sauce alone, pile it on some rice, and have a good meal. Sweet yet super-flavorful. The best of the night. Buffalo: 5/5 -- Full of spice and full of flavor. What more can you ask for? BBQ was my favorite, but this made that decision very difficult. You cannot leave Crisp without trying both Buffalo and BBQ. Seoul Sassy: 3.5/5 -- I definitely liked it, but it was nowhere as good as the other two chicken wings. You can't go wrong with this one. But when the other two are just so good, why bother? The restaurant is located in one of the nicest areas in Chicago. So pretty and nice seating areas for nice days. See myself coming here for a long time forward."
I was visiting Chicago and decided to check this place out since and it was a pretty far travel but worth it. The Korean style fry chicken was pretty good and very crispy. I would recommend getting the plane Jane and asking for the sauces on the side so you know what you like before getting all the same flavors on the chicken. I would say the sauces are pretty much on the sweet side.
"dang hahaha man yep it's me, you know who it is, its me, big Willy P haha! I been writing a new book about music fest Boneroo and so havent had much time to make yelps, but i had a big memory of this place and so wanted to share it with my friends on yelp.  Anyway haha, here's my big review for Crips, a place I can now check off my list of places ive been to.I came here with the Mrs. (my ex gf christina) back in the fall of 2010, before our Big Fight of winter 2010. We came here cuz my best friend Toby said they serve food both hot and cold (this was before Toby lost his teeth cuz now he only eat mayo and water). It was true what Toby said but Crips lean mostly towards hot food temperature wise.THE FOOD: We ordered the crispies xtra cripsy with double sauce (sauce is my best thing to put on wingies here and it comes directly on the wingies which makes it an almost unstopable combo for wingies). We ordered and gave a man a couple of money papers, and he pushed some buttons and slid our money into some big machine on the counter. I asked is there a bank in there, it's so small, but he din't hear me, so i laffed it off and tried to give christina the kiss but she says we just friends. That made me nervous so I tried to give the banker guy a high five but he wasn't having none and somehow him and christna got to talking and it was like I didnt exist again. After a couple laffs she joined me at the table and the food came on a tray. Funny thing is I wasnt hungry cuz id eaten a couple packs of banana gogurt beforehand but christina she was always hungry and watching her eat is better than tv so that was fun!So overall i guess things just seemed so much simpler then, in 2010, between me and my ex gf christina. No worries, no responsibilities, no fights. my only complain is how fast time goes and that the hard memories are the last to fade 5stars"
Korean Fried Chicken. Why not? Not as good as Bon Chon in NY and Texas but it does the trick. The regular wasn't anything to write home about but the Seoul Sassy was pretty bomb. 10 pieces for $14.95.  The large basket of fries is large. Don't be greedy.
"Moving in the building directly next to Crisp has been truly dangerous for my waist line. Not to mention the ridiculous convenience the chicken is awesome and I kind of want to bathe in their Seoul Sassy sauce. Thus far I've tried the wings and strips and I gotta say the wings are worth the mess. I've also sampled the fries and the rice and in this case I gotta say go with the rice! The fries at Crisp are fine but nothin special. The only time I've truly enjoyed them is when I got takeout and doused them in vinegar. The rice on the other hand rocks. Also worth mentioning is the huge portions at Crisp, making it quite a steal for what you're spending. My only real qualm with this joint is that I wish it was open later! Crisp you're an inebriated girls' dream!"
"Food: Ordered two Big Boy Buddha Bowls (brown rice, added chicken) and 10 pieces of chicken wings (half Crisp BBQ and half Seoul Sassy). Total came out to be $60 including tip. The wings were good, both sauces were tangy and sweet. Crisp BBQ seemed a little dryer and Seoul Sassy had an orangy glow to it. Overall, decent. Chicken not crispy by any means, but decent fried chicken with good flavor. The bowls were huge, boyfriend and I shared two bowls over a course of a few days. Tons and tons of veggies in them, but rather average. Nothing extremely special about these bibimbap bowls other than Crisp charges for meat...? Weird. Crisp's menu is also very limited. It doesn't have anything else Korean. This is not a Korean place, it is a fried chicken and rice / veggie bowl place that just happens to have a huge stock of Korean hot pepper sauce. Service: Honestly, a little odd. I called in for a pickup order and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. I got there as the server calls my name and brings out my food on dine-in trays. It was so awkward when I had to tell him - that's my order and it was supposed to be to go. He then takes it back and tells the lady in the kitchen that the two bowls and a whole order of wings needed to be packed up for to go. She immediately complains, extremely loudly, ""AWWWW MANNNNN!!! WHATTT???"" and I was about 2 feet away from her. Awkward. About five minutes later, I finally get my food in a bag. The guy who brought out my food leaves, and I stood there for another 5 minutes waiting to pay. He then comes back and goes, ""Is there anything else you need?"" and I said, I need to pay...and he goes, ""Oh I thought you already did!"" So I could have walked out of there with all that food because the server was having a really bad day? hmm."
"Super fresh and flavorful! The baby buddha bowl was great for lunch, but the more veggies the better! Everything, from the rice to the vegetables to the meat was super delicious! Definitely going back more often."
"We ordered a whole bird with two sauces (don't ask me what sauces; I was drunk), and a bowl of rice with all kinds of goodies.  That was enough for four people.  I don't really remember perfectly, but I remember thinking the wings were awesome but the white meat left something to be desired."
"I'm not even a big fried chicken fan but their stuff is addictive. It's a hole in a wall kind of a place and was completely packed on a Saturday evening. We had 4 people and were lucky enough to grab a table because another group just left and ended up sharing our table with another couple. So be prepared to sit with random people. Now for the food, the chicken was finger licking good. We got the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ and Fried mushroom and Fries. There were few different types of sauces on the table so we tried different combos. Everything was delish and it's BYOB. We had some wine and beer to wash it all down and left very satisfied. Personal bias I liked the Crisp BBQ better than the Seoul Sassy. Not that the Seoul Sassy was bad but for me the BBQ had more flavor and didn't need extra sauce while the other one needed some extra sauce.Just writing this review is giving me a craving. Ok, I have to make another trip soon and get me some of that finger licking good Crisp BBQ Chikin."
It was ok.  Loved their signature sauce.  The chicken tenders I had were just ok - a little overcooked.  Hooters does fried chicken better in my opinion.Super nice staff!
They had me with their chicken wings (tried sassy and crisp bbq)! Love the taste and crispiness. It was pretty crowded (when is it not in a Lincoln park area)! Do try their rice bowls too since someone in the party ordered one and enjoyed it. You know the drill like a northsider. Dine early or order to go if you don't like crowds :P
"Crisp's wings, for lack of a better word, were a bit soggy. I tried both the seoul sassy and the crisp bbq sauce wings. The seoul sassy had a lot less sauce than the crisp bbq. Definitely preferred crisp bbq, although it was spicier. I had super high expectations coming in expecting this hot, saucy, crispy goodness, but instead I got a lukewarm, somewhat soggier version of what I imagined. The wings were huge and the sauce was delicious, but I wish they held true to their name."
Seoul sassy wings are great. The seating is limited and they close kinda early. Haven't tried much else on the menu.
"Mmmmm the steak bowl is delicious!!! I could eat that stuff forever. The portion is generous. The beef is flavorful. The rice is delicious. Honest to good though I could take or leave the chicken and wings though. I hear they're kind of the point of the place, but I really have had better. But very good food either way. Be careful when you decide to go if you want to eat in. Very small place and it is often packed full."
"I've been a huge fan of Crisp since they opened their doors and it's amazing to see that the quality of the food and the customer service has not diminished in any way.My all-time favorite menu item at Crisp use to be the Seoul Steak Sandwich (Korean beef, sautéed mushrooms, grilled onions, shredded jack cheese, mayo, lettuce and tomato), which was so good my tongue would do cartwheels after every bite. However, I don't see it on the menu anymore so I'm not sure if they still have it...maybe I should do the normal thing and ask!The chicken wings are definitely a must try when you visit Crisp. I like getting the wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce. It's definitely finger licking good.If you like chicken sandwiches you can choose between the Not So Common Crisp sandwich and the Foodie's Choice Crisp. The main difference between the two is that the Foodie's Choice Crisp comes with baby spinach, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles and atomic sauce whereas the Not So Common Crisp has American cheese and no bacon. I recommend the Foodie's sandwich because I'm a bacon lover.Crisp also has Buddha Bowls, but I've never tried those so I can't speak to how good/bad these are. I can say that my friend who is a picky eater ALWAYS gets the Original Bad Boy Buddha Bowl.All said and done I am a huge fan of Crisp, but I'm giving it 4 stars because I hate the communal tables. I'm not a fan of eating with randoms."
"There's something so deliciously comforting about the food at Crisp. Probably because the rice is perfectly made and a serving of perfect hot rice to me is like home. Crispy wings in the Seoul Sassy saucy, a side of rice and a side of bonchon (standard spinach, bean sprouts, carrots and zucchini) made for a delicious meal with plenty left over.  The folks at Crisp are not lying when they call their wings ""jumbo"".  These aren't itty-bitty wings, these wings were made for flying, er frying! I like my Korean style wings crispy and sticky from the sauce, to me, these didn't seem to have enough Sassy sauce on them. Looking over at my gal JW's chicken, her's seemed to have lots of sticky sauce to it, so maybe mine just got a little ignored in the kitchen.  No matter, there are other sauces on the table to add a bit of flavor and I added a bit of the hot Buddha sauce and it suited me just fine. JW shared some of her kimchi with me and it was very good too, crispy, spicy, tangy. What I love about Crisp is the selection of drinks in the cooler--a few Korean drinks including a favorite grape soda with actual grapes in them. Refreshing. Visited on a late Saturday afternoon and the place was hopping. Fun and friendly service, picnic style seating, BYOB. Great place."
Buddha Bowl was HUGE. I didn't think I'd like chilled veggies with steamed rice but it was pretty good. Definitely add the Seoul Sassy sauce because it's bland without some flavor.I got the boneless chicken tenders with the Seoul sauce and they were okay. Nothing I'd order again.Seating is communal and the space is pretty small but service was great.
"The first time I had the not so common crisp chicken sandwich it had been purchased five hours earlier and I just about had a mouth-gasm.I got to go for the first time this past weekend and have it fresh and OMG so good. I ordered a single and it was fried to perfection, doused in glorious seoul sassy sauce. Sure most people come here and get the wings or the bowls, but the sandwich is worth trying if you haven't. I can't count the amount of stares from those around at other tables that ordered anything else, and the looks of envy - I just clutched my sandwich tighter, as I thought for sure someone was going to swipe it out of my hands.I can't wait to go back and try everything else on their menu."
"Wow!!! This place is truly AMAZING! My friend and I stopped in on a Friday night after all the good things we have been hearing about Crisp randomly in the past week.As soon as I walked in I noticed 3 good signs: The place was PACKED, the food smelled DELICIOUS, and from the looks of other people's plates the chicken looked PHENOMENALWe ordered 10 wings. 1/2 of the spicy and the other 1/2 sweet Needless to say, we took our food to go and ate it in the car. It was magnificent. Best Korean BBQ in the city."
Def my spot for wings. Crispy and flavorful by far the best wings in chicago.
Came here cause I was craving wings.. Ordered 10 and only ate 4!  Huge wings I like the buffalo sauce the best but the other ones were legit.. Need to come back to try some of the other stuff.  Wings were salty but the customer service was 100%!  They were legit so nice and helpful.  Need to try this place again and update..
"My 12 yo nephew wrote this about Crisp:""Korean ChickenOh, Korean Chicken, you taste like juicy heaven that has been now granted to me because every time I eat you, you taste like peace.  You also smell like angel's hair (which is Italian pasta) but you two have one thing in common:  you explode in my mouth.  I think I've dedicated more than an hour to waiting for carry out and eating you because you are just like tasty power."""
"Me and my girlfriend were craving wings and we saw this wanted to try it out. I was amazed and will definitely come back. The wings the Cashier recommended were so good and full of flavor, definitely worth coming here and a good price"
"i LOVE Crisp Chicken!Seoul Sassy is like an elixir from the gods - I always order a few extra sides. The buffalo is good too. In my opinion, the Seoul Sassy is so good no need to split it up with other sauces, Seoul for the win!I usually order a full chicken with a side of some chicken tenders. BEST chicken tenders ever. The beef bowl is great but the amount of rice is overwhelming compared to the amount of beef, still tastey though. The chicken sandwich was so basic and messy, no need in straying from the tenders or whole chicken."
I seen this chicken joint on Cook Channel knew I had to try it out. I had to sesame chicken and the spicy barbecue delicious must try while in chicago great customer service.
"A fantastic place for lunch. Had a few dishes including the rice bowls and fried chicken. As far as fried chicken goes, their twist is a very well done Korean-style adaptation. Good skin, tasty batter and moist meat. Rice bowls and Korean style burrito is VERY substantial and is quite worth the price. Nice odd-ball beverage selection too for a refreshing change-up."
Best bibimbap I've tasted so far! Bad boy Buddha rocks!! :) chicken wings is really good!!! :)
"The BEST food in East Lakeview. It is delicious and they give you a huge portion. I always get a Buddha bowl, and I always have left overs. My boyfriend and roommates go crazy for their wings. If you're in the area and looking for a decently priced place to grab some food, Crisp is a MUST."
"Crisp is the BEST place to get Korean BBQ chicken. Hands down. You must go. You will not be sorry. In fact, you will find yourself crying at the thought of not being able to go get it more than once a week in order to not look like a crazy chicken fanatic to the staff. I wish they delivered to my area (Gold Coast).I live for the Seoul Sassy Steak bowl. It's just delicious. I don't know what their magical secret ingredients are (CRACK!?) but they are delicious. I also love the chicken strips and would recommend the BBQ flavor or the Seoul sassy sauce. The Allison's atomic sauce is also delicious to tone down the spice but then assault your tastebuds with a punch at the end. I mean, you simply must try Crisp at least once. It's amazing. Even if you don't like ""korean food"" you will enjoy the chicken here. Or the rice bowls. Or, anything. My only *warning* : if you are not getting your food to-go and are eating with a group, I would go at an odd time in the day. There is limited table space with a few counter seats, so it's really better to just order out."
"Swung by here for an early dinner while spending a couple nights in Chicago. It is hard to beat how flavorful and filling a meal here is for the price. We had the crispy chicken tenders, a bad boy buddha bowl and seoul steak bowl. Everything was extremely well done for a fast casual meal; would definitely go back."
"NOM NOM NOM I love love love the wings from here, they aren't just any ol' wings, they are korean BBQ wings and they are super super delicious and CRISP (haha) Ill definitely try to get out here during the week and get the whole chicken special!i can't wait to come back!"
"I saw Crisp on some food show a while back and thought I'd give it a try during my short stay in Chicago. I love ""KFC"" but this place was really a disappointment. The flavors were okay but the chicken wasn't that crispy, not crispy like the way fried chicken should be. Bonchon is way better, in my opinion. The Buddha bowls were just like any ol' bibimbap, and it cost extra to add meat. The sauces were nothing to race about either. You order at the counter, pickup your own food, and bus out table. Self-service all the way.-credit cards accepted-street parking only -messy if you get the wings... Make sure to wash your hands before and after, child!"
"everything about the service was positive: quick and friendly. even better - the food was on point. I got the 6pc boneless chicken strips with the bbq sauce. I was going to get the Seoul sassy sauce, but didn't. worried it would be too sweet. ended up trying a bite of my friend's and I actually liked it better than the bbq. I'll definitely be getting that next time. the BBQ was still good for what it is though. also, the servings of chicken are generous. don't worry about the prices. you get your money's worth. only criticism is the space is very small. not a deal breaker of course."
"I have long lusted over the Crisp Yelp reviews to the point that I made an ill-advised trip to Lakeview during the Air & Water Show (sidenote: Do you have an hour to spare in which you almost kill four bikers? No?)Mi madre et moi shared the whole chicken with seoul sassy sauce (yep, we took leftovers home to hubs) and the bad boy buddha bowl with chicken. Lots o' food for $30, totally tasty. Fresh, super flavorful. Kinda wish my office wasn't so far away so I could get some right about now. The crispiness and flavor of the sauce is better than anywhere else I've found. The location is small and casual. We were lucky to find a spot to plop down and get messy, but I think most people were taking their orders to go. Don't overlook this place for your must-have wing stop."
"The onion rings are onion rings, not the best or the worst I've had. The bbq sauce was definitely better than the Seoul sauce. It was juicier and more flavorful. It's a good level of spice. The steak bowl was huge! Maybe if you're starving, you can finish one. I'd come back if I was craving their rice bowls or for some good chicken wings."
"I've been wanting to try this place for entirely too long, but I finally made it out. Though I the food was good, I don't know that it was necessarily worth all of the hype. We ordered a Buddha bowl, BBQ wings and a burger. Though I felt like the bowl was a very healthy choice, it was pretty bland. The wings were nice, but mostly just spicy. The burger was probably the all-star dish that would bring be back for a second try. If I were to make a suggestion to anyone visiting, I'd say speak with the staff about what you should order. They are super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. When I return I'll be sure to have a longer conversation with them prior to ordering."
By far some of the best wings I've ever had. I tried the sassy seoul and bbq and would recommend these to anyone.The wings were fried perfectly and had a perfect balance of flavors. Meat confess right off the bone!Will be making a stop back here next time I'm in Chicago.
"The wings are what I originally came here for. But ever since I tried the steak bowl, that is my go to choice here. You really can't go wrong, anything you order will be good."
"I'm not even a wings person, and I fell in love with the wings here. My friends said, ""I think this place might be better than Plucker's"" in a hushed voice so as not to disrespect our alma mater staple -- but I seriously don't care for the wings at Plucker's at all. Korean wings at Crisp is where it's at.The batter is perfectly crispy without being dry, the portions are huge, and the sauces are to die for. I recommend the Seoul Sassy. I loved dipping it in their atomic sauce.What surprised me was the seating -- you sit with strangers if the place is full since they only have 3 picnic tables and 2 short bar seating areas. But we didn't mind!"
"Huge wings. Not a dingy bar food type of wing. It's a fill you up with just 5 type of wings. All the sauces are great. But get the atomic sauce to put it over the edge. Cons are that its cramped inside so don't plan on eating there if you have 3 or more people. Pay to park on the street unless it's Sunday but strictly on food, it's one of my go to wing places in the city. Fast, and delicious. Can't go wrong."
"Hot Wings so good it hurts. Yes, they're ""Korean style"" and not your classic Hooters or B-Dub style wings. But, I personally guarantee you won't miss Buffalos or Tits at Crisp.* These wings put all wings to shame.Better quality. More meaty. Superior flavor. Go half order order of the Seoul Sassy and half order of the Buffalo for the ultimate sweet, tangy, spicy, savory satiation experience.I'm having a Pavlov's Dog moment now just thinking about them.Crisp is the ultimate fried chicken.No, really. And if you're just plain cuckoo and not into wings, they even do awesome bowls, bi bim bop and a KILLER Korean Burrito. Did I say Korean Burrito? I did. Wrap beefy bulgogi, rice and veggies in a flour tortilla and douce with creamy Atomic sauce. Make mouth smile.Crisp rocks.  * I can't really guarantee you won't miss tits, bring your own"
"We've been dying to have korean fried chicken since we tried Boka in New York. It's such a cool, hipster joint. We ordered a half chicken with the Crisp bbq and a side of korean vegetables. It was delicious! The buddha sauce is like crack. It's so addicting. This restaurant is a little pricy, but totally worth it. You might have to wait around to find a place to seat, but it's totally worth the wait. We can't wait to bring our friends here."
WOW! And I really mean just WOW. So parking sucks and it's usually crowded so if you're planning on actually sitting down to eat here good lucky trying! It's more of a let's cruise to lakeview(if you're not actually in the city city like me)pick up these delicious wings and bounce. The wings in itself are HUGE. Don't let the menu discourage you when you see 5 per order cause that in itself filled me up let alone we had two orders. The flavors are so good! The onion rings are simply delicious and crunchy even getting them to go they didn't get soggy. We also got brown rice which was chewy and flavorful. I will say It's a bit overpriced but I'd say totally worth it!
"Pretend Korean food.  Really just a bunch of fried chicken.  Also, they like putting eggs on stuff."
"I read that this place had the best wings, so I had to see for myself. We ordered half Seoul sassy and half crisp BBQ. I don't like my wings too saucy, so I preferred the Seoul sassy over BBQ, but both delicious! I'd say it's kind of pricy, but once you see the size of these wings, you'll understand. We also ordered a steak bowl. Bowl of rice with marinated beef.That was yummy, and also a huge serving size. I didn't put 5 stars because it's a smaller space and I'm not a fan of sitting and eating so close to strangers or at the window. Otherwise, this is a must try!"
"This place is as good as it gets in the city, not one thing on the menu is even par...all delicious. Favorites are the steak bowl (w/ extra atomic sauce), full chicken deal & wings. I eat here 3x a week"
"Crisp one word excellent. Wasn't what I expected as far as the way the place looks. But the food was so good we had the Buddha Bowl, Sassy wings and Seoul wings! The wings were huge we added the sweet steak meat to the bowl, the bowl was huge enough for 2-3 people. The cashier recommend us to add the steak because they bowls are cold vegetables and it would warm it up a bit. It was a great suggestion the meat was perfectly seasoned and I liked the sauce on the table to put on the bowl. Since it was our fist time there the cashier let us get our drinks free that was really nice. Overall it's a great restaurant if you love fried chicken like I do. Before I forget they have a blue cheese dipping sauce (by request) it was very good I love wings and sauce. I look forward to going back for more!"
"Amazing fried chicken.  Very flavorful and moist, but with great crispy skin.  For 2 people new to crisp, highly recommend getting the full bird, half with sassy Seoul and half with crisp BBQ flavors.  Easily enough food for two people even without sides.  Skip the fries and try a small Buddha bowl if you want more food- the fries are forgettable and there are much better sides.Seating is very tight at this popular place, so avoid coming here with more than 3 people.order ahead to skip the wait time.There is a great deal on Monday through Thursday for a full chicken with 2 sides and 2 drinks for $20."
"I had the Seoul sassy and buds buffalo wings, both were good..I personally like the Buds Buffalo better! I must warn you..5 wings=10 wings, they're huge! :)"
"Let me tell you about the perfect meal for two to split at Crisp:-5 Seoul Sassy wings-5 Crisp BBQ wings-Baby Buddha Bowl-The drinks you brought with you since it's BYOBI know what you're thinking: just 10 wings? The wings, however, are huge and pretty much the size of normal fried chicken. It'll be just enough. Second thought: just the Baby bowl? Don't worry, it's pretty big!Definitely dunk your wings in the sauces that are on the table, particularly the Atomic sauce. I've tried the fries in the past, and they were a somewhat lackluster. I think the veggies in the Buddha bowl add some nice balance to the meal. Plus, this way you'll feel better when you walk right across the street for ice cream for dessert. ;)This place can get crowded, but it's worth the squeeze. If you wait a couple of minutes, some spots will likely free up among the farm tables and high top seating."
"I didn't see the hype on this one. If you're going on a Friday or Saturday be prepared to struggle looking for a parking spot, it's damn near impossible. There's a parking lot down the street and that was also packed. I also didn't care for the seating in this place. The wings here were huge and the Seoul Sassy sauce was tasty, but other than the big wings I didn't see anything ""WOW"" about the wings. We got there about 8:50 pm and they told us the dining area closes at 9:30 and boy were they serious about getting everyone done and out by 9:30 lol. The guy took the sauces off our table before I even knew what they were then while we were eating he asked us if we needed a to go box, I told you they were serious about closing up at 9:30. But the workers were friendly when I asked questions about the wings and flavors, so overall the service was good they just rush you a little too much. The wings were also a little dry/over cooked for my taste. If I'm in the area on a weekday, when I have a chance to find parking in less than 30 min and really have a taste for wings I'll stop by and give it another shot but until then this is not gonna be a spot I recommend or become a regular of."
You just need to try this chicken once for you to not stop going here. This Korean place is simple but so nice. Staff are cool is always full which mean people love it and food is so good. Seoul sassy sauce together with the chicken is so delicious but in general everything is great here.
"My favorites are the Seoul Sassy Wings, Original Bad Boy Buddha Bowl and the Seoul Steak Bowl.  If you get wings, eat in the restaurant so they're piping hot and perfectly crispy, everything else tastes just as good as carryout. I love their 2 signature hot sauces. Portions are huge and the leftovers taste great. The first time I tried Crisp, I went back the very next day for more.  Love Crisp."
"Baby Buddha bowl was huge! My friend got the steak bowl and it was legit as big as his, but the baby Buddha had way more in it! Needless to say, he was less than amused by this. I also ordered 3 piece sassy seoul tenders just to try the chicken. So good! Though they really do mean it when they say sassy seoul is not spicy AT ALL. Not even a little kick. If you do get spicy sauce, they have a free water jug towards the back orrrrrrr you can BYOB! I really wish we had known this before coming. I also might recommend carry out since this wing joint is pretty tiny. We tried to wait out a few table spots, but competition was seriously fierce. This inconvenience is why I deducted a star, but overall I can see why Crisp is so busy every time I walk by. I'll definitely be back - next time with beer in hand!"
"I love you, Crisp. I mean, like...I reeaaaally love you. I was hooked after my first visit and have been back a few times since. I am not normally a wing person but I am a fan of fried chicken and lover of kimchi. The chicken here (and the wings) are the real deal; meaty, moist, crisp. Seoul Sassy is my jam as is that mayo based sauce on the tables. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Kimchi is great too - fresh, crunchy, sour, spicy. It's firing on all cylinders. I also love the Korean Greens. The wilted spinach included in the KG mix is a comfort food for me and reminds me of my youth. But you know what else is surprisingly (or not so surprisingly) good here? The onion rings! They are battered and fried to perfection and served with a tasty ranch dressing. I've also tried the bulgogi bowl and that was pretty good too. A variety of soda including Korean sodas including Milkis. What a treat! I doubt there is anything at Crisp that I wouldn't love... Well, except the communal picnic style seating. I'm not a huge fan of this kind of seating but tend to forget about it when they bring out my big ass order of chicken, rice and kimchi. Definitely one of my favorite eats in the city."
"Ok I do not ever like to slam a place I never ate at, but I am very upset about how things went tonight.  I wanted this Korean fried chicken badly tonight.  I live in Bridgeport, and I walked a mile to the EL.  Rode the EL up to Belmont stop, then walked to this establishment, juuuuuust to find out they are closed until January 1st, what!!!!!!????  Every other friggin restaurant was open for crying out load!  And this stupid place decided to close for the whole entire holiday season without telling their would be customers on their damn website!!!  We looked at the website right before we left and it said NOTHING about them being closed over this extended period of time!  What a waste of time, and effort!  Not only to mention we got our hopes up for NOTHING!  You know what this says to me....?  It says they only care about business from people in Lakeview who will walk or drive by them all the time, no consideration for those of us that live in other neighborhoods, especially the fact I live on the south side!  This is also a terrible business practice because there are a lot of people off work during the holidays and visitors coming in from around the country that will be looking to dine out, and they chose to close while no one else did!!  I am mad because they did not update their site for the most part.  If they had done that, I would not be here slamming them right now.  I am so upset, me and my brother will NOT be coming here even when they are open because this is a slap in the face!Here is what it currently says on their website if you try to place an online order.  It still does not say January 1st like the store front sign says.Online Storefront is ClosedOnline storefront is currently closed and not accepting new orders.Storefront will reopen December 27 at 11:30 AM.Please contact the store for more information.The Current Time Is04:10 AMCENTRAL TIMEASAP LEAD TIMESCarryout: 20 minutesDelivery: 60 minutesSTART YOUR ORDER1.

Why do I eat anywhere else? This place is amazing and my go-to when I have friends visiting from out of town. There isn't a bad item on the menu.
"I ordered the boneless super strips. The menu says you get 3, but I got 4 because one of them was pretty small. The Crisp BBQ was just the right amount of spicy, and I can't wait to try the Seoul Sassy. I also got the fries, which were decent. I ordered online and went to pick it up. The cool thing is it's ready in 20 minutes, and they don't cook the fries until you get to the restaurant, so they are as fresh as possible when you get them home. It's a good amount of food for the price, and very flavorful. I will be back!"
"Food here is very photogenic, especially their bowls. After seeing my friend's pictures, I knew this was one of the places I wanted to try when I visited Chicago.Portions can be quite large and it's very easy to share. The three of us shared a big buddha bowl with brown rice and 10 wings - 5 Crisp BBQ and 5 Seoul sassy. FYI their wings are the ENTIRE wing. Yes, all three sections (dumbstick, flapper, and tip), so we basically got 20 wings and it was plenty! My personal favorite was the Crisp BBQ flavor since it was a bit less saucy and sweet.The bowl was decent. It was a nice break from the wings, but I thought it had TOO many vegetables. I did not like the random raw spinach leaves floating around. Also, where's the meat? Typically, bibimbap doesn't have that much meat, but it was almost nonexistent in this bowl.Overall, I really enjoyed the food. The interior could use some work because they have huge bulky tables and benches when there's not much room in the first place."
"Crisp is about 15 miles from my house, but when I am within 5 miles of crisp, there was an 85% chance that I am going to stop there. My better half likes the sweet and sassy wings, while I enjoy the wings with atomic sauce. This is the best wing place I've ever been to, and wouldn't you trust a wing place that has a Zagat rating? I sure would. So what are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? Go to crisp and eat wings until you are fat and happy. I am fat and happier."
"Don't think there's anything I can say that you can't find in the other reviews but to summarize - delicious flavors on their wings, a bit pricey, but don't be mistaken that these wings are HUGE. You might think that a 10pc meal doesn't sound like much but each one is pretty much a pterodactyl wing. 10 is definitely enough to share. Their fries are also thin and crispy. A satisfying meal and look forward to trying their Korean style burritos next visit!"
"Yes, this place is my ultimate GUILTY PLEASURE. I do love a quick order from here that I rush home to devour in a quiet shameful moment of gluttony. No shame! Extra Atomic sauce please and Thank You! :-) These guys are always upbeat and polite in handling orders. Rock on Hipster Chicken Shack! :-) This place is a must go to!"
"During a particularly gluttonous season ages ago, in what I now realize was a cruel twist of fate, my former roommates and I discovered Crisp.It was the beginning of the end for us I suppose, as our feral Crisp addiction led to many a night of greasy fingers, sauce-stained faces, and gradually expanding waistlines. With support from friends, family, and a local priest, I was able to exorcise my delicious demon. Eventually even walking by their storefront, chicken smells wafting through the cool air, the jovial faces of satisfied customers peering back at me, I was able to resist temptation.Then it happened. A few libations in and with my lady and ravenous friend in tow, we passed by on a Saturday night. The smell consumed us. Visions of perfectly fried chicken, drenched in the sauce they call ""sassy"" danced in my head. The temptation was too much to resist. Pray for me."
"You really can not go wrong with anything ordered here. The wings are so tasty and addicting. The Buddha bowls are very filling. The only downside is when their busy, it's hard to find a place to sit."
"Lunch for two consisted of the Chi-Town Chicken Burrito (split in half) with 5 gigantic wings which were marinated in Bud's Buffalo saucy. My lady and I were very pleased with the food plus the environment of the place was filled with good vibes. We will definitely be back! High-Five Crisp, High-Five."
Have done carry out a few times and it has been excellent.  Quick to pay and very good wings.  Job well done!
This place is unreal! I discovered Crisp 2 years ago from a recommendation from a friend. Now I'm there no matter what 2 or 3 times a month!
"If I was rating this place on the wings alone, it gets ten stars. Some of the best wings I've ever had. So crispy and the Seoul sassy glaze is just amazing. They are whole wings (drumstick and wing) so keep that in mind when ordering. Also, if you check in on yelp you get a whole chicken, two sides, and two drinks for $19.99.The bulgogi burrito was a little bland to me. Good size but lacked serious flavor. A little more bulgogi sauce would go a long way. Meat is tender though. They do give you sauces on the tables to work with but it's not the same."
"What else can I say... if you haven't had Korean Chicken Wings yet, go get you some. Went with the Whole Chicken combo with 2 sides and drink.. all the food was piping hot and made to order. Fried Mushrooms were great and the onion rings were good, too. I still want to know what brand of magic they use to fry the skin so hard and flavorful and the meat be so juicy. Good bet."
"I have to say, I was extremely disappointed with the customer service from this restaurant.  I don't normally write yelp reviews, but I had to put this on here so they can improve.  I was extremely excited to try Crisp and called to put in a delivery order.The employee on the phone who took my order said it would take a little over an hour until it would be delivered.   No worries there, I live a couple blocks away but I figured they made it fresh.  About 2 minutes later I realized I made a mistake on the order and called back to change it.  The employee refused to accommodate my request even though there was no money difference and the time to deliver was supposed to be over an hour.  He said the reason was ""we are a fast food restaurant.""  It was only a couple minutes from when I put in the initial order that I made the change.At that point, I decided to cancel the order.  Not only did he make me feel bad about it, he said that my number would be put on a ""do not order"" list and I wouldn't be allowed to order again.  This has never happened to me before at any restaurant.  Sadly, you lost a customer for life and I've told friends about the experience as well.  Really too bad, was looking forward to trying this place."
"Some of the best wings in Chi. If you're a wing lover, this should be one of your first stops for sure. Always a good decision"
Excellent
"I LOVE CRISP!!!!  Sorry for yelling, but I love it.  That much.  Everyone needs to know how awesome they are.This is the type of place that when I think about it, I start salivating.  Great.  Now I'm salivating.  I live in Aurora and I have made the special 44 mile trip just to eat here.  I would love to try other things, but every time I think about Crisp, I think of that delicious Seoul Sensation burrito.  It's so good I start swearing at it.  The ingredients are so fresh, the meat is so tender and flavorful.  I don't really like hot stuff, typically, but I am in love with Alice's Atomic sauce and I ask for extra now so I'm not rationing it.  It's pretty cramped in there and any time I've gone, it's completely packed to the gills.  It's small and they only have a few ""picnic"" style tables.  So you might be sitting next to someone you don't know, if you can find a seat, but it really doesn't matter because you are at one with your food there and no one else exists, in that moment.  I have rubbed up against many strangers, unintentionally, just to get my burrito.  That's how packed it always is.  I usually just take mine to go and eat it in the car.  It can be a little messy, but oh so worth it!  Even though I can only vouch for the burrito, I am confident that everything here is 5 stars! Go now!"
"It's probably been a few years since I last ate here but if my memory serves me correctly, these are some of the best wings I've ever had! The sauce is delicious and perfect amount of sweet/spicy. I was in Chicago for maybe 4 or 5 days and had to come here twice because I loved it so much the first time. Haven't had Korean fried chicken anywhere else yet that matches up to Crisp! Definitely go check this place out!"
"Got carryout from them. 15 wings, plain, bbw, and sassy seoul. All the wings were delicious. Quick service, they were nice as crispy. This place isn't cheap, but if you're willing to splurge, you'll have a good meal."
"Oh, Crisp. Is it possible to write enough praise for you? Are there words in the english language that cover my love for you? Will I name my firstborn after you? Answers: no, no, and probably yes.If you're a lakeview resident, you HAVE to come here. Hell, even if you aren't find a way to get here. Yeah, it's pretty pricey. The actual restaurant is pretty small. And BOY it gets packed in there. But the chicken... I could eat it the rest of my life and die happy.Their Korean fried chicken is just amazing. The spicy flavors are good, but go with the Seoul Sassy. Trust me. I recommend the foodie's choice sandwich - perfect chicken sandwich. I've been getting in the bad habit lately of ordering it double - probably more food than my stomach was designed to fit, but WORTH. The chicken wings are awesome as well; probably the crispiest, crunchiest fried chicken out there that has so much flavor. Oh, and if that's not enough for you, the fries are thin and INCREDIBLY crispy. Perfection. Make sure to load up on the light colored ""Atomic"" sauce they have lying around on the tables - it's not too spicy, but full of great flavor.I had a buddah bowl once which was... alright, but not enough to make me dock them any points. Oh, and did I mention the cool, nice guys working there? And the multiple big screen TV's they have playing awesome movies while you wait? Just go to Crisp."
"This place is my go to take out craving need to carb up on some delicious chicken. When in doubt about dinner I go to Crisp. This restaurant has not let me down yet food, atmosphere, staff or getting my order right. They have consistently had my take out ready at the time they said and have some of the quickest turn around rate possible. Which all produces the best Korean bbq chicken that i have had in this city and cannot get enough of. The rest of their food is priceless and fresh that it all feels so natural it could not be produced in the city but it is. I can say living a short distance away I love going back to this place time and time again, it taste better the more you have it."
"Everyone was happy with their various meals. Two of us got bowls, and two burritos. The difference between the big and baby bowls, or whatever they're called, is apparently not the quantity of food, but the number of veggies one can pick, and we decided there were options we could easily pass on. We also had to try the wings. They were good, large, meaty, and the sassy Seoul sauce was nice. There are lots of sauces on the table. The food came more quickly than I expected. The place was full, and seemed to do a brisk takeout business, too. I though the prices were totally standard for this brand of upscale fast food, around or just under about $10 for an entree, and a bit more for wings and drinks and such. We also thought it was nice that they continue taking orders until closing time rather than stopping so they can be totally done with customers right at closing time."
"Came here and ordered 10 wings (half with each sauce) and the Baby Buddha Bowl to share with 2 friends. The wings are outta this world, with the meat super tender and the sauces on point. The veggies in the bowl were fresh and delicious as well. The only thing I'm not a complete fan of is the picnic table-style seating; it gives the restaurant a friendly appearance but can get a little awkward."
"Got the spicy buffalo tenders... it was pretty good and slight heat. I'd probably try the suicide next time cause I like spicy things. They def give you around four pieces instead of 3 which should be enough to fill you up. I ended up getting 6 pieces (so around 8) and I was beyond full. The seoul sassy didn't do anything for me, I would skip that next time and stick with the buffalo."
"I was SO excited to try Crisp and it didn't fail to amaze me!  I love chicken wings, and Crisp delivered tender, juicy, and super flavorful wings!  The hubs and I shared the five piece wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce and the Baby Buddha bowl.The wings were phenomenal!  They are super big and one piece was quite filling.  The skin is crispy and is smothered in this delicious sticky and flavorful finger lickin' sauce!  As soon as you bite into the wing, the juices begin to flow.  The wings are very tender and meaty!  The Baby Buddha bowl was refreshing and had amazing flavor with the simple ingredients.  The wings accompanied this dish well.  I mixed up some of the Seoul Sassy sauce with the rice and it was soooo good!  Staff is very friendly and the place was poppin'!  It's a small restaurant with communal tables and few single stools that look out to the street.  If you don't like sharing tables with strangers, you might want to consider take out.  Either way, try this place- you won't be disappointed!"
Amazing chicken. I actually had the foodie sandwich myself and loved the cheese and spinach. My boyfriend had the chicken and I am still craving it days later. Generous portion sizes erase the initial sticker shock of the prices. There isn't too much seating but people are constantly coming and going so you'll probably find a place to sit. I am definitely going back.
"I imagine this is the wing place that the most interesting man in the world goes to because they have the most INCREDIBLE wings and it appears to be a little hole in the wall. They are almost always pretty busy though. Each wing is actually 2 wings (both a thigh and a drum), so don't order too much - eat responsibly. The rice bowls are also awesome, great beef and nice veggies. The sauces are NUTS (both buddah and atomic) and I honestly have nothing bad to say about anything I've ever eaten there. Due to the sensitive nature of the fried wings, you MUST consume on premises and cannot do takeout. If you leave with them in a container the steam will render them soggy and only 1/3 as good as they could be. The flavor will be there, but the texture will not.The place is really small, but they offer a decent amount of seating for the size. Sunday afternoons seem to be really packed, but it's still worth it, I promise."
"I have literally driven from Aurora to this place just to have a Korean Burrito.  They are amazing.They taste so fresh.  The meet is so tender and spiced just right.  I am in love with Allison's Automatic Sauce!!!! I need a truck filled with this stuff parked in front of my house.I've also tried the Buddha Bowl, and it also blows my mind.I want desperately to try there wings but it's never on my mind when I drive there.  Always when I drive home with a fully belly.I am so glad this place is not down the block from me.  Cause I would literally only want to eat here and nowhere else.  Then I would only have 1 yelp review.Seriously this is a gem of the North Side.Don't think you're going to get a table here unless you don't mind sitting next to a total stranger.  But, I eat mine in my car.  I got no shame."
Was originally going to DMK for a burger with friends and when the hostess said it's an hour wait we decided to walk to crisp and from my previous experience I knew that I am not ordering  Seoul sassy and bbq for the wings because it's too sweet for my taste so I decided to order a plain half chicken and buffalo 5 wings and luckily a friend suggested a Seoul steak bowl boy was that delicious I loved the Seoul sauce with the steaks and the rice it's perfect unlike with the fried chicken I am going to be back for the rice bowls not the wings
Dakota steak bowl with their Allison atomic sauce is my favorite lunch. Sauce is so good that I purchased a pint just to have at home.This is one of those restaurants that I should try other things but the steak bowl and wings are soo good that I've never been able to justify trying other things.
Both Seoul sassy and BBQ wings are really good. The small fries are enough to share with a friend.  One of the best wings I've tasted in Chicago other than Great Sea.
"This place is absolutely GENIUS. My family and I ordered 10 wings (half BBQ/half Seoul Sassy) onion rings, fried mushrooms, and the bad boy Buddha +Beef. OMG everything was on point. The rice bowl was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten and I'm a FOODIE.  Not only was the food to die for, but the customer service was beyond compare. We came all the way from CO to the Windy City and this was a major highlight on our trip (they even gave us free shirts) lol. Crisp gets an A+ in my book"
"Food is good. Wings are delicious, bowls are just okay. The bowls are usually cold when they arrive, but they are big and pretty good. They charge extra for brown rice which kind of annoys me, but whatever. My guy and I usually get one bowl and five wings and that is totally enough food. My big complaint about Crisp is their furniture and set up. It is so dumb! They have these giant long, wide, heavy tables and then long, wide, heavy benches to sit on it's tiny in there. It's always crowded, so there is intense competition for the seating, and you have to sit awkwardly with strangers, which you can tell nobody likes. Once you've secured a spot on a bench near the wall, there is no getting up and you are trapped. It's just stupid. They should get some smaller tables so you can comfortably eat a meal. I hate getting food to go from here, too, because they put everything in styrofoam which is environmentally irresponsible. Went today, on a Monday at 2 pm, and it was a crazy shit show in there, so I can't even imagine how it is on the weekends. I would not be surprised if there were fistfights or stabbings over securing a table."
I went here to try the wings with a couple of my friends since I heard it was good. I share the Seoul sassy wings with my friends and it was really tasty. I had the Seoul sensations which was really good. It's in the lakeview neighborhood and the place is not that big but a good enough size to dine in. I would go back to this place if I am in the neighborhood. But I see this place is popular for diners to take take out which is convenient for them living in the neighborhood.
"Amazing food! I love that this is right down the street from me - it's easy, quick, and delicious every time. The wings are fantastic, as is the atomic sauce (perfect with fries or just about anything else). I decided to branch out today and went with one of their sandwiches. I did the foodie one with the bacon and blue cheese. I WILL be getting this again. It was so amazing. Honestly it's sad to see this compared to any other chain fried chicken joint. I like my fried chicken, sure, but this is on a whole different level, especially when it comes to flavor."
"I hate, hate, hate chicken wings. I don't even like chicken wings. In fact, I don't even remember eating chicken wings as an adult. Now all I ever eat is boneless, skinless chicken breast. However, my niece met up with her foodie friends on Saturday evening. She brought back an extra order of their chicken wings. After insisting that I try at least one chicken wing, I gave in to her request, and well, Crisp changed my mind about these facinorous chicken wings! If you are searching Yelp and have landed at the Crisp reviews you need not search Yelp any further. STOP searching Yelp, and experience Crisp for yourself. Yeah, yeah, bada-bing, bada-boom, you are definitely at the right spot for the number one spot in Chicago for chicken wings (that's what the other reviews say). Tender and meritorious bursting with an outstanding crispy, flavorful exterior. The sauce was ethereal. The savory and sweet amalgamation was definitely a trouvaille in my book. These chicken wings look like they came from a baby turkey -- yeah, they are actually pretty large-sized wings. I do not have any thing to compare these wings to so for this reason I have to be fair and rate these wings at 4-stars. Of course, I can see from the other reviews that they are worthy of 5-stars. My niece said the wings are 5-star worthy. I trust her judgement. According to my niece, the joint was super crowded on a Saturday evening despite the frigid cold temps and service was average. The worst part was finding a legal parking spot in the area. It was challenging (according to my niece).Crisp, thanks for the divine, meritorious chicken wings!"
"Top choice for fried chicken in Lakeview. Jumbo wings is not an exaggeration in the least. The wings are HUGE. I made the (happy) mistake of getting ten for myself (half Seoul Sassy, half hot buffalo), and I had plenty of leftover food to snack on later. I was very happy with my sauce choices, but used the atomic sauce on the side to give the Seoul Sassy an extra kick.My favorite thing at Crisp has to be the Not So Common Crisp. With the hot buffalo sauce, it is the best spicy fried chicken sandwich I've had, and I fully intend to try it with every sauce.For how popular this place is, there isn't a ton of seating, and when dining in, you tend to wait a while for the wings. That being said, I prefer to get delivery or carry out to cut down on the wait. All the staff I've interacted with have been so nice and helpful.Crisp is a neighborhood must."
Awesome fried chicken. My friend and I split the Seuol Sassy and the Crisp Bbq and both were excellent. Each piece had a big amount of meat and a 12 piece whole chicken is only $14 which I think is very reasonable for the amount and how well known Crisp is. I definitely recommend ordering online. We did at 6:00 on a Sunday and walking in to pick it up was insanity. Thankfully they had ours ready to go so we were in and out in a minute. If you haven't been and in the area its a must. Great hangover food.
"I mean...unreal. Who even knew Korean fried chicken was a thing, ya know?! The wings are outstanding as are the bowls, especially the steak bowl. High quality veggies in the bowls too, and they are quite large for the price (easily two meals). Really, the only downside is that this place is so small! Lucky for me, I live in perfect takeout range."
Best chicken wings I have ever had. BBQ chicken wings were my favorite!!!  super fast service and reasonably priced.
"The good: Delicious food, great menu, fast service. Their chicken is fantastic and their sauces are amazing. You get tons of food and lots of veggies. Fast service that is friendly.The bad: Not a lot of spots to sit. This is not a sit down restaurant. It's usually busy, so it may be hard to find a place. Pretty bland atmosphereOverall: Crisp is the PREMIERE  spot for a great lunch or casual dinner. Fresh, delicious, and fast, it is right up there with the best. Not good for a sit-down/waiter experience however.Atmosphere: 7/10Service: 8/10Food: 10/10"
These are some of the most amazing wings I've had.  Huge full wing crisped to perfection and the sweet chili sauce is just the right amount of heat.  I got 8 wings and could only finish 4 of them but they are mighty tasty.  Will definitely order again.
"This place is awesome!!! Try any of the Buda bowls, those are delicious and packed with veggies. Fresh, healthy and so tasty!"
"Super delicious food and a bit more unique concept for those nights when you are sick of pizza. We tried a few things, I loved the chicken strips and a bunch of sauces. My friends had the bowls and said they were pretty darn good as well. We live around the corner so I would probably get it to go from now on. The restaurant is small and may be hard to get a seat. My other issue is that the food is spicey, and drinks come by the can. I need a pitcher of something when I eat spicey. But if you can handle it, go on and eat there.Its a great little shop and really good food. Give it a try, there is something everyone (even little kids) will enjoy!"
"The jumbo wings are delicious and, indeed, jumbo. Must try the Crisp BBQ/Sassy Seoul split. The bowls are incredible as well, and they have a few great sauces to go along with it. The servers and delivery people are super friendly. The food is always incredible!"
"I order 16-20 individual orders on one check for my company. It is great to find places that can accommodate that - and Crisp was great with it both times we've ordered. The food is delicious and everyone is always happy with it. The only catch is that they messed up one of the orders our second time. Which isn't a big deal - things happen with big orders. The part that was bad was that an hour after I asked them to send a replacement it still had not arrived. I called and spoke with the manager, Alden. He told me that he has a restaurant full of people and is moving as fast as he can.I find it incredibly disappointing that they could not move up one order of chicken on the priority list to make up for a mistake that they made."
"My boyfriend and I found this place randomly, before we knew they're sooo famous in Chicago. We tried both Seoul Sassy & Crisp BBQ flavor, undoubtedly we all love the former. The bowls are good though, but the WIHGS!! OMG You MUST try them!Comfortable and casual interior with bench seating and self-service; will be a little bit crowed at rush hour."
Yummy. Yum. Yum. some of the best wing dingers...yummy chicken sammies.. and if you like healthy stuff the Buddha bowls are special.
Best wing place wish this place was close to my house. The sauce on the wings are great. I personally love hot stuff but their other flavors are good as well.
"I FINALLY got a chance to try CRISP and....boy-o-boy did folks not let me down here! Every last expectation was exceeded. Previous attempts to visit the establishment left me wanting more...they do private catering/parties and shut down on some of the least desirable nights so I would suggest to call ahead to be sure this place is open if you are kind of far. Had both Crisp BBQ and Seoul Sassy wings AND a Buddah Bowl I definitely do not suggest getting all of this food at once unless you're sharing and prepared to have TONS of leftovers. The wings are pretty big wings that come in a minimum set of 5 and the bowls are more like hulking mixing bowls.I was sharing them with the momski who is a sort of connoisseur of wings and  she was highly impressed at the flavor depths.  Every bite of the wings and bowl were absolutely fantastic.  While both flavors were excellent all around, we both put our hands in for the last piece of Ms. Sassy and of course relinquishing the last wing I ate the last Crisp BBQ wing almost just as happy.   At the end of the meal we both agreed that the Seoul Sassy wings were the way to go....not too spicy and good texture.I like the fact that the menu is not too big, they do a few things and they do them well. The dining area consists of just a few shared picnic tables, but I dug it.I will be back and I suggest others to give this place a try."
"I came here for the first time and I'm pretty obsessed.  I've been thinking about the yummy wings nonstop since they met my face.  My boyfriend and I ordered 5 Seoul Sassy wings, 5 Crisp BBQ wings, and fries.  They did not disappoint.  The fries were fine but the wings were definitely all I needed to be happy.  My friends ordered the buddha bowl and it looked amazing.  I will DEFINITELY be back -hopefully sooner rather than later since I can get the delightful chicken wings from an angel off my brain.  I have developed a severe drooling problem ever since.  I think about the wings and salivate uncontrollably.... thanks, Crisp.  I'm addicted."
"This was our second visit, as we wanted to give this place another shot after an ""OK"" experience. We literally just at here and are definitely regretting it now. We decided to do takeout and were screwed over with some really old chicken that was clearly fried twice (I know, I've worked in restaurants). We paid $17 for some beat up chicken and dont really recommend this place for take out. I'm sure it may be okay when you can see the chicken you're eating...."
"Amazing chicken wangs!I ordered 10 chicken wings to be shared between a friend and I and we could barely finish them. The chicken wings were on steroids; they were huge. We tried Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ and I have to say the Crisp BBQ was the winner. The restaurant was small with 3 large table benches. I would recommend sitting at the table by the windows and sit facing the windows so you can secretly lick you fingers (unless someone is looking back at you from the other side of the window...awkward).Make it a meal and order a side of rice. I like to pour sriracha on my rice. Yum. I put sriracha on everything. If I lived in Chicago, I'd eat this everyday."
Visiting cousin recommended to try this joint. I loved the wings. I gave my review a four star because the bad Buddha bowl I received didn't have piping hot steamed rice and I got worried about the sunny side up egg not getting cooked  in the process (I saw some uncooked egg whites surrounding the yolk) . In the end I thought the bowl was delicious with the huge variety of veggies they added.  If I ever return I hope my rice would be hot.
"My husband and I stopped  there this past weekend before heading to Lincoln Park Zoo. I ordered the Baby Buddha Bowl and my husband had the steak burrito. Can I say, OMG! The burrito was ginormas! It was filled to the gills with layers of rice, bilgogi, carrots, lettuce and corn. He said it tasted awesome. As for my bowl, Holy Bulgogi, it had a lot of food. We both had Crisp leftover for dinner that night! Soooo YUMMY! We're definitely going back and this time I'm getting their wings!"
"Oh my, so awesome! Thank you Yelp! This is a good find! After being ripped off by HBFC, I was on the lookout for the best chicken in Chi-town or, at least, a decent meal that won't cost a day's pay. So glad I found Crisp through the Yelp-vine!!! I ordered Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ as well as Baby Buddha.  The chicken is so amazing! They were packed full of flavor and crispy and they were excellent even without the sauces. I didn't get the yelp deal which is only available Mon-Thurs but it's an excuse to go back!!!Overall definitely recommend and definitely worth a trip to the city!UPDATE:Day 2 Crisp chicken still tastes so goood!!!"
"Ok, every time I come here I love it more and more. Buddha Bowl - get it!! doesn't matter what size. Get it with the beef. SOOOOO tasty...and use the buddha sauceWings - They're known for the fired chicken for a reason. Only get spicy if you are ready for REAL heat. All sauces are good.Not so Common Crisp - get it with the spicy BBQ. Perfect heat level. Perfectly cooked on a soft but not mushy bun.I come here way to often...."
Totally awesome chicken wings!!! I was expecting little wings like KFC but not these at all. We tried all the flavors and my fav was the Seoul sassy soo yummy!!! I'd def come back. Oh and they deliver too.
"I came here with my boyfriend almost 3 in the afternoon, and let me tell you... it was crowded. We personally thought it wouldn't be since lunch hours were over, but we were wrong. However, we got our food fast and piping hot. We ordered the Big Buddha Bowl with beef and the well-known Seoul Sassy wings. The pickled vegetables went nicely with rice. It was a good ratio of vegetables to rice and meat - sometimes places skimp out. I also enjoyed how they offered brown rice as an option for you healthy eaters. It was a huge portion that we had to take left overs.Now, the wings, were delicious. Perfectly crisp skin with their light soy glaze and other good stuff.. and the moist tender wings. It was blissful to indulge in.  Also, they have some white sauce with pepperflakes at the tables. I don't know but if you decide you need a palate changer, this sauce does wonders!My only complaint would have to be the lack of space. It was crowded and quite uncomfortable. However, food was excellent! I would definitely come back."
"I have only started eating Korean Fried Chicken for a couple of years and in Houston there are only a few places where you can get it.  So when I travel I try my best to visit a place that has a high quality product.On this particular trip to Chicago, I stalked one of few people I follow, Jeffrey C's Chicago reviews.  I basically at least considered anything he rated a 5 star.  One of my other good friends Alexander W's 5 star review confirmed the visit.It's a decent ways away from our hotel but luckily it was pretty close to a rail so the trip out wasn't bad.When you walk in, it's a small restaurant with mainly family style tables and a few spots along the walls of counter space.  You order first then look around for a seat.  It just works out that by the time you get your food a spot usually opens up.  Most of the locals do take it to go which helps.We ordered 10 of the whole jumbo wings, and crisp bbq and seoul sassy as the sauces.  I recommend getting both sauces so that you can alternate wing flavors.  I enjoyed both a lot, you can't go wrong either way because the wings are fried really well.  Crispy and not greasy.  We also ordered an original bad boy buddha, which was their version of bi bim bap, we added beef to the bowl.  It was good, but definitely not a MUST have.  So make sure you get the chicken and you won't regret it."
"Chicken was delicious. Really crispy skin and moist and juicy inside. We got the $19.99 deal which comes with one whole chicken, two sides, and two cans of pop. We had two sauces, the Seoul Sassy and a spicier Asian sauce that I'm forgetting the name of. I could have used more sauce on the chicken but it was good paired with their Buddha sauce. The service was great and very friendly and the food came out at a decent time. The Buddha bowls also looked delicious and I will probably try one next time I'm there. Overall, pretty yummy and great value!"
"Today marked my second trip to Crisp. After getting the wings last time, i decided to try the half chicken - Seoul sassy style. While not as good as the wings, it was still a very solid take on fried chicken. As other yelpers have stated, the food is massive so it's meant to be shared (or order the small portions). Next time I will try one of the bowls to see if if they are better than Del Seouls."
"BEST Korean chicken wings ever. Beats Great Seas on Lawrence.If you're ever in San Francisco, beats San Tung Restaurant.My brother ordered 5 wings for us to share (along with a side order of fried mushrooms). My first thought was, ""Whaaaaat, are you cheap? I want more wings!!"" It ended up being a decent amount of food that left me satisfied (and with enough room for dessert). They're not kidding when they call these wings jumbo. Each wing consists of a flapper and drummette. The whole damn wing. So an order of five wings is equivalent to ten at any other restaurant/bar.The interior is small. Tight seating. Four large tables with bench seating, that sits about eight people each (or more if you cram them in). Bar area by the window (seats four), and by the wall (seats six)."
"When you deep fry anything twice you cannot go wrong. YOU HAVE TO GET THE SEOUL SASSY! Come with friends, come alone, order for delivery..whatever you do, do not live your life without trying CRISP."
Their Korean fried chicken is good but feels a hair overpriced for what you get. The Seoul Sassy Chicken Tenders are tasty. It's good comfort food in a great neighborhood--a nice spot to go a few times a year.
Fried chicken HEAVEN. The Korean flavors give it an edge. Seriously.... If someone can make fried chicken taste better than it is... How could you not give it a try!
"You ever hear of the movie 'Midnight Meat Train'? Not the porn version -- I'm talking about the regular ole film version of the Clive Barker short story. Don't worry if this piece of cinematic magic is news to you, the rest of the review will have nothing to do with this flick -- plus, I'm gonna spoil it for you right here: Reptile people + the tried and true lesson that when you see something strange going down on the subway, you just better mind your own damn business and keep on your merry way. Where was I again?  So those two versions of Midnight Meat Train are the ones that the general public is more likely to know about, but MY midnight meat train is actually a train of thought where when it gets late and I'm alone, I entertain the thought of giving up the whole vegetarian thing I've been working on the past 5 or 6 years, and sneaking some bites of something that used to be alive. Something that's now taken on the form of fried chicken or bacon or beef jerky or anything that's really sh*tty for you and once had a heart. To date, I've been able to resist purchasing my ticket to ride the midnight meat train of thought, but f*ck is it ever gonna be hard now that I've tasted the sweet, spicy sauces cloaking Crisp's fried chicken flesh. It's pretty much all I can think about, and that's not a good sign for my feathered friends. Today was the first of many future visits to Crisp, thanks to tag-team combo of Danny W and the serendipitous running into of Matt ""Lollycakes"" L. Less any poultry fragments in the spoonful of sauce I scraped off Danny's basket-o-chicken bits, I refrained from hopping on the noon o' clock meat train, but that sauce... F*ck. it was so good. So good I literally ate it alone with a spoon. For my meal I got the Big Boy Buddha bowl with tofu, which is pretty much a bibimbap blend of goodies. It was enough for lunch, second lunch while I sat in traffic for two hours on my drive back to the 'burbs, pre-dinner (or as Hobbits would call it, elevensies) and will likely last through my real dinner as well. At $11 for an almost literal trough full of food, I'd say that's a steal. Inside is pretty tiny and they've got the whole communal table set-up thing going, which I definitely hate, but I guess when you're working with such a small space, it'd be hard to do anything but. All the napkins, chopsticks, etc are in the middle of the tables, and you have to share sauces with everyone else at your table (also hate sharing), so that kind of stinks, but what're ya gonna do? I lathered my bowl in sriracha, but I would've love to try their Buddha sauce. Unfortunately, it was across the table and when I weighed out my options and I decided I'd rather not have to make any conversation and not have the sauce, than have it, so perhaps next time I can better align myself to be on the side of the table that houses all the sauces so having to socialize is a non-issue. The counter people were refreshingly friendly and they have Honest Tea in like eight different flavors so you know I was happy because that sh*t is good as hell. If you haven't had it, defo try maxin' on some white peach flavor. I can't wait to go back... and attempt to resist boarding that meat train."
"mmmmm Crisp, so good! Soul sassy and bbq are my go to, and it hits the spot every time! Their bowls are also really good. Give it a try if you haven't, you will not be disappointed. They deliver as well, and it's great still when it's delivered. But it's much much better when you eat there right when the food is ready. You can say that about most food that's delivered though...just isn't the same"
Sorry. I don't get it. Wings were not great and our fries were overcooked to the point that we could not eat them. Won't be back.
"Another one for the I-don't-get-it files.  I like fried chicken.  I like korean food.  But I do not yet understand korean fried chicken.  Did the nicely-fried whole chicken wings really need to be covered in sticky sweet sauce?  It seems like a step down in texture and maybe even in taste.  But they have a much more diverse menu than I realized, and so I will probably be back."
The Crisp BBQ chicken tenders with Alison's Atomic Sauce changed my life.
"AMAZING!I live right down the street from Crisp and it is definitely a go to spot. The chicken wings, tenders, and sandwiches (Foodie's Choice or Not so Common) are unbelievably good, and for a healthier meal, the Buddha bowls are typically what I get. The Seoul Sassy sauce and BBQ sauces are delicious. We LOVE this place to eat in or take out!"
Note to self: Their whole chicken is not as good as their wings....but their wings are still 5 stars in my book!
Amazing chic tenders with BBQ sauce. Fries tasted just like McDonalds. Will be back for sure!!!
"Really nice spot, people are great, and the food is a nice step up from fast food but without the snootiness or pretension of a lot of the new spots.The sauces are pretty good and really why you go there. Chicken was a leg up on the usual chicken tenders you'd find anywhere but not at an unreal I've never had this before level.My best recommendation if you're eating there and especially with a group is to go at off peak times because the seating is cramped. With the summer coming I think you're better off taking it to a park and going picnic style.Hope to go back soon and again the people there were great."
I don't know why you would want to ruin a sacred thing like fried chicken by putting a bunch of weird Asian inspired sauces on it but that's what this place did. I felt the ancestors of Harold and Shark cry tears over the injustices done to their noble works. They get an extra star for having vanilla Coke and vanilla Coke is like Coke's hot older sister that you got to see in her bikini sometimes during the summer and it was always awesome.
"Delicious, absolutely the best wings I've ever ate in my life! Didn't think it would be this good. Definitely coming here more often!"
"We went to Chicago to visit my sister.  She took us to this place one night.  The place was packed, and we had to wait a good 15min before getting....more like fighting for a table.  A very good sign thus far with such demand for business.I ordered a Beef bowl or basic bulgogi over rice for about $10.  My son had the same, and my daughter had the chicken version, while my wife had the bibimbap, along with 20 chicken wings (what they were known for).  So basically, this is an Asian fusion, Korean bistro that also has good wings.First on the Korean food.  Let's just say it's definitely very basic and simple.  The beef had no other vege (usually has onion and some shreded carrots), but all they have is bare slices of beef.  By the way, they were dried w/o any sauce.  Looks to be pre-made and sitting for awhile.  For such a simple dish, there were little flavor w/o the help of any other sauces that I had to add on.As the father, I usually have to eat the leftover from my kids.  So for my daughter who ordered the chicken over rice version, once again, it didn't have much flavor or should I say unique flavor other than the basic grilled chicken over rice.  For $10 a bowl, it's not really worth it.As for chicken wings, I would say this is what they are good at as the size of the wings are very big and meaty.  Forgot what flavor we had ordered, but it was tasty.Bottom line is that the Asian fusion or Korean food they have really is more like a 2 star.  Only reason for 3 stars was their chicken wings.  So if you love chicken wings, I would highly recommended."
"This place is consistently awesome. Always packed with an interesting mix of customers and real chill vibes. The staff is attentive but laid back and not in your face. The online ordering system is super convenient and always on time for pickup. I'm kinda burnt out on the giant burrito trend, but the Seoul Sensation is certainly an exception. I could eat this nearly every day...and have on multiple occasions. The bulgogi beef is super tender and flavorful, and the corn/green onion combo is the perfect compliment. To top it all off, a side of Allison's Atomic Sauce. Perfectly tangy, with just enough acidity and heat. I need to find out what's in that stuff...Even though that thing is pretty much a meal in a burrito shell, sometimes you've just gotta get your magic mushroom on. These fried little fungi are perfectly light and crunchy with tons of flavor. Easily the best tasting magic mushrooms you'll ever eat."
"Absolutely delicious Korean fried chicken. I really enjoyed the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. Great array of bowl dish features as well as side dish offerings. However, their pressure-cooked, free range chicken is definitely the star. Given their variety of sauces, you could justify coming here often. You know, for research. And reasons. Tasty reasons."
Wings are really good but huge! Came with my dad and definitely ordered way too much food. Kimchi was also great. Chicago has a lot of amazing Korean restaurants but crisps is def worth trying out!
"We came here after hearing raves and reading all the reviews on yelp. We came hungry and left happy and full. I got the steak bowl and shared the Seoul sassy chicken. The bowl was huge! Lots of rice and a very generous amount of meat, which is sweet and succulent! Mix it together with atomic sauce and their special hot sauce, and it's oh so good!The chicken was delicious!! Though it was fried chicken, it wasn't heavy. Probably the best fried chicken I've had up here! You get more than you pay for - really generous prices. It's long table seating so you'll end up eating with strangers, which is nice. We went on a Saturday night, and it was packed. Because it was only two of us, it wasn't hard for us to get seating. I will definitely be back soon to try the Buddha Bowls!"
"First time here and I really wanted to order the baby buddha bowl and chicken wings all for myself, but I knew it'd be too much food so i resisted.  So I just ordered the baby buddha bowl with beef to go.  It was delicious and the perfect size for one person! I used all the sauce that they gave me.  One complaint is that the to go bowl was really filled and too small, and they separated all the ingredients.  It was extremely hard to mix.  Also, they didn't give me any utensils which I didn't like because how do you expect me to eat this! Other than that, I'm sure I would've been happy if I dined in :) Will try the chicken wings next time."
"Best wings in the city bar none.The jumbo wings are described accurately, as they do not separate the wing from the drumstick.  The suicide are my favorite, but if you don't want quite as much heat they have two lower levels of buffalo sauce that both have plenty of flavor.The Seoul sassy wings are also great if you're looking for a change of pace, as they are a bit more on the sweet side.The bbq are nothing special in my opinion, if it's your first time ordering from here I would go with one of the options above before trying these.Plenty of other things on the menu, but other than the occasional side (fries, mushrooms, etc), I can't seem to look past those delicious wings."
"Just spent 8 hrs in a restroom, as well as my girlfriend.  Thank You Crisp!"
"I came to this fast food place on my short stayover in Chicago. It took me some effort on the bus system to get over here from downtown, half hour ride. But Crisp was a decent and worthy try. Crisp is fast, cheap and decent. Unlike most fast food places, there is a good amount of space to sit around and enjoy your wings while they are pipin' hot. There's free water if it gets too spicy for your, and its kinda a community table style, with utensils and sauces to share with your table mates.Food:I tried the barenaked wings, or the original wings. It's good fried chicken. VERY VERY good crispy skin. But I'm not sure I love the spices on it, like, i could do with more kick in my chicken crispy skin?My boyfriend and I also shared the baby buddha bowl. very big for the price. Good job! But bibimbap just isn't that tasty without the charred rice or crispy bits... Fresh veggies, somehow sweet minced beef (??!!!), spicy sauce... It was good. but I'm alright.I think this is an awesome place for someone who studies or works or stays nearby. For a foodies who ventured out of the way to try something new, this was just not up to the bar."
"Best wings in the City of Chicago. I've only ever ordered delivery, and the wings are always hot and delicious when they arrive !"
"I dig this place. The good is that the food is delicious. I got a steak bowl and shared some boneless wings in the sassy sauce. The steak bowl was great - sticky rice, steak, green onion and smothered it in atomic sauce. I ate it for dinner that night and then lunch the next day. I maybe even liked it better for left overs.It's a really oddly laid out little place. The tables are all extremely close together and unless you have a party of 4+ you'll be sharing it with some strangers - yay for making new friends! They are really busy too - probably because the food is so tasty - so there is a steady flow plus constant delivery guys in and out. Will definitely be back for the food but may get takeout. Perfect movie night food."
"OMG. I went on a food adventure to Crisp and it was AMAZING! Sarah and I split the whole chicken dinner and it was way too much food! We got 2 kinds of chicken (Seoul Sassy and Bud's Buffalo), fries, onion rings and two drinks for only $19.95. It was an awesome deal and it was so worth the 1.5 hour trip. What I loved best about the meal was the atomic bomb sauce (looked like spicy chipotle sauce with fresh peppers) and it went with everything! If you are willing to take the trip down, this is my new place to recommend!"
"So worth the extra couple of miles on the treadmill!In this case I'm a bum and have only had the man go and bring back takeout for me, but the food is so damn good I need to write a review.  I'm all about their seoul sassy sauce.  I usually rock the wings and a chicken bowl, because I am that much of a pig, and I want to, and just don't judge, ok!?  I mean, the chicken is juicy, the amount of sauce is perfect, it's just damn good.Oh, and might I add my cat has been known to run off with a piece of chicken or two when I'm not looking.  Seriously, I'll look at my plate and think man, I really put a dent in those wings, only to find a piece or two on the floor because my furball has bigger eyes than his stomach.  Even more importantly, over ordering is not an issue here because everything reheats up quite nicely, which to me is about all I can do in the cooking department, so this place is my new best friend."
Amazing food like too good to be true. The restaurant can be bigger but I won't complain. The food is bomb. Everything there is amazing and they even delivery. Everybody. If you are ever in Chicago. You need to eat at crisp
"A tasty (somewhat guilty) treat. The place is usually pretty packed around the lunch and dinner hours so call ahead. The vegetarian options are just ok, the main star is obviously the chicken. Being a Korean fusion type spot the wings are much larger than what most people think of when they see something such as a buffalo wing since they include the entire wing. Everyone has their preference so the first time I say get a couple of each :) Good sauces too."
"Have dined in and gotten carry out. I have never been more impressed with chicken! I get the boneless strips and my husband gets the wings. The Crisp BBQ is my favorite sauce, second favorite is the Seoul Sauce. We also love the fried mushrooms--some of the best I've had. They are also very generous; almost every time I order a 3 piece strip, they throw in an extra strip. Highly recommend!"
Pretty good chicken!! They come in huge pieces also! Bibimbap also isn't too bad. It's funny cause they call them Buddha bowls and Buddha sauce..it's a pretty small restaurant so it can get crowded in weekends.
"Om nom nom, this place is so so good. The first time I went here, I went back the next day. I highly recommend getting the half chicken with the Seoul Sassy sauce. The fries are also really good, and the portion is rather generous. The steak bowl was good, but I prefer getting the fried chicken."
"Be warned: if you go here, you're going to eat until you want to throw up.  Just accept it and move on.  This is the best fried chicken I've ever had and I lived in Philly for four years.  Casual racism aside, these are full-sized wings - none of that baby buffalo wing bullshit.  10 wings for two people is a little much, in the way that Matthew McConaughey is a little shirtless or cocaine wakes you up a little bit.You know how restaurants never give you as many fries as you want?  This place does, and then some.  Take care with the potatoes.BYOB too, so you can black out and eat a shitload of fried chicken.  Which is basically the American Dream"
I saw this place in a magazine article and had to bring my bf. He loves crispy chicken wings. These were amazing!!! The skin was so crunchy. The seoul sassy wings taste like the skin is candied. The buffalo wings were the perfect heat if you order the spicy...i'm gonna try the suicidal ones some day!We also shared a big boy buddha bowl. It looks amazing but i was sad that it wasn't very warm :/. It's no good as a leftover. Not sure if it had vinegar or it went bad after 2 days.Will definitely be back for more wings and bowls :)
"AHHH How have I been missing out on this deliciously fried poultry???? The only other time I've had Korean wings was at a potluck and it was still very good but DOESN'T COMPARE TO CRISP. BEST Korean Wings ever! they are full wings with the Drummette, Wingette, and Wing tip. 1. Seoul Sassy (FAVORITE): Oh Lordy, flavor party in my mouth! These Seoul Sassy wings are covered with a sweet sauce prepared with ginger, soy, and garlic. It has the best balance of seasoning for the chicken.This is definitely my favorite combination and what I crave allll the time!2. Crisp BBQ: korean/american fusion bbq sauce is spicy, sweet and smoky. This tastes good too but the texture of the sauce was grainy :/ but it was sweeter, more bbq-like than the other sauce which other people can fancy more :]3. Onion Rings: A tad bit over-fried but still delicious!4. French Fries: delicious, shoestring fries that complimented the wings so perfectly!I haven't had wings like these ever. The skin was just so crispy and flavorful but the meat was perfect and tender! The flavor and texture was perfectly balanced in my opinion and absolutely DEVINE! I also had Crisp to-go but it tastes better in-store of course. In either case, can't wait to return soon!"
"After trying korean fried chicken in NYC, I've made it my mission to find something similar in every city I visit.  Chicago had a few places to decide between and after reading tons of reviews, I figured Crisp would be the one!   Every time I go to a new place, I get overwhelmed with all the yummy food.  I wish I could've just had a bite of everything!   We decided to try the seoul sassy and bbq wings and fries.  The pieces of chicken were huge!   The flavors of the chicken were good and I really liked the crunch.   The fries were really good.   It kinda reminded me of fresh McDonald's fries. Overall, I was pleased with everything we ordered."
The wings here are insane. They're super huge and super tasty. On the sweet side. Not diet food. The bowls are great too. Lots of vegetables and you can ask for less rice if you're trying to cut down on carbs.  The sauces offered are as bit on the weeds side as well.Have only been there during lunch numerous times.  Always people trailing in and out but rarely a wait. Service is excellent.
"Freaking love crisp. The world would be a better place if there were more Korean take-out places, and crisp is the best I've been to."
"Prepare to be amazed. I wanted to try this place for a while after hearing how good it was but never made much of an effort because, after all, wings are wings. Right?Wrong. These wings are massive, and I don't mean grown on steroids and hormones. But healthy, meaty wings. Keep in mind 1 wing is considered both the thigh and the breast. But can I talk about the sauce for a second? Holy moly. The sauces are to die for. Between 3 of us we tried the Sassy Seole, honey BBQ and medium buffalo. All 3 had more flavor and punch than any other wing sauce I've tried before. Either way, you can't make a wrong decision here but none of the Honey BBQ wings were left at our table. Don't undermine the spicy. Even the honey BBQ had some spice to it. Just enough crisp, plenty of meat and bountiful flavor. What more can I say?Seating is family style, sharing tables with strangers and it gets pretty packed. Super friendly wait staff.  I'm eager to go back for more!!"
"Am I missing something here? Based on everything I've read on the internet, eating the Seoul Sassy wings was supposed to be the culinary equivalent of staring into God's eyes for the first time and discovering the meaning of life, not just...well, teriyaki chicken wings.I had the aforementioned Seoul Sassy wings. They were huge -- an order of 5 was more than enough for me and I'm not a small guy -- and very tasty. I'm looking forward to eating them again. Best wings in Chicago though? Meh... Service was very quick and friendly, and ordering online is fairly painless as well. Happy to have them in the neighborhood."
"Seoul Sassy straight up please!  Hubby and I have been there from the beginning when we used to live in Lakeview just down the street from this place.  We met the owner and chef when he was doing everything, including ringing up orders.  I can't believe I haven't written a review yet!We've sampled many items from the menu but my hands down favorite is the Seoul Sassy fried chicken.  I love how they added the chicken tenders option for days when I don't feel like picking the bones.  Their Superfly Frites are amazing - crispy thin pomme frites that are the perfect side for the fried chicken.  Awesome drink selection especially since soda goes so well with the menu.  Lots of condiments on the table for dipping.I had to get used to the communal seating, but it does give it a nice homey feel to eat elbow-to-elbow and passing down paper towels with fellow fried chicken lovers.  I highly recommend eating there since some of the crispiness gets lost with ordering it take-out."
"I don't know why I haven't been out to Crisp until now.  SWEET JAYSUS THE WINGS ARE GOOD!!! We ordered 10 wings, 1/2 plain jane and 1/2 crisp BBQ sauce, a side of fries, and a side of white rice.  The place is small and an order at the counter type deal, with a few tables and then counter seating.  My friend and I opted to sit at the counters, and devoured our meal while enjoying the beers we brought (BYOB is a win as well).  The crisp BBQ sauce is like crack - it was SO freakin good.  But the plain jane wings were also delish - minimal breading and super crispy.  All the wings were rather gigantic.  And happiness inducing.  I'm bummed that this spot is not that close by me (I rarely make the trek out to Lakeview unless I happen to have my car in the city with me), but also a little relieved - if Crisp was around the corner from me, they would have all my future monies.  Needless to say, I will be visiting here again soon.  Hands down favorite wings I've had in Chicago."
"we decided to get some to go and so we did not realize how big the chicken wings are.  we ordered 40 wings for dinner which was way too many for us three.  we ended up eating it every day for breakfast the next four days - that's how much we had leftover.  it was so delicious!  i am not sure which one we ordered (friend ordered it), but the flavor was intense and the texture was so crispy!  it was still good for breakfast the next few days after putting it in the toaster oven."
"The food doesn't get any better, be it the wings, sandwiches, bows, fries, kimchi, etc...it is second to none. However the staff could be a little more enthusiastic when it comes to serving their customers. It's one thing if it's the restaurant's MO to be a hardass but I don't get that vibe from crisp. It comes off like it's a chore for them to do be doing their jobs. They also don't come of as being willing to answer questions or concerns. One minor note is that the sauces provided on the tables (when eating in-house) leave much to be desired as they don't come close to the wing sauces."
"Coming from someone who has no idea what traditional Korean food or flavors tastes like: 5 stars. This same person, however, is a grand lover of wings and this place is wing paradise. I've only been to Crisp once, but the Seoul Sassy wings haunt my dreams. I ordered I believe ten of them and managed to get down about 4. I completely did not expect how large these wings were going to be (this coming from someone who eats 20-30 on 25 cent wing night at Finley Dunnes or Redmond's). These wings are perfectly crispy, the chicken meat is tender, and the sauce is so delicious. My roommate ordered the BBQ version and those were great also, I just liked the slightly less sweet and more complex Seoul Sassy myself. I can't speak to the bibimbop, but I can say that the people who work here are very nice and the atmosphere is laid back and fun. It's clear that this is a place where people just wander in with friends for good food without any of the need for social graces that come with going to places with waiters. That means, that while there are big picnic style tables to sit down at inside the restaurant, everyone (takeout and eating in) orders the same way: go up to the register, put in your order, wait for your name to be called.If you and your friends are bored and hungry, I would highly recommend this spot--the deliciousness and uniqueness of the food will be enough to turn a boring afternoon into a nice evening out."
"Seriously one of the best places!! ""Not So Common"" sandwich is my favorite... with the sassy sauce! I come here usually once or twice a month. Chill and friendly staff too."
"The Korean burrito and chicken wings are absolutely awesome!  Yes,  it's a bit pricey but so very worth it.  Customer service is great if you are eating in or taking out. The one drawback (for some) may be the community type seating. Personally I think it's cute and comfy, space is limited so it's best to come during less busy times."
"Deeeeelicioooous! But then again, who doesn't like fried chicken? This was my first Korean fried chicken joint, and now I'm addicted. It's a good thing I don't live closer to this place. A group of 4 of us went, and we scarfed down an entire chicken coup worth of poultry. We shared 3 whole chickens flavored with all of their sauces: Crisp BBQ, Seoul Sassy and Bud's Buffalo. I'd say the Bud's Buffalo was the best, had a great kick to it. Oh and don't forget to try their condiments too. We also shared the deep fried mushrooms... it was pretty much a night of fried goodness, and we were full until the next morning. Seating is the only tough part, it's a small joint. But worth it!"
"The chicken wings are to die for! I especially like the Seoul Sassy and BBQ. Both are a wonderful combination of tender, juicy wing and flavor, with a hint of sweetness. The BBQ wings have just the right amount of zing. The Kimchee (both cabbage and radish varieties) is also delish!"
"Brought my siblings here, there were seven of us so we made sure to try a variety of dishes.  Total came out to under $10 a person which is always awesome but to leave on a full stomach satisfied, is a greater ]feat in itself.We come from a Korean background so we are familiar with these foods.  It is definitely 'fusion' which I like even better but the bibimbop is pretty traditional and tasty.  Got the whole chicken with half smothered in the Crisp BBQ and the other half in Seoul Sassy and they were both great but I might lean towards the BBQ slightly.   The atmosphere is something of a hip hole in the wall joint where there seating is like bar styled picnic tables.  Maybe four or so tables with a pair of long wooden benches and a few counter seats.  You order, they call your name to come pick it up, and you clean up after yourself.  Easy come easy go.A must try for fried chicken lovers and those who want a Korean food fix in the area."
"Dropped in here after a local recommended that we try their chicken. I ordered a half chicken with Korean BBQ sauce. My wife ordered the korean burrito. My chicken was pretty tasty! The breading was thick and crispy. The chicken meat inside was hot and moist. I regretted getting the korean bbq sauce. It was the thick brown sugar/molasses style with a hint of korean spice. I'm not a huge fan of that style bbq sauce in general and I didn't feel the korean spice significantly elevated the flavor. It's often a challenge ordering at these fusion places, you never quite know which ingredients and flavors will be retained in the dish. I enjoyed my meal though. I also felt it was a good valueMy wife wasn't thrilled with her burrito. The tortilla was cold and overall it tasted bland. I'd come back here to try the chicken with the Seoul Sassy sauce but I'd be hesitant to explore the full range of menu items."
"Cannot get over their fried chicken! My husband and I devoured it. The rice bowl-the baby buddha was good too. For everyone who comes here surely try their fried chicken with different sauces, especially the seoul sassy - finger licking good!"
"I have wanted to go here for so long, so I am very happy to say that I ate at Crisp earlier this week!The boyfriend and I ordered the whole chicken combo. 1/2 Seoul Sassy and 1/2 Crisp BBQ with fries and onion rings. When it came out, dear god. There was so much food!The chicken was delicious. I think I'm partial to the Crisp BBQ while the boyfriend is partial to the Seoul Sassy. SCORE. I like the atomic sauce. The Buddha sauce aka gochujang is a bit gritty. It wasn't difficult to eat or very messy at all. They have plenty of paper towel rolls lying around. I'm not giving it a 5 because they need to work on their decor and bathroom. I felt like I was in a shady Asian restaurant when I walked into the bathroom. Plus, they had a documentary about making plastic eyeballs playing on the television. ..wow, that makes me super hungry."
"FOOD IS SO GOOD IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD I almost wish I lived here, except then I would never cook again.We came for the fried chicken, obviously. Juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. Can't decide which was better, the Seoul Sassy or the Crisp BBQ sauces, good thing we got plenty of both and switched off between the 2! They were really flavorful so it was almost okay that the fries weren't seasoned.. like a really unhealthy palate cleanser. Would love to try the rest of the menu at some point but to come here and not have the wings almost seems wrong.Be warned that these are SUPER JUMBO wings. An order of 10 wings and large fries was more than enough for the 2 of us. Probably more appropriate for 3 moderate appetites. Also it's BYOB. What more could you ask for?Communal/bar seating, and quite limited. We came pretty late, after 8pm on a Thursday, so we had no problem grabbing seats but I can see that being an issue during busier hours."
"Crisp doesn't taste like Korean Fried Chicken (maybe better off known as Bonchon or Kyochon to the chain conglomerate masses) in the strictest sense. I'm not even sure the chicken at Crisp goes through the signature ""double fry"" that defines Korean Fried Chicken.But that's OK. Because Crisp is still dang delicious.If anything, Crisp tastes more like American KFC, only dunked in some awesome ""Seoul Sassy"" sweet soy-based sauce that goes oh so well with your favorite bi bim bap meat. Which is to say, it tastes awesome.The wings are huge, so don't go ordering 10 thinking you're getting yourself a wimpy platter of Buffalo Wild Wings limp-flighted pieces. A ""piece"" literally means the wing and the drum, so plan accordingly.The bi bim bap bowls (known as ""Buddha Bowls"" at Crisp) are surprisingly underrated, and a two-person meal consisting of both a bowl and some wings provides a nice varietal mix. It makes sense to get the Buddha Bowl (consisting of a vegetable medley) and add on the meat rather than just going for the meat bowl outright. You've got plenty of white with the wings, why not add some vegetarian color to your life? Also, fried egg on the Buddha Bowl equals YES.As for the drink of choice? Tahitian Treat. A nice cherry on top."
Seriously.... bombdotcom chicken wings!  Ordered Seoul Sassy and Crispy BBQ with Peoples Korean Veggies and some Kimchi.  Generous portions and these wings are seriously what you can write home to Seoul about its that good!  They definitely don't skimp on baby tiny wings... these are full sized wings!  Delicious!
"I almost feel foolish writing a review for this place,  with over 1000 great reviews should be enough to persuade you to come here.Great portions. Great food. I would come back again and again."
Yummy! The wings and the friend chicken are gluten free (but not the chicken tenders). Plus they deliver!
"LOVE this place!  Probably the best fried chicken I've had in Chicago.Ok, so listen up.  This is what you need to do: order 5 chicken wings (3 crisp bbq and 2 seoul sassy) and eat the third crisp bbq piece last.  You have to try both flavors because they're DELICIOUS, and end on the bbq because it's just slightly better than the seoul sassy and you want that to be the last thing you taste.  Do not drink water afterward.  You don't want to wash the happiness away!And you don't need more than 5.  These aren't your dad's chicken wings..Oh and if you're unobservant like me and can't find the napkins (I preeeetty much have surgical dexterity when there are chicken wings involved and I still got messy b/c of their size), fear not, they have paper towel rolls at the tables."
"Ordered a small order of wings and the baby Buddha bowl. Way too much food for 1 person! The wings were the whole three piece wing friend and sauced. They were very meaty and very good. The Buddha bowl was just rice, veggies, and an egg. Didn't come with any sauce but there were a few home made sauces on the table. None really suited my fancy, but to each his own."
Meh. This is a BBQ chicken wing smothered in some Bulgogi sauce. Next hype please.
They got our order right this time and it was balls-to-the-wall delicious.  Seoul Sassy is as good as advertised.  BBQ also good and was actually preferred by my lady.  Also the cashier was very friendly.
"My husband loves the wings here!  We are from the suburbs so we try and swing by here any chance we get. Like all the other reviews, we've gotten the Seoul sassy and really liked it but what I really liked were the suicide wings. I only ordered 3 and that was plenty. They rub the wings in that rooster chili garlic sauce which causes a flavorful fire in your mouth! Order it once just to try if it's still on the menu"
"So I remember coming here like two years ago and hating it.  I could never remember why.  So we decided to give it another go, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out what I hated.  As everyone has said, the Seoul Sassy wings are fantastic, and if you don't order a basket while you're here, what's the point in coming to Crisp?  I also, personally, am a huge fan of the Spicy Buffalo.  The wings are massive -- we usually grab an order of 10 and a side to share, and it's plenty of food.  So now I remember what I hated.  I came for lunch the other day, and because I was looking for quick and less messy, I opted for boneless tenders.  Save yourself the trouble and just don't.  Too much breading, too much bleh.  They are honestly the only thing holding me back from wanting to 5-Star this place.  My only real complaint is this place desperately needs a bigger space.  It get's packed anytime it's food time, and with only three big tables and a few window seats it gets absolutely ridiculous fast."
"With more than 1200 reviews already, this place needs mine like I need a hole in the head, so I'll make this quick and dirty. It's crowded, it's hot, and they have the best chicken in the entire city. Take it to go, avoid even trying to find a place to sit. You won't. And there's no outdoor seating either.  It's literally elbow to elbow, and you have to squeeze through a mass of people just to get to the ordering counter. The Seoul Sassy is where it's at. Sweet ginger, garlic and spices made this incredible. The BBQ was good too, but kind of eh in comparison. I WILL drive all the way back into the city from the western suburbs just to have this chicken again."
"(4.5 Stars)You know those wings you'd get at your favorite campus bar for 10 cents a piece on wing night or even the slightly larger wings you'd get at your favorite wing place for oh say, 30 cents a piece? Well, those aren't the wings you're getting at Crisp. Far from it.These are some hearty wings. At Crisp, a wing = the wing and the drummette so don't be surprised when those bad boys come out and you see more than what you expected. Aside from the size, these wings are noteworthy because well, they're just so damn good. The standout at Crisp is the Seoul Sassy. Sweet and aromatic, these wings will make you happy. The Crisp BBQ wings are also very good. Try the bowls here too. We had the baby Buddha bowl with beef on our last visit. It was fresh and flavorful and the portion size was also pretty good. If you love chicken like me, you better make your way over to Crisp!"
"I am smitten with Crisp. My husband and I walked in here because we decided we were hungry and it was the next place we came across on Broadway. We were so pleasantly surprised by the food and our experience that we were planning our next visit before we finished eating!The Chi-Town Chicken Bowl was great, especially with the atomic sauce they snuck in our to-go bag. Wow is that stuff good. This dish was simple, but packed a lot of amazing flavor.The Big-Boy Buddha is what we've been craving since this visit, though. Loaded with a unique blend of eight veggies, that wonderful chicken, and perfectly sticky rice was culinary perfection but when we broke all the rules and added some of the atomic sauce? Game over.I am super excited that this place is in our neighborhood, and it is a stand-out in an area that is packed with great places to choose from. I can't wait to try the other menu items that others seem to love so much, we will be back!"
"Korean chicken wings are the best! Sorry American south.AND. this is probably the best korean fried chicken. Haven't tried Dak, but I can't imagine it being better than this!Finally had a chance to come and try their wings. We had five destinations to visit in one ""meal,"" and this was definitely our favorite of our selection of Chicago's best casual Asian/Asian-inspired foods. Seoul sassy. Incredibly flavorful and balanced - sweet, savory, fragrant. HUGE juicy wings for a great price. I love that they include the tip of the wing, which is obviously the best part! This alone deserves five stars.The Crisp BBQ... tasted too much like just gochujang, and it could have been spicier and a bit bolder. We enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special. Same juicy, hot & fresh wings though.I wouldn't come this far for their buddah bowls or burritos since they're not that different from bibimbop everywhere, and neither is the budda sauce on the table, but for those in the area they are a great deal for the portion. I'd try one, but only as an addition to a gigantic order of seoul sassy wings. Dammit I'm drooling just writing this review."
"I have had both the wings and the buddha bowl here.  The wings are delicious, but be warned, they are enormous and quite messy.  Not first date food.  The Seoul Sassy and Buffalo sauces are good.  I *really* wish they would create a 3 wing option.  I ordered the 5 wings when I was here by myself and it was really too much.  I felt bad throwing out what I could not finish.  The buddha bowls are also quite good.  The mushrooms are super good too.  Pro tip: get a growler from Dryhop and eat here for dinner.  I also really wish they that they would stay open later, it's hard to get in by 9 p.m."
"As good as Korean fried chicken gets. I am a longtime consumer of Korean Friend Chicken. I frequent three establishments:Crisp in ChicagoUnidentified Flying Chickens (UFC) in Jackson Heights (Queens) NYBaden-Baden in Koreatown - 32nd Street in ManhattanI think that Crisp has the other two beat. I met a colleague for lunch here at her suggestion and I had trouble controlling myself. The sweetness in whatever they do to it is detectable but just vaguely out of reach - it is a note that is realized for a moment, and then its gone in a swallow of savory, perfect chicken. I ate bite after bite, chasing that note. UFC in Queens has some of that pleasure, but not to the same degree. The informality of the place is a plus. Nice to have food that hovers just above the take-out price point where you can also sit and eat with reasonable dignity."
"Best Korean Chicken Wings... BAR NONE!  The places all across the country who get accolades for their chicken wings should send their chef here to try the best. I used to live close to Crisp but it wasn't until I moved to NYC and tried the ""best"" here that I realized how good Crisp is. You must go here if you are in Chicago!"
"There's a reason why this place is so famous. I am a vegetarian, but have taken small bites of their chicken - and damn, it's awesome! Their buddah bowl is the perfect dish for any veggie or meat lover, it's full of flavor, protein, and just yummy yummy goodness. Be sure to grab a seat if there is one when you walk in, I love the communal dining style but it gets packed easily!"
"A bit pricey, but this korean BBQ joint puts out addictive yet good BBQ!The only drawbacks is the communal sitting area (not a fan) and its sometimes pricey, lack of parking because of the area and there's only one location.With all that going on the food it still that good to give it 4 stars!"
The food is great. I always order the boneless wings. Outside of fried goodness the bowls look good as well the ingredients look really fresh. But the fried goodness is really good lol! Tip: do carry out or be prepared to sit really close to a stranger
"The Seoul Sassy sauce is delicious :) The wings are gigantic! The first time I came, they tasted a bit dry (overcooked), but the second time they were much better. The breading on the mushrooms, however, is a bit heavy for me, but I really love their french fries - they were really well-cooked! Finding seating here if you're eating in is incredibly frustrating. If I lived close enough, I would definitely go with takeout or delivery rather than waiting around in a tense cluster for diners to finish up and leave. If there's one thing I could change about this place - more seating room!!"
"Oh man, this place is delicious. I had friends come to town and took them here-- what a great choice on my part.  The chicken itself warrants at least 4 stars.  We ordered a 10 piece meal,  half with buffalo sauce and the other with the Crisp sauce.  The house sauce is magical-- I recommend this one for sure! The wings themselves are humongous, crispy and flavorful, and after two pieces I was almost already full. The rest of us ordered the Big Boy Bi Bim Bop and the Korean Burrito-- skip these, there is better bi bim bop and the korean burrito was nothing special at all. The restaurant is small, so if you have a big group or want to eat during a busy time I recommend take out."
"This place is awesome. The Seoul Sassy and the Bbq are pretty top notch and the price is right. I usually take the extra money I save when I go here and hit up the Walmart down the way to the find the perfect kind of huffing glue that really helps settle my stomach after a fowl filled snack.  After taking a few snuffs in the hardware department, I will then sometimes meander my way back into the alleyway nearby to gorge on the remaining chicken and drink the moisture from the roots of nearby trees. All in all, Crisp is a total treat!"
"Crisp definitely has some of the best fried chicken wings I've ever had. This place makes me regret all those times I had to go to buffalo wild wings to get my wing fix satiated. Sad days. But when you simply don't have access to fabulous fried chicken, sometimes you just have to settle.I came here with a party of 5 and we split an order of 10 wings and each had a bad boy buddha with the exception of an order of a korean taco. We all decided that after the meal we should've gotten ourselves just the chicken. Even though the bi bim baps were quite good, the fried chicken was just so unique and flavorful that we wished we had more.I was able to try one of the crisp bbq and the buds buffalo. First off these wings were fried perfectly and are infused with sauces. The buds buffalo was pretty good but the crisp bbq was fantastic. I've been bored by the bbq flavors at other traditional bbq restaurants but this wing had a tangy asian bbq flavor that had me ripping my wing apart for every morsel of meat I could get at. It got pretty messy but luckily at each table there is a roll of paper towels to use at your heart's desires.Friendly service here and it's a good thing they have a jug of hand sanitizer. Only suggestion is that they stock up on some moist towelettes!"
First off they sell vanilla coke which is just great. I always get the chicken tenders and I'm never disappointed. Seoul sassy is the best sweet sauce. Staff is young and very friendly. When it's crowded there's not much space to wait for your food And it gets crowded often.
It's addicting! I'm all about the wings but the Buddha bowls are not all that they should be. I would stick to the wings and go mainly with the Seoul sassy. Seating can be hard to find at times. I usually take it to go and eat it at home or in the park nearby.
Baby buddha bowl was to die for.Would have taken a picture but started gorging my face hole as fast as possible once I took the first bite.Definitely will be coming back to this place!
"Here on business, I came to Crisp after browsing around places to try in Chicago. Korean, chicken wings, adventure all in one night? Sure why not! I took a cab from downtown Chicago, and arrived at Crisp in roughly 15-20 minutes with traffic. The fare was rather cheap, wrapping at around $15. Entering Crisp, you are in a pretty vibrant environment with bright colored walls, 3 park bench seatings, and also tray & wall seatings facing outdoors.Come in, look at the menu, look at their bowls, and look at all that yummy chicken you can order! What brought me to Crisp was the chicken wings, so that was on my #1 list on what to get. I opted to get 10 wings, 5 Seoul Sassy, and 5 Crisp BBQ. Asking the waiter what type of sides were good, I also decided to get some crispy fries with the whole meal.I waited by the window seating drinking my water. When they called my name, I came to get my order to realize I may have over did it. Why you ask? Well as a west coaster, when I think chicken wings, I think buffalo wild wings or wing stop. You know what's in common with these two spots? SMALL ASS CHICKEN WINGS. BOOM -- the Menu reads ""Whole Jumbo Wings"" -- *hits forehead* .. 10 of those bad boys were a challenge for 1 person! Two people may be doable, but I still think 3 would be on the safe side, however I went ahead and attacked those wings because they looked so delectible.First off, the wings were frieds & cooked to perfection. Such ""CRISP"" skin, and tasty. That's what I love about chicken wings first! Then the meat, which wasn't skimp and a lot for the money! For the flavors, the Seoul Sassy wings were sweet with some Korean spices and soy. It was marinated so throughly that the meat inside had some of the flavors found with the outside skin & sauce. These wings were rather glazed and not hardcore saucy like the ones I found on the Crisp BBQ. Those wings were like you were eating BBQ ribs. Saucy, and thick. It was spicy & sweet, and gave a little kick. Not overly done, just about right! Man so DELICIOUS!The fries were also good if you are into crispy fries. On the table they had these two sauces, one called something-something Atomic, and the other was called Buddah sauce. I fell in love with the Buddah sauce & rather use ketchup just layered my fries with it. Off the tip of my tongue, I knew what the sauce was, but even while I am writing this review, it still alludes me, but man was it g-o-o-d!Other things that Crisp offers are these bowls that looked like they were worth trying as well and also sandwiches. Being the ease dropper I am, the chicken bowl looked tasty. They also offer burritos which are what are in the bowls, but wrapped up, so if you want variety, there you have it.I left full, only finishing 4 wings, and half the fries. The smell of the wings in my hotel room right now makes my mouth water. Is it worth all the hype? As a out of towner, I think so if you are into Asian flavors and chicken wings is your thing!4.5/5 Stars! I'll be back next time I'm in Chicago."
"I am a small town gal and Crisp is the first restaurant I have ever been to with over 1200 yelp reviews. An aggregate rating of 4 stars after that many reviews was really impressive, which was why we decided to stop by after yelping for a place to eat in the neighborhood. Crisp is also the first Korean restaurant I have been to that eliminates most Korean sounding names from the menu. Bibimbap? It's called Buddha Bowl here; Bulgogi? It's in the Seoul Steak Bowl; Ban Chan? The People's Choice Greens! Ok, I wasn't bothered by the menu as much as the hubby who has spent a couple years in Korea, but the lack of Korean sighting in the restaurant did send chills down my spine.So a Baby Buddha Bowl (sub brown rice for $1.50 extra) for me, a Seoul Steak Bowl for him, plus five whole wings to share. My ""bibimbap"" was plain, there was no sauce in or on the side of my bowl. The sunny-side up egg was lukewarm--poor thing must have been sitting there while the wings were being cooked. His ""bulgogi"" was sliced into very small thin pieces, very frustrating for someone who prefers bigger pieces of meat (which Bulgogi tends to be). He likened the taste to a teriyaki bowl. Now the wings: they were whole wings (albeit on the bony side), which was not new to me since I had quite a few of them in the south. I am not a wing person, but would order them once in a while in a continuing quest for great wings that might transform me into a wing person and I am afraid these still didn't do it. I tasted very little besides the Korean red chili paste (Gochujang) and sugar in the Crisp BBQ sauce and the Seoul Sassy wasn't very memorable either. Yes, the skin was fried crispy but I would rather have my wings smoked or grilled, and seasoned well with some good spice rubs (like Jerk seasoning).   Don't come here expecting authentic Korean food and you probably will enjoy your meal more than we did."
"crack wings.The korean style wings are briliant. The wing sampler I had was brilliant. Crowded as shit, but worth it. All this said I would never ever come here with more than 2 people unless it was a very off time. Way too little and crowded. I look forward to trying some other stuff, I feel like to give 5 stars I need to make sure stuff on the menu besides wings kicks butt.yums."
"I was really expecting something fantastic and mind blowing. We attempted to come here on a Thursday night and the line was out the door, I was convinced it must be good! Then we were able to make it in and sit at the counter. Your order at the counter and pay the cashier and wait for the goods. People had wine and a variety of beers, anywhere BYOB starts with at least one star. We ordered chicken wings, which were just ok and expensive (5 for $9). I've had a lot of amazing chicken wings in the south so I'm kind of a snob. They were better than $0.50 wings at Buffalo Wild Wings but not that much better to justify that price. I think Pecking Order has better wings, if you don't mind traveling a little farther north for them they are so worth it. The chicken bowl was interesting and way too much, you could easily split this. In my opinion there was just too much rice and sauce and not enough chicken. This place isn't cheap, for the two of us I spent $32. The bottom line is, other places do chicken better. I know a lot of people in this neighborhood swear by Crisp and that's fine, I understand some neighborhood pride."
"DELICIOUS. If you've been to BonChon in NYC then you'll like this place. I've heard about this place from some friends and decided to give it a try. Tried Seoul Sassy and BBQ and the wings were massive! Basically, each wing was a wing and a drumette. I really enjoyed the BBQ one but if you're not into spicy, definitely give Seoul Sassy a try. I didn't know about this but you definitely can bring alcoholic beverages in to eat alongside with your meal. I don't know if it's allowed but everyone was doing it! Definitely coming back if I'm in town again!"
"This review is based solely off of their plain jane fried chicken...which is alright considering Korean Fried Chicken is Crisp's namesake!! So the skin was crisp...haha...really though, the chicken was moist and cooked to perfection, and the whole shebang was packed with flavor, a flavor I can't quite pinpoint...equally mysterious and delicious. I took my  1/2 chicken to go and they had it prepared in a timely manner, though I wouldn't have minded waiting longer - given that the speakers were cranking out Justin Timberlake while I waited :D I definitely hope to be back to check out some of their bowls."
"W.O.W.!!!- Wings Of Wonder! That's how I feel about the Korean style wings. Me and my lovely ex-wife ( yeah, right) ordered two orders of wings- Seoul sassy and BBQ- and my they were delicious, topped with some of the atomic sauce is to die for (I'll give ya a hint, it's actually bleu cheese and sriracha. Oh, the wonders a $20 bill can you get in this world :))"
"Man oh man, this place is utterly fantastic.  Great place for Korean fried chicken.  It's a ways away out of downtown, but it's well worth the trip.  Great korean food, and all their portions are absolutely ginormous.  Each dish is pretty much sized for two people, so go ahead and find a partner to work through this feast.  When I went, my friend and I got one of their bibimbap bowls, fries, kim-chi, and 5 chicken wings.  Everything was fantastic.  A few notes:1)  The kim-chi comes it a little tub, not just a small dish, so there's a lot of it.  2)  Wings are absolute gold here.  They've got the drumettes still attached, so each wing is essentially two ""wings"" from a normal wing-place. 3)  No wait!  A pleasant surprise after waiting an hour+ for most of the restaurants I tried in Chicago.If i'm ever in chicago, I'll definitely be back."
"Not a fan. Maybe it was all the hype. Maybe I was comparing it too closely with DAK off Granville, but I was just ok with it. I had the 5piece BBQ wings and there just want a kick. Great service, tons of food, but just not enough flavor. I couldn't stop using the table sauces, without it, may have been too dry. Definitely won't be racing to return."
"I usually have high expectations when it comes to Korean restaurants.  But, Crisp actually surprised me.  I came here to meet some good friends, and was excited as I heard so many positive things about their chicken.  I ordered the 5-piece Seoul Sassy-flavored wings (the sweet sauce has ginger, soy sauce, garlic, and other 'spices'), well-done, with a can of coke.  It came out piping hot, crispy, and the sauce was actually flavorful.  I liked how the wings were huge, and even though it was close to $9 for 5 pieces, you'd have to consider that even at Popeye's, a 3-piece wing meal is about $5.  I really enjoyed the sauce, and the cold can of Coke made it refreshing.  They also have tap water in the front, if you're interested, as well as other varieties on the menu, like the Buddha bowl (bibimbops).  The dining area is a limited seating of communal dining (long wooden farmer benches from World Market), so sharing a table with strangers is a high possibility.  There is some limited counter space as well, and there are roll of paper towels and gochujang for the bibimbops in the mustard bottles.  The female cashier was kind of rude and had a little attitude problem (not sure what her deal was), and limited parking can be found in the residential area, but all in all, the chicken was enjoyable!+Seoul Sassy-flavored wings (!!!)+communal/counter seating+limited parking available"
"Crisp, BYOB place with double fried Korean chicken wings.Service: 3 stars, fight your way to the front, place your order, careful don't turn around too fast or you'll knock over the person behind you holding a tray of wings that they waited 15 minutes for!Atmosphere/decor: 3.5 stars, lots of TVs to watch sports, and communal seating in the front. I'm always weary of places like these because I don't know how often the table is wiped down. Coat hangers in front of the door!Food: 4 stars, not spicy enough. Was hoping for something more spicy, but alas, that was not to be. We ordered a half chicken, and the white-meat was less appetizing than the dark meat. Maybe it's just me.Conclusion: Next time I come here, I'll definitely remember to bring my own beer!"
"I know Crisp gets great reviews and my sister who lives nearby raves about it, but I was not impressed. For takeout, her and I split six Buffalo chicken tenders ($10.95), six Seoul Sassy chicken tenders ($10.95), and some fried mushrooms ($5.95). Considering the price and the amount of food we actually got, this felt like a rip-off to me. The buffalo chicken was average, and while the Seoul Sassy had good flavor, the tenders were dry and could have used more of the sauce. Save your money on the fried mushrooms, they were nothing special and definitely not worth the money. Perhaps I ordered the wrong things at Crisp and missed what makes this place great, but it would take a lot for me to go back and try this restaurant again."
Went here since I kept hearing about their korean style chicken.I got the bibimbap and it was better than I expected. They did choose some more american vegetables than the classic korean ones (such as corn) but it was filling and tasty.The space is a little small so try to avoid large parties unless you call ahead or go when it's slow.
"I have heard nothing but wonderful things about crisp and my first experience was on par with the reviews. Fun/quick atmosphere and good food! The staff is friendly and helpful. The seating is community style so it's hard to get a seat but good for making new friends and who does not love byob! I got the 8 vegetable Buddha bowl and really enjoyed it! The vegetables are fresh, the brown rice is good and the egg on top was cooked perfectly. I tried a friends tofu which was really good as well! I will be returning and on a cheat day, trying the wings!"
"Was excited to try this place based on the yelp reviews I read, so a friend and I took a bus and headed over from downtown Chicago. Was a bit turned off by it when I saw the price. 10 wings for $15 ish dollars?!  ""But how could 5 wings be enough?? I'm starving!"" Figured I could grab something else after if we were still hungry. Ordered the 5 wings (3 soy glaze and 2 spicy bbq) and a bulgogi burrito. Food came out and the wings were Huge!! Definitely enough to fill both our tummies and satisfy us. Everything tasted amazing. Not much of a foodie but did feel like a place I would return to. Actually considered it before the trip ended but didn't get the chance to. Totally regretting it now. Don't miss out on this!Forgot to mention. They also gave us an extra wing! So 6 wings total!! I must've looked hungry =P"
I can't believe the size of the chicken wings! 3 humongous joints per.  I liked the BBQ. Sweet with a little heat.  These are gluten free wings as long as you only have the plain or Buffalo sauce.  I also like the sesame dressing.  The fries are perfectly crisp. The large onion rings are a lot of rings.  Comes with ranch dressing.  These are good but batter heavy not seasoned.  Still very good.
"We had the bbq & Seoul Sassy, along with the breaded mushrooms. The chicken deal included drinks, but they weren't included in our order.EDIT April '14 - 4.5 stars for nowWings ($8.95 for 5 wings, $15.95 for 10) - 4.5 stars. Picked their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. A bit too much black pepper for me, but still finger-lickin' good fried chicken.Foodie's choice crisp burger ($8.95, double patty for $11.95) - 4.5 stars. Bacon & blue cheese. The chicken was juicy, and you can pick between their signature sauces. It was made fresh, served piping-hot & crispy. The bacon didn't hold its own against the flavorful chicken, so next time, I think I'll go with the non-bacon, American cheese version ($6.95).Service was friendly, the place was packed on a Tuesday evening. We were able to find seating on their picnic-style benches. Food came out promptly. Definitely will return!"
Just like Korea im so many ways. Taste to how they serve the water. Not to mention the delicious ice cream bars and red bean fish. It was great.
"The crisp chicken combo is the way to go. It comes with a whole chicken, two sides and two sodas. I come here with my girlfriend, and we always have leftovers which we love. Also, it is BYOB, another bonus which makes for a fun and casual ambiance."
AMAZING FOOD. That's just the start to Crisp. There delivery is quick 40 - 50 minutes during peak times which is not bad for Chicago standards. All the staff is present and make suggestions based on what you are in the mood for.  A MUST EAT restaurant.
"I'm a fan...a fan!!!  Ok, so I love chicken (I'm having a love affair with Parson's right now).  This place is pretty impressive if you're looking for good...I mean GREAT wings.  If you love spicy wings, this is the place to go.  Skip the rest of the menu and get the wings...can you tell that I'm a chicken fan.  The Bibimbap was good, but I would of prefered to have saved my calories for the chicken.  That being said, stop reading and go!"
I tried the Seoul Sassy chicken strips last night and they were amazing! The flavor was sweet and not spicy the chicken strips had a really good crispiness to them. I added fries and a drink for just $2.50. The fries were tasty but on the greasier side but there were tons of them. My side of fries was enough for myself and the 2 others who were with me and there were some leftover. Overall it was a good deal for really good food!
"I ordered Not So Common Crisp sandwich with Spicy buffalo sauce and a side of fries.  The chicken was delicious and the sauce had just the right amount of heat for my liking. So far so good.  Disappointing was the un-toasted (and in fact quite chilly) bun and the American cheese.  Even atop a freshly fried chicken breast the cheese refused to melt.  The fries were simply fries, neither good nor bad.  They failed to live up to their name on the menu, Superfly Frites.  A little Buddah sauce on them though and they were tasty.Next time I'll try something without a bun.  And I'll go with a rice side."
"I have to say that I wasn't expecting much when I went into this place to be honest but we had a coupon and we thought hey why not let's try this place and we would keep it movin'...Well,all I can say is thank you for the coupon because this place has some tasty chicken!The seating was odd but it was also cool at the same time it like a long table and if you decide to eat there be prepared to sit with a family you don't know...lol, we did and I have to say it was fun, we all talked and laughed and if you were a person walking by you would have thought we were lifelong friends...Now, don't get me wrong I'm sure there are customers who go and eat and don't want to do anything but that, for me and my fellow foodie buddy we found a family of 6 to sit next too and that made our experience even better.I have to say again I did my signature happy dance and the customer service was excellent!  Since we had never been there they took the time to explain how the menu worked, not that it is rocket science but they do have different sauces, and you can make it a bowl, sandwich or a burritos...I mean it is a great concept!!I can't wait to go back and experience this restaurant and the food again!!!"
"My dining partner really loved the BBQ item he got.  But my veggie wrap was actually terrible, so I would not recommend it.  The veggies were fresh and the dish was presented nicely but the taste just wasn't there.  Next time I will try one of their bowls vegetarian style because I know my dining partner will want to go to Crisp again."
"I intoduced my wife to this place and now she's hooked to those unbelievable oversized glorious wings! My wife is preggers, so of course she craves those awesome wings. Last time we ordered 20 wings for both of us, we didn't demolish it...but my wife had high hopes. We obviously took it home. Obviously. I work at Illinois Masonic, and if I get called in and if my wife is with me we hit this up!The guys/girls here are great, we went this past Thursday and ordered the 20 wings. I go pick up the order from the front, and the guy says ""you got no help""...told him no, my wife is pregnant. I had 2 trays of food. I didn't even know he was behind me carrying my other tray...he said congrats to her. Its the little things that make this place awesome. Sure its hot, and cramped, and it can get down and dirty but why the heck not enjoy these wings!! Suggestion: eat with ur hands to get maximum stares, make sure you get down and dirty with this! Hands down best place, we live 1 hr away and we still will come thru!!Your biggest supporter!"
"I've honestly only had the wings from here but only because they are that good that it's all I want when I go there. They are HUGE, 10 wings and fries are the perfect amount for my boyfriend and I. Their classic Bbq sauce is so good and the right amount of spicy. The other asian food they have their always looks good, but like I said I've always gotten the wings. Its a small place so during peak hours on friday and saturday, you might as well order to go because the place gets packed and there's nowhere to sit."
Delicious food! Try the wings or Foodie's Choice or Bad Boy Buddha Bowl. Great for a quick take out meal.
"After walking past this place every day for almost two years, I finally tried it!A friend who was visiting and I decided to give it a try on a Friday night.  It was really crowded, but we didn't wait too long for our food.  The guy at the counter even gave us a suggestion to make our order a bit cheaper.The chicken was DELICIOUS and now every time I walk past, I can smell the wings.  Can't wait to get back."
This place is dope. Period. Does the chicken so so right. Bowls are ridiculous too. Sauces will make your mouth poo itself it's so shocked by the taste. Communal seating sucks across the board-nobody wants to get to know strangers in a restaurant-but worth enduring for these fine-ass pieces. B-dubs on crack. Go here.
"Wings are good, bowls are surprisingly better.Is that wrong to say?  Will I be shunned now?Not sure, I mean, ok the wings are very good, but those bowls hit the spot.But seriously, just get the wings, they are good.Seating is limited - they need to work on this.It's as casual as casual can be.  Good lunch spot.Bowls are good, but get the wings."
I love crisp!I get the seoul sassy boneless wings and they are so amazing every time that I'm craving them again only a few days later.
"I visited Korea for 3 months and during that time I probably consumed my weight in Korean fried chicken. Crisp hits the nail on the head with their interpretation of KFC. Seoul sassy = awesome sauce. Enough said. Their eponymous chicken leaves nothing to be desired with the satisfying crunch you get from every bite. This is probably as good of KFC you'll find stateside, certainly in the Midwest. I have mixed feelings on the size of the wing. I like that the wings are hefty and meaty, but it can be a little overwhelming to eat something so large when it's covered in sauce, even if it is awesome sauce. The wait is not too bad to get your food, but be prepared to be shoulder to shoulder during busy periods. If they made crisp into a sports bar a la Pluckers (Texas folks you know what I'm talking about), I'd be hard pressed not to give it 5 stars."
"love this place! was recommended by a friend and then i saw that it had over 1600 reviews. i love the area it is located in, and the service is awesome, food always hits the spot and i love that i can get some amazing wings with korean bbq. i loooved their crisp wings. their wings are also enormous!"
"The food here is incredible. It's unique and affordable and absolutely tasty.What I will say, is that if you live in the area, particularly during peak hours, you should consider takeout. The space is very casual and has limited seating and it gets very crowded, very fast. The portions are very large, so be careful not to over-order, and share when you can! The whole chicken dinner can easily feed 3 people. I am excited to go back and try some of their bowls, which I have heard are great and they look phenomenal!"
"Check your takeout order before leaving .  Went to pick up my order , went home only to find out I was missing the brown rice order .   It's a simple straight non complicated order chicken wings and rice how can you mess that up ?"
"Go for the wings - Meaty, crispy, and addictive. So good I haven't bothered trying anything else. I've even gone out of my way to come here. Crisp BBQ wings FTW."
"Pretty good chicken! I tried the wings, Seoul sassy style and it was great! It has the unami and fish sauce taste that makes these types of wings so special. The guy taking our order was super friendly and nice.  Nobody tried to rush me, especially as I was slow since it was my first time.  Recommended to all my buds in Chicago. Light, airy and young atmosphere."
"The most delicious chicken I've had in a long time. Be warned that the wings are quite large. The Buddha bowls were a little bland, but with hefty amounts of vegetables. Somewhat crowded at lunch time, but worth the wait. Table and counter seating was available, but you may need to share space. Thankfully there was hand sanitizer and plenty of napkins nearby. Bring a friend so (s)he can tell you if you have sauce stains on your face."
"Those wings though! Excellent selection of Korean fusion food. Wings are bigger and better than any other place, the chef knows what he or she is doing when buying them. The price is pretty awesome given the quality and taste of the wings. Atmosphere is neat: get up and close with your neighbors while chowing down. Well done, Crisp."
"Visiting Chicago and someone suggested we stop here - it is FANTASTIC! Great vibe inside, a communal-seating area that is fight-for-it. A great hipster place with really good food for a great price! Definitely will go again on our next visit to the area!"
"The prices are ok.I had the Bulgogi Steak Bowl. It was literally just Bulgogi on top of rice with green onions sprinkled on top; pretty simple.I thought it was pretty good, albeit a little sweet for my taste.I went on a Saturday afternoon around 2:00. The place was pretty packed, but I was able to find a seat at one of their long tables."
This place is AH-mazing!! The Seoul Sassy wings are IN-credible. Can't stop eating them. Sweet and crispy. Simply perfect.
"Warning: these wings are HUGE. Like actually gigantic. You know how if you go to a restaurant like bdubs and order wings, each wing is really just a wing section? Like either a drumette or one of those middle pieces with the two bone? Well one wing here is a whole wing, including the drumette, middle, and tip, so an order of 10 is really the same as ordering 20 normal wings. Also factor in that the wings are deep fried and slathered in sauce to help you decide how much you would be able to eat.Our group of three ordered 10 wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce (clever clever) and a Seoul Steak bowl, all to share. I had 2 wings and a scoop from the bowl, and I was done. The other girl also ate about as much as me. My third friend (a guy) is a beast and ate the remaining 6 wings and half the bowl, what a champ.As for the food, it was okay but not my favorite. The wings were super fried, and the sauce was way too sweet for my tastes. The bowl was okay, although I wish it came with some veggies (my friends ordered for me since I was running late, so maybe it was my fault). The sauce that you can put on top was amazing but also super rich and spicy. I think it was called Angie's something something - get this and try it with your bowl! Overall, decent food, and while it's not my favorite, this is a place that I wouldn't mind revisiting with friends."
"I read the reviews on yelp and I decided to try this place out. Good thing I did because I thought the chicken wings were great. I was told to order only 5 wings because the cashier said that's what typically filled people up. I ordered 10 and I was barely able to finish them. The wings were flavorful, big, and cooked just right. The bbq wings were delicious. The wings were surprisingly big and I like how they are bigger than your typical wing spot. I can't wait to come here again, only down side is that it is far from my house and finding parking isn't the easiest thing in the area of the restaurant. Other than that they had great food at good prices and I would highly recommend coming here if you are a big fan of chicken wings."
Wings were big. Flavor is ok.
Wings off the chain.  Worth the ride from milwaukee to get some wings and watch the Packers stomp the Bears
"My oh my... I have been too busy lately with Midterms, Birthday Party, Finals, work, Anime Central, Flying to Korea, Going to Lollapalooza... Well, I am back! I was lucky enough to order delivery at Crisp during a stay at a friends during Lollapalooza.Delivery:Nothing special. They promised within the hour and they made it just in time. $5 is pretty steep for one and a half miles though. I would have walked there if I didn't have Lollapalooza to get ready for.Food:The quality and portions are there. I had a Bulgogi Beef Bowl with an egg on top with extra meat.  I usually order extra meat otherwise they give you way too much rice and not enough beef. The quality of the beef is up there, but I haven't exactly experienced top class Korean Beef yet. It is not to sweet with a balanced amount of seasoning with tender meat. I like it! The rice is also very good quality, but I don't know what country the rice comes from, I still can't tell the difference between Japanese and Korean rice. As a rice eater my whole life, the rice here definitely makes me happy. The fried egg was pretty blehhh. Blandest egg of my life sadly. I really enjoy this dish though, and it will satisfy the hunger beast. The Seoul Sassy fried chicken was a new experience for me. I really enjoyed the seasoning, but I feel the quality of the meat is not up to par with most respectable chicken establishments. I really want to order the chicken strips with the Seoul Sassy seasoning next time.All in all, I will order here again for sure! They have really good food, and I might bump this place to five if I discover tasty new items on the menu. Or if I visit the place in person."
Finger licking good!
"When it comes to my orange haired suburban counterpart I feel like Todd Clearly from the movie Wedding Crashers while Candice is clearly the Senator played by Christopher Walken. We have about as much in common as Paula Abdul and the other guy in that Opposites Attract song, but after a visit to the Nature Center and Crisp yesterday we definitely bridged the gap. Great for both veggies and meat-atarians they provide about as affordable and delicious a meal as you'll find anywhere in Chicago. The chicken is legit some of the best in town, while the Buddha Bowls offer a gigantic portion of half healthy sustenance if you don't dig on animal flesh. Easily a two meal visit, you'll definitely cover lunch and dinner for under $10 by lunching here. The bowls are packed with tons of fresh veggies, rice, shrooms, and all sorts of other tasty little surprises that will leave you satisfied whether you add chicken or not. There's plenty of other options as well including wings, boneless strips, burritos, and sandos. Something for everyone no matter how different you and your dining partner are. It's small and seating can be in pretty close quarters so if you don't like touching elbows with a complete stranger while you're macking down on your dinner then you may want to take it to go. Either way though you're going to be completely stuffed and have a big smile on your face when it's all said and done."
All of these reviews are needlessly verbose. Best wings in town. Eat here.
"Fried cheekunnnn time.I lived in New York and must confess that Crisp is BETTER than Bonchon (did I just say that?). Yes, Crisp is the best Korean fried chicken this New Yorker has ever had.Half Seoul Sassy and half Crisp BBQ is the way to go until you decide which you like better. The Seoul Sassy sauce is unbelievable, but the BBQ is spicier. The Buddha bowls (bibimbap) are also very good. BYOB, and this becomes the perfect spot to hang out on a Friday night. Unfortunately they close early (9pm?) so don't think of it as drunk food.It can get crowded. Most people will stand around like hawks waiting for a spot at one of the communal tables to open. And be prepared to carry the scent of chicken all the way home."
That was amazing!  I just moved into the neighborhood and I'm 4 minutes away and if they were still open I would walk back over and high five everyone who works there!! Just had the wings this trip. They were huge and delicious!  Can't wait to try the bowls
"The best chicken wings in Chicago BAR NONE. Also, a nice selection of Korean beverages and entrees."
"3 stars for the wings - nothing to write home about. Everything else was terrible. Burrito or bowl - first off, the rice to meat ratio is way off considering that terrible burrito cost me nearly 10$. Second, not enough flavor to carry the abundance of bland tortilla and rice. Best Korean food - regardless of mexican wanabee fusion or not in the city is still at Snack corner in Joongboo. Chicago is a sad city for Korean food. Sad sad city."
"I seem to lack the fried chicken gene but I keep trying and I may have found a place that could make me cluck with more pleasure about this all American dish - at a Korean chicken place!  I liked the cheap prices, the communal tables, the super friendly staff and the whole comfy vibe of this small but nice restaurant.  We split an order of wings and one of strips, half with bbq and half plain Jane.  I liked both but preferred the plain Jane with some extra sauce on the side.  We also ordered fries and mushrooms, those mushrooms were pretty darn good as well.I made a special trip here this time, just to try their chicken.  If I was a nut about this kind of food I would be planning an immediate return trip.  For me, I just like knowing it is there and if I was nearby, I would go again.  If you LOVE fried chicken, you will probably adore it and if you don't, you will probably like it too.However, there are other cool things on the menu and maybe I will wing my way here sooner and try them.  (Did you get the pun?  Ha ha!)"
Great wings. I've been to my fair share of wing places but this one is by far my favorite. I've only been 3 or 4 times because I live about 30 miles away but when ever I'm in the area I seek t his place out.
One of my favorite places in the city! The wings are HUGE and the sauce is fantastic.
Seoul Sassy for real.Huge wings. The Buddha bowls are really resfreshing too while eating salty wings. A tad pricey. There's really not much else to say for a place that sells vegetable bowls and wings. Seoul Sassy.
"The best $10 I spent this week. And well worth the 1 mile walk in 13 degree weather. (I really should just end it with that)Food was incredible. I'll save you some time, just get the wings. Either sauce will do. There's only 5 but they are monster. The staff was super chill too. As they were sliding my card through the machine, the internet went down. And rather than complain about it (I got the impression that it wasn't the first time that happened), they apologized profusely and took it very seriously. These were young kids, and I give them credit for that. It would be easy to just blame it on something/one and say ""sorry, try again another day"". But they put my order in immediately and said they would let me know when the problem was fixed. Kudos. BYOB is always a plus, still unsure about the communal seating. The guy behind me and I kept bumping elbows. Definitely congested (especially with a crowd)Definitely will be returning."
"Woah, this place lives up to all of the hype!Order the wings, try them half and half so you can try two flavors. I tried the seoul sassy (ah-mazing) and the crisp BBQ (not as good as the Seoul but still good. They also have a big kick!). These are whole wings, which is a huge bonus in my book. I just had the 5 wings and I was stuffed! They also have the best canned pop selection (tahitian treat, cream soda, root beer)!!!!"
"Love at first bite.While 9.95 for 5 wings is a bit steep, when love comes a'h calling you answer."
"I used to go the Toreore in H-Mart (Niles) to get Korean fried chicken, but after trying Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ fried chicken yesterday, Crisp has become my new go-to place. The difference between the fried chicken from Crisp and Toreore is that Toreore has much thicker breading, which tends to soak up the grease and be much more filling. I was much happier with the crispy skin and scant breading on the fried chicken served at Crisp.That said, I couldn't give this place 5 stars because the ""Korean greens"" (aka banchan) were mediocre. There were only worth eating to cleanse my palate periodically (more necessary for the Crisp BBQ sauce than the Seoul Sassy sauce).There are 4 or 5 long tables and benches here, so expect to share a table with strangers if you plan to eat in. If you don't plan on licking your fingers clean, there are rolls of paper towels and wet napkins available with which to clean your hands."
"Delicious delicious whole wings.  I went here with my dad.  He hardly ever likes to venture outside his neighborhood in the Gold Coast, so I knew it would be good if he was willing to even get on a bus for it.  When you get chicken wings at most places, you rarely get full wings.  This place not only serves actual, full wings, but they are also delicious.  They are unlike anything I've ever had.  Korean flavored, super moist, and flavorful wings.  A big plus is that the delivery guys are really cute.  I'm a sucker for a cute cyclist with tattoos, and these guys fit the description."
"I'm not impressed by the bowls.  Basically no imagination, the bolgogi is on point taste wise. But it's less than awesome. Those chicken wings are baller"
"I much preferred the Crisp BBQ flavor - had a little bit of a kick to it and was fried to perfection. I didn't think the Seoul Sassy one was as flavorful, but apparently that's just me. Their bibimbap is actually quite authentic - I was very pleasantly surprised - especially because they call it a Buddha Bowl, haha.Deep fried mushrooms were just deep fried mushrooms - they tasted good but honestly anything deep fried tastes good to me. Nothing special, honestly a waste of calories... better to go with something more flavorful and less heavy on the side, especially because the chicken is already fried!We went on a Sunday night and had no trouble with seating. Anyway go, eat, make friends, and then go home and sleep off the food coma."
"You are missing out on heavenly wings if you don't go here!!! Three of us went and got the 10piece wings, and we were struggling to breathe after. The wings they serve are mammoth size. The Sassy Seoul & the BBQ sauces are divine. I would wear the sauce as perfume if it was socially acceptable.The radish kimchi is also great."
Amazing sauce and the chicken is crispy. We got the hot BBq and the Seoul sassy they both are amazing nothing like i have tasted before. The Hot BBq is actually hotter than i thought it would be. They actually use the sauce in the yellow bottle on your table to make the Hot bbq sauce( try comparing taste).  The Seoul sassy sauce is amazing and it was  different. We got the 19.00 for whole chicken and two sides and two drinks.  we left there full for the both of us. If in the area and love chicken I recommend it.
"Chicken wings? Yes, and huge! By far the best ""korean"" chi-wings in Chicago. I say ""korean"" because the sauces are more americanized to me. However, they are all really good. I like the fact that you can order spiciness level for the crisp BBQ and the Buffalo. If you like spicy go ahead and order the spicy ones! They are the bomb! The chicken is so big, juicy and flavorful throughout. The sauce makes the chicken wet, but it is oh so crispy as the name implies. You can tell their sauces are homemade and unique recipes!The rice dishes are just decent. You better go to a korean restaurant if you want to eat bibimpab. Their fries are good. Thin and crispy like McDonalds fries. Above all check out their sauces laying around the tables. My favorite is the atomic sauce! BEWARE! For a regular guy, five wings is a lot!!"
I absolutely loved this joint. The food itself was outstanding. Seoul Sassy wings were delicious. Staff was great in helping an out of towner with the better meal for 2. Wanted to post about the ambiance that I noticed tho which was a huge bonus. I like laid back restaurants. I like 90's music. I like the 2 cashiers discussing Rocky 4 while behind the register while the movie was on the TV inside restaurant. I love random things like that. This place had it. Keep doing what you're doing fellas. Great job from this Cali kid.
"I'm a big wing guy, and hearing so much of this place I had try it. Buffalo wings are my norm but I wanted to see if these can stand next to classic, and boy it did. In a very lively location crisp is kinda hidden on a street full of great food and entertainment. If you see a small orange place that's packed you prb found it. We got 20  wings for the 3 us and there was more then enough. The wings are pretty big and filling. Saying that they are ""crisp"" is a understatement. The wings are we're some of the crispest things I have ever eaten and not in a oily way! The meat was very bony and sometimes unappealing but hey that's  real chicken for u! Overall Seoul sassy is the way to go, Crisp BBQ is more plain, gotta try buffalo! Love tge sauces atomic is ranchy n buddha is smoky i mix them! Haven't had the bowls or burritos but I will be back for sure. Only downside is the place is small very limited seating ;( but just might be some of the best wings in Chicago."
"This place is the truth. I am pretty sure the suicide wings made me hallucinate. I've had a Yelp account for almost 5 years, and live in Miami. This is my second review. Make of that what you will. Cheers."
"I cannot even express how wonderful this place is. I've been here a few times and it keeps getting better and better. I went on a Saturday afternoon and it was not very crowded, and it was easy to find a seat (there's very limited sitting space there). This last time, we went at about 8:30, and it was almost impossible to find a seat (we happened to get lucky!). There was a line to the door the whole time we were there. Their chicken wings are some of the best I've ever had. 10 wings ($15.95) are equal to about 20-25 wings anywhere else. They're full wings, and huge portions. We got half sassy, and half BBQ. Both were wonderfully crisp on the outside with tender chicken on the inside. The sauces are amazing, and you can taste that everything is fresh. Their atomic sauce is also pretty phenomenal. My one beef with this place is that they close at 9:30, and stop taking orders at 9:00. That's their choice, but they probably lose a lot of business by not being open later. They were still standing-room-only packed when they closed, and they turned a lot of people away."
"Loved this place! Very glad I don't live next door. 3 of us shared a whole chicken three sides and three drinks for just over 30 bucks with the special. Sides rocked staff rocked food rocked. Will be back to try the other sauces, I knew it would be great by the scores of grub hub bikers coming through for pick ups"
"The past times I have been here have been a wonderful experience. The seating area is a little small and sometimes you might have to sit next to strangers when it gets busy. Service is very friendly and speedy. I'm from Florida and every time I make a trip out to Chicago, I always make time to go here. When friends visiting the Chicago area ask me for recommendations on where to eat, this is always the first place I tell them that they MUST go to. Food: We ordered Sassy Seoul fried chicken wings and the Big Boy Buddha Bowl (with beef) both times, and let me tell you, they were freaking delicious and totally worth the money. I'm a huge bibimbap fan and Crisp's buddha bowl did not disappoint. The Sassy Seoul wings were perfectly seasoned and as its name says, crispy, yet it didn't feel like I was eating twice-fried-oily chicken. It was just perfect. On the way out, I picked up a strawberry frozen fruit bar and ate it on the way home! Also, my favorite Chicago dessert place Molly's Cupcakes is just 0.5 mi away. It's a 10 min walk or a 2 min drive away."
"Despite numerous problems with our delivery orders, I'm still a fan of this place. You can't get chicken like this anywhere else, so I tolerate a bit of unpleasantry at times because of that.I get the Bad Boy Budha bowl - loaded with veggies; this is so yum. My husband always gets the Seoul Sensation Bowl and loves the atomic sauce that comes with."
"I guess after reading the reviews here I expected more of this place. Being from Socal where K-town Korean food is basically the best in the country, I was kind of disappointed with Crisp here. I'd still recommend them for their wings, but honestly, it isn't that amazing. It's just your typical korean food. Maybe I'm Korean food spoiled."
"The Seoul Sassy wings are addictive. I get them every time I come here. The wings are nice, big and flavorful. If you are into some intense spiciness, I recommend the spiciest version of their buffalo wings. Your tongue and lips will burn while snot drips down your nose. The quality is consistent and though I have only down delivery once, it came unbelievable fast. The service is great and I really appreciate that when the wings are a bit on the skimpy side, they throw in an extra wing or two. Best wings in Chicago, hands down!"
"Consumed with a love for fried chicken and Korean flavors, after moving to Chicago Crisp was near the top of my list. For heath reasons I often stay away from fried foods, but after months of waiting a fateful walk on a far-too-empty stomach had me answering the siren's call.I ordered 5 wings with the homemade Seoul Sassy sauce and a side of Korean pickles vegetables, and eagerly waited, mouth watering in earnest. Fried chicken is one of those things worth waiting to be freshly cooked, so a ten minute wait was more than acceptable.Now, to the chicken. The sauce, while tasty, was not unique from others at Asian fusion restaurants. The chicken sure was juicy, but the batter was just off. A little too thick and slightly overlooked, the batter was heavy and almost brittle- far from the perfection of Cleveland's Hot Sauce Williams (but that's a review for another page!). The vegetables were very disappointing, as they were over seasoned with copious amounts of salt and didn't really resemble the traditional preparation. I would return to Crisp, perhaps with a group of friends, but it won't be my voice for either fried chicken or Asian fusion in the future."
"This Place is awesome. I love the Seoul steak bowl, and the chicken is out of bounds good. I have never had a bad meal here, and the dipping sauces are on point. The only issue is the amount of space there, as it is usually shoulder to shoulder with people. We usually get it to go, because there is rarely ever seating."
"This place had been open long enough to make enough profit to open up a bigger place... It's just too crowded and cramped.  But the wings are on point with the flavor! BBQ and Sassy are the best!!! So delicious, we ate them in our car! I would have given 4 stars but this small little space they pay so much rent for cost them that extra star."
Love this place! We love the foodies choice. That with a side of chicken wings with the seoul sassy marinade. Perfect. Gotta take advantage of the delivery service....
"YUMMOLICIOUS!  To die for Sassy Seoul Chicken Wings.  Loved the skinny fries, a small order was more than enough for 2.  I enviously spotted someone having the Big Buddha Bowl and will definitely be trying that next time.  So happy to have finally tried Crisp, it is a real gem!"
"Great food and super nice employees! Living across the street is super dangerous. The Seoul steak bowl is my favorite, but the wings with the Seoul sassy sauce are just as good. Their atomic sauce is a little spicy, but is a great addition to any meal. The seating in there can be tricky so taking it to go is definitely the better choice."
"Honestly a religious experience.I visited from the Metro Detroit area and I am missing Crisp already. There is a similar Korean BBQ / Chicken restaurant about half an hour from me, however they take anywhere from 30-50 minutes preparing the food. To be honest, the Korean chicken I'm used to doesn't even TOUCH Crisp's level of excellence.We ordered the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ flavored wings and two sides of rice. It was a large order and it took them less than 10 minutes to prepare. LESS. THAN. TEN. I cannot even explain the magnitude of that. When the food arrived I literally sat there in awe. It's a shame they don't have a twitter because even though I never use it, I would've hashtagged the crap out of them. The wings were hot and slathered in yummy, yummy sauce. It's not like the wings you get at bdubs where the food is drowning in it, and there wasn't a messy disaster all over my hands and face when I was finished. I personally prefer the Crisp BBQ because it had that nice spicy and tangy kick to it, but both are absolutely delicious.Indoor decor was actually very cute as well. Lime green walls and humorous posters and flyers, I got a good chuckle out of them. It can get a little crowded though, but I went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too bad. Very good turnover.It honestly sucks living 5 hours away from Crisp. But I'll find a way to get there every time I'm in Chicago."
Try their wings!! Normally half an order is more than what i need. But i finished them anyways. Small store space. People are nice there.
"I came here because it was rated so well only to realize I had drunkenly stumbled in years ago on a college trip to Chicago. The wings were just as good sober though. 5 wings are enough for a single person, they are big, only about $10. You can get two different sauces too, I just had the house sauce (Seoul Sassy) and it was great. Grab some napkins!!!"
Amazing crispy whole wings! Huge!! Extremely spicy just how I like it. They were playing asap rocky and the speakers which was a plus. Highly recommended for wings!
"EXCELLENT Korean fried chicken. It really makes me nostalgic of midnight dinners at OB Chicken back in Oakland. I feel like Korean fried chicken improves on American fried chicken in every possible way. It uses smaller pieces of chicken, so you get a higher surface area to volume ratio which means more crunchy goodness on the outside. It's usually slathered in some special sauce which leads to the flavor explosion of sweet, spicy, salty at the same time, while still managing to retain that lovely crisp.The wings at crisp are HUGE. They are the full wing, not just a drumstick or a midjoint. It's the entire thing. I tried the Seoul Sassy which had a hint of sweet with strong and delicious soy-sauce and ginger tasting finish. Just give me 5 wings and call it a meal.I want to go back and try some of their bibimbap, which looked pretty popular."
"The wings are huge! 5 pieces for $8.95, but it's more like 10 pieces. The guy behind the counter suggested that we get half BBQ and half seoul sassy since it was our first time there. We ordered 10 wings and got pretty full afterwards. The seoul sassy was my favorite! They also have some sauces on their tables. They look interesting- one was called ""Buddha."" Our wings had plenty of flavor, so I didn't even try them. Can't wait to go back!"
"I was really excited about the concept but the execution is lacking. The chicken is great for bar food, but if you're trying to compete on a higher level it falls flat. If I was hungover I'd order again in a minute. The fries were delish.  The chicken is good, but looks like it could have come from a frozen food vendor. The sauces were really messy for delivery, created a huge mess.  They are on the sweeter side, wish there was more depth. You could do worse, but only in a pinch can I recommend."
"I was visiting a friend in Chicago and he suggested Crisp for lunch. Not knowing much about Korean food, I wasn't sure what I might be eating, but was up for something different. SO GOOD!! We had the Buddah  bowl and both kinds of wings and oh my gosh they were amazing. I got so full, but didn't want to stop eating the awesomeness.  - very small place- you order at the counter- they were really nice and helpful In explaining the food options to me.- long, picnic table kind of tables for seating-clean, really nice bathroom (ladies) 4 stars is for the food and the service, the place could stand to be bigger and better seating options. but that will not keep me from going back on my return trip to 'Chicago this summer. I have been thinking of those wings ever since and has me searching here in St.Louis for something similar."
"I used to come over here all the time for the wings when I lived nearby in Lakeview...and now I still do, even though I have to make it across town from Logan Square...that's how good these wings are. crispy, flavorful, and huge! I also love the buddha bowls, so much flavor packed in! hands down, the best fried chicken in the city!"
"Holy Toledo the chicken here is so darn good! I could barely take a breathe while I was inhaling it and think I may have swallowed a bone. But that's ok because you will want to eat the bones, it's that good. I got the 8 piece and they let me choose 2 sauces, so I got the BBQ and the Seoul. It's not a saucy sauce, it's more like cooked in, but it's still to die for. Just a little bit of sweet and spice at the same time. I also got a side of fries, a small was enough for 2 ppl. The service is so friendly too. The guy asked me if I wanted any extra sauce on my way out and kindly gave the Atomic sauce and said it goes good with the fries. Friendly service and amazing food. I'll def be back soon!"
"Holy balls! Or I should say holy bowls! This place is delish. And it's super cute inside; the pics don't do it justice. It's pretty small, but it feels like a friend's cozy dining room with community tables (and a few stools placed by the windows). Kind of a hipster haven (which is fine by this SF girl). Want a bowl of yumminess? Opt for the baby Buddha (plenty to fill your tummy) and you can add meat to any bowl size. Got a manly appetite? Opt for the bad boy Buddha. Or if you are insane go for the big boy Buddha and good luck! Want it all wrapped up? Yep, you can get everything in the bowl wrapped up in a burrito! Or if you're just feeling like you need to eat a half a chicken you can get some Seoul slappin' sassy wings! The rice is sticky and perfect (and you can order organic brown rice too) and covered by chilled veggies (the number and type of veggies differ according to your bowl size). I ordered the baby Buddha and added the beef. I forgot to cancel the egg on top, but it ended up being pretty damn good. I really like dichotomies in my food: sweet and spicy, warm and cold, salty and sweet. The bowls provide an interesting layer of cold rice and veg, warm meat and a freshly cooked egg. And as a condiment lover, I adore the choice of sauces provided on each table. The atomic and the Buddha sauces are oh so good! I can't wait to go back and try the chicken. Also, the beef was so good I might go for a Seoul steak bowl (meat, scallions over rice). Downside - cash only, but they have an ATM onsite and charge a modest $1.00 fee. Upside: they deliver. And the food is freaking good!"
"I'd definitely recommend this place - when describing it to a friend, he called it ""the best place near Belmont"". Basically, it's a smash-up of a fried chicken shack and a Korean take-away. There are at least 6 different sauces for your wings, and numerous other options - I had a Baby Buddha Bowl with bulgogi, which tasted exactly right, and my friends got 5 wings to share. We took them back to her place as the inside was hot and a little crowded. I think this could be excellent party food if you ordered like 20 wings and a bunch of sauces. Delightfully spicy!!"
"Amazing wings! Big wings, ask for all 3 sauces. Buddha Bowl with steak is great for the healthy. Great laid-back hipster feel in Lakeview. Delicious."
"Please expand your establishment. How dare you make me wait in line for your delicious wings and fusion entrees. Buy out the building next to you. Buy out the stereo system store across the street and make an underground tunnel that connects both restaurants. How a stereo store is still in business today is shocking, you'll probably get a good deal for the lot. I'm pretty certain I'm speaking on behalf of all of people who have eaten chicken wings. Please and thank you."
Got five-piece wings seoul and the big Buddha bowl with tofu. Enough to split bet two people.  Both were winners. Quick quick service! Friendly too! Wish the Seoul was a tad bit less sweet. The Buddha bowl was absolutely awesome. I would definitively go back for the chicken and bowls!!
Ordered chicken wings. Too huge for my liking. The chicken  must have plenty of hormones to be that huge.  They were just ok not over the top.     The fries..........not so great. Will probably try a different dish in the future.
"Wonderfully prepared fried chicken at a good price.  Seoul Sassy is the way to go on the sauce.  Be prepared with lots of beer and/or water as this is very salty chicken.   If I had written this review yesterday I would be giving this place 4 stars based on my previous experiences.  Unfortunately I tried something new last night and got the BBQ Spicy Sauce - WAY TOO SPICY.  I had to throw away most of the chicken because it made my face hurt.  Not sure who could enjoy such a heavy hand with the heat.  I will be back to Crisp, but will return to my usual Seoul Sassy Sauce."
Ok Crisp. The name.....it throws people off.  Unhealthy perhaps? Fried? No it's just plain deliciousness. Shame on us for not coming here sooner? All kinds of options. Food is awesome. Sitting family style awesome. #goodstuff
I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I'm not even gonna tell you how good it is. Just go. Now. Leave work.
"Seoul and Sassy FTW!You can NEVER go wrong with an order of wings with this sauce.  It's sweet with just a bit of a kick.  It's my absolute favorite.  The wings are ginormous, too, so take that into account if it's your first time looking at the menu (5 wings for $9 or 10 for $16).  The Seoul Steak Bowl is also one of my favorites at Crisp.  It's great if you're in the mood for bulgogi, but don't want to venture north or west to get some.  The bulgogi is served on top of their white rice and is a great portion size, too!  Oh, and let's not forget their onion rings.  There's something about the breading that make them very addictive.  If you call in your order, it's always done when they say it will be done.  This minimizes the time that you have to spend standing awkwardly inside the always crowded/cramped restaurant."
"Fried chicken doesn't get better than this, folks. I had the strips and wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce and enjoyed every bite. I only had to wait a few minutes for the food, which was a pleasant surprise since the Korean fried chicken place back at school always took 45 minutes for every order. Also ordered the Baby Buddha bowl, which was alright, but nothing out of the ordinary. Servings were quite large but taste was mediocre."
I tried Crisp after hearing rave reviews about their wings. I tried the buffalo and the Seoul Sassy. The Seoul Sassy was phenomenal. It was hard to find seating but a spot cleared up 5 minutes after we arrived. Overall great place.
"Delicious food, cool assortment of beverages, feeds 2 for 20.Awesome place for a casual date."
The food here is super tasty you should totally get the wings. If you like spicy food go here!
"These are some big ass wings. Like it's the whole wing including the drumette and the, um, finger? So when you're getting 10 wings, it's like you're really getting 20. This has made me decide that all wings should be served this way.They're fried quite well and the Seoul Sassy sauce is solid. Just sweet enough. I don't know how I feel about the accompanying sauces on the table but the wings have enough flavor already.The fries are pretty plain and unremarkable."
"If you love chicken and if you asian food, you are in luck and have come to the right place.  This place does korean chicken wings so perfectly that you will never want to go anywhere else.  I am thankful for my korean friends who know of such places to grab a quick lunch at.  Or else, me being settled in surburbia would never come here!  Street parking is available, but it's the city, so be prepared to park far.  Seating is very limited, so come way before the rush hour, pray that you will have a seat, or take out.  I came here with a bunch of friends and the service was great and they didn't mind that we lingered for a while, even blew out candles on a birthday cake and ate the cake in the restaurant.  We ordered several dishes and all of them were very tasty.  The whole chicken was battered and cooked to perfection and tasted sweet and tangy and the wings are big and so delicious.  Can't wait to go back!!"
"So mixed here but here's the straight dope on Crisp -GOOD CRISP1)Plain Jane wings were very good and had unique fried quality to them. Yes!2) Seoul Saucey wings were very good and not super sticky and gooey.BAD CRISP1) Original Bee Bim Bop was modest in size. Meat is extra. WTF?2) 15 wings and meatless BBB to go came out to $37. 3) No napkins were put in bag. For $37 you'd think they could give me a big roll!4) There were a couple wet naps. But when ripped open, they were bone dry.Verdict - because we were so pissed off to have to drive with sticky greasy hands (me and wife love to eat fresh fried wings while hot and crispy in car), I'll come back maybe once or twice a year. Wings are good but hate giving return business to stingy primadonna restauranteuers.The keepers are the ones who let the people eat and make take care of them when they are done. Unforgivable - $37 and not one napkin to go..."
After reading all the reviews and hearing all the rave about Crisp I decided to stop in and grab some wings. I am a chicken wing fanatic and I would have to say the wings I had at Crisp were definitely worth the hype. I tried the spicy buffalo and they were awesome.
Chicken wings are a must if you go here. Very crispy and tasty. We ordered the Buddha bowl also. It's huge so make sure to share. Staff is friendly and nice.
Yes the chicken is great! So I won't belabor this point. (Bimbimbap is also great!) Hooray for the buddha sauce too! I think the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars for me is that you can only order wings in an order of 5 or 10. Sharing 5 wings between two people means one person has to be the bigger man and agree to give the lesser man the 3rd wing. And I hate being the bigger man!
"TRULY gigantic chicken wings (which explains why they seemed pricey for the number) and large rice, protein, and veggie bowls are the norm at this Lakeview gem. I suggest ordering one bowl between two people and a 5 piece order of the wings (these are full wings with both the ""wing"" and the ""drummie"" attached). You will leave STUFFED. Food was very tasty and quickly prepared. Staff was friendly and attentive. I would definitely return for a quick lunch."
"As other reviewers have commented, the place is a bit cramped, and surrounding conversations can be loud. Don't come here for a first date, or an important business deal closing. Come here to get down on some wings.An interlude on gluten-free issues follows, so you may skip this paragraph if that doesn't matter to you. I'm gluten sensitive, so my first question was about the gluten-free nature of the wings. Here's what I learned: the wings have a rice-flour based batter (yes, GF!); the wings are not cooked in a dedicated fryer, so there can be contamination. Cut to the chase, if you have Celiac disease, I'd go the safe route and avoid them, but if you just have a sensitivity and can tolerate some contamination due to the likes of some errant onion ring batter then its on to the sauces. The only GF sauces are their Buffalo varieties (mild, spicy, suicide), of which I chose the spicy. All others contain soy sauce, thus some amount of wheat. I also ordered the Baby Buddha with beef, which can be gluten free as long as you avoid some of the sauces on the table (the staff was helpful in letting me know what was safe). That's what I ate, so I won't comment on the GF safety of other items, as I don't know.The review:Food ordered: 10 wings, half with spicy Buffalo (GF), and half with the Seoul Sassy (I think, those were for my friend, not GF), and the beef Baby Buddha (bi bim bap). One note, 10 wings here = 20+ wings at most places because Crisp give you the whole wing, end piece and all. Had we known this we'd have halved our order (wait, am I complaining about getting to eat more of these wings???)Frankly, the bi bim bap was good, but not great. I'd have been very happy to eat it on its own, and would have recommended the place to others on that alone. The complicating factor was the wings, which made the bap seem underwhelming due to their superb nature. So, I won't bad mouth it. The veggies were tasty, the beef cooked well, the egg was perfectly runny in the yolk, and the rice made an excellent canvas for the flavors. I added some of the different sauces (sparingly, due to most not being GF), and I really liked their flavors. (Note, I didn't mix sauces, just tried bits of each).If you can't already tell, I think the wings are the star of the show. I ordered mine with the spicy Buffalo sauce, but I think I'd have been happy with the sauce on the side in order to preserve the crispiness of the wings. The sauce was certainly tasty, but it definitely toned down the crunch. That said, the wings were still much crispier than wings I can usually find. I tried my friend's Seoul Sassy (not GF) wings, and they maintained a much better crunch, and I loved the flavor of the sauce. Also, the meat on the wings is both substantial and tender. My friend and I basically spent the whole meal in awe of how good the wings were. Further evidence? Okay. This is completely anecdotal, but the people sitting next to us had driven in from 45 minutes south of Chicago, on a Monday at 7 PM, to eat these wings. That is the type of the commitment that only things like religion and college sports fandom engender.Price:Totally reasonable. For two people, we had 10 wings (remember, more like 20), two orders of the bi bim bap, and I got a soda. That came to $37."
"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in all of Chicago. I am OBSESSED with Korean fried chicken and while Crisp does not come near Bon Chon, they still do a pretty damn good job. So flavorful and soooo much food. I can never finish when I split a 10 piece with a friend. The sauces (both on the chicken and on the side) are divine and my friends love the bowls and sandwiches. Nothing is at all pricey here and you really get your moneys worth. Luckily I don't live too close or I would be here constantly. Yay for KFC!!!"
"Seoul sassy wings, chilled Korean greens, magic mushrooms and allisons addddddictive atomic sauce.weekday special is a steal! $20 for whole chicken, two sides and two drinks...you need at least 3 people to finish all that!. Friendly staff..limited seating and sometimes a bit loud  so be prepared for that but very worth the trip!!!"
"One of the things I was crazy obsessed with in San Francisco were San Tung Chinese Restaurant's super famous dry fried chicken wings (DFCW).I can't believe I found San Tung DFCW's long-lost fatter half-korean sister at Crisp. Her name is Sassy, Seoul Sassy."
"An absolutely awesome establishment!  Out-of-this-world chicken served by an extremely friendly staff.  In particular, Julia goes out of her way to ensure top-notch service and satisfaction.  A must-stop for Chicago residents and visitors alike!"
I have been to crisp a few times and every time it has been great. I can't wait to eat there again. I can't wait to eat there again.
"Okay, first for full disclosure, I'm tough on any version of Korean wings after having them many times in Seoul over the last three years. I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to Korean food. I would skip most of the menu and go straight to the Sassy Wings. They aren't exactly what is served in Korea, but they are very good. They are more of a teriyaki version and not true Korean style, but the perfectly fried skin was so good, I easily forgave them."
"Did Ben Epstein and Cam Calderon ditch their Crisp clothing line to open up a Korean Fried Chicken restaurant in the same name?  Although I don't live in the comedic world of How to Make it in America, the wings here are better than their New York Bonchon counterpart.  The wings are colossal and it made me wonder if they came from Big Bird.  My friends and I ordered the Crisp BBQ wings, Seoul Sassy wings, and a Seoul Steak bowl.  The Crisp BBQ sauce is an Asian spin on a spicy barbecue sauce that reminded me of BW3's Asian Zing.  The trendy pick of the group belong to the Seoul Sassy.  The honeyed sauce prepared with ginger, soy, garlic and other spices left fashionable smudges around my lips.  I saved that residue for later for when I got hungry again.  The Seoul Steak Bowl is a massive crater of a bowl with bulgogi, rice, and other fixins.  The beef was sweetly marinated but engulfed with a copious amount of rice."
"I love buffalo wings in general, but this place adds an asian spin on the sauces and, dang, the wings are GIGANTIC!!!! Who else can beat that?!I would love to see someone order the whole ""bird"" at Crisp! :OThey also offer bimbimbop and some other sandwiches stuff, but WHY would you order those when their wings are sooooooo finger-lickingly good? :D"
"These chicken wings were THE best wings I've had so far. The portion size was humongous!!! 3 wings and some rice filled me up overwhelmingly! My favorites were the plain and Seoul sassy!!! Omg these wings just made my mouth water. They're juicy and full of flavor and crisp. Hence, the name of the place. They also have a red sauce and orange sauce that are also very delicious! The red one was a bit spicy for me but I loved the Orange sauce (atomic sauce). We also got the bulgogi and rice bowl. Don't quite remember the actual name because I didn't order it, but it was also delicious. There was complimentary water which was nice, and the service was quick! The seating is a bit weird though. It's almost like grade school cafeteria style so it was a bit awkward taking a seat next to a stranger that was in the middle of a meal. It's also pretty cramped but that is probably the only downside. There is a restroom open to customers and it was really clean! I loved the food so much I ordered to go to bring on the plane with me back to Vegas. Will definitely eat here again when I return to Chicago! *craving now*"
"Probably one of the best places in Lakeview area. Amazing wings, the Seol Sassy is the top sauce. Also, the chicken sandwich is very good. One of my go-to spots.Fries are OK"
"My wife and I came here on a Friday night and as expected this place was packed but we did manage to grab a seat. Given the location in Lincoln Park close to Diversey on Broadway, there is lot and I mean a lot of foot traffic. Thanks to extreme cold weather, it was not as packed as it usually gets.The menu is very straightforward. You come here either for the fried chicken or the american version of BiBimBop. I had both. For the fried chicken we tried the Seoul Sassy and Crispy BBQ and they were excellent with and without the sauces on the table. The sauces I like were the one which said Buddha on it and it tasted more like chilli BBQ and the other one is more like mayo slept with Sriracha. We each had the baby Buddha bowl and that itself was huge. The veggies were excellent and the rice was well cooked and moist. Next time, I may try the bigger bowls but if it were me alone, I will just try all the wings and go home a happy man. This place did look like it was BYOB.The prices are reasonable as well and for the quality and quantity, you get a lot of bang for your buck. Street parking can be a pain but I lucked out. Best way to get here is the L. On the whole, this is an excellent place to grab Korean version of Asian American fusion cuisine."
A ton of great food for the price. The wings are amazing!!!
I'm not a fried chicken fan. But my friend convinced me to come here and I really enjoyed it.
"Finger licking good! Traveled to Chicago recently for a short getaway and found this wonderful place. We only tried the chicken wings. There were 5 of us, we only wanted some snacks (we had a big breakfast prior). We opted for 10 whole jumbo wings. We ordered the Seoul Sassy Chicken Wings (this is their most famous flavor). You order from the counter and pay there, find your seats. They will call your name when your order its ready.These wings are huge! And they are whole wings.  These were juicy and crispy!! The Seoul Sassy is sweet and tangy with a hint of garlic taste. There were couple bottles of sauces on the table, I forgot what they are.These are perfect snacks!!  So deliciously good!!!"
Delicious chicken and sauces. On the downside it's very limited seating and kind of overpriced.
"I think they sell very good fried chicken.  This kind of chicken is more common in Korean, but not in this country.  Nevertheless, it seemed like a lot of Americans like this place (we were the only Asian at that time of visit).  They are also known for their bibimbab (rice with different steamed veggies and ground beef), but I didn't get to try it yet."
"The chicken here is really good...sometimes. Can be overcooked and somewhat dry even with sauce. The sides need a total revamp, preferably items that are NOT fried. The delivery is awesome. Those guys should be paid well."
"Wife, Akash S., and I hit up the long awaited Crisp to finally give their chicken wings a test.  Here's the scoop:Sassy wings - Holy smokes, this is phenomenal.  There's a well balanced sweetness to the saltiness, making this the best wings that we had here.  BBQ wings - Definitely has some hidden heat to it, and a nice change of pace from the Sassy, but honestly the sassy were better.Protip - These aren't those tiny wings you get at the bars... a wing here consists of the whole wing, so make sure you order accordingly... or prepare to have leftovers for later (which is pretty damn tasty anyway!)  Protip - Tables are large and can easily sit 6 with coats, or 8 without.  Cozy up with others and share the tables communal dining style, or expect to be waiting some time unless you have some voodoo luck...Verdict:  Excellent sassy wings, and I look forward to trying some of their other fried chicken offerings as well!"
"This is Lakeview and it was a Saturday evening...yet, a parking spot within the restaurant's ten feet radius was waiting for me...and there were four vacant seats within the restaurant. Wow, it felt like hitting a mini jackpot. To move on, Crisp is a very small eatery with limited seats. There is nothing spectacular or peculiar about the setting and décor (if there really was any). But who cares? This is the place to enjoy something dirty and zesty. (Don't take it the wrong way.) Our group had two orders of Seoul sassy wings, and one order of the Seoul steak bowl and Chi-town chicken bowl. The wings came in six pieces per order. They were indeed CRISP and golden brown! Yummy! In addition, I also had the Seoul steak bowl and it was enjoyable. To sum it up, it was a bowl of minced bulgogi atop seasoned white rice served with Alison's atomic sauce. Not quite a bibimbap, but nonetheless, you would still mix up the contents before digging in. The sauce is served on the side. I personally found it a very good compliment and ""moisturizer"". Overall, it was an enjoyable meal, but it wouldn't be enough to drag me out of Bridgeport and make a special trip. It may be a different story had I lived a few blocks from Crisp."
Great eats on a Sunday morning after being out with a few whiskey barons!  Seoul Sassy was right on!
I had the chicken wings with the seoul sassy and the suicide  buffalo sauce ... Amazing combination of sweet and hot saucee .. Loved it ! Next time Im gonna try the buddha bowl.
"Love the meal deal here: whole chicken, two sides and two drinks for $19.99. Friends and I actually ordered two of these deals, but so that we tried the chicken in a couple of different sauces--the Crispy BBQ and the Seoul Sassy. There's extra bottles of sauce around the dining area as well.The place can be crowded on a Thursday afternoon, but the room can accommodate medium sized groups (5-6). You'll probably need that many people to finish the meal deal."
"I couldn't wait to come home and write this review! This place has been bookmarked for awhile and finally decided to try it. Don't let the outside of this place fool you! It will be one of the best fried chicken you have ever had! We got half sassy and half BBQ. Very delicious and crispy! Also had the baby Buddha, stirred in some Buddha sauce and it was delicious! Definitely a place you would crave!!! I know I am already! ;)"
"Yup, yup. Nice big bowls of rice topped with bulgogi or chicken drenched in a light, sweet sauce. Yummy."
The best chicken strips I have ever had. The Seoul Steak Bowl is pretty great too. Huge portions. I always get double meat for a full second meal of leftovers. Only downside is that it's in Lakeview. Would love a Logan Square/Wicker Park location.
By far the best chicken wings I have had in a very long time. Wish there was a Crisp in Denver!!!!! Will definitely visit every time I am in Chicago.
"This place should be called crowded instead of Crisp. Okay, to be fair, I did come here on St. Patrick's day, but I seriously could not find a place to sit in here for like 15 minutes. This place has bench seating, and it's every man for himself. We finally found a place to sit on the edge of one table and pulled up a chair, but migrated when another bench opened up. Still there was literally no room to move my arms. In fact this place was so crowded that both my girlfriend and I each spilled our drinks within like five minutes of one another - seriously what are the chances. This is a pay and pick up your food at the counter kind of joint. We each ordered what was essentially a variant of bibimbap. While you do get a good amount of food, it was all rice and vegetables, and I thought it was kind of overpriced for that."
Damn good! I would recommend the Buddah Bowl w/ Chicken and the Magic Mushrooms.
"No kidding..the wings are ginormous! Got a 10 PC to share with my bf and also the baby Buddha and we had a ton of leftovers! Also, what do they put in that orange sauce? It's delicious!!!"
"I can't get enough of this place.  I honestly CRAVE their Seoul Steak bowl at least a couple times a week.  Thankfully, I only give into these cravings about once a week.  What I also love about this place is the staff is so friendly.  Always greeted with a nice hello when you enter and they all seem genuinely excited to be there.  My boyfriend absolutely loves their wings.  They are huge and an order of 5 is plenty for a big dinner.  The atomic sauce is the best, too - always ask for extra :)I recommend getting your food to go because you will most likely wait for a place to sit!"
Great chicken. Spice was amazing. No where to sit thigh but no worries. So good I ate it walking home.
"Crisp is great.  If you like wings and Korean BBQ, go here.  Seriously.I have tried them all, but I have to say that the Sassy is hands down the best option.  It is a little pricey, but lets be honest you get what you pay for.  I have only gone here on off-peak hours, but I can only imagine how busy this place gets on weekend nights.And the other great thing - they have bike messengers that deliver."
"I cannot even fathom why Crisp doesn't have a 5 star rating overall, unless you just do not like chicken. Every sauce is the bomb, and they have a great selection of drinks. The sandwiches and the wings are all perfect. I guess it is a little annoying that there isn't more seating and that they close at like 9, but everyone just loves it so much that they can never get enough I guess."
"Outstanding.  I first got hooked on Korean Fried Chicken in Santa Clara, CA (see review of 99 Chicken), and followed that with visits to the usual spots in NYC whenever I was in town.  But when I lived in Chicago, this was my go-to spot.  I literally ate here one or twice a week, to the point that when I called -- I guess they have caller ID -- they had already inputted my order into their computer as soon as their phone rang.Wings, plain jane, with a side of white rice.  Yes, please!"
"Hands down the best chicken place you can eat. Fries were just great, the chicken w/ their special sauce was ooohh sooo good lol. My favorite chicken to get is the Seoul Sassy."
"This is going to be simple...fantastic hot wings, cool community tables, very fast service and a great location. Before you judge anyone's wings, try these first."
"Dear Diary,It's me. Adriane. How come when I tell you things you never talk back? Luckily when I tell Yelp about experiences I usually get feedback.In fact, they even tell me cool stuff like about Crisp being delicious. So when my bestie suggested we try it...the prospect pleased.We went on an early weekday evening and it was busy. We ordered 5 wings in Seoul Sassy sauce, 3 chicken tenders in BBQ Spicy sauce, and a chicken breast sandwich in Seoul Sassy sauce. It's BYOB so while they made the order my partner bopped out to get beer. As soon as he returned the food was up and we got a table. The wings and tenders were so great it was hard to chose which sauce was better. The Sassy sauce is kinda complex and sweet and a transparent glaze. The BBQ was sweet with a spicy aftertaste. They were both sooo meaty, huge, and tender. I found the two sauces and meat quality and portions impressive. He liked his sandwich since it had veggies on it to elevate the flavor profile. I know, I'd always choose the wings or tenders. That's just me, different views, Diary, some people like cucumber better pickle.Anyhow, I definitely recommend it, Diary, not that I think you eat. And I'll post this on Yelp for those that do. I love you. And Crisp.Bye!"
"Went here with my cousins to grab a quick snack before the Cubs game. amg. We bought Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ wings. I thought these wings were going to be dinky and take a couple of bites to finish, but no. These were actual wings! Legs and wings! They were both flavorful and damn delicious. Finger-lickin' good. The Seoul Sassy was just the right amount of sweet and sauce. The Crisp BBQ was just the right amount of spicy and I personally thing the BBQ is better. Both had had juicy meat, both were crispy, both were bomb.Have a set of paper napkins handy before handling and inhaling the awesomeness."
The food here was amazing!  Got the sassy wings which were bomb. The seoul steak bowl was really good too. The wings here are huge so you can get a small order and share.
"Love this place. I usually get the bad boy Buddha bowl with chicken or tofu. My fb gets the wings. Call ahead if possible, there's always a line."
"I've dined in and have ordered Crisp for delivery several times since moving to Chicago in 2010. I'm a fan, and the food serves as a wonderful way to absorb last night's debauchery sitting in my stomach. Though overpriced, the benefit of the greasy joy has outweighed the cost of shelling out a few extra bucks. However, I gripe in this instance. I just ordered 6 chicken tenders, a large fry and a Big Boy Buddha Bowl for delivery. 25 minutes later, I get a call from the delivery guy and go and grab the grub. I anxiously rip open the bag and prepare myself for a hangover-curing, grease-filled meal. I take out the chicken tenders and they look delicious, those were fine. I pull out the fries and it's a different story. Every single fry in the bag was soggy and ..moist. Crisp? No, the opposite. I then pull out the Big Boy Buddha Bowl and it's cold. The rice is next, which was so soggy that it looked like a Chinese food container full of mashed potatoes. I usually just wing it in situations like these, so I threw the fries in the oven and the Buddha Bowl in the microwave. The rice, unfortunately, was unable to be revived. I like Crisp, I really do. But if I'm going to pay $32.49 (+$4 tip) for a bag of fries, 6 chicken tenders and a bowl of vegetables, then I'd strongly prefer that they are cooked properly."
Great wings & rice bowls. Don't come here if ya want ambience. It's like a college cafeteria.
I want to eat it every meals.
The wings are delicious! And the radish kimchi is pretty awesome as well. I definitely understand all the hype about this place. We will definitely be back!!
"Yuuuuummm!!! I got the Buddah bowl with chicken and it was scrumptious! Great people, workers, neighborhood, AND food. Do it! It's awesome! You won't regret it."
"My boyfriend and I just moved to Chicago and we had heard great things about Crisp so naturally, we had to go check it out.  The fried chicken did NOT disappoint.First, I highly recommend visiting between Monday-Thursday with a friend/significant other because they have a $20 deal and you get a whole chicken with choice of 2 sauces, 2 sides, and 2 drinks.  Keep in mind that this is probably enough food to happily feed 4 people so if there's just two of you, prepare to be stuffed.When we ordered a 'whole chicken,' I thought maybe it would come out like a rotisserie chicken but it's actually large pieces of breaded and fried chicken (breasts, wings).  I don't know what I was thinking...  Anyway, the chicken is perfectly crisp (duh) and incredibly juicy!  We ordered the BBQ sauce and the Seoul Sassy.  Personally, I thought the BBQ was a little on the spicy side which my bf enjoyed.  As expected, I LOVED the Seoul Sassy - ginger, soy, and all around deliciousness.  The BBQ sauce was definitely thicker and his half of the chicken was more sauced up.  I wish I had gotten more sauce but you have to pay for that.For our sides, we ordered the kim chi and the white rice.  The kim chi wasn't that good - We only ate a couple of bites and tossed it.  I don't think it was very authentic.  My boyfriend enjoyed the white rice but I wasn't a big fan.  As a rice-loving Asian, I thought it was clumpy and not in the good sticky-rice kind of way.  It just seemed like it was steamed with way too much water.  Oh well, we didn't come for the side dishes.  Next time I'll order the onion rings because they looked huge and, you guessed it, crisp.While we were there, we overheard another diner say, ""How could anyone be a vegetarian?!""  My thoughts exactly.Tip: Do NOT come here on a first date because you will absolutely get messy - As in finger-lickin-sticky-face-I'm-a-carnivore messy.  Enjoy it and bring a wet wipe!"
"My 5 star rating is for the chicken wings only. That being said...BEST. CHICKEN. WINGS. EVER. The seoul sassy is their best flavor. I really like their fries as the're not overly salty but still very tasty with the right consistency. I've had their korean burrito before and that was a mistake. Just come here for the wings and you'll be hooked. Seriously, I haven't wanted another wing since having these."
Typically not a big fan of wings but I LOVE their wings! They're really big as well! Couldn't even finish my order. Super crispy (suits their name) and flavorful. They also have a lot of sauce bottles on the table for you to use as a dipping sauce. Service was good too!
"I was visiting an old-time friend in Lakeview this afternoon and we decided to grab some lunch. She introduced me to Crisp, and let's just say I will be back!!!!  The seoul sassy wings were absolutely to DIE FOR! I love you, CRISP!!!!"
"I really do enjoy the low key, tasty, but heart attack enducing aspect of Crisp.  the menu is almost too limited in my eyes, but what they do make they make very well.  They wont win extra point for comfort or atmosphere (which is not necessarily unpleasant) and the wings are simply delicious, but is kind of hard to make a solid meal off of just fried chicken wings.  I think they should diversify their sides menu just to offer a more complete experience.  I do recommend for a great snack though, that sauce is tasty!"
"I have a lot of allergies and they were suuuuper accommodating and allowed me to change up the vegetables in my bowl. I am obsessed, and the only thing I would change is adding an extra egg next time. So confused as to why more people don't know about this joint. It has been here for a while and is sooooo great!"
This chicken will change your life. Keep going back so you can try all the different styles you can get their chicken. Their bowls n sandwiches are awesome too.
Seoul Sassy wings are better than all of the other wings. Crunchy and very good batter but the actual chicken was bland. The famous orange sauce just tasted like sriracha mixed with a lot of mayo to me. The people who work there are really nice.
"I feel very split on how to rate Crisp.  I love their food, there are few things I like better then the Seoul Steak Bowl.  The chicken is amazing as well, in other words if this review were based on the food alone it would easily be a 5.  Where the review comes down is in the delivery of the food.  It may be generous to say that 4 out of 5 times I have food from Crisp delivered there is an issue. The issues in delivery miscommunication range from simply not adding in a soda or extra sauce to leaving out an entire dish to getting the completely wrong order. My latest Crisp order, the delivery guy gave my food to the wrong apartment, and allowed some other tenant in my apartment to not only take my food but sign my credit card slip. I suppose the blame is split between the company they outsource to and the kitchen.  To be fair, I know it is a very busy kitchen they run, which is a testament to how great the food is.  Overall I would recommend Crisp, but I would recommend picking it up yourself so you can check your order."
"AWESOME wings---spicy, well flavored, and great service!  You MUST try the wings here!  ALL of them are great :)"
"Fried chicken was so dry and tough I spat out most of it.  I lived in Lakeview when Crisp first opened, and I loved their fried chicken.  I used to get it every Sunday  I happened to be in the neighborhood the other day, so I picked up a whole plain jane, even though I was in a hurry.  There was very little meat on half of the pieces, and they were so overcooked I couldn't chew through the meat.  It was like a jerky treat for dogs."
"As if this restaurant needs another glowing review.... but I'll give it one anyway.All of the fried chicken is so, so delicious - with or without sauce. Super crispy, super flavorful, and accompanied perfectly with their salty fries. Be prepared for huge portions and a low bill, for sure.My boyfriend also gives glowing praise to their bowls, which are also a huge portion. The only downside of this spot can be the seating. There isn't a lot, and it is communal. If that scares you, try to go during a non-peak time."
"To get straight to the point - I have lived here for seven years and have not found a better place for prepared chicken. Best buffalo chicken I have ever had in my life. Fun little spot to grab a bite and enjoy the view of Broadway. A MUST GO location in Lakeview. Believe me, you'll thank me for it."
"Been hearing a lot about this place and it's right in my neighborhood.  Have walked by it for months now and keep thinking to myself that I need to try it.  So last weekend I rolled in and decided to hit the primary items everyone talks about.  I did the wings three ways, the chicken sandwich and a bowl.  Now I was with my wife so I didn't plow this all down myself.  Bowls are solid, not incredible but pretty decent.  Portion was large but that was also a lot of rice.  Wife ordered this as a steak bowl.  Not a lot to it so I wouldn't say to get this one.  Plus it was pretty salty but everything here is pretty salty.  Now I think salt is critical to food's taste and home cooks general go too light handed on it.  I digress as this is not a lesson on salt but rather a review of Crisp!   Chicken sandwich = perfectly cooked chick that has an excellent breading to it.  Short comings to this are chunks of iceberg lettuce and rather lousy tomatoes.  I would take this without the terrible salad topping next time and enjoy it more.  The chick itself and sauce were excellent the bun however is sub par as well.  The sandwich would be top notch if they improved the bun and toppings a bit.  High point of the meal are the wings, damn those are good.  Large size wings not like bar hot wings, crisp is spot on for the description, sauces all tried and are all excellent.  I'm a fan of the hot stuff and I would state their descriptions are a bit off as the hot is pretty tame and blazzin or whatever they called their hottest were great and not painful as some places make the extra hot.  The wings are a 5 on the Yelp scale and I would stick to them for your order.  Sandwich is solid.  Might try some the Budhad bowls as I did not try them as folks seem to write that they are great.Would return, thinking take out on the wings once the NFL starts up.  Would even go chicken sandwich again but skip the salad and ask for extra sauce."
"I love this place! The food is amazing. Seoul Sassy wings are the best as well as Allison's sauce. I'be trying to figure out what the ingredients are with just my taste buds. Anywho, the price is pretty fair considering the size of the wings. My only con for this place is that the size of this restaurant is tiny! Not enough room to sit and having a large group probably won't work out well since it's often busy. I don't think I've been to Crisp where I didn't have to wait for seats, but it's definitely worth the wait since the food is just amazing. Love it!"
"Phenom dot com. The best wings I've ever had...ever. I'm pretty sure they came from pterodactyls. So massive, so delicious. We had half of the seoul sassy and half bbq, I truthfully cannot decide which I like more. Both of the hot sauces on the tables were awesome, especially the one that was sriracha based. I'm a huge fan of bibimbap, and theirs was really tasty. It came in a huge metal bowl and I had more than enough for dinner the next night. You definitely get your money's worth. At first I was a little put off by the close quarters and tight seating situation, but was over it almost right away. Not a ton of seating, but I was with a group of four at 8:00 on a Saturday night and we didn't wait long at all for a space to sit. Lastly, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful when it came to menu decisions. Can't wait to go back!"
"Love this place, though I have only tried the wings. Getting a seat is a challenge so a great take out place as well."
Chicken was terribly dry. Onion rings saved the meal. Won't be ordering from there again
"This place is highly over-rated. After fighting to get a table with people who think this is the place to bring a family and occupy a table 20 minutes before,and 30 minutes after eating, we get our food and sit down to eat. I order the ""suicide"" wings and immediately notice that their ""super hot"" flavor is about 5 rungs below the already weak Buffalo Wild Wings ""flamin' hot"" standards. Not to take away from the flavor - it was just not spicy as advertised. Additionally, it was not the highest quality meat I've had, and I was not thrilled by anything in particular at this place. Although it is just ""ok""."
"I am in love with Crisp!! :) Order the fried chicken with seoul sassy sauce! And the big buddha! Or any of the buddha's. Love this place!It is tiny on the inside and is mostly first come first serve seating. I suggest you have an early dinner here if you'd like a seat. Again, keep in mind this is Korean fusion food."
"Previously I had given this place 5 stars but after my experience at this place yesterday I'm doing exactly what the rude server told me to do and ""Go write on Yelp about it!!!"". So here I am!My boyfriend and I decided to walk a good mile south to this place because we so desperately wanted their delicious crispy chicken after the Pride Parade.  So we walk in and were excited the place wasn't packed. We were immediately launched at by one female staff member who shooed us away with her hands telling us ""WE'RE CLOSED!"" while shaking her head at us.  Now I gotta tell you that YES there was a sign outside that said ""closed"". However we didn't notice it, the delivery guys were walking in and out of the restaurant AND the door was open!!So we stood outside for a second and decided we thought it was very rude how they approached us. So I wanted to speak with them about it.   As I walk in the delivery driver runs up to the door and locks me out.  I said ""Can you please open the door I would like to speak with the manager"".  He says ""Oh No, it looks like the door is locked"". Really? Seriously!He finally decided to let me in. Within my first step some 6'4'' guy comes lunging at me saying ""GET OUT! GET OUT!"" he then told me he didn't care that they were being rude to us and to ""Go write about it on Yelp!"".  The only thing I could say in response to this kind of abuse towards their customers is ""Go F&*k Yourself!"" and then I walked out. I've never been so disrespected EVER at a restaurant. Done.  Never going back. Never recommending it!"
good sauce good wings fast delivery. This place has been my consistent chicken craving supplier for a while.  I would try it but make sure you try the different sauces first to make sure you can take the spicy stuff.
This review is solely for the Fried Chicken (Plain Jane). Best fried chicken I've ever had...better than any soul food restaurant I've ever been to and this is a Korean BBQ restaurant. I've never ordered anything else here as rice bowls aren't up my alley but the chicken is the best. Pricey but legit.
5 star for the wings and 3 star for Seoul Steak Bowl. The rice isn't even cooked yet. Will definitely go back for the wings but avoid anything with rice half done.
"I have lived in Chicago for a couple months now. I learned the hard way that Korean food in Chicago is....lackluster.... compared to Korean food in LA or even the Bay Area.However, the Seoul Sassy does not remotely compare to any Korean fried chicken I have ever had anywhere. The flavor is exceptional and truly one-of-a-kind."
Best chicken wings I've ever had in my life. I've lived in 6 major cities in America and nothing comes close to the flavors this place produces. Sassy Seoul is excellent and one of their more popular sauces. I recommend trying their Korean BBQ and tell them to make it spicy.
The food is pretty good but the portions are so large that I would suggest sharing most of the meals. The chicken wings are very large and very good. The only downside to this place is limited seating and the lack of individual tables. The food is prepared in a timely manor and the customer service is good. This place is also BYOB which is nice.
"OMG... these wings were BOMB. No really, they were that good and worth every penny. I ordered the 5 wings, my bf and I were struggling to finish it since we also ordered a beef bowl. The restaurant itself is quite small but with big long tables so it's a bit snug when you're eating and having to share the table with other people you don't know. By far these are best korean chicken wings I've ever had. The wings were crispy, just the right amount of flavor and not drenched with the sauce! The BBQ sauce was sweet but has a little kick which I absolutely loved. Please come to LA!!!!!!"
"I was never really a fan of wings until I went to Crisp. Now I'm addicted. They are SO GOOD. I get the Seoul Sassy sauce each time (I don't really like spicy stuff) and am never disappointed. Whenever I have visitors, I always try and introduce them to Crisp. They always love it. Even my mom thought it was amazing! I don't usually eat in the restaurant since it's so small (it is BYOB though!) so I usually do take-out. The staff are always friendly and funny. If you like wings even just a little bit, it is a must!"
"This place is so delicious. My husband and I like to get the special that they have Monday through Thursday. $20 gets you a whole fried chicken, 2 sides and 2 drinks. We can set it for at LEAST 2 days. Such a great value. The sauces are awesome and the flavors are so unique. If you want fried chicken done differently, this place is it."
"Incredible value and super tasty, giant, juicy Korean BBQ wings.  It's a small restaurant and gets crowded easily - I recommend getting take-out or delivery and munching the hell out with some buddies at home.  The bowls are for chumps - I feel like they are on the menu just to give people who need to fuss over options something else to order.  Maybe Crisp is overhyped, I don't know... but can an incredibly fun and flavorful dish at this price be overhyped?  It might not be possible."
"As I walked in, I saw a sign on the wall for a chicken breast milk shake (I think it was called the Gizzard Blizzard).  Haha, uhm really?  Anyways, I barely looked at the menu and decided on the $19.99 combo deal.  This came with a whole fried chicken, in 2 different sauces, with 2 sides, and 2 drinks.  Pretty sweet deal.The chicken had a nice crunch, which stayed crispy while covered in sauce, and the chicken was juicy.  The Seoul Sassy sauce was sweet and ginger-garlicky.  It's not your typical Korean wing sauce, but it was still tasty.  The Crisp BBQ sauce was good with a nice kick.  The fries weren't anything special, but the fried mushrooms were great.  They also have chicken strips as well as varioius Korean style rice bowls.  I love me some Korean fried chicken and Crisp definitely satisified.  I still wonder if that Gizzard Blizzard was for real."
"I'm a fan of crisp.  The wings are good.  Some of the other dishes were just OK.  Service is a hit or miss depending on who's there.  The crowds a little too yuppy for my liking but that can't be helped with the neighborhood it's in. If you haven't gone to this place give them a try.  Since I live by Dak (which I think is a lot better), I don't make it here as often as I like but when I'm in the area I still make an effort to go here."
"Jumbo wings. Delicious sauce. Reasonably priced. Good stuff!!It took us forever to find parking. If I had to do it again, I would definitely not drive. Was it worth it though? I definitely enjoyed the wings, and I had already had a full dinner before eating these wings and I still enjoyed them! So yes, it was worth it!We ordered two orders of Jumbo Wings, one in Crispy BBQ sauce and one in Seoul Sassy.  Crispy BBQ was my favorite of the two. The Seoul Sassy really did not have much flavor to me. I guess I should have eaten it first before moving on to the BBQ.Each order comes with five wings. So we had a total of 10 jumbo wings. Between the three of us, we had two wings left. Not too shabby considering that we did already have dinner at the Girl and the Goat ahead of time. Two great dinners in one night. You can't beat that!!Finger lickin' good!!!! There is not a lot of seating area here so try to get here early or take your food to go."
FANTASTIC fried chicken!!! The sauces are delicious and I definitely want to come back and try the other things on the menu (which I've heard are just as delicious).
"I was really looking forward to this place an their Korean fried kitchen after sampling Korean fried chicken IN Korea. Unfortunately the product doesn't travel well- I found it average at best, the ""Seoul sassy"" sauce was also marginal as was some ""atomic"" sauce.The Korean burrito was a joke. What's Korean about it other that the name, even IF you and their home made Korean hot sauce.The earning sign was the staff, they were enjoying tortilla chips and salsa from somewhere else- and they certainly were not o Korean origin.What's the buzz about this place? I will have to try again I guess, I have no idea. Next......."
"The first time ruined me and if I had written the review then, it would have definitely been 4.5 star everything was exactly what I had come to expect from reading the reviews. The chicken was crisp with just the right amount of sauce. Went with a group so we had three whole chickens with a couple different sauces and they were all great. Most importantly the whole chickens were exactly that whole chickens with all of the parts such as breasts, wings, thighs, and legs included. However on subsequent visits it has been very hit or miss. Sometimes the chicken is whole and the chicken is not crisp at all b/c they have decided to drown it in sauce. Ok so you would think by asking for light sauce the next time the almost all bone. There have been a couple of time in there were once again everything is right. So now it's more like 2.5 stars. My advice is to stick to the wings and just hope for the best.crisp problem would be solved, guess again. Other times it has been crisp but the whole chicken part came into question. We had three or four pieces that no one could quite figure out what they were and when asked they said it was a breast. Well I am going to guess it was a portion of the back b/c it was"
"Holy Crisp this place is good!It's the only korean chicken wing place that I have found in Chicago. All the flavors for the chicken wings are delicious and the bimbimbap is satiating. I've been here a few times with some friends, and I'm definitely coming back.The first time I went, I ordered the whole chicken with seoul sauce, which was delicious. The flavors were pungent, but the chicken meat itself wasn't juicy. It was actually a bit dry and overcooked (thus the 4 star review :/). The bimbimbap on the other hand was delicious. You can't really go wrong with bimbimbap! The second time I went, we ordered pretty much the same thing, but the chicken wings were definitely juicier. Maybe I got there on a bad day? Iono...Either way, this place totally screams a college hangout place. The seating is really tight in here, so be prepared to wait to find a table, and try not to bring a large amount of people."
the rice bowls were delicious!
Another reason why I would consider moving to Chicago! Huge wings with Huge flavor.....See ya my next visit!
"These are the best wings in the city. Jumbo, crispy and full of flavor. The different recipes/sauces do not overpower the natural cooked flavor of the chicken meat which is the catalyst of why the wings are so good. Forget the plain janes or buffalo and go straight for the Seoul sassy and BBQ because they are absolutely spectacular. There is cafeteria style seating but it's not spacious. The chicken is great with some rice but I wish they didn't charge for the Asian staple:/ Still, this chicken spot is a can't miss and you will not be sorry you gave this joint a shot. It's a just a tad pricey and I took a star away."
"I went here a few months ago been meaning to go back. Me and my friend went, he ordered one of the bowls it looked pretty good he enjoyed that i tried some it was good N tasty. I got the thai wings it was the seoul sassy ones, they were AMAZING!!! Best god damn wings ive had so far. The flavors were unique N it was a burst of goodness every bite. The staff were helpful in choosing what is the best sellers N such, i left full and happy. If you enjoy chicken wings this place is a must! No wing has come close to these for me. There other dishes sound great N interesting also, i definitely would recommend trying this place"
Huge Wings! Great bowls. Hard not to over-indulge at this place haha. Small dining area but the food is definitely worth it.
"we ordered the whole chicken, plain jane. my husband isn't a saucy type of guy. accompanying our KFC were fries and a burrito with korean beef. the burrito was forgettable. the flavor just didn't work for me. the chicken was hit and miss depending on the piece. some were dry and others were fairly moist. the fries were hot and crispy, but nothing special either.i think we should have ordered the wings. besides that, crisp is in a hip little area called lake view. by the time my husband and i finished dinner, all of the stores were closed. we would visit again to try the wings if we're ever in chicago."
"I am not at all a big fried chicken or wing fan, more of the take it or leave it persuasion.  But Crisp is in it's own league!  The favors here are amazing especially the Seoul Sassy."
"We'll here is my once every six month review lol. That's only cause it takes really good/bad experience to compel me to write a review. So let's go!These have to be thee best chicken wings I've ever had, seriously! Ordered the Plain Jane's and the Seoul Sassy. The Seoul Sassy's are so amazing. I only ordered the Plain Jane's because the wife wanted them and some places put too much sauce on their wings. But not this place, the wings were perfectly sauced. Although the Plain Jane's were also good, we both agreed, the Seoul Sassy is the way to go. Perfectly fried(so bad but so good) and the sauce didn't overwhelm the flavor of the perfectly seasoned meat. Also, these are jumbo wings people not some tiny bdub sized wings. So the order of five for one person is plenty. Like I said earlier, I rarely ever write a review, so if you're looking for some seriously great chicken wings, order from Crisp and get that Seoul Sassy!!!"
"The KFC (korean fried chicken) is outta this world.  Some of the best fried chicken ive ever had.  The beef burrito I got sucked though, thats why no 5 star review from me."
"Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. So delicious!"
"CHICKEN WINGS!!! delicious! sassy wings and bbq! they are huge too! 3 girls ate 15 gigantic wings..burrrpppp.buddha bibimbap was good as well. lots of veges, beef, and nicely done sunny side up egg.  add some kochujang and yum!!! huge portions as well.place gets packed very fast...but turnover rate is quick as well.walk across the street to bobtail ice cream for desserts...cute neighborhood to walk around too"
Seoul Sassy - YES! 100x YES!Original - Meh.
"I had the half chicken with sassy sauce.  It was decent.  The flavors were quite tasty, but some of the pieces of chicken were fried too crisp that they weren't too edible.  My girlfriend got the chicken fingers with their BBQ sauce.  These were much better.The space is small, so be prepared to wait for seating to open up.  Maybe even go during non-peak times.All and all a decent spot.  However, there are other places I would go to before coming back here."
"Restaurant: CrispCuisine: KoreanLocation: Lake View (Chicago)Address: 2940 N Broadway StPrice Range: $10~151: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: ExcellentFood: 4 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3Overall: 3.5Have you ever heard of KFC? No, I am not talking about Kentucky Fried Chicken. If you follow Toronto food scene, or any food scene around the world right now- KFC means Korean Fried Chicken. It all started in New York when Bon Chon made it's way to Manhattan. People were getting tired of regular deep fried chicken (which I still love) and wanted something different.And then KFC came along, with their soy sauce marinade that's sweet and tangy or spicy sauce with a kick. KFC trend is going far that you can randomly find it at hipster tapas place that is not Korean restaurant.Crisp is def one of the spin off from the KFC trend in America, they are known for deep fried chicken called Seoul Sassy and people from Chicago were all over it! I knew I had to give it a try. Crisp is a small place with as many seats crammed in as possible. By the time I went, all the tables were full except the side tables. Since we were there for a quick bite, it didn't really matter and we just took the side seats. Also, it was a second stop after my first meal- my friend and I were already so full. We just ordered Seoul Sassy Half chicken for $8.95. Seoul Sassy is a 'subtly sweet sauce prepared with ginger, soy, garlic and spices'. Chicken takes awhile because it's made when you order. I think we waited good 20 minutes for it to come out, but it was worth it at the end.Their chicken is deep fried with very thin batter but it comes out super crispy. Then it is covered in sauce as it is cooked again so the batter soaks up most of the goodness so that most of it ends up in your mouth, not your hands! Chicken was fresh and the meat was so juicy bursting with flavor. It was a little on the salty side, just to be eaten on it's own. The sauce had really strong garlic flavor and it was topped with green onions as well. Def not a food to eat on a date. Summary: Overall it was a good KFC, I just wish I had room to try other things off the menu like their Buddha Bowl which is basically a BiBimBab but with variety of vegetables you can choose from. If you love KFC, Crisp is def worth trying."
"I have had more than my fair share of chicken tenders in my life, but i have never had a chicken tender as amazing as the ones i just consumed from crisp.  If I could only have my chicken prepared one way for the rest of my life they would all be seoul sassy chicken tenders from crisp- i seriously cannot get enough!"
"small tiny place.Food is quickcrisp bbq-good kinda spicy seoul sassy-asian flavored wings goodsmall buddha bowl-goodLarge fries-not good & huge!Wings are huge!The three of us shared 5 bbq, 5 seoul, and small buddha and large friesStill had leftovers!"
"Not the ultimate or most authentic Korean fried chicken, but very tasty chicken in the no(low?) batter, Korean style. The spicy sauces are tasty, but not spicy enough imo.Small, loud and crowded place, with community-style picnic tables that make me rejoice for take-out (and they're pretty fast with this)."
Not good but GREAT! They deliver! A masterful hangover food so you only have to answer the door. I really like this place and they do chicken right.  Casual atmosphere.
"Well, I for one buy into all the hype, and I didn't even get near the fried chicken. Must be what makes the place smell so pungently aromatic, when you first walk in.I love these new semi-fast food, quick counter Korean fusion places as an alternative to the sit-down Korean joints, even when the word ""belly"" is in the name. Food is fresh and creative. Service fast and enthusiastic, and It's real low-cost healthy fare. And fusion choices such as Korean Burritos (offered here) and tacos and hot dogs in some other spots.We came here on a week night, a couple roomies and me, in a famished state. We all took advantage of the various Buddha Bowls. Audrey got a side of Korean veggies. I bought a side of Kim Chee for the table. Our little bellies quickly became bigger Buddha bellies by the time we left. With big sighs and an ""I can't believe we ate the whole thing"" consensus, we were only around $13 poorer, and we got more than our daily minimum of good fresh food. The Kim Chee, which I believe is one of the world's best appetizers, as well as a side, was the best I've had in awhile. Since this place is smack in the middle of my weekly stomping grounds, I can see getting Kim Chee for takeout ($3.95) on a regular basis. I like the casual and minimal space as well as the large common picnic tables where you can sprawl out and eat comfortably. And I don't even mind bussing my own table. I'll be back for the chicken, Chicken Hawk that I am."
OMG! I am in LOVE. Me and my bf (pretty big eater) shared 10 wings and we didn't even finish! They are huge! We got half Seoul Sassy and BBQ. I preferred the Seoul Sassy. It's so tasty!! I can't wait to go back and try the bowls and other awesome stuff they have on their menu. So excited!
"Korean Fried Chicken, the New K.F.C.  !!!!The EAT LIST:Sassy Seoul Fried Chicken  (Our absolute fave, that keeps us coming back)Crisp BBQ Fried Chicken  (Rocks on, Delicious)Marty's Magic Mushrooms  (ok)O-Rings  (nicely done)Been back 5 times with friends and family cause this place has the tastiest, freshest, Korean Fried Chicken. Our number one choice is the Sassy Soul Chicken, it's sweet garlicky and savory at the same time. We also like the Buddha Sauce on the table, really unique and complex. Goes great with the fries and mushrooms. We normally get a whole fried chicken and leave the bones behind!The Crisp BBQ is very tasty too and has you sitting around going , ""Wow, how did they make this?""And for you Onion Ring Lovers out there, don't pass on the O-Rings. The O-Rings are simple but they do it just right. Thick rings, good crunchy batter, just done right.TIP:Look for their whole chicken special, it's really worth it.The two small sides included are huge. Also, you can get the whole chicken in two different styles.DECOR:Picnic tables. Like a BBQ joint. Relaxed and comfortable.SERVICE:It's a walk up to a counter and order joint. The workers at the counter have always been cool and professional on all our visits and take the the time the explain the menu for the newbies.Great place  to get that Korean Fried Chicken fix!"
"Atmosphere: Fun, open, casual, well lit, benches- 4 starsService: Nice and informative- 4 starsFood: Full Chicken with specialty sauce- 4 starsRice/veggie bowl- 4 starsConclusion: Damn delicious!  The bowl complimented the chicken very well and I left feeling stuffed! Will be returning =)4 StArS!"
OMG the wings were 2 die 4!!!
"So I called in an order for delivery - 6 spicy buffalo chicken tenders and the bulgogi bowl.  After I hung up the phone, I picked up a few things around my apartment, cleaned a little and was just ready to sit down when my buzzer rang.  Who the??  The food was delivered in 15 minutes - I kid you not!!  I don't even live super close.  I'm about a mile away.  Jimmy John's delivery has got nothin' on Crisp!Some of the chicken tenders were smaller than the others, so they threw in a few extra pieces.  Nice!  I actually considered ordering them dry with the sauce on the side because I figured the sauce-soaked chicken tenders wouldn't travel well.  The ones I got weren't too soggy and some of them were still actually crispy.  I think I will get them dry/sauce on the side next time because if they could still be crispy with the sauce, I can only imagine how crispy they would be without!The bulgogi bowl was huge!  The beef was so good and tender.  The color of the atomic sauce they sent kinda scared me a little, but I thought I'd give it a shot.  Delish!  I don't know what was it but I couldn't get enough of it!  The bulgogi was great on it's own, but the atomic sauce added an awesome flavor.This is now in my top five delivery places.  It is a little pricey, but not when you consider the portion sizes.  Definitely added to my delivery rotation."
"My brother took us here and did the ordering, so I'm not 100% sure what we got, but all of the wings were SO YUMMY. We had some plain ones, and some I think Seoul Sassy. I could've stayed there eating those all day long. The wings are where it's at. We also got onion rings and mushrooms, which were good. I usually don't eat mushrooms, but happily popped a few of those. There were rolls of paper towels on the tables, but I would've liked something a bit more absorbent. And, it would've been nice if they gave out some of those wet towelette things, so we could clean up a bit at the end of the meal and not have to walk back to the restroom, like I did, holding my hands up like I was surrendering to something (the food?)"
Not much to say here.. Korean BBQ Wings. That's it. don't even bother with anything else there.. this is what you will want to eat and then die happy. Order 15..what the heck. not like you're going to want to eat anything else for the next day or so.
"Crisp chicken?  I die.  I have never had better chicken.  Never.  I had put off going to Crisp because I don't even like fried chicken.  But, somehow, when you slather it in tangy Korean sauces, I can't get enough of it. We ordered the whole fried chicken meal with o-rings and kimchi on the side. And then added on a steak bowl.  Tremendous! The kimchi was tangy and spicy but I ate a small enough portion so as not to burn my mouth off.   The chopped bulgolgi had the perfect balance of sweet and salty and worked nicely with the sticky rice.  I was nervous that we were going to be low on food for four people. That was silly.  Not only did we all stuff our faces, but there were leftovers.   I had some chicken cold this morning for breakfast and it was still drool worthy.  If I lived near here I am pretty sure we would eat here once a week.  Instead, I will just have to come up with excuses to frequently pass through Lakeview."
Portions are massive and comunal seating is a friendly touch! The large fries could easily be shared by 4 ppl. We also git the chicken burrito and not so commom sandwich.  I would definetly stop by again.
"One of the best places I've eaten in Chicago this trip.We got the 10 whole piece wings with the Seoul sassy sauce and the crisp BBQ sauce and a baby Buddha bowl.The wings were crispy, the crispest I've ever had and I'm from Texas. They weren't overly sauced which is great, so they didn't get super soggy from sitting in the basket. The tastes were sweet and the crisp bqq had a bit of a kick to it, but not super spicy.The Buddha bowl was your regular run of the mill bibimbap, the rice was a little clumpy for my liking. I also got the beef added to it, and it was actually good. Overall good eats, but not a WOW factor. Service was friendly and it's a cool atmosphere. I will be craving the Seoul sassy sauce when I go back to Texas!"
"Great fried chicken that is perfectly crisped. Not much seating, which may mean sharing a table with a Lakeview hipster dragging an e-cigarette."
We have been here twice. Crisp is amazing. They have a chicken special for $19.99 that we are dying to try. The wings are huge and fabulous. The seating is family style with lots of paper towels and seasonings on the table. I am hungry just thinking about my experience here again!
"I just don't know how to write a fair review for a place that is famous for it's chicken wings while I am vegetarian. I guess this review will just be just as a reference for other vegetarians, because clearly, their specialty dishes do seem to live up to their expectations, given the number and quality of their other reviews. I am happy that they had the vegetarian bi bim bop options for those of us who are not about to try their best dish. The quantities here are huge and even the Baby Buddha Bowl can be shared by two! The music was sort of loud and the conversation was hard to make. The guys behind the counter were friendly but overwhelmed. And we went in the time between lunch and dinner, so not particularly their busiest in the day. I would highly recommend everyone to do take-out instead of dine-in because it can get a little chaotic, loud and hard to keep up with in a sane fashion!"
"The first time I ate here a few years back, myself and everyone I was with ordered one of the bowls. Not the way to go. They were good, but if you want something worth writing about, get the wings!Now if you're like me and avoid wings because they require too much effort for so little reward, these might just change your mind. Crisp wings are huge, meaty, juicy, saucy, and delicious--a meal on their own. But don't go in expecting chicken with a thick, battered covering or you're gonna have a bad time--that's not how they do it here. The wings are still crispy, but you're not gonna be filling up on fried batter because of it. And if heat's not your thing when it comes to sauces, you can't go wrong with the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ.  This isn't food anybody needs to see me eat in public, so I don't care for the communal style seating, but at least there's spots facing the wall and front window. I've only been there on Saturday afternoons, but beware--the place is PACKED at that time and business is steady."
"Since I just wrote a bad review for Harold's Chicken Shack, I figured I'd write a review for an awesome fried chicken place to even things out. Went here the other day based on the recommendation of one of my friends. I hadn't heard of Crisp before, it is a Korean fried chicken place in Lakeview off Broadway. I don't know too much about Korea, except that it's in Asia, there is a North and South, and Dennis Rodman is friends with one of the leaders. But a new fact I know now about Korea is they make some damn good fried chicken.There are a couple of tables to sit down at, but this is mostly a to-go type place. No need to call ahead as they'll have your order done in about 5 minutes. I ordered the crisp bbq half chicken. It was amazing. The sauce has a little kick to it, but nothing too spicy. The chicken was meaty and moist. I definitely will be going back to try some of the other flavors, along with their Plain Jane.  In fact, I'll probably go after work today, since I'm craving it again after writing this."
"Me and chicken are like this.  You can't see it but my fingers are crossed right now.  If I didn't know any better I'd say I'm genetically predisposed to like chicken.  I truly believe that if chickens had a choice of where they'd be served, they'd all make their way to Crisp.  It's that good.  My first experience here led to me to the Chi town Chicken Korean burrito.  An Asian spin on a Mexican classic sounds taboo but they somehow found a way to make it work.  On top of that they have these two homemade sauces, one spicy, one savory, they keep on the table that are the icing on the cake. The next time I had the wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce.   Like others have said, some of the best fried chicken you've ever had.  Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and slightly addictive.  You've been warned."
"What can I say about Crisp that hasn't already been said? This place absolutely lives up to its hype. The fried chicken is legit and quite possibly the best wings I have ever had. I'm particularly obsessed with the perfectly crispy and oh-so-flavorful Seoul Sassy wings (who isn't?).I hadn't been back to Crisp since my first time there a couple months ago, but definitely not for lack of wanting! I'd been craving it for weeks now; the only issue is that it's out of my way and going through the inconvenience of getting there just for some wings kinda makes me feel like a fatass. BUT, I finally gave in and went back there today, and OH MAN. I'm so glad I did. The wings were every bit as delicious as I had remembered. I also ordered the (generously-portioned) Baby Buddha Bowl to justify the $16 I had just spent on a cab ride there (and the $16 to get back afterwards). I plan on having that later for dinner tonight, and if the wings are any indication of how good the rest of the food at Crisp is, I cannot wait. Run - don't walk - to Crisp. This place is as good as it gets."
Great wings! The Seoul sassy is the best. The other items on the menu aren't great but the wings are 5 star worthy.
"When I first walked in and looked at the menu I was like what is this Half Chicken? I was thinking maybe I should go with whole. Don't do it they literally mean a whole chicken. Well do it if you want to split it with someone. After getting over that shock, I was in shock with how amazing the food was. I haven't had there bowls yet but as a first time visitor I highly recommend the fried chicken. You won't regret it and you'll definitely want to come back again and again.Be mindful that this place is small and can get pretty packed. A good place to do a grab and go and have a picnic by the lake. Also community style seating so be mindful of other patrons and don't place your bags beside you taking up valuable seating."
"Just amazing, seating is limited, but go there!!!"
"had the traditional wings, but honestly the boneless looked way better, and tasted better too, also got the steak burrito which was pretty good"
Delicious chicken wings! This is among the best places in Chicago for Asian inspired wings.
"Had Crisp for the first time tonight. The wings are freakishly huge but taste amazing. We got 10 of the BBQ wings and that was more than enough for my wife, daughter and I. The sauce was sweet with just the right amount of heat. Service was fast, friendly and helpful. Definitely a place to add to our list of favorites."
This place is always packed for a reason. It took me too long to eat here as I would walk by and constantly see satisfied looking people sitting in their store chowing down. My usual is the Foodie Sandwich. Its a fried chicken sandwich with cheese bacon and a ton of other stuff. Really satisfying. I have yet to try the Buddha bowl and I hear I'm missing out.
"Due to all the hype my friend suggestied this place for dinner and I loveeee chicken wings so I couldn't resist especially with all these rave reviews! There were 4 of us and Tamia and we decided to order all together of 1 Big Buddha Bowl, 10 Seoul Sassy wings, 10 Crisp BBQ, 1 Original Buddha Bowl, and Cabbage Kimchee.I really enjoy the Seoul Sassy wings - crispy and just the right touch of flavor, extremely delicious. The 10 Crisp BBQ was good too, but a bit too much sauce, but I still devoured it. The Big Buddha Bowl had a good mixture of vegetables, but I wish there was more rice. I'm a rice and chicken kind of girl, but maybe next time I'll just order rice only, but I like eating vegetables too -- so I'm kind of in a dilemma. Our kimchee came out very late - right as we were all just about done eating and it's only a side order. (We had order it separately  because I didn't realize they had kimchee.) The kimchee was alright, definitely not as good as traditional Korean restaurants. My 2 cousins and our friend also enjoyed the wings and even Tamia enjoyed it. By the end we were all licking our fingers. When we were leaving we also ran into one of the Co-Owners of Crisp and he was very nice, taking his time to talk to us and explain his concept of delivering the best wings in town! *thumbs up*I've officially been Crisp."
Amazingness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Amazing portionsAmazing chicken Amazing table sauceAmazing friesThis Korean fried chicken joint is as good as it gets in Chicago. Go here!!!! Crisp won't let u down. promise.
damn son where'dd ya find this!? aha!!!!!!!!!! this place is so dank!!!!!!!!! dam this is the dopest wings of all dam timeeeeee?!?!?!!
"Holy Giant Wings Batman!I seriously love Crisp.  My arteries likely hate it.  Such is life.My wife and I paid Crisp a visit, not really knowing what we were in for.  As a result, we ordered way to much food.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed every single bite.  The wings ware simply outstanding.  Keep in mind that each wing is equivalent to two large wings anywhere else because they keep the drumstick and ""wing"" portion in tact (10 wings = 20 typical wings).  They are wonderfully fried and come with your choice of sauce.  I would definitely recommend the Seoul Sassy.  We also tried the burritos, which were also outstanding.  I can't wait to return!"
"Crisp has the BEST chicken wings ever!  They're loaded with meat and the sauces are so tasty (although not really authentic Korean).  Service is also great!  I once showed up right before they were closing so the owner threw in a few ""extras"" so I could try some other menu items.  If only Crisp wasn't located in such a busy area, I'd swing by more often to pick up a quick dinner.  Parking is tough and several times I've circled the neighborhood, only to leave frustrated when I couldn't find a parking spot within a few block radius.  Definitely check out Crisp for meaty, juicy and tasty wings!"
"What can I say about Crisp that hasn't already - it is truly sensational. Some of the best fried chicken I have found anywhere in the country, if you are willing to give Korean style a shot. The entire menu is diverse and has options for everyone (fried and otherwise), though I typically stick to the chicken options. Great sandwiches and any chicken (whole, wings, or strips) with Seoul Sassy or Spicy Crisp BBQ is bound to be delicious. Healthier options like rice bowls, korean burritos, and kimchi with chicken are solid too."
"I first discovered Crisp on TimeOut Chicago's Best Restaurants edition. As a foodie from California, I knew I had to try their chicken as the picture looked absolutely scrumptious. I was only in Chicago for a few days but I made it my mission to try out their chicken wings before I left. We ordered half Seoul Sassy and half BBQ. I tried the Seoul Sassy and was blown away by how delicious it really was. It was crispy and full of flavor. The ""Awesome"" sauce was a great compliment. The BBQ was also good, but it was a little too rich and sweet for me. If I go back to Chicago, I know which eatery i'll be hitting up first!"
"Awesome chicken, friendly staff, and a cool environment - definitely going back. Seating is sometimes hard to find during normal lunch and dinner hours. They need to expand!"
"Best. chicken. ever.We've ate in and ordered delivery. The staff are friendly, the take out was unbelievably fast, and you must order the side dishes and kimchi with the chicken. Do it."
"It takes all my strength to walk past Crisp every time I walk to the gym. But every time I'm reunited with the Foodies Crisp chicken sandwich with their Sassy Sauce, I remember why it's so hard to stay away!Yes, it is a small place and seating can get cramped. Yes, you should take a menu with you and call in maybe 15 minutes ahead so your wait is shorter. No, don't take up a seat before you get your food don't be rude. And yes, hit up Binny's and BYOB just don't linger if it's packed. All in all, their wings are big, their Sassy Sauce is sweet and tangy. The rice is sticky and goes great with their Steak Bowl. Their Atomic Sauce is spicy but not enough where I get a runny nose. Ok maybe just a little. I hope the quality stays consistent!"
"Love. This. Place. My favorite wings in Chicago. You can't go wrong with any selection. However, I do think I like the Crisp BBQ best. Though, Seoul Sassy is fantastic too. If these guys were in Logan Square I'd be in trouble. As it stands they're my longstanding place for a tasty meal if I find myself in Lakeview. Yum!"
"good portion sizes and reasonably priced. i got a whole chicken to share between two people, half seoul sassy, half crisp bbq. both were really good and the crisp bbq has a little kick to it.the only problem is there isn't enough seating, especially when it gets really busy."
"The foodie's choice chicken sandvich was great. I am sure the rest of their menu is amazing. Really the key is how they fry the chicken, just like the name suggests, crispy. all the ingredients were really good! Also the cashiers and food preparers were great they didn't seem at all like they hate their job which is a nice change. I would say try it out for sure!"
"Crisp is fantastic.  They always have people hanging out the doorway for a reason.  Giant chicken wings perfectly fried and doused in delicious sauces.  I recommend the spicy buffalo sauce, if you like a little heat with your wings, if you don't the seoul sassy is the way to go.They also serve buddha bowls, which are meat and steamed veggies over rice, if you are anti-wing and still forced to go to Crisp.  They do fry the whole chicken though, and if you are going there with people, the whole chicken and two side meal is a good deal.  Don't skip on Crisp, the wings will amaze you.  It does get busy, but every excellent restaurant should. The seating is bench style, so if you don't like the possibility of having to eat next to strangers, you might want to consider take-out."
"It's making a come back.  K.F.C....Korean Fried Chicken!!As a young one, I used to look forward to family parties for the Korean wings.  I would gladly trample over my  cousins to the the first to crunch into those sweet, spicy, crunchy poultry treats!  Shameless, I know.The wings at Crisp must be on steroids, because they're about double the size I remember for my childhood.  In this case, more is definitely better.  I shared a half order of the Seoul Sassy wings ($8.95) with Julie R.  All manners aside, they were finger-lickin' good!  The sauce was sweet, garlicky, gingery-all in subtle amounts but combined to form a super sauce.  I even poured some of it on the Baby Buddha ($6.95) I ordered.  I'm a condiment girl.  I'm saucy."
"I finally got to try this place and it's delicious! I got the Seoul Steak bowl and it was sooo good! And I tried a bite of the Seoul Sassy wings - I wanted to steal the rest of my friend's order! We did take out because the place is so tiny and it was so crowded, we couldn't find a seat, but still totally worth the trek in the snow. I wish they had more locations so I didn't have to only have it when I'm in the city!"
"Well, I'd memorized all 1100+ Yelp reviews going into this joint for the 1st time so expectations were bulging at the seams.  Went fairly early on a Sat evening (around 5:30pm) and it wasn't busy at all.  But that changed over the span of the next hour when every multi-ethnic-hipster-bike-messenger descended upon the space jonsing for K-food with their PBR-fueled-breath breathing down my neck & practically demanding my spot at the picnic table.  Tensions were high by the time I left.  Not a good way to eat but do they eat like this in (North) Korea?  The specter of  North Korea looms not only on the nuclear front but also the food front.Let me first say that I hate communal dining tables.  ""Pass the napkin roll"" is not something I care to enter my vocabulary when said to total strangers.  Luckily, the hipsters hadn't showed up yet.  I thought I was done with communal dining when I left college.  And adding to the madness, if seated by the edge of the table, stage left, you'll soon be mouth-to-crotch level with the nearby queue.  Whomever designed the layout should be sent back to North Korea!  Ah, but how's the food?  Rather unspectacular?!?!?!  Had the Seoul-Sassy half-chicken and fries.  The bird came out hot and sweaty, just the way I love my birds (hello, England;).  Let start dissecting this Korean fried chicken.  It's not quite Popeyes but it does have a nice crunch.  But flavor-wise, it fell short.  It was slightly sweet and salty but both flavor-profiles seemed to cancel each other out to blend into sort of a bland middle-ground.  When I hit the white meat pieces, the writing was on the bird.On to the fries.  Meh, is all I can say.  Thin and crispy, which I prefer to the overcooked skin-on things most places serve (they can't be arsed to fry the damn things twice, like they should be).  But like the chicken, inexplicably bland.  Poured some of the mystery sauce over them and it still didn't save the day. So, lesson learned.  Don't believe the hype of this place.  It's madness to dine-in for bland food."
"Best wings in chicago!  not joking.  when i first came to this place i heard about it through word of mouth, but wow was i floored.  it lives up to the hype.  every chicken place i go to i think, it's not as good as crisp.  the food, the quantity, and the price.  forget about it!  yeah that's right, from new york, and i've had some of the best wings from coast to coast, and frankly, these are my favorite!. the fact that they're korean based doesn't hurt either."
"Honestly it was just ok! I was so excited to go based on all the great reviews and I was disappointed. It was not bad but definitely not on the top 10 list! Perhaps it was because I ordered the regular chicken with no sauce and it was a little dry, I tried the sauce on the side and it was good but very sweet.  All in all just OK."
"Walking into Crisp brings back happy  memories of eating spicy fried chicken at a dive restaurant in Seoul. It was called yang num chicken, and it was awesome. The U.S. version of it in LA and NYC is decent, but Crisp knocks it out of the park. I go for the Crisp BBQ sauce every time, and you can ask for extra spicy. You'd better mean it - it's no kidding spicy. The magic mushrooms are fab because of the Atomic sauce. You can buy a jar of Atomic sauce, but it's so good you might find yourself putting it on everything.  Buy the big jar.The Buddha bowls are delicious, and the chicken strips are just as tasty as the wings/whole chicken. It's all delicious. Just stop reading and go get some!"
"This place was listed in an article I came across on Yahoo listing the Top 5 Wing places in Chicago. I have came here numerous times before this article, so I am not writing my review solely because of that article. The wings here are amazing! The Seoul Sassy is my favorite and the Crisp BBQ is a close second. The wings can get spicy, but I recommend getting both the Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ because it is a perfect mixture and they complement each other perfectly. The Seoul Steak Bowl with the Atomic sauce is a must try. I honestly think the sauce is what makes it so yummy though. I would definitely come back here in the future."
"It's a small restaurant that serves the original korean style fried chicken (whole birds) along with BiBimbop (Buddha Bowl) and Burritos.  When you walk in, there's a set of menu to your left, review it and know what you want so you don't hold up the line, especially if you are a first timer.Ordered the whole chicken with 1/2 Sassy Seoul and the other 1/2 with Crisp BBQ along with Onion Rings.  Once you order, you pay and they will call your name when the food is ready, yes, it's a self service.  The food comes out within 10 minutes, unless it's busy... when we got there, it wasn't that busy, maybe around 8 people.... Seoul Sassy - this is probably the best sauce... it's little sweet and works well with the chicken. Crisp BBQ - it's bit on the salty side... so if you don't like food on the salty side, stick with Seoul Sassy.  Onion Rings - it was crispy and good.. in my humble opinion, most likely it's not made in-house.If you use Yelp, then make sure you check in prior to ordering, as they usually offer specials... for example on the day I went, they offered whole chicken, two sides and two drinks for $20.... I paid $22 for my order, so make sure you check-in on Yelp first."
"This place is delicious!Our first experience at Crisp was a very small meal but we'll be back to try more for sure.  We ordered 5 wings, fries and a drink all to share.  The portions are great - the chicken wings are a great size (they come with the drum and the wing so it's really like getting 10 wings from any other place I've been to).  The wings were so juicy and the sauce is out of this world - we had the Seoul Sassy sauce.The fries were good, but standard.  I wonder if they have something like the kimchee fries from Del Seoul but I didn't see them on the menu, probably should have asked.  If they don't have something like that it would be a great addition to the menu!"
"High expectations, only to fall...Crisp.Due to others reviews by respected ""Yelpers"", I decided after church today to give Crisp a try. Excited, I got to the restaurant where the decor was plain, very green, yet inviting. Large tables with side stools & high tables made up the setting space. I order the Seoul Steak Bowl with brown rice. I should have gotten to get the Chicken bowl, but thought it would still be okay due to the Seoul Sassy sauce on the beef as well. WRONG. The meal in front of me was rice with shredded beef on top, simply. I was not happy and still hungry after six of so not great mouth fulls. I then ordered the recommend (per yelp reviews) Seoul Sassy chicken wings. The two stars is only do the this: very crisp breaded chicken with juicy, tender meat. Tasty with a good presentation. Yet, the sauce just OK; nothing great. They made up for the bowl somewhat with the Seoul Sassy chicken wingsMy disappointment (and lost of one star) came mainly from the customer service. Even though I let them know that I was not happy with the bowl, nothing was done to make sure I left a happy customer.  When I ordered a second dish (wings), I was asked about the bowl, which I told him I did not like. He responded by telling me I was the first person he knew that did not like the dish. Really? In addition, no refund for the bowl or discount on the wings was offered . Crisp, you are the first restaurant I KNOW that did not offer a refund or a replace order when the customer informed you they did not like it. Maybe there is a no refund sign somewhere...this was my thoughts on the ride home to give them the benefit of the doubt.  In addition, please check on your restrooms for cleanliness every hour or so. The ladies room was not kept well today.Overall, I will not be back and I feel they will not care. I threw away the bowl at the store (I felt bad about this) and plan to give my last two wings to a coworker tomorrow (so at least that is not wasted). I guess this is what I get for wanting something different."
"Delicious wings! Half sassy half sweet. Cozy place. Family style seating. Don't go if you're claustrophobic. Tight seating, but you may meet someone!"
"love love love.Don't listen to Richard C. below. Chicken has always been the cheaper protein so why hatin?Going to Korea and eating their fried chicken has always been a pastime of mine. Little did I know that I would be experiencing the same emotions at Crisp in Chicago. Our group got there and devoured the chicken/kimchi/kaktuki in less than 15 minutes. Then we just sat. Sat and enjoyed all those chicken bits floatin' in our tummies. Because you know, that's how ballers roll.The best part, they had MILKIS. MILKIS, GUISE. MILKIS. What better way to wash down your food with Korea's best cream soda?!Crisp, I will be back."
I had the Korean wings with BBQ sweet sauce - oh my!  So very very tasty.  I loved the crispness of the chicken. I had a side of brown rice with it (which was enough rice for three people!)
"My cheap eats team hit Crisp last night; for $8, I left full!  That's because the Chi-Town Chicken rice bowl was large, full of meat (not typical when I get rice bowls at other spots), and with Allison's sauce all over it, this bowl was solid.  Didn't love the fact that the cold water dispenser dispenses lukewarm and not ice-cold water, and it's a little tight inside of Crisp during the dinner hour.  Otherwise I will definitely be back; my wife did one of the Buddha bowls and added steak and she is more in the ""3"" category than the ""4"" category."
"This was my pick for Supper Club and I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  Luckily we have some stealthy friends who got there early and saved all window seats for our group otherwise we would be standing and eating and hovering.  This place gets crowded.  We started with a big ol' basket of fries for everyone and husband and I split five of the Seoul Sassy wings.  These are giant honkin' wings, I know they are $9.  If you want tiny pieces of meat on tiny pieces of bone, I'm sure BWWs will be happy to serve you.  These are giant and crispy and saucy and messy.  Don't bring a date you want to impress... go with friends you have seen you at your worst and gnaw away.I got the Bad Boy Buddha bowl and I SWEAR I asked for Bulgogi on top and I SWEAR I paid for it but my dumbass threw the receipt out after I picked it up and by the time I made my way through the crowd and back to the seat, the thought of going back up there and fighting my fight sans receipt was just too much.  The bowl was delicious on it's own and another ""eat a third for three separate meals"" type size.  Yummy veggies.I wish I lived closer so I didn't have to try to park in this area, I'd be here all the goddamn time."
"Dank wings, big portions, reasonably priced. Dude at the counter was friendly and informative. Had to take some togo."
The hype of yelpers lead me to try the Seoul Sassy Jumbo wings and Bbq wings. I wanted to like the food however it didn't stand up to the hype!   Also to mention it was overly price. I was disappointed.   It needed better seasonings/taste through out the chicken.  Though in comparison the Bbq was better than Seoul Sassy wings.I won't be back:(
"This is what Korean comfort food is all about!  This was, hands down, the best meal I've eaten in a long time.My fab friend and I split our dishes.  The korean fried chicken was everything I wanted it to be: juicy, meaty, crispy, crunchy, and piping hot!  The seoul sassy sauce was sweet and mild, and I am definitely drooling as I type.The bulgogi rice bowl was comforting.  The meat was sweet and juicy, and the steamed rice was hot, fluffy, and filling. Glad I found this find on Yelp!  Not a huge fan of the communal tables a la Urban Belly, but I can't wait to come back."
"Crisp loses in size wars with Dak, but I prefer it for a number of reasons: taste, LevelUp (free $3 to start even though the LevelUp machine was down when I ordered), location, and menu choices.I liked the taste of these medium-sized wings.  They aren't the cheapest, but it's a far cry from being considered expensive.  You get four choices of sauce, and I chose the most popular two, which also had asterisks next to them on the menu.  They even let me split my mini-order of 5 wings into two sauce choices.I'll have to revisit to use my LevelUp credit and explore more of the menu for sure!"
I really like the wings here...I ordered the Crisp BBQ and Seoul Sassy.  They are huge wings and the flavors were delicious!  I wasn't a fan of their bibimbap (Baby Buddha).
"I had high expectations of this place due to the reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it as much as I had expected.I got the Bad Boy Buddha Bowl with Beef. It was o.k... nothing special. It was cold and there was not much flavor, even with the beef.My fiance got the Seoul Sassy and the Spicy Buds Buffalo. He said they were o.k. and nothing special.This place was really hoppin though. The line was always long and people were flying in and out of the place. Good busy atmosphere."
"I rave about this place non-stop. It's a must when I'm in Chicago and I've convinced half a dozen friends/family to try it when they visited Chi-town. The general consensus: the chicken is AMAZING, fried mushrooms are delish, and we need the recipe for that wonderful orange dipping sauce."
"Crisp is my favorite place to go for wings in Chicago.  The Seoul Sassy wings are amazing and they are huge!  As if that weren't good enough, they're also BYOB.  It's communal seating, and the tables are picnic style. Haven't had a problem finding a seat yet, even though it's always busy. Great service and one of the many perks about Chicago!"
"Seoul sassy is amazing, highly recommend it. Delivery only took about 30 minutes and the price is very reasonable for how much food you get."
"I don't think there is anything new I can add to the over 1,000 review for Crisp, I can only further confirm that it is, indeed, freaking amazing fried chicken! Do yourself a favor and order the Seoul Sassy whole jumbo wings...they are amazing! I also tried the medium buffalo sauce on some chicken tenders and that was pretty amazing as well. The frites (fries) may be skinny and simple but they're crispy and the perfect salty potato complement to their very flavorful chicken. Make sure to try the Atomic sauce...it's pretty freaking amazing too! LOVE Crisp!"
"Delicious fried chicken.  My girlfriend and I stopped by before going to the nail salon and couldn't believe how good the chicken was.  It's a little hole in the wall with bench seating but it was packed on a saturday afternoon, so we tried it out.  Worth it for sure!"
One of the best chicken sandwiches in the city...Go early cause this little place gets really busy!!
"Believe me when I say I was skeptical on how good Crisp Korean chicken would be when I didn't see an Asian face in the small eatery.  We decided to give it a go anyway.  We were starved after watching the Cubs beat the Cardinals on an afternoon game during some time in August.  I have second thoughts about watching that game now because, being the center of the world and all, I think we gave the Cardinals some much needed JUJU.  Yeah the Cubs won that day, but we made the Cardinals win the big one.  ;-PCrisp had a $19.99 Whole Chicken Meal deal available and also in the Yelp check-in offers.  Great deal!  Worth every penny.  You can split your order with the different chicken flavors, which was great since it allowed us to try different things.  I don't quite remember which chicken flavors we had since it was some time ago, but it was good.  Everything was good, kimchi and all.  After awhile, I noticed an Asian man lurking behind the kitchen.  Woohoo!  I'm just saying...  Even without the legit creds for the place I still enjoyed Crisp thoroughly.  The place has amazing Korean chicken.  It's a little pricey but the chicken is great.  But most Korean chicken eateries are usually pricey from what I've experienced:  from an old friends Korean chicken place in Oakland to the Korean chicken joints in SoCal.  But, still, nothing beats the joints in Seoul.Crisp is now our unofficial go to place before and/or after a Cubs game (especially against the Giants).  I got a feeling I'll be trying to go to Chi-town a lot since the maestro Theo is in town now.  The series should be quite exciting next summer.  Go Giants!  Go Crisp Korean chicken!  And, why not, Go Cubbies!"
"I can't get enough of this place. I want them to franchise and go nationwide. If you are reading this Crisp, contact me I'll try to put you in touch with business people to make this happen!Whenever I need to go to a party and bring food, I stop into Crisp and pick up the whole chicken special, with Seoul Sassy and BBQ sauce, and fries and o-rings, it is rockstar and everyone begs for more and it is gone in like 5 minutes at the party. When I eat in, it is the Seoul Steak bowl all the way -- the Atomic sauce is amazing. The helping is huge. They will do it with brown rice. The boneless chicken strips are also amazing if you don't feel like getting messy. I want them to be open til 4am so late at night I can empty my wallet there. Please expand! If you need space you can use my kitchen, if you give me Seoul Sassy stuff every day!If I could give them 6 stars I would. This is my favorite place in Lakeview."
"Best god damn wings in Chicago! The Seoul Sassy wings are amazing but I actually the BBQ wings better. Also, these things are huge. They have to pumping these babies full of the same stuff they gave Bruce Banner LOL. Crisp will not disappoint any wing aficionado."
"Nice spot for some Asian fried chicken.  The chicken was pretty tasty and its got a bit of a fast food feel, in a good way. BYOB, which is always a plus in my book. My friend and I were pretty focused on the chicken items on the menu, but the bowls looks pretty tasty.  The setting arrangement made it necessary for us to get friendly with our neighbors but no big deal."
I called in an order and carried out. The girl on the phone was friendly and told me it would be ready in 10 min. When I arrived at the cash register the meal was just being put in a bag. It was nice being told an accurate amount of time to expect. I had the original bad boy Buddha bowl. It was full of veggies and the sauce was spicy but still delicious. It's served with a side of rice which I mixed with the vegetable. I was somewhat surprised that the vegetables were served lukewarm but it still was good. The portion size was generous. I had enough for basically two meals.  And at around $9 the meal had great value.
"I shall start by saying that I have lost count of the number of times I have been to Crisp. My addiction with this eatery are the barbecue wings with fries.Oh my word!The Seoul bowl also goes over incredibly well with me. The rice and the ground steak in a sweet, but not saccharin, sauce is delicious. But the spicy barbecue wings that are plump to food bliss really keep me coming back."
I love this place! I always order a bowl and then eat my fiances fried chicken because it's just SO good and super addicting!!!
"I don't know what's wrong with me. Every time I go to Crisp, I get 5 spicy wings (yes, they are full sized so it's really like 10), a Buddha Bowl (gotta have some veggies in your meal), and extra kimchi (very necessary). That's well over $30 and too much food to eat in one sitting. But I do it every time. Maybe, it's love."
I still have to find a place that tops their wings. The atomic sauce just makes everything a lot better. CHECK IT OUT
"Just ate at Crisp and had the Big Buddha Bowl with chicken and was very disappointed to say the least....I counted 5 out of the supposed 12 veggies that were included, and what was there wasn't even very much of each. For $13 all in without drink, I would expect to be full after I ate.I'd go back to try the chicken with low expectations."
This place is really good and pretty cheap. Had the beef bowl and liked it a lot. It's not like a sit down place but it is a good fast food type of place.  I'll def go back.
"Their chicken wings are huge and delicious. Their two main sauces (forget the names) make the chicken so delicious. You can smell from blocks away, and it is always so tempting."
"Crisp how I love the. I would eat here more often, but it's not among the healthiest of options at least for me. I mean the buddha bowls and burritos are good. My gf and I are in it for the wings and (onion) rings. BEST CHICKEN WINGS EVER!!! They are huge, moist and finger licking good. I have been on a teriyaki kick, so lately the ""sassy"" wings have been my go to. The gf loves the buffalo, and honestly the bbg is really good too. They even offer whole chickens in the sauces! Haven't done it yet, but it will happen. Service is really nice, except for the girl that answers the phone, i really loathe her. Maybe she just doesn't want to talk to me? :(Be prepared to eat your meal close to strangers. It is usually hopping, and it is communal style seating. Nice byob spot too."
"After walking by a few times and always seeing it packed inside, I decided to try out Crisp today. The food was really great! I tried their original bad boy buddha bi bim bop rice bowl. Made with carrots, mushrooms, cucumbers, corn, Korean radish, $1 for added chicken and a fried egg. The best part was when I stumbled upon some zucchini...my fav!The worst part, however, is that the service was real terrible. I never received a ""hello"" or a ""thank you"" from anyone...and I was the only one in the line! The three male cashiers were busy talking amongst themselves...I wish I would have gotten your names, because I love exploiting stuff like that.Anyway, I will be back for that rice bowl. But hey, take a look at my profile pic and remember it. Because next time, I'd appreciate a ""hello!"""
"Seriously.. The wings here are amazing. Some of the best, unique wings in the city. The chicken is plump, fried and juicy. Couple that with some Sassy Seoul or Korean BBQ and you have some tasty treats. The sides are pretty good too but I recommend NOT ordering a large to split between people. There's a lot of it to go around so go with small! Also, the small order of 5 wings will definitely fill you up. I'll have to come here again just to try their Bi Bim Bop and other items, they look amazing too."
"Bomb wings, a bit un-impressed by the bowls.  Small, plan on sitting NYC style on top of another group"
Great giant chicken strips with finger smacking sauces. The bibimbap is great too. The portions are generous and the service is quick.Only gripe is that the seating arrangement is community style benches so you have to sit next to strangers. Highly recommended for a quick bite.
"Ok so I just left Crisp. I ordered the Seoul Sassy wings that everyone raves about and I must say that I don't quite understand the hype.2.75 stars.The sauce was tasty but the wings were just meh. Let me explain. When I eat fried chicken I like my chicken crispy. This was not. I mean...the name of the place is Crisp. In addition to that it was lukewarm like maybe it had been sitting there for awhile. You expect this at chain restaurants but I didn't expect that here. Especially since the menu it says the chicken is ""made to order"". The chicken wings were big but that doesn't make up for them being..well just ok.All in all It wasn't terrible but it wasn't make you wanna slap yo mamma good like so many on here claim imho. But alas everyone's tastebuds are different and I'm sure my review won't stop you from going because you'll want to judge for yourself as I do when I read so-so reviews of a place that overwhelmingly receives positive reviews. I've had great Korean wings before and these are like I said...meh.I will give this place another try to see if maybe I just caught them on an off day. I just want you to be prepared that you may be let down after reading these reviews..."
"Whole chicken, all dark meat, Seoul Sassy sauce, and an order of their fried mushrooms.You're welcome.No really though, this fried chicken is amazing, the sauces are awesome(though Seoul Sassy is far and away the best), and their Mon-Thur deal of a whole chicken, 2 small sides, and 2 cans of soda for $20 cannot be beat.  If you're doing the deal, just get 2 orders of the fried mushrooms.  Yes, the kimchi is good; get the fried mushrooms.  Not only are the mushrooms the perfect amount of crispy outside, juicy inside, they come with Allison's Atomic Sauce, which I wish I could hook up to myself intravenously.The only problem with crisp is you have to get the Big Boy Buddha Bowl to get all the good stuff the bowl should have, and that's $10.  While the bowl at that point is so big, it will be leftovers as well, if you're getting more than just a bowl, the cost can get up there fast, especially if its on the weekend and the $20 deal isn't on.But for real, you know a place makes damn good chicken when they charge you extra for all dark meat."
"Fantastic, affordable food.Obviously, the wings are the draw, but I was particularly into the bowls, especially the Big Buddha Bowl - really, really tasty.This place has very little seating, and is always packed, so I'd definitely try to go earlier if you're trying to get a seat.  But on a nice Chicago day - just take it to go or eat outside!"
"Waiiiiiiiit.... I haven't reviewed this place?This place has some of the best wings in the city. Not gonna lie, I could eat these wings everyday! But then I would probably be 300 pounds. I probably should change it up sometimes soon, but I always get the 5 piece wings with Seoul Sassy sauce. The five piece is enough. Seriously, these aren't you typical wings you get at a bar. These are huge. It's the WHOLE wing. So don't over do it and get the 10 piece when you know 5 will be just fine! (unless you are extremely hungry---it's okay, we've all been there). The Seoul Sassy is sweet and salty goodness with a bit of Asian flair. Always try the sauces they have. It doesn't matter what you have, I feel like they compliment anything. Or maybe that's because I like to douse food in sauces."
"I live walking distance from Crisp.  It's a wonder I don't look like The Hindenburg on feet.Their phenomenal chicken has deservedly received a lot of attention in some top-tier national publications.I do have a question, though:  Do some of you people actually take pictures of your food?  Weird, but I don't even know what twerking is..........so who cares what I think.Trust me on Crisp, though!  Drool-worthy!"
"The batter around the wings are amazingly crispy and the meat just pulls off the bone. Seoul Sassy doesn't taste very much like traditional Korean wings heavy on the chili bean paste flavor, but still worth going of your way for."
I always get the Seoul sassy and bbq with a Buddha bowl. They are all excellent. The price isn't bad and the wings are big and cooked to perfection.
"I really liked the chicken. I m from Korea and have lived there for over a decade so I can't prevent myself from comparing what Crisp has to offer with its close relative in Korea: Yangyum Tongddak. They definitely got the inspiration from it. The taste wasn't the same, but that's something I had expected. You're in America and there's a taste people here might enjoy more than the majority of peeps in Korea. Anyways, the taste. I'd order the spicy wings over any other sauce. I had only wished that the sauce was a little bit less tangy. I did not want to be reminded of Buffalo Wild Wings. I wanted to be reminded of what unique tasting chicken I was having at Crisp. Price. Absolutely AMAZING for how much they give you! I was reminded of another Korean mentality: Inshim (kindness, especially that displayed by middle-aged restaurant cooks that give you a little bit more food to take care of you). I hope they don't mess around with the quantity. I m still enjoying Crisp the next day for lunch. Service TOP of the line. Everybody was cheerful about helping me out with my order and also asking if I had enjoyed what I had eaten. Not many places do that. I liked the racial diversity because it shows that anybody an everybody should enjoy Korean food. Respects to Jay the owner. Keep up the good work. Last but not least, this place is BYOB. Bring your freakin beer. Its the Korean tradition  (2cha) to drink beer and eat chicken at the same time. Its the best!!!"
"If you've had bon chon in NY this is very similar. The breading here is absent and the sauces are similar but different, but you will definitely enjoy the wings here as well. The crunch of the wings is done just right, the amount of sauce is perfect. And the wings are huge!  Two friends and I ordered 40 Jumbo wings, even after the cashier asked 40 and entered our order with a smirk on his face. Best mistake ever. We got 30 seoul sassy and 10 crispy bbq. I like both flavors, but my favorite had to be seoul sassy. We didn't finish the 40 wings and we stopped around 21-23 wings. The rest were brought back to finish later."
"It doesn't get much better than this! Seoul Sassy is beyond this world.  Been a number of times when having family or friends in town and have yet to disappoint. It's quick, cheap and the portions are huge. Had 6 hungry mouths to feed, ordered 2 full chickens and ate left overs for a couple days. A must while in Chicago."
"Chicken wings are one if the best I've had. Big, juicy, and it stay crispy! You would think the wings would just be soggy after drenched in their Seoul sassy sauce, but they stayed crispy till the last wing."
"It's one of my fav places!! I love the Kimchi fries, steak bow, and CHICKEN WINGS!!! I love Korean food."
Pro: Great huge wings! Con: Over pricedClose early
"Call up, order some chicken, fried mushrooms and soda pop. Man on the phone say it be about an hour.  That's fair, I'll do some chores around the house til my food comes.  Hour later, a man from the store calls back, say we 'don't deliver there.'  How that, I say, I get delivery from you boys before.  I'm sorry old hoss, say the man on the phone, you're one block north of our delivery boundary, and the delivery service is refusing to take it. Now, a competent restaurant man woulda told his delivery service, 'We done promised this man his food an hour ago, you go on and take it to him, do the store a solid, and we'll keep you around.'  This was no competent restaurant man on the phone though, no boss cracker. This was the kind of man who ought be spend his life cleaning poop outta chicken coops, not try to run no chicken restaurant. A man whose word, don't mean nothing.  A very low kind of man, even by the standards of men who try to run kitchens. It's aight, though, they chicken not all that anyhow."
"This restaurant is only saved by their chicken wings; the rest of the food that we tasted basically sucked.Ordered:- 5 Chicken Wings: 4 stars | We got a combo of both sauces, and the spicy BBQ is definitely superior to the Sassy Seoul. Wings are a substantial size and are crispy and delicious. Try your wings with a bit of Allison's atomic sauce; it's a nice creamy balance to the sweet sauce.  While snacking on these wings, I wished it was served with a Korean pickled radish to cut through some of the sweetness in the sauce.- Big Buddha Bowl + Bulgogi: 2 stars | The bulgogi is is dry and chewy, and the flavor is just meh.  - Radish Kimchi: 1 star - I would give this 0 stars if I could, but the minimum is 1. |  It is awful... way too fish sauce-y, and the radish was a dry and withered.  Also paying for kimchi at a Korean restaurant = wtf?Also want to make it clear that this is more of a Korean fusion place (or Korean with major American influence) instead of the more traditional Korean cuisine; I know I was expecting a more traditional Korean food experience, and that isn't what you get at Crisp.  Service is brusque, and a bit of a turn off, imo."
"I'm pretty stingy with 5-star ratings but hot diggity damn, this place serves good fried chicken!  Ordered a whole chicken that was half Seoul Sassy and half BBQ. Both were good but the sesame seeds and interplay of sweet and savory on the BBQ wins out. We devoured the food in a manner of minutes and I, who generally loathe skin and fat, for not just health reasons but also texture, scarfed up everything, skin and all. The fresh fries and fried mushrooms are pretty good too. Most of the poor reviews are for either space (are you seriously coming here for ambience?!?!), packaging (who cares about napkins, just take it home), price, or over-frying. As far as value, I got the whole chicken deal with 2 sides so it turned out to be affordable for two people. Also, I can see what some are saying about the food being overly crisp. I definitely noticed pieces that weren't quite meat and likely were cartilage or soft bone, which were not easy to visually distinguish. But ignorance can be bliss and I ate them anyway. That said, I did not have any issues with the meat being dried out, even on the breast.  The place is pretty small so takeout is probably best. But kudos to the lady behind the counter because she was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Lastly, a word to the wise: the food smells intoxicating (in a good way!) so beware if traveling far. You will want to dig in right then and there. Ditto for your trash, which is way worse and can leave you looking like a wacko digging through garbage."
"What's not too say about Crisp that hasn't already been said?  Not much!  Amazing chicken wings with some seoul sassy sauce was finger licking good.  The Wife had the Bulgogi rice bowl and that too was spoon licking good.  It's a small place, had to wait a little for a spot but it was worth it!  MMMmmm, Chicken!"
"Good, healthy food. I liked the atmosphere of sharing a table with other people. Very casual, pick up your order and eat on a picnic table sort of place."
"The bibimbap was good but not great.The chicken - order the chicken and wings bone-in. It tastes best this way, and boneless chicken is no fun to eat. I love the choice of flavors. Seoul Sassy is my favorite. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. It does get awkward when it's crowded and you have to share a table with people, and people stare at each other. But the chicken is worth it. Crisp is consistently great."
"So after reading the mouth-watering reviews of Crisp, I decided to take the plunge. Albeit, anyone who offered me wings and delivered for a nominal fee was a contender. I ordered the Whole Jumbo Wings with Seoul Sassy sauce and the Crisp Chicken tenders with Suicide sauce.They scored a star for me because my order came much earlier than expected and was HOT. I run up the stairs, open the box, and I am slightly perplexed. Who would have though they actually would give me the WHOLE wing, not just some flimsy drummette. This is worth 2 stars. The pricing NOW makes sense. I bite into this chicken and it sure is heavenly! The 2 more stars. Now the crisp chicken tenders.. you can pass on them. It was a nice attempt for spice, but I am a spice junky. So it did not make the cut hence the minus 1 star.Would I order these again, absolutely! Probably in about 5 months. There is so much goodness on these wings, you cannot afford to eat them to often. Then again, this would be a nice treat to impress out of town or less explored native Chicagoans -- is that a word?"
"Crisp had been recommended by a friend, and I decided to check it out for a late lunch. Wow, was I blown away!I found the interior of the restaurant very intriguing. A small establishment with big tables for community style dining. The counter in the back was run by several very personable young men who immediately made me feel welcome.Not knowing what I was getting, I decided to order a few things to try off the menu in the hopes that I'd have several meals out of this deal. Let me just say, hell yes I got several meals. I might be eating chicken for the next week.1. Jumbo Seoul Sassy Wings: By far the BIGGEST wings you'll ever order, and that is not an over-exaggeration. These bad boys are the wing and drummie together, fried crispy, and tossed in the sweet and tangy Seoul sauce. Delicious, but sooooo much food. I ordered to go, and these guys are so big, they were given to me in a lunchbox-sized cardboard container lined with tin foil. No, really, lunch box.2. Korean BBQ chicken tenders: Your traditional chicken tender tossed in a combo Korean-American BBQ. The sauce is slightly spicy, tangy, and sweet. Had an interesting, almost gritty texture at times. Good, but not as mind-blowing as the Seoul wings.3. Fries: Pretty typical skinny-sliced fries tossed with a bit of salt in a paper bag.All-in-all, a delicious and very filling meal. I'll be dragging my friends with me next time and trying the Buddha bowl, but first, I'm going to try and make my way through several days worth of chicken."
"After hearing about this place time and time again from a friend whose opinion & palette I truly trust - we finally got a chance to order from here. Since we're actually 2 blocks outside of their posted $3 delivery range -   I was quite pleased to learn they'd deliver to us for a slight surcharge of $2 ($5 total for delivery).We were a big group so I ordered 3 chickens, but since I didn't know the sweetness or spice factor of the sauces - i decided to order two chickens plain with the sauce on the side and only one with sauce on it.  The order arrived timely, though I was a bit annoyed that my delivery instructions weren't followed with regards to the door to deliver to - Of course this wasn't a surprise since the delivery guy was also missing the charge slip for me to sign - so I basically had to write a note on the back of a piece of paper he was carrying telling them they could charge my card.  The delivery issues were a little annoyance that could have been shrugged off quickly had everything been good within the bags.Alas - upon bringing the bags upstairs to our house and unpacking them - we discovered we had no sauce. I checked the order form - the sauce was listed.  I phoned Crisp and informed them that part of the order was missing.  The guy I spoke with was the same one who had taken my order, and he apologized and said he didn't know how fast he could get the sauce to us but would request it.  We said ok, we'll wait - this was fine since our two orders of french fries were a soggy, steamed mess and we'd fired up our oven to crisp them back to life - we had time to wait.About ten minutes later Natalie called back from Crisp to tell us that she would not be able to send over our sauce.  She instead offered us a credit of $5 on a future order - To which we replied: we were not interested in a future order because we aren't very impressed with the rather dry plain chicken we received (nor the soggy fries ... though they did return to life rather nicely after 15 minutes in the over - perhaps they are best eaten at the restaurant)..My husband, son and I are all long time food service veterans and we were pretty shocked at the sad state of Crisp's customer service.  We understand glitches occur - bad nights happen.  You don't get all these great reviews or stay in business by  delivering  dry chicken repeatedly - but you won't have a chance to ever deliver a good chicken to my house because the way I was treated as a very good paying customer ($100 for 3 chickens, 3 buddha bowls & 2 orders of fries --- I think that's a fairly substantial order & a good potential customer - I know that Richie Melman would think so).So, if you're thinking of ordering from here - I'd say that there are lots of Korean chicken options and definitely lots of buddha bowl type Asian places where the management will value and appreciate you as a paying customer so I recommend rewarding those establishments with your hard earned dollars and skip Crisp - you can do better."
"Seoul Steak bowl is awesome with the atomic sauce!! The portions are large and the price is pretty reasonable considering all the food you get. Not a big fried chicken fan, but their's is great! Only wish is that they sold the fried chick in appetizer-size portions."
"I am a tough critic and rarely give 5s. Crisp gets a slight reduction for their prices. That being said, it is well worth it. Be sure to go on a weekday to get their full chicken special with 2 sides and 2 sodas. Favorite dish:WHOLE BBQ Chicken (this could easily feed 2-4 people depending on appetites)The restaurant is ALWAYS packed. I just order take out and get in and out quickly. Food is delicious and unlike anything else I have found in the area. I have been ordering food from here every other week since I discovered it!"
"Met my son for lunch in his neighborhood and had the spicy boneless wings that crisp offers. The were amazing!  They are my son's favorite and I see why he likes them. I would recommend trying if you have not!Large portions also, not your typical small size wing!"
"I've been thinking about things. Yelp is really great, however, the numerous disappointments experienced at many places we've decided to try (many of which I did not review) has forced me to come to grips with some important truths.  If you're from Chicago, you have to realize that 85% of the people reviewing these businesses come from Oregon or Utah or Maine or some other Blimey-Bloomin' place, where Taco Bell and Hardee's pretty much comprise the restaurant scene.  Then they move to the crib (Chicago) or come visit and taste real food.  Their eyes proceed to pop out of their head, they start turning flips then call their parents to tell them they'll never see them again.  Pure Chicagoans should curb their expectations.  Think about all the stellar reviews for hoity-toity Mexican restaurants where a taco is $7.59, but has the 'most amazing flavors' they've ever experienced.  In reality, you could just go to the neighborhood and get the real thing for a buck, plus free parking. I'm not hatin', because next I'm-a try one of these $5 doughnut places with lines around the corner, and get one with Moroccan chocolate, Brazilian goat cheese and truffle oil.  No doubt, I'll be disappointed again and $5 angrier."
"Totally worthy of all the hype!My dude and I have been meaning to come in here for AGES but ever since we moved out of Lakeview, well, we hate going back.  We're rarely in the neighborhood and so Crisp was one of those places we said we would try ""someday"".  Well we happened to be visiting a friend who happened to live around the corner from Crisp and I saw it as a sign from the Chicken Gods.  We went in at 6:30pm on a Friday and it was EMPTY.  Score!  I had a bad feeling we'd be standing around for ages trying to get a seat and when you have a toddler, that doesn't work out so well.  There are 3 long, cafeteria style tables and then single seats along the walls at counters.  I met another Natalie S. (same first and last name!) at the counter.  The staff were all super friendly and nice, no complaints there.  The chicken!  Oh my stars, the chicken.  We had 20 (yes 20, don't judge us) between the 3 adults and one toddler.  10 Seoul Sassy, 5 Crisp BBQ and 5 spicy buffalo plus onion rings and mushrooms.  The mushrooms and onion rings are seriously some of the best I've ever had.  Super crisp, fried perfectly.  The wings!  For starters, avoid the buffalo.  They were frankly rather terrible.  The sauce makes the wings soggy and limp.  However, the other two kinds were AMAZEBALLS!  Like, so amazing I'm going to make special trips into Lakeview to get more very soon, and I despise Lakeview.  I really want to go back in and eat wings AND try their bibimbap bowls.  They looked really good too."
"This was a superb experience of which I would venture to say Crisp servers up the best fried wings I've ever had. I'm a food lover and have tried it all, but these wings take the cake. I will be coming back for more and telling all of my friends about this spot."
"Great portion size crisp BBQ chicken is dish is great, nice mix of spicy and sweet. Fries or onion rings are a good mix."
"No restaurant in Chicago has been on my list of places to eat longer than Crisp.  For four years (give or take), I walked or drove by this place telling myself I need to stop in sometime soon but never did.  The ""problem"" was that it was so close I kept telling myself I would get around to it next weekend or the weekend after that or the weekend after that.  That was a mistake.  Crisp is one of the best in-and-out places to eat on the entire North Side.I recently ordered the Original Bad Boy Buddha (Bowl) and five whole jumbo wings of the Seoul Sassy variety.  Initially I was going to go with the Baby Buddha and 10 wings but it turns out I made the right choice.  The Bad Boy was very large and surprisingly filling considering how many veggies are included.  The veggies are great but you also get plenty of meat and rice at the bottom of the bowl to mix it all together.  The Buddha Bowls are a fantastic option for anyone not interested in getting wings.But not getting wings when visiting Crisp should be a crime.  They are the best wings I've ever had in Chicago (Disclosure: I have not yet been to Jake Melnick's Corner Tap, winner of multiple city-wide wing competitions).  When I go to a sports bar with plans to order ""jumbo"" wings (think Gamekeepers, McGee's, Bird's Nest, etc.), I assume I'm going to need 20 wings drenched in sauce to be full.  At Crisp, 10 is the most I would ever consider ordering and that would only happen if I wasn't planning to eat anything else with my meal.  The wings are huge (some as big as a regular chicken leg), perfectly crisp, and only lightly sauced, just like God intended.The Seoul Sassy sauce, while tasty, wasn't nearly as inventive as I was led to believe.  You've likely had similar sauces several times throughout your career as a wing eater.  And the fries only serve as a nice change of pace for your taste buds between wings.  But neither of those things call for docking of points.  Crisp makes a simple promise and they absolutely deliver on that promise."
"The Grillmaster, with its sublime chicken breast, grilled onions, mushrooms, Monterey Jack cheese and Atomic Sauce, is irrefutably one of the best yet underrated sandwiches in Chicago. It's a beast and looks almost more burrito than sandwich. I would walk a mile in the rain for this special treasure, and come to think of it... I have!Actually, almost every sandwich here can hold their own with the best of the best. I've only one small bone to pick and that exclusively applies to delivery and carryout - the sandwiches and fries do not hold up well and within 15 minutes, everything's a-wilted. Fix this, please?I still love you, anyway... that is all."
"I biked along the lake front to see all the newly errected sculptures from Addison to as far south as the Museum Campus. The wind was torture as I headed south but I pushed on knowing I was planning to stop at Crisp on the way home.  When I was handed my order, the aromas immediately permiated the air around me.  I carefully placed the bag in my backpack and purposfully left the top part of my bag open to allow the food some room to vent.  The wind was to my back now making the ride home easier, but the torture was smelling the aromas coming out of my back pack.  That only inspired me to hurry home. At home,my sense of taste and touch was able connect with my sense of smell.  The torture was all worth it.  Crisp has FlavorFULL chicken, seriously finger lickin' good --they need to own that phrase from KFC (which doesn't come even close to Crisp).  Crisp does chicken the way chicken should be done.  Also had the steak bowl, bulgogi, okay.  I had a taste of it and kept it in the fridge for another time. I missed the traditional pickled sides that usually accompany Korean entrees.  I wamted to concentrate on the chicken.  I won't be able to stop thinking about or craving the flavors I was exposed to today.TWO DAYS LATER:So in the beginning I wasn't impressed by the steak bowl.  Looing at it, I thought the  rice ratio was too high.  But after evening church service today, I was starved and remembered the steak bowl in the fridge.  This time I poured over the so called ""Atomic"" sauce which I had overlooked before thinking it was just orange colored mayo. Immediately touching my tongue I knw why they call it what they do!  The stuff is just out of this world!  To think I almost threw it out!  The favors and textures added 100% kick to the dish and now I think the bulgogi rice ratio is just right.  Not only will I be returning to Crisp for their incredible chicken but for their steak bowl saturated with the Automic sauce!  I'm looking forward to trying all the other items as well.I now consider Crisp my favorite restaurant!  It no doubt has flavors that keep my taste buds overly, delightfully stimulated!  Nothing wrong with overly stimulated taste buds ;}"
"Everyone raaaaves about Crisp. Maybe the hype set my expectations too high, because though Crisp is good, I wouldn't drool over it. The fried chicken was quite tasty. I liked the classic flavor the best. The crispiness and fried....ness (?) is just right. But, I must say, I do like the chicken wings from our local Korean market better! They make them fried and then coated in honey and sesame.. and that's all I could think of while eating at Crisp! Crisp chicken is tasty, but it doesn't scream Korean-flavors.We also go the Bad Buddha bi bim bop, which wasn't that good. The veggies were all American veggies, like cucumbers and corn. I kept expecting to have pickled veggies and more seaweed. The thing I really liked about Crisp were the communal seating and stacks of chopsticks & sauces. It's always fun to eat Asian-low-key-restaurant style. Overall, Crisp is pretty good. I think it definitely caters to the American taste buds and eases a newbie's way into a Korean meal. Lastly, it just occurred to me... majority of Koreans are Christians. And the bi bim bops here are called ""Buddha Bowls"". What is the cultural relationship to Buddhism? Plus, they're served with a bulgogi, chicken or tofu. Now I feel kinda bad having eaten meat affiliated with Buddha -___-"
"The wings were okay and they were huge, which is always good.  I like it when I get my money's worth.  But there was something about them that didn't make me crave them or want more.  The crispiness of the chicken was really good but the sauce was missing something.  Not sure what but if I have any spare time next time I'm in Chicago I'll probably go again."
"These wings were delicious! Strange as it may sound though, my complaint is that there were too many of them. I got a 5 wing plate (Seoul sassy) and would have been happy to have stopped at 3. I didn't really have any take-home options since in staying in a dorm room, so I ended up eating the other two as well. That left me feeling a bit icky instead of ecstatic.I'd like a per wing price option as well, because these things are seriously huge and the sweetness of the sauce gets to be a bit much after a while (and $9 for lunch is more than I usually like to spend too)."
"Absolutely delicious! The BBQ wings are a must!! It is a small space, so it's difficult to find seating, but it's totally worth the little bit of awkwardness to be sitting next to a stranger to have these wings! Mmmmm"
"DEEP FRIED HEAVEN on a budget especially with this deal: $19.99 = 1 whole Seoul Sassy fried chicken + 2 sides.It's garlic-y, sweet, and spicy.  Texture wise, it's both crispy and juicy.  Their chicken plays with all of your tastebuds!  While I try not to be a glutton, I managed to eat like 3/4 of the entire chicken.  Can't say it's one of my classiest moments.   For our sides, we ordered their Superfly Frites and Marty's Magic Mushrooms.  The frites were crispy and the mushrooms were nice and juicy."
"To call me a wingman would be an understatement.  I have more of an obsessive compulsion toward the buffalo variety and rarely stray away from that one sauce, though the level of heat varies by my temperament.  That being said, upon walking into Crisp on a Wednesday afternoon I became so overpowered by the scent of Korean Barbecue that I did something absolutely unheard of: ordered 10 wings, half spicy Buffalo and half...   ...   ...   Seoul Sassy!  I took the food to go because I was already incredibly tired and knew that this basket of poultry godliness would certainly put me into a food coma.  At this point, I'm not sure my relationship with Buffalo sauce will ever be the same after experiencing such crispy colossal wings covered in sauce so sassy it'd make even the girls at the Wiener Circle blush."
"Oh my goodness..oh my goodness! & THAT IS WHAT Crisp is all about ...  G-O-0-D-N-E-S-S Whether you want delivery, take out, or if you are lucky you might be able to grab a seat inside, either way Crisp is one hellova place. I ordered 5 Seoul Sassy wings, two steak bowls, and two drinks. It was $30 dollars but this chiquita is not complaining.  I had left overs for the next day AND some. First off, the 5 wings are equivalent to 15 wings. They are HUGE... made for huge appitites. I had one wing and could not even bare a second one ( I was THAT full)The breading on the wings is super crunchy and soaks up all that sassy sauce.  Like another yelper said, it's almost like the breading is some sort of crumbled up Special K cereal- at least that is how I can decribe it. The steak bowl had plenty of rice at the bottom with plenty of sauce over the bulgogi steak ( Bulgolgi=thinly, sliced marinated beefy goodness) which is a plus if you do not like your meat dry -like this chica over here. They have a delivery service on a different pair of wheels.... I figure the area it is in is so congested that they have a delivery boy on a bicycle! I am from surburbia and this is just not seen everyday. I was totally impressed. The guy was gone for 5 minutes legit. I swear if I lived in this area I would totally tip that boy well ;) heehee . Anywhooo... you need to try this place at least 15x just cause it really is THAT good. Oh yeah, prepare to be messy. Take someone here on like your 5th date with them.  Im writing this review and drooling at the same time... so I need to go grab a napkin  byeeeeeeee. P.s. Get the wings!P.s.s Get the seoul sassy sauceP.s.s.s. save me some of your leftovers =)  MEOW!"
"In summary,Atmosphere: Small, casual communal seating type restaurant where you place your order with the cashier. Food: Wings are abnormally large. I was full after 2 1/2. BBQ and Seoul Sassy are both very sweet sauces that can be a bit much after a few bites. Wings were delightfully crispy. Bibimbop bowl was average, nothing to rave about. Sadly, it's not in a clay pot so there isn't any crispy rice to savor at the end.Price: Fair. $9 for 5 wings and about $8-10 for a bimbimbop bowl.Overall: I wouldn't mind coming here again, but I wish I could just buy 1 wing."
Sassy Seoul chicken is maybe my favorite fried chicken in Chicago. Very crispy and flavorful. The place is quick and reasonably priced. Neighborhood favorite
"Best wings ever said the person who hates chicken wings.I hate getting my fingers dirty when I eat, fine judge me, unless it is ribs. Everything else is all knifes and forks for this girl but after hearing from numerous of Chicago friends that I must head to Crisp because it is the best Korean food place in Lakeview, I obliged.Boy, were they right! I went with my friend who was in town from Kansas City last Saturday afternoon and we ventured down on the brown line to this glorified hot spot. I ordered their Seoul Sassy wings and my first thought was, ""Dangggg, these wings are HUGE!"" and boy, they tasted mighty fine too. I almost had to stop myself from embarrassing myself licking my fingers off from the sweet sauce prepared with ginger, soy, garlic and other select spices on the wings. I could only finish 2 of the wings and had to take the rest home which I was secretly excited for since that meant I could lick the sauce off my fingers in the presence of my own home haha. My friend ordered their baby buddha bowl which is a bibimbap that us Koreans love to eat. I had a bite of my friend's bowl and it tasted just like the way my mom and grandma makes them so I was pretty impressed.I am coming back Crisp! Your wings were da bombbbbbbbbbbbbbbb."
Oh I so love Korean foods!!! The must order item has to be the chicken wings and the rice bowl!The items are pretty pricy and i guess it is the location? I would go back  to it since i love fried foods! :D
"Crisp is amazing.  It is arguably the best fried chicken I have ever had.  Their whole chicken combo is adequately priced and comes with a TON of food!  They're Seoul sauce is my favorite and it is addictive!  The onion rings are definitely the perfect side to go along with the juicy chicken and they're drink selection is impressive to say the least, with drinks like Cherry 7UP and Ruby Red Squirt.  If you haven't tried this place yet, you should.  The only negative thing that comes to mind is the lack of seating in the restaurant but other than that Crisp is always a treat."
"I don't even like fried chicken, but I will pay $16 to a cab just to get me some of these chicken strips bathed in seoul sassy sauce and sided with mysteriously sticky organic brown rice (don't those things tend to be just kind of crunchy?). Be warned that the servings are huge... which makes me like them more cos it's so cheap. Seriously, the meal cost less than a cab. It's the best place to grab lunch in the neighborhood and you can totally cross the street to Bobtail Ice Cream or Intelligentsia Coffee afterwards to cap off your yummies."
"There is a reason they have thousands of reviews.. its because they are absolutely amazing. It is kind of pricey, but it is so so worth it."
"Okay, Crisp, you get fried chicken.  These wings are the best I've had in Chicago thus far.  We came here for one thing: chicken wings.  Success.  My favorite sauces are the Sassy Seoul and BBQ sauces.  AMAZING - Finger-lickin' good.  The chicken is perfectly cripsy with the right about of coating and it is very moist.  The chicken wings are also huge!  They have it down to a fine art.  This gets the five stars all the way! [We also tried the baby buddha bowl which was okay but in no way compares to the chicken.  We also did not use enough of the special sauce that goes with it.  I'd rate the bowl at 3.5 stars.]   Just writing this review is making me crave the chicken wings.TIP:There isn't a lot of seating room so plan to avoid the busy times.  Also - I would advise against driving.  Parking could be problematic."
"Our daughter took us to this place.  We got there just as they opened and there was a line forming.  She had the chicken wings, I had the baby budha.  You order, you sit and wait for your name to be called, you devour the food.  Generally chopsticks but if you need forks/knifes they are available at the counter.  The sauces are really good and the food is very filling.  After walking in the cold to get there it was a nice hole in the wall to find.  You sit at community tables and share so get used to it.  Wish we were there longer so we could try to the other dishes."
"Everything on the menu is great!Chicken wings never failed to be crispy.  The sauce makes finger-lickin' an acceptable approval of yumminess.When in the neighborhood, I try my best to drop by.Thank you Crisp for a nice lunch through ScoutMob.  Much appreciated by a loyal fan!"
A practice in brevity: Five stars for the seoul sassy wings. Skip the rest.
"I went on a Friday night at around 7pm, and the place was packed. I didn't want to be messy and ordered the 6 chicken strips with Seoul Sassy sauce, and my boyfriend ordered the Foodie Goodie? Sandwich.  The wait was way too long. There were people who came after us and got their food before us, not happy about that. Maybe if we ordered wings/ rice bowl, it would've been faster. Environment - it was a cute, casual place with not a lot of seating, but people leave soon after they're done eating. So it doesn't really take long to get a seat. All the food on the menu look appetizing, especially the rice bowl! I wanted to order that. They are huge for $8 (+3 for meat, otherwise it's just plain veggie and rice with an egg). Since my chicken stripes tasted like typical chicken stripes from any other place, and the sauce wasn't that special either, I regretted ordering that.Took a bite of my bf's sandwich, it was ehhh. BUT, I will return for their rice bowl, just to try."
A great neighborhood restaurant :) my very picky 3 year old begs to eat here after preschool. He loves the chicken fingers with Seoul sassy sauce and I love the Buddha bowl. Well done guys :My only complaint is I wish you would go back to being open at 11 instead of 1130.
"Like most people, when I hear Rage Against The Machine, I think Korean chicken wings.Yeah, it's hipster-ish.  It's not authentic (as if the alternative music and french fries don't give it away).  But my god...the chicken wings:1) The way they count it is actually the entire wing.  That's the drumstick plus the part with the middle bone you have to rip out.  Beware with their numbering...5 pieces might add up to your usual 10!2) No pigeon sized wings here.  These are mighty chickens they serve here, and while you might think that ruins the sauce-meat ratio, the meat itself is so tender and juicy that it only adds to the awesomeness.  So yeah, with the size...5 pieces is more like 15!3) Only four flavors, but that's all they need.  Plain - why? Buffalo - you can get that elsewhere.  Basically it boils down to a spicy Korean flavor, and a sweet Korean flavor...both of which are flavorful, unique, and addicting.And while I may complain about the music mismatch, it actually is a nice place, cool staff, and hey - I grew up on that music.  Great stuff all around."
"So frikkin delicious.  Wings are awesome. Juicy, crisp (duh), perfect. At our second outing we also tried a baby buddha bowl & if I could have I would have licked the bowl."
"Note to self: wear a bib at the next outing =D Went with a big group of hungry boys in the mood for tasty asian fusion. Not a huge venue, but after 15 mins of waiting, we managed to snag a big table for our group. My man & I ordered: * 1/2 order of Crisp BBQ wings* 1/2 order of Seoul Sassy wings* Seoul Steak Bowl Don't say I didn't warn ya fellow yelpers... portions are HUGE! I don't know where they get their chicken from, but these wings are not your typical wangs. They keep the drumstick & legs together, and coat 'em in delicious sauces. I liked the Crisp BBQ because Seoul Sassy had too much of a kick for my weak self. The Seoul Steak bowl wasn't extraordinary, but marinated bulgogi on top of a bed of rice.... it's hard to dislike such a dish. Their sauces tie in all the flavors, so go crazy with the extra condiments. I'll be back for the chicken wangs with my bib & wet wipes! So crispy! So tasty!"
"I live down the street from Crisp and only wish I came here more often! Every time I visit, I can't decide between the wings and the bowls and even the sandwich. It's all that good! Although the price might seem a little high at first glance, portion sizes are actually huge. I had trouble finishing their 5 piece wings by myself. Same goes for the chi-town bowl. Finally the main reason I keep going back.. The atomic sauce! Can never get enough of the goodness."
Best fried chicken I ever had! I also love the vegetable plates that come with the combo
"Food is always good, but $3 delivery fee and a $3 tip for delivery driver, my food should be hot when I get it.  I ordered online on Friday at 7:00pm, food was delivered at 8:15pm and was not hot - at all.  Seriously disappointed in the delivery service. :("
Some of the best chicken I've had in Chicago.  I recommend the Seoul sassy sauce.  Also be careful not to over order cause they give you a lot of food!The bowls are good but the chicken is where it's at.Great tables inside too with a great array of sauces!  I highly recommend.Really friendly service too.
"Absolutely loved this place. I got the Chicago Bowl, which is chicken over rice with some onions mixed in there. I got real with the sauces, which are siracha (tough one to spell) and some kind of mystery orange sauce. Both great. As good as my meal was, I envied my roommate who got the chicken wings. He ordered 10 and the price may shock you compared to say BDubs or Hooters, but 10 wings here could feed a mom, dad and child. So much meat on the bones. Planning on a return trip to order these, box 'em up and have again for lunch the next day. If you are stuck in a rut of pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs and looking to mix it up in Chicago, get to Crisp immediately."
Delicious food! But the setting is hectic and crowded. If you're gonna eat in claim a seat before you order.
I think I got a bad batch of chicken last night. I got the half chicken with Korean BBQ sauce. The dark meat was overcooked and dry and thus the breast was as tough as an old dried out eraser. Bleh! Sauce was a lot more sweet than I remember and lacked the heat and salt. The sriracha on the tables helped but it's not as good as if it was stirred into the sauce from the beginning.
This place is amazing! Their food--bizarre! My co-worker orders from them all the time and I'm always over his shoulder sniffing and waiting for some of that gooey chicken goodness!
"Hands down the best chicken wings I have ever had. Split my order between two flavors the BBQ and the Seoul Sassy. Both were excellent. My only complaint was that it was super hot in the store. Honestly though, i would eat these things inside that uncomfortable hot building all day - they are just that good!"
"We went last weekend.  You don't go to this place for atmosphere, you go here for the best damn chicken around.  Sticky, sweet, spicy, perfectly cooked...LOVE it!  Thank God I don't live in Boy's Town, I'd weigh 300 pounds."
"Do you like fried chicken? Of course you do because you are a normal human being with functioning taste buds. So you can stop reading.Ok not convinced? Well the wings here are super yummy and they give you the big full wing so like 3-4 will fill up any human being for the most part. The crisp BBQ sauce is super delicious not too spicy just the right balance of savory and sweet. They also have a good selection of sides and bowls, etc. but if you are ordering them as a side you best have someone to split it with or you are going to need a to go bag. They've also got some authentic Korean beverages that are fun to try. It only takes 5-10 minutes for them to fry up the food so it is a quick delicious place to get some to go chicken."
"This is the first time I tried the place for lunch.The Sassy Sauce was really, really tasty.  BUT, the chicken was really dry and very ""bony"".  It appears that they use really small chickens when you order the half or whole chicken.  You get more at Boston Market for the money and that is a shame, because of the quality of the sauce.However, having said all of that, I DO recommend the sauce if you can find something on the menu to have other than the half/whole chicken."
fried chicken like you have never had b4! Soul Sassy is tasty!
"Koricious!!  I was trying to combine ""Korean"" and ""Delicious,"" did you get it?  (Crickets) I stopped in on a sweltering, humid, muggy day for a quick dinner.  I was also meeting a friend for a movie afterwards, and didn't want to be all ""fried chickened' up while sitting next to a pretty girl in a crowded movie theater.  Instead of ordering the fried chicken, which is the go-to hear as I'm told, I decided to go with the chicken tenders, and some fries.  I know what you're thinking, ""he went the healthy route.""  You're right, chicken tenders and fries is skimping it a little, but it's the summer, we need to watch our figures. The tenders were well cooked and not dry.  I got them tossed in the Crispy BBQ sauce, which was good, and tasted like soy and gochujang and sticky goodness.  The fries were skinny and forgettable.  I ate a few and ended up tossing most of them away.  Only crazy people throw away french fries (global currency), but again, I was trying to keep it classy, not gassy.I'd definitely come back here to try the Bowls and that sexy fried chicken everyone's talking about.**The small amount of seating here is communal, meaning you may make some new friends at dinner.  If you're not down for that, call your order in ahead, and bring that Seoul Food Home!"
This place rocks. Seoul sassy anything is where it's at...go boneless strips or try the wings. A favorite take-out spot for sure. Only thing I'd ask for is that I wish they'd upgrade to better fries. Other than that it's some of the best chicken in the city!
"Upon recommendation from a friend, we decided to try this place out. Being that I come from NYC, we have the likes of Bon Chon, Kyo Chon, Unidentified Flying Chickens, and Mad For Chicken. Crisp has high standards to live by, and because of this, I was intrigued to see if they can live up to their competition on the East Coast.The ambiance is simple, with 3 large picnic-sized communal tables. You order at the back, wait for your name to be called and eat at one the 3 large communal tables. If you like your privacy, I recommend taking it on the go, but you risk the chance of the wings not being as fresh and crispy.For our first visit here, we ordered the 10 piece whole jumbo wings ($15.95) with Seoul Sassy sauce, touted as a sweet sauce consisting of ginger, soy, garlic and spices. We also ordered the Baby Buddha Bowl ($6.95) with beef (extra $1.00), and a side of their Superfly Frites (Small - $2.25). In about 8 minutes, my name was called and my tray of wings and fries were waiting to be picked up. The Baby Buddha Bowl wasn't ready for another 5 minutes, but one of the staff members were nice enough to bring it over to us.The Korean fried chicken indeed lived up to its name. It was perfectly crisp, sort of like a twice-fried crispy french fry vs. a soggy once-fried french fry. The meat inside the legs and wings were so juicy and tender. Thank goodness for dark meat. But that Seoul Sassy sauce really took it over the top, sweet, savory, salty, with a subtle spiciness. No flavor overwhelmed the other, making for a well-balanced palate pleaser that had my taste buds jumping up and down. Crisp's fried chicken may not be as good as some of their New York City counterparts, but they make one darn good delicious wing that is a must try, especially for those that have never had Korean fried chicken. The french fries were fairly standard, extra crispy on the outside, though not very potatoey inside. They were good, but definitely didn't much for me. The Baby Buddha Bowl is where things fell apart. It is touted as a mini adaptation of a traditional Korean dish called bimbimbap, but it was so very far from that. It was not served in a hot stone ceramic pot that it is usually served in and there was no sizzle factor. The texture of the rice sort of felt like it came right out of the rice pot with no crispiness whatsoever. The fried egg and vegetables (spinach, bean sprouts, carrots and zucchini) were spread on top in bimbimbap fashion, but when mixed together, none of the ingredients really seemed to complement each other to make for a tasty concoction. It left for a rather timid dish that felt like the ingredients were carelessly thrown in a dish and claimed as bimbimbap. The Korean hot sauce, called Gochujang, which is better known as a Korean red chili bean paste, was not spicy at all. Even tasting it alone, brought barely any heat to my tongue. For any avid bimbimbap fans, I'd avoid the baby buddha at all costs, at it leaves nothing to be desired. After 3-4 bites, we wound up throwing away the rest.One of the cashiers I had ordered from was also especially rude. When I put in the order for the Jumbo Wings, he looked at me as if I were stupid and asked me impolitely in one way or another, ""You gonna tell me what sauce? or what?"" And as I was paying, he took a phone call. He ran my credit card and handed it back to me. I was waiting for a receipt but didn't want to be rude and interrupt his call, but he gave me a look and motioned for me to move over so the next customer can order.Crisp definitely does serve some delicious Korean fried chicken that is a must-try, especially for the uninitiated. For that I would give them 5 stars, but because I'm comparing it to some of their NYC competition, I'll give it 4 stars. But their fries and Buddha Bowls can easily be overlooked. I really can't believe how wrong they seemed to get the bimbimbap and why they would even bother putting it on the menu, but apparently quite a few people in the restaurant seemed to be eating it and loving it. And last but not least was their rude service, which really left me in a somewhat bothered state when I left Crisp. For my overall experience of Crisp, all it deserves is 3 stars."
"Why four whole stars?-fried chicken: tell me where else in this city you can get your fingers sticky with plump, juicy, out-of-this-world-flavorful Korean bbq? -bulgogi: the Seoul steak bowl was delicious. Meat was sweet and flavorful, just like bulgogi should be. Top it with Alison's Atomic Sauce.-kimchi: yes, you do have to purchase it on the side. But it is homemade and you get a ton of it. Take it home and it will only get spicier and more delicious.-staff: super friendly and helpful for those of us who are newer to the Korean food scene.Why only four stars?-space: it is crowded and cramped.-tables: kinda cruddy and you have to share your table.Other tidbits:-gotta love the rolls of paper towels on the tables. Very helpful!-the bottles of sauce on the table are delish. Sassy Seoul, Alison's Atomic, and sriracha."
"Baby Buddha Bowl (Huge!!!!) + 5 wings w/Sassy Sauce + Cabbage Kimchee = Heavenly meal for two. Fantastic, nuclear ginormous meaty wings, great sauce. Eat in or take-out, you can't go wrong! Yum yummy!"
Amazing korean fried chicken you get it in chi-town!
"Seoul Sassy!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhh! So tasty! I got the 19.99 combo based on Simon H.'s advice and it was a good choice. The fries were nothing special so they can be skipped but the mushrooms were awesome! Breaded perfectly, cooked perfectly, with an interesting little sauce with some kick to dip the magic mushrooms in.Seating is at picnic style tables which is kind of awkward when it gets super duper busy and it does. Their chicken is just amazing! Moist and such tasty flavoring! The Seoul Sassy is like the typical Korean wings flavoring except amped up! Better then any sauce I've ever had before. I'm not a big fan of wings due to the bones so I MUST come back and try Jessica's Super Strips."
"With a thousand reviews already posted I'll keep it brief.  If you haven't been to Crisp, you haven't experienced what chicken can be.  I got the half chicken with BBQ sauce, and it's so good I wanted to eat the bones!  The fries are mediocre and not really worth the stomach space, their soda selection is well above average, and the various bowls on display looked really good.  This is the sort of place that's worth an hour drive, but thankfully I live one mile away.  I will be back soon and often.  Go, go now!Update:I went back and got the bad boy buddha bowl.  I added beef for just $1 extra and there was a lot of it.  The portion was huge!  I ate there to be sure the hot was hot and the cold was cold.  They serve it in what is basically a metal mixing bowl, full to the top with goodness.  Carrots, corn, fresh spinach, mushrooms, bean sprouts, zucchini and cucumbers which were both pickled, and Korean radishes over sticky white rice with a sauce and a fried egg on top.  I went in thinking a mainly veggie dish couldn't be that filling, but this was like a Man vs. Food challenge.  Thank goodness I had a mile walk home to burn some of it off.  I really couldn't be happier with this place."
"Solid wings.  Like the sauces...I was spoiled by BBQ Chicken in Arlington Heights.  I know that sounds so weird since BBQ wings is in the burbs, but that joint had the most ridiculous Korean wings in the history of man.  Sadly, many will never know... I mean the batter on those wings were just incredible.  They've moved on... *tear*Now I'm back on the search for the best Korean wings... I'm not satisfied yet... But.. Crisp is good.  Bowls are good.  Definitely get wings AND a bowl."
"YUMMMM.Fantastic wings! Especially the spicy barbecue. The rice bowls are good too. The prices are a little high but you definitely get what you pay for in the form of extremely high quality delicious korean fried chicken!They have a pretty decent special Monday-Thursday which is around $20 for two people (could be for 3) and includes a full chicken, in up to 2 different sauces/styles, with sides and 2 drinks.Only downside is if you are dining in this restaurant is pretty small and it's usually difficult to find a table."
"Thanks to this place, I'm considering joining a gym.I have been here twice and both times it was great. On my first visit, I decided to get a whole order of wings with seoul sassy sauce and a baby buddha bowl. Way too much food, but it was really good. Seoul sassy was flavorful and sweet. The baby buddha was great. Nice mix of vegetables - spinach, bean sprouts, carrots, and zucchini with chicken, rice, sauce, and a fried egg. It was perfect size for one person either for lunch or dinner. I couldn't finish my meal, so I took the rest home. On my second visit I decided to stick with the bowls and got the original bad boy buddha, which is the same as the baby buddha but with more vegetables. Great meal. Definitely plan on being a regular here."
This is my favorite place for wings!1. HuGE wings and delicious2. Portion worth the price3. Fast service4. good for take out or a causal sit down.I've been back and I am going back there soon.
Enough said the wings were amazing! Seoul Sassy are by far the best sauce among the all the great tasting wing flavors. Great Korean version of chicken wings. Perfect place to just drop in and eat a food favorite my fellow wing eaters.
"Nothing too special about their bowls, but the Seoul Sassy chicken wings are to die for.  They are crispy and crunchy and practically melt in your mouth.  Best when hot and fresh and definitely not as good the next day microwaved.   I don't live in Chicago, but I still think about it sometimes..."
"Oh my god! The wings were huge! My friends and I definitely over-ordered, but we were happy to bring the wings home to save and eat for another day. The Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ were our favorites. They were crispy, juicy, and full of flavor. Usually, my friends are extremely picky with chicken wings, but they all loved it! However, the O-Rings were highly recommended by the servers, but they were not very good."
"Comfort food TO THE MAX!I came here to visit with some friends and it was delicious. Just the way Korean fried chicken should be. We got the $19.99 deal with the whole Sassy fried chicken and 2 sides (fried mushrooms and something else that's supposed to be healthy. I think we got the greens.) A note on the sides: fried mushrooms -- little pockets of fried deliciousness.The chicken was perfectly crispy and I could probably eat this forever.I hear really good things about the bibimbap and the buddha bowls, so don't discount those!Great neighborhood joint and crave-alicious place to go when you just want to eat til you fall asleep."
"LOVE this place! It's a tiny place so it's always difficult to find a spot to sit down at. But totally worth sharing a table with strangers for this deliciousness. I like their seoul sassy sauce on the chicken wings. They have some spicy sauce on each table that is amazing on the wings or fries. I've been told it's a cheese sauce, but it tastes like mayo to me. Their bowls are also good- rice with meat and veggies."
"Get the fried chicken! Pick the spicy option if your item calls for a sauce selection and you'll be delighted. The meat items are where it's at here. The Bad Boy Buddha bowl is certainly huge, delicious, and loaded with 8 different kinds of vegetables, but I need meat with my rice! I first came to Crisp hearing that it was a Korean place, but it seemed pretty Americanized me to overall. The Buddha bowl I mentioned before has classic items you would see in an American salad... just on rice instead of lettuce. Where's the Bok Choy at!? It's not here! In addition to the bowls they have a few sandwiches and appetizers to choose from. Prices are fair and the place itself has some charm to it since it's a bit on the smaller side. Personally I liked the various music playing in the background. There's nothing like eating some Korean-style food to some Warren G. The surrounding area is fun with lots of other places to choose from too."
"There are only so many capacities in which I will eat fried chicken. One of those capacities is not riddled with sobriety. Another capacity is this wonderful locale nestled like a baby chick just south of Wellington on Broadway. I have brought my family here, dates, anyone and everyone that I feel needs to experience how tasty these Buddha blessed wings are.A poignant statement was uttered in the back of Bobtail one day during a break-induced bender of Crisp chicken about how the chicken may not be the highest quality. However! This critique was complimented by the ring of all of the various Crisp sauces surrounding everyone's mouths. Each and every one of the sauces is so incredibly unique but absolutely addicting. I would eat it cold, warm, pipping hot, maybe even scalding. Coupled with some onion rings and Alison's Atomic sauce spells doom for any type of productivity regarding the scooping of ice cream or entertaining whoever I brought to this magical place.I also have no shame in putting the Crisp bowls in my mouth. The mixture is incredibly interesting since some of the ingredients are hot (the rice, protein of choice, the egg) while the other ingredients are cold (spinach, carrots). Swirling it all together is my go to method, but I'm sure you can eat everything individually if you like. I don't care; just get that bowl in your mouth!Make sure you take notice of a tall, handsome employee there that is clearly Irish. He holds a special, figurative place in my heart, opposed to the chicken whose presence is both figurative and literal."
"Though it used to be better, oddly, when the owners were much more discombobulated, this is the best fried chicken in Chicago, rivaling even Harold's Chicken shack and specialty places. Get the Seoul Sassy wings with some fries and atomic sauce on the side."
"Best wings i've ever had, hands down.  Tender and juicy on the inside, CRISPY and flavorful on the outside.  I can't believe I had never been to this place.  Get the food to go or you might have to wait a while for a table, the place is pretty small."
"Um, how am I JUST now discovering the TRUTH that is Crisp's fried chicken?GOT DAMN! I tore that isht up like I was Daryl Hannah fiending for lobster. After my rocky start with Crisp, I became a fan after chowing on the deliciousness of their burrito offerings. I found a winner and wasn't in any hurry to change my usual. Well, yelpers are a persistent bunch and loads of people raved about the fried chicken. I was dubious. I'm from Kentucky, for goodness sake. Bluegrass babies are given drum sticks before we're given mother's milk. I have been to the Colonel's original place, his wife's place and one of his descendants is one of my good friends. I know from fried chicken and don't impress easily.I was in the mood for chicken and needed something fast and easy. I was nearby Crisp and thought I'd check it out. I thought I might like it. I wasn't prepared to sing Color Me Badd to it while I turned down the lights. It's everything people described: succulent, sweet, slightly hot, meaty, plentifully portioned. A half order left my belly distended and dead sexy, my mouth covered in sauce and my virtue stripped. I can't imagine what a whole order would do to me.I think I'll find out."
"Hey! Crisp! Me and the lady were out in the neighborhood having some afternoon beers, and she suggested trying out a new korean wings place in the neighborhood. I, always game, agreed. We went to Crisp, conveniently located a half a block from the bar we were at (where we met an entertaining dog that growled at all small wheels--skateboards, rollerblades, rolling suitcases, and nothing else).We got 10 wings, two types, Sassy Seoul and the BBQ, and were surprised that these were full double wings, or 20 ""wingettes"". Not deterred by our upcoming dinner plans, we ate them all... because they were DELICIOUS. And then we were really full. For a long time.Five stars. Will come back for sure for more wings, and to try the bibimbap."
"Andrew H. is a man wise beyond his years. I agree with his review of this funky restaurant. We focused on the chicken wings, which were mammoth and smothered in a sauce that made us thirsty for the next 5 hours. A little pricey, I thought, but still I am glad we tried it."
"Forget BW3's or wingstop....even Jake Melnick's. This place has the best wings in Chicago, Hands down. Order the half bird (spicy bbq) and maybe a side as well. Quaint little place with picnic tables and a fun atmosphere."
Lived overseas in Korea for 5 years. This place made my heart sing. It's Korean with a delicious American twist to some items.  So good.
"AMAZING WINGS, coated perfectly, breaded perfectly, cooked perfectly, ""sauced"" perfectly.  I love this place and it's BYOB.  SIX STARS."
"The only reason I give this a one star is because of customer service. I ordered from there over the weekend, my order was incorrect and they refused to send out another driver with the right order unless I were to pay the $3 delivery fee....again. After a 20 minute phone call, we gave up and told them to keep it. I would never go again. Note: the food we did receive was good, so if you are ok with horrible customer service, this may be the place for you"
"I freaking love fried chicken. Like I could eat fried chicken for breakfast, brunch, lunch, linner, dinner, and dessert. When I heard this place had epic fried chicken, and that it was KOREAN style fried chicken, I obviously had to check it out. Crisp....you did not disappoint. This $#*&% was bomb.We got the Seoul Sassy and the classic BBQ style chicken and it was insanely good. The Seoul had the perfect mix of sweet and ginger spices and the BBQ was sweet and smoky perfection. Basically, the chicken was cooked like a G6. If you like fried chicken or if you like food in general, try this freaking place. Boom!"
"so, after my first attempt last year, i had a chance to give this place another shot, mainly because my friends were raving about chicken in here. surprisingly, this time chicken pieces were not huge turkey sized old chicken, it was normal sized chicken, and had no foul aftersmell and taste of old chicken as it did on first attempt. sauce was good as it was last time.pretty good."
"Went here with my roomie for a quick and casual dinner before a night out. Read via yelp that it is Korean tradition to have beer with chicken, so we made sure to bring some cans of Revolution! Anyway, for 2 girls we split 5 wings (2 BBQ, 3 Seoul sassy) and a baby buddha bowl. We were stuffed with 1 wing leftover. Got there around 6pm on a Saturday, and the only seats were in the middle of one of the 6-seat benches. Definitely be prepared to share a table! Will definitely be having the wings again, probably takeout though. Really fun vibe, and super nice employees even though the place was crazy packed."
"I really really enjoy their jumbo fried chicken wings, they are incredible and the sauces are deliciously spicy. I also like their buddha bowls, I usually get the original bad boy buddha. However, the last time I visited there the food tasted almost kind of old. It was only one bad experience and will certainly not stop me from indulging in their wings!"
"Very decent chicken strips dipped in delicious, tangy sauce that is not too spicy. Whenever I order a Buddha bowl, I am surprised by how full I get from the fresh vegetables."
Great change of pace wings.   The mild wings were delish as were the seoul sassy wings.   We also tried a bowl but quickly realized that we got the most boring bowl we could have gotten (the steak bowl).   It was good but plain after a few bites.   We have made a promise to come back so we can try what the bi bim bop bowl that everyone in the know was eating.
"i'm a fan, and don't eat here nearly enough! you definitely have to be in the mood.but their wings are phenomenal!! seoul sassy is great but i can't eat too much of it (too saucy) - but their other flavors are damn good too. lots of meat, lots of crispyness but not too fried, lots of flavor. if you want wings, i wouldn't bother going anywhere else.the bowls are great too, but i'd stick with wings fo sho. (at least the first stop)great for takeout to eat at home with a few friends, or if you're staying there - belly up at the picnic tables and make friends!"
Chicken is aite and  the employees are freaking loud
"My love affair with Korean food began back in Roger's Park during the 1980's. The Pusan House had some of the best Bi Bim Bap on the Chicago scene and they have been the standard by which I judge all other Bi Bim Bap.Speaking as someone who has even gone so far as to eat the real deal in Korea, Crisp is as fair an approximation at a fair price as I've found in Chicago. No pretentious illusions, no corners cut, just veggies, sauce, a little meat and an egg on rice. Dolsot bowls are nowhere to be seen, which is probably for the best because most folks shouldn't be trusted to handle heavy superheated stone bowls.The restaurant is casual, with butcher wood bench seating and a love-thy-neighbor attitude about sharing tables. Tuck your elbows, spread some sriracha or gochujang and dig in via fork or chopsticks. Good food, great price."
"Can't...stop...ordering...if you don't like this place you need to have your head examined.  Everything at this place is great but you need not concern yourself with anything other than the fried chicken.  They put an addictive chemical in it that ""makes you crave for it nightly...""  Seriously, after moving here from New York I was interested to see how it stacked up against Momofuku Noodle Bar's chicken dinner and it was right up there.  PLUS, they delivered.  PLUS it was 10% of the price.  PLUS I didn't have to wait 7 months for a reservation.  So to say I was satisfied is a slight understatement.  What are you doing right now and why aren't you ordering?!?!"
"When I think of Crisp, I think of the first day that I ordered delivery with a visiting resident from Pennsylvania. We ate and ate and did not stop until all the 10 jumbo wings were gone."
"I'm half Korean, but I don't speak Korean, listen to K-pop or watch K-dramas, and for this reason I'm pretty un-Korean.  The only thing my grandma passed to my mom which continued on to me is a love of Korean food and flavors.  Yeah, my mom makes bulgogi, kalbi and tempura for Christmas dinner, so I was ridiculously excited to finally eat at Crisp.  I've had Bon Chon which I really enjoyed.  Their chicken is skinless, and the breading is super thin and crunchy from being twice fried which is really what differentiates Korean fried chicken from the rest.  Crisp isn't really Korean fried chicken - it's fried chicken covered in sauce with Korean flavors.  I'm not a stickler for authenticity, because as long as it's good, I will eat it.  And at Crisp I ate until the point of physical discomfort.As the other 900ish people have said before me, the seoul sassy sauce is very good.  I also liked the crisp bbq sauce, because it was nice and spicy. I tried out the sauces on the table, alison's atomic and buddha bowl sauces, on some white rice out of curiosity. The buddha bowl sauce is so delicious. It's gochujang, which is a spicy fermented soybean paste that I'm obsessed with it.  Between the 3 piece strips, wings and side of rice, we were stuffed.  When I went up to ask for a to go box, the girl asked how I liked my food.  I told her that I loved the buddha's bowl sauce and everything we ate, so she just gave me a side of all three sauces.  Asian restaurants can be pretty easy to judge based on whether or not there are Asian people actually eating there.  Yes, there were some Koreans while I was there.  However Crisp isn't intimidating to people not familiar with Korean food, because the menu isn't full of dishes listed in Korean, the food has an American twist and the staff working the front, from what I saw, weren't Korean.  I sound judgmental, but once a hostess at a Korean BBQ restaurant frowned at my family once she realized all these Korean-looking people didn't actually speak Korean.  I'm coming back here so soon. Like maybe next week."
"I always noticed that this place was packed, so I decided to finally give it a shot and was NOT disappointed!  This place is amazing!  Going you first time can be a little intimidating & confusing.  People are just huddled around the cash register, so you never know if there's a line to order or not.  Also, the seating is kind of odd.  You just have to find an empty chair a snag a spot.  The wings here are incredible but my favorite is actually the chi-town chicken burrito.  It is a Korean twist on a burrito with rice, carrots,tomatoes, corn, chicken, and the secret sauce!!! Haven't had the buddha bowls yet, but that is next on my list.  Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick bite!"
"This place is great. I really like the interior and the ambiance. Busy but very friendly staff. Great service. Now on to the most important feature that we all care about. THE FOODI just have one thing to say. SASSY SEOUL!!! I have had the sassy seoul chicken wings a few times. These are by far the best greasy most delicious fried chicken wings I have ever had hands down. I find myself with the desire to keep licking my fingers hoping to continue tasting the sassy seoul flavor. I mean come on, it is really that great! Trust me. Try it. I would recommend this to everyone!!!Bowls look nice too but I have never had one. Has to be good I am sure. But it's all about the Sassy Seoul Chicken Wings for me! Oh yeah!!!"
"I'm pretty sure me and my friends got food poisoning here (7/22/12). We ordered 10 chicken wings, the big buddah bowl w/ beef, and fries. I've been here twice before with no issues.  Bummer.  Really ruined what would have been a good review.Edit (May 2013): Finally got the intestinal fortitude to come back, and have had a much better experience.  Which is nice, since it's like right around the corner from me. The fries aren't all that, but the wings are good. I'll update my 1 star to 3 stars."
"At the risk of subjecting myself to online harassment... Don't get me wrong, I really loved their wings. We tried the Crisp BBQ sauce, which was fantastic. The wings were fried just right, the meat was tender, I walked away with my face sufficiently covered in sauce, etc. However, we also dabbled in the other half of their menu and went with the Seoul Sensation burrito. The burrito was frankly boring and just downright not tasty at all - I made it through only a couple bites and had to go back to the wings (poor me). The burrito is really missing that kick, that spice, that actual taste that makes you come back for more. The Atomic Sauce that came with it was some sort of ranch dressing-based sauce and just did nothing for it (and for a burrito at a Korean restaurant, I tend to expect a little more out of my sauces). I think these guys have a good thing going with their chicken, and I would stick to that on my next visit. They seem to have a lot going on with their menu - however, when one part of the meal is a complete home run, it's an even bigger letdown when the other part is a complete miss."
I really liked Crisp. Me and my boyfriend both got rice bowls and were really pleased. I saw the fried chicken that other people had ordered and it looked great. It was really cramped in this tiny place though and it was super busy (around dinnertime). We shared a table with a couple other groups of people.
"I am addicted to Crisp! Their Seoul Bowl is my favorite, tho when I added vegetables I didn't like it at all. The Seoul bowl with brown rice is not as good as with white. I am so glad I don't live closer or I would be there everyday!!"
"Not a whole lot of variety in flavors, but the few different choices they do have are perfected. My favorite are the BBQ wings and I tend to stick with a five piece since the wings are so Big! Prices are mid-range,  food is good... I recommended it!"
"Imagine Harold's Chicken.Now. Imagine Harold's Chicken times Infinity.Imagine Harold's Chicken if the chickens were super plump and fresh and cooked in clean oil.And all due respect to the mild sauce I was born & raised on, but imagine Harold's Chicken if someone's Korean mom was in the back concocting sweet and savory sauces to accompany the chicken.Welcome to Crisp!This is yardbird like you've never had before, friends. I'm a wing girl and I could barely finish the five enormous wings I got -- the ""Seoul Sassy"" and the ""Crisp BBQ"". Both are spectacularly good. My mother used to suck chicken bones until they turned white when they were really good and I was SO tempted start sucking chicken bones at Crisp--they were THAT good!Seating is like at Urbanbelly--first come-first serve and cafeteria-style. Make friends with your neighbors and keep the napkins and water going around the table. Crisp is also BYOB, a nice little bonus.I've yet to try the bowls, the Korean burritos or the sandwiches but I hear they're good. The chicken, however, is the clear star of this show. I'm glad I live too far away for them to deliver -- this is a delectable, once-in-a-while treat. Not sure my arteries or my arse could handle much more!"
The cure for the common Buffalo Wing!  Check it out from Hungry Hungry Hinden...Chicago's new hot wing hot spot!...hungryhungryhinden.com/2…
"Best wings I've ever had...and they are huge! The suicide sauce is awesome too. Oh, and the korean bbq beef bowl is amazing too. Great place for a great quick, cheap bite in Chi!"
"AMAZING chicken wings. The breading is so thin that it almost tastes like it's grilled. Yeah I only wish. The meat is so tender, so flavorful that I would even chew on the bones. The seoul sassy sauce is uniquely sweet. My vocabulary is too limited to describe my satisfaction.The baby buddha bowl has lots of rice but not enough veggies. The secret sauce (yellow on the tables) is wonderful. Next time I will definitely get the bad boy buddha.The not so common sandwich is very yummy too. A huge chicken breast, perfectly fried - thin breading, fried twice, and meat so marinated it must have been drenched in seasonings for at least a night. The place is very divey, with wooden tables and benches, and rolls of napkin papers (the very rough yellowish kind, not the baby soft kind) and bottles of condiments everywhere. They also sell popsicles in lots of flavors, and Asian drinks. Writing the above review makes me crave it now. Can't wait to try their whole birds and dig my face in one :D"
Had the baby bibibap with 5 chix wings (bbq sauce).  Adding the special sauce (yellow sauce bottle on the table) to the rice gave it a nice touch.  Totally enjoyed my meal!  Next one is going to be hard to beat.  Great work guys!  Will definately come back again.  Good thing they had electric sockets around to charge my bike.
"The food was great. The downside to this place is the small sized building. There was a long line to get food. Once we got our food and tried to sit down, there was an even longer wait to find a seat. The tables were pretty messy too from all the traffic. I would definitely order from here again...but as takeout. It was too busy and loud to enjoy your meal at their tables."
Oh my friggin goodness!!! Nom Nom Nom!!! I had the the sassy seoul chicken wings and beef bowl with brown rice!!! I know there are awesome restaurants in Chicago to try but for this short vacation here this was my favorite spot. I love korean food. Loooooove it! My favorite korean chicken is back home in the bay but my friend said these were the best wings she's ever had. I also heart this place because of the brown rice option. I wanted to try the mushrooms but the bill was getting hefty for two petite girls. We couldn't finish our food so we're going to munch on them while watching the Niner game!
"Walked in to a busy atmosphere, but it was fun and friendly. Placed our order, sat at a large wooden table, and our food was ready in a few minutes. The food was good! It was a little heavily breaded, but the chicken and sauces were great! Big portions as well."
"Bi Bim YUM YUM Bop!Crisp is a cute little Korean joint in the busy Broadway street full of multiple restaurants. This is by far one of the best places to grab cheap dinner on a weeknight. They're mostly well known for the Korean fried chicken. But ATTENTION VEGANS n VEGETARIANS!! There's options for us too. Not many, but a few really good ones.  I'm a die hard fan of their bi bim bop bowls and you will be too, when you try them. They're healthy, filling and a great value for the buck."
"My friends live by yelp and said I had to come here.  Having come from LA and eating ""true"" korean food, I really couldn't get excited for korean fried chicken here.  We had the regular sesame soy sauce and the korean bbq sauce.  Some of the chicken was overcooked and tough, the skin had a nice crisp developed to it and the sauce was ok.  Overall, just decent, but just pales in comparison to the chicken I've had in the past."
Great Fried Chicken. Try the Seoul Sassy sauce with your chicken.My only gripe is that there are too little seats and its always crowded
"Their chicken is average.  Nothing special about this place that  makes me to come back.  I felts like I had a chicken with more bone and meat.  The flavors here for the chicken didn't stick out.  The service was great though.  Very nice people working the registers, though.  I just had much better chicken out there for dinner."
"The reputation this place has is well deserved!!!!I saw they were apart of Yahoo's Best Chicken in America article and my buddy An raves about this place so it was a must that I try!Sort of small, but definitely bigger than what it looks like from the outsideI have been twice thus far and each time my life has been changed (not really)The first time around I tried the Crisp BBQ and its just as sweet as it is spicy. I got it as a combo which came with fries and a drink of my choice. A couple walked in and asked if the chicken was good. I told them to look at my plate and if they sat next to me it would not be a pretty site. They gladly rushed to get their order.The next time around, I got the Seoul Sassy...Very sweet and delicious!!!I broke those wings off something proper-like (Dr. Dre - ""Chronic"" terminology). Seating is basically sit where there is space available. Everyone has to be comfortable sitting across from strangers when coming here...not a bad thing.If you like wings, definitely a must try!"
"Big thanks to An for scheduling this perfect Bears halftime chow fest! I have had my first wing people, and I llllllllliked it. If Pterodactyls still existed, I would have been eating their wings at Crisp. ""Jumbo"" sounds small in comparison to how large these wings are. I can sleep happily tonight, knowing those chickies must have lived a long life to grow that size. I ordered the Seoul Sassy sauce because marketing was designed for people like me and I loved the name. Don't judge. I'm only saying what everyone else knows and won't admit. The sauce is a fantastic blend of ginger, soy, sugar and scallions and I wish I had a side of it to dip other fried things in. The wings were plump, juicy on the inside, crispy crunchy delicious on the outside and gone by the end of halftime. Five were enough to make me feel like I could explode. In fact, I think I cleaned my little birdies better than some of the boys at the table! Since Crisp is a block away from my current apt. and the one I'm moving into next week, I'll be here frequently, hopefully not sitting by myself at the communal tables, guzzling root beer and showing grown men how eating chicken wings is done!"
"Ho Shit, these wings are amazing.Seriously. I usually take hyped up places with a grain of salt, and whenever people keep telling me things are awesome I end up being overly critical and they end up sucking (see also: the movie Garden State), But Crisp lives up to the hype and then some. Much like the rest of you, I am convinced there is crack in the Seoul Sassy sauce because hot damn, that stuff's good!  A group of us met up here and we all got some combination of Seoul Sassy or BBQ/spicy wings. Now, look at my nickname on here, you'd think I'd get spicy, but I had to try the sassy sauce.  I ended up adding some sriracha on it, perfection. I tried the spicy BBQ with sesame seeds,and while they're good too, SEOUL SASSY 4 LYFE. Usually a chatty bunch, everyone devoured their wings in silence and kept getting more napkins. Then we all had to go wash up, and they even have awesome aloe lotion in the ladies bathroom which made my hands nice and soft. Great touch."
"My husband and I came here after working out at the LVAC. We wanted to eat the healthier options so we avoided the fried stuff.We shared the Seoul Steak bowl because it was so big. It was really good especially with the Seoul Sassy Sauce and Buddha Sauce mixed with it.The only reason I took off one star is because there's not efficient seating space. They have these huge wooden tables but some people put their stuff on it (i.e. purse, Redeye paper, etc) so you can't sit enough people. Also the place needs to turn up their AC because it actually felt hotter inside the restaurant than outside."
"On a re-review I'm going to give this place a 5/5. If you're coming here, it's for their fantastic Korean fried chicken or wings! No one does it better. Their sauces are amazing, it can get cramped, but if you know what you're getting into (inexpensive, communal style wings eating), then you're not going to find a better Korean wings place."
"I'm sweating chicken grease, have the shakes, and can't stop licking my chops. I am coming off a serious chicken bender this weekend thus my withdrawal symptoms. I am embarrassed to admit that I ate Crisp's Seoul Sassy chicken twice in one day. I went for lunch with a friend because we'd both never tried the food but always heard great things. I ordered the half chicken with the Seoul Sassy sauce thinking that would be a lot of food and I'd take some home. I laugh at my naivety now because the thought of leftovers is just ridiculous. I inhaled all of that chicken. All of it. Since it was so good, and since I have limited self control when the discussion of dinner came up later and Crisp was thrown out again, I hesitantly agreed. Hesitant because I didn't want to go back there and let them know of my new Crisp addiction/problem! I needed a costume with a fake nose and mustache! This time however, I did not eat all of my food and really did have leftovers. Whew. The following day I ate KFC but that's a tale for another day because the star here is Crisp. After this weekend if the saying were true that you are what you eat then I'll cluck away and you won't have to ask why this chicken crossed the road- it was for more Seoul Sassy of course!"
"Crisp is not just your ordinary chicken.  We have eaten there twice now and have tried Crisp BBQ, Seoul Sassy and Plain Jane.  My favorite is the Crisp BBQ.  It is so delicious and it is spicy.  Seoul Sassy is great too.  The taste is so unique and a must try!  Plain Jane was just what it says - plain.  I wasn't a fan especially after trying the BBQ and Seoul Sassy.  I will definitely go back to Crisp.  They have a check in deal right now which is pretty good - $19.99 for a whole chicken, 2 sides and 2 sodas.  Awesome!"
"I have been frequenting Crisp for nearly two years now, and I can say without a doubt that they are among the best chicken spots in the city. I would highly recommend the Seoul Steak Bowl, a mix of Korean Beef and Rice. I like to upgrade to the Organic Brown Rice for an extra $1.50. And ask for extra Alice's Atomic Sauce. If you're looking for wings, they have a pretty good deal where you get a full chicken, a side, and two drinks for somewhere around twenty bucks. Once again, I would recommend that you get at least half of the chicken in Seoul Sassy. And get some Alice's Atomic Sauce.And the final check mark in their favor...BYOB! Although if you are eating in, you better be prepared to get a little cozier with a stranger than you originally intended. But it's worth it."
"The wings here are the shitake. Seoul and sassy and Spicy BBQ are a must.You dont need to order anything else in my opinion. get wings, eat them, orgasm, then clean up your mess and leave.  Crisp i wish you were a woman."
Love their Seoul and Sassy!
"Why did the chicken cross the road? I'm pretty sure he was just doing a little cardio. Chickens are real muscle heads apparently. How else do you explain the size of the wings at Crisp?! Love it. Going off of all of the reviews before me and the testimonial of friends, I was tempted to try the Seoul sassy wings. Everything they say is true. Everything. I'm not usually a sweet and savory together gal, but for some reason this combo worked great for the wings. A nice mix of sweet, savory, and crispy. My boyfriend got one of the steak bowls and it was huge! He was afraid it would be full of veggies (gasp!) and hardly any meat...he was wrong. Overall we both walked out extremely full and happy. Of course i'm going back! If I lived close enough I might be typing this while balancing a basket of wings on my lap."
"Man, Seoul Sassy ain't no joke...that's the money sauce!!! Mix it with some fried chicken..oh boy.  I workout all week so I can eat this on my cheat day...just saying."
"I was recommended to this place by a coworker, and it definitely did not disappoint! The portions are HUGE, so you definitely get more bang for your buck. Since it was my first time trying the place, I ordered a bowl and wings and had more than enough for 2 full dinners. The Seoul Sassy sauce was addicting on the ridiculously huge wings. I went ahead a tried the chicken bowl, as well. This was so simple, and definitely satisfying. I plan to take my brother here when he visits!"
"After reading a lot of reviews on here, I decided to go with the popular vote: Seoul Sassy Chicken Wings.The chicken was dry, and the sauce was too sweet. I think maybe the dryness of the chicken may have altered the flavor a little bit. However it was simply okay, nothing I'd go crazy for :/  The pieces were pretty big so it was also kind of tedious to chew all that dry meat.Sorry Crisp, this place just didn't do it for me."
"Sometimes I randomly crave their Seoul Sassy chicken.  Crisp is probably hands down my favorite restaurant in the city.  I'm from Hawaii, so I'm really judgmental of Asian food.  The only other equivalent to the Seoul Sassy chicken is the Korean Fried Chicken from Zippy's in Hawaii, and let's face it, Crisp might be better and is so much closer.  I love this place because it has great food, especially for the price.  Everyone who has eaten at any Korean restaurant knows that Korean food is not cheap.My boyfriend and I usually split the whole chicken combo for $19.99 (comes with 2 cans of pop and 2 sides).  It's perfect for sharing and sometimes we'll have enough for one lunch the next day."
"Crisp is excellent, but there are some key things you should know before you walk in. Observation the First: The menu is made of two main items, Fried Chicken and ""Buddha Bowls"". The Fried Chicken is incredible, I recommend the Korean Style. The Buddha Bowls are excellent for Asian comfort food. Meat/Tofu is extra, otherwise the bowls just come with just the rice, veggies, and a fried egg. Second: Cash only, they have an ATM inside but it charges a fee. Expect to pay $8-$15 per person. Third: The fries are not that great. I'd say skip them.Fourth: The menu is not on the TV screens above the cashier, I remember my first time here I was looking at some random Karate movie and America's funniest home videos waiting for a menu to pop up. I no doubt looked like an idiot, but whatever. The menus are printed and are on the counter where the cashiers are.Fifth: The hot sauce is NOT the red one, it's the pinkish one marked ""Aly's Atomic Sauce"" and it's excellent, this caught me off guard my first time. Fifth: It's expected that you bus your own dishes."
"Have only ever tried the various bowls and wings. Both delicious and really cheap for the amount of food they are. I don't know what's in the magical sauce they include with all of the bowls, but it's just that: magical!"
"This place rocks!!! I loved it! Went here for the very first time and left extremely full, happy and with next day leftovers. We got the entire chicken order of seoul sassy and crips bbq flavor and of course, the SEOUL sassy, takes the prize as it was mouthwatering, finger lickin good, with a tangy, sweet, spicy, one of a kind sauce. And the chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. Don't get me wrong the crisp bbq was also good, more on the sweeter side, but not as scrumptious as the sassy sauce. We also got a buddah bowl w/ steak to share which was very good with all the fresh veggies, rice, tons of steak bites and a egg on top! Totally different, but definitely delicious and makes me want to try other Korean dishes. The only issue is that we didn't love the community style benches, but that won't stop us from coming back!! BRING CRISP to the BURBS! you will do well :) Our friends and I will not disappoint in bringing constant business :)"
"Go here for the wings, not typical Korean food.I've had the regular Korean dishes (bi bim bop, etc). They are pretty mediocre / middle of the road.For wings, get the Seoul Sassy sauce. It's really, really good. BBQ sauce is second best, and stay away from the Buffalo."
Decent chicken but more of American flavor. ToreOre inside the Super Hmart in Niles has more authentic and better Korean style fried chicken.
Seoul sassy..that's all I have to say.  It's delicious sweet/salty flavors on the perfectly cooked fried chicken..I don't need to have anything else other than a Blood Orange Pelligrino to wash it down (they have them there)  Definitely come by this place if you're in the area!
"Their Seoul sassy wings are applaudable! It's challenging to work out a sweet sauce recipe for chicken wings, but Crisp (or Mama Lee?) pulled it off perfectly. The sugar, the ginger, and the soy all hit the right notes, and I simply couldn't stop devouring. Oh did I mention you can get 5 full-length crispy wings for $9?Haven't tried the other wings or the bowls yet. I'm really curious now!"
Crisp is one of those places that you end up dreaming about and wake up in the wee hours of the morning craving like a lover that you know you shouldn't go back to but jus't can't resist.  Afforadable and each bite feels like a flavor grenade went off.  Crisp brilliantly shows that wings are not just bad bar food and the other Korean delights are grand too.
"The bird is the word: perfect way to describe this place. I got the whole chicken wings in Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ as well as the Baby Buddha, a mini bi bim bop.The restaurant building itself is small and cramped .The seating was also done in a way I've seen at some places in Asia - benches where people not necessarily in the same party sit. Service is also okay, nothing worth noting.For food, the chicken wings were amazing: they were massive and perfectly cooked. Many of the wing places I go to around Evanston never have crispy skin when the wings are wet; definitely not the case here. I guess that difference comes from it being the real KFC. Some of my friends got the boneless wings and looked disappointed when they saw my wings. For sauces, I was not a big fan of the Seoul Sassy. I picked up on the ginger and garlic, but I felt it was extremely sweet. The Crisp BBQ was extraordinary; I felt it had the right kick to sweetness ratio. I wish I had gotten only the BBQ. The Mini Buddha was delicious - a good mix of veggies to rice and was made even better with the chicken from the wings. On top of it was a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg. Some friends got the Bulgolgi bowl, and I felt they weren't worth the price. The meat was good, but clearly marinated in the Seoul Sassy so I did not like it.  Another friend got the burrito which I didn't try, but it looked like it had a good ratio of rice, veggies, and meat.I spent a lot when I came here to try the menu, but it was worth every penny, especially the wings."
This place was great. I'm a chef in Colorado and if I had this chicken joint close by I'd eat there more then once a week.
Sassy Seoul is off the chain.  Wish there were more locations.
"I had a craving for some chicken and only Crisp would do... especially since I was over at the Century Mall, I just had to walk around the block to get to Crisp. I called in the order, very interesting conversation on my part since I didn't have a menu and the guy probably thought I was flaky and he told me so with a mean note on the receipt when I picked up my order. I ordered a whole chicken (NO, I'm not going to eat the whole thing by myself, well, at least not in one sitting). I remembered that I wanted to try the Plain Jane and I knew that I loved the Seoul Sassy. I must say, the Plain Jane really sucked. It wasn't as crispy and juicy as the chicken I had last time. The Seoul Sassy was definitely better than Plain Jane. So it seems that the chicken tastes better when slathered with some sauce. This is not good in my opinion, but who cares what I think, this is one of the top 10 fried chicken spots in America, what do I know. I just know that I will try it again but only if it's saucy, oh and I need to try the wings. Minus 0.5 for the yucky Plain Jane and minus 0.5 for the crappy note on the receipt from Mr. Crabby Pants, I guess I should have told him from the get go that I didn't have a menu, just a craving. We'll see what happens next time."
"Living in the ""south"" I guess I should know what fried chicken tastes like at least.Had lunch here with my sister and sampled the Seoul Sassy and the Spicy BBQ sauce!  Both were really really good... I tended to like the spicy bbq better than the seoul sassy - but everyone wins no matter what flavor they choose.I was very impressed with the flavors... the dining room is a little cramped, but that is a very good sign that the food is worth sitting on top of people and sharing large tables.  Was totally a fan of the bar seats that face outward onto the street.  We were able to enjoy our chicken and watch the snow fall outside."
"Went there a while ago cause a friend recommended it.  I ordered the Seoul Steak Bowl and let me say it was pretty delicious. There was more than enough for me to save half and eat later as a separate meal.  I liked the Atomic Sauce, it had a nice kick.  I was hesitant to try the Atomic Sauce because it looked like it had a creamy texture, almost looked like Thousand Island dressing, though it was actually pretty tasty and complimented the bulgogi excellently. I really liked the place.  The seating is communal, so if you have a big group, you may have to split up if seating is packed."
"Tasty, but not bonchon (ny, Boston, va, etc.). The pieces are too big, which makes the meat tougher and more likely to get that deep fried plastic-y taste. I also recommend that you avoid the radish kimchi. That said, I guess it is the most serviceable Korean fried chicken place I've had to date in Chicago... I ESP like the Seoul sassy flavor."
"Ok-true confessions, and I hate to do this. I grabbed two Steak Bowls for my boyfriend and I a couple minutes before closing. It was like, Yay! We made it! Until I got home, and heard my boyfriend say ""Uh, Katie? What's in this?""There were these gold tinged nodule covered lumps throughout both of our Bowls. At first I was like, ""oh, just ignore it, I'm sure it's fine."" But this stuff was disgusting. I felt like I was eating the inside of a cow's intestine. And the lumps kept getting bigger. I would say a solid 30% of the meat was comprised of these nodes. Ugh. That was over two months ago, and I can't bring myself to go back. I wanted to email them the next day to try to figure out what it was, but they don't have an email on their website. Phoning/visiting seemed a little confrontational (my problem, not theirs.) I don't know. Crisp, I've been your fan for so long, and I sorely miss you. I just can't think of you without feeling sick to my stomach. Sorry."
"Walked in this place by complete accident: I had planned on going to the SOUPBOX. Instead, the fried chicken sandwich board, and a friendly looking crowd  inside, were enough to lure me in. I sheepishly grabbed a menu, and stood on the side. Facinated, I crept toward the exceptionally friendly Derrick and Julia (Hi, Pia :) and fessed up, that I was a CRISP virgin. Intrigued, like that WILL N GRACE episode where neither of them could decide if a mutual love interest was str8 or gay, They BOTH lept in and offered suggestions. They are both adorable and I didnt want to side with either one, so I did exactly as they both suggested. HEAVEN! were the really meaty (read NOT fatty) plump, and THEE most flavorful chicken wings I have ever tasted! I asked for bread to sop up the sauce from the paper, and Julia suggested I order some fries or rings (next time, Pia) instead, I lapped it right up! I also ordered the BAD BOY BUDDHA, with beef and just WOW!  I have never felt so satisfied eating so ""healthily"" (just like Derrick suggested).I was eating just so I could taste the delicous flavors.  I would CHECK PLEASE this place and LIKE them on fb. And Ill def'ly be back!BEST WINGS HANDS DOWN IN CHICAGO!"
"Simple, reasonable priced, and exceptionally delicious.  I've ordered a variety of items off their menu, and have only been delighted at what I've received.The chicken is incredibly crisp and moist, the bowls are reasonably healthy and full of flavor and the sides are up to par with the rest of the menu.A friendly staff and casual environment make this a great place to grab a bite in the Lakeview area."
"I visited this place a few times and they are quite consistent. Their sassy/bbq wings are quite good but a bit overwhelming on the flavor if I eat it by itself. It tasted just right when I accompany it with the baby Bi Bim Bop. For the price, they give a lot of food. Yay!Nice place but a bit out of my way which suck."
"Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute so just sit right there. I'll tell you how it came to be with this Crisp-y love affair...Okay okay, bad Crisp pun. But really now, folks. Crisp is for real.After the many reviews that I've read and the number of times that I failed to get there by their 9PM closing hour, I finally found myself standing in line to order some of the most delicious finger food ever. EVER.Now I've had my fair share of chicken, wings in particular. Crisp takes poultry to a whole new level. Something about the crunchiness, or ""crisp""iness if you will, of the wings makes them so divine...and they aren't, like, breaded or anything. Weird.But that's not all! Crisp offers three sauces. On this visit, which was also my first, my girlfriend and I tried the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. Out of all the chicken that I've eaten, the Seoul Sassy somehow manages to leap over almost all of the competition. It's a simple, but perfectly executed, sauce that consists of ginger, soy sauce, garlic, and other seasonings and is topped with scallions. Maybe it's the familiar flavors [I'm a Chinaman], but it definitely hits all the right spots, and then some. The Crisp BBQ was, how do I say this, unexpectedly hot. It wasn't over-the-top ghost chili pepper hot. But it did have an interesting smokey taste to it. Yeah, smokey.We also ordered the Baby Buddha Bowl with beef. The reviews are a little much on these bad boys. It's a real simple dish with rice, veggies, and your selection of meat. It's really hard to mess this one up...Now about halfway through the meal I began to think about how this review would turn out. I liked the wings, but the Buddha Bowl was just okay. Do I give em a four? Are they worthy of the five star status? The deciding factors were the chicken and.............SERVICE!! The guys here rock. They were very welcoming and offered personal opinions and fan favorites. The Crispy Men answered questions about ingredients and even made small talk to pass the time.Stellar service and delicious food. I'll definitely Check-in again. Until next time."
"Crisp had been on my radar for quite some time and I finally managed to make it over there a few weeks ago.  As with most restaurants I visit, I usually have my order in mind before I arrive.  While I obviously knew I was getting chicken wings, I could not decide between the seoul sassy or the crisp BBQ.  I ordered the 5 jumbo wings and luckily the girl was able to give me half of each.  I actually got 6 wings for the same price of 5 which was nice.  I started off with the seoul sassy and thought how could it get any better than this.  Then I tried the BBQ and thought the same.  These wavering thoughts continued to go through my mind until I had managed to demolish all of my wings leaving a nice saucy smile on my face.  The bottom line: Go."
"Mmmmm...bop! Bi Bim MmmmmBop!! The only thing that I knew about Crisp when I walked in was that it was BYOB and there was a group of KA-raaay-zee bachelorette ladies waiting for me to join them for dinner. I was slightly confused by the menu, because let's face it, I get confused often. I ordered Baby Buddha bowl with marinated beef and wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The bowl is cold, which was a shock at first, and filled with delicious marinated vegetables, meat, and an egg. It's served with a side of spicy sauce! Other favorites from our table were the onion rings with a zippy dipping sauce and the wings with suicide sauce. I ain't askeerd of some jalapeno! I would definitely go back to Crisp."
"I wanted to like this place, but I've been just disappointed twice on buying the fried chicken here. I have bought the plain chicken and the Seoul Sassy chicken. The plain is just that, and you really just get to taste the quality of their chicken seasoning which is just okay. The Seoul Sassy tastes like soy sauce and sugar and is unfortunately forgettable as well(reminds you of those soy sauces you get a take out Chinese places). If this was priced at regular fast food prices, then maybe it would just be a 3 star, but for $9 plus for just 4 pieces of little friend chicken bits, its hard to understand the love here. There are better chicken places in the neighborhood, and perhaps I will try them one more time for the Bowls, that look good on display in this little neighborhood joint. Also, why does a restaurant have brown paper rolls on picnic tables? I thought it was a little unsanitary to watch strangers sharing paper towel rolls with their greasy fingers??"
"As good as the Seoul Sassy wings were, the Crisp BBQ was my favorite. If you like gochujang, you'll kill for Crisp's BBQ sauce that most likely uses it as its base.The wings here are very big. And when they say 1 wing, they mean the whole wing: the mini-drumstick, the 2-bone piece, and the little piece at the end that most people don't eat. Not only that, they have a lot of meat on their bones.Other than their wings, they don't offer much else and the place can be a little pricey.Also, there is limited seating and the tables are communal dining style. Parking is scarce around the area as well.If all that doesn't matter and you're hankering for some chicken, then you'll really love this place.Personal Recommendation: 10 Wings (1/2 Seoul Sassy, 1/2 Crisp BBQ)"
"I mean there's seriously a place this good, that makes wings this good, that makes wings in different sauces, spices and herbs, seriously this good? I can't begin to describe how I was willing to lick my fingers and pretty much anyone else's off with the buffalo wing sauce, garlic spicy sauce and so on. I just can't deal. I don't think I could write anymore details without running out and getting some damn crisp wings. You keep doing what your doing buddy you got yourself a goldmine."
"There are always thousands of Yelp reviews to dig through from all of the different places my friends have gone ranging from the mundane, such as 7-Eleven or Starbucks to the divine, such as Crisp, Zed451, or Wings Around the World.  The first trek of my wing odyssey took me to 75th and King Drive out in the middle of the deep south side to Wings Around the World, where I had the pleasure to take a bite of Sweet Plum BBQ, Cheesy Buffalo, and Honey Teriyaki wings.  Rounding up the weekly lunch crew, we decided last week on swarming at Crisp to let them show us what they had. It was going to be an interesting experiment to say the least, as none of us had ever stepped foot into Crisp.Renowned for their Korean style fusion wings, my wing radar always detected good wings were in the neighborhood with every step in Boystown. Every time getting off the Belmont CTA stop, I lamented that I was so close yet so far. Parking around Crisp was a cinch at 2:30pm this Wednesday afternoon. We entered Crisp to find one other person outside of our group already waiting for wings and ample space all around to sit where we pleased.Approaching the counter, there stood an impressive display of all the various sodas all for the price of $1 with Vitamin Water for $2 including fan favorites such as Coke Zero, A&W Root Beer. Alongside the pop cans were the various house bowls featuring Bulgolgi and Bi Bim Bap combinations with the Bi Bim Bap serving as the main vegetarian fare for any potential non-meating-eating friends. Without any vegetarians on hand, it was clear that we'd all dive into chicken seventh heaven from wings to fully glazed fried chickens to chunks of chicken in bi bim bap bowls.Knowing that I would be getting a full order of 10 wings, I was surprised when they told me that they had more than one flavor for the wings. For some reason I thought Crisp relied only on the Korean sweet and sour recipe but saw they had BBQ and several kinds of Buffalo Sauce. I've had BBQ and Buffalo sauces from all over the place, so I decided to stick with the basics and go with the Seoul Sassy flavors and an order of fries. A can of Coke Zero accompanied my order, which is always a bonus because Coke Zero definitely doesn't taste like Diet Coke.My friends all ordered in lockstep various dishes and everyone had some wings on the way. I noticed the business card on crisp declared their head chef the house master of wings. Was it true? Could these wings be as magical as Wings Around the World? We sat down at one of the large tables and awaited our orders.As my basket of wings and fries was the first dish ready, I had the uncomfortable ordeal of waiting for everyone's else's food to arrive. I could no longer adhere to the rules of conduct of good manners and picked off a few fries while waiting since it was pushing 3 o'clock and I hadn't had a bite to eat all day! I saw some bowls of Bi Bim Bap materialize, a half of a fried chicken dropped in, and another full order of Crisp wings and then realized it was time to go to down!As with most wing eating experiences, this one was no different, the obligatory wing exchange was facilitated and I traded in one of my Sweet Sassies for a Crisp BBQ-flavored wing. All of the wings were properly fried hard and I found the texture of the wings both majestic and comforting. The Crisp BBQ flavor was less than impressive, with a clumsy taste akin to kim chee. There was heat on thse wings, but there was not enough sweetness, but I didn't mind trying one for the sake of trying.After the exchange ritual, I happily dug into my own set of Seoul Sassy and got the rush of flavor that I expected. Sweet and tangy with a subtle hint of spice, the magic combination dazzled my taste buds and even the little pieces of green onion served to heighten the experience. There is something to be said about Korean wing recipes, and there's no better food experience than tasting a recipe that tries to balance out the different taste sensations and savoring sweet success with every single bite.  The portions were massive and I found myself full after eating about five full-sized wings while another friend threw in the wet nap after four wings. In retrospect, taking pictures of all of the food before we all demolished all of it proved to be fortuitous timing.In the end, we had way too much food for our own good and thus went our indoctrination into the wonderful world of Crisp. It was a pleasant experience to say the least, not having fight off crowds and being able to enjoy a meal with friends without having to feel like the walls were caving in. Were Crisp wings better than Wings Around the World? It's a Tale of Two Wings and I don't think that's a fair comparison as they're entirely different beasts. Are mashed potatoes better than french fries or roasted potatoes? The world may never know, but it's best to try it all before it runs out!"
"Anyone that knows me, even just barely, would know that I am a complete sucker for fried chicken. I worship at the alter of Harold's- King of Fried Chicken yelp.com/biz/harolds-chi… . I don't travel much anymore, I live vicariously through eating chicken wings influenced by flavors from around the world yelp.com/biz/wings-aroun… . I have even been the pusher man to my poor pets (a dog and two cats) who now hover like dope fiends around me as I eat my chicken at home. So it is SHOCKING to realize that it took me this long to come try Crisp. When I lived out in LA I remember having some good Korean fried chicken somewhere along Wilshire and Western. But that stuff ain't got NOTHING on the bird here! ""Crisp"" is actually the best descriptive word used as the title for a restaurant that I have come across (though I am waiting for an overpriced Michael Jackson-themed restaurant called ""Bad""). The skin is done to absolute perfection- which is to say, crisp. I ordered the Crisp BBQ and while it was good, the star of the show was the Seoul Sassy flavor... I feel it important here, out of reverence and respect, to only say this about the Seoul Sassy chicken: go get yourself some and see why I am talking as if I just witnessed a miracle.Thank you AJAY crew for inviting me to this week's installment of the Fabulous, Hungry and Unemployed!  Thank you for also showing me the light!  Thank you for letting me eat some of your left overs!"
Visited here 5 years ago and am still dreaming about these wings!! The other Korean wings I've had in California after these saucy and crispy wings have not been able to measure up.Can't wait to visit Chicago again for these wings!
"The korean fried chicken here is finger-lickin-good! Its prob not very authentic, but it is very tastey-- esp with the Seoul Sassy sauce. They have a whole chicken special M-T that comes with 2 sides and 2 drinks from one of the coolers (soda or water) all that for $20 + tax! Awesome deal, enough food for 3-4 people. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because their sides are not the best. The fries are ok, vegetable sides are probable the most authentic (and pretty good), they of course have kimchi. A must to try if you live in the area."
"With wings the size of a turkey leg at a Renaissance Fair, Crisp delivers as one of the best wing places I've ever been to. The BBQ sauce is good, but the Seoul Sassy is really what makes their wings special. The bowls, able to be customized whichever way you'd like, are giant portions that are usually enough for 2 meals. Only two real warnings with Crisp. When going, be prepared to wait for a table or take your food to go. There isn't a ton of seating and lines can get long around dinner. Also, don't let your eyes get too big for your stomach. Portions are bigger than expected, a 5 wing order is the size of a 10-15 wing order anywhere else, so meat sweats are almost inevitable."
"Though this is a small hole-in-the-wall, it's very busy.  We ordered take-out from here.We had Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ, and both were very good!  We also had their BiBimBop, which was both tasty and traditional."
"Crisp has some of the BEST chicken wings I have ever had, plus they are giant. The seoul sassy sauce is a must try."
We had some really amazing sandwiches from here. The breaded mushrooms were fantastic as well. I am looking forward to trying one of their bowls next time. Would definitely recommend getting it to go. This place gets *packed*
"Very tasty steak sandwich! Had it twice already. Not super filling though. They only serve white bread. Would come back to try some bowls.Place has large tables that fit large groups of people, or eating counters for individuals."
"Korean fried chicken?  'Nough said.  But do try the bi bim bap as well, which is quite good."
"Seen this place on Food network and decided to try it on my weekend getaway to Chicago. The atmosphere was shabby-sheik, and the patrons looked more like locals than tourists. The food was absolutely delicious, quick and simple. We ordered the Chicken wings with the Sassy sauce, and the Chicken bowl, which we enjoyed even more with the ""Atomic"" sauce that was provided as a complimentary sauce for the table. Definitely one to try for lunch and a nice escape from the tourist traps closer to the downtown area."
"After months of talking about going to Crisp, I finally wound up in it's delicious embrace. After embarking on one of the most incredible, flavorful food journeys to date, I knew I had to immediately write a review to praise the Crisp Masters. So, here I am.Thanks to the hundreds of reviews recommending the Seoul Sassy, I decided to try it.. My boyfriend and I tried the Seoul Sassy half chicken and the Suicide Buffalo wings. Both meals were exquisite, each bite an explosion of mouthwatering flavors and spices. Everything about the chicken was prepared perfectly. The chicken was so moist and tender, as chicken should be. As a result, the Seoul Sassy brought out my animal instincts, for I felt like a wild beast eating that meal. I hastily devoured my Seoul Sassy, slapping my boyfriends greasy hands away and snarling when he would come near. After all the chicken was gone, I went back and ate scraps of skin. As gross as this may sound, that skin is to die for, so crispy and savory. I am officially addicted to Crisp. I regret not visiting months ago. Definitely one of my new go-to spots in Chicago."
"Got delivery....all I can say is it's average.Come to NYC for some really good korean fried chicken (BOKA, part of BONCHON)."
"DELICIOUS!A coworker and I picked it up for lunch and brought it back to the office.  Everybody at the table was raving about it.  There was enough variety of items for it to have not been a fluke.  There were wings, there was some barbecue, there was a sandwich and some chicken strips.  I had the sandwich with the Seoul Sassy sauce.  The sandwich was huge and tender and flavorful.  The vote was unanimous, we would definitely get lunch again from Crisp."
"Quite incredible! I've only been here once but I plan on making this a weekend tradition especially with it being a BYOB. I was told to try the chicken----arguably the best ting they have to offer on their menu. Woah was it finger licking good. It was about $9.00, but I got five large chicken breasts with some of the best seasoning/sauces I've tasted. Generally, I am not too big of going out to eat to places that serve chicken as an entree, but I must say this is the best chicken I've ever had."
This place is just awesome! I have yet to try something that I did not love. Their bowls are a must have and I always share some wings with friends. Unfortunately they do not deliver to my area or this would be a weekly meal. Small place with limited seating so be sure to come with a small group or take it to go.
"The wings here are huge! Used The Seoul sassy sauce, it was pretty good. They have shoe string style fries. Also have had their plain chicken renders which were normally sized, ate with a hot sauce. I have also had the burrito, which was huge! Also pretty good!"
"Talk about flavor...this place packs in the spices for an affordable, filling meal.  We had the soon to be legendary Crisp BBQ sauced Funke Chicken and a Seoul Steak Bowl.  The sweetness of the BBQ sauce smothered over tender fried chicken makes me think that old Colonel Sanders might want to start revinventing his original recipe!  A slight dusting of sesame seeds also added a nice textural element to the dish.  The Seoul Bowl was almost as good, especially with the atomic sauce on the side.  The rice was cooked perfectly, but don't expect slices of steak.  Rather, it's more of a chopped steak dish.  A few pieces were a bit fatty, but overall the dish works pretty well.  Again, a slight sweetness to the sauce balanced nicely with the savory steak.  The dining room is simple, long wood ""picnic"" tables that you will probably end up sharing if you go at a busy time."
"Great wings, friendly staff.  We ordered 10 wings, half BBQ and half Seoul Sassy.  Five wings per person is more than enough for lunch.  BBQ were flavorful and medium, medium low on the spicy scale.Not being a big spice fan, I loved the Seoul Sassy flavor!  Nice combo of garlic and everything else flavorful but not mouth-scorching.Yum!"
"I hear so many people talk about Crisp, so I decided to finally try it out. I was so surprised how good it was. We ordered a basket of fried wings with a mix of sauces. The wings are so crispy, which I love. I saw that they had the rice bowls, so I ordered one. Perfect!! I was surprised that they had picnic tables, since looking for the right combination to sit at was the only challenging thing.Just writing this review, makes me want to go back for some wings."
"My friends were raving about this place so my hopes were set high. I ordered the buddha bowl, a huge bowl of rice, meat and other veggies all topped with an egg. My egg was cool which gave it a weird texture. The ratio of rice to the fixens was way too much, which then became bland as soon as the fixens were gone. The bean sprouts were way too soggy and the corn was bland. The beef I got was delicious and everything else was fine though.It wasn't bad, I will come back again. But I'm thinking I should order something else, I'll give it a chance. I did enjoy, however, the community seating. It sort of forces you to share in the experience of others. Which to some might be bad but, I liked it. My friends and I ended up making friends with some of the other people around us. But I suppose you don't go to a food joint to make friends.All in all I'll definitely return for the fact that I have a lot of faith that the next thing I order will be good."
"If you go to Crisp, you must get the Seoul Sassy wings. The ""BBQ"" is good too...but you MUST get the Seoul Sassy. You can thank me later.PS. Its BYOB, but seating is limited."
I share the same sentiments as everyone else who has walked through that glass door leading to a world of delicious korean inspired foods. You will not go wrong with the seoul sassy wings and as well as the Buddha bowls (bi bim bap). Top notch food which will make you yearn for the next visit. Highly recommend a trip down to Broadway Avenue. You won't be disappointed.
The best wings i have ever had. I was screaming in enjoyment.
"I'm not usually one for wings, so I got the Foodie's Choice Crisp with seoul sassy sauce. It was far messier than any wings because it was huge, but it was delicious! The interior is odd for communal seating though. You can't see the TVs while you're seated, only while you're standing up to order."
"A rare phenomenon occurred during my visit to Crisp.  I could not finish the entire meal.""It must not have been good,"" you say.  No, it was Korean fried chicken and it was bloody delicious.  There was just so much food, I actually had to throw a little bit away.  I got a bowl of chicken and rice along with an order of the wings. The rice bowl was good, but let's be real- you're here for the chicken.  And I use the term ""wings"" loosely because it's actually the wing and almost a quarter the friggin chicken... in each piece.  Not only that, but they douse it in this sauce that even Colonel Sanders himself would emerge from his grave to lick off my fingers.  These fried chicken place in Seoul almost all serve beer, so it surprised me that Crisp did not.  But they told us this place is BYOB and gladly pointed out a beer shop across the street.  Major win."
the kfc (korean fried chicken) is where it's at. that's all you need/should get. the end. came here recently and tried the bulgogi burrito. nothing spectacular. so moral of the story: just eat the fatty good stuff!!
"I'm been coming here since they first opened.Always spot on and great. Love the burritos and of cos the chicken.I am sooooooooo sad that Yahoo! featured this place on front page two weekends ago and now its ALWAYS packed!!! I went there one day and they even had a sign sayin ""out of food."""
NOTE TO SELF: Order buddha bowl. Some chicken strips. Rent a few romcoms. Don't leave apartment for 2.5 days.
"2 thumbs up! I love chicken wings. Some may say that I'm a chicken wing connoisseur and I was very pleased with this place. Cool atmosphere, great food, what else is there in life? 2 words....seoul sassy."
"Great fried chicken.  Had their weekday special, one whole chicken, 2 sides and 2 pops.  It was great to see their pop selection.  I have not seen ""Tahitian Treat"" in years.  We tried half of the chicken with BBQ sauce and half with their Seoul Sassy sauce.  We chose the radish kimchee and greens for our sides.  And I ordered a small frites.  It was plenty of food for 2 people...all for less than $25.   Loved the communal dining and BYOB option."
"YUM!This was my first Korean food experience and I was very pleasantly surprised!  I ordered a Seoul Steak Bowl and it was absolutely delicious.  Great mix of flavors, and the food was super cheap!  AND BYOB.  It's kind of a hole in the wall, but I went with a group of friends who wanted to catch up and they had no problem with us staying there over 2 hours.  The chicken wings could have been better.  They didn't have a ton of meat on them, but we split 1 order, so I only ate 1 - therefore not a huge loss.I will definitely be back to enjoy another bowl!  :)"
"I'm giving 4 points based on potential, because I'm sure that this is going to be a standby, even though I was half underwhelmed by my first foray at Crisp.  While watching the SEC championship game this weekend, I had an intense craving for wings.  My boyfriend has been talking about crisp forever, and since it was cold and snowy, delivery was the perfect idea. We got an order of 10 wings-- thank goodness I knew they were huge, because they really really are.  Unlike bar wings, which are just the little wing or little drumstick, each of these wings is both the wing AND the drumstick-- plus the wing tip!  So an order of ten here is like an order of 20 jumbo wings at a bar. We got the seoul sassy sauce and the bbq sauce, and that's where we went wrong.  The seoul sassy wings were so delicious I can't get over it, but the bbq just didn't do it for me.  It was REALLY spicy, and while I like spicy, these tasted like chili powder, which I really dislike. So this was just not hte flavor for me.  The delivery was SO fast-- MAYBE half an hour, and the delivery guy was so friendly.  I'll definitely be ordering again, bc there's a ton on the menu I want, not to mention more seoul sassy wings! yum."
"chicken wings w/ sassy sauce, that's all you need to know."
"Came here because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Heard about Crisp on ""Check Please"" I believe. Anyway, when I arrived I noticed that the place was really small inside and crowded, but that didn't stop my mission. I ordered the Seoul Sassy wings and I believe the chicken Buddha bowl. I also told a friend about the place while I ordered who met me there to try out the hype. We both ordered to go and agreed to critique later by phone. Couldn't wait till I got home so I had to cheat and have a wing. It was fantastic, the sauce was great and the chicken was cooked well. I really enjoyed the flavors and couldn't wait to get home to crush the rest. I was a little upset with the bowl because it was cold by the time I made it home and lacked what I had in mind. The wings were still on point and my friend and his family agreed and raved as well. Guess I will have to try the bowl again some other time, but ""GET THE WINGS MAN""..."
"Crisp is a lot of things: clean, efficient, friendly, and bright... it's also very tasty. Furthermore, in the spectrum of korean fried chicken offerings, Crisp gets put close to the top because, quite frankly, there isn't much else around. That being said, they still make a great product and I think the Crisp BBQ and Seoul Sassy are really solid offerings. However, I can't in good conscience give this place a 4 or 5 when I know that there is better out there (namely Toreore in H-mart). I only went with the chicken so perhaps their other offerings seal the deal for this place, but, seriously, this place is called 'crisp' and has a chicken as a logo. Nothing personal Crisp - just keepin it honest"
"Definitely should have consulted Yelp before ordering, because the portions here are gigantic. The girlfriend and I were concerned that 5 wings and a Bad Boy Buddah Bowl wouldn't be enough, so we added a small order of fries for good measure.Ten minutes later, we were gaping at the size of the wings and the mountain of fries that somehow qualifies as a ""small."" We had the Crisp BBQ sauce, which was sweet and sticky, with just enough spice and smokey aftertaste. The Buddah Bowl was also larger than expected and easily seasoned with the soy sauce and siracha that grace every table.We'll be returning sometime soon to try another sauce and to bring some beverages to pair with our meal. Come here with an appetite, otherwise you'll be asking for a to-go box halfway through the meal."
"I tried being a vegetarian for a week and for one of the dinners in that week I ate at Crisp.  I ordered Kimchi and French Fries, both had a stout flavor profile, excellent crisp and texture.  In addition, they give you an endless supply of what I believe to be a mayo/sriracha sauce.  Definitely the place to go if you want your clothes to smell of deep fried goodness."
"so i was always annoyed at how much everyone loves this place since their thing is chicken and i do not eat chicken. enter bhudda bowl. veggie-friendly, delicious and huge. i got the original bad boy bhudda for $8.95 and it was enough for 3 meals. not kidding. so why 4 stars? the stupid names on the menu. i feel like a jackass asking for a bad boy anything. with sassy sauce."
Got the wings. Seoul Sassy and Buffalo. Both dynamite. I will be back.
"Gracious, this place is AUHmazing!!! I cannot wait to go back and try something new. I ordered the Chi Chicken Bowl...It was SO good that I was more focused on the food than my company....whoops! :) It's a quick eat kind of place - Communal style dining with long tables and benches - which is always fun! But my favorite thing about a place like this is when they put the sauce on the table so I can try all the different flavors - perfect!But, seriously. Go to Crisp! SO, SO, SO yummy!! And cheap! :)"
Best wings in chicago? I don't know. But they are great wings. The prices are good and the sides are tasty. I will definitely return when I need some good fried chicken Korean style.
"SO GOOD.  Good price, delicious food.  Seoul Sassy sauce for the chicken was amazing."
Simply love it. Love the wings with bud's buffalo sauce. Bowls have enough that you can have a nice mid night snack.
The 'Seoul Sassy' fried chicken is quite simply the best fried chicken you're ever gonna eat.
"Still a fan... BUT. Yes, that's a big BUT...1. They don't have a wine opener even though they're a BYOB restaurant... That was strange. They said that someone stole theirs the night before we came in. Is this for real? 2. I am never eating spicy wings and drinking alcohol at the same time again. Ha! Ok, this isn't really their fault. It was mine. The Korean BBQ wings are delicious, but be warned. They're a little spicy. So if you can't handle spice, you may end up sniffling with a pile of napkins around your table. (No, that wasn't me. I can handle my spices!).  We'll be back to try their plain jane wings ...without alcohol. (That combination just isn't good for me and I should have learned it when I was in Salt Lake City). Oh, and order a basket of FIVE wings if it's just two of you. Trust me, they're humongous. We were a little ambitious with our basket of ten."
"The chicken.... well we all know that is like crack.  Saucy, sweet, crunchy, juicy crack.What I learned thus far in my trips to Australia is that what they call ""Buddah Bowls"" is just bibimbop.  Marinated and pickled veggies, rice, meat, and a perfectly fried egg.  It is damn good, its the only bibimbop I know of that is outside of a Korean neighborhood.Only complaint, it would be nice if they had the hot stone bowls that makes some rice really crispy and even better than you could imagine.So if you are too full of fried chicken and want a nice complete healthy meal in one bowl... get this"
"BIG WINGS. I went here three times in one week. When you want that classic Asian wing taste, this is the place to go. Service was very good. They made a mistake on our order and quickly came to our rescue and gave my friend a giftcard. THE SEOUL SASSY IS THE BEST. and their bulgogi bowls are unreal."
"Every single item that I have ordered from here has been amazing.  The wings are huge and the sauces they have for them make them taste unlike any other wing I've had before.The bowls are HUGE, probably meant for 2.  They will last you for lunch & dinner.The best was the steak sandwich, a little sloppy so just make sure you're eating it by yourself b/c it will get messy.Anyone that complains about this place should be waterboarded on site."
"Been here twice, loved it both times. It is a very laid back restaurant (I don't know why, but the two times I came here I feel like I see hipsters all the time).  Normally when you think of Korean you think of BBQ. Not here ! They have the traditional bibimbap known as the bowls here. Beware, the portions are huge so if you plan to come alone, I say to just stick with the Baby Buddha. Chicken Wings are fantastic! Not only in size, but in taste of course. I promise this place will leave you BLOATED !I like the simplicity of the restaurant. Nothing too fancy."
"Right up front I'm going to admit that I am germaphobic. So I never (ever) lick my fingers after eating anything really... even fried chicken. However, after having the Seoul Sassy chicken at  Crisp my fingers were all up in there! Its just soooooooooooo good! I mean ... soooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooood. I'm seriously salivating right now thinking about it. *takes a moment*Okay, so since then I have tried their steak sandwich, which is weird and messy but really good. I get it with the cheese and stuff. However, my favorite at the moment is their baby buddha bowl. Its just full of deliciousness. Lots of zucchini and spinach and sprouts and I usually get steak added to it and ask for a side of Seoul Sassy sauce... and then I add a bit of Al's Atomic sauce... and it comes with an egg on top and the yolk oozes down and mixes with everything ... what? Its perfect that way I swear!!  Their onion rings are pretty tasty too. Sweet for some reason *shrugs* but enjoyable... but if you get a bowl you won't have room for anything else... and if you get a half chicken you'll find yourself going back for the other half... I also love that you can get Diet Dr. Pepper there :D that just makes it perfect by my standards."
"Perfect chicken.Keep in mind when you order wings, theirs come as the complete wing, so order half as many as you normally would."
"The place already has its great reputation, so this will echo what most have said: Amazing!  They had a 2 person special which included a whole bird (we had 2 halves with one sassy seoul and one crisp bbq), kimchi cabbage, fries, and 2 sodas a total of $20.  I'll have to say I preferred the sassy seoul as it did seem a bit more korean and the kimchi was very good, as well!  Definitely a great spot for a group of friends, date night, or even flying solo through the week!"
CRISP! CRISP! CRISP! Why I love your food. I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place. Delish! The portions are pretty big. The sauce is the best I've ever had. A fan!
"I finally went to crisp after wanting to try this place for awhile. The guy taking my order was so friendly. I was super confused (I am always confused) on how to order the wings with the sauce, and he didn't even get mad at me. I am definitely going back for their wings. Their bowls were OK, but the seoul sassy wings! hmmmmmm!  I stole my boyfriend's wings and he was not happy."
"So good! We had the Seoul Sassy chicken, mushrooms and fries. Chicken was amazingggggggggggg. Fries were excellent. Mushrooms were ok. Can't wait to try the bowls!"
"This is what you're going to do: Friday night, get off work, school  what have you. Grab a six pack of your fav brew from Apple Bite market across the street. Go to Crisp, get the Seoul Sassy wings and a side of onion rings. The food-gasm will last you the entire weekend/week... until the next Friday"
"Hit up Crisp on a Friday night and surprisingly the wait was not bad at all ... ordered food within a few minutes and had it in hand within 10.  Like others have said, the wings are enormous - and delicious.  Ended up trying wings, one fried half-chicken, a chicken sandwich, and boneless wings (split between four people).  Everything was pretty great, the Seoul Sassy sauce was my favorite.  There's also some killer hot sauce on the tables in yellow squirt bottles that I would like to venture to have in my home at some point.  Would like to try the fried chicken (either wings or half) without any sauce just to see what they're actually working with before doctoring it up.Decent prices, good food, good selection of accoutrements - will definitely return."
So my friends told me about Crisp.  How the fried chicken is sooo good- so I was imagining a fancy KFC or Popeyes.Was I wrong.  I'm Asian. I like Asian inspired foods and I like unique flavors.  And oh my goodness.  The Crisp fried chicken is for reals! For some background....I LOVE Great Seas for their chicken wings (if you know what I am talking about...my review might have more sway with you) - and I LOVED Crisp!I had high expectations going in - and I was thoroughly satisfied! Yea...it's crazy in there...but to me...that's a good thing.  =)  They offer take out too.  My fiance and I split their dinner special - a whole chicken w/two sides.  We got the rice and korean vegetables.  Don't expect a super clean/romantic place. But do expect good fried chicken!I also met the owner...such a nice guy and you could tell....he was genuinely happy that people like his place-
"This is the best fried chicken in the world.seriously,...you need to try it.service is fun and friendly, communal seating and large rolls of paper towels.amazing, delicious."
"Fantastic chicken tenders - absolutely LOVE the sauces with them.  Bi bim bob is always delicious and not so easy find in the city, but I can never visit without getting the chicken.  Tenders are my preference, since I'm weird about  bones, but my husband loves the regular fried (a little small) and the wings too. Seoul steak sandwich is also very popular in our house!SO happy that we are now in their delivery area!  So far, we've never been disappointed in Crisp."
"Ab-so-lute-ly delish wings up in here!  We got the 5 wings and fries platter along with the baby buddha with bulgogi.  Both super yum, but I must admit I was more of a fan of the wings as it's more of a signature dish.  Duuuuh me.  So I was eyeing and munching off hub's wings.  Hey now, what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine. :) i kiddd. i kiddd.Anyway...the baby buddha was great - but I mean, it's bi bim bop - nothing mind blowing, but still good.  I was craving egg so it fit the bill.  I wish I tried the burrito since it's another signature and we literally drove out of our way to get here.  I guess I gotta go back.  Those wings and shoe string fries make the trip worth it.The seoul sassy sauce is def a must to try for wings along with sriracha.  Well, that is, if you like spicy.  For any of the bowls, I would lightly add the sauce as you go.  I started dumping away once I realized I liked the sassy, but by the time I got to the bottom of the bowl, it was overwhelmingly sweet.  Ugh.  So beware.  Oh, and they have the ice cream from those carts with bells that come around in the summer.  Got me a milky coconut, which completed my meal nicely.  wooot!"
"THE GOOD: Tasty, small, affordable. THE BAD: Too much fried food. Need more green salads, perhaps raw salads to offset the double fried chicken. Would be great if their produce was organic. THE UGLY:  Too much oil"
This is the go two place when you are craving Korean style fried chicken and quick korean rice bowls.  Just look at all the pictures.  What you see is what you get...nothing fancy but just good food!
"Saturday night, I called the restaurant at 4PM to check what time they are open until. They say 9PM. We drive an hour to get there downtown, and pay to park and get to their door at 7:50PM to see a sign that reads: ""Kitchen Closed"". I walk inside and ask why when I called to check on what time they are open until they tell me they they ran out of food. They were rude about it.If you want to be the best new reviewed chicken restaurant in Chicago, getting write ups all over the place, have plenty of food because the family behind us said they drove in from the west burbs because they read this place was the best.So, we all read the great reviews, drive an hour to eat, and they don't have enough food and they are rude when telling us about it! I called in advance to see when they were open until - I would have never gone into the city from the north burbs tonight if they didn't tell me they were open until 9PM. Then they are rude have have a rude sign in their front door ""kitchen closed""You have to prepare if you are going to be advertised as the best because people spend their hard earned money to travel to you and when you can't feed them you waste their time and money!"
"Holy Mother of God.  This chicken is amazing.  You can get a whole chicken and two sides on Monday for under $20, what a steal.  The only problem that I have with Crisp is that its so delicious, I cannot stop eating it.  I'm a huge fan of Korean food and while this is not a traditional Korean BBQ I would say it is the best chicken I have ever eaten, aside from my mama's country fried goodness.  Go with the Seoul Sassy or the Crisp BBQ...don't waste your time on the plain.  Not that it isn't delicious but why would you waste your time when such mouth watering goodness awaits you?  The shrooms are also rocking and the shoe string french fries are good as long as you eat them within half an hour.  Super fast delivery and great service to boot.  What's not to love?"
"I've had all kinds of Corean Wings from all over the globe, from BonChon in NYC to Donky Fried Chicken back in the day in Seoul, so I know my wings. And this place definitely delivers the goods.Over the holiday weekend, I ordered up the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ wings and tenders, along with a bowl of bi bim bop, which made for quite a delicious picnic at Montrose Harbor and plenty of leftovers.The owner, Jon Pazona, was friendly and knowledgeable about his menu, and even threw in two free orders of kimchi because it was my first time ordering there. A subtle ploy to get me to come back? Perhaps, but it worked. I'll definitely be making more trips as the summer heats up."
"Atomic sauce is on the tables and the mean guy that usually works the register wasn't there, woohooo!"
Yum!! Love the ambiance and the laid back feel! The sauces make this place and of course the crispyness of the chicken... Damn good! My new favorite fried chicken place!
The best wings in the world.  You HAVE to eat here.
"I moved away from Chicago two months ago, and the Foodie's Choice sandwich is possibly the thing I miss the most. Like, about Chicago altogether, not just Chicago food. Seriously."
"We had the free scout mob deal, which was an insanely large amount of food considering it was free. I thought the wings were tasty with very interesting flavor combos, huge pieces and nice and crispy. The fries were ok, not bad but not great either. All in all a good experience but their regular prices are crazy high for chicken and the cashier was less than friendly. I will go back and try their bowls though, they looked promising!"
"I would always walk by this place going to and leaving the gym (Bally's) on Diversey/Clark.  Every time walking by it, it seems to be crowded.  Then, just last week, my friend invited me to eat dinner there as she was in the area.  Unfortunately, I was not available. However, leaving the gym yesterday, I decided to give it a try.I had the 5 piece chicken wings with a Sassy Sauce.  Very good and very large wings. In addition to that, I also had the Vegas Vegetarian burrito.  Tasty!!!!  My partner had the Chi-town Chicken bowl.  He enjoyed it as well.  The total came to $21.  Great deal for all of the food you get served.  The service was good, the place was very clean, and you cannot beat the location and the prices.  Cannot believe it has taken me so long to get to this place.  Will definitely go back!!!!"
"Compared to other major cities, Chicago lacks multicultural cuisine, or is often late to the game.  For example, few years after LA and NYC went though its korean friend chicken phase, Chicago finally has a place of its own.  These folks to 1 thing very well - frying chicken.  The service can be bit ""young,"" or ""hip,"" so don't expect anything fancy from this place.  The dining room can be bit cramped, so take out might be a better option.  Although Crisp doesn't reach Bon Chon's chicken, this place is as close to Bon Chon as it gets in Chicago."
"The fried chicken is as good as everyone makes it out to be! I always order the yelp special because it's a steal. Seoul Sassy is good, but the Crisp BBQ is to die for. The sauce on the table that resembles a pink mayo pairs so well with the crisp BBQ, it's like a match made in heaven. The only downside to Crisp would be the size of the restaurant. It does get really crowded their and elbows will start rubbing against each other. But honestly, a crowded restaurant means good food so don't let that deter you!"
I love crisp this is the best chicken wang spot ever! isall bout that sauwce!
"The wings here are HUGE.  Kinda like 3 wings in one.  Seriously, I'll take my time eating one part of the wing and put the other part down for awhile and then by the time I finish the first part, I forget that there was a second part, and I think wow, I'm not done with this one yet?!  Anyway, I tried the BBQ one and the Seoul Sassy one and they were both good.. one sweet and one spicy (gochu jang sauce), and both were delicious!  They have things other than wings, but I didn't get a chance to try them.  I'd say based on wings alone, it was definitely worth coming here."
"Who knew that the best fried chicken in Chicago would be can be found at a Korean joint?  Well, it is.The boyfriend wanted to go out for some kick-butt chicken to celebrate his birthday, and he'd suggested this place. I was a bit leery, knowing that the neighborhood isn't the easiest to park in, but figured what the heck. I'm glad we went. So, last Sunday, we headed out to try something completely different.   Parking (metered street parking) wasn't as bad as I feared. When we walked in I was a bit surprised at how small the place was. I'd estimate there were about four large picnic-style tables and counter seating around the walls & front window. The place was pretty full, but we found seating without too much trouble. He got the funke chicken combo (a whole chicken, 2 sides and 2 sodas) and I got  the Baby Budda bowl (brown rice ) with a side dish of Kim Chee (There's a choice of cabbage or radish style). The Plain Jane chicken was great. Just the right amount of spice and very crispy, yet tender. The onion rings and fried mushrooms were awesome and I really liked the spicy mayo dip that came with em. The BF was VERY satisfied with everything too. I was also impressed with the Kim Chee and the portions were very generous. That 'Baby' Buddha bowl was HUGE, excellently spiced and totally satisfied my semi-vegetarian soul. Even the fried egg on top was good. The best part is that when the BF mentioned it was his birthday, they gave him a coupon for a free chicken on his next visit! AWESOME!!! We are TOTALLY going back there."
"I don't even like Korean food, but I really enjoyed the Korean American fusion here!I got the Bulgogi Steak Sandwich. The bread was really soft and the Bulgogi meat was so juicy! The rest of the sandwich was similar to any other hamburger add-ons (lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, etc). I also tried my friend's Yum Yum Chicken, which is a very tender and sweet fried chicken. They checked in with Yelp and received an offer for a whole chicken, two sides, and two drinks for $20. Awesome deal for food in Lincoln Park. Seating gets crowded and you may need to share a table with a stranger. I guess it would be a good time to make a friend if you're not too busy chowing down. They also have authentic Korean sodas."
"Seriously best chicken wings in my life... if you saw my stomach you could see I have a lot of experience in such matters lol !! But really that sass sauce and even the hot sauce is awesome! Huge huge wings... also get some sides of the atomic sauce if your taking out, otherwise it's on the tables if you dine in!"
"The wings were delicious. I got the wings with Seoul sassy sauce on them. They came with large fries. I should have gotten the small fries because the large fries are meant for 2 people. There was a mountain of them! Can't wait to go back! Plus, they have ice cream in a small freezer. I brought the Horchata flavored one. I forgot the brand."
"Summbitch. Seoul Sassy wingsBeef bowlKimchiThe flavor combination on these wings with the addition to the crispiness of it's epidermis will make you say ""SUMMBITCH""! sweet and spicy and HUGE.  These thangs ain't yo' err day chain restaurant wangs.  Just make sure you have plenty of paper towels on stanby =PBeef bowl was big too! Not too keen on the sauce they provided to accompany the beef bowl on it's gastrointestinal journey.  But delicious none the less.Kimchi was made in house maybe? tasted fresh. I was super fragrant and spicy.I feel the food coma just reading this! enjoy."
Best chicken wings in the city!
"Best chicken wings ever.  Crispy juicy yumminess!!!  My fav is the Seoul Sassy Wings (they are huge and very filling).  Their bimbimbap are really good too. Can't wait to go back.  If you love chicken wings, you will love this place.  Trust me!"
"I'm not sure what has happened, but the quality of the food has gone down over the last 18 months.  The chicken always seems like it has been sitting around for a while; it just doesn't taste fresh."
"I have been walking past Crisp for almost 2 years wanting to go in. Why I didn't until a few weeks ago is beyond me! Missed out on 2 years of glorious korean bbq chicken!The boyfriend and I finally went in for lunch about a month ago and immediately fell in love. I ordered the whole jumbo chicken wings and he got the Chi-town Chicken Bowl. I LOVED the wings and boy are they HUGE!! I guess the name jumbo should have tipped me off but I underestimated the size and got the 10 piece meal (should be called 10 lb meal). I was only able to eat three but we happily took them home and had them for dinner that night. One more plus, super cute community seating at picnic tables. Always fun!"
"Seoul Sassy --- bottle that stuff and distribute on the streets, amazing flavor and the service is speedy. Great servings, I normally venture in solo as seating gets tight---but there usually is a good ebb and flow so if you show up in a small group(think less than 4 people) you will be fine!Must try, if you are thinking about it, just go!"
"I think the cook's in the back get a kick out of seeing people crawl out of Crisp due to sheer gluttony. These guys serve up super portions.They also have some killer bi bim bops. I normally dont like them but these bowls are simply awesome. I got the baby-est little buddha they have there and was impressed with the flavor and the amount of content in it. I must say that their wings are huge. I don't know where in the world they find these chickens. I think I caught myself muttering 'for the love of god' as I got my food. They were crispy as the name would suggest and the sauce was not overwhelming as most tend to be.I feel obligated to mention this atomic sauce that looks much like spicy mayo with other drugs added in. Thats the ONLY explanation for the 'atomic' flavor orgy that happened in my mouth on December 18th, 2011. I desperately wanted to steal it but restrained myself from such a shameful deed - others needed to sample this heaven-in-a-bottle."
very good wings
The fried chicken is really good here.  But the guy manning the cashier can get a little sassy if you go in a few minutes before close.
"another restaurant that a lot of people talk about, so i must try and see for myself. its pretty small inside and lucky it wasn't that busy when we went..i ordered 10 wings (5 Seoul Sassy / 5 crisp BBQ), Seoul steak bowl, and small fries.. it didn't sound like a lot of food when i order but once i went up to pick up my food, i realize that is enough to feed like 3 people lol.. the portions are pretty big!the chicken wings was delicious! the skin is crispy even with the sauce and the meat is tender..  the Seoul sassy and crisp BBQ sauce compliments the chicken really well.. the flavor was just right! oh and the wings comes with the drums too!the Seoul steak bowl has a lot of meat in there which is a plus! yet it also has enough rice in there so it is pretty balanced... it tasted pretty good with hot sauce and this ""atomic"" sauce they have there.. the fries is just your average fries.. but the portion is pretty big for a small order..  i probably would not order the fries again and just try something else next time like o-rings or magic mushrooms or something..this place is great and is a must try if you haven't! a little pricey but i cant wait to come back here to try the other items on the menu like their burritos.."
"This place has very good chicken wings.  I ordered a set of ten to go, and i thought it was a little expensive, but then it turned out that the wings are ENTIRE wings, not like at b-dubs.  it lasted my two delicious days."
"Seoul sassy so good.Seating can get weird, had to sit with a tail wearing obnoxious hipster, but the food was good enough that I was hardly bothered."
"I love Crisp!!! One of my favorite places in Lakeview--over the last 6 months, I've probably been there (and had it delivered) over a dozen times!The Chicken Wings are just outstanding--I don't know how they do it. The Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ are both great. I wasn't too excited about the Buffalo Style, but they are alright.  They get the flavoring just right and have such a perfect crispiness. I'm originally from Buffalo, NY, so I take Chicken Wings seriously, and Crisp is the only place in Chicago that has chicken wings that are good enough to make me consistently happy. The Chicken tenders are nice too, but were a smaller pieces than I thought they would be. As for the other offerings, the bowls are good, I like that their bibimbap has a good selection of veggies.  Their fries are pretty wonderful too--you get a pretty great sized basket when you dine in. Lastly--I do have to say that the seating area confused the heck out of me the first time I went, I didn't realize that you had to just find a spot and sit down. It has a nice community feeling though. And don't forget that it's BYOB! Overall, I think their food is mega-tasty, and always makes me want to go back as soon as it is once again appropriate for me to stuff my face with a bunch of amazing wings. Yum!!"
The buddha bowls are basically the bibimbops. They season the vegetables really well. We had the crisp BBQ and seoul sassy chicken wings and they were delicious. The crisp BBQ chicken wings were much better than the seoul sassy ones. I like the buddha bowls with steak and brown rice. Soo good. It's like two meals.
"As far as fried chicken goes, this is the best place I've been to. Large meaty pieces of chicken, great sauces, prices are very affordable, and great Korean style side dishes."
"Best Chicken wings I have tasted in Chicago... and the Bowls, WOW!"
"I had to see what all the hype was about at this place. We ordered the half chicken special with the sassy sauce, with the sides of kimchee and fries. The chicken was fried to a nice golden brown color, but the meat was still moist and tender on the inside.  The sauce was okay, the taste and flavors was very ordinary in my opinion. I grew up eating these spices and flavors so it was no shocker. Overall it was a decent meal, but I would not make any special trips just to come here."
"I love this place! Chicken and rice will suffice but there are plenty of options. The bibimbap is not dolsot bibimbap, but it is decent nonetheless. Few options for vegetarians which complicates things for the wife. But man do they have good chicken!"
"i've been searching for the best bibimbap in the city, and this one came pretty close!the space itself is very fun and communal - i'm one of those weird people who honestly do enjoy dining with strangers.  it's either fun conversation or great people watching.the ONE thing i would have like different about the bibimbap is if it were in a stone bowl.  that would have sealed the deal.  but until i can find a place that has bibimbap as good as crisp's AND serve then in stone bowls, this is my go to!also awesome; it's byob."
"I was so excited to try this place & it did not disappoint! The baby buddha is the smallest bowl I think but still was a ton of food & I wasn't even able to eat it all. I'm excited to come back to try the wings!The place is very small & it was very busy. We were there around 7pm and had to get take out, so plan accordingly."
"Cannnnnnnnnnnnnnnn I get one of these in Naperville?!?!?!Crisp offers up some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.The Seoul Sassy is the way to go, but the BBQ is great as well. Crispy, soulful, a nice mix of spice is what you get from the Seoul Sassy. The BBQ has that same crispness with a bit of tang, sweetness, and smoke.I have not had a chance to try their Korean dishes. However the place always smells great and if they make their other food like they make their chicken, I think anyone would be in for a real treat. I NEED TO GET BACK HERE SOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!!"
"Check out my full review here:thebuckwheater.com/crispSpace:Quite tight during dining hours, but I like communal tables.Service:All smiles.Food:Crunch! I love the sauces, but I've had better chicken. It's good for the price though!"
"One of our go - to spots in Lakeview - Love the Baby Buddah with Brown Rice. Great people working there as well! If you are around that area, you should check it out. The only reason I am giving it four stars is because they have messed up our order 2x when we got takeout - but it is always perfect when we go in!"
"I was in the area meeting friends for drinks at Monsignor Murphy's (don't ask) when another friend and I decided we wanted dinner.  Enter Crisp.  I have been wanting to eat here for ages, but I don't find myself in that area too often and the one time I did try to go, they were closed.  Not this time.  My friend ordered the Crisp BBQ wings and I got the Seoul sassy chicken strips and we split an order of fries.  At first I didn't think I was a fan of this place - the chicken strips were only so-so.  I blame that more on the strips than on the sauce because I loved dipping my fries into the extra sauce in my to-go container.  Then I ate one of my friend's (ginormous) wings.  Holy yum.  The Crisp BBQ sauce is the bomb.  It was not reminiscent of a typical American BBQ sauce (which is why I avoided it in the first place).  It was spicy without being too spicy and packed with a huge punch of flavor.  The fries were fine, nothing special, though as mentioned, made a great vehicle for the Seoul sassy sauce.  I would recommend the wings over the chicken strips by far, but both these sauces were delish.  I'm anxious to return and try one of the Korean bowls, but I don't know if I""ll be able to get past those wings.  Now that's a problem I'd be happy to have."
"Not crazy about the bowls nor waiting for a seat, but these huge wings are sooooo yummy.  Seoul Sassy sauce is my fav.  Love it!"
"Excellent wings! Seoul sassy is a must try! Their Buddha bowls are also great. Their burritos are very large and tasty. Portions are a good size. The service is fast and the food is on point. Overall, the wings are amazing! Love this place!"
"Really good fried chicken. I had Seoul Sassy. The place is crowded tho and if you plan to take out, you should call in first. It takes a long time and there's no atmosphere there."
Definitely worth it!!
"Finally!!! I heard about this place 2 years ago when I moved here and I finally tried it out last weekend. Let me just say that it was 100% delicious and I will be back! The wings are HUGE. They said a 5 piece would be good for one person so my friend and I split a 10 piece (better value). You are allowed to split the sauces for as many or as few of the pieces as you want which is pretty cool. We just got half Seoul Sassy and half Crisp BBQ flavor with a side of plain rice. I thought both were really good but I preferred the Crisp BBQ. Since the wings were so huge, we actually only ended up eating 2 apiece and took the rest to go. Man... I had left overs for like 2 days! There's no looking cute getting it in with these wings so grab some napkins and enjoy! I'll have to try out the other flavors and other menu items, like the bowls and burritos. Everything looked and smelled amazing in there. Mmmmmmm! =)"
"Been here twice and this place is packed. They have open seating and you have to make sure you keep your eyes open for a seat since everyone is fighting for it here. I've tried their Korean fried chicken (Seoul Sassy) and it's sooo good! The pieces are big, so ordering the smallest size will fill you up. I've also tried their bowls, which is also very good. They give you a lot of food for the price. Worth checking out!"
This place is great.  Had the budda bowl and coke along with an order of wings and a bite of friends burrito... Budda bowl was much better than any of the other Asian places around.  Wings were great flavor and size but I hate the full wing set up.Eat here.  Get a budda bowl.  Don't write long reviews....tribune is not going to call you....
"Went in today for my first time.  Wow.  Had the 5 wings with seoul sassy sauce.  Sauce was sweet and tangy, great.  I'm a big guy and 5 wings was plenty.  Total with a drink was just over $10.  Can't think of anything even remotely negative to say about the place.  Will definitely be going back."
"I have found the holy grail of Fried Chicken!  Goodbye Colonel Sanders.  Goodbye Popeye the sailer man.  Goodbye Church....  HELLO Crisp!!!All the previous reviews are right, the dude behind the counter is super nice.  Since it was my first time, he suggested the BBQ and Sassy.  I said I wanted plain and Sassy.  So he let me tried a taste of the BBQ sauce.  He said that I should get the BBQ and Sassy and if I don't like it, bring it back and he'll give me a whole Plain for my trouble.  Can't argue with that logic.  Both the BBQ and Sassy are delicious, tasty, and addicting!  I've not tasted such flavors and crispiness in fried chicken before.  Ever!  It's like my eyes have been opened to the truth in Fried Chicken.  Hallelujah!!!  The side of Kimchi is yummy too!  Sour, crispy, spicy fermented cabbage!!!  That mixed in with fried chicken just works for me.  Love it!!Everyone, buy stock in chicken farms bc I will be back to Crisp for more chicken!!"
"Good Korean fried chicken. Sauce was good. Buddha. Garlic, etc. I like dark meat, but mainly got white. So that was disappointing."
"Yesterday I did a 'bi bim bop' bar day for the crew. I got several trays of veggies, white & brown sticky rice, and a tray of marinated chicken, marinated beef, and tofu. I have some of the pickiest eaters in the world on my set, and I got 2 of them to say 'I love Korean food'!Not an easy task, by any means."
"You know what, I like Crisp.Mostly because I really like chicken wings and they do them really good. Be forewarned, these wings are some growth hormone because they're enormous. a 5 piece order can easily accommodate 2-3 people (with drinks and side in addition, of course). Also the Original Buddha Bowl is tasty and really generous. But they dont make the best leftovers I've learned :/The atomic wings - could stand to be spicier and less dominated by the pickled jalapeño. Then again, I just eat really spicy.."
"Didn't get the wings but the ""not so common"" chicken sandwich was REALLY GOOD!!"
"I walked in here around 5 pm on a Saturday night. Ordered the 5 piece wings, with the Seoul Sassy sauce. It was decently priced at 8.95 for a giant portion, and the service was extremely fast and efficient because less than five minutes after I ordered, the food was ready! Now, these wings are huge and my favorite part are the wing tips, which I'm glad they don't trim off. The Seoul Sassy is reminiscent of teriyaki sauce for me. The flour coating for the chicken is very thin (unlike Harolds, for example!) so it lives up to its namesake. I didn't notice the chicken to be particularly juicy or dry either way, to me it was just good chicken. Gotta love that connective tissue, hey, what can I say? I had 3 wings and were already full, so I would say 5 wings is a generous portion. The french fries are a large portion as well, even when you order a small, and very nice and tasty. I would come back here again, but the dining area is very crowded with bench type seating which is why I only gave 3/5 stars."
"Not much more needs to be said. If this is the kind of food you're in the mood for, this is as good as it gets. the ""Foodie"" sandwich with the Crisp BBQ was fantastic. The fried mushrooms also fantastic"
STILL AMAZING CHICKEN!!finger licking good!
"One of the things I miss most about my old neighborhood, be warned their chicken is ADDICTIVE!700+ reviews says it all!!!"
REALLY good steak sandwich! It was almost as good as the chicken wings. I tried the seoul sassy and the bbq wings. I personally thought that the seoul sassy was on the salty side and I love salt. Besides that thought the wings were juicy and crispy. Yum!**Seating is horrible. You're much better off doing take out.
Hands down one of the best chicken places in chicago. The chicken is basically korean bonchon. I'd recommend the seoul sassy flavor with the wings. I have never been able to finish 10 wings.... Which gives you an ideal about the size of the wings they give you. Also their budda bowls are delicious. I'd highly recommended it. Seating is limited and it can get packed in the small store. This is a must try!!
"You like fried chicken?  You like sauce?  You like other fried things?  If you say no to any of those questions, I will punch you in the mouth.  This is America God dammit, eat your fried things!  This fried chicken is excellent, and the combination with the Sassy Seoul sauce was top notch.  They have a great deal of a whole fried chicken, 2 sides, and 2 drinks for $20, which is even more awesome.  The sides were standard fried fare, like fried mushrooms, french fries, onion rings, ect....  The focus here is on the chicken fool.  FOCUS ON THE CHICKEN!The place has been overrun by a infestation of hipsters, so just keep your  head up and eyes forward.  DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT!  Hipsters hate eye contact....too mainstream.  Just crawl through the web of fixed gear bikes, find yourself an open seat, and get down on some chicken."
Great place. Had the seoul sassy wings. They were unreal. A little overpriced if you ask me but I will definitely be back here if that says anything. Seating is limited and it's BYOB.
I'm salivating thinking about their Seoul Steak Bowl.  This entire dish - from the rice to the meet to the special sauces - is AWESOME!  And it's enough for 2 - 3 meals.  I keep meaning to test the depth of the menu but I can't seem to NOT order this meal every time I visit.  Next time I'm going for the wings.  Those look enormous and delicious.
Big and flavorful Korean style fried chicken!
"My family has been going to crisp since they opened. This has always been our go to place for Korean BBQ and we've always raved to friends and family about how great this place is. Normally I would rate Crisp 5 stars but our past two experiences have left us with nothing more than 1 star. First off the staff in the past has always been friendly to the point of knowing our names and order over the phone or when we walked in. The new staff now doesn't seem to care about the locals or that we've been coming there for years supporting this place. Second the last two times we've ordered the whole chicken we've been disappointed with the amount of breaded bones we've received than actual chicken. We literally had two 3inch pieces in our whole chicken with breading, skin and sauce on bone with no chicken. Lastly, I don't know if they switched suppliers or chefs but the quality of the meat has gone down hill severely.  The last two times we ate there my family all got sick within a half hour of eating the food. I'd like to say my family will try Crisp again but I'm fearful of what we're going to get in the white box the next time. I wish your establishment the best of luck in the future and hope to see your quality and standards go back up to how they were in the beginning.Sincerely,Your neighbor"
"Onion rings were awesome!  (Chicken too, but I think that's already a given.)"
"Finally! I have found a Buffalo chicken worth writing about! After trying Fifty50's ""Best Buffalo wings in Chicago"", I was ready to abandon all hope of finding that right combination of spice and tang in Chicago until I was introduced to Crisp.The chicken itself is moist and tender with great batter to boot! I would highly recommend this place for anyone who is remotely interested in buffalo chicken (or just wings in general).PS- The rest of the menu is fantastic as well, my GF likes the BBQ beef burrito and their own house wings are great too!"
"Hands down the best wings ever!!! Bdubs, Harold's, Wings and Rings, blah blah blah doesn't beat it! I literally said Grace (rarely do I ever) before I ate them because they were that sacred!"
"Honestly, decent Korean food, on top of all that fried chicken crack-ness."
"Interesting flavors, delivery was very quick. 3.5"
The fried chicken is amazing. I recommend the Sassy Seoul Sauce. It has a nice sweet and garlicky flavor that coats the chicken. So good.The only downside is that it is kind of hectic in there. I'll have to figure out when a non-crazy busy time is before I go again.
"Love everything about this place, except that it's too small!  This is my favorite style of crispy chicken, barely any breading and surprisingly very light tasting.  The seoul sassy sauce is amazing and I think if it were up to me, I'd put it on almost anything I ate.  The $19.99 deal for the whole chicken, 2 sides, and 2 drinks is a great deal and definitely gives you a lot of food to eat; 3 of us split it and were perfectly full and satisfied.  My only suggestion to anyone about this place is don't come with a crowd, hoard, or even group larger than 3 people, you just simply won't have enough seats unless your timing is perfect.  On a side note, living near Crisp was a very big incentive to live in the location I do... just go to Crisp already!"
"I don't even know where to begin! After a long day at the office the last thing I wanted to do was cook - but I was starvin like katniss so I got on yelp and decided to try crisp. I got the Seoul Sassy white meat chicken and the choice veggies (I chose spinach, corn, onion & cucumber.) The chicken was crispy and delicious. AND THE SAUCE !! I am convinced it was made by the hands of Jesus and Wolfgang Puck. I wanted to scream ""its so good once it hits your lips!"" on the rooftops but I think yelp will suffice.  Veggies were fresh and crisp with a very light & lovely subtle sauce that complimented the chicken. A little pricey but it was delivered within a half hour and well worth it. By far the happiest of hunger games! I will be back...."
"So. much. food. It's almost epic. The ""baby"" buddha bowls could easily feed me for 2 meals (granted, I'm a tiny person).I got one of the chicken sandwiches, because I couldn't commit to eating an entire half a chicken. It was a perfect amount of food, just enough to stuff you a little. I had it with the Seoul BBQ sauce, which was more sweet than spicy to me, but still a really good tasting sauce. Fries were pretty good - and there's a variety of sauces for you to try!We got the kimchi, which was pretty tasty, and the fried mushrooms for appetizers. Fried mushrooms were pretty delish.I will definitely be returning here when I want a huge meal for around $10."
"This place is a bomb !!!!!!!!!I was surprised at how busy it was when I walked in.I had the Bad boy Buddha with beef. It was delicious and totally worth it.I am so glad I looked at all these positive reviews here and got to Crisp, even though I  had to take a long way there on a cold night.But it was so delicious and worth it.I STRONGLY recommend"
I love wings and I may have just found my favorite place in crisp. 5 wings here feel like 10 wings here so don't overeat!!'
"I hope I'm the 1000th review!  This is like kyochon on crack.  Big, crispy sweet wings that were juicy and meaty.  I split this with 2 other people sharing 10 wings and a baby buddha.  The meals together were really great and yes, can easily, easily be split between 3 people.  There is a wait especially for community tables.  The atomic sauce is good in very minimal form.  Dousing the chicken your your bowl may be too atomic.  Hipster central!"
Awesome huge chicken wings. Sweet n sassy sauce is excellent. Chicken tenders also very good for The Kids
"This place is beyond overrated. We read all of the good reviews and decided to give it a shot. Not only is it incredibly overpriced, but their chicken tenders were a joke. My wife had the Seoul Sassy and I had the spicy. I honestly couldn't tell a difference between their spicy chicken tenders and Pizza Hut's boneless buffalo wings, which are about a third of the price. They tasted the same, looked the same, and probably had less actual chicken. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the fries I thought were pretty good. Save your money and go somewhere else."
Delicious fried chicken? Check. Korean style? Even better!No more needs to be said. gimmethatchicken.
"I was extremely excited to try this place after receiving great reviews from friends. I ordered half the chicken with the  seoul sassy sauce and the other half with the bbq sauce. This place is not bad besides that it was a little too salty. I guess I had high expectations after the scrumptious korean chicken I had in NYC. Everyone should definitely give this place a try,**Update***I went back to Crisp with a group of my friends. I didn't order the fried chicken this time. I ordered their bulgogi burrito and was rather satisfied. Especially considering I walked in with a mindset that everything there was going to be salty (after my first experience). I would recommend ordering the fried chicken in addition to a dish that contains rice. I tried a couple pieces from my friend's order while eating my burrito and found they balance each other well. I'll admit. I like this place a little more now... =)"
"Really, really good. Got the wings and did half and half Seoul Sassy and BBQ. The Seoul Sassy get a lot of love but the BBQ is actually a surprisingly complex and enjoyably unique flavor -- like Kimchi mixed with BBQ. They're not bonchon-style double-fried wings so don't come expecting earth-shattering crunch, but they are delicious."
I stopped eating their BBQ strips  (which was difficult) to write this review to say that it's the best fried chicken strips I've ever had in my life. I had a 3pc of the Seoul Sassy flavor as well. Good job Crisp!
"Most people rave about the chicken. But it's all about the Seoul Steak Bowl, people!Trust me, once you put that tangy, creamy, pimiento-infused sauce over your bulgogi, you will find yourself devouring that bowl like it was the only piece of hot meat left on the planet - bar none including living bipeds!"
"So, Ray from work says ""Have you tried Crisp yet? Great Wings! You got to go!"" So I look up this place on line and order 5 spicy wings and and a Baby Buddha Bowl (cause you gotta eat your veggies you know). The place was full, which means people love it, and I picked up my order from a really really cute little blond girl. The wings were huge and had a great spicy Buffalo sauce. Baby Buddha Bowl came with rice, lots of veggies, with an egg on top. I forget the name of the sauce included with it and I'm too lazy to look it up, but also it was a great compliment to the dish. I went back the next day to smile at the blonde girl and also to get the Big Buddha Bowl with Tofu. I like this place and Hi-five to Ray for suggesting it."
"Three of us went after a friend of mine lost her mind over this place. I got a Seoul Sassy fried chicken and the BBQ one on some strips (because husband isn't the biggest fan of all those bones). It was so so good. The communal seating is fine because there's enough sauce and paper towels to go around. They know what they are doing.The neighborhood parking isn't the best, so I anticipate lots of driving across the city to get to-go orders in my future. I know they have bowls of things if you don't feel like chicken, but why wouldn't you feel like fried chicken? Especially this fried chicken. Get the BBQ one."
I absolutely love Crisp! The actual restaurant is very small and get pretty crowded but the food is delicious. I usually get delivery or carry-out. My favorite is the Chi Town Chicken Bowl - be sure to order extra Allison's Atomic Sauce!
"Good stuff here.  I would venture to say this place is a better deal than the little storefronts they have inside the Super H Mart.  You get more food and it's cheaper.  And you can add fries to your meal...i think someone is after my own heart!For my meal I had the bulgogi on a bed of rice and scallions (i think it's called the seoul steak bowl).  Very flavorful and wonderfully greasy for only 7 bucks, add 2 more dollars for fries and a drink.  I also sampled the large chicken wings and also found them quite tasty.  I'll have to try the bulgogi burrito next time as some stranger next to me was eating it and i kinda creeped him out by leering at said burrito a little too much.Service was excellent as well.  Nice, friendly people."
"Ooohh, this is going to be BAD...I'm craving more already.  I wish they delivered to the South Loop so I could enjoy these wings at work.  I wish that they weren't so crazy crowded on the weekends (and now I know why).  I wish they had some beer in here cause that would be the perfect pairing!  All these wishes happened after I had one single wish:  to finally try Crisp. How many times a month or week do I walk by here?  And never gone in.  Well when the weather turns to 60° in February and your boss let's you off work early, it's time for a treat!  So I decided I would finally get here.And I did - it was empty and the guy working was awesome.  I came in thinking I knew what I wanted.  Then he told me he was going to do half Sassy and half hot.  Sounds good to me!  Get a taste of a couple of flavors!  But will 5 wings be enough?  I decdied no and went with some onion rings too.  BIG mistake.I don't think I realized what jumbo wings meant.  They mean it.  They're HUGE.  At first I was stunned at the price tag for 5 wings - but when this many people love it - it's gotta be worth it!  And the 5 wings were PLENTY.  But the onion rings were awesome too.I can't wait to have some more Seoul Sassy in my mouth.  That stuff is like crack - we all keep going back for more!  I know people that travel far for this chicken -  and thankfully I don't have to!  I'm just down the road!"
Yumo! I am defnitely a fan.  We decided to get the $20 chicken meal and the chicken (esp with the seoul sassy sauce) was awesome.    Will be back for more of that and to try the other items on the menu!
"I really like this place. All the reviews are right get the Seoul Sassy wings, you wont regret it. They are sweet, tangy and crispy.My favorite thing is the portion. The wing are HUGE and defiantly enough for two people.  This is my new place I go when I need a good chicken fix!"
"I was disappointed in Crisp! It's been on my bookmark list for over a year so I had some high hopes.  I ordered the combo for 2 people for takeout, with the full chicken of Crisp BBQ (this was good, not amazing) but the fries were soggy and vegetables were very vinegary and we threw them away.  There are not many foods I don't like so was surprised at this. I would want to try something else, maybe a Buddha Bowl, if I went back because there are a lot of great reviews on here."
So gooood. I went there today for the first time and it is def a neighborhood favorite. I really enjoyed the Seoul Sassy wings and the bad boy buddha bowl. The servers are super nice and out of no where gave us an additional free bad boy buddha bowl because they made an extra one in the kitchen. so unexpected but so nice!!
"Korean marinated Chicken. Well, not exactly but it is sooo good. Their table set ups is a bit weird. I don't like to be gawked at by strangers walking by when I'm enjoying one of my naughty, guilty pleasures nor do I like to sit next to a random stranger on a long cafetaria-esque dining table. Sorry, after high-school, it's just too weird. The flavors are great and the bird is fried to a crisp (hence the name?). Speaking of their bird, it was really big. Good, solid potions are great. You know feeling like you're getting your money's worth but I had a hard time shaking that feeling like what in the world did they feed these birds? Anywho, This place is great to try.... if you're not on a diet."
"My brother saw a review of this place on the Food Network. So we were heading up to Chicago to buy some stuff and decided to try this place out for lunch. Outstanding!!! Some of the best chicken that I have had in my life. They had a Crisp Chicken combo special going that consist of a whole chicken with 2 sauces, 2 small sides and 2 drinks for $19.99. Being raise to look for bargains, this seem like the way to go. We picked the Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ sauce. Awesome!!! Our sides were fries and onion rings. Neither portion was small. The rings were good. The fries, I could have passed on those, but the Allison Sauce on the table made them more palatable. I think that when we go back and if the combo is in play, I will order the Marty's Magic Mushroom or more rings.The chicken was cooked to perfection, not dry, very juicy. They only use hormone free chicken and they don't use chickens that have been stored frozen. There isn't much seating in the place. So if you are bringing a large group, think again. Take out might be the way to go for a large group. Definitely recommend this place. Can't wait to go back!"
UH-MAY-ZINGGG. a little pricy but worth every penny.
"Just to add my two cents as a Korean American:First, I can't comment on the chicken because I'm vegetarian (actually a pescatarian). On the bi bim bap (or Buddha bowls, as they call them): the bi bim bap is supposed to be spicy and a little sweet. However, their sauce is extremely sweet and a little spicy. If you add a lot of it to make it spicier, then your food just becomes super sweet. Also, the other sauce with mayo is not a Korean sauce at all. I don't know why they have it there. The rice itself is somehow lacking as well, in a way I can't describe. On the presentation: It's terrible that they make you pay for your own side dishes. They don't promote the Korean dining experience at all. Korean dining is all about getting a well balanced meal and getting a ton of side dishes with your main entrée. At least the kimchi should be free. Also, bi bim bap always traditionally comes with soy soup, which is similar to the Japanese miso soup. So yes, flavor is good, but you can have bi bim bap as good as this in other Korean restaurants in town (Cho Sun Ok or Sam Soo Gab San are my favorites) and get more for your money. If you're at Crisp for the chicken, you won't be able to get it at other Korean restaurants in town since it's specialized. The only other place I know that has it is Dak on Granville. Which is better? I wouldn't know."
"The Best Chicken I've ever eaten! All the flavors are tasty, but the one that surpasses them all is SEOUL SASSY! Our last visit to Chicago my wife and I stopped in at Crisp everyday we were in town! The Atomic sauce tastes great with the chicken, and on the white rice. My wife and I miss Crisp and we're looking forward to coming back during our next visit to Chicago."
"Crisp!!! Oh how you have disappointed me!!! =( ever since my first visit back in November I thought I was in love! I told everyone I know visiting Chicago about their AMAZING wings and even dreamed about them. I had planned to write a FIVE star review, but now dropped it to ONE =( In the past, I would make my boyfriend trek along with me from downtown Chicago all the way to Lincoln Park without a car to get those wings. However, I ventured to satisfy my cravings today by the bus taking over 30 mins each way to get my hands on the deliciousness only to get back home with wings that were completely DIFFERENT from what I had remembered! Instead of the traditional Korean hot sauce for the Spicy BBQ wings (the ones same with the BimBimBap), I got regular Chinese hot pepper sauce! Yes I'm Asian and I can tell the difference! Beware to check your to-go orders!! My wings were completely different from those that we had at the restaurant! They were soggy and oily instead of being CRISP when I opened the box! What happened???? I am so disappointed and distraught I was only able to eat one wing =( and for the value of 5 wings for $10, this is unacceptable. I may have to stop visiting and find a new wing shop..."
"Buddah,You helped me achieve a brief window of enlightenment.  Thank you very much for your scrumptious belly filling fried egg topped treats...  The buddah bowls are a must for first time Crisp-ers... The bowls come loaded in good vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, bean sprouts, etc) and they are topped with an juicy liquid filled fried egg... Top it all off with your choice of chicken, beef or tofu and my friends, you are in the zone.  One of the best parts of the bowl was the side of Korean hot sauce (Gochujang) that was just the perfect amount of added hotness.  Although the sauce comes in a small container, it has a perfect consistency and it packs a punch.  You gotta try it out in your bowl!What more is there to say about Crisp.  Food comes fast, it's healthy, tastes great, is cheap, the staff is fun, and the environment is really welcoming.Crisp, I will be back and ready to challenge your epic Fried Chicken Wings."
"So, I'm not Korean-Korean, even tho I play one when I want to avoid people, but I do love me some Bi-Bim-Bop.  This place was great and a fraction of the cost of other places.  We also tried the Seoul Steak Bowl, which had good flavor, but is literally just meat and rice.  If you're allergic to veggies, I guess that'd be a safe way to go.  My friend also tried the Seoul Sensation burrito, which he said was solid.  We shared the wings, one set with Seoul Sassy (awesome...slightly sweet and sticky) and the Bud's Buffalo Suicide style (not so awesome...basically a sloppy mess of spicy chili sauce and jalapeno's).  Super friendly staff, BYOB (++++) and good quality food."
"Yummy! Waited over a year to try this place that I heard raves about and it was worth the wait. A friend and I shared 10 delicious gigantic seoul sassy chicken wings and a baby buddha bowl. Didn't notice the option for organic brown rice until after we had finished, but I'll definitely be back. Only challenge was seating. At 7:45 on a Tuesday night, the place was packed, so we sat at stools in the window."
"We were walking down lakeview around dinner time on a weekday and a lot of places were empty, but this place was packed! Its a korean-style fried chicken joint. Their chicken is pretty good, but their prices are even better! I prefer my chicken a little more saucy, but other than that, the flavor is there. We ordered some strips as well as a buddha bowl. The buddha bowl is a lot of food for the price and it's pretty decent. I would go here again because it's close, but when it comes to my bibimbop, I've had better."
"All this hype about some super duper crispy chicken. Let's get one fact straight first, the way I heard it, when they opened, their flavors were Korean style. Once they realized business was crappy, they changed their flavors to accommodate American palates. I wish I'd tried it when they first opened I think I would've appreciated their flavors a lot more. These new flavors are bleh to me. I live on the North side where Korean food is within an arms reach. Seoul sassy was the only flavor that kind of appealed. The chicken was so very crispy, many times throughout the experience it was said over and over by all that I ate with. I wish they offered Soju, since I'm used to having Tong Dak with Soju at Korean bars. WTF is Northside pomme frites? It is NOT prepared like pomme frites, it's freakin' plain style French fries. That's it. I would've skipped the French fries had I known better. Their coleslaw, I'd hoped would be Korean style, it wasn't, it was like any coleslaw found anywhere, another wasted purchase. None of the sides were any appealing and the bowls were just bleh to me, as well. Like Luan N. mentioned, rice has an additional charge WTF? It's just sticky rice.. Brown rice ok, but sticky? The sides just don't make sense.. also at these Americanized joints, why do you have to charge for kim chi? EEssshhh 18!! If I happen in here again I think I'd try the chicken plain and maybe try a bul kogi burrito, cuz bul kogi is bangin' and not something anyone can F up. Fuck the fusion part, bring back the Korean style. I found this on the Internet so for some of you that care, you've got the Korean names of this style of chicken; "" There are the battered wings, served plain (Dak Nal Gae, ""chicken wings"") or brushed with garlic, soy, pepper, whatever sauce (Mae Woon Dak Nal Gae ""spicy chicken wings""). Then there's the deep-fried whole chicken (Tong Dak, ""whole chicken""), cut into pieces, with the thin, crackly and almost transparent crust. "" Tong dak can be found at a few Korean bars on the North side. P.S., from a person that's had a crap load of this kind of chicken, it does not carry out well. I haven't found a restaurant yet that's been able to box it so that it stays its original awesomeness till you get home. Even in Korea, it's better at the restaurant or bar."
"I like this place. There have been a lot of reviews, so I will keep it short.THIS IS THE COMBO YOU SHOULD GET IF YOU GO WITH A FRIEND!!:..............THERE IS A 19.99 SPECIAL!!YOU GETa whole fried chicken!2 small sides- their huge! More than enough for 2!and two cans of soda/water!I went with a friend recently and we got the seoul sassy/spicy bbq  chicken basket2 cans of sodafriesfried mushroomsI also got a bowl of brown rice"
"Holy schmoly this place knows how to tickle your taste buds with poultry! I've had fried chicken in my past and besides getting it from Stanley's every once in awhile, I really don't take an easy liking to it all that much. From a recommendation, I tried the Seoul Sassy which was like an exciting firecracker in the mouth. The half chicken pieces were delicately fried to a perfect *crisp* (how ironic, right?) sealing plenty of moisture inside. The soy ginger based sauce that was spread over the breading provided excellent lube for my throat as I inhaled the whole thing in a few minutes flat.Want to go back and try the buddha bowls... those look GOOD!"
"Overrated.  A changeup of Korean tacos by serving up Korean burritos.  I shared some wings and had a Seoul Sensation burrito ($8).  The burrito had a bulgogi, rice, lettuce, tomatos, corn and onions in it.  The stuffing was ok but the burrito shell wasn't very good.  The entire restaurant concept is fine: Korean food in a fast food style setting with a menu geared for uninitiated patrons of Korean cuisine.  The food just didn't work for me.  The chicken wings were poor as korean wings go.   Perhaps I'm biased since the home-made wings I'm used to is sweeter, crispier, and juicier. Didn't try the fried chicken.  The interior is clustered and a horrible mess when busy."
"Here are a few comments I see repeatedly written about Crisp that I'd like to clear up:1. ""Ohmigod, the Buddha Bowl was LUKEWARM!"" - Crisp's Buddha Bowl is essentially Korean bibimbap. It is served cool/room temperature (like Crisp's) or in a hot stone bowl (dol sot bibimbap). It is supposed to be this way. If you do not like this, go to a Korean joint that serves the dol sot variety. Just because American food isn't served this way doesn't make it wrong- become informed about Korean food before criticizing it.2. ""IT'S NOT HEALTHY!"" - Nobody is claiming this stuff is diet food. They're a Korean-American fast food joint. They are selling fried chicken wings, french fries, onion rings, and fried mushrooms. If you're concerned about your bibimbap having a little sesame oil in it, please know that  it contains vitamin e (an anti-oxidant), it helps lower cholesterol, and it also contains magnesium, copper, calcium, iron and vitamin B6. Your body needs some fat to support cell growth- if you're so concerned with a little bit of sesame oil then stop eating out and go back to frantically working out on your elliptical machine while watching in the mirror and crying."
"I've heard about the legend of Crisp for quite some time, but until now, I never knew that it was true.  All of it.  I made a special trip to go out of my way (I mean, REALLY out of my way) just for a taste.  Hell, I would have settled for just a smell.  But as luck would have it, I got the whole kitchen.  Literally.First of all, the smells coming out of the place were heavenly.  I literally tried to grab them out of the air and eat them.  Like they were morsels of food dancing around my head in one of those dream bubbles from the cartoons.To my surprise, they had a deal going where you could get a whole chicken, two sides, and two drinks for under $20.  I nervously ordered the sauces for my chicken (thinking that all of them were going to be heavenly, and how do you choose JUST two?), then picked two sides not really knowing what would come out of my mouth (since I was so delightfully excited for getting that sweet sweet chicken in my stomach.)The friendly gentlemen had our order out to us in less than 10 minutes and the smorgasbord began.  I don't really remember the meal much.  I think I blacked out from happiness.  The last thing I remember is seeing the tray and hearing the Hallelujah chorus in my mind.  I think I had a dream about getting married to their chicken on the beach.  It was romantic.Everything about the food was fantastic.  The meat was fall off the bone, the sauce was incredible and the price was right on point.  I would definitely go back here again and rumor has it it's BYOB??  If only I had known!"
"This is my current favorite place to eat in Chicago.To put it simply, the food is fairly cheap, and incredibly delicious.I always get the 5 whole wings (they're HUGE) in Sassy Seoul sauce with french fries. The whole wings are super crispy and the sauce is sooo good. If you eat inside, they have additional homemade sauces on the table to put on your fries."
"After 600+ reviews, what else is there to say about Crisp that hasn't already been said?  How about: Dunk everything in the Atomic sauce!!!* I would like a bottle of that to drink, please.Basically, the sauces make this place. If you're a first-timer, you must try both the BBQ and the Seoul Sassy, preferably on their chicken strips. (Bonus! I ordered 3, but got 4 because I ordered both sauces!) Or you could just ask for them in a cup and drink it straight. Either one works. Oh, and get the fries. Or get the Chi-Town Chicken Bowl. It's so big that you'll end up eating your leftovers for (an extremely delicious) lunch the next day.*Disclaimer: This may have already been said, but I don't want to read over 600 reviews to find out, so I'm going to pretend it's a completely original thought."
Perfect lunch spot for me this Sunday.  I wanted to walk around a bit since it was actually warm (as it should be in early April!!) so I headed over to Broadway for Crisp.  I had read many of the reviews but completely blanked on what I should get.  I just went w/ the wings since that's what they're known for with the BBQ sauce.  Delish!  Finger lickin good for sure.  It lived up to the hype and I was full and satisfied w/ a few wings left over for dinner tonight.
"I met up with some friends here on a full stomach. that was a mistake. I shared a Bad Boy Buddha with tofu, which was good, but the main event here is definitely the chicken. I picked off friends plates, wishing i was hungry enough to order my own. The wings were cooked perfectly, moist and juicy and the batter was light and so very crispy (despite being doused in some of the best sauces I've ever tasted). Favorite: Seoul Sassy. Sweet and sour soy/ginger. I loved the rolls of paper towels on the large community tables. And of course... bendy straws for drinks (surprisingly hard to come by these days). It's been 2 days, and i can't stop thinking about that chicken. I look forward to my next visit!"
"If you want spicy flavorful food, look no further. The barbecue sauce is so amazing I want to buy a bucket of it and put it on everything I eat from now on. If it were healthier I'd go more often."
"Had the original bad boy buddha last night with organic brown rice and tofu w/o the egg...DELISH!  The veggies were yummy and the seoul sassy sauce (what you get if you dont want spicy) was perfect!!!    If you want the regular spicy sauce, it comes in the yellow ""mustard"" plastic container on every table.  I also kind of like the communal seating area (wooden park benches/tables).  This might be my fave bibimbab place yet!Do know that I have a pretty healthy appetite and the original bad boy buddha was a good amount!  If you're REALLY hungry, then get the bigger one.  :)"
"Oh, Crisp, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways...*Baby Buddha Bowl with Beef (if you like Bi Bim Bop, you'll LOVE this!)*Seoul Steak Bowl (so good it may make vegetarians think twice about their food choices)*Seoul Sensation Korean Burrito (""Koreans make burritos?"" Oh YES they do!)*The Funke Chicken (Crisp BBQ and Seoul Sassy are my boo's faves)The location is small but what they lack in size, they make up for in flavor sensation... Their bulgogi is AHH-mazing -- tender, juicy, melt-in-your mouth good! Alison's Atomic Sauce has highly addictive qualities and if they sold it, I'd buy pallets of the stuff!Fun Fact: A variety of Korean and Asian specialty drinks in addition to an array of carbonated bevvies are offered."
"The food here is AMAZEBALLS and I never had a bad experience there. Now that I live in San Diego, I'm pissed and decided they need to open one down here!"
"My Baby Budha bowl was massive.  It looked delicious--big bowl of rice with a variety of vegetables.  But it was pretty disappointing.  The rice was lukewarm and the veggies were cold, but it had a good kick to it.  I think if their attention to detail (keeping all components warm) was a bit better, this would have been a great lunch.  The counter guy was helpful and very friendly.  The communal style seating was fine.  I was just disappointed with my Baby Budha.  I mean, come on, such a cute name for the dish!"
"Usually packed and the only drawback is that it's a small operation. Regardless, their Korean fried chicken, sauced with my two favorites Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ, easily beats fast-food franchises like KFC or Popeyes.Word to the wise if you get their burrito, expect it to be one BIG and packed burrito that you'll have to finish. I also plan on trying their Buddha bowls that everyone has mentioned.I would also suggest their onion rings as a side,especially if you take advantage of their $20 walk-in value deal (2 Half Chickens, I believe, 2 sides and 2 drinks)."
Best wings I ever had.  I will come back again for this yummy wings!
"It was not a good experience getting to this place.  We took a long metro ride & it was POURING when we were walking to this place.  I was SOAKING WET and of course grouchy by the time I got here.SEOUL SASSY CHICKEN WINGS made it all worth it :) The chicken was crisp & the marination was out of this world....YUMMMIEEE!We also had the Buddha Bowl & Korean Burrito, which was also very good (not as good as the chicken wings though hahaha)"
Delicious even if it isn't the healthiest way to prepare chicken (it is deep fried).
"I was so excited to eat at Crisp, especially since the reviews are really tremendous!  My boyfriend and I ordered 2 half-chickens, one with Seoul Sassy and the other with BBQ sauce.  I must admit the sauces and the level of crispiness were amazing!  BUT!  They did NOT give us 2 half chickens.  What they gave, us, instead, were two drumsticks, 2 wings, and four hacked-up inedible pieces of the breast bone.  Seriously, there were NO thighs and no supreme breast meat in either order.  As a chicken enthusiast who (1) regularly butchers my own chickens and knows their parts rather well and (2) knows that asian chicken joints often hack up the breasts into four rather than two pieces for ease of frying, this was NOT the case that the breast was just broken up into several pieces.  Instead of true pieces of chicken amounting to a whole chicken, we got two fried pieces of the underside of the breast connecting to the backbone, fried and glazed with the sauces.  They were inedible.  When I pointed this out to the cashier, placing emphasis on the lack of thighs at ALL in the order, disqualifying it as a ""whole chicken,"" he was very polite and obliging and brought us more chicken!  What did we get?  4 more pieces of inedible chicken bone and ONE remarkable, adorable, little, delicious thigh.  The only explanation we could come up for this mishap is that Crisp reserves the good parts of the thighs and breasts for their Buddha Bowls and chicken tenders, and passes off the rest because it looks so good fried.  Please don't insult my intelligence as a consumer, Crisp.  When you pay $22 for an entire chicken at a restaurant, you want the entire thing.  Instead, it was like buying a sportscar that had already been ""parted.""  I felt cheated and jilted when I left Crisp.  Even if this was an 'off' night, it won't be worth it to try it again."
The seoul steak bowl with there signature sauce is my comfort food!Service is always quickThe food is consistentAnd they usually have MXC on :)
"Went in here with my roomie today looking for a place to eat, and boy was I happy we found Crisp! She had mentioned it before, but I had no idea what I was in for! Seoul Sassy wings are the BEST wings I've ever had in my life!! They are so delicious, they don't even need dipping sauce! A little pricy (5 wings for 9 bucks), but for the size of the wings, it's totally worth it! I will definitely be visiting Crisp again to try more options!"
"Ate here a few times for eat in, delivery, and to go. Seoul sassy wings are the best item on the menu. The sauce is exactly my taste, and wings themselves live up to the name of the restaurant. Delivery was kind of slow and not as good as eating it right out of the kitchen at one of their big picnic-style tables. It can get pretty hectic in there at busy times, which is why I tried delivery, but I think it's worth the wait."
"Hands down the best chicken wings in town!!!!! Another thing, it is cheap for the serving size and fills you up quickly!!!! My favorite sauce for their wing was the Seoul sassy. Delicious! Also, try their buddha bowl, it goes well with the wings and you can share it with a friend! :)"
"So full. I ate here a few hours ago and my stomach has not stopped expanding.  We hadn't been here before so we (two of us) ordered 10 wings, 1 Seoul Bowl, and a side of fries.  First of all, the wings are HUGE three-section monster chicken limbs deep fried to a crisp (der).  You can pick two spices for a 10-piece so we got the buffalo (mild and spicy options) and some Asian flavor I don't remember.   Delicious and very filling - this probably would have been enough for both of us alone.  They come with some spicy ranch sauce which was awesome.The Seoul bowl wasn't that exciting - some marinated meat on a huge bed of rice.  I love veggies with Asian food so this was a bit disappointing.  The fries were, well fries.  The place was super packed on a Friday night around 9 PM, I'm surprised we got a seat.  The fire code sign said that it only occupied 23 people and we were probably at capacity.I've washed my hands 3-4 times and I still can't get the smell of the wing sauce out of my skin.  It's sort of disgusting and sort of amazing."
"This establishment has it going on.  I am not one who eats fried chicken regularly unless I have a craving for it.  A bad one at that.  I was really impressed with the size of the wings.  Not only that because they come ""whole"" as in all three parts of the wing connected.  Not cut up as some places sell them.  I have been back twice and will definitely be going back.  Good ""cheat"" food for me at least once a week.  Tah-Dah!!!"
"I know this isn't ""authentic"" Korean food, and I understand some may find it simple...but that's what I love about Crisp.  Amazingly flavorful chilled vegetable side dishes, perfectly cooked rice, and the tastiest chicken around.  I HIGHLY recommend the Seoul Sassy sauce.  The chicken is always cooked to a golden-brown perfection and the sprinkles of green onion on top are perfect.  I had a Buddha Bowl last time and was so satisfied.Dining in was a bit awkward I'll admit, I'm not a fan of cafeteria-style seating at large tables, especially when the strangers across from you are silent and therefore are hearing your entire conversation.  But whatever.  For the record I do think they were a bit more generous with the vegetable side dish portions when we dined in as opposed to when we order out..."
"I love this place!! It's definitely nothing fancy, but it will be the best friend chicken that you will ever eat and my personal fav is their Seoul Sassy chicken. Although I go their for their chicken,  their steak bowl is also amazing so bring a friend so you can share."
"For a fried chicken place, they have a LOT of vegetable bowls.  After you've had their famous wings and other assorted fried goodness, check out the Korean menu items - they are delicious!  They're also an interesting twist on some flavors that you might not be as familiar with, if your Asian food experience is mostly of the Chinese-Thai-Japanese variety.  Definitely worth several return trips.Plus one of the employees looks just like Peggy from ""Mad Men."""
"As far as Korean hybrid chicken goes, this place is tops. It's a bummer that the staff is pretty unprofessional.While I was ordering, two delivery guys bragged about how 'high' they were; then after ordering the cashier just walked outside to smoke. He didn't say a word, just entered my order and walked outside. Another cashier had to finish the order, and was dumbfounded on the first guys disrespect. The entire experience made me feel really uncomfortable.The food is awesome, but I can't recommended eating there. Take out only."
"As much as it pains me to say this, Crisp's wings FADE Harold's! I met up with a few Yelpers at An P's Get Yo Wing On event and I must say, I had my doubts. I mean, all this hype about how good these wings are, there's no WAY they can be better than Harold's.As I stood in line confused about what to order, Matthew S.'s smiling face appeared and schooled me on what and how to order. He recommended I get the wings doused in Seoul Sassy sauce since I'm such a sassy Soul Sista. And boy I'm glad I did!First let me say that I have NEVA EVA EVA in my life had chicken fried to this crispy level of perfection. And that sauce---hmmmph, you betta run and tell dat...homeboy!I ordered a side of kimchee which was super spicy and very tasty, but really, all I needed were the wings.My ONLY complaint is that Crisp is a bit expensive. You can get a half chicken at Harold's with bread and fries for less than $10. I paid almost $15 for five jumbo wings and the kimchee.Nevertheless, I'm in love."
"The Seoul Sassy whole chicken came with 8 pieces of chicken (I didn't count, but I presume there were 2 legs, 2 breasts, 2 wings, and 2 thighs) and is garnished with some green onions.  At $14 dollars pre-tax, I found the price of this chicken to be very reasonable and much cheaper than the other options I've had (I think the KyoChon whole chicken is about $18-19, and the Korean chicken at Momofuku is... well... $100 for the entire dinner (which is just two chickens)).  In terms of taste, I thought it was solid, but not spectacular.  The sauce was a bit sweet for my taste, and the garlic flavor is not as pronounced as other soy-garlic sauces I've had.  In terms of the crunch factor, the fried chicken could have been a bit crispier.  I'm not sure if they double fry this chicken - I don't think they do because it just wasn't as crunchy as places to do this, and once you add the sauce, you will lose a bit of crunch.  However, overall, the chicken did not seem overly oily or heavy, and the dark meat pieces were still juicy and good (the white meat breast pieces were a bit dry).  Overall, the chicken was solid - not as good as KyoChon, but worth coming back to again.Surprisingly, I think the bibimbap was the highlight of my meal.  Now, I'm not sure if that implicates the chicken as just being average, but I think it was more that this was some awesome bibimbap.  To me, this bibimbap was pretty perfect - they used bulgogi as the beef (which is far superior to ground beef), the egg is half fried and not too runny, and there was a diverse selection of vegetables, of both the crunchy and chewy variety.  After adding the hot sauce into this bowl and mixing it up, there just wasn't much else I could ask for.  At $9 pre-tax, I think this is a good deal, considering that you will definitely be full after eating one of these bowls by yourself.More at:  thegluttonousjd.com/2010…"
"Love the wings, crisp bbq and Seoul sassy.   I always order bad boy Buddha bowl, which comes with 8 different veggies with the wings.  Their gochujang is very tasty."
"When my friend told me about bulgogi burritos, I knew I had to go to Crisp! I love Korean food and fusion Korean food is no exception!When eating Seoul Burrito, dipping it in the provided sauce is a must! The burrito is huge, just like Chipotle, tasty and filling! No need to order extra food! But if you're a big eater, which I sometimes am, I'd pair it with the Crisp BBQ fried chicken.If you're looking for a good contemporary twist on Korean food, then Crisp is the place for you!"
"OMG.Go here.  As soon as possible.Crisp probably has helped me gain 10 pounds in the past year.  But those are 10 pounds of love. Pure love.I love both the Crisp BBQ and Seoul Sassy, dig the buddha bowls, and if I'm feeling gluttonous, definitely go for the Seoul steak bowl.  Their brown rice is FANTASTIC- the real thing- not just white rice fried with soy sauce in order to look brown.I love you Crisp!"
If you like chicken wings you have to check this place out.  Get both the Seoul Sassy (sweet) and the Spicy BBQ.  The wings are huge (get both he wing and drumette)...so come hungry. You will be licking your fingers its so good.I also had some rice/chicken bowl....added a fried egg on top...it was good too.  But you really should go here for the wings!P.S. The guy that worked the counter yesterday when I went was cute...thats always a plus!
We stopped in before blue man group and was pleasantly surprised. We had huge wings with a sweet soy glaze and the spicier sassy soy. Both were excellent and the portion was huge. Too bad we were going to a show and couldn't bring home leftovers.
"It's not 5 star Michelin, but this is as good as it gets.  Awesome,  Just read the other positive reviews."
"I've had chicken, but not Korean. Together they make a fantastic meal. The prices are great for the amount of food you get and the staff is really laid back and friendly. We went on a Saturday night and there was a ton of traffic in and out of the little restaurant. The atmosphere is great and I love the tables and benches scattered around. Beware, your personal space might be invaded just a tad due the layout of the benches and tables and the popularity of the restaurant which makes it crowded. Still a wonderful place to stop in the for a quick bite. I ordered the chicken tenders and fries meal with Seoul Sassy sauce. Amazing! The tenders were delicious and the sauce made it better. The green onions on top was a big plus for me too. I got more fries than I expected and they were served to me minutes after being taken out of the fryer. I also tried the Chi-Town Chicken Bowl that my boyfriend ordered. I'm totally ordering that next time we go back! I'm already salivating. :)"
"I don't get it, I must be the only person I know that thinks this place is ok.  My friends love this place but I'm not that crazy about the fried chicken. I think it is way to over saucy and over season for my taste. The Sassy especially, sorry Davin :(."
Closes at 9pm? You have to be kidding me. Poor form.
"it's been nearly a week since my crisp experience and i can't stop thinking of the sass that seoul sassy sauce gave me. it's zesty, tangy, and surely has seoul. truly finger lickin' good. i got the three piece tender meal with fries and a bev. not only was i given FOUR tenders (by accident or on purpose..not sure. but didn't complain, either), i was super impressed with the ginormous bed of fries sitting in my basket! om nom!!my dining companion got the baby buddha bowl and was nice enough to let me try it. dee-ee-licious! she subbed brown rice for regular and it totally heightened the experience.aldon is such a sweet guy and that always makes customers feel comfortable and at home. can't wait to come back and try all of what crisp has to offer."
we were in the neighborhood attending a memorial service when i remembered crisp was nearby so we stopped in for take out.  we had the half order plaine jane and a half order of the seoul sassy. there are awesome sauce wings!  i would love to return and try their buddha bowl next time i'm in da hood!
"When I have fried chicken cravings, Crisp is my favorite place in my area.  I always get the five piece wings with the Seoul sassy sauce.  While five wings sounds like a small amount, I usually have enough for leftovers the next day.  Their french fries are also very good and crunchy, so I also recommend their combo.  Hands down the best wings in the area."
"Chicken is amazing, as seen in other reviews. Food service is fast. The flavors are phenomenal.  Only other place I have been with Korean style wings with that delicious sauce and crispiness is Great Seas in Albany Park. Only place that is comparable to Crisp that I've tried for a bit cheaper. I will def be back to try the midweek whole bird deal. That seems legit."
"The BEST chicken wings in Chicago. The wings are huge and flavorful and of course ""Crisp""  I could eat here every week! I am not going to say everyday cause I am an obese whale so every week is go enough for me.So don't be an idiot go try Crisp but don't take my word for it that it'll change your life!!!"
"As a Korean person, I hold Korean fried chicken near and dear to my heart. After hearing great things about this place, we decided to check it out. For a Friday night, it was definitely super busy and bustling in the early evening. We ordered 10 Crisp BBQ wings and a Baby Buddha bowl (bibimbap). The wings were spicy but not too spicy, I would say they were more sweet than spicy. The wings were ginormous - I would say splitting 10 wings is more than enough for 2 people. The Baby Buddha bowl tasted pretty good, but it was missing something. There were 4 toppings but not a lot of them! That was kind of lame. All in all, we got a ton of food for $26 and we had leftovers to take home. The taste was good, the wings were delicious and the atmosphere was friendly. I'd definitely come back!"
"These guys are so good at chicken dishes that they should be shut down for putting addictive substances in their food!  Because there's no other reason why I'd want to eat anywhere so often.The chicken, wings and strips options alone are so delicious that it really opens the door to trying anything else on the menu and I highly suggest that you do because I have yet to find anything I don't absolutely love!My current favorite is the Chi-Town Chicken Bowl.  Looking at a photo of it, you might not even think it's that special. But once you plop some of Alison's Atomic Sauce on that bad boy and have a bite, you're never going back!  And I find that simple dishes are always a great way to judge the chef's prowess at any restaurant.  After all, if an Italian chef can't get a simple fettuccine alfredo right, how good do you think his/her eggplant parmigiana is?  Such is the case with Crisp: superb simples, spectacular specials and a fun, shared-table atmosphere in which everyone is stoked because their tummies are singing!Cannot recommend these guys highly enough :^)"
"bottom line: has a fairly urban feel to it, and the food is pretty good. the fried chicken is korean style and was probably my favorite thing there, though it did get all over my face (speaks to the sauce they put on there, which was delicious). also tried one of the korean burritos and bibimbap but i probably wouldn't get them again as they didn't stand out. overall, stick with the wings and you should be good to go.p.s. on the fence between 3 and 4"
"I've lived within a few blocks of Crisp since they opened, but for some moronic reason i STILL had not been there. That all changed last night when I decided that my time had finally come. It's probably best that I waited for so long, because now I'm going to be forced to eat here on a regular basis.I could not make up my mind, so I went with what some would see as boring, the BBQ Super Strips, but holy crap were they delicious. My friend had the Chi-town Chicken burrito, it was hella delicious, and HUGE. Crisp is so great... friendly staff, affordable, delicious food within walking distance, and I gotta say it... I love the logo. There are restaurants I refuse to go to because of poor design, so the Funke Chicken logo just makes Crisp even better."
"Ree-dic-you-lus wings. In all seriousness though Crisp is serving up some of the best wings in town. Now yes, these aren't your typical leg and wing smothered in a butter based wing sauce no no, these are pretty damn authentic whole leg and wing deep fried and covered in one of four Korean sauces. I had the BBQ sauce and I entered meat heaven. Korea is known for their fried chicken and Crisp does a great job at keeping this tradition alive and well here in Chicago. I go to Chicago wing fest every year and can say that these wings blow away a lot of the places that are there.I had the Buddha bowl as well which was tasty, but the wings stole the show. If you're in the mood for some wings of a slightly different variety head over to Crisp."
The chicken wings are to die for. I am a sucker for crispy wings and this place delivers. Let's not forget that is the name of this place. When I first when I got the 5 wings. Yes you're thinking 5 wings won't fill someone up. But these wings are large in size and they come with the drum still on the wing. So it's actually like having 10 pieces of chicken. I had the Seoul sassy which was amazing. Added fries and a drink for an extra 2 bucks which was worth it. It felt like the fries were endless because the fries were small but there was a lot. Similar to mcdonalds fries which is a plus in my book. The next time i went i had the spicy BBQ. Not as spicy as i wanted but still very tasty and still very crispy. The Seoul sassy would have to be my favorite so far. They do have other flavors i would like to try as well. They also have Korean style burritos which also look appetizing. And they also have the traditional Korean bowls with bulgogi and other Korean favorites. The staff is nice but it is shared public seating. Large benches but if you have a big party you might have to wait. Paper and plastic accepted.
good food pretty rude staff can be a long wait for food the manager dude (red hair) been there for a while If you don't like your job leave but don't be cranky to the customers
"I want to eat seoul sassy chicken strips all day and all night. Don't bother me with vegetables. Don't bother me with chicken bones.I live 150 paces away from this place and I'm addicted.If it was a little cheeper (see what I did there, because it's chicken) I would probably eat here even more.Also, kind of amused by cashier eating every time she isn't ringing up an order. You may say this is unsanitary but I say, honey, I would do the same thing if I was surrounded by delicious chicken products all day.But don't eat here, because I don't like waiting in line behind you."
"I absolutely love this place. When I used to live in Lakeview I saw this little place magically pop up out of nowhere. I would walk past it a couple of times a week but never stopped in because at the time I was BROKE and thought that $6 for chicken was crazy.....That is until the first time I actually ate there.  I asked the guy at the front if I could try a couple of different flavors for my 5 wings. He said, ""Sure."" I had the Seoul Sassy and the Spicy BBQ. The minute I took a bite of that Seoul Sassy wing, I was hooked for life. The Seoul Sassy, IMO, is the best sauce of all of them. It's sweet and sticky and covered in green onions(yummy!!)  And the Buddha bowls are PHENOMENAL! They come in 3 different sizes, but all of the sizes are sufficient, with the biggest being enough to probably share amongst 3 people. Also the fries are so light and crispy. Always hot and fresh. You can add a drink and fries to your meal as well. They have one of my favorite pops of all time there, Tahitian Treat, which got them that last star. ^_^Nowadays, the place packed all of the time. So expect to way anywhere from 10 minutes around lunch time when it's not so busy, to as much as an hour on weekend dinners. Parking in the area is crazy, if you've been to Lakeview you know that. You'll be lucky to find anything close. Seating in the place is super cool. It's got group style seating with large picnic style tables in the middle of the room. Counter style stools in the windows and along the wall work great if it's busy or if you're alone.Oh yeah and best part about this place, aside from the food of course, is it's BYOB. So if you and your friends are dying for some bomb-a$$ food and wanna make it a party, Crisp is the place to be."
"Oh crisp... Once one of my favorite spots now I'm not so sure... I always enjoyed Steak bowl until last weekend I went back. Why is it sooooo sweet? Is it becoming panda express now? As an born and raised in Asia Asian, I am pretty anti-Americanized Asian food. Now your move Crisp, be another street mall-ish Chinese restaurant or be back to yourself. I still have faith in you!"
"At first I was dissapointed that there wasn't a Kyochon in Chicago because I want what I want and at that moment, I wanted garlic soy chicken!  I ordered just the wings and when I recieved them, I was apprehensive because they weren't as tiny as Kyochon's so I expected it wasn't going to be as crispy.  I was wrong not only were they crispy but they were wonderfully filling (As a comparison, 1 Crisp wing = ~4 Kyochon wings).4 stars for the food .5 for exceeding my expectations and .5 for turnng my frown upside down.Now, when I'm in LA, I'm dissapointed because they don't have Crisp and I want what I want."
"Upfront, let me be straight with you.  I am not a chicken lover.  In fact, I often refer to it as chucken-  (as in upchuckin- what I sometimes find myself doing after I eat it).Just so  you get the  full picture.  I decided to try Crisp today with a friend who had been craving some fried chicken.  I was game, why not-try something new, break the habits, experience life.  Ya, it was just lunch, and we can all do without another sandwich in our lives.   I ordered the lunch special- total of $6.97 with tax, and WAY more food than I could consume.  Three HUGE wings, fries, and a can of my preference.  Let me tell you, these were HEALTHY BIRDS.  They flew HIGH and LONG before their demise.  They had MEAT on their BONES.  Well, the BONES- they were a problem.  See, I am one of those persnickety eaters who likes to think that meat is manufactured at some factory, and never, ever wants to see bones attached. You could say that I have a FOOD BONE phobia.  I know the truth ( my grandmother owned a locker plant, I was often the city kid locked in back with the sides of beef and pork as a prank by my uncles, this may have something to do with my phobia).  Being polite, and somewhat hungry and curious, I was determined to attempt this food, bones and all. To eat these monster wings, I had my choice of chopsticks (not an option unless someone wanted to get hurt), a plastic fork, and my fingers.  Um, nope, I could not handle my fingers, so the plastic fork was my tool of choice.  Ironically enough, Bryan Adams was belting out ""Cuts like a knife"" on the oldies radio- and the fork worked!! The chicken was tender enough that a plastic fork- for the most part- was able to tackle the job!I tried the Korean BBQ.  It was spicy and nice. Not too hot, and did not burn.  I had a taste of the Seoul blend from my friends.  It was good too.  I ended up consuming 2 of my wings, tossing one to my friend, and trying a part of one of hers.  All in all, a fantastic lunch.I do think I misordered.  They had some FANTASTIC looking bowl combos- with veggies, brown rice, etc.  Next time, I am heading for that, I am confident it will be good, and know that I do not have to deal with my bone phobia!"
"Sooooo good!!! I got the Seoul Classy and it was so good.  I'm done with great seas lollipop chicken! Rosie L is right!If you like crunch, not greasy and lots of flavor take your butt over here.  I'm just not a fan of the seating, blah."
Ok so I just ordered Jumbo Wings with fries from this restaurant and it was a NO GO! My coworkers ordered a Booda Bowl which they said was ok. The chicken didn't really have any flavor and the batter was not good. Sorry but I have to PASS on this place :-(
"I love Crisp!I discovered crisp through a korean friend who told me about their chicken wings. I love the Seoul Sassy wings. When you think wings, you think greasy, right? No, the seoul sassy makes you forget all the calories you might be consuming but instead forces you to focus on their perfectly fried chicken wings. So crisp and crunchy.I'd also recommend the Bulgogi Burrito which is a personal favorite. I love the sauce they give you with this - it actually reminds me of a spicy thousand island sauce. Sounds gross but it's actually quite good.My only complaint - I wish they would deliver further and were opened later. I'd like to go here one day after I have had a night of drinking! :)"
"Seoul Sassy chicken, I love you.  I love you as a whole chicken, a half chicken, or tenders.  It doesn't matter.  You are delicious.  I will BYOB with you anytime."
"Okay, if you are not here for their wings you probably should go somewhere else because their Korean style beef is not very authentic and you'll be waiting in line and to get a table for a long, LONG time. Their meals are just a bit over filling but this is probably not the place where you'll be taking leftovers home. It's a bit pricey for what you get too, so that this place would be for a last resource kind of deal. Granted, their special sauce is delicious."
"""Korean meets Fried Chicken meets Mexican""This place is almost always bumping. Sometimes its so busy, all three of their order phone lines are off the hook. What makes this place different is the re-imagination of dishes what we are familiar with. There are two that would serve as the most popular orders: Fried Chicken and Bibimbap.The chicken is made to order and when put together is part of the same bird versus the assortment stuff. There are three sauces that you can get: Seoul Sassy (kinda sweet and sour), Crisp BBQ, and Bud's Buffalo. Now they might be what you think they are but they all have a spin to it. After many tries, Bud's Buffalo is my fav.If you are aiming for a different kind of asian fusion CrIsp might be what you are looking for."
1: Grab a friend.2: You order the seol sassy chicken.3: Your friend orders the bad boy Buddha bowl.4: Split it all between you.And voila! You're in food heaven and your friend will love you forever for taking you here!
"Cant go wrong with this place. I have had some of the sandwiches and the chicken tenders. My favorite sauce is definitely the Seoul Sassy, but the buffalo is also quite good. You certainly get what you pay for and even more sometimes. More than once I have received more tenders than I ordered. Will certainly go again."
"There is so much to say about this place...but the most important thing to say is  ""You must go!!!""I have walked past this place so many times and always thought, maybe I should pop in, but of course I never did until last week.  And let me say, I have been missing out!!!The gentleman working the counter was so friendly and helpful.  He explained how everything worked and answered all my dumb questions (and believe me, I had some really dumb questions).  My friend ordered the Baby Buddha bowl...which was not that baby at all and really tasty (a much healthier option than what I ordered).   I ordered the 10 piece wacky wacky wings....there were HUGE!!!  I could not eat them all and have to leave a few behind, which made me really sad.  The best part is that you can order half your wings with one sauce and half with the another.  I had half soeul sassy and the other half bbq extra spicy.  The soeul sassy was finger lickin' yumminess...but I am a spicy lover...so the bbq extra spicy was my absolute favorite!!!!  Also, I tried a bunch of their sauces and there were tasty as well. Be warned the seating is a little non-conventional...kind of like picnic-style with long table and benches.  It's  a huge place so I would imagine that when it gets crowded you will be elbow to elbow with some new friends!Enjoy!!"
"My guy and I are wing junkies! I love the tasty morsels of spicy goodness! I heard about crisp from someone after just moving here a year ago, I told him I was a wing junkie! After about 11 months of carrying around a business card with a few places that said guy had given me, I finally tried it.Yesssss! It's exactly what I needed! Spicy, sweet, amazing! Only reason for subtracting one star, I wasn't warned of the portion size! 10 wings means 10 WHOLE wings, no need to order 20 for two people!You are my new fave crisp!!"
"I'm eating as I type, and there is sauce all over my fingers and keyboard. It's the best sandwich I've ever had! THE FOODIE'S CHOICE CRISP is bursting with all of these amazing flavors. Given that my trip to Crisp was supposed to end with a small snack, saving the rest for later, I'm surprised to find that I just finished the whole thing. DELICIOUS! I'll be back!"
"Did someone say bibimbop and chicken wings? Step aside people!Both are just solid here. Brown rice = extra bonus points. Walking distance from my apartment = extra extra bonus points. Cash only and communal tables = no bonus points, but I'll let that slide because I like their food that much."
"Okay, so after being a compulsive 3rd wheel to my friends, (no shame!) we decided to go here, before a show at the lake shore theater, I ordered the Buddha bowl and a drink of bon bon, which I haven't had in so many years, so I couldn't help it. To be fair the only reason I even found out about this place was because of my friend Luan N who is basically Yelp with a voicemail, he knows like a 6th sense about food which is great, I feel like he is Yoda and I am only but a young padwan...(j/k for all the trekkies)...to everyone else, yes I am a nerd!Anyways back to the food, the buddha bowl was not even the biggest one, but was enough for almost 2 people, I have a large appetite and was able to finish, well, just abouts. It was really good, but was lacking something, wasn't sure what it was, and then half way through the meal realized I hadn't put in the hot sauce....dang it! Apart from that the place was really clean, staff were really friendly, and it was over all a nice place. My friends ordered the Barbecue flavored Chicken and the Seoul Sassy, they said it was good but preferred the Seoul Sassy, the portions of the chicken was more than enough even for the two of them.Generally great, and a cute place to go, loads of authentic Korean drinks available, always a bonus!!If you get a chance definitely go, it worth it! p.s. (check out the photos of the food for portion sizes)"
"Be still my hungry heart. Crisp has me fixated and wanting more already. The first thing that struck me was the kindness of the people behind the hectic and crowded counter. They answered all my newbie neurotic questions and were really helpful-- neither overbearing nor too lax. That's really impressive for such a small, crowded place with a long waiting line.I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the half chicken with some amazing sauce. I don't even remember what sauce it was but it was sweet and slightly tangy with some sesame seeds on top. One bite of that chicken and he was smitten. By the time he finished, it was all over his face and fingers and he couldn't be happier. The french fries were crunchy and salty and hit that naughty desire spot for greasy goodness. My sandwich had mushrooms and onions and glorious cheese. I'm in love.Can't wait to go back and try some more Crisp!!!"
"I'd been wanting to try out crisp for a long time and finally got around to it!  Hubby picked up some strips on the way home one night, we tried the BBQ and seoul sassy, both were very good!  The bbq was surprisingly spicy - a little too much spice for me, and he told me they come even hotter - which i can't imagine!  Seoul sassy was very good - a refreshingly unique flavor - you just have to try it!  overall, i really liked the chicken - but i'd like to try the wings or whole chicken special sometime since those are the things ppl seem to rave about. The fries were amazing - i don't know why, they just were!  :)My friend got the seoul steak bowl which she loved.  She eats korean food semi-frequently and said her food was excellent.  Very easy to believe her from the frequent ""mmmmmmm""s that were coming from her while she ate.  I wanted to try it but was stuffed beyond belief from my own food - next time...next time...overall, it was a good experience but i'd like to try more!"
"HMMMM, well I've been here twice, and pretty much the second time warranted the current rating.  I've been to hella korean wing spots all over the place and it was one of the few things I was looking for in my new home....ChicagoFirst time I came here a few months back, the seoul sassy chicken wings were pretty decent....small, sweet and garlicy ^_~...I thought I found myself a new wing spot....2nd time around dude, the wings were MASSIVE....could barely taste the batter and there was so much DRY chicken, not to mention grease yo....On a good note, I did try the Seoul Steak bowl, which was pretty tasty, and the Bulgogi was fairly tender-2 stars for the chicken-3 for the bulgogi-0 stars for no alcohol....this is a wing place right???...where's the beer....i don't want a vitamin water or a pellagrino duuuAt least this place is not as bad as Toyose in San Francisco, Ca....I would write a review for them, but you can't give negative stars.My opinion:1. OB Bear (Los Angeles, Ca)2. KyoChon (NYC or LA)3. Bon Chon (but just the one in Midtown - hella good dranks too with a loungy atmosphere)4. SO (San Francisco, Ca)5. Prince Cafe (Los Angeles, Ca)"
"This place was just OK. The chicken is good, but doesn't taste like authentic Korean fried chicken. Felt a little dirty. Prices were on the expensive side."
"I know I've found a good place when the food comes and silence spreads over the table, followed by voracious shoveling and groaning. Huge bowls packed with rice, meat, tons of veggies and deeeeelicious tangy slightly sweet sauce, with an egg that spreads its runny yolk goodness and takes it to a whole other level. I wished I had stopped long enough through my (huge!) bowl to think about taking half home, or to like, remember to breathe. Food comes out in about 10 min, fresh, hot and to order. The tables are huge and offer some nice communal seating arrangements, and I definitely appreciate the plethora of provided paper towels. It's clean, not too loud for such a small place, and the staff is friendly and great about answering questions.I don't even know what to say about the wings, y'all. I've had some chicken wings in my day and these are the crispiest, best cooked to crunchy perfection heavenly tangy chicken pieces I have had in forever. I have friends that still talk about them weeks later, so I'll be back for about 3lbs more of them any day now. I apologize for nothing!"
"The Crisp restaurant is located in a very trendy part of town. It is a small restaurant that has high price korean food, very suitable for the area, however not a good bargain if you're looking for a good meal with a deal.I found the customer service was friendly and helpful in answering my questions about the restaurant and the food that I was interested in ordering.I found the food to be very tasty, I tried their Korean BBQ and the Seol Sassy chicken wings I liked the taste, I wish it wasn't so expensive. I probably won't be returning to that restaurant too often for the chicken because I know I can get it some place else for a better deal.My husband tried their korean buritto and he liked it a lot, but  also agreed it was pricey and we might not return to that restaurant because of high prices. But I recommend it to anyone who wants to try Korean BBQ wings, and a Korean Buritto."
"Sassy, Holler back girl..... You delicious!.... Can I get cho digits? Wait, I forgot, you don't have any. You're just delicious chicken wings!Sassy must be the new word on the block!Sassy Eggs at Over EasySeoul Sassy at CrispNext would be Italian Sassy at (___Sassy R'us___)It's Sassy Craze- Mania!As you can tell, I got the sassy wings from Crisp. Nice big crispy chicken wings with a soy garlicy glaze. The BBQ was quite different that I'm used to. It was quite spicy and it reminded me of this Korean Paste that Koreans use on all their food. Cannot put my finger on it. But the Sassy wings definitely hit the spot. You can also order a side of rice if you like rice with your meat. I guess it's an Asian thing. The Buddha bowls were also a hit with me. It was basically bim bim bap with a different name and a little more franchised. This place reminded me of a korean Chipotle. I wouldn't be surprised if this place expands and take it to the streets of Chicago.  The Buddha Bowl hit my korean spot , if I had a spot that was korean.  I opted for the small Buddha bowl because I had an order of humungous chicken wings. Yes, I overindulged. Oh, well...... I'll give gluttony a new name..... Amy L. There is also 3 long wooden tables that serves as a dining area for all it's customers. So take a seat next to some strangers and dig in. Don't be shy, grab some paper towels on the table and get to work. Like someone else said, you can always peer at someone else's meal before you order. Always a good way to make a decision! All in all, I will return Crispy to devour some more Bim Bim Bop and some crispy wings.But Whomp Whomp, I didn't get Sassy's Digits.... ""She gave me the finger"""
best fried chicken i have ever had! i don't know what i am yelling about....loud noises!!!
"after a HOT HOT yoga session, crisp was the perfect place to fatten up.  it was my first time and the way Donna K described it was ""a korean chipotle type place.""  i thought it was better than anything chipotle could ever proudce.  the seoul sensation burrito was so fresh and perfect. the bulgogi was plenty, the fat on it was minimal, and seasoned perfectly.  the burrito didnt need any other sauces.  we also ordered the seoul sassy and the bud's buffalo chicken but the seoul sassy blew bud's out of the water.  the seoul sassy sauce is like crack and i cant really compare it to anything else.  the chicken itself was crispy and juicy.  i took leftovers to my brother and as soon as he finished, he was furious there wasnt more chicken and burrito for him to eat."
"People see to love Crisp and I dont know why! I got the Seoul Sassy wings, per the Yelp recommendation. Even though it says not to call it Teryaki, thats what it is. Dont get me wrong, they are tasty! The wings are also huge! You can get by with 5 wings, for sure. My friend got the Baby Buddha and was less than impressed. I think it lacked flavor. The other friend got the Fish sandwich, and while the price was right, it looked like something you could get from McDonalds (Fries taste like MCDonalds also - which is a good thing!). Booo.The upsides - The food is fresh and cooked to order! The owners are extremely helpful and will dissect the menu for you. Also, huge plus - THEY HAVE DIET CREAM SODA! YES!I would go back again and get the sandwich or a burrito. As for the wings, I would rather go to a sports bar.Sorry Crisp, too many good restaurants in Chicago to waste time here. Good idea, mediocre execution."
"These wings are so big... you gotta call them WANGS!As my good friend Lisa M. would say, the wings here are ""amaze."" They truly are, crispy skin with the best Korean Seoul Sassy sauce! I was tempted to try their rice bowls, aptly titled: Buddha Bowls but the wings were screaming my name!The place is small with communal wooden benches but the service was fast and it's also BYOB. These Korean wings are the best wings I've had and put regular hot wings to shame!"
"I came here on a Thursday, and Crisp left me thirsty! I think the food was a bit too salty, my dinner dates and I ended up chugging water the rest of the night!I ordered the seoul sassy wings, which were great but didn't seem very authentic to me. There was a lot of fried goopy exterior, and not enough savory chicken.The Baby Bhudda bowl was a good dish, but I was left wishing I had more hot pepper paste to put into the dish. (more spice, more flavor please!)Portions are big! I shared these two items with my sister, and it was definitely enough to keep us both satisfied!To be honest, I'm not sure how quickly i'd be back, especially with del seoul opening up down the street and what appears to have a dolsot (hot stone bowl) option...."
"I want you to know that if you have never been to Crisp, you are doing yourself a grave disservice.  Oh sure, GO to Eve, be all fancy at Spiaggia, knock yourself out at Schwa (ha! if you can get in, sucker).But what I am trying to lay down here for you... dear god if you would only just pick it up... is that CRISP IS JUST AS MONUMENTAL BUT IT IS LIKE 1/32 OF THE PRICE.This is nectar of the gods people.  Yes, GOD as in Hugh Laurie or possibly Christian Bale. Or maybe that one guy from Criminal Minds, you know, the one that always jokes around with Garcia....?   Oh wait, I am becoming sidetracked here.  What was I saying?  Oh right.  Let me tell you what you need to get when you come here:Baby Buddha (its cold, but trust me, it's cool.  get it?)Wings with Suicide Sauce (these are awesomely hot, so beware)Onion Rings (huge and decadent with some stupidly delicious dipping sauce)Other stuff - I didn't try it, but seriously what the heck.  I cant be your personal taste-tester!  If it looks good here it probably is!  Go order up some!Did I mention it is so cheap?  AND BYOB?  The only way it is going to get better for you is if Hugh Laurie valets your car and Christian Bale lets you lick the suicide sauce off his fingers!  Seriously."
"AMAZING.Just came back from Crisp with my Korean roommate who wanted to go.  I was blown away by the food!  Both of us got the Original Bad Boy Buddha expecting it to be a decently sized bibimbop bowl... THE THING IS HUGE.  Plenty of tasty vegetables and the egg was cooked perfectly.  They only give you a small amount of gochujang (Korean pepper sauce), but you can ask for more.  Two small containers was perfect for me.We also ordered a plate of 10 Seoul Sassy wings expecting them to be average size full wings... You pretty much get 10 drumsticks and 10 regular wings.  They're fried crispy, but not too crispy, and the sauce was very savory and sweet.  They really believe in big portions at Crisp, but I'm not complaining! =]Large selection of bottled and canned beverages was a plus.  They also have MILKIS - a milky, carbonated, soda - similar to Sprite Remix with a hint of dairy.  It sounds weird, but it's definitely my favorite Korean beverage - brings me back to my PC Bang gaming days of Starcraft and Counter Strike.The vibe of the restaurant was very casual with large picnic style tables (enough for a party of 8) and some stools w/ counters.  It's an order & pick up joint so don't go in expecting full service.  Strangely, I didn't see a single Korean employee working when I went.This is another case of a restaurant that I wish I had known about sooner, seeing as how I live (and lived last year) about 5-10 minutes on foot from it.  Knowing they deliver could be very dangerous to my diet.  Everything is fairly priced, and I will definitely visit again."
"I've never actually set foot inside this place, but I've tried the Crisp BBQ chicken and let's just say... shut the front door.My boyfriend told me about this place, but we couldn't find the time to make it there for lunch, so he ended up picking up a half chicken for us to share and met me at my office. We sat outside in the courtyard since it was a nice summer day, however, it was incredibly windy. About halfway through the DELICIOUS chicken, a strong gust of wind completely picked up my plate (with the bbq chicken still on it) and blew the remnants everywhere. I ended up with bbq sauce on my dress, and had to face the humiliation of fetching strewn-about napkins all over the place... but even after all of this, I must say it was well worth it. Enjoy the chicken, but just watch out for the wind!"
Seoul sassy sauce is money.  An order of 5 wings + a bowl is more than enough for two to eat and have extras for later.
Best chicken wings in Chicago!
need more belly to fill and more face for sauce.dddddddaaaaaaaayyyyyyuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
"I normally like to put a lot of thought and time into my reviews, but there's not a lot to say about Crisp.  The chicken is absolutely wonderful if you're in the mood for Asian-inspired flavorful fried chicken.  If you like subtle flavors, this won't be something you enjoy, however.  The Korean dishes are fine and fill a niche needed (quick Korean takeout), but certainly not special.  Go have the chicken.  You'll like it."
"Welcome to our weekly Lunch Club: ""Fabulous, Hungry and Unemployed"".It is only in his third week but it's going strong, thankyouverymuch.  We don't need a lot of encouragement. But we do accept donations.This week: Crisp.Here is a sample of our FB conversation the night before:- (me) :  I haven't studied the menu yet...is it just insane?- (YN) : I've been looking at it and I have several issues.1. Do I get chicken or bi bim bop?2. If I get bi bim bop, it will be easy. I'll get the huge one with all the veggies and add chicken.2. If I get chicken, then what sauce do I want?! Do I want a half chicken? Do I want chicken wings? Do I want sides?I wish I could just answer question 1! :)- (JM) : WINGS!!!!! :)- (me): Oh they have bi bim bop? Oh sweet Jesus....And so on and so forth......we went up to 12 comments.I guess we are slightly obsessed.Anyway - if a restaurant has ever deserved its name, it's this one. Insanely crispy...it's so good it should be outlawed. Oh yes, the Seoul Sassy is definitely the sh$t. DO NOT PASS IT!The wings are whole hence enormous. and 5 are more than enough to feed ya. Don't be a glutton, it's a sin.Bi Bim Bop.....I was so hungry I devoured 3/4 of the thing; beware, these bowls are gigantic as well. A Baby Buddha should be enough for anyone but how can you resist the addition of veggies?!? I couldn't and went for the Bad Boy, 'cause I am a badass. It was good but a little lacking in the flavor and texture departments.(no crispy rice here....booo)Don't forget to ask for the sauce. And that's my last advice for the day.On a weekday around 2:30 it was empty and even more delicious.Hurray for unemployment?!?!"
"I was, sadly, less than impressed with what I got here.  I ordered the Chi Bowl lunch special.  It was quit literally white rice, some chicken and green onions with some sauce on the side.  BORING.  The sauce was indeed good, but I was expecting much more exciting from this place.  It was around $8 and came with a pop (or water).  A bit steep for a ""lunch special.""  Also, $15 for 10 wings...really?"
"I'm fortunate to live around the corner from Crisp, but far enough that I actually do go other places. Seriously, if I lived next door, I think I'd look like a chicken. I doubt I would look Korean though, given the genetic impossibilities of that. With 700+ reviews, there's probably not much I can add, but here goes...Pros- Um, the chicken. And the sauces. And the yadda yadda you've already read this in every review.- The free Onion newspapers. In the rare times I'm not distracted by my phone during a quick bite to eat here, it's nice to have entertainment provided for me.Con- Crisp can get REALLY crowded REALLY quickly. I went today right when it opened at 11:30am, for instance, and by the time I left at noon, the tables were starting to fill up.If you're in the neighborhood, go to Crisp. Trust me."
"This is the crispiest, tastiest, most amazing wing I've ever eaten.  One problem - no beer!  The Seoul Sassy & Buffalo are tops.  This rivals my long-time favorite FatHead's in Pitt.  If they put in a full bar, this is my last meal.  BTW - the fries are just as outrageously good!Get it all and take Lipitor later - it's worth it!"
"Me rikey the wings a rot!!!! Izzz deerishous!!!! Ok, I dream about the Seoul Sassy & Suicide buffalo's.... Oh mah goodness!!!! This is the 1st wing place that FINALLY GETS ME!!!! I can NOT eat my wings w/o rice!!!! & they have both my white & brown rice!!!! In reference to  Amy L, ""HOLLER BACK GIRL!!!! Forreal!!!!"" This place is the BIDNESS & ya need to be all up in there!!!!Thank u, have a goodnight!!!!"
"After about a month or two of gawking, my friend and I ponied up and went to check this place out.  FINALLY one afternoon, when the line wasn't ridiculous, we stopped in to check out what the hype was with Crisp. After eating, I understood why this place is constantly crowded.I couldn't decide:  burrito, wings, korean bowl... so... many... options.  My friend and I, in usual fashion, solved that debacle quickly by ordering one order of each.The food came out fairly quickly and we dug in.  The burrito and the bowl were great.  Perfectly seasoned, substantial portions, all-around good.The wings... SPECTACULAR.SERIOUSLY.  Our order of 5 wings (which were whole) actually equated to about 15 normal sized wings you'd find at any other restaurant.  We took the chef's suggestion and got the spicy BBQ sauce, which was a flavor I have never had before.  Sweet..spicy...tangy...TASTY!  I had wing sauce all over my fingers and my face cause I couldn't help but dive full force into these.I have no idea what the sauce is comprised of but its phenomenal.  I believe the breading is made of corn flakes also, combining for a slam dunk.  Crisp lived up to the hype, and, on a side note, I think I found my new wing place."
"Our favorite place to stop on the way to grandma's and grab a couple of fried chickens, one in Crisp BBQ sauce and one in Seoul Sassy sauce, finger lickin' good, with sides of rice.  I don't get the people who complain about the lack of salads or the fact that the steak bowl only had steak and rice when the menu clearly states ""meat sans any frilly accompaniments.""  The menu is large and varied and there's something for everyone (providing you know how to read)."
"Your above average wing joint. The wings are big.  they were super fried and covered in their sauce. They were tasty.  So what... I am giving 3 stars based on my meal of wings, crappy over-priced white rice (should be free) and mediocre store bought kimchee (also should be free).I am Korean and I am kind of embarrassed that people think crisp somehow represents Korean food.  I saw the bibimbop they serve and it looks bush-league. Where's the stone bowl?! The burnt rice at the bottom is the best part!!If you want above average wings go to crisp. If you want authentic Korean food, you be brave and you go to a restaurant that has a staff that hardly speaks English (cho sun ok). You'll probably even spend the same amount.Crisp.....ya it's lakeview but it's so NOT Korean."
"Seriously the best korean BBQ ive ever had in my life. The chicago bowl is just insanely good. And the chicken tenders are so good I could eat them for breakfast; and I have...Staff is super friendly and efficient even though they are almost always slammed. Price is a little higher than Id like but Im cheap and hard to please  ;)The Seoul sassy sauce is amazing. Go here, over and over again.LOVE CRISP"
"I lost the will to write reviews, kind of sad really. But Crisp is making me make an exception because I have been thinking about their wings since I had them yesterday. Don't pass up the wings. But wait, you say, I've seen the menu, they serve more than just wings. That is true, but nothing else should occupy room in your tummy when it can be filled with these wings! And, filled it will be, these things are monstrous. When gauging how many to order 1 Crisp wing = 3-4 standard bar wings. The Seoul Sassy is out of this world delicious. And the heat of the Crisp BBQ is great, but just based on flavor Seoul Sassy is where it's at. And to think, I let this place sit on my bookmark list for over two years! What was I waiting for?!?!"
"Just tried to place a to-go order and was told I was just outside of their delivery range (1 block west).  Eh, fine... I'll come pick it up.  OR NOT.  The guy that answered the phone says ""sorry, dude.  We can't help you"" and hangs up on me before I could tell him I would just come pick it up.  When I call back to speak to the manager, he isn't any help.  I tell him what happened and his response is, ""I'm sure he didn't intend to do that.""  Didn't intend to?  The first guy didn't even give me a chance to respond.  He just hung up on me!  Even after I explained that, all the manager could say was, ""so do you want to place a pick-up order or...?""  WOW.  Congrats Crisp.  You just lost a customer for life.  We will have to find another place to take guests every time we have company."
The service off the bat behind the counter was exceptional and incredibly helpful to newcomers.The chicken itself was also quite spectacular. The sauces for the chicken were unique and delicious. Definitely warrants return.
"Well, the chicken is definitely crisp. The Korean Seoul sauce was pretty tasty.  However, my chicken was a bit dry but still good,  The French fries were so truly a puzzle.  They seemed horribly overcooked but not burnt.  Absolutely NO taste or texture just sticks of petrified vegetable..This isn't something you could eat everyday but definitely a treat once in a while.  Just stop at five guys for a take out order of fries."
"My friends/fellow super eaters discovered Crisp earlier this summer and wanted us to experience it.  We checked it together to celebrate my brother-in-law's b-day.  Wings are out of this world.  They are huge and not greasy.  Got the Seoul Sassy and the Plain.  Seoul Sassy has an original Asian flavor, not sweet and sour, but not teriyaki.  Their website has a good description.  Plain wings were amazing, too.  They taste almost double fried, but not oily.  The hot dipping sauce proved a great paring for the plain wings.Our friends also had us try the Buddha, a mixed bowl of rice, veggies and Korean flavoring.  Crisp's version of Bi Bim Bop.  Pretty tasty.  I favored the Seoul Steak Bowl, with Korean BBQ Beef (Bulgogi).  Similar to the way they cook wings, Crisp's bowls do well with their flavorings, portions, and special ingredients that help differentiate them from other Asian eateries.  The food gets 5 stars, but I'd give it 4 if I took into consideration the restaurant.  It's not a terrible thing, but it's small and gets rather crowded.  I've read there's often a line and no places to sit.  I do know it adds to the restaurant's character, so I'll give it a 5 overall.  Staff is super friendly and moves the line really fast.  And prices are certainly reasonable for what you get."
"Yom Yom Yom....sooo GOOOD! My friend and I live in the area and we finally decided to try the wings here (and we are so glad we did). The guy taking our order was really nice to us as we took almost 17 minutes to decide on our order...(no one was in line). We decided on the Seoul sauce wings and he offered to give us a free wings basket if we could finish the one we ordered. Boy were these wings good, they were so different from anything I have ever tried. My friend and I look tiny but we can handle a lot of food so he was definitely surprised that we went back for our free basket.  I'm not a big fan of fried food but I crave these wings and ever since I have been going back for more."
"I'm about 95% sure that they use MSG.  But its sooooo good, you won't even care.The buddha bowl is fantastic.  Any of the fried chicken will punch your tastebuds in the face.  In fact, it's some of the better fried chicken i've ever had.The sandwiches are not impressive.  The ""not so common"" crisp is very reminiscent of the ""oh so common"" chicken filet at McDonald's....even down to the kraft cheese they put on it......it could be improved so easily, if they'd just just get a better bun and some real cheese....The sides are also only ok.  You won't really remember them.Some of the sauces are amazing.Go with the buddha bowl and some wings and you will come back again and again.  And BYOB."
"Best wings ever!Definitely try the seoul sassy as it is very unique and I've never had anything like it!Next time I'm in Chicago, I'll definitely be back!"
"Mochimaker told me about this place and the fact that they serve Korean burritos.  Being a fan of Momofuku Ssam (although less so now that they don't serve burritos in the evening) I had to see if Crisp compares to David Chang's empire.  The Seoul Sensation burrito was basically bibimbap in a tortilla, although with a smaller selection of vegetables and no gochuchang.  I appreciated the moderate portion of rice inside: enough for taste, not for filler.  The burrito came with some sort of spicy creamy dressing. Whatever. Also, the day I ate here, a sign was taped to the wall near the door explaining that they now have kimchi.  I asked and received a giant bowl (about half a quart) on the house.  That was funny."
"After my first pig out of seoul sassy wings and a buddha bowl a few weeks ago, the guy that brought out my order told me I'd have dreams about it.Man was he right! There is rarely a day that my mind doesn't think..Hm...I could really go for some Crisp tonight. Finally went back this week and ordered twice as many delicious enormous crispy perfectly sauced wings as last time, and ate until I couldn't lift my hand to my mouth anymore. Amazing. Also, I could just drink that seoul sassy sauce. YUMMMM.I think I'll be passing up on the bowls from now on, just don't have room for healthy stuff with all the delicious wings I'm stuffing in my face."
"Think I've been dreaming about the Korean BBQ wings on a nightly basis... I've been back 3x since I've been there (roughly two weeks ago). Inexpensive, large portions and the second someone gets up the spot is cleaned immediately. The breading and sauce on the wings are too perfect! Will be back many more times, probably more than the gym can manage to keep up with."
"So word is I have some past connection to the owners/managers, though my memory is so jaded it probably doesn't mean much, but holy frijoles robin...they fry up some tasty birds here and eating food from places like this reminds me why flesh is meant to pass through my mouth, into my body and leave me feeling fat, full and flatulent.All in all a great day when you have a plate of wings from here.Don't know if its BYO since I've only walked by and had people bring it to me, but I do suggest beer to accompany the food with this place.This is one of them places to get you fat and happy and proud to live in a city with only 4 months of summer."
"Oh My let the combinations Fly.What a place. Cool Korean Mexican Fusions. I can't think of anything more creative. Tons of food. I came back here a second time, and I got their Korean style fried chicken. Ohh Good GOD does this place make my taste buds give me a kick in the nuts of flavor!food is awesome, people are awesome, easily in my top 10"
"I feel like I've waited my whole life for this restaurant.  I kid, but seriously, this has been on the top of my must try list for quite some time.My son and I finally had the opportunity to go to Crisp today.  Bonus, we had rock star parking!  I've got to admit that though I curse the outrageous costs of parking in Chicago, the new rate increases have allowed me more opportunities to find convenient parking in areas that I normally would have avoided.Immediately upon entering, we were assaulted by the most incredible smells.  My mouth was watering before I even approached the counter.  They offer both communal seating and counter seating against the wall and against the front window of the restaurant.  I am also thankful that I was carrying cash as they only accept cash payments.I had a tough time deciding on what to order.  We ended up choosing both the Seoul sassy beef bowl and the chicken bowl along with drinks.  The counter person/ manager?  was phenomenal.  Truly, one of the best that I have encountered in quite some time.  He was friendly, quick and asked if he could call me by my first name.  If I owned a restaurant, I would steal him.  He was that good.Their portions are gigantic.  My son was crazy about the beef bowl and had 3 helpings.  Mid-way, he asked me about their fried chicken.  He is just like me; he wants to taste everything and is a big fan of small plates.  I approached the counter to place an order of wings.  We had hardly made a dent in either of our huge bowls, and I was already quite full.  The counter person/ manager? again went beyond and above.  He asked if I just wanted one.  I had already thought that he rocked, but when he gave it to us on the house as a sample, I was floored.  That wing, btw, was cooked with the Seoul Sassy sauce and it was not only huge but incredibly delicious!My son could not help but think that the counter person/manager? was the nicest guy in the world.  He asked me if he could give him a hug when we were leaving.  I didn't want to freak the guy out, so I told him that a simple thank you would be ok.We brought our leftovers home, and there is still enough for several meals.    We will definitely return whenever possible.The atomic sauce?  I could drink it out of a can!"
"When it comes to bibimbop, this place may be the best.  I give 4.5 star, but for bibimbop only.  The namools (veggies) are all prepared properly, better than most K restaurants. I can have their bibimbop everyday!  The reason for deduction is that their bulgogi (beef) seems too sweet for my taste."
"Believe the hype, these wings are the real deal.  If the wings from Great Seas had a baby with the wings from Dong-Ah then you would get the Seoul Sassy.  Hints of sweetness work in harmony with your standard Asian aromatics such as soy, garlic, and ginger, plus there's a nice unexpected touch of herbiness, too (I'm guessing Oregano?).  I'm not quite sure how they do it, but the exterior of the wings more than live up to the ""crisp"" moniker, yet they still maintain a moist and tender interior.  Don't get thrown off by the quantities either, one wing here is a complete wing (both the drummette and flapper).  And these bad boys are huge.  HUGE.  They either come from a crazy ginormous chicken or a small turkey.  An order of five was just about right for my appetite.  If you do opt for a side of fries, they're the shoe string variety and very crisp.  They might act like more of a filler, but they're not a bad break from all that Seoul Sassy goodness.  I've yet to try anything else on the menu, but 5 stars on the wings is well deserved."
"Yes, I was the person whose life was threatened* when I asked for ranch dressing with my spicy Bud's chicken.  That alone gets an additional star from me!And yes, I was talked out of it but I assured the kind gentleman that if I did indeed require ranch dressing, then he best be gettin' it for me.  But it didn't come to that.  Which is saying a lot from a woman that loves her ranch dressing.I traded chicken with a friend who had the ""don't call it chicken terriyaki"" chicken and agreed that it tasted like chicken terriyaki.  Ain't nothin wrong with that.My beverage of choice that night was a wee bottle of Bacchus-D, which looks like it may contain the cure for botchulism but instead gave me quite the energy boost.  I was told that it preceeded Red Bull by 40 years, and tasted quite similar.  I also plan to use the bottle as a bud vase.Right now the place is cash only, but I'm sure they'll have some sort plastic acceptance soon.*I don't really enjoy having my life threatened...but when it's obviously in a joking matter it's all good."
Wow!  I had the sweet Bar B Q 5 piece and the Buddha Bowl.  Both were amazing and they deliver.  I am hooked.
"A touch over-rated, but very glad that Bi-bim-bop is closer than far north side.I don't think the wings are all that fabulous, but everyone else seems to think that way, so who am I to disagree? Oh yea, that's is the whole point of the review.The burrito thing is decent, didn't really like the hot wings, the Asian BBQ flavor wings are my favorite and the Buddha bowls are very good"
"A friend told me about this place but I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant. Not sure why.. I like wings and I like Korean food so you would think that it would be a win win. I started with the Buddha Bowls, lots of fresh veggies and yummy sauces. I always add the steak and wish that it came in bigger pieces but it is still really good. After ordering with them a few times I finally decided to try the chicken and OMG! It was absolutely amazing. I got 10 wings in 2 different flavors. The wings were huge and the order of 10 wings lasted me for 3 meals. The flavors were really amazing.  I have used both pick up and delivery and both are really fast. The few time that I had them deliver the drivers were always super nice and they ride their bike to my house! Extra props to Crisp for that!"
"A friend invited me here for lunch on day- and being funky and some place I've never been before, of course I was happy to dine.I agree with other reviews that state that place is very plain on the outside and regularly would not give it a second look, but inside it's funky.  Bright colors, picnic style tables and it's small... very small.I thought the decor was cool, but wasn't a fan of the picnic style tables. I prefer sitting with the person or people I'm with one-on-one, rather than  at a table with strangers on top of me. The food, is pretty good. I got their chicken and my friend go the Buddah Bowl, which looked alright.  It wasn't the best chicken I've ever had, but it was tastey.  Here's my biggest issue with the place... It's cash only.  Look, I get it, I do, but it's the twenty-first century, and its a plastic world... I only carry plastic, it's really rare for me to carry cash and for ap lace to only take cash- it's not cool.  And honestly, that knocked it down to 3 stars from me. Overall its good food, decent atmosphere, but you better plan on bringing your dolla dolla billz!  No plastic allowed."
"I really resent enjoying trendy places, a la Hot Dougs or Kuma's, because they can quite busy. Crisp was no different judging by my 25 minute wait. That being said, I really liked Crisp. To start, the menu is really unique with shades of Korean and comfort food blended together. You can find fried mushrooms right along side kim chi here. I tried the fries,  which were fresh and delicious, very good. I also had to try both of their signature sauces, bbq and sweet, so what better vehicle than fried chicken wings? I absolutely loved the wings, only slightly enjoying the sweet a little more. I would absolutely go back here for one of the most unique treatments to good old fried chicken."
"Chicken! Big chicken wannnngs!The place was about to close be we snuck in just in time at 845pm and ordered some regular wings with a side of their bbq sauce.It's pretty pricey, 8.95 for 5 HUGE, i'm talking steroid given chicken, WINGs, and u can add on fries and a drink for 2.95 more.The place is small, so probably not the best for having too many people with you but i went with 2 other friends, 2 of us got wings, she got the spicy bbq, and i got the original with a side of bbq sauce, my other friend got one of the bowlswhen i got my food i was expecting hooters side wings, but the wings are bigger than the palm of my hand! their chicken tastes really good and their bbq sauce is spicy, pretty good, i enjoyed it and was with good company, the price is a little extravagant but it's pretty good for a korean placegive it a try!"
"Big old wings, meaty and crispy skin. Sometimes a girl's gotta have her fix of wings!Seoul Sassy is my favorite.  I would prefer it with more heat, nothing a bottle of hot sauce cannot fix.  BBQ wings is too much sauce for me.  I know a lot of people like it."
"Noticed this place was receiving high reviews from other yelppers and no dinner plans one night last week. Do I need more incentive than that? We're talking BYOB, quick efficient service, menu friendly for vegetarians and carnivores alike, and piping hot, thin fries. What else are you looking for in a restaurant? Oh, extremely affordable prices and wings? They got those too.I'm sad they don't deliver to River North (please reconsider - or create a second location?) and the restaurant could use some more seating space. A sign of a good place is a crowd, but a crowd with limited seating can make frustrated patrons. Though I had to sit at the bar, my vegetarian burrito was slammin. My dining partner had a rice bowl with chicken - and let me tell ya, the chicken tastes like the real deal. Not some crappy meat that you wouldn't touch at the grocery store.This place was so trendy and ahead of the curve I feel like it belongs in the Manhattan dining scene. Looking forward to my next meal!"
"Okay, this place is seriously amazing. Hot chicken wings: FINALLY! I'm a fan of spicy, and these are exactly what I mean when I say spicy.(You do need to specify that you want them spicy, though. You can also order mild, or not spicy at all).The only thing that was iffy about this place was the fact that I did order take-out so it probably would have been better if I would have sat in, but that place is too tiny! There is not enough room for a lot of people to sit in which is a bummer. The fries are what I ordered with my wings, and they're okay (just plain ol' fries, kinda soggy), but the nice thing about em' is that they're HUGE. Like, 3 people could share them and be satisfied. It's BYOB. Friendly staff. Cool drinks (that are non-alcoholic). You'd be lame not to go here."
"Maybe I am a KFC (Korean fried chicken) snob (being a recent transplant from NYC and, quite simply, a native Korean), but Crisp didn't quite cut it for me.  To be fair, Seoul Sassy was pretty tasty.  The meat was juicy and not swimming in grease.  BUT, rather disappointingly, the sauce was only reminiscent of the original Korean fried chicken sweet, tangy, spicy sauce -- not an exact replica.  And what's with no pickled Korean radish as a side?? (This nearly appalled me.) It was quite obvious that Crisp, located in the heart of Lincoln Park/Lakeview yuppie land, was accommodating to the American palette (i.e., sweeter, less spicy, less tangy).  Now, there's nothing wrong with that.  A smart business knows its surrounding market and audience.  And Crisp most certainly is a smart operation.I may well have given it a 5-star review had I never been exposed to the REAL KFC.  But, alas, one cannot fool her/his own native tastebuds.  I'd go back if in the neighborhood.  The plain fried chicken (and maybe some of their rice bowl dishes) perhaps deserves a try."
"I have never been disappointed. There may be a bit of a wait but it is worth it, call in if you're in a hurry. From the Plain Jane to the Chicago and Buddha Bowls this place is just good. Highly recommend."
"Given all the buzz about this place, I had to try it. The fried chicken with seoul sassy sauce had great flavor. But, it was a little too sweet for my palate. The crisp BBQ sauce was supposed to be spicy, but it really wasn't. This was even after ordering it extra spicy. So that was just a little disappointing. The Foodie's Choice Crisp sandwich was just ordinary (not unlike other sandwiches I've had). So, if I came back here again, I'd probably stick with eating the fried chicken. Although quite pricey, a half a chicken could easily feed 1-2 people. If you're ordering take-out as well, just cook your own white rice and save yourself the extra $2.50 charge."
"I have been looking for good wings in Chicago and kept hearing about this place. So this weekend I finally decided to try it out and all I can say is really, really? I say that because I can't believe how good these wings are and how long it has taken me to try them. Where to start, the sauce is amazing, the wings are gigantic and they are cooked to perfection. I love the fact you can order a full size but go half and half on the sauce. This is perfect for sharing and did I mention these wings are quite large. I guess my only complaint would be the fact the wings are so good I'm not sure I will ever try the other dishes on the menu. lol"
"I have to say, for someone that grew up with a ton of Korean friends, I really didn't get into the cuisine very much until pretty recently, mostly due to the fact that I never realized there were non meat options.  I saw the Crisp link on the yelp front page and knew instantly that I had to try it.  I studied the menu enough to know exactly what I was going to try, and the 25 minutes it took me to find parking really made me long for my food even more.  Walking in I was a little hesitant, as there were no Koreans behind the counter and the place really had quite the gringo feel to it, but that was quickly tempered when I realized that all of the Koreans were seated at the tables.  We walked in and they tried to discourage us from ordering the chicken wings saying there was a 25 minute wait for them.  My friend had been looking forward to them and was disappointed and switched to a steak bowl.  I ordered the bad boy Buddha bowl without the egg, but with brown rice and tofu.  We then tried to find a place to sit in the packed restaurant and waited for our food.  My friend was a little ornery when the steak bowl took 20 minutes to come out, though it was noted that it was significantly better than all of the do it yourself Korean BBQ places around.  My bowl was also pretty good, though the sauce was cold and it created a strange temperature change that is probably my only complaint.  I'll be back and ready again to enjoy some fine Korean cuisine."
"I should have written this earlier but after trying the wings... I am definitely a fan and feel like an idiot for getting a Korean burrito here instead of the chicken the first time I went.The wings come in portions of 5 or 10... in reality that means 10 or 20 cause one wing is literally the wing of the chicken so it has all both types of pieces you are familiar with hot wings as well as the end tip of the chicken's wing... that was a little confusing with wing being used in that paragraph in many different ways.The Seoul Sassy chicken wings took me back to the Korean style fried wings that I am used and hold very dear to my heart but kicked up a little notch.  The combination and sweetness of the sauce and the crunch of the batter together go perfectly together.  Each ingredient in the sauce I feel really enhances and balances the flavors out.  Along with that and having to rip the three parts of the wing away from each other, the wings are really a lot of fun to eat.  The Seoul Sassy is definitely my favorite and would recommend it to everyone to try.  The Crisp BBQ wings are definitely Korean influenced and has a great kicked-up-a-notch sweetness and hot flavor from the red pepper paste.  Plus the sauce is messier than the Seoul Sassy and that's okay cause if the food isn't messy than it isn't any good.  The more the food gets on all over your face and fingers the better.If you are getting the Buddha bowls I would recommend you ask for at least an extra red pepper paste or two.  In my bibimbaps, I usually like the minimum amount of red pepper paste as possible, and the amount given here still wasn't enough for me.  There was a good variety of vegetables in the Buddha bowl, however I would have liked for there to be more of each vegetable and beef to be in there as well.The fries are very generic and unsalted.  No real flavor comes from them.  But hey that's nothing a little salt and pepper can't fix.Easy to suffice... the wings are the big draw here and for a very good reason: they're just that damn good."
"Although the chicken wings are like, super sized, forced fed chicken, it's seasoned so well you just forget about it all. Amazing food and ingredients but where the chicken comes from is rather sketchy. All in all amazing food"
"Alright...this is food that reminds me of living on the island of Oahu. A mix of (Hawaiian) local flavors. Definitely my comfort food. . Everything is fresh and to order. The first time I was in here I placed my order and was short a couple of bucks. The owner was super nice and said not to worry about it. I was completely embarrassed but he was as cool as any island dude I knew. I will definitely be here again. Portions are made for your appetite; big or small. Fresh veggies, savor meats, everything just the way you want and innumerable combinations. The flavors will knock you out. Service is friendly and fast...you really can't go wrong."
"OOOOHHH MYYYYY GODDDDDDDDD!I've lived down the street from this place for over a year and only just tried the food last week.  After tasting their wings at a superbowl party this past sunday I HAD to try a buddha bowl (which was highly recommended).I walked in a snow storm tonight (ok, ok, I know it wasn't THAT bad but normally i just hiberate so this was big!) to get myself one. I got back to my place and dug in and tasted HEAVEN. It was so good! I'm an instant fan.If your looking to switch up your normal asian food routine and add some fantastic flavors GO HERE!Chicken wings: A++Buddha Bowl: AAAAAAAAAAAAAA++++++"
"NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM...Imagine a lil boy covered in sticky sweetness all over his hands and his face and the table...  That was me!  My friend was talking and all I heard was WAH wah wah, bah bah wah, la la la...I was absolutely entranced, mesmerized, bound on a spiritual level with this chicken divinity!First the place is nice, the people are even nicer, Thanks Howie for an off the hook fried chicken affair! The food is nearly indescribable but I will do my best...My friends have been not so quietly whispering for quite some time about the religious experience that is CRISP...The day had finally come to pop my Crisp cherry, I was meeting a friend he was talking about how good all the bowl preparations were, and I was like, what about the fried chicken, He said this is a Korean place they don't really have Fried Chicken...  I ask Howie what are your two most popular dishes....  He quickly responds with Two Fried Chicken preparations, my friend who Howie knows by name looks bewildered, he had no idea...  Now he does!I said do it up how you would do it...  Howie did it up good!  Crispy, Gooey, Savory, Sweet, Hot, Juicy, Freaking Perfect!!!I had six enormous wings, I mean these are some big Chicken wing!!!  You will be rocked!  Two BBQ, two ginger soy garlic (Seoul sassy), two Buffalo, and one plain...  Yeah that, good good, great shizzzam!This place rocks on every level!  I was noisy, I was dirty, I was sticky, I was ram shakkle digity digity bing biggidy bam boozle bong dooey de happy dizzle shicky dee booby la la!  Fazzooom!Speaking, eating, loving, getting lost like a child in a happy heavenly hearty flavorful foody fantabulous bomb digity atmosphere!DA BOMB!Oh yeah Ill be back!  You couldn't keep me away if you tried!CRISP!!!"
"Wings are 4.5, I love the way they are fried, but the bowls are meh.  Tiny place, I'd stick to take out."
"I love this place. I forget, I think the Seoul Sassy sauce was really spice, but it is not as spicy now. It is one of those places I do not mind going back again.  I prefer this place over Take Me Out. Be warned, it does get messy there, so not recommended for a nice fancy dinner."
"Overall, I wasn't that impressed with Crisp. We got carryout last night and to be honest, it just wasn't all that. The BBQ strips were spicier than the Buffalo wings, and the Buddha Bowl (basically just Bi Bim Bop) was pretty average. My friend got a steak bowl and from the looks of it, it was pretty much just a ton of rice with a little bit of steak on top. Plus everything was super salty and I thought a little overpriced for what we ended up getting.I might be willing to try Crisp again simply because everyone else has had such a great experience here. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? But gotta say I'm much more likely to head down to Del Seoul for some Bulgogi!"
"I have it on good authority that Crisp accommodates to my inner fat girl, true story. Stopped in here last Friday and though I thought I wanted the Baby Buddha Bowl (their version of bibimbop) I opted for the Seoul Steak Bowl instead. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it -- the first three bites were fantastic....and then the steak (and oil) began to really sit with me so I had to push it aside because eating it in one sitting was not going to happen. My boyfriend ordered a whole chicken -- half Seoul Sassy and half Crisp. Holyballs. These two flavors are virtually unlike one another, Seoul Sassy is tangy and packs a punch while Crisp is sweet and spicy, the latter of which seriously blew my mind.Four stars just for the Crisp flavored drumstick I inhaled, well done folks...well done.Also, I love love the set up here. It's kind of like family seating, giant tables, plenty of chairs, you'll be sharing your dinner with others. Additionally, I love the stools overlooking Broadway -- people watching is always a big fat plus. The guys working here are super friendly, we'll be back for sure."
The wings are AWESOME! I can't wait to get back to Chicago to go back to Crisp...they're that good. And they have Tahitian Treat soda!
"Sweet Jiminy Christmas on a cracker! I just got floored by an avalanche of taste in the form of exquisite wings!!Me (in my head while walking down the street): Oh, I've heard about this place. I think I'll try some of their wings.Guy at counter: Hello, how are you today?Me: Hi, good. I'd like to try some wings. I heard they were pretty tasty.Me (in my head): mmm, something smells really good.Guy at counter: Oh yeah, they're probably the best wings you'll ever taste. At least I think so.Me: You smug bastard. I'm gonna eat my wings right here in front of you and god help you if they are anything less than extremely awesome!Me (in my head): Sounds like a plan! I can't wait to dig into...oop, I said the loud part quiet and the quiet part loud...Well, I took a bite and wow. I, unlike Clinton, inhaled, and before I knew it I was left in a messy, orgasmic-like state wanting more. After apologizing to the cashier for my tourettes and adding to their tip jar, I left a very satisfied customer.Seriously, the Seoul Sassy are very good, the Spicy Buffalo are extremely good, and the Crisp BBQ are best described as heaven on earth meets pact with the devil deliciousness.Do yourself a favor and stop by asap! I seriously might stop by again later today for seconds. Makes sure to bring a bib to protect your clothes and cash, money to pay."
"I had the opportunity of dining here this past Saturday with two good friends.  I thought it was absolutely fantastic.  I never realized it was there.  The owner was super cool and full of enthusiasm about his restaurant.  He spoke to everyone and had a great demeanor.  The food was delicous.  I had the chicken sandwhich with BBQ sauce and my friends had the chicken strips and a korean burrito.  The service was great, atmosphere great and I cannot say enough good things about it.  I would go back for the service alone.  I work in a hotel and oversee the concierge department and have told my concierges to check it out since we all live in the neighborhood.  Send your friends...we need to make sure places like this survive!!"
The chicken wings are big and flavorful. The rice bowl was filling and complimented the spicy wings. The seating is communal and limited. You sit at counter space or heavy duty picnic tables with other diners. Try it!
awesome food
"Best chicken wings in the city.  The bulgogi was also fantastic, but if I have room left over, I just want more wings!"
"So Seoul Sassy...yummm!! After chasing some good ole' Korean wings around, this place does it right with the sassy. Not too much skin, not tough meat, and not that, ""wait, did I just chew a piece of gristle or fat or skin'? It was great with rice, and they have salad, but if you are going to eat fried chicken...is salad really necessary? We also had the BBQ wings, but it was too saucy and thick. Gotta remember the chicken in fried chicken! Overall, I was also relieved to eat Korean wings that didn't make me sweat and cry. Mild spicy people rejoice!Few tables in the place and it was fairly busy while we were there, (Wed night) allow some time to wait it you have a group or come bit o early. If you have a smaller crowd, be prepared to sit with greasy fingered and happy strangers."
"A friend took me to Crisp on a Monday night for dinner where we discovered they were closed. Not to be thwarted, when I realized I was within walking distance later in the week I headed on over for try #2 at these rumored wings. Authentic or not, these are some awesome awesome wings. I got the half order with the Seoul Sassy sauce. I'm normally not a fan of sweeter sauces but this really hit the spot. I am not quite sure how I managed to eat all the food but once you start it is quite difficult to stop. I took the food to go, and saw a couple other orders come out and they all looked fantastic. I can't wait to go back and try a few more things off the menu."
"Seoul sassy is where it is at, bbq might sound good, but there is always hot sauce to add later if you want more heat, next time I wonder if they would mix seoul sassy and bbq.....Don't even like fried chicken and I couldnt put this down."
"Finally! A good bi-bim-bop that's close to home. They call it a ""buddha bowl"", but whatever. It had a good amount of flavorful bulgogi and great vegetables and a good hot sauce.Also, the BBQ wings were awesome. Sticky sauce with an interesting flavor on large meaty wings- what's not to love?Cash only, and a bit pricey but worth it."
"I came to this place with my friend to try the korean ""bowls""(it is a bimbibap right?), and I was honestly fascinated. My friend and I both enjoyed our times here. It is a self-served, narrow place with dim lighting, but the workers are very friendly and water is free. My friend ordered the ""Original Big Boy Buddha"" and I got the ""Seoul Steak Bowl"". Their homemade marinated bulgogi(korean beef) is extravagant! I'm slightly addicted to the unique flavor. The vegetables that they used were also very fresh. The egg on top was perfectly made, for me at least, because I like my eggs not too raw but not too cooked either (about 85% cooked). The fries are well salted, crispy, and thin, just exactly how I like my fries. (They would come in second for me, after Popeyes' Fries.) The food is decently priced, I would not consider this place ""expansive"", for a full bowl of varieties and flavors, that will actually fill you. It's around $8-$13/person.I'm hoping to come back soon for more ""heaven"", from the buddha bowls!"
"I only have two words to sum it up, CHICKEN WINGS!  They are crispy, saucy, and tasty.  I never ordered anything but the wings - why mess with perfection.  Both styles of wings are good, but I prefer Seoul Sassy. The staff is friendly, the foods comes out quick, and it's the best wings in town.  I used to come here weekly, but then went to rehab for my chicken wing problem.  If you have a problem called wings, Crisp is your solution."
"Hello. Fat Girl here.I often get cravings for fried chicken and Asian food.  At the same time.I hate spending time thinking about where I should get food from.I like that Crisp has the best of both worlds! Fried chicken dipped in your choice of sauce, or left plain.  They also have a ton of side dishes to choose from like fries, battered mushrooms, smashed potatoes, onion rings, kim chee, and other good stuff.I can't wait to try their Buddha bowls! They look real tasty! But thats because I love fried eggs on top of my meals!They also have Burritos with an Asian twist of flavors! Yum!"
"Great and unique Chicken wings in a very surprising restaurant.If I was walking by Crisp I wouldn't pay it much attention and most likely wouldn't go in. After reading other yelpers reviews of Crisp I decided to go and try it out. I have only been once but my experience was very good and the staff was extremely friendly at all times.I tried the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crisp BBQ wings and they were both very good but I preferred the Seoul Sassy. For the amount and quality of the wings, I happily paid $8 for the wings.Great wings restaurant and everything thing is cooked to order so you will wait at least 10 minutes for your order. A gem of a fast food restaurant, just wish it was closer to my apartment."
my first korean fried chicken and now I'm addicted and craving for it at this very moment.
"mmmm crisp....what to say? Probably hands-down our faaavvvorite wings of all time.  Get the wings with the seoul sassy sauce....big...not wimpy-sized wings with a light crisp coating...tossed and coated with sweet deliciousness.  Sprinkled perfectly with green onion slices on top.  All I gotta say is...good thing we don't live closer...otherwise, we'd be seriously packing the pounds on this stuff.   SO GOOD!"
The wings and barbeque sauce are amazing.  The fries are also top notch!
"Seoul Bowl: perfect lunchtime treat.  The bulgogi meat was perfectly sweet and salty.  Scallions added some excellent flavor.  The white rice was fluffy, and was the perfect backdrop for the meat and spices.  The sauce was a little bit spicy and a little bit reminiscent of thousand island.  Next time I'm going to try a buddha bowl.  Or chicken wings.  Or the chicken version of the seoul bowl.  Or maybe a whole chicken (with a coworker).  Point is that these guys have Korean food down right.  It's good food fast and it's good food I hope to be enjoying more frequently as I lunch around these parts."
"There were many instances that prevented me to visit Crisp when I moved into the area 3 months ago. First of all, I'm a big fan of Subway so I go there a lot. And whenever I sit right in front of the window, I always see people going to the restaurant next to Subway. That made me wonder what kind of restaurant Crisp was. When I found out that it served great chicken wings, I decided to look it up on yelp and see if it's worth checking out. Well, of course I checked it out!1. My first visit didn't really WOW me except for the fact that the guy behind the counter was extremely nice. I had a half chicken plain jane and the guy gave me 4 sauces to try out because I was new to the place and didn't know what to get. That was very thoughtful. My boyfriend loved the sauces so I took some of them and put it in my purse for later usage. Anyway, the place was very picnic-ish so I thought that was cool. 2. Now, my second visit definitely made me start loving the place. When I got there, the dude behind the counter remembered our names already! I decided to try the Seoul Sassy wings and my boyfriend wanted to try the crispy BBQ wings. Oh. My God. We were both devouring and scavenging our plate. We wanted to have a conversation but to heck with that--we wanted to eat and eat and eat because everything was delicious. We had to grab a ton of paper towels because our hands were covered in the awesome sauce. Later that night, I was craving for more. I really do think they put crack in them 'cause they're addicting!3. I visited them like 3-4 days in a row until my boyfriend told me that it wouldn't be a wise decision because I'd run out of money. The wings aren't dirt cheap and it's not really that expensive either considering we get big momma chicken wings. Compared to other places like Buffalo Wild Wings, the wings that Crisp has is definitely more expensive but MUCH more bigger. 4. And lastly I visited Crisp again yesterday after signing a lease with a friend, so we were like HEY! Let's spend our money and get some chicken. She hasn't been to Crisp before so I told her to look at the menu and see if she'd like anything. She wanted to get one of the Buddha bowls and I got the Seoul Sassy again. She liked her bowl but when I let her try my wings, she said she ""had an orgasm in her mouth."" She definitely loves Crisp and since she's moving in the area with me, she's coming back for more for sure!So overall, the wings are amaaazing. The service is fast and great. The environment was cool and I will definitely be going there more."
"What can I say about Crisp other than, OMG! Talk about some of the BEST fried chicken I've ever had. It only comes second to Raisin' Canes. The chicken is always moist and tender. It is breaded to perfection and never over done. The sauces are nothing but short of amazing. And they still manage to get the other Korean fair, like Bi Bim Bap, to taste absolutely delicious. I always try and bring people to here and they always love it. They give you a gargantuan amount of fries as well, which are also cooked to perfection. I always leave there full. This is definitely a MUST if you come and visit the Chicago Lakeview area!"
"Oh, Crisp. How badly I wanted to love your chicken wings. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I may have set my expectations too high. A friend and I indulged in Crisp a few weeks ago after a rousing game of Scrabble. After battling below-zero temps, I was very excited to attack some celebratory wings. Per Yelp reviewers' recommendations, I ordered both the Seoul Sassy and Buffalo wings, while my friend sampled a Bad Boy Buddha Bowl. The wings themselves were pretty fantastic, I loved the overwhelming size of the actual wing, in lieu of a wimpy drumstick, and the meat was juicy and tender. However, I found the Sassy Seoul sauce to be lacking, and overly sweet. I was surprised to enjoy the buffalo sauce more. The Bad Boy Buddha also didn't meet expectations. The flavors were very bland, and only salvaged by piles of sriracha sauce. I'd try Crisp again, but definitely not my favorite chicken wing experience."
"My good friend recommended this place to me and I have been meaning to go for works. Today I finally got my chance - and I have to say it lived up to the hype.I'm not a fan of buffalo chicken wings so when I saw that they had wings on their menu it kind of grossed me out. Since I had time to kill waiting for friend to meet me I started being that creepy person who starts at other peoples food to figure out what they want to eat. The more I looked around the servings of wings the more delicious they looked. They have three preparations to choose from - no sauce, seoul sassy (soy sauce based) and a spicy BBQ sauce. We opted for the spicy BBQ and wow. They. Were. Fabulous. Nice crunch to the skin, the meat inside was juicy and delicious. The sauce was the perfect amount of spice where you taste the initial sweetness of the sauce and then it rounds out to a nice, but NOT overwhelming spicy end note. Again, as a non-wing eater I was really really impressed. To go with the wings we also went with the Baby Buddha Bowl. The vegetables were crisp and delicious. If you're a vegetarian or just looking for light, refreshing meal this bowl is perfect. Portion is perfect. I was extremely happy with Crisp. Only bad part is that it's right around for the corner from my apartment so I hope can control myself from going to get those wings once a week."
"Some interesting facts about Crisp:I have delicious dreams of this place on a regular basis...I have often awoken licking my fingers.Some of my taste buds reached a state of nirvana after eating here...haven't heard from them since.I have been here on two separate occasions in one day.Seoul Sassy and the BBQ sauces are crazy delicious.  The bowls are great too...but honestly...GET THE CHICKEN.Also, the owner (who I have chatted with a few times trying to lobby longer hours) is very nice."
First time I went there I thought the chicken was extremely good and all of the flavors were extremely tasty.  The second time I went there I took my order to go; but when I got home the chicken tenders were under cooked and dry.  This place is very expensive for what you get and think there are better chicken places that are much more affordable.
So very good. Will return!!!!
"Crisp is brilliant.  Wings are amazing.  For you health freaks and geeks, plenty of options with salads and boxes that rock for only $6.  This place is impossible to beat for a lunch special.   If you live within a 10 minute walk, don't miss it.  Buddha Bowls are outstanding.  I have nothing but the best to pass on about Crisp.  Completely Original. If you've read reviews that don't dig the Korean, I get it.  It's not traditional Korean.  It's sort of a fusion place, with burritos, chicken wings, a decent take on bibimbop.  You really should try it at least 1 time and go from there.  If you're into the style, it's a must go."
"Crisp!  I'm so ashamed.  I feel so silly.You once wooed me with great bowls of glorious treats. The Big Bad Buddha, resplendent in a heap of veggies, fried egg and brown rice.  A bit of heaven there, you have there.  I'm not the kind of guy who's concerned about my individual foods touching and cross-pollenating flavors.  And, these Buddha bowls bring on a menagerie of mixed flavor, glued together with an over-easy egg. I beg you to tell me what sounds bad about that.Even the Chi-Town Chicken bowl with nothing but brown rice and some creamy, spicy sauce accommodating chunks of chicken is deceivingly yummy. When something's good, it's just good.  And, I swear that Atomic Sauce hits the spot.But, how you fooled me, Crisp. How you made me question if I really even know what it means to ""hit a spot,"" when I finally visited you today and tried your jumbo wings.PANG!  It felt like taking a frying-pan to the temple when I finally realized what I had been missing.The Seoul Sassy sauce, with a tangy-sweetness playing yin to the chicken's salty yang... the utterly perfectly crispy fried skin, which holds a satisfying crunch in spite of dripping in sauce and manages to melt in your mouth... the sheer size of these things, offering huge juicy bites to complement the crispy goodness.I don't know how else to say it any other way, these Seoul Sassy wings are black-out good.I'm no connoisseur of wings, but I'm guessing that you and I have BOTH had them in each of the following variety: tiny, dry, rubbery, fatty, bony.  I mean, I've lost so much faith in wings that I'm occassionaly slumming it and ordering them boneless. BONELESS!!  Well, no longer.  Crisp you have restored my faith in fried chicken.Let it be said that the Crisp BBQ sauce 'aint too shabby either.  It's that neon red kind of asian sweet sauce, but with a little kick of heat and smoke.  But, for my taste it was a little overpowering.  Kind of threw the balance of flavors off a little bit. Actually, it more literally took all of the accompanying wing flavors outside and curb-stomped them.Also tried the Kim Chee, which was great.  'Nuff said.650+ Yelp reviewers can't be wrong.  Crisp is it."
"Ordered delivery. I had the seoul sassy and a burrito. It was all pretty good. I ordered rice and didnt' really need to. I called back after I ordered to give some extra details on my buzzer, etc. They were rude and said something about why didn't I tell them that at first. That really turned me off."
"Man I love wings, and whenever there's a inkling of a good wings place I am all for it!  This place is great, self serve, can eat rice with your wings, and it is pretty big with great flavor.  I love korean food and when I found the buddha bowl was a korean rice mix dish (bim bim bop), I wanted to get it but disappointed that there's nothing special about it... if you haven't had it before then try it but don't waste your time or stomach, get their wings!I had their Seoul Sassy chicken and bbq.  The bbq was okay but the seoul sassy was great!  Reminds me of good korean chicken wings.  They are big, juicy, tender, and simply delicious as you take each bite and savor it!  I just wish there were more sauce on these puppies!  Hands down get the Seoul Sassy and avoid the rest.  But I would say these rank in fourth for great korean wings, go to Great Seas or Take Me Out for the best of the best!  But these aren't far behind.btw best part is that since its self served, no need to pay tip!  But sadly the seating here is very small... don't come here with a party greater than 4 unless you feeling lucky."
"I like this place, I go here, but I think that 4 stars should require salivation and at least some lost sleep. Crisp, however, does not offer this level of quality or value. I got the Korean Burrito, because I love weird fusion fast food like that. It was good and all, but it didn't pop, if you know what I mean. It just had that Korean flavor which can be squeezed out of a tube of Annie Chun's. The rest of it - including the meat - might as well have been filler. To recap: good not great, tasty but in a predictable underwhelming - albeit notably Korean - way."
"Honestly, this place has the best chicken wings I've ever had!  And I like to call myself somewhat of a fried chicken wing connoisseur.  The skin was pure perfection, crispy and thick.  And these are not your typical wings you'd find at Bdubs, they are HUGE.  I believe my friend and I tried the Seoul Sassy (garlic soy) and Crisp BBQ sauce.  The Seoul edges out the BBQ by a slim margin.  I honestly can't say enough about the wings, just let the pics speak for themselves!We also had to try the Baby Buddha Bowl while we were there.  Very simple and refreshing.  The veggies were crisp and lightly seasoned and the rice was cooked to perfection.  It was hard to switch back and forth from the bowl to the wings...they were both just so good!My only grip with Crisp is the layout of the place.  There's only a few large communal picnic-looking tables and they're sort of uncomfortable.  Once you take that first bite though, you'll soon forget where you're sitting!I can't wait to come back here!"
"Crisp why do you have to be closed on Mondays?!?!??!!??!?!?!  I left on my flight back to Houston a very very verrrryyyyyy sad girl!!!Came here over the MLK weekend holiday for an all out glutton spree vacation and Crisp.... you hit the surely were on the top of my list!! I had the 5 piece wings, half sassy and bbq, and I like the bbq a tad bit better than the sassy just bc of the lil kick that is in there.  I also has the baby buddha bowl with brown rice, which I think i could have done without because the wings were so big that I only finished 2!!!  I left a sad sad girl then too! But Crisp sure did live up to the hype and I'm glad I came and tried it.  You're in competition with Bon Chon in my book!!  I'm already salivating just writing this review!!! Come to mama!"
"I don't really like chicken, and i especially hate eating things with bones in it (just a weird thing i have) BUT i can't resist eating the wings at Crisp.  How do they make them so crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside?!  The sauces are so good.  The Buddha bowls have me literally obsessed.  I like them with the Seoul Sassy sauce, which i would put on all my food ever if i could."
"Bird, bird, birdBird is the word!I was in Chicago for a week and I was staying near by Crisp. I would pass this place and there was always a line. I thought they were giving out free golden chickens! Oh boy, these were better than the free golden chickens. They were so delicious and crispy! Writing this review makes me want to fly over to Chicago and get some bird."
"I've definitely had better Korean style fried chicken but Crisp was alright in terms of size and texture. We ordered the dark meat Seoul Sassy and found the flavor a good explosion of sweet and spicy. It was also a great portion to share between two people. I also ordered the chicken Korean burrito thinking I was going to get something unique, such as good old kimchee and some spice in the burrito with Japanese rice. It tasted too similar to Chipotle and really tasteless. Service was good for a self serve joint as well as organized. I noticed there weren't any Korean patrons and we all know that if you walk into a restaurant touting something from a particular country or culture and no one from that country is dining there, it's safe to say the food isn't particularly authentic."
"In a nod to other reviews, I'll note they we enjoyed our meal at the unbusy hour of 4:00 pm on a Friday so the staff gave us their undivided attention and the place was quiet. BTW, the staff was also very friendly and helpfully and patiently explained the concept behind the KFC and the Buddha Bowls. Now, for the food. Awesome. We enjoyed wings (big, meaty) with both the SEOUL SASSY and the CRISP BBQ (which were my favorite). Just really darned good. Also we split the CHI-TOWN CHICKEN BOWL with the Atomic Sauce. Very good."
"I went to school with a girl named Jill Crisp and I miss her. So when I heard of this place it made me wanna go -- what? Huh?And even though Jill Crisp was nowhere to be found in CRISP, I still liked it a lot.I had the the Big Buddah Bowl. And they ain't kidding when they say BIG.... tons of food. Plus, an egg on top. My friend got the fried chicken and it smelled like heaven.A lil cramped in there - so try takeout. Or go when it is not super-busy.I recommend this joint. And if you see Jill Crisp there, tell her I say HI."
"Maybe it was a bad day at Crisp but I was not impressed by their food, service or ambiance. I mean the chicken didn't taste bad. It just wasn't special in my opinion. It may have helped if I had room to actually eat my chicken. Since they appear to be doing well perhaps they will expand their seating and overall room in the future. In the end I would much rather eat at about any South side joint that serves up real fried chicken, soul food style."
"so i went totally out of my way to find this place and from what i'd read it was gonna to a great experience.The menu looked great and so i ordered a budha bowl and some wings. The bowl was with beef which was way too sweet, sickly so and the wings were bearable. Sorry but this place is not a contender. go somewhere else and spend your bucks."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!The food here is so good. The chicken wings are awesome and the bi bim bop is my favorite. The staff is AMAZING. One time we waited a little longer than normal, so we asked about our food and the guy at the counter forgot to put the order in so he refunded our money AND got our food to us right away because he didn't want us to leave with a bad impression of the place. Needless to say, the money went in the tip jar because really, who does that?!Fantastic, glad to have it in the neighborhood, it will always be my go-to."
We ordered a Seoul Sassy chicken and a small order of the breaded/ fried mushrooms. The food was great and the takeout service was very quick (10-15 minutes during peak hours.) The only quasi-complaint is that they don't have many traditional side dishes on the menu.
"Everyone knows I love hot wings so I keep hearing, ""Have you tried Crisp?""... well, now I can say, ""Yes.""  So here's my honest review... we tried the Bad Boy Buddha Bowl (w/ Beef), jumbo wings with Seoul Sassy sauce, and jumbo wings with Crisp BBQ sauce.Buddha Bowl - We got the one with 8 veggies and beef.  The size is generous.  The only veggie I didn't completely agree with was the corn... I haven't seen corn in the Korean version (bibimbap)... well... ever... but that didn't stop me from devouring it - and liking it.  The gotchujang (red hot) sauce was far from spicy, and it was almost sweet, which left me a little disappointed  If they're going to advertise it as spicy sauce, they should give the patrons an option for real ""spicy"" sauce.  Of course, they should keep the spicy version behind the counter lest some Lakeview patron unknowingly burns a hole in his tongue thinking it's ketchup.  Buddha Bowl = 4.0 starsWings with Crisp BBQ Sauce - I believe they are trying to go for the Korean wing ""kkanpongi"" taste here, but it's been tamed down a little bit for the local tastebuds.  The Korean version is much spicier and contains more garlic.  This version at Crisp is good, but it could be better if it were a tad spicier and a little less salty.  But overall, I like it.  Crisp BBQ Sauce = 4.0 starsWings with Seoul Sassy Sauce- I'm not quite sure what to make of this. It wasn't spicy.  And it wasn't really sweet.  And it didn't have much kick.  It just wasn't much of anything memorable.  I recall eating it, but not really being able to taste much of it.  And if I have to strain to taste it... well... ok.  If I were eating wings at a bar, I would say this would be close to Teryaki, but a very mild version.  So from my viewpoint, it wasn't all that.  Seoul Sassy Sauce = 2.5 starsService and Establishment - Nice location in Lakeview.  Lots of foot traffic in the area.  Parking is spotty, but not impossible.  Several communal type bench seating areas and some stool seating as well (can get a little awkward).  It can get busy at times.  Helpful staff (plus a cute cashier is always a plus).   Good selection of drinks. Fast service.  You can tell this place puts in effort.  Overall = 4.0 stars.Total average rounded up to 4 stars.Eat at Crisp.  If choosing between Crisp BBQ sauce or Seoul Sassy, go with the Crisp BBQ."
Thought it would be mostly hype but Crisp delivered pretty well.  My roommate killed the leftovers cold the next day and was blown away (not bad for fried chicken).  They also delivered it in a half hour which is rare for the city.I really enjoyed the Sassy Seoul and BBQ sauces (ask for a little more spice if you're in to that).Also got a Baby Buddha Bowl with Beef to share which was a great compliment to just having a load of fried stuff.
I split a Baby Buddha Bowl and an order of wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce and was really impressed with both dishes. I didn't expect the Baby Buddha bowl to be so tasty and the sauce on the wings were excellent. My mouth waters every time I think about going. Wings were huge by the way.
"Crisp....you have been in my dreams since I've eaten you last....Crispy, tasty, meaty wings, how I adore thee...and don't forget the bad buddha bowl.Honestly, my only complaints here are the parking and seating arrangement.  But once you taste that chicken...you will be hooked!"
"When people say fusion, you think French/Vietnamese, American/Japanese, (something white)/(something asian)... but Crisp takes fusion to another level. It's a melting pot of different cultural cuisines: burritos, bulgogi, kim chee, chicken burgers, fried chicken, and all around goodness.There's 3 things that I stick to:1. Bulgogi burrito2. Fried chicken3. Buddha bowlReally, numbers 1 and 3 go together. It's like ordering a burrito vs a rice plate at Chipotle, except 10 times tastier, and maybe healthier? You've got your daily serving of meat in the bulgogi, daily serving of veggies w/ the carrots, lettuce, tomato, some other veggie stuff, and then your grains with the rice. For extra pizzaz and daily vitamins you'll want to top it off with their secret sauce, also known as ""crack"", w/o the jittery repercussions, just arterial. As for the fried chicken, I like mine with Seoul and with a bit of Sass. Nothing like glazing some crispy salty fried chicken with a sweet tang and chopped onions. For a multi-cultural explosion of flavors in your mouth, go to Crisp. You won't spit, you'll swallow."
"Huge, flavorful wings.. like! The BBQ was too spicy for me (yup, i'm a weenie) but also good for the 1 second before it burned.Ordered delivery the first time, then brought a wing-fanatic friend of mine the second time. Wing-fanatic approved."
"not a fan of the setup, it is crowded, loud, and self serve. Small seating area crammed with long rustic wooden dinning tables. I tried the Original Bad Boy Buddha consisting of Eight different freshly marinated and/or sauteed chilled vegetables on a bed of rice and topped off with a fried egg. Served with Buddha bowl sauce (Gochujang). Now they definitely don't skimp on the portions, I ate this for 2 HUGE meals, but unfortunatelysize doesn't always matter, especially when its a dish consisting of mostly rice. I added the chicken, but was kind of weirded out by the texture. Just really not a lot of flavor to me, I was forced to add way too much soy sauce and I am not a salty kind of girl, sassy yes, but not salty. My darling dining partner got the Crisp BBQ chicken, in the half size portion, it came out disassembled looking more like wings and legs you would get from Buffalo Wild Wings', but meatier obviously. Again huge portions, but like some other reviewers have mentioned, there is more fat that I prefer on the meat. I believe everything I hear, (its my one and only fault). After reading all the fabulous reviews I had definitely placed Crisp on a pedestal that unfortunately they did not come close to reaching for me. If your in the area and find yourself here I would go with the chicken since it seems to be the better choices over the Buddha bowls, but I wont be back any time soon."
"The sauces on the fried chicken are good, but try it plain jane, it's better. Want variety? Ask for some atomic (usually for the burritos) to dip the chicken in. Solid. I get the buddha bowl when I want something a little healthier, it's a good bi bim bop, if only it were available dolsot (hot bowl_ style!Between the chicken, the bowl, and the burritos it's easy to overlook the shrooms, but that'd be a mistake, they crispy on the outside. Although you may not want to get these delivery, they're best hot."
"For anyone who has never had Korean chicken wings (or GASP! never had Korean food at all!), this is a good starter.  I could do without the cheesy names, but if a name like Seoul Sassy will get more people to try the perfect combination of sweet, salty flavors highlighting the fried chicken, then Seoul Sassy it is.  We had the Seoul Sassy and Plain Jane wings, with sides of the other sauces to try them all; Seoul Sassy wins by a long shot - Plain Jane really is plan and seems boring by comparison, although if you had it on it's own I'm sure it's fine -- nice and crispy, for certain.Service is friendly, and they've repainted and spruced it up since the Rice Box days, making it a more pleasant environment overall.  The owner was nice enough to bring us a plate of ""The Green and The Orange"" - but.... the veggies were soggy, not crisp or fresh, and the ranch dressing on the side was clearly bottled.I haven't tried other items on the menu, but it seems to me like they're suffering from too many choices.  Wings, sandwiches, burritos (a bi bi bop burrito?), salads, rice bowls and ""buds""  -- which can be steamed, fried or pan fried -- left me confused about what their ""specialties"" were.  (On a side note:  $10 for a bowl of rice and veggies -- essentially a veggie bi bim bop without the traditional fried egg -- seems like a lot for me -- and the meat is still extra...).Definitely come for the chicken -- and hopefully, given some time, they'll figure out the rest.FYI -- The cash only situation is on-going -- the owner told someone else it might be a couple weeks -- it seems like they should put up a sign to warn people, but plan on cash only for now."
You've got to be kidding me! I have been coming here for almost two years and while I am obsessed with the Buddha bowl's I had no idea how amazing the chicken is! I mean I am salivating just thinking about it. That is some phenomenal chicken you have Mr. Crisp! I guess I'll be back to order family style for myself very soon!
"I like the concept of this small chicken stop!  You can get some simple yet tasty chicken or rice bowl dishes.  All Korean, but in some ways it is catered more towards the American audience, however, I do find it very good and would eat here or pick up from here if I lived closer."
This is crack.
"Had the wings here, and perhaps I was expecting too much from the great yelp reviews. It was good, but my mind was not blown. The wings were sizable and meaty. The sauce was indeed tasty. But I wouldn't travel across town for it. If in the neighborhood, it's definitely worth dropping in."
"Didn't have the chicken like most folks who come here, instead I had the ""Baby Buddha"" Bi Bim Bop ..... it was alright, nothing special. One comment I have is the egg that is one top of the rice had it's egg white edges cut off. Strange. Why do that and where do the edges go? Just leave the egg alone, please!Next time I'll try the fried chicken."
"Selling Asian food to Americans is such an easy out.4 stars for the wings.  They're very average as far as Korean wings go, but its really hard to go wrong there.  Crispy, saucy, strong flavors. Yum.If you're looking for good food, skip everything else at this establishment.  Buddha bowls are basically subpar Bibimbap.  Korean Burritos -- nice work on westernizing it and throwing it into a tortilla, but its just really not good food.I've been a few times and wouldn't mind going again, but only for wings."
"Get it in! I say, get It IN!!!Yuh huh, I be at Crisp getting it in with the Korean burrito! Cause they are dynamite. Ooooh that chicken, lemme talk about the chicken. . . . .  fantabulous.  Yep, methinks that a word. I know, I know. Hush, it's ok. Korean burrito does sound unnatural when first approached by it, but it's not whatever atrocity you may be imagining in your mind. Their version is basically bi bim bap in a tortilla w/o an egg.  And it's GLORIOUS! Out of their ""You so Crazy! Korean Burritos"" (that's what is says on the menu) I've had the Seoul Sensation and the Chi-town chicken. They're basically the same except the Seoul Sensation is made with bulgogi.  It automatically comes with their atomic sauce, which from what my friend says who can handle their fair share of spicy is really hot, so if you aren't into the fire you should ask for their delish ginger sauce instead. I've also had the Greg's Grillmaster sandwich.  I've liked it all, but the Seoul Sensation is what I can't help but get every time I go back.  Oh, um you should know that if you eat in you may be sitting picnic table style with people you don't know.  Sometimes this is cool for me and sometimes it's not. It really all depends on who ends up sitting there, lol.  Otherwise the light is vibrant and sets up a lively environment.  The music isn't too loud and your food comes out in a timely manner. I go out of my way to come here and there's few places I do that for. Don't let your sour vision of a Korean Burrito turn you off and go try one.  Sure, the wings are most likely orgasmic, but be adventurous. I bet you'll like it."
"Here is the deal: we ordered a half order of the Seoul Sassy and the BBQ. Side by side the BBQ is the clear winner, the sauce really packs a punch and highlighted the too mild and subtle flavors of the Sassy wings. Definitely would go back and stick with the BBQ."
"Good wings, though at times a bit over-sauced.  A good choice for Korean fried chicken in Chicago.  In terms of Korean Fried chicken I hold them all to the BonChon NYC standard which this fails to meet."
KOREAN CHICKEN WINGS are the besssttt! Not too greasy but perfectly crispy on the outside with various flavors. Crisp's wings are HUGE and the seoul sassy was my favorite! It's also BYOB so u can bring your own beer to eat with your chicken wings. MUST TRY!
"KFC really stands for Korean Fried Chicken. Picking up the little man from the Southport Trick or Treat and the Android Yelp App comes across Crisp and it was on. Here was the family order:Seoul Sassy Whole Fried ChickenSeoul Steak BowlSide of Kim Chee and Onion Rings?The meal really hit the spot. Thank goodness we ordered take out, brought it home, and had an extra pot of rice waiting. The Seoul Sassy sauce was awesome. The Seoul Steak Bowl did not stand a chance for the kiddies were starving.Thank you Crisp and Yelp Android App. You make the family trips to the city all the more reason to keep coming back."
Seoul Sassy is great on anything: wings or chicken breast. The bibimbap (you have to ask for beef if you want meat on it) is pretty good too; the 'baby' version is actually enormous.
"We came here after a long night of searching for a restaurant.  Korean food seems to be our default choice of food, since it's usually really tastey and satisfying.This place was definitely satisfying. We ordered 2 whole chickens- half seoul sassy and half bbq.  The guys devoured the chicken!! We also had an order of jumbo wings, just as delish and huge. I'm not sure what kind of chickens they used, but the wings were big.Drinks were $1 and there were plenty of towels to wipe are sauce filled fingers.  Great place to hang out with friends too. I think I like this place more than BonChon-- just because there's more sauce variety. =)"
"Forget Virginia...THIS PLACE is for lovers...bi bim bop and chicken wing lovers . This place is one of my favorite spots in the city of Chicago due to their bountiful offerings which include two of my favorite foods...CHICKEN and BI BIM BOP! Every time I eat here I must order both. I end up in an intoxicated state of bliss. Not sure if I want to break out into the ""running man"" or write a love song. I urge you to try Crisp. It may be the only meal in recent memory that I've actually said a prayer AFTER eating! BTW...ignore the posts about not bringing a date here since the wings are a lil messy to eat. You SHOULD bring a date here to see if they can hold their own. If they roll up their sleeves and aren't afraid to get ""saucy wit it"", then pass the wetnaps...you just may have yourself a keeper."
"I love this place.  The food is consistently good, great value.  I wouldn't call it exactly healthy but delicious for sure.  I also love the open shared seating, have had some fun times here."
"I love this place! Everytime I'm in Chicago, its a must I get me some Crisp. The price is right and the grub is delicious. I've never had a meal on the menu that I was disappointed with. Give the Magic Mushrooms a shot as a side."
"Truly a very unique fried chicken place. The food is a little pricey but it's delicious. You can't go wrong with any of the flavors (I like the Korean BBQ the best) and they give you a TON of skinny fries which are worth munching on. The workers there are friendly and actually hold a conversation sometimes, and they often play game shows on their giant widescreen. My only gripe is that the place is a little small and sometimes is hard to find seating, last time I went with my buddy we had to share a table with these chicks, one of them kept on giving me a look like ""you sure you should be eating that?""Definitely come here at least once, and come hungry and you won't be disappointed."
"Best fried chicken, hands down.  LIke a lot of people have been saying..the Seoul Sassy is the best. If you're going with other people, I would recommend just getting a bunch of different things and just splitting it b/c everything on the menu is worth trying. The sauce for the fries is pretty good as well."
These wings are so amazing you can't even believe it and the fried mushrooms are so great that I swear they are even better without any of the sauce that comes with them. Odd thing about Crisp...I've mentioned to friends this strange thing that happens to me when I'm eating the chicken here and they have said it happens to them too. I'm sitting there trying to get every little bit of chicken and sauce into my mouth and it dawns on me maybe that's a part I shouldn't be eating? But I don't care. I keep eating. and eating. until it is certain that only bone remains. At other places I would have a few bites of my wing or whatever and then move on to the next piece and not go crazy. Not go into some zombie like feeding frenzy.Crisp turns me into a chicken eating monster.
"ALL YOU LITTLE CHICKENS GET IN MY MOUTH.I've been craving fried chicken for a long time... crisp really hit the spot. It was a wet, humid, muggy day out.we walked into crisp with NO dehumidifier and NO AC...by the time i finished my BBQ (mild) wings... i was covered in sweat. GOOD thing it was raining outside when we left. No one could tell the saturation on my clothing was from an internal source.Anyways... These are delicious chunks of chicken. Tasty and fun.My only issue with this place was... the cashier was arguing with the chef so it was rather... uncomfortable... but once we got our chicken things were awesome."
"Korean fried chicken is muy delicioso!!! The sauces were tasty and the chicken was tender and juicy. Just the way I like it. I do feel they're a little over priced for the actual portion size, but they definitely know their chicken. The staff is fun and quirky which fits the neighborhood. And I love that they have coat racks to accommodate their patrons during the fall, winter and spring months since their seating has a tendency to be a bit awkward (it's arranged as if you're joining a bunch of strangers at a hibachi grill). I hear the salad's are awesome and they're next on my list to try."
"I come to Chicago at least twice a year to visit family. So, I've been wanting to try this place ever since I first saw the reviews on Yelp about a year ago.Living in New York for the past 5 years, I've been addicted to Korean fried chicken: Kyochon, Bon Chon, Kyedong and UFC. Not to mention, I absolutely love bibimbop. So, of course, I've been looking forward to trying the food at Crisp.So, last month, I finally had the opportunity try this place. Three of us ordered the following: Original Bad Boy Buddha, half of the Plain Jane, and half of Crisp BBQ. I'm going to be completely honest, the Original Bad Boy Buddha and Plain Jane were just okay.  Granted, the Buddha was a different version of the Korean bimbimbop, but the three of us weren't impressed by it.  The Plain Jane was just okay, and we didn't really dive into it.  However, the Crisp BBQ had really good flavor, and we devoured it.Like I said, I guess I've been spoiled with NY korean friend chicken locations. The chicken at Crisp was WAY TOO greasy.  I know it sounds crazy, but the way the fried chicken is prepared at Kyochon, Bon Chon, Kyedong and UFC, there is HARDLY any grease. It's hard to believe, but until you try it, you'd understand. After eating a dozen, there are only some traces of grease.  However at Crisp, after eating the fried chicken, there was a thick layer of grease.My pros: Crisp BBQ had good flavor, service was FANTASTIC (no matter how busy, they would take the time to answer any questions; attentive and very polite), and the ambiance (I enjoyed the indoor picnic feel)."
"I happened to be in town when they announced they were voted best chicken in America last year.  Came...sign on the door says they ran out of food and would open back up in a few hours.  Time flies and it was worth it.  Tried the buddha bowl + chicken wings.  Extremely tasty, sauced correctly, bigger, and whatever adjective you want to insert here.Staff was cool and friendly. Very upfront about the wait and told plenty of jokes to ease the then frantic atmosphere.Wish I brought some for the plane ride back home to LA.  I'll make sure I come here when I'm in town again."
"I will say that the chicken is delicious and crispy as the store name would suggest. The BBQ is a lil spicy, but all and all I would go here again!"
3 words...best chicken ever. Seoul sassy sauce cant be beat. I'm in love. First time I ate here I returned the next day for more of the chicken. Absolutely the best I have ever had. And fried chicken is my favourite food so I have had plenty of experience with it. You have to try it.
"This is a very COOL twist to your traditional korean restaurant. The experience is one of a kind. The food had an explosion of flavors in every bite. Sauces are to die for!We went on a sunday just 1/2hr before they close, although we were a little confused when we first walked in there partially due to its seating and ordering style. The guy at the counter which helped us out was very nice, helpful, and welcoming. The place is quite small with a limited menu and seating area (which felt more like a take-out joint) but packed with huge flavors!You definitely get your moneys worth! So we'll be back...Thanks Crisp!"
"There's nothing particularly Korean about this place other than that red sauce they use on the Buddha Bowl, but they're pretty upfront about that.  The menu clearly spells out that these are American takes on Korean dishes, and I'd agree with that.  But who cares, if you want Korean food, go to a Korean restaurant.  This place is a fried chicken hut and they do a great job.The buffalo sauce is standard issue Frank's Red Hot and the other sauces are pretty sweet (ok very sweet) with some nice heat to balance it out.  The chicken pieces are moist and the skin is crisp.  You won't mistake this for standard American Fried Chicken, it's got a different texture.  We never order in chicken wings because they're so easy to make, but this style of fried chicken requires special equipment, so Crisp is our go to for wings.The buddha bowl is a pretty pathetic example of bi bim bop and I haven't mustered the courage to try the burrito.  Stick to the chicken."
"Oh yummy, yummy Crisp!  Having lived in Flushing, Queens for a while, you would think that I'd be more familiar with Korean BBQ.  Uh, no.  Crisp has provided me with Korean BBQ 101, and I can't wait to advance.Crisp's chicken is exactly that, crisp AND very delicious.  There are a multitude of flavors to choose from, and watch out! An order of wings is the most supremely succulent experience, heightened only by combining with football on Sunday afternoon.  The order was taken quickly and efficiently, with yummy hot food arriving at my doorstep within 35 min.  Yes kids, Crisp delivers!"
The food was absolutly wonderful!! We ordered the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. We got 5 of each and we paid $19. The wings were huge so no complaints on paying $19.  When The only slight complaint i have would be the staff. having never been there before we didnt really know what to order or how. There was no menu by the registers so we just kind of asked. Despite the menu issue i will be back and i suggest others try it!!!
"Everything I ever wanted out of vegetables, rice, and chicken. I gave it a ""4"" because it cost a little more than would be expected and there are no fountain drinks, just cans.Yum!"
"Yum.That's not all that can be said about Crisp, but that's how I'm starting. It was good. I like wings. I ordered a half order and couldn't finish. They were in seoul sassy sauce, which was tasty. And the chicken-super crisp (duh) and delicious. Very good hot. I'm struggling to describe my meal, as it was really good. I didn't finish all of my wings, which made me sad. The rest of my party got the bulgogi rice bowl, which I tried some of, which was also excellent-a little sweet for my taste, but I can deal with it. Plus, there's sirracha on the table, so putting that to good use on everything is always a plus.Boyfriend got chicken tenders in the hot sauce. He didn't like them, but I say he was probably expecting something else. I think the meat on the bone is the real winner here, friends.Fries were excellent, not a soggy one in sight. Pop selection was legit but pricey and I guess I didn't realize that water was free right away or else I would have just done that to begin with.I'll be back for sure."
"I pass it all of the time and I'm always curious about it. II came home the other day and had some time to spare before dinner. I looked up Crisp, both the website and the Yelp reviews (of course). I was excited with the 4 star rating and ecstatic reviews, but of course also wondering ""Could it really be THAT good?""Anyway, I tried the Not So Common Crisp sandwich minus mayo, with the BBQ sauce. I got the meal which included a side of fries and a can of pop. I was actually ecstatic at their diet pop selection. Might seem like a small detail, and trust me, I'm a diet coke fan, but I just feel like everywhere ONLY has diet coke. Not Crisp! Diet Sunkist, Diet Root Beer, Diet 7-Up, Diet Dr. Pepper! Finally! Anyway, I got home and I took a bite, and... oh my gosh. Definitely the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The chicken, as other reviewers say, is amazing. It's perfectly moist and crispy. The BBQ sauce, to die for. The perfect blend of sweet and spicy. It was absolutely delicious and I can't wait to go back and try their other things. Next time I'll probably try the Sassy Seoul sauce (though it will be hard not to get the BBQ again). One thing - I got the fries basically because I just wanted to try them. I'm actually not a huge french fry fan but I figured it made sense to get the meal for $2.00 more. Well, the fries could feed about 4 people (the small fry). They are huge. I didn't even eat 1/4 of them after the filling sandwich. They were good, similar to McDonalds, maybe a little less cooked... But they're not necessary. There are way too many unless you're splitting them with someone.Anyway, the fabulous chicken sandwich with a diet orange crush made my day! I will be back. One thing to remember: It's cash only, but they do have an ATM inside."
"I'm from Toronto and was biking through Lakeview and saw the reviews on the window. What a find! Best wings I've had in my life - Seoul Sassy and BBQ are both good options but BBQ takes the cake! Knocking off one star for price. Otherwise, awesome!"
"What more can I say about this place..... They have THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS I have ever had in my life! And this statement comes from a huge huge fan of chicken wings. I have tried chicken wings in many places with many flavors, but NOTHING beats Chicken Wings from Crisp with its Seoul Sassy. Simply delicious AND addicting. I MUST go there once a week at least. Slurpppp.."
"To quote Rachel Ray I will say ""YUMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"" to Crisp. We were in the hood going to the theater and I had wanted to try something in the vicinity (aka didn't want to have to re-park).  I had seen Crip on Yelp as a hot spot and looked at the reviews a few a weeks ago and off course the extremely appetizing and yes, even mouthwatering photos. I believe a little drool may have even sipped out when I was looking at the wings...gulp.Anyway, we went, we saw and boy did we conquer!  The place is tiny and let me tell you that on a Friday night at 8:15pm it was pretty packed. They have 2 ""bar like"" seating areas and the rest are family style tables, so there really is no privacy for intimate conversations...aka, not good for first dates.  I have to say that we (the fiance and I) didn't even talk much since we were concentrating on eating almost the whole time. This off course in between, breathing, drinking, licking our fingers and commenting on the deliciousness.We had the Big Buddha bowl with steak (I got both sauces on the side, which was great since it was nice merriment of sweet and spicy) and we also got wings.  We did half and half - Spicy BBQ and Seoul. It was all wonderful and the quality was top notch. I have to admit I'm not much of a wing person b/c of 1. I'm REALLY picky, b/c they have to be crisp, and made just right (no slimy, stringy chicken skin 2. I don't like the actual wing, just the drum stick (I don't know why, so don't ask) 2. calories and fat (I know, I know). BUT, that being said...the wings here were just right and with those killer sauces....mmmmm.....I'm still licking the leftover sauce from my fingers...ok, not really.GO here and you won't be dissapointed...all these great reviews don't lie!  The staff is friendly, efficient and give good suggestions (as they did for us)."
"Best Fried Chicken I've ever had. No question.We arrived after 8:30pm which means you can only do carryout, this wasn't a problem because there is zero parking in the area. I really want to write more but honestly if you want amazing chicken 'wings' you cannot go wrong here."
"Great chicken wings or try the half chicken.  I haven't tried anything else.  It is a once a month treat, that combined with a pbr and I'm pretty set for the evening.  Seoul Sassy, you are my rocking hot date and if you're not available or in the mood, I'm hanging with Crisp BBQ.  Hopefully, my dating life will improve so I don't have to make these ridiculous, but tasty dates.  Maybe I'll try something else at Crisp, but I'll stay faithful to the fried wings and half chick, for now."
"My girlfriend and I went here on my 35th birthday since I wanted to have some good fried chicken. I had heard about this place on the Yahoo ""10 best chicken places in America"" article and thought Korean fried chicken sounded too intriguing to miss!Some of the BEST fried chicken I have ever had! We got the ""Funke Chicken Combo"" (which had a whole chicken, two sides, and two drinks), and a Baby Budda Bowl. All together it was a whole fried chicken, an order of deep-fried mushrooms, an order of onion rings, a side dish of Kimchee, a Baby Budda bowl, and 2 drinks for around $35! The prices are VERY reasonable considering the portion sizes and quality of the food.  The chicken is cut asian style (not whole pieces of breast or thigh but chopped into smaller sizes), and can either come plain (don't let that fool you, it is nicely spiced and very tasty), or coated with one of their sauces (ginger-teryiaki, bbq, and hot and spicy).  The Budda bowls come in a variety of styles and flavors, but it is basically stir fried vegetables over rice with a sauce and a fried egg on top, and comes in three sizes, baby, normal, and big.They also have excellent wings, side dishesNow, although the food is excellent, the place itself has a few issues that need addressing. First of all, parking is somewhat of a problem as it is street  metered parking only. Second, the actual dining area is TINY, with four picnic style tables and a couple of counters to eat at, which can make things very crowded if the place is busy. And finally, the place isn't a resturant, it is a counter order-pick up food kinda place, so don't expect service or for the food to be ready quickly, on the plus side it was very hot and fresh, so it is definitly worth the wait!Oh and when I mentioned it was my birthday and how I had been excited to come and try the place out, the guy behind the counter gave me a free coupon for a whole chicken on my next visit!All in all, a place for GREAT chicken, interesting side dishes, and good food, but not a great place for sit down dining during the lunch or dinner rushes."
"Awesome food. Enjoyed my daughter's chicken fingers almost as much as the massive Big Boy Buddha bowl with bulgogi, which was piled with vegetables and perfect with some Sriracha. I guess I agree with the folks who say that the fries are nothing special, but they were perfectly fine and everything else we had was delicious. Definitely will be back to try the fried chicken."
Great tasty crisp wings.
"Two words: Seoul Sassy.  So they use organic free range chicken wings.  If Crisp did not make that disclaimer on the menu I would have thought I was eating freaky mutant steroid injected wings...because they are gigantic!  Seriously though, the wings were so delicious.The buddha bowl was pretty good too, but honestly, after eating 3 wings, I was almost full.The only negative was that I was abnormally thirsty after my meal...MSG?"
Very interesting. Yummy flavors and good concept but a bit salty
"I was really excited about going to Crisp because it looked like such a cute place (I am the ideal consumer.. a sucker for any sort of advertising gimmick :P) and I'm a huge fan of bonchon (Korean fried chicken).The 4 of us shared two of their ""dinner specials"", which is a pretty good deal. I believe it's about $20 for a whole chicken and you can pick the flavors. You also get two sides and two drinks. We decided to try the BBQ, Seoul Sassy, and the Buffalo. The Seoul Sassy was definitely my favorite, with a nice hint of sweetness (and it tasted the most ""Asian"" which was what I was looking for). The flavors were all relatively tasty but some of the pieces of chicken were on the dry side. For our sides, we got fries, onion rings, and fried mushrooms. They were all pretty good, but then again what doesn't taste good after it's been battered and deep fried? Overall food = good enough but not amazing. This is definitely not bonchon in NYC Ktown. What I really DIDN'T like about Crisp was the fact that they have communal tables. The space is pretty small so I can see why they do it, but it's really inconvenient and cramped and compromised my experience significantly. I had nowhere to to put my bag/coat because we were sitting on a bench shared with many others! Also, the bathroom was filthy. The toilet was beyond clogged and in unacceptable condition.. gross! If I go back it will be for take-out, and to try their bibimbop bowls!"
"Came to Chi Town on a visit to see an life-long friend of mine.  He lives in Lakeview and Crisp was easily within walking distance, so upon a recommendation he got from another friend, we decided to try it out.  Like most of the shops/retail spots in Lakeview, its a bit crowded - the decor seemed to be familiar, as if we'd seen all the furniture in pottery barn or some similar store.  Regardless, it worked for function less aesthetics (it doesn't detract, but doesn't stand out either).I ordered a bowl - Seoul Steak Bowl - and my buddy ordered a Chi-Town Chicken Bowl.  The food was made quickly as they called our names before we could finish selecting drinks, gathering utensils & napkins and finding a seat.The bowls are huge in their portion size, and come with a side sauce that it like a dressing but with spice.  When combined, the flavors are rich, spicy and quite delicious.  My bowl was beef, veggies, rice and spices.  The flavor of the meat was quite unique (and tasty) and it was tender - not too chewy.  As I ate, I noticed myself wanting to shovel more and more in my mouth and before I realized it I was:  1) stuffed and 2) had finished 85% of the bowl.  This food was quite addictive.I'd love to go back here, next time I'm in Lakewood, to try their other dishes.  Many people there were getting wings, which smelled and looked quite tasty.  If you're in the area, stop in, you won't regret the choice."
"This place is good and almost gets that fried chicken itch I have once in awhile...but not quite. I still miss the perfect crispiness of 99 chicken (in Santa Clara, CA), but this place is pretty close. We had ordered the Seoul sassy and plain. They were flavored well but just not exactly what I was looking for. Overall, it was satisfying and there was plenty of food to go around (we ordered a whole chicken and ended up bringing almost half home). Will definitely return to try the Buddha bowls."
Great place for a quick bite of delicious food. The Foodie sandwich is very good!
"I had their wings once and now I crave them!  Jumbo, delicious, sweet, crispy and spicy = Crack WingsI just wish they had more comfy seating."
"Because I want to live past 35, I'm not a fried chicken guy. But I am completely hooked on Crisp's Seoul BBQ. It's got a nice sweet bite, and cooked perfectly.My wife didn't like her Buddha Bowl, it was a little cold and limp, but with a little extra Schezuan sauce and a hit in the microwave it was much improved."
"Came here and we got a whole fried chicken, two sides and two cans of pop for $20. That right there won me over. Best part is it was delicious!!! I'm excited to come back and try more stuff after reading all the other reviews."
"I might be considered a Crisp groupie, the food is simply delicious. It is busy at night, but you can BYOB which is nice. I have had delivery many times and it is all quick and the delivery people are very nice. I like the wings which are the size of small children. Fries are amazing!"
"I'm a Chicagoan transplanted to Arizona via Boston/New York who makes frequent trips to LA for Korean food and, of course, Disney for the kids.  My wife and kids are totally Korean, and we can't go on a trip anywhere without having Korean food at least once a day.  I won't boast, but I feel that I have a pretty good feel for excellent Korean food given my frequent trips to LA and Seoul.  We were recently in Chicago staying on the Mag MIle, and Yelp kept steering us to Crisp.  We met up with another family there and ordered about ten items off of the menu family style.  The food was just phenomenal!  For chicken, we had the Seoul Sassy whole chicken, Wacky Wacky Wings, and Chicken strips for the kids.  For sauce, we did the Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ.  The chicken was moist and perfectly cooked.  Oftentimes, we will go to a place like this and get chicken that is dry...that was not the case here at Crisp.  As their name suggests, the outer portion was crisp and tasty while the inside was moist.  The sauces were...amazing.  I preferred the Seoul Sassy because it had a slightly ""deeper"" taste to it.  If I had not had the choice, I would have been happy woith the Crisp BBQ sauce too.We had some amazing rice dishes too...the Buddha Bowls and the Seoul Sensation.  The Buddha bowls are like Korean bibimbap with more ""American"" vegetables which, I thought, made it tastier and more easily palatable for the kids who LOVE veggies.  The sauce was a touch sweeter and tangier than regular gochuhang  which yielded a better result, in my opinion.  The Seoul Sensation seemed to be a Buddha bowl wrapped in a tortilla (reminiscent of the Southwest for me).  The service is great, and the guys that work there were friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.   Even though we looked and acted like tourists with our questions and hesitations, we never felt pressured (we had kids too).  They made a special effort to make sure the kids were made to feel welcome and happy (which is a huge plus for us as a family on vacay).  By the way, we traveled with a 5 year-old and a 14 month-old.Overall, I would give this place an A+ for phenomenal food and friendly service.    BTW, when I say service, I don't mean the kind you find at Charlie Trotters.  I just mean a friendly place where there is no pressure and the guys are make you feel welcome and relaxed for a superb meal."
"Pay attention, my friends:HOLY SHIT these are good wings.Not much more to say."
"I've very little relatively negative things to say about this place, it does a lot of things right.  As much as I'd much rather give it 4.5 stars, it deserves more of a 5 than a 4.I've had many different place's Korean style chicken, I was more inclined to compare this to Ssaboo in Niles, IL (which in my review noted that it is pretty terrible).  This blew a lot of my expectations away.What's great about this place is you get different parts of the chicken, not just the wings and legs but breast and thigh too.  My friend and I went and split the chicken deal with two sauces, Sassy Seoul and the BBQ (not the Bud's, that'll have to wait until the next visit!), I was far more impressed with the Sassy Seoul although my friend very much enjoyed the BBQ.  The fries are, well, pretty generic but I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary, the Myon Kimchi was great: not sour, not too fresh but still clean and tasty while not being too spicy.The chicken was great, pretty moist and plenty of meat on the bone.  The marinate was also very flavorful and certainly unique, I haven't had any Korean fried chicken that tasted like this.It's a very relaxed environment, friendly to pretty much anyone of any age and any race.  It's great to see traditional bowls be given a more modern or western twist to appeal to everyone, which is I think lacking in a lot more traditional Korean restaurants.  Pricing really isn't too bad either, I definitely say you'll get your money's worth.Parking certainly wasn't a problem at 4PM on a weekday.  The staff wasn't too interactive with guests (...except with women...seemingly...) but still had a great time.  They do have wi-fi but it's protected (and didn't have the password available, which was a little annoying but not necessary).Definitely some place worth checking out if you're in the area!"
"Crisp has kind of messed with my head a little bit. I mean, I really like fried chicken, like a lot. Like this was like the fifth or sixth fried chicken place I'd eaten at. That day. Like in one day. (Yes, like all within a few hours, and yes, my doctor says I'm just fucking fine so shut the hell up and leave me and gotdamned chicken the hell alone. I digress...) And the chicken here is delicious. We had some giant ass pterodactyl sized Seoul Sassy chicken wings here and they were great - maintained a crispy crunch under a sticky, but not too sweet or salty, but super flavorful saucy thing that tasted like ginger and garlic and soy sauce and was just fricking delicious. But even with all of that goodness, I can't stop thinking about their sesame oil scented sauteed vegetables. I mean, the chicken was good and all, maybe even pretty dang great, but those veggies are still haunting me, calling to me with a leafy siren song of lingering phytochemical loveliness. Go figure. (Stop #, jeez, I don't even know anymore...like Stop #5 or 6 or something... on the Great Fried Chicken Crawl of Chicago.) PS - The communal seating tables and benches are beautiful, but not the most conducive to the type of elbows-on-the-table fried stuff eating seating that this food deserves."
"Okayyy!! I'm mean! This place definitely deserves 4 stars. The staff is beyond super friendly and nice, and the food hits the spot. I might have been too harsh on the buddha bowl because of my bias-ness, but the vegas burrito was just great. I could have ate one more. So delicious."
"So my craving for wings was not satisfied by the canned beers and Chinese cut wings....enter Crisp.BYOB! Already a winner...so after grazing over the menu, I decided to order 10 Giant Korean BBQ wings and a baby Buddha bowl. (For two people...not just me, people. The bowl was to add some diversity and veggie delight to our meal.) Wow, the wings were huge...about the size of my hand....bigger!!!So...as large as my appetite is, the two little Asian girls couldn't finish the order of wings. I'd like to think I can handle spice but I'm sad to say there was a gigantic pile of tissues/napkins next to me by the time the meal was complete...*note to self...will not order a spicy meal when on a date.* My companion was just fine. The Baby Buddha was great and I'm excited to go back and try another bowl...as well as order half as many wings...that are plain with no spice.10 wings + Baby Buddha bowl = $22ish.Yum."
"SO GOOD! After driving by one day I decided later that week to stop in on a whim, and I am glad that I did! My partner in crime and I decided to split a whole chicken and get it done two different ways per suggestion of the man taking my order. We got the sassy and the BBQ. Personally I'm glad that we got both, but I ended up liking the BBQ more. We also got a couple sides and drinks along with the whole chicken done 2 ways- and it was $21 dollars and change. I think that was a pretty good deal. Cute restaurant, nice employees, and great food!"
"Whenever the husband and I get a deep fried chicken crave, we pick up the phone and call Crisp. Our usual includes: half of the Plain Jane (which is similar to plain fried chicken), half of the Seoul Sassy (has a kick!), and a Seoul Steak Bowl (which is white rice with bulgogi placed on top). The Steak Bowl comes with this delicious sauce that's tangy, a little sweet, not really sure what it is, but it is GOOD. I'm guessing hot chili pepper sauce with something else with it. We eat our Plain Janes using this sauce. Overall, this place it awesome!!"
Wow yummers 4 real! Bowl was fantastic & the chicken wings were phenomenal just the perfect kick of spice & really juicy! & guys that were working we're cute & super friendly!
"IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD AT CRISPIt's totally hyped up, relatively cheap, in trendy lakeview - a unique concept restaurant with pretty good food.  It also totally wasn't what I expected it to be.  I didn't expect the complete absence of any Korean workers or cooks.I didn't expect the 2 absolutely gratuitous large Flat screen TVs behind the cashier that flash pictures of the food and are absolutely not visible to anyone else in the restaurant.I didn't expect the long wood communal tables.I didn't expect them to be closed on mondays (Man I was craving it that day!!)  P.S. Why Crisp?I didn't expect their buffalo sauce to be bought from a hot dog stand while their other sauces are homemade I didn't expect the random magazines strewn about the placeI didn't expect their phone number to be 877-MY-FUNKE because, you know, that makes perfect sense...I like the paper towels, but they're freaking IMPOSSIBLE to tear off with one hand so I was desperately trying to figure out how to tear a piece off without leaving my BBQ-Buffalo-Buddha-Sassy-Mess on the remaining towelsYou know, just wierdness.  Is this why I'm not a northsider?  Is this stuff just normal here?Anyways, food again pretty good.  All these reviews say pretty much the same thing.Personal preference: The Seoul Sassy Wings I haven't had Greats Seas in a while but from what I remember these are pretty close in taste but drier and crispierAgain the buffalo is pretty good but I've had better elsewhere so if I had  to give any advice to Crisp it'd be:1) Stop being so weird.2) Make your own buffalo sauce3) Change your paper towel holders"
"As good as it gets for delicious chicken.  We live around the corner and eat from here at least once a week.  Always good, always consistent.  Go here now!"
Delicious veggie wrap and bowls!
"I love this place and it is my one wish that they would magically appear in my neighborhood in San Francisco.I was so tempted to have the wings, since I've heard such great things, but I was just too tempted by the Korean burrito.  That's exactly what I had and it was amazing.  The bulgogi was flavorful and tasty and the veggies were fresh and crisp. I loved the Atomic Sauce, which gave it quite a bit of kick.  I will definitely return on my next Chicago visit, and in the meantime, I will pine away for this place."
"I've had just about everything on the menu.  I used to live closer to it and would go about once per week.  The people that work there are real cool and the food is unreal.  The wings are great but I usually go with the Seoul Steak Bowl with some atomic sauce on the side.  For some reason the seoul steak bowl, beers, my couch, and football go extremely well together."
"I confess to coming back here a few times.  The Korean places further up on Lincoln and Lawrence and Bryn Mawr are just too far sometimes, while Lakeview is tolerable, especially now that I have a car again.It really isn't Korean food...as evidenced by the spinach leaves (what!?) in the bad boy Buddha.  (Edit) Raw spinach has no place in bibimbap.  But I've had the steak bowl more than once now and it's tasty.Definitely call ahead if you're doing takeout...the line gets long! Oh, and one other thing...if you ever eat in.  The music? Very inconsistent and almost odd! Must be the tastes of the staff...one night it was heavy bass metal, which would be cool if I was at Kuma's...and another, it was some whimsical...for lack of better term, I'll call it fairy music.  Cannot say that either added to my dining pleasure."
"Holy hangover cure! This place rocksI had the baby buddah bowl with brown rice and beef - simply amazing. It's BYOB and can get crowded. But, the food came fast. Can't wait to return!"
"This place has the tastiest fries...EVER! Seriously, better than Boardwalk Fries. Remember them? The Seoul Sensation beef burrito I had as the main dish was alright. Today was my first visit and the overall experience warrants another. The joint is clean and the staff service was acceptable.Recommended."
"This place is a revelation!  My friends told me that we were going to a place with great chicken wings, and I thought, ""Eh, how great can they be?""  After I had a bite, I was blown away.  First off, the wings are huge.  Ordering five wings is like ordering half a chicken.  The skin is perfectly crispy and the meat is tender and juicy.  I ordered the Seoul Sassy sauce for my wings, and it was sweet, a little spicy, and had green onions on top.  Perfection.I also ordered the original Buddha Bowl.  This is what they call their bebimbop.  It was also huge and should really be shared with another person.  Vegetables were nicely marinated, and I really like bebimbop, so I was digging it, though it definitely didn't outshine the wings. While you're there, you might want to try some of their Korean soft drinks.  My friend ordered a milk soda, which was pretty good.  I didn't see what other offerings they had, but now I'm curious.  I wish they had a Loop location because I'd go there for lunch every week...well, maybe I'm glad they don't have a Loop location."
Best fried chicken. Nothing else to add.
"Met up with friends at Crisp tonight. I've read about this place on Yahoo and also saw it featured in a show. We ordered the Seoul Sassy  and the Mild Buffalo wings. I'm not a fan of spicy wings so the Seoul Sassy was PERFECT for me. It was sooo good and the portion was BIG! Also ordered the Seoul Steak Bowl...loved it!I have to go back for the Baby Buddha Bowl.The place was very casual and small. Ideal for take out.If you do dine in, there will be a line of people waiting for you to leave."
"For $7, I got this big ass bowl of the Korean equivalent of chicken fried rice (I would have opted for one of the Korean dishes, but I already had a fried egg, and many of them came with that), and it was SOOO good.  That's really all I have to day ... it's a pretty great lunch place, quick service ... big portions.  They were blaring Radiohead though, which made talking to my buddy kinda tough, but I can live with that.I think I would actually go here for carry-out next time.  It got kinda crowded, and as ushe, the fact that there's no free refills on soft drinks bugs me.  But, it's another great restaurant on one of my favorite shopping streets in the city (Broadway, between Diversey and Belmont)."
"Love it, especially the Buda Bowls and the Seoul Sassy Chicken!  Wish they weren't closed on Mondays, I'd go every day of the week!"
"i went to crisp when it first opened and was super disappointed. the chicken did NOT have a nice crisp and the flavor was just allright. i figured i'd give it some time to work out the kinks (as with any new establishment), and then revisit it at another time.so tonight i FINALLY re-visited crisp with some friends, and was pleased with the improvement.  we shared the following ""funke chickens"": the plain jane, seoul sassy and crisp bbq.  my favorites were definitely the first two. both were nice and crispy.  the plain jane wasn't as flavorful as i would have liked but the chicken was very tender and moist beneath the crispy skin.  i wanted to serve it with a side of waffles. the seoul sassy has very asiany flavors.  the crisp bbq was a tad too spicy for me, but i'm a wimp with spicy, so that was my least favorite.we also shared a seoul steak bowl -- this was basically just a bowl of rice, bulgogi, and scallions. the only gripe i had with it was that it was a bit on the oily side, otherwise also tasty.good job, crisp. i'm pleased that you improved upon your wings."
"Wow what a place!! I went once with a few friends and got the seoal steak bowl. It was good. real good.However, that was not my 5 star experience. I went back after reading on yahoo that this place had the best fried chicken in the country. Was I skeptical? yes. Was I going to find out for meself? HELL YES! I was not disappointed. I got the wings in both their signature sauces: Seoal Sassy and spicy bbq. they were both good, but there was something about the sassy sauce that blew my mind. So flavorful and complex for a wing sauce, and on those oh so CRISPy wings. I will definitely be back and recommend you all do that same!"
How is something soooo simple sooooo good? I mean its chicken and rice. Or am I missing something? The chicken tastes like its been marinated for weeks and the brown rice absorbs enough of the sauce to make the chi-town chicken bowl exceptionally tasty. Other than it being a little on the spicy side once the sauce is added (even if you ask for the milder version) the food is fantastic. I've tried it a few times now trying to see if it was a fluke but nope chicken and rice is great everytime.
"I've been hearing about this place for a long time, and finally made it out tonight. It definitely lived up to the hype. The line was long, but the service was almost impossibly quick given the crowd. The food was almost uniformly impeccable; enormous chicken wings were fried to an impossibly perfect crisp without tasting remotely greasy. The sauces were perfect accompaniments; the seoul sassy was my personal favorite, although the barbecue was perfectly spicy and sweet without being remotely cloying (as is sadly the case with many Asian and barbecue sauces). The buddha bowl was also a hit; the beef was delicious, the vegetables were all perfectly cooked (I never eat corn, but I made an exception for this), and the rice perfectly soaked up all their juices. Mexican cokes were a really nice perk. The one knock on the food at Crisp was the fried mushroom side dish, which was only so-so. Still, the rest of the food was fantastic, and our entire order (which in these circumstances fed two ravenous 20something males, but would probably have fed 4 normal people) came out under $40. In summation: an excellent and unique dining option. I already find myself in these parts quite often, but will likely make additional pilgrimages for the express purpose of going to Crisp."
"Normally, I don't like sitting with people at community tables.  Call me crazy but some people just have bad energy and I'd rather not digest my food around that energy...lol.  With that said, it doesn't bother me so much at Crisp.  Not only are the people that work here friendly but the patrons are happy-go-lucky people that I don't mind sitting at the table with me.I usually order the Original Bad Boy Buddha bowl.  It is all of my favorite things in one bowl:  zucchini, carrots, spinach, mushrooms, corn, rice, etc.  You can add meat or tofu.  I usually get chicken.  When I am extra hungry (always), I get an order of the wings (BBQ...no, not that kind....Korean BBQ).  But because I refuse to have someone walk by and see me eating all of that food (oink), that's usually a ""to go"" order.Don't judge me....if you go, you'll see exactly what I mean!"
"Here's the deal. I would live, eat and breath this chicken if  I could. This place serves a phenomenal bird. Damn, and the BBQ sauce- I am not sure how they came up with that concoction. Excellent.  This place is finger lickin' good!You've just been yelped in."
"Just had the Seoul Sassy with a side of the kimchee. I don't want to drink anything because I want the flavors to stay in my mouth as long as possible.Tender chicken, savory seasonings, all around fantastic food."
"i love fried chicken. and sometimes i really love it with sauce.the bbq sauce is perfect. not too sweet. and with rice, its a good meal. portions are good too."
"My wife and I went here on a whim a couple of months ago after browsing Yelp for a restaurant we hadn't been to yet. Crisp is pretty good, though nothing truly special. My wife got a Buddha Bowl, and was satisfied enough. I got one of the Korean burritos, which was similar: good, not great, nothing really all that special. I have to confess that I don't get the big deal about the wings. They're decent and all, but really not all that much different than good buffalo wings you'd find at a decent sports bar.Anyway, Crisp is a fun place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again. Definitely a local place only."
"Okay, so I probably came here over 20 times.  IT IS SO EFFING GOOD IT WILL BE A MISTAKE TO NOT GO. That is all."
Where to begin to describe the 'magic' in the Seoul Sassy?  It's like heaven in your mouth.  Wow. . . I'm salivating just thinking about it.  If your not in a 'fried' mood.  The buddha bowl's with brown rice are a great healthy alternative.  mmmhhhhhhh.  Worth the trip and the wait!
"seven hundred plusi'm seven hundred twentyso many reviews!I totally forgot to review this place, and 719 other Yelpers beat me to it.  Yes, it is as awesome as everyone else has said.Carry on."
"While I always feel bad piling on reviews when there are already 600 others, I feel I must.  I love Korean food and flavors and this place delivers, both in flavor and physically.  The menu looks big but is pretty limited.  Fried chicken (whole, half, wings, strips) tossed in one of three sauces and bibimbap in several form (bowl, burrito, ect.)However, everything is good.  I highly recommend this place and I hope the theme of Korean inspired food continues to grow in Chicago."
"A fantastic afternoon lunch with friends.  The fried chicken was indeed ridiculously crispy, even though it was smothered in a spectacular sweet and spicy sauce.The decor is is very cool with large hand scraped tables and benches and the staff was attentive and very nice.I will return."
"I just moved from upstate NY, the home of the Buffalo wing. These are some of the best wings and sauces I've ever had. Especially the Asian sauce and the traditional hot sauce. The fries are OK, kind of like fresh MacDonalds' fries. One thing to keep in mind: Each ""Wing"" is actually 3 pieces (tip, wing and drumstick) so order like half as many wings as you usually would. In other words, 10 wings is like the normal 20 wings, divided up like you get everywhere else.Oh, the Bi-Bim-Bop is not that great. We got the Big Boy and the vegetables were not that good and the rice was the wrong kind of rice (cheap and puffy.)Still 5-stars because the wings are great.Seating is a big problem though - there are only 2-3 large tables in the whole place and you have to share with others in a cramped environment. This would be OK, but there are ALWAYS people just chillin' after they eat, and talking and hogging all the tables. I've had to wait a while each time I went just to sit down, which really sucks, and it's the fault of the establishment, in my opinion. They should just get a bunch of 4-top tables and fill the place much more efficiently and comfortably."
"Here's my problem with yelp.  I've lived in Chicago just over 2 years, and have known about Yelp the whole time, so I typically ventured only into the 4+ star places.  Now that I'm finally getting around to reviewing everything, my distribution will look like:5 *******4 **********3 *******2 ****1 **I HATE YOU ALL!Unless you're hot, then we have a chance of working out.P.S. Workers were cool and the Seoul Sassy chicken was great.  Still remember it!"
"Tastes like you are eating a Korean mothers food!Get the Chicken bowl.  Everyone raves about the wings, I found them okay.Overall great!"
"I'm so glad I was taken here.  The food is delicious.  The chicken is crisp, tender, and coated with wonderful sauces, and the bowls are well-balanced.   Long wood tables, counter service.  BYOB."
"The chicken here gives Harold's a run for its money. It's cooked perfectly and well seasoned. I recommend the Seoul Sassy sauce if you don't like your chicken spicy. It is flavorful and slightly sweet.I also tried the bi bim bap bowl and it was quite good. They offer brown rice as an option, which I really appreciate. The real star here is the chicken. If you go here and don't order chicken, you are a damn fool and you will probably walk out of here thinking ""Meh, I've had better"". So get the chicken! It's all about the chicken."
"After signing up for a 2yr membership to Bally's, I deserved an indulgent meal of fat, sugar and salt. I found it!For $6, I covered my hands and face with sticky Crisp BBQ sauce from 3 jumbo wings and fries. Thank god they cover the walls with mirrors so you can check your face and teeth for sauce blobs. Was the chicken delicious? Yes. Was it something to call home about? Yes. Did I actually call home? Yes.As much as my tongue loves fat, salt, and sweet, I would not make Crisp part of my diet. Crisp belongs in the McDonalds category of nutrition, only once a year for me. Also, the BBQ sauce reminded me of Sesame chicken which is too heavy for me."
Seoul Sassy.Enough said.Best Korean fried chicken I've EVER had. Better than Bonchon!
"The food is pretty good, if you are into fried food, and reasonably priced.  However, I find the interior to be very awkward.  At busy times, there is hardly space to wait for your food.  The communal tables sound like a cute idea, but I think they could seat more with smaller tables.  And I have gotten stuck across some messy strangers that kind of killed my appetite."
whole wings
"i'm a lover of Chicken Wings and decided after reading reviews of crisp that i'd finally give it a try.  I am SOOOO glad i did.  Had 5 jumbo Seoul Sassy wings and let me say.  These were the best wings that i've ever had!!  I've been dreaming about them ever since.  next time, i'll skip the fries and get 10 wings and also will try the Crisp BBQ sauce.  if they are as good as the Seoul Sassy, i'm hooked on this place!!"
"How do people even give a less than 4 ratings for this delightful restaurant?I first came to crisp on spring 2009, and haven't stopped coming by each month to enjoy the delicious seoul sassy, and BBQ Bowl (or they also have a Buddha bowl for vegetarians). They also have a good selection of foods (ranging from the usual wings, to a mix of spanish-korean appetizers) and drinks (Korean & Asian soft-drink, in particular).But the best part that I like about this place is the service itself. They have plenty of magazines to read and most of the people who work there is always welcoming and laid-back, which give you more incentives to come and hang out at this place."
"Went there for the first time today, and it was worth the trip. My friend and I were just having appetizers and beer at a nearby bar, and I mentioned that we had to try this place sometime. Since we were still a bit hungry, we stopped by and split a half order of Seoul Sassy just to try it.It was amazing. Crisp on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside, and a very flavorful sauce. This is a fantastic place - a treasure for sure. I can't wait to try the rest of their offerings"
This place is great!! the Wings are amazing
"OMG, why did I wait so long to go here. Cool atmosphere inside. I picked up an order, I got the chicken bowl. I am extremely picky about my chicken and get grossed out easily by some chicken.  Anyway, this was all white meat & seasoning was sooooo good! I took it to go & realized when I got home they gave me white rice (I ordered brown rice & was charged extra for it.) I called & they were very nice & apologetic & offered to credit me when I came in next time or come back & get the brown rice. I was satisfied with the customer service. I will be back!"
"Myself and other fellow Koreans agree this place is da bomb. They have taken a cuisine that is good and adapted it very well for Lincoln Park patrons and Korean food conisseurs alike without losing the key flavors. (Chinese and Thai restaurants please take note.) Bravo.This place is good for lunch, a casual dinner, or order pick-up for your Superbowl party."
"Recipe for a delicious time:1. Go to Crisp2. Order the 5 Wings, get 3 seoul sassy and 2 BBQ3. Make it a combo!4. Eat, Eat, Eat, Eat, wash it down with a grape soda.5. Go wash the sauce off your face and hands 6. NaptimeHonestly though, excellent fried chicken...as the name implies, it's crisp, but also delicious, tangy, juicy, and pretty much perfect. the fries are also good, it's aways fresh and not very expensive. i'm not a fan of the bowls or burritos, but who really cares - the wings are to die for."
"Another order gone awry. We (finally) had a successfully completed delivery after the last review (switched to the wings, which are phenomenal, by the way), but when we tried to get a Buddha bowl today we ended up with half a chicken and some other food that we definitely did not order?! I understand that orders get mixed up from time to time (although, this is the 3rd out of 4 that has been wrong), but when we called and they came back to correct the mistake, the food that they brought was (yet again) missing the protein (4 outta 5... sigh). The guy on the phone sounded really busy, so I feel bad. The order on the receipt was correct as well, so I know it wasn't his fault. The food is SO DAMN GOOD! This review makes me sad... but really? Get it together, please!"
"So one of my go to places to eat was Rice Box, at this very location, a few years ago, when I lived in East Lakeview.  See a Saturday night.  My husband and I, in typical form, can not decide what to do so we just walked to the Broadway and Wellington area. I knew about Crisp, I wanted to try it, he hadnt had bi bim bop, we after finding a 25 minute at New Tokyo, we decided to give it a try.I got the Baby Budda and he got the Big Boy Budda.  We could have easily split the Big Boy and had enough food.  On a whim, he also got fries (honeymoon diet be damned) and we sat down and dug in. They have huge wood block tables that are good for communal seating and making new friends.  We were there pretty late though, so it was relatively quiet.  The food was good, and yummy. I loved the spicy sauce and we used all four containers that we were given (and got some to take home as well) I loved the spinach and bean sprouts and of course, the yummy fried egg on top. I think that more veggies would have added to the dish but I didnt want to get the next size up, way too much food.  The portions are HUGE for what you are paying for.  It is really reasonable.  The staff was nice and the music playing was kind of funky and fun.  They were also showing the Bachelorette which made me decide that I need to watch that show.  To be honest, watching three people devour fried chicken was somewhat gross but according to them, it was delicious.  Also good: huge rolls of paper towels on each table and a sign near the garbage can that says ""can you recycle that?""  Anyone who prompts recycling is good in my book!! I would definitely back."
"If You find yourself in Lakeview then you have to try Crisp! Every single time I've been there which has been many my food is always hot fresh and tasty. The buddha bowls are to die for, packed with veggies and meat topped off with a fresh egg. The sauces are very Flavorful .  The bibimbap is fantastic your sure to be a fan !Be sure to grab a seat before you order they get sat up fast!"
"Try: Seoul Sassy wings, Big Boy Buddha with beef, fries.Don't: not come here. You'd be stupid not to try it at least once.Pros: good prices, great food, good atmosphere.Cons: tiny space, but whatever, i'll take it."
"There is nothing more fantastical in the entire city of Chicago than Crisp. Indulging in reasonably price super huge portions of scrumptious wings is something I do when I want to a little devious. The arrived at the table piping hot and the sauce was a bit sticky and messy. So, a hot mess of wings. Yes, I Rebecca love a hot mess of wings. If you like Korean or like to mix it up with some fusion with chicken being the base of what is offered at this restaurant, check it out."
"I am so happy I finally got to check this place out! Ever I've moved back to the states after living in Korea I've been in search for some ""perfectly fried chicken"" and I think I found it at crisp. My friend and I went and shared a bowl of bibimbap - or Original Bad Boy Buddha Bowl, as they call it, and the Seoul Sassy chicken. I have to admit, it was a little more dry than the traditional ""yang-yum"" or sauce that is used in greasy chicken joints in Seoul, but it still hit the spot for me!The prices are really great for what they give you and I think they offer some great variations on Korean food. I look forward to trying everything on the menu before the year is out!"
"I love the chicken here! Just go for the specialty chicken.  Make sure you bring cash though, they don't take credit cards.Cons: tables and seating isn't very desirable. Cash onlyPros: Chicken, Food, Price"
Good foodCommunal seating
Chicken awesome
Good chicken fun placeVery casualByob
"My friends and I love this place! It is relatively cheap (around 6 dollars for a baby buddha bowl which is korean style bibimbap- assortment of prepared veggies over rice with a fried egg and gochujang- spicy red pepper sauce.) I usually add beef (marinated korean style chopped up bulgogi flavored) which is $1 and exchange for a healthier brown rice ($1.50 additional). The portions are huge for the buddha bowls.I'm Korean and lived in LA for a few years, but this place is really good and fresh even though it's not traditional! I love bibimbap and all my non-Korean friends love this place too. The seoul sassy wings are excellent too. Very Crisp-y. They also have the delicious korean drinks that I grew up with like the green grape drink or the asian pear drink. I haven't met anyone who doesn't love bibimbap!  (It's a very Vegetarian friendly dish.) This place is good for groups since they are huge tables even though it is kinda small inside. Definitely a fun, fresh place to try :)"
"stopped by, and picked up some wings to go... had the soul sassy and the korean/spicy ones... the wings are HUGE.... and very tasty.. they are crispy, hence the name. Are these as good as my crack addiction like Great Seas?  not yet.. i need to sample them more.. they are different too.. they are the entire wing, and Great Seas is lollipop style, and hotter. This place is closer, so they got that going for them.... People working there were really friendly. Will go back and try different sauces and some bowls."
Simply the best. Great food at a great price. I have has almost everything on the menu and strongly recommend either the steak bowl or the sassy Seoul Boneless wings. The sauce on both are incredible. I wish I could put them on everything. Keep up the great work!
"Most.Amazing.Wings.Ever!We had the 5 piece wings (huge btw), with the seoul sassy sauce and they were juicy, crispy, and tasty! Which is all that you can ask a wing to be in my book.  I ordered the seoul steak bowl which was very disappointing, in fact i ate very little of it, but my dining partner loved his version of bi bim bop.  But the wings really stole the show tonight!  Can't wait to try the other sauces!Yes they are byob, but they will give you little plastic water cups (just a warning) and they are no longer cash only!  They took my card which means i can save that precious cash for another day!The other factor was the price, for 2 bowls, 2 waters, and 5 wings it totalled at over 30 dollars!  Not exactly light on the wallet, but still i would definitely come back for the wings time and time again!"
Best korean fried chicken in town. Get the seoul sassy sauce
"Um yum. Two words. Buddha Bowl. (the original)These things are delicious. Filled with delicious veggies (mushrooms, spinach, carrots, zucchini, sprouts, cucumbers), rice and topped with a fried egg and then I usually add chicken. Their sauces are great. It comes with a spicier sauce... but I usually also get the milder version and mix the two... its a satisfying and flavorful meal! Since i like the buddha bowl here so much Ive never tried anything else, but I am always tempted to. It all looks and smells so good. Im sure the other menu items would be disappointing...Ive eaten in but it also does well for delivery too!"
"This place is constantly crowded and it's well deserved.  While I've only had their GIGANTIC wings and Budda bowls, they are the best versions of both I've ever had.  The wings are super crispy and flavorful, not to mention huge.  Forget the little bar size chicken wings - these are their bigger, badder brother.  The Budda Bowls are super fresh.  I usually have to add some hot sauce, but the ingredients are delicious.  Great treat any time."
"They have the best Korean wings in Chicago.  The Buddha bowls are also the bomb.  It is hard to find parking for this restaurant, so your best bet is to catch public transportation.  Everything is cooked to order and they also have healthy foods, IE. brown rice and fresh vegetables.  The Big Boy Buddha bowl is big enough to share and the fried wings are huge.  Six wings and a small Buddha bowl is enough for a date of two.  They serve healthy drinks and well as regular sodas."
"A definite guilty pleasure. Like someone wrote earlier, it is Korean food for white people.The Seoul Sassy wings are embarrassing to order, but tasty as all get out. Crispy wings covered in scallions, soy, ginger, and garlic. I suggest getting the 10 piece and enjoying the leftovers the next day.This place is an easy take out joint and is well priced. A top choice."
Crisp is on point. The menu up and down is solid and I've tried nearly everything. Nothing compares to the Soeul Sassy Wings though. However they fry them gets them so crispy and they toss them in a sweet Asian sauce. Definitely a staple of Lakeview.
"We order from here almost once a week. The Bowls(bibimbap) are very good and healthy. The chicken is better than a lot of places wings, but in favor of healthy eating I haven't had it in a while.They haven't picked up their phone for the last couple of days.  Closed for the Holidays?"
The Seoul Sassy chicken wings are sweet and salty goodness. The Buddha Bowl (aka- bibbimpap) has all the veggies that i love and none that i hate. Picked it up and ate it at the Lincoln Park Zoo. Way better than zoo food. Make sure you don't spill any of the oil from the chicken on your clothes... not the easiest stain to get out.
"If they delivered or had another restaurant in Rogers Park it would get more stars, but with small space to eat and having to drive to the area, it gets 3.The Burrito's are awesome, even warmed up if your friend can't finish them, the fries are also awesome.  The buffallo wings are your usual fan fare.  If I'm ever in the area and looking for chicken wings this would be the place to be, otherwise you can probably find something closer to you."
"5 stars, and I'm pretty sure I gained 5 pounds eating there. I split the whole chicken deal with a buddy, and it was fantastic. Nothing like a huge tray of fried everything to start a night of drinking. I'm glad I don't live in Chicago anymore because places like this would cause me to buy new pants on a regular basis (and no, not from crapping them)"
"Wow, they know how to marinate fried chicken here, and I love that it's still crispy!  How do they do it and not get it to become soggy?!  I usually get the Seoul Sassy.  It's my favorite but I get the Crisp BBQ as well.  I want to try other items on the menu, but I'm kind of addicted to the chicken and know that there's no way I could eat all that food.  The place isn't huge, but there is seating there.  It's kind of communal.  The prices are pretty average but more than your typical fried chicken chain restaurant/fast food spot.  There are daily specials as well."
"Easily the largest wings I've ever seen, and they are damn good too. My favorite were the Crisp BBQ. Second were the buffalo, and third were the Seoul Sassy. The fries were very good too, I'd just get the small next time as the large are almost too large. I could do without the communal tables, but the seating area isn't big enough to accommodate ""private"" tables so it makes sense..."
"The seoul sassy was so good! The bi bim bop's sauce was sooo hot, but i like it"
"If you're looking for pretty good wings this is your place. You don't get your typical wing sauces, and if I had to recommend one go with the Seoul Sassy. But be careful because the wings are split here. So if you order 5 you actually get 10 and ordering 10 gets you 20 wings.Also the buddha bowl was ok. The egg was kinda small and the veggies seemed a little soggy in the rice. Not the best Korean, but I came here for the wings not the bowl.Wait was actually pretty quick for 7pm dinnertime- took about 10 minutes and a communal table was available by the time our food order was ready, and no line surprisingly. But don't expect that every night. Highly recommend for a different change in wing."
Great food! Fast Korean munchies or sit down take your time.Great menu selection. I hope to see more locations soon.
"Crisp = awesome. Their fries are amazing. The chicken is insanely good - I prefer the wings to the half chickens - as they are enormous and meaty. My friends and I refer to them as pterodactyl wings. The Buddha bowls are great and can make you feel like you're eating something kind of good for you without sacrificing the fried chicken glory that is Crisp. I love the Seoul Sassy sauce and the Spicy is kick ass without being too hot. The Seoul Steak Bowl is another delicious treat - make sure you get it with the Atomic Sauce on the side for an extra kick of spice and smooth texture to compliment the beef. I've ordered from this place for both delivery and pickup and have had some issues with missing or incorrect items so be on the lookout! I still say the best way to enjoy Crisp is to actually eat in with a few tall boys, douse yourself in grease, and call it a day. Keep it classy, ya'll."
"You know I like my chicken fried, and after eating here, your pair of jeans will definitely not fit just right. The chicken WANGZ is where its at. Its a full wing, and they are jumbo. You definitely want to load up on the SEOUL SASSY flavor. Just an explosion of ginger, garlic, and salt in my mouth. The BBQ was very sweet and tangy, but most of us preferred our wings SASSY. In one of our orders, they threw in 12 wings instead of 10. Yeahhhh buddy. The Seoul Steak bowl was decent with a lot of rice, but the meat lacked a little flavor. But it did compliment the wings perfectly. Sometimes you need that bit of rice to reset your palate. Be ready to take a long nap after this meal."
The service is Excellent!  I had a minor mishap (they forgot to give me my food) but they were more than willing to make up for it. My food was delicious!  My only complaint is that the bibim bop was not served in a hot pot!
"It was with trepidation that I tried this ""fusion"" Korean place being that I've never eaten at a non-authentic Korean eatery.  But all my trepiditiousness was deflated once I tried the delicious food.  Who knew Korean and Mexican food blended so well together?  The Korean burrito with beef bulgogi was delectable, huge and came with an amazingly spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce.  The wings with korean bbq sauce were addictive and wonderfully spicy.I think we are going to start seeing a trend of Korean-Mexican fusion food.  There's a super popular Korean taco truck in Portland, OR now too, it's taking over!On a side note, we met the owner and he was very nice and hooked us up with samples of other things on the menu that we didn't buy for free!"
"Was going to give this 4 stars, for the chicken wings were really good. Fall off the bone tender, great crispness and flavor. But.. But... The last thing you'd want when the chicken cools slightly is for it to be sitting in a pool of oil. Yes, I know, it's fried food. And yes, it will have oil. But not a pool of it at the bottom. If you're that kinda food lover, then you'll love that the wings sit in oil. I couldn't help wondering why they wouldn't put it on some tissue paper to soak the oil up before saucing it...  Other than that, great bbq burger, fries and kimchi. Brought the remaining kimchi with me home... super fresh and nice."
"I know some people reserve 5 stars for fancy restaurants, but I must say this place is awesome for a finger licking Friday night.  Some might argue about the most delicious sauce...I am true to the Seoul Sassy, but my boyfriend is obsessed with the BBQ....either way - it will become an addiction.  Try it for a concert in the park or Ravinia - they have a whole chicken meal for like $20.  It's delicious - you will not be disappointed.  At worst you will regret reading this review because it will lead to a new addiction.  We knew it was bad when we had worked out for 2 hours one night and still ended up with a whole fried chicken..."
"The wings here are amazing! They are quite large though so be prepared to take some home. The decor is very clean/modern with some window seating and communal benches... love how they have their ""special sauce"" on all the tables. Staff very friendly and our food came quick. Great inexpensive food. If you like wings you must come here!"
"Was first introduced to Bonchon in when I visited New York last year and absolutely fell in love with the Korean fried chicken/chicken wings. Crisp is definitely a solid alternative that is available in Chicago, even though I know it's unfair to directly compare the two restaurants. This place is also quickly becoming one of the favorite places for my friends and I to meet up during the weekdays to recap our questionable antics from the previous weekends. I personally enjoy the original flavor more as the crip bbq or the seoul sassy are both a bit on the sweet side for me. Tried the 10 piece wings for the first time during my last visit and the portion was definitely much bigger than I expected. I do have to give a special shout-out to the manager for giving me the wings anyway despite the fact that I was 2 dollars short in cash (only had a $10 in my wallet at the time). Undoubtedly earned an extra star in my book!"
"My first time to Crisp I ordered a regular buddha bowl and 10 chicken wings (Crisp BBQ and Seoul Sassy)  to split with the BF.  We had planned on bringing home leftovers but my goodness was it a lot of food and delicious! The Seoul Sassy wings were sooooo good! The BBQ wasn't that special but if you like BBQ, you'll like the flavor.  And we had to force ourselves to finish the regular  buddha bowl (prob wasn't the best idea)..  Went the 2nd time with the BF and this time we opted for just 5 wings (seoul sassy) and the mini buddha bowl.  And note that they let you customize the bowl if you do not like the veggies provided.  Again it didn't disappoint! Went the 3rd time recently with the BF and of course got the sassy wings and this time switched to the steak bowl (requested an egg on top).  They didn't have jasmine rice ready so I got brown rice, for no extra charge.  This was my first time with the steak bowl so i'm not sure if this is always the case but there was A LOT of sauce over everything.  It was a little too much (and maybe the brown rice texture had to do with it as well).  The seasoning on the wings were also a bit too strong so maybe it was just an off day overall.  It won't keep me from returning though. I love the concept of this place.  It's a great place to grab a quick bite with friends.  Pricing for the food is good and the workers/owner is very friendly!"
"Service was great, but the seoul sassy sauce was overrated."
"Just went there for lunch. WTF...where do they get these wings from??? These wings are on steroids (in a very good way). The guy at the counter was more than helpful. He suggested the 5 wings with two different sauces. The only negative thing about this place is the price, it's around $2 per wing. For that price it should be awesome. I will definitely go back and try the other stuff."
"I decided to try Crisp out last night, I was boycotting the place because it use to be the Rice Bowl and I loved the Rice Bowl. Sadness. Wow, it was definitely packed, however I feel the extremely warm weather yesterday got people out of there homes. The service is warm, friendly and quick. The meals are priced extremely reasonably, especially for the large portion you get. If I wasn't going somewhere afterwards I would have had leftovers to take with me. Food: I ordered the BBQ chicken and it was fabulous, spicy and sweet at the same time, great combination. The chicken pieces were large and mostly meat, barely any bones. I really did appreciate that. I reviewed the menu and it looks like they have a lot of other popular Koren dishes. Definitely recommend everyone to stop by for some Koren BBQ."
"Awesome food! Wings are huge and delish.  My favorite is the Seoul Sassy, but the Korean BBQ is also awesome!  I've been here at least 20 times and I always leave with a smile.  The only negative thing I can say is that parking sucks around this place and the lines are long because it is so popular!  The owners of Crisp need to expand and open another location! 10 jumbo sized wings runs about $18 and feeds 2-3 people easily"
"This place is a great buy for those folks looking to feast on giant turkey-esque wings and a can a pop. You shall not pass --- this place up!The bowls are kind of standard; rice with pretty toppings and some spectacular sauces. Once mixed in, the powers combine like Voltron in your mouth and kick your ass. Pretty nice for $9 bucks, or so.Now the stars of this parade of bad-ass are the monstro-wings in the signature sauces and bits of sautéed green onion end bits. OMFG, from tip to joint, the best wings I've had here in the City. Beats Duff's like it was its prison bitch. Read my review on that disappointment, ok? Anyway, huge mutant chicken in my basket, in my mouth, with a side of crispy fries and the vanilla cream soda in less than 10 minutes? I just came a little thinking about it again. There was also this cute brunette with a nice butt sitting at the next table. I should totally Craigslist her on Missed Connections; ""Hey, I came at the dinner table. Call me!!!"" Overall, the service was great and convenient. The seating area could be more ample. But hey, it's winter and coats take up space, dammit. Sure I'll give them that. Take friends and convert them to the saucinator monstro wings that Crisp offers up for about the same price as the other overpriced 'gourmet' crap offered up and down the same street."
"Wow! As soon as I got in my car and smelled my food, I knew I was in for a tasty treat. I JUST finished eating half a Baby Buddha Bowl with Beef (their version of bi bim bop). It was so good. Actually, it was GREAT and hit the spot perfectly. If I had two stomachs, I would finish the rest cuz that 'baby' was big (for me). The vegetables and egg were cooked perfectly and the beef had a nice mild, smoky flavor. My rice was on the side since I got it to-go. Is it authentic Korean? I don't know, and frankly, I really don't care. It was damn delicious! I also ordered 5 Seoul Sassy Wings not knowing I was going to get a sweet surprise. These wings are HUGE!  They are not your typical bar wings that are puny and laden in grease. The drumstick and wing together count as 1 wing. They have an interesting and totally different taste that is not common amongst your KFC or BW3-type joints. Score! I was only able to eat one even though I tried in vain to have another. But I couldn't. I'm so full!Honestly, if you're having a get-together at your house get your wings from here and invite me please! =) Your friends will not only thank you, but they'll be thoroughly impressed. They're amazingly good. The staff was very friendly and my food came out quickly. I'll definitely be coming back to try the other sauces. Thanks for the great suggestion yelpers!"
"I hate that NYC is always so far ahead of the curve (they know it and they love it), but Korean style fried chicken has been the rage there for quite some time.  I finally had to try it a few weeks ago and see what the hype was about.  It wasn't a single factor, but the moistness of the chicken, the tastiness/crunch of the skin (it wasn't fatty) all made for the best chicken wings I've ever had.  I'm sitting here hungover and that's all that I can think of right now.  Both the Seoul sassy and the Spicy BBQ were both good, a little salty on the sassy and pretty hot BBQ ones which was a nice change (normal spicy wings never really seem spicier, only saltier/more sauce).  When Asians say spicy, they usually aren't playing around, this time was no exception.  I also tried the burrito, it was ok, didn't love it.  My other gripe was I asked the cashier what he recommended on the menu and he said the fries!  I'm still mind blown by this, the fries were mediocre at best.  Either way, its a moot point.  I won't be ordering either the burrito or fries again, not because they were bad, but because they will merely cut into the maximum number of wings I can consume.  For all the penny pinchers complaining about their ""high prices"" for just a few wings, do your research (and realize you pay for what you get most of the time, head to BW3 if you want cheap generic wings).  It's a WHOLE wing, so basically two regular pieces you would get anywhere else and they are 50% bigger.  Three or four wings would probably make a decent meal for a regular person, but next time I go I'll take a dozen.....of each flavor."
"Words cannot describe how much I love this place. This is like AVEC @ 10% of the price. Long tables, trendy ambiance. Its like a boho hipster asian infusion. Or as my friend calls it - ""Korean Food for white people"" The food is amazing. AND CHEAP! 2 people = chicken + bi bim bop with bulgogi beef for $24 (we got a lot of extras). Thats almost cheaper than Korea itself. (big almost)The Bi bim bop (or as the Saxons call it- The Buddha Bowl- ::rolls eyes::) was delish.  Fresh ingredients, really good beef. AND I DONT EVEN LIKE VEGETABLES....+ Baladoche and Le creperie are down the street for dessert.Completely worth the freezing cold and horrible parking. Did I mention its BYOB?The only thing I don't like is that they use ""The bird is the word"" as their slogan. How Family guy."
great fried chicken! up there with the best and can hold its own against NYC Ktown e.g. Bon Chon. Great hangover cure. Large rice bowl items are very very filling so be careful!
"I have been looking for a cheap Korean restaurant with good rice bowls for the past three years and finally found it! I went here last Friday with a group of friends after reading reviews on Yelp.  AWESOME CHOICE.  The place was a bit small (we had eight people) so we had to wait about ten minutes to get a table we could all sit at  but there was plenty of seating at the counters along the wall and by the window.  Overall not too long of a wait especially on a Saturday night.  There's no waiter service so you have to go up to the counter to order and pay.  When your food is ready, they call your name and you go up and get it.  However they do clean up the table for you after you're done so you don't have to worry about where to bring your stuff after.I got a Baby Buddha Bowl with beef (comes with four veggies and a fried egg), my bf got an Original Buddha Bowl with beef (comes with eight different veggies and a fried egg) and we split a five piece order of wings (Seoul Sassy and Korean BBQ).  Our order came out to about $25 ($7 for baby buddha, $9 for original buddha and $7 for 5 piece wing order)which is relatively cheap compared to other korean restaurants and we had a ton of leftovers!  I didn't particulary care for the Korean BBQ wings but the Seoul Sassy wings were the best wings I have ever tasted in my life!  Great Seas on Lawrence and Kedzie used to be my go-to-place for korean wings but I think the wings at Crisp far surpass it!  Theyre oh so deliciously crisp and flavorful!  And there was nothing ""baby"" about the Baby Buddha Bowl...I was starving when I got there but I didn't even come close to finishing it.I wish this place was close enough for delivery.....but its good enough for me to make the 15 minute drive from andersonville at least once or twice a week.  Overall good choice for cheap korean food thats GOOD :)"
Yum. I have been to this place at least 15 times and it is always amazingly delicious. The only downside is that the portions are large and its not the type of food you want to take home for leftovers.
"3.5 actually.....but I am feeling generous today.I went here for take out with a friend that said it was amazing.  I got the original bad boy buddha with brown rice...it took like 15 minutes for them to whip up our order.  I was interested to see what it was going to be like.  I had never had this type of combo....well I really like spicy stuff so thankfully they had added lots of kick and put some extra in the bag because I told them I liked really spicy...people always are like, do you really like spice?  And I am like....yes, I like spice...GIVE ME THE SPICY!  Anyway, I took my first bite and its pretty good!  Fried egg and all.  I liked the brown rice because it was hearty.  I dont know if I would have liked it as much with regular rice.  I liked how all of the stuff in the bowl was in its own pile so you could mix it up or just eat this and then that.  I mixed mine...it was good.  Not to mention super cheap...less than $10 for a huge bowl thing."
"I've read the reviews. I'm sitting here looking at the menu, which looks good. The menu also says they deliver, and I really wanted to try the place out.Well I've called Crisp during its posted business hours (730 on Sunday), and Crisp hasn't picked up the phone. I'm pretty disappointed."
Definitely not the best chicken wings in chicago.. leave that achievement to Great Seas. The bulgogi burrito was good but nothing special. I could have made that at home.
"Let's get the obvious out of the way: the wings are great!Okay now the other stuff. Crisp is conveniently located in the middle of Broadway in Lakeview which makes it a great place to just stop in when you have a wing craving. The restaurant is a bit on the tiny side, so unless you go at an off hour or have the luck of the Irish I recommend going with take-out.  I'm a bit of a spice hound so take this with a grain of salt, the wing sauces run a little on the mild side so I would advise jumping one level up the spice scale than you usually would. All that said the place fries a damn good chicken and offers the bowls for those looking for something a little less messy and more ""balanced"" (read lots of veggies)."
"Really good Korean fried chicken- wings & chicken tenders   All the sauces are pretty tasty.  Fast, different, and scrumptious.  Other options too if you don't just want chicken."
"It's an awesome place and the price is right. I would consider it healthy food if the portion were not that huge.I had some chicken wings which were perfectly marinated and cooked; and the BAD BOY BUDDHA BOWL (perfect mix of rice, veggies and meat). I'm definitely going back, it's the perfect place in this time of recession!"
"I recently tried Crisp for lunch. I had the Foodie's Choice Crisp, and my friend had a Buddha Bowl. Mine was delicious. The chicken was tasty, crisp, and tender on the inside. The sauce and toppings were also excellent. My only complaints were that the sandwich fell apart easily and it was just a bit too greasy. My friend enjoyed her Buddha Bowl, even though it was enormous. Seating is very informal but comfortable. I will definitely go back for more."
"I love fried chicken.  Wait - I love anything fried.  Especially deep fried.  I was so excited to try this place and I was not disappointed.  The fried chicken is so tasty.  The meat is juicy and tender, and the breaded skin is fried to a perfect crisp.  I came here with my dad and my boyfriend and we shared half of a fried chicken and a Big Buddha Bowl.  It was delicious.  The ambience is cool and very laid back.  I really liked the long wooden tables and benches; I have no qualms eating next to strangers.  I can't wait to come here again, and I'm bringing all my friends!  :)"
"No one will ever convince me to get anything but the wings. Sometimes I wake up with a hankering for Crisp's chicken wings. I'm a pretty small person, but even still, the wings are very generously sized. An order of 5 wings will usually feed me for 2 meals.  I'm not a huge fan of the bowls, but my fiance swears by the steak bowl, which is fine because that means more chicken for me. Also, you can't beat the price. Dinner for 2 costs about $25. It's also BYOB so feel free to stop by the Binny's beforehand."
"After reading up on this place, I decided to check it out and have some delivered.  I'm glad I did.  Cuz, I love me some waangs.  The Chicken wings are huge and delicious!  I was a little hesitant at first about paying $9 for 5 wings.  But once i got to the end of the second, and a bite or two into the third, i can honestly say i was already satisfied.  Then my Man Vs. Food instincts kicked in and lets just say..add another victory for Man.  I can only comment on the Chicken wings, (I've tried the plain Jane, Crisp BBQ, Crisp BBQ spicy, and the Seoul Sasssy)  You will not be disappointed by either choice.  One more thing, give there magic mushrooms a try. It will take you to places, you never dreamed of..(or was that another bag of mushrooms) hmm.regardless give them a try!   Overall , well worth it! =)"
"If you haven't had Korean Fried Chicken, you are missing out, and Crisp is the best place to go in LP/Lakeview. The Seoul Sassy sauce is my favorite. The Buddha Bowls also always hit the spot when I'm craving korean food.This place is pretty small and usually packed so it can be difficult to get a seat but its worth the wait."
"This place is somewhat of an interesting establishment. I've lived only a few blocks from here on Pine Grove and Diversey some years back. Before it was called ""Crisp"", it was just a place with Korean food and sushi. Not to say of course that it was bad at all, because it wasn't.Prior to it's makeover, you could tell the establishment was fairly new and they were just getting used to their feet wet.Their menu had your general variety of Korean foods, pure and traditional in every sort of way. It was always funny to see the ol' man telling the Mexican cooks how to make the bulgogi with utter scrutiny. Can't blame him - he wants his customers to experience the real deal.I practically went here at least 3 times a week.I moved up further north and moaned the loss of such a reliable, tasty, and friendly establishment. I come back around the area shopping, happen to pass by and notice it's closed down, with all the windows covered up. They're renovating. ""Awesome"", I say to myself.They finally opened up, with a brand new menu selection and revamped decor.Oh how I was disappointed. One can never really figure out the circumstances behind any change a business makes. I can take a slight guess however.Diversey and Clark is drowning with your average variety of downtown workers who are in their 20's and 30's, living the life. ""Yuppies"" so to speak? Very american, very metro. It's definitely a customer base that has high expectations. So the new change? I get it. It is a business after all.Despite however you might interpret this review, I really like this place. They still serve some of the same meals they did prior to the make over. But then there's some of the new items that are off the wall and rather degrading. Yes, I refer to their menu section, "" You so crazy? Korean Burritos"". My grandmother would have a heart attack if she saw crap like this and knew even a lick of american euphemisms that stereotype Asians. Of course I don't take it seriously, it's all fun and all. I get it.But I personally don't think they had to go so far as to lose their dignity with silly concoctions i.e. Dakota Seoul Steak (Philly Cheese? Are you serious?? Philly Cheese and asian food stopped being friends when some idiot decided to invent the Philly Cheese Roll)?Ultimately, it's a tough call personally. What I did order, which was the Buddha which natives know as the Bi-Bim Bop, was very good. And the same folks before the renovation were still there, just as nice and hospitable as before.Go hit the place up. If you're looking for a fun time with an interesting introduction to korean cuisine, dashed with some awkward pairings of american recipes - it'll make your stomach fit right in.But if you're looking for real Korean food, think a little elsewhere. Asking or a ""Baby Buddha"" or a ""Dakota Steak Seoul"" in korea will only give you weird looks."
"Wonderful and unique place.  It is fast food in that there are no waiters but the quality is way above fast food.The food is a combination of Korean with some American flavor.The Korean steak sandwich was amazing.I also love the bowls they have which are basically an Asian salad (with no lettuce)The spicy chicken wings are very spicy (and I'm pretty immune when it comes to tasting spiciness, but those are very spicy)"
"Chicken wings are one item many restaurants carry.It's actually really hard to find a REAL GOOD chicken wing.Crisp nails it. The skin is crispy but light. The meat is really tender.The sauces here are perfection. I usually go for BBQ or buffalo.and oh, try the bon bon drink. it's awesome.This is my routine whenever I come to Crisp:1. Come here with a group of people. 2. Order a whole chicken, buddha bowl, and maybe some side dishes. 3. Share it family style."
"I always get the Wacky Wacky Wings with Seoul Sassy sauce. Try saying that five times fast...The Seoul Sassy sauce is to die for, smother anything in that sauce and it will be delicious!!! Next time I think I better go for the boneless strips so as to eliminate any wasted chicken or Seoul Sassy sauce!! This is not authentic Korean so don't expect that, just expect delicious fried chicken, as if fried chicken could ever be anything BUT delicious!!"
"Ok, I actually think the food at Crisp is great.  I have been there probably 20 times, BUT I am getting ticked-off that their CC machine always seems ""down"".  For a while they didn't even have one.  Get your operation together."
"I love this place!  The chi-town chicken rice bowl is great!  And if you like wings--watch out--best deal in town!  They are HUGE.  For about 14 dollars, you can get 10 wings (and they usually throw a few extra in the basket) and you will prob be full after 3.  Their not just the wing--but the leg, the wing, and other parts.Downside--their closed on mondays."
Avoid if you're vegetarian. Bland boring meals.
"hands down - 5 stars for the soeul sassy flavored wings! I'm a wing fan and could almost base my friendships on a mutual love of wings. I mean it when i say these are the biggest and best wings I've had in the city. The smell makes you crazy before you even get to the sweet, spicy taste. As for the rest of the menu I've tried the Baby Buddhu, the Big Buddha bowl and the steak bowl. While these items alone maybe warrant 3 or 4 stars, they are just decent in my opinion. Probably much healther as the buddha bowls are loaded with veggies and have an interesting flavor.  I'd skip these though in favor of leaving more room for the wings. The service has been nice, and for first time deliveries they discount 10%."
"Oh so yummy, fast and a great price!  A trifecta!The Baby Buddha Bowl with Chicken is my fave.  It's pretty close to a traditional bibimbap.  At seven bucks you can't go wrong and it's plenty of food.  The perfect lunch when out running errands on a sunny Sunday.Community seating and some single seats at bars that line the front window and the side wall.  Can't wait to come back and try the fried chicky!"
"I finally went to Crisp after telling my friend about it over a month ago (she's been in 4 times to my 1 time). I had the Seoul Sassy wings which were great! They weren't too sweet and had just the right amount of crispiness to them. I tried one of the BBQ wings that my friend got, and they were ok, but not for me. I prefer the sweetness of the Sassy wings. The prices were affordable (the owner told us to buy 10 wings all together for $11.95, which saved each of us $1 each) and the wings were large, but you could definitely finish all five, shoot I know I did.Definitely a great end to a day. (or middle)"
Sometimes I lay awake and just dream of Crisp Chicken. I absolutely love this place.
"I agree 100% with Brittany P. This place is amazing. I took my grandmother here. She usually hates all non-italian restaurants, but loved the chicken. Thank you Crisp for giving me one pleasant restaurant-dining experience with my grandmother where she didn't try to speak Italian to all the bus boys."
"Fantastic. If you want flavored fried chicken in the Korean style, this is the place to go. We had sassy and buffalo and it just knocked out socks off. I would guess the rest of the menu is just as good.I can't rave enough about this place."
"Wow, just wow. I was a little skeptical of Korean 'fusion' but I'm really glad we checked this place out! We actually came back the next night for more food lol. The place is on the smaller end, but very accomodating. I just had to try the Seoul Steak Bowl (bulgogi on rice) and it was really good. I had a bite to eat of the Seoul Sensation Burrito and I wasn't too big of a fan. The kimchi was kimchi. The next night, I was drooling over the wings I saw the previous night so I ordered the 10 piece Wacky Wacky Wings. These are HUGE. In retrospect the 5 piece would have sufficed just fine, but the 10 piece gave me something to eat the next day. I also want to add: you can do half and half flavors!All in all, this place is definitely worth going to. The main cashier guy was friendly as well. He forgot to give us our drink the first night, so the second night we went, he gave us two free."
"For the longest time I thought this place had only chicken.  Actually they have quite a few vegetable bowls, albeit marinated in sesame oil, and a couple salads. They offer an option of brown rice for $1.50 extra and tofu, chicken, or steak for 1.00 extra. So its not just fried chicken here, you can actually get a pretty balanced meal.I ordered the Bad Boy Buddha bowl and asked for it without oil. I thought this meant they would steam the vegetables, but apparently not. All (or most) vegetables are marinated in the morning and he can't make any exceptions/special orders (I'm sure he would but I would have to call very far in advance and pay a hefty service charge). I get my vegetables and there is oil on them and I ask him about it, he said he thought I meant the extra squirt they put on top before serving. No. So we had the conversation resuting in the info presented at the beginning of this paragraph.Still I ate it and it was good. What's an additional estimated 20-25 grams of fat with my veggies, anyway? And its sesame oil, not like, lard. The sauce that comes with the Buddha bowls is good, also, and they will sell it to you a la carte if you want. The decor is bright with beautiful long tables that encourage communal eating. I didn't notice if there is a bathroom or not...probably...I would assume."
"I came across this place on yelp and I thought why not give it a go? As not a big fan of fried chicken, but the fact there was some Korean fusion, is what made me try it.  I do not regret my decision going, but it does get crowded quick, but the service is pretty fast.  I tried the Seoul Sassy, which everyone kept saying was the best, but I was greatly disappointed  when I tried the chicken, and it completely flavorless. I looked and saw they barley put any sauce on my chicken.  When the line died down, I asked for some extra sauce, they hesitated at first, but then they poured some extra sauce.  Even the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, I preferred the Crisp chicken, which was spicy and flavorful.  The Seoul Steak bowl was good, but it can be easily manipulated at home."
"Finally a Korean fusion restaurant gets it right. Very unassuming place that feels like a college lunch spot but tastes like something that was fired up by my mama's kitchen. Great originality in the Seoul Sassy and the Korean BBQ flavors. I can taste the ethnicity while enjoying the American comfort of the fried chicken. Even the burrito reminds me of the type of fusion I incorporate in my own cooking with the combination of korean bbq, tortilla with rice and fresh veges that give it that ""crisp"" taste. Crisp is what fusion food is supposed to be. A complement of flavors and styles that are delivered to your mouth in a non traditional way. However, things that Crisp misses are the white radishes that oft accompanies Korean friend chicken (tong dahk). I had to drop it a notch because of that oversight."
"The first time I ordered for delivery was 2 years ago, maybe longer.  They forgot both drinks and it took over an hour and a half to get.  I called several times to check in on my order.  They said it was a problem with the delivery service they were using.  I just got delivery tonight.  They left out the chicken I ordered in my bowl.  Seriously?  I've ordered 2 times and both times they messed up.  The half of the order that they got right was good, but I would advise all to not take a chance with delivery from here.  I have learned my lesson."
"Great wings. They are huge, meaning they come from an adult chicken with full grown wings, so 2-3 will make a meal. Tangy, crispy and chickeny. Good stuff.Also, I thought the people working there were very friendly and honest about the menu. He asked if we have been here before and explained how it worked and what he recommended getting without being overly aggressive or in your face. Thanks for that!Will be back."
"Well, had high hopes for the wings at this place based on online reviews but was a bit  disappointed. The wings have good flavor but not crisp and not a lot meat. The wings look big because they are not jointed and include the wing tips. News flash... tips have no meat, just cartilage. Next time, we'll try the tenders. We got delivery and the delivery guy was on a bike so that may have impacted the crispness but again, there was just not a lot of meat on these wings."
"Korean fried chicken (KFC) is a favorite topic of mine. But KFC was the last thing on my mind when I started planning this trip until I started reading about Crisp on various food blogs and Web sites. So on our second day in Chicago, having tackled White Castle and Greek food the night before, I skipped out on the city's pizza, hot dogs, and Italian beef sandwiches and headed to Lakeview for some KFC.The essence of Korean fried chicken lies in its sauces and Crisp has three different offerings (Crisp BBQ, Seoul Sassy, and Bud's Buffalo). We ordered two whole chickens and went for the Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy.The Crisp BBQ is a Korean sauce that's got a mild heat, which was nice because other spicy KFC sauces I've had have totally blown out my taste buds. If you're like us and like trying different flavors of KFC, then you'll appreciate that even more. The heat does linger on your tongue, and I love that.As much as we liked the Crisp BBQ sauce, the Seoul Sassy was our favorite. The ginger, garlic, and soy-based sauce was excellent, one of my favorite KFC sauces ever. This basket of chicken disappeared faster than that Crisp BBQ.Sauces aside, the most important thing about this fried chicken is that it lives up to its name. The chicken skin is crispy, despite being drowned in sauce, and it's juicy too. I'm pretty confident that most fried chicken fans could order the sauceless Plain Jane chicken and be very happy.We got a chance to talk to Jae Lee, one of Crisp's owners, and he was really cool. I told him that we don't have Korean Fried Chicken like this in the SF Bay Area and that this rivaled the KFC we had in New York. Jae told us that he went to New York as part of his research and sampled pretty much everything they had to offer. Because of our conversation, our next New York trip is going to feature a trip to Unidentified Flying Chickens in Jackson Heights. But if you're in Chicago, definitely check out Crisp if you're looking for some excellent Korean fried chicken.As their slogan says, ""The bird is the word."""
"They do fantastic friend chicken at this place...and it is on the NORTH SIDE! It is rare to find a place with great chicken that isn't on the West or South side.I can't speak to the other items on the menu (rice bowl, burrito) because everything I got I buy the chicken, either in whole or wing form.I dig all the sauces and each one is great, depending on what I am in the mood for. Sometimes a guy just wants some buffalo wings, not Seoul Sassy.They also cater out wings for parties....I got wings for the Superbowl. The wings look expensive on the menu, but it is important to remember that each ""wing"" includes the wing and the drummette."
"The fried chicken looks and smells delicious, but I was in the mood for a rice bowl. I had the Chi-town chicken bowl which consists of white rice and chicken sauteed chicken with creamy, garlicky and slightly tangy sauce topped with scallions. The food came out very quickly but appeared fresh nonetheless. I'll have to come back and try the bimbop bowls, all of which look yummy and intriguing (with nontradional items like corn)."
"I hate that I'm not going to do this place justice with a thorough review, but suffice it to say that you must go there and get a buddha bowl. I think i ordered a veggie one with tofu?? I don't recall because it was a few months ago and I forgot to review it. I had never had Korean food before and my friend and I walked in real quick and it just BLEW MY MIND!!"
This place fits my checklist.1.Delicious2.Unique3.Courteous4.Non-generic musicWhat more could you want?
"My boyfriend's friends RAVE about this place.  They say it's like crack and that you will crave it nightly.  We decided to try it on Friday afternoon, and it was pretty good, but I'm not craving it nightly. I got the chicken strips with Seoul Sassy, which was tasty but left something to be desired.  My bf got a half chicken with the BBQ sauce, which he wasn't too crazy about.  If I came back I think I would order one of their bowls because it seems like a lot of people there were ordering that.  I would only be coming back, though, because I live in the area and is convenient.  If I lived outside of southern Lakeview/northern Lincoln Park, I probably wouldn't make a special trip."
"as a korean american, i had high hopes for this place! i have to say THE WINGS here are def worth the hype! the seoul sassy sauce is def the best and these wings are much bigger than gam-pungee (typical korean wings) but just as delicious! i didn't love the BIBIMBOP (it was sort of a wanna-be), but the BURRITOS are actually amazing! Burrito+korean=genius. Will be returning soon for the wings and burritos!!!"
"Mmm, me likey.I grabbed some Crisp to go before going out last night, and it was super.  I had the ""Jessica special"" - 3 chicken strips.  He asked me what sauce, and I said, ""whatever is the least spicy.""  He nodded.  He understood.  He was a very nice man, and my food was ready quickly.  Sweet.When I got to my destination and opened the box, I was a bit sad because it smelled really, really spicy.  Meh.  Not what I wanted prior to a night of drinking.  It was also hot temperature wise so I let it cool down, but had already resigned myself to the fact that I probably wouldn't be eating it.But then I tried a little bite...  and YUM, HOLY MOTHER OF YUM.  It smelled more spicy than it was.  Actually, the sauce was freaking perfection.  The chicken was moist and delicious.  Oh my yumminess.And did I mention they gave me 4 chicken strips, not 3?  Nice.  Though I only made it through 2 - Crisp is very filling!  Good thing I didn't opt for the meal deal....I sort of can't wait to go back here."
"Justin B and I stopped in tonight.  We have a tendency to do these mini ""taste of Broadway"" evenings where we grab a few things from various restaurants.  I'm embarrassed to admit that this was our first foray into Crisp.  We were looking for chicken, so went with an order of 10 of the Crisp wings (Korean BBQ sauce) for about $12 after tax.Um, holy crap.  These things are ridiculous.  We ended up only eating two each b/c they're HUGE.  I think we've been ruined by bar fare chicken wings, b/c these are actual wings - drummy + wing = Crisp chicken wing.  The sauce is sticky, sweet and HOT, a fantastic combination.  I licked my fingers after the first one but couldn't manage the same after the second, my mouth was too on fire, albeit it pleasantly on fire.We will be back ... and back ... and back again.  I'm thinking these will be the hit of our Super Bowl party ..."
"I actually tried Crisp a few months ago, but my friends and I were just reminiscing about it, and I realized I never wrote a review! I had been badgering Mr Man to try this place for ages, which is odd, since I am not really a fan of wings. However, Mr Man is a MADMAN for wings, and I thought he would like them. I know, I am so selfless. We actually ordered takeout to bring over to our friends' place for dinner. This was a great idea, because it meant we got to try a BUNCH of stuff, yay! The guy who took our order was really helpful, and gave great suggestions on what to get AND how much to get for 4 people. I believe we ordered a half chicken and 10 wings, so we got to try all 3 of the sauces. We also ordered a Buddha Bowl and a burrito. The wings are really big here, because they keep all 3 parts of the wing together, instead of separating them. I really like the BBQ sauce, but I think my favorite is the Seoul Sassy! I like the sweet soy flavor! The buffalo was too much for me, but my spice-loving boyf really liked them. I just licked my finger after just picking up a buffalo wing and putting it on my plate, and that little lick made my tongue tingle! (OK people, get your minds out of the gutter!) By the time I finished eating it, my lips were numb. The thing I REALLY liked about all the chicken is that the skin was nice and crispy (hence the name!), even with the sauce on them. I hate slimy grody chicken skin. The Big Boy Buddha bowl was OK. If you really like veggies, you'll like it. I thought it coulda used more sauce, and more rice. But I am spoiled and I prefer bibimbop in the stone bowls. It's just not the same without that yummy crispy rice on the bottom! Surprisingly, we all LOVED the burrito! We got the Seoul Sensation, because Mr Man and I love Bulgogi! I was skeptical at first. I mean, seriously, Korean burrito? I'm all about fusion, but that just sounds silly! Shame on me for pre-judging, cuz that burrito was AWESOME! So tasty! Just goes to show, bulgogi goes with EVERYTHING! I would come back for some KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) again! Good if you want some yummy takeout that isn't your regular old stuff."
"Un-cluckin'-believable. The hubby and I had been meaning to try this place for the longest time and tried it for the first time today.  We ordered the half portion of Crisp BBQ chicken, the Baby Buddha Bowl with beef and a large Superfly Frites. All were absolutely delicious.  The Buddha Bowl, according to my husband, was just as bi bim bap should be - a scrumptious mishmash of fresh veggies, rice, and beef. The fries were crispy and salty on the outside, potatoey on the inside. And the chicken...oh my god...don't even get me started on the chicken. Served piping hot and smothered in the most unique mouthwatering sweet and spicy sauce, it was barbeque perfection. The chicken was also some of the crispiest and juiciest I've ever had. I'm not usually a fan of chicken ""on-the-bone"" but this dish had me sucking every last morsel of meat off the bone. Fabulous.  And huge portions too.I'm in Chicago only for the summer and have sampled many restaurants during my stay here. This ranks in my top three so far.  A great super low-key place to go with friends.  As other Yelpers have hinted at, not a great place for a romantic date or a special occasion (unless that special occasion was that someone had an enormous craving for amazing Korean BBQ).Admittedly, I actually just signed up for a Yelp account today because I wanted to share just how good this place was.  Please go and support them :)"
Best chicken ever!!! My girlfriend HATES  chicken  but after a small bite she took my half chicken order and made me order more. I wish they brought their chicken to San Francisco.
"Sadly I have to admit, compared to other big cities Chicago is lacking when it comes to great Korean restaurants.  Aside from Cho San Ok in Lincoln Square, this is the only other Korean (er Korean American) establishment I would recommend.My personal favorite is the Seoul sensation burrito. Unlike the typical rice burritos you find at Chipotle, this baby doesn't leave you feeling gross and heavy at the end of consumption. Filled with rice, marinated beef and a variety of vegetables, it not only tastes good but it's healthy too. The burrito also comes with a pink sauce which I will warn you, is very spicy. If you can handle it, i would strongly suggest you use it. But once again, especially to all the non Koreans out there, it's quite spicy.My second favorite dish is the Dakota steakhouse sandwich. Essentially, this is a Korean style cheese steak sandwich. If you're lactose and tolerant just ask the staff to customize this delicious sandwich. I think what makes this dish amazing is the bread they use. If I  get too full, I forgo the meat and at LEAST try to finish the bread. The Fried Chicken is great too.  The Seoul Sassy is the most popular and my personal favorite but in general all of them rock! On top of  great tasting food the service here is superb. Employees are eager to serve often bringing your order TO you and offering to clear your table afterwords. They are a friendly bunch, always smiling and wanting to get to know more about you. If  you stop by alone don't hesitate to eat in. With community sitting and an outgoing staff, dining alone here is def. not a problem."
"First thing that stood out about Crisp was the service.  I've been in the restaurant to eat and have gotten food delivered and both ways the service has been great.  I'm not sure if the guy I remember is a manger, owner, or whatever but he was just the right amount of talkative, polite, and super friendly.  Even the guy that delivered my food one night told me how much he appreciated my business and hoped to see me again before the holiday but if not to be sure I had a merry Christmas.  Service aside, the food is also good.  I can see this quickly becoming a place I would regularly order from.  I've tried the Seoul Sensation, the Bad Boy Buddha Bowl, and a variety of appetizers.  The only thing I'm still undecided about is the mashed potatoes.  Unique approach but a little too sweet for me although give them a whirl if you want something different.  Overall 3 stars but plus one because of the great service."
"So after reading lots of good reviews, I decided to check this place out. I was starving and craving chicken and veggies after a long day and I thought Crisp would fit the bill. The Baby budda bowl was tasty and satisfying, though I still should have gotten the regular size. I also got the super strips which I was pretty excited to dig into. The strips were a bit disappointing, dry, and way too salty. It seemed like I got the ones that had been sitting around for awhile.The other thing that threw me off was, other than the menu items there is nothing Korean about the space. Normally I'm all about mashing up different cultures, America is a melting pot right? They were blasting Sublime and Bob Marley, which I love, but it just felt out of place here. The staff didn't seem to enthused to be there either, and I got the vibe that they could have just as easily been working in a pizza or sandwich joint and not noticed a difference in their surroundings."
"Since moving to Chicago i have been on a search for real god Korean food--like the kind my friends mom used to make,  I have found it.  Although Crisp is fusion style food---it hits the mark!  I had the baby Buddha bowl (which is not so baby) which is the equivalent of Korean bim bim bop.  I was so busy eating that i do not think i talked at all during the whole meal.  My husband got the tangy wings and he was just as happy with his meal as i was.I will be back!"
"The picnic bench like tables make for a cozy atmosphere and encourages random talks with strangers.   Hopefully this stranger is one of the owners who overhears you telling your friend that he cannot consume both a bibimbap and 5 of Crisp's mutant wings.   He tells us to wait, and comes back 5 minutes later with a hefty basket of mutant wings.  Talk about a nice guy!  The task was completed: 1 big bowl of bibimbap and 5 wings gone.  Never underestimate the power of hunger.  Jerry Z., I will never bet against you when it comes to food.People claim that it's not authentic Korean; they don't claim to be, so stop accusing.Things I learned from speaking with one of the owners:-the chicken's fresh, not frozen-they're looking to open more locations-they're working on the liquor license and lengthening hours-the wings don't travel well.  If you want crisp wings, eat inGo and get your Crisp on."
"The last time I was there, I mistakenly ordered the BBQ instead of Seoul Sassy (my favorite) and Crisp was kind enough to correct the mistake and give me the BBQ order for free! Talk about great customer service. The manager also came over to make sure we were happy with our meal.  I was really impressed and happy to have an extra meal for the next day! The wings can be reheated easily in the oven.Crisp has the best chicken wings I have ever had! They come in a variety of flavors, Asian style. My favorite is the Seoul Sassy which is a little sweet, a tad spicy, and served with fresh green onions and sesame seeds.  I am also a fan of the original BBQ which is spicier/hotter.  The grade of chicken wings used is great; large, meaty and quality. It's also pretty affordable for 5 wings (plenty for 1-2 people) or 10 wings (more than enough for 2-3 people).   Two caveats: I've never tried the other Korean dishes, and it's important to keep in mind that this is a 5-star WINGS place, not necessarily known for being a Korean restaurant.  Also, if you're sensitive to salt you should know that the wings contain plenty of it (and it tastes good)."
We went with our kids for what was supposed to be amazing chicken. We were not so impressed. The chicken had a lot of breading but was a bit over cooked for our taste. We got just the fried chicken and not any of the other specialty types as our little boy can be picky. (no sauces). We wish we might have tried one of those as it may have added some more flavor. I suppose we were most disappointed in our plate of chicken because there was very little meat on the bones. I was mainly the breading and not much meat at all. The drink options are pretty limited other than bottles of various predictable brands. Overall it was an ok experience. We might return to try out one of the other versions as others around us seemed to be enjoying them but I can't say this joint has lived up to the hype we have heard about it so far. This is also mainly a take out place.  There are a few picnic type tables to sit at but there is not much space.
5 stars for giving the engineer a chain puzzle while waiting for my grub... i almost forgot i was hungry i was so geeked outoh ya and their chicken wings are amazing too...
"Overall, a decent meal.  I have to confess that I miss the original Ricebox though with their cute bento boxes and quantity of quality food for a great price.  Between a group of us, we split 20 wings - each one of tried all four of their different flavors.  Our favorites were probably the Sassy Seoul and the BBQ.  The Seoul was served with green onions and flavored just right.  The wings are full wings and lightly battered so the half of the flavors, that we did like were good.  But the other two that we weren't too fond of - the original was just way too bland and the other one was spicy but not just well cooked at all.  Since I'm not huge on spicy stuff, the girls warned me not to even try them.  But even so, those were the only wings that we couldn't finish because of the disappointing taste.  We also ordered onion rings and fried mushrooms on the side which were disappointing and reeked out of frozen fried food that was just tossed into the oven - not even the fryer to get that crisp fried taste.  We also ordered their bi bim bop and the pound of vegetables that is found in the bi bim bop.  You could totally tell that corn in the vegetables was just out of the can.  And cold corn out of a can - not very appealing to me.Overall price - a little under $50 for five of us so a good deal but not sure if I really want to head back anytime soon."
"I went with a group of five so we were able to try everything.  I thought all the wings were just ok, the super spicy one (buffalo??) was almost inedible.  And there's something that needs to be said about Asian Fusion and Americanized Asian, they're not the same thing.  The bimibap was authentic, not spicy enough, but flavors were still there.  Their fried foods seems odd to have there, like onion rings and fried mushroom.Not gonna go again :(  Sticking to my Great Seas."
Take Awesome...mix it with chicken wings and you get Crisp.  Best Chicken Wings and Chicken Dinner... Love to eat here with all my friends and try out all their unique drinks.  Their mushrooms... amazing.  Their wings?  Even better.  Great location and the people are always talkative and fun to order from.  Def feels like its a healthy dinner
"One drunken night, around the halfway point in a sordid send-off of a former temp at my office, I went to get some beer down the street from this intoxicating little chicken hut. As I was purchasing said beer it hit me that I was in the vicinity of that magical Korean taste-palace, Crisp. I coerced my compatriots to take the hike for some off-the-beaten-path flavor and the El Dorado of taste was to be found at road's end. The chicken was moist, the breading crisp and the sauces flavorful and not cloying. We devoured the first two orders and were able to crack the beers we had just purchased as well. Well, me...I was drinking a can of Aloe Water, since my love for that little jelly-drink runs deep."
"One of my favorite fried chicken places.The flavors are so good and so addictive.  The chicken tastes so fresh.The meal for two has so much food that I thought we were going to blow up when almost finishing it.The next time I go, I'll have to try their Buddha bowls to see if they are any good."
"Me and my party ordered the jumbo wings here. Honestly, the wings were a bit dried. So I'm not a huge fan. However, their bulgorgi (Seoul steak) bowl was pretty good. Tasted pretty much what normal bulgorgi should be. So all in all, this place is ok."
"Crisp is hands down awesome.  Their BBQ chicken wings are perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of fried.  I also highly recommend the Magic Mushrooms, which are battered and fried and come with Crisp's amazing dipping sauce.  The staff is friendly and laid back and the food comes out pretty quickly.  Love this place!"
"So, whenever I grumpily drive crosstown to crisp, I have an internal conversation/argument with myself. It always goes the same and ends the same. It goes a little like this:Good me: yay! I love crisp, their buddah bowl are large, can come with brown rice and full of fresh veggies. They are healthy AND delicious.Insidious me: and what about them seoul sassy wings you love so much.Good me: oh, well...no! Those are the opposite of good for me. I would be undoing all the hours spent sweating at the gym and the point of dropping $15 on a ""healthy"" lunch.Insidious me: But you no longer live in lakeview, you are gonna drive all this way, illegally park in an alley, and are gonna bypass those impossibly perfectly sweet and savory, larger than practical wings?Good me: well...when you put it that way...Then I succumb and grab a 5 piece order of wings. Crisp can be pricey, but I accept it and I accept it enough to leave the south loop, brave lakeshore drive from Roosevelt to fullerton to enjoy it. They are that good. Do not be fooled, the wings are large. But also, don't kid yourself, you aren't going to want to share."
"i tried crisp for the first time about a year ago, and decided that a labor day weekend hangover was the perfect opportunity to get another taste of some fried korean goodness.holy crap. it's a good thing that the parking situation is such a nightmare and they don't deliver to me- this shit is amazing! i walked in, grabbed a menu, and immediately had a super friendly (and cute) employee helping me make decisions. my chicken sandwich with sassy sauce was stellar, the wing i tried was huge and extra crispy, and only the onion rings were bland and below average (my fault for ordering them- i should have made room for more wings instead)! the cutie behind the counter explained all their sauces in detail, and even put samples of each one in my to-go bag. for the record: sassy is the best, close second is the tangy bbq, and i'll pass on the creamy lookin red one. we'll meet again, crisp."
"I was casually walking through the shops nearby and decided I wanted to eat somewhere new. I'm relatively new to Chicago and I've been a couple a places, so when I saw Crisp...I just new I had to eat here. I got their fried chicken and it was AWESOME! I wasn't sure which one to try at first so I ordered half Plain Jane and the other half was Seoul Sassy. And OMG! I was kicking myself for not getting it all SS.  That sweet sauce with the fried chicken was the BEST I have ever had. I will always go here for their chicken every time I'm in the area. GO EAT THEIR FRIED CHICKEN! ^_^"
"I agree with the 5 star reviews on here.For those of you who have not had a delicious wing/buddha bowl/burrito...get it done.  Get it done quick, now.Negative: It is CLOSED on Mondays.  Or, rather it was closed this monday 8/17/09.  EPIC FAIL."
"Crisp is a bright, funky little place with excellent customer service and very polite staff. Being BYOB is always a plus in my book too!So, why the reason for the so-so review you might ask? I blame myself mostly. While, I could have tried various new and exciting items such as the ""Buddha Bowl"" or their renown chicken wings in ""Seoul Sassy"" sauce, I opted for less adventurous option, the chicken burrito. Why? Well I was starving and it was familiar. The chicken burrito was ""meh."" While it did have a unique peanut-esque type of flavor to it, it was overall dry and I was not very impressed. My boyfriend ordered the steak burrito and displayed the same level of enthusiasm towards it as I did my own dish. That and the communal table can be a pain in the rear. It really can ruin a dining experience when you sit literally next to two loud-mouthed white collar men yelling about ""corporate"" and one accidentally pulling off part of his shirt while removing his outerwear and exposing bodily hair to the unsuspecting viewer.That being said, I would be more than willing to try Crisp again and will certainly try something more unique and I am sure more palette-friendly. If the place weren't too small I would also recommend going with 4 or so people in order to reserve a communal table for only your group and thus hopefully  avoid being seated next to customers who may make you lose most of your appetite. However, the size of Crisp may make dining-in with a group very tricky and not necessarily recommended."
"I have been wanting to come here ever since Rocky B posted the first review. It sounded tasty. Then the overwhelming amount of friends who were telling me how great this place was, my friend Sarah G talked about how great their Buddha Bowls were... fine I'm there. I had an hour before my next client, I had put in a two hour workout in and I was starving. I was going. I knew I was going for the healthier version of the traditional Bi Bim Bop, the Buddha Bowl. Going for the brown rice, five vegetables, some chicken, it was something I had been craving this all week long. What I didn't have was a lot of time. However I was supposed to come here, there was a free parking space in front waiting for me. When I came in I was greeted by one of the owners. He made this review go from four to five stars. He was more than happy to tell me all about the place and their food. He was so passionate, I myself could hardly wait to get back to work to try this stuff! Looking around the place, it is simple. plenty of selections of drinks have and a good amount of seats. It all took about five minutes, the owner gave me some extra hot sauce, just in case I like it a little spicy, which of course I do.When I got back to the gym, I had just about ten minutes to eat. I quickly opened up my bowl, dropped in some of the hot sauce and dished in some rice and stirred it up. Oh my sweet Jebus. It was wonderful. I quickly polished it off... I was full. My second stomach wished there was more, but some times you just have to tell that second stomach to be quiet. I really can't wait to go back, I know they have their fried chicken, they have their burritos... screw that.. I just want another Buddha Bowl."
Best wings! I am a fan of the Seoul Sassy but need to try the other flavors. The staff was awesome as well as the owner! I cant wait to go back!
"While I was on my all girls vacay in Chicago, a friend of ours who is from Chicago recommended this place to us.  I am glad that we came here for lunch because it was the best fried chicken ever!!!  Oh, and their kimchi was soo yummy!!  If you ever go to Chicago, check this place out for some really good fried chicken!"
"I definitely walked like 6 blocks in the -20 degree weather to eat their burritos and chicken wings.I don't think I'd repeat that scenario if possible, but I've been multiple times and it's always a winner."
These wings are GOOD!  They are HUGE.  My favorite is the Sassy.  Would definitely return.
"I ate here a year ago but only had the bi bim bop at the time.  It was good but they added so many extra charges that I ended u paying over ten bucks for what is otherwise a pretty simple dish that should never be over eight bucks.My bf and i came here last weekend and decided to try the chicken.  YUM! I love me some chicken wings and having the korean twist just made it that much better.  I think the sauces are delicious and original and just adds something different.  I've had korean styled wings before but I really think CRISP has got the taste down.  The seoul sassy is a teriyaki flavored sauce, but it's much more delicious.  My bf ordered the korean bbq and wow, it was so delicious!  Honestly, the flavors really impressived me and I left craving more.  When I go back, I will be having both the seoul sassy and the korean bbq because I liked switching back and forth between the two flavors.The only thing missing here is some moo, which is a white radish pickled in vinegar that Korean restaurants usually serve with fried food.  It cleanses the palate and cuts through the grease.  Eating chicken without the Moo was sad for me.. it was like eating sushi without the ginger.  If they would only get some moo to go with the chickens, I would add another star!"
"A solid 4 rating.  Wings were great (split an order between the BBQ and the Seoul Sassy).  The BBQ had a nice spice to them.  Incredibly, the Seoul Sassy were best cold the next day.Bowls were excellent.  I would have liked a bit more spice but that may just be solved by asking for more of a kick when ordered.Delivery was a wee bit slow, but they get double points for riding their bike down to Lincoln Park on a cold Friday night.We will be back and highly recommend to others."
"I split an order of 10 wings + rice with Anh, which cost $10 + $2 for the rice.  You can ask any asian person, there is not many things much more annoying than having to pay extra for rice, especially at an asian restaurant.  But, I have to say, that $12 was enough to fill both of us, which is a relatively cheap meal.  I ordered half sassy and half BBQ, and preferred the BBQ.  This is completely off the wall, but for a place that's been open less than a year, I thought the bathroom was quite run down.  The grout between the tiles were already dark and grimy.  The caulking around the sinks were poorly done.  I just hope the cooks don't take shortcuts like what happened with the bathroom.  Anyway, I think the chicken is pretty good and fair for the price, but I think they can do better.  Employees were friendly.  As far as flavor goes, drumsticks from Great Sea are still my fave."
"The Air and Water Show is TODAY! What better way to celebrate than a rooftop pool party? So what if it isn't my rooftop... or my pool... I'm bringing delicious, delectable Crisp chicken to share and wearing a cute bikini- this city is MINE! Bill Murray is going to have to skydive into it... Move over Daley, there will be some chicken for you too... but don't hurt my self esteem by paying more attention to the chicken. I know... I know... the challenge!"
"I went to this spot on accident and was blown away. Based on taste it gets a ""5 Stars"" but minor things can be a bit annoying. However, the wings...the wings...the wings! They are PERFECTLY crispy and the seoul sassy sauce you will just want to drink. It can be a bit expensive for a quick lunch but at the same time, it's very filling. The owner is a really nice guy and they really want to know if you enjoyed your food. Texture, salt and still juicy, Crisp can give a few #southside joints a run for the money"
"I wish I could parallel park better! I wish they were open 24 hours a day! I love this place! I've been there 5-6 times and have preached the glory of the food to several of my friends- who are now loyal followers! The Seoul Sassy- sweet, tangy sauce with scallions on perfectly fried chicken! *drool* It's 9:18 am and I am drooling at work! The Plain Jane- just as good as the Seoul Sassy, but I have to say the Seoul Sassy wins. It's something about the sauce! I get the whole chicken. I know people like the wings, but I like the variety of having different cuts of the chicken...white/dark.. you know? The bulgogi burrito with the atomic sauce- spicy mayo-ey sauce! Always ALWAYS ask for extra sauce! The burrito is filled with rice, carrots, lettuce, corn and bulgogi, wrapped in a nice tortilla. Now, since I try to stay healthy, I only share the burrito- it's huge anyways! And the fries.... *drool x2* I need to learn how to parallel park better......."
"I am apparently the last Yelper to find his way to Crisp, so this review will be short, sweet, and to the point. Just like the chicken at Crisp.The woman working the counter was the perfect person for a Crisp virgin to encounter, though by the sound of it, all of the employees are great at customer service. She talked us through the concept, told us we could get a half-and-half whole chicken instead of two half chickens, and explained the sauces. We wanted to try everything, so we got half plain and half BBQ, with Seoul sassy and Buffalo sauces on the side. We also got a large order of fries, and even for two people, it was too much.The chicken was perfect. The pieces were nicely trimmed, so there wasn't any of that alien chicken nastiness you sometimes get with fried chicken. The pieces are not huge, but very meaty. I'm glad we got some plain, so we could taste the seasoning and not just sauce. Though the BBQ was very nice -- a little sweet, a little spicy.When we got there (about 6:30) the place was empty, and by the time we got our food, it was full. Doug -- who my friend recognized from Budacki's, because it is her crack -- told us we have to come in every night at the same time. Sounds good to me."
"If you want something fried and delicious, you must go here. The korean wings, breaded mushrooms and fries are a must. I didn't care for the bowls."
There are already close to 600 reviews for Crisp as I write this and I'm pretty sure I can't top some of the great reviews out there. So here's the skinny:1. Wings are phenomenal with an Asian twist to it. MUST TRY.2. Don't want to get your hands dirty? Grab a Korean Burrito with delicious marinated beef.3. Ask for a side of Atomic Sauce. Just do it.
"These gigantic Seoul and Sassy wings are simply succulent and juicy. I brought home a box for my roommates as a surprise.  They thought I was picking up buffalo wings.  As soon as we took our first bite, we all looked at eachother in awe.One of my other roommates had the caeser, and she was not a fan. On a good note, there was plenty of chicken on there.I was also given a complimentary side of the daikon raddish kimchee, which was much appreciated. (eventhough they usually come with the meal at real Korean restaurants)Their entire menu is filled with a variety of options, from the traditional and untraditional beebim bop, to Korean burritos and plenty of healthy alternatives.  I will definitely be coming back."
"so disapponited...I'm a fried chicken fanatic but Crisp left me wondering what on earth the hype and buzz is about. Paula Deen has absolutely nothing to worry about nor does any diiner south of the Mason Dixon.My half chicken was cut in odd small pieces, The chicken was dry and the seasoning off putting. If your a fan of classic American fried chicken, I'd take a pass"
"Chicken wings AND Asian food all in one delicious spot?! The first time I walked into Crisp, I was hit with such delicious aromas, making my hungry stomach growl as I waited (not very long at all) for my bibimbap aka the Baby Buddha Bowl. I skipped home in anticipation and was not disappointed! Soooo good! I always get the brown rice, a little healthier option, which is an extra $1.50, but worth it for my psyche. The Baby Buddha Bowl is definitely a big enough meal, but they also offer two larger bowls with more veggies. I can barely finish the baby bowl and have not yet graduated to the others though. It took a couple trips to Crisp before I could order the fatty deliciousness of Crisp's chicken. The Seoul Sassy is reaaaaallllllly good! The chicken was indeed very crispy - you can't take the skin off of this chicken; you would miss the whole point of the event! And the fried mushrooms with atomic sauce are reallllllly good too! One of the fattest meals I've had in awhile, but well worth it! (Mouth is watering right now!) And to all those who say it's not terribly authentic - I've seen more Korean patrons here than I've seen at ""authentic"" Korean restaurants, which means it must at least be a good fake! Also the staff is super friendly and accommodating, and the food is decently priced. Crisp won't help my ""healthy '09"" resolutions, but will definitely be on my cheat list!"
Let's just say there's a reason why Crisp is well known for their wings. A bit pricey but HUGE portions. Their bowls are great too. I love the Bad Boy Buddha Bowl! :)
"I went to Crisp for the second time today, my first visit being shortly after they opened.  I couldn't remember exactly what I liked so much about it, but I had been thinking about it ever since that first visit.  Today, I was reminded of why it stayed in my brain.  The Seoul Sassy wings are phenomenal.  They are crack, and I'll be thinking about how to get my next fix until I get back there.  Who would have thought that bird skin could be sooo delicious?  The sauce is perfectly spicy and sweet (my favorite combination of flavors).  Unfortunately, their delivery range stops just short of my building (they only go as far north as Irving Park).  Shucks!  Probably for the best, though.  I might weigh 200 pounds if I could have those wings some to my door.  (The Buddha Bowls are really good, too, and probably a whole lot healthier!)"
"Why in the world did I just find out they deliver last night?!?!  I guess I don't read very GOODLY, since it clearly states that on this page and all around their restaurant.  But, I'm like a horse with blinders when it comes to Crisp.....I just want my damn Chicken WANGS!!!  Order made over the phone, estimated delivery was within one hour, and arrived in 20.  Hewls to the yeah.....Crisp + Delivery = Daaaahnjerrous....."
"Best chicken you will ever get in ChitownI was initially skeptical, but my friend and I went this place. I ordered half sassy flavored and half Korean BBQ.. OMG, It is soooo goood. Sassy flavored chicken's skin is very crispy, yet the meat is very tender and juicy!. The Korean BBQ, on the other hand, i just plain good!!I would prefer people to try 5 pieces of wings instead of getting traditional  chickens"
"I will never, ever in a million billion years take a date here. I'm already a messy eater as is, and why give them ammunition to end it because of my unkempt eating habits? Remind me to tell you the story of me at Ribfest. In a white shirt. It's the stuff of legends, or so you would think among my friends - it's been 5 years and they're STILL talking about that. And Crisp chicken is messy beyond belief. At least the finger food chicken I got. Which was evident by the pile of napkins and greasy bones on my tray.But I would take my crush. Or I'll just buy it here. In strawberry. In a can.YUM.I went during the lunch rush crowd, and got the 3 wing and frites special for 6 bucks with a pop - sweet deal! I ordered the plain Jane (because we all know that's what I am), but the guy at the register talked me into getting it with the most popular sauce: Seoul Sassy, which was a sweet sauce with undertones of ginger. It came out sprinkled with green onions. The chicken was crispy, the sauce tasted great, and I will order it again, but I'll ask for extra sauce. My friend had far more sauce on her order - she got the BBQ, which was very spicy.And customer service is king here - the manager who convinced me that I was more of a Seoul Sassy than a Plain Jane offered to remake me the dish if I didn't like it and he even came up to my table halfway through the meal to make sure that it was up to par. SWEET!Even though the eats are wonderful here, I still won't take a date here. Only after he marries me - because marriage is for better or worse, no?"
"Every entree on this menu is amazing!The bi-bim-bop (buddha bowl) is quick and cheap and the healthiest carryout you can find in the area.Wings are delectable, burritos are first rate and the bowls (I think Chi-town chicken Seoul steak) are outstanding. The atomic sauce it comes with makes these dishes. The best part of this restaurant is the service. Howie is the man! He will absolutely remember you, even if you only go once. They play good music and the food is consistent and quickly served. The absolute best takeout in the city..."
"if I could steer Guy towards one place on triple D, it would be Crisp.  Can't go wrong with ANYTHING here.  Crisp BBQ wings are solid, but almost too messy.  Don't get the strips though, thats cheating.  Seoul Sassy wings are as good as it gets as well. Such bold flavors, these guys really go all out.  Then there are the buddha bowls...unbelievable.  The Original Bad Boy buddha bowl is the go-to here.  Not really a ""complaint"" but they use too much rice, the big issue is that i will eat all the rice until i explode.Recently tried the foodies choice crisp, which is a fried chicken cutlet in whatever sauce you want (i chose BBQ - buffalo may be a good choice next) on a great roll with veggies and bleu cheese.  They use spinach leaves instead of shitty shredded lettuce like McDonalds, and cherry tomatoes, not those soggy/flimsy ones you see just about everywhere else.  This sandwich is out bounds, you guys.  BYOB as well, but kind of difficult to put back some cold ones with the copious amounts of food without exploding.This place isn't perfect though (see the missing star)...open only til 9 which is a bummer, and its not a good place to go to with more than a few people due to limited seating.  Second part doesn't really bother me much - don't need a bunch of people i know seeing me with sauce all over myself."
"The wings are gigantic!! Baby Budda - nothing baby about it, it was more than enough for me, at $5.95, you can add meat for just a buck more. Did I say the wings are gigantic??Fried to the ""crisp"" just enough so when they tossed with one of their sauce, it coats it perfectly. Sweet, sticky and messy....Love It!Not the kind of food for you if you don't like to eat with your hands. Although I saw these 2 Thai girls eating it forks and knife, weird.Go for the wings, try some bowl, you should be good to go."
"1 word... YUM. The bibimbap here is wonderful and comes in great big portions, which is important to me. You can have your choice of 3 sizes, so you can pick which one fits you best. The wings are flavorful and crispy, my favorite flavors being the Seoul Sassy and the Crisp Barbeque."
"Being Korean myself and kind of a foodie, I think i make pretty good Korean fried chicken, but Crisp puts me to shame.  Their plain Jane is really good.  Not overly seasoned, lightly coated but very crispy and flavorful.  I am a dark meat kind of guy, so I skip the full bird and just get the wings.  If you are in the mood for sauce, I would get the Seoul Sassy followed by the bbq.  Just be careful, since the bbq is a bit spicy, maybe they put Korean chili paste in it?  The buddha bowls are pretty good too (just wished they gave you more chili paste than the small cup).  Order it with beef!"
"OK, I come here and always order the same thing and love it.....the Chicago Burrito.  This monster is actually two meals for me....jammed packed with chicken and fresh veggies....WHEW!  I'm a believer.  BTW--limited seating....several long tables with benches."
"I was on the mission to buying an engraver to engrave my knives and tools for pastry school. Lucky me, Ace hardware was a couple blocks from Crisp! I heard great things so I had to stop in and get some chicken. I ordered 5 wings with 2 different sauces (BBQ and Seoul Sassy). I favored the BBQ and thought the Seoul Sassy was a little bland. I ate the BBQ  first and it was exploding with flavor and may have been the reason why the Sassy was bland. Also, 5 wings was PLENTY. The wings were HUGE!"
"I LOVE Crisp. I would have given them 5 stars but they don't deliver to the Gold Coast! If someone from Crisp reads this, PLEASE extend your delivery to State and Division. I'll even meet you on the corner if you don't want to come another 1/2 block to Elm."
"Oh my sweet gherkins!!!I went there last week after helping some friends move and I have FOUND MY NEW WING SPOT!!! The wings are super CRISPY! Apparently they use a gluten free flour to batter the wings and this enhances the crispness. Really, there's nothing worse than a slimy, over breaded, chewy chicken wing.... Needless to say these wings were fabulous!! As for sauces, I highly recommend the ""Seoul Sassy"". I tried the ""Crisp BBQ"", which seemed more enticing because of the great red color, but after the taste test, it was the ""Seoul Sassy"" that won my heart. By the way, the steak bowl was pretty darn good too."
"we got the 10 piece chicken wings with seoul sassy and crisp BBQ sauce and some fries and a drink.  the wings are HUGE and realllly tender and juicy i was kind of surprised cuz it said they dont use any GM chickens and dont GM chickens usually taste more tender??  cuz theyre fat.  anyway,  both the sauces were super good i couldnt pick which one i liked more.  i dont usually eat too much of the skin when i eat fried chicken but it was just so super good i couldnt help it i ate like all of it.  im pretty sure my arteries are now coated in a layer of cholesterol now though.  the fries were pretty good too but i think maybe its just cuz i havent had fries in awhile.there was barely any seating and instead of napkins they just put out rolls of paper towels which is super ghetto but whatever.  they have a bathroom but its only one so you cant just go wash your hands at any point you have to kinda just use their cheap paper towels to try to degrease your hands."
Was really crowded and got food to go with a coupon.  Took a chance because the place never stuck out to me before.  I got the fried chicken wiith fries with I think the Seoul sauce.  Was really yummy!  The fries were thin and perfect.  Will be visiting this place again soon!
"Maybe I should give Crisp another try because so many rave about it. But honestly, their wings underwhelmed me. I tried two varieties, the Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy. The Sassy was, for me, almost inedibly salty and overseasoned with ginger. I love the ginger, but it's a potent little root and if you overdo it, you're asking for trouble. The Crisp BBQ was like a bland hybrid of American and Korean BBQ sauces. As a side, I got the fried mushrooms, which were soggy and rubbery in a way that made me pine for the fried mushrooms from Brown's Chicken, and if you get people pining for Brown's Chicken, somewhere along the way you've gone off the rails.When I crave wings, I instantly think of the honey sesame wings from Joong Boo market, which I hold as the gold standard, and Crisp just didn't make the cut."
Seoul. Sassy. Sauce.
"Having been to Crisp several times, I can now give it a good rating that I can stick with. The food is great. The service is good. My only quibble is the price. Honestly, almost $9 for a chicken sandwich, a can of soda, and some fries? Good place if you're really in the mood for chicken, but I just haven't been that impressed by anything else on the menu.EDIT: I'm keeping the original review up for reference. They lowered the price on the Chicken Sandwich with fries and a drink, and it's now very affordable. With that in mind, I'm bumping them up to 5 stars. Next time you go in, tell them Adam sent you. Why Adam? Because I'm there so much they know me by name. Enjoy!"
"Awesome sauces on their fried chicken.  I've had a couple burritos and Buddha bowls, but the chicken is where it's at.  At first I figured that anyone could buy sauce from H-Mart and slather it on some fried chicken -- but it works and it's kind of addicting.  Crisp BBQ is my favorite, Seoul Sassy is solid too.  I usually need a whole chicken to get full, but I tend to eat a lot.Food comes out quick and people are nice.  I'd recommend eating the food there, cause a 15-minute drive home makes a big difference.  And smelling the food for that long without being able to eat it is pure torture.  Now if only the prices were just a couple bucks lower..."
I absolutely love Crisp!  It was one of my favorite go to spots in Lakeview.  The wings are fabulous!  I love all of the sauces and the price is great!  I usually order my food from here to go or delivery so I have never really dined in to enjoy the atmosphere.  Whenever I have gone in to pick up my food the staff was always very friendly and helpful.  Now that I live a little further north I definitely miss going to Crisp!
"If I was going to do Porn n' Chicken at my house, this would be the chicken.Very tasty, very crispy."
"Food was probably one of the best wings I ever had. I also ordered the baby Buddha which was also awesome with a fried egg but they don't make the eggs fresh, there cold and don't run which I was hopping for. I asked them to make me another egg but they said that's how they come. Either way all the food was delicious. I would've gave 5 stars but the parking is horrible and getting a seat to eat is a bit of a challenge."
"Hyeah.Like Harold left his Chicken Shack # 23 and took 2 weeks vacay in Korea to see what Asian BBQ is all about.He then came back with KBQFC - Korean B'Cue Fried Chicken.Some smart U of C student on the south side (probably Asian...probably Korean) visits and steals recipe after one night of drinking (probably not a whole lot, cuz he's Asian) and visit to Harold's #23.Years pass.  U of C student gets his degree, he's smart, opens restaurant in Lincoln Park.  There's no Harold's in Lincoln Park.  But wait, there's no fried chicken in Lincoln Park either.Idea - Crisp.  Korean fried chicken.  K...F...C - we just bit on your name dog, and make way better fried chicken.  Now what.Plus they got a plasma.Smart idea - also give the peeps Bi Bim Bap and other Korean dishes.  Now you have something special on Broadway - albeit a little too close to Flub a Dub Chubs.  Tough call.The Buddha Bowl rocks, the chicken rocks (all 3 flavors).  My man who stole from Harold - you rock too.  No rest for the Asian weary."
"I could eat here everyday. I am a huge fried chicken addict but the Seoul Steak bowl is my personal fave here. I wish I knew the recipe...the taste is just amazing. I wouldn't know how to classify this food, whether or not it's authentic Korean, but I'll classify it as damn good food. Just thinking about it makes me hungry. Their lunch specials are great too! Give this little place a try and you won't regret it!"
"This is a must visit!  Got the chicken wings in seoul sassy an bbq, both delicious and can't wait to try the other flavours.  The wings were great, crispy skin with just the right amount of sauce and not too heavy a coating.  The size of the wings are huge, not the typical tiny ones, but this just makes for more yummy wings to eat!   Also had the Tofu Bad Buddha bowl which was yummy as well.  Nice variety of marinated veggies.I'll definitely be going back!"
"Crisp has some amazing wings! first time eating there today, and I was skeptical about the price but upon finding out you get the complete wing (drum and wing in one) I know I was in for a treat. I opted for the seoul sassy, but next time Im lookin to go for something a little on the spicier side. Fries were flawless, perfect compliment to any wing order. I like the bench seating, reminded me of a high school cafeteria haha. Plus it affords you the opportunity to meet new people. Will definitely be going back here again in the near future. Not exactly ideal for a large seating if youre going with a big group of friends, unless you can secure a table or 2 ahead of time. The chicken pretty much lives up to its name : crisp. meaty and crisp, with robust flavor."
"I tried Crisp for the first time last night. We had the plain jane, seoul sassy wings, and an original bad boy buddha. A+ for service! We had requested chicken on the bad boy buddha, but it came with beef. So, they topped it with chicken for free. I usually prefer my bi bim bap dol sot style (served in a hot stone bowl) bc it leaves a crispy layer of rice on the bottom, but the bad boy was delish. It was huge! I think I like the seoul sassy better than the plain jane. The plain jane did not satisfy my tong dok cravings even though I knew not to expect it from the reviews. Justin L. noted the missing white radishes traditionally served with Korean fried chicken. I totally agree! It makes the dish and I think it would be more popular than the kimchi."
"Ahhh, I went all Fatty McGee here.  I knew the Original Buddha was more than enough for my Buddha belly, but the idea of not eating any chicken was too sad so I split a half chicken Seoul Sassy with my buddy.  Now I'm lying down in near comatose state with the laptop on my engorged belly typing up this review.The personable manager, I want to say his name was John, was friendly and even hooked us up with some kimchi!  How was it?  Great flavor, super 'crisp'y... get it?  Shut it.  No really, it was crunchy.  I could have eaten the whole bowl.  Suggestions for the store.... two things, help out the customer eating bibimbap with chopsticks.  Get him a spoon or a fork or a mini shovel.  Failing at chopsticks never looked so painful.  I would have done it myself but I didn't want to be 'that' Asian guy.  Second thing, could you carry Squirt? I love Squirt.  I love chicken.  I love Squirt with chicken."
"Buddha Bowls are nice, I never get to the rice though.  Their sauces are awesome, I like their cafeteria-style seating, and the towels on a roll. Good meat, too."
"I go here about once every other week and I'm hooked on their food! Love their seoul steak bowl, as well as their burritos. Of course, the wings rock as well. Just great flavors...have never been disappointed with a meal there.Sometimes, the place gets packed and just one person is working the register and phones while trying to get food out - service may get slow at that point, but I'm willing wait to a bit. The food makes any delays totally worth it!"
"Out of this world chicken!!   At the suggestion of the very friendly owner, we ordered a whole chicken, half with the Crisp BBQ and the other half the Seoul Sassy.  The chicken was amazing.... really amazing.  Perfectly crispy skin.  Perfectly moist and hot on the inside, and really, really meaty cuts.  There wasn't a skimpy piece of chicken to be found.  Probably the best fried chicken I've had in Chicago.    Even places serving standard Buffalo wings could take a few lessons from this place.I really liked the sassy wings.  I also really liked the Crisp BBQ wings.  They were both very different and I'm torn between picking which I preferred...  I tried some of Brian's Bi Bim Bop... it was very tastey, but I don't have a lot to benchmark that against.The owner was very friendly, wanted to know everyone's names...and he actually remembered them, then came by ""Hey Dane how was this?""  Why yes thanks for asking, it was really good.    I really want to go back and try their burritos, their Buffalo wings, and other stuff now.  I think I found a new habit."
Great food for not a lot of cashdollars.  Apologies for actually using that descriptor.  Crisp does give you a lot of food so be hungry.  They have a pretty good variety.  I usually get a bbq bowl full of rice and veggies.  I like that you are encourage to mignle with fellow partons as you wait for you order.  There isn't a ton of seating so I usually go with carry out.
"One of my favorite places in Chicago! I love the wings, bowls, and side dishes. If your looking for a twist to the classic korean style this is the place. I recommend the Baby Buddha Bowl with added beef. Delicious!"
"For how easy and close it is, Crisp has made my ""regulars"" list. This is the THE place to get Korean style fried CHAAckkenn. I come here to rage on chick on the reg, its pretty chall. Thinking about it now, I'm going to go get a 6 piece. The bowls, burrito, and sandwich are ok but don't waste your time, get the fried chicken or go home."
"Went on the recommendation of one of their employees and got a whole chicken, 1/2 Seoul Sassy, 1/2 BBQ.  Both were excellent.  I love spicy, so I found myself eating more of the BBQ than the Seoul Sassy.  However, both were flavorful and addictive.  Craving Crisp right now, in fact. Next time, I will get the wings, based on other reviews."
"Just cause I'm born and raised in Chi and considered a ""twinkie"" does not mean I don't know my Korean food! I LOVE my Korean food and when I went to Crisp today, I was so excited to try it. When I went in around 12:30PM it was semi-crowded and we were able to find seats. I was kinda surprised at how small the place was but I guess the smaller, the homier? We ordered our food from the front and the guy seemed friendly and also recommended the popular dishes to us since we were new. We ended up getting the Baby Buddha, Seoul Steak Bowl, and the 5 piece chicken wings with two flavors (Seoul Sassy & Crisp BBQ). The Baby Buddha is bimbimbop aka rice bowl with tons of veggies such as carrots, spinach, meat, and a egg. It was not warm as I liked it to be but it was delicious and yummy. It tasted like how a bimbimbop should be. My boyfriend's dish Seoul Steak Bowl was OK, just a rice bowl with tons of bulgogi. The chicken wings were really flavorful, the my favorite sauce was the Seoul Sassy that was spicy and so saucy! The Crisp BBQ reminded me of childhood wings I had and it brought back memories.These chicken wings def kick butt. Next time I go, I will only get the wings and skip out on the bimbimbops."
"For months now I've found myself salivating in our home office, as the smell of fried chicken wafts in through the window and fills my apartment with deliciousness. For those of you who know well the smell I speak of, you know there's nothing like it in all world. Even if I had just eaten an enormous dinner, I'd smell the eu de crispyness and say to my other half, ""Man, we've really got to go to that chicken place. It smells SO GOOD"". So, finally we made our trek over their last week. I decided it was the perfect opportunity to partake in fried goodness, as I needed to 'lay a foundation' pre-Nisei drinking or, as the boyfriend calls it, 'harden my arteries'. I thought I was very clever about the whole thing and was super excited to dine.....and totally missed the fact that we were both in blazing white shirts. Not exactly the wardrobe choice for barbecue fans the world over. Not so much.Luckily, I decided to play it safe and just get their 'plain jane' wings with the sauces on the side. My shirt survived unscathed. Mike got the 1/2 barbecue chicken. Everything tasted good, but we both found the meat to be a little lacking. Now, this may be due to the fact that, unlike KFC, Crisp uses real animals when making their food and not genetic-mutant-headless-full o' meat-freak birds, but worth mentioning anyway. I liked the communal seating, how everything was super clean, the choice of beverages, and the BYOB option. The owner at the counter was extremely friendly and nice, and offered to show us some of the orders coming out so that we could gauge what size/ type of item we should get. He also followed up and made sure to ask us what we thought of everything, which I really appreciate. The next time I go back, I'm going to try something a little bit more adventurous and bring some beer or wine to enjoy.Of course, it's worth noting that Mike's white linen shirt did in fact die a sudden, messy, and bloody (looking) death. All down the front of him. It was terrible. We dropped the shirt off at the cleaners yesterday, with Mike explaining it as a ""possible gone-er"" to the nice little lady behind the counter. Lesson learned- wear something you're wiling to stain and/or throw out, or big up and wear a bib!--------------------------------------------------­---------------------------------------------*update 5/8/2008*Mike's shirt is confirmed dead. Got it back from the cleaner's and, well, it's done for. Thanks for your letters of support and concern in this trying time."
"I had chicken wings from them for three days straight. I love the Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy chicken wings. Don't forget to get extra sides of  ""Alison's Atomic Sauce"" - so spicy and tangy. Crisp has the best wings I've ever had. The Buddha bowls are also great!"
"I had been heard about the Korean-style BBQ wings and decided to come here on an absolutely miserable Sunday afternoon. The wings were the perfect tonic for my crummy day. The BBQ style wings came five in an order (that's 5 entire wings, not 5 pieces) and were plump and juicy. They were coated with a thin but deliciously sticky and messy sauce that was sweet and spicy, and they were sprinkled with a few sesame seeds. There are other flavors and other dishes, but the wings did it for me. The breaded mushrooms I ordered were a bit too much for me, and I considered them to be interrupting my enjoyment of the wings. Most of the seating in Crisp has no backs so this is not the place to linger, but the wings are so good that you'll be licking your fingers."
"i give this place a 3-star jus cuz ive only had the wings and the buddha bowl...the bowl...mmm not so much, ive had better..i mean come on, im korean.the wings? can we say jumbo wumbo?..holy canoli are they huge! delicious too! not a fan of the crisp bbq but i mos def recommend the seoul sassy! i ate so much, i couldnt move :Plookin for a wing place with some sass? come here! :)"
"So I gave Crisp another try--AT Crisp.  I decided to bump it up to 4 stars, as my Buddah Bowl was mega delicious.  I can only imagine how good the wings and apps would be fresh out of the fryer.  If you want something different, come to Crisp (especially if you just get done watching an episode of Anthony Bourdain and you are craving a big bowl of Asian deliciousness)."
"Chicken wings are great- the seoul sassy sauce or something like that. Also had the beef bowl, love Bulgogi. And then a while i think i tried the burrito-bulgogi fusion, that was only okay, would much rather just have the beef bowl. Good place nonetheless, will be returning."
Love love love. Now I don't have to go all the way to Niles for good Korean food! I can't wait to come back and try the chicken. Pro tip: don't be afraid to try the sauce in the yellow squeezey bottle. It's wonderful! I just wish I lived closer so I could get this delivered every day.
I've been here a few times and recently found myself wondering why I don't come here more often.  The chicken is delicious.  The wings are meaty and every sauce I've ever had here is fantastic.  I really want to try the bowls next time I go.  So if you are looking for some really tasty chicken with a twist and then you need to go here.  Service is fast and friendly and it's BYOB.
"Best. Fried. Chicken. Ever. Maybe I just don't have enough exposure to Korean fried chicken but one bite in I was already planning a return trip. I had the world's best chicken in sandwich form, with the Seoul Sassy sauce (also amazing). Only four stars because the side I got was average (some sort of sauteed vegetable mix that was a little mushy -- might be better eaten in than carried out) AND also a warning that if you order a sandwich that says it comes with Mayo they really heap it on there. Next time I'll be sure to tell them easy on the mayo and try a different side."
"I was introduced to this place recently and have been back twice in the last month.  Sooooo good, and the Bad Boy Buddha bowl (may favorite) includes a wonderful mix of vegetables.  You cannot go wrong with the organic brown rice either (minimal extra charge).  This food fills you up!  Chicken is good too, if you don't mind getting your fingers a little messy.The staff here are super-friendly and pleasantly chat with you.  They deliver, but the atmosphere and large bench-style tables make it worthwhile to dine in."
"I hardly ever eat wings, and even though Crisp was good enough to make me reconsider, every other wing place would just pale in comparison.  So, I think I'll be coming to Crisp for all of my wing needs.  I had an amazing Seoul steak bowl, then shared HUGE wings with a friend, and we both could not have been happier.  The best part? I'll be moving much closer to this neighborhood in a few weeks and will be returning regularly! Yay!"
"What a nice, new place to get fast eats!I believe they made this sandwich for me.  Chicken, bleu cheese crumbles, bacon, spinach.... My god, the only thing missing is.... nope, nothing missing.  Tastiness.  Yes, I was a bit chicken (ha ha) for not getting something a bit more saucier.  I'll just have to stop by again!  (Oh yeah, and not write my reviews after a bottle of wine.)The boy got some sort of sandwich that was like a teriyaki Philly cheesesteak.  Not my cup o' tea, but he loved it.Oh yes, and there were comments about the fries here.  I really liked them.  There wasn't too much salt on them (a la McDonalds) or too soggy (like most diners).I will DEFINITELY be back, especially after reading all the stuff about the Seoul Sassy."
"Five stars for a ""Korean"" place that serves hot wings but no booze?  Yep, that's right.  The formula is actually quite simple:Tasty Food + Hefty Portions + Low Prices + Friendly Service = 5 StarsIt's amazing more restaurants don't know how to pull off this combo.  But Crisp does it with flying colors.  I had dinner there with a group of friends last night and the consensus around the table was that the place serves some damn good chicken.  Some things to note if it's your first time there:- If you're in the mood for their fried chicken, I would recommend ordering a whole chicken and doing a half-and-half.  I got the Seoul Sassy and the BBQ and they're both really good.  Just be prepared to take some of it home because you get a mess load of chicken.- When you order a whole chicken, you can get a 1 lb portion of the sides for the cost of a 1/2 pound.  Such a great deal!  I ordered the People's Choice Green Awards, which were basically all of the veggies that come with a Bi Bim Bop.  Good choice in case you're looking to balance out all the fried goodness that is your chicken.  But my friend got the fried mushrooms and they were fantastic as well (especially with the spicy mayo dipping sauce).- If you're not in the mood for chicken, Crisp also has sandwiches, burritos, rice dishes and salads.  While I'm sure they're good, I probably would just order more chicken the next time I go back.- I believe Crisp is booze-free, which means you can't order any alcohol there nor can you bring any in.  But they do have an assortment of beverages, including some Asian drinks.  Go for the barley tea -- it contrasts well with the tanginess of the chicken.- Speaking of little things -- Crisp has these nifty paper towel dispensers on each table.  They're the type where there's tension built in that allows you to rip off a sheet with one hand, thus not contaminating the roll with your other greased up hand.  So handy and efficient!- The place is cash only for now but I believe they'll be accepting credit cards very very soon.- The owner (I think), Doug, is a really friendly guy who really makes an effort with his customers.  I really appreciate it when an owner really takes an interest in making sure that you enjoy your meal.  As cliched as it sounds, it truly is the little things that count.Go check out Crisp!  You won't regret it!"
"somewhere behind this tiny storefront on broadway, there must be an enormous coop of 4 feet tall chickens.  it must be some korean grandmother's job to feed the chickens corn and protein powder -- every hour on the hour.  honestly, i can think of no other feasible explanation as to how the chicken wings get so large.  the wings are easily twice as big as average -- plus, they aren't breaded so the size isn't deceiving!  the seoul sassy sauce is really key though.  i paced the consumption of my chicken as to absorb every last bit of the sauce in, on, and around the general vicinity of the tray.  great neighborhood place, will definitely try to be back."
"Yummy to my lil tummy!!! The chicken wings are awesome w/ both sauces. Buddha bowls are tasty too. Absolutely no complaints here...oh maybe just one...wish you were located in the south loop...on second thought...my waistline and hips say NO. ;0)"""
"The place is small and has communal tables.  We didnt have to wait.  My bf ordered the buddha bowl and I ordered the chicken bowl.  His was ok but mine was way too sugary.  We replaced the white to brown rice and that was great but when they poured the sugary sauce in my chicken bowl, I just couldnt eat it.  I guess there are other things that are fine to order at this place like the wings and burrito but I will not be back. I like Korean food but this place is just fast food quality so dont expect good korean quality food.  If you like cheap fast food and are not picky with food then this is your place.  If you are picky and are even semi healthy then go past it."
"i was really excited to finally try crisp yesterday after hearing so much about it on yelp. i ordered the original bad boy buddha bowl & the bf ordered some chicken tenders w the seoul sassy sauce & an order of beef bulgogi. i guess i didn't take a good look at the menu when i first ordered because i didn't realize that the buddha bowl only came w/ veggies, i went to order a side of beef & the guy was nice enough to just give it to me. once i added the beef to the buddha bowl i was genuinely excited to devour this dish..the veggies were very tasty & the beef was really flavorful. it was a pretty big portion that i had enough to take home for leftovers. the bf's order was really good too, the chicken was awesome & i really liked the seoul sassy sauce. the beef bulogi was a pretty big portion too & came w/ a generous side of fries. i also like the wide selection of beverages they have here..they even had san pelligrino limonata..my fav!!! crisp is a casual place w/ great food for a good price..definitely will be coming back!! (especially bc i wanna try the bulgogi burrito!)"
"Huge fan. The Korean BBQ and Soul Sassy are really different and delicious.Love the Baby Buddha Bowl (rice with marinated veggies) with beef. Skip the red sauce it comes with and ask for Amy's Atomic. It's spicy and really yum on top of the rice bowl.If you order fries with anything, they are large enough for two people, at least.The service is fantastic. The people who work here are always friendly, nice, and do everything possible to accommodate special requests. I pick up from here all the time and the food is always read in five minutes!"
The best fried chicken ever! Crisp (hence the name of the place) and bursting with flavor! I have found my favorite wing place in Chicago! Yippee! One other cool thing is that you get to pick any drink from the cooler -- they are all the same price.
"I kept hearing about how wonderful the wings at Crisp were.  I finally decided to find out for myself and was very impressed.  Had the Seoul Sassy sauce per yelp's recommendation and was blown away.  Also, I'm a big guy, and 5 wings were plenty for not a lot of cash.  Next time I need a quick awesome meal in lakeview, Crisp FTW."
"Food is really good here.  We came expecting mediocrity, but definitely got more than we bargained on.  Tasty, well seasoned and prepared and a very efficient operation.  Good choice for casual food and better than fast food for sure."
Really liked the wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce
The wings are huge.....and the seoul sassy sauce amazing. The service is awesome....only issue I have ever had is having to continue to call back several times before being able to place an order.....to me that is a good sign. I have recommended this place to several people and they have all had great reviews as well. It might be a little on the pricey side....but it is worth it.
"A bunch of Yelpers inspired by Rocky's ROTD decided to put this place though the paces tonight.  I thought about ordering the Seoul Sassy in honor of my birthplace but I ended up ordering the ""suicide"" Bud's Buffalo wings as I have a reputation to maintain (GO HOT HEADS!).  When I asked the guy taking my order how hot the ""insane"" was, he took a deep breath and looked me dead in my eye and said ""they're HOT"".  Some of my crew ordered the ""spicy"" and it looked and smelled good so I knew I was on the right track.The ""suicide"" wings looked like the ""suicide"" wings at Buffalo Joes in that they were topped w/ a healthy portion of sauce and jalapenos on top of the wings.  The ""suicide"", sadly, were not hot.  As a matter of fact, they weren't even spicy.Hot Heads: 1Crisp: 0Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals so that was a good sign.  I recommend you reading the other reviews if you want a non Hot Head take on the place.  If you're into spicy meals, you're better off looking elsewhere for your fiery delights.+1 for having chilled Bacchus D available."
"I am deathly afraid of spicy food. I break out in the sweats even before I take a bite. I went here with a bunch of Yelpers to check this new place out. I started reviewing the menu days in advance to try to decide what I wanted to get.  When I finally arrived I finally turned to a pussy and ordered the plain jane fried chicken.The chicken was solid. It wasn't the greatest that I had, but it was above average. From hearing what others were saying, I probably could have taken the next step up in sauce without my spice-o-phobia kicking in.  We ordered a side of mushrooms and what can i say, they were fried mushrooms. What I really enjoyed were the smashed potatoes. They serve them chilled which originally stuck me as odd, but when I tried them, I was thoroughly impressed. I am not sure what they put in them but they were delicious, even served chilled. I have a feeling that the owner was the guy taking the orders. He was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I was also impressed that he warned us about the potatoes. He checked up on us several times and made sure we were doing OK. He really went out of his way to be sure we were enjoying ourselves.He even changed the radio station when he overheard us saying what a crappy song was playing.  I sure hope they continue this habit of good service."
Friendly and delicious.
"Crisp automatically gets 5-stars because of the size of their water cups! I am a very thirsty person, and nothing annoys me more than when restaurants give you those small plastic cups that you keep having to refill.  These cups are like those huge 32 oz cups you get at the drink fountain at a gas station.  But the food! The food is simple but oh-so-flavorful.  I had the buddha bowl and the seoul sassy fried chicken.  I had dinner with a friend I haven't seen in a while, and there were moments where we fell silent because we were busy savoring our food! I would go as far as saying that I prefer Crisp over Great Seas chicken wings because Crisp isn't completely overwhelmed with sauce like Great Seas.  Extra bonus because Crisp is A LOT closer.If I had it my way, I'd eat Crisp at least 4 times a week. i do, after all,  have my health and wallet to worry about!"
"My husband has a slight accent and somehow they mistook 20 wings for 20 sides of Blue cheese! Unfortunately, we ended up with 5 wings and 20 sides of blue cheese. We called back several times and between holding for a manager and the woman who helped us....they were ""willing"" to let us have 15 wings....if we paid for them....after paying $10 in a SIDE of blue cheese. Even after I tried to talk to them.....they still messed it up. Wow..........thanks for charging me $10 in sauce!"
"A little salty, bit pretty yummy.  I'd go back for sure."
"Definitely not traditional Korean or Asian, but delicious flavors and juicy chicken. The only place that has better crispy, Asian style fried chicken is Chicago Kalbi. They have a fried chicken on their appetizer menu that blows Crisp's chicken out of the water!"
Delicious
"I've only had the wings here, but they were as good as any ones I have had before. I had the 5 piece wings and it was a good size meal. The wings were giant ,meaty and moist.  The skin was crispy and the Korean style sauce was tangy and not too sweet. I'm a little ashamed to say that I gnawed on the little wing tip pieces for a little extra sauce and crispy skin. The only drawback to this place is limited seating and it gets very crowded. The fries looked very average and the Buddha bowls seemed very popular."
"I  WANT  to get really fat here.  Starting yesterday.No disappointment.  Over-the-top customer service perfection: Counter guy was welcoming, informative, full of suggestions and willing to offer to true meal deal.  Outstanding value.THIS WAS A MESSY DATE and also incredibly SEXY.  Finger licking fantasia!The place is small, but on this particular rainy chilly day, we had a huge table and big roll of paper towels all to ourselves.  It was cozy inside and definitely great for sipping a soda pre-bites and watching umbrella-covered passersby dashing about outside.Boy and I ordered a BabyBuddha with beef to split while waiting on our fried chicken.  Took 3 minutes to prepare.  Very fresh, great spicy sauce on side.  YUM- little pickles and sesame oil.  Chopstick fun!Based upon recommendation, we ordered the whole chicken half-n-half.  Seoul Sassy and Korean Crisp BBQ.  Extra sauce samples on side, YO!  (No sides needed after Budda as an appetizer.)Both silly and dizzying-The plate was glistening with gooooo and calling out our names like...  ""Bastian.  Call my name.  Bastian, please!  Save us!""  to which Bastian or -Chicken- replies, ""All right! I'll do it! I'll save you! I will do what I dream!""  Never Ending Story style.  It's true.Ladies, be ready to ruin a cheap manicure for this food.  No looking back.  Fingers in:  fancy and feelin' sticky-delicious.NOTE: I was certainly the ONLY chick getting in on this feast.  BS!  Boys abound , but ladies, chow with NO SHAME here.  Suck in the gut some other time.  Here, a little indulgence goes a long way toward your overall personal happiness and ... professional success?  Maybe.Fresh-scented moist towelettes are on the house and by the fistful.  (Essential for the HOT hand-holding to follow.)  Be sure to stop by Intelligensia down the block for some shots of ESPRESSO/caffeine to get you back on track and ready to trek along to wreck records at the nearby Reckless Records.Happy bellies and satisfied smiles, hungry hounds UNITE.A sickeningly addictive new find.  Korean Fried Chicken.  Thighs and breasts. Wings and things.  INDULGE."
"The fried chicken is delish! The korean bbq sauce is addictive and sweat-inducing. It might be a little pricier than fast food chicken, but hey, you get what you pay for. Considering the quality of the food, this place is a bargain.And confirming what everyone else here has said about how nice the owner is (and the other employees). It's clear this restaurant is knocking themselves out to get it right. I wonder if they could be BYO? Having a cold beer with the Wacky Wings would be tops. It's the only thing missing."
"Crisp. Great wings, relaxed atmosphere, and to die for Seoul Sassy sauce. The only negative thing about this place is when you walk in and get a to-go order there is no where for you to stand. Everywhere you walk you get in someone's way. The foodie special sandwich is also a real winner. I have not tried their bowls yet because I am hooked on the wings. Very relaxed staff that works there."
"When I'm not daydreaming of Bradley Cooper, I've actually caught myself daydreaming about these wings.  It was a fall afternoon the first time I tried these and I was coming home from a Bears game when I had a craving for wings. Hot and spicy wings. Usually I am into the extra-hot-burn-your-mouth-and-other-parts-of-your-­body hot sauce, but these are different and so flavorful.  They are also the biggest wings that I have seen.  Try the Seoul Sassy flavor.  I also tried the Baby Buddha Bowl and it was just OK.  I won't be ordering that again, but the wings??  Phenomenal."
Their seoul sassy chicken wings are SOOO BOMBBB!
If you've never been to Crisp yet you need to haul your asses there ASAP!! Some of the best tasting wings around. Get the Sassy Seoul and you'll be sucking your fingers well after you are done eating. They got big juicy wangs that will fill you up right. Get there early before the dinner rush otherwise you'll be waiting in a long line with no where to sit. That's why I only gave it 4 stars because of the lack of seats. Service is fast and very friendly as well.  Giddy up!
"Very nice. The bi-bim-bap (Original Bad Buddha Bowl) renditions were good, but the crispy chickens were better. Portions are pretty darn big, so I recommend sharing for some people.Went with my sister and we probably would have been better off sharing one serving of 5-crispy chickens with the seoul sauce and one order of the original buddha bowl.Not greasy and quick service. If I lived closer by, I'd probably hit this up more frequently."
Unfortunately I can't eat spicy things and the plain fried chicken didn't look so appetizing to me so I went ahead and ordered a salad and some fries.  The salad dressing is homemade dressing with a little zing and it was actually really good.  My fries came out kind of cold and that was the reason I didn't get the smashed tators cause they were cold.  But all in all my meal was good.  On that note I did sample everyone elses foods so that I could write an accurate review.  The coleslaw was some kind of ground up mess.  It had flavor and seemed pretty decent but it was the consistency of baby food.  Yuck!  The cold smashed tators were actually really good!  And I have a feeling that if you warmed them they would be sinfully good!  I smelled everyone's chicken.  Yes that's right smelled!  I can tell if I can eat something spicy by the smell and none of it I could eat!  It was all way too spicy for me and didn't even smell good but it did look good and everyone seemed to be enjoying.Service was nice and helpful but at the same time I thought a little over bearing. I was one of the first people to order and when I was standing there with my friend she ordered ranch to go with her wings and I thought the man taking our order was gonna die.  In the end he won and talked her out of the ranch and I don't think she needed it but still it was a 5 minute conversation on to ranch or not to ranch.I wish I liked this place more but I think what I really liked about it was the company and not the food.
"The Garlic Wings are heavenlyyy and it's not just those tiny wings, it's pretty big. Luv them luv them, also get tasty side dishes, like the fried mushroom balls, onion rings and fries. I was curious of the Bim bim Bap so we ordered the Big Buddha Bowl and this is one of the reason I didn't give full 5 stars cause the Bimbimbap is so cold :(, I know they didn't use hotpot, but if they could just make the beef and the rice hot, I think the overall would definitely taste sooooooooooooo much better... Service is awesome, the waiter and owner are so friendly, great price 2. Plus one thing that made me feel even better, I saw the sticker that this resto has been yelped!!! :P"
"This is my new place in the city to get get great Bi Bim Bop!!! Surprisingly it now resides in the same address as my old favorite that went out of business (Rice Box) On top of the Bi Bim Bop, they have amazing Funke Chicken. We ordered the Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy. Both tasted amazing, the former being spicy and sweet, the latter being an excellent sweet soy flavoring. We also had the Baby Buddha which is what they call Bi Bim Bop. I'll definitely be coming back here frequently. The prices were great and the staff was super friendly in describing the dishes. They currently don't accept credit card but they'll be changing that shortly."
"When the guy at the counter changes the radio station because he overhears that someone doesn't like the song -- you know you're in a people-pleasing kind of joint. And that, is most definitely what Crisp is.Eight of us flooded the joint, among the other people in the restaurant, scouring the menus to find the perfect fried chicken option. George and I noticed as we approached the counter that the gigantic flat screen TV up front was listing meal options, so we immediately opted for the meal deals, but look quick! For the picture changes pretty rapidly. Feeling like a professional, I walked up to the counter and ordered the Funke #2 (or was it 3) -- Five Chicken Wings (your choice of flavor/sauce) with the house-made potato salad and coleslaw. I opted for the Buffalo Bud's because I'm a whore for Buffalo-style chicken, and I got it ""spicy"" -- the middle option of the spicy scale at Crisp. The guy at the counter suggested I order the fries, because the potato salad is COLD, so I agreed and got the fries. The food came out incredibly fast, and as Mike looked on, I bit into the chicken wing. It was spicy, more spicy than I was expecting, but interestingly, the spice wore off. Each wing after that that I ate just wasn't as spicy as that first one -- did I adjust? Was it just the initial shock of spice? Either way, after that, it just wasn't the same. As oft-readers of Chavi know, I'm also a whore for coleslaw, and I usually gauge a restaurant by how well they can make a batch of coleslaw. I was expecting some alternate type of slaw, perhaps with an Asian flare or something, so when I got the coleslaw -- which, mind you, is completely pureed -- I was pretty disappointed. It had a good taste, it was your typical, basic coleslaw, but the lack of creativity and the fact that it was PUREED completely grossed me out. Coleslaw is meant to have a certain texture, and that is not one of puree. This, folks, is the result of a loss of a half star. As far as the fries, well, they were your basic, greasy stringy fries. Nothing special, nothing unique. I know it's an Asian fried chicken joint, but I was expecting a dash of something. This, of course, is the result of the loss of another half star. So I'm dishing out four stars, because the chicken -- the tour de force -- was really amazing, spicy or not. The joint is clean and crisp (har har har) and the staff was super friendly and amusing, not to mention that they listen to their customer's every want and need. And the fact that the guy at the counter told one of our gals that he couldn't -- in good conscious give her ranch with her chicken wings -- is a good man in my book. So head to crisp and getcher cluck on!"
Solids food but pricey for what you get.  It's also not very health and the seating area sucks.....
"This place is great for the price, totally unpretentious and decidedly delicious. They definitely live up to the hype as far as their chicken goes, but the Buddha bowl was too cold, which is why they lost a star. Otherwise it's a definite win, as long as you don't mind getting your hands dirty."
Good and quick Korean. Had the veggie Budda Bowl (aka: Bi Bim Bop) was very large and tasty for the price. My friend had Chicken wings which he loved. Would go again if I am in the area. Wish they delivered a bit farther west and north.
"Fried chicken isn't really something I'm gonna eat on a regular basis, but I give major kudos to this place for creating a niche and doing it really well. 1) Don't go to this place if you have to, say, go try on clothes afterwards. The minute you walk in, you are saturated with the smell of the sauces, and it's gonna take a while for that to wear off. 2) The space is small but cute, with bright walls and communal tables. At 2pm on a Saturday, it was busy but we had no problem getting a seat.3) The owners and staff are really helpful. Walking by the other day we stopped to look at a menu. A worker quickly came out with a to-go menu and let us know they also deliver. When we ate there our total was $8.12. We gave the cashier $10 and he gave us $2 even back (which of course we put in the tip jar). They now take credit cards. 4) It's cheaper to get fries and a drink added then to just order a side of fries. And they have diet root beer - bonus!5) The food itself is damn tasty. We shared the Seoul Sassy sandwhich. The sauce was excellent, though I'd ask for no cheese next time (it didn't add anything to the flavor). At $8 for sandwich, fries and drink, it's a quality, tasty and inexpensive meal."
"I've been here twice.  Both times, the so called ""Buddah Bowl""  (aka Bibimbap to most people) was pretty yummy.  Good and plentiful ingredients, and they veggies taste pretty fresh.  The bulgoki (beef) is marinated pretty well.  I suggest it!As far as the chicken goes, if you want authentic korean fried chicken, this is not the place.  HOWEVER, if you want something that RESEMBLES authentic korean fried chicken, come one come all!I like the seoul sassy (i think it's called) chicken wings, but not the other ones.... forgot the name, but basically it's a fried chicken wing covered in Goju-jjang (hot sauce made of bean paste).   The first time I came here, the chicken wings tasted old and lost some of their crisp (ha...crisp), but the second time they were SUPER crispy and delicious, and seemed to be just made!  Anyway, if craving korean in the lincoln park/lakeview area, this place is a pretty good bet.  Seating is limited, and don't wear a white shirt... (unless you want to sport speckeled-white after memorial day)"
"So months after watching this place slowing open... I have finally tried the Crisp.I have been twice, once for the Philly Steak Sandwich and once for the Wings.  The Philly steak was definitely nothing to rave about.  The steak was great with a different sort sweet taste to it but the sandwich was all bread and barely enough meat to taste.  Also, I ordered it deluxe (cheese, mushrooms and onions) and there was a sprinkling of each.  If the sandwich got a revamp and uped the insides it would be my first choice!Now for the wings.  I got the Korean BBQ and they were SPICY but great!! The portions were huge.  I got french fries and 5pc wings and was only able to eat half the fries and two wings (and this was after a few happy hour cocktails).  Definitely a big change from my first visit.All in all, a good place for a little take out.  The owner is very friendly, the restaurant is clean and cute and best part is that it is around the corner and not some type of freaking noodle place!!PS.  It is BYOB, I saw some people enjoying a few brews with their chicken with my own two eyes!"
The sassy sauce is amazing.  I got the wings just to try (yes they were crispy) and cant wait to order a whole chicken next time.  I loved the sauce soooo much I was dipping my fries in it.  YUM!!!!!!!  Next time I will ask for a side of the sauce.  Sooo good.
"Holy giant wings, Batman!  The 5 piece Wacky Wacky Wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce (or something to that effect) were fabulous.  Everything else was just okay.  The burrito with Bulgogi was not as spectacular as I had hoped.  Kind of plain.  And really, they give you these tiny minature dipping sauce containers that are only enough for about 3 out of the entire basket of fried mushrooms. Oh well. (side note - I was actually dining with a companion, lest anyone think I always consume this much food by myself in one sitting.)   :)Note: We didn't realize it was cash-only until we tried to pay, but the guy was nice about it and we were able to leave and hit the ATM next door before running back to pay the bill.   There are still things on the menu I'd like to try, and as my friend says, you can't really rate any place definitively unless you have been there 2 or 3 times, so perhaps an edit is in the future for Crisp.  Until then, I have to stick by my 3(.5?) stars.Edit:  3/21/08 - Okay the wings alone are truly worth the trip.  I can't help it.  It's the Seoul Sassy sauce.  Plus the second time I brought beer, and that was just delightful. I'm bumping up my rating to four stars."
"Just got back from a soft opening at Crisp, which is a fusion korean restaurant, and my oh my was it good! They were testing out their fried chicken. Two kinds BBQ and Spicy. I loved both. The crust on the chicken was nice and light...not overwhelming at all. The sauce on both types was very flavorful. The spicy isn't the type of spicy where you need to be concerned if you aren't into heat. It's more of a tingly flavor. Along with our fried chicken we also received ranch dressing, celery and....korean potato salad. Woo the potato salad was yummy and a nice accompaniment to the wings.The owner was very friendly and welcoming. The restaurant itself is set up for communal seating. There are about 3 big picnic style type tables that will seat about 8 people each and then counters that line the wall and window with stool seating. I actually like the communal seating set up. We sat across from this lady that was actually the sanitation inspector for the place that came to check out the food. She was pretty interesting and we shared tips on other restaurants to try out that served spicy foods. I'm very happy that this place is finally open. Granted I still will miss Rice Box but the owner assured me that there will be some items from the Rice Box menu that will show up on Crisp's.  He said his goal is to make korean food more friendly to the masses that aren't quite used to korean cuisine. I can't wait to try out more of their menu. Look for a full opening later in the week."
Speechless...still have a chicken in my mouth.
"Finally was able to make it out to this establishment and I was not disappointed!  Seoul Sassy Wings, lived up to its name..sassy, flavorful and needed no extra dipping sauce (unless you're like my boyfriend and likes everything spicy so Sriracha it was).  The big Buddha bowl (aka Bibimbop) was good as well, but nothing out of the ordinary.  10 Seoul Sassy Wings and a Big Buddha Bowl were more than enough for 2 people and we definitely had some leftover to take home."
"You will never go wrong with Crisp.Pick one or more from these 3 favorites and you will not regret:1) Seoul Steak Bowl with their special sauce2) Crisp BBQ Chicken3) Buddha BowlThis place has amazing fast food.  Really great prices - especially their lunch specials since it's about the same portions as their dinner portion but 2/3 of the price!I'm so glad to be within a short walking distance.  Owners Howie, Doug, John are super nice and friendly."
"Crisp is a successful execution of an Asian concept - one of millions that all of us Asians have in our head that never get implemented. Doug the owner is very friendly and as Asians normally have a good understanding of each other, he directed us to some crazy awesome food. - Their chicken wings are the best in town. Like the people who also reviewed Crisp, we got a half dozen of BBQ and Seoul each, the white boy from georgia that came with me didn't complain once.- We also go their super duper meat bowl that has a name that currently eludes me. Get that if you like meat!- I want to try their korean burrito............"
"Crisp has very good food that's inexpensive to boot. The main attraction is definitely the chicken wings, which are fried to perfection and covered in various sauces. I would go for a 10 piece wing platter, this way you can sample a few flavors. The crisp BBQ and soul sassy are my favorites. They also have another Korean staple, Bi Bim Bop. The toppings and flavor are good as well in this dish.Staff has been helpful and friendly every time I've been."
I'm re-assessing my review of Crisp only because the fried chicken is only good fresh.  Don't try taking it home to eat later.  Have it at the restaruant since that's when it tastes best.  Nice big benches to dine family style.
"Amazing chicken!  It was a while ago that I was here, however, I did try two sauces which I cannot remember, but I definitely plan to return the next time I am in the neighborhood.  I used to live in the neighborhood, so it was much more convenient.  Until then,  I will hope that a Crisp opens in Bucktown/Wicker Park!"
"Neat place.  Originally heard good things about this place thru my hubby.  He is the one that found it and wanted to go so we went this past Saturday for lunch.  I usually give a place at least 3 stars if I frequent there or would frequent there again so that's why 3.  It would be a quick fix for korean fusion food.  It is not quite 100% korean food but close enough and I did say quick ..It is a unique place.  It's communal seating except a bar type seating on the side so I like the atmosphere. We got the sassy, crispy bbq, and bi bim bop.  It was enough for both of us amazingly since both of us eat a lot.  The sassy chicken was great!  I guess it's the closest to just regular fried chicken.  The crisp bbq was a bit too spicy for me but the meat was tender.  The bi bi bop was really good too.  The cucumbers in there had a fruity taste which really added a uniqueness and sweetness to the dish.  The closest food I can think of that I was reminded of when tasting the cucumbers was that korean Melona ice cream bar which I love!The cashier was nice as well.  He was very talkative to like everybody.  Service was quick too.  Parking is like impossible to find in that area even on the side residential streets..it is a busy shopping/eating area so watch out for that."
"I'm torn about writing this review.I really want my fellow Koreans to succeed, but this place really gives Korean chicken a bad, bad name.  The owners are so super nice and seem to be trying extremely hard (annoyingly hard as Nicole R mentions...).  I was so excited to hear that this place opened, but I'm afraid that it won't be in business for long...The whole point of Korean fried chicken is that the fat is rendered out of the skin (please read my Bon Chon review) and still remains very moist and super crispy.  The is was not the case with Crisp's chicken.  It was super fatty.  The skin was basically unedible, and folks, that should be the best part of Korean fried chicken.  The sauces were sooo salty on the smaller pieces and super bland on the larger pieces.  I also had a big breast chunk that was undercooked.If you want the real thing, please head to NYC, Los Angeles, or Seoul.  I'm actually embarrassed for Crisp that they're putting the ""Korean Fried Chicken"" label on their chicken.I thought that I wouldn't have to travel for Korean fried chicken (KFC) anymore, but was I wrong!  I guess if you've never had the real thing, you may actually think it is ok - ignorance is bliss!!!"
Crisp BBQ is awesome!
"I've been here twice and I'll probably go back, but I'm not in love yet with the things I've gotten.  They try and have a pretty traditional bulgogi and rice dish, and some other things made with bulgogi (e.g. a burrito) but I haven't fallen in love with any of it, and I heart bulgogi.  It's not bad, just not something too exciting.Maybe I'll try the fried chicken next."
"This place was incredible!  The food was amazing. And when i say amazing... I mean freakin amazing. I love Korean food and have had a bunch of it and of all places how does Chicago have the best Korean place ever!?!  What?!?  Awesome people work there. Awesome Bim-Bim-Bap. And amazing Korean Spiced chicken wings. So awesome in fact that is made my good buddy who has been a vegetarian for over 10 years fall off the wagon and eat some!Go now if you want awesome stuff. If you are a hater of awesome, delicious food, go eat at 7-11."
"After reading some Yelp reviews to try their wings, that's exactly what a friend and I did. We got an order with the Seoul Sassy sauce and let me just say--they were AMAZING. The wings were huge and so flavorful. I'd go back anytime, this place is great."
I just know the chicken wings... they were exquisite.
"My wife and I rarely venture out of Wicker Park, but have good eats, and we'll travel.  Ironically, we found out about Crisp through one of our vegetarian friends who live in their neighborhood.  We just got back from our second crisp dinner.  It was nice that the owner recognized us, and again complimented me on my watch.  He had me at hello :)  Anyway, I ordered the whole chicken, ""half and half"", while my wife got the bi-bim bop with bulgogi.  The chicken was crisp and juicy, and my wife just about licked her buddha bowl clean!  Unfortunately, we're leaving Chicago for work, but Crisp is one of those places that I'm sure to visit whenever I come back."
The wings with seoul sauce was yummy! However I did not like their version of bipbimbop...i got a vegetarian one and the veggies looked limp and unappetizing. I've had amazing bipbimbop before and this just didnt cut it.
"The wings are very good and service is great. I wish they have wet naps like BWW unless they started to have them now. Not only the wings are good, it's huge. If you love wings, you must try it."
"Crispy, Salty and a little Sweet. Korean BBQ I Love You!Ate there last night and was excited to learn this is now in my hood.We shared a whole chicken 1/2 Seoul Sassy & 1/2 Crisp BBQ. Both were really great. Chicken was succulent and the outside was oh so delish. The guy who started it told us that the Chicken is hormone free, fried in canola oil and 100 calories less than your usual fried chicken (not that I am counting... or maybe I should) Anyway, couldn't finish it all so he even aerated the box so the leftovers were crispy the next day and let me tell you.... they were perfectly crisp the next day. Mmmmmmm I will be back!!! Run don't walk.ps Bring cash for now... credit card machine is down for a few weeks. I hate paying 5 bucks for my money."
"Great wings - fried, saucy goodness. Really down to earth interior, think of a skateboarders hideaway"
"Yeah it's not authentic, but who can turn down a bulgogi burrito? This place is amazing! I guarantee you'll come back for more."
"Decided to go here after there were no seats available at Soupbox.  And so there was Crisp, right across the street.  From the good reviews I've read on yelp and from watching them on Metromix, I thought that it would be a good idea to try it out....and what a great idea that was.  I ordered the Chi-town Chicken burrito while my bf ordered the Seoul Sensation burrito, which came with marinated bulgogi.  Both were delicious, especially with the spicy sauce.  They have some interesting dishes here and although I have not tried the fried chicken, it looked really good.  Crisp does offer an interesting twist on Korean food, and I would love to come back again and try the other dishes."
"Delicious!If I one day opened up a little restaurant, I would hope it would be like Crisp."
"OMG DELICIOUS!I love trying new places, thanks to my travel buddy I got a reccomendation for this place over the phone in the car. I was trying to figure if I heard correctly... Korean burrito? what on earth is that?My friends and I ended up getting a buddha bowl (aka bi bim bop), chicken (seoul sassy and crisp bbq.. yumm to the latter), and a beef burrito. plenty of food to fill, the owner is super nice and chatted with us. love!and its definitely affordable for being specialty and fusion food."
This place is Okay. We walked by and decided to go in. I am not big on Fried Chicken. My friend got the Fried Chicken with the Seoul sauce. He liked it.I got the Beef and Rice bowl. It was pretty good. Definitely something different. I would recommend it if you aren't big on Fried chicken or are looking for something healthier. The price is $8-9 but the portion is huge.
"Aptly named, Crisp offers tasty Korean-style chicken and bowls. I had the half chicken with the BBQ sauce-- very flavorful and just the perfect amount of spice."
Great korean style chicken and excellent sauces. Quick for pickup but difficult to get a table on the weekend. Crisp is my go-to for football sundays and trumps any other rotisserie or fried chicken in the area. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars was because of the lack of variety. Theres really only 2 sauces besides the buffalo sauce and the sides could be better.
Chicken wings with seoul sassy sauce are so delicious!  The buddha bowl was pretty good too although I added a lot of spicy sauce to it.  I wish the seating was better so you didn't have to sit next to random people on benches but overall I'm very happy I found this place.
Someone needs to learn how to cook rice cuz it was pretty much white paste in my burrito. It was disgusting and made me wish I'd gone to the Subway next door for lunch instead. *barf* Still nice guys though.
Holy crap! Fantastic wings! I got 10 thinking no problem but wow they are big! The Seoul Sassy was really delicious. The BBQ was good as well although very hot! A little hot for me but did a good job clearing up my cold so good times. Can't wait to go back and try some of the buffalo sauce.
"I love this place. Get a whole chicken: half Seoul sassy and half Crisp style. Their buddha bowl is pretty good as well, along with their chicken strips. BYOB and be prepared to get messy!"
"Just like my roommate says, the chicken is laced with crack.  I have the fortune of literally being around the corner away from this wonder.  The chicken is definitely on the pricey side compared to other fried chicken joints (and those in Korea), but the price premium is worth it.  A half-chicken can easily feed 2-3 people.  If you order 5-piece wings, the wings are so huge that you'll feel full after 2-3 pieces.Usually, I order chicken with the bibimbap and split it with a friend.  The owners are super-friendly and will help you if you're not sure what you want to get.  The place is very small but cozy with the communal picnic tables.  They deliver as well."
"They have great wings and unique sauces. didn't like the korean bbq. The set up is cramped as most places in the City and when its busy, it is super hard to find somewhere to sit. Its a-ok for wings, wouldn't go out of my way for them, but when I am in the area, I would prompt to go to crisp for wings."
"Tong-Dak (Korean: fried chicken) is very popular anju (Korean: snack or appetizers often served in bars) in Korean bars, and a joint's reputation is often made by the strength of its offerings on these little guys. Crisp's interpretation of tong-dak is very good... almost on par with the best of them, and how they've expanded the sauces/marinades from traditional offerings (either dry or sweet-hot sauce) really takes them another notch.  ""Seoul Sassy"" is my favorite here, and I'd ask for a little side of their BBQ sauce (fairly spicy) as dipping.  My only gripe is that they have not yet perfected the art of having every piece come out to have consistent done-ness level -- I've found that the drumsticks were cooked perfect and moist, while the breast was pretty dry.The two guys (Jay at the counter, Doug mostly doing the expediting) were talkative and their banters with the customers definitely adds to 'eating out in my hood' experience, and they're very accomodating with special requests (glass of water, taste of sauce, etc.).  You can trust food coming out of the kitchen being ran by guys like this.The bowl and the wraps is... well, roughly speaking, similar to the burrito bowl and burrito deals you might be accustomed to from Chipotle, except it's Korean fillings -- can't go wrong with that!I enjoyed the communal style dining set up (big table with benches), the myriad Asian sodas and drink offerings, and playful decor -- but wasn't so hot on the 80's hair metal bands on rotation.  (Minor gripe... and let's face it -- who hasn't really had experience of following along the chorus of a Bon Jovi song or two?)Thanks, Doug and Jay!"
"Korean fried chicken?  where could you go wrong?!?!  My friend and I picked-up some take-out from Crisp last night and it was DELICIOUS.  We ordered ten wings (half Seoul Sassy and half Crisp BBQ) and half a chicken Plain Jane just to try it out.  AMAZING.  Not your usual fried chicken, there's something extra, a salty/sweet/spicy crunchy coating, perfectly cooked chicken, moist and very flavorful.  The Plain Jane might have been my favorite, followed up by the Seoul Sassy.  I also had the Baby Buddha Bowl with spinach, beansprouts, cucumbers, and bulgogi; they give you a big tub of the spicy red gojuchang to mix with, absolutely perfect. Haven't tried the rest of the items yet (they were out of smashed potatoes and the fries were meh) but I definitely will be back.  They don't deliver as of yet but are planning to in the near future and last night, the cc machine was down, so remember to bring cash!"
"Okay, who laced the wings with crack?  My roommate and I ordered often; I prefer the Seoul Sassy wings.  And my gawd, they are cracktastically delicious.  Seriously.Hot, crisp wings with a sweet soy base.  Yum.  10 pieces for $12 is more than enough to feed our apartment.  My roommate tried the Koreanified burritos and adores them; I have yet to try it.  Why?  Each time I want to, I keep remembering the wings (laced with crack), so I forget about them burritos.  One day.  I mean, the place is just four blocks from my apartment, which could be a bad thing."
"Honestly, I couldn't tell you what ""korean"" fried chicken was if one flew into me during a nice stroll in the DMZ...but this chicken rocks my world!  Seoul Sassy...oh yeah!  BBQ....lovin' the spice!  Nuff said."
"We checked this place out last week. The chicken/wings are great. Order that. This place might have the best wings I have ever had... I think the BBQ ones (not regular bbq sauce at all) were better then the Seoul Sassy everyone else seems to rave about- but I like things spicy. Avoid everything else. The bowls were gross. You can get much better ones at other Korean places. Also, would like to know if this place is BYOB. There were no signs in the window so my friend and I felt strange bringing in beer. Beer would be a nice compliment to the wings/chicken."
"Great place to eat. Not the most authentic korean restaurant, but the fried chicken is a must! Great value and quick service. Go with another person and just get the whole fried chicken with sides."
KOREAN...MEXICAN....BURRITO!!!!  I have never seen one Korean person serving or cooking anything. I know there's one hiding somewhere. How else would the meat taste so amazing?Sometimes I have dreams where I'm swimming in a vat of the sauce that they spread on those chicken wings.  I have actually seen and heard friends make foodgasm noises that would rival anything you could hear from the thin walls of a seedy motel. Highly recommended.
"Crisp is definitely one of those places I get cravings for.  Their chicken is amazing.  I've had both the Seoul Sassy and Korean BBQ.   Having me pick which one I like better would be like asking me to pick a favorite child.I had walked by this place several times before finally deciding to try it out and I'm glad I did.  Now I'm back every other week or so to get my fix.  The other stuff on the menu looks good, but I've been hesitant to try since I like the fried chicken so much."
Incredibly crispy fried chicken with great sauce.
"OK, as weird as this sounds I am actually glad that Crisp wasn't around when I lived in this neighborhood, because if I did I would probably have eaten here constantly which (while utterly delish) probably wouldn't have been great for the girlish figure. ANYWAY, Crisp is here now, and if you haven't stopped in, what are waiting for?! Think you don't ""like"" wings? Been there, done that? The Spicy BBQ will smack you upside the head with flavor and make you a convert for life. The ""Buddha Bowls"" (aka be bim bop) are also outstanding and make for a great nibble in-between orders of wings. Because you can't eat just one..."
"I wandered into this place when it first opened and chatted it up with the two owners. They were super friendly and you can sort of tell that they really wanted to do this for the love as well as being able to set their own hours!The Seoul Sassy chicken was actually a recipe from one of the owner's mom. It's delicious and is normally juicy and plump. Recently, the chicken has been a little less juicy and a little less plump. The owners used to do the chicken but now that it's become a lot more popular, I think the hired help does the chicken now.I also recommend the Baby Buddha bowl over the other bowls. You get less variety of vegetables but it's just as filling.This place has come a long way. They now take credit card and the fridge is loaded up with an assortment of drinks (including sac-sac or bon-bon!) Atmosphere is punched up from the days when this was the Rice Box. It's a lot brighter and more inviting now.I really do wish they were open later than 9pm on some evenings. I just grab takeout later than 9pm on certain weeknights!"
"All around a great place.  The location is a little small, and they're closed on Mondays, and it seems like half the city is sometimes, but they're food more than makes up for any slight inconvenience this might cause.I've had the Wings and the Strips, both with the Seoul Sassy sauce (dumb name, great taste).  The Wings were definitely better than the strips.  The skin was able to hold in more of the flavor, but for those who don't like to fight with their food, I certainly understand getting the strips.  I also rock a side of brown rice, which rounds out the flavor nicely."
"Yay for Crisp!  I've had korean fried chickens all over, and this place is pretty darn good.  Tried the seoul sassy wings and half-chicken, as well as the buddha bowl with bulgogi, all of which were well balanced - sweet, salty, and some spice.  Was curious about the rest of the menu, which included korean burritos, sandwiches, and misc. fried sides (i.e. frieds, onion rings, mushrooms (?)).  Hooray for korean cuisine's surge in popularity - i hope they open one closer to downtown."
"this place has some amazing chicken. their fry is unmatched and their sauces are perfect for everyone. they have your standard buffalo, and two other ""asian"" flavors. one of which is their bbq (mild spicy with great flavors), the other they call sassy (some delicious garlic remedy). not so much sassy as in spicy, but maybe sassy is flavor. this, i believe, is their house sauce and it is top notch for sure. when i order i usually i order nine tenders. i would like if i could do three, three, and three since all the sauces are so great. but unfortunately they limit to two. the two i chose are bbq and sassy. the only downside to this place is that they price their chicken out at steak prices. but hey, it is good!"
"Delicious food - everything on the menu is worth it. Especially enjoy the Buddha bowls. The bowls are easily 2-3 servings. Very quick, friendly service. Yes you can use credit cards - I did yesterday. Go!"
"Crisp is AWESOME! Erica helped us and was very helpful. It was only her third day on the job! I really enjoyed their chicken. It was very ""Crisp"" and tasty. I highly recommend this place. Just a heads up it is a very busy place and it might be hard to find a table that is open."
"Its ok, but VERY over priced. I don't think any of what I have tried (buddha bowl and sassy wings) are anywhere near the great, traditional Korean recipes you'll find all along Lawrence or Bryn Mawr (Korea town.) I don't plan to go back for anything else.  They take only CASH (huge inconvenience unless you want to pay an additional $3 for their ATM plus your own bank fee,) and they don't even include RICE!!!  Unbelievable.  Go instead to a ""mom & pop"" restaurant in Koreatown and try REAL Korean food, along with the included many wonderful side dishes, rice and barley tea - yes included in the price of an entree!  You are cheating yourself by eating at Crisp.  Go and get some traditional Korean food.  It is my favorite!"
"Read about Crisp on the Reader and tried it last night. Happy to say that it was delicious! Plus Korean chicken joint right in my neighborhood? Even better.Ordered Crsip BBQ chicken, and Seoul Sassy chicken, the spinach salad and one of the 'buds'. Their names of the dishes are kind of confusing, like... what the hell is 'buds'?! (They're dumplings). Not really sure where they got ideas to name their dishes, but non the less everything we ordered was good. Crisp BBQ chicken is spicy and sweet. Probably closest to a typical Korean flavor, the sauce has 'go-chu-jang' which is the korean spicy sauce. I think the sauce was made with go-chu-jang and honey. Seoul Sassy was very sweet. Think of any teriyaki flavored chicken wings you've had in the past. I wouldn't recommend ordering a whole chicken of one flavor. Go half and try a couple different flavors. The best part, however, is the skin! My god is it crispy. I was biting off every possible little piece of skin attached to the bone. None of the grease, and all of crispiness. The Buds are good as well, definitely one of the better dumplings out there. The sauce that comes with is slightly sweet and different. Salad was... eh. okay. they cook the mushroom a bit with sesame oil so that adds a nice aroma and flavor. Korean style fried chicken, when done right, is the best thing ever. It's never fatty, super crispy, and seasoned just right. Unfortunately, Crisp isn't it. For those who are familiar with Korean style chicken, you won't get it at Crisp. BUT Crisp is definitely good, so it's worth a try. Bottom line, their chicken reminded me of Harold's, if Harold's was sauced. That's a good thing."
"Huge fan of everything I've had here. It usually gets quite crowded, but considering I always get take out I don't really consider this a problem. Regardless, the food should be the star of a small shop like this one, and the food certainly is the star here."
The chicken wings here are goood! but trying to find parking sucked. Seating was kinda tight.
"So... Korean in Lakeview, okay sounds good, wait, its kind of trendy?  It's run by a bunch of white people?  What the hell is going on here?  Let me just say it was all a little confusing for me but god damn that shit is good!!  The seoul sassy wings are out of this world as I'm sure plenty of the more food detailed reviews would let you know right off.  Perfect mix of sweet and salty and crispy fried goodness but with really quality meaty chicken. The buffalo wings were also good but go with at least a 2:1 ratio of seoul...  I can't wait to get back and try the bowls!"
I visit there 3 times a month or even more often than that. It is more like hip restaurant with self service for me.  It is not a real authentic Korean rice bowl with sizzling plat but the taste is great!!! Staff is very friendly and cozy atmosphere while I am having food every time.  Music helps a lot tooo...Awsome place!! It is packed with people around late afternoon or early evening.
"I don't want to repeat all the good things everyone has said here - they are all true.  Wonderfully delicious chicken or wings that are highly, highly addictive - be warned.  And the beef bowls are incredibly good as well.  I so want to give this place 5 stars - but it is fast food with communal tables so I have to hold off on that 5th star until they open a store up in the Andersonville area or expand their operations.  Enjoy - it is really, really good !"
Best wings I have ever had! Forget about wingstop or buffalo wild wings. Seoul sassy and bbq wings were to die for! Highly recommended.
"Crisp gave us a great lunch in the middle of the day!Small order of Seoul-Sassy Chicken-- $9.00Mini-Buddha Bowl-- $6.00Two cokes-- $4.00The chicken was by far the star of the meal. It was sweet, sticky, mildly spicy and very, very crispy. The Buddha bowl was nice, and the service very prompt. Plus if you're lucky there will be an interesting conversation happening next to you at the communal tables.If you're looking for a totally sweet, cheap and casual meal, crisp is totally worth your time."
"I have been going to Crisp since this past summer when I was wooed in by the sign out in front advertising Fuhnke chicken and Korean burritos.  6 months later and I still try to go once a week.My favorite is going at lunch for the lunch special Steak Bowl, just the Korean style beef, green onions, rice, and the Allison's hot sauce (a cream based spicy creation) and a drink for $7 or so.  Best when you eat it there and its hot but still good taking it to go as well.I also enjoy their fried chicken, usually the half-chicken is enough for a meal, or the lunch special wings and fries.  I prefer the Crisp BBQ sauce (seems based on the red bibimbop sauce) but the Seoul Sassy has a much more Asian feel and is still good.My other staple is the Original Bad Boy Buddha Bowl - the Bibimbop with a bunch of veggies and a fried egg, paying extra for beef and organic brown rice.  It's a little filling, but oh so good.You can find pop by the can in the fridge and also upgrade for another $1 for Vitamin water or some fancier drinks.  I'll stick with the Diet Dr. Pepper.  Love it."
"Wow.  This place is amazing.  My 4 stars is based on one dine-in experience and one delivery.My gf and I ordered a whole Seoul Sassy fried chicken.  I dream about this dish.  The flavors are powerful but balanced.  The crispy friedness was exactly what I had been craving.  I'm a fried chicken lover, and this is my all-time favorite.  If I were rating on this dish alone, it would be an enthusiastic 5.As far as the dining experience goes, be prepared that this is a fast food joint.  There are shared tables, which are wide, and the kitchen is a bit noisy.  Hence, it was difficult for me to hear my friend who was sitting across from me.  I do not fault the restaurant for this at all.  I'm just putting it out there in case you have other expectations.The four stars that I gave really reflect my experience with delivery and the Buddha Bowl.  I love bibimbop, but this dish lacked cohesion.  I was disappointed, but am willing to consider that something was lost due to the time for delivery."
"I am a fan.  The food is fresh, good, and quick.  Eating in is fine if you are in a rush or not looking to linger.  There is zero ambiance and someone may start staring you down for your table.  But otherwise, highly recommended."
"Please please open a place closer to Skokie or deliver out here, it sucks that I no longer work across the stress...those sassy wings remind me of some wings I had in Portland from a place called Pok Pok, a thai street food concept..which means some of the best wings I have ever had, damn crack wings..."
Yeah really only thing good here is the foodie chicken sandwich.  Also the chicken is really good.  All the other stuff. blah.
Crisp is a good spot! I never order cause my friends do it for me but everything's always good. The only negative is that it's really small.
"This place provides a unique spin on korean food which was really cool to see and taste.  The Seoul Sassy chicken is excellent.  It was fresh, very crispy, and the flavor was awesome.  The same goes for the Crisp chicken which has a spicy/sweet flavor.  Having gone with a group of friends, we also tried Bad Boy Buddha, which is basically a Bi-Bim-Bap, which was pretty tasty as well, and came in a decent sized portion.  Lastly , I tried the Seoul Sensation burrito.  The bul-go-gi had an authentic and good tasting marinade and made my stomach happy.All in all, a neat place, with a good variety of food.  The setting is very informal and the owner was very nice.  I'd like to go back and taste some other dishes.  for now its cash only, but worth it!!!"
The Seoul Sassy Chicken from Crisp has no rival.  Enjoy!
"How have I missed reviewing Crisp until now? I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said, but if you've got an urge for chicken this should be the first place in the city you head. If you've got some room left after their delicious Seoul Sassy or Crisp BBQ chicken you NEED to try a Buddah Bowl. The medium sized one is my personal favorite. It'll last for 2 meals, and they'll both be so good you want to turn around and go right back to Crisp for another one. The owner, Doug, is super-friendly and tries to greet customers by name. It must be hard, as lately the place is always packed. The food hasn't suffered a bit though. Every bite is still as delicious as the first bite I had about 6 months ago.The best news of all, is that Crisp now delivers! Huzzah! I can't even begin to put into words how happy this makes me, or how much money this is going to cost me. :)  One word of advice though - I tried to call last night to place an order before pick up and I couldn't get through. When I got there and mentioned it to Doug he said that their phone number is weird and they sometimes have problems - especially if you're calling from a number outside of 773. If you don't get through, or get a weird machine, just try back in 5-10 minutes. I don't understand it, but I really don't care. Crisp is totally worth a little extra effort. :)"
"The food is really good but the staff is SUPER annoying. It's a small place so when the employees are behind the counter throwing wet nap packets, yelling and talking in their outside voice, it's a downer. Several times while my friend and I were eating, we commented on how obnoxious and loud the staff was. It's too bad because I really like the food."
"This is a small restaurant in Lakeview comprised of a narrow room with limited bench seating, colorful walls and plasma tvs (random).  The staff is friendly and helped me choose a dish since I had never been there before.  Apparently there's lots of good things to eat here, according to them, but I will definitely come back to try other dishes.I had a crispy chicken sandwich topped with tomatoes, spinach leaves, bacon and bleu cheese.  It was great except the bad thing is that it was $8 and I probably could have eaten 3 of them.Side note: $10 credit card minimum so order big or get a drink."
"I haven't had a chance to try the Korean side of the menu yet, even though I love bibimbop, because the fried chicken is SO GOOD. I eat a lot of fried chicken, and this is hands down my favorite -- very light and crispy and I love the way they chop up the bigger pieces so you're never stuck with a giant hunk of meat. I like the Plain Jane and my wife loves the Seoul Sassy sauce.For sides, I really like the People's Greens, which is a selection of cold, cooked vegetables like you'd have on bibimbop. The fries are fine, but nothing to write home about. The onion rings are also good -- on the smallish and thinnish side."
"We went with the Wacky Wacky Wings (split half BBQ, half Seoul Sassy), a small order of fries, a small cole slaw, and the Not So Common Crisp sandwich.  All in all, the food was good.  Not out of my mind fantastic, but good.  The sandwich that looked small turned out to be filling, but the sliced grape tomatoes and lettuce chopped up salad-style kept falling out.  Fries were just OK - they arrived cold, but I guess that's what happens with delivery.  Cole Slaw got a funny face review from my friend.  But the wings were the saving grace - perfectly seasoned, huge, meaty, and nice and crispy.  Next time I think I'll just have to order the wings.On a sidenote, they are pretty new and it seems like they're working out their operational kinks (we got voicemail when we called to order, the guy on the phone was wrong about delivery).  Maybe we'll try them again in person vs. delivery."
"After hearing about this place for a while I decided to check it out. Great choices for vegetarians, really generous portions for a pretty good value given the location, quality, and type of food. Will definitely be revisiting this place soon."
"probably the best wings i've ever had. some might say that there's a party in your mouth. i say more like a new year's eve celebration because every bite feels like a new beginning... pls try it. lots of different flavors, but the wings are the best. also the buddha bowls are pretty rockin, but if you dont wing it, you're losing out."
"Great twist on Korean fried chicken. Had the chicken wings which were bigger than most chicken wings. DELICIOUS. The owner explained to me that they were different from traditional fried chicken wings, but it probably depends on which sauce you choose. I got the Sassy Seoul and the only thing I say is that it does get a bit heavy and not sure if I could eat more than 5 pieces. However, it was yummy in my tummy and I will definitely be coming back here while I'm in Chicago."
"I'm sorry I have to give this restaurant 3 stars and even considering bumping down to 2.5. My reasons: - Last Saturday I walked at least 2 miles to this place utterly starving to find it CLOSED at 8PM. According to an earlier review, I guess they ran out of food. Seriously? The following Saturday I decided to give it another go because of all the rave reviews I've heard. - I've had my fair share of Korean food and chicken wings of all sorts in my life time, but I'm sorry these wings weren't impressive. I had the Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy sauces. The Crisp BBQ sauce is basically the red chili paste sauce from bibimbop with some added smoky flavors. The Seoul Sassy sauce was alright - nothing crazy. I didn't appreciate the pool of frying OIL the wings were sitting in -- not appetizing. The meat on the wings was half tender and half dry/hard. Probably could be prevented if the wingette and drumette were separated before fried.- I will admit the size of these wings are fairly bigger than your typical buffalo style wings. I have left overs that I don't want to eat. - I will pass on this restaurant and stick to the authentic Korean restaurants, Thai angel wings, and Great Sea's wings (on Lawrence and my fave). btw, dol sot bibimbap is 100% better than your plain bibimbap. TRY IT+ On a positive note, the service was great here. The guys working the front of the restaurant were extremely friendly and checked on all their guests at the tables frequently. + I appreciate the efforts of this restaurant, but will not be returning."
"Had a doctor's appt not too far away, and the receptionists recommended this place saying ""it's their favorite, to die for and the sauce with the Seoul Bowl was out of this world"".  So we walked there to check it out.  The place has a pretty good sized menu, and the owner, John was way helpful with explaining the different dishes and what were the favorites.  We had the 10 wings, getting a combination of Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy, as well as the Seoul Bowl.  The wings were really good, and they are HUGE!!!!  Definitely something to share with someone.  I especially took a liking to the Seoul Sassy. The Seoul Bowl had a huge portion as well for $7.00.  We for sure have made this place a top favorite and a to-go place.  John, you are incredibly friendly and your business will soar with your customer service."
"OMG, this place makes me speechless.  Wings TDF!!!!!"
"Never really knew Koreans were known for their chicken but the wings here were quite tasty. I'd vote yes! I suppose they're better than my usual KFC buckets, more flavor and tasty! They also have the Korean rice bowls. The small size is already a pretty good size if you're looking for a good portion. If you want more, they also have the bigger bows as well. I'd go back!"
"Keeps me licking my fingers all night!  Nom nom nom.  Avoid the buddha bowl, you won't be wowed."
"Wow, this place is soooo good!  Being pretty well versed in Korean bbq, tofu stews, and fried chicken, I was a bit skeptical about this place at first.  Fusion menu's always seem to create this dichotomy between tradition (the past) and innovation (the future), often times falling flat and getting caught in the middle ground.  The beauty in Crisp's menu is the simplicity in which they offer this fusion approach.  It's progressive, fun, and accessible w/o completely distorting the tradition.  I decided to try the Seoul Sensation burrito, which has rice, onions, tomatoes, chives, corn, spicy sauce and their homemade marinated Korean beef, Bulgogi.  First off, the burrito was ENORMOUS.  I could have eaten half and been satisfied, yet it was so delicious and mouth watering that I finished the entire thing, along w/ a side of fries and a drink!!  The Bulgogi was so tender and yummy, and the corn added such a nice texture and flavor, it was a huge surprise.  Everything was fresh and full of flavor.  Next time I go back, i'm definitely trying the fried chicken and sides.  They had combo meals in the restaurant which included both and were pretty affordable.  I also can't wait to try the buddha bowl, which is essentially their version of bibimbop.  What can I say, this is such a fresh, new, and wonderful concept you must experience to believe!"
Beej+ Crisp= Bliss. My Aunt and Uncle bought the stuff home one night and I fell in love. I have never stepped inside the place myself but I hear its pretty decent. We had the Teriyaki and Seoul Style Fried Chicken and may I say bravo to the Chef. Good food good price. whats there not to love?
"My husband gives 3 stars. I would just give 2. We went during dinner time on Friday. It is so stressful. The place is small. It is hard to get a seat. The food takes a long time to be ready, given how casual they are. There are constantly dirty courier guys walk in and out for deliveries. I came from Hong Kong. I do not mind chaotic eateries, as long as the food is worth it. I don't know if the food is worth it. First of all, there is nothing Asian about the fried chicken wings. It is any American fried chicken wings with lots of sauce. My husband thinks the wings are fine, thus the 3 star, not 2. We also ordered Seoul Steak Bowl: not Asian again. The rice is a bit too dry. The meat is not fatty, i.e. not authentic. Fine, it is catering to the American taste, where people cannot take any meat with a little fat in it. I would also prefer at least some vegetable in it. Quite disappointing, given my expectation of finding something Korean in the food."
"I really, really liked the chicken here.  Two of us got a whole chicken (half sassy, half BBQ), and both of us liked different flavors better, meaning we're a perfect match for eating here.  I loved the BBQ.  I didn't think it was too spicy (just right, actually), and the chicken is so moist and delicious, along with the crunchy skin, that the flavor is just a bonus.  I bet this chicken is even good plain.  We also had the fries, which, gotta be honest, were pretty damn fantastic.  I'm not a huge fry person, but man, these were addictive.I think the value is great; we're absolutely getting 4 meals (2 each) out of the dinner, because no one needs 6 pieces of chicken for dinner.  The owner told us exactly how we should re-heat the chicken, which is really nice to know--though I think we're going to eat it cold.  The staff here is so nice, and so willing to please.  They really want you to love their food, and it's damn hard not to.  Let's keep this place in business, Chicago."
"I have been here twice the past two saturdays and it is a great lunch/snack place.  I had the chicken sandwich both times, once with the buffalo sauce and once with the seoul sassy sauce.The seoul sassy sauce is amazing and addicting.  I want to get a bottle of it and pour it on everything.  Nothing against the buffalo sandwich which was also very tasty, but the seoul is just great.Good atmosphere, the owner is nice.  A very cool trendy little joint with great food.I plan on having many a lunch there."
"Really like the attitude of the staff, relaxed atmosphere and the BiBimBop.  Its often tough to get a seat - much like Del Seoul.  l haven't yet tried the wings, but I see a lot of other people having them.  Maybe next time."
"I dragged my friend here with me last night because we were both starving and I've been meaning to stop by Crisp for quite some time now. We walked into the small, brightly lit restaurant and immediately felt a little intimidated-- not quite sure how to begin ordering. Sensing our hunger and uncertainty, the man at the counter quickly began chatting us up. Or should I say wooing us with his bitingly loving words?He introduced himself as Doug. Doug Funke. As in ""Funke Chicken."" Whether he was toying with me or not, I do not know. I do not care. From that point on, I agreed to everything the man suggested. Try both the Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ? Okay! Try both the garlic and mango salad dressings? Yes, sir! Try the Baby Buddha Bowl with beef? Okay, Doug Funke! Bus our own table? Anything you say, Mr. Funke!Oh yeah-- the food was pretty darn good as well. ;) My friend (who happens to be Korean and is somewhat of a picky eater) was even going on about how good the chicken was. So I took that as a good sign.  In conclusion, I left with a skip in my step and a happy rumble in my belly."
"After getting the Seoul Sassy wings for the first time, I decided that I should try out the BBQ wings as well before I rated this place. Well, needless to say, despite the messyness of the bbq sauce, they were fantastic. But the Seoul Sassy is still where it's at. Do they sell this in bottles? Cause I'll buy it first thing if that's the case. Goddamn. I want some seoul sassy wings right now!"
"Yum. Accessible Korean flavors in chicken wings, tenders, burritos, and sandwiches. Any place you can get Korean food and fries in combination is a winner."
"I saw this place as it was under construction, and couldn't wait for it to open; there is  a serious lack of good Korean food in the lakeview area. I like the mix of more traditional dishes with some creative fare. The Buddah bowls, Seoul Sensation (burrito), and Not so Common Crisp (chicken sandwich) are all great. Friendly and quick service only add to Crisp's appeal. Only negative is that it's closed on Mondays!  Highly recommended for some good quick eats."
"I have never heard or tasted Korean BBQ wings, but I completely approve!  Different sauces, from sweet to spicy and ones that are in between! There are bowls with wonderful veggies, and other sides, but I would try the wings if I were you!"
"I ordered delivery and it arrived at my house literally 15 minutes after I hung up the phone (maybe I live too close for delivery and should have picked up myself..but it was rain/snowing..). I had the big buddha bowl with tofu which is huge, filled with veggies and super delicious. I also tried the fried mushrooms which were excellent. This will become a new regular spot for me!"
"Not a chicken eater and man was that a shame here.  That chicken looked KILLER!!!  I got the Bad Buddah Bowl and it was a delight.  So many veggies!!  Great sauces on the table.  Offered organic brown rice - very nice touch.  I added tofu but with everything else happening, it was not necessary.  Fairly priced."
I'm kind of a fat guy and these are the best wings I have had in this city.
"came here for the 4 stars 425+ reviews!  (yelp rarely steers us wrong) between the 2 of us we had 10 wings- 5 regular and 5 ginger soy and we had 2 left-over!  these wings are big and tasty!  they also gave us other dipping sauces to try, but i think we chose the right combo.  the ginger soy was great, but the plain was a good break cuz it got too salty after a while.  quick great service and small but clean for eating there.  not really a sit down place unless you wanna eat and run.next time i want to try the bi bim bop :)"
"I was drawn in by the Bi Bim Bop\ Buddha Bowls, which I seem to have a hard time finding in Chicago. I got the Baby Buddha, and (for me) it was a lot of food. I was happy there was a choice of meat and a brown rice option!! I'll be back to try the wings!"
"I'm giving Crisp 5 stars because I think it's about as good as it gets in a quick-service/take-out restaurant.  I was drawn in by the sight of the crowds, and quickly understood while they were all there.  I won't try to repeat all that's already been said, so I'll just comment I had the Sassy Seoul Steak dish -- it was plenty to eat, but I was sorry when I finished it.  Just the right mix of sweet and savory bulgogi and rice.  I'll be a regular."
"Didn't visit the place, but my buddy said I had to try them and brought a to go order for me. I had the Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ. I've had my fair share of Korean style wings, but these had an American twist to them. I love Korean food (as I am Korean) and I love American food... and these had the great combination of both... although if I had to choose between traditional Korean wings and Crisp, I would choose traditional style... but since I had them I developed a craving for them, which proves to me that they hit that perfect balance of the Korean/American fusion style wings. I definitely will be having Crisp again when I'm in a""Should I eat at a Korean restaurant or a diner"" mood."
"I liked Crisp since they first opened.  I would recommend the wings.  A regular order is more than enough food.  The BBQ flavor is a good mix of hot and sweet. I don't like hot food that is hot for hotness sake, this isn't the case with Crisp.Their portions of fries are huge too. You can definitely share them, with a friend, unless you are a fatty."
Let me begin by saying if you find Wing Stop and Hooters to have awesome wings...don't go here!  The wings at Crisp actually have some thought and care put into them and mediocre pallets might be overwhelmed if prematurely exposed to such well crafted food.  The flavors were well conceived and the Bee Bim Bob was awesome.  Without getting into too much detail about the ease at which I ordered and ate to the presentation which was simple and refined the place rocked.  Definitely a must return.
"I've come in here a few times and always loved it. I love korean food in general and crisp is more of an americanized korean but still very very good. I have had ordered the baby buddha or also known as the bim bim bop and it's really good. Almost very similar to the actual bim bim bop. I also have had the crisp bbq. That is probably the best bbq wings I've had in Chicago. it's a little spicy, a little sweet. It's really yummy. I also had the plain jane, which is really plain. I don't think I will order that again. The service is fast and friendly. When I order for delivery, it's very fast too. Overall, this place is good."
"Yum, yum, yum, and YUM!  I've passed by Crisp millions of times but never bothered to go in.  I finally took the plunge this year and I can't stop!  Their Seoul Sensation Burrito is absolutely delicious!  I've tried their chicken wings too, and although delicious, I'd rather get the Seoul Sensation.  One thing that is surprisingly delicious are their fries, you'd wouldn't think they were good coming from a contemporary Asian fusion place, but they make meals go from great to greater (as if that were possible)."
"Went here and split a half chicken with someone and we got the Seoul Sassy and the BBQ sauces. If I remember correctly, I enjoyed the Seoul one much better, which was good, cause my companion preferred the BBQ. I would definitely come here again, though I probably wouldn't choose vegetables as a side since it's just pickled veggies. Fried mushrooms however are always a friend of mine."
"Inexpensive, amazing, delicious.  And they deliver.  The major downfall: salt, salt, salt, salt, salt.  At the end of the day, you might be puffy and cotton-mouthed, but it will have been worth it."
"So how do you tell if an Asian restaurant is legit? There are actually Asian people eating there. Which was the case with Crisp when i went in for the first time this past Sat night. It was a good omen that didn't disappoint. We ordered a whole fried chicken (which consists of already cut sections individually fried un-battered, and covered in sauce for your eating convenience.) and the medium-sized Buddha Bowl with beef. We were ravenous and it was still too much for us to finish. I was shocked at how good it all was. I'm grateful to no longer have to trek up to Foster every time I want Korean.The food, price, atmosphere, super friendly counter service, and lightning quick food prep makes this place stellar. I'm definitely adding Crisp to my list of top places to eat."
I just discovered this place and love it. The spicy chicken strips and Chicago bowl are now my addictions. I live in Lakeview and only get food for takeout. You will to unless you want to each right next to someone....which I hate doing.
"Wife and I shared an order of 5 Wings (w/Crisp BBQ) and a Baby Buddha bowl. Both were extremely flavorful and the BBQ had just enough spice to satisfy myself, but not enough to overwhelm my more sensitive better half. A decent value since we ended up with leftovers, but I promptly ate those two hours later because I was craving more. Definitely worth adding to the regular rotation..."
"I challenge anyone to find better wings in chicago then Crisp.  Seriously.  None of your puny freezer dried crap here.  The quantity may be misleading,  because their wings include BOTH the wing,  and the associated drumstick.  So 5 is like 10 anywhere else.   I have tried their other fares,  and all are good,  but i keep going back for the wings.  The guys that work there are great,  esp. Howie and Alden,   (yeah, I go there enough I know their names...),  and are more then happy to accomodate any mixture of tastes you might have a proclivity for.  Again,  find better wings in chicago,  I dare you."
"We have decided to stop coming to Crisp as often as we do. It has simply become too expensive to eat there. $10 for 6-piece chicken strips, and pretty measley strips at that? $10 really?? Crisp, you can do better. Your food is great, but the service and prices are outrageous. I should note that the owner did contact me about the service. It's good to see that someone cares about bettering their business. Still, by now, you can't honestly NOT have known that your employees give terrible service."
Ordered: Buddha Bowl w/ brown rice and beef and had to try the chicken wings(w/ seoul sassy sauce)Buddha Bowl wasn't anything special or out of the ordinary but the reputation of the chicken is well deserved--crispy and just real damn good. A must try.
"Heading out to the Bulls game and went to Yelp to locate someplace new to eat.  That is where I found you.  I wanted a place quick and somewhat close to Wrigleyville because we were planning to visit my daughter.  As it turns out Crisp is one of my daughter's favorite places.  She has been trying to get me there for some time.  I had 10 wings half BBQ and Sassy Seoul.  They were incredible.  It surprised me but, I liked the BBQ a tad more.  Not that the others were bad.  They were great as well.  The wings are uncut and huge.  The ""Crisp"" coating was over the top.  We have plans to go back the next time we're in the area.  Small place, very casual and looks to be primarily a carry out joint.  The gentleman taking our order was very nice and thank you for suggesting getting half BBQ as well.  If you're into chicken wings and asian fare, I HIGHLY recommend!!!  Thank you."
"Great food at a great price.  I think everything that can be said about this restaurant has been stated by other reviewers.  I'd like to add how nice the owner was.  He took the time to explain the different items.  Well into my meal, he stopped by my table and checked up on me.  I will definitely go back."
"We finally found a restaurant where all three of our kids can find something they're excited to eat...thanks Crisp!Let me start by clearly stating that if I were to review Crisp as a Korean restaurant, I'd probably need to give it 3 stars.  But I'm reviewing it as a casual, fried chicken/wing joint with a Korean theme that's quick and affordable.  And within that realm, it crosses right into the end zone.Fried chicken:  excellent.  Flavorful without being too greasy.Chicken wings: outstanding.  The BBQ wings had a great balance of sweetness and spice.  (Although for traditionalists I suppose they could use a little extra kick).Bulgogi bowls:  the bowls were average.  But they were still tasty and quick.  That is, I wouldn't go here for the bulgogi.  But once here, the bowls are quite satisfying."
they have really good chicken crispy . I love it.. !!
good juicy chicken!
"Side note- I had it delivered so the complete experience was not had; however, from what I did taste, this place has all the makings of a 5 start joint.  Those soul sassy wings are big, juicy and ever so tasty.  The slaw was good, not great but I realize that's not why you come here.  Very excited to eat my next meal at their place and experiment with some new flavors.  Good stuff!"
"I crave this chicken like crack! The sassy and BBQ sauces are some of the best I have ever had and their chicken is always perfect. The beef bowls are not bad either. It is not the cheapest chicken in town, so if that is what you are looking for don't go here. If you are looking for flavor this is the place. Call your order in ahead to avoid the wait that can get a little long a peak hours."
"I thought the only place to get awesome Korean chicken wings (called Seoul Sassy at Crisp) was all the way up in Lincolnwood at Dong-Ah. I was pleasantly surprised to find Korean chicken in Lakeview that's so flipping good. By the way the wings are huge. What they call ""5-pieces"" is really 10 pieces anywhere else. Most of the guys that work the counter are pretty laid back and friendly which make visits all in all a good experience."
I got the steak bowl and it was DELICIOUS! very large portion size for only like eight bucks. Wheel of Fortune was playing. Good times.
"Very friendly, laid-back small Korean place. What I love about Crisp is that I can go with someone who loves fried chicken, and then get a delicious veggie buddah bowl with brown rice for myself. How many places have good fried food AND good healthier options at the same time?"
"I like you! This is not a real restauraunt, or so my friend and i were told when we wandered in and began to study the menu for some time. The man who turned out to be on of the co-owners quickly clarified and said, i mean this is like fast food korean with american twist (ok don't sue, don't quite remember what the exact words were but you get the idea). With this warning in mind i ordered the baby buddha bowl and he gave me a free side of kimchi. It was good, filling and cheap. I prefer the real Bimbimbop (however thats spelled). But as this was fast food it was pretty tasty. 3 stars for the buddha Bowl but the kimchi was AWESOMENESS. (Yes in all Caps) so Crisp gets bumped up to 4 stars."
"Seemed like an original concept and was very affordable, fast and convenient."
"This is one of those places I get a craving for every month or so and nothing else will do.  Can you get better bi-bim-bop in the city?  Sure.  Are there places where you get better bi-bim-bop AND all the menu items aren't named by a frat boy in his second year of business school, broseph?  Definitely.  Buuuut the bi-bim-bap here IS good and fresh, and the korean-style fried chicken is really really really tasty.  And they deliver.  On bikes.  I like it."
Best korean friend chicken in the city hands down.  Rice bowls are tasty too
This place used to be Ricebox. I used to love Ricebox. :(I finally got to try Crisp this weekend. I went for the Seoul Sassy. It reminded me of the Korean wings that I've had before. The sauce was really tasty. I thought it was a bit expensive though. It would be nice if the chicken came with some small sides. The whole chicken is definitely a better deal than the half though.
"Love Crisp!  That Seoul Sassy sauce is the best!  I love their fried mushrooms, and I don't like mushrooms.  Onions rings are great, too.  The spicy sauce that they come with is so good!  I make sure to ask for extra sauces.  The chicken wings are delicious, but the tenders are even better because I think they are easier to eat."
Let me put it this way.... I drive 45 minutes (one way) from the suburbs just to have this chicken.  It is absolutely yummy and decently priced!
"This place puts a new spin on chicken wings.  Their Seoul Sensation sauce is addicting, and their battered mushrooms are fantastic.  This is the perfect hungover/football Sunday meal...or any day of the week meal :)"
"If you like bulgogi, then you'll love the Seoul Steak Bowl. This place also has delicious, huge chicken wings. The only downfall is that they close very early for a place so popular."
"This chicken spot is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Before they arrived you had to go to a sports bar to get any decent wings.  Sometimes I just don't want an ale....Tips:- They don't open early.  Check the website.- They serve the whole wing.  It is slathered in sauce.  You will get pretty messy.- Not that hot of sauce.  Delicious, but not all that spicy."
"If I were stuck on a deserted island and could only have 5 things to eat, I think that chicken wings would be one of them! (That, along with french fries, lobster, chaco tacos and popcorn.) And, I would definitely have Crisp provide them for me. The wings are big and juicy and very, very fried. Okay, so not the healthiest thing to eat but still mighty good!I opted to be boring and went with the plain chicken wings. They were anything but plain, but didn't really have sauce on them... which I like. I am a fan of buffalo wings, but didn't feel the buffalo mood that evening. I thought the flavors of the wings were perfect... not too salty but not bland, either. And again, they are HUGE! I don't like eating the drumstick parts so I just left those so I would have room for the other part of the meal. I also tried the Buddha bowl with bulgogi (bibimbop). Again, the portion on this was massive! You would have to share it for sure. I have never been a huge bibimbop fan, but for what it is, I thought it was tasty! It was a nice pairing with the chicken wings because it seemed a bit healthier. I also tried the Seoul Sassy wings and was really not a fan. It's not that it wasn't good, it is just that I am more of a salty person rather than a sweet person. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal. They have communal seating and paper towels for their napkins. Totally casual and totally cheap. There were a lot of people getting their food to go which seemed like a good idea. I probably have to wait awhile before I indulge again in the yumminess of the wings. It's a little too heavy to be eating too much of. Next time, I am going to try the Korean burritos, as those looked rather tasty."
"You know, sometimes it's the little things in life...like the fact that Crisp pokes holes in their to go containers so the steam can escape and not make everything soggy....and the many soda choices you can find-hellllloooo Tahitian Treat...and the big things here, like the food? Awesome. Crispy chicken and tasty sacues. The steak bowl is awfully good too-the beef is flavored just right and the portions are huge. Go with friends, order lots of different items and then share everything, it's the way to do it. Damn, I want some right now..."
"I used to live a block away and when I moved I chose a Seoul Sensation Korean Burrito from Crisp to be my final Chicago meal. The beef bulgogi, crisp romaine lettuce, corn, carrots, rice and tomatoes. Yumm.... Allison's Atomic sauce is the perfect sauce. I think it might be a simple mixture of chili paste and mayo but I can't be sure. The Foodie's Choice Crisp and the Seoul Steak sandwich are also amazing. Everyone I've taken to Crisp has fallen instantly in love. My south side friends were bummed they don't deliver that far and my coworkers would try to trade me lunch when I brought leftovers. My only regret is I never tried the wings. I'll be visiting in December so I'll definitely do it then (if only I can resist not getting a burrito)."
"So, I wondered into crisp one hungry hungover Sunday afternoon looking for some wings, because a friend had said they were the best in the area.  After browsing the menu I decided one of their steak bowls might be more suitable and boy was I happy with my decision.  The marinated meat on top of the perfectly cooked and sticky brown rice was the most amazing combo that had hit my taste buds in a long time.  Over the next few weeks I tried the wings, chicken bowls, boneless chicken strips, and a few other items and nothing was disappointing.  This is a great cheap and easy place in the neighborhood that doesn't lack in flavors or portions.  Definitely check it out if you want to kick up your hungover Sunday or laid back weeknight."
"Oh, yes, yes, yes. I always get the chicken sandwich, the one that comes with lettuce, tomato, mayo and cheese..but the star, of course, is the chicken.  I don't know how they fry the chicken, exactly (I don't want to know, don't ruin the magic for me), but the way that it is fried makes the crispiness hold up to the rest of the sandwich. And the sauce, oh the sauce! My favorite is their BBQ...it is a sweet and tangy and just a teeny bit spicy...perfect with their fries and a cream soda."
"Loved it, totally loved it. I give Crisp a 4.5. Christina P and I went on a Friday night not really knowing what to expect. I know nothing about Korean dishes really so not sure what to rate this against but we both had the Baby Buddha Bowl- asked for brown rice and added beef due to the cashier's reco saying ""it's really F*%ing good."" Ok sold.  Next time definitely want to try the fried chicken."
I want more CRISP.  I wish I lived in their delivery zone.
"En route to pick up our tuxedos for my best friend's wedding, we stopped at Crisp for an early lunch 3 days ago.  The three of us ordered a meal that consisted of a full chicken, 2 sides, and 2 sodas.  We decided to get half the chicken prepared with Seoul Sassy and the other half was Plain Jane.  Our sides were fries and onion rings.To my delight, the chicken was succulent and perfectly complemented the crispy, seasoned exterior.  Although the Asian-inspired Seoul Sassy was my clear front-runner, the subtle flavor of Plain Jane did not disappoint.  Both varieties were presented fresh from the fryer and begging to be devoured.The fries were reminiscent of McDonalds and the onion rings were satisfactory.  Clearly, where this place shines is in the chicken.  I'd love to return and sample the other, more diverse sides.Based on the chicken alone, I would give Crisp 4 stars.  But, the extra effort of our server, John, to make sure we enjoyed our experience warrants an extra star.I was very pleased with my experience overall and I'm interested in returning to try one of the many other types of meals available at this establishment."
"it's just okif you're coming here thinking you're getting REAL korean fried chicken, you'll be disappointed - Gyo Chon / Bon Chon chicken, this is not. If you have no idea what gyochon and bonchon is... then you have nothing to worry about... just try it out. Their sauces are pretty good... BUT the names are straight up corny. As a Korean person, it made me wanna puke to tell them that I wanted the Seoul Sassy sauce on my chicken. Also... buddha bowl. not even gonna get into that. Not sure why it's even on the menu. it's like their veggie alternative... but then... u're a fried chicken joint. I don't see veggies options at popeyes or kfc. like i said... i dont wanna get into it. and the name... jeez. ok i'm done. Service is just ok (could be better). Food is just ok (not sure how much better it can get... i'd rather have bonchon). Names are stupid. Take this place as a unique fried chicken joint and nothing else... you might actually enjoy it more than me.Oh... stay away from those korean burritos... completely disappointing.Owner has some crazy korean accent too. He's half german or something and he tries to pronounce korean words and it's just straight up awkward. i guess it shouldn't matter. I think it's cause i just don't like him that much. had some bad customer service experiences with him over the phone and in the restaurant. one piece of advice... if you caused any kind of disappointment to a customer and you knew it was your fault... try to make it right. don't blame it on comcast. you could've at least put my order in first before the line of 4 people... that's the least you could've done after putting me on hold on the phone for 15 minutes and then hanging up because ""comcast messed up."" maybe you just don't know how to use the phone?"
"We really-really-really need more Korean food outside of Koreatown. I personally am not one to correlate supposed ""authenticity"" with pleasurability of food. I would guess that, like many other ethnic restaurants in Lakeview, there is a good deal of fusion going on here--but whatever Crisp is making, it is damned good. This is one of those places where the first thing you get ends up sticking with you and so every time you go back you can't help but get it again and again, even though other things sound similarly tantalizing. This is me and the Buddha Bowl (ie bibimbap) with bulgogi (marinated beef). I especially love that they'll give me extra gochujang (hot sauce), as I am an utter addict. At some point I will have to try the chicken, as per other reviews here.Other perks: a huge selection of beverage options, from the mundane (canned sodas) to the less so (some of the weirder flavors of Vitamin Water) to the outright extraterrestrial (Asian drinks with non-English labels.) Very nice counter staff. Fast fricking service and it's clearly made to order.One star off because there have been a couple of times that I've ordered only to find that their credit card system was down and they were going cash only--one of these times, after I had placed my order. I'm not a person to carry cash, in general, so I had to awkwardly run across the street and get cashback at CVS. They were cool about it, though."
"Admittedly, I'm not exactly a fried chicken aficionado, but this is the best fried chicken I've ever had. The skin is crispy, without being thick or floury and the sauces are delicious."
These are just some damn good wings. I've been here a handful of time and I have no doubt that these are the best wings in the city.  The unique flavors and texture is just right. The skin always has a crunch and the sauce compliments the chicken itself rather than drown it out.
"I love this place! I haven't tried the whole menu but the Fried Chicken and Buddha Bowls are amazing. The Crispy BBQ and Seoul Sassy flavors are the two best. The people who work there are always very friendly and you can normally chat with the owner while you munch away on the delicious mess of fried chicken. I suggest trying the chicken the first time there and then going back for a Buddha Bowl. For those of you who are unfamiliar with a Buddha Bowl. Its basically a bunch of brown rice and delicious vegetables thrown together with a over-easy egg on top. They have three variations of the Bowl with each containing more veggies than the last. I get the bad boy with beef added as suggested by the owner.Two words for you ""MUST TRY""-E"
"I have gone to Crisp and handful of times and love it.  Their chicken wings are amazing as well as their rice bowls. But my all time favorite is there Seoul Sensation Burrito! I get it every time! Also, surprisingly their fries are good too! Also, I should mention that I am Korean and I very much enjoy the twist that Crisp adds to Korean cuisine! I highly recommend Crisp. It is absolutely delicious."
"this place was delicious. i got the seoul sassy chicken tenders and they were great. i also liked that they have picnic table seating, so you can get to know your neighbor if you like."
"GREAT FOOD!!! Especially the WACKY WACKY WINGSFor those hankering wings sans the rest of the bird, we've got a treat for you. No itty bitty wings here -- these Jumbo sized wings are fried to perfection and come in your choice of sauce. however they loose one star for closing at 9 pm! who closes at 9 on a friday!!! If your trying to serve a young crowd, then you you need to stay open longer on a Friday and Saturday. They lose 1 star for not serving the needs of their primary market."
"Great place to stop by for a bite.  The guy manning the cashier was very helpful in explaining the difference between the fried chicken sauces and even let us split our order - half seoul sassy and half crisp sauce.  And it was finger licking good! Seoul sassy is my favorite.  Also ordered the baby buddha bowl, which is more than enough and essentially your bi bam bop.  Good fix for Korean if you don't have the time to head up north.BTW, love the cute chick logo."
"the food here is great and very tasty. However, the prices are very high and I just found out they raised them even more. I mean it's just rice and veggies... $10.25 for a Budda Bowl with brown rice is a little steep."
This place was just OK for wings. I would not go out of my way to eat here. I thought it was too sweet for my liking. If you have a sweet tooth you will like it. I prefer your classic wings that are more savory and salty. I will say the quality of the chicken was good. Will I return? I doubt it! Unless some friends want to go.
"With all the great reviews, I had high expectations for Crisp.... that went unfulfilled. I got the Seoul Sassy chicken. It was flavorful but way too salty. Nothing extremely special or memorable. I've had fried chicken in Korea and Bonchon in NY and this chicken doesn't even come close. My friends both got the Buddha Bowls which I found pretty flavorless and boring. The sauce added some spice but not enough flavor. My mom can make a better version at home. You can get way better versions of this dish (Bibimbap) at other Korean restaurants too. It's sad because I love Korean-style fried chicken and was so excited. Oh well...."
"I pretended I wasn't going to order from Crisp because of their $15 minimum for delivery. But that was BS. And I'm not even going to pretend that I'm not going to order now that they're cash only. But, I thought everyone should now that they are now cash only!"
"Words fail me on how good this place is.I was going to give it four stars for not having beer but dang, it'sso good I HAD to throw in the 5th star..."
"I had 10 strips (not wings); half with Seoul sassy sauce and half with the crisp BBQ sauce. The Seoul sassy is authentic. Honestly just like my mom used to make. It's that soy/brown sugar marinade that many are familiar with. The crisp BBQ sauce was also very good, seemingly made with the traditional pepper paste used in much of Korean cooking. My girlfriend had the bad boy Buddha bowl which is basically just bi bim bop but smartly renamed for American diners. I've had plenty of bi bim bop and this was right up there. It's kinda hard to screw that up though. My only complaint is that the place is kinda cramped but any restaurant on that section of Broadway is pretty much the same. Also, kinda steep. The bill was almost $30 for the both of us. Will def go back!"
"This place is good. They do Korean Fried Chicken and some other stuff. I was feeling really cheap when I went and so I got the Chi-Town Chicken Bowl because it was cheap. For $9 I got two meals (my lunch leftovers were great!) and a soda. It was just what I was looking for. My friend got some fried chicken, which is what they do, which I tried and it was great. This was my second time there and both times all of the staff have been super super nice and helpful. All in all, no complaints."
"I was so excited to go to Crisp - I had heard about it from my friend who gave it rave reviews.  As I continued to ask other friends, they had all heard good things.It's all true! Get the wings, burrito and Buddha bowl! i stuffed myself because the food was so good!!! And the service was great, too. Def would go again and try something different.  Overall, fabulous experience !"
oh Crisp! our last date for a while only due to my moving from Chicago tomorrow...but you do not fail to disappoint. i went with my old faithful Crisp BBQ except I kicked it up a notch and got extra spicy....how will i live without yooooouu??!?!?!?
"Sorry, Crisp i have to take a star away. I'm still a fan, but I guess your novelty is wearing off a little. Don't get me wrong I still love the buddha bowls and wings. But it seems like a bit much to be paying almost $20 for a big buddha bowl and 5 wings. After eating those deliscious wings, I wish I had a wet nap to clean up my sticky fingers. and it doesn't help that there is only one bathroom per gender. the last time i went there was a little wait for the women's restroom. And all I wanted to do was to wash my hands. I was at a Mexican restaurant in San Diego similar in size and they had a sink outside of their bathroom. And this was a pretty nice restaurant not some hoe-in-the-wall joint."
"This place is really unique and I'm so happy it is close to my work.  I ordered the Bud's Buffalos Suicide style and my ass is still on fire.  The chicken is drenched in buffalo sauce and topped off with about a thousand jalepenos.  I gave a little to one of my co-workers and he started crying. ( He's a pus can't handle the heat)   A half order is enough to feed at least 3 people, which for 8.95 is a steal.  I also have to say the delivery driver should be put into the Delivery Driver Hall of Fame.   The fries are what made this place lose a star.  They just seemed like there were cooked yesterday.  I will for sure be going back however, which I'm sure my ass is none to happy about."
"Only restaurant that cooks like my mom, now that's a huge compliment.  No other place cooks anything close to what my mom makes in terms of style, tasty-ness, variety of ingredients, and balance.  Nice decor, music, and people. Large portions. Veggie-friendly :)"
"Order all flavors of their wings and they were delicious.  You get the drum, flat and wing on each wing so they are big and meaty.  Also we ordered them for delivery and they arrived very fast and hot, I think they quoted an hour but they were they were here in about 20 mins."
"I have only gone in for carry-out, but it is always extremely fast. Before I can choose which of the funky retro variety of sodas to try, my meal is ready to go. I am a fan of the Baby Buddha which I opt to have without the egg on top making a really guilt free and satisfying meal-just the right amount. Its a little weird the first time, I just wasn't used to having anything like that served cold. I admittedly zap it in the microwave so its not cold cold, just 'crisp.'"
"I want to douse myself in the seoul sassy sauce so I can keep licking it off.   We came to Chicago for a concert and were looking for something unique near our hotel, Crisp came up with rave reviews, and they lived up to them.   We shared a seoul sassy half chicken and the Buddha Bowl.   Though the buddha bowl was absolutely delicious (especially the lightly pickled cucumbers) it was the seoul sassy chicken that stole the show.  Eating this chicken was like getting the best hug I've ever gotten in my life.  I wanted to feel it's warm embrace for the rest of my life and possibly find myself married to it.  I know my groans of pleasure were distracting to the other diners, but I lost all control over public decorum.  If you find yourself anywhere near this restaurant, run to it.   Get the seoul sassy chicken and change your life."
"Theres nothing to say that hasnt already been said about this place but damn its some good chicken!! We got the whole chicken meal for $20 which came with 2 sides and 2 drinks. On one half we had the Seoul Sassy which was amazing. Sweet and hot at the same time, a ton of flavor. The other half we had the sauce that is more soy sauce based, which was also tasty, but the BBQ was my favorite. Be prepared to get messy and lick your fingers clean!  There was so much chicken we had enough to take some home and enjoy the next day. The fries are good but a little thin for me...think McDonalds. The fried mushrooms were decent, but I dont think Id get them again. This place is seriously the best wings/chicken in the city in my opinion, I will be back for sure!"
"This place is great! Nice people, the wings are the best I've ever had and the atmosphere is hip and cozy. It''s so cheap too. Just try it."
"I hate my friend Annie. You might ask why. She is one of my best friends. Well Annie introduced me to Crisp. I love Crisp. I don't live close to Crisp. Annie lives very close to Crisp and is able to go there often. I guess its a love hate relationship.Crisp is cheap, the service is friendly and the food is oh so fresh. I tried it and ate basically everything on the menu. LOVE the fried mushrooms as an appetizer with the dipping sauces. They are a must. I wanted lots of the traditional fried chicken, but I am so happy that we got the Seoul Sassy because it is delicious...well, sassy and...saucy! The Asian influence kicks in here. Order the Buddha Bowl veggies as a side - they're served cold but are addictive as are the cold potatoes (they are a bit sweet too).So full was my belly but so happy.Ok maybe I don't hate Annie for introducing me to this place, but maybe she can recommend a good gym for me and my happy tummy?"
The wrap was really good and there was some sneaky spicy sauce on it that put it above a regular wrap.  This wings were ok - and I think the mess-factor hampered my experience.  The all you can use paper towels were great for my tree-killing husband however.  He likes napkins.  Lotsa napkins.
"We tried their chicken wings, chicken strips, fries, kimchi + rice.  The food was so-so but the customer service was excellent.  We got bbq and the most spicy wings & tenders.  But even the bbq ones were a bit spicy for me (spicier than mild).  But overall, a clean and nice place to eat."
"Chi-town Chicken Bowl was pretty damn good --- especially with the spice drip side stuff. Dude behind the counter was friendly. Price was good for the value. Oh, and they had Tahitian Treat. Freaking Tahitian Treat!A+ guys..."
"Go here! If they ever decided to put booze in there and add more tvs, you would never get a seat in here. I would probably permanently glue my ass to a chair. Jon was awesome and I'll be back many more times! Had the BBQ and Seoul Sassy wings, just awesome! Best wings ever!"
overhyped and left disappointed. the sauces were good but the chicken meat itself didn't taste very good.
"I read the reviews on yelp and decided to see if what was said about the wings was accurate. Wow, I have tried the plain wings; which by the way there is nothing plain about them. Things are the perfect texture, crispy outside without loads of breading and very well seasoned. If you order five wings it is more than enough b/c the wings are very large! Yummy! The best wings in Chicago at a great price. The best part is they deliver."
"Maybe my expectations were too high after reading such great reviews.  There were 5 of us and we decided to just order a bunch of things and share.  We ended up getting the wings w/ all the sauces and really the only one I liked was the Seoul Sassy, the rest were just bleh.  DO NOT order the onion rings or mushrooms, they are the generic prepackaged crap you can get in your local grocery freezer and they aren't even the good kind.  The buddha bowl was nothing special.  We also ordered the side of veggies, which were ok and could have definitely improved if they were seasoned.  I don't really know if I would come back, nothing was fantastic.  I will admit the staff was super friendly and helpful, but that's just not enough to make me want to come back."
"I don't understand why this place is getting good reviews.  Only one flavor of wings was good and that was Seoul Sassy.  But even that said, I would never go back here again.  Seems overpriced, yuppy-ish, and over-hyped.  Go to great seas if you want the real Korean wings."
"A friend and I stopped in for a quick bite before catching a movie at Landmark Century.  It was our first time and my friend didn't know what she wanted or what to expect.  Based on reviews, I was all about the korean fried chicken.  The manager (perhaps owner) was very kind and helpful in explaining the menu, flavors, and sauces until we decided to split a half order of Seoul Sassy Chicken (drenched in a ginger, soy, and garlic sauce) and a huge basket of fries that came with two spicy dipping sauces.  Wow!  It was so tasty that we couldn't focus on our conversation as we devoured the chicken while periodically sucking sauce off our fingers.  The half order with fries turned out to be perfect for us.  When finished, we were neither stuffed, nor hungry, but very satisfied.  I can't wait to go back and sample the rest of the menu!"
"Crisp is fantastic but one word of warning, CASH ONLY. I can't believe how much they give you for the cost. If i had to choose a string of words to describe it I would say ""quasi-hipster-seoul-food.""  They have Bimmibop and fried chicken (huge btw), awesome fries, steak bowls and crazy items like korean burritos. It's great food and it's on the cheap, a great spot to swing by. The benches aren't real comfortable and food preparation takes awhile, i recommend ordering ahead"
"I love this place. I live a few blocks down and have to resist the urge to run over every day. I got the chicken tenders, they were all white meat, so tender and tasty and really filling. I also shared a half chicken with my mom, it was plenty of food although I easily could have eaten the whole thing myself! The sauces are all amazing."
"I love their food. Great but cheap Korean food. The owners are beginning to recognize me which might or might not be a good thing. Love this place and its even better if you want some basic bulgoki. Please try this out! The French fries are pretty awesome too. (Yeah, I know, French fries...but trust me.)"
"Sweet (Seoul) sassy molassy! I heard this place has the best fried chicken in Chicago. Due to torrential downpours, our original plan to go to Crisp was replaced by our back-up plan to order in. Holy cow (chicken)! What an appropriately named restaurant. Now despite the one-hour wait for delivery (we were warned and we were still willing to wait), the chicken was hot, crispy, juicy, and delicious. And that's just the Plain Jane. Then when we dove into the Seoul Sassy: oh man. I was very close to licking the inside of the styrofoam container clean. On the website, they say not to call it teriyaki. Why would you call it teriyaki? It's BETTER than that. The chicken's fantastic. And here's the kicker. We ate the stuff an hour AFTER it came out of the oven. Imagine eating it at Crisp itself. This place is the real deal. Awesome. (Footnote: ""Sweet sassy molassy"" is a reference to Ray Romano's ESPN sketch on SNL years ago.)"
"Love this place. I've only ever tried the Baby bowl though. Delicious, fresh tasting, so satisfying. I feel virtuous eating here: so many veggies in my bowl, I tell myself sesame oil is good for me too, and I really appreciate that you can swap out the white rice for organic brown rice for just a bit more $. they also have a really great diet soda selection, the only restaurant I know where you can get diet orange soda and root beer. This place is pretty crowded for dinner so you'll have to snuggle up to a stranger on their big communal tables, but who knows- maybe you'll be able to sweet talk some wings out of your new best friend?"
Excellent food - I had the chicken bi bim bop ... I restaurant is bright and features communal seating as well as some window seats. .... will definitely return for more.
This place will blow your mind.  I can't tell you how amazing the chicken is.  The Seoul Sassy chicken is my favorite but I've also really enjoyed the Seoul Sensation burrito.  The staff is also really nice and complete the experience.  I highly recommend this place.
This place is sooo good! We had a coupon so decided to try it-- it was packed! Which I always take as a good sign.  The chicken wings are amazing.
"Heard through a friend that Crisp made a mean wing so decided to give it a shot.  The guy at the counter was very helpful with explaining the menu and it's option.  The wings were HUGE, so only go if you're super hungry.  Everything was very tasty.  This place would get five stars if they were a BYOB, because wings and beer are a match made in heaven!"
Bim Bim Bop is ok.... not the greatest or worst I've had.  Their fried chicken is pretty good.  Actually compares to the Korean style fried chicken I've had in Seoul.   This stuff is some of the best I've found in Chicago.  Wife like's their seoul sassy.  I'm a fan of the original.  It's great.  Place is clean and the workers are friendly.  Parking is a little tight
"Baby Buddha Bowl and the Wrap were fantastic!  Definitely a cool take on the traditional Korean dishes.  The dining space is a little cramped, but it is definitely worth it.  Eat up!"
"Fantastic wings.  I really like their chicken and rice bowl, too."
"I absolutely love this place but I have 1 issue.  They seem to be closed all the time.  I woke up today craving a Dakota Soul Steak bowl and get to Crisp, see an OPEN sign in the window, but come to find it is closed.......I'll move on to the food which is wonderful.  I mentioned above the Steak bowl and it is awesome.  Crisp wings are also amazing.  Big, tender, and a taste you can't beat.  Try Crisp, you'll love it.  But if you live a ways away I would call first.  Enjoy!"
"This regularly saves the night during Friar Tuck Fridays, but last night it was especially good.  I know by now I need to stick with the Seoul Sassy 5-piece wings, and with fries and slaw it fed two of us for $12. So effing good.  I might have to try the Korean burrito next time."
"Simply awesome.  Huge chicken wings cooked and sauced to perfection.  A ton of options to choose from and genuinely good service.  I'm a huge Bdubs fan, but these might be the best wings I've had.  If you like spicy, these wings will do justice.  Ask the manager for reco's, he's very helpful and knows his wings.  Go hungry , leave stuffed and smiling."
crisp blew my mind! it doesn't look like much from the outside but inside it's kind of a hipster/wing lover/byob fan haven. i ordered the jumbo wings and have never had anything like it! the sauce was perfect - spicy and sweet and there was so much meat on the bones. staff checked on us a couple of times even though it's a counter service restaurant. i can't wait to go back for more!
Only one word can describe this place....AWESOME.  This place is soooooooooooo good.  I want to try the bim bim bop next time.  But the fried chicken is to die for....just as good (but different) than Great Sea.
Crisp has temporary hours!  Tuesday - Sunday 4pm - 9pm as of week of 9/22.
"Love this place, they have great wings. Chiken sandwich is really good too. I have tried all there sauces. They are good though I enjoy the really spicy one. These wings are a must try, they are big and fresh and served whole."
"I came here to add another chicken joint to my list since this place has garnered some positive reviews, so I braved the hellacious parking in the area.  The service was very nice and friendly, set up is small, clean and communal, but perfectly fine if you are not super intimidated by strangers.  The spot seems mostly set up for take out at any rate.  They have coolers full of a wide variety of drinks for you to purchase as well.Alright enough of that, onto the chicken.  Crisp uses two sizes of chicken here.  For those ordering whole or half chickens here, they use small frying chickens, for those ordering wings they use the super large variety.  I sampled the plain, seoul sassy, and korean bbq varieties (hey I take this seriously).  The chicken is cooked very well, nice and crisp but not overdone, they do not come out very oily (which is a good sign since food only absorbs frying oil if the oil is not hot enough or if the food has run out of moisture) the oil used is very neutral.  The plain chicken is subtly spiced and has a nice light coating and crunch, I can't really place the spice, but it definitly has a korean twist to it, even plain.  The thighs here are cut into two pieces and the breasts are on the small side as well, so it makes for a very different eating experience than your standared fried chicken cuts.  I do suppose the small piece size aids in reducing cooking times and avoiding burning or undercooking when different sized pieces are cooked together.  The plain, reheats quite well, possible due to to its relatively light battering.If you order the ""wings"" here, you get the whole wing, all together, instead of just drumettes and flats.  The larger wings are cooked very well and are gargantuan, and a very good value for the price, whereass half/whole chickens are priced a bit steep considering the size.  The Seoul Sassy was my favorite sauce, its nice a sweet, with some nice flavor, the sauce is golden (reminiscent of glaze) and comes with some green onion bits as garnish.  The Korean BBW is a fiery red, it is also sweet, has a nice hot kick (somewhere between a medium an hot) and comes sprinkled with sesame for looks.  I have not sampled thier take on buffalo sauce yet, by I suspect I will sooner or later.  Impressively neither of the sauces ruin the crispness of the wings (at least when fresh), which is quite important with the crisp style of the wing.Other observions.  Had the mushrooms, they were good and plentiful, but not really exceptional, the breading is dense and sticks to the mushroom itself, which is nice.  Ordered a side of rice.  The rice is of the very sticky variety like Japenese sushi rice.  Very good.  I'm intrigued by the beef bulgogi on the menu (I love bulgogi), I'll be back to try that.All in all I give the place 5 stars for selection, sauce, and quality of the cooked chicken, specifically the wings.  If it was the whole chicken alone, then maybe 4 stars, but this place excels at the small details; packaging, service and selection all factor in to making this a 5 star chicken joint."
"CRISP STOPPED CARINGYes, that's right, Crisp has officially taken a dump.  One, pricing is getting a bit out of hand; it used be somewhere around 6.99 for a Steak Bowl (all it is, is seasoned beef and rice) and is now costing around 10 bucks.  Two, they give you less of everything; steak bowls used to be stuffed to the brim and had at least 2"" thick of beef.  The wings USED TO BE, dare i say, pterodactyl sized.  Now, everything has been sacrificed for greater profits.  The wings look fairly generic in size (i used to love steroid sized wings).  Three, their neo-hipster staff needs to drop the $hitty attitude.  If i ask for extra atomic sauce for my steak bowl, just give it to me, don't hassle about 50 cents, that is completely petty and classless.  Just stop with the attitude in general,  that guy ""John"" who used to manage the place would have never stood for any of that ""ironic shirt, PBR drinking, thick rimmed glasses"" crap.  It is so unfortunate to see a restaurant I once treasured, completely lose its way.  Also consider, this review is coming from someone who allocated several hours to essays promoting Crisp to the food network and other local news organizations....my stomach is empty and my heart is broken."
"This is a review for a chicken wing shack. And it is awesome (the chicken wing shack, that is). While you can eat inside at the 3 or 4 very practical picnic-style tables, really you're here just to chow down on some good wings, not for a restaurant-style experience. Like many people, I LOVE wings, and after experiencing wings at Crisp, I'm completely ruined for your run-of-the-mill buffalo wings. I've been here 3 times and twice for take-out, and the food has been consistently amazing. After some experimenting, my vote goes for the Seoul Sassy and the Mild Buffalo wings. Get ready to be punched in the mouth with flavor! Also, note that these wings are basically full-size wings, so for the price, it's pretty great. One thing my friends have compared this place to is Great Seas, another Asian restaurant known for their Korean-style wings. I decided to go and compare, and after the amazingness of Crisp, I was left slightly disappointed. Great Seas wings are really good, and still tastier than regular buffalo wings, but they don't offer as much of a selection of flavors, and their wings are much smaller than Crisp's.Conclusion: Best wings in Chicago! (Beware of parking though!)"
"I must say, i never knew that fried chicken was a Korean thing.  Who'd thought.  And they do such a great job.  I like KFC or Popeye's as much as any you of you.  But the Korean variety, with the tangy spicy sauce...talk about finger lickin' good.  I put away half a chicken in barely 3 minutes.  and to have a bowl of bibimbap to go along with it?  makes for a terrific meal.  the restaurant is clean and bright, the counter people were really freindly.  Can't complain much."
Awesome food and plenty of it.  Make sure you are hungry!
"Overall, the experience was dissapointing because the food was not special.  I don't care about sitting at picnic tables but can look past such frivolity if the food is outstanding.  I read a large number of overwhelmingly positive reviews on this site and apparently this place won best fried chicken in Chicago 2008.  So I went there on a Friday night, steady but not too busy.  I ordered the Plain Jane, it is their most basic dish.  Ordering a basic dish serves as a great indicator to gauge the quality of the ingredients, crappy places disguise low quality and poor execution with sweet or excessively spicy sauces.  The chicken arriced after about 10 minutes.  It looked crispy and smelled good.  However, the flavoring was non-existent and the chicken was saw dust dry.  I noticed a million sauces surrounding me but why should I smother my chicken in some insidious sauce to make it taste good?  I tried the sauce anyway, tasted good but not what I expected. Beside the chicken is still dry sauce or no sauce.  I thought that the plain jane Korean style fried chicken would be oozing with flavor from an infusion of asian spice and delight.  Sadly, I received no happy ending from Crisp."
"I'm a fan of this place--the people who work there are really nice, and the food is pretty delicious.  The fried chicken is quite good, and I really like the small Buddha Bowl with beef--lots of veggies, you can get brown rice, and the beef is well-seasoned (small was a LOT of food, too).  Beware, though: a friend got the plain Buddha Bowl and didn't expect all the veggies to be cold (which they also were in the Buddha Bowl with beef, but the beef was hot, so I didn't really notice the cold veggies)."
"For some reason, I always thought Crisp was a salad place, and therefore never bothered checking it out.  It was only when I found out it served Korean fast food that I decided to give it a try (though oddly I saw no Asians behind the counter).Instead of strict interpretations of Korean cuisine, Crisp serves it with an American twist (Korean burritos anyone?).  I tried the Crisp BBQ chicken, the Seoul steak bowl, and the Bad Boy Buddha.  The Buddha bowl was a pretty version of bi bim bop, with well seasoned vegetables.  It is a good summer dish, and the best of the 3 dishes.On the other hand, I was less fond of the BBQ chicken and the steak bowl.  I found them to be way too sweet.  The steak bowl, a bastardized version of bulgogi beef, had too much sauce.  I wished they had served me a bigger portion of white rice to balance it out!Decor-wise, it is well-lit, clean and simple.  Seating is fairly limited and communal, so hopefully you won't have to sit next to odd strangers!If you crave Korean food, Crisp is a decent and affordable choice.  However, from my experience so far, I will stick to the vegetarian Buddha bowl."
"Had been wanted to hit this place up for weeks and finally had the motivation to get out of my apartment (which still didnt have power from the massive storms on the 4th).  The counter girl was very pleasant and did a great job juggling the many diners.  She suggested the seoul sassy sauce..and it did not disappoint!  The ""half"" portion was PLENTY- the breading was just right and the chicken super tender.  What blew me away, being the pop junkie that I am, was the selection of sodas...MAN!  I stood there looking at the cooler completely puzzled for at least 5 min.  Settled with a Diet A&W Root Beer...MMMM.  I like this place.  Ill be back for the burrittos!!!"
Had to try the chicken after reading the reviews and after having the very unique and tasty chicken and wings I have to agree...yum
This place is great. I've only been here once but I will go back soon. Delicious marinated beef over white rice with an egg on top? Can't get much better than that!
"I'm a Crisp regular, mostly for the wings.  With or without bones, always sassy Seoul sauce.  The appetizers I've tried have been ok, the fried mushrooms stick out.  I had a Buddha bowel once and found it less than inspiring.  The picnic tables are a nice touch.  Service is upbeat which is a plus."
"I like this place. I only ever get the Big Buddha dish, or whatever it's called. It's good, filling, relatively healthy, and under $10. The people that work there are nice too."
"Crisp rocks. We had the wings and the Chi-Town Chicken Bowl. Both portions were quite generous and we took home leftovers. For $2 more, you can add fries and a soda to your wings order. (But no soda fountain, bummer.) Their sauce is delicious -- sweet, spicy and tangy. The actual restaurant is small and fills up pretty quickly. I definitely recommend dining at an off-time or skipping that for delivery."
"All their chicken is delicious, and they bowls are quite nice as well.  Excellent food."
"The staff was very friendly, service was great, the Baby Buddha Bowl w/ beef and the Seoul Sassy Wings (big juicy wings) were delicious!  Definitely will be going back."
"This place is great! The food is really tasty and fun.  I can't wait to return. I ordered the Dakota Seoul Steak which was delicious -  twist on the Philly Steak with bulgolgi and spicy sauce. Others in my group ordered the bowls and the chicken sandwich which held their own. We didn't order the chicken wings and by tasting the sandwich alone I know I'll back for more.The service keeps up with the food. This is a fast food style - sandwich/korean restaurant so the decor is not going to be overwhelming. The gentleman behind counter was informative and fun! My only negative is that there isn't one in the city or south side! I think I actually asked if they would deliver to me - knowing well that it was too far. That's how good it is, I already want more!"
Bud's Buffalo.  So good.
"Some yelpers and I checked this place out prior to the Suri Thai Elite event.  Prior to getting there the menu on their website was intimidating me, once I got these I was still intimidated, a bit less. The room is simple. Community seating. The staff member running the counter was WAY helpful in helping me make my selection. I went with the Seoul Sassy Wings. - A subtly sweet sauce prepared with ginger, soy, garlic and other select spices make this a crowd favorite. Regarding the wings- you do not need to order 10, 5 is more than enough. Especially if you're a group and everyone is sharing.  These wings are H-U-G-E. Like Taste of Chicago huge. Learn from our mistake, three of us ordered 10 piece each and there was plenty left over. Also, it's messy, really messy and there are paper towels on the table. You'll need them. Fries were blah. I will try the Smashed Potatoes next time."
"After reading the other reviews out here, I must have gotten them on a bad day.  The guy taking the orders seemed annoyed and was not sociable at all. That alone was bad, but the chicken was worse.  The sauces had a ton of flavor, but it couldn't cover up that the chicken I got was terrible.  The pieces were so small I couldn't even tell you if it was really chicken or not.  The chicken was so crisp it tasted like it was burnt.  I have never been this disappointed in a meal in my life.  They will not be getting any moer business from me or my family again."
"I have been hearing about this place for quite awhile and just got around to trying it.  Staff was pleasant, the fried chicken came quick enough and was pretty tasty...  but not crazy good like I was expecting.  I'll definitely be back, though, those Budda bowls look promising."
"Great wings, friendly owner working."
"Okay, to be fair I haven't tried  what has been described as, 'mouth watering chicken wings'.  But, I have had their big buddha bowl, which is their stab at bimibim bop.  I love bimbimb bop and feel like it is a dish that is really difficult to mess up.  Well, this place has succeeded in doing just that.  It wasn't just the one time, it was on multiple occasions.  Okay, so how do you mess up the easiest dish to make?  Well, first of all the rice was overcooked and clumpy and kind of gooey.  I love sticky rice, but this was not the consistency I was looking for.  Also the vegetables on top tasted like soapy dish water.  There wasn't any flavor in these poor vegetables.  There should be a nice subtle flavor of garlic, sesame oil and a touch of salt.  It all tasted bland to me and the egg on top was slimy.  I have eaten a lot of bimbim bop in my day and have been treated to some delicious homemade versions, where the egg is perfectly cooked, with the yolk soft and runny and the whites cooked just through.  The top of this egg was slimy and undercooked, not appetizing.  I came here with a friend for lunch and we couldn't even hear each other because they were blasting Kings of Leon at an ear splitting volume.  The guy apologized though and turned it down to ear bleeding level."
"We went in there with a mission: to eat chicken and eat chicken we did. Sei-Jin, Zachary, and I ordered a whole Crisp BBQ Chicken and then wings in Seoul Sassy and Bud's Buffalo as well as sides of the ""magic mushrooms"" and ""o-rings"". There was nothing really Korean about the chicken, but it was good indeed. The sides were great great great. Our vegetarian friends for whom we had checked the menu online first before going here post-movie liked what they had. Honestly, I think next time I may try out the Buddha Bowl or something so I won't feel nearly so gross and full after eating so much fried food. I will definitely be back. They also stock Martinelli's apple juice, best apple juice ever, along with lots of other interesting choices of beverages like pear juice. Mmm!"
"Ok, I have to give it 5 stars...the only thing I was disappointed was that I didn't have enough room in my tummy to try everything on the menu.  i was so stuffed.  The food I did get to try was the beef burrito, all 3 flavors of wings, the mushrooms, onion rings, and bi bim bop.  Wow! was it all tasty.  I was sweating so much from the spicy but tolerable wings.  I can't wait to go back for more.  The group of 7 friends and cousin's I brought with were very happy as well.  The owners' Jae and Doug were very friendly and helpful in making our visit a memorable one."
"i liked this place, not a fancy place. the chicken was crispy, full of flavor and moist and different. please please please make some with spice and i mean real spice."
"I must go back as I was fascinated with the menu, I tried the Sassy Seoul wings. The wings were cooked to perfection but I really did not care for the sauce. Luckily I was able to douse them in Sriracha. But with chicken that good, I'm sure my next venture trying suicide buffalo wings will please me more."
Love this neighborhood joint in Lakeview for budget Korean without sacrificing the taste.  The owner is super friendly and definitely stop by for their lunch specials!  Highly recommend the Seoul Bowl (bulgogi)!
"Came across a show on Food Channel yesterday talking about this place so decided to give it a try.  I love spicy food so went with the suicide wings.  Sauce was definitely on par on my heat index but the chicken was average at best.  It was a bit over cooked making it drier than it should.  When that happens, most of the juice from the chicken is gone and can't blend with that amazing sauce.  Kinda like eating chicken jerky drowned with hot sauce.  But looks like they have other interesting items on their menu.  Will definitely give them another try next time to see if they deserve an improved rating"
"This place was awesome.  The service was really great and the food was the staff was all really nice.  The wings are just crispy enough, but don't taste burnt at all.  I think they deliver too, it also is not too pricey."
"I grew up in Buffalo and I know good wings, I am still looking for the best buffalo wings in Chicago, but I gotta give it to Crisp, they do have awesome  Korean wings, there's no doubt about it. I have been a handful of times and have never been dissatisfied. There wings are huge, NOT FATTY! and have the best sauces on them. The seoul one is super good, and so is the crisp bbq. Besides the superb wings, they have an awesome bulgogi bowl (Korean beef) it was super good. Crisp is not the cheapest, but well worth the money."
Food was excellent and the guy at the counter was super friendly. I definitely recommend this place for any one who likes to eat outside the box!
"ON DELIVERY. I am not too impressed with this food as delivered. I hear it's great when you go to the restaurant, and I can see that. I will try this at some point. But I will also try to remember that this food just doesn't work well delivered."
"Wow this place is awesome! I've been here twice, my first experience was amazing, and my second visit started off good and then ended up being great! Me and the BF ordered and shared the bulgogi burrito and their version of a philly steak with bulgogi meat, how cute! We are super big on temperatures and when my sandwich came out the first time, it was cold and so were the fries.One thing I can't stand is COLD cheese on a hot sandwich and that's exactly what they gave me. I didn't want to complain, but I knew that I didn't want to leave wishing I had said something. So, I kindly asked the owner if he could re-heat it for me and he said they didn't have microwaves, so he made me a new one. Boy, I'm happy I asked because that was the best damn Korean style philly steak I'd ever had. Yuuum, next time I want to try their chicken wings, they look awesome."
"a must try! the chicken is tender, succulent and overall...so crispy! we tried all three versions and my favorite was the seoul sassy, but the bbq version has yummy spicy kick to it. the plain jane was excellent as well, a nice change from the limited chain of fast food fried chicken! fresh and right from the fryer. yum.there's a huge variety of food, but it's only a soft opening so not everything is available, but i can't wait to try the other dishes! cash only for the time being!"
"The fact that I've remembered to review Crisp 8 months after my first visit is either a testament to my fantastic memory, or it's just good enough to imprint itself on my gray matter. I'm voting for the latter.The chicken was good and messy, just like BBQ should be. And the sides complemented the chicken well. I got my drink out of a refrigerated case, which, given the get-in-get-out-with-food setting, works just fine. It was clean, the service was fast and friendly, and the prices were good.The drawback Crisp suffers is the portions are way too massive for anyone to eat there regularly and NOT get fat. It's because the food is too damn delicious to stop. And there's so much of it. It's a vicious cycle, and the only way out is to EAT EVERYTHING!"
"when i lived in lakeview, i came here after almost every long bike ride (and no i do not mean hipster-fixie bike riding). the seoul sensation was my go-to refueler. the chicken wings are almost too gigantic to be real, but the sauces are excellent."
"After yahoo rated this place top 10, and seeing they have 500+ reviews, it was that time to checkout Crisp. We went in on a Tuesday about 30 mins before closing and this little place was still slammed. By the time we ordered, seats opened up so I didn't need to haul it all the way back home. The wife ordered the spicy BBQ wings, not really my thing, but not bad either. I ordered the Seoul sassy wings and fries. These did not disappoint. These steroid wings drenched in that sweet savory sauce were simply crackalicious. We were there til about 15 mins after close but never felt rushed to leave. Awesome courteous staff at this joint. The sack of fries you get is HUGE, and I ordered a small! Overall I wont go as far to say they're the best wings I've had, but they were pretty damn good. I will make the trek back to Boystown in the future to get my wing on again, and if it's this good again the consistency will bump this up to a 5 star review."
"My sole visit to Crisp comprised a dinner of a Buddha bowl with chicken.  This version of bi bim bop was okay - nothing tremendously good or bad stands out about the meal.  Unfortunately, for a restaurant that is not a resounding endorsement.  Part of my rationale for giving such a tepid review is that I have never been to a Korean restaurant before where I ordered a Korean dish and didn't receive any kimchi as part of the meal.  I recognize that Crisp offers kimchi as a side, but I find it odd that it doesn't just come with a main course.  Many of you may find that to be an poor reason to fault a restaurant, but I strongly associate kimchi with the Korean food experience.Perhaps I ordered poorly.  I mean the restaurant's name refers to fried chicken, and that being the case you would expect it to be good.  Given that Crisp has gotten so many good reviews I am compelled to go and try their namesake dish.  Hopefully my second visit will be more memorable, and for good reasons."
"How does this place have 9 reviews already? Didn't they *just* open?Tonight was my first visit to Crisp, and I was pretty impressed. The owner, Doug, was super nice and outgoing without being pushy. As I  was eating, he asked me if it he could tell me about the chicken--he didn't just talk talk talk...he asked permission :)I was in the mood for wings, and I was truthfully walking down the street to Avenue Tavern. I took a peek at the menu in the window (the wording is slightly confusing to me) and went in. The ""giant wings"" are in fact the entire wing, all three segments. So an order of 5 is like an order of 10 everywhere else. The breading is the signature here. Very very thin and very crisp. I usually eschew breading on wings, but this was very good. The wing sauce is unique here, not your usual half Franks Red Hot, half butter. This was more of an Asian chili paste-based sauce. Very good, even if it wasn't exactly what I had in mind. I'll be back to try the other sauces, and also I want to try the beef bolgogi burrito. Yum."
"apparently i'm one of the only people who doesn't like this place.  i think it might be because i didn't order chicken?  i got the mini buddah bowl (i think was the name) and didn't realize that they put chilled vegetables in there.  so, it was some warm brown rice with cold vegetables that made for a lukewarm meal.  i asked them if they could heat it up because i didn't realize the vegetables were supposed to be cold and the guy behind the counter was really rude about it.  apart from the temperature issue the food itself tasted alright, although the hot sauce that it came with was good.  it was 8 bucks for a meal i could have made at home for about 2 dollars, except it would have been much better at home."
"This review is for someone who enjoys group dining -- even if their diet does not permit them to eat most things on the menu.  Crisp has a good vegetarian/pescetarian selection.  Good flavors, cheap and a fun environment.  The service is great."
"I'm sorry, but this place just didn't do it for me. Well the seoul sassy wings didn't. Now, is that to say I won't be trying this place again? No way, my buddy got the suicide wings and those tasted great. But for me the seoul sassy wings just didn't move me at all."
"Quick serve restaurant, serving tasty korean favorites, including tasty fried chickent and bi bim bop.  The Seoul Sassy fried chicken was terrific.  Next visit I will be taking down the bi bim bop and hopefully have room for another serving of the chicken.  Bright, clean restaurant with friendly service."
"I love fried food, especially fried chicken.  And this place has some of the best fried chicken in Chicago.  Cool, quick affordable and delicious. Be aware its a little cramped and they close at 9."
I was really excited to try this new restaurant in my neighborhood.   I was kind of disappointed.  We got bud's buffalo and the original bad boy buddha.  The bad boy buddha came cold - i totally didnt expect that.  I just didn't like it because of that - I felt like I was eating ketchup with rice and vegetables.  The chicken was okay - and the sauce normal.  Just didn't love it.  And felt it was kind of expensive too for what I got.
"So I ordered from here having no idea what to expect. I didn't know that Koreans had their own special niche of fried chicken. I also have no idea what bi bim bop is. But I do know that I seriously love fried chicken in all of it's forms.We got a half chicken of the plain jane, as well as some Seoul Sassy wings. The plain jane is seriously, seriously plain. I feel like they should have a disclaimer on the menu : 'We mean it when we say plain - no really. Get some sauce with this."" The batter didn't have much taste to it, so it was my own dumb fault for not getting some sauce. The chicken comes in small pieces, not a whole breast and a leg or whatnot that you might be expecting. However - the chicken was perfectly cooked, and very yummy once I threw a little sauce on it. My only quam was that it was some tiny little bones in there. I'm just grossed out by chicken bones. My own weird thing. So if you're expecting some KFC out of this place, you're wrong. But in a good way.Now the wings- Oh my god, the wings. It's a whole, huge, giant wing. I'd hate to see the chicken this wing came off of, it must have been 6 feet tall. The wings were amazingly crispy, even after coming through a sauce bath. The 'Seoul Sassy'  sauce was awesome! It was sweet and spicy and tasted a little bit like soy sauce, and didn't leave the chicken dripping. Just the right amount of sauce. So so so good. Also, the owners / workers / whoever was there are the nicest! They also seem to take great care in packing up the chicken so it stays crispy by the time you get it home. It was also really good, and still crispy, after I put it through the torture that is my microwave, for some late night seconds. I'll definitely be back here to try the rest of the sauces."
"I am so glad I found this place! This place has some of the best chicken I've ever tasted. Also, they give you so much. I suggest sharing a meal with someone as the portions they give are substantial for 2-3 people. The staff is also very friendly and accommodating. I've come back to this place over and over despite the hard to find parking in the area."
"Crisp clearly does not need any more 5-star reviews on Yelp, and I wouldn't bother writing this review, even though I love them, if it wasn't for a particularly awesome sauce customer service experience. We went in on a Thursday night, around 7:30, and the place was packed as usual for that time. After ordering and finding a seat, we wait for around 10 minutes for our food and I notice others who ordered after us are getting their orders. I thought there might have been an issue with our order, but before I could say anything, a guy (I assume a manager) and tells us there was a mix up, our food is on it's way and we are free to help ourselves to anything from the beverage case, and help ourselves to the popsicle case on our way out. We graciously accepted the offer and our food arrived maybe 5 minutes later. This, people, is simple customer service that so many places just don't get. Very often, people's beef with a place here on Yelp has to do with poor customer service, and their issue could probably be resolved by an establishment making any kind of effort to right the issue. In this case, it's not like we made any kind of fuss about the non-issue, but they recognize that they made a (very minor) mistake and were proactive at addressing that. Crisp gets it. Plus their food is fucking top notch."
"a total non believer i  thought this was an imitation korean joint...OMG the food was so good (even slightly better than my Auntie Park) The budda bowls aka bim bim bop was really fresh and well seasoned I got mine with the beef, it is a meal in itself.  the bbq chx wings were a bit spicy for my asian tongue but my bf wolfed them down......saves us a trip to H-Mart!! a bit pricy, $25 for two items but will be back when i'm in the hood!"
"This place is outstanding!  I've only tried the wings but I've been VERY pleased every time.  John who runs the place is about as helpful as they come.  Incredibly knowledgeable and pointed us in the right direction on our first visit.  I've been back once since and was able to try a few more sauces.  The people claiming the wings at Crisp aren't that great probably eat wings at BW3!! (weak)  When it comes to wings Crisp has a style all their own and they do it to perfection.  If you haven't been yet, you need to."
"I went to Crisp for lunch with a friend a few weeks back and really enjoyed it!  I ordered the Baby Buddha Bowl and was quite surprised that it was a ""mini"" version of anything.  I couldn't even finish all of the food, which was pretty tasty.  I liked the flavors and the fact that it was packed with veggies.  It seemed like quite a healthy meal and was only $6.  The guy at the counter was very friendly.  I will definitely go back again soon!"
"This food is super addictive. The Seoul Sassy is my favorite; it's sweet and has just the right amount of sauce. Also, the BBQ is good if you're looking for a little heat. I also tried the Baby Buddha which which I like because it fills you up, but doesn't leave you feeling uncomfortably full. My only complaint about Crisp, and the reason they got 4 instead of 5 stars, is that the people who take orders are pretty unhelpful and rude. They try to rush you off the phone and they aren't too happy about answering simple questions, but besides that  I love their food."
"Whenever I have my bibimbop(buddha bowl) craving I go here.  I love their brown rice option for the bowls and they give you a hefty portion of bulgogi(marianted beef).  I've also tried their seoul sassy and the plain jane; both really good.Atmosphere is great  and lively.  One drawback is that it can get pricey...but nevertheless, worth every penny!"
"A solid three stars. Five stars for the Seoul Sassy chicken which is VERY addicting and delicious. I'd have given Crisp more, but the Seoul Sassy is what really gets me to go out of my way to come here. Everything else is just OK, just nothing special flavor-wise. But I do appreciate the brown rice option AND the nice employees."
"I moved from Los Angeles, expecting NOT to find any good asian food joint near my place in lakeview.....WRONG!  Quote, Kat Williams, ""This is my shit!!!""  I didn't think I'd find a korean fried chicken joint!  I ordered their wings, 1/2 dry and 1/2 garlic sauce and it reminded me of my mom's cooking.  It is THAT good!  Then I took a whole chicken home, 1/2 korean sassy and 1/2 garlic and it did not disappoint, even when eaten cold.  I will however recommend you eat at the place your first time.  Taking food to go will always lower its quality, since it will lose its heat and initial texture from frying.  The owner was very friendly too.  This is my new weekly spot!"
"This place is amazing! The wings are HUGE. I made the mistake of ordering a 10 piece assuming the wings were on the small side. Big mistake! The wings are a drummette and a wing in one. So it was almost like I ordered a 20 piece. Seriously, the biggest wings I have ever had. I had the Seoul Sassy and BBQ sauce upon the employee's recommendation. Very good, can't wait to try the rest of the sauces. The magic mushrooms were amazing as well. I wish they had a place like this in W. Park. It is definitely worth the trip to Lakeview and I can't wait to go back!!"
"The wings are huge, delicious, and well-priced. I haven't had anything else there, so this review is mostly for the wings.  The employees are friendly and helpful (my first time in the cashier gave me sauce on the side to try when I asked her about the spice difference).  Even when it's crowded at lunch time, the wings come out in about 10 minutes."
"Not quite sure what I can say besides YUMMY. Came here for dinner one night after seeing all the yelp reviews. I ordered a whole funke chicken, but split up with 2 sauces, then got a beef bowl for 2. Plenty left over for lunch the next day! The chicken lives up to its name with the crispiness and the sauces are unique with asian twists. We got the bbq and the seoul sassy. I was hoping for bi bim bop with the beef bowl but I ordered wrong and all I got was rice and beef. Still really delicious, but I really wanted my vegetables and raw egg!! I talked to the owner who is helpful and friendly and I'm ready to order the next time I come in. Prices are great, check out their menu online. Sadly they don't deliver just yet, but when and if they do, they will get my 5 stars. BI BIM BOP at my door?? AWESOMENESS."
The fried chicken (Seoul Sassy) was amazing!  We ordered 1/2 of a chicken for carry-out and the food was fast and delicious and I'm kind of a foodie.  We also ordered the Seoul Steak bowl and it was decent but nothing that special.  Will return to try the Buddha bowls and for more chicken!
"this place is very cool. the wings are tasty and big. i had the seoul sassy and bbq.  these flavors are pretty unique when compared to wingstop, buff joes, or bww. other people were getting the bowls which i thing are also great but i havent tried it.  overall these wings are pretty good and bigger than other places that sell wings. parking can be a hassle, what else is new in lakeview. the seating is limited with a community style seating  arrangement and some seating at the wall. the employees are cool too. i recommend."
"I think crisp is great, the food is wonderful and affordable.  The owner is always there and very friendly."
"Best wings in the city, hands down. Great service, relaxed atmosphere, BYOB, delicious food...what's not to love?"
"I tried Crisp after reading all the great reviews it recieved. I ordered the Chicken wings in Seoul Sassy, plain and spicy I also ordered the buddah bowl. I didn't like the buddah bowl at all. I thought the chicken was well seasoned and had great flavor, but that it was to dry. I have tried the place twice and both times the chicken was dry, so this is not a place I will go out of my way to go back to. I will say the guy behind the counter was fabulous....very friendly"
"For the dollars, this place is quick and good for a grab and go korean bbq bowl.  Not super authentic, but gives me the fix and fill when I need it."
"I love going here directly after working out at Bally's. The owner, Dan, is really friendly and is always smoking cigarettes and talking on the cell phone outside. The Seoul Sassy and BBQ wings are excellent. The Baby Buddha is excellent as well. It did get quite busy after Hungry Hound gave it  high marks, but business has since plateaued."
"My wife & I were FLOORED at how good the food was here!  I ordered the ""Wacky Wacky Wings"" (yes, that's the name!), which consisted of a heaping dozen chicken wings, half that were baked in a special chili sauce, and the other half in a sweet glaze.  I was in HEAVEN! My wife ordered the ""Bad Boy"", a rice bowl dish consisting of multitude of vegetables, a fried egg, and a side of chili sauce, all to be mixed into a scrumptious mishmash of flavor and spiciness!  Crisp is highly recommended!  Jae & Doug, I live way up in Portage Park, but the drive to Crisp will be well worth the trip! See you again soon!"
"I really love this place... my favorite is the mild buffalo sauce..it's still spicy but not too spicy to overwhelm the flavor of the sauce, which has a perfect blend of vinegar and spices.. the spicy sauce is a little too spicy for me, and I like spicy food.. the chicken is perfect.. and lives up to the name.  It's crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I also love the buddha...so flavorful and the veggies are extremely fresh.  my advice is to order both the buddha and the chicken and share them with your significant other.   A half chicken and a buddha is a good amount of food for 2. To make things even better, they deliver!"
"Get the Chicken Seoul Sassy or Plain Jane, Mmm.. its good.  Also the Kimchi is the good kind, try it and dont be afraid.  Being Korean-American i grew up on Kimchi and many places dont do the kimchi right, or get the ""good stuff"""
"I'm definitely a fan.  The fried chicken is fried at the perfect amount - it's definitely not KFC chicken.  I love the tangy sauce too.  Try the mushrooms as well, which are really good.  It's a bit of a messy/crowded/sharing experience if you go on a weekend night, but I supposed that's part of the charm.  It's also not as cheap as I expected, but it's not outrageous either.  Expect to spend $10/person or so.  For something a bit different and relaxed, I'd check out Crisp."
as much as id like to take credit for those chicken strips (jessicas) i cant lol thier wings and strips are fiiiireeee!!!! i looooove them and their fries!. im not too fond of thier bowls though bu overall def kudos to them
"This is one of the truly best small ethnic spots in Chicago.  Lots of good traditional Korean options on the menu, but you're supposed to order the chicken.  It is superb.  The bi bim bap is also delicious, and the owners are extremely personable, making for a very enjoyable casual dining experience.  I would probably eat here a couple times/week if it were closer to me.  If you want an excellent example of contemporary Korean cuisine, this is probably your best choice outside of LA."
i really liked the Seoul sassy chicken. cant wait to try the other sauces. i do wish they served beer but...i would definitely go again.
"crisp was overly hyped that i wasn't super impressed with the food.we had seoul sassy chicken, crisp bbq chicken, seoul sensation burritos, fries, and the radish kimchee. the chicken was nicely fried, but the sauces were a bit too sweet and generic for my liking. the seoul sassy chicken had a spicy pork bulgogi marinade and the crisp bbq chicken had a bulgogi marinade. the burritos were stuffed with extremely fresh ingredients, but it tasted like bibimbop in a tortilla. the fries and radish kimchee were extremely good.overall, crisp has good and fresh food, but i don't think i'll proactively seek out or crave it. definitely a place worth trying!"
"Both of the guys at the counter said their favorite thing on the menu is the wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce, so that's what I ordered. Fantastic. Crisp (who would've guessed), meaty, juicy, and I made a complete mess. The communal tables only add to the fun."
"What can I say that hasn't been covered before? They have very tasty chicken and the fries are good. They offer a take on Be Bim Bop, which is Yummers. The owner works the cash register and is friendly. We've recommended it to lot of people. Good Times"
"There's only so many places you can go for this kind of stuff.  This is a neighborhood gem, and I hope the business keeps going strong.  I can't wait to go back."
"where i'm from, korean fried chicken is waaaay better than crisp.  i have to admit, crisp is pretty decent and their wings are HUGE, but the seoul sassy sauce is too sweet for what it should be.  and who doesn't serve moo (korean pickled radish) with korean fried chicken?!?!  and since when does putting 37484983 different toppings on bibimbap make it good?  but since this is probably the best spot in chicago for this kind of fried chicken, it will have to suffice until i go back to los angeles where kyochon and bonchon know how to make korean fried chicken right!"
"Crisp is right across the street from Soup Box which in the summer makes the perfect combo - grab some food at Crisp and then pick up an icy fruit at Soup Box for dessert. Korean food isn't usually something I'm on the look out for but something about Crisp pulled me in. The place was pretty busy when I walked in and I took that as a good sign. I ordered the original buddha bowl. You can add meat or tofu for an extra $1. I decide to skip it. Also wanting to the try the kimchi so I got a side of it.  The buddha bowl, kimchi and water came out to $14. Seemed a tad on the high side but then I saw the amount of food that came out it was a deal. The bowls are huge! And the side of kimchi is also big, it was way more kimchi then I wanted, even if it was really good. The buddha bowl was a solid choice and I'm glad I shared it with my fiancée since it was a lot of food. Crisp is a pretty good choice for some eats and I can seen myself hitting it up again soon."
"That first bite...when your Crisp korean fried chicken cherry is popped...is a sensation unlike any other.  If you've never had Korean style fried chicken, like us on our first visit, no words (certainly not by this author) will be articulate enough to describe the crunchy, saucy, moist, spicy, sweet, salty absolutely contradictory combination of flavors dancing some sort of Korean pop dance (a la Hyori, Se7en, etc) on your tongue.  It's simply fantastic.  Get their Seoul Sassy chicken, get a whole chicken, bring lots of friends and lots of alcohol, and your night will be off to a great start...guaranteed.  Their Buddha Bowls (Korean Bi Bim Bop with a twist) is decent, only because if you've had Bi Bim Bop, you expect meat and rice in a sizzling hot stone bowl and the cold veggies in a cold metal bowl that show up, no matter how well marinated and flavored, just don't quite meet those expectations.  Have yet to try the other stuff as the Seoul Sassy is just so good, but will definitely be back for more.  Take heed, they are closed on Mondays.  You don't want to be knocking on a dark storefront at 8PM on a Monday starving and craving Crisp, only left to feel like Harold and Kumar when they realized that their White Castle was replaced by some cheap burger joint."
"I'm from L.A. and Korean fried chicken is very popular there. I heard of this place through my friends and decided to check it out. It beats the best places in L.A.!  The sauce is what makes it the best. The food stayed good until I got home. The skin stayed crispy.  Price was reasonable, in L.A. it would cost about $35 for one order and I had to wait an hour. The service was excellent! Talk to the owners!  They were great!"
