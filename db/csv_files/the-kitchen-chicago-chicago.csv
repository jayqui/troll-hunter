The Kitchen Chicago
"Ohhhh my god. I'm SO picky when it comes to eating out. But the food, service, quality of ingredients, ambience. Oh dear lord. I'm going to go broke. I'm going to be here too much. Came here for Sunday brunch, little tip, there's free parking in the lot next to the restaurant on Sunday mornings ONLY. Excellent excellent sincere friendly servers and staff. Our server was Levi. Very attentive without being suffocating. Extremely knowledgeable about all the ingredients and dishes. He knew what to suggest, and where the ingredients were sourced from. Came with my husband, he got a coffee (dark roast, said it was one of the best coffees he's had and he's a coffee snob and addict). For starters I got a butter croissant which they make in house and serve with a spiced apricot spread. Best damn croissant I ever had. So good we got another one (mostly because my husband kept sneaking some of mine haha). Flaky, buttery, warm, made in house, fresh to order. My fingertips had just the right amount of sheen that comes with the perfect ratio of high quality butter to dough. Next he got the granola parfait. Absolutely delicious. Served in a mason jar with ample amounts of vanilla bean specks. Their dishes are not made haphazardly. There's a lot of thought that goes into what ingredients harmonize and complement each other. I felt like I was dining in a restaurant in which pintrest came to life!Entrees: husband got the Gouda omlette which is prepared French style. Lighter fluffier, but just as filing. Came with roasted potatoes which I might be wrong but had a delicious spin on it (smoked and topped with fleur de gris salt+ house made ketchup) and a small side of mixed salad greens tossed with a little olive oil and lemon and salt. I got a Dutch pancake. The most perfect Dutch pancake on this side of the world. Topped with fresh ricotta, fresh mint pieces and house made raspberry sauce.Dessert: Affagato with espresso poured table side. Heaven on earth.TL;DR: Go here for weekend brunch, free parking if early enough, excellent attention to detail, ingredients, service and ambience.  Get the croissants, hell, get two. Order anything-- it'll all be delicious!"
"Fantastic views and good food. We had oysters, which consisted of three varieties- each one, perfect. The wine selection was diverse; we chose a Monastrell varietal. I ate from the apps and charcuterie options because nothing on the main menu appealed to me. However the restaurant's specialty (a pasta bolognese with three meats) that my hubby had was very good, but very rich. Also had a delicious chocolate dessert. Finally, our server was attentive, helpful and indulged us in all of our questions and comments about every conceivable topic. Overall the service and location, and some of the menu options make this a 4 for me."
"A very nice setting, although the noise level was a bit high for conversation.Orders were VERY slow coming out of the kitchen.Food was good, but not particularly good value."
"4 star food, 3 star service. Food: the goat cheese gougere were phenomenal, and the troffie alla bolognese was also very good. I was less impressed by the hummus (cold grainy hummus, charred cold bread) and roasted beet appetizers (although the beet fan seemed to quite enjoy them). Service-wise things could have been improved. Our water glasses were often empty. (The glasses themselves are also tiny, which bothered me.) We sat for quite a while before ordering. That said, some of the  food was quite good, and I would be willing to give it another shot."
"So after posting about our not so awesome brunch experience, Mike contacted me and invited us in again.We went in on a Friday evening.  I still LOVE the inside of the place.  Beautiful and location right on the river makes it so nice.We were treated like royalty.  They brought out apps and drinks and were really going above and beyond for us.  Everyone that came to our table was amazing.Dinner service was delicious!  Everything we had was great.House Made olivesKing crab...so sweet and huge!  Might've been the best crab I've ever had.Mussels...pretty good.  Lots of broth to dunk the hearty bread in.Gouda croquettes...very tastySirloin with the ribeye presentation was an amazing steak.  They cut it for us...which normally I do not like, BUT this was cooked to perfection.Swordfish was perfectly cooked as well. Lemon tarte for dessert was the finish of our amazing meal there.I definitely want to go back for brunch.  Last time, I wasn't aware that they had just started serving brunch.  I'm sure by now, they've worked out the kinks.Any restaurant that reaches out to patrons like this one, deserves a 5 star in my book.  They definitely aim to please!"
I was in Chicago on a recent trip with 11 other family members.  We hadn't planned out any of our meals and ignored the fact that it would be close to impossible to get a reservation for 12 people on a Saturday night on the same day we planned to go out.  That's where The Kitchen came into play.  It was easy to get a reservation and we were promptly seated when we showed up.  We had a dedicated server who made excellent suggestions for each course and even the drinks we ordered to accompany our meals.  The service and food was impeccable and I will surely make a trip here again the next time I stop into Chicago.
"Love this place! From the ambiance to the service and food, everything was awesome! Very creative salads and small plates as well."
"I came to The Kitchen with two of my clients and upon walking in I was struck by how sleek and cool the decor was. The hostess was friendly and offered to check my coat...for free (score)!Our server Jonathan was pretty awesome ensuring that all of our questions regarding the menu were answered and that our glasses remained full.Overall, I give The Kitchen 3 stars. Since I gave up drinking for Lent I wasn't able to sample any of their drinks (bummer).For our meal we got:Appetizers* Slagel Farms Fries Pig Ears - they were a little chewy and didn't really taste like anything. The paprika aioli definitely gave them flavor.  2.5 stars* Goat Gouda Gougere - these cheese balls sounded delicious when our server described them to us, yet when we tasted them we thought they were meh. If the cheese was melted and gooey, they would have been two thumbs up. 2 stars* White Bean Bruschetta - well I think this is what it was called. My clients loved this dish and said they would definitely get it again. 4 stars (so said my clients)Entree* Slagel Farm Braised Pork Shoulder - a little fatty, but the meat was so tender and the polenta it was resting on enhanced the dish that much more. 4 stars* Trofie Alla Bolognese - was oh so good. The beef, pork and lamb meat mix was unexpectedly delicious. Highly recommend this dish. 5 stars* Moser Brothers Half Chicken - nothing special. The chicken could have been cooked a little longer. 2.5 starsDessert* Sticky Toffee Pudding - it was OK, but would have been so much better if the pudding was hot instead of lukewarm. Funny thing about this dessert is that when our server came over to ask if we wanted dessert and we asked for the Sticky Toffee Pudding he told us they were all out. I found this mind boggling as it was only 6:42pm so how could they already be out of a dessert. After sitting and chatting for about 20 minutes the manager came over to ask how our meal was and I told him about how I couldn't understand how they were out of a dessert so early in the night. He went and spoke to the kitchen and came back telling us he would be bringing us one over shortly (FREE). When the dessert came over it was...as I mentioned above lukewarm. We couldn't understand how the dessert was lukewarm if it had just been made. 2.5 stars"
"I thought the ambiance was awesome here, beautiful high ceilings, open kitchen, situated on the river, beautiful new furniture, had a very contemporary/sophisticated feel. The wine menu was pretty legit. They had at least 5-6 wines by the glass, an entire page of wines by the bottle and a variety of beers too. We started with the garlic fries, the mussels, and the baby gem lettuce. The fries were big and handcut and tasted fresh, which was nice. I asked about some garlic aoli on the side, which was tasty. Nothing special here. The mussels were okay, I've had better. Nothing to rave about. The baby gem lettuce was tasty, kinda bland, I could have had this dish anywhere. It was lettuce, radishes, and croutons in a light dressing. Eh.I was not that hungry so I ended up with the fava bean and pea bruschetta for dinner. One large piece of bread with fava beans mashed with peas to create a heavy mashed potato like texture ontop of a large piece of baked bread. It was actually more filling than I thought it would be. My friends ordered the pork shoulder and the beef ribeye, which looked pretty good. The entrees were pretty hearty, filling dishes. Service was decent, not great. Overall I was a little dissapointed with the menu too. Limited options and everything we ordered was pretty run of the mill. I think the place has a lot of potential, I really liked the raw seafood options. Overall though, I think it fails a bit short."
"Went with friends on a Tuesday dinner.  Very pleased with the food and setting.  I am someone who doesn't mind spending on great food.  For 3 of us it was 210 for apps, entrees and dessert. We each had a drink.  The food was small portioned even though the server said they were normal sized.  And it was not spectacular so I was kind of surprised at how high it was.  Regardless, the highlights were the oysters, the bruschetta, the halibut was delish and so was the Torfie Alla Bolognese.  Our server was kind of rude and that was off putting.  The more he realized we were foodies the more his attitude showed.  I generally get the opposite reaction from servers.  IDK if I will return.  I think Kinmont or GT Fish are better options for similar food!"
"Seared rushing waters trout! Brown butter sauce, chokes. Yeah. Did you see that?Again. Seared rushing waters trout! Brown butter sauce, chokes.It took a few nibbles but in a wonderful way, this trout dish has hints of lemon pound cake batter and that's likely from the marriage of walnuts and lemon zest. I'm a sucker for savory dishes that can pull off making you think about a nice dessert, without going too far. At home, a dash or two of cinnamon makes its way into my homemade dijon and oatmeal flake albacore croquettes.And they are serving up bright and lively Kickapoo espresso and I begged them to open up first thing in the mornings because no one else in River North is stepping up to THAT level. 0_0Lindsay's behind the bar and I walk in at 11am open. This is the old Bob Chinn's location on Clark at the Chicago River and someone has really transformed this slice that sits underneath Encyclopædia Britannica into a more modern, industrial,  very open, airy, welcoming version of Atwood Cafe... a visual sense, that is.Can't wait to go back and try the lamb burger. Love my city."
"This place was pretty good. The location is very pretty right on the river, and the interior atmosphere is very nice. Servers were pretty friendly, if a bit slow to check on drinks. The food was nice, but not really noteworthy. Hummus was ok, bread was good. Trofie alla Bolognese was easily the best entree. Sirloin was pretty good. The pork chop, after telling the waiter we were hesitant to get pork chop because they are so often tough and dry, and being assured this one was very tender and juicy was... as they almost always are.. tough and dry. They had some interesting sounding cocktails, but the one someone tried was pretty ho-hum. Good beer list though. It's a nice place, I'd go back if someone wanted to, but wouldn't seek it out. Also worth noting that despite the great location right on the river, they have no outdoor seating."
"Perfect. Simply perfect.I made a reservation a week in advance using OpenTable and included a special request of a river view table and a note that we were celebrating a birthday. When we arrived, we were greeted warmly and taken to our table, which was exactly what I had requested. There was a gift bag on the table -- some friends of mine arranged to have my gift waiting on our table, the staff was incredibly helpful. Our server was exceptional and knowledgeable. And what she didn't know about -- wine -- she was able to quickly resolve by having the sommelier at our table. The sommelier was great. She answered our questions, gave good descriptions of wine that fit what we were looking for, and made several recommendations. It's worth mentioning that their beer and cocktail lists are both quite impressive, as is the wine list.We started with two items from the Nibbles menu -- an order of marinated olives and the garlic fries. The marinated olives were excellent and there was a good variety of olive types. The garlic fries were outstanding, fried to a golden crispness. The homemade ketchup on the side was really good. I like my ketchup a little smoother -- this had a tomato puree consistency -- but the flavor was out of this world.I ordered the sirloin for dinner, which was served with kale and mashed rutabaga. The sirloin was cooked perfectly and seasoned well without being overpowering. The mashed rutabaga was really good -- just a hint of that natural sweetness of the rutabaga. And the kale was steamed and briny. Everything worked well on the plate together.My husband ordered the rib-eye, which came with a Bernaise sauce on the side. His steak was melt-in-your-mouth good, even without the sauce. His came with fingerling potatoes, which were pan fried. They were hot and crispy. For dessert (hey, it was my birthday!), we split the sticky toffee pudding. I liked it more than my husband did, but I'm much more of a caramel/toffee/etc person than he is. Truly, it's a beautiful restaurant, the food was outstanding, and the service impeccable. We'll definitely be back. Thanks for an amazing birthday celebration!"
Came here for birthday brunch and was greeted with champagne! The venue is just beautiful and has a dressed up yet urban loft/industrial feel. The design makes this place such a treat to have a meal at!Ordered a few different oysters (thumbs up!) All tasted fresh.The bread served is of the healthier variety with grains/seeds.I had the grilled uplands bacon plate. The bacon was spot on delicious. The eggs felt overdone and the grits were a strange texture in combination with the syrup but overall it did taste hearty.  The star of the meal was the pasta dish: Trofie Alla Bolognese. The meat sauce is perfect with the spiral like noodles. I would come back again for this dish. Wish I had tried a few other dishes since I was so impressed with the pasta but not necessarily the uplands bacon. Service was good and waitress was knolwedgeable about the menu. Very happy this new restaurant opened in River North!
"I was recently taken here for a work lunch and fell in love with the decor the minute I walked in. Beautifully rustic, yet chic. I immediately was wishing I was there to have drinks at the bar, but while my lunch was with someone from my ad agency - sadly it wasn't a Don Draper style lunch.I should say that while I'm clearly a sucker for great decor, I'm just as much of a fool for the concept of sourcing from reputable farms, local and seasonal when possible etc. So that definitely means my experience and review has a positive bias before I even take a bite.Food was good, but there are still a few minor opportunities to improve upon. We started with the hummus - it was good, but not as yummy as you'd find in a middle eastern restaurant (never is anywhere). It's served with a great grainy bread.The quiche was amazing. Rich and creamy and served with a nice side of greens with a very light vinaigrette. My colleague ordered the salmon salad, which should be called a salmon filet with a few greens. Seriously - this was the most perplexing thing at the meal. She's ordered it before, so she knew what to expect and warned me when I was considering it - but really? I kid you not - it was a smallish, delicious salmon filet on a plate with an ever so petite side of greens. There were more greens with my quiche than her SALMON SALAD. Greens are relatively inexpensive so I'm not sure why they aren't putting more greens on the plate. It was half empty, maybe it's a minimalist aesthetic? She enjoys the salmon, so she was OK - but it definitely was cause for an eye roll when it was set down at the table.I'd like to go back sometime for drinks after work or dinner and try some other dishes.The moral of this story - check this place out, but beware if you're considering a salad and order an extra helping if you actually like greens ;)Update- the GM of the restaurant messages me and said he would connect with their chef about the salmon salad- it's a great sign they are listening!"
"The Kitchen Chicago is, without a doubt, one of the most gorgeous restaurants in Chicago.  Unfortunately,  almost all of the tables for two have one chair facing a wall or obstructed view, so come with friends (so you can get a larger table) if you really want to enjoy the room.My friend and I each had a martini, and the bar has a generous pour.  Cocktail prices are affordable, especially compared to the competition in the neighborhood.  The bar is lively, and it would be a fun place to stop after work for a few appetizers.Our dinner started with the chicory appetizer, which was totally without taste... maybe because someone forgot to add the pickled onion and lardo.   The Kitchen redeemed itself  with the garlic fries, which were perfection.  The pork entree had a wonderful flavor, but was very overcooked.   Good thing we saved room for desert, their justifiably famous sticky toffee pudding... outstanding.    (My friend had just returned from several months in England, where sticky pudding is all the rage, and she said this one puts the others to shame.)Our waitress was excellent.  Other than a long wait for coffee and no offer of a refill, we had no complaints.My friend said she won't come back, but I'm going to give The Kitchen another try.  With so many good reviews, it's possible the chef was having an off evening, which can happen at any restaurant.  Unless you want a long wait, make a reservation.  Ours was for 6:30, and the restaurant was almost filled when we arrived."
Had a really good meal here! Unfortunately my friend has a food allergy so we couldn't try all the dishes we wanted. Really enjoyed the mussels and the halibut. Drinks were good too. Excellent service and cool ambiance.
"Really loved this new place located in the Reid Murdoch building in River North.  The Kitchen Chicago, bills itself as a community bistro and the attitude of the employees clearly demonstrate that.While we had a reservation for a table, we had such a great experience at the bar with the friendly bartenders, that we chose to stay there and order dinner.  And you know it must be a good place to be when the person sitting next to me tells me he works there and decided to have dinner there on his off day.  Now that says something!First up we had some fresh oysters (ask which types they have as they change) as well as the charcuterie plate.  Both were good and the charcuterie plate comes with creamy burrata which was a nice complement to the meats.For our entrees, I had the trofie with bolognese sauce and my friend had the pork shoulder.  Both were delicious!The drinks were perfectly poured and the bartenders were quick to make sure our drinks were never empty.  And while a little on the loud side, once the after work crowd abated, the noise volume dropped to a better level.  Also note that the views of the river are quite nice and while there is not an outdoor patio, the windows do open to let in the great summer breezes.A nice night all the way around!"
"A great new addition to the River North Dining scene. Came here to dine and also on another night for their weekly Monday Community night dinners and had a blast. Community Dinner: Their food tasted very good - I was impressed with the pig trotters we had that night and their cider pairings were good. Come ready to be at least a little bit social. You sit with other people (hence the word community) and one group of people seemed pretty into themselves so they pretty much ignored our existence until the end, but we made friends with the couple sitting on our other side who were great to chat with. The dinner took longer than expected for 4 courses - started at 7 and didn't end until 9/930isj, but we had a really great time. I'd recommend it to anyone. Dinner: We ordered their seafood tower and that was delicious. Their sommelier was also very personable and friendly. Ambiance: Decor is modern w contemporary rustic touches. High ceilings and grey tones all through out. It's a very good place for a date night, an upscale family dinner/dinner with friends or a business meeting."
"What a great addition to River North!  Came here with my parents on Saturday night (weekend of Thanksgiving).  The restaurant is gorgeous -- beautiful chandeliers, high ceilings, and huge windows overlooking the river.  We shared a variety of items for our meal:+ Roasted Nichols Farm Squash Salad: beautiful and delicious.  party in my mouth!+ Ingrid's Bouchot Mussels:  these mussels were so incredibly plump and fresh.  toasted bread was great for sopping up the light and yummy broth.+ Linguine & Nichols Farm Pumpkin: this was my least favorite, but still delicious.  I was hoping for the pasta to be slightly sweeter.+ Whole Roasted Rushing Waters Trout: so, so, so freakin' good.  the brown butter vinaigrette was light and the sunchokes accompanied the fish so perfectly. + Sticky Toffee Pudding:  rich and perfect for sharing.  perfect ending to our mealThe manager came by to see how we were doing -- great touch.  Additionally, all the food came out in a timely manner, however our dessert took 20+ minutes for whatever reason.  Our waiter was kind enough to take off our bill.Overall, wonderful experience.  Can't wait to come back!"
"Back for an update:As I noted above, I really wanted to return to The Kitchen to try the truffle pasta dish and some others. This time, I went for lunch with several other co-workers. I talked up the restaurant but sadly the overall consensus was that the food needed more spice/flavor. They also, again, still did not have the truffle pasta dish (do not be fooled, it is still on their online dinner menu, brace yourself). This time around I settled on the appetizer of Sautéed Mushrooms on Toast.  Toast is actually Texas toast; it is huge and piled high with mushrooms. You must eat with a fork. I love it but was already full. Because they, again, did not have the truffle pasta, I chose their salad special that day of swordfish salad. It was actually a healthy portion that I could not finish (I thought a salad would be a good contrast to the toast and mushrooms). I also learned that I do not like swordfish, too fishy for me. Although, it could have been the contrast with the weird olive dressing they chose. Others around the table opted for the soup of the day (sorry I cannot remember what it was). The soup was bland according to two people. However, it did come with a crab cake which was exciting and good apparently. Another co-worker went with a dish I had last time, the Bolognese. He had a similar experience, the lamb in the dish threw him off, but it was still pretty good. Now that I have missed getting my hands on the elusive truffle pasta dish, I do not know if I will return after two lackluster trips. It is a great location, pretty décor, I just do not want to leave with the *sigh* wondering what could have been, again."
"Three stars?  The best description of this restaurant is a clean overpriced diner with hostesses that look down their noses at patrons that are not wearing the latest Tom Ford jacket to dinner.The food was hit or miss.  We ordered the halibut and the ribeye to share between myself and my girlfriend.  The highlight of the night was the humus appetizer that was surprisingly hearty with a very well developed spice that paired well with the oiled dipping bread.  Also, our waitress was very pleasant throughout the evening.The halibut was incredibly small (4-5oz) and bland.  The crust that was developed on the outside of the fillet was the only saving grace, and it was soggy over most of the dish due to the ill conceived fumet (broth) that the fillet was served floating in.  Not only was the assembly of the dish unappetizing, but it also contributed to muting the only real taste in the whole fillet.The ribeye was ordered medium rare, I know, cliche, but it arrived medium to medium well at our table.  The steak was poorly trimmed with more than 2-3oz of the served meal consisting of thick inedible fat gristle at the margin.  The texture of the steak was superior to expectations and the crust developed on it was delicious, however the full steak was only ~6oz when appropriately trimmed.  Leaving us both at a loss as to exactly what we had paid so much for.Tl;dr:  Overpriced and just okay.  I would suggest it for drinks and appetizers, but go somewhere else for dinner."
"The Kitchen is where everyone should be right now! The restaurant is SPACIOUS and has rustic*modern*chic style with lovely chandeliers throughout. It meets both casual and fine dining options for individuals or groups. Community Hour (a.k.a...Happy Hour) is between 3pm - 5pm, it offers food and drink specials. TK is serving up fine Amerian cuisine. The menu offers a selection of seafood, soups, quiche, lamb burger and other enticing entrees. The food is elegantly served and is matched by its flavor. The atmosphere, food, service and prices  are 5 out of five * * * * *I highly recommend The Kitchen as a great place to take a date or to meet friends for drinks after work. Unique feature: power outlets are located under the bar's countertop for charging your phone or laptop."
"Came to Chicago for a girls weekend to celebrate the many life events of our crew...babies, weddings, jobs...Made a rez at this new restaurant and decided to come check it out. We were all so blown away by the ambiance, decor and service.Oysters were delishFries super hot and Mussels so yummyHighly recommend the HalibutAbove all, the service, by the manager Paul was outstanding. We are California girls who each have some form of food allergy or restriction and our entire group of six felt so taken care.  This on behalf of six women who like to eat drink and enjoy good atmosphere Thankyou Paul it was a pleasure!!"
"I came here on a weekday night for dinner, luckily we had reservations for 6:30pm, or else I think we would have ended up waiting for a table. The location is gorgeous, since it's located right near the river overlooking the riverbank.  The interior of this restaurant is also light and airy, with tons of space and high ceilings.  I love how they have plenty of different areas to sit at, depending on what kind of dinner you want to have.  We ordered the charcuterie plate for an appetizer ( $18), this plate came with 3 pieces of toasted bread, prosciutto, salami, olives, pickles, and burrata.  This dish was perfect for an appetizer, my fave being the burrata of course. For starters we ordered the white bean bruschetta ($12), and the seared pork tenderloin ( $14).  The white bean bruschetta was disappointing because it just felt so dense and heavy.  It was also on one piece of toast as opposed to how bruschetta is originally presented which is on small bite size pieces of toast. The seared pork tenderloin was soo tender and tasty, it only came with 6 1/4 inch thick pieces though so I felt that the portion was pretty small for the price.  This dish was topped with chopped up boiled eggs, and pickles. We split the seared brown sugar sunchokes trout ( $27), which is a MUST GET.  This dish was above and beyond any type of white trout I have tried.  The skin was super crispy, and the sunchokes added the perfect crunch to the dish.. The flesh of the fish was cooked perfectly as well, no mushiness here!  For dessert, we ordered the brown sticky toffee pudding with vanilla gelato ($6).  The vanilla gelato was super icey, and not gelato textured at all.  The pudding itself was amazing though, I was expecting it be alot sweeter than the name presented it to be.  However it was the perfect balance of sweet and pastry. I look forward to coming here again, probably will try the slagel farms fried pig ears, and the wild mushroom & french black truffle tagliatelle!"
"Review is for the brunch menu.Food - four stars.  Crabcake Benedict was good to quite good.  No bacon available on any entree or as a side, which enraged my girlfriend.  Potatoes were fried tater-totty cubes and I ate every last one.Ambiance- four stars.  It's in a lovely area of the city, dining area is adorned with ornate chandeliers... but not warm and homey in the slightest, which I suppose is my preference for comfort food.  Was quiet and not crowded, however, and therefore incredibly easy to get a table - even on a Sunday at 1130 there was no wait!  Service- four stars.  Our waitress was very professional but not warm.  I like friendly brunch servers but there were no deficits otherwise... She was attentive and our service was rapid.Bloody Mary- zero stars!  I've never met a Bloody Mary I didn't like.. til this fateful Sunday.  Ugh, not spicy at all and was reminiscent of a cucumber slushie.  Barely liquid- the cucumber pulp kept clogging my straw.  Note to 711... Do not add as a wildcard flavor."
"What a great new place for a nice lunch with friends or business colleagues. Clean and fresh atmosphere, flooded with natural light,  that is still casual.  Similar feel to Summer House in Lincoln Park. Menu has a nice balance of options that are healthy (boiled salmon, wheat berries with winter veg) and more decadent (burgers and sandwiches with fries). Food had good flavor and was filling without putting you into a food coma. Prices can be a bit steep for the regular lunch. Reservations are accepted, but there are also spaces at the counter or high top tables that would be available for walk-ins."
"My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday dinner per my choice and love of seafood. It was a drizzly day and I was battling a case of the allergies, but I couldn't be kept away. We were seated promptly. The decor was simple, open, warm, and inviting. Our waiter was very nice and offered good recommendations. I started with the mussels which were delicious, and I kept the bread to dip in the sauce. I had looked over at the table next to us that ordered the seafood platter and decided that the portion of king crab legs would probably not be enough to subside my hunger pangs. Yep, so I got 2 entrees - this might be a first for me. I got the king crab legs and the fish. Admittedly, I was full after the crablegs but after the fish was placed on the table I cleared that as well. Of course, I was stuffed to the gills and couldn't fit in dessert."
"I visited the kitchen on a Friday during lunch with one other friend. We did not have a reservation but they were able to give us one of the tables near the bar (high stools, no  backs) right away. This place has been open for about four months and some how, even being so close to my office I had missed it. I was extremely impressed walking in and seeing the clean lines, big bright space. The food...- Oysters, lots of variety, interesting mignonette sauce ... not what you typically see but lots of flavor- White Bean Bruschetta, so so - seems like a great concept but white beans really just don't have a lot of flavor. I salted it and it was a bit better- Roasted Organic Beet Salad with Salmon, delicious beets but the salmon was so dry, way too dry- Chicken Curry Chicken Salad, really enjoyed this dish. Interesting twist on chicken salad - not quite as mayonnaise-y as what your mom used to make. I never get dessert at lunch but the waitress insisted & we tried the sticky toffee pudding - wow this was pretty incredible. I said I would only have one bite and could not stop! I would love to go back, seems like a great happy hour spot or place to bring clients!"
"Stunning space, gorgeous views, beautiful lighting/interior design. Lots of items can be made vegan...I emailed the restaurant and they let me know all the items on the menu that were or could be modified, with the recommend of the portabello/hummus sandwich sans cheese. The other items were the farrotto w/squash & chickpeas, fries, hummus, beets, olives, wild mushrooms on toast & white bean bruscetta. And a salad. So, I started w/the marinated olives (awesome) and had the portabello/hummus sandwich w/o the cheese. It was fab...the mushrooms were nice and meaty and had a ton of flavor, and the grilled bread it came on was delicious and had a nice brushing of olive oil.I actually loved it all so much that I came back the next day and ordered the exact same thing (w/different company). We got the ploughman plate which was a  mix of charcuterie, cheeses, pickled items, chutney and marcona almonds. The almonds, chutney and pickled items were great, and they polished off the cheese and meats. My boyfriend loved his tomato soup, and my dad raved about the quiche.Looking forward to going back! Great service, very friendly and all their by the glass wine is on tap. Also, their fries are some of the best I've had...perfectly crispy but not over-fried w/house-made ketchup."
"Wow... this is the first time in a LOOOOOONNNNNNNNNG time I have been truly happy with my experience at a new restaurant. We walked in and were greeted by two hostesses. They were unable to seat us but explained that we could have full service sitting at the bar AND that there were open seats. So we did that. Our bartender immediately brought us drink menus and water. He asked if we were going to dine with him and brought food menus when we said yes. I liked a lot of things on their drink menu but I completely recommend you getting (if you dont like sweet drinks, like me!) is the Winter G&T. It is AMAZING! Its Beefeaters Gin marinated clove, cinnamon, star anise, mixed with a little tonic and topped with a orange twist for a citric aromatic touch! To top it off the drink come in a LARGE stemmed, goblet wine glass so you don't have to get your hands cold or wet every time you pick it up. PEEERRRFECT! The next best part was that I, as a vegetarian, I had plenty of options to pic from for dinner. I ended up ordering the Beets and the Wheatberries. What supprised me the most was the Wheatberries dish. It was not what I expected at all but in a fabulous way. The light sauce had a touch of rich butter and the proportion of chickpeas, wheatberries and yogurt was good. The only thing I thought there could have been more of was the squash. It was used more as a garnish than a part of the dish. Either way... I eat it all up! My meat eating husband had the Potted Salmon and the Bolognese. He was taken back at how good the salmon was that he finished every last drop. He said it was very unique in its smokey but fresh flavor; that with every bite he wanted more! Our bartender provided great service with full water glasses, fresh drinks and everything else. The best part... 5 drinks, 2 apps and 2 main dishes didnt break the bank! Love it!!! As I am writing this we have already booked a reservation to go next weekend with some friends. That's how much we loved our experiance. GO! NOW! FOR ANY MEAL AND ENJOY!"
Excellent food/service. Nice view of the river.
"Boisterous and a Fab Wine ListI'd really like to five 5 stars here... but.Great design of old space that is quite large, lively and loud.Interesting menu that is well written.  I've done oysters here and have been great.  Classic service with mignonette that is perfectly zesty and tart.Had a tagliatelle dish with mushrooms that was quite rustic.  Easily the chewiest pasta I have ever had in my life, stateside or in Italy.  I'm an ""al dente"" kind of guy, but this particular pasta was plain under cooked for my taste. Flavors were great, well presented, but the texture was a distraction to the point that each bite kept triggering my brain to say ""put me back in the pot for a few minutes!""  My grandfather, aunts, uncles (and I) all made/make our own pasta, and respect the labor by not overcooking.  Tagliatelle here was seriously disrespected.  The quality of ingredients were all there, so hat off, and again taste was great.  But pasta is about texture also.!!! Great wine list !!!  One of the more thoughtful and well written lists I've seen in years. Wine director is super nice, friendly, well informed.  Downside: Seriously over priced.  I'm happy to pay standard markup for bottles in a restaurant, but I dislike paying markup + an additional 25-50% on top.So, 4 stars for overpriced wine, undercooked pasta, and bad acoustics.  A few mods and I would easily say 5 stars.Certainly worth checking out and exploring the menu further.Cheers!"
"I thought the Kitchen was a beautifully designed restaurant with great views of the river. Our server was very friendly and helpful. I ordered a cup of chicken wild rice and a baby green salad with shaved turnip, radish, pleasant ridge reserve, champagne vinaigrette and croutons. While I thought the food was good, I left feeling a bit disappointed. The croutons were stale and very difficult to eat. My friend ordered the lamb burger and said it was good. I'm giving the Kitchen 4 stars because of the great decor and service even though I wasn't super impressed with the food."
"Our meal at the Kitchen was good. Service bordered on great. We had fresh oyster app and the east coast oysters were great. I had the rib eye, which was perfectly prepared. I can't recall what my wife had, but she seemed happy.So why only 4 stars? The bill. Wow. Just a bit out of whack here."
"I actually really like this place but the food, unfortunately, is nothing to write home about.  I wish it were because I really do enjoy it here.  i've gone twice: once for brunch and once for dinner.  Dinner was definitely better.  Both times I had the oysters, which everyone thought were great.  For whatever reason, they only have East Coast oysters but they were excellent both times.  It's a large place and has a great view.  The restrooms are very nice.  I actually had the same server both times, and he remembered me, which is always a huge plus.  I should have gotten his name but he was quite good.  The first time for brunch, the bar was very behind.  He did apologize but there was no gesture or anything to compensate.  I got a bloody, which (in his defense) was described as being made from tomato puree.  It really was to the point of being sort of chunky with tomatoes.  While it tasted fresh, not my ideal bloody.  That took about 15 minutes to come.  When my friends arrived shortly after, one greyhound and one mimosa took about 20 minutes.  When they finally arrived, the delivering person brought the wrong drink and had to go back.  I know the server did not advise the order incorrectly only because he stood there right in front of us and said exactly what he put in (which was not what was delivered).  So the bar was quite behind and they were not doing anything to compensate for that, which was a bit frustrating.  I think the booths in the back are quite comfortable but the chairs are definitely not.  The bar was average when I returned for dinner.For brunch I had the trout, which actually was really good.  The portion sizes were perfect for brunch.  They were decent but not huge.  I think the trout was the best dish of the table, however.  The second time we tried most of the smaller plates.  The garlic fries were nothing special.  I didn't get a lot of garlic.  The crab legs were probably my least favorite.  They were not that succulent and lacked flavor.  The hummus was above average but not awesome.  I did enjoy the roasted beets.  The pig ears had flavor but they should have been crispier.  Overall, nothing blew me away although it's a good location and I think they can probably do better.  I'll continue to check it out!"
Really friendly and knowledgeable staff. You have to try the pig ears and the white fish was delicious. End the meal with the chocolate nemesis and you will not be disappointed.
Unexpected find for lunch with friend. Very enjoyable experience. Great place to sit on the river. Simple yet delicious weekend lunch options with super friendly customer service. Would definitely go back!
"I'm giving only 4 instead of 5 starts because I wasn't too thrilled with my entree (the mushroom tagliatelle, which was over buttered, lacking mushrooms, and just overall unexciting and a bit bland--had to ask for a side of parmesan cheese). Actually, my appetizer (tomato soup) was not that exciting either, but I'll stick with 4 stars because everything else was pretty tasty, and the atmosphere and service were great.I would recommend, in particular, the pea and fava bean bruschetta appetizer (l would go back maybe just for that), and my parents liked their trout main courses as well. As a side we shared the roasted beets with chévre, which were delicious, and the toffee pudding for dessert was like a heavenly new take on pecan pie. Definitely would recommend that one if you have a sweet tooth!"
"My best friend and I decided to try The Kitchen out for a dinner catch up. The decor and the ambiance was really classy and modern. The hostess was eh - wasn't as welcoming and seemed a little pompous but that was just my first impression which is unfortunate. We forgot to make a reservation so we had a brick wall seat (our fault) but I'm sure that the view from the window seating would have been amazing and relaxing. Anyway, the food was quite tasty but didn't wow me. We started off with a half dozen of oysters that were pretty delicious and fresh. Then come the entrees, my friend's steak was a tad bit too salty (and I usually LOVE salty savory foods). My Bolognese was pretty delicious but it didn't stand out to me. It was just a VERY creamy pasta with minced meat folded into it. Presentation of the foods for being a more upscale restaurant was mediocre. However I do give them credit for the presentation of their Summer G&T. I would say it's one of the prettiest cocktail I've had in a while (don't drink much). On the other hand, the test was sort of bland. Tasted mostly like club soda and a hint of peppercorn. It was refreshing for that hot Chicago Summer day though. The three stars would go to the service only towards the end of dinner. In the beginning everyone was friendly and accommodating, however towards the end as we were talking and finishing up out dinner, we felt SUPER rushed to leave. When I went the bathroom, my friend told me at least 4-5 waiters came by to ask if they could take my plate away. When I came back, I was still picking on my plate while catching up with my friend, at least 3-4 waiters came by asking if I was finished. Come dessert, again, presentation was bleh - we got the Meringue with strawberries and it came out looking like a bunch of whipped cream with strawberries folded in just slapped into a bowl. The taste was just OK - it wasn't too sweet which is why I liked it but primarily ate only the strawberries. Overall, the experience could have much better if we hadn't felt so rushed and the food, it was good but not great. I'd give it another try with a reservation next time and see how the other foods taste. I would recommend checking this place out however it will be a pretty penny."
"Very much enjoyed our meal at The Kitchen Chicago!  Our first impressions were good as the hostess was friendly and had our reservation prepared prior to our arrival.  The restaurant was beautiful and gave a great view of the river.  The waitress was good and got to our table promptly.  I'm such a beer guy these days that I had a few questions about the wine list and she sent the sommelier to our table who was very helpful.  One of the managers came by after we ordered and we had a nice conversation about what the restaurant's whole concept about 'community table' was.  Virtually every staff member there was friendly, professional, yet personable and welcoming!We started with the Cheese & Charcuterie and it was great.  I had the swordfish and my wife had the dry aged sirloin.  Both were fantastic and we enjoyed sharing.  Give The Kitchen Chicago a try if you want great food and service.  We were very pleased!"
"It was a last minute decision to make a brunch reservation on a Sunday morning during our vacation, and the restaurant was not empty but neither too full. The waitstaff was great, they were able to easily accommodate my dairy allergy, and their seasonal cocktail menu is dangerously delightful. As the restaurant filled for lunch the ambiance became even more fun, but still not too loud, as the high ceilings in the gorgeous main dining room soaked up the sound. The bar manager Patrick rounded out this incomparable experience by serving our table a complimentary cocktail to share and try, and then insisting our table indulge in one more drink 'on the house' after we had paid our bill. HIGHLY recommended, for all the right reasons."
"Can't say enough good things about this place.Came here after a flight, a little hungry, a little thirsty, didn't know much about the place aside from it was next to the river and it looked nice. They greeted us happily and offered a bar seat or a table - we of course requested a riverside view table!They sat us at a great spot. Our server, Eric, was a killer companion during our dinner. He pointed us in the direction of their best cocktails - pimms cupp, persian lemon, portside! The cocktails were great - but so were the awesome plates. The bolognese was unbelievable (I'll be going back just for that), the charcuterie plate was perfect, and the cavatelli was merely OK.Can't wait to return."
"The Kitchen has a beautiful interior and a beautiful view. Our waitress was nice and helpful, not in any way snobby or looking down on us because we weren't wearing the newest Tom Ford jackets (???) as other reviewers would lead you to believe. I don't think anybody eating in the restaurant had a jacket on, for the record. Definitely a sophisticated atmosphere, but there was nothing about it that made us feel unwelcome.There were a lot of interesting options for food and they were overall very nice. Our waitress's recommendations went a long way in ensuring we made the right choices from appetizer to dessert. I highly recommend this restaurant."
Beautiful restaurant especially on a sunny afternoon with the sun streaming in. Food was meh. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and nothing was super outstanding. I had the curry chicken salad and it was pretty good but not what I was expecting when I ordered curry chicken. It was very light on the dressing and not much curry flavor which was disappointing. My dish was also missing the red cabbage while my colleague had it in hers (we ordered the same salad). Service also was not the best. Our waiter seemed impatient even though we were out for a business lunch and taking our time. I will try again mostly because of how pretty it is on the inside and I like the open kitchen concept!
I've recently had both lunch and  our investor conference dinner here recently.  The food is outstanding and the way they were able to handle our investor conference including the after dinner speaker was exceptional.
"Came here 2 days in a row! My friends & I loved this place. Great decor, awesome cocktails (recommend the Spring G & T) and delicious brunch!"
"Food and atmosphere great. Getting the bill split, hell.....we have been to the location in Boulder and it was excellent. Tonight's dinner and service was wonderful, it took a long time in between courses. Really, I would not go back to this location based on how long it took to split our bill. The server did not seek help or apologize for our wait. And when the manager asked about our meal I told him we waited for our tabs for 50 minutes, his response was ""yea, with an eleven top it can take awhile"". Great view great food, what the hell on the ending service tonight."
"Gorgeous view, beautiful ambiance, amazing food - definitely go!  Only thing I wish they had more of was reasonably priced wines, but we really loved it."
The view is nice.  The food is just okay - I think you're mostly paying for the view.  Interior is beautiful as well.  Romantic even during lunch time :)
"I will preface this review by saying my star rating is mostly because of service. I thought the ambience was really nice- the bar seemed really fun. The food was not great, but good (although I thought the crab legs were awesome!). Our service was HORRIFIC. Our server ignored us for the first 15 minutes. Drinks took forever. He was incredibly condescending and rude. We tried to order a couple of small bites with our drinks and he cut us off and told us there was no way he was going to take the order like that because they were way too busy. Once he told us that the management was giving him a headache and he was having a breakdown, once he told us he was sorry our food was late but the kitchen was being ""kicked in the ass"" (by the way, we didn't have any complaints about the food wait), and once he tried to make a joke that the toffee cake tasted like ""dog shit"". Those are all things I want to hear while I'm dining. Not.Several times, even after the restaurant was not busy, he walked right past us without checking in- and he only came over after we waved him down.I'm not a fan of complaining while dining-- I don't like it to seem like I am trying to get something for free. We tried to let the host know as we were leaving, but they were on the phone for a considerable time and we decided to head out. I don't have the guys name, or I would call and give the info to the manager. So, my other alternative is to leave the review here. I would not be that excited to go back."
"We're big fans of the Boulder location, so looked forward to trying this place out.As expected, it totally delivers the goods. A simple menu with delicious fresh ingredients. The staff are great, and the room itself is in a cool location right on the river.This place is a great antidote to the overly fussy restaurants and menus that seem to be everywhere these days."
"Excellent restaurant. In a street of old bland tourist's restaurants and bar food, this place is the standout. Great prices too."
The food was exceptional. The menu is relatively small but the quality was terrific. Crab legs were fresh but a little more salty than normal. The mixed salad and rib eye all outstanding. Service was as good as the food and everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. Definitely going back as soon as we can.
Celebrated my bday with a group of 9 ppl last night. Service was great. Never felt rushed. Food delicious . And such a gorgeous restaurant. Love the rustic chic look. Great new addition to the Chicago restaurant scene. Thank you for a great bday night!
"Being from Colorado I have been to the original Kitchen many times so I was so excited that I ran across The Kitchen Chicago! I have to say, it is very equal to The Kitchen locations across Colorado. The vibe is one of upscale coolness with little pretension, such a relief in River North. I went here on a very cold Thursday after work and was in the mood for tomato soup, grilled cheese, and a glass of wine. I told my bartender what I wanted and he came out with exactly what I wanted! It was the best and fanciest grilled cheese I have ever had, and one of the most memorable as well. The Kitchen is a good spot for dates, a casual after drink work, or for dining with family/friends as their menu has a lot of variety and the atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming. Happy to have a little piece of home in Chicago!"
"The five stars are for management's response to my review.  Management reached out to me a couple of weeks after my visit and made it right.  As my review states, I have eaten several times at the Boulder, Denver and Ft. Collins locations which were all superb and superb experiences.  Management's effort to contact me was in keeping with the professionalism and high standard that you can expect from The Kitchen group.  It has convinced me that my experience in Chicago was an aberration that will be addressed with the employee principally responsible for my initial poor experience at the Chicago location.  Very impressive and well done; the way that a restaurant (really any customer oriented business) should be run.  I will surely try again and post a substantive follow up review."
"How have I not reviewed this yet?  We came down in late December for some holiday cheer and stumbled upon Kitchen on a late Friday night.  What a great find!Overlooking the Chicago River, this farm to table restaurant is beautiful.  With exposed brick and high ceilings, it stands the risk of coming off as ""cold"" but in reality, just the opposite.  Service was stellar.  At one point, my girlfriend accidentally knocked over her wine glass.  They were quick to clean it up and promptly returned with another glass of wine.  We started off with the fried pig ears and then shared a a few pastas as well as the seafood stew.The pig ears were a great combination of fat, salt, and skin that was perfectly fried to give it a good chew and crunch.  A more sophisticated pork rind, if you will.The pastas really shined.  Homemade noodles- my girlfriend went with the bolognese while my daughter went with the pumpkin.  Both were excellent.  Being a meat eater, I gravitated toward the bolognese.  Beef, pork, and lamb in a rich sauce finished with cream and parmesan cheese.  I felt the seafood stew also was very solid.  Shrimp, mussels, and clams in a rich broth.  The grilled bread served along with it was a great addition.After appetizers and dinner, we were absolutely stuffed....but not that stuffed to bypass dessert.  We opted for the sticky toffee pudding with homemade gelato.  Whatever guilt I had for ordering dessert was quickly forgotten when biting into the dessert,  The dense sponge cake enveloped by the rich toffee sauce was a showstopper.  I would come back just to have dessert.I have always held The Publican as my ideal for what a farm to table restaurant should be.  After my meal at The Kitchen, that may change."
"If you haven't stepped foot in this restaurant, take your two feet, and go. NOW.We had an AMAZING Sunday night romantic dinner here, after we found this place on several ""The new up and coming restaurants in Chicago"" webpages. The owners of The Kitchen define it as a ""community bistro"", but this is also easily the most beautiful restaurant / space I've been to in Chicago. The look is a blend of a modern, chic, lofty sort of space, with an incredible view to the river on one side, and a really fun view into the open kitchen on the other side. The food was lovely, and beat our expectations. We started with a great squash salad, and then had the chicken entree, and the sea food stew. For dessert we had a piece of chocolaty heaven and cappuccinos. If you have one evening in Chicago, go here."
"Great food, pig ears, Fava and pea puree crostini, most definitely highlights. Seared ribeye had a perfect crust and the bernaise was simply spot on. My only complaint, our server was obviously tired. Being in this industry, I'll never fault an employee for being tired on a late Sunday night. She still had wonderful recommendations, we were sent the the crostini as an accident, and may have been the star of the meal. Can't wait to return and try more of menu."
"The interior of this restaurant is gorgeous, spacious, and modern chic. And if you can score a table near the window so that you can have a view of the river and city, even better! I came here for a light lunch with a friend, and so I ordered the mussels and this porter called Moody Tongue Chocolate Churro, which was to die for. Mussels were tender and delicate, and came with a grilled slice of bread that was perfect for soaking up all of the sauces. I would highly recommend the porter which is on draft as well - creamy, chocolatey, delicious. Service was fantastic! Very fast, nice, and when the kitchen accidentally created an order of beignets by mistake, the server gave it to us (double score for free desserts!). Perfect place for a romantic evening out."
"Four gal-pals lunching. We ordered: 2 bloody marys; ice tea; ""Gougere"" appetizer (4 yummy pastry bites of gouda/gruyere); 1 lunch box (charcuterie plate); 2 salmon bruschettas and a portobello sandwich. Very nice presentation. Very nice-looking space. Cool & groovy 70's soundtrack playing. Service was a bit slow for a Saturday. Dining room very UN-crowded so maybe a bit under-staffed or figuring out the weekend lunch needs. Although a bit on the slow side, our server, Claire, was very courteous and professional. Looking forward to trying again but next time: dinner!"
"Great food, ambience and service.  Really good cocktails, oysters and king crab legs.  All of the food is good though."
"I am a huge foodie, and truly enjoy new culinary experiences in Chicago. The range of options was incredible - had the cheese plate, olives and hummus to start. The hummus was especially delicious - homemade with red pepper flakes. Then had the truffle tagliatelle and black bass special. Both were delicious. The staff was extremely accommodating and the atmosphere was unique, spacious and really quite beautiful. Last but not least, their wine list... We had the most amazing bottle of Sauvignon Blanc (a wine that I rarely order in restaurants because of how accessible it is elsewhere). It was absolutely fantastic. Can't wait to come here again!!"
"Cute/Trendy atmosphere. Went with a large group, we tried a bunch of different dishes everything was good, but not great. The Trofie alla Bolognese was the highlight - great flavor and a perfect portion. We did however have wonderful service, and that's always a great thing. Would be willing to go back and try a few other dishes and more seafood. The halibut looked amazing!"
"Came here on a spur of the moment decision with some visitors from DC and had a great experience. First, the location is awesome and has a really nice view right along the river. We tried quite a bit of the menu and everyone was pleased. Persnally, I had the mussels and the ribeye and both were phenomenal. Highly recommend."
"My husband and I dined with friends on Valentine's night here. What an evening to remember! We visit The Kitchen in Boulder often, but this was our first time at the Chicago location. As we were lead to our table, the chic interior set the tone for the experience we were about to have. Beautiful views of the city and river brought the outdoors in, and complimented the on point decor inside. We were greeted with Champagne to begin the evening. It was the best I have ever experienced. The sommelier was generous with his time in explaining the background of what we were drinking. We chose to have our dinners accompanied with the wine pairings. Evening on a busy night like Valentine's, each glass was served with expert knowledge.My husband and I are vegetarians. The Kitchen always treats our dietary restrictions with great ease. We had the Wild Mushroom & French Black Truffle Tagliatelle. WOOOOOOOW! It was divine! As was our dessert. The thing that makes The Kitchen so special is the superb service. No detail left unnoticed. Its the little things like folding my napkin when I excused myself from the table, coursing each plate perfectly and everyone smiles! Thank you Kitchen for making our special evening all the more memorable. We cannot wait to join you again!"
"Fantastic ambiance, high ceilings, beautiful light fixtures, and cool textured concrete everywhere. Modern and sparse without being cold. Good food as well, we had mussels in some kind of delicious broth, tagliatelle with wild mushrooms and truffles, some kind of steak, and finished off with a lemon tart and flourless chocolate cake. All were good, with the desserts outshining the savory dishes. The bartender and sommelier were very helpful in suggesting pairings for each course, with the high note being a Barolo Chinato to accompany the flourless cake. Delicious. Service was professional and friendly but a little stiff, I'm not sure how to describe this best but I guess it seemed like staff felt like they were being watched closely. A little pricey for what it is, but it's a great spot for a date or a business meal. Overall a good experience, we will be back."
"The Kitchen is right around the corner from my apartment, so I decided to stop by to see what all the fuss was about.The server immediately greeted me with a smile and was friendly and warm. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and you could tell she wanted to make the experience enjoyable.The sommelier came by and made a few recommendations for wine pairings. She even let me try a few before deciding which was nice.The standout dish to me was the house made cavetelli with braised goat, orange, coriander, soffritto, and parmesan. It was complex and the flavors came together nicely. The trout was amazing as well."
"I went to the Kitchen in Denver a few years ago, so I was excited when they came to Chicago! The space is beautiful and food delicious, I just wish the portions were larger :) Very accommodating of vegan restrictions, too! Great for all kinds of occasions. Upscale casual."
"I had been twice before and enjoyed the Kitchen but yesterday made me a confirmed Kitchen fan. We went for brunch and had such a good time there - and such great food and drink - we didn't leave until 9PM. Brunch dishes are a great range - from superb benedict to lamb burgers and dutch pancakes. They make a great croissant and have lovely quiche.  As we went to leave, it started raining so we thought we'd have one more drink at the bar - but the bartender suggested the most amazing wine and then we had to have more and ... well, it was some pasta and salad before we could leave. Oh and they were cooking an apple chutney right there and it smelled so good, we just had to get the cheese plate it was on ... and begged some extra chutney. All of the food is superb - and the Bolognese is as good as everyone says ... and I am tempted to go back today for some more!What i don't see mentioned enough is the really interesting wine list - they've put togther a selection by glass or bottle of really delicious and unexpected offerings. The Scholum Project Garden of Babylon Petite Syrah and Cab blend was what got us to stay so many more hours ... just amazing but also the Aberrant Cellars Philtrum Pinot Noir Blanc was a lovely pairing for brunch earlier. The staff know their wines - and there's a great Somm is you need - as well as an equally interesting beer list.The room is gorgeous - and the staff are so polished yet so friendly and relaxed - they make it such a joy to dine here.We will be back over and over ... brilliant."
"Beautifully designed in a French rustic style, yummy oysters, fantastic fries (thicker cut but still crispy), perfectly crafted French 76, and friendly staff who even offered us a complimentary limoncello."
One of our new favorites.  Service was really good - and fun.  Great menu and the food was excellent.  2 thumbs up.
"A great addition to River North and right on the river on Clark. This is a chain from Colorado but the look and feel of the restaurant fits in nicely. Our server, Jeneva, was terrific and knew a lot about the menu and the owners. Wines seemed a little pricy but the menu was reasonably priced. We started with mussels which were plump, no sand, and full of flavor. The trout was a table favorite and the veggie dish, hazard free farm wheat berries, a mix of grains, was very good. Didn't make it to desserts. The room was a little noisey but the city and River views were great."
"I have given this place several chances. While the food is good and this is the nicest looking restaurant in Chicago, I don't think I will be going back.The seafood towers are understandably expensive. However, for the price I don't think the quality compares to the seafood towers you get at Chicago Cut and other places. The place is on the pricey side, and that's fine. The service, however, is seriously lacking and is in no way commensurate to what you'd expect at a fine dining restaurant. If you ever order a condiment, it usually gets to your table after several repeated requests. I once got my ketchup long after I had devoured my french fries. Every time I have been here, it took so long for some of the appetizers to arrive that I kept asking the waiter if he forgot to put in those items.I don't want to be that guy who is always bothering the waiters, but the service here forces me to do that."
"Quick Version: After having a wonderful experience at The Kitchen in Boulder, I was excited to try the new restaurant in Chicago. The Kitchen Chicago did not disappoint - with their fantastic location on the river, open space, and great mix of fresh seafood and pasta, I'm guessing The Kitchen will do pretty well. Before people stop reading due to length, I'll quickly say this: of all the restaurants I've eaten at in Chicago, I've never had a better pasta dish than The Kitchen's bolognese (beats out Piccolo Sogno). My friends were fresh off a meal from Longman & Eagle, and we had eaten at Piccolo Sogno recently, so expectations were high. Our taste buds were ready to play.We were seated at a corner table, overlooking the river just outside. Our waitress was friendly and very familiar with the beer list, and the bar manager stopped by our table to ask if we had any questions. Good start with the service.We ordered fries and a seafood tower to start. The fries were likely the low point of the meal - it didn't seem like much effort was put into them, as they were just a notch above Ore-Ida. But the seafood tower more than compensated for the fries. The lobster and crab legs were solid, and tasted as you'd expect lobster and crab would. But the smoked mussels, which I've never had the pleasure of tasting, were fantastic. Oysters were great as well.Then, on to the entrees. I've never tasted a more consistently great round of entrees - among the 5 of us, we ordered 4 different entrees. The cavatelli with goat and the bolognese were the two stars of the night. The poussin was akin to a cassoulet, but much lighter. And the sturgeon, with its salsa verde, was flaky and delightful (you can't miss with a salsa verde).The five of us agreed it was one of the best meals we've had in Chicago. I won't put it up there with something like Longman & Eagle, but they're playing different games. The Kitchen provides classic, fulfilling dishes, and fresh, unadulterated seafood."
"We walked in opening night to a warm welcome from a friendly staff. I heard about the opening from a friend and was wanting to try a new place in the loop. This modern but elegant kitchen sits right off the great chicago river. So not only do you get a wonderful dining experience but also a great view.This is an establishment that prides itself on great quality food. I started off with the goat gougere, and it was delicious. Not too greasy and very crispy. I also decided to try the Persian lemon cocktail. It is one of the The Kitchens signature cocktails. It was very fruity and delicious and left me with a hint of nostalgia. My main was the vegetable and seafood chowder. The shrimp were thick and the clams were well cooked. Altogether it was a great dinner.The lighting in this place was awesome and made a great atmosphere. Also...the bathrooms were just top notch. This place had some great interior designers. I wish The Kitchen was MY kitchen."
"I wish I had gotten everyone's name so I could be more specific about the staff. They were attentive and friendly without being pretentious. This is huge for me. I don't like pomp and stuffiness around my food. I find it's often a cover for mediocre food.I went for lunch with a friend. It was the perfect workday break. We had the whitefish and sturgeon. Both were great, but the sturgeon surprised me more. The squeeze of lemon over the lentils was a great addition. We then had the Sticky Toffee Pudding and Pumpkin Pie. Again both were great but the pudding will have be doing the walk of shame time and time again. It's quite addictive.I also liked their whisky selection. I will be heading back. I'd like to try dinner. I hear the bar is quite sexy at night."
Awesome food.  Incredible ambience.  Highest end farm to table.Great local beers. Just had their tomato soup and a tagliatelle with truffles and mushrooms.
"This place is for serious foodies. Yes, it's expensive. There's no denying it's pricey, but worth the money. This is a dining experience. The marinated olives and the cheese plate are sublime. Great fish and my husband loved his steak. Great ambience, excellent wine selection. A real treat."
