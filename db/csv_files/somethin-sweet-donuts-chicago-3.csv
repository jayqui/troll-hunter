Somethin’ Sweet Donuts
"Local donut spot that has a unique selection of treats. Try the maple bacon donut!They also offer smoothies and coffee as well. And if I'm reading this correctly, they deliver! This completes my life."
"Red velvet crumbs & Blueberry crumb donuts are among the best donuts I have had.. Skip the routine donuts like chocolate, glazed etc as they are treated as second class citizens. You are better off choosing donuts on the top shelves which is their USP"
WOW! I'm a crazy donut lover! I know everyone says that....but no seriously....my life revolves around donuts. I came here for the first time on national donut day wearing a donut dress. I hadn't come here sooner bc it wasn't really close to me but now I know to make the extra drive!! Not only were the donut so good but it was clean and the staff was sooooo nice and friendly!!! The lemon cake was my fav (even tho I'm usually a chocolate donut type of girl) We got the bismark and the lady told me they add the filling when you order. GENIUS! the twists were great. Red velvet was great!! You won't be disappointed!!SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS! Better than any chain donut shops! So yummy
"I'm not really into doughnuts. If given the choice, I'll pick a cupcake before a doughnut.I just so happen to be 5 minutes from this place when I opened up the Yelp app. Two yelp friends wrote about this place and I thought it would be cool to try it out.I came in 20 minutes before closing, walked in and instead of smelling doughnut I smelled Chinese food.... An employee was eating at one of the tables as she said hello to me. she got up and hit the bell and set back down eating her Chinese food.  (It's a Chinese Restaurant I believe that's connected as it's one right next door.)The person that got my selection of doughnut had a great smile and I'm sure If I had gotten there earlier I probably would have gotten samples to try to help speed my selection along. I thought the doughnut were good and fresh (I'm sure they were made in the last 24 hours) had a mix of flavors that I think you're only going to find here. I can honestly say despite the reviews I really didn't have much expectation about this place so can't say I was ""let down"" (on the other hand seeing how many doughnuts were still at the front counter at almost 10 p.m. I doubt they throw them all away.) The glaze is not Hard but it seems to do a good job locking in the freshness (most of the one's I had gotten were glazed.)If I'm in the area, I could see myself coming back."
"I've heard that they were featured in the recent episode of Chicago's Best.  But did Somethin' Sweet Donuts (SSD) make it to Rosa J.'s best?  I certainly thought so, without a doubt!  The owner lady has one of the greatest hospitality skills.  We were greeted warmly and offered some donut samples.  Other than the regular drink menu, they have some seasonal iced tea items that look so attractive and tempting for someone who is too excited for the spring in Chicago.I'm not so sure if the winter has indeed come to the end (don't bounce back like a mad woman, Miss Winter), yet I welcome great Thai iced tea and donuts at anytime of the day.  We had some delicious Thai iced tea; it had just the right amount of sweetness and ice.  Without any hesitation, we went with the one (1)-dozen donut option.  For $8.95 for twelve (12) donuts?  I think it's a nice deal.  Those donuts looked like they could go to a donut pageant competition!  They were made in a perfect shape and size, and they were beautifully-decorated and dazzled like a dream.  It's kind of ironic that the D*nk*n D*nuts was diagonally across the street from SSD.  Well, have a quality life by coming to SSD and trust Yelp.  They were many regulars stopping by, and the owner lady knew their names and what they wanted...very cool.  From now on, they will remember my name as well.  I don't live close by at all, but should I make a point coming here?  I think the answer is affirmative."
"I am not one for trying to one-up someone about what is the best restaurant, coffee house, cafe, diner, doughnut shop, etc. But what I will have to break down and say is that Somethin's Sweet Donuts is ""the best"" that I've had in Chicago.Glazed. Chocolate glazed. Chocolate bowtie. Chocolate crueller. Apple fritter. Old fashioned. Cinnamon swirl.Having gotten there a few hours before closing, the doughnuts were as fresh as I've gotten at any doughnut shop when they opened for morning business. Go to a doughnut shop close to closing and you get something akin to a hockey puck or a chewable dog treat. Not here. And add to it all the friendly shop staff, I'm glad this gem is a short drive from Logan Square."
"This place was pretty fantastic. Largest selection of cake, raised, and specialty donuts I've seen in Chicagoland so far and I've now been to over 30 different shops. The only donuts I would rank better are the chocolate frosted cake or cruller donuts at Weber's bakery near Harlem and Archer. My favorite here was the blueberry cake donut. Real blueberries mixed in and the perfect level of tart and sweet. I could easily order just a dozen of the blueberry cake donuts. Next were the seasonal pumpkin buttermilk bars. I sure wished I'd picked more flavors of buttermilk bars as I assume the others were as good as the pumpkin ones. The bacon long John and apple fritters got great reviews from family members too. I had a wide assortment and the family had cleared the box in under 48 hours they were so good. I think it's good for our waist lines that this shop isn't very close to home. I'm sure to return here as often as I can. The great food and friendly owner show why the rating is so high here. I fully agree."
"So I was on a mission last year to find a decent apple fritter in the city.  I stopped by many of those hipster donut shops that charge $3+ dollars a donut but the fritter was elusive, as they were always out by the time I got to the store.Finally I took to Yelp to find a coffee place near work and what do you know Somethin's Sweet came up.  When I walked in for the first time there were about half a dozen cops standing and sitting around.  At first I thought I might have happened across a crime scene of some sort, but was immediately put at ease by the owner who offered me a donut hole.I was pretty amazed at the assortment of donuts that they carry here, cherry, blueberry, maple bacon long johns, cake, raised, chocolate, red velvet, their version of the cronut, muffins, and so much more.  Their flavors are not quite as inventive as some of those hipster donut places, but it is definitely better than most donut chains with very reasonable prices to match (last I was there, $0.89 for a regular donut, $1.29 for the filled or specialty donuts).I have bought donuts for the office several times now (mostly because I want to try all of them without eating a whole one of each), and each time has been a hit.  Each time I get the same smiling service from the owner, Jimmy.  And each time I get a free donut hole.  Once I was asking about a particular flavor and he just happened to have that flavor as a donut hole and gave it to me to try.I can't rave enough about this place.  Half a dozen cops can't be wrong when it comes to donuts, right?"
Love this place! The people who work here are so friendly and their prices are reasonable. Plus the donuts are great--the Devil's Food cake donuts rock. Definitely better than Dunkin Fails-at-Donuts.
"I just checked out this place a few days after it aired on Chicago's Best. I live all the way in Uptown, but didn't mind stopping by before work since their CB clip and reviews were excellent! I ordered a dozen of their regular donuts and could not believe how cheap they were! A little over $9 for a dozen of these delicious donuts. I brought them into work and they were mostly devoured within a few minutes. I would say that my favorite had to be the red velvet, followed by the apple and blueberry donuts. I would definitely stop by to try other donuts, especially their fancier ones. If you live in the area, forget about Dunkin Donuts, this is the place to satisfy your sweet morning cravings."
I'm so upset I've never been here before! Good thing is I will be returning.The man behind the counter was super nice and gave us samples.I took home red velvet and glazed donuts and they are delicious!Their prices are great and the donuts are filling. Cannot wait to go back!
"BEST DONUTS I HAVE EVER TASTED!I'm actually eating a blueberry donut as I write this review hahaMy aunt told my family and I about this place last year and it has since been a family favorite. My sister even had donuts from Somethin' Sweet instead of a cake for her birthday because they are just that good. The owners (nicest people ever) also made her a heart shaped donut with filling just for her special day. Besides the customer service being stupendous, the donuts are just as great...they are so soft and simply delicious. If you don't eat them the day of purchase, they will still be uber soft the next day! It's such a quaint little spot with a lot to offer and at a great price!"
"The owner is super nice! He gave me samples then more free donut holes after I had already chosen my donuts. The donuts are delicious! Also, the pricing is really cheap for the quality. You should definitely stop by this shop and say hello to the owner, and get some great donuts!"
Since we moved around the area almost a year ago I have been coming to this place since I discovered it on Yelp! Doughnuts of all kinds are made fresh everyday and taste so good. I just bought a dozen at 7pm and it taste like it was made just an hour ago!
"My wife and I are new to the Belmont Central neighborhood. We were living in Wicker Park the past two years and were sad to leave all the great food spots, to our amazement, Somethin' Sweet Donuts was a great spot to crave our sweet tooth. They're affordable and have a great selection. If you're in the Craigin area, defintely worth stopping by."
"First, the owner is super awesome.  Friendly guy who first gave us sampler to try before we could even order!  Next he was engaging us in conversation about the Bears!  Great experience and super cool owner.Secondly, these are cake donuts (so if you don't like a heavy cake avoid this spot).  However, these are really good cake donuts.  The flavor is surprisingly good and consistent even though the donuts are on the heavier side.  The butter milk bar donut was pure amazing!  Worth coming here even if its out of the way.  I will definitely come back to this place."
"Cake donuts fresh, light, moist.Cronuts subpar.Staff friendly."
"Overall, not a bad little shop. The blueberry donut is out-of-this-world good, but the other one were just meh. The owner is super friendly, handing out free sample donut holes, which were super fluffy and delicious, as soon as we walked in. Having tried these, I was really excited to try the actual donuts. We ordered two blueberry glazed, a pumpkin glazed, a buttermilk-raspberry bar, an apple crisp glazed, a devil's food, and an apple fritter. Like I said, the blueberry was amazing. The flavor was just unbelievable. However, the apple fritter was very thin and hard; the apple crisp was under-cooked and doughy in the center, and didn't even taste like apples. It was basically a plain glazed donut. The pumpkin was alright. The flavor in the cake was pretty good. There wasn't really anything remarkable about the others. Overall, I would come back for the blueberry donuts."
Delicious and fresh donuts ! I live a block away and I'm excited such place exists in this area.... friendly service as well ...
"My parents and I have been on a quest for Cronuts for months and found them here! We had an awesome experience and my dad took it upon himself to write a review. He's a harsh critic and this is what he had to say:""Drove 4 1/2 hours from Iowa  to try the Cronuts, it was worth the trip and will make it a point to revisit any time we are visiting Chicago or travelling through. We were treated to the freshest, most flavorful cronuts. They were light and crisp, the filling that we tried were Raspberry, Lemon and Bavarian Cream, each one better than the other. If that was not good enough, meeting Jimmy the owner operator was truly the icing on the cake. What a genuine, sincere person, besides being an awesome craftsman, he just exhudes an aura of joy.""So there you have it! I can't wait to revisit and see Jimmy again!"
"We were sort of in the neighborhood and swung by here.  The owner here, Jimmy Chow, was a friendly guy and offered us donut hole samples with a  smile upon entering.  We ended up picking half a dozen for $7.82.  That's a good deal for a good assortment of tasty and fresh enough donuts.  Their price range is $0.85 to $1.59 per donut.  We learned the friendly owner is Chinese but raised in Cambodia.  He's a value guy and knows donuts go for 2 - 3x more in city center, so come out this way if you want a better deal for comparable quality."
Love this place! I often drive from Peoria just to get some donuts to take home! The owners are very friendly and actually take the time to have a conversation with you which is nice. I commend them for being such hard workers too. I'm pretty sure it's just the two of them that work there and they do everything themselves everyday. Why wouldn't you want to support a great local small business like this?!I absolutely love the blueberry crumb donut. It has the perfect consistency for a donut and tastes amazing! But I honestly haven't had a donut I didn't like here. I highly recommend this place!
"Fabulous Donuts, and Friendly People is what you will find at Somethin' Sweet Donuts.  They specialize in a crumble topping/coating that enhances perfectly crisp-fluffy donuts. The Cherry Crumble donut is incredible, and the Blueberry Crumble donut is equally awesome. Their Donut hole versions are also great. I have had the Crullers, they were just slightly crisp with a fluffy inside that just melted in my mouth. They utilize peanut butter, chocolate, creams, and other flavors in different ways, and they are all tasty. I did have a disappointing Maple-Bacon donut there; it just tasted sweet without much flavor - it was the only donut weakness I have found at Somethin' Sweet Donuts.These guys love their donuts and want customers to love them too. They are very nice, friendly people.Park on Fullerton, or park within the neighborhood and have a pleasant walk as you anticipate the wonderful donuts you are about to enjoy."
Did you know that they will fill your doughnut just for you?? That is super dope.
"This place is a hidden treasure!The owners are just too sweet and accommodating and the donuts are amazing.Donuts are made onsite and are fresh.There is a lot of variety and to be honest you're likely to grab a dozen!They also have a wonderful menu with shakes,food, and other desserts do this is a must try if you're feeling frisky.To wrap this up, wonderful service,great donuts, great price,CLEAN place.R.I.P Dunkin D's"
"Me and my boyfriend had a taste for donuts but weren't sure if they'd hit the spot being that it was 7pm. We arrived to Somethin' Sweet Donuts expecting to have ""okay"" donuts since we assumed that they'd be cooked in the morning. Much to our surprise, the donuts were fresh and incredibly tasty. When we walked in the owner was friendly and immediately offered us a sample of one of his unique flavored donuts. I recommend this place a thousand times over. I haven't been back a second time, but I imagine that I will frequent this business a ton in the future."
"First off, you walk in to a clean bright place with a friendly smile to greet you. The owner is so nice and welcoming! Very humble, I can appreciate that with all the grouchy people everywhere! He sampled me a blueberry munchkin... Lord... I had to get it! The donuts here are ah-ma-zing! There is a nice crunch you wouldn't expect from a donut! They are fresh and flavorful. Eff Dunkin they ain't got nothing on this place! Can't wait to come back, they have smoothies, sandwiches & ice cream! I can't rate those but I rate the donuts a solid 5 stars!!!!!"
"Normally, three stars wouldn't necessarily represent a disappointment...but given the almost uniformly stellar ratings here, I must either conclude that (1) Chicagoans don't know their donuts or (2) Somethin's Sweet was having a really off day when I came here. While I wouldn't say I'm quite to the status of ""donut connoisseur"" yet, I have been to Atlanta's Sublime Donuts and Maryland's Fractured Prune franchises, both of which are of the world-class, knock-your-socks-off variety. This was nothing like those.Let's look at the positives for a second: the service was charming and efficient, and the interior decor is very inviting and makes you want to eat in rather than rushing out again. But come on, man, this is supposed to be about the donuts! And that, unfortunately, is where this all falls flat. I got a blueberry cake donut and some variety of cinnamon crumb personally recommended by the proprietor. I found both to be dry and bland, two words you don't want to see attached to donuts. Sorry, but I'm not buying the hype just yet."
"A great mom & pop spot for your caffeine, and sweet craving needs! They have a great selection of unique donuts, and their green tea is deeeeelish! It's the perfect place to hit up any time of the day, or night, and their comfortable booths allow for many great hours of conversation, and fun to be had.The cool thing about this place is that they're connected to the Chinese restaurant next door. So if you're looking for a donut, and maybe some pot stickers, needless to say it can be had. The owners are friendly, the environment is inviting, and the edibles are, simply put, ""somethin' sweet""."
Best donuts in the Midwest. The owners are very friendly and welcoming i can't wait to come again
"$9 for a DOZEN of donuts!!Every donut was pretty good!! the lady was very nice, she gave my cousins and I some samples to try since it was our first time trying it. I have to say the apple fritters are good, the chocolate glaze was also good..ohh and the red velvet was pretty bomb too! My personal fav is the blueberry glaze..you must get that one too! They also had beignts and they were sold out ,BUT she was nice enough to make some for us real quick! I'll be coming back again whenever im around the area!"
So glad my donut go-to is NOT my local Dunkin Donuts! How did I not know about this place?! (AND they've expanded to the Hermosa Neighborhood!) Amazingly fresh baked goods and such friendly staff.  Try it! Beats processed and franchised donuts ;)
Great customer service and good donuts for a decent price.
"We showed up a day too late. My foodie boyfriend and I went to this wonderland the day after Chicagos Best. Luckily, the owners nice and he gave us samples of his lemon donuts. Yum. But we went for the Cronuts. I just had to try one and Dunkin Donuts should stop trying. We purchased three different kinds each filled with somethin' different... creme, lemon, and raspberries. I would be lying if I said I had a favorite. The cronuts were soft as a cloud in the middle with a slight crunchy exterior. And it wasnt super sweet. They were dreamy."
"Really yummy doughnuts! We came from a bit far away, but we were craving doughnuts so we had to have them. The owner's wife was working and gave us free samples before we bought our half dozen because it was our first time. That was extremely nice. After we picked our 6, she gave us a free one on the house. Even nicer! My favorite was the blueberry cake doughnut, the apple fritter and the plain old regular glazed. Highly recommend if nearby or in the area, but don't make a super, super long trek."
"Here's a little Heads up to all my Donut Lovin Friends out there..I have found the Nirvana of Donuts, Truly Donut Heaven if you will..And, you don't have to pay absurd amounts of money for these donuts either!Welcome to Somethin's Sweet Donuts, and the store/shop is run by Jimmy,a very nice, friendly guy!Jimmy owns this shop and told me he has been a baker for the last 30 years!Pretty Amazing, and gotta tell you that after I had a few samples that Jimmyoffered me I could taste the freshness and quality and skill that went intothese donuts,I went in about 10:30 am, and there were still plenty of donuts in the casethat looked pretty phenominal but Jimmy and staff were also busy bakingup a storm in the back..The minute I walked in the door I was welcomed by Jimmy with a big smile,and he told me about the donuts and answered any questions I had.Great Customer Service, sending Big Props to Jimmy for that!I couldn't believe the sizes/varieties of these donuts, Huge, Fluffy, Soft,Red Velvet Cake and Raised, Bavarian Cremes, Blueberry, Cinnamon Rolls,Devils food Cake Donuts.. and more.Okay, so here's the best selling point of all.. these huge, fresh donutssell for about $1.00 a piece, specialty donuts slightly higher.And they have those Bacon Long Johns that so many people like, not mepersonally so you all can have those..But, hey, I like everything else! Props to Me!Jimmy also sells Coffee which I don't drink and smoothies which I do drinkat very reasonable prices.Okay, I will admit, the last time I went to a Donut Shop I wound up spendinga lot of money for a couple of donuts..If I think about it now I could kick myself because I could have gottenbetter quality/variety from Jimmy and his  staff at Somethin;s Sweet..But.. I have learned my lesson..I think we all have gone into one or two of these ever so popular donut placesforked over big bucks for a few maybe not so good donuts and wondered whatever possessed us to do so..So seriously you need to do yourself a favor and go visit Jimmy atSomethin's Sweet, he will take good care of you for sure..And, this is a family operation, Jimmy told me his son made the Somethin'sSweet Sign inside the store for him.. How great is that!Loved meeting Jimmy but more so loved Somethin's Sweet Donuts,Located off the corner of Fullerton and Leclaire..Definitely a Donut Run worth taking..:)"
"This cute little donut place is pretty close to perfect. The women who helped us were both super friendly, the place is clean and bright, and there were a large variety of donuts to choose from even at 9 pm! We tried the red velvet donut, the apple donut, a chocolate glazed and a chocolate crumb. The crumb donuts are interesting and the extra crunch on the outside is a nice balance for the soft warm insides.I will say the donuts are a touch too sweet, but I still ate about a donut and a half, so that complaint is minor."
"Donuts are delicious, FRESH, and reasonably priced! A wonderful family-owned shop with friendly service. Also, the strawberry-banana smoothie tasted incredible (fresh fruit). I will come back and I recommend to anyone!"
"These were easily some of the best donuts I've had. After a couple of disappointing experiences with the hipster donut shops of Wicker Park, I extended my Yelp search area and found this gem a bit further west. The store is bright and clean with a HUGE variety of donuts - so many flavors, some of the same flavor in cake and yeast versions, and both with and without crumb topping so you can get exactly what you're looking for. As soon as I walked in the owner gave me a sample - a cherry donut hole (wow, even the donut holes come in a variety of flavors!) Cherry donuts are one of my favorites, so I got one of those, plus a blueberry, a chocolate frosted, glazed chocolate cake, cruller, and deluxe red velvet. Took them home for my family to sample, and everyone agreed these were top notch.All the varieties were light and melt-in-your mouth. The blueberry actually tasted like a blueberry muffin shaped into a donut. The chocolate donuts had a good chocolate taste, and the red velvet was amazing. I've never had a yeast version of red velvet before, or one that was glazed instead of being smothered with cream cheese frosting. The glaze instead of frosting really let the flavor shine through.This shop is a bit off the beaten path, but worth the drive. Actually, it would be worth taking the CTA. The basic donuts here reasonably priced at 85 cents each (""fancy"" ones are 1.29-1.59). The bus fare over here is cheaper than what it costs to buy one an artisan donut at a trendy hipster donut place. And the donuts here are ten times better. Definitely worth the trip."
"I'm not much of a donut eater. Last night I had to call on Somethin's Sweet to bail me out in a pinch. I needed 200 donuts for an event on Saturday morning and I completely forgot to call to order some closer to me. So when I spoke with Somethin's Sweet they were more than happy to jump in and make donuts at 4 pm in the afternoon. I picked them up last night and this whole morning the response was, ""Where did you get these donuts from?"" They are cake-style donuts but the numerous flavors he has are incredible! I tried a blueberry donut hole last night and it was marvelous!  My wife tried a red velvet donut and thought it was outstanding. Jimmy and his family crank out some seriously good donuts! What I have to get in to try one morning is the cronut. It's closer for me to travel to Chicago than it is to drive to New York! Jimmy proclaims that he has the best cronut in  Chicago so I need to get in to try it. He also makes beignets as well which is a personal favorite of mine. Can't wait to head back!"
"These are little nuggets of deliciousness.  We saw this spot on TV, and shockingly, we passed it the next day!   What a treat for us!  The doughnuts here are fantastic.  We picked three and all were marvelous!"
"Forget Dunkin Donuts! For real delicious & fun donut choices this is by far the best place in the neighborhood without driving to Lincoln Park. The Red Velvet donut is a must. It was moist, soft, and the taste wowed me & my husband. it's actually silly that i can't stop thinking about it. but we must resist :) And you can't beat the prices, way better than DD.  DD these days tastes so process and almost like cardboard. so yes, my business will be here at this place from now on. They also offer coffee and sandwiches, we'll try that next time. If you are driving by, you'll never see it, it's in the middle of the block and the awning doesn't really attract attention, which is unfortunate because if more people knew about this place DD would go out of business."
"Small family owned business. I first visited about a month ago. Since then, Something Sweet is my weekly guilty pleasure. The location is not very large. in fact, only four small booths. The decor is simple and inviting. Each time I've been there, it is clean and spotless.The staff, (Either Mr or Mrs Chow depending on what time you visit), are ALWAYS very nice and very willing to answer questions and offer suggestions. They offer free samples when they have a new donut or even if you ask about a specific donut. I'm partial to the maple Bacon long johns but I've had most of their donuts and I've liked them all. The pumpkin donuts are delicious.The French crullers are light and airy.The red velvet and glazed blueberry are my wife's favorites. Quick tip- try the Thai Iced Coffee with any donut there. You won't regret it. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because they currently don't offer free WiFi. Not having unlimited data on my cell makes me hyper aware of data use and a business that offers that small convenience gets the extra star."
"Seriously awesome donuts! I don't even really like donuts but my husband found this spot today and suggested we stop by for a snack. Holey donut we can't stop eating these. We brought home 25 donut holes; Nothing less than worth it and so dangerous. 100% recommended if you enjoy discovering new holes in the walls.  Let it be known, Dunkin' ain't got nothing on this place."
Awesome cake donuts!!! but disappointing cronuts give 4 stars.  Would definitely go back again!
Went here for the first time a month ago and was greeted by the very nice owner of the place. He had me try a lot of donuts for free and they were all good! Cant wait to come back here!
This is one of those situations where you look at the reviews & because of the ridiculous amount of positive you start to suspect foul play. THAT person has never been to this spot.Everything from the sandwiches to the doughnuts to the smoothies to the ice cream that I have tried there has been fantastic. It doesn't hurt that the owner and his wife are great fixtures as well.  The only thing I could criticize would be that the doughnuts share a very similar taste and texture regardless of what you pick up. Otherwise this a favourite spot of mine.
"We have been coming here for a little over a year. The owner is so friendly and always has a smile on his face. I stopped in today in desperate need of one if their Thai iced coffees and noticed something new in the doughnut case...cronuts! I know I am late to the party but this love child of a donut and a croissant is so very scrumptious. The owner offered me a sample and smart move on his part because after that one bite, I was happy to fork over the cash for the genuine article. They make all of their baked goods on-site so everything is really fresh. Love this place!"
Not really a sweet tooth but even I have to admit the doughnuts were DELICIOUS! Not only that Jimmy has got to be one of the most genuinely sweet and happy people I've ever met. I'd go back just to support him and his family...doesn't hurt they also have awesome treats!
"2 minutes from my home HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE????? These donuts were delicious, the family and I purchased a dozen and each one was wonderful, the lemon donut was great. The donuts are moist and full of flavor and the service was wonderful. At 8.95 a dozen this is a steal."
"A great donut that doesn't aspire to be something it is not, but excels at what it is.The yeast donuts have an okay crust.  The sweetness is well balanced; not bland, not over-powering that it upsets the balance of flavor.  The glazes are right on target, the chocolate frosting (the only one I had) was not a common cocoa-chocolate flavor- it was a bit...different, but acceptable.  The cherry and blueberry donuts' flavors were ramped up significantly, and were the dominating flavors, but with the texture, made them worth eating.The yeast donut was good.  Not too bland, not diabetes-sweet.  Good texture.The buttermilk is a welcome revelation for Chicago, in that it is more true to being a donut with buttermilk flavor than we're exposed to.  If you've had a buttermilk donut in LA, you'll know what I'm talking about.  If you get it with a topping, you won't be disappointed.  I had the custard, and the custard was true to the name, not some bland, off-white, sugary discharge the other places use.  Here, it's really good.The old fashioned donut has a crust, thickness and texture that reminds one of the gem that Prospect Donut (RIP) used to make.  Get one.Quality coffee.  Friendly service.  Easy to get to with lots of street parking.  I will be back."
Great donuts. Reminds me of an LA donut shop. Very pricey though. They don't list prices so when you order it's a gamble as to what you will pay at the register. $2.50 for a simple donut is ridiculous. My advice ask how much the donut you are ordering will be.
The people were very friendly and greeted you when you walked in. The service was great. The coffee and hot chocolate weren't the best. The donuts were good but not great.
Their red velvet doughnuts are the best! Love this place. Everything is always so fresh and the owners are so nice.
"Coming from the south, we have so many great ma & pop doughnut shops. I appreciate that Chicago is a food town, but when it comes to doughnuts I have not been impressed with all the fancy and overpriced breakfast delight. Somethin's Sweet Donuts is a small shop with amazing, delectable doughnuts! More than the doughnuts, Jimmy loves his customers old and new. With a society that is fast paced, Jimmy gives each of his customers a human touch. His heart and passion for people is reflected in his doughnuts!"
"I woke up this morning with a serious donut craving, and Dunkin was just not going to cut it. We drove over to Somethin's Sweet based on the Yelp reviews and were not disappointed! We tried the old-fashioned, old-fashioned with chocolate, blueberry crumble and cronut filled with raspberry. All of them were among the best donuts I've had anywhere. The owner, Jimmy, is delightful. He moved here from California a year ago, his whole family makes donuts, and he clearly knows his stuff.Somethin's Sweet is a bit off the beaten path, but for Logan Square dwellers it's about a 10-minute drive and well worth it. We will be back for sure!"
Better than Krispy creams. These donuts are a real treat. They also serve fruit smoothies! A nice clean friendly environment to take the kids for a great snack. They were on channel 9 for chicago's best donuts.
"Okay, doughnut people: when is the last time someone at Dunkin' Donuts handed you a free Munchkin? What about two free Munchkins? Never happened, did it? On my first visit to Somethin' Sweet, I bagged a couple of doughnuts, an old-fashioned buttermilk thing and a football-shaped something or other. But I found it hard to leave without trying a red velvet doughnut so I headed for the land of compromise: a doughnut hole instead of a full-sized third doughnut. He handed it to me and said it was his treat. I scarfed it right there and pronounced it excellent so he picked out another variety and suggested I try that, too, so of course I did. And yes, it was great. There were lots of very pretty and extravagant doughnuts from which to select but I cleave more toward tradition in this regard. Was very happy with my choices--tender, not greasy, nicely glazed--everything you want a doughnut to be. But here's the kicker--he was so nice and gracious, a genuinely nice person who deserves to find success. Whenever my travels take me to this part of the city, I'll put it on on my list and maybe even spring for a whole bag of doughnut holes, bought and paid for."
"Was really excited to try this place considering how many amazing reviews it has gotten. Definitely out beats all donut places I have tried. The donuts do have more of that cake flavor, which is amazing. The owner (Jimmy) was super friendly! The only thing that stopped me from giving it 5 stars is that all the crumb donuts had a similar taste, no matter the flavor. Apart from that, this place is great! Definitely will be coming here more often :)"
"Oh Something Sweet, you feed my donut addiction. I live in the area, was driving past and their sign caught my attention. Since then it was love. From their blueberry cake donuts to their cronuts, Something Sweet is the food of the gods. Don't even get me started on their cinnamon crumble. My god I cannot get enough. I love Something Sweet and its even better being five minutes from my house. Keep up the awesome work!"
"Undoubtedly, the best darn doughnuts in all of Chicago!  Took these home and the family was literally fighting over them.  French crullers melt in your mouth and the cake doughnuts will leave you looking for seconds... or thirds.  Such a gem of a spot with their super friendly service!"
"Jimmy has very good doughnuts and an awesome personality! We left there feeling really happy and with a box full of doughnuts, and yeah those doughnuts were for only 2 people. But they're amazing and priced inexpensively."
"I don't even like donuts, or at least thought I didn't, until today. This place is superlative. The owner is extremely kind and helpful, the flavors are original and delicious, and the interior is cheerful. We will be regulars for sure."
"Delicious donuts!  I can't pick a favorite. We tried the lemon, blueberry, old fashioned, chocolate, red velvet and glazed. Donuts are fresh and you can't beat the prices when you compare it to the other popular places out there. Will definitely go back!"
MUST try lemon doughnuts. Never tasted anything close to these. Jimmy the owner VERY nice man came out and greeted me with a huge smile and INCREDIBLE attitude. Only complaint is there is a city ordinance which does NOT allow him to advertise on the street in front of HIS store. But STILL does not deter Jimmys mojo. A dozen doughnuts is cheaper here than at DD and there FRESH!!!
"Outstanding!The donuts are moist and flavorful, with that little ""crunch"" when you bite into them.  The blueberry is amazing, the apple is great, and even the good ol' old fashioned is on point.  I am definitely coming back again and again.  (Xsport will probably be seeing more of me as well, literally and figuratively) :)"
AMAZING secret spot! the donuts were awesome and it's always great to support a local-owned donut shop!
Forget dunkin. Its really no contest. Much better service and better prices. Gotta try the fritter and coffee next time. Ive only had the donuts and they were excellent. Easy parking. Great service. Real nice guy.
"One word = Yum.  Hard to stay away from this place, so glad to have them in the neighborhood!!!"
Wow!!!! I've died and gone to heaven sweet donut heaven!!!! Very nice people and great selection!!!
Can't say enough great things about this place. Not only are their sweets out of this world but Jimmy the owner was such a generous and so kind in offering lots of samples of his products since I was a first timer. I highly recommend this little gem. Fantastic quality beautiful ppl. You don't see this type of service and pride behind the product anymore
The donuts are fantastic and the man that runs this sweet shop is very kind.  We bought 6 donuts and a brownie.  All delicious!!  Looking forward to going back!
"The owner is awesome, he is so nice! My dad and I just walked in and he gave us free samples of doughnuts. The doughnuts are delicious and the smoothies are so fresh! This place is way better than any other doughnut place I have been to. I am definitely coming back with my dad!"
"This is my first time visiting this place and i loved the donuts here, taste good, affordable and lots of choices.  donuts are not so sweet but theres something sweet on it. Perfect for dessert or paired to coffee or milk. It is also a nice present for christmas , new year or any boday just visiting a friend. I highly recommend this place."
Love the donuts here!! They are so much better than the other chain restaurants that serve donuts (you know what I mean!) The only problem is they are highly addictive so beware!!
"So, we seriously over-bought when we stopped-in over the weekend, and, as a result, didn't get to try all of the varieties in our box since they are only good for a few days.  We did manage to get fresh beignets while there, and they were delicious hot!  They had a glaze on them instead of the powdered sugar, which was different, but still good.  I ate an old fashioned that night and it was delicious.  The French was not good the next morning but the cherry was.  Husband prefers the yeast donuts and he enjoyed the ones he ate.  I'm still a bigger fan of County Donuts, but this is closer and the owners are very nice."
Great little gem blocks from my house and didn't even know it forget Dunkin donuts this place has fresh donuts all day long sandwiches are also good had turkey other day was great this is my new go to spot.
"Wow, what a gem in my neighborhood.  I can't explain how much I love this place.  Not once have I come in and not left satisfied. Everything is always fresh and the assortment is great.  The shakes are delicious too. I look forward to trying more of what this wonderful, little place has to offer."
Amazing donuts! These donuts are the best! The blueberry crunch is out of this world! This is definitely my new Sunday morning hideout.
"Love the donuts, mango smoothie is soooo good, and prices are very reasonable!  Service was very excellent!  Even got free samples of new donut flavors!  I can't wait to go back again!!  I highly recommend this place who loves fresh donuts and addictive smoothies!!!"
