Kerelys Pizzeria & Cafe
"Excellent food, and very friendly staff.Went here with my SO earlier this week and we were both very impressed. My media noche sandwich was superb, and the papas rellenas were seriously heavenly. The yucca with garlic and the wife's chicken pesto sandwich didn't disappoint either. Really happy to have a place like this in the neighborhood, and I can't wait to get back here and try the jibaritos."
This place is great! The staff recommended very good choices. My friends and I all shared sandwiches and all three were delicious! I also got the papaya milkshake and it was very refreshing.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.
"Excellent Cuban food, delicious pizza,  friendly staff and clean restaurant.  All of my friends said they were happy I picked this restaurant. The food was tasty and interesting, and had lots of flavor. They made me a veggie jibarrito sandwich even though it's not in the menu. I loved the Cuba and cheese empanadas - it's a dessert empanada."
"Everything is made fresh to order, and the menu keeps on expanding! I had the veggie jibarito, which was not the on the menu. However, they were happy to accommodate my request; it was delicious! My husband had the media noche sandwich, and he pretty much devoured it!"
Loved the chicken Cuban sandwich. Friendly staff. Try the coffee here! You won't be disappointed.
"They have a good variety of items on the menu and for reasonable prices. I was surprised how good their pizza is, can't wait to go back."
"When you walk your eyes are rewarded with the cleanliness. As soon as you taste the food your tastebuds are satisfied with rich flavors & freshness. I ordered the Ropa Vieja sandwich and was extremely satisfied. The onions & bell peppers are cooked perfectly and meat is fresh, well seasoned and soft. An ill-prepared Ropa Vieja demands a strong jaw for chewing, but this Ropa Vieja only demands a big appetite. I decided to remove the top bread because I wanted to still fit into my skinny jeans. : ) I will definitely be back to try the Cuban...stay tuned."
The Ropa Vieja Sandwich was excellent! Service was friendly! Place was super clean! I am coming back for more.
New to the neighborhood and worth a visit.  We had the ropa vieja sandwich with fries and the personal size margherita pizza and both were great.  We ordered it for pickup and the service was good. We'll for sure go back and try other things on the menu.  Looks like a good variety.
So good!!!!!   The food was delicious.  And the place is super clean.  Everyone there is so nice.  Must try.
"This place is good I've been here twice and the food options have gotten better. I recommend the regular Cuban sandwich, buffalo wings, margarita pizza, and the BBQ chicken pizza"
We were across the street and saw this place. We walked in and the place is super clean. But the sandwiches were delish. I had the ropa vieja and it was amazingly good. I highly recommend.
The Cuban sandwiches here are to die for.  The steak sandwich with onions and tomatoes are seasoned perfection.  This is a great addition to the neighborhood!
Really good sandwiches! We ordered for pick up so I didn't really get to experience the actual restaurant. My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich and I ordered the ropa vieja sandwich. Both were delicious! We live 2 minutes away so I can't wait to keep trying more from their menu!
One of my favorite Ropa Vieja sandwiches in the city. Can't wait to try their Cuban pizzas.
"The sandwiches are awesome, you gotta try the pan con timba, it's soooo good by it self or with a cup of coffee. My new favorite spot."
"the owner is really nice but more and most importantly, the food and drinks are always delicious!!! it's also really clean inside which is #dope"
"This place is great. The coffee is strong and delicious, the staff is friendly, and the restaurant is clean and modern. The Cuban sandwich is perfect and their french fries are crispy. I highly recommend it!"
