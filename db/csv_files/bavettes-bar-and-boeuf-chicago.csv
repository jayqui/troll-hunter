Bavette’s Bar & Boeuf
"I think this is going to be on the top of our list when we would like to go out for a steak. They had so much flavor and were cooked to perfection.  Started off with the one of the salads along with the Bone Marrow appetizer. The Bone Marrow is a bit out of the box for us, but was very good. Not sure I would do it again only because of the consistency and outside the box for us. My wife has the filet and I had the ribeye which were both great. Also had the baked potato and the side of bacon. Never seen bacon as a side, but, if you like bacon, you must try this out. The service was excellent also. Had Daniel as the waiter and not sure who the bus boy was, but was also excellent."
"I definitely underestimated Bavette's! I honestly didn't have any expectation for Bavette's since it's a bar/restaurant. My friend insisted on checking this place out so we ended up making reservations. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation and went to the bar to grab a drink. We were lucky to grab seats at the bar and the bartender told us that we could just eat at the bar if we wanted to. Love that this place has an extensive list of entrees including steak, chicken, lamb, fish, pork chop, and etc. I guarantee you'll be able to find something you like at Bavette's.Had no idea what to order and the bartender recommended the filet mignon. He told me it's the best filet mignon in Chicago. Who wouldn't say that about their own restaurant though right?! Didn't wait long before my filet came. Cooked to perfection (medium rare) and the meat just melted in my mouth!! Bartender mentioned sprinkling a pinch of sea salt for flavor if needed but no garnishes/sauces were needed for this filet. Full of flavor and felt like I was in heaven for a few minutes!! Hands down one of the BEST filet mignon's that I ever had in my life!Great ambiance, service, and lastly incredible food! Chicago has some amazing restaurant, but this one knocks it out the park! I would recommend making reservations in advance since this place is popping. Coming back next time I'm in town!"
"I really like this place, and recommend it, though I am frustrated by how difficult it is to reserve a table, only to find, every time I'm there, that there are plenty of empty tables. Last night my cognac Sazerac was spot on. My Classic Ribeye - Chicago Cut was, like the last two times I was there, delicious and cooked perfeI really like this place, and recommend it, though I am frustrated by how difficult it is to reserve a table, only to find, every time I'm there, that there are plenty of empty tables. Last night my cognac Sazerac was spot on. My Classic Ribeye - Chicago Cut was, like the last two times I was there, delicious and cooked perfectly ""(""Pittsburgh rare""). My companion said her Halibut special (with a parsley/red onion side salad) was terrific. I was less enamored of the sides. The Pommes Frites were just fries, but they were good (not great) fries, with a nice garlic aioli, the Elote Style Corn did absolutely nothing for me (though my companion seemed to like it), and, like the Elote, the Wild Mushrooms were, to my mind, so-so at best. The Lemon Meringue Pie was delicious--and steakhouse-sized--though I personally prefer a little more lemony (and lemon curd-like) pie filling. Here, it was more like lemon cream, if there is such a thing. My only other comment is that on prior visits, the room was darker. It is still a somewhat dark space, but now I think they've lost some of the charm with a little too much light. The lower light gave everyone a candlelight glow that was quite appealing.Re-reading this review, it sort of doesn't sound like I'd give this place 4 stars, but I totally do. It's a fine place to eat, and, even in the face of so many excellent choices in that area and beyond, this is a place worth going to."
"Can I have six stars? Best meal ever. I don't even know where to start. CocktailsI had the Lillet Rosé Martini, I am a huge St. Germaine fan. All the typical ingredients you'd want with it but the perfect amount. I didn't try anything else. I was sold. He had the Mint Julep and the Sazerac. Both amazing and very strong. FoodWe started with the Apple and Mixed Greens salad, the candied pecans and manchego cheese made this perfect. It was a nice light starter without getting to full before your main.  Then I had the 10 oz filet, this was the best steak I've had in Chicago. Crust was amazing, still medium rare inside. He had the Dry Aged Bone-in Ribeye, flavor was again, amazing, so juicy! Very well rested, the juice was inside the steak, not running out. Then we had the Elote Corn, what in the world?! Crazy. Creamy, cheesy, cilantro, lime, chili... The best Mexican style corn I've ever had. Lastly, the Mashed Potatoes with garlic and gravy. Simple and wonderful, no Italian can complain about garlic cloves on their food. DessertYes, save room or just eat it anyway. The Chocolate Creme Pie. The crust was almost like a brunt brownie, it made the pie and whipped cream even out so well. The pie is insanely rich and decadent. I always say, I need chocolate. Well, this is the chocolate I need. Wow! Lastly, don't eat all day! We had breakfast, worked out, snacked light and our reservation was at 10pm. Just don't eat. It's worth it!"
"A perfect rating indeed! Bavette's NEVER disappoints. Say it with me now..N-E-V-E-R  disappoints. Ambiance is old fashioned steak house meets the contemporary coolness of all Brendan Sodikoff's establishments. Bavette's encompasses all that a steak house should. The man and I came here last Monday for a much longed-for second meal here. We were seated upstairs this time and just a tip, if you can, request to sit in the ""parlor"". It's super sexy and you won't regret it. Moving on...food/drinks:The mans went with his usual - old fashioned. Very yummy and had great, smooth flavor. Also, they give you just about any option for your old fashioned to include bourbon, scotch, whiskey, cognac. I mean, it's legit. I was interested in a robust, yet not punch you in the face red. I opted for the Sangiovese and it proved to be perfect for what I was feeling. Appetizer - garlic shrimp de jongheMains - short rib stroganoff and the bone in dry aged rib eyeSides - elote style corn and roasted tomatoesDessert - lemon meringue pieI have not one bad thing to say about any of it. I can't, it would be a sin. If you are getting steak, don't even think about looking further than the rib eye. Stroganoff melted in your mouth and fell apart just by looking at it. Corn was so creamy I couldn't even handle it. The pie was hilarious, it was 15 feet high with the whip cream. In short, anything and everything you get at Bavette's will knock your socks off. Love love love...one of my fav spots in Chicago!!!"
"Had a wonderful time and wanted to leave another stellar review, but honestly after 930+ reviews what the hell am I going to add to the conversation?The Meat is great.The Oysters are great.The wine is great.The drinks are great.The service is great.Hell, even the bread is great.Cool decor, very vintage. Go there. Bring your wallet. End of story."
"Bavette's is my favorite steakhouse to come to in the city because it does not feel like your typical upscale, overdone, business man's restaurant...that's not to say it won't cost you like one! It has an old time feel where you can still get all the same foods as your typical steak house, but the environment is much better. This is demonstrated especially well through their BYOB policy: Their corkage fee is that a glass of your bottle of wine must be given to someone in the restaurant of your choosing, perhaps someone celebrating a birthday, anniversary, or just your waitress whose service has been great! The food- the seafood is very fresh and can't be missed so definitely fit it into your appetizer so you can still get a steak for your meal (STRATEGY!). I highly recommend the crab stuffed avocado, very fresh with a great, light, citrusy flavor. The baked goat cheese and the crab cake are other favorites to start with. For your meal everyone of course prefers their own cut, if you don't, go for the steak frites, it's my personal favorite. As far as sides, the spinach and mushrooms are on point.You really can't go wrong here, if you've been going to the Gibson's and RPMs for too long, it's time to change and this is your move!"
"We ate downstairs at bar since we didn't have reservation. Great atmosphere. Riley did a great job serving and making all feel welcome. The food was excellent. We had beef tongue, Caesar salad, and crab cake( less breading would be good). Flavors delicious. Simple but flavorful."
"The food was good, the service was good, the menu was a good mix of Traditional and New American, but where Bavette's really stands out is the old-fashioned décor.  Calling the ambiance ""throwback"" seems insulting since this classic style of class never really left.The place was pretty crowded at dinnertime on Sunday, but there were a few open seats at the bar.  I overheard the hostess tell a party with reservations that they were waiting for another party to clear out, so if you're going with more than 2 people, be sure to plan ahead.Although Bavette's is beyond my usual dinner-budget, I'd happily throw on my 3-pieced suit and go back for an old-fashioned or 2."
"My review is based only on the food.  The steak was exceptional.  Their selection of meat is exquisite.  But, here is a big BUT, they bring the steak less seasoned than most high end steak places. It is simply bland!  Why would they do such a thing?? Because, they have this side of dry seasoning they bring to the table.  I suggest getting a few of those cups!  You can use them with the bread and you can even use them with the veggies!  But you should surely use them with the steak!  Layer it all over that big old piece of protein!  It is much better that way!  Bottom line, you can get equal elsewhere without seasoning, but once you add this dry rub the steaks and the side (with the seasonings) are a 5 star!!Very few places on Yelp at 4+ stars.  I can't give this place 5 because of the weak ""dessert card"" (yes, it is only a piece of paper).  I passed!  I don't need the calories, but I WANT some chocolate!  They did nothing to convince me or even push me to a cappuccino or after dinner drink!  I am moving on; there are better places nearby!  Four stars are it!"
"Bavette's is a great place for dinner. It's a different ambience from most of the trendy places in River North.  It's got that vintage 1940's feel.  If you revisit a menu from a fine dining restaurant of a bygone era, it will look eerily like Bavette's menu and ambience.  The food is good.  It really is, but you won't walk away thinking to yourself ""WOW!!!"" except when you look at your bill. My three visits were all for dinner.  I think one needs three visits to one place to really get an accurate understanding of a business, particularly a restaurant.  Entering Bavette's is an experience, it immediately reminds me of a lot of old stately restaurants in Washington DC, or an English gentlemen's club (I should clarify that there are no strippers in gentlemen's clubs in England. They are for the upper classes.  But that said, why do Americans call strip clubs ""gentlemen's clubs"" anyway?  I mean, if you're going in these places, you're hardly a gentleman, ogling women and salivating over reproductive organs. And frankly, I don't think the ""dancers"" really want you to act like a gentleman!  In fact, if a gentleman tried to defend their virtue, that's likely more than the dancer has ever done, right? Ok, I got that from Groucho Marx, but I digress.... )Aaaaaanyway.....my point is it's dark in there, and the appointments are refined and stately, rich wood bar, nice table cloths, beautifully decorated.  It's certainly a romantic place.  The food is very good.  My friend had the steak, and as a steak expert of sorts, he was singly impressed with the cut of meat and the way it was simply seasoned, aged, and cooked.  I don't know if Bavette's qualifies as a ""steak house"" but they certainly do steak very, very well. He had the Chicago Cut, which we both recommend since I was able to taste it. I had the chicken which granted, is standard fare but done very well. It was moist and tender, flavorful with the perfect hint of garlic and other herbs. The mashed potatoes were some of the best I've ever had, which surprised me because they don't boast the addition of sour cream, just lots and lots of garlic and butter, and then lots and lots of butter!  If you're concerned about clogged arteries, bring a defibrillator and buck-up.  It's worth the jump start your guest or waiter will have to give you. The garlic shrimp de jonghe was extremely good.  It's basic standard fare, but when shellfish is involved, given it is so temperamental, one cannot take for granted when it is well prepared.  Finally, I can't finish this review without noting that their strong suit is cocktails.  This is a place you come to for a good standard martini, a nice glass of fine bourbon, or a well made sazerac.  I think every bar should be measured by their ability to make a proper sazerac because it takes real talent, attention to detail, and care.  It truly is a hand-crafted cocktail when prepared properly.  These mixologists know how to muddle it just right so all the flavors blend and become one. The proper straining is also important, no one wants bits at the bottom of their glass.  Finally, good ingredients are of course important, and use of a proper glass should never be compromised by an ignorant or lazy bartender, or an iconoclastic management. And of course, NO ICE!  Well done Bavette's!!!!  Thank you for respecting the tradition of fine dining sans the pretension."
"Cute atmosphere, nice staff, but really dark lighting. The bone marrow was really tasty - I could have gone with another plate or two (or three), the aged ribeye my boyfriend got was good, the pork I ordered was good and the sides were typical sides. I wasn't too impressed with their seafood menu even though our server recommended it was the best of the best, but you can't beat seafood from the PNW. Drinks were well concocted and nice and strong! Was it the best steak I've had in my life? No. Would I come back in my next visit to Chicago? Probably not."
"I heard so many amazing things about Bavette's Bar & Boeuf from friends, co-workers, and fellow Yelpers, but trying to make reservations for dinner was always a hassle.  Finally, I scored reservations for dinner on a Friday night for two.  It was three months out, but nonetheless I was finally going to experience what the hype was all about.  I decided to invite my sister since she appreciates food as much as me.Like always, my sister eats with her eyes rather than what her stomach can handle.  But what the heck....we ordered:Baked Crab Cake: baked crab, preserved lemon, and remoulade.  It was such a breath of fresh air to see the crab cake was not deep fried or full of fillers, but baked with fresh crab meat instead.  This was a simple crab cake, but it surely didn't lack any flavor.Baked Goat Cheese: served with red sauce and garlic bread.  There is just something about goat cheese and marinara sauce together that I yearn for.  The red sauce was hearty and full of bold flavors which complimented the smooth and creamy goat cheese perfectly.6 oz Filet Mignon - Petite Duchess Cut:  served with roasted tomatoes, béarnaise sauce, and watercress.  With all the food we ordered, I was so glad the filet mignon was only 6 ounces.  It was the perfect size for little old me.  The cook and the seasoning was spot on.Double Bone Berkshire Pork Chop: served with herb jus and lemon.  This was my sister's entrée.  She really enjoyed everything about this pork chop.  She stated that it was really tender and juicy.  The herb jus and lemon was the perfect topping to enhance the natural flavors of the pork.Elote Style Corn: chili, lime, cilantro, and parmesan.  I'm always reluctant to order elote style corn from any restaurant because it never tastes the same as the street vendors and it is just way more expensive.  But everyone was telling me that I had to try it here, so I again went against my gut and ordered the corn.  It definitely didn't taste like the authentic elote, but Bavatte's spin on it was still good.  The corn was creamy and the lime and chili gave it an extra zing. Chocolate Pie: this was the perfect ending to our feast.  The crust was rich and buttery, the filling was smooth and full of chocolate flavor, and the whipped cream was light and airy.Overall, many kudos to the chefs at Bavette.  Everything from the appetizers to dessert was perfectly cooked and flavored.  The service here was also phenomenal.  Our waiter was attentive without being too intrusive.  I can't wait until I have a chance to go back."
"It was very good, but not the best steak or meal I ever had to be worthy of its 5 star reputation and #2 in Chicago Trip Advisor rating.  They had great oysters, some of the best I ever had. They had an awesome drink menu, certainly good place for drinks. Their service was great. The ambiance is dark and romantic, with good ol' boy decor and classic touches. Very Chi-town. Their sides are delicious, like the Elote corn. Very good. Their steak was great, but nothing that special. I was not blown away by the food. I liked it and was glad we came, but for the hefty price tag I wonder if there are actually better steaks in Chicago. The dessert wasn't amazing either. It was good, but I guess given the rating, the reviews and the price I expected a lot more.Background Story: My husband and I were in Chicago for just three nights. One night we were meeting up with friends, who wanted to take us dinner and dancing at Untitled. The other we had long time made reservations (tickets purchased) at Alinea, Chicago's number one. So without too much planning we left the third night open, and while in town decided we still had to do two things: eat a deep dish pizza and go to a steak house. So the night before we stopped by the concierge desk (we were staying at the Langham) and the amazing concierge gave us several options. We looked them up on trip advisor and asked him to call. Bavette's was our number one choice. He said when he called Bavette's said they did not have any tables at all. So he made us reservations at Chicago Cut. BUT he mentioned that if we were able to get to Bavette's when they open, at 5:00PM, we would have a chance at walking in and getting a table because they save tables for walk ins in their main dining room. And voila, indeed they did. We walked in at 5:00PM on Sunday July 12th and got ourselves a nice table in the main dining room (it was not a booth but we weren't complaining). So if you call or go to opentable and don't see any reservations available simply go the night you want at 5:00PM and most likely you will be seated. I thought that was a nice thing they do."
Just shut up and take my money.All of it.
"I ordered the bone in dry aged ribeye, the steak and frites, and the thick cut bacon. Was it the best steak I've ever had? Probably not, but it was certainly decent. But their bacon!! So damn good. I think it's the best thick cut bacon I've ever had. I loved the maple and the black pepper together. They are known for their bone in dry aged ribeye, so definitely get that when you go. Worth a try, definitely a satisfying meal."
"Miserable. I left Bavette's miserable. I ate so much I felt like my stomach needed to explode for some chance of relief. I really are too much. I could not help myself. And in the end, I paid for it. But, it was a great feeling because the food was just that good. Mind blowing. Shrimp de Jonghe (5 stars) The shrimp were served with Flavored Texas Toast  and sitting in a difficult to explain sauce which was good enough to drink with a straw. I thought the toast was a star in its own but when dipped in the sauce, I genuinely wished there was more bread. After all, there is only so much sauce you can get on a slice of toast and I did not want this sauce to go to waste. Buttery Mashed Potatoes with garlic and chicken au jus (4 stars) Pepper Thick Cut Bacon (4 stars)  Very different. Meaty and Flavorful. Best if shared with a group IMO. One bite was enough for me. 16oz Bone In Filet (5 stars) Never as good as the first time but pretty darn close. It was remarkably tender and extremely flavorful. The bernaise sauce was the perfect compliment. Also, the waiter offered to have it sliced which we happily accepted. ...And it was cheaper this visit. $68.95; down from $76. Elote Style Corn (5 stars) Seriously mind blowing, I wish I could have eaten more good. A must get if dining here. T bone of Lamb (3 stars) Very good. But each side was different. I was less than pleased with the side with a game like flavored. Service, Decor & Ambiance (4 stars) Good but as it should be at this price point. Cocktail (4 stars)I really enjoyed my Lillet Rose cocktail. It was light, sweet and refreshing. Still a winner!"
"This is my favorite bar in Chicago, bar none. I am guiltily outing my Mecca, my church, my heaven. As it goes for almost all my 5 star places, I will elaborate no further."
"Honestly, I could not find even a tiny flaw in anything here! Gorgeous speakeasy style space with perfect mood lighting & stellar service. We started with old school prohibition style cocktails: Belle Mead Old Fashioneds for my dining companions and a Dark & Stormy for me. No complaints here! Appetizers of the sweetest oysters, crab cake loaded with lump crab and peppered duck pate enhanced with an apricot sauce that were all expertly presented and prepared. My filet was like butter! So flavorful, tender and perfectly medium rare with sides of maple peppered bacon, wild mushrooms and corn unlike any corn I've ever tasted. It's called Elote Style Corn with chili, lime cilantro & Parmesan and it's killer!Our family members have been here a few times and insisted that we should join them during our visit to Chicago. You know, they're seriously onto something really good here! Loved it!!!"
"Can I give it 10 stars?!  This is by far my favorite steakhouse of all time.  The dining experience is second to none.  From the dark, romantic corners to the amazingly friendly and knowledgeable servers, I cannot speak more highly of any restaurant in Chicago.First thing's first, know that you are allowed to bring your own bottle of wine.  Their policy as far as the corkage fee is that you send a glass of your wine over to another table.  Small price to pay!  On our last visit (for our wedding anniversary) we sent a glass to an older couple.  They were kind enough to even send us a glass of their lovely cab!Bavette's has such depth in character!  I love the dark, intimate corners.  They serve you on delicate floral plates that they buy from antique stores all over the country.The bone marrow is a must!  So rich, creamy, and perfect with their flaky yet soft bread!  I've only ever ordered steak here as my entree and I've never been disappointed.  Cooked to perfection!This is definitely my go-to restaurant for special occasions!"
"Outstanding all around! Read positive reviews on Yelp and its on the Eater 38 list so I made reservation during a recent trip to Chicago. We went at 10pm on a Friday, the place was packed but we were seated right away. We had a big booth for the 2 of us across from the bar. The place was gorgeous, dimly lit, perfect for a date. Food: I started with an apple an mixed greens salad which was very good. My boyfriend had the bone marrow which he loved - he said it was decadent and was pleasantly surprised at the large portion. For our meal we both had the 10 oz filet - they were perfectly cooked. The knife slid through the beef like butter! And we shared pomes frites which were very tasty.Drinks: Great cocktail list! I enjoyed a French 75 and my boyfriend had a Manhattan. Only strange thing was I asked for a Pimm's Cup and I was told they didn't have Pimm's which I found surprising. Service: Fantastic! Our waiter was attentive and down to earth making it an enjoyable night. Can't wait to visit Chicago and Bavette's again!"
"We really enjoyed our visit to Bavette's.  We ate in the basement and really loved the atmosphere down there.  The food was excellent.  I had the lamb chops which were perfectly prepared.  So moist and so flavorful.  My wife had the rib-eye which she also really enjoyed. She loved the marbling and the flavors that were created.  She had the Lillet Rose Martini and she absolutely loved it.  The seasoning they make for your meat is incredible.  We really enjoyed the mashed potatoes - loaded with flavor!  Great service, although a tad slow, our waiter was helpful and courteous.  Next time I will try the filet - was a tad bit disappointed I didn't get to try it, but the lamb just looked too good to pass us.  I don't think you can go wrong with anything here."
"Very similar to Gilt Bar.  Right next door and may even share the same kitchen cuz there seem to be a lot of similar items on the menu but made a little differently.  Salmon tartare was good (same as Gilt) Duck n goat cheese terrine was ok Bone marrow good (same as Gilt) Oysters were bomb!  Liked the west coast better.  Lamb was good!  Beautifully cooked!Fried chicken...I know, fried chicken, right?  But it was pretty darn delish!  If I had to choose I would go back to Gilt before Bavettes."
"I'll help you out. It's not hard to be right at this place, it's all very good.  1. Wedge Salad - bacon and big enough for two. 2. Steak and Frites - a great option at a great price point. Enough fries for two. 3. Chicago Ribeye - the sauce is good, the spices on the side are fine BUT you won't need either - the steak is that good and seasoned perfectly. 4. Chocolate Pie - It's awesome. Ask for Aime - she'll help you with a friendly smile.Great special night out place."
"Game over. Bavette's served me one of the best meals I've had in the US, if not the best.  Everything. Was. Perfect. I had a malbec, the dry aged ribeye (medium rare of course), the elote corn, and a bit of the bread and butter. Since I was dining solo I only nibbled on a corner of the bread but oh my god, that was perfect too. Cultured butter. Warm, crusty, chewy bread. I am not much of a wine drinker, but the malbec was such a good choice. It complimented the meat so well. The corn- wow. Creamy, a slight chew, with the perfect amount of acidity. I can't really compare it to anything else because I haven't had anything quite like it. I think it was supposed to mirror elote loco? (I haven't had it yet). As for the ribeye- A slight funk in the background, the lightest tang, melt-in-your-mouth tender with the perfect amount of fat. The ""grey"" area was so minimal- just perfectly cooked meatiness waiting for your mouth. This cow did not die in vain. It didn't need béarnaise but the béarnaise itself was so marvelous that you can't help but to eat it too just because it's also so good and complimented the steak so well. The service was quick, attentive, warm, friendly, and un-pretentious. Getting a ""good steak"" in DC means snotty servers that ignore younger guests for fussy older folks. Not here obviously. Just 100% pure, comforting, meat bliss. The place is so dark and comfortable I felt like I was in a meat opium den. Makes me want to quit eating steak in DC because everything else will just disappoint me after having this meal. No detail was spared. I mean, seriously. Absolutely perfect. Most restaurants have ""weak spots"" where some part of the dining experience is an afterthought and they compensate with their ""star"" dish(es). It could be a sloppy, cold lump of butter with the bread. It could be mediocre, sloppily poured drinks. It could be generic sides. Average sauces. Everything I ate was just honestly perfect. Next time I'm in town I will be sure to book Bavette's again."
"The food was quite good, but for $290 for dinner for two, you expect the service to be flawless. The service had flaws. We arrived on-time (~1-2 minutes early for our reservation and checked in + checked our coats. We were directed to the waiting area where we sat for almost 10 minutes before a waiter came to offer us a drink menu. We then selected drinks, but it took nearly another 10 minutes to get him back to take our drink order. Mind you, this whole time we were watching our table... Clean and waiting for us... Not 2 minutes after placing our drink order, The hostess then decided to seat us but before she did abruptly stopped and walked off to see if it would ""even be possible"" to transfer our drink order. Once we were seated our waiter attempted to take our drink order again but finally we communicated that we already had an order and eventually got the drinks. We had to ask him about recommendations though... He didn't offer them up until we asked.  We started ordering a starter (duck terrine) and the waiter tool my husbands menu away!  So we then had to share a menu to decide what to order. Turns out I didn't like the duck terrine, but my husband did. We both liked the salad and fresh bread -- the bread was amazing. We liked our steaks as well. My other service issues -- they took away my husband's drink when he was still drinking it (and they aren't cheap cocktails!). Another is that they didn't even ask about coats so we had to go to the front and wait for them while the staff was huffy with us. My final qualm is that I had bites of steak cut and specifically said I wanted everything on my plate boxed. I opened it to eat it today and found none of my bites -- with the price of the steaks, those were like $5 bites each!!!Anyway, the service doesn't match the price. 3 stars, yep just 3 stars."
"May be one of my favorite restaurants ever. Incredible service, food, drinks and atmosphere! Perfect!Those lamb chops were, hands down, the best I've ever eaten. And I've eaten many a lamb chop. Not crazy about the corn, the waiter comped it, and promptly brought out some mashed potatoes that were the height of garlicky, creamy perfection. Incredible meal, be sure to make a reservation far in advance."
"Top steakhouse in Chicago, arguably the best in a city that is well known for steaks!Bavette, owned by the Au Cheval Group, breaks the traditional elegant steakhouse concept. Bavette offers a slightly more casual (yet modern) style with no white tablecloths and no tuxedo waiters. The food is DELICIOUS! A creative menu that offers both great starters, salads, seafood, fish, and (of course) wonderful steaks!To start we ordered a shrimp and an oyster platter: fresh, very decently sized and great taste! We followed with a salad and bone marrow: unbelievable, awesome taste. And our steaks (I ordered a ribeye) were just cooker perfectly medium rare! For sides we had the ""Elote""... wow, I can't believe how incredibly delicious this was, we even ordered a second round of it!Unbelievable meal, definitely not a cheap place, but the quality of the food and great service made the best out of our evening. No wonder Bavette is currently rated on TripAdvisor as Best Restaurant (of any kind) in all of Chicago! - As of Jan. 2015"

"I made dinner reservations on a Tuesday evening for my bf's belated birthday celebration. The only open reservation (on Open Table) was at 8:45pm, but when we arrived, I saw many open tables. We were seated not too long after our arrival, but it wasn't until we were already seated at our table did the hostess ask if we wanted to check in our coats. It was hard deciding which appetizer to start off with. So upon recommendation from our waitress, we decided on the peppered duck & goat cheese terrine, which she mentioned was a staff favorite that was often overlooked by guests. This appetizer was presented in more of a pâté fashion, with a side of apricot mustard and toast. The combination, especially with the apricot spread, was absolute delectable & a must try!For our entree, we shared the 22oz. bone in dry aged ribeye & added the roasted bone marrow, along with a side of elote style corn. The ribeye was mouthwatering and cooked medium rare to perfection. Every bite was tender, and only close to the bone was the meat too raw (for me). The elote style corn was good, as all corn is usually, but the dish was WAY too salty. We each had a few tiny spoonfuls and that was all we could withstand. For such a fine establishment, I am appalled by the less than excellent service. For starters, as stated previously, there were many open tables around in the restaurant but they sat us less than 2 feet from a table of 4 gentlemen who were talking very..VERY loudly. We had a late reservation with not many guests coming in after us. On top of that, bread was not brought to our table until asked and when our bottle of water was empty, they would remove it but forgot to bring another one back. I wanted to give our waitress the benefit of the doubt -- perhaps they were understaffed -- but I would frequently see her just hanging out by the bar area. I started off wanting to give them 4 stars, but the more that I am reminded of the awful service, the more I am able to justify my 3 star rating. Not sure how likely we are to return, as there are so many other great restaurants in the city that offers good food AND good service."
"Best steak in Chicago. Absolutely love this place. Everything about it is fantastic. The location, the decor, the drinks, the food and the staff are all awesome. The elote was just wow. Yeah, ""wow."" Only downside is you'll be hard pressed to get a reservation at a normal time (anything earlier than 9 PM). But, pro tip, the bar does serve the full menu and is usually empty enough to find a spot for 2 people."
"I've had this place bookmarked on Yelp since last November, so you can imagine how excited I was to eat!From the moment you walk past the hostess desk, it's like you stepped into the past. Gold lightening, chandeliers, jazz music and vintage seating. I was so impressed and I hadn't even sat down yet!My waiter, Joel was really attentive and had great recommendations. Awesome wine and cognac list. The oysters were huge and delicious (I always go west coast because they're not as fishy) ((ask for Hama Hama))We ordered the chicago cut steak and their signature rib eye. MUST try the rib eye. The creamed spinach was better than the elotes in my opinion. The elotes didn't live up to their hype on yelp  But honestly this place is my absolute favorite I would have to bring everyone I know here for the food and experience. Thank you Bavettes for a great birthday!"
"Bavette's has been on my list of places to try for the longest time and I finally got the chance to go on a random Monday night. We had a later reservation, but they were able to seat us a little earlier once everyone in the party arrived.Ambiance: Usually I'm all about the food and don't really focus too much on the ambiance, but I gotta admit that Bavette's is a pretty cool spot. It has that whole speakeasy vibe with dim lighting and old-school furniture everywhere. Drinks: They had 3 types of old fashioneds. I tried the Old Overholt and the Belle Meade. Both were real good. The Belle Meade was probably my favorite of the two since it was bourbon based.Food: The food is pretty much the only reason I wanted to come to this place. I've been to some of Sodikoff's other restaurants and I haven't been disappointed yet. We couldn't really decide what to get so we ended up ordering a ton of stuff.Bread - The free bread was actually really good. It was warm and pillowy sourdough bread that came with some house-made butterShortrib Stroganoff - Since we were all getting steaks as our entree, we just ended up getting this as our appetizer since its a popular dish that we all wanted to try. The shortribs had a good bold flavor and were fall apart tender. The stroganoff had a real rich, creamy sauce that we ended up sopping up with the leftover bread. Goddamn my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Definitely recommend trying this entree. Roasted bone marrow - Typical fatty goodness. A few of the bones were really shallow and didn't have as much filling. I need my marrow fix! haha. Note: If at least two people planned on adding a bone marrow to their steak, might as well get the bone marrow entree since it comes with 3 bones, toast, and jam and its the same price as two add-ons.Classic Chicago cut Ribeye - Wow, the steak was just so tender and fatty...my knife cut right through it. Just a solid steak made with good quality meat, prepared the simple way. It came with a thick bearnaise sauce too but I didn't think the steak needed it.Mashed potatoes - Sounds boring but it was actually really good. Came with some sort of chicken gravy and had full cloves of garlic hidden throughout. Elote style corn - It seemed a little out of place among the other traditional steakhouse sides but it was probably my favorite of all the side dishes. It was very creamy and tangy and had a nice little kick of spice to it.Thick cut bacon - What's not to love about really thick peppered bacon. Pretty much the same dish that you can order at Au Cheval.Chocolate cream pie / whiskey ice cream - The pie was surprisingly light and the chocolate crust on it was money. Maybe it's because we ate and drink so much, but I think a scoop of plain vanilla ice cream would've been more refreshing after we went beast mode on all that food. Can't really pass up even more whiskey for dessert though.Service: Our waitress checked up on us pretty frequently and answered all our questions about the food and drinks. Waters were never empty. No complaints here.Overall: It was pretty much a solid dinner. It was on the pricier side, but you sort of expect that from a steakhouse. Being a fan of both Au Cheval and Sodikoff's other places, I knew I'd love the food. Just some real flavorful, rich, meat and potatoes style cuisine. None of the dishes were super unique or something I haven't tried before, but I can't deny that everything was damn tasty."
AWESOME food and service!!! A great experience that's a must when in Chicago!! You won't be disappointed!!
"I love this restaurant. There are few restaurants that really impress me with the ambiance as well as the food. After coming here a second time, I had to up my review to 5 stars. This time around we relished on the oyster tray (4 types of oysters, 2 east coast and 2 west coast - and you get 3 oysters of each type so 12 oysters total). All were delicious. Would recommend the champagne sauce on the east coast oysters as those are saltier than the west coast oysters.We also enjoyed their chocolate cream dessert with a french press cup of coffee featuring Bowtruss beans. That combination is absolutely perfect. A bite of that chocolate mousse cake (I forgot the name but it's a signature chocolate dessert on their menu) and then a sip of the warm french press mingled together in the mouth equals an absolutely beautiful mixture of light yet rich sweetness plus a roasty coffee finish. I still think about that combination - even days later.Also - if you're a big bread person, they have amazing bread. Dense, soft, with crispy crust that come in huge slices... oh my.... that is all I will say about the bread...Whoever did the interior decorating to this place did an impressive job. It's warm and inviting, yet intimate and romantic. You feel like you walked into another era, I don't know if it's the 1920's or the 1960's... I'm no historian so forgive me... Looking around makes me feel like I'm watching scenes from a movie, only with modern dressed and trendy looking diners throughout the restaurant. Even the bartenders' outfits add to the atmosphere.All in all, in my personal opinion, this place is pretty memorable for me. I've been lucky to try some really great restaurants around Chicago over the past year or so, and this is one of the few that stand out to me. I highly recommend trying, and I mean trying, to get a reservation here. It'll be worth it."
"Very nice prohibition-themed spot. Gorgeous fun interesting room. Food was excellent without being life changing. Ribeye was the highlight - oh and the sauce on the garlic shrimp. Nice service too! Totally great, but a tad overhyped."
Dined here for my 10 year anniversary with my boyfriend.  Crazy good drinks.  I give it a 10 for the atmosphere.  It was worth it for the oysters alone.  It was expensive.. but we knew what we were getting ourselves into.  5 stars!
"I can't believe it took me so long to get to Bavette's.  I've been wanting to check it out since they opened and now that it's not too far from my place I finally made it.  I think the highlight of the night for me was my cocktail (shocker, right?).  I had the lillet rosé martini and it was really good.  Second on the list was the décor.  The cozy vintage hideaway feeling makes me want to relax, order another drink, and enjoy the company (not necessarily in that order).  Now, in the event you care about the steak at a steak place and not just the drinks and comfort like I do.....the food was almost all very good.  I tried some of the smoked trout caesar salad and it was very good.  I love caesar salads and this one might be at the top of my list now.  The salmon was also very good, cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  We had some oysters that were also yummy.  The steak however was not cooked as ordered, which is a problem if you wanna call yourself a steak place.  This should be the thing you definitely get right.  I had some of the elotes too and while they were good, they didn't remind me of elotes much.  So, I loved the drink, I was comfy and smiley, the food was very good, so why only 3 stars you ask?  (If you didn't ask you should still keep reading)  The service was not great.  It was not overtly bad, but we left fairly cranky about a few things considering the amount of the bill.  First, one of the martini glasses was chipped, normally not a big deal but this was ""I'll cut you!"" chipped.  The server apologized and got a new glass.  Not a huge deal.  Then there was the severely undercooked steak.  The server did notice it was not cooked as ordered and apologized but at least half of it couldn't be eaten as it was.  Again, on it's own not a *huge* deal, but a restaurant on this level should get this right, that's why we're here.  We asked for a dessert menu and would've ordered something but it took the server about 15 minutes to come back and ask if we wanted anything.  At that point we just wanted to leave.  Now we have a chipped glass, an almost raw piece of meat, and not so attentive service.  Wouldn't be all that annoying except the $$$ on the bill.  Not even a comp'd drink for the hiccups?  Maybe the offer of a complimentary dessert to apologize for the little snafus?  Nope.  So those top two stars went home in a doggy bag with the steak (I believe some steak and eggs were made, probably at least worth 2 stars).  I'll try Bavette's again, but my expectations have shifted."
WOW! Insert emoji with big heart eyes here. Great Atmosphere! The best cocktails in Chicago! Yes I said it. The steak is really good too. The decor is super fancy with a hint of old style Chicago style. In the basement area is a bit more modern. I think if I lived in downtown Chicago I would definitely frequent here for the cocktails. Would recommend the elote style corn and the beef tongue. Bavette's is a good place for love birds and/or business dinner.
"Beautiful speakeasy meets gatsby ambiance. The underground parlor room is perfect for a romantic dinner and a tad quieter than the upstairs. Service was fabulous, good wine list, and for a steak and potatoes Midwest girl their filet, broccoli, and mashed potatoes were to die. The only regret I have is not having any room left to try all the other things that looked so good on the menu. Perfect date night or anniversary dinner spot. Steakhouse meets romantic hideaway. Amazing selection of old fashioneds that cater to any flavor profile preference."
"My boyfriend and I have been trying to come here for months now and finally came out on a Tuesday. Although we had reservations, the place did not seem too packed. Immediately upon arrival, we entered a dim room that seemed to be only lit by candles...talk about romantic! The hostess was very welcoming and all the workers were super friendly and on top of their job. Our waitress was very knowledgable on the menu and very attentive. We started off with the foie gras and both agreed it was pretty good, but the highlight of it was the blackberry jam. For our entrees, I ordered the duchess cut filet with a side of fries and my boyfriend ordered the chicago cut. I absolutely LOVED my steak. Hands down, the best steak I ever had. I made quite the perfect choice ordering a blue cheese topping. My boyfriend loved his ribeye and said the best part of it, despite the phenomenal steak, was the bearnaise sauce. Another highlight was the fries! Hot and crispy to perfection. The side of sauce was delicious although I do not know what it was exactly. Overall the portions left us way to stuffed to even consider dessert! Although arguably the best steak house downtown, you definitely don't get the pretentious feel that many of the other steak greats strive for! Fantastic meal, fantastic ambience, and fantastic staff! If you get the chance to try Bavettes it's a must!"
"Best Ribeye I have EVER had.  22oz dry aged. 5 STARS!  Tender, very bold beef flavor, just as you would expect from aged beef.Shrimp was Ahhh, probably just a bad catch.  bread was chewy with a good crisp crust. Asparagus was grilled and very good.The lighting is very Dark.  My only real complaint... The wood chairs which are tough on my back.  Not too loud, and not awkwardly quiet either.Staff was attentive right down to the bus boy who folded my napkin when I left the table, to the GM who boxed my leftovers."
"I've been having some fantastic experiences recently and as a result, I've become a bit of a 5 star whore as a result.One of them was at Bavette Bar & Beouf in Chicago. I've had the opportunity to spend 4 days a week for 1.5 years in Chicago commuting there weekly from NY; I've gotten to know and love the city from many angles. Except for those blustery cold snowy days in February....ugh.Anyway, I had met up with some friends locally and this was the spot they chose. These guys are fabulous - I can't tell you how fantastic everything was, from the gimlet at the bar, to the appetizers, efficient and accommodating service, flexibility of my ordering and dining style, nailing my black-n-blue (very rare cold center with crust) steak, along with the ambience and decor. The vibe here is speakeasy combined with male oriented steakhouse elegance, with a touch of everyday casual dining attached with servers who rock.I will definitely be returning upon my next visit to Chi-town....I wasn't able to get some deep dish pizza because of this scheduled dinner and I wasn't missing it at all after the experience I had.PS - they're oyster tastings were stellar, so much so, we had done a few rounds of them. Keep up the stellar work guys...THIS has been a review by Gaurav"
"Came here with my fiancé and my parents. Overall we had a completely wonderful experience and meal. This place is a total gem. Some highlights: The roasted chicken might sound slightly boring, but it is NOT. It is amazing! It's half a chicken, the skin is crispy yet the meat is super tender, and it comes with this delectable pan jus with roasted garlic cloves that melt in your mouth. Get this! For a ""side"" I ordered the wedge salad. Well! It can very easily feed 3 people, and was a huge hit. Everything else we got was superb. Only gripe? Well, $16 for a martini kinda rubs me the wrong way, and it was smaller than last time I was here. I mean, come on. I know this place is fancy and pricey but $16 is plain ridiculous (martinis are my favorite drink but I just can't recommend spending that much on one). Other than that blip, I highly, highly recommend this place. It's not somewhere we'd go often because of how expensive it is, but for a once-in-a-while treat or special occasion, it's my go-to choice in the city."
"Awesome decor, and design. They have a good wine selection. The food itself was very good as well. The kitchen had some issues so they gave us a bunch of free food to tie us over. They ended up taking off the wine and some of the food (which was impressive since I got a $120 bottle). I would come back for sure, this place is a gem. I would give 5 stars if we didn't wait over an hour for our food."
"6 stars. The peppered duck and goat cheese terrine was probably one of the best items I've eaten in a very long time. The lamb t-bone was perfectly cooked.This place has so many nice touches that I really don't know where to start. One of my favorites was the 2"" square ice cube they put in your drink. I usually get a glass of whiskey before a steak dinner and it was nice having this little glacier in my glass to add a chill but not water.The downstairs bar is a place that I could loose an afternoon in. Dark, no windows big leather sofa in the middle of the floor...I'm pretty sure I could spend a day here."
"Wow. I think this place is one of the best places to go for nice and satisfying meal. The ribeye was just so tender and tasty. I am all about putting extra condiments, but I refused to put any because I wanted to taste the original flavor and texture of the meat. We ordered dozen oysters. Half from east coast other half from west coast. Both versions were fantastic! The fritz aka fries. Can I just say Bravo? I asked for ketchup as soon as the waiter brought the fries out, but didn't even touch that and used the house sauce. Even the bread that came with was satisfying. Loved the butter. We had champaign crush, original champaign cocktail and dirty martini with olives and cheese. The drinks weren't exceptional but good enough. Heard the dirty martini was great though. Lastly, we had chocolate creme pie and whiskey icecream. Totally worth trying and stretching your stomach. It was just perfect. Our server Brandon made our night even better. He is humorous, polite and fast!  My flight got delayed by a lot, so we got there at 10:50pm for late dinner, but the service was flawless. Thanks for the great food and fabulous service! Strongly recommend trying this place.Oh the price overall was $192 (except for desserts)"
"I absolutely hate not being able to give this restaurant 5 stars. The ambiance alone deserves 10 stars. It's romantic, dimly lit, classic and beautiful, it looks like something out of Boardwalk Empire. It is screaming Chicago. It is far away from the tourist zones. At the same time, the noise level is great and I could see this being an amazing date night spot. Service was spectacular and attentive. The homemade bread was delicious. And they even have a coat check. So WHY in the world can I not give it 5 stars?The steak I got (Ribeye Chicago Cut) was prepared very very rare, despite me asking for a medium rare. To top it off, the steak was full of muscle and was nearly impossible to chew. It was just such a disappointment and with a steak like that, I would have normally given a restaurant 2 stars. These guys just managed to compensate for it in every other department. The side of corn was spectacular also. To make it over here, you will have to verge a little from the tourist central areas and the treck is well worth it. Lots of locals here enjoying their Sunday night!"
This is a great restaurant. I've been here twice and both times were home runs. Vincent J says it best that everything is great. Do yourself a favor though and get a side of corn. Uhhhhmazing. I'll be back every time I am in Chicago.
"My husband and I ate here on our last night in Chicago.  What a perfect way to put the finishing touches on a great weekend!  We had 10:15 pm reservations (prime time reservations are tough to get, so plan early in advance.). Our table was not quite ready so we had a cocktail at the bar while we were waiting.  The bartenders are skilled and modern without trying to be one of those trendy mixologists. We were seated at a great booth in the center of the main dining room. Our server was attentive without being intrusive.  The manager was friendly when he came to uncork and decant our wine. We began with the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine.  I'm not typically a fan of pate' or terrines (the texture is just off putting to me), but I found myself continuing to grab bite after bite.  We shared the wedge salad (the thick cut bacon is phenomenal). For our entrees I had the shortrib stroganoff (superb) and my husband chose the Classic Ribeye.  I've had dozens of ribeyes in my life, and I can honestly say this was the most tender and flavorful that I've ever experienced.  My husband felt the same.  We shared the corn elote as a side because they don't have such things in our hometown.  I really liked the flavor but my husband was not as impressed.  We passed on dessert because we were both so full but the desserts passing our table looked beautiful and tasty.Like many others have said, the atmosphere is almost as good as the food.  We will definitely be recommending Bavette's to others."
Fantastic ambience and music. Invokes more of a speakeasy atmosphere paired with the leather couches of a traditional steakhouse.  The bone-in dry aged rib eye and the flat iron steak are must-haves! Gayot weren't kidding when they named it one of their top 10 steakhouses in the country for 2014!More about the speakeasy part - the cocktails are phenomenal especially the dark and stormy and the lily rosé. Another must-have is the elote corn side dish. Don't think twice. Just get it. You won't regret it. Cheers and bon appétit!
"Found this place last minute.  We could only get reservations before 6:30pm or after 9:30pm in the parlor (basement bar seating). The upstairs had a quiet decent atmosphere and seating was spread out.  It feels like the upstairs is more romantic than the downstairs.  The downstairs was more informal it had house with a mix of hip hop playing.  It wasn't load, you can still have a conversation and I enjoyed it.The service was spot on and our server made good recommendations.  I had the steak and it was cooked perfectly.  Medium rare is the way to go.  They had a good drink menu, and they had a good selection of Three Floyds  Craft Beer.I would definitely eat here again.  It's now one of my favorites."
"Oh... My... God!!! Seriously one of the top five, (if not top one or two), best steaks I've ever had in my life, and I'm from Kansas City!Service was impeccable, atmosphere was upscale but casual and the food flat out rocked! The pomme frites redefined potatoes for me and set a new high benchmark for the rest of my life. Even the salad was great and holy crap, wait until you try their home made ice creams!It may be a bit pricey, had a second of sticker shock when I read their menu, but after the event it was worth every penny."
"Bavette's was a stop on Day 2 of our long Chicago weekend.  BF and I had been looking forward to eating there based on all the great reviews and we were not disappointed.The atmosphere is classy and cozy, but we were seated along the wall in what felt like cafeteria-style seating.  Not the place to sit if you want a romantic dining experience.  If that's your goal, try to get a booth.We both ordered the stuffed crab avocado salad.  Oh.  My.  God.  So good!  That was a meal in itself.  Beautifully seasoned crab meat in a half avocado, accompanied by Bibb lettuce (I think) and a tasty citrus vinaigrette.For the entree, we both ordered the steak frites.  Again, absolutely delicious, especially with the Bearnaise sauce.  My mistake was ordering it medium well because the edges were drier than I liked, but that was my fault.  BF order his medium rare and couldn't stop raving about it.  I was too stuffed to make a dent in the fries, which were nicely seasoned, but BF ate all of his and some of mine.  The service was great until our waitress forgot about us.  We asked her twice for refills on our drinks, which never came.  BF went up to the bar to ask for refills and they were brought by someone else.  Otherwise, we had no complaints about the service.  Our water glasses were never empty and our food was served pretty quickly.My biggest complaint is the restroom situation.  There is one single-person restroom for each gender, so ladies, be prepared to wait in line.  There were five women waiting when I was there.  It seems like they'd be required to have more than one toilet per gender based on the number of people who actually fit in that restaurant.Overall, it was a very nice experience.  The food was awesome, so I can overlook some of the little annoyances."
Amazing decor. Amazing Food. Amazing Service. Amazing Cocktails. A must visit restaurant.
"A friend, my husband and I went to Bavette's for my husband's birthday dinner. It was THE BEST. The atmosphere and decor reminded me of an old Chicago style. It was cozy and inviting but be warned that if you eat downstairs it is very dimly lit. The food was outstanding and cooked perfectly. Here is what we had:Cocktail - Mint Julep was so awesome we had several rounds. Appetizer - Beef Tongue had fantastic flavors and was very tender. Entrees - Ribeye (16oz) was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth; Pork chop was very juicy and flavorful; Beef Stroganoff was superb. The short ribs were tender, a little sticky and sweet. They were a great compliment to the dish. Side - Creamed Spinach was very creamy and rich. Dessert - Peppermint Ice Cream packed a punch of peppermint with a very creamy ice cream. I'm not one for minty desserts and I was super full but I definitely had several bites of this. It was a wonderful experience and the staff was helpful, knowledgable and great! We would go back for sure."
"Great food, great service, and the hot towel at the end of the evening was a very nice touch."
"This is by far the best place I have been the past 5 years. It may be difficult to reserve a table which is why we went in and sat at the bar - but let me tell you THIS......The bar is where you get the best service. If Allen is working then prepare to get your mind blown because this guy is phenomenal. Every time I am in Chicago, you will find me here - and for good reason, too."
This is the best steakhouse in Chicago right now.  Their prime steaks are excellent and their shellfish is incredible.  I suggest getting your steak Diane style.
"this place is so good. SO GOOD.reservations are a bit hard to come by for this swanky smooth sexy spot in river north, so most of the time i have just waited for seats at the bar, which offers the full menu, and you're closer to the cocktails. totally the right move. there is a large selection of house cocktails but i usually get the negroni, and they do an amazing job here. i always get the foie gras terrine with cognac and blackberries. its so delicious. the bread they serve it with is perfect. just so rich and noms.  salads are great and big enough to share. wedge salad is amazing. but the steaks. the steaks are so good. they're not the same as mastro's, which i also love love loveeeee, since they serve their steaks with sauce, but omg, cooked perfectly every time.  i usually share the bone in dry aged ribeye, medium rare, and it comes perfect to you on a hot plate.im a creature of habit, so i havent tried many other things on the menu other than the above and some sides, but honestly, everytthingggg looks delicious and immediately makes you want to order when it walks  by you..."
"I've had steaks in many Chicago steakhouses (e.g. David Burke's, Tango Sur, Cut) and the filet at Bavette's was by far the best I've had.  Complement the dish with a side of their elote corn (a bit spicy if you can't handle the heat) and an Old Fashioned, and you'll be in heaven.  Conclude the feast with the golden brick dessert and you won't be disappointed."
"Tried this place with the hubs on a recent trip to Chicago. It was excellent from start to finish!! We shared:  peppered duck & goat cheese terrine (so good - that mustard goes well with it), wedge salad (with seriously the best thick-cut bacon I've ever had), side of wild mushrooms (very flavorful), and bone-in filet (cooked perfectly medium rare) with addition of a couple roasted bone marrow (rich and umami). Drinks were very good and service was impeccable! Small place and very dimly lit, which I didn't mind. I loved the ambiance, especially being with my husband. It's what I imagine old Chicago to be like. Would definitely come here again next time in Chi-town."
Drinks are on point. And the bacon. Omg the bacon.  It's like I died and went to heaven. The fried chicken was also delicious. I was drunk so I don't remember the service. Sorry.
"Well no need to go into details since everyone below already has already said the same.  But I will confirm that was the best steak I think I have ever had.  Seafood tower was very fresh, if you are in the mood, I would spend the extra $50 and get the Maude's tower.  I have had it at Maude's liqour kitchen and it's 3 tiers of amazing seafood.Back to the steak, Amazing, no need for the sauce they give you and no need for the mushrooms I ordered.  If you like bone marrow, get it on the side.Also make sure you get the creamed spinach and bacon side.  Amazballs!!!"
"I loved this place! We accidnetally arrived 30mins before our reservations. Instead of having us wait 30minutes, the hostress sat us right away. I greatly appreciate that! Considering how cold and hungry I was!  I went last year for my birthday dinner with my sister and friend. The drink was good and the atmosphere had this romantic silent movie feel to it. Does that even make sense? I hope so because I clearly didn't go there on a date! lolWe ordered the Prime Duchess medium raw (worth it!), short rib stroganoff (wasn't my favorite but my sister and friend wanted to order another plate) and medium raw 22oz ribeye (loved and worth it!)I can only really speak about the 22oz since that was my dish. I love steaks but I'm not much of a eater. I have to say, the steak was so good that I ate all of it that night in the restaurant. Did not take me long to finish it either. Definitely going back when a friend is willing to spend that much money on a steak like I would."
"I came to Bavette's Bar and Boeuf for a late dinner date on a Wednesday evening. Upon arrival we were seated at our reserved time, which made me happy because I hate waiting when I have a reservation. The interior of the restaurant is dark and woodsy; which gives it a cool atmosphere. However, the lack of lighting makes it pretty much impossible to do anything in this joint! I felt like I needed a 100 watt flashlight to see my date, read the menu, make my way to the bathroom and see what I was doing in the bathroom.Moving away from the lighting issues, lets focus on the food, which is amazing!- Oysters were fresh and briny the way I like them. - Baked Goat Cheese was so damn good! I found myself wanting to lick the dish it came in to ensure I got every last bit into my tummy.- Filet Mignon Petite Duchess Cut was cooked medium well like my date requested and it was good, but the piece I sampled didn't knock my socks off. Tasted like Filet Mignon, but nothing special.- Double Bone Berkshire Pork Chop was my entree and I give it two thumbs up. The meat was cooked to perfection and so juicy.I will definitely be going back to Bavette's and I highly recommend that if you (the person reading this review) decides to dine at here that you try the Baked Goat Cheese and Pork Chop."
"I've been here twice and each time LOVED it. I believe both times I started with their oysters and then moved on to a steak (of course). My medium rare filet has always been cooked perfectly, and the bread they bring with the meal is so fresh and delicious. But the real winner was the brussels sprouts. These are easily the best brussels sprouts I've EVER had.  I could eat them with every meal. Perfect texture and char, and dusted with Parmesan (I believe), these brussels sprouts had me dreaming of them for a week after I was last here. And I actually just dreamt of them last night which is the reason I'm writing this review... Service has always been great, just the right amount of attentiveness without being overbearing or smothering. They have a really good drink menu with craft brews and cocktails as well as a great wine list. I would recommend this place to anyone.  I love bringing out of town guests here, it's not your typical Gibsons or Chicago Cut, but it's just as good (if not better) and something different. Pricing of the food is definitely reasonable, not overpriced as some other chicago steakhouses, but it's definitely not cheap either.  Just know, this place is always a hit with my husband and I (as well as our guests), just like the rest of their places!"
"Wow....I'm going to go out on a bit of a whim here and say this is the best dining atmosphere in the city.Now, my review is based solely on desserts, coffee and some drinks, due to migrating here from Kinzie where we had my birthday dinner.First off, the place is not designed for big groups. It's a really intimate, dark setting where you bring the hottest girl you know for a romantic dinner to get waited on by sophisticated hipster-esque young people who know they have to live up to the name Bavette's has created for itself. The décor is reminiscent of a French speakeasy, so awesome!  We kind of walked in with a group of 16, half of which were over 50. Needless to say we got some strange looks and I could just see the fear in the staff's faces as we filed in and made our way to the basement (yes, there is a basement, go see it if you haven't).We kind of hung around the bar until 2 booths opened up and we squeezed our groups into them. We ordered some French press coffee, a raspberry cheesecake and chocolate pie, also a couple others I don't remember at the other table. Everything was just so succulently delicious. The coffee was probably some of the best I've ever had, cream and sugar would have polluted this nectar of the gods.I can only speak for the M Laurent cocktail which was fantastic. My family enjoyed their drinks as well.The staff, though probably annoyed with us, was very accommodating to our huge group, and as the night went on and the place cleared out a little bit, made it for a progressively better experience.I am coming back here for dinner as soon as I can pick up a date. The food I spotted at other tables had my mouth watering even having eaten a complete meal just shortly before."
"Came back a year later. Food is still amazing, we came to celebrate my boyfriends the birthday. Jameson and Pickleback shots are our new favorite. We had the lobster, clams, the Chicago cut (amazing), the beef stroganoff and wild mushrooms. While most of the staff was great we did have one rude server.  Thankfully this server was only there temporarily until a much better waiter named Julio was done with another table. Julio was kind, attentive and just overall a good guy that saved our birthday celebration."
"So incredibly delicious! The service was very professional and quick.  They treat it like an experience, which it definitely was! We arrived at about 530pm, and waited about 30 minutes for a table. We had drinks at the bar, and watching the bartenders work was amazing! We had the shortrib stroganoff, prime rib sandwich, frites, and the Mexican corn. No complaints here! They also have a nice cocktail and bar selection. We enjoyed the Bavette's punch and champagne splash."
"""This place is definitely you,"" said Dominic P. when we walked in.  My first impression was that Bavette's is sexy, so I'll take the compliment.The sexy decor consists of exposed brick walls, wood floors and tables, burgundy leather tufted sofas, all dimly lit with chandeliers and candles.  Jazz and instrumental piano music played, it reminded me a little bit of upscale restaurants in New Orleans.I made reservations about a month in advance for a Sunday at 5:30 p.m.  It was definitely tricky.  I wanted to make reservations about two weeks prior, but it was impossible!  Oh well, some celebratory dinners are worth waiting for.  If you want to dine at Bavette's, plan ahead.  When we arrived for our reservation, the restaurant had plenty of tables open - and it stayed that way until we left.  Walking in on a Sunday night is definitely a do-able option.Okay so I'll tell you what you really want to know:  the food at Bavette's is AMAZING.  That may be a trite descriptor, but trust me it's accurate.  I started with the Lillet Rose martini, made with St. Germain, vodka, and lillet rose.  It was light, fruity and refreshing - a positive start to the meal!We started with the baked goat cheese.  If you love cheese as much as I do, it's a must.  I've had similar dishes elsewhere, but I really enjoyed the bread that they served with it and the chunky tomatoes on top of the cheese.  The service is also wonderful at Bavette's - a waiter noticed we still had cheese, but no bread, so he brought us a basket of bread.The complimentary bread & butter is worth talking about - the slices of bread were thick, with a crunchy crust and soft, pillowy texture inside.  I could have eaten the bread & butter as a meal.I love a good steak as much as the next carnivore, but I can't eat much of it, so I ordered the 6 oz petite duchess filet.  It was the perfect portion for me and cooked medium-well to my liking.  I also ordered the bone marrow, which was good but not necessary.  Bavette's serves up a little tin of their special steak salt - you cannot miss this salt on your steak!Dominic P. had the classic ribeye, which was the best steak I've ever eaten.  It was a massive steak, I had a few bites, and he ended up taking a chunk home.  The Bearnaise sauce is the most creamy, butter, artery-clogging goodness ever.  You better believe I stole some of it for my own steak.  His steak was cooked medium-rare, which isn't my preference, but it was still out of this world!If Bavette's sold their steak salt and Bearnaise by the bottle, I'd stock my cabinets.We shared some sides:  the elote corn and the thick-cut bacon.  I'm a fan of shareable sides, and the elote corn could have fed four people.  I could not get enough of this one!  The thick-cut bacon is a bacon lover's dream.  It was so thick that it almost tasted like a slab of ham.  It was good stuff, but not my personal favorite.  I'm just not crazy about bacon.I'd do it all again in a heartbeat, but I'd skip the marrow and the bacon.We finished our meal with the whiskey ice cream.  DO IT.Don't be a whiny baby.  DO IT.  GET THE ICE CREAM.  The whiskey flavor was bold, but not overwhelming.  I don't like whiskey, but this ice cream is in it's own category of amazing.I loved our dinner at Bavette's.  We left with our bellies full of delicious food.  Bavette's won't be one of my ""go-to"" favorites because of the price point (almost $200 for us which included three cocktails, an appetizer, two entrees, two shared sides, and one dessert).  But it is a lovely place to celebrate anything or a rare treat.Next on my radar:  Gilt Bar next door."
"Mmmmm my mouth salivates every time I think of the bone-in rib eye from Bavette's. Too bad it only comes in a 24 oz portion so you'd have to either convince someone to share with you, take the leftovers home (which I don't like to do), or be a competitive eater with the capability of finishing the whole thing. Sometimes, I wish I had four stomachs like a cow so I can eat the many yummy things from the menu. Wait no, that would be cannibalism opps!!Luckily, I did convince someone to share with me and they were nice enough to cut the steak in half and put them on separate plates. We ordered the mixed green and apple salad which was enough for two to three people to share. It was light and was very yummy. I got the bone marrow as an add-on to the steak. It was flavorful but we would've been better off ordering the appetizer for $16 which comes with three pieces rather than adding one for $8. We finished off dinner with the whiskey ice cream and all smiles. Overall, it was really good and the service was excellent. I can't wait to come back.."
"WOW. Great service, great food.  Made reservations for 915 on a Tuesday, showed up about an hour early, got a drink at the bar, and promptly got seated early.  Ordered the ribeye, corn, and asparagus to share.  Everything came out SO quickly, almost suspiciously quick. The food was delicious and devoured. I would come back to Chicago just for the ribeye."
"Yup. All that it's cracked up to be. Very good steak place with great seafood and cocktails. Atmosphere is also good and squawk like an old 30s speak easy.  So fun in here as you are taken to a cool foreign place with beautiful decor.  Service is exceptional...from the time you wall in to the time you leave.  Door service, host, wait service, bar, all very good.  My experience started waiting at the bar.  i asked the bar keep for a bourbon drink - just so happens that he was from Kentucky and he ""made up"" a great drink for me.  Think of a mint julep but without the mint (best way i could describe it).  So good.  We then sat down and were immediately greeted by our service that we so helpful and patient (we had a lively party of 6).  Everything that he described and recommended came thru.  We started with a huge seafood tower (maude tower i think it was called) that had oysters (with East and West coast), lobster, shrimp, and crab legs.  So good and very easy to eat (lobster and crab legs were chopped in small pieces put inside their shells).  I then ordered the 20 dry aged rib eye - wow, a perfect medium rare.  Seared so nice with bits of char and so tender in the middle.  It was a lot of meat but would def order again.  We then shared an array of plates - roasted heirloom tomatoes, mexican fair corn, and seared broccoli.  I really loved the mexican corn but the surprise hit was the simply roasted heirloom tomatoes with herbs.  I could eat all day.Other in the table tried the port chops and pork fried chicken and there were no complaints (I tried the friend chicken and have to admit that it would not be my first choice).  Would love to come back again."
"On a particularly ambitious night, we decided to hit Bavette's Bar and Boeuf.  The higher end and sister restaurant to the equally popular Au Cheval, we figured that being able to make reservations (Au Cheval doesn't take reservations) would work in our favor.  Upon arriving, we were seated right away.  It's hard to not immediately like the old school atmosphere and dimly lit environment.  There's music playing in the background, a lively bar scene, and top-notch cocktails and food.  For young couples and hip singles, this is about as great as restaurants get in the City.  Alas, traveling with family, there are other concerns, thus the reason it was an ambitious night.  Bavette's doesn't have any accommodations for younger folk and high chairs or booster seats are simply not part of this cool scene.  Fortunately for us, we were seated at a spacious booth right across the bar, and I'm going to say the food and cocktail made it all worth it.  Service was friendly and efficient even if our dining companions raised a few eyebrows at adjacent tables.  Our selection (eaten very quickly):Dark & Stormy - $13.  Goslings black seal, ginger beer, lime.  Their signature cocktail and wonderfully refreshing to boot.  A bit pricey but these are artisinal cocktails.  Bavette's Punch - $13.  Flor de Cana, Maraschino, grapefruit.  Tart and sweet and with a nice punch at the end.  Cocktails may go down easy but they aren't weak on the alcohol.  Foie Gras Terrine - Coming from CA, we miss foie gras.  This was a nice appetizer, though I'll be honest that I love my foie gras warm and cooked.  Spread on toast and add a little blackberry compote and it's a wonderfully decadent and rich mix.  Roasted Bone Marrow - I love bone marrow.  It's an appetizer that's simple to mix but incredibly rich and never disappoints.  Bavette's is topped with a great parsley salad and served with an incredible red onion jam.  Loved this.Prime Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye - this was named as one of Chicago's best steaks and it's very good.  Cooked perfectly medium rare and served only with some steak salt and bernaise sauce for dipping, it's the classic preparation.  Really can't complain though I've had steaks that are even more tender.Buttery Mashed Potatoes - made with huge pieces of garlic and chicken jus.  Quite simply one of the best preparations of mashed potatoes I've had.Sugar Snap Peas - this is a side dish they're trying for the summer.  It's served cold and is a bit tart with the mix.  Very different and offers a change of flavor from the other dishes.Elote Style Corn - people seem to love this appetizer.  It's a take on creamed corn but with a definite kick of spice and tanginess from lime.  I thought it was ok.  I actually like traditional cream corn better.Thick Cut Bacon - you must get this.  Four pieces of thick cut bacon are covered with the perfect amount of maple and black pepper.  They're seared to perfection and are a combination of crisp and tender like pork belly.  Well worth the calories.  Overall, we had a great meal at Bavette's.  The drinks were fantastic and the food is great.  Add to that the classy atmosphere and it's clear why this place is so popular.  I think it's the perfect date spot.  Even with family in tow.  Chicago.  What a great food town.  Bavette's takes credit cards, including American Express."
"Although my boyfriend and I live in Grosse Pointe, we occasionally have the luxury of eating out in Chicago.  This is one of our faves.  It's gorgeous inside.  The steak is the only one that can rival Joe's.  A bit pricey but worth it."
"Damn, that was good.And when I say good, I mean friggin' great.  Took the gf here for our anniversary, and it did not disappoint.  First, the ambiance is great.  Not the standard, generic brass rails and tons of oak.  Great lighting, exposed brick, not too crowded, not too loud.  The service was exceptional.  Our server was very attentive, offered some good suggestions, the manager came by at one point to ask how everything was and at another point to fold my gf's napkin while she was away from the table.  Second, the drinks were very good.  Nice wine selection, some very enjoyable cocktail offerings, good pours.  (Bonus: They have my favorite vodka - Death's Door - and blue cheese-stuffed olives.)Third, and most importantly, the food was excellent.  We started with a wedge salad.  Cold, crisp lettuce with the perfect amount of creamy dressing (I would have preferred blue to ranch, but that's just preference and I knew what I was getting when I ordered) with a hint of dill and what the frig?  Two slices of thick cut bacon?  Best wedge salad ever.  For entrees we got the shortrib stroganoff and the bone-in dry aged ribeye.  The stroganoff was delicious.  Noodles cooked perfectly, the sauce accentuated the mushrooms and meat instead of covering them up, the meat was tender.  Really well done.  And the steak, while not the best I have ever had, was still excellent.  It was done perfectly to order.  Nice crust, juicy, tender meat, seasoned well.  I did not use the béarnaise, but I did use the seasoned salt blend that was provided, and that stuff is magic.  The asparagus and bacon sides were on par with the rest of the meal.  Oh crap, I almost forgot about the bread.  Best bread and butter I recall having at a restaurant in the city.  Obviously not the focal point of the meal, but my gf did comment after her first bite that, if the bread was any indication, we were in for a great meal.  It was and we were.  I think Bavette's just became my favorite steak place in the city and one of my favorite restaurants period.  For me, any area where it was a little short of somewhere else, it more than made up for it in some other aspect."
Honesty THE BEST steak I've ever had. The aged bone in rib eye is everything you've ever imagined a perfect steak to taste like. All the sides were amazing. The desserts sinful! Please do yourself a favor and try.
"I can't imagine getting a better steak. I had a dry aged and it was ridiculously delicious. The sauce they put with it was delicious but completely unnecessary. We also got the thick cut bacon, which was awesome, and pomme frites that were tasty. It was way too much food but all so good.Their wine list was great and for the quality of wine, the bottle price was not that bad. I definitely want to go back for the seafood. That stuff looked amazing as well."
"Great not your typical steakhouse experience. French cuisine, which I absolutely love! Love the sexy decor inside but can get a bit loud, great service. The food itself for the most part was good, the steaks definitely shine more. Started with salmon tartare, nothing to write home about served with creme freiche. Very light dish, the salmon shines but not much wow factor. The peppered duck and goat cheese terrine was another bland and boring dish. It was tasty but again boring. It was served with mango jam that definitely lit up the terrine. The crab cakes ($21) were fantastic. Unfortunately, it's just one big crab cake served with a dill type aioli super delicious and garlicky. Definitely a stand out from the appetizers. As for the meat, all of them were cooked perfectly, the way we wanted too but could have used a bit more seasoning. I ordered the 20oz dry aged prime rib eye ($60). Very tender and marbled piece of meat dry aged for 50 days. My dad ordered the lamb t bone ($38) which he absolutely enjoyed. All of the steaks are served with bernaise sauce, not my favorite here. My boyfriend ordered the regular rib eye with a side of bone marrow. It paired very well with the steak but again steak was under seasoned. As a side, we ordered the mashed potatoes ($10). We were able to share it between four people, no problem. I loooove potatoes.. Can't say these appealed to me much. Maybe they added too much cream but something was off. As for desert, the chocolate cream pie ($10) really hit the spot at the end of our meal. Truly delicious and actually light! Definitely check this place out if you want a different steakhouse experience. Great date spot as well. Downstairs there is a separate dining room, it's very cozy and much quieter than the upstairs. Great place for after dinner drinks. PS. Bring your own wine. As long as you share a glass of wine with a table next to you, the bottle you brought is free, no corkage fee."
"One of our favorite dining experiences yet. My parents were in town and wanted to have a nice dinner at a steakhouse. We did some research and decided to make a reservation at Bavette's. We were seated at a beautiful booth in the main dining room. The ambiance at Bavette's exceeded all my expectations - from perfect lighting, to cozy booths, to just the right amount of charm.Most importantly though was the customer service. My mother has many allergies and dietary restrictions & our waiter took very good care of her. We were very impressed with the gluten free options on the menu as well as how they catered to her other dietary restrictions.Finally, the menu was on point. Great selection of sides and entrees as well as desserts and cocktails. I would definitely recommend saving some room for a dessert."
"On our way to Gilt Bar tonight and was intercepted by Bavette's.  The desk ladies directed us to the bar downstairs where we were taken care of by the raddest girl I've met in a while, Riley.  She was a great mixologist, knew her stuff and kept us with a smile on our face the whole time.  I didn't get a chance to indulge in the food, but knowing Hogsalt, I'm sure it was on point.  As a bartender myself, I was impressed with everything, from atmosphere to service.  Definitely not let down.  Next time you're in River North, trying to sift through the many options to grab a drink or food, definitely give this place a shot.  It stands out among the saturated night life that is River North.  Ask which bar Riley is at, because thats the bar you want to be at :).  She makes a mean Sazerac. Ya'll rock, keep it real, keep it G.Deuce."
"This is my favorite restaurant in the city of Chicago. Pickle Back Shot...try it, its awesome.Seafood Tower!Amazing steaks!GREAT ATMOSPHERE!HIGHLY recommend."
"Bavette's is pure magic. We can never get a reservation here, so we decided to make one about two months in advance. I wish I'd gotten the chance to write this review sooner, it's been a couple of weeks, but I'll try to be detailed. We started with the mixed green and apple salad, which was very good, especially the candied pecans. The bread and butter were both unique and delicious. I got the bone-in filet, which was AMAZING. It was the best steak I have ever had--seriously. The seasoning, the temperature, everything was perfect. All of the sides we tried were wonderful. The broccoli wasn't boring like you would expect, it was the right crispness and seasoned well. The corn was luscious and delicious with a little bit of heat. The sweet potato was creamy and flavorful.We made sure to save some room for dessert (and take home some great leftovers) and ordered the chocolate cream pie. It was the perfect choice. The pie was creamy and decadent. It was like some heavenly version of an all chocolate oreo. The service was solid but not overwhelmingly good. The atmosphere was warm and dark with some fun jazz playing. We can't wait to go back."
"I had been wanting to come here for awhile now and Bavette's did not disappoint. If you've been to Maude's, Gilt, Au Cheval, etc then you can expect its sister Bavette's to meet the challenge.Reservations are tricky here, it's not a huge place but it's not teeny tiny either. I had a reservation for another week, but we walked over on a whim on Sunday just after 5pm.The atmosphere is really swanky, it's also quite dark so we're glad we weren't at a booth because we might fall asleep. We started with a seafood tower (it's bigger than you think!) full of oysters, king crab, salmon ceviche, and shrimp. Then we split the 22oz bone in dry rub ribeye which was absolutely delicious! We loved the seasoning and the sear. It was fantastic.There are salads and other seafood options for entrees etc for non-red meat eaters too.Our bartender/server was great too. We tried a few wines and cocktails from the menu. Bf braved a pickle juice Jameson's shot while I sipped on mint tea.All in all, we loved it here and will come back again!"
"I loved everything about this place! The dark, romantic ambiance, the food, the exquisite cocktails, the vintage touches. I had the steak frites and it was the best steak I have had in a while. Our waiter was quick on the service and very attentive without being overbearing. Will definitely return."
"I've been to almost all of the well-known steak houses in Chicago and this is one of my favorites. The ambiance and wait staff are always pleasant. To start, we had the salmon tartare and peppered duck & goat cheese terrine with apricot mustard on toast. Excellent. For my main course I chose the traditional filet mignon, which was cooked perfectly. Absolutely delicious. I had the fries with garlic aioli as a side, but all of the sides sounded good. I can't wait to go back and try the elote style corn."
"I've been here twice now and both meals have been fabulous.  The Main lobster is a knockout and a must order.  On my second visit we tried some new items that were incredible - lamb, beef stroganoff and creamed spinach.  The service is top notch from start to finish.  The setting can't be beat.  This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago right now.  Corkage policy is a kick - one bottle for free although the price is you need to give away a glass to another table."
Went for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  One word...GO.   Everything was top notch.   Really like the dark decor and low lights.  Kitchen is open air but you don't hear the cooks at all.   You feel like you are somewhere exclusive without the douchyness.Good beverage list.  Wines not terribly overpriced. Steaks were cooked perfectly and had amazing flavor.  Desserts were well made and really good service.  I plan on going back again in the near future.   At the top of my steakhouse list here in Chicago.
"The owners of Gilt Bar and Maude's Liquor Bar got it right again!They really know how to put together a great place here in Chicago.The atmosphere is cool, trendy, and a tad too dark (but I can overlook that)The food is what I came here for, and the food is why I left happy. It's sooo good, I've been back multiple times.We wound up splitting meals, because their steaks are pretty pricey but it worked out perfectly. I had and recommend all of the following:Apps/Sides- Crab Stuffed Avocado- Pommes Frites- Thick Cut Bacon- Creamed SpinachMain Courses- Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye- Buttermilk Fried Chicken- Shortrib StroganoffThis is a great place for a date, a business dinner, or if you're looking to treat yourself to a A+ meal!"
"Sexy, swanky, old-worldy, make-you-want-to-wear-pearls-and-gloves, yet not too pretentious kind of place. When you find a place like this, even crappy food seems better. That, however, is not the case here. The food is mouthwatering and delicious, and the service is impeccable. Waiting for our food, I ordered a gimlet on the rocks, and it was perfect in every way. None of the appetizers called our attention, so we got right down to it and ordered the classic bone-in ribeye (medium- and we shared of course) with garlic as the topping, and a side of pommes frites and the elote corn. Everything was phenomenal."
The short of it: we loved it!The long of it: we reviewed it in the style of film noir!hisandhersfoodblog.com
"I was torn whether to give this three or four stars (to the point that I've put off writing this review). Logic below.Ambiance: Nice! Jazzy music, low and sexy lighting and plush couches. A little too trendy for my taste because it attracts a really douchey clientele. Make reservations!Drinks: Hubs gives these top marks. Pricey though. Also weird corkage situation. But no complaints.Steak: ERMAHGURD. Without a doubt the most perfect and delicious steak I've ever had. THE TEXTURE, Y'ALL. Buttery, salty, perfect. Be prepared to drop serious coin on this ($40-$60 per steak). Steak is the saving grace of this place. The 22-oz I got was way too big, so next time hubs and I will probably split one. It was just massive (that's what she said).  Side dishes: We had the frites, elote and creamed spinach. The fries are delicious (the same you'll find at Au Cheval). You can tell they're fried in animal fat, and I'll pretty much eat anything that fits that description. The elote was pretty meh, but this is coming from someone who likes authentic elote, so maybe you'll think it's great. The spinach was not good. I think both of us only had a bite or two--not as creamy as you'd think.Dessert: Got the cheesecake and it was totally unmemorable. I don't think we finished it (mostly because we were insanely full) but also because it wasn't good enough to make ourselves sick over.Service: Our waitress took a long time to come by to take our drinks, but we overlooked it. When she arrived to take our order, we had already had plenty of time to look at the menu, so we said we were ready to order. I think she took offense to that because she really didn't come by to speak to us for the rest of our meal. Her assistant/runner/busboy was the main one checking in on us and taking our dessert and coffee orders. He was great. But if I'm gonna drop $40 on a tip, I want my server to at least pretend to be interested in me.TL;DR: Super expensive, steaks are great, don't get run over by a d-bag."
One of the best meals i have ever had. My group ordered every type of beef on the menu and one tried the pork. Everything was outstanding.  The bacon on the wedge salad and as an appetizer was completely over the top.My only issue was that the place is really dark. More than needed for ambience in myopinion.  It did not really bother me but 2 of my friends had headaches when we left. Thats a minor issue though - i cant wait to return!
"More than a year after my first review, and the place is still a stunner. My go-to item. the bone-in, dry-aged ribeye (medium rare) is still the best steak I can get anywhere. I absolutely love it. But I've been there twice just for the fried chicken and that is a winner, too, let me tell you! Everything they do is awesome: the fries, the corn, the broccoli, all the salads. I leave full and very satisfied, and continually impressed with the quality of the food and the high level of service."
"Came in Monday night to celebrate my husband's birthday and it was just us two. We had 7:45 p.m. reservations I made a couple of  weeks in advance. Good tips to know:-If you are celebrating something special, they can personalize your menus by putting something on top. I called in a week ahead and I had ours say: 'Happy Birthday, Faraz!' They were very sweet about it over the phone. I also pre-ordered dessert and they went over the choices over the phone. It was brought right after we were done with our entree portions. -EASILY SHAREABLE! My husband and I hardly ate all day and we split the Rib Eye and we couldn't finish it. We also split the baked potato. If you have questions about the menu, perfect! I am the type that usually knows what I want before I walk into fine dining restaurants but it was nice to gain knowledge about all the items on the menu from our waitress. She took time and was honest about certain pairings and dishes. -Forget the weekends- just come on a weeknight! Just as lively and busy as this is a popular steak restaurant and it'll just be easier to get reservations. Also, just come in for a huge sharable salad and order a delicious cocktail or a bottle of wine and relax. The comforting restaurant is featured with hints of vintage and a romantic ambiance. I love the cozyness style of elegance. As fine dining as it is, the waiters/waitresses are not in uniform and they are friendly and personable while holding a professional demeanor.-Service is PHENOMENAL. Our bus boy was very helpful. He brought extra lemons when requested, right away. New plates, silverware, waters, and he was tag teaming with the waitress explaining a few dishes. I haven't seen such great service like that too often. The reason why I give Bavette's a 4 instead of a 5 is that I like Chicago Cut for their steak more but I do strongly recommend Bavette's as well!"
"Ermagod this place is amazing. Dark, cute and intimate and perfect for a date! Or just catching up with friends! We ordered the baked goat cheese with marinara, which came with buttered toast that was delicious. The roast chicken was moist and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside, almost as crispy as the skin on a Peking duck on, which requires real skill! I had the short rib stroganoff, which had an amazing cream sauce, and the short rib basically melted in my mouth, it was so tender! I ordered a side of the Elote corn, of which I wasn't expecting the sour taste. It was interesting, but I would pass on it the next time around. Our waitress was attentive and sweet, helping us with the wine list. I would definitely come back to try other items. As a heads up, I made this reservation a month out to be seated at 5 on a Sunday."
"This place is awesome! Went with some friends to Chicago who had never been there and wanted to find a great steak place.  Everything we ordered was great, from the decor and music to the butter and bread to the chocolate mousse cake and everything in between. The waiter was a character, our table was well attended to. I am not a fan of oysters but my husband insisted I try one of the eastern ones that he ordered, which I must say was dillish. Yes, this is not an inexpensive place to dine, but well worth the experience we had."
"Very romantic and dark; would be so ideal for a cozy date!  I, however, was there for a work dinner.  We sat in the basement which almost seemed better because it was more a little less noisy.  We had the bone marrow and crab cake - both delicious, but you have to be in the mood for the marrow because that alone is a fatty, silky treat.  Petite filet and the best creamed spinach in town!  I'll be back - all the flavors with an atmosphere that beats the rest of the steak houses in town."
Came here at the recommendation of several colleagues. Best dining experiencing in Chicago thus far. The appetizers (especially the Wedge Salad) were unreal. The steaks were quite good but slightly overlooked at our table.I'd definitely come back here again.
"This place has raised the bar for Chicago dining. I came for dinner with my peep on a Saturday night and everything about our experience was perfect, from the moment we scored two comfie seats at the bar, to the second we walked out the door. Plus we could actually hear each other in the restaurant, which is becoming ever more rare these days. Service was fast and super friendly and the food from start to finish was delicious. We began with shrimp cocktail and complimentary sourdough bread. The bread was still warm and was served with tasty salted butter. We finished it all and were offered seconds, which was nice, even though we deferred. For entrees I went with the apple and pecan salad with aged parm and a side of the Elote Style Corn which was amazing and different from anything I had ever tasted. It was creamed with cheddar cheese and cilantro, and a hint of lime. The lime really added a kick. Both my friend and I loved it. The other standouts of the meal were my friend's filet and cream bernaise. The asparagus were largely ignored. We went with a few classic cocktails and those hit the spot as well. My only regret is that we did not order the whiskey ice cream. Next time!"
"We stumbled across this gem after watching the Book of Mormon. Inside the nice ambience, we were seated and served by John (bald guy with glasses and tattoos). The food was great, the drinks were great and the dessert was exceptional! Thanks to John for not sugar coating anything, just telling us what meals really stood out, and saving us any letdowns. We appreciated his blunt demeanor.The perfect dinner to a perfect evening. Bavette's was fantastic.-- a couple from Los Angeles""Fuck the cheesecake"" ;D"
"Loved this.  From the moment we stepped in the door to the moment we left, I loved my experience here.  Great jazz and big band playing (not too loudly) in the background, heavy wood interior, just an overall clubby feeling that immediately makes you feel like you belong.   We arrived a little early for our reservation.  They have a nice little seating area with couches where you can wait and we were served a drink. - good wine and excellent cocktail selections to choose from.Dinner was amazing.  We started by splitting a wedge salad (which was too much even for two) and each had a filet.  The filets were perfect.  They offer steakhouse-style sides designed to be split and we ordered the corn.  I would highly recommend it -  creamy yet with a bit of a spicy kick.  Sadly, we had no room for dessert.Would I return here when we next visit Chicago?  Absolutely.  In a city filled with great restaurants, this one is special enough for a repeat visit.  It absolutely buzzes."
"I finally found the best steakhouse in Chicago. There are a number of places (Gibson's, Chicago Cut, even Hub 51 has a great fiilet) where you can get a great steak. I've never been to a restaurant like this where everything from the food (main courses/sides), drinks, service, and atmosphere was all 5-star worthy. Sodikoff, as I've said in previous reviews, is a genius. Each of his Chicago restaurants are consistently outstanding, which is why I constantly find myself recommending them to everyone I know. It's truly a testament to him that he's found a way to grow his empire to this extent without copying the same concepts over and over again."
"I really enjoyed most of what I ate at Bavettes.  I started with the duck and goat cheese terrine and it was outstanding. I'm not one that is heavy-handed with sauces, but the ones here are not to be missed. This appetizer comes with an apricot mustard that adds a whole different level of complexity to the dish.  I also had the steak frites and the bearnaise was wonderful.  The steak itself was not my favorite (I think it could have been better seasoned) but the meal on the whole was still successful.  The elote style corn was another winner: seriously what is in those sauces?!?  I didn't leave room for dessert, but I sampled some of the whiskey ice cream and it had a very interesting taste.  I'd come back to try some of the non-steak options."
Very solid steakhouse with some of the most amazing sourdough bread I've had in my life!  The atmosphere is very cool with a jovial crowd and very sleek decorations.  You really feel like you're at an old speakeasy.A great place for steak and drinks!
"Great decor, unbeatable atmosphere, and the most amazing food. The steak frites were to die for!"
"The full experience of Bavette's is fantastic. Just walking in the door takes you back into another era. The menu is simple, yet very well executed. The salmon tartar with crème fraîche is a perfect start for a great meal. The cocktails are very well made and the bar tenders friendly. The wine list is small, but has some phenomenal options. I highly recommend making an evening out of your time at Bavette's."
"This restaurant has brought me out of my review hiatus. After eating at Bavette's, I want to take all the five star reviews I have ever left, and make them all fours. This is quite honestly the best meal I have had in Chicago.The ambiance speaks for itself; incredibly classy.The food:-Oysters were incredibly fresh and amazing. They were served with the typical condiments, and the cocktail sauce was out of this world.-The beef was the real showstopper. I have had a lot of steak in my life. The filet at Bavette's was the absolute best I've ever had. The meat was so tender, I have no idea how they achieve that. And the outer part of the filet had the most amazing texture to accompany the tender interior meat. It was honestly a life changing experience...get the beef!-The sides were definitely five star worthy, but really didn't hold a candle to the steak. We had the mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach. Both very enjoyable.-One important thing to note: the steak is amazing by itself, but do not neglect to use both the steak salt and the sauce. Both of those options enhance the flavor of the steak...amazing!This place is amazing for a high-quality, delectable steak.They have a lot of other great things on the menu, that I probably will never get to try because the steak is that good!"
"This is my second time eating here in about two years. This is also my last (which I said two ears ago). In summary, this restaurant is overrated with subpar food, annoying music and a pretentious staff. The stroganoff that I had two years ago lacked meat and flavor. The wedge I had tonight bears pretty much the same description. The shrimp appetizer which costs a whopping $18.00 was nothing to write home about either. The Texas Toast it came with needed butter to make it palatable (otherwise it was just burnt bread with parsley on top). The only decent item was the butternut squash, but not worth the price and not anything you can't make at home or enjoy elsewhere. The staff...not inviting and totally full of themselves. Don't bother wasting your money here. If you are ever in the neighborhood, visit the Donut Vault and have a donut and coffee because all they had at Bavette's was sorbet and ice cream. That's not French."
"Bavette's is my new favorite place to go when I'm looking for steak!  The Rib Eye is so delicious, and if you order enough appetizers, is big enough to split two ways (I don't like eating huge hunks of meat).  The oysters are amazing.  The ambiance is quaint and romantic unlike many other Chicago steakhouses.  Service is attentive without being overbearing or rushing. I only wish it were easier to get weekend reservations."
"Why hello there, new-favorite steakhouse in Chicago. Disclaimer: I am not a huge fan of steak, and I usually find traditional steakhouses to be, *yawn*, dull places with unremarkable food that attract old men in suits. BUT... Bavette's won me over with its  mouth-watering food and totally sexy, retro-chic decor, completely shattering my steakhouse bias. The service was impeccable, and the food/drink was phenomenal from start to finish. Some standouts were: the dark'n'stormy // the insanely soft, perrrrrrfect bread // the short rib stronganoff // the creamed spinach with blue cheese & caramelized onions // the prime, dry-aged ribeye. Good grief, I don't like chocolate cake, and that was fabulous too."
"Awesome option for reasonably priced French food downtown. Came back here a year later because I enjoyed it so much last time. Both times, I sort of did it on the cheap. They have a lot of seafood and steak options, none of which I tried. I loved the French influence of the less expensive dishes though. The foie gras appetizer was great. The roasted chicken was fantastic and reasonably priced - highly recommended. It's hard to make chicken really great... The beef stroganoff was very good as well. If the noodles weren't house-made, they fooled me. Excellent steak included with the stroganoff as well.Tried bone marrow for the first time here. I'm sure it's a good version, but I gotta admit, I don't get it. It's just fat! I knew that before I ordered it, and don't know what I was expecting, but...yeah, you just scoop fat onto bread with jam. It tasted ok, but so would anything that well-marbled."
What can I say. Went for my anniversary and it's another Bullseye!!  We had our usual a and added the new additions to the menu. Geoffrei is now moved up and his service is still excellent. The food is worth the dollar and the service is just an added bonus.
"Ate there last night. Food was some of the best I have ever had. Atmosphere old school, dark and candle lit. Service by Michelle was outstanding. Been eating in Chicago for over 30 years and this is one of the best."
This is one of the places that screams for a 5 star! Absolutely gorgeous atmosphere with exceptional service to match the ambiance! Food was fresh and delicious. I'd give my steak and frites 4/5 just bc I've had better but it was still up there! I couldn't be happier with this place and cannot wait to go back there again. Definately a place that impresses!
"I've been trying to get to Bavette's for over a year now, but reservations fill up fast! I finally thought a month ahead in honor of my husband's birthday and booked us a table in the downstairs parlor.Neither my husband nor I are big steak eaters and there's a lot of steak on the menu. So much steak that I wondered if I picked the right spot for his bday dinner. However, where there's good steak there's often good seafood...and Bavette's is no exception.We started with the seafood grand tower. Crab, oysters, shrimp cocktail and other seafood galore!  At $125 I thought it was pretty pricey, but it also turned out to be very delicious and I'd order it again next time. We also ordered the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine at the suggestion of our waitress and many yelpers. We're not sure what all the hype is because we thought it was disgusting and basically just ate all the  yummy homemade bread served with it.Since we indulged with apps and the steaks didn't really appeal to us we opted for salads as our entrees. More crab in the crab stuffed avocado (yum!) for me. And my husband raved about his waldorf style salad.Their cocktail menu is also quite impressive. A few dark & stormy cocktails for the bday boy and I loved my lillet rose martini. I followed up the martini with a lovely glass of white wine that unfortunately ended up all over my coat thanks to the busboy refilling my glass. It was a complete accident, but the manager still went out of his way to help me clean off my jacket and insisted that we send him our dry cleaning bill. And he even sent an extra dessert for the birthday boy. So we ended up ""celebrating"" with whiskey ice cream sundae and an extremely rich and chocolately surprise. It was so good that I didn't even think to ask for the name.The atmosphere reminds me of their sister restaurants, Gilt Bar and Maude's specifically. They all make great date spots and are always fun for special occasions if you remember to make a reservation ahead of time!"
"I can't believe it took me so long to finally go here. I loved everything from the ambiance to the food. It's a very speakeasy type of environment especially the downstairs. Super cozy and intimate. The old fashioned was incredible. The bone in filet was like butter, cooked to medium rare at perfection and I think just won best steak in Chicago on my list. To end your meal, get the chocolate cream cake, just do."
"AMAZING.Let's start with the standout item. It's the steak. I got the bone in dry aged ribeye: a 22oz steak, absolutely massive, topped with sauce bearnaise. I opted to have it rare. It was incredible. Utterly divine. Perfectly prepared, superbly tender, an explosion of flavor that blew me away on every bite.To put this into context: I've been to many steakhouses and restaurants in general. Before this meal, I didn't even feel very strongly about steak. I left Bavette's not only having a new favorite restaurant in Chicago, as well as a new favorite main dish. The thing that really makes this experience stand out to me is the fact that I had a pretty serious cold at the time. I expected to taste nothing. The fact that I still perceived the steak as so delightfully flavorful affirms that it really must have been excellent: if I had been there without a cold, chances are it would've been even better. I certainly intend to go again.We also had some other items. These dishes had more subtle flavors, which were partially lost on me because my cold muted the flavors. Anyway: from the Hors d'Oeuvres, we got the Fois Gras. The combination with blackberry was quite interesting. From the sides, we got the pommes frites and the wild mushrooms. The pommes frites with the garlic (truffle?) aioli are one of my favorite Chicago staples. The wild mushrooms came in a surprising variety. We also had the crab-stuffed avocado, which was, like all the other dishes, very good. We finished the dinner up with a small dessert and shots of Chartreuse with the waiter. All-in-all, it was a faultless evening. The classic, intimate atmosphere only further elevates Bavette's: it is superb."
"Going there with very high expectation, but the experience was a little bit underwhelming - food quality was mixed, so was the service. Let's start with the steak. The classic filet and ribeye were both very favorable. There was no need to dip the meat into any of the sauces provided. They were definitely top notch, better than your Fleming, Ruth Chris or Strip House. Let's talk about the seafood. We ordered the lobster and oysters from both coasts (Prince Edward Island and Washington state). The lobster was served cold. Contrary to some reviews, the lobster was only mediocre. There wasn't too much flavor to it. Its blandness was only saved by the melted butter. The oysters were quite a disaster. They were small and without much meat. They were also disappointing from a taste standpoint. I generally love eating oysters, but not these ones. The overall service was good except towards the end. Plates and utensils were switched out after every course. That was good. But we did not have much interaction with the waiter.The experience for me turned downhill when we paid our bill. The waiter brought us the bill and I left my credit card on the table for him to pick up. But when he came back with the swiped card and receipt for signature, he put it in front of my friend who is white although it was me, an Asian, who put in the credit card. In diversity training, we call this kind of action a manifestation of ""micro-aggression,"" i.e. actions which subtly and sub-consciously diminished the value of minorities. I was extremely disappointed. I would encourage the manager to better train its staff on how to serve its customers."
"If Au Cheval has too long of a wait, but you're still craving their burger, head to Bavette's. Their Griddled Burger is the Au Cheval's burger. Don't forget to add the egg and the bacon. It's a pretty pricy burger, but a definite must try."
"There were some spectacular highs and one low in this experience, but overall I'd say this has been a dining experience to remember.I loved the atmosphere from the moment we walked in, for such a dimly lit space it sparkles.  For me it evokes the 20's lavish extravagance. The only disappointment was that there was no live music to bring up the energy.  We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation and found a seat at the bar, I was happy to note a bowl of recently peeled citrus fruits, always a sign of a great drink.  We waited approximately 20 minutes before my boyfriend complained about them ""not honouring our reservation"", which I thought was a bit ridiculous but appreciated anyway since the restaurant team found us a seat right away, one of the best seats in the house that are usually reserved for parties of 4-6.  I drank 2 fantastic martinis before ordering our food, then came the bread, omg the bread.  On it's own the bread is warm, fresh, crusty and delicious, but paired with salted buttermilk butter was out of this world.  First time I've ever had it and I'm trying to figure out how to make some for myself.  We weren't too hungry so skipped the appetizers and went right to our mains.  He ordered the pork chop and I ordered the duchess cut filet, accompanied by roasted tomatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  Both cuts of meat were cooked perfectly, however the pork came with a rub that my boyfriend hadn't noticed until after he'd eaten most of the chop, and once I'd pointed it out we agreed it was almost as good as the filet, which was probably the best steak either us have ever had.  Absolutely perfect, and was well paired with the mushrooms.  I didn't really care for the tomatoes, however, they didn't really add anything even though an acid was needed.  For dessert I ordered the raspberry glazed cheesecake.  Horrible.  Absolutely the worst cheesecake I've had in my entire life, completely bland with a grainy texture.  They allowed me to take the lemon meringue pie in stead, which was decent but didn't really jump out at me since it didn't have a very strong lemony tartness that I love.  I'm sure for others it would be perfect, the meringue was lovely, but I don't remember the crust which means it probably wasn't the best pastry I've ever had.  In any case, the service was excellent and they removed both desserts from the bill.  I'd say they pretty much bent over backwards to make sure we left happy, and that to me makes up for a slightly less than perfect dining experience.  All in all I'd be very happy to return if ever I'm in Chicago again.  Thanks for a perfect steak and superlative service Bavette's!"
"Oh. My. God. This is probably the best steak, wine and service I have ever had in Chicago. My husband and I went for our wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. From the moment you walk in, it is like a beautiful throw back to 1920s Paris. It's completely adorable and oh so romantic. Our server was not only super helpful in our selections, but very courteous as well. We had the shrimp cocktail and crab cake. All I can say is, if you come to Bavette's, GET THE CRAB CAKE. The best I've ever had. I had the Duchess Filet and my husband the Rib Eye. We ordered mashed potatoes and the elote. Both spectacular. No dessert for us, but 2 bottles of wine did the trick. I can't wait to go back. Bavette's is officially one of my top 5 restaurants in Chicago! XOXO"
...& this is why I love this place..good music...great drinks..and darkness. The ambience is love
"My wife and I had a fantastic dinner the night before the packaging show here in Chicago.  I searched for a romantic place and something a little different from the typical upscale steakhouses.  The setting was beautiful. Dimly lit with gorgeous fixtures, exposed brick walls, a huge bar, lots of different types of seating and great music.  Our friends joined us and we were sat at a small round table in the center of the place.  I wish it was a larger more comfortable booth but we enjoyed the setting.Their menu definitely has a French twist but still keeps the steak and seafood as the main course specialties.  Cocktail choices were extensive as was the wine list.  The favorite was the Lilet Rose Martini.  Not overly sweet but flavorful and quite unique.We shared a crab cake, a Caesar salad with smoked fish (a great alternative to sardines) and a fois gras.  Everything was delicious. We all had either the ribeye or the filet.  As perfectly prepared as you can find anywhere.  Simply delicious.  Sides included a blue cheese topped creamed spinach and butternut squash.  Good sized portions so no one left hungry.  Dessert was a berry topped cheesecake and a scoop of peppermint ice cream with hot fudge.  Very highly recommended for a couple or a group.  Make your reservations as this place gets sold out every night."
"I have to say this is the best place - HANDS DOWN - I've ever been too. Some colegues and I are out here for business and wanted to grab some dinner.So glad I came to Chicago. The music is great, the food is outstanding and the service is SUPERB!!!!! You cannot go wrong coming to this place. Ask for Sarah - Best Waitress Ever!!!! And so were the guys helping out. The staff is super nice from when you walk, seated, and walk out. You can't help but leave a huge tip for these folks. If you want superb service all the way around - this place is the spot.Again....WE LOVE YOU SARAH!!!! YOU ROCK!!!!!!"
"Love it, trendy, cozy, dress code is casual to ""night out"", a great place to relax and enjoy a great dinner.Garlic shrimp were a surprise hit. The rib eye was impeccably cooked. The mushrooms were a miss for me but I enjoyed the elotes"
"Great place. Lovely staff. Delicious food.Still a solid 4, maybe even a notch higher -- 4.25 or 4.4 :)Went there last Sunday. Loved the hostess, Chris.Went back tonight (Sunday) again -- this time with my family. Great service by Eric.We tend to order too much ...everything was delicious...The service felt relaxed and un-rushed but tonight saw a lady walking around and checking on people /tables to see how soon they were ready to finish and get out....that was a bit too visible and frankly not good for a restaurant that is a bit pricey.During the week (now y'all think i'm a pig) i went to Gene & Georgetti to see which i like more....i like them both. They are different and different feelings.Anyways, i love Bavette and will go back."
"Best filet I've ever had...with the best wine policy for a steak house. You can bring a bottle of your own wine, with no corkage fee...the only thing you have to do is give a glass of your wine to someone random in the restaurant. I just love that! Having our own bottle of wine saved us so much money on our final bill.From the moment you step into Bavette's you feel as if you've gone back in time to a classy, cozy, 1950's Chicago restaurant. It's the kind of place that is mostly for special occasions, with the random regular man at the bar that eats dinner there daily. We went to Bavette's for our anniversary, coming an hour early to enjoy a nice cocktail at the bar before our reservation.My husband ordered the Bone Marrow (to start....) and I had a wedge salad. The wedge salad was incredible, but definitely for two people versus one. The bone marrow seemed super rich. I suggested my husband do an $8 bone marrow add on to his entree instead of an entire bone marrow appetizer to himself for $16 but he went with his preference over mine on that one. Looking back, I think he probably would have said that the $8 add on would have been a better way to go since we could both barely make it up the stairs when we got home.I got the 10 oz filet mignon (which was absolutely INCREDIBLE) and we got roasted tomatoes and creamed spinach to share. I would definitely recommend the creamed spinach but the roasted tomatoes I could have done without. Overall, we probably got way too much food....but it was all incredible. I was trying to decide if I was going to get the 6 oz petit filet or the 10 oz that I ended up with. With an appetizer as large as the wedge, I wish I would have gone for the 6 oz filet.Bavette's was an amazing experience and a great way to celebrate our anniversary. Would definitely go back there for a special occasion or even a nice dinner out...definitely bring your own bottle of wine!"
"Get the steak. I say this because we were swayed by all these phenomenal reviews of non-steak things, and were honestly disappointed. The baked goat cheese was fine, but overpriced for what was basically marinara and Texas toast. The bacon had great flavor but bordered on undercooked for me. The prime rib sandwich was a bit bland and a little disappointing. The chocolate cream pie had a divine crust and delicious whipped cream, but the middle layer was a bit out of place.Honestly, the pie and the Chicago cut steak (which was absolutely amazing) were the only things worth returning for."
I really wish I could give it more  stars. My favorite steakhouse anywhere. It begins with the speakeasy vibe when you walk in and continues with the 1920's style music... Finally the food is as good as it gets. I had the bone in ribeye and it was outstanding. All the sides were amazing as well. Love this place !
"Loved everything about this place--decor, food, music. Was tipped about this place on Chowhound. Unfortunately, this place books up weeks in advance, so I was fortunate to go on a Monday night and grab 2 seats at the bar on the main level as you walk in. Full menu service available at the bar (though I would love a nice comfy booth with red tufted leather on my next visit).The warm bread and butter to start off the dinner was quite good as was the list of craft cocktails and craft beer. For a  starter, I shared the lettuce with the thick slices of bacon (excellent). My friend ordered the ribeye, which he said was as good as Chicago Cut. I ordered the chicken (not fried), which was moist on the inside and had nice, crispy skin on the outside--excellent dish. For a side, we chose the elote style corn which was out of this world.Owners of this place also own a couple of other nearby establishments--Gilt, which like Bavette's, has a 1920's /Capone speakeasy vibe, and Donut Vault. Highly recommend and conveniently located behind the Merchandise Mart on Kinzie and real close to the Wells Street bridge,"
"Fantastic find on trip advisor while on a business trip.  Luckily they were able to accommodate us and we had a fantastic meal in the downstairs room.  Great buzz, food options were great, only knock would be that there was a limited Wine List.  Definitely book a reservation"
"Best steak I've eaten in my entire life -- EVER! And I have been to some of the nicest steakhouses across the U.S.  The aged steak is a must get and the flavor addition they give you on the side is perfect. We always order the side of Thick Cut Bacon as an appetizer, I just wish there was more for the price though. 4 slices for $12."
"We celebrated my husband's birthday here and had a great time.  The three of us shared Foie gras, crab stuffed avocado salad, roasted bone marrow, 22 oz bone-in ribeye, grilled broccoli and bacon.  All the food we ordered was delicious.  There is no need for me to comment on each item.  Excellent service."
"Went here last night for the first time with the mister and I. We started off with drinks and even those were impressive. He had a gimlet  and it was soooo good. Simple and delicious. We ordered bone marrow, crab stuffed avocado, Chicago ribeye, and steak frites. Literally perfection. Medium rare just like I ordered. And I'm not even really into steak. Bf said it was the best rib eye he's ever had. Service was attentive and very nice. Not going to lie, my girliness got to me, and the decorations totally won me over. Vintage and unique. Even the plates were cute."
"So glad we were able to try this place, it's def the highlight of my weekend so far.We couldn't get reservations because they were full...but we decided to come earlier and wait for a table at the bar. We got lucky as our names were first and only waited 30 min. They were quoting us an hour earlier :)Had a couple if drinks at the bar - Bavette's Punch and the Lillet Rose Martini. Both were good but not the best drinks I've had in my life.The ambiance was romantic, the room is VERY dark with extremely low lighting so be careful! The servers and bartenders were all dressed like they were from the 1940s and there was a Casablanca feel about the place - music included. What we tried: west coast oysters (Kusshi & Coromandel), roasted bone marrow, foie gras, t bone lamb chop, steak frittes, classic ribeye, cantaloupe sorbet. The oysters were good, crisp and fresh. If you like Kumamotos, of course you'll like these. The bone marrow was AMAZING and was a big hit with everyone! The foie gras was good but not the consistency my husband likes. The t-bone lamb chop was GOOD and cooked to perfection!!! Melt in your mouth good!! And the steak frittes + ribeye were equally as tasteful. You can't go wrong with anything you order here because EVERYTHING was good, like really good!! I'm salivating now....."
"The best filet mignon in Chicago and favorite all-around restaurant in the city. Been here three times and will go many more. Can you give a place six stars? *The quality of everything - appetizers, entrees, steak and dessert - is extraordinary. Every single thing I've tried tastes delicious and even the non-steak items, like roasted bone marrow, are winners. Bring your friends here. Bring your family here. Wow them with the pinnacle of Chicago restaurant excellence."
"Carnivore Candyland.As often as I scour Yelp and read up on Chicago's restaurant scene, I'd never heard anyone mention Bavette's.  Thankfully, my girlfriend's brother is plugged in to the secret food scene.Bavette's is fancy.  You've gotta dress up a bit.  Especially if you're seated on the main floor.  It looks like a Parisian parlor with fancy upholstered furniture.  The kind of furniture Madea probably keeps covered in plastic.  (I assume.  I've never seen a Tyler Perry movie.)We were seated downstairs, where the vibe is decidedly more chill.  If you have the option, I think it's better to sit down there.  It's really dark and romantic-like.  Upstairs is busier and louder.You're started with amazing bread and warm butter.  Incredible.My table ordered the pomme frites ($7 with garlic aioli), the thick cut bacon ($9 for 4 very thick strips) and the elote corn ($7 and drenched in chili lime sauce).The frites were my favorite side.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The bacon got very cold very quickly, and I would have preferred it to have been crispier.  I thought the corn was too ""busy"" tasting, but my girlfriend rolled her eyes in delight at it.  It's the kind of thing I wish I could sprinkle inside a taco.  It needed some meat or something to knock the Kool-Aid factor down a few notches.Our meat shaman who recommended the place ordered a 24 oz. prime bone-in dry aged ribeye, medium rare.  I followed suit.  This bad boy will set you back $60.  Sixty freakin' dollars!I'm generally not a fan of ribeye, since it's such a fatty cut.  And indeed, there was plenty of fat here.  But the meat seemed to be from some kind of super-cow.  Possibly extra-terrestrial.  I've eaten cow before, and this was a more evolved creature.  The steak had a perfect salty crust on the outside, and the meat felt like a warm prodigal extension of my body that was coming home.  I wish I would have chewed slower.  That was incredible.  ($60 incredible?  Probably not.  But really damn good.)Service was generally good, though our waiter (Erik) was really chatty.  My girlfriend thought he was great, but I prefer the kind of waiter who keeps it short and to the point.Bavette's is definitely a splurge-type restaurant.  If you have a special occasion and feel like getting dressed up and spending a small fortune, it's an excellent choice.  I'd love to come back, but I'll need to cash out my 401K to afford it."
"On my first night, on my first visit to Chicago I was treated to this special restaurant.  I experienced outstanding service and delicious menu options.  Loved the fact you could bring your own bottle of wine with no corkage fee, only proviso is that you must share one glass with someone of your choice, or theirs, in the restaurant.  What a lovely ""pay it forward"" policy."
Went here looking for a great meal for our last night in Chicago.  The atmosphere reminded of a trendy restaurant you might find in NYC.  We got a great table in the lower room and really enjoyed ourselves.Everyone ordered a steak and the food absolutely exceeded our expectations!!!
"This place has it all! I've recommended every guest and friend to Bavette's and they've all enjoyed the food, drinks, and ambiance (at least that's what I've been told).  I don't eat steak often, but have been to many of the top rated steakhouses in Chicago, compared with Kinzie Chop House, David Burke's, Fulton's on the River, and Gibsons, Bavette's has the most flavorful and tenderest meat there is. Ordered the Prime bone in Ribeye, which was cooked to perfection; you can taste the fresh meat and spice in every bite. The salt seasoning that came with it on the side was heaven. It really put the masterpiece together. The sides were scrumptious, especially the chili, lime corn and buttery mashed potatoes, YUM! Service was very friendly and professional. I really enjoy the intimate and cozy feel of the speakeasy downstairs where you can wine and dine. Great date spot or catching up with a small group of friends. I'm a whiskey/scotch girl, and I always get the Old Overholt Old Fashioned ( 3 different kinds) and the whiskey Sour, cuz trying to pick one of the tasty yet strong drinks is just too difficult.Warning: like all the highly raved Chicago restaurants, it takess forrrrrrrrever to get a reservation. This place is reasonable though for Chi-town. Just book 3-4 weeks in advance and you'll get that 7pm spot on the wkend."
"This was my first time there. You walk in and it is very dark but once your eyes get adjusted, it has a very cool, old-time feel with lots of booths and a large old-fashioned bar. We started with the baked goat cheese app and the wedge salad- both were incredible!!! I had the salmon for my entree which was very good. We also ordered the elote corn as a side- it looks a bit like Mac and cheese but boy it was delicious!!! I left the restaurant very full and happy!"
"I went to Bavette's last year for my birthday and loved it so much I had to come back this year. Don't get me wrong, Bavette's serves a great steak, but I think the real charm here is the ambiance, which is somewhere between speakeasy and your grandmother's living room. It's comfy and chic at the same time. One thing that truly speaks to the atmosphere they are going for here is the BYOB policy. They apparently have BYOB every night (my boyfriend and I brought a bottle on a Monday), but instead of a tradition corkage fee they have something a little different - you must give one glass of your wine to another table, either of your choosing or the waiter's choosing. It's fun, and you can bring your favorite wine without the cost usually associated with buying a bottle at the restaurant.My ribeye steak, which was ordered medium rare, was a little too rare in places, but delicious none the less. The sides are nothing to write home about, but good. We had the shrimp de jonghe for an appetizer, and the shrimp were delicious. It also came with Texas toast which I could make a whole meal out of. Service was fantastic, although we had to ask for bread a few times before getting it.So yes, I am a fan, and will likely come back again for my birthday next year!"
"I really wanted to give it a 5 but a 40 minute wait after your reservation time is too ridiculous to let slide. The manager told me the patrons had paid but weren't getting up. She brought us over champagne and 2 apps on the house. Not a bad way to make up for it. Now on to the food, the shrimp app was great, goat cheese was meh. For my entrée I got the NY Strip and bone marrow on the side. The NY strip was the best I've had in Chicago (I've had one at pretty much every reputable steakhouse here). The tenderness and flavor were incomparable. My gf got the ribeye and it had a really unique, almost lamb like, flavor. Then there was the CORN! You know that scene in step-brothers were Dale describes Brennan's voice as. Combo of Jesus and Fergie? Well that's pretty much the best way to describe this too."
Such a beautiful room.   And such delicious food.It's a place that looks the part just as well as it acts the part.    Absolutely no surprises.   But that's a good thing.    A very good thing. So so so solid.  A can't miss choice in restaurant city.
So. freaking. good.
"A big speak easy with a french twist. Seafood towers are delic., although I wish they wouldn't chop up the crab leg meet for you (ahem, first world problems I know). Booths downstairs are kind of low, you sink in.. Feels awkward. Whiskey ice cream makes everything better though."
"This restaurant is amazing. We were seated downstairs and preferred it!!! So much more quiet and intimate. Make sure you make a reservation, it was super busy. Our host was Daniel and he's one of the best! Their drink selection is unique and have many we were unfamiliar with. Basically we told him what we like to drink and he knew what to recommend. His choices were on point. He was very patient with us and gave us time with the menu, no pressure or rush. Food....I kid you not, it's served FAST!!! Starters came out less than 7min. We ordered Garlic Shrimp and roasted Bone morrow. Remember this, if there's one thing you need to eat here, it's the bone morrow! We've never had before either. Garlic shrimp was on point, thick garlic butter sauce was amazing. Steaks are 5stars, meat loaf is so yummy! Definitely a must!  Thanks Daniel!"
"What an amazing birthday dinner! First of all, it's so beautiful inside. I was in love with the lighting and the music. Just perfect! And the service was amazing! I was wished happy birthday about 5 times but not in a cheesy awkward way but definitely sweet and genuine. Anyway, I recommend coming with a big appetite and a group so you can try everything! Which btw I heard there's a wait list for reservations so call now! My boyfriend got a 5:30 reservation after being on the wait list and just took it without second thinking it. Street parking seems a tad bit difficult and I didn't see valet but we got a spothero a block away so it wasn't bad. They have a cute waiting area with sofas that I waited as he parked and was offered the drink menu as I waited.Now for the good stuff! For drinks we got the punch and bf got this sumpin sumpin beer. Both good and strong! For food we skipped appetizer and probably should have skipped bread too but I ordered the petite filet prepared like the traditional (I don't like tomato) medium rare and he got the short rib stroganoff. Both were delicious but I won win the better meal. The meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce was divine. We shared elotes which I didn't love because I compared it to real street corn in Logan Sq but he liked it a lot. We couldn't even finish our food completely but had to get something sweet. None of the options looked knock your socks off good but our waitress recommended the dark chocolate pie. My bf doesn't care for dark chocolate but the Oreo crust definitely hides the bitterness. They brought it out with a candle and it was really tasty. The whip cream on top is a bit overwhelming but complimented it well. Overall great dinner from the service to my delicious filet. I can't wait to come back and try the goat cheese app and ribeye!!"
Friday night walked in with no resos! Only took half hour to get seated. Right off the bat John our server was super suave & personable. The ambiance was very much like Paris bistro. Sexy dark & sultry. Great one on one date spot.Shrimp cocktail was a generous portion for appetizer. Filet 10oz is perfect for sharing. Mashed potatoes is their more popular sides (no complaints) & the elote corn disk was quite the flavor orgasm!I very much enjoyed my night here and I'll definitely be back for more surf & turf.
"Amazing steak, service, and drinks.Their doubles are poured and priced very generously.  Service is impeccable, friendly, and knowledgeable.I had the Chicago cut ribeye, my brand new fiance had the petite filet.  Both were cooked perfectly.  The filet was beautiful and lean.  The ribeye had the right amount of fat and flavor.Crab cake is humongous and delicious.  The elote corn is a bit far and away different from your usual Mexican street-side corn, but was very tasty in a 'weird' way as our server put it.Would recommend again and again."
"Hidden gem, no Chicagoan ever told me about Bavette's when I asked for a recommendation around the best steak they've had in Chicago. Brought my lady here, she loved it every bit as much as I did. Service: - Seated timely, the waitress kept the sweet nectar of old fashions flowingAtmosphere:- Very intimate setting, lots of dark woods, dark (had to use my candle to read the menu), don't go if you're tired, could very easily pass out in the chair after your mealFood & Drink:- Best steak I've ever had, hands-down! I had the pepper crusted, prime bone in dry aged ribeye. My gawd.... can you say #foodporn - Fantastic sear, pepper crust that sealed in the flavor. Cooked a perfect medium and filled with juicy flavor. If Starburst made a steak flavor, this would be it- Sides: Thick cut bacon as a side, pomme frites w/ garlic aioli, all AMAZING. Fries weren't greasy and the garlic aioli was perfect. The thick cut bacon was a great addition to my steak and added to my meat sweats. - Drinks: I had a plethora of the Old Fashioneds - at least one of each. Whomever the mixologist was did a great job; the Old Overholt was my favorite. Great place for a date, we'll be back again... and again, and, you get it."
"Brought in some friends from out of town who wanted to go to a steak house, and they were more than happy that I brought them here last nite. They said Bavettes was one of the better steakhouses they have been to (they live in Dallas). And after finally having a full dining experience here, I have to agree with them. Cocktails are always great here. The cognac old fashioned is a must order for me. We started with the seafood platter. The crab legs were excellent - better than the ones at Joe's. Oysters hit the spot as well. They're very clean and fresh. The waiter generously threw in the duck and goat cheese terrine on the house. I didn't think it was all that. It felt like I was eating and looking at spam. It was only decent when I added the bread and orange marmalade to it. Perhaps it's an acquired taste. I'd definitely recommend the baked goat cheese instead, which I've had before. My friends each ordered the bone-in ribeye and loved it. Since I don't eat beef, I ordered the lamb t-bone. It was cooked perfectly. The sides were all amazing. Don't miss out on the eloute corn. I could eat that as just my meal. Ended the dinner with a glass of an incredibly rich and well-balanced Sazerac.Our waiter was great, and the entire staff is really nice. If you're looking for an amazing dining experience to impress some friends, then Bavette's is a great choice."
"GLORIOUS ribeye.  Way too big for me (but I wanted the ribeye, not the petit filet), so I took the leftovers home, cut it up into steak tips and used it in my arugula salads for the rest of the week.  So worth it.  Also, you can add bone marrow to your steak for cheaper than the actual bone marrow dish.  Hooray!For sides, the corn is amazing.  The fries were delightful.  And you can BYOB as long as you offer one glass of wine to a table nearby :)  It's tradition."
"Another recommendation we tried our luck after finding out it takes reservations weeks in advance. We were lucky there was a table available. It was beautiful restaurant we loved the ambiance the dim warm lighting and the exposed wall. The server was friendly and knowledgeable we ordered a chicago cut ribeye  and the bone in one. The meat melted in our mouths it was excellent mine had the extra au poivre crust it was so good, perfect medium rare. The fries were good and their specialty side was the corn it was a bit spicy and tangy very delicious. Our bottle of wine was also excellent it was a chassagne-montrachet pinot noir it opened up really beautifully. The malt whiskey ice cream sundae was also really excellent using a good product (malt whiskey ice cream) really made a difference. We were so full but could not stop eating the sundae. We had a great meal here."
"Such a cool place.  Great ambiance and awesome decor.  Service was pretty good.  The vibe is what gave this review an extra star. The food was good.  Just a smidge about average.  I had the pork chop and the bf had the roasted chicken, both were salty.  I guess the kitchen staff was feeling generous with the sodium that night.  And its hard to compete with STK in Vegas because they set the pork chop bar so darn high.  I also had the peppered duck terrine, for myself, too much for one person.  Make reservations!!!!  Less crowded if you make reservations for the basement.Would totally go back when I return to to Chicago!!"
"Great meal/experience and after dining here last night, I know why it's so popular and hard to get into. Food was delicious, however I have a 4 star because of how much salt and cream is used in the dishes which is a pet peeve of mine at places as nice as this. We had the Cesar salad with smoked white fish which was one of the best ones I have ever had. If you love smoked fish it's a MUST. We had the stroganoff which was excellent too, however a bit too rich in cream/flavor. Excellent service and drinks are amazing!"
"Another wonderful customer service experience. Steaks are LIFE CHANGING here! Waited a little long for our reservation, kind of pricey....but definitely worth every penny. Will be back, very romantic setting."
"A non-meat eater loves Bavette's Bar & Boeuf!!  This place is fantastic once you get past the awkward host stand, and of course, after you've had a reservation for 60 days.  We loved the service, the atmosphere, and we especially loved the food and drink.  We started with some cocktails.  I had the champagne cocktail which was lovely.  My friends had a horse neck and the gin & champagne cocktail which was the best of the 3.  We started with the baked goat cheese which was heavenly.  There is an herb in it that makes it totally unique.  We were guessing tarragon?  Then we were joking with the waiter and they mentioned that I don't eat most meats and he offered to bring me the vegetarian menu.  This was a first for me!  I had to check it out even though I was pretty sure I was getting the fried chicken based on these Yelp reviews.  It was nice to see that they had a lot of the same dishes but without meat and for a lesser price.  Regardless I got the chicken and was super pleased that I did.  It maybe the best fried chicken that I've ever had.  I think they double dip it :-) I don't really care for eating meat off of the bone so I was happy to have a side of broccoli with it.  It was just steamed broccoli but wow was it good!  Just perfectly cooked, with a little lemon.  Very nice.  Then we discovered that they have some Pappy and being a bourbon fanatic we had to try the 10 year in a manhattan for dessert....along with the best chocolate cream pie in the city.  That was a very happy moment.  We were sad to leave!  BTW my other friend got the chicken as well and our other friend has the beef stroganoff with extra mushrooms per our waiter.  You can get the stroganoff w/o beef for a few bucks less.  It looked to be a very rich and heavy dinner.  Just right for winter and bourbon drinking!!"
"I love Bavette's!  The atmosphere is super swanky, drinks are delicious, and the food is always cooked to perfection. My favorite is the seafood tower, filet with the seasoning on the side and French fries! I can't think of the other items, but everything is always scrumptious!"
"My first 5 star review!  Walk in and ambience already hooked me. Awesome speakeasy feel with a French twist.  From the Chandeliers to the awesome sofas in the waiting area.  Service from the very beginning was perfect. Water glasses were never less than 3/4 full.  I asked for a drink recommendation, the Lillet  rose martini.  Best martini I have ever had. Perfect blend of flavor.  Salmon tartare with creme fraiche .  Awesome!!  Bacon tomato salad.   This was good but we agreed to was about a 6 on a scale of 10 being the best.  The bacon on this was unbelievable.  We split two salads four ways and trust me we made sure the bacon split was perfectly even. .  The wedge salad which could be boring was absolutely awesome. Best ever. 10 all the way!short rib stroganoff. Awesome beef but very little in the dish. Like four pieces..  Noodles were a bit dense and lacked flavor.Rib eye no bone.  Best rib eye we all have had. Perfect seasoning and it was like butter.  10!!!Filet mignon was a 10 as well. Perfect flavor Fried chicken was incredible. With an awesome sauce for dipping. Very unique. I loved the corn.  The rest if my group did not agree, but I would order again in a heartbeat.  Creamed spinach was good not great. Great topping of cheese on the top. Outstanding service, great ambience, incredible food .  A must try!!!!"
"My new favorite spot for steak. And, once I try more of the menu, it could become my favorite for more. Now, some of the things I'm about to say would turn me from a restaurant. Not Bavette's. They screwed up my reservation. I arrived, checked in, was directed to the bar to have a cocktail and await my table. I ordered a Cognac Sazerac and hated it. It wasn't anyone's fault but mine. Just a poor choice for me. The barkeep whisked it away and replaced it with my second choice; a French 75. I happily sipped my delightfully potent drink and felt myself slip into the atmosphere. It's a blend of French bistro and speakeasy, but not too heavy on either often way overdone genre. An hour passed. The bartender asked if I wanted to order dinner. I mentioned that I was waiting for my table and asked if she would mind checking the status. In a few moments a gentleman approached. With numerous apologies he explained they had, indeed, lost me. He said my drinks would obviously be taken care of and pointed out several tables and told me to take my pick. I chose a large booth and settled into the deep red leather seat. After some tough contemplating I chose the 22oz, dry-aged, bone in ribeye and a side of the spicy Mexican corn. I had a glass of Malbec and loved sitting there, listening to acoustic jazz, swing, blues, watching other patrons. My steak was fabulous and the corn out of this world. I tipped big and will return. One note; I think there is a wall you hit with steak. Once you have the best meat, cooked perfectly, seasoned well, it can only get just so good. So, it's hard for me to say the steak I devoured last night was ""better"" than the 40 day-er at David Burke's Primehouse, the exquisitely marveled porterhouse or ribeye at Gibson's or any of the masterpieces of meat at the handful of places that do it exactly right. After that, it comes down to personal preference and taste and where you feel most comfortable. For me, it's Bavette's. I love the others, I welcome newcomers, I'll spread my steak lust around whorishly. But, for now, Bavette's has me."
"Went Sunday night to celebrate my nephew's engagement.  Never been before.  The food and service was outstanding. We ordered very expensive champagne and it was served ice cold - lovely.  Appetizers crab cake, shrimp and fois gras were cooked perfectly.  We brought our own vintage pinot noir which they opened with no corkage fee, just shared a glass.  We were 4 and all had the filet mignon that didn't need a knife to eat.  Had the corn and the garlic potatoes which were fantastic.  Would definitely recommend."
"OMG bone marrow! Ok, let me back track. For our one dinner night out in Chi-town, we wanted a really good dinner and this place seemed to be solidly well liked. We couldn't get a reservation until 9:45pm when we booked at around 5pm after a long day at Shedd. However it worked out with our appetite getting hungrier a bit later. We arrived around nine and they had a table already available too. We started with drinks that were very good: the mint julep, fairly deconstructed with lots of layering and mint and the horses neck which was smokey with bourbon and bright was ginger beer. Our appetizer was the OMG bone marrow, served with thick cuts of sourdough bread, onion relish and sprinkled with steak salt. It was just heavenly!! You can also order marrow to go along with your entree as well.All their meats are aged 28 days giving everything a rich, deep and robustly beefy flavor and texture. I got the 20 oz. ribeye which was cooked perfectly, no need for the extra table side steak salt. We also got the lamb which was also very well and richly flavored. The sides were good though were only sides: roasted heirloom tomatoes and cole slaw. For dessert, we got the cantaloupe sorbet which was surprisingly overly sweet though good; compliments of mint or some brighter flavor would have brought more balance to the dessert.Service was very good though I feel more due to the runners than the servers (ours pretty much took our order and disappeared and most of the work was done by the food runner, including wiping down our table after each course!)."
First time coming here and it was a great experience.I got the burger since I'm a college student and can't afford most of the things on the menu.It was a very good burger with a ton of flavor.They have just the right amounts of toppings on it and you don't need to add any mustard or ketchup to it (in fact you probably shouldn't since it would just mask the taste of the delicious beef).Their burger really helps make the restaurant available to anyone since a $10 burger isn't crazy pricey.
"This is a great restaurant - ambience, food and service are all excellent. This is our second visit to Chicago and our son made this reservation and we will definitely return. The bread is amazing - be careful or you will fill up quickly. We shared a shrimp appetizer - it was excellent.   And we shared the fois gras appetizer - good,but not the best I've had. Two of us had the petite filet. Absolutely buttery soft and delicious flavor. Two had the dry rub rib-eye (their signature steak) they both loved it. Huge portions. The restaurant is beautiful inside.  Loved the lighting and overall ambience. Romantic.   Definitely a place for a memorable evening.."
"I really enjoyed Bavette's (and I also like the name ""Bavette"").  The restaurant is romantic and old fashioned, and the food was simple and delicious. We started with some wine and shortly after ordering we were brought out some excellent warm sourdough bread and salted butter.  We could have easily polished off an entire loaf, but sadly, that did not happen.   I ordered the salmon au poivre and he ordered a ribeye steak.  We split side dishes of roasted brocolli, garlic mashed potatoes, and butternut squash. The vegetables were flavorful and perfectly cooked, and the salmon was amazing - the pepper coated crust added an interesting touch to the delicate fish. We were here celebrating a birthday, so I thought they might bring out some kind of special birthday treat - however, since we didn't order dessert (we had an entire cake awaiting us elsewhere), they brought out just a lone lit candle on a naked plate.  The candle was a nice gesture, but it was actually kind of sad.  How about a scoop of ice cream or *something* to stick the candle in?  Other than that semi-weird end note, the meal was excellent."
"Really wish I could give this place more stars. I came here last week for my boyfriends' birthday instead of our usual pick down the street of Gilt Bar (which is PHENOMENAL). The food was amazing (get the bone marrow!) but service was lacking. Our waiter was not very attentive - it took serious effort to wave him down for more drinks because he was too busy talking to who must of been friends at other tables. When we were ready to pay and leave, instead of asking how everything was, he simply tossed the check on the table and walked off. Food - 5 starsAmbiance - 5 stars upstairs / 3.5 in parlor where we were seated. Service - 2"
"One of the best restaurants I've ever been. Great ambiance, like a 1920's speakeasy. Fantastic Jazz music Ella Fitzgerald style. Two Thumbs UP- Very UP. It's about time Chicago has a fabulous looking, lighting, sounding, and tasting restaurant. A special place indeed. Amazing Sound System. What an experience!!!"
"This might be the most unique and cultured steak house in Chicago. It is for those who want their steak in an intimate and continental atmosphere. We loved Bavette's. Downstairs is dark and romantic. Our table had oysters (great), Steaks (great) meatloaf, (?) and a Berkshire Pork Chop (fantastic). Do order the duck confit too. The bar mixes the best! Expect to spend some bucks too."
"What a fantastic experience! We walked in hoping to score seats at the bar and were very pleased to find room. I started with the salmon tartare which turned out to be a generous portion and more than enough to share. We ordered a bottle of wine from their expansive and impressive list and followed up with main courses of steak - of course! The steak was absolutely divine: perfectly cooked, seasoned and delivered piping hot. I choose a side of fully loaded baked potato and couldn't be happier. The potato was almost the size of my head! As if the evening couldn't get better, the bartender, Damien, was an absolute delight and real pro. He was fantastic at his job and lit up our evening with his engaging conversation throughout our meal. A definite 5 star experience. Just WOW!"
"So I've been looking for a great steak house in Chicago for a few years now. I've been all over, but I think I have finally found my favorite place.First lets start off with the ambiance of this place. It's really dark, kind of tucked away into a building, no windows, dim lighting. I think I would go insane here if I worked here all day.. Regardless, I'm here to rate the food, not the lighting levels. We started off with the bone marrow app. Can't go wrong with that right? It was delish. I wish they had large crushed sea salt to go with it though.. The bread was perfect though, I'm tired of places giving stale bread with the bone marrow. This bread was nice and soft and large.Then we had a Mixed Green Apple Salad. WOW! So much flavor from that cheese in the salad! Mix it with the apple shavings and it was the perfect blend of taste. Don't forget those candy nuts.For my meal I got the Prime Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye. This thing was AMAZING! SO MUCH FLAVOR! I think it was dry aged about 32 days and wet aged about 28.. It was sooo good! The outside had this crust to it that tasted amazing, and the inside melted in my mouth like butter. The best steak I've ever had. I highly highly recommend this one.For a side we got the corn. Best corn ever. It's orange corn and it has a bit of a kick to it with a lime after taste. You can't beat it, and you've probably never had anything like it. So make sure you order it! It's also pretty light so you will have plenty of room for your steak in your stomach. I'd definitely like to come back here! $200 for 2 people, a bit pricey but well worth it."
"My husband insisted on trying this place even though I don't eat red meat.  Took forever to get a reservation - so plan ahead.  I was relieved to find salmon on the menu, along with a number of appealing sides.  Ambience is nice, tables perhaps a tad too close together, but lots of wood and tasteful low lighting.  Goat cheese starter was excellent, husband's filet was excellent, side order of elote outstanding.  My salmon (which they had warned was cooked ""Medium rare"") was raw on the inside.  They took it back to the kitchen and cooked it some more but it was still raw.  They were very kind, took it off the bill immediately, and to be candid I was already full with the side dishes so, no harm no foul.  Moral: if you go to a meat place, don't expect them to know how to cook a fish."
"OBSESSED! Doesn't get better than this.Atmosphere - GREAT! Good for a date, good for a night out with the girls, good to take your parents or out of town guests....no matter what, good choice!Food - YUM! YUM YUM YUM! Like, wow good. All of it. My favorite was the Crab Stuffed Avocado and shrimp cocktail...and the steak OMG. Couldn't get enough.I can't wait to go there again. If only the reservation was easier to get!"
"Good shit, nice steakhouse. Exactly what it should be, no complaints just a solid meal."
Been waiting to add Bavette's to my list. & the place is everything I was hoping for. The atmosphere is perfect light chatter & dem light. The service is TOP NOTCH! The food was excellent. From the oysters to the terrine. The fried chicken to the filet/steak & frits. Brandon is a rock star server & the cocktails were perfect. Will be back!
"We were seated promptly after I had booked my reservation a month in advance. This place must be pretty popular as I've tried times before and couldn't get dates 2 weeks in advance. We had a very nice corner table where the server did wish my boyfriend a happy birthday as we were here for his dinner, and I did note that in my comments through Open Table. I ordered the Bone In 'Delmonico' Strip and a side of the Creamed Spinach. I was appreciative of the server letting me know that the side was a little spicy, and it was and really yummy. I love the ambiance of the place warm, cozy, and romantic. It can be dressy or casual. The staff was friendly and the prices were reasonable. I can see why so many people like this place. I would certainly like to come back."
"I had did my research on Bavette's prior to coming...I can't even begin to tell you how AMAZING my experience was!! The service was hands down the BEST...all the staff were so accommodating and friendly!! The food was better than amazing...the shrimp cocktail were bigger than I thought were ever possible!! The peppered duck and goat cheese terrine was something I never experienced...the bread alone was so fresh and tasteful, the apricot sauce was to die for and then the peppered duck with goat cheese was the cherry on top!!! Our main entree was filet mignon and it literally melted in your mouth with the bearnaise sauce!! Then we ended our dinner with the whiskey ice cream and chocolate cream pie (heard many good things about this dessert), HOLY MOLY...it was honestly the best dessert I have EVER had!!! So, besides the amazing food and service the ambience of Bavette's was incredible. Perfect date atmosphere...I highly recommend going!! So excited to have got a reservation and can't wait to visit again!!!"
"So it is with the deepest regret that I MUST write this update! Bavette's was my favorite restaurant in the city until my birthday dinner with my 5 girlfriends (4/21/15...first post was same exact day a few yrs ago). I visit this restaurant at least once a month (weekly when they first opened...lol) and I've never been disappointed! Service always impeccable, food always better than the last visit and the atmosphere always swanky!  I've celebrated major events, entertained clients and visiting guests, enjoyed several first dates....you get it...it's my ef'n fav restaurant...until this visit! (side bar...after recalling all the times I've been here...why doesn't anyone acknowledge that when I walk my ass through the door! lol...I'm just say'n)  The server, although super sweet, was just not as on point as all the previous servers I've experienced! But the killa...I mean the VIBE KILLA OF ALL VIBE KILLERS.... when the server described the fried chicken to one of my girlfriends (the fried chicken is what I get almost every time) I almost passed out! ""The fried chicken is boneless, skinless, breaded and fried in pork fat!"") HUH? So I politely asked ""I've had the fried chicken here before, has it changed?"" And she shares the story of the changed fried chicken...the Chef wanted the chicken to be more appropriate for fine dining? HUH again? Since when is fried chicken fine dining but ok...""the Chef wants you to eat it with a fork and knife."" Well, fancy fried chicken eaters do it that way when it's on the bone but who the ef cares...I ordered friend chicken and I know how the hell that comes...at least I knew how it came here! On the bone, with skin, crunchy on the outside and super juicy on the inside...it WAS outstanding fried chicken!  But it's completely inedible now...each piece I put on my friends plates was still there at the end of the meal and frankly I was more pissed that the discussion of how awful the fried chicken was overshadowed ME! (my only child syndrome kicked in...don't judge me) It was my damn birthday and now I'm made to have a 20 min conversation with 4 black female foodies & one crazy about friend chicken Puerto Rican about fried ef'n chicken when all could have bee avoided with serving what previously worked! Whew! I mean this chicken was the worst I've ever had! The breading was thick and flavorless...well it had the flavor of flour! It was extremely greasy and frankly ugly on the plate! It had the appearance of southern fried chicken minus the gravy! Just not good at all! So with that...I'm hoping they at least give the option to have the original recipe on the menu! Now that I've vented, everything else that came out was delicious as always...steaks perfect, side dishes delicious, sweets & cocktails superb! Just give me back my fried chicken on the bone please & thank you! (and a hey Bambi thanks for visiting for the millionth time would be a nice touch! lmao)"
"Just went there tonight and felt the need to write this review right away. This place deserves the best reviews, the best words! this was a post graduation dinner with my parents that came all the way from France. I was a little afraid since they are picky eaters. They took the Steak frites and I took the filet mignon. Best meat I've ever eaten, sooo good! More I picked the cheapest white wine I found on the card and I loved it ( just couldn't recall the name but it was very sweet, the way i like). For dessert, I took the chocolate pie but couldn't finish it (no waste, I took it home :) ) my parents took the lemon pie and my mom said it was the best she has eaten ( not to mention, my mom is the pickiest person I know  when it comes for eating). Also, extra note for the service, just perfect. Our main server was such a nice person, all smiling, very patient because my parents don't speak much english and He even said goodbye in French to them. My dear server, hope If i come back, we will see each other again, you are such sweetheart. Last, I took the french press coffee, great choice as well.Nothing negative, ALL POSITIVE.  Thank youHope I will come back soon."
I only sat at the bar but had a great time. Dim and dreamy atmosphere. The seafood tower was fantastic. I had a great blue cheese olive Martini and and even better Old Fashion.
Great restaurant.  Great steaks!  We had a terrific dinner at Bavette's.  Their ribeye was one of the best steaks ever.  The baked sweet potato was the bomb!  But the best thing about Bavette's is their corkage policy.  Bring up to 2 bottles of your own wine and pay no corkage as long as you share a glass from each with someone else in the restaurant.  What a cool idea!
Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. We loved it! Ate foie gra for the first time. And the chocolate cake was so good!
AMAZING!!! Fries fried in pig fat it's so good it has to be crack it's too ADDICTING lol and the Steak is BOMB!!! Ambiance is very Prohibition Era a lil blast from the past and the music slaps. What steakhouse do you know plays NAS.Alcohol is Strong! We waited about 90 minutes and I a lemon drop martini and my husband had a Hennesey Mojito and we were buzzed by the time we sat down. :)If my husband and I go back to Chicago this is the place to be hands down.
"Completely deserving of its reputation - the food and the service are fantastic.  It goes without saying that you pay an inflated price for it, but worth it.  The ambiance is dimmed candlelight with exposed wood and brick and luxurious booth seating.  Peppered duck & goat cheese terrine was ahhh. may. zing.  Just a hint of pepper to it, set off to perfection with the creamy goat cheese and the sweetness of the apricot mustard.  The toast is a thick bread and accompanies heartily.  When we ran low on it we didn't have to ask for another helping - it was offered promptly.Chicago cut ribeye was spot on - a slight char to the outside, perfectly done on the inside, and an overall heaven happening in my mouth experience.  A bonus bernaise on the side again reminded my palate how lovely it is to have contrasts in between each scrumptious bite.Elote style corn - has corn ever been so decadent and so layered in flavor?  I don't think so.  It's a unique preparation and the lime matches well with the parmesan creaminess, with a kicky edge from the chili.Creamed spinach - this was almost too rich for me, but it was soooo good.  A bit on the salty side, but fantastic.I was so food-coma'd out that I left my wallet on the seat of the booth and the waiter came rushing after me to make sure I didn't leave without it.  Like I said, great service on top of everything else."
"Make sure you call in for reservations or you'll wait for some time.What we ordered:Steak frits and frys, medium rare: 5/5Roasted Chicken: 5/5Bone Marrow: 5/5Side of Corn: 5/5Steak was tender and juicy. Cooked perfectly. Roasted chicken was soft and tender and exceptionally seasoned. The bone marrow was delicious. Side if corn was interesting but nonetheless delicious."
"Mocktail Report: On my most recent visit a very friendly female bartender made me an amazing drink of muddled citrus, grapefruit juice, ginger beer and crushed ice, topped with a mint sprig. It was beautiful and amazing. I also loved that the bartender took the time to make me something special and then describe what she had done. It felt very personal."

"My 2015 New Year's resolution is to try a new, different eatery every weekend. Boy did I start off on the right foot! Went here 01/02 for my boyfriend's birthday and we were not the least bit dissapointed. We opted away from the steaks because we had a long night ahead of us and didn't want to feel too full. He ordered the burger and I the prime beef sandwich. Both were perfect! The best burger in a loooong time!. And the tenderness of the prime rib was to die for! Paired with the drinks that Damian, a bartending master, prepared for us, it was a memorable night. The service was quick and attentive. The ambiance is cozy and unpretentious. I absolutely loved it here and can't wait to come back to try the steaks."
"Holy mother of God... this place was AMAZING. The speak-easy environment is so fun, and they have a rule that instead of a corkage fee, you have to share a glass with the table next to you. This definitely promotes the speak-easy vibe. The couple next to us was celebrating their 40th ""meeting"" anniversary and shared a glass of an AMAZING pinot noir with us, along with wonderful conversation. There's a beautiful bar on the main floor, and then another, smaller, more intimate one down a story. Great wine list, as well!Everything we had was DELICIOUS:*goat cheese spread on texas toast*salmon tartare*sweet potato souffle*crab cakes*crab stuff avocado saladMake a reservation now! They fill up. :)"
"I forgot to check in while we were there. We visited friends in Chicago for the weekend 12/6. Saturday night they made reservations for us in the downstairs lounge. Great vibe, great service, great food. If we had half stars, this place would be 4.5. Since there aren't half stars, they deserve to be round up not down. I don't take 5 stars lightly. Service - we had two servers. They were super cool, fun guys. They listened to us, provided advice, super attentive. When laying out almost $200 per person meal, excellent service is a must.Atmosphere - we sat downstairs. Definitely a cooler vibe than upstairs. It was dark and ""loungey"". Kind of loud but not to the point where you can't hear. Food - we had a seafood tower as an appetizer. Lobster, shrimp, and oysters. All fantastic. We had crab stuffed avocado...YUM. Sides - pommes frites and creamed spinach and thick cut bacon. Again, YUM. My friend and I both had the petite filet. My husband had the dry aged bone in rib eye. My friend's husband had the Pork Chop. All good was fantastic. I'm not sure I would change a thing. Even with all of the restaurants in Chicago, I would come back here on a future visit. I highly recommend."
"Of course opinions are subjective, but mine is that Bavette's is the perfect restaurant for a nice night out. Their menu is concisely filled out with simple yet surprisingly memorable dishes. They bake their own sourdough that San Francisco can't touch. They cure their own thick cut bacon that would make Farmer John faint. The drink menu is outstanding, especially if you like whiskey.The decor and ambience are classic, elegant, but not stuffy.The service has always been terrific but not over bearing.If you're into steaks and whiskey, you won't find a better restaurant anywhere."
"I've been to Bavette's several times and have had top notch food and service.  Since we didn't have reservations my husband and I decided to try and get seated last Friday when the restaurant opened at 5.Again the food and service was great except.....the prime bone in dry aged ribeye.  The color of the steak was beautiful and the meat was cooked to the perfect temperature.  I went to take a bite and the steak was luke warm and bland!  I've had this steak numerous times and this was the first.Being a well mannered Midwestern I didn't mention the steak till the end of the meal. The more I ate the steak the more it became apparent that the steak was off and finally had to tell the server.The next disappointment was management's response.  He immediately came by to apologize and then....nothing.  I guess the steak being $60 and that we've come often and this was the first time the steak was sub par I thought he came by to offer at least free dessert.  But nada.Combo of being disappointed by the steak and the manager's response equal 3 star.  But Bavette's is such a fantastic restaurant that another chance is warranted.  Be forewarned that if you do go during off hours, the cooking staff mighty not be warmed up."
"When I think of Bavette's, I think of an old fashioned, oysters and a steak.Everything that this restaurant group puts out there succeeds and Bavette's is no different. I'd go here over any of the staple Chicago steak houses."
"My husband and I came in for our anniversary dinner here, it was delicious! The service was great- the wine was perfect and the food was outstanding. We had the garlic shrimp de jongne appetizer (which I am not a big seafood person) but I defiantly ate all the shrimp. It was cooked to perfection and flavored well.  My husband had the Prime Bone dry aged ribeye with the bone marrow on top it was fantastic and I had the filet mignon cooked perfect usually places always cook it to medium for me but medium well was delicious!!  I suggest everyone to go here I am defiantly going back! :)"
"Bavette's in Chicago delivers. Great French Brasserie with of course, great steak frites but also a simple but fantastic menu. Great Bar, handcrafted drinks and the place has a vibe.  It is however, very, very expensive. So, if you come prepare for a great meal, but bring your wallet."
"One of my favorite spots in the city.  Great ambiance- 1920's vibe, dark, romantic, and sexy.  Trendy but not pretentious.  Customer service is phenomenal- everyone is super nice, cool, and most importantly knowledgeable about their wine and food.  Great for dinner and/or cocktails. Get the dry aged steak, seafood tower, and/or beef stroganoff.  Really though, get the beef stroganoff.  Chocolate pie for dessert with whip cream.  Food is more on the heavy side, so if you are here to eat dinner, plan on just doing that then passing out afterwards."
More of a 4.5 but I wanted to be generous and round up.Had the bone in ribeye which was very good.  Didn't like the mashed potatoes but the corn was very good.  Key lime was decent.  Service was attentive.
"Is it even possible to walk into this place and not order a manhattan or an old fashioned?  Bavette's is a scene that would have absolutely thrived under a lingering cloud of cigar smoke in the Mad Men era.  The corkage policy for BYOB is fun and unique (no fee, but you have to share a glass with another table).  If we're rating steakhouses on atmosphere alone, I'd put Bavette's #1 in the city.  As for the food: the steaks were better than average, though I wouldn't put them in the upper tier."
"YASSSS!I finally made it here! I went on a Friday night at about 5:15pm. (Senior citizen swag!) My friend and I were initially struck by how dark it was inside - no windows, either. It's very romantic, but it's also a place where you might have to greet people by feeling their faces to make sure it's them. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful. My friend got a Cotes du Rhone, and I got a Kir Royale (my first ever and not my last!). After we ordered our entrees, they came out in almost a break-neck speed. I think it's because we were there on the early side. My medium filet was perfectly cooked and flavorful. My friend's short rib stroganoff was indulgent and comforting, as that dish should be. And the side of peppered, thick-cut bacon? It didn't hurt. ;)I would easily recommend Bavette's. It could use a TINY bit more lighting, but it's a nice hideaway on Kinzie. It felt very old-school and classy - indeed, it was only after I left the restaurant that I realized that Calvin Coolidge was no longer our president."
"Made a reservation for dinner, and arrive a couple of minutes early (4:58 pm). Upon arrival, I was soaking wet, despite having a raincoat and umbrella. The hostess was incredibly rude, not just to me, but other patrons (one woman asked about towels in the restroom, and got an eye roll) waiting to be seated. I asked if I could visit the ladies room, and she refused my request. Even as I left the restaurant she maintained her sullen and unfriendly demeanor. Not sure why restaurants hire such unpleasant people to greet the public. Can't be good for business.The waiter came by to greet me and take my drink order. I wanted the Barbera d'alba and asked if it came by the glass. I was told no, so I asked for the bottle ($67) ... Not intending to drink the whole thing (attending a conference and dining alone), but that was the wine I wanted and told the waiter it was my favorite (see previous reviews). He refused, and told me I had to order wine by the glass. I was embarrassed, and instead of leaving in a huff, I complied. As for the food... The wedge salad was a huge disappointment. Two thick slabs of bacon sat on top of a mound of ranch covered iceberg lettuce. Hardly a crumb of blue cheese could be found... The presentation was lazy and unappetizing, and the taste... pedestrian. Enjoyed the sourdough bread and salted butter. The steak, a petite filet, yummy. No complaints.The baked sweet potato was all sugar, very little finesse. It was a disappointing experience."
"My wife and I stopped by for a post Christmas Dinner. Definitely lived up to our expectations and I would highly recommend it. The restaurant was pretty cool. Definitely a speakeasy vibe with some modern twists. We got to the restaurant a bit early and valet parked the car for $14. We went to the bar ordered our drinks and by the time they were served our table was ready.Service was good. We didn't love our waiter but he made some good recommendations so it evened out. This is what we had for the night:Drinks: I had 3 Beers-Alpha King. My wife had 3 different drinks, French 75, Bavettes Punch and Dark & Stormy. They were all good but she seemed to like the Dark & Stormy the most. Oysters: We did a dozen, 3 of each on the menu. It works well because I love West Coast Oysters and my wife loves East Coast oysters. They were fantastic and a good starter.Salad: Wedge salad based off our waiters recommendation. I would go back just for the salad. The star of the salad is bacon and honestly, it's the best bacon I have ever tasted. It's so good we both started laughing when we tried it. If you aren't going to order the bacon on the side, I would order the wedge Salad.Dinner: We ordered the bone in ribeye and fried chicken, with the pommes frittes and elote corn as sides. The bone in ribeye is one of the best steaks I've ever had. We ordered it medium and didn't need the sauce that came with it. Seasoning was perfect and well cooked. The fried chicken is excellent. The breading and ranch sauce are great.Pommes Frittes are at out of this world good. The Garlic aioli is perfect complimentElote corn was ok-I was disappointed because I had high hopes for the dish and it was just ok. Dessert: Chocolate cream pie was rich but delicious. I would definitely recommend. Overall, the meal was great and I would recommend it. Afterwards, I was about as full as could be-the same with my wife. We could have skipped one of the side dishes and been just fine. Our total bill was just over $300. It was pricy but well worth it."
"Great atmosphere, great Old Fashioned, great food. The Berkshire pork chop was great, the elote style corn was even better. My fiance lover her filet. They also have these seafood towers that look outstanding......if I liked shellfish. Great restaurant and bar!"
"OK so my real review is 3.5 stars.Atmosphere: 5Food: 3.5Service: 3.5Value: 3.5So this place has an amazing atmosphere, a real gem for Chicago. Unfortunately, the food just didn't live up to my expectations. I ordered the Prime Rib with Mashed Potatoes, nothing out of the ordinary... the waiter  (who rushed us to order and was a little abrasive) came back to let us know they were out of potatoes. Very strange considering I'm sure this has to be one of the top two sides. I ended up ordering the Steak and Frites. My wife ordered the Beef Stroganoff and she was really excited. The stroganoff tasted Asian!! So strange, although not bad it really tasted of soy sauce which in my book was not good. The Steak and Frites were good, but I thought the fries seemed a little dry and the steak was good but nothing to write home about.All in all, great place would return, but just missed the mark in a few areas. The bar tenders were super friendly though, which is uncommon I find.I hope this helps, and if you're wondering if this place is ""Fancy""... it's not. It's as fancy as you want it to be. We were pretty casually dressed and didn't not feel awkward."
"The place is sexy w a class & welcoming.  Not pretentious at all.  Love the check in area separate from dining room.   Smart :)Food: all great portions! Shrimp de jonghe w toasted garlic bread.  Delish! 5/5Waldorf salad.  Perfect flavors.  5/5Traditional filet w roasted garlic & mushrooms 5/5.   ""Best steak in Chicago""Roasted Chicken.  5/5Elote corn.  Zesty & tasty.  Great side. 5/5Bacon. 6/5.  4 PC of the best bacon ever! (Same bacon as au cheval) We cannot wait to return.  This place is absolutely fab!! Great for special occasions and to wow a steak lover.It's 11/11/13 and their Saturday night reservations are booked into Feb 2014! It really is THAT good..."
"My new favorite steak place in the city. WOW! I sat at the bar, as the wait for a table without reservations might have been awhile. Glad I sat at the bar. For 1.5 hrs I enjoyed watching the bartenders make amazing cocktails. I had my first ""old fashioned"". =)Every aspect of the meal was amazing. To start I had: Salmon Tartare house crackers, creme fraicheandRoasted Bone Marrow caramelized red onion jam, parsley salad.as my main course I hadPrime Bone In Filet bearnaise, steak salt. limited availabilityand Thick Cut Bacon maple, black pepper.OH!!! and the bread was great! Sea salt butter! Yum! I can't stand having a great meal and having the first thing to come out (usually bread) being crappy. Not here though. I've been fortunate enough to have dined at most of the best steak places in the city and this place is my favorite. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the others are wonderful too, but this place takes the prize."
"They have a separate vegan and vegetarian menu, ask for it.  This is such a great place to take steak-lovers and people of varying diets, and the vegan options will not disappoint!  The good:+ Separate vegan/vegetarian menu with creative options.+ Roasted tomato side was not only tasty, but beautiful.+ Baked potato was pretty tasty.+ Bib salad was OK, but that's because they had to replace the dressing (which has egg in it) with just vinegar and oil and wasn't really flavorful.+ My meat eating counterpart loved the steak and really loved the bib salad with egg dressing.+ The $275 bottle of wine was pretty phenominal (can't remember the name, but it was the only one with that specific price, mind you there were pricier wines than that).+The other mixed drinks were good too.The bad:- If you're in a hurry, you'll want to save this place for some other time.- 2-3 month wait for a reservation."
"Well, this place is terrible in the fact that I realized everything I have eaten before this has been incorrect. :)My boyfriend and I basically had half the menu, and everything was perfect. The service was spectacular as well. I seriously have been non-stop talking about this place for over a week. If you are looking to splurge on a great steak dinner with all the fixins, give this place a try, you will not be disappointed."
"2 friends had recommended this place so came for my post graduation dinner with family. Did not make a reservation, but was seated at a table for 4 at around 5:30 on a Friday. Very dark inside and reminded me of a speakeasy. Ordered the filet mignon petite dutchess cut- soooo tender and cooked just right. They give you a mix of spices on the side with a creamy sauce as well, but honestly the steak is so flavorful already that you don't need it. Sister ordered the classic ribeye chicago cut and I liked hers so much we traded half way. Steak was very juicy and again cooked perfectly with no other sauces or spices needed. My mother ordered the chicken (I know who orders chicken at a steakhouse??), but surprised the roasted chicken was very tender and juicy. For sides-Must try the elote style corn- has a cheesy and chili spice taste. The sweet potato side is very large! Loaded baked potato was also very large, but yummy and loaded with ham, cheddar cheese, and sour cream. Was too full to try dessert =\ But def would come back."
"Bavette's if probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  My wife and I are less than ""foodies"" but Bavettes is hands down in our top 5 Chicago restaurants.  We went last night for an impromptu dinner and reaffirmed out love for this place.  Being a wino, I love their corkage policy of sharing a glass with another guest.  I get to bring my unique wines without paying triple price and someone there gets to enjoy a taste of something new.I always get the steak as its prepared to perfection.  The bone in Ribeye and Filet will blow you away.  Also love the bolognese.Great atpmosphere for a date as its dark and lively but not loud.  The basement is a great atmosphere as well.  We will be back for sure!"
"When my midwestern husband declares the ribeye to be the best steak he has ever eaten in his life - this place deserves 6 stars!Great drinks, some classic ones and some with a twist - but the 4 of us passed around each others drinks and loved everything that we ordered.  Even though I hate paying so much for oysters, the coromandel's were quite fabulous...We ordered a bunch of other foods to share in order to maximize trying all the yumminess - caesar salad was the bomb, peppered duck and goat cheese pate was very different and tasty, foie gras pate (although very fatty) had a lot of flavor.  The only ""disappointment"" were the marrow bones.  I still dream about the deliciousness of a 22 oz medium rare ribeye though.  Can't wait to be back!"
"Very impressed! I'm adding this to my staple list for future visits to Chicago. It's the perfect spot for an intimate date and yet I'd imagine it also being a lot of fun for a group dinner. The food was remarkably good and yet reasonably priced. The bottle of 2004 St. Emilion that our waiter recommended was simply incredible! The appetizer portions were much larger than expected and we couldn't finish all of our food. Go in knowing that you'll be able to share the apps and sides. Sit back, enjoy the delicious food, fantastic wines, and savor the incredible atmosphere that Bavette's has created."
"Went on a Sunday night, and the place was pretty crowded with a lively noise level.  We arrived a little early for our 7:30 p.m. reservation and were guided to the bar to wait for our table, which was fine with me.  Met a very friendly and helpful bartender named Jay who made me a great Sazerac, even better than the ones I'd had in New Orleans.  While making our drinks, Jay took great care to measure correctly and otherwise take time to make the drinks properly.  What really made that Sazerac, though, was the twist of lemon which was taken right off the fruit, not from a garnish tray where it had been sitting around for hours.  It was so fresh, it created an aromatic experience when I put my nose to the glass - a wonderful prelude to the taste that was to follow.  That drink was so good, I had another one with dinner.Speaking of dinner, we started with the smoked trout Caesar salad, which was absolutely delicious.  The rich garlicky taste of the Caesar dressing was just punched up with that smoky fish.  We also had the shrimp DeJonge, a garlic shrimp dish with a luxuriously rich sauce that we couldn't stop mopping up with the accompanying toast.When it came to the steaks, they were definitely good, but not outstanding, maybe just not living up to the hype.  The lady had a petite filet, and although there's not a whole lot you can expect from a cut such as that (tenderness being the exception), it was disappointing that it actually dried out midway though the meal.  I had the much-lauded dry-aged bone-in ribeye, which just didn't knock me over in any way.  Sure, it was tender, but didn't have that distinctive dry-aged flavor, and also had a lot more fat than I would have liked, even for a ribeye.  For a $60 steak, I just expected more.For accompaniments, we had the mashed potatoes and the elote-style corn.  Both dishes were good, but also both very rich.  On the one hand, they stood up to all the other richness on the table, but maybe just put things too far over the top.  Maybe I just need to put a little more thought into balance when ordering dinner next time!Service was great, with both our server and busser checking on us at regular intervals and engaging us in small conversation without being intrusive.I'll come back, maybe for the food, but definitely for more of those Sazeracs."
"My personal no.1 Chicago Steak House and allow me to explain why. The environment...wow....love it. Somewhat of a slick speakeasy old charm to it. Been here more than 3 times and the only negatives I can provide are a douche of a server and the whiskey cocktail I order didn't do much for me. With that said I've had the bone in rib eye medium prepared excellently. Wedge salad with bacon... wow. you would think, "" hey how good can a salad be?"" but this is salad worth getting everytime. The bacon that accompanies it just blew my taste buds away. Side of garlic mash potatoes was the best I've ever had. Seasoned excellently with just the right texture not too watery or soft. For dessert we had the golden brick sundae with malt whiskey ice cream and it was the best ice cream I ever had. I seem to be repeating myself restating ""best I've ever had"". That should tell you something. My new favorite steak house over david burke's. In additional visits I've tried the NY Strip, magnificent. My company order the chicken entree she enjoyed very much. If you appreciate a steak of grandeur with a matching layout don't miss this spot."
"Steak is really good.Appetizers Delicious.Desserts just normal but in huge portionsCorking fee was fun.  For each bottle you identify another table to give a glass to, cuz seriously, we're not finishing the whole bottle anyway.I had a ribeye cooked black and blue and that was cooked perfectly.  If you like it done that way these guys severely impressed.  I think this would be reason enough to come here.The Beef tongue appetizer was quite delicious.  The wife will order anything beef tongue and this impressed.  The atmosphere is great, service was great, this place is as solid as it gets for a steak place.  This place isn't among the best steak places I've been to... yet... but it's teetering over there.  Another visit is definitely warranted."
"Easily one of the top-3 restaurants I've ever been to in my life. Absolutely everything from the top down was perfect. Loved the 1920s style atmosphere and rustic feel of this place. From the music, to the clothes the servers were wearing was reflective, to the lighting- it felt like classic Chicago.The food was to die for! My god I had never been so blown away by such deliciousness. My friend and I shared a steak frites with elote and creamed spinach. The steak was melt in your mouth perfection and the fries were beautifully seasoned and crispy- complemented the steak very well. I wasn't expecting much when I ordered the creamed spinach but WOW this was the best one I've ever had- bursting with flavor and had a perfect cheesy texture to it.The elote was fantastic too- not something you'd expect from a place like this, but it was amazing nonetheless like everything else here.Even though we were filled to the rim with food, we decided to get the whiskey ice cream too- I loved this so much. It was a perfect ending to one of the most mind blowing dining experiences I've had.It's hard typing this review because I'm getting so hungry. It's too bad I was just visiting Chicago- I wish I had this place close to me. I know where I'm going first next time I'm in town though.Phenomenal job guys. Standing ovation."
I cannot begin to describe how delicious the food was. I had the steak along with a few appetizers. You can't go wrong here! It's a bit low key. Not noisy at all. They had great cocktails.
"Last minute, we were looking to celebrate a birthday and enjoy a nice steak with no reservations in mind. Thankfully, Bavette's hold a few tables for walk-in, and considering it was only 5 p.m. or so on a Sunday, we were able to be seated immediately. We had been debating other options, but after a previous visit here, we knew we couldn't go wrong with the food and the ambiance.In standard Sodikoff fashion, you'll be immersed in a completely new environment; this one is particularly classic and intimate. On this occasion, the service was excellent - incredibly friendly on a personable level and very helpful with our biggest debate of the night - foie gras terrine or salmon tartare. His pro-tip (which I fully back): order the foie gras terrine, save some, and spread it over your steak. Decadence. For two, we shared the prime bone-in dry-aged ribeye, broccoli, and mashed potatoes. Definitely more than we needed, but worth it. The ribeye was on point - prepared medium rare, delivering an almost buttery taste and texture. I didn't care for the bearnaise much; for me, the tanginess contrasted too much with the steak for me to enjoy a more unadulterated flavor of the steak. Meanwhile, I would say the foie gras terrine was a perfect complement to the steak, maintaining the rich meatiness theme of the steak. Oh, and what really stole the show here - the chocolate creme pie. It's the perfect balance between rich and subtle. Usually with chocolate, I can only do a few bites because it's often too rich; but, I could probably eat through a whole pie, not just a slice. Must get it."
"Umm.. I am a big steak fan... And well all the reviews are right! Best steak in Chicago!!! Came here tonight to celebrate my boyfriend birthday! To begin.. The decor and ambience was relaxed, classy, different, and maybe in a different era.. I would say the 1920's.As for drinks.. We brought our own bottle of wine! The corkage fee is different than any other restaurant. They have you pick or they pick someone in the restaurant to have a glass of your wine. Pretty cool! I heard they have an epic cocktail menu.. Next time will try! Lastly the food...... Can I say outstanding???? The bone marrow is perfect! We split the bone and ribeye steak! It was tender, tasty, flavorful, and cooked to perfection!  We also had the oysters! I wish I ordered more they were addicting! Lastly,  had the duck goat cheese as an appetizer and it was delicious!!I would of loved to try the dessert but I was pretty full by the time the dessert menu came. Basically.... Come here!!!! You won't be disappointed!"
"I've had two incredible dinners at Bavette's. The atmosphere is incredible - very cool, speakeasy vibe that somehow still feels like an upscale steakhouse. The service is excellent, the drinks are awesome, but the best part is the food - it's really outstanding. It's not inexpensive, but worth a visit for a special occasion. Reservations fill up fast, so make sure to plan far in advance, especially for a weekend. One of the best steakhouses in Chicago."
"This place is phenomenal! We had a 7:30pm reservation on Wednesday night and got there a little early so proceeded to the bar for a drink. The bartender was nice and super knowledgeable on drinks and gave us some good recommendations based on what we like.   At exactly 7:30 we were greeted by the hostess and were seated.  We started our meal with 6 oysters, 3 east coast and 3 west coast.  The oysters were fresh and were just great!  For our actual meals, i had the 16oz ribeye medium well and my friend had the flat iron steak.  We ordered some mashed potatoes and thick cut bacon to share.  The ribeye was cooked closer to medium then medium well but I have no complaints on this.  The steak was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.  I can see why people on here say it seems more rare the way they cook it versus what is asked but it makes sense.  The steak would loose the juiciness and perfection if it was cooked any other way.  By the time dessert rolled around, we were too full to keep going but did have leftovers for the following day."
"Another awesome meal at Bavette's. This is probably my favorite steakhouse in Chicago. The ribeyes are Stupid Good. Service was much better this time, and their corkage policy is awesome! We brought a big, fancy bottle and delighted in sending a glass over to a fellow diner. Don't get the cheesecake. Double down on the magic crack dessert, you won't be disappointed."
"The staff was amazingly friendly from beginning to end. Our server was very attentive without being overbearing.I had the Chicago cut ribeye, and it was cooked exactly the way I wanted. The GF had the short rib stroganoff and she enjoyed it as well. The crab cake appetizer was great, and a side of fries was all we needed.The atmosphere was amazing. A low light setting with appropriate music that was not too loud really made it a night to remember. This place is a must go back for the both of us."
"From the dimly lit space, to the 'parlor' seating area downstairs, to the superb food, to the animated bar area on ground level that has spacious booths just across... Bavette's is excellent! It's one of those spots that makes for either a great dinner scene, or a nice, tranquil wine-bar scene. The check-in area is separate from the dining room: nice!Salmon tartare: 5/5Waldorf Salad: 5/5Traditional filet mignon with roasted garlic and mushrooms: Excellent! 5/5Service: 5/5"
"The food here was absolutely spectacular! The first time I ever really had lobster that wasn't served in mac and cheese, between two buns, or at a casino buffet. I live a classy life, I know.We ordered:- Steak.. forgot which one exactly. My cute ass boyfriend is the steak expert. I'll eat any kind and still think it's good, but meat isn't really my thing.- Chilled lobster, which was so freaking delicious I almost cried- Elote style corn, which was so freaking delicious I almost peed- Loaded baked potato- Broccoli- Cabernet Sauvignon for me.. forgot what my cute ass boyfriend had but it was a red and we both liked itThe ambience was dark and old school, like the kind of restaurants you see in Prohibition-era gangster movies.The service was kind of cold, which is a little surprising coming from a restaurant with such amazing/expensive food. I didn't even care though, honestly. Our dinner was just that good."
"After getting some recommendations, I recently took a friend here for her birthday without any real idea of what we were in for. It turned out to be one of the best and most enjoyable meals I've ever had.We arrived fifteen minutes early for our reservation on Thursday night. The pleasant hostess got us a table immediately, so I was pleased with Bavette's right out of the gate; it only got better and better.The service is unbelievable and the food is stupefying. We started off with the Foie Gras Terrine which was absolutely amazing. She had the Steak Frites and I had the 6oz Filet Mignon - both were perfectly cooked and flavored to perfection. Serious,  my-eyes-rolled-back-in-my-skull, perfection. It's only been a few days since and I'm already trying to figure out an excuse to go back. Even the table bread and butter is great.I feel compelled to further highlight the staff at Bavette's. My friend has Celiac disease - so she cannot eat gluten. The Foie Gras was served with slices of delicious toast - which was great for me, but not so much for her. When asked for an alternate option for my friend, our fantastic waiter talked with the chef and brought her a plate of apple and carrot slices. It was perfect and very much appreciated. All of the staff were friendly, helpful and attentive.Wonderful staff and food that tastes better than it has any right to. Stop thinking about it and make your reservations."
"Made reservation so no waiting at all.  We like the dark lighting, the spacious seating and the many booths. It has a steak house feel, but updated compared to many chicago steak houses.  Love love love the food and feel!  Great date atmosphere to celebrate a birthday!  Cocktails are better than average, with nice large ice cubes.  The server is competent but relaxed. We got oysters and the bacon roasted tomatoes to start, the star here is definitely those meaty tasty bacon.  Then we splurged for the $56 dry aged ribeye, 24oz steak.  The steak is completely worth it.  If you have two people who wants steak, just go for it.  The dry age and bone makes a huge difference in taste.  Also got three sides to share, butternut squash, frites and elote corn that everyone raves about.  Sides were great and it's a good way to try a bunch of things with your eating mates! We were too full for dessert, I don't know how anyone can get to the desserts.  So next time."
"Ok what can I say? First, born in chicago, lived in the chicago loop for decades, seen all the steak places I ever want to see.But not this one-- why? First, their salmon tartar out of this world. The roasted tomatoe salad good. But the foie gras terrine was beyond belief. The berry sauce was ethereal.The steaks A fillet and ribeye both rocked. The sweet potato is like eating candy."
"I spent 2013-2014 living in Chicago. This was my number one spot. Amazing atmosphere, great service and the excellent food of course... From stakes to seafood and from starters to deserts (lemon pie!) you can't go wrong there! Oh. And don't forget to bring a bottle of wine. They have BYOB every night! The only ""corkage fee"" charged is one glass of your wine that you're expected to share with one of the other dinners at the restaurant (outside your table obviously). I find it adorable!"
"A go to place for me when I am in Chicago. Dark, trendy Vibe / interior. I like it. Staff are flirty and friendly. Music is unobtrusive and jazz based mostly. Wine list is good and there is a mix of continents to choose from. Steak is very good here, but the Lamb or Pork chops are my favorite. Very delicious on a cold night. Worth a visit."
My FAVORITE steak place in Chicago!  You walk into this place and you are transported into another world.  The atmosphere is upbeat with very ornate decorations.I had the filet and we shared several sides.  The corn was really interesting and different.  The pomme frites were delicious.This is a great place for a special occasion.
"Two years ago I dined here for my birthday and was blown away by the service, ambiance, food and overall attention to detail. I decided I wanted to feel that special again so I made reservations for my birthday this past weekend, but sadly...all the feelings I had before were replaced with confusion, annoyance, and disappointment.  We arrived right on time for our 6:45 reservation and were told they were running behind and to grab a drink at the bar.  The upstairs bar was packed so we went downstairs.  We felt like we were in the way of the wait staff and other diners and generally made to feel awkward.  We finally got our drinks and took them upstairs to wait for our table near the door.  We should have just stayed there, it was the only place in the restaurant where I didn't feel like I was in someone's way.  When we were finally seated our waiter asked who's birthday it was, I uncomfortably said it was mine and this was after the host that checked us in asked the same question.  I feel like if this question is going to be asked to the diners face, it should only be asked once because it makes for another awkward situation.  My husband and I ordered the smoked trout caesar salad, classic ribeye, and pommes frites to share.  The salad and steak were great but the fries were underfried so just blah.  We finished our meal with a delicious piece of lemon meringue pie but as the table next to ours who was also celebrating a birthday received a candle and special presentation, ours was delivered with hastiness and no mention of my birthday.  I just feel that if you're going to ask who's birthday it is, the least you can do is make an effort with the dessert, especially if others are receiving special treatment!Overall, I was just bummed that it wasn't as special of an experience as the last time.  After a while, all of the Sodikoff restaurants start feeling the same and the food starts to blend.  For the price, I was just expecting a lot more..."
"Brought my husband here for his birthday because he is a lover of steak houses.  I find them kind of boring, unless of course, you can find a really good one.  Look no further.  This place is f*%$ing amazing.  We were seated in the parlor, which is downstairs, and very romantic and intimate. It's very dimly lit but it made for a nice ambiance.We decided that we were going to split everything since we wanted to order way to much... So we got the king crab tower, prime aged bone in rib eye, and the corn elote.  Crab tower was one of the best I have had anywhere, succulent huge pieces of crab and great fresh oysters.  Next we split the steak which was the perfect amount for both of us.  Absolutely delicious, definitely a top 5 steak for me so far.  The corn, even though it seems strangely out of place on the menu, is rich, buttery and flavorful.  Definitely a new favorite!"
Bavette's wasn't going to get a good review at first. Prior to getting our table we bellied up to the bar for a handcraft cocktail. After some time waiting the bartender finally took my drink order... and then made someone else's drink prior to mine. At last we had a table and we ordered the goat cheese appetizer. It was good but I l prefer it a little more creamy. For dinner I ordered the shortrib stroganoff which was delicious. A friend ordered the steak frites which I tasted and liked. The hand cut fries were amazing! We also got a side of the broccoli. I wish I knew how to prepare broccoli at home like that!
"Bavette's blew us out of the water tonight!  There was not a single thing we did not enjoy, between the ambiance and the food, everything was perfect. The BYO policy is awesome, bring your own bottle but you need to share a glass with a table around you, no problem, enjoy!  We started with east coast oysters, then had the baked goat cheese which came out piping hot with the best seasoned Texas toast ever!  I had the filet mignon and my hubs had the pork chop, my steak was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The potatoes and corn paired perfectly with our meal. The whiskey ice cream with fudge was to die for!  There's a cute basement lounge you can enjoy as well. Benjamin rocked as our server, thanks for your recommendations and advice.  Amazing, can't wait to come back!!"
"""Disappointed"" by Morrissey started going through my head by mid meal...After waiting several months for a reservations my friends and I finally got one at 5pm. Bavette's is VERY dark inside so feel free to bring an ugly date if need be. Excellent jazz music accompanies the supper club of the 1950's or '20's?Our waiter was fun, young, professional and knowledgeable. He didn't flinch when I sent the first bottle of wine back.But it was sadly the food where the disappointment lies:- Baked Crab Cake: not lump meat but very finely shredded so it was a mushy texture. The crab taste was overpowered by sharp horseradish or mustard or something. First time my friends and I encouraged each other to finish it.- Bacon Roasted Tomato Salad: hot sliced tomatoes on the bottom with lots of bacon grease, then some strips of bacon that were very hard to chew, and the cold watercress on top. Components weren't mix well so they didn't integrate well. After you took a but of each, you then kind of had to make your own salad on your side plate. No one fought over who got the remains.- Ribeye Steak: tougher than a New York Strip steak. Lot's of inedible edges of the steak But the worst was the long gristle running through the semi-center of the steak. I had enough discoveries. I kept trying to flag our waiter down but he was working hard. I was pretty much full by the time he came over. I pointed out the problem and he took the plate back to the kitchen in a flash and brought me another steak within 5 - 10 minutes. I would've preferred to have it removed from the bill rather than a new one - I wish he asked. I took the steak home but the reason why you come to a steakhouse is to enjoy the whole experience.Maybe I'll come back for the fried chicken."
"I don't often give reviews, but this place deserves 5+ stars. Great service, cool cellar like room downstairs, upscale but casual. The steaks were incredible, the best I've ever had. I tried the bone in aged ribeye and it was perfect. Highly recommended!"
The best steakhouse in Chicago...hands down!  Try the bone marrow.  It will blow your mind and tastebuds!
"Came here for our first ""good meal"" out and double date for 2014. It was cold and snowy, but we had these reservations for months so I was excited.  It was packed and def a happening spot - nice décor and sexy lighting.  The tables are little too close together for my liking though.The food was good, but pricey for what you get.  My filet was cooked well, but nothing mind-blowing.  Hubby's bone-in prime rib was delish!!  We killed our entrees.  (the other couple had leftovers - whaaat!).  The crabcake to start left much to be desired - especially since I compare all crab cakes to delfrescos.  Crab and avocado salad was good and fresh.  Dessert was ice cream with a hard fudge shell over - pretty cool with presentation and pretty standard with taste. Cocktails were great tho!Overall, I would give this place more of a 3.75 rating, but will round up for good measure since the food was delish, atmosphere fun and we had a good time.  Will we make it back? Probably.  But regulars? Probably not."
"Came here for an anniversary dinner and boy did it deliver. Bavette's atmosphere is that of a laid back bar/lounge but the ambiance is quite acceptable for a low-key romantic evening as well. On to the food!We got the salmon tartare to start which was seasoned well and served on tortilla chip. Nothing special but was still yummy 4/5The dry aged ribeye...A 60 dollar steak (22 oz) made me skeptical but I thought what the heck why not try the best Bavette's has to offer? The result was the best steak I have had in my life. The outside was seared and had a lot of smoky flavor and the inside simply melted in your mouth. The sauce it comes with was a good companion and so was the steak salt. For toppers we got the mushrooms which were ok but a little too pricey for my taste. 5/5 Desert was a ""chicago"" style cheesecake which was super thick but the flavor was nice. Served with fresh cream and a raspberry compote. 3/5/5Drinks we had some wine and a cocktail both above average.Come here for great atmosphere, service, and the best steak ever!"
"Well, from all the great reviews I expected to have a great meal. Sounds like we had the one out of one-hundred duds! Everything we ordered was great, except the star attraction...our $38 petite filet! It was gristly and chewy...I actually chewed a few pieces 5 or 6 times and then deposited the rubbery remains on my plate. As I said, most of you never had this experience.. Why did both my wife and I have it??? I am not one to complain in the restaurant (maybe I should), I just don't go back. A $38 cut of meat should melt in your mouth...a cut from Jewel would have been better...they wouldn't have given us two old folks, who have not been here before, and maybe aren't likely to come back 2 bad cuts of meat on purpose, would they??? I don't think so, BUT?? Sorry, but this is what we experienced...hope it is a very rare exception, as many reviews seem to attest...how could both filets have been this bad???  Ricoklaus@comcast.net"
"Holy cow.  Literally.  Yummmm.I'm a pescetarian.  I swear.  I don't eat meat.It was my brother's 30th birthday and we came here with him telling me that this was the best ever and I had to come and there were options for me.  I caved.  We ordered a ton.Oysters, baked goat cheese, salmon tartare.  We also ordered a filet mignon and a prime rib.  My brother convinced me to try it, and I ended up eating half of that filet.  It was very very very good.  We also got the corn (holy $hit) and mushrooms.  The cocktails were perfect.  The service was also wonderful.  I highly highly recommend.  These folks take their craft seriously."
"Really 2.5 stars. Once again I have to go against the grain. My tip, go next door to Gilt, they even share a similar specialty drink menu. I had the dark and stormy before I walked over to Bavette's. And, alas it was downhill after. The only things worth eating here are the chocolate pie dessert and the crispy warm doughy bread they bring to the table. And the drinks. What happened? The rest is acceptable such as the Ceasar salad with smoked fish and the shrimp app. The real fail here was the bone in Delmonico Strip and Filet!!! The pomme frites just blah. There is a funky weird flavoring to this meat that just pretty much ruined it. I've never had this taste nor tasted it on any meat, and guess what? After dessert and another drink, it was still there. Just not good. Like the service. I tipped the runner because I saw my waiter twice. Both times to place drink/dinner orders and it was not because they were busy, or for lack of trying. Stating the obvious here, there are great steak restos all over Chicago that I've been so why return? This place is part of the same restaurant group as Maude's, Gilt and Au Chavel and I've had great meals in all three, and once a very long time ago here. Granted, I didn't order the same thing then as I did last night, but wow was I disappointed! In all they took really good cuts of meat and ruined them with some strange concoction of flavors that were awful. I know after you've had great steak it's hard to distinguish what's best but this didn't even reach that level! My entree which should have been the highlight was a complete failure and the waiter service was nonexistent, I mean nil. Just wow."
"I ordered the $26 flat iron steak frites, excepting slightly less quality due to its affordability. However I could not have been more incorrect. One of the best steaks I've ever had: so flavorful and tender, it tasted more like filet mignon compared to other flat irons I'd eaten. The frites were delicious, the service was lovely and the atmosphere is dark and comfortable. I absolutely recommend eating here."
Great atmosphere and delicious food! Our waiter was very nice and attentive. He recommended to get the chicken which I did and I loved it. Also get the corn!! You won't regret it! It's delicious you'll want more! Only downside is you need to book your reservation about a month or so ahead of time but other than that overall amazing place and can't wait to go back!
"My husband and I went here for dinner and felt like it was slightly overrated. We had the goat cheese appetizer (pretty good) both got a salad- mistake they were huge! We tried the crab avocado which was really good and the trout caear which was also pretty good. For an entree we shared the bone in dry-aged ribeye which for $65 wasn't spectacular. It was pretty fatty even for a ribeye, and the bernaise sauce was just okay. We had the corn and pomme frite sides which were also just okay. We wished we would've skipped the Caesar, ribeye and sides and gotten crab. Chocolate pie dessert was good, service and atmosphere great- but for steak we would go somewhere else for the price."
"My girlfriends and I went for a ""girls night out dinner."". I have been to Bavette's before, and it never disappoints! As soon as you walk in, you are warmly greeted by the hostess and once you enter the actual dining area you would think that you were transported into a different era. The warm lighting and environment really adds to this place, and the service is top notch!  Every time I have been here, I am impressed at how knowledgeable the servers are (even sat at the downstairs lounge before)! And how attentive everyone is to the diners. Again, love love love their service!Now onto the food. My friends and I shares the Pommes Frites with Garlic Aioli, Elote Style Corn, and a salad (oops don't remember what it was called). For entree, I ordered the petit filet mignon. I also had the Bavette's Punch (outstanding! it is a little fruity and sweet which I like!). The steak was good, a little salty for me but I will have to try the others next time. But the Pommes frites and corn are awesome! I would return just for those items! We capped off dinner with malt whiskey gelato that comes with fudge served on the side. Delicious! It's hard to get a decent reservation (dinner at 7pm vs 9pm?) so make sure you book early using OpenTable. And when you go, just soak in and enjoy the atmosphere. The food is awesome there but the ambiance makes everything all the more enjoyable. I can't wait to go back!"
"Bavette's is what a Chicago steakhouse ""should be."" A classic, old-timey Chicago ambiance, that feels like a modern day version of a Mad Men episode. Big tables, dim lighting, strong drinks and hearty steaks. What more could you ask for?We popped in on a Monday night at 8:00 pm without a reservation and of course they were totally booked. We went downstairs to scout a pair of bar stools, and as lady luck would have it we snagged 2 seats after just a 20 minute wait.I ordered a manhattan, which was made with Rittenhouse rye and executed perfectly...the ideal way to start a steak dinner. We started off with the wedge salad, which came strongly recommended by our bartender. I normally never order a wedge salad. It just seems too passe and more suited for a diner than a fancy steakhouse, but she insisted that it was a staff favorite. She couldn't have been more right! Just a delicious half of fresh, crispy iceberg lettuce drizzled with plenty of blue cheese and loads of bacon. The bacon was thick and more like crispy pork belly than bacon bits. Oh yeah and to top it off they add a soft boiled egg!...a delightful way to start your meal. We also ordered the  bone marrow, which included three large bones and plenty of rich, delicious marrow accompanied by plenty of crispy toast. Our main was of course, the 22 oz Classic Chicago-cut Ribeye, which was a heaping cut of beef. My only complaint was that we ordered it rare, but to my chagrin it actually came out medium-rare to almost medium...quite a disappointing turn of events. We didn't send it back because it wasn't horrendously overcooked, but Bavette's loses a ""star"" for a their overcooked steak.Bavette's Bar & Boeuf is now one of my favorite steakhouses in Chicago. It doesn't have that stuffy, corporate feel that most steakhouses have. The staff here is very friendly and does a great job recommending dishes. Overall we had a great time and I would highly recommend Bavette's to out-of-towners, or locals looking for a steak that's not overrun with salesmen on expense accounts."
"Having been there a number of times now, I will just go ahead and say that Bavette's is my favorite restaurant on Earth. If I had to choose one place, and only one, to eat for the rest of my life, it would be Bavette's.Now, I'm not saying that this is the most innovative or unique establishment around. Far from it. What blows me away about Bavette's, though, is its versatility and its incredible, consistent, flawless execution in every possible aspect of the experience, from the moment you walk in the door until the second you leave. Different places may do different things, but I have never seen a restaurant that does what they choose to do as well as Bavette's does, day in and day out.My experiences have always been great from the start. Bavette's takes reservations, over the Internet, like civilized people. Coming from DC where everything is a line or a free-for-all you would think this is some revolutionary idea. And, they actually honor them, in my experience. No long waits at the bar or excuses about tables not being ready. Yet on the other side, when you're dining, they're not pushing to turn your table to get the next cover in. I don't know how they manage to do it.The service is fantastic. Knowledgeable, yet not show-offish. Never pushing for upsells, and treating every guest like a valued client. Attentive, but not disruptive. Hip and modern but with attention to the old-school details - placing silverware, clearing plates systematically, etc. Every item I have eaten here has been spot-on. They have the best starter bread I've every had. They somehow manage to keep the butter at literally 1 degree below its melting point, and it goes liquid the second it touches the bread. The iceberg wedge is worth it for the bacon alone, and the goat cheese appetizer is great for sharing. The steaks, from the hanger up to the regular and bone-in ribeyes, have been fantastic and perfectly cooked. The homestyle entrees are excellent, particularly the meatloaf. I've not tried any of the seafood dishes because...Chicago. As for sides, everyone has good reason to rave about the corn, and the creamed spinach and loaded potato are deserving of equal praise.You can take anyone here. I can't think of a situation that this place wouldn't work for. Date, client dinner, after a funeral, anything. Did I mention this place is versatile? You can sit at the bar and do a burger, fries, and a PBR for under $20 all-in, or shoot for the moon off the full menu and wine list.The only downside is that this place is preventing me from trying other restaurants in Chicago, because when I'm there, I head straight to it without a moment's thought otherwise."
"If you remember anything from this review, it should be this: bring your night vision goggles.Bavette's is an ultra dim restaurant.  The light from each table's candle makes you feel a little woozy and/or like you're on a cruise ship.  Or maybe it was that amazingly crusty-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside-freshly-­baked-and-piping-hot bread served pre-dinner that made us woozy.  Mmm mmm mmm.  Get your hands on some of that (and notice the breadshelf of loaves at the back of the restaurant awaiting to be served)!We left happy campers, my tummy full of porkchop a la mushrooms and K's tummy full of some juicy chicken.  I can't wait to come back to try some other menu offerings, including dessert!"
Outstanding in every way from service to food to presentation. A little pricey but worth it. Make reservations. Walk ins can be a mess if you get a table at all.
"I really loved everything about this meal! Service was on point and the food was outstanding.Starting with the bread-- so warm and perfectly baked. We got the whitefish Cesar salad which hands down stood out the most. This salad was incredible and you could taste every single ingredient from the anchovies to the lemon to the crispy potatoes. Our steak was cooked PERFECTLY. Better than Mastro's has done the last two times I've been. I usually don't like Bearnaise sauce, but I enjoyed this one. The elote style corn and the mashed potatoes were outstanding as well. I had never had corn with that preparation and it was delicious. The cheesecake with raspberry sauce was the perfect way to end a great meal.BYO policy!!! Just need to share a glass with someone in the restaurant :)"
"We received a gift certificate to Bavette's as a wedding gift, and I have to say...it was an AWESOME gift!  We started off with some oysters and some garlic shrimp.  They were so good that my wife actually enjoyed an oyster for the first time in her life.  The shrimps was so tasty, that we used the bread to mop up all of the great garlic sauce off the plate. I ordered the short rib stroganoff because I knew I wouldn't have room for the steak....since I really wanted to try the elotes and bacon as well.  Everything was delicious!  My wife had the crab stuff avocado salad, which she loved.  We will definitely be back, if we can get a reservation."
"Great service. The staff is very friendly and accommodating . The food is good. We had a huge variety, from appetizers of garlic shrimp & duck pate. They were very good! The white wine selection is limited, but we picked one that was lovely. For dinner we shared a few different dishes. Wedge salad, stroganoff, another pasta  dish that I don't remember and some oysters. Everything was good. The bread that is given with all the appetizers and before the meal is amazing. I could eat that bread all day! I would definitely go back .  It was a great experience"
"Bavette's is sultry and seductive. Glowing candle lights, leather, and wood are just some of the highlights waiting to envelope a person. But the delicious food will wrap you up and put you away in a very content place. If you're looking for a quiet, sensuous place to arouse your senses, this is it."
"Came here when they had their mock opening.  Everything from the service to the food was spectacular! The seafood tower is a must get!  The shrimp here is good and plump!  OMG and you have to try the soufflé!  (Ask for a table downstairs, it's like a speakeasy)."
"I visited Chicago over the weekend and knew I had to find a good ribeye while I was there. I'd have to say that the steak at Bavette's was pretty good. It's not the best I've had, but it wasn't anything to complain about.The restaurant itself has a great feel and the environment is nice. The service was the best part about this meal. From the hostess to the bartenders to the server, everything was top notch and professional. My friends stake came a bit too salty and they replaced it with no question. Overall, the meal was very good. I have since learned that the dish to order is the stroganoff. I hope to make it back one day to try that."
"In CHI from STL for a weekend getaway. Made reservations at Bavette's a month ago after some ""chicago steakhouses"" googling. We're well-traveled, experienced cooks, etc. This dining experience - in the basement parlor, speak-easy inspired  atmosphere - was one of the best of our lives.We had the dry-aged bone-in ribeye. Had to. It was outrageously perfect. So was the shrimp de jonghe we ordered to accompany. For starters, though, we had oysters, really great. Our server did a fab job describing the w. coast vs. e. coast types. We got a medley to experiment - yum.For sides, we did the creamed spinach and pommes frites. Nice bottle of wine, amazing classic cocktails at the bar before dinner - really, this place is extraordinary. Service, atmosphere, style, food, design, approach.  Awesome. We'll never forget it. Nothing missed."
"Seriously the best meal ever, especially on my bday. I had the petite filet for dinner, perfect! Garlic mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, bone marrow, and duck terrine. Best meal ever! ""Only the best for us"" quoted by my hubby! And it sure was the best!"
"Ok so we just left. Here's what happened: my halibut came out a little undercooked - still so delicious that I was ready to eat the whole thing anyway, but my cautious hubby thought we should send it back for a little more time in the oven. Our server, Amy, was amazing and handled it like a pro: new piece halibut cooked to perfection plus a side of delicious broccoli for the trouble. When we get the bill, BOTH ENTREES HAD BEEN COMPED!!! Outstanding service. Just another reason why this is our favorite restaurant in Chicago."
"Bavette's is a special restaurant for special occasions.  Everything my wife and I ate was delicious, but two staple items were the best I have ever tasted of their kind:  the sourdough bread and the bacon.The sourdough bread was perfect--better than any I've had in San Francisco or anywhere else.  It was extraordinarily crusty with a hot soft interior.  The house-made thick cut bacon was TO DIE FOR.  Do not dine at Bavette's without enjoying these two bits of heaven.Also delicious were the short rib stroganoff, meatloaf, elote style corn, and gin cocktails.Go to Bavette's Bar and Boeuf for a memorable meal.  Trust me."
"I had zero issues with Bavettes! We got seated right on time for our reservation at 5:30. The service was excellent, the food was even better! I would recommend this place to anyone!"
"We were very unimpressed by Bavette. My fiancé is a meat & potatoes kind of guy, so I always make reservations at a nice steakhouse when we travel. I read so many positive reviews that I made reservations right away for the night we arrived.We were seated about 10 minutes after our reservation, which was fine. But then it took a half hour for us to get drinks. The best part of my meal was the cocktail (Lillet Rose Martini...delicious).I ordered the petite 6 oz filet and my fiancé had to 10 oz filet. There is no chance that there was a 4 oz difference between them. They came out almost too quickly - within 15 mins of ordering. Also, my filet was not cooked evenly. I requested that my filet was prepared medium, although most of it was medium-well. We ordered two sides: mashed potatoes and corn. The mashed potatoes were served with gravy and didn't have much flavor. The corn had the opposite problem. It was over seasoned, to the point that you could hardly taste the corn.The ambiance was completely unoriginal. Besides the chandeliers, there was nothing interesting or modern about the decor.Maybe we went on a bad night, but between the bad decor, service and food, we definitely wouldn't go back to Bavette."
"Went to Bavette's w/ some old friends for a fabulous meal.  Had a reservation at the Chicago Chop House but got nervous after reading some bad reviews and decided to cancel and try to get into Bavette's.  No reservation but we called and they said they do accept walk-ins.  So we walked in at 5:30 and sat in bar until they could seat us-about an hour +.  We ended up being seated downstairs in a big cozy booth. The atmosphere down there was really cool w/ dim lights, jazz, & speakeasy style. Started w/ a seafood tower as appetizer...amazing w/ crab, shrimp, oysters & salmon ceviche.  Blue cheese wedge salad was the best I have ever had w/ a hint of dill in the dressing and pork belly bacon, delicious. Mashed potatoes w/ garlic so good, as was creamed spinach.  All steaks cooked to perfection including, dry aged  bone-in Ribeye & bone-in filet.  Finished w/ a pot of French press coffee & chocolate pie.  The best meal."
"Came here in late December and thought things were still pretty good...filet tasted a little too charred for my liking... almost Pittsburgh style.  I'm not one to send food back so I still ate it, just worth noting. We had creamed spinach and oysters and a few other things that I can't quite remember, a feast nonetheless.  My husband ordered the Jameson and pickle juice back and enjoyed.  Looking forward to our next visit."
"I made reservations based on yelp reviews and the high ratings. Very classy establishment with great service. We ordered the 24 oz prime dry aged ribeye. It was a bit charred and burnt. Even with dim lighting I can tell. Worse. I can taste it. I spit it out. I've been to quite a few steak houses and this is by far the worse. I tried so hard to eat my $56 steak. The more I chew, the more I hated it. It was over cooked and dry. I was disappointed."
"So excited about returning to Bavette's this sat. night, we love it! The ambiance is so sexy and the food is amazing! I order the same things every time, maybe it's time to branch out, but I'm addicted to that wedge w/ the huge slice of BACON!!! the Chicken is so juicy and flavorful then the grilled broccoli, yummy! The chocolate mouse cake is probably the best desert I have ever had, it is heaven! The only thing I would change is the fact they are always booked, my husband and I never leave without making a reservation. We usually have to wait 90 days, but that's good enough for me, also, make sure you sit upstairs, the basement kind of feels like a basement.Otherwise, bavette is my top 5 in the city! I think their sister restaurant is also in my top 5, love Gilt Bar too!"
"Hip and with it. Cozy dive bar meets steakhouse.Coming here with friends is a plus because I got to sneak my fork into so many more dishes. The duck terrine is excellent. Everything else isn't bad, but no out-of-the-ballpark home hitters. The fried chicken is particularly ho-hum.But it's a fun ambiance, so we'll likely be back if we can snag another reservation."
"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner at Bavette's last night. We arrived just in time for our 5pm reservation and were sat at a two top along the banquet. Our server approached us within a few minutes. Perfect timing. It gave us enough time to look over the drink menu and decide on cocktails. My husband ordered a Weller 107 old fashioned and I had a congnac sazerac. Both drinks were perfect.  Our server came back with our drinks and gave us a quick overview of the menu, letting us know that the portions are generous. We ordered one salad, one entree, and one side... and it was plenty of food. The wedge salad was massive with two giant pieces of bacon, hard boiled eggs, ranch dressing, fresh dill, and chopped red onion. It was wonderfully flavored and plenty for the two of us. We also shared the short rib stroganoff and a side of brussels sprouts. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. The short rib was flavorful, however, some of the pieces were more like dried out stew meat. Not all melty and decadent as short rib normally is. Overall the dish was delicious but it could've been more so. The side of brussels sprouts were served with bacon and a rich horseradish creme fraiche sauce. They were cooked perfectly.  For dessert, we ordered and shared a small french press of coffee and the chocolate cream pie. Both items were rich beyond imagination. The chocolate cream was dense and not ridiculously sweet. Absolutely lovely. We couldn't finish it and brought the rest home. We didn't find it ridiculously pricey. $13 cocktails, instead of $10-12 at other places. $10 dessert, instead of $7. Between the atmosphere, service, and most of the food, we had a wonderful time and would go back again."
"Most importantly, the wait staff was fantastic. Probably some of the best we've ever experienced. Water was refilled, things were brought out in a well orchestrated manner, absolutely excellent. On the other hand, the experience was kind of ""meh.""Don't you dare try bringing more than six people - they CAN NOT accommodate!I made a reservation on OpenTable for 6 people on a Tuesday night. This is the first time one of those needed a credit card, which I provided. Fine. A couple of hours beforehand, we needed to add one more person - this was a business dinner. I called and, in a nutshell, they said no. I understand this is inconvenient for them, but in thousands of trips to restaurants worldwide, I have never had one deny such a request.I was told that our table could only seat six people. Isn't it round or rectangular? We'll squeeze one more. No, it's a ""half moon booth."" I spoke to the manager, too, who suggested I simply blame the restaurant and uninvite the seventh. Really!? Figured we'd try anyway.At the restaurant they showed us two booths (and we certainly appreciated their attempt), across from each other. That wouldn't work. There were lots and lots of empty tables, including downstairs. Can't we just move two together? Again, no! Wha? Ok, maybe 2-3 inches closer, but definitely not together. Wow, again, never heard of this before. Someone canceled and we got two ""half moon booths"" next to each other. Fine, we'll survive.The seafood towers we got were phenomenal. Two types of oysters (West Coast and East Coast) were great, as were the crab claws, shrimp, and other seafood delicacies.We ordered steaks. My Chicago Cut Ribeye had quite a bit of gristle on it, and was a little under done. Again, fine, I'll survive, but for $60 there are much, much better steak options all around. Others' filets seemed decent.Drinks were unique, strong, and excellent. Probably the best drinks I've had.In summary, go here for a great drink/bar-type atmosphere, but eat elsewhere."
"BEST STEAK YET.  VERY ROMANTIC ATMOSPHERE. Cool, relaxed vibe, not stuffy at all.  Had a question about the Marrow side. Chef Darren came out to explain how he cooks it. Really nice.  And of equal importance - our Waiter Brandon. Such a warm, kind, professional, efficient person/waiter - Bavette's finest.  Be sure to ask for him - he made the whole evening very special. We thought Brandon and Darren were actors because they were so handsome. They gave us permission to post their pic."
"I love this place. Our bartender, Katherine, was a doll. She helped me through my silly and annoying dietary restrictions. Her wine pairings were spot on. My boyfriend ordered the Au Chevaul burger and was in heaven. Our go to date spot for sure!!"
"So happy that we came here for Valentine's day as we had an awesome time. Had a 7pm reservation but got there at 6:30 and they totally accommodated us. The hostess and server was very nice and knowledgeable of all the menu items so that is always a plus. The atmosphere was perfect for a romantic dinner with brick walls, smooth wooden tables, leather booths, gorgeous chandeliers, candles around the place, very romantic vibe but could also be perfect for a girls night out. The ambiance alone won us over with great service. The food was just an added bonus and here is what we got:-The sourdough bread with butter! Warning: You cannot just have one slice it is that good, one of the best I've had, better than in San Francisco. Outstanding.-Endive, apple and honey salad with candied almonds-so refreshing, not overwhelming with dressing, very great start.-Corn Elote-we had to ask our server what was in it because our taste buds alone could not figure it out, it was the BEST corn I've ever had in my life. It had some siracho alioli, parmesian cheese, smooth, creamy, ahhhh-mayzing. -Creamy spinach with goat cheese and I think it had mushrooms in it as well- it was definitely tasty for me to try, but my husband ate all of it, as he kept layering it on top of that incredible sourdough bread that I had a dream of last night.-Short Rib Stroganoff-caramelized cremini mushrooms, hand cut pappardelle, I thought the meat was so tender and a little sweet, perfection. However, my husband felt that the pasta itself was a tad under cooked and not as soft as he would have wanted it. But overall, a must try here!-Chocolate Cream Pie-BEST THING I'VE EVER EATEN. Wow, it was amazing, rich, chocolately, perfection topped with some whipped cream to balance all the richness. You must order this here! It was also a a generous portion, easily to be shared with 4 people but nope, the two of us stuffed it in our fat a$$es. Overall, amazing restaurant, exceptional service, generous portions and prices. And another bonus of this place is that they have byob where you have to share one glass of your bottle with another table. How unique?! Love it and LOVEE Bavette's."
My family came to visit from out of town and I wanted to take them somewhere special.  There were six of us and we each ordered something different so we could sample each others. The dry aged rib eye was cooked to perfection and one of the best steaks I ever had. The beef stroganoff with mushrooms was amazing as was the meatloaf and the sides of mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes.  The service was excellent and they seated us right away at 5 pm on a Saturday night without reservations. Definitely the best meal I ever had and now my favorite steakhouse in Chicago jumping ahead of Chicago Cut which was my favorite for 4 years. The ambience was perfect and my only regret was not having room for desert.
"Had an amazing dinner again tonight at Bavette's ,however the remarkable thing is how they handled a "" mistake"". Management dealt with it professionally, sincerely and with integrity."
Went on a double date and had a great time. The decor and the lighting are totally grown up. The prices were very decent for a higher end place. The server was extremely nice and knowledgeable and our steaks were right on. Don't leave workout dessert!
The best restaurant on Earth.Not even close.
"Yes the food is lovely.Yes the attitude is gratuitous.Sad - the space ls lovely very NYC meatpacking 2001 but lovely none the less.The staff, oh golly - if you think you're beautiful you should prolly be beautiful...just saying.Sazerac - well it's got nothing on the Miami's Yard Bird Sazerac - just saying.Did I mention the corporate chained ""have you been here before let me tell you about menu, "" dialogue is trite and unromantic....Anyway - the food is TOO DIE FABULOUS. Not gonna lie - but I am hoping they have take-a-way because I can't deal with the sassy 16 years olds running around posing as 2004 art school divas cum front end staff for 2001 NYC concept knock-off.oooh corporate feel restaurants always make me feel dirty.Ps. I am so confused about it being a ""Steakhouse."" NO"
"Unbeknownst to me, the day I decided to try this place out also happened to be Valentines day.  As you may have guessed reservations cannibalized all seating until after 9 P.M. So I decided to sit by the bar, which has a pretty warm and welcoming appearance.  I had recently separated from my significant other, so I was pretty uncomfortable sandwiched in between 6 couples celebrating the dumbest holiday ever created.  As I sat on my thirteenth wheel throne, I was greeted by one of the bartenders who graciously handed me a menu. Problem is, she followed that by asking me ""are you waiting for someone or dining alone?"" Of course I am dining alone, I am sitting in the middle of the bar with no open seats to my left or right and I am the only male in this entire establishment not wearing a button up shirt.  At this point I am pretty paranoid that people are staring at the back of my head, either feeling sorry for me or making themselves feel better by judging my current romantic station. Quickly, I ordered a Tequila on the rocks, followed by another within a minute or two.  It is not that I have forgotten about the eyes in the room, rather, I have come to terms that they will follow where I go, as they always in my life, scrutinizing my lack of charm or behavior found appealing to the opposite sex.  I ordered a medium rare Chicago rib eye and a side of creamed spinach.  The steak was cooked to specification and was rested before a waiter brought it out.  The creamed spinach was very good, definitely in my top 3 of the same offering from Chicago steakhouses.  The portions of the sides were definitely for two, so be wary about ordering with your eyes.  They have an additional bar with booth and table seating on the lower level.  If you do not have reservations, it is probably best to show up before 6:30 or after 9 as the restaurants location and food is prime."
"Walked into the place on time and was seated immediately. Our jackets were taken which was good. The place has a nice vibe about it. You feel really relaxed in here. Must be a combination of the Jazz music and the best Manhattan I have ever had caressing my lips. Wow, can they make a drink. Our party of 4 started off with a dozen oysters mixed between east and west coast. I would always get east coast Maine oysters if it were up to me. West coasters just make me think of Fukushima. East Coasters were perfect and served with horseradish as I like it. They have good bread and butter here too which is important. We got an order of the thick cut bacon and that was really good. I saved some of that to mix with my mashed potatoes. Bacon and mash go real good together. For the Main course, I went with the Daddy of them all, the bone in ribeye. I honestly don't think I have had a better cut of meat. I like my steak medium and at medium you still didn't have to cut the meat at all. The knife just went right through the meat. I was in food and drink lovers heaven. I had a couple of manhattans and a Lagunitas Sumpin Sumpin after dinner. It really was top notch. I want to get back here soon. Their desserts look really good but I always fill myself up and don't get the chance to try them. So glad to have discovered this place."
"I still can't get over how incredible this place was. The food was off the charts. The quality and the service was so high level, that it's worth the wait.Their pork chop might have been the greatest pork chop I've ever had. The sides of the elotes, hashbrowns, and bacon kicked so much ass. The drinks, service, the food, I honestly can't say enough great things about Bavettes"
"Was here last evening for a late Mother's Day dinner I was very looking forward to. I had made the reservations 6 weeks ago while still in Florida. I did get a reminder call and was assured that the  ""downstairs"" room I had requested (not open on Sunday's) was on the reservation. WELL... We were taken in on time and seated but it ends up we were in the main dining room. The tables for two are close together but not quite as close as other Chicago steakhouses where you can really pick up your dinning mates conversation. Not until we had ordered and I had taken a trip to the ladies room was it that I realized where this ""downstairs"" was. Alert: while waiting for the ladies room...as there is only one...did I notice the stairwell in the back of the restaurant leading the the much more quiet and relaxed downstairs. AND where were all these five star servers??? Ours was good but not as the other described five star ones...had to look for him to order second drinks, ask for water to be refreshed...the béarnaise sauce did not go home with the steak leftovers. We did ask for a fresh one since at this place the béarnaise sauce is NOT uncharged...got a fresh butter instead! ...I'll give him a plus for refolding the napkin when I left the table.As for the meal the bloggers where right on for the rose martini and the mojito  had a tasty twist to it. My son's steak was overdone and easily sent back. The manager came to the table to check up on the replacement steak ( wish I had noticed the seating arrangements by then). I did appreciate the way the asparagus was actually cooked through. A piece of chocolate pie comped for the overdone steak and yes go and try the whiskey ice cream.When we left I mentioned to the hostesses about the blunder in the seating arrangements and my disappointment of waiting so long to only be in the main room. Their reply ""oh"". Whenever you're in Tampa go to Bern's were steak is steak and service is still superb."
"We had a wonderful experience at Bavette's. We were seated in the downstairs parlor, I wasn't sure what to expect but it was an even cooler vibe than the upstairs area. Very romantic, great atmosphere and excellent service. Everything we ate was unbelievable. Recommended choices:Smoked whitefish caesar- Who knew a salad could blow your mind like this? Amazing.Grilled broccoli- AmazingTraditional Filet Mignon- My husband had this as his entrée and said it was the best steak he's had in the city in a long time. Grand Tower- I had a half order of the grand tower as my entrée. I was so  happy to have this option because I really wanted seafood but my husband didn't want to share with me. The presentation and flavors were amazing.Bavette's was quite pricey- $230 for all that food plus probably 3-4 drinks, but if you are planning to treat yourself, defnitely worth it!"
"Second time dining here since it opened. Love the food but find the whole reservation process frustrating. I can not count the number of times that tables are only available before 6 or after 930. Or, I am offered the opportunity to go on a 1 1/2 hour wait list. No thanks.So we try calling last night at 630 and are told nobody waiting. We live in the neighborhood so we arrive and are seated in the bar. Nice but not quite as nice as the nearby open tables. Nope- those are saved for ""reservations"". Okay, I get it. Create a sense of scarcity and people will value the experience even more.Loved the food and service."
"I love a good, well made drink and my drink of choice is a Sidecar.  I came for dinner and had a fabulous time at the bar/lounge downstairs.  The setting is very intimate and cute with leather couches and lots of booths.  The bar is staffed by mixologists, well skilled at making great drinks.  I had the porkchop and my friend had the fried chicken.  We shared an order of the brussel sprouts.  The porkchop was massive and delicious.  For such a big cut of meat it was perfectly cooked, moist and juicy and well seasoned.  My friend's fried chicken was good, but not great.  The mixologist really talked up the fried chicken, so we were both disappointed when it was good, but not amazing.  He also recommended the brussel sprouts for the veggies and said his mom said they were the best she's ever had.  They weren't, in fact, they were the only thing about the restaurant that was bad.  They weren't roasted or tossed with bacon bits, as I expected.  Instead they were drenched in this cream-based sauce, which just made the sprouts slimey and mushy.  Sad.  Our mixologist was absolutely excellent and attentive and it was so fun to people watch while sitting at the bar.  I recommend this place for intimate dates and small group dinners.  It is pricey, but well worth the expense.  I'll be back."
"It's official...I've found my new favorite Chicago restaurant!  Not even just my favorite Chicago restaurant, my favorite anywhere restaurant!  Bavette's Bar & Boeuf in River North is so gorgeous, so chic, so intimate, so PERFECT!  Any restaurant that can make stroganoff sexy is a winner in my book!Brendan Sodikoff has done it again, adding another notch on his belt of culinary achievements that also includes Gilt Bar, Curio, Maude's, Doughnut Vault, and Au Cheval.  Bavette's, with its dim lighting, dark wood, crystal chandeliers, and expertly crafted throwback cocktails, offers the perfect twist to the traditional steakhouse.This is the perfect spot for a special date, an intimate dinner with family or friends, or a just quick cocktail before a night on the town.  With a drink menu that includes sparkling cocktails (M Laurent is my fav!), old fashioneds (go with the hardy vs cognac), thoughtful classics (thoroughly enjoyed Bavette's Punch), perfect wines (the Sangiovese pairs perfect with the short rib stroganoff), and an expansive selection of scotch, whiskey, and bourbon, they've got a little something for everyone!  If you can't choose, their fantastic bartenders can undoubtedly steer you in the right direction!Now those were just the drinks!  Every bite of food we ate, from the warm, chewy sourdough bread to the crunchy hash browns with caramelized onions, was absolutely delicious.  We started with a classic that actually originated in Chicago-the Shrimp DeJonghe.  Butter, garlic, shrimp, a touch of sherry, and texas toast?  Heaven!  Make sure you use that toast to sop of every last bit!For our mains, I opted for the Short Rib Stroganoff and my fiancé went with the Filet Mignon Petite Duchess Cut.  The stroganoff was amazingly rich and creamy with chunks of short rib that just melted in my mouth.  I would order this again, and again, and again!  Mike's filet...serious perfection.  The thick cut of meat was a perfect medium rare all the way through.  I don't even know how you go about cooking such a thick cut like that!For sides we went with our bartender's suggestions of the hash browns and the elote style corn.  I'm not really sure how elote style corn fits into this menu but I don't really care, it was delicious!  The hash browns are a must-order, I can assure you that you've never had hash browns like these before.Although I would've loved to try their desserts, we were way too stuffed to even think about it, and we even brought a good amount of food home!  Reservations are scarce so we just strolled in without one at 6pm on a Friday night and ended up snagging a couple seats at the bar.  They put us on their wait list but by the time we left around 8p we still hadn't been called, so if you want to dine and don't have reservations, finding a seat at one of the bars (one upstairs and one down) or on one of their small sofas is the way to go.  Our first visit was only last week and I'm already thinking about when I can return!"
"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. We were both very pleased with the atmosphere, service and the food is amazing!"
"Full Review in the blog:The Reservation:  Make one.  We made ours for the 5:00pm opening time and the bar was filled by 5:20pm with the tables jammed by 5:45pm; the wait for a 4-top when we left at 6:35 was ""maybe an hour and a half"" while reservations were filled for later than 9:00 (on a Thursday.)  The Space:  Swanky is the only word that does this space justice - something I'd realize the following day that Sodikoff does quite well.  Antique mirrors and fixtures, brick walls, red leather, and dark wood from wall to wall with a beautiful bar 2-3 deep with beautiful people as smooth jazz filters overhead - it's a great place to see and be seen, but also the sort of place where a low table in the corner could serve quite admirably for those wanting to disappear into the background.The Service:  Aside from a truly rude male hostess who seemed to love his role as gatekeeper the team of servers at Bavette's couldn't have been better.  From the guys at the bar chatting up the clientele to the runners who wiped down our table after every course and refilled water glasses with a near-invisible hand everything was smooth.The Food and Drink: House bread and butter, two appetizers, two mains, one dessert, one coffee, house filtered water - $90 after tax and tip.House Bread and Salted Butter: Fluffy on the interior with a hearty crust this was French table bread at its best and served up warm with whipped butter topped with fleur de sel you'd be hard pressed to ask for better - were it not for the later dinner reservations more than one basket would have been necessary.Peppered Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine with Apricot Mustard and Toast:  As my sister does enjoy the texture of foie gras I passed on the pure foie torchon and opted for this - a tough choice on one hand, but at the same time perhaps a good call as this terrine was outstanding and enjoyable to the both of us.  According to Erik also sporting some foie intermingled with rough cut and pressed roast duck plus chunks of funky chevre this terrine was at once smooth and meaty, peppery but balanced, and entirely spreadable on the lightly charred bread.  Hefty to be sure but nicely tempered by the sweetness of the apricot spread and served in ample portion this is definitely a dish to share.Salt Cod Brandade with Malt Vinegar Chips:  Plain and simple, I love brandade - if it were on every menu I'd order it everywhere I went and with not a single spot in my prior or current home offering it on the daily menu it has sort of become a ""destination"" dish...and this one is without a doubt worth the trip.  Served as a play on ""fish and chips"" and entirely rich with cod at the fore while olive oil, garlic, and chives played a backup role the brandade was lightly browned at the top and still bubbly at the bottom while the chips proved a clever delivery mechanism - the vinegar and dearth of salt helping to cut the potency of the dried fish; a turn-off to my sister on her previous brandade experiences.  Black Label Meat Loaf with Mushroom Jus, Mashed Potatoes:  Erika's main course - or at least half of it as the rest went home to her roommate - this blend of beef and porkbelly certainly isn't mom's meatloaf, but no matter what nostalgia you have for childhood memories this is a damned good meatloaf, particularly when paired with chunky Yukon gold mash, whole roasted mushrooms, and a gravy of pan jus, woodsy mushrooms, and balsamic vinegar adding just enough sweetness to temper the fat.  Listed as a meatloaf but very low on filler and more like the sorts of terrines served on French bistro menus this was another hefty dish that could most certainly be shared as an entrée by most couples.Southern Style Fried Chicken with Buttermilk Ranch and Crystal Hot Sauce:  Another dish made for sharing I realize it is a bit skewed to call a $17 plate of chicken a 'deal' when places like KFC can feed a family of four for half of that but in the world of fine dining this dish is a steal - 6 pieces of organic chicken double fried to a golden brown with crunchy coating giving way to juicy bird.  Lightly salted and paired with house ranch plus the same $1 bottle of Crystal you can pick up at Wal-Mart this was no-frills American cooking with top notch ingredients yielding a top notch dish, half of this also going home in a doggie bag.Chocolate Cream Pie:  Skipping dessert after such a hefty meal may seem like the right thing to do but you'd be a fool to miss out on this dish - a signature according to Erik, especially when paired with a bottomless cup of La Colombe's Corsica.  More a chocolate pave than a 'chocolate cream' and resting atop an Oreo crust with a dollop of whipped cream nearly the size of the slice plus grated nutmeg this, much like the chicken, was simply what happens when a great kitchen uses great ingredients.  Sure you could make this at home, but since you probably won't I'd recommend it without hesitation."
The best restaurant I've ever been to in Chicago. Would love to go again but it's kinda hard to make reservation because it's too popular!
"I was really expecting a lot more from the steak with all these 5-star reviewsWe came for my birthday 3/2 and were seated to our table promptly, never were we offered a coat check. There was a coat check? Would have been nice to have since the table/seating space is small, and I would expect that from a steak house. Drinks: Amazing Old Fashions. We really loved these. Aps: Ordered Oysters, West Coast. So good, really fresh. But we only ordered 3 and they came out in a platter that could easily hold 20 oysters. Steak: Dry Aged Bone in Ribeye, Medium with the added butter garlic sauce. The steak lacked salt. So we had to add the finishing herbs with salt to get the taste we wanted. Be the way, the busboy gave us the herbs with salt on the side and never explained what the hell it was. We shared this and it came out cut in 5 parts. wish they only did 1 cut so the juices did not run. Sides: Elotes and Mashed Potatoes. Elotes was good, my boyfriend really liked it. The mash was good, not great or amazing. Dessert: Chocolate Pie. SO DAMN good. Like really good. This can be shared by 2. Service: there was a busboy that was constantly taking things away and rushing us a bit when the last oyster was left, asking us who was gonna take it. The waiter and the guy who took our drink order were great. Ambiance: really like the feel for this place, rustic with slashes of country french. Low lighting and boho chic sofas in the waiting area. Overall, I would go there again for drinks, dessert, and venture out on the aps, but not for the steak."
"I really wanted to give this place a five but I expected perfection and I did not get it. But this is def a place to try for a nice dinner. I loved the rose martinis had two of those and was feeling great. Service was also attentive and polite. The food I ordered chicago ribey, elote corn, and short rib stronganoff.  Meat was cooked perfectly, elote corn was delish but didnt fit in with my meal and the stronganoff was simple and needed either more sauce or seasoning. Was too full for dessert. Honestly I love gilt bar so much I just thought this would be better but it wasn't. Gilt bar still takes top spot right now."
"Without question, this is my favorite steakhouse in Chicago (I have been too the ""top 20"" in chicago and Bavette's is the most consistent and best tasting).I have had almost every steak offered - from the bone in ribeye to the bone in filet to the Chicago cut ribeye. All steaks that I have had have been executed to perfection. Whether you are a steak aficionado or a casual carnivore, these steaks contain some serious flavor and will not disappoint. Moreover, the staff is amazing. The staff will always attempt to accommodate any request and they are always ready to help in any respect. All in all, they are superb. Typically at the bar, I have a waitress by the name of Elizabeth and she is simply extraordinary.In sum, Bavettes will not disappoint. It is everything you want and more."
"Hovering between a 4 and a 5 here.Managed to get Open table (no points) reservation for three of us for 9:45 on a Saturday night.  It was busy and we were a bit early.  Nice lounge area to wait and we didn't wait long.  When we left after 11 people were still arriving.The host staff was a bit awkward with coat check and waiting for table, etc.  They seemed distracted somehow.  They were polite though.The bread was wonderful and perfectly warmed.Started with an old fashioned which was excellent.  We all enjoyed the tomato bacon salad.  The salmon was terrific--perfectly cooked, meaty and fresh.  My husband loved his filet--said it was one of the best he ever had.  We also had the Chicago cut rib-eye--which was huge and delicious. The corn elote was great (but it is quite creamy and rich).  Pomme frites were good--not the best ever but good.Music was good but not overwhelming so you could still talk. (This is downstairs.)We enjoyed the whiskey ice cream. Get the hot fudge--it is superb!Service was good. Of course, it's not cheap.Debating between 4 and 5 stars as we really liked it.  Nothing was wrong, but I guess I am trying to reduce my grade inflation :)"
"I picked this new to me restaurant after growing up in Chicago based on recommendations from Yelp. It was even more incredible than I could have imagined. What a wonderful place. Eclectic surroundings, super friendly staff, incredible server and downstairs speak easy lounge...incredible night. Perfect for couples. I can't wait to come back!!!! Love love love"
"First time having French cuisine! Thank you La France for an amazing experience. This place is amazing, the service was outstanding, the food was to die for. To start we had the duck terrine, let me tell you, it was amazing!! My father and I shared the bone marrow and the beef tongue, it was delicious!! Desert we had the chocolate creme pie that was absolutely amazing! Thank you thank you!"
"We had a terrific meal here and it was a great finale dinner to an epic Chicago honeymoon.  We really loved the atmosphere - and the space!  After getting to know way too many of our neighboring tables at other restaurants (as we're sitting inches away from them), it was an unbelievable treat to get to sit in a large booth just the two of us!  This just made me so darn happy.  Good thing we had all the room, because we ordered a ton!  Our server Daniel was very dapper and awesome - his very subtle charm and ease seemed to fit right in with the vibe there.  We had a couple cocktails and then took advantage of their fun BYOB policy and sent a glass of wine to a woman who was waiting for a table.  We also started out with some East Coast oysters, a perfect simple salty beginning.Our steaks were perfect and we loved the sides -- sugar snap peas with ricotta and mint were a fun, fresh surprise that offset the richness of our meal.  Had to have the corn after reading all the Yep reviews, and yup - it was great!  The only thing I didn't care for was the marrow I added to my steak - personally I would have rendered the fat out of that much longer.  I love marrow but not with 100% of the fat still there too.Mint ice cream with hot fudge was the perfect ending!Two cocktails, 1/2 dozen oysters and a salad, 2 steaks each with an accompaniment, two sides, and 1 dessert was $212.  It's not the first Chicago restaurant I'd return to based on price/value - but it was very nice ending to a very delicious week."
"Hmm... how do I rate this place?  Maybe the waiter was atypical or maybe that's just the particular ""charm"" of their service.We shared a bacon roasted tomato salad and some crab cakes to start.  The crab cakes were your standard fare, but I think the one at GT Fish & Oyster is better.The bacon roasted tomato salad on the other hand, was amazing.  If the rest of the food had been more like this, it would've been an easy 4 star.Now for the missteps.  My friend ordered her burger medium well.  She requested lettuce to use as lettuce wraps as she's mostly paleo (google it).  The waiter insisted that their lettuce was all shredded and that leaves would not be possible.  Fine.The burger is served without buns... and sitting on a leaf of lettuce.  Confusing.  Seeing this, she requested a few more leaves.  Great.  Midway through the burger, it starts bleeding out on her plate.Now maybe they're the kind of restaurant that feels it's some sort of meat sacrilege to cook things past medium rare.  Fine, just say that.  She felt uncomfortable sending it back, but she also really couldn't stomach eating it.The waiter was apologetic and took it back to the kitchen for it to get finished more.  A few minutes later, it's delivered again, and it's still bleeding out.  Really?I got the fried chicken and creamed spinach.  The spinach was rich and tasty.  The fried chicken looked great, but there was a little too much batter for me.  The chicken was nice and juicy but the batter made it too heavy for me.Overall, I'd say this is a good spot to come for a drink and maybe a shared smaller plate.  I wouldn't come back for a full dinner."
Great ambience and delicious food. The attention was great as well. The only thing I complained about was not having two stomachs.
"I have established a strong aversion against River North restaurants --  too many places filled with girls with short skirts and sky high heels and too few places actually care about the actual food. So before we got to bavette's, I was expecting a typical River North spot--modern decor, loud hip music, meat market. But the moment I walked in, I fell in love with this place! I love love love the decor of this place, very old school with bricks and dark wooden walls. Combined with the jazz music they were playing, it's as if I was brought back to the 60s like the Mad Men show. The crowd was very diversified too, I saw couples of our age, I saw older people hanging out, I saw friends getting together - all in all, a very unpretentious crowd by River North standard.  We sat down at a corner, our waiter came off a little snobby at first. But after I gave him a couple of dirty looks ( ask me how), he actually turned out to be fine. The drinks were very good, we had the Bavette's punch, the martini, and old fashioned cognac, and some bourbon. I could think of only a few places that I'd just go for drinks and now Bavette is one of them. For food, we got half a dozen east coast oysters, bone marrow, fried chicken (my favorite), and rib eye. Oysters were fresh, but I guess you can't really mess up oysters. The bone marrow was very very yummy--but again, you can't really mess up fat. What I think really stood out were the fried chicken and rib eye. I am a fried chicken snob, the meat needs to be tender and juicy, and outside needs to be crunchy, but not too bready. I personally think this was one of the best fried chickens I've had, better than Joe's, and they gave you a LOT. I took home half of the fried chicken and it's my lunch the next day. My husband's rib eye was perfectly medium rare, seared to perfection. Enough said. For dessert, we had the malted whiskey sundae, with hot fudge on the side. The malted whiskey ice cream tasted like a hybrid of butter scotch and caramel, unique and YUMMY.  Our bill came at around $180, for a Saturday night out, it's on the higher bound. BUT we did both get couple of drinks (count in my husband's jameson shot) , plus my husband got steak, so personally i think it's reasonable."
"I feel like a boa constrictor. Not because I feel as if I am a non-native species living in the Everglades, but because get this:Last night, I went to Bavette's and I consumed--a glass of the Mendocino cab--another glass of the Mendocino cab--6 fabulous east coast oysters--a glass of white burgundy to go with the oysters--lots of sourdough bread slathered with butter--a few plump shrimp from a great shrimp cocktail we split--incredibly good, creatively served pomme frites--yummy creamed spinach--crab stuffed avacado salad which we split--a 24 oz bone-in prime rib eye that was the best steak I have ever had (did NOT split)--another glass of Mendocino cab--French press coffeeI have eaten steak all over the US and elsewhere, including Argentina. This was, by far, the most delicious steak I have ever had. And really, what does it matter that you are dropping $50 on a steak when you are well into your 4th glass of wine? It doesn't matter. In fact, at that point, nothing matters but the food, wine, and ambiance.Bavette's works. From the cool atmosphere (yes, dark) to the cool cocktails being professionally made at the stainless steel topped bar, to the clubby booths, to the exposed brick walls. Our waiter was unpretentious, he had great recommendations, he intuited our cadence and slowed down the service when he realized we were there to talk, drink, and eat, and the whole night was perfect.If you are looking for steak in Chicago, do not miss Bavette's."
"Anytime a special event in my life occurs,  Bavette's is where I want to celebrate it at.   The space is stunning!   It has a speakeasy feel to it without being pretentious.  We started off with the seafood tower which was excellent!!!   The lobster claws were my favorite.   Juicy, sweet and succulent!  For my main,  the dry aged rib-eye was out of this world.  It was so tender that I was able to cut it with just a fork, and also perfectly seasoned.   Our waiter was knowledgeable from our cocktails to our dessert.   It's THE Chicago steakhouse of my dreams.   Thank you so much for existing in my city!"
"Totally enjoyed Bavette's.  It's a great restaurant for a fun, tasty evening - definitely kind of on the sexy side so pick your dinner companion(s) wisely.This place has the same vibe as many of Sodikoff's other place's (Maudes and Gilt Bar) - it covers classic food with some interesting new interpretations.  Excellent cocktail selection, with an emphasis on the old classics, and an excellent waitstaff.Started with an Old Overholt Old Fashioned for me - really good.  They did a good job of hitting the right balance between boozy and sweet, which can be tough with this drink.To start dinner we had Oysters and Foie Gras - can't go wrong here.  Did I mention the sexy aspect of the restaurant, well there you go.For entree i had the Stroganoff which was super tasty and surprisingly light.  I normally associate this dish with tons of heavy sour cream based sauce.  This was the opposite, with a more sparing yet super rich and delicious sauce which was sufficient to flavor the entire dish with overwhelming it.  I was skeptical, but so many reviews said it was great i had to try.  Spot on.Service was terrific - timing was great and our waiter very attentive without being overwhelming."
The service was fantastic.  The waiter allowed me to try one bone marrow piece and a small glass of wine.  I would get the bone marrow appetizer.Get the wedge salad and the dried age ribeye. Those two dishes could feed two people.  Had the butternut squash which I was not impressed with that dish.The chocolate pie was amazing.  Maybe the best part of the dinner. Although I usually don't care about how the restaurant appears this place looks great and the music was fantastic!!
"Excellent. Went here on a Friday evening after some drinks with a group of 6. The atmosphere was very laid back, drinks were great, and with food this delicious, family style was the way to go. We tried everything recommended and everything that came to the table was cooked to perfection. Tl;dr: Delicious old fashioned cocktails, and a great variety of delicious food."
"Loved everything about this place. Johnny was a very engaging and on point waiter, drinks were great, steak was cooked to perfection, music selection was great (maybe a tad bit loud - just made us sit closer to hear each other speak ;). The Hubby and I will definitely keep this on the list of ""our spots"" in Chicago."
"Best bone-in filet my bf has ever had! Tender, well seasoned... He had it done medium rare plus.. Delicious. Possibly the best steak he's ever had. Also ordered the baked sweet potato, which was two large sweet potatoes cut in half with cinnamon  brown sugar... I enjoyed it. It's not super sweet. Just right in my opinion. My bf wished it had more sugar and cinnamon though.  I also ordered smoked whitefish Caesar was very rich and flavored. We would definitely go back here on our visit to Chicago !! Also go early within an hour before ordering to avoid a long wait."
"By far one of the best restaurants in Chicago. I have been multiple times, tried about every dish on the menu and have literally nothing bad to say. The service is always so amazing and the inside is just gorgeous! You MUST visit at least 10 times or more in your life ;)"
"Hands down my new favorite restaurant in Chicago. My husband and I came here for our anniversary and had an amazing experience. The food was perfect (we had the baked goat cheese, filets, sage/bourbon butternut squash, mashed potatoes and the chocolate pie + their delicious cocktails...and the sourdough bread...oh my!) but it's important to note that the service was outstanding. Our server (Julio I think?) explained the menu well, made us feel comfortable and made sure not to rush us which is always appreciated. The ambiance is lovely and we could have stayed all night! We will be back soon!"
"One of my all time favorite places now! Came here after a night out for a little late night snack and even at 11:30pm it was busy, fresh, great service and did not disappoint! Ordered a couple of craft cocktails that were amazing... The fried chicken and corn. The fried chicken came out with several pieces.. Plenty to share amongst the table, a side of ranch (they had me at ranch btw), hot sauce and a fancy bucket for the bones. The corn was a concoction I would not have imagined but it was borderline amazing! The service was above par and the ambience was cozy & fun! Can't wait to go back."
"AMAZING experience all around. We started off with the mixed greens apple salad which came with warm bread and homemade butter-- delicious! My boyfriend scraped the candied pecans from his salad. Then we were on to the entrees. I ordered the steak frites and my boyfriend ordered the roast chicken, both were delicious. For a side, we ordered the elote style corn, as suggested by our waiter which was an excellent companion to our already scrumptious meal. We went on a Wednesday night and the ambiance was perfect-- packed, but not too loud, upscale, but not pretentious. Our waiter was very helpful and attentive. All around a solid five stars."
"This is my favorite restaurant for good!!!The seafood here is incredible! I've tried lots of seafood in many cities! This is the best, especially oysters and lobsters! The steaks are wonderfully, too! They are so big, and I can only finish no more than a half! Everything is just too good to forget! I love this place. I will definitely come again for seafood, steak, baked sweet potato, and ice cream!"
"I'm in town for meetings and decided to take my team out for a nice dinner. Based on word-of-mouth from local colleagues, I had high expectations for Bavette's and those expectations were exceeded. I'm not going to add much to what has already been written about the restaurant, but I can tell you that all is deserving. The wait staff was phenomenal - they were personable, respectful of our privacy and knew when the right times were to check in on us. Our waiter also made spot on recommendations on portion sizes and menu highlights. I know where I'll be recommending others on trips to Chicago seeking a quintessential Chicago dining experience: Bavette's."
"First of all: Serving fresh SEVERELY underbaked (raw dough in the middle)  bread is unacceptable for a restaurant of this level. This was the first time in my life that I had to send the bread back.On the bright side, appetizers ( Whitefish Caesar Salad and Baked Goat Cheese) were very good.Classic Ribeye was good, but nothing out of the ordinary."
"3.4food wise i give this place a solid 4 or higher but again my whole thing with dining is that its an entire experience whether 3 michelin stars or hole in the wall.we waited about 30 minutes past our reservation which seemed a little stupid to me. we got there well before our reservation time but thats on me, not them. still 30 minutes seemed excessive and poor table planning. 20 i could take but 30-40 is getting stupidwe ordered a ton of food and hopefully i remember it allbone marrow was fantastic but the presentation is an illusion. everyone posts these big big bone pieces that take up the entire table but the amount of marrow is about 5% of what you see since its just a tiny scoop in the middle of each of those bones. the price does not justify and im the one who will easily drop 200-300 on a good mealbread was amazing and butter was fantasticcaesar was fantastic as well and if dont like to see little fishes in your caesar im giving you a heads up. one of the best variations ive had in a whilebeef tongue was fantasticribeye was great as well. didn't make me cry but still very very goodfries and the other sides we got, can't remember them all were fantastic.the other NEGATIVE was the fact that the tables up against the wall are SUPER close together. its hard to have a conversation bc tables are talking on top of each otherJEANS: OK by far but dont wear a tshirt with it.ORDER: wait staff"
"I'm a fan. Not sure I would say that ""YAY, I'm a fan."" But I did like it. There will be some caveats either way.Service was good, not great. I thought his suggestions kinda sucked. Andy did not disagree. He was nice enough though so that was good. Beer selection was nice. I had a Three Floyds which you cannot get in NJ, at least last I checked. A pleasant surprise and I indulged in 3 of these bad boys. Yummy. Price was too high. I'll say that up front. In the end we dropped almost $100 per person for 3 of us. We got a lot of stuff but I don't know if the price justified what we ate. No, in fact, I'm sure it did not. I try my best to not let price get in the way of a review. But I make exceptions for extremely cheap food (eg, $2 breakfasts at Chinatown) and extremely expensive food. The recap is that this is very good, but at this price, I can't justify going here. With that, on to the actual selections. We picked 8 things between us, all of them appetizers and such. None of us was in the mood for steak so we mixed & matched everything. In the order the food came:Round 1.* Oysters. The menu offers 4 different kinds of oysters and we got 3 of each, so we could all try 1. There were 2 east coast and 2 west coast. I thought 1 of them was better than the rest, but in the end the place is dark so it's kinda hard to tell exactly how much lemon you squeeze on each oyster. And when it comes down to it, they're raw oysters. This is a dish that sort of goes on a pass/fail grade. This gets a pass. Round 2* Peppered Duck & Goat Cheese Terrine. Sounds really good. Looks less than incredibly good. Tastes overrated. I thought this sounded like a sure winner but in the end, no such luck. The meat was pressed with the goat cheese in the middle and an apricot marmalade and some bread to go with it. The combination really didn't work that well for me. But the real issue was that the terrine patty simply did not have a whole lot of flavor. And the goat cheese really did not stand out. Not sure what they did to this, but the dish was bland and uneventful. * Smoked Whitefish Ceaser salad. Really good, and they were not sparse with the whitefish. I love whitefish, and sometimes I think about the bagels with whitefish spread I used to get in college. This was solid, a very strong flavor that made me remember just how much I like it. The combination of flavors was spot-on, the salad well done, properly glazed with dressing, and a perfect amount of whitefish. This was a hit. * Crab Stuffed Avocado salad. This was also a hit but I think slightly less so than the whitefish salad. The crab was good, not great. It was stuffed into a half avocado and served with plain lettuce. It was good, and easy to eat. I don't know if this blows my socks off or anything. But it was a quality dish that I enjoyed. Andy made comment that it seems like more and more places deconstruct the meals these days and you end up having to mix it up yourself. I agree, though I don't know if I object to the practice or not. It is what it is, I guess. Round 3* Royal Lump Crab Cake. Again, overrated. Ok, there wasn't actually any rating on this dish but when you pay these kinds of prices you expect more. Andy doesn't ""get"" crab cake. And after this dish I cannot blame her. IMO, you need to have massive chunks of crab jutting out the sides of the crab cake and screaming, ""Someone just slapped this together right from a dead cooked crab."" It needs to have chunks of crab meat. A crab cake that is pulverized into a patty and served like a hockey puck is fodder of the Jersey shore. Not so good on this front. * Beef Tongue. Ok this was excellent. Extremely tender and well-seasoned, this dish was solid and we all loved it. It came with small potatoes which were roasted to near perfection. Not much more to say about this dish, other than it was most excellent. Would highly recommend. I guess Chicago does meat well. * Buttery Mashed Potatoes. A standard side which every Chicago restaurant seems to have. It was fine, good not great. I would get it again but if I went back I would try something else. Thankfully it was not drenched in butter nor cream like many of the places in this town tend to do. It was good. * Creamed Spinach. This was also tasty, and like the mashed potatoes was not overly greasy/creamy. I have gotten creamed spinach in town in years past, and it is often a testament to the gluttony of American society. While this was plenty flavorful, the dish was not 1000 calories of green cream & cheese. It was good, not over-indulgent, and enjoyable.There you have it. After writing this review, I'm not sure this is a 4 star place even. I guess it is, in a vacuum. When you factor in the price it's a 3 star place. In the end, I guess 3.5 stars? But my review does not scream, ""you must go there."" So I guess, you don't have to go there.Ok, Yelp says my review is too long. The end. Enjoy."
"By far the best steakhouse in Chicago. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is perfect. I feel like a lot of Chicago steakhouses go for the classic, traditional vibe and it doesn't give your dining experience much flair. Bavette's is just the opposite. Dim lighting, a bit noisy, mirrors, exposed walls, mismatched plates, wooden tables.... the perfect atmosphere. We had the Chicago cut steak and the bone-in 'Delmonico' strip, elote style corn and creamed spinach. Everything was absolutely on point. Topped off by a bottle of wine that we were able to bring ourselves because its BYOB!!!!! BYOB in river north is a rare thing and should be cherished by all. :) Seriously, I cannot say a bad thing about this place. It is a steak and seafood lovers dream. Thank you for getting it right every time, Bavettes."
"Hands-down the BEST steak I've ever had. Cooked to perfection with a glorious crust and incredible flavor.Start out with a mix of their oysters and a cocktail or two, then move on to the bone-in aged ribeye.For desert, the sundae is where it's at."
"That was,  hands down,  my favorite dinning experience ever.  My steak was flawless, the bone marrow was a delicious addition.  The sweet potato was amazing,  the brown sugar on top was like a crust similar to a crem brule and gave it that little extra ""something special"". The Lemon Meritage tea was the best tea I've ever drank (i love tea like most people love coffee). The wait staff was on point,  my water was never empty,  the table was always clean.  Our server was friendly and super helpful.  The atmosphere was really pleasant."
"Bavette's was good and all.... but not as amazing as I wanted it to be. I did not really care for the bone marrow appetizer.... I've had much better, so that was kinda sad :(Steak was good though, cooked to a perfect temperature of my liking.  I really liked the ambiance, it was fun and lively... service was eh.... Overall Bavette's was good, but I just don't think I'll be back."
The drinks were amazing the good was top notch! Not as expensive as some of the other steak houses downtown and the sourdough bread they give you was the best I had ever had! I had the filet that was cooked perfectly. I did order the corn that all the other reviews were raving about it was good but not my favorite. I would go back and sample other things on the menu.
"My man-friend and I had heard about this place from our hotel's concierge when asking for some recommendations around the city and we were not disappointed! We walked in with no reservations and sat up at the bar. The place itself is super sexy and old-school, almost like a dark speakeasy on the inside. It seems like you've stepped back in time because there are candles everywhere and it's got such a vibrant, almost sepia-toned aesthetic. As for service, the bartenders could not have been friendlier! I wish that I could remember their names, there was an extremely sweet guy and an awesome chick with great bangs who were working there when we dined. Just a quick shout out, you were both awesome!!!The food itself was absolutely stellar. We were recommended by our bartender to order the smoked trout and crisp potato (!) caesar salad, the prime bone-in dry aged ribeye, mashed potatoes with chicken jus, and elote style corn. I'll get the negatives out of the way now: the ONLY weak dish was the corn. Other than that, I cannot say enough great things about the food. The salad was so unique and tasty that we ate almost the entire salad. We split the ribeye for our entree and I'm so happy that we did because it was enormous. I have to say, this may have been the best steak I have ever eaten in my entire life. Better than anything I've had in New York, hands down. It was so juicy and flavorful it was almost like eating butter, that was how good the texture was. I am still salivating thinking about that beef. The smashed potatoes with chicken jus and roasted garlic was to die for, lumpy and velvety with hunks of garlic and chicken drippings over the top. I cannot even put to words how delicious this all was. We were absolutely stuffed otherwise we would have gotten dessert but there was just no room left after I ate my body weight in beef.I cannot wait to return to Chicago and when we do, this will be the place we go on our first night. We have not stopped talking about the steak since we left that night. I honestly think that our friends are sick of hearing about our life-changing steak experience at Bavette's but I couldn't help sharing just one more time. If you're in the mood for steak and you're in Chicago you will NOT be disappointed!"
"One of the best restaurants I've ever been. Great ambiance, like a 1920's speakeasy. The 22oz dry aged ribeye was incredible, waiter was great and u can also bring your own bottle of wine. Enough said go here."
"Yes, five stars. After coming here a few times and consistently have a 5-star experience, I had to give Bavette's just that! I consistently recommend Bavette's as one of the sexiest interiors in the city. Plush banquettes, perfectly romantic lighting and a great overall atmosphere. Even though your bill for two people can get pricey, in our experience the food has always been worth it. On our most recent trip, we had: Shrimp cocktail: Extra large shrimp served over ice, with a creamy dijon mustard or cocktail sauce. Wedge salad: With the Sodikoff style thick cut bacon, fresh herby dressing and a huge portion, it's a delicious start to the meal! NY Strip: a perfect crust to this steak Filet, Petit duchess cut: So tender that it melts in your mouth. Served with yummy roasted potatoes and the most perfect bearnaise sauce.  Elote style corn: a unique creamed corn with a cheesy/citrus flavor. I'd come back just for this. Frites: I love the fries here and at Au Cheval because they're fried it duck fat, and served with a great aioli. Ice Cream: both whiskey and vanilla flavors. We had cocktails, and then brought our own bottle of wine. The corkage policy at Bavette's is the best -- no charge, just share a glass with another table. Love it. Don't think twice -- eat, drink and enjoy at Bavette's."
"Spent over $500 for 2 including seafood tower n $180 bottle wine.  Everything was pretty good including ribeye.   What's really pathetic is that the best thing I loved about this place was the vibe, setting and the free freaking bread they give you.  Yes the free bread was best thing I had all night!  God I'm such a low class loser but bread was like wow like totally n stuff.  I don't know exactly what kind of bread it was either.  Couldn't put my finger on it.  Like sour dough'ish but it isn't, etc...it was like hermaphrodite of breads but it was freaking gooooood!"
"The birthday celebration continues, even weeks after! LOL. Finally got to come here for a nice dinner.Started off with the crab avocado salad. The crab was fresh and delicious and went so well with the creamy avocado and butter lettuce. Perfect start before our steak dinner.Got the bone-in ribeye (of course) medium. It was good, but I wish the meat had a little more marbling throughout. The only reason I took a star off. It reminded us more of a NY strip...For sides, we ordered the mashed potatoes (with whole garlic pieces, YUM), creamed spinach (this was way too heavy for my taste), and our fave side dish of the night: Elotes. We ended our meal with the whiskey maple ice cream with hot fudge on the side. I'm not a huge fan of dessert, but I'm so glad we tried this! Definitely something worth trying. :)The last part of the night was spent at the bar. I couldn't NOT get pickleback shots! LOL. I can't wait to try the downstairs area next time. I heard it's really nice!"
"First things first, can someone turn on a light in this place? OK, moving on. This place is a great example of how a restaurant should be. Service-Right off the bat the server came over and introduced themselves and immediately stated if you have any dietary restriction please me know. I thought this was a pleasant surprise as every restaurants I go in they don't care about my restrictions, but to ask right up front is awesome.Appetizers- We got 6 oysters, 3 from the West and 3 from the East. First timer on the oysters. I have to say these things had no taste. Nothing on the Bavette's I just think oysters have no taste. We also got the salmon tare tare. This was incredible except a bit too much sour cream on my plate.Entree- I decided on the salmon with the broccoli as the side. The salmon was grilled perfectly and the broccoli was seasoned just right. The amount of broccoli was enormous but you know what I ate all of it. it was that good. Who knew broccoli can be that good. Coffee- We decided to go with coffee with dinner instead of alcohol. it came in a French press. I never knew coffee could taste this good.I usualyy don't get sucked into the hype but this is the rare occasion when you should."
"Made a reservation (a must) and when we arrived they were very gracious and gave us a better table (upstairs instead of down). Their steaks are amazing and I had lamb this time, which was perfection. They have a small selection of salads but that isn't why one should go there. It's all about the meat, baby! Love the wine list and cocktails as well. This place is perfect for a date night or a small birthday dinner with your closest friends."
Definitely would recommend this as one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Hard to get a reservation but their steak was one of the best I've ever had and the atmosphere is equally good. Certainly on the more expensive end but worth the money
"First thought walking in was that I love it. It has a very classy 1920's library feel to it; beautiful polished wood with pockets of 1920's style book nooks, seating and lighting. We just came for drinks and dessert but we want to test out dinner. The only reason why this place has three stars is because the bar tenders were pulling that ""too cool to bar tend"" attitude. They were standoffish trying to order wine and gave no help on suggestions for dessert. We order the Chocolate Mousse Pie and it was divine; perfect texture and bitter sweetness. We over heard one of the bartenders recommending the Whiskey Ice Cream to the couple next to us and my bf joked that now one told him about that. He would have order it! The bartender's response: ""You were told. It is writing on the menu."" Ok, jacka**... our bad. Needless to say, we hope to not deal with that kind of attitude next time."
"Oh I am so, so in love with Bavette's.The entire time, we could pretend we were at a speakeasy in Manhattan. The vibe at Bavette's allowed us to do just that. Bavette's is a cross between Gilt Bar and Maude's (Brendan Sodikoff's other successful ventures). We were there at 9pm on a Thursday and the noise level wasn't as high as it always is at Gilt Bar. Our favorite and regular server, Amie, who used to work at Gilt Bar is now the manager at Bavette's. Congrats for the promotion, Aimee! We also recognized several other long-time employees from Gilt Bar who now works at Bavette's. It looks like Bavette's is now staffed with the more experienced employees. I love the dresscode for the bartenders and male servers-- white collared shirts with the sleeves folded up to the elbows, tie, and a vest. Classic and sharp, and the folded sleeves add casualness to it.The Berkshire pork chop was perfectly prepared. Our pork chop had some marbling to it which definitely added to the moist piece of meat. The beef tongue was also delicious. The salt cod brandade was also a great starter-- liked the fact that we could actually taste actual cod meat in the brandade instead of being all mushed up. Bavette's is a new place but it looks like their employee training is already in good place. Service was excellent. Also, where else would you actually have the busboy interacting with guests? The busboy stationed at our table went above what is usually expected at other restaurants. He asked us how we were, told us who our server was at the beginning of the night, described the salt/pepper/spices sprinkles which he brought to our table for our pork chop.Go, go, go. And if you like whiskey cocktails, they make a mean one."
"Meh. Visiting from out of town. Got the aged bone-in ribeye.  At first it came out room temperature, so I sent it back. Next time it was hotter, but still a bit undercooked. The steak itself wasn't great:  I honestly cook tastier steaks at home. The ribeye was grisly, and I had a tough time cutting through the silverskin with the provided steak knife.  At least I had a good Malbec and the bartenders were great. Tell me there's a better steakhouse in Chicago.  I recommend skipping if you're coming here for an exceptional steak"
"Every single possible star for atmosphere! Raining glittery stars for best old fashioned I've ever had! Sidewalk Hollywood worthy stars for thick juicy sliced bacon appetizer, mac n cheese, deluctable rib eye, and creamy corn! Bavette's is a place I'll be seeing again."
"We often visit Bavette's because we never tire of their food and the ambience.  I wouldn't say they consider themselves a steakhouse, but their steak is phenomenal. Their cocktails are innovative and their servers attentive.  All their pasta is house-made (of which I am always a sucker for), and they have good sides and salads to accompany whatever entree you select. If you so wish they have a whole raw bar selection with four types of oysters to choose from.  Two from the east coast and two from the west.  We always get their Kumamoto oysters though. Desserts are indulgent - do not expect petit fours here.  It's large servings of cheesecake or meringue pie.  If you like to people watch, ask to sit upstairs. If you prefer a quieter, tucked away experience, ask to sit downstairs in what feels like a speakeasy living room (they have a full bar downstairs and you can get their full menu too)."
"Best steakhouse experience I have had so far. Everything was wonderful. Oyster, wine, and steak were great. Wife's wedge salad would have fed 3 people. Get the Goldbricking ice cream sundae!"
It was as if someone peered into my brain to see what the ideal romantic date night spot would be for me.Smouldering artsy ambiance? Check.Amazing food with delicious choices for pescatarians? Check.Unbelievably good ice cream?  Hell yes!Only problem: I wasn't on a date.It was a little awkward to peer through the darkness to talk about work with a former colleague.  But completely worth it.
"This place lived up to the hype.  Myself and three associates dined here this week and enjoyed pretty much everything we ate.  The notable items were:Salmon tartare - very good with lavosh breadSeafood tower - quite a generous portion...more than enough for 4Filet with bernaise - well cooked and sauce was greatSlab bacon - reminded me of Peter Lugers and was quite tastyElotes - quite an interesting take on the Mexican street food.  I never dared to try it locally in Pilsen, but if it anything like this I might visit a street vendor.This is a trendy place and younger crowd, but still suitable for a business dinner."
"Great ambiance. Fantastically made drinks. I personally had the ""Have a Heart"" but also recommend the ""Dark and Stormy"""
"This is, quite simply and without a doubt, the BEST STEAK I HAVE EVER EATEN.  Not the best steak in downtown Chicago, not the best in the area, the best I've had on the planet, period.  I can barely even really describe it to you because I was in such a blissful steak-induced haze, but I'll try.OK, first off let me say, the front of house staff and servers are OUTSTANDING.  Very efficient, very knowledgeable of the menu, and you can tell that they actually eat the food there.As for the food... Get the prime bone in ribeye.  It is SO TENDER, and literally just melts in your mouth.  I dream about this steak.  Had the pomme frites, the crab cake, and creamed spinach... all good.  But the standout side is THE BACON.  May seem weird as a side, but just get it and thank me later.  Also the best I've ever had.GO HERE NOW!!!!"
"For Alex the bartender: 8/21/14- some people that meet Alex and request a drink from Alex may describe him as a condescending pretentious p*****face. I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt and describe him merely as condescending and pretentious. I made the mistake of requesting a drink with a base of grapefruit and vodka, add some muddled herbs or other flavors. Through the roll of Alex's eyes and body language I was left in no doubt how ridiculous and uncool my request was. Other than my experience with Alex, the rest of the staff at Bavettes were professional and made my dining experience pleasurable. The one star goes to my bar/ drink experience."
"The term dressy sure is very loose in this restaurant.  It may have once been like this, but it's pretty much casual now.  The servers wear jeans.  This shouldn't matter because it doesn't have any negative effect on the food.  I was shocked with how quickly the food came out, most steak places take forever to churn out your food.Traditional Filet mignon boneless cut melts in your mouth, I ordered rare and I got one that was medium, it was okay, but charred on the outside as well.  I notified the server and he immediately apologized and sent it back to the kitchen.  I guess the only way to turn medium rare back into rare was to start a new piece and the rare version was so much better.  Bone in dry aged ribeye was also tastey, served rare.  it had moments of cheweyness due to fat/tendons around the meat, but otherwise overall good.Elote corn, creamy but very tastey, especially with lime juice.  This was a great side which is the first time I've had corn in this particular style.  The menu says spicy, but it's not."
Wonderful steaks and side dishes. Warm atmosphere. Great place to bring a date. Very expensive.
"I'm going to have to rock the boat on this one and disagree with just about everyone else to give you my honest feedback about Bavette's. First of all, I think it's disrespectful to your customers to open a restaurant in such a small space that you can only accommodate a handful of people each night. You can't call yourself a restaurant, you should call yourself a bar with option to eat. It's just a ploy to create hype for your restaurant, surely, you could have leased a space that would give you ample room for enough tables and chairs to let an average number of diners come there each night. Second, your hostesses are the rudest people I've come across and those are the first impressions on your customers.My friend and I came in on a weeknight without a reservation hoping to find bar seating, which we were very lucky to get. We got a lounge table just off the bar. We waited for 15-20 minutes and no one came to greet us. I eventually flagged down the manager (I think) and he took our order and basically continued to serve us the rest of the night as our real waiter was AWOL. The food was so disappointing I wanted to cry! For the amount of time it took to get it and how expensive it was, it was so not worth the hassle. I could have gotten better food at a chain restaurant. The steak frite was dry, tough and so flavorless it tasted like liver, it was so disgusting I could barely eat it even though I was starving. The lamb shank was also disturbingly flavorless and bland, I didn't know you could mess up lamb shank that badly. The fries were literally the best thing I ate that night. Sadly, I will not be coming back here again and I urge you to save your money and not believe all the hype.The two stars are for the beautiful speakeasy decor (old world charm, dimly lit and romantic) and the manager, who graciously and attentively served us that night."
"Wow.  I mean WOW!!!!! The very definition of a Chicago steakhouse.  Lots of dark woods & dim lighting.  A mix of humanity ... couples on dates, married couples on date night, businessmen, groups.  Nice bar in the center of the restaurant - super friendly knowledgeable barmen; they made excellent recommendations for scotch and whiskey.  Was sad to leave the bar when they called our table.  The food & wine ...  exquisite!  Service was attentive.  Not inexpensive but worth every penny.  Reason enough to visit Chicago.  Boston has nice steakhouses, but wishing we had one of these."
This place has an AMAZING atmosphere. My hotel bartender recommended this place and it was a fantastic first place to have dinner while visiting!! This certainly set the bar high for the rest of my stay.
"This is my pick for an anniversary dinner and my boyfriend did compliment me for an awesome choice. Yay me! We had their filet mignon , classic chicago cut ribeye, creamed spinach and their elote style corn, all are absolutely perfect. I must say,  the Bavette team made our anniversary extra special. I cannot wait to come back and hopefully very soon."
"Went to Bavette's with my girlfriend on a Saturday at 7:30 with no reservations...not the best planning, but we wanted to give it a shot.  We walked in and they told us a 2 hour wait but we could head to the bar an hang out.  We figured we would grab a drink and then go somewhere else to eat.We walked to the bar and in about 3 minutes the hostess came up to us and said a reservation did not show up so we could have their table, perfect scenario.We each got a drink and put in an order for the goat cheese appetizer.  It was amazing to say the least.  We then put in our main course orders -- I got the salmon and my girlfriend got the filet mignon.We traded bites and I can honestly say it was the best steak and salmon I have had in Chicago.The food along with the service and atmosphere will have me back on a regular basis."
"I normally steer away from steak places like Flemings etc as most of the time I can make the steak better at home on my Weber.  That is not the case here.  This was hands down the BEST steak I have ever had.  I love the fact that they give you special salt to put on your steak if you want.  The sourdough bread is tremendously awesome....best bread i have ever had.  The baked goat cheese was decent not memorable.  The baked potato was awesome, the bacon here is unique, we would come back to order the bacon all on its own.  We had the gold brick sundae with the malt whiskey ice cream for dessert which was also just okay.  five stars for the steak, potatoes and bacon, four stars for the dessert and goat cheese..."
"Very nice steakhouse.  Great service, romantic ambiance and good food.  Not mind-blowing food, but good food.Had to wait over an hour to be seated because we had no reservation - but there were empty tables in the restaurant.  BAD decision on their part.Likely wouldn't return."
"Loved this place!! One of my new favorites ever.It was dim and candle-lit, cozy and romantic. Our host Brandon was very knowledgable about the fare and made great recommendations.I got the petite filet mignon done medium, and it was fantastic. My favorite side was the buttery garlic mashed potatoes.Will definitely come back for a special occasion!"
I took people visiting from out of town here and was disappointed because the experience was lackluster. Split a steak with my boyfriend and received a butchered steak. Who does that to a beautiful ribeye? The steak itself was only okay but the sides were pretty tasty. The waiter took it upon himself to choose the birthday boy's dessert and charge us for it. Never coming back.
"Truly a fantastic all around dining experience at Bavette's, from my pre dinner Negroni at the bar to my Black Dog Gelato Malted Whiskey ice cream for dessert with French press coffee. I was impressed from the moment I walked in; very well thought out sexy decor. Sleek leather booths, dark wood, exposed brick, dim lights and noticeable but unobtrusive Rat Pack music - this is one classy old school steakhouse. Lots of energy and pizzazz yet comfortable. The menu is far more diverse and unpredictable than a typical steakhouse and as much care goes into the non-steak entrees - this is not a venue where if you opt out of steak you are receiving an inferior meal. Everything we ordered was well executed and delicious. For starters I had a half dozen oyster that were beautifully presented on a large stainless steal platter illuminated by a candle in the center; they were served with both a mignonette and a cocktail sauce with freshly grated horseradish (you choose from four different oysters and can mix and match in groups of three). My wife's baked goat cheese with a tomato sauce and garlic bread was decadent and the wedge salad with a large, thick slab of maple glazed bacon was equally outstanding. For entrees we decided to do an order of fried chicken as well as the 24oz aged bone in dry aged rib-eye with bone marrow to share (with a loaded baked potato and elote for sides). The fried chicken was the best I have ever tasted; thick, perfectly crisp exterior and juicy, flavorful meat. The rib-eye was a monster in size; cooked a perfect medium rare it nearly melted in your mouth and possessed remarkable flavor. I strongly recommend this strategy of sharing a steak as well as a non-steak entree when dining as a couple. Our server Sarah was warm and knowledgeable of the menu when we had questions. We lucked out with being seated at a large, comfortable booth generally allocated to larger parties; some of the two-tops are a bit cozy and closely spaced. Despite being filled to capacity we were not made to feel rushed; Sarah coursed out our order nicely. Perhaps the only slight boeuf (beef) was she appeared to be responsible for a large number of tables, so she and her support staff were spread a bit thin, but still did a commendable job. I also would have liked to have had a bit more of a description of the dishes, but overall the service and ambiance was friendly and inviting. My wife and I both have ravenous appetites but portions were so enormous we ended up only being able to consume half our dessert and had enough left of the savories that we had a full dinner's worth today (and everything tasted just as delicious the day after). Not only were we fighting over who received what of the leftovers (as it was all so amazing) we also already have booked a return visit; definitely signs of a fantastic dinner. Most of the food is rich, so this is not a place one would dine at real frequently, but what is nice is the menu is so varied that one can have a blow out meal with a luxurious seafood platter and high end steak worthy of a special occasion or opt for a shaved beef sandwich, short rib stroganoff, meatloaf etc. and have a relatively inexpensive date night (they even have an unusual BYOB policy where there is no corkage provided that you gift a glass of your wine to another table; additionally there is a great cocktail list and vast wine list with options at all price ranges). I look forward to a long relationship with Bavette's Bar & Boeuf and this is clearly the best steakhouse I have frequented both in terms of ambiance and cuisine.Follow me on twitter: @Goof_2"
"Great dinner. Crab cakes are chunky, fresh, with a perfect blend of sauce, not too creamy or dry. They also have a slight outer crisp. The oysters were also great, reminds me of GT, although seems hard to mess up, most places just taste days old or dried out. Recommend the bone in filet mignon, best I've had from any steakhouse downtown. The boneless filet minion wasn't bad, just not as good as David Burkes, cooked perfectly, just lacked as much flavor. Chocolate cream pie to finish is plenty for two, not too rich."
"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner after a recent trip to see Phantom of the Opera. We had heard good things but getting a reservation was tricky. We ended up with a 5pm slot on a Sunday night. It was right when the place was opening, but you would never have guessed it (except for the fact that it wasn't too busy yet).We arrived a few minutes early, but that didn't seem to cause a problem. The host stand took out coats to check and we were whisked away through the door to the GORGEOUS restaurant that screams Speakeasy era. I was immediately in awe of the whole atmosphere. Dark wood walls with antiqued mirrors, dim golden lighting, HUGE beautiful chandeliers, wooden tables, mismatched floral/antique plates and loud-ish (but not distracting) jazz music playing. Oh and a cocktail list that rivaled the dinner menu. Totally my style.Our waiter came by the table pretty quickly to give us a cocktail list and welcome us. He made a few recommendations, filled our waters and allowed us time to settle in.Now, I could go on and on about my experience at Bavette's. The only thing you need to know is that the waiter was fantastic (Brandon, I think was his name), the food was fantastic (I ordered the petite 6 oz. filet- BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD), the atmosphere was fantastic, and we literally can't wait to go back. Unfortunately, everyone else feels the same way. So get on OpenTable ASAP and start planning for... May? You won't regret it."
Each time I've come here craziness has ensued (last time my wife's friend went into labor and we had to leave to attend the homebirth) and we haven't gotten to thoroughly enjoy dinner- but what I had was great. Fried chicken and the corn. Wow!
"My husband and I are on a quest to find Chicago's best steakhouses.  So far we love David Burke and RPM Steak, and we were excited to give Bavette's a try!But we were disappointed...at least to the extent we were looking for a restaurant that serves up great steak!  Specifically:1. The worst moment...my husband ordered his steak (the $60 rib eye recommended by our server) ""medium rare"" (which is also what our server recommended).  The steak arrived well done.  Our server didn't check back right away, but after frantically waving at other employees, she came to our table. We showed her the black meat. She said, ""I'll have to check with the chef.  It could be rarer in the center.""I guess we were fortunate that she returned a few minutes later saying that the chef agreed my husband's over cooked steak was in fact over cooked.  Within just a few minutes, a new steak was brought out...again over done (though not as over as the first one).  Given that my entree was getting cold, my husband decided to just accept it...but of course two over done steaks priced at $60 are unacceptable.2. The ambiance is so lame. When we arrived, we were given a table for two in the main dining room where we were a mere foot away or so from the guests seated at the tables on either side.  We noticed a booth where two people were sitting was emptying out, so we asked if we could sit there. We were told that  that booth was being saved for a larger party (even though all the other booths had just two guests seated in them).  We were offered seats in the basement, which we took, as there was more ""elbow room.""  However, the basement looked like a bar or a pizza parlor, and the lighting was so poor that my husband had to use the light on his cell phone for us to read the menu.3. The wait staff was mediocre.  As we said above, they didn't check in with us, didn't offer us bread, didn't set the utensils (they just threw them in the middle of where we were sitting) and when we were given the bacon that came with pepper, didn't point out the pepper until we'd eaten the entire dish (they'd placed the pepper off to the side). Not exactly rude, but not professional by any means.4. On the plus side...I had the roasted chicken, which was delicious and surprisingly only $21. The bacon side was good, but not as good as a bacon side we'd enjoyed at David Burke's.  The Old Fashioned (Meade) was good.  The corn for which Bavette's is known was good. The shrimp appetizer was good. The bread, once we requested it, was excellent- crispy crust, soft inside and good sourdough kick. The broccoli was good, though I make it just as tasty at home (it's just roasted, though still yummy).5. All in all, as an experience, we left feeling short changed, and we don't plan to go back any time soon.  We had expected the steak to shine as Bavette's claims to be a steak house, yet the glimmers of genius coming from the kitchen had more to do with sourdough bread and big shrimp than their steak.  And the ""we don't really care about you"" vibe we got from the employees means we really don't think we want to bother returning to Bavette's any time soon. There are just too many great Chicago steakhouses to bother going back."
"LOVE this bar. Straight out of a midnight in Paris meets mad men. Great place for a steak, cocktail and ambiance. I plan to make this a regular go-to"
"I cannot rave enough about this place.The ambiance is intoxicating. It's like walking right into a speakeasy. The combination of great lighting, small and intimate tables, and jazz music truly takes this place over the top.Drinks are good and quite strong. I had the Old Fashioned and actually thought it was worth $16. Never thought I'd see the day...Steaks are absolutely top notch. My fiance called BS on me when I told him the reviews on Yelp said some people had the best steaks of their life there. Sure enough, he's a believer now. Delicious.Fries and garlic aioli are also FAB. Run, don't walk! Kidding... make a reservation or you might not get in :)"
"Wow. One of the best meals I have had in a long time.We sat downstairs, which I would recommend, its definitely quieter and more intimate.  I also LOVE restaurants willing to seat 2 somes at bigger tables.  We had a nice big booth with room to spread out.  Started with a Bavettes Punch - great drink.Ordered:-Caesar Salad- fantastic, totally recommended-Crab Cake - this was just ok, nothing to go out of your way for-Chicago Cut Ribeye- this was a great steak.  so much food, ill be eating it for days.  But the piece of meat was just wonderful-Elotes Style Corn - best  I have ever had-Bacon - yum, just, yum.-Fries - very good, the garlic aoili they come with is memorable (same as au cheval if you have eaten there)Ended with Coffee and even that was great!I would 100% recommend this place for anyone looking for a top notch dining experience."
"First steak restaurant I've been to since moving to Chicago and I'm sold! On a cold Tuesday night my boyfriend and I were craving a steak and this place exceed my expectations. It has quite a romantic atmosphere and if you get a booth the whole dinner feels super cozy and intimate. And I haven't even begun to rave about the food. We weren't crazy hungry, so we each got a steak, a 6oz filet mignon and the 24oz prime bone in rib-eye, and shared a side of elote style corn as per our waitress' recommendation. While the side dish was a bit underwhelming, the filet mignon was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful taste, while the rib-eye was really juicy, with just the right amount of saltiness. By far two of the best steaks I have ever tasted. We had a bottle of red, which went well with the steak, but felt a bit overpriced for what it was. I later learned they allow you to bring your own wine, so that might be a better idea for next time! On the other hand, the cocktails we had were absolutely delicious. Try the mint julep if you're into that kind of thing. You won't be disappointed.As for dessert, the waitress recommended the cheesecake, which was a bit too heavy for my taste. Then again, that's probably because I'm just not used to American-style cheese cake, so it didn't really affect my overall feeling about the place!Overall conclusion: great ambiance, great steak, great cocktails -- enough for me to want to come back!"
"I wish that a rating beyond 5 stars existed... I came back and am in Love! The duchess cut filet (cooked medium and to absolute perfection), the corn and the oysters were fabulous. The bar staff Jay and Lailaw had the best recommendations and were absolutely wonderful and charming. I can't wait for my next trip :) thank you!!!!"
"the first step you take inside this restaurant will make you feel like you've step into some high end establishment in the roaring 20's.our table of 4 almost spend 3 hours in the restaurant. I could tell the server was a bit peeved but we had such a good time and the food and atmosphere was great, we weren't ready to leave. Memorable dishes:Bone marrowSteak and Frites Beet and Arugula SaladWhiskey Ice cream with gold brickThe food is fresh and high quality. Steak is very tender. Their butter is very flavorful with hint of salt. Their bread is warm and addictive with the bone marrow and sweet shallots. I highly recommend this place and I  would gladly come back here again"
"Prime ribeye to die for. They will brag about their bacon, and you'll realize why they do once you get your first bite. I advise you to get the elotes as a side for your meal. I wish more steak joints served epic elotes as sides. Don't even get me started on the chocolate cream pie. Phenomenal. Now the atmosphere of this place is really what got me.. It's like this Euro steakhouse - 1920's speakeasy jazz fusion joint and it's spectacular. I'd even come for just the drinks and the good vibe. Unbelievable experience"
"Service took really long. If you're not into special delicacies I don't recommend this place. I also don't recommend that you make drink requests - stick to what's on the drink menu. Ordered a cucumber mojito and had to send it back. I think the waiters recommendations were just bad. However, the steaks were amazing."
"I visited this restaurant for the first time a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it! The service was really amazing, we sat in the basement which I also thought had a more fun vibe then the main floor. My boyfriend ordered the Oysters which were definitely his least favorite part (he has had better else where), but the rest of our meal was wonderful! I tried the fried chicken which was better than I expected as it was boneless which was a nice surprise! Would definitely return here again, great atmosphere and good food!"
Best lamb I have ever had. Cooked to perfection. I had the lamb T-bone w/buttered mushrooms and my fiancé had the Chicago style rib-eye w/bone marrow. Can't forget the thick cut bacon....you can't miss that. When I come back to Chicago I will definitely repeat this place. The service is also exceptional.
"My boss and I ate at Bavette's during the N.R.A. show and it was to die for!!!Both of our filets, the corn & loaded baked potatoes were so amazing there are hardly words to describe our meals.  Our drinks were amazing, old-fashions and sazeracs, made in front of us with all the works.  And the whiskey ice cream with dark chocolate sauce was the BEST dessert ever!!"
"Excellent! Perhaps my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Very cool atmosphere and old-school, 1920s vibe. Upscale, yet relaxed. I love the wine policy - you may bring one bottle per two people, so long as you share a glass with someone else at the restaurant. Our food was delicious: we began with the wedge salad (which is large enough to be shared for 2), I had the salmon (prepared to perfection), and my boyfriend had the prime beef. All excellent. On top of it all, the service was impeccable. Thanks, Bavettes, for a memorable experience!"
"Picked this place for a great steak and it didn't disappoint. Good service and great food. The oysters were delicious and the New York Strip sublime. Great atmosphere. Only disappointment was the limited range of wines and in particular American wines, all of which were extremely expensive. As a European this makes no sense. I love American wine, but it shouldn't be more expensive/less accessible in America than French or Italian wine!"
"Bavette's, like all of Brendan Sodikoff's joints, is dimly lit with old school decor to make you feel like you stepped back in time.  It sets an appropriate tone for the menu, which has a solid old school feel, almost more so than the Next Chicago steak menu.  It's a place we had been meaning to check out for awhile, and I'm glad we finally got around to checking it out.Now the caveat to this review is that we stayed reasonably modest this trip, avoiding the pricier prime cuts of meat and the shellfish tower (as tempting as it was)We did, however, start with a half dozen oysters - 3 Mattaki's, and 3 Raspberry Point (West and East coast, respectively).   The smaller West coast Mattaki's were a bit sweet, the larger Raspberry Points had just the right amount of saltiness.So the picture is obviously dark, an homage to Sodikoff's lighting scheme, but shows the wonderful plating of the salmon tartare dish, serving a healthy dollop of finely chopped salmon, nicely seasoned with a bit of pepper to give it just a bit of spice that was balanced perfectly by a scoop of creme fraiche.  The thinly crisped lavash provides an excellent vessel to scoop up bites off of the plate.Sara went with the steak frites - a reasonably sized portion of a flat-iron steak, simply prepared and served with a side of sea salt, peppercorns, and a few other spices that you can sprinkle on.  The Bearnaise sauce was a bit thick and oily, but had a decent flavor, the steak itself was pretty solid and suprisingly tender for a flat-iron.  The fries were a bit limp and sauce, but well seasoned.I went with the fried chicken, as Bavettes' was recently highlighted the dish in an article in Chicago magazine.  Served with a housemade hot sauce and a buttermilk ranch with perfect consistency, the chicken itself was well battered.  The batter itself had a bit of flavor, but it wasn't anything noteworthy.  The meat itself lacked any real flavor, and it was a bit on the dry side.The next real highlight of the meal was the side of elote-style corn, which I highly recommend getting as a side no matter what you order at Bavette's.  It's bathed in a cream sauce with an  interesting mix of chili powder and lime, giving it a nice spicy-sour taste with hints of parmesan.For dessert, we got the gold-brick sundae - another highly recommended item, if you have room.  Two scoops of ice cream served with a magic shell chocolate sauce.  The ice cream was an awesome malted bourbon ice cream and the sauce solidifies in to a crisp chocolate shell almost immediately as it hits the ice cream.So I can't tell whether we're on more of a Sodikoff kick or a DMK kick - I guess DMK edges out the Sodikoff group - with trips to DMK, County, and MK in the last month or two, but a trip to Au Cheval or the new spot opening up in the Dillman's' space would even up the score.  I   I would like to go back to Bavette's and try some of the higher-end prime cuts, and definitely go back for the elote. Pics and more up at eatinginchicago2014.word…"
"Bavette's has an amazing speakeasy, back room with cigars style atmosphere. The food is amazing and the wait staff is more casual than most in this price range. Get the corn, you won't regret it."
"I will start with hostess, made reservations on Monday night she was extremely rude, put us down in dungeon service was good when we were the only table, food awesome. As soon as it got busier service declined fast. Worst music ever! Not sure if I will come back!  Luckily when I yelped from table it didn't go through, steaks took five minutes, dessert 25 minutes....still waiting!  Still waiting Still waitingGot it, delicious"
"This place was very good. It was not worthy of a 1 month prior reservation. Very dark inside, which I liked. Made the ambience romantic. Crab/Avacado salad was our favorite. Tomato/Bacon salad was dull. We had a cheap item on the menu, the steak sandwich and that was delicious.  Overall a good experience, probably not a destination, but I wouldn't hesitate to go back."
"I questioned giving them the four stars when I found out they charged my boyfriend for my birthday dessert. He did not specify what he wanted, just mentioned it was my birthday, so they brought the most expensive option and charged for it! When you are spending a very pretty penny, I don't think a small complimentary dessert is unreasonable.Anyways, I'll mention the reasons they did deserve 4 stars.. the food and ambiance.  For hor d'oeuvres, I loved the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine with apricot mustard, yum! Oysters were some of the best I've had in Chicago. Steak was perfectly done, with flavorful wild mushrooms. I was not crazy about the bone marrow, but I'm sure it was good for being what it was.  I wanted to try it, but it just tasted like chunky fat to me.I probably won't be back because of the principle I ranted about earlier, but I'm glad I tried it because it was great food!"
"This place has it all!! Excellent food, service, and decor.  We ordered the crab-cake, short rib stroganoff, and flat iron steak.  All of it, I mean ALL of it was delicious!  I've eaten a many steak and I cannot say I've ever tasted a flat iron steak that was prepared and tasted more like a rib eye.  The ambiance was very, very nice; new look with a ""prohibition era"" style, even down to the silverware.  Too bad I live in Texas or I would be here regularly.  To the owners - would you consider expanding to Houston?"
"Come for the cocktails and unique ambiance.The steaks were good (but you already knew that), the cocktails were great, the service was impeccable. Only complaint - sit us on time if we make a reservation! We had a 10 PM reservation, get it together man.Also, this place is not dressy, over half the crowd wore jeans."
"Ate at Bavette's Tonight for my boyfriends birthday and it was amazing! I had to make reservations 3 months in advance but it was well worth the wait. To start we had avocado stuffed crab, for main dishes we had salmon and chicago cut steak, and for dessert we had the best chocolate cream pie that I've ever had. OMG. So good. The only complaint I have is that it was freezing in the restaurant and the music was too loud."
"I went here for my birthday. The ambiance was amazing, like a speakeasy. They have an awesome byob(wine) policy! Now for the important stuff the food! The dry aged 22oz ribeye was amazing! I went to David burkes a few weeks prior and Bavettes ribeye knocks them out of the water! Perfectly cooked, medium rare with a beautiful crust! Also the mashed potatoes were great! This place is a must!"
"My four stars are for the atmosphere. Something I really miss about Chicago restaurants, the perfectly lite spaces. Don't get my wrong I also enjoyed the food, the beverages and the service but the ambience  was what did it for me. I'm a sucker for that prohibition throwback look. We went with a large group and they accommodated us nicely. Don't ask me about the steak, I didn't eat it. I did have the fish though and it did not disappoint. Oh, and, don't skip the bread. It's amazing!"
"I dined here almost two weeks ago, but I'm still talking about this dinner to friends... to the point of them probably sick of hearing me discuss anything about this ""amazing meal I had at Bavette's."" I went in on a Monday night with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary. Awww! (Go ahead. I'll wait for you to collectively say, ""Awww!"") I could not have asked for a better place to celebrate this very special occasion. Our hostess checked us in, sat us, and welcomed us to Bavette's --- a restaurant that I swear feels like pre-war Paris with a twist of classic Americana. We read online about this amazing beef stroganoff, but it wasn't on the menu. Bummer. It's fine, but our mouths were definitely set for this ""special"" stroganoff. We ordered the fried chicken, elote corn, and steak frites. The steak (we ordered it medium well) was fabulous. A place known for its beef... well, it better be amazing! And again, it was. Now, lemme rush to talk about this pork fat fried chicken. Holy... I better watch my language here. The fried chicken was incredibly memorable. The batter was fried perfectly and (I'm not sure if this will turn you on or off but...) the seasonings made the chicken taste like breakfast sausage. I know this sounds a little ""low-brow"" of me to say that, but it reminded me of those spices... This is good for me at least! The chicken was still moist and the portion was very reasonable for the price. Eat this chicken with the slightly spice-sweet-tangy elote corn, and you're in gastronomic paradise! Their cocktails were delicious as well. I ordered a kir royale, and well... who doesn't like champagne and cassis? Psh. They also had very tasty artisan crusty bread. Bread is my downfall, and they were nice enough to bring more out even though I had already eaten basically a whole chicken and a cow. The service was solid. Nothing extraordinary, but definitely still made for a nice evening. I have several sets of friends coming into town in the next month and I've told each of them to try scoring reservations here because it's just too good! And honestly, the prices are a huge plus for me. In my opinion, for the quality and portion of the food, it's worth every penny -- and I don't say that very often."
"They make amazing drinks! Best Manhattan that we had on our vacation.  The food is great too. If you order 2 appetizers, an entree, and a salad then that's enough for two people.  We had the oysters, goat cheese dip, Caesar salad, pork chop, a sweet potato, and roasted tomato, but we barely touched the tomato.  The sweet potato was great, though."
"I always enjoy this place...  I've never eaten in the dining room but have always sat at the bar, typically in the downstairs lounge.  The food, cocktails, and service have always been very good."
"Great ambiance! Very stylish, low key, and elegant dining area. This is an ideal place to take someone for a nice night out. The food was also top notch. Oysters were fantastic. My salmon was done perfectly. I loved all the sides, but especially the butternut squash. I don't eat red meat, but others said the steaks were excellent. The service was good, but I think given the atmosphere and prices at Bavette's, it should have been a bit better. There were a couple times when it was hard to track down our server."
"As opposed to Girl and the Goat, which was hardly any food for a lot of money, while this place is upscale, you at least get your money's worth, and it's all so good, I had the cheeseburger with sides of creamed spinach and corn and fries, I loved it all, I got the chocolate pie for dessert which was good too, I tried my friend's fried chicken and bacon which were both really good too, full bar too"
I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday about a month ago. The atmosphere/decor was my favorite thing about this place. Old-fashioned and beautiful. Steaks were great but the garlic aoli fries were my favorite part actually. The reason this is not 5 starts is because our waiter was sarcastic and extremely rude. I would still come here and just hope that you get a different waiter. It really put a damper on a day that would have otherwise been pretty perfect.
"Look, usually I don't care about service that much. But for a place like this, hmm. I don't need you to kiss my a$$ but when I am out to dinner with someone paying $100-200 for my night, I am really going to need your snottiness to take it down a notch. I mean, she wasn't exactly rude, but she wasn't exactly a doll either. It was as if she was a mother-in-law totally disinterested in her husband's children. The service was well-timed, but not very friendly. Even before we were seated, the hostess was pretty rude to anybody who came in without a reservation.Anyway, skip the seafood towers. It's not worth $150+ for what you get. It's fresh and pretty good but...nah. Crab cakes were really good. I'm pretty sure the goat cheese was responsible for not feeling so hot the next morning. The petite filet I had was actually outstanding. Cooked just the way I love it and it was extremely flavorful. I didn't use much of it and I don't know what that sauce was on the side - hollandaise? But it was so good. Loved the ""Goldbrick Sundae"" and the chocolate pie. The inside is sexy as ever which really made the night. My hosts are some of my favorite people on Earth so that made the night as well. If a person brought me there because it was their favorite restaurant for a first date, I would probably not go out with that person again. Well maybe one more time to see what else they have up their sleeve - another pretentious Chicago restaurant that takes forever to get a reservation? THEN we'll never see each other again. Three stars for the ambiance and the great luck they had on my steak....and my company made up for the rest. Thanks."
"YES.Everything was phenomenal.  I've eaten here a few times now and it never gets less phenomenal.  The staff is attentive, the mood is warm and seductive without being over the top (still fun for friends to go), the food is OUT of this world.  Bavettes rocks my world.  Cheers!"
"It was an interesting night in the windy city.  I had on 3 jackets, yet it was still chilly.  The coldest December I had spend any where.We arrived at Bavette and was told that the wait time was 3 hours - I was devastated because my travel was short and I was hungry. So, be sure to make ""reservation"" before you come.We make way to the basement bar - it was full.  We found a seat by the main bar and was able to order food there.  I had chop - it was delicious. One of the best chop I have had.Ambient:  Lovely, cozy, romantic.Service:  The best.  Story time:  We ordered a salad but the bartender forgot to put it in - so the manager came out, apologized, took the order off the bill, and were very tentative to us.  Thank you for that.Price:  It does not matter at that point.  I had French red - tastes like lady in red, who's reserved, classy, yet too much for you to handled. Let your imagination runs wild ladies and gentlemen. Will visit again on my next Chicago trip."
"Booked a reservation way in advance as we were coming in from Portland for a visit.  Happened to be St Pat's day (celebration, not actual date).  Unfortunately for us, the atmosphere (very clubby, old school speakeasy vibe) didn't match what was going on outside. I had no idea that St Pat's day in Chicago was like Mardi Gras without the stench. Not that timing had anything to do with the service / food.Seated promptly in a great booth.  Atmosphere was perfect.  Server was great.Had a salad to begin.  As the waiter said, it has the ""Bentley of bacon"" on top.  He was not kidding.  That has to be the best bacon I've had in my life.  Words can't describe it.  I ordered the bone-in, dry aged rib eye.  My gf had the petite fillet.  Both were fantastic.  However, I should have gone with my standard of either side of the t-bone.  I'm more of a fillet or New York guy.For side dishes we had the corn, loaded baked potato and sweet potato.  Baked potato was nothing special...other than it had more of that amazing bacon on top.  The sweet potato was excellent.  The corn was just ok.  Other reviews indicated it was wonderful.  I found it to be just ok.For desert we had the chocolate pie.  My gf thought it was amazing.  I thought it was fine but not amazing.  But they did put a candle on the top for my birthday.  A nice touch."
"We picked this place wanting a splurge for our last night in Chicago and we're not disappointed. We were seated downstairs where the dim lighting, leather booths, brick walls and candlelight lent a really cozy vibe and conjured images of the 1920s. As many Yelpers have attested, the food is fabulously prepared and generously portioned. Also their wine policy allows you to make someone else happy while saving you a few bucks.  I ordered the rib eye and mashed potatoes, which were to die for! The hubs had the stroganoff and coleslaw and ate every bite. My gimlet was amazing and his old fashioned lived up to the raves of others.Something I really appreciated about this place, other than food and ambiance, was the server. Christina was really knowledgeable. She had tasted many of the menu items personally and could comment intelligently about them. She also knew how to pay attention to us and how to leave us alone. A rare gift!!If you want to treat yourself to a special meal, try this place!!"
"This place was great!  From the moment I walked in, I liked this place.  Unlike so many other restaurants in the neighborhood, the hostesses were super friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  They squeezed my party in even though we didn't have a reservation, which was great.   Then there's the decor.  You feel like you've been transported to some old time speakeasy.  The decor some how instantly made me feel cooler.  Sigh, and don't even get me started on our waiter.  I totally had a huge crush on him.  He was a rugged, actor looking guy.  And on top of his good looks he was incredibly friendly and super knowledgeable about the food.  Ok, ok, I'm onto the main event... the food.  All of it was tasty!  We started with the salmon tartare, which was to die for.  Perfectly seasoned and delicious.  I got the steak frites for my main course.  It was cooked to perfection and perfectly seasoned.  We also got the elote to share, which we all loved.  It was just a more upscale version of the classic street food, but the twist on it was perfect.  All in all, I will definitely be back here again."
"In comparing Bavette's, Maude's, and Au Cheval, I'm very torn between Maude's and Bavette's (Au Cheval is the clear loser for me personally).  I absolutely love the speakeasy decor.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the wine list.  There were some good values on there but some that were 3x markup.  There were three of us so we decided to split several things.  Bone-in, dry-aged ribeye was a good steak, but it was a bone-in, dry-aged ribeye.  It was good but probably my least favorite thing we ate.  It wasn't Bennys (sorry Chicago Mag).  The salmon tartare was absolutely delicious.  It was very flavorful and not dull at all.  The beef tongue was super succulent and we all really enjoyed that.  The horseradish sauce that accompanies is awesome.  The foie gras, it was decent but not the best.  I personally prefer a mousse style as opposed to terrine but even for a terrine this was a bit dense.  The blackberry and raspberry compote that comes with it is stellar though.  The star of the meal though was the fried chicken.  How do  more people not rave about this?  I'm agreeing with Lu H. that it may be the best I've ever had.  I picked up a ball of it and started eating and immediately thought, 'wow, this is so juicy!' but then realized I had no idea what I was eating.  So I asked the server what piece was it and he said part of the breast.  Apparently the free range chickens they use have such  large breasts that they have to split it into pieces.  'Wait,' I thought.  'If this is white meat...'  I of course demanded the thigh.  OMG.  The skin is crispy and flavorful.  But the meat.  It didn't even have the texture of normal chicken meat cause it was so unbelievably moist and tender.  I'm not a sweets person so I typically drink my dessert so I was happy that they had so many great after dinner drinks (Chartreuse, amaros, etc.).  We did all share the vanilla ice cream with chocolate fudge.  The chocolate was great and I enjoyed the ice cream.  Overall the food was really great but the fried chicken the clear table stand out.  I'd give it 4.5 but rounding up due to the excellent server we had.  Can't wait to go back!"
Outstanding food and service.  Loved it.
"Came here while in town for business. My colleague and I ordered the Filet Mignon, which was well worth the money. Bone Marrow and crab cake to start, which were both excellent. Cocktails were delicious and the service was on point. Came in around 9 without a reservation on a Tuesday and sat at a high top table. Seemed to be a hot spot in the area. Will be back next time I am in town!"
"Could be the best steak I have ever had, huge 22 oz thick juicy cut - Classic Ribeye Chicago Cut. Did not need and steak sauce or condiments, it was great by itself. Shared the Thick Cut Bacon and Pomme Frites. The Thick Cit Bacon was probably the best bacon I have ever had, it had a sweet crispy taste. The Pommes Frites with the garlic mayo was like eating garlic fries without them getting soggy. Could not be more pleased with this extraordinary food feast experience. Your loss if you do not go, make reservations."
"haiku to bavette's bar & boeufthe atmosphere--acethe service--polished, friendlythe cuisine--trés yum-------The good news: Made reservations a month & a half in advance but still had limited options (either really early or really late). Had them put a note in that we'd prefer an earlier time if possible, and ended up getting a time 1/2 hour earlier than our original reservation a day or so in advance--(called us to confirm).  The server, Michael F., was wonderful, and he made us feel comfortable and welcome. I ordered the avocado crab stuffed salad (should've gotten the dressing on the side), which was actually plenty of food for me; and my dining partner got the steak frites. He is a major steak person and was really impressed. The frites (of course I nabbed a few) were also quite good. We were pleased that it wasn't so dark in Bavette's you couldn't see the menu and that it wasn't so loud you had to shout--(e.g., at Mastro's, sometimes you feel like you have to shout--though Mastro's is great). Everyone around us seemed like they were having a great time, too.The unexpected news: We were seated in the front part of the dining room in the corner long booth area. It was sort of like a sweetheart table, so we were kind of sitting kitty corner from one another...the table was really small, so if it were two average sized adults (I'm pretty much pint sized), there would've very little legroom. Also, we sort of felt like we were halfway the the tables on either side of us. Plus, one of the tables right next to us added another diner part way into our and their dinner, so that person ended up sitting right next to one of us... I'm all about communal dining when it's expected (e.g., The Purple Pig); but, for a place like Bavette--especially since we went there for a special occasion--it would've been nice to have the experience be a little more normal. We asked to be re-seated, though were on a bit of a time crunch so didn't want to wait it out until tables had paid their bills and left, etc. Just decided to go with it. The nice touch: Complimentary sourdough bread (super tasty); and the painted, mis-matched china made it feel like more of a 'special'/less commercial dining experience.Will definitely dine at Bavette's again due to the great food, service, and overall ambiance."
"Ok, twist my arm. I'll go for a goodbye dinner to a chic restaurant. Poor me! Or pour me some of those wonderful cocktails and had yummy plates while we celebrate. The triple B isn't a typical steakhouse as in it isn't old school, stodgy, or masculine. But low key, kind of modern, warm, and good to dine with a friend, business associate, family member, or date. The service is knowledgeable.We ordered sparkling cocktails to be festive. The M. Laurent which incorporated cognac, amaretto, creme de cacoa. And the Kir Royale with cassis and lemon. Lovely. The complimentary bread with whipped butter was delicious. We followed by the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine with apricot mustard. Oh dear. Love at first bite (that was corny but shut up and listen). Rich, savory, succulence easily spread on the crunchy toasts. The apricot mustard cut the peppery-ness of the dish. I went with the broiled salmon which was good enough, but relatively straight forward. It was a ""safe"" option. My dining partner got the steak frites which was well presented. He gave it a thumbs up (because he was busy eating so I think he liked it).As sides we split the creamed spinach and the elotes. They were fantastic. The creamed spinach at first alarmed me as it looked too well done but after I got past the crispy crust it was full of bleu cheese and caramelized onions and so comforting. The elotes was a dish of buttery corn with lime, chili, and Parmesan. A-Maize-ing (that was corny-!- but you're almost done reading) decadent and well seasoned. I hope they add a macaroni and cheese option, I may just fall in love. We definitely had a feast. I regret not being able to bring back leftovers. I also can't wait to try their southern fried chicken. Parting is such sweet sorrow, Bavette's, until we meet again."
"The atmosphere at Bavette's is very chill. Great jazz music and great staff. I got the chicken...which was quite a lot and not that great, but my boyfriend got steak and it was perfectly cooked and delicious. Many people get a seafood tower (which is a bit pricey), but is definitely on my list of things to try there.This is a great place to stop by for a drink as well. They have great specialty drinks and their Old Fashioneds are awesome!"
Absolutely horrible service. We waited 3 months for a table and they were late by the time we got it. Our waiter Daniel was extremely rude and I attentive. When we complained to management they blew us off and said we didn't have a right to complain. All for very standard steak house options. For the money I would go to ANY other steakhouse. Will never go again and I have already told all my friends not to go.
"For this being rated ""one of the best"" steak houses in Chicago... I was not impressed. The overall atmosphere was very cool. Dark and awesome decor. The service was good, but was not happy with my steak. I ordered the petite filet, medium rare. It came out extremely rare. I have never been picky about my steak, but the middle was downright cold. They brought it back and it was still cold in the middle. Luckily my boyfriend likes RARE steak so he ate it with no complaints. The sides were okay. Service and atmosphere were great, but I will not be coming back for a steak."
"I came here on a double date - the atmosphere was great and perfect for small outings!The filet was delicious, definitely one of the best steakhouses in Chicago. I have to agree with everyone else - the corn was amazing!They have an amazing byob policy - you can bring 1 bottle of wine for every 2 people at the table. No corkage fee. You just have to share 1 glass per bottle with another table."
"I love the corkage fee  ""share a glass with another patron, at another table"". how fun and creative is that.  brought two bottles to have with our dinner and was happy to share.  started with marrow, its probalby the best marrow I have had.  then we split a crab avocado sald, equally yummy but filling.... uh oh. split a steak but I couldnt even finish the  half a steak.  seasoned just rigth too.  loved it all.  and of course YOU  MUST DO THE WHISKEY ICE CREAM. that was over the top!  service was spot on, the whole experiences was top notch and I would def go again."
"So...darn...good!  It was delicious.  Fancy without being pretentious.  Special occasion-y but still somewhat casual.  Romantic, but with a fun air.  Our fantastic experience started with the first phone call.  I was making a reservation for my husband and I to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary.  The hostess mentioned that they had reservation in the parlor (downstairs) or upstairs.  Having never been there, I asked if she could give me some information on the ambiance of the two areas.  She was more than happy to provide some description to me, so I could make a decision.The upstairs area has a slightly more lively feel to it, but don't expect a dance club.  It has some softly playing music in the background and multitude of people buzzing around the bar, but it didn't feel crowded (this was a Thursday evening).  We ended up downstairs, which is a much smaller area filled with U-shaped booths.  It's VERY dimly lit (study the menu before you come).  But, this area was perfect for a date night together!  The server was also one of the bartenders and was fantastic the entire night.  He offered some real suggestions to us and gave his honest opinion, which was really helpful in selecting our meals.  We went with the duck and goat cheese terrine to start.  It was garlicky, but as garlic lovers we didn't really mind.  I then had the petite duchess cut filet while my husband had the Chicago cut.  Both were lovely.  We also shared some fries and creamed spinach.  Rich and delicious!  And finally we ordered the goldbrick sundae for dessert.  We'd only ever seen this listed on the menu of one other restaurant (The Temptation in Boca Grande, FL) so we knew that we had to try it.  We selected a scoop of vanilla and whiskey ice cream and it came out with a small cup of the chocolate shell that hardened as it was poured over the top of the ice cream.  Yum, yum, yum!  However, by this point we were more than stuffed and so we have to admit that not much of the dessert was really finished.  Though we would've liked to eat more...especially now as I write this and I am hungry again!"
The food is prepared beautifully. Steak cut like butter.
"Best way to describe it is: YOU MUST GO! Everything was perfect from the beginning until the end. The restaurant is well located, with and atmosphere I have never seen: super cool decoration and illumination. All the waiters and waitress were super attentive, and explained us everything in detail. Their suggestions were helpful, and lead us to choose a couple of dishes we really enjoyed. The food was excellent! We had the shrimps as appetizer, and I had the pork ad entree. Great choice! The price, a bit expensive, but definitely it is worth. It was in part because the wine was quite expensive, but as I noticed in my trip to Chicago, wines are really pricey in every single (fine) restaurant. Overall, as my girlfriend said, no matter how ugly you are, if you have a date with a girl in that place, is yours! :D"
"Maude's is better- go there! But this place is worth checking out too. Went here with a girlfriend without reservations and was able to snag two seats at the bar immediately- they do serve their whole menu at the bar which is nice. Got the reisling wine- decently priced for such a swanky steakhouse. Ambience was great, but definitely more sit down and relax for dinner instead of dinner/drinks before going out (like gilt bar/Maude's). The salmon tartare was better at Maude's- I hated the tortilla type chips it was served with at bavettes. The avocado stuffed crab was AMAZING. Our waiter was attentive and pleasant. Will be back."
"Three stars because there's no way for me to rate the food (a solid four) and ambiance (a solid two) individually.Since the table shared many items, there's a lot going on in this review. Apologies if by reading this you suddenly get really hungry or really grossed out.Side of bacon? Yes, just do it. I don't like bacon, but I liked this stuff. Just make sure the plate is taken away immediately upon serving the last piece, because that lingering, solidifying grease puddle will leave you feeling awful.Baked potato can be skipped. It's a baked potato. Sweet potato is good, but again - an expensive baked sweet potato.Shrimp cocktail is delightful, and plentiful. Skip the dijonnaise and get more horseradish.Wedge salad is huge! Plenty to share for several people.The goat cheese appetizer is fantastic, and a must-have. Lots of food easily shared between two or more people.Hash browns are done right -- crispy as possible. Yum. I could eat an entire plate of them.Fillets and the meatloaf are fantastic. Absolutely top-shelf. The larger bone-in steaks did not receive stellar reviews, and the crab cake was judged to be ""okay.""Service was spectacularly polite and timely. A+ menu knowledge and insight. Refreshingly chipper waiter made the experience quite enjoyable and kept us from ordering more food than we could possibly expect to eat.My gripe is largely the space and the lighting. The booths are not designed for more than 3 or 4 people to sit comfortably, yet 6 were crammed in. It was, at best, intimate. And there's the lightning. I can understand the look they're trying to pass off, but the lights are so extremely dim so as to be uncomfortable. It really felt like we were eating in the dark at times, and it does a true disservice to the food to not be able to see it well before eating it, because it's all gorgeously presented.On the up side, you can walk out of the place at any hour and it'll feel bright and early."
"Epic - from the bar to the beef.  4 people blew it out at dinner - seafood tower, steaks, dessert, wine, cocktails, and more.  Amazing quality and only $160 per person!"
"I'm really quite torn on this place. I think the thing that makes Bavette's stand out or special is the design. It has a fantastic ambiance. We really loved our table in the basement where it was cozier and much more quite. Regarding the food, it's been three weeks since we ate here and I've found no reason to go back. I didn't leave the restaurant swooning over the food and time hasn't created that for me. The men enjoyed their bone in ribeye's but they weren't any better than what they've gotten at any other steakhouse or purchased from a great butcher and prepared at home. My bone in pork chop was much the same...it was delicious, but not standout. Someone else ordered some sandwich which looked tasty. To be honest I don't even remember her comment on it, if there was one. The sides were fine. The mashed potatoes were interesting. I love garlic, but didn't really like biting into a whole clove of garlic even though it was roasted. The elote was, well seriously, I can't for the life of me understand why it's getting all of the acclaim it's getting. It was just sweet corn bathed in a mayo/sriachi sauce with a bit of lime and a tiny bit of cilantro.We went old school and shared the wedge salad which was pretty good and I would probably order it again. The goat cheese appetizer was not at all great. The tomato sauce was sweet, much like the elote sauce (or maybe that was the corn?). We also had a shrimp appetizer. I think the ambiance is worth a stop, but I would suggest you hit up your favorite restaurant and then head to Bavette's for a drink afterward. The lillet rose martini was delicious."
"Holy Moly this was one of the best meals I have ever had!  Went with a friends to celebrate a birthday and had an amazing meal.  The place has such a cool vibe with brick walls, dim lighting, and comfy booths to sit in.  It feels like you are stepping into another era.  We got a bunch of different things and shared.  Tried the apple and endive salad which was the ""healthy"" piece of our meal and salmon tartare to start which were both lovely.  I know it's just bread, but the sourdough was delicious.   Loved the Beef Stroganoff - so rich with house made noodles, creamy sauce, and perfectly tender beef.  The fried chicken was crispy and the ranch dressing that came with it was spot on.  There was also a giant baked potato with all the right toppings, a pork chop that my friend said was ""the best"" and, of course a steak.  We all left stuffed and happy!"
"great atmosphere, wonderful food and fast service. Only issue I had was at the door, when I first arrived, we did not have a reservation so I asked how long will it be and they said, well we can't really tell you. I then asked how many people are in front of us and they said again it's our policy not to tell you. You may have to wait at least 2 hours, though many tables were empty, we were about to walk out but decided to eat at the bar. After we ate, they texted me that the table was ready...almost 2 hours laterThe baked goat cheese app was awesome, the wedge us huge, and really enjoyed the steak. I urge you to find a spot at the bar....great bartenders"
"Excellent service. We BYOB'd & we left the decision to the waiter as top who should get the donation glass. He chose a birthday boy who knew the bottle & was excited to get it.We had the duck terrine(?) app, the dry aged ribeye, the corn, & the ridiculous peppermint ice cream with the gold brick. I can't say enough about the ice cream.I'll be back!!"
"What a place! Great ambiance, superb service, some of the best food we have ever had! ( we have dined all over the world). Highly recommend for a special occasion or just if u are in the mood for a really really good meal."
"Had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally made it there last night.  The food really was very good, but was expecting a bit more given all the hype.  We started off with the goat cheese appetizer, which was really tasty and was a good size to share between the 4 of us.  For the main course, my dad and my husband had the ribeye and did really enjoy it.  My mom had the filet and though I tried it and really enjoyed it, she said that it wasn't her favorite.  My beef stroganoff was also very good and the fresh noodles were particularly tasty.  We also shared the corn and a baked potato as sides--the corn did live up to they hype and the potato, well, it was a potato, but the thick bacon pieces on top set it apart.  The weird thing was that though we ordered these sides for sharing, they didn't bring any side plates or serving utensils (guess we could have flagged down a server and asked), but it just seemed odd.  Guess I was supposed to put a big scoop of corn (with the fork I had been eating off of) in the middle of my beef stroganoff noodles?  The real standout of the meal was the dessert....we had the chocolate cream pie and boy, was it delicious.  Not sure what they put in that crust but am pretty sure it is addictive.  Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner but just didn't think it was the best meal of our lives."
"Loved the BOYB policy here. You have a share a glass of wine with another table. Definitely makes for good conversation.  I got the steak frittes here. The meat was cooked perfectly exactly how I had requested, and the sides were amazing. Definitely order the thick cut the bacon and the spinach."
"5 stars because of the atmosphere - foodBeware of server who refers to everyone as ""young man"" - which was just generally awkward based on his young age and seemingly forced insertion of the phrase into dialogue. Would recommend calling in advance to not get this waiter."
"Phenomenal, exquisite, unbelievable -- every synonym at my disposal wouldn't be enough to underline just how extraordinary my meal here was.  My parents were in town visiting Chicago for the first time, so I'd made reservations here because I'd heard such good things; from the moment I walked in the door, my already high expectations were blown out of the water.  First off: this place is gorgeous.  The ambiance is a wonderful throwback to a steakhouse out of a Roaring Twenties noir-film, the kind of place that I imagine Fitzgerald and Hemingway would've eaten at.  The dim lighting, the candles, the perfectly dressed waitstaff and bartenders; all this and more work in concert to let you know that this restaurant is more than just a place to eat, it's here to make a bold statement about what a steakhouse can be.Speaking of the staff, they are delightful and unflappable.  My dad has quite poor vision these days, especially in low light.  With how dark this place is, you definitely need a few minutes for your eyes to adjust.  Long story short, we ran into some new friends of ours when we arrived for our reservation and my dad (to my dismay) decided he was going to get a picture with them. Flash and all.  In the middle of the floor of the busy, crowded, dark restaurant.  I was trying to get him to stop, but the waitstaff were incredibly kind and even helped him get a picture.  Kudos to all of you there for being so accommodating -- you earned every penny of my unusually large tip.The cocktails? To die for.  I'm writing this review a few weeks after the fact, so I can't precisely recall the name, but it had Lillet Blanc, St. Germain, and vodka. It looked so simple on paper, but it was hands down the best cocktail I've had in my life (and believe me, they are many).  As soon as you lift the glass a bright nose of fresh lemon hits you before your first sip and on tasting, every flavor is in perfect balance and harmony.  I similarly appreciated their beer menu.  Though not extensive, any place that carries the Taddy Porter knows what they're doing.Onto the food.  I'll attempt to be brief here because, with my longwinded nature, I could go on for days outlining the multitude of ways in which they impressed me.  Bavette's has recalibrated my scale for what I consider a perfect steak and hell, my whole scale for judging food period.  Knowing I'd only be able to come once, I had to go for the signature dry aged ribeye (as did my dad).  Perfect.  Simply perfect.  No frills, just an intensely flavorful meat with the bleu cheese-like tang of a well aged, high quality beef and an immaculate crust.  To die for.  Literally: if I had to face death, I can say without hesitation that this would be my choice for a last meal. Being able to add bone marrow to any steak? Be still, my beating heart.  Judging by our noises while eating our steaks, having been rendered quite literally speechless by them, one could be forgiven for thinking they were eavesdropping on something risqué.  With the way that steak left me feeling, they wouldn't even be wrong.My mom, bless her, is not an adventurous eater.  Now, she is a bit of a gourmand and an exceptional baker, but she is very picky when it comes to her meat being thoroughly torched and certainly doesn't touch bone marrow.  She doesn't mean any offense when she orders her meat well done and is fully aware of all the downsides (both in terms of what meat will be used for it and of the scorn of the chef) - it's just a personal aversion to anything more than a slight pink.  She went with the stroganoff and was as impressed with it as she's ever been.  I sampled some of it myself and it was heavenly.  The noodles had the perfect bite to them, the meat was done to her liking while retaining its flavor and being buttery-tender.  Sublime.Then desserts, oh the deserts.  They're fabulous, all of them.  Oh, and since I didn't mention it above: Get the elote appetizer. Don't ask questions, just get it.  Everything we had here was good. Great. Indescribably magnificent. I can't write anything more; it just makes the painful longing I have to return to this rapturous experience of an establishment stronger and stronger.  I implore you, all of you, anyone who will listen: go to Bavettes.  You owe it to yourself. Your mouth, mind, body, even your soul will thank you.  It was a dining experience I'll never forget and though I've since moved back to the West Coast, if I'm ever even remotely in the area again I guarantee I will be making a pilgrimage back here. I give it All Of The Stars out of 5.No, I do not normally write like this; l generally save hyperbole of this extent for sarcastic purposes.  I don't even usually go out of my way to write reviews on Yelp rather than in my personal journal or occasionally in a blog.  This place, however, really /moved me/ in a way few meals ever have. Inspirational - my highest compliments to the chef and to everyone. Thank you all."
"Shrimp cocktail, Steak Frites, and Bone Marrow are amazing.  Bavette's was delicious and I honestly cannot wait to go back.  I love the ambiance- exposed brick and the bar area make it fun."
"Based on a strong YELP score I went on Open Table on Wednesday and booked a table at 7:30 for the following day.Very disappointed in their steak preparation. As a steak centric restaurant, my review is based only on this aspect of their service.I ordered a 10oz filet and asked that it be ""butterflied"". Effectively, doubling the surface area of the steak and allowing for twice the sear.They cooked my steak without butterflying it. Then, after they were through cooking it, they butterflied it and put it on a plate.When it was delivered, I cut into it and I couldn't figure out why one side of the steak was seared while the opposite side was pretty much raw. I flipped the steak over and found myself looking at a raw surface of meat.My table mates and I laughed out loud.I told the waiter and he couldn't explain it.For a restaurant that specializes in steak and further, has a cut of steak as their name, I considered this experience inexcusable."
"I booked this place a month in advance.It is a lovely place for couple. Good service. and I love the malt whiskey ice cream so much. $6 for 2 huge scoops. The elote style corn as side tasted so good. My chicago cut was over cooked, which made me so disappointed."
"Am I the only one that's going to say it like it is? I like gilt bar and Maude's but Bavette's is a missed opportunity! The service is very prohibition and a little snobby-- that I can handle. It's nice inside and they have a couple good cocktails, again very prohibition. But it stops there. There's this holding pen as I call it in the front where you check in, then more doors go to the restaurant. Like they are saying, ""Oooh, you can't get in yet!"" Pass out. Like they are doing you a favor. Do you want my greenbacks or not?! You know how the Violet Hour is annoying? Oh geez. ""Goat cheese (circa 1992)"" -- is that a joke? Because it was popular then? That's what they say. Maybe it was made then. I didn't feel good. My fault. We still ordered it in spite of the ridiculous name. I've been here twice and both entrees were okay. My wife was never particularly happy with hers. Chicken the first time that was bad and salmon too rare the second time around. Think cold in the middle. My first time I had a stroganoff that was alright and the second time I had a so so pork chop. We skipped dessert. The redeeming thing was the smoked whitefish Caesar that wasn't ours. And now the interesting part. There is so much salt in this food! Why?! I went up two pants sizes even though I diarrhea'd that goat cheese from the early '90s throughout the night! That's not right. Neither is being woken up in the middle of the night with the runs after what would have otherwise been a benign meal (toast with some goat cheese and tomato, and a pork chop). Two stars because the drinks are alright and I like the interior. I'd be happy to have a cocktail there and move on to dinner elsewhere."
"For my boyfriend's birthday, we wanted a good steak and experience and everything about Bavette's fit the bill. We sat in an extremely spacious and comfortable booth with candles lit, intimate lighting and a server who was not only very genuinely friendly but knew his stuff. To start, salad was perfectly dressed and flavorful. Steak was delicious. The corn elote side was phenomenal, albeit very rich if you're looking for a healthy vegetable. We didn't have a single complaint with anything we ordered - even my dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives seemed more refreshing than usual. Thanks, Bavette's."
"The food as always was excellent, but the service was poor.  From the moment we were seated our server was in an obvious huge rush to get us out of there.  We ordered a nice bottle of wine and she checked with us approx 5 times within 10 minutes to order food. So we ordered apps and then dinner, which was out within a couple of minutes while we just started on bread. This after we said we wanted to take our time. Meanwhile our server kept filling our glasses to the top, seemingly to get us to chug our wine down. It was very irritating.  We had 3/4 bottle of wine left when we were finished eating, then immediately on to the dessert menu.  I had to tell her to please keep the bottle on the table.  We dine out frequently including many times at Bavettes and never have I experienced service that was so rushed, almost like it was a race against time.  Especially with an expensive meal.  It was disappointing."
My body runs on steak and red wine. The bone-in Delmonico was one of the best steaks I've eaten. Anywhere. Ever. Thank you Chicago!
"After reading all the positive reviews about the dry aged bone in ribeye, I thought this place was going to be good.  It was disappointing.  The disappointing part of the dinner was the bone in ribeye.  I read about all the good reviews (I believe on Eater Chicago?; someone on Yelp also posted and mentioned this was the best ribeye he/she had ever had) and I may be missing something, but I didn't like the dry aged bone in ribeye.  Why?  One edge of the ribeye was all fat.  I understand that ribeyes are supposed to be fatty (gives the steak flavor) but one edge of the steak was all fat (one inch thick).  The steak was cooked fine but when I sliced through the steak I had trouble cutting it because of tendons.  I kept on cutting using the knife and I wasnt able to cut through one tendon.  It was just disgusting.  Then having to eat it is a whole different story.  I have had ribeyes before and I've never had this experience.My father also didnt like the ribeye.  I recommended it to him because I read a lot of positive reviews about the steak. He was disappointed in the steak as well. We both thought maybe our knives weren't sharp enough? Maybe if we had another steak (delmonico, filet mignon) the meal would've been better.  Thats why I am giving the place 3 stars.  If I go back I wouldn't order the dry aged bone in ribeye.For appetizers, we had the oysters which were good.  Fresh.For sides, we had the corn elote which was good.  The thick cut bacon, to me, was not that good despite all the raving reviews. I wish it couldve been crispier.  The fat in the bacon didnt taste very good.The other sides were just ok.The desserts were good.  We had the chocolate creme pie.  Im a big fan of oreos and they made it with a oreo crust.  The other two desserts we had were the peppermint ice cream and the cider ice cream.  We had a 9 pm reservation.  However, there was a 830 pm opening on OpenTable.  I called the restaurant and asked if I could change the reservation to 830 pm instead.  The gentleman told me I could come in at 830 pm.  The party before us was eating for 3-4 hours and therefore, despite coming in at 830 pm, we were seated at 9 pm (about a 30 minute wait).  The manager was cool about it and took care of desserts, but if you cant sit a party at 830 I wouldnt tell your guests to come in at 830 pm.  Coach Tom Thibodeau was there that night.  He must have been waiting about 20-30 mins for a table.  Overall, the steak was disappointing.  I'm not sure if I would want to go back considering you have to reserve a table months in advance if you want a 7 pm time slot.The environment was very nice.  As others mentioned before Bavettes has a speakeasy atmosphere.  It really hits you once you open the door leading into the restaurant.This place can only take reservation for at most 6 people.Just to give you some perspective, the best steakhouses Ive ever been to is St. Anselm in Brooklyn, NY and the Metropolitan in Seattle (the tomahawk steak there is to die for)."
"I came here with 3 others of my friends to enjoy a nice Chicago steak dinner. I was in no way prepared to eat here...First of all, this is the epitome of hole in the wall. Literally, it has a small sign and a door that leads into another small space, where you give your name & party (or reservation, like we did). Then, you step into the restaurant and it's literally one of the fanciest places I've ever set foot in. Everybody is dressed like they're attending a cocktail party for the President, and the clientele is very classy and upscale. At the bar, people were drinking champagne out of skinny glasses.... there were no beer bottles to be found. The conversations going on in the restaurant were quiet in themselves, but contributed to the overall buzz over the smooth jazz that was playing. We were seated promptly in a semicircle booth and our waiter came to introduce himself and the restaurant. He was really chill and friendly, and explained the dishes we wanted clarification on. Also, he said he only had one dish to recommend -- the elote style corn, and since I had seen it multiple times on Yelp & Foursquare reviews, I decided to split one with my friend. In my opinion, it was better than regular corn, but it wasn't all the hype that I had read from fellow yelpers. Zesty and oddly spiced, it was great but not amazing, like I had expected it to be. I also ordered the steak frites, which was so good. 10 oz is great. The steak with the steak butter went together perfectly -- like a harmonic medley of flavors in your mouth. Ask for garlic butter with your fries.. that was great, too. For dessert, we had the whiskey ice cream, which tasted like a coffee mocha ice cream, with an aftertaste of whiskey. Overall, my experience here was spectacular. Although I felt a bit out of place with my age and my outfit, it was definitely a great dinner with my friends. Prices were pretty good for such a classy restaurant -- around $28 for the steak frites & $7 for the corn, and I was definitely impressed by the service & food."
"Without a doubt I found the restaurant I have always dreamed about. Once you open the door, you feel like if a time machine transported you into a romantic, yet classy 1940s french restaurant, big beautiful chandeliers and dim lights. We were seated in a cozy booth with leather chairs. Even though people were dressed nicely the ambiance was casual and relaxing. Our waiter was really nice and was paying attention to every detail on the table. My hubby and I shared their aged ribeye (22 ounces), what a SUPERB sear it had my God!, so juicy and flavorful, it was the best piece of steak we have ever had!. We asked for three sides (they are charged separately), french fries (fancy name: pomme frites) that come with a garlic aioli that it was to die for, cole slaw (a little bit sweet and creamy with a champagne vinaigrette) and the last one was Elote style corn (it had an orange color because of the chile (mild spicy) also a little bit creamy with some lemon and parmesan cheese on it. We loved everything. We are trying to come up with any kind of excuse to go to chicago so that we can visit my dream restaurant again....ahhhhh (sighs) I am in love......"
"The service was great here and I really liked the decor of this place. The overall atmosphere gave our dinner date a real romantic feeling to it. I also loved the 1920's vibe with jazz music playing in the background and all the wait staff was dressed very appropriate to the theme.I give this place a good rating because it was easy for us to get a table, but that was probably because it was the only place opened during the winter advisory for the extreme cold winter conditions. While everybody else decided to stay closed, it didn't keep the vigilant few from enjoying their night.The food was also really good, we got a bottle of wine, Lamb Shank, Fillet Mignon Petite, Pomme Frites, and Chocolate Cream Pie. Everything was good except this place lost my 5 star review because everything was over salted. We even had a side of seasoned salt to go with our over salted meal which we found very odd.But overall, it was an excellent place to have a romantic date. However keep in mind, it is not for the light wallets."
"Last night was my second visit to Bavette's, so now I can say with 100% certainty that of the ~110 restaurants that I have hit since moving to Chicago six months ago, this is the best meal I have had in the city.The atmosphere is perfect, especially if it's a date or a dinner with your parents...the service is amazing, and the food is incredible.I've had all of the following and recommend them all:  the fried chicken, the steak frites, the 6 oz. duchess cut, the shaved prime beef sandwich, the Elote-style corn, the broccoli, the thick cut bacon, the wedge salad, and the baked crab cake.  We have taken down the chocolate cream pie and the lemon meringue pie...spectacular.But even better than the amazing food, at least for a cocktail guy like myself, were the drinks.  Bavette's Punch, the Lion's Tail and the Cognac Sazerac all have me already moving to OpenTable to book another dinner.Love, love, love this restaurant.  Even the value proposition is fair...there are a good number of dishes under $20 on this menu in case you go with a friend who likes to go cheap when he/she goes out for a nice meal."
"The atmosphere here is amazing(low lit, flickering candles); its perfect for a romantic night out.   The service we received was nice but a little over bearing.  I don't want someone to refill my water every time I take a sip and interrupt my conversation every few minutes.  I also felt really uncomfortable (not with being at a fancy place-- this girl knows how to dine) but with the staff staring at you the entire time you're dining. It was a bit off putting. My boyfriend loved dinner, he said the Chicago style steak he got was pretty amazing. It was a great cut of meat, and offering the steak salt at the table was a great touch.  The stroganoff  was just okay, I was really disappointed.  The hand cut fettuccine was tough, and while the short-rib was tender-- too tender if that is possible, it was basically mush with no actual taste.   We did receive a free glass of wine which was a nice touch.  Apparently, if you bring your own bottle there, they require you to share a glass.  Which the manager, or whom ever, randomly decides who to share with.  That was a nice touch.  I still think I  prefer the sister of this place (Gilt, and owned by the same people) for a romantic night, its right down the street and has the same atmosphere. But if you're planning on skipping Bavette's and still want good steak  you might as well  to Sullivan's."
"I was able to make a reservation via OpenTable the week of my Friday evening reservation. And I believe I will be back, but only if I was in the neighborhood.I enjoyed my steak frites ($25) immensely--it was seared perfectly and was a juicy, medium-rare inside. The bearnaise sauce was a fine complement to the thickly, cut fries.Service was on the ball--prompt and attentive. We swiftly ordered drinks and entrees, and was brought out a basket of bread and butter.  My cocktail was the ""Have a Heart"" and it was satisfying. Loved the atmosphere--exposed brick walls, giant hanging chandelier, and soft touches everywhere.Cheers!"
"Had a great time here! Sat at the bar and were well taken care of by Joel. His recommendations were perfect, from the wine to main dishes, to the epic creamed spinach. This place is now on my list of favorites!"
"I rarely give 5 stars. It's rare you truly feel that you got what you paid for. I've been to Bavettes a few different times. I most recently took a friend who was in town from NYC. We had a couple of ribeyes and the steaks were seasoned perfectly. Taste was great and they came out at the desired temps. You must order the bacon here, it's life changing. Also the sweet potato is off the charts amazing.  I really don't have a bad thing to say about this place. For that reason...5 stars"
"Amazing decor and ambiance! I really liked the setting!Service was bad, I felt like I was not welcomed at all.Food: a steakhouse wanna be, the quality is not there, choice grade beef sold at prime beef prices, just not there!"
"Wow this place is good!! I had the steak and it was so juicy and tender, accompanied by the corn, it was simply an explosion of delicious flavor a in my mouth. Loved this place. If I go back to Chicago, I will go back for sure!"
"WELL..... I had a shockingly disappointing experience the other night.  My friend was so excited to bring us here based on her great first visit.  Reservations are difficult, probably in part due to the review in Chicago Magazine.  The space is adorable.  Not your traditional steakhouse feel....The bar area reminds me of Maudes (which I love) but darker in color.  Service was a big problem.  I have dined at Maudes and Au Cheval several times each, and service has always been helpful and attentive.  My friend was told at the bar that she could sit at one of the sofas and a server would come for drink orders.  No one arrived in 15 minutes.  We were seated at the first booth (super chilly there, I might add, as the staff kept propping the door open).  Our server seemed to want to be somewhere else and had plenty of sarcastic remarks. I think he felt he was funny. Super disappointed.  He did not follow up regularly to check on us and took FOREVER taking our dessert order and bringing the check.  The whole meal was over 2 hours!Another word on service.  The staff member brought our steaks (about 5-7 min after ordered) before we were even given the promised bread service.  Super odd.  Even more odd was that the person delivering the steaks placed them in front of the wrong people.  When we told her that she did not have them in the proper place, she did not really care and told us to cut into them with her there to see if they were cooked properly (all ordered differently).  When the server finally did show up, he felt two of our steaks were overcooked (they were!) and did offer to take them back.  I feel very uncomfortable sending food back to the kitchen.  I also feel uncomfortable with the fact that the steaks were overcooked at a steak restaurant and that at this price point, the staff did not know which dish went to which person.  The steak was average for a high end Chicago steakhouse.The sides were good.  Loved the corn!  Beautiful and delicious.  The bacon was tasty, but not the best I have ever had.  The aoli on the frites was super yummy.  The chocolate cream pie was AMAZING!  You need to save room for this dessert or share with your dining partners.  A real gem!!"
"Thanks to my lovely Yelp friends and their crazy good reviews, I chose to dine here.  And loooooooved it.After making a reservation via Opentable, I needed to call them and add another guest onto the reservation.  The person who answered made me feel dumb bc I didn't know the difference between the parlor and the upstairs dining area.  That aside, I am glad we were seated downstairs in the parlor because it oozed sexiness.My girlfriends and I tried several cocktails, but I particularly loved their sparkling rose.  We started with the baked goat cheese, which came with slices of toasty, crusty bread.  Followed up with some oysters.  I went with the braised veal cheeks....sooo rich and delicious.  My friends both selected the beef stroganoff, which was an elegant version of what mom used to make.   Sorry mom, but Bavette's stroganoff is way better! The chocolate cream pie is simply amazing.  It's truly a chocolate lovers dessert.  Very rich, and well executed.  We loved the huge quenelle of lightly sweetened whipped cream.    It added a fun whimsy element.  Service was excellent.  bartenders were beardy.  Decor is killer.  Love. this. place."
"The other reviews don't even do this place justice! Miraculously, we got a reservation (after checking the day before and none were available). I picked the place to celebrate my birthday, and wow was it a great decisions! First, the ambience is amazing - dark wood, low lights, exposed brick and 1950's feel. Secondly, great, prompt service. Our waitress was friendly and answered our questions patiently (including what a ""goldbrick sundae"" was - it's an ice cream sundae with a chocolate shell and pecans). Third, the FOOD. The bread they have is amazing (I would have gone for the bread alone) - thick, soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside. For dinner we had the stroganoff (me), steak frites (brother in law) and the ribeye (my sister). We got the broccoli, corn and creamed spinach. Our ratings were: stroganoff A; ribeye A+; steak frites A+; corn A+; creamed spinach A; broccoli B. Definitely recommend!!"
"I almost got turned off....almost. I knew i was gonna have a big dinner date here so i kinda saved my appetite for the dinner. My reservation was at 8pm. Being super hungry and excited to have some juicy steak i expected to be seated right away. Especially when my dinner date was on a tuesday night.Well...it didnt exactly happen that way. Even with a 2 week in advance reservation, I had to wait a lil over half an hour for my table. Didn't wanna drink so my hubs and i were just kinda lingeringgg around the bar. Hungry. Grumpy me. Then.....things completely turned when the host finally called us up for our table. I was a lil distracted to pay too much attention to the ambiance then, but now thinking bout it, the ambiance was nice. Very rustic coffee tables, leather couches, dimmed lights, sexy looking cocktails...somewhere Don Draper would take his business associates...for some reason all the guys were wearing blazers and suits..maybe coz it was a tuesday. anywayy..FOOD!!!Buttermilk fried chicken---crispy and delightful. Been craving these so it was perfect. I loved their ranch sauce too. Fantastic.Oysters-East, west. wtv. loved em all. Creamy Spinach/caramelized onion-was okay. My husband was a big fan, it was alright to me.The rib eye steak------OMG. SPEECHLESS. LOVE. medium rare is how i like mine. Melted in my mouth. Didnt need anything, but the bernaise was also delicious with it. Explosion in my mouth.The Chocolate Cream pie-WARNING! YOU ARE NOT TOO FULL TO EAT THIS.MUST HAVE.Basically ate this it hurts. Rib Eye, Fried Chicken, and chocolate cream pie were the star of the show hands down.Oh! service was good. I liked the server. He insisted that i have the choc cream pie which is a total win.That's all folks. Go for it."
"My new favorite restaurant in the city!  The food, ambiance, service were all top  notch. The 24 oz Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye and thought it was fantastic. and plenty to split with a friend. Also enjoyed the Lillet Rose Martini with St Germain..it was yummy!  The corn had a little to  much sauce for my liking but was still very good and the broccoli was charred a bit and excellent. Wasn't able to get reservations on line but was seated right away when we arrived around 5:30 on a week day.The dining area is dark and sexy and cozy and fun....especially the room downstairs.Definitely going back again!"
"Best Steak in Chicago hands down, and I've tried em all! My favorite restaurant in the city."
"Phenomenal ribeye and filet, Great atmosphere, Excellent service. Best steak I've had in Chicago."
"Was there with a group of 7 and had the most amazing service, by the end of the night some how my cell phone had slipped behind the built-in booth (7 bottles of wine might of contributed).  The staff and especially manager went above and beyond their way to make sure that my phone was retrieved the following day by having the booth taken apart.  Just fantastic service and especially Food - can't ask for more! Thanks again Amie -"
"Outstanding! Killer atmosphere, great drinks and staff. Epic wedge salad with two pieces of house-cured bacon speared to the lettuce with a steak knife. Out of this world steak -- I got the Ribeye Au Poivre. Seriously one of the best steaks I've had worldwide. Save room for malt whiskey ice cream with hot fudge. Can't wait to try out some of the sister restaurants next time I'm in town."
"What a great Chicago experience!! Jazz playing the whole meal with the awesome dark wood and low light speak easy feel.  We started with the Oysters and Shrimp de Jonge.  Oysters were fresh and sweet.  Tasty with Crystal hot sauce, a nice mignonette sauce, and cocktail sauce.  The shrimp were awesome in more of a marsala garlic sauce rather than your typical De Jonge.  Awesome Texas toast to soak up that sauce too!Their Wedge salad is the best I've ever had.  BBBBBBBACON was outstanding, incredible, unbelievable.  Their nice use of dill with egg and a soft milder blue cheese was so perfect.  Really perfect.  The black pepper BBBBBBACON!!!!!!! was heavenly.Their 30 day dry age bone in ribeye was pretty awesome.  Nice aged flavor cooked perfect and seasoned well.  We topped ours with fresh roasted BBBBBBBBone Marrow!!!!!!!!   Bone Marrow is like meat butter but made in heaven.  Try it!!!Elote corn side was a fantastic pairing to the rich meat.  The lime chili really cut through the beefy goodness and offered great contrast.  A great side dish for sure!Ended with the whiskey ice cream everybody was raving about.  It's truly as good as they all say.  So remember...make reservations for a booth!!!  Booths appeared more confortable than the table.  Try anything with their incredible bacon.  Get dry aged meat and Whiskey ice cream.My only knock was my Martini was sooooo weak sauce.  It wasn't filled to the brim.  I asked for it extra dry and it tasted watered down. :(Chicago Magazine named this place #2 steak house in Chicago.  It lives up to it.  If I am ever lucky enough to see my arse back to this place it will surely be a blessing."
"Rib eye was great don't spend the money on the prime the choice was worth it. The sides all had great flavor but the corn and sweet potato were the best. Make sure you try the drink""crush"" one of the most unique gin drinks ever."
"Came here for a late dinner and sat downstairs. I loved the ambiance: dark, good music, candles. The server was very attentive and our drinks came out right away. The food didn't take too long and everything was delicious. I will definitely be going back!"
"I brought a date here on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed. The servers were attentive and not pretentious, and the price was way better than a lot of other steakhouses in the city. Their bread and butter that they serve is amazing, but do not fill up on it because once you taste one of their steaks it melts in your mouth and is cooked to perfection. Also you can try one of their burgers, but if you do ask them to caramelize the onions and your palette can thank me later."
"Bavette ' s is my favorite of all the hogsalt restaurant group. It has the same quality food and drinks, but the atmosphere seems more interesting."
"I'm thinking back to my dinner last Sunday at Bavette's Bar and Boeuf, listening to ""Thugz Mansion"" by Nas. Bavette's was many things, all very good. The restaurant is warm and inviting, from the anachronistic music to the placement of tables, the leather, open kitchen, lighting. At first I was on edge because the hostess was on the telephone and ushered in through the door saying we would be taken care of- she was right. The female manager greeted and seated us. The server was not intrusive and positive, with good ambient feedback. We started with cocktail shrimps- there's some good details in the simplicity of the taste and presentation that made these right there with the best shrimp I have ever had. They are perfectly cleaned, presented on a plat du mer covered with perfectly ground ice granules and seaweed, with citrus and sauces. I was impressed. Girlfriend's negroni was flawless, the ice in my Diet Coke was kold draft cubes. The caesar salad had lots of smoky fish and salty potato chips; I was like Wang Chi in Big Trouble in Little China: ""I got a very positive attitude about this.""The bussers were true warriors, raised in the hood. The blond beachwood table was completely cleared between courses. They employed an individual wiping cloth for both my girlfriend and me. We split a steak for the mains. The ribeye was the definition of a pre-Nixon steak. I don't have a lot of experience with top quality steaks, but this steak was unbelievable. Cooked to perfection, juicy, thick, richly seasoned. The kind of steak that makes me want to call my vegan sister to apologize. We got the loaded potato. I stopped the waiter, paused, looking at the potato the size of a football. I asked, ""Is that thing organic?"" and the waiter replied that it was an organic potato. We loaded the beast with the same grizzly bacon that comes on the burger at Au Cheval, sour cream, and cheese. By this point Bavette's had already won the title of my best meal in 2013. The rich and savory chocolate cream pie topped with the hugest quenelle I have ever seen was nevertheless light enough to somehow disappear in the night, and we followed. Bavette, if I could only have one more dance with you mama."
"Came here with my wife to celebrate our first trip to Chicago after reading the great reviews.  We didn't have a reservation but we arrived early (5:30) and they sat us almost immediately.Honestly, you cannot oversell this place.  The atmosphere, service, drinks, and food were all exceptional.  We ordered the wedge salad with thick bacon as an appetizer and split the delmonico strip steak (mid-rare).  The blue cheese dressing was excellent and the bacon was unlike any we've ever tasted before.  The steak was perfectly seasoned and seared on the outside while tender and juicy on the inside.  Absolute perfection.  I also had a baked sweet potato with butter and brown sugar that was so good it tasted more like a desert than a side dish.We are returning to Chicago in November and have already booked a reservation to come back.  If you are looking for somewhere special, look no further.  This was the best meal (both experience and food) that I've ever had.  A+ all the way around!!"
"I cannot express how much I love this place. This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I fully understand how big of a statement that is, and I stand by it. I am a bartender in the city in nearby bars and I ALWAYS recommend this to people visiting from out of town or people who generally ask me where to go besides my place of employment. My go to on the menu is the petit filet. Which is like heaven. I do not care what you say about other steak houses..... this is THE best steak I have ever had. And not just one time. EVERY SINGLE TIME I I COME HERE. The bread. Dear lord. It takes like jesus made it. Give me five baskets please. I have sampled many other items on the menu because the filet. Every dish is amazing. I literally do not think you can go wrong. I stick to an old fashioned or champagne. I have been with groups or ordered bottles of wine or champagne, or people ordering off of the drink menu. My most recent trip was this past monday when I was catching up with an old friend. The bartender (with the accent... sorry I dont remember your name! male...? ) was very friendly and attentive but not overbearing. He did not flinch when I asked him to please muddle my orange and cherry in my drink. Benjamin was our server and he was absolutely lovely. I would describe him the same was, attentive but not overbearing. Which is exactly what you are looking for. He answered all of my friends questions and had a great energy to him. Thumbs up to both. ( I know monday shifts can be tough and I am pretty sure we were his last table.) I would say in the past I have had some slight grievances with the bartenders being unhelpful/snooty/slow but it is super dependent on the person and day of the week. Some have been fantastic and some have been awful ( like flat out refusing to muddle my orange and cherry.... I am industry, so I am super polite and acknowledge it is annoying. I am patient as well.) This happened several times over last spring and summer so I do not know if those individuals work there anymore. But even when that happened, the food was so sensational I did not care. I do not want to discount the many times bartenders and servers have been amazing. There was even a time wehn my steak was rare ( not medium as ordered) and they promptly and without question took it back to cook more. The food runners and hostesses are always polite and helpful as well. All around absolutely amazing. I will continue to tell the many many many people I speak to on a weekly basis to go here. YOU SHOULD TOO. Reservations are a must though!!!!"
"IMPORTANT NOTE: our group had a VERY DISAPPOINTING encounter with the manager that I will discuss first.  Once seated, our experience was tremendous and will be discussed a bit later.Upon our impromptu arrival at 10:30ish, our group was told that we could be seated at two different tables as there were no optimal seating for us.  Some members of our group were met with some attitude from the manager, a young lady whose name I did not get.  I then perused the dining room and discovered a spot that would be more ideal from our group.  When I tried to request this spot, the manager tried to sway me to another spot, which we ultimately accepted.  However, her tone was condescending, inflexible, and downright inappropriate coming from the manager of a fine establishment.  I found her to be combative and short and it was NO way to start our experience, which for many in our group was our first at Bavette's.  NOTE TO THE OWNERS / MANAGERS - CLEAN IT UP.Server:Upon, seating, our server Eric was great.  He had the timing and personality that exuded comedian, knew the menu very well, was forthcoming with key information about kitchen closings, and treated us well.  He should be applauded and rewarded for turning our experience around.Food:Bomb.com.  I ordered the griddled burger and hash browns and left my plates clean.  Our group ordered an array of things from the stellar white fish caesar salad to the duck, from the broccoli to the pomme frites.  Everyone was in agreement - the chefs put their feet in that meal.Ambience:Jazz on jazz on jazz.  Coltrane, Davis, you name it.  It was remarkable for a jazz lover and apparently there are some nights where there is live jazz.I'll be back for sure.PS: Au Cheval, under the same management, is also on point."
"My husband and I only get to Chicago a few times every couple of years... so it says something that we've booked reservations at Bavette's for both of our last two trips.  The food here is instantly and irrevocably craveable.   From the salad (oh, the bacon!) to the amazing aged steak (split this, it's HUGE), to the satisfying sides (try the corn, seriously), and finish up with a some sweets (though you'll be forcing it down by now because you'll be so full).    We loved our old-fashioned cocktails and the staff is great at recommending an accompanying wine.It's pricy, but from the moment you walk through the ""speak-easy"" style entry way and step back into an era from 100 years ago you'll be charmed, entranced, and totally in love."
"I returned last night -a Tuesday-for an early dinner with a friend after work.  I ordered the beef stroganoff--to die for--it earned a new review with an additional star. Still love the warm sourdough bread. We split the crab cake appetizer which was excellent. To top off our diet plates (insert roaring laugh), we each had French press coffee (perfect) and split the whiskey ice cream (also perfect)."
"We picked Bavette's for our anniversary dinner because 3 Year Traditional Gift = Leather = Steak. We had a 9:15 reservation. We arrived on time and we were told that they were waiting for a few tables to clear. So we sat in the bar. And sat. And sat. We ordered cocktails, which were tasty. But it took quite a while to get them. We finally were sat at our table at 9:50 ... as if our reservation had been at 9:50. In other words, no apologies, no comped drinks or starters, no ""thank you for waiting."" Nothing. So already I was irked. I expected better.Service at the table (which was squished in a corner resulting in hubby being bumped multiple times) did not improve. Our server was borderline obnoxious and it wasn't long before we were ready to just get our check and go.I was and still am very conflicted because the food (with exception of the garlic shrimp appetizer -- good sauce and brad, really overcooked shrimp) was great. The stroganoff was comforting comfort food and hubby said that his 24 oz rib eye was the best steak he's ever had. But ""meh I've experienced better"" sums it up for me because I have had exponentially better experiences ... at Maude's, Au Cheval and Gilt.Speaking of Gilt, I did try to order a chocolate cream pie (to go) at the end of the evening. After we placed the order, d-bag waiter returned to say that we just missed the last one but if we go to Gilt just down the street we can get one there because that's where the pies are made. Thanks jerk off. By the way, he says this after making an unsolicited comment that he liked the card that hubby got me better than the one that I got hubby. Gee, didn't remember asking but thanks anyway now bug off. Oh and what you're saying is that if we had been seated on time, I would be heading home with my hubby (and his superior card) on our anniversary to go relax on our couch with a movie, more wine and a piece of chocolate cream pie ... but instead if I want the pie I have to go down the street. I'll pass. Thanks.I don't know what the theme of anniversary dinner will be next year, but hopefully we have better results..."
Food and atmosphere here a great. As we ordered one thing after another it got better and better. Apps are great entrees perfect and desserts blow away. Our server Joe made the night!
"I went to this place after it has been on my to do list for a long while, I actually went there twice the first time the kitchen was closed and just bar was open the other time it had a long wait, after all I made a reservation in the midweek and went there for dinner with my wife.We waited for while till we get seated although it was not busy at all, I am not sure why, and it took the server quite a bit tell he took the drinks order. Anyways the ambiance was one of a kind.Our server was very attentive which I liked, we told him about our diet restriction of pork and alcohol and he was well knowledgeable about what dishes had them and which didn't. We found out that everything fried in a pork fat which crossed half the menu even the Caesar salad as it had crispy chips instead of croutons, so we just skipped the appetizer and the salad.We had the petite filet which was phenomenal specially with the sauce, my wife had it medium plus and I had it medium both were cooked exactly the way we like. They actually were very tender to the extent that they almost melted in our mouths  but I would say it tastes different than the typical steak in other steakhouses.We had the corn side which was good it tasted like an Indonesian corn salad we are familiar with, and had mashed potato which was amazing.I would love to visit bavette again, although I wished they hadn't use pork fat to fry cause the fried chicken looked very tempting."
"excellent steak house food and ambiance.  started with bone marrow (giant pieces) with a perfect red onion jam and parsley on the bread, like a liquidy foie. also had smoked salmon caesar.  shared Prime Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye -- pretty much done to perfection with easy to slice pieces, prepared as a medium, excellent salting and darkened outside, fatty savory inside.  3 people can share two steaks, as we also had the prime filet bone in as well, which was not fatty but went well with the salt and bernaise sauce.  ribeye is the better cut.  elote corn side only problem was the corn not crisp kernels.  butternut squash grilled with bourbon, sage was excellent.  definitely come here, over David Burke's"
"I don't just go around giving out 5 stars, but I would give Bavette's 10 if I could.Whatever you do make sure you get the shrimp de jonghe as an appetizer. It's AMAZING.I really like the atmosphere, with the old school speakeasy vibe, and jazz tunes. The steak frites, strogonoff, and spinach were all great dishes.Oh the whiskey ice cream....oh man.Can't wait to go back for more."
"My wife and I dined here on 2/20 to celebrate our anniversary. The ambiance is quite nice, similar to Maude's Liquor Bar. We started with cocktails. I had an Old Fashioned and my wife had the Lillet Rose martini, and both were excellent. We moved on to a shrimp cocktail for starters, which is (I believe) exactly the same as the offering at Maude's - a good thing. The shrimp were perfect, and the presentation was wonderful. However, we had shellfish tower envy of the tables around us, so we definitely need to try that on a future visit. For entrees, my wife went with the steak frites and I had the Chicago cut ribeye. Hers was excellent. Love that they use a flatiron cut, and it was beefy and cooked to medium rare perfection. The frites were equally awesome. My steak was tough, flavorless, and overcooked. I should have sent it back, but I didn't. Major letdown.For sides, we went with the creamed spinach and elote style corn. The spinach was wonderful and had a nice crust from the broiler on it that was almost like a brûlée topping. The corn, as many reviewers have noted is wonderful. For dessert we went with the malted whiskey ice cream. Get this! It's so good. Service was standard and attentive. Everyone was pleasant. At the end of the day, I'm rating this fairly low for my steak, but hope to make it back and give it another shot. That said, for a place that hangs its reputation on steaks, they let me down in a big (and fairly expensive) way."
"The restaurant is very impressive, beautiful. The food is also pretty good but I ordered a medium rare stake and came medium. My wife ordered a medium and it came medium rare. Not a big issue at all specially because both stakes were delicious. They should have less expensive wines to offer."
"I really dislike steak houses. A good steak is not worth the sacrifice of the tacky ambiance, high prices, and the mediocre sides and seafood that I associate with traditional Chicago steak houses. While Bavette's is indeed, in a way, a steak house (and will probably still appeal to anyone who is a steak house fan), there were definitely no sacrifices required here. This was such a perfect cozy place to warm up on a frigid, snowy Chicago night. Bavette's is dim and swanky, but  round red leather couches, vest-wearing bartenders, and huge chandeliers give it a bit of relaxed old-school rusticness. And, while it's right next door to Gilt and also owned by the Hogsalt Group, you can actually hear yourself think in here. After starting off with drinks from the well-stocked bar (including an incredibly rich cognac sazerac - highly recommended), we started off with the larger of the seafood platters. The expectations were not high in a landlocked state in the dead of winter, but everything was pretty damn good - the salmon ceviche and west coast oysters were standouts. It was definitely a generous amount of seafood, but we plowed ahead and shared a few dishes afterwards, including the delicious and incredibly reasonably-priced burger ($9.95), the super-tender beef tongue, and the rich foie gras terrine (accompanied by a heavenly sweet blackberry jam).Why not 5 stars? Everything was super salty. No one dish was necessarily ruined by the salt (except perhaps the frites, which were not only over-salted but also soft, doughy, and greasy), but everyone felt pretty bloated after just sharing a few bites of every dish. I can't imagine eating an entire entree plus an appetizer here. Also, single bathrooms for a restaurant this size? Not cool. Bottom line - Screw tradition; this is definitely the best ""steak house"" in Chicago."
"Delicious! The ambiance and decor is very typical for the owner. The service was impeccable and servers gave enough guidance on the menu. The food was fantastic!! Oysters, salmon tartar, shrimp, aged rib-eyes and chocolate cream pie~~ heavy but worth every bite! Earned its rank as one of the best steaks in Chicago:)"
"I am giving this four stars, which I think may be a bit generous, and here is why.  Our first trip was for dinner with another couple back in December.  Great atmosphere, very good service, great drinks.  Food was great (peppered duck and goat cheese, crab stuffed avocado salad), until the steak I ordered medium came out well-done.  Everyone elses steak came out impeccable and stupidly I did not send it back, but rather ate it.  So that is on me.  I view this as a one-off error and probably not a reflection of a continued occurance at Bavette's.We came back in February for drinks with another couple for drinks, so we went to the downstairs bar area.  It was only 9pm on a Thursday and we sat in the bar area (not the booths along the perimeter).  Waiter was slow to bring drink menus and the drinks, and when asked if we could order a light appetizer he said ""no, food is only for the perimeter seats.""  We asked to speak with the manager of the restaurant as this seemed strange, especially since we were looking to order foie gras, not a whole entree or anything.  The manager came and relayed that it was the executive chef who told him no food was to be served at the inside bar area downstairs, but if we need anything else, please let him know.  We said ""fine, whatever,"" and kept drinking.  Anyway, bill comes and its double what it should have been because the waiter gave us some other tables bill.  When we told him about, he had a bit of an attitude.  Not our fault guy - its yours!  So if you go to Bavettes and are hungry, make sure to eat upstairs in the main dining, or downstairs along the perimeter.  If you are in the downstairs unreserved bar area, No Snack for You!"
"Hands down the best meal I had on my vacation.  At once classic, but, yet completely modern.  We sat downstairs in the lower eating area with dark lighting and electonica playing.  Excellent steak, comforting stroganoff, even better duck terrine, and marrow so yummy that I almost licked the plate and seriously contemplated ordering another.  This place is so good.  If I lived anywhere near Chicago this would be my go-to steakhouse."
"Absolutely loved Bavette's, new Chicago favorite.Roasted marrow is fantastic! Comes paired with a tasty caramelized red onion jam. Smoked whitefish Caesar - easily the best Caesar I've ever had - amazing flavor. The crispy potato adds perfect texture to the salad.Makes great old fashioneds - friends enjoyed a round while I enjoyed a negroni. Good selection of champagne cocktails if you're craving something lighter. Cozy lounge downstairs looks interesting - recommend checking out."
"Hands down the best meal I've had in a long time. From start to finish everything was amazing.  We didn't have a reservation but we decided to try our luck and walked in around 6pm on a Monday evening and were fortunate enough to get seated right away.  So, let's just get right down to it, here's a breakdown of the food:Sourdough Bread- I know, it's odd that I'm reviewing the free bread they serve at every table, but I just had to give it a little shoutout because it was delicious.  I love sourdough bread, and their's was warm with a thick crust on the outside and soft pillowy goodness on the inside.Elote Style Corn- I'm so glad I saw the yelp reviews before ordering here because this was the most amazing corn dish I've ever had! It was basically like creamed corn but in a queso cheese sauce instead of cream.  It was creamy and rich with just a hint of spiciness from the cheese, which was balanced beautifully with the sweetness and freshness of the corn. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!Hash Browns- These were the most sophisticated hash browns I've ever had! They were crispy and savory, with a slightly sweet caramelized onion topping.  They tasted really good but were definitely very heavy, I almost felt a little greasy after a few bites so I left it at that.  I'm glad to have tasted them but would skip them next time. Green beans- Felt like we needed something relatively healthy on the table ;)Bone in ribeye- This steak is definitely one of my top two ribeyes ever!  I usually order my steak medium rare but I asked the server how their med rare was and he said red in the center so I got it medium instead. And it was cooked perfectly!  It had a delicious crusty char on the outside and was so tender and juicy on the inside.  And it had the perfect amount of marbling to make it rich but not too fatty.  Sooooo good!Roasted Chicken- Both the server and hostess recommended the chicken so my coworker decided to try it, and she couldn't stop raving about it.  I had a bite, and normally I think chicken is just whatever but I have to say that this was probably the most delicious chicken I've ever tasted. It was moist, tender and flavorful, it was the chicken equivalent of my steak!  Prime Beef Sandwich and Pork Chop- These are what my other coworkers ordered and they both loved their entrees as well.  Ice cream- We ordered the whiskey ice cream based on the reviews and once again I was not disappointed! I don't even know how to describe it, it didn't taste like booze but there was just the most subtlest hint of the whiskey flavor.  It wasn't too rich,  it was smooth, creamy, and sweet, but not overly so.  The service we received was also great.  Our server was attentive and made some really great suggestions, and our water glasses were always full.  The only bad thing about Bavette's is that it's about 1800 miles from where I live :(  I may have to make a special trip out to Chicago just to eat at Bavette's again!"
"So flipping delish.  We've eaten here twice - upstairs, and downstairs.Downstairs has the same menu as upstairs, but the vibe is very different.  Upstairs is kind of turn-of-the-century, a little loud, vaulted ceilings.  Downstairs is shorter ceilings, candlelight, quieter, and more modern.  Not thumping music or anything, but definitely not the same vintage decor.  More like vintage touches.The food is incredible.  Steak, appetizers, salads, beef burgundy, frites -- all amazing.  Cocktails are EXCELLENT.I'm pulling it down one star because it's just so freaking dark.  Both times I've barely been able to see my friends across the table."
"Go, make the reservation... asap... Not kidding :)This place has ""it"" nailed.  From the decor, to the atmosphere, the food, to the cocktails; Bavette's is top notch.Atmosphere:  Opposite of pretentious, more like warm but still upscale classy.  The dark old school dimly lit feel makes it romantic and almost like you're at a steak house from the show Boardwalk Empire. Service:  Brandon was my speed, attentive, not overly involved - but just enough, apologetic & acknowledged a mistake, 5 out of 5Food:  This is a last meal on earth kind of place; Shrimp De Jonghe, Arugula/Beet Salad, 10 oz Filet - med rare - delicious, 24 oz bone in rib eye - WOW.... Steaks were prepared perfectly.  As for sides we went with the thick cut bacon, mashed potatoes, and Elote style corn.  Even the bread and butter were good.  On the cocktail menu I had the best dark and stormy I've ever had.Total Bill = $280 after a generous tip, so do it up right here, it's worth every penny"
"Wow, wow, wow! As good as it gets. By far the greatest dining experience my wife and I have had in the last 5 years. Absolutely perfect! Wife and I sought this place out as our official Anniversary Dinner spot after our diligent research of so many Chicago restaurants. It was absolutely perfect! Pricey but worth it and in the end so good it feels more like an investment rather than a purchase. No joke. The drinks were creative and dead on. The service was top notch!They delivered in every way. Oysters were perfect and a great surprise on the menu. The Goat Cheese dip was phenomenal! My Aged Rib Eye was possible the greatest piece of meat I've ever devoured. No lie this was the highlight of my entire trip to Chicago. This steak was just perfect. Wife got the Filet and that was to die for. It was extremely romantic in there with the low light and candles on each tables and even on some presented dishes. This felt like a what I envisioned a new-aged Chicago style steakhouse. The perfect place for an anniversary dinner. Thanks you guys for a wonderful experience. We have told everyone we know about Bavette's!"
"This place feels like a 1920s speakeasy.  The walls are brick, the lighting is low, and you'll feel out of place here unless you're wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a machine gun in a violin case.  Started with the beef tongue, then the shortrib stroganoff, and the classic ribeye.  Beef tongue melted in your mouth, the way it's supposed to.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly too, but the real standout was the stroganoff.  I don't know what kind of high-grade crack cocaine they sprinkled on it, but it definitely did the trick.  Great for special occasions when you just feel like wearing a suit and pretending Prohibition hasn't been repealed yet"
Lamb T-bone was awesome.had the maitre'd butter which was amazing.Also the oysters on the half shell were good but were pricey and were a small serving
"Did not make a reservation.  The wait was long (1.5 hours).  But be sure to ask for the ""free wine daily"" that they have posted on the wall to get a free glass of wine.  The food itself was not worth the wait.  typical steakhouse quality, which means good.  but nothing spectacular.  I had the Chicago Cut steak, and my wife had the Short-rib Stroganoff.  The Stroganoff noodles were a bit undercooked, but still edible.  The stuffed potato however was good.  Overall, I would say decent/good quality....but not worth the wait or the $$$."
"This was the cutest restaurant! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried it.I was nervous pulling up to it because you can barely spot the door from the street and there was street construction going on it so easily looks like a hole in the wall from the outside. You walk into a little hostess stand room that is separate from the restaurant so you can't see what the place looks like right away...but as soon as you open the next door it's a beautiful ambiance! There is brick wall, dim/dark lighting, and looks very classy. Our waiter was amazing and so helpful in picking out dishes. We tried the beef tongue and as gross as it might sound to describe this way, it melted in your mouth! It tasted very good and I was happy I tried it. The broccoli side was huge heads of broccoli and was also very tasty. I ordered a petite filet and while I've had better, I was still happy with it. I will try a non-steak entrée the time I visit. We ordered the chocolate cream pie which comes with whip cream. I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream as I think every chocolate dessert should come with that! I was glad I did. I want to emphasize again, LOVE the look and feel of this place!"
"Bavette's is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago right now. Everything from the service to decor to menu is top notch. I'm a huge fan of the 20s inspired ambiance, so that's a huge plus for me. It's a very intimate setting, perfect for a date. I ordered the pork chop, which practically melted in my mouth with every bite. My boyfriend ordered the ribeye, which was also amazing. He ordered it with the bone marrow, which I wasn't a huge fan of, but I'm generally not a fan of bone marrow. The service was excellent, food came within minutes, and the experience was overall excellent. I cannot wait to go back."
Awesome service & food! Nice cozy decor with exposed brick walls. Started off with peppered duck goat cheese terrine appetizer which turned out to be  our favorite item from menu! We also ordered beef tongue & beef stroganoff for entrees and corn & fries as sides. Food was a little on the heavier side but all were pretty good. Still the appetizer & sourdough bread were the stars of the night! I would definitely return next time I'm in Chicago!
"Outstanding as expected. We met someone here and thoughly enjoyed the whole experience. Cocktails were very well done, especially liked my dark and stormy. Very unique and well chosen beer list and some good wine choices by the glass. We skipped appetizers, but they looked good. The steaks were of course excellent, in the top three I've ever had easily. I got the traditional filet, which is always the right choice. Some of the steaks come with toppings, or you can add your own like bone marrow, but I thought it was best unadorned. Dessert was good too, the chocolate ganache cheesecake pie type thing. Just a fantastic meal throughout. Great atmosphere too, chic yet old fashioned. Feels like something from the 1920. Of course all this means they get incredibly busy and its hard to get reservations even weeks in advance, but we got there early, around 5:30 and had no problem getting a table after a few minutes at the bar."
"What fixes a cold, windy, damp November night in Chicago?  Bavette's!Hell, Bavette's will make any kind of night in Chicago better...This was my first time here and I will be back again and again and again.My friend and I sat downstairs, it is certainly more my tempo down there...Dimly lit, cavernous, toasty room with large leather booths, a couple old couches, and a proper bar.  The music was pretty on point and that tends to make or break a lot of places for me.  Obviously, the envrinoment is a key factor, the service, drinks, food, etc. but music is up there too.We sat at the bar and started perusing the menus.  I suggest sitting at the bar, especially if Layla and/or Ben happen to be working.  I ordered an Old Fashioned and it was the best Old Fashioned, hands down.  I've had them at several places and Ben got it right, damn right! There were a couple of people sitting to the left of us and when their filets came out, I stopped in the middle of what I was saying and made a mental note ""order filet next time!""We picked the garlic shrimp for starters and all i can say about this delightful little appetizer is ""yum!""  It's a bit juvenile but the shrimp were perfect.  Second Old Fashioned and we asked Ben for his favorites on the menu, as far as appetizers went.  He suggested the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine and the Main Lobster.  We went with the lobster but I will be back for that goat cheese goodness.The lobster meat was heavenly and there was so much of it.  It was served cold (over ice), the best meat of the lobster were essentially staring at you saying ""dig in already"" so we did, we devoured it.  It was absolutely delicious. Third Old Fashioned, this one was mixed by the lovely Layla.  Man, do they know how to make a cocktail.  And they were both super friendly, like I had been there several times before.I HIGHLY recommend Bavette's.  I am already planning my next visit...I can't wait."
"My husband and I moved to Chicago just over a year ago and vowed to try out a ton of restaurants.  We stumbled upon Bavette's early on, and we have gone back numerous times--so much so that we have hardly tried any other restaurants!  We love the ambiance, and the food and service are excellent."
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago. Period.Wonderful char on the steak with a red center... mmmmmm! Great cocktails, wine list, and cozy 1920's speakeasy kind of feel. All my servers have been laid back, super friendly, and make great recommendations. Oh, and if there's a wait (there usually is), get a drink at the adorable bar. The time will pass before you know it."
"My husband came here on a Friday night around 6 and were seated in the parlor (lower level). The ambiance was dark but cozy. I would love to come again and eat on the main floor (it's a little brighter). Anyways, we started with the bone marrow with onion jam and parsley salad. This was perfect and we would come back here for this dish alone. We also loved the bread. We almost ate the entire basket. My husband had an old fashioned and I had a champagne smash. My husband is picky about his drinks but he really enjoyed the old fashioned made with rye. Our server even wrote down the name of the rye for him so he can look for it himself so we can stock it at home. On to the entrees. We had the fried chicken and the Chicago cut ribeye. The chicken was tasty, but I prefer Harold's fried chicken. I guess for me, I am all about the skin on fried chicken and this chicken had a thin layer of batter but not much crispy skin. Still nice and juicy and it was served with a nice buttermilk sauce. The steak was well seasoned but the meat itself was quite fatty. For our sides we had the corn and the pomme frites. The corn was amazing. I could eat a giant bowl of that corn. The fries were mediocre. We finished off the evening with the whiskey icecream. So great! We thought it would be a small bown but it was two giant scoops of malted whiskey icecream and then we drizzled it with fudge sauce.We thoroughly enjoyed our appetizers, drinks and dessert. The entrees were good but not exceptional. We loved the ambiance and we will be back. Also, the servings are quite generous so we had tons of food to bring home. We had fried chicken for lunch the next day and steak and eggs for breakfast. Next time we come we will definitely order a bit less..."
"Have you ever walked into a place and just KNEW you were going to love it?  Well such was the case at Bavette's Bar and Bouef!I loved the ""reveal"".  You enter under the stone arch and find yourself in a small, dark lobby where you are greeted by the hostess.  With a slight turn, you pull open the door and find yourself in . . . . .wait for it . . . . .a stunning room, dark and intimate with the bar at the back and crystal chandeliers twinkling above.We sat at the bar and were warmly greeted by Nathan, bartender extraordinaire, who wowed us with his martini making expertise and who instantly set out to make our evening just that much more delightful!  He was quick not only with the drink- but with commentary to answer all the many questions that I usually have when I enter a new establishment.  He was so delightful that we almost gave up our reservation to eat at his lovely bar (lead topped with cushy stools) but we wanted the full experience so off we went to our booth.And here the fabulous treatment continued.  Our server, Brendon, was also great- quick with suggestions and helping my picky friend find something that she would eat.  But then he cinched the deal for me by bringing a basket of bread.  Not just any kind of bread but freshly made bread (made on premise) with thick crust and warm, chewy centers, the way all bread should be.  And when you slather it with the soft butter, it was a comfort fest for my mouth!We started with one of their seafood towers.  I think there were 4 of them on the menu and the grand platter (enough for four at $125) included two kinds of oysters, succulent crab, and tons of jumbo shrimp.  Delicious and the perfect way to start our evening!We ordered a range of items to get the full taste of the menu.  I had the steak and frites which was perfectly cooked with plenty of fries to share.  Two at the table had the burger and there wasn't a prettier burger to be found (tasted great too)  But the real winner at the table was the fried chicken.  Yep.  More comfort food and while you might be turned off of it because it is all dark meat, the first bite of the juicy chicken under that crispy brown crust will have you shunning white meat forever!And if all of that wasn't enough . . . they have GOLDBRICK sundaes for dessert.  What?  You don't know about this culinary delight?  Well if you go . . .order one . . order two . . that's how good this is.  Whiskey ice cream (where do they come up with this stuff?) served with the chocolate and nut goldbrick sauce that you pour over the ice cream to form a hard crunchy shell.  I haven't had one of these since I lived up in Wisconsin and I think I'd come back here just for this even if the rest of the food wasn't so good!Like any great restaurant, management was visible and Aime stopped by our table several times to see how things were going.  We were running out of words to describe to her how delightful our evening was!  The only thing I forgot to do was to check out the lower level ""parlor"" as I wanted to see the entire restaurant but that will have to wait until the next time.If you drive- Bavette's shares a valet with the Gilt Bar (another fav of mine!) and will set you back about $12.Bavette's is the new gal in town . . .and I bet you are going to love her as much as I did!"
"I'd like to try Bavette's again after a disappointing experience. First off, I thought the place looked fantastic. Lots of dark wood and mirrors, it is clear that they spared no expense here. Apparently, it used to be a furniture store.On to the food. I immediately went for the Classic Ribeye ($38) which is reasonably priced, but fatty. At least 1/4 was off to the side. Another member of my party ordered it as well and had the same problem. Go with the filet. I ordered the bone marrow ($8) and mushroom ($7) for sides. I've never had bone marrow before and won't soon again. There wasn't anything to it but blackened grizzle. The mushrooms were chopped and served alongside the steak. I'd try the corn which was surprisingly spicy. Head downstairs to the Parlor for post-dinner drinks. You can really get lost down there. Hard to find your way around, but very intimate, if not a bit claustrophobic. Again, I want to like Bavette's and plan to return for roasted chicken which I'm told is wonderful."
"Great food, great ambiance!  Perfect date night restaurant.  My husband and I went for my birthday on a Tuesday night.  Even though we didn't order dessert (too stuffed), our server still brought out a candle for me to make a wish.  I thought that was such a nice touch and really made my night."
"Wow.  Wow.. Wow.This is definitely a special occasion place that was very well worth it.  Service was fabulous, food was delicious and drinks were great.  I can't even think of a complaint or even something I didn't like while I was there. They were also very, very friendly concerning my gluten free needs.  Sometimes, places make me feel bad about asking about what items are gf. (Which seriously offends me btw, I didn't choose to have celiac disease).  The waiter, Daniel was amazing about it and would even tell me when there was malt on an item.  Most places think it is just wheat, but he even knew about the malt and barely side of gluten as well.  Props to our waiter.I went with a group of 4 and we ordered-Goat cheeseSalmonGarlic shrimpCrab saladCaesar saladPork chopRibeyeShort rib pastaCornMashed potatoesFrench press coffee. Everything melted in our mouths.  The pork chop was huge and easily shared between us as well. I can't wait to go back again."
"Need not be a special-occasion-only restaurant if it doesn't have to be. We were a little iffy popping in after a Bulls game as the attire listed on Yelp is ""dressy"" but we called ahead and were given the go. I definitely enjoy the vibe downstairs versus upstairs, a lot more of a speakeasy feel to it. If you are an old-fashioneds person, this place is for you, as it is for me. Standouts: steak frites, bone-in ribeye accompanied by roasted bone marrow. Unnngggfh."
This is a good place to make reservations because the wait time is very long (90min+) and eating at the bar here sucks because it is crowded and loud. Tip: do not go to nearby gilt bar while you wait.We ate down in the dungeon and the lighting was on the pitch dark side of dim. Our booth was cozy and allowed me to have easy access to my husband's incredible dinner. Everything tasted so good I literally licked the plates.  I had a dry-aged ribeye and he had the pork chop. I can't believe a porkchop could actually taste better than a dryage steak but somehow Bavettes makes the pork taste AHHHMAZING.  The creamed spinach also blew my mind.
"By far, the best ribeye I've eaten in my entire life!  Will be back and will tell everyone I know about the level of excellence I experienced here."
"Yes, this place is as amazing as everyone has been saying!! I love the ambiance, very dim lighting, dark woods and huge leather booths. We sat downstairs in the lounge area, and loved it. We started off with an order of the oysters and shrimp cocktail. The oysters were nice big oysters that were super fresh. The shrimp were nice big plump shrimp cooked to perfection. We then split the Roasted Tomato and bacon salad and wow, was this good. We received 3 huge pieces of tomatoes, roasted with 2 thick slabs of bacon on top. The mixture of the fatty bacon with the ripe tomatoes was amazing. For our mains, I had the duchess filet cooked absolutely perfectly, the meat almost melted in my mouth. He had the Ribeye and thought it was cooked to his liking and was excellent. We split the Elote Corn - mus have and the mashed potatoes, both were amazing. Our waitress was on top of everything and amazing the entire time. I will definitely be back again and this place has it down from the service to the food to the ambiance. Its a great new spot!!Also, you are able to bring in your own bottle of wine without a corkage fee; however, you have to share one glass with someone else in the restaurant! I was lucky enough to be the recipient of a glass of wine. It was a great red, and it made a lady feel special to be chosen ;) We both agreed that it was a genius idea..."
"Probably what most impresses me about Sodikoff's slew of restaurants is his consistency. I know with confidence that when I eat at any one of his places I will get good food. I can barely keep up with his pace of openings (it seems just yesterday I enjoyed my first Pickleback at Au Cheval), and yet I am always eager to try his latest and greatest venture.Truthfully, there is not a huge diversity among his restaurants.  Staples like the steak frites and the bone marrow seem to show up on each new restaurant's menu, and the style of decor/food are all similar.  While the whiny side of me wants to see a completely different place, the hungry side of me sees no need to fix what ain't broke.Fortunately, at Bavette's, I found many new dishes that I liked, that are not on any of the other menus, which perhaps is why this restaurant is probably my favorite of the bunch:Their Caesar Salad is worth ordering.  With its homemade ""chips"" and smoked whitefish, this is not your typical caesar.The Berkshire pork was tender and flavorful.The Seafood tower, although daunting, was great to try and excellent quality.  Four people is good for this one.My choice for steak is almost always a rib-eye.  Theirs was perfectly cooked to our requested medium-rare. The side of bernaise was a nice throwback, and the side of herby salt was appreciated.The surprising star of the meal was the spaghetti. I've recently developed a fondness for handmade pasta and was excited to see one on the menu.  Although a seemingly simple dish, the lightly packed meatball and the sweet/spicy sauce paired perfectly with the toothy noodles.As always, the cocktails are all well-crafted, and here they suggest 3 ways for your old-fashioned (the original old overholt that they usually do, then a cognac which is smoother, and finally an aged bourbon that packs a punch).Now with two places each in River North and the West Loop, I think it's time for Bucktown to get one.  Who do I need to bribe to make this happen?? I can offer up a bag of gummy bears and a cute fluffy white dog.Fun Story Time!: Our server overheard us discussing the various old fashioneds we've tried around town and how the overall favorite still ended up being Sodikoff's version, except for their choice of ice. Oversized ice cubes are preferred as they melt much slower and don't dilute the drink. He seemed amused at our passion and informed us that their version of an oversized square ice cube was currently in production.  A stainless steel device had already been manufactured and ""R&D"" is close to perfecting the clarity of it. He even sent out an ice prototype for us and it totally made our night. Man, I'm annoying myself talking about my preferences for ice."
"Great atmosphere! It's relaxing yet quite fancy. The server made my night feel at ease.  He recommended us some of the dishes as well as explaining some of the fancy name from the menu. If the food is great but the server aren't good then it wouldn't worth it sometimes. Anyway, the food was delicious! Orders a sample of the oysters they offered, crabs stuffed avocado, lamp chop, and filet mignon. The meat were very well cook! The filet mignon was the best because not only is it well cooked, they have a really nice creamy dipping on the Side that help make the steak much more flavorful :).. I'm not a fan of lamp so I can't comment on how great it taste but my partner said he would give a five star for everything :). P.s. I think the restroom could be upgraded a little (unless that's your theme), then apologize."
"Best meal EVAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So I was skeptical with all the great reviews...can this place really be this good??  Yes, it can.  Yes, it is.  Yes, yes, YES!Its dark, romantic, boozey, smoozey.  I lovey...Me and my posse of ladies headed here on a Thursday...yep, a huge group of girls.  Well, of course you say...all the ladies love the new scene and yup, we hit the jackpot.The food is unbelievable.  I havent been to a great meal in River North in a long time and this was a great meal.  I had the salmon and of course a couple of tastings of crab cake, elote corn, and the hashbrown tater tot things...HEAVEN!  Oh sweet jesus.  They all were better than the next.  Perfect.  It was a seriously, perfectly cooked meal.Pricey-yes...duh, people what do you expect?  McDonald's $1 menu..not here sassafras....only the best.Go, see, believe, get fatter than me!!!!!!"
"I wrote an extensive interview on Opentable The server was named Stephanie, Samantha or Christina, or something like that (multiple syllables).  She was quite nice; attentive, cheerful, helpful, politely making conversations and laughing at our jokes politely, of which it's quite difficult to tell if genuine at a restaurant with such a high-priced menu.  It's quite obvious that your restaurant makes its main profits from the sides, salads, wines, and drinks, as most restaurants do.  However, the wines we sampled were quite boring and unspectacular.  Wine doesn't need to be expensive to be good.  In fact, my girlfriend and I have discovered numerous wines under $10 per bottle that are just as good or better than those with much higher prices.  To each their own when it comes to wines and perhaps we have psychologically conditioned ourselves to enjoy wine that is more economical?  Though I doubt that considering there are some expensive items that do NOT have cheaper alternatives on par (Balsamic Vinegar, dark chocolate, farm fresh free-range eggs, sprouted grain breads,etc.).  It would look a bit silly and unbalanced to have $60 steaks while offering $10 wines as pairings.  The $5 per bottle Tempranillo (2012 or 2013) by Opera Prima winery of Spain that we often drink would have paired much better than the $50 Malbec we settled on.  Another excellent, well-priced, winery is Casillero del Diablo of Chile.  (hint hint, the best wines come from Chile)here it is sorta.basically, if you can't manage to book a cheaper place and don't mind dropping about 150 dollars on a single meal for two, sure, go there.  They make a great steak."
"My wife and I came in from Boston for a little vacay last weekend. I'd read about Bavette's both here and elsewhere. Nothing I love better than a good steakhouse and I am here to tell you this is a great steakhouse. Everything was perfect. The atmosphere in the room is dark, with jazz playing in the background. The server was great and very helpful. We started off with delicious bread and butter, then made our way to a duck terrine appetizer (more bread). My wife had lamb (delicious) and I had the 22 oz. bone-in rib eye steak. Expensive? At 60 bucks, yes. Worth it? Absolutely. We shared the fantastic elote corn (with cheese), and the pommes frites. We both had two glasses of wine, pinot noir and grigiot, both of which were smooth as silk. Oh, and I also had mushrooms and garlic on top of the steak. I am here to tell you that the steak was buttery and delicious. I've never quite had it made that way, however they did it.Price for this blowout? About $250 and worth every penny. I never spend that kind of dough but in this case, no regrets. We didn't get dessert or coffee because we were literally too stuffed. We told our waiter it was one of the best meals we'd had. (By coincidence, he went to school in Boston so we chatted about that). Anyway - GO!"
"Let's get one thing clear: it's unacceptable to wait 11 minutes for a waiter to approach your table. Moreover, the approach was only after flagging the floor manager who I believe was named ""Johnny."" When I playfully expressed we had been waiting a while by saying, ""We need some cocktails!"" with a smile and a clap, his response was a VERY annoyed , ""Okaaaaay.....what can I get you?"" Well, Johnny, you can get me an attitude adjustment and my server, considering you're not in the weeds at 5:30pm and there's no excuse for that.That unpleasant start aside, our server, Mike, was wonderful when he finally showed up to the party.The food is indisputably good. If the service/attitude was good from start-to-finish, then I see no reason why this place wouldn't be a 5.  -Shrimp de jhone done perfectly and served with garlic toast-Bacon roasted tomato salad  - best bacon and tomato I ever had-Short rib stroganoff - delicious but got lost with our steak-22 oz rib eye - med rare, nothing better-Elotes, spicy and scumptious-Creamed spinach - terrible for you, but oh-so yummyFinal thoughts: -Make reso well in advance-Don't ask for anything too complicated-Bring your night vision goggles-Order the rib eye"
Great mixology and food - a great combo.  The crab legs are fresh and the meats are great.  Can't miss here!  Start with the cognac sazerac.  The corn side is off the charts.
"Had the best time at Bavettes for our anniversary dinner!  The server was very nice and knowledgeable.  One thing is that he misunderstood us and gave us a much more expensive steak than the one we ordered.  (Oh we'll) Loved the interior and the bar so much.  Reminded me partly of a Parisian cafe and partly of a speakeasy type place.  It was very dark, which actually worked well, because even thought the place was packed, it didn't seem like it.  Sharing the wine was a really fun and nice community experience - this and the bacon is where the 4th star comes from. Food - best wedge salad ever and I generally think they are disgusting.  They elevated the tradition.  Steak was worth it for the price.  Eliote corn was great but don't need to get it a second time. Potatoes were solid and I really liked the cream spinach, it was made with baby spinach.A couple that we shared our wine with sent us the chocolate mouse/puddingish cake for dessert.  Such a nice thing and especially or our anniversary!  This is another thing I generally don't like, but was delicious!  Go to Bavettes!"
"I love everything about this restaurant. Great food. Classic decor. Wonderful service. The music is a little loud, but this is really the perfect date spot."
Came here w a friend and we both ordered steak.. had corn and frites to share. The steak was really good. But we loved the corn more haha. I would like to return to try other items.
"Came to Bavette's last night for a birthday dinner and it was very good. Our server, Vince, was attentive and helpful. We started with the duck and goat cheese terrine, which was pretty interesting (in a good way). The flavors all worked well together and overall we liked it. Would I go out of my way to order it again? Not sure. For dinner we had the short rib stroganoff and southern style fried chicken. The pasta was very good, but obviously fairly decadent. You'll want to be very hungry if ordering this dish. The fried chicken was good and not too greasy. It's mostly dark meat, so if you prefer white meat, I'd reconsider. We also got the elote corn (awesome, but rich) and mashed potatoes (rich as well, but really good). Overall, the experience was a good one and the food was worth going back. Although I would definitely want to try new items..like a steak that looked awesome at the table next to ours."
"Bavette's is my new favorite place. The staff is so helpful and delightful, and the atmosphere makes you feel like you have time traveled back into a romantic restaurant during the twenties. I look forward to going back over and over again. AND the caesar salad is one of the most unique I have ever tried. AMAZING!"
"So yes, this is absolutely as good as it gets. I made reservations here for my boyfriends birthday.  They were incredibly accommodating, assuring me they would have a nice table for us.  Upon arrival we had a few minutes to wait so we headed to the bar.  Ambiance is really important to me and wow ... this place has it!  The sound of 1920's music will make you feel like you're starring in a scene from The Great Gatsby and the gold accents, chandelier and dark lighting brings about a prohibition romance that makes you want to drink whiskey :)  They have plentiful array of whiskey, scotch and bourbon, which really got me excited.  The bartender could have been a bit more attentive, but the attention to detail in our drinks made up for any confusion.We tried the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine (very unique taste and highly recommend trying), crab stuffed avocado (a plentiful and very tasty grade of crab served in and avocado next to a bed of butter leaf lettuce) and 6 oz filet mignon (cooked to perfection) with a herb butter sauce that makes everything in life better.  Our waiter was a diva, and I absolutely loved him.  It was clear that he was passionate about the food and the venue itself, which sold us on his outstanding recommendations.  AND he told my boyfriend ""happy birthday"" right off the bat, establishing from the very beginning that he was attentive to our party :) You would think of ""boeuf"" as merely a steak house, but apparently the quality of seafood here stands out from the rest with half the menu being comprised of king crab legs, fresh main lobster and ""maudes tower"" which my boyfriend and I decided we would try next time we go back (an extreme array of delicious shellfish).I didn't have the opportunity to try out downstairs for as long as I would like, but it's made to be a speakeasy feel featuring old school east coast hip hop (whaaaaaaaaat?!).  Next time I go I will make sure to sip on some whiskey in this little nook because the vibe was right.  Everything about this place is right!"
OMG I just found my favorite place to eat in Chicago! The atmosphere is very romantic. The staff extremely nice. The food was amazing! We ordered the 10 oz filet mignon which practically melted in my mouth. We also ordered the beef stroganoff. I'm not a pasta person but this was amazing!!! We also order the pomes frites and the corn! The corn dish was my favorite!!! When I finished eating it my only wish was that I turn invisible so I could lick the plate. They bring bread out first with butter. Even the butter was amazing. After each dish the busboy cleans of the table and arranges new silver wear in the most graceful and art like way. I wanted to applaud.  We had the lemon pie with French press coffee for dessert and it was also amazing. I can't wait to come back!!!!
Pork Chop..Pork Chop...Pork Chop.  That's all you need to know!
"My husband and I came for a short visit to Chicago this week. I knew this place was top on my list. We had a late reservation, but arrived early and decided to just dine at the bar after getting drinks. The bar staff were very attentive and entertaining. We had a great time watching them make amazing cocktails. I enjoyed Bavette's Punch and it well exceeded my expectations. The homemade bread that was brought out before dinner was to die for and tasted just like the kind my mother used to make. I ordered the petite filet and my husband the larger filet. As a side we ordered Elotes Loco and Pomme Frite. Both main courses were inarguably for both the best filets we had ever had (we eat a ton of filet and make a fun game out of rating them each time at different establishments). Elotes Loco was a standout for me and husband said he enjoyed the Pomme Frites a great deal. Béarnaise was out of this world tasty. An amazing experience and we will for sure be back for out #1 Filet."
"We dined at Bavettes a couple months ago and had a spectacular experience. On the first trip there, it was last minute so we couldn't get a reservation other than at 9:15 pm, but the server was very attentive, food was phenomenal and the experience/ambiance couldn't be beat. We raved about Bavettes to all our friends, and told everyone that the 22oz dry aged prime ribeye was possibly the best steak in chicago (as I mentioned in my previous review). My dining partner's mother was coming into town this past Thursday with her manager and we insisted that we HAD to go to Bavettes for dinner. This time around, we made reservations well in advance, securing a prime 7:45 slot. We're not sure exactly what happened between then and now. Bavette's has always been a very busy and well-booked restaurant so we thought that they would be prepared. Perhaps our first experience was so late that we had proper service attention, but this time the restaurant was obviously incredibly understaffed.We waited for a very long time before being greeted, and equally long times in between to place our order and receive our different courses. Even though they asked us to put the entire course in at once so the 'kitchen can pace us', multiple shared apps showed up at the same time crowding the table, and the second after they were cleared our next courses came. We all got the 22oz prime dry aged ribeyes and the steak was still good. the corn was also still just as good as I remember. However, the numerous other hiccups in the process made the evening and overall disappointment that just doesn't seem appropriate of a place of this caliber and price point. Big disappointment this time around."
"Our service was tediously slow and it took over 45 minutes between our appetizers and our entrees to arrive. When we finally were able to flag down our server (hey, what gives?), he said the order was misplaced, awesome. It's now 10pm and there's a steak the size of my head with my name on it on its way...suddenly so not in the mood.The restaurant was way too dark (Question: Is 30 so old that I can't see my menu, or is it just way too freakin' dark in here?!)  There is just really nothing special about Bavettes that distinguishes it in any way from the majority of cookie cutter steakhouses in Chicago.  It is so been there done that...pick an overpriced 24 oz steak. Pick a couple sides. Big woop. If i want an old school french vibe steak frites, I'm going to Le Bouchon, which feels so much more authentic, and they happen to do a lot of other great dishes just as well.  Server spilled some of the wine from the single glass-sized serving caraffe when pouring it into one of our glasses...doesn't apologize, doesn't bring more.I will say the appetizers were the only standout - shrimp with garlic and herbs, crab cake, and beet salad.The desserts were lackluster too.  Giant sized slice of lemon meringue pie, and sorbet straight from Black Dog Gelato. Doesn't take much effort or imagination for either."
"I think I've said it all in my pictures. Really, just go! I went with friends but would be a PERFECT place to bring a date. Lots of conversation pieces, sensual food, great drinks."
"I loved everything about this place. Even including the complimentary warm bread and salty butter. My friend and I ordered the salmon tartare, baked goat cheese, bacon roasted tomato salad, fries and the rib eye. Everything was really delicious but I think my favorite was the bacon roasted tomato salad, it had a perfect balance of flavors. It's also a great date place - dim lighting and not too loud. Can't wait to go back and order more things on the menu."
"Best meal I have ever had in my life, maybe.Got the goat cheese and seafood tower to start. The seasoning in the goat cheese was the best part. The Seafood tower was massive and the coolest thing I have ever ordered.I got vegetarian pasta as my entree, it was delicious and simple.For dessert we got the cheesecake. So good."
"This place makes me wonder why I settle for less in a restaurant.  Omg.  It was great.  Steaks, wine, atmosphere, everything was ""the middle bite"" Our server was Eric and he made the experience even better! This place is a must!"
"This place is the antithesis of a steakhouse dining experience.  Or if this is where they are headed nowadays, I'm not into it.  I took my husband here for an early birthday dinner.  Having reviewed the Yelp reviews prior, we were very excited.  I won't be back.  I won't recommend that anyone go there.  Service:  Absolutely horrible.  Horrible horrible horrible.  I've never been so rushed in my life.  After ordering drinks, our waiter wanted to take the wine list.  I asked to keep it because we wanted a bottle and he was taken aback.  I later learned it was probably because he wanted to get us OUT.  When he came back with our drinks, he asked if we were ready.  He wanted to take our order all at once to ""make it easier on the kitchen."" (wow).  He reassured us that it would be spaced out but dude just wanted to get out of there.  We had 2 drinks, 1 bottle of wine, 2 apps, and 2 entrees all put on our table in 45 minutes. (!)  I don't know about everyone else, but when I go to a steakhouse, I like to enjoy the experience and relax.  They should have just given us a feed bag and said ""we gotta get this all down"" while shoving the food down our throats.  For some reason, after shoving everything down our throats as quickly as possible, our waiter decided to wait 30 minutes before asking us if we wanted to dessert.  Seriously.  What did he do during this time?  Stand next to our table.  Where his friends were seated.  And gossip to them about his relationship problems.  Wow. Ambience:  I really enjoyed the old timey prohibition feel.  The dim lighting was great but it was really too loud for me.  I'm not that old but it was hard to hear my husband and he was just sitting across from me.    Dress:  Yelp has this place listed as ""dressy.""  Yea, no.  Several guys wore ripped jeans with white stitching and girls in short short shorts.  I get it is River North but I was shocked.  So if you are wondering what to wear here, I guess pretty much anything goes?   Food:  This was the only highlight.  And I'm not talking life changing.  I would say it is average. The shrimp cocktail was a nice portion that actually should've been called prawns because they were so large.  Many people raved about the goat cheese and tomato app but I thought it was average.  Steaks (24 oz dry aged and petite filet) were average.  Dessert (peppermint ice cream with hot fudge) tasted like a dentist office.  The true show stealer?  The table bread and butter.  Came out soft and piping hot.  Very good. Drinks:  Decent selection of cocktails as well as a wine list.  Everything we had was good (dark & stormy) but once again, not life changing."
One of my favorite restaurant experiences in Chicago!The ambiance is great to start and the drink menu is fun. The rib eye I had which was covered with roasted garlic (option) was one of the best if not the best I've ever had. My wife's lamb chops were the best she ever ate. Go here!
Do yourself a favor and order the fried chicken.  We were still dreaming about it a week later.  The service was excellent... our server was pleasant and attentive without being annoying.
We usually make it to Chicago at least once a year and try to hit a steakhouse every time we go.  I have been wanting to try Bavettes for some time but usually wait too long to book a reservation but was able to get a seating and am very glad we did.  The whole experience was delightful.  The ambiance was great and the service top notch.  Our server recommended a great bottle of wine in our price range. (Am embarassed I forgot his name since he did a great job). I ordered the dry aged bone on ribeye with the mashed potatoes as a side.  The steak was cooked to perfection with a wonderful dry aged flavor.  My wife loved her steak as well but I doubt it could have tasted any better than mine.    You cannot go wrong here.
"Unpretentious. There is a $9 hamburger on the menu (compare to $27 on my hotel's room service menu!). They brought us tap water without asking and without trying to upsell us into bottled. A crab and avocado salad plus the sourdough bread would have been enough to earn this place 5 stars. Both were crazy good. I'm 6' tall and ate a business dinner here with a 6'2"" tall colleague. We split a 24 oz. steak and two sides and were more than full. The sides are absurdly rich.It is tough to think of anything that could have been improved. I wish they'd had more fruit desserts on the menu. How's that? We settled for splitting a chocolate cream pie. The bill with two glasses of wine was reasonable at $152 for two before the tip."
I've come here for both food and drinks and have yet to be disappointed.  The food is very high quality and the menu is pretty diverse.  The service was great at both the bar as well as sitting down at a table. The bartenders really know their drinks and you can tell they take pride in their craft.  I love the atmosphere - it is dark and sleek but also has a lot of room - both upstairs and downstairs.
I cannot express how happy I was with my meal and well as the serve (Shawn deserves a gold star as well).  The Ribeye was to die for as well as the roasted tomato.  Don't leave without trying the bacon :)))
"Not sure why this place was so hard to get a reservation at. I'm just not understanding the hype...but maybe that's all it is. Yes, the food was good, but nothing particularly breathtaking like everyone else seems to be claiming. Maybe we just had a mediocre experience. The service wasn't bad, but I found myself glancing over my shoulder way too many times in anticipation of catching the waitress's attention. (Which I never successfully did. Just had to wait till she eventually came back.) Overall we had a nice time...Will I come back here? Probably not, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Went with wife and a friend, amazing service, amazing good, cocktails. Loved the Cognac Old Fashioned. Dry aged steak was so tasty, had bone in ribeye and bone in fillet. Also, must have the tounge - so juicy."
The food was delicious. They even have a great vegetarian menu. A nice date night!
"Best meal out of my entire Chicago trip!Ambiance: Dark enough, romantic, and earthy. Not pretentious, but classy. Wish I was able to reserve a booth, however side by side tables had enough distance between them so you could feel like you were having a private meal.Service: Excellent. Waiter was friendly and water was always filled.Food:Thanks to Yelpers, my date and I started off with the duck and goat cheese terrine.  Amazing. We also shared the arugula and beet salad. Best candied nuts I've ever had. He ordered the rib eye. Excellently seasoned. I ordered the petit filet. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Ordered a size of bone marrow. Amazing, a bit salty, but still flavorful. No room for dessert. :-(Make a reservation early on and request a booth if you're looking for a romantic time!"
Solid place. Food is a little heavy but oh-so-delicious and worth it. Even if it has somehow become trendy I'm still a sucker for an egg on top of things and they cook them perfectly. If you could make reservations I'd be more willing to go back!
"Loved this place! The restaurant is GORGEOUS and the food is excellent. We loved the ribeye and steak frites. Bone marrow was decadent on their fresh warm bread and the tomato/bacon was excellent. Highly recommended.We were initially seated in the lounge downstairs, that has a very different look, vibe and music. We asked to be seated upstairs if possible and when a table opened up early, we were able to be seated upstairs. So glad we went to Bavette's!"
"As I've mentioned previously, Brendan Sodikoff has cornered the market on dead sexy dining.  Here, he takes the classic old school steak house vibe and injects it with a massive dose of Jazz Age seduction.Upon entry, your first impression may very well be, I'd like to forego the steak and sit in these sexy vintage couches drinking sexy vintage cocktails.  And I would not cast aspersions on you for doing so.  My noble bourbon boozers may initially be confounded by the concentration of cognac on the cocktail menu, but be not abashed, I beseech you.  The Old Fashioned and Sazerac, prepared cognac style, are delicious and elegant and will add a certain Nawlins Jazz Age je ne sais quoi which may have been missing from your life up to this point.  We must all live and expand our horizons.But please, do not linger long in the lounge.  Proceed to your table and you'll have a classic steak house experience, only, well, sexier.  Like Maude's Liquor Bar, Bavette's sports an impressive raw bar selection, and I urge you to go as big as your table allows with oysters, jumbo shrimp. clams and mussels.  They are delicious.  Similarly delicious is the bone in dry aged ribeye; a cut to rival any other steak house in Chicago, preferably ordered rare.  What you mind find the most captivating, however, is dessert.  Their chocolate cake is rich, stunningly delicious and HUGE.  You will definitely want to order this and take it (all) home if necessary, it will keep and give you a full week of pleasure.Did I mention that the vibe is fantastic?  All this time you've been dining with me they've been playing 20's era jazz and it has been smokingly seductive.  You'd like to stay for an after dinner cocktail but, oh, you've been so intoxicated already you must hurry hurry home.  But come back soon, we miss you so."
"Gosh....where should i start....my bff and i both LOVE this restaurant! This has never happened in our history!The house cured bacon was phenomenal! my bff almost literally stabbed my hands for taking too many bites off of hers! Never disappointed with the Brendan Sodikoff's bone marrows! Our server suggested topping our steaks with the bone marrows! Marvelous idea! The chocolate cream pie was just as amazing as the golden brick I had the other time! We got seated downstairs...we all love the ambiance downstairs. I can see how the dark dim light could be a turn-off to some, but i thought it added the intimate but yet causal and speakeasy atmosphere to the whole dining experience."
"Unbelievably delicious! The ambiance is so cool; it's this stellar speak-easy vibe. They even have a bar downstairs which reminds me of an Al Capone-esc hideout. The drink menu is awesome but the food really steals the show. The steaks are huge, well-seasoned and wonderful. I think it's safe to say Bavette's trumps David Burke's (sorry! Burke's is good but their quality has gone down over the years and Bavette's is divine!). Thick cut bacon appetizers are a great way to start the meal and whiskey ice cream is a lovely way to finish it. You can tell all the food is fresh. The staff is super knowledgeable and friendly. Bavette's is a must go!"
I asked my daughter in law to pick out a place where she would like to go and my son the vegetarian would not go.  Since my son was working the evening we went it worked out just fine for all.  I have her an unlimited budget which we managed to exceed.  Just kidding.  This is not for the light of wallet so if you want to spend some money and have one of the best steaks this is the place.
"Restaurant lived up to all the buzz.  Arrived with a gluttonous appetite and ordered the bone in filet, bone marrow, bolognese, crab cake, crab legs, side of corn and frittes.  Wow!  Waiter enhanced the wonderful dining experience with his knowledge and recommendations.  Pleasant, welcoming atmosphere that is casual and sophisticated.  I can't wait to return."
Loved this place. The ambiance is amazing - French 1920's - esque. The staff was great - we sat at the basement bar before dinner and the bartender was so nice and had great recommendations and our waitress was so great and attentive. They have a BYOB policy as long as you share a glass of wine with a table around you and the food was fantastic and a little more reasonable than other steakhouses. I will definitely be back here again!
"I attended bavettes last night for some fun cocktails andLight food with a friend. Couldn't have been more impressed. With everything.I'm terribly indecisive. The bartenders were patient, kindAnd helped me find things I would like. When my friend didn't likeHis wine they replaced it no problem. I wish I had their names becauseI will return to see them and hope their management praises their skills. This was Sunday the 10th. Then we ordered a few sides and the goat cheese appetizer. Wow. An entire glazed sweet potato, and most amazing broccoli side whichThey prepared to order, special requests on everything. Good bless their kitchen.Goat cheese appetizer was the best I have had. You would not be disappointed. I praise them and will return."
The best steak in the city! Try cocktails because the bartender is super. Great service and the atmosphere is very nice .
So good!! My wife ordered the lamb and I got the Chicago rib eye. Both were tender and delish. Highly recommended.
Amazing! Brought in my European parents who were visiting Chicago. We all loved it. The restaurant atmosphere immediately transports you into another world. Even though there is music playing in the background the restaurant isn't too loud. The meat is excellent. My mother and I shared the burger and a petite duchesse filet mignon. We both like our meat well done. It was still tender and with plenty of taste. The burger might very well be my new favorite in Chicago. The side dishes - creamed spinach and sugary sweet potatoes - were delicious. A must try!!
"1) The atmosphere is perfect for old school swanky steak 2) The service is amazing right off the bat, super knowledgeable and can create a custom experiences for you3)  THE BONE IN RIBEYE4) Don't go here with your B game, spend the moneyThats it....."
"Hands down my favorite place in Chicago.  The food is great.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  In addition, they have a great bourbon and scotch selection."
"Love! Share entrees and gigantic sides...best way to try the menu. the Chicago Ribeye, carved prime rib sandwich, tomatoes, loaded baked potato were fantastic. The appetizer: duck with goat cheese terrain was ok, we'll try the goat cheese next time! Brandon, our waiter, was knowledgeable about the menu.  The rest of the staff were great!! Definitely going back!"
"I've been to a good amount of steakhouses in Chicago, and this one is easily my favorite. The atmosphere is perfect and so is the food. Started with a dozen oysters, and their presentation was just as great as their taste. Followed them with a bone-in ribeye, which was cooked to perfection. Hash browns and creamed spinach for sides, and both were delectable. All the while, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.One last thing I'll mention about this great restaurant was the corkage fee, or lack thereof. I typically like to bring my own unique bottle of wine to restaurants and just pay the fee. Bavette's, however, does not have a fee; instead, they suggest you share one of your glasses with someone else in the restaurant (e.g. random patron, hostess, waiter). I thought this was unique and very cool (as did the random guy we ended up giving the glass to). Perfect meal. Perfect night. Thanks, Bavette's."
"I got the steak frite ($28) and a side of elote style corn ($7). The steak was yummy and decently priced (considering the restaurant/ general atmosphere). It comes with a cute bucket of tasty fries. The corn was alright. Unique and tasty, but wasn't spot-on for me. There was also complimentary bread and butter. The bread was really soft and warm. :) Probably one of the best I've had haha.The ambiance was very nice. It's dark and the noise level is comfortable. When I left at around 10 PM, my eyes had to adjust to the brightness outside in comparison haha."
"I call desserts heaven. I lie, cheat and steal. Unfortunately, I feel most sacrilegious giving a Sodikoff restaurant less than 4.5 stars. Yes it was my birthday, no I'm not a princess. First off, I'm a Taurus, MAY birthday people. The place was pitch black at 5:00. Way to set the mood...for my sister, parents, best friend and daughter. We ordered a lot. The waiter creeped me out. ""You wanted the salads BEFORE your entrees?"" Um, usually, but we're flexible. Wtf. You want another glass of wine? It's number 2, not 9, and so what of it was. Food was good, not even close to great. Fried Chicken ~ this group knows chicken, fried did not impress me. Meatloaf~ my dad loved it, I like mine better. Pork Chop~ my gf can eat, and it was great. But it's just a pork chop. Next. Bone in Ribeye~ this may be one of the most highly (over) praised meals in Chicago. It doesn't hold a candle to D. Burke's, Morton's, Mastro's, etcOysters~ very good, not great. Gilt, you get me every time. F. That. Bavette's. Noise. I'm fine being an outcast. Gilt, Maude's, Dillman's, Bavette's...in that order."
"I love Bavette's and they've quickly become one of favorite places.  Everything from the food & drinks, to the service & ambiance; it's just all done so well.  I'm a big fan of Gilt Bar next door (and also enjoy me some Doughnut Vault), so I had high hopes for this place and I wasn't disappointed one bit.The space is dimly lit with chandeliers, filled with plush leather seating and dark woods throughout.  I dug the decor and I could see myself hanging out here a lot more, especially with some drinks.  I'm usually a beer kind of guy, but I think I'll stick to cocktails here.  I tried the Weller's 107 Old Fashioned and a Lion's Tail - both were really well made and were recommended by our server.The servers are always top notch and make great recommendations,thoroughly explaining the menu.  There's so much good food to choose from and everything can easily be shared, so best bet is to order a bunch of dishes and pig out.Bread + Butter - Probably one of my favorite parts of the meal.  Warm sourdough bread and really good creamy butter... so simple but so good.Oysters - I've tried the Shibimi, Kumamoto, and Malpque, which were all very fresh and deliciousThick Cut Bacon - Bacon steaks that melt in your mouth. No knives needed here.24oz Prime Dry Aged Bone-in Ribeye - On par with Gilt Bar, if not better - Gilt Bar's steaks are served with a side of addictive crack salt to dip each bit into, Bavette's seasons their steak with it instead.Buttery Mashed Potatoes w/ chicken jus - Perfect side to some steak.Shortrib Stroganoff - Must get!  So damn good, I would bathe in it if I could.  Perfect.Southern Style Fried Chicken - Crispy, juicy, and delicious.Beef Tongue - Fork tender, like braised short ribs.Goldbrick Sundae -  If you have room, this is also a must get. Whiskey Ice Cream (from Black Dog Gelato) + gold brick sauce (nougatey magic shell).Going to Bavette's has become a tradition with me and my friends.  We try to go at least once a month and can't wait to go back!"
"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. We have been to many steak restaurants around the city but I believe this to be the best. First off, the ambience is so cool and fun. The upstairs is very swanky and loud but cool sceney. The parlor is downstairs, darker but more prohibition-era. We are down there. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgable. We ordered oysters as an app. The presentation was phenomenal and the taste was incredible. We also orders tasty cocktails as well. For the main event we ordered different types and cuts of steak but both were to our liking. It can be tough to get into but well worth the wait and early dinner reservation time. We can't wait to go back!"
"Delicious!  It's usually a few weeks wait for reservations so we decided to go when it opened. The bone in rib eye was incredible and my husband's filet was mouth watering too. Very nice atmosphere and our server, Mike, was friendly and accomodating. The broccoli was the tastiest I've had in a long time. Go!"
"Bavette's is a gem. The atmosphere alone is worth the 5 stars with comfy booths, dark lighting, candles, and an old speakeasy feel. You feel sexy there. I would dress up if you are going there. The food was yummy! My beau mentioned that it was borderline salty, but I did not notice. But, then again, I love salt and did not have to add any. We both had the petite filets with roasted tomatoes and they were cooked Medium. Well done, but not a completely blow your socks off steak. We also had the mashed potatoes and broccoli. Both were yummy. We had a red wine blend from Washington that was well worth the bottle price. Chocolate cream pie for dessert was delicious. The beau had English Breakfast tea with dessert and loved it. I had the french press coffee which, unfortunately, tasted like chlorine water..not good. Overall, I would definitely go again and recommend that other do, too. It is pricey, but well worth the experience."
"I've only had knock out amazing experiences here so was bummed this weekend when: crab salad smelled like a dead animal, steak ordered medium arrived to the table rarer than rare and usually crispy bacon and roasted tomato salad was like a piece of greasy tire rubber. Our waitress was nothing but gracious and amazing but what's up in the kitchen."
"This place is fantastic! Amazing food and drink, wonderful unpretentious atmosphere, great service. It hits the trifecta."
"It's really as great as everyone says. It's dark, romantic but equally a cool spot to hang out for dinner and drinks with friends, especially right after makin that money at work. I'll be back for the seafood tower! Mark my words.. I live too close to forget about it. We ordered almost all the sides and they were all delicious. I'm a sucker for a good side dish. The broccoli was off the menu for seasonal asparagus.. sad face as I prefer roasted broccoli over grilled asparagus. The hash browns were sooo good and crispy! Crispy! For my entree I had the crab stuffed avocado salad and it was large, definitely enough for two people to split. It's light and refreshing with a lot of crab. I'd get that again. Also gold brick sundae! I had to google that before ordering because we know it as a different name. It's delicious! and worth it. We had it with the whiskey ice cream. The other dessert options did not sound so enticing, if anything- get the gold brick sundae. Obvi, they have a fabulous cocktail and champagne menu. I had the champagne smash and it was wonderful. There's lots of small ice pebbles at first but it melts down and makes it perfect. If I didn't have to get up so early in the morning, I'd get another one but I try hard to be a good girl during the weekdays."
"Very Disappointed.  And not with the food.  The staff was rude, pretentious, and unfriendly.  It made for a very unpleasant evening.  Maybe the restaurant should spend as much care on hiring staff and training them as it does on it's food."
This place is phenomenal. I loved it from the goat cheese marinara  to the Meat Loaf. Great ambiance. Get seated in the basement. Way more intimate!
"What's not to like ... the ambiance, service approach, food were all excellent ... the only item that underwhelmed was the crab-cake (by a slight margin) ... otherwise, its a must visit place.  Brendan Sodikoff continues to impress!"
"BBB does to patrons what the phone booth did to Clark Kent - transform them into sexy superheroes in a setting that has the sleekness and comfort of a French brassierie, with cozy booths and warm and attentive service.  The food was hearty and soulful.  As a caesar salad aficionado who believes that there isn't much you can do to improve them, the whitefish caesar was exceptional - the whitefish slivers and snowy drift of delicate parmesan cheese created a savory masterpiece.  My husband and I both enjoyed their steak frites, and is there anything better than bearnaise on a fall evening?  It's a shame that BBB opened after we moved from River North, because we definitely would have been regulars.  It lacks the pretentiousness, but retains the finesse of RN restaurants, a delicate balance that deserves to be appreciated on a regular basis."
"Love Love Love how this place is decorated. The food is heavy, filling, and tasty. Make a reservation here if you have someone in from out of town and want to show them a good time and unique dining experience. Would be a great date spot too."
From the cool decor  to the wait staff  to the apps to the bread the wine to the AWESOME double cut pork chop and the AMAZING 10 oz filet to the super YUMMY lemon meringue pie and whiskey ice cream sundae the night was PERFECT !   Pricey ? yes   but perfect  !   Major YUM YUM
"Definitely in my top 5 favorite restaurants - it's a big deal, ok?. I'll keep this short and sweet.There is a reason this place is impossible to get a reservation at. First and foremost, the food is excellent. The peppered duck and goat cheese terrine (very large portion) is a great start, or the goat cheese terrine. The smoked whitefish ceasar is the most amazing salad in existence (in fact I will just order like 3 of those when I go there next weekend). The classic ribeye was cooked to a beautiful medium consistency, and paired nicely with the elotes side dish (A MUST). The roasted bone marrow, which I was hesitant about at first, was seasoned nicely and actually quite amazing. Even the thick maple bacon was incredible. If I didn't have a shellfish allergy, I'd be trying all the oysters because they look phenomenal and all the tables around us had them. Add a few shots of the Jameson shot with spiced pickleback (I know it sounds strange, just get it). Leave room for plenty of cocktails. Possibly even dessert.. although I have yet to try this.The staff is always attentive, cool, and great for suggestions (not hard making suggestions when everything on the menu is amazing I guess..). The atmosphere is  swanky, dark, intimate, and old fashioned. Please don't bring touristy looking people here, please.Get dressed up with some good people, and come eat here."
Great ambience. Terrible service. Waiter was hardly around.  Long waits for ordering and food. Never asked us if we needed anything. Just ran from table to table. Overpriced for the quality of service. Food was okay for something rated so high on Yelp. Don't waste your money.
"My wife and I went here and ate in the lounge area near the front door.  It was a dark & stormy night and I drank a Dark & Stormy.  The cocktail was good - but not great, especially for the price.  It could have either been bigger or had less ice.  The steaks are just okay.  I had the Delmonico and I thought it was a little too ""sinewy"", if that is the word.  My wife had a salad and the size was okay but it was ""nothing you couldn't get anywhere else"".  I give the 4 stars because the food is a 3 but the atmosphere is a 5.  If you like going to a dark, swank, speakeasy style place with a good, noisy vibe then you will be in heaven.  The staff was okay - our waiter a little dramatic but not overly so - you need something for your slightly overpriced experience, no?  We also shared the thick cut bacon side as an appetizer.  It ways very tasty and fun.  You need to eat it quickly as it is best when it is hot (all though isn't all bacon better that way?).  This is a good place for a date night or anniversary with your significant other but probably not the best for a business dinner or a larger crowd if you want the whole table to interact.  If you have time stop in for a drink and decide for yourself.  If you just want a really great steak you can find better.  Cheers."
"I don't have any words to describe this place. Pure wonderful!y boyfriend is French and even he loved it and approved of all the dishes. Enjoy, and remember the portions are huge!!!!"
"The baked goat cheese with herbs is heavenly. I wanted to jump in an swim in it, it was sooo good! The decor is really nice and romantic too, if you're looking for a great romantic date spot, this is the place. Drinks are also quite good, with a nice selection of beers, though nothing on tap, but that's ok. Try the malted whiskey ice cream and the garlic shrimp, they'll make you want to slap yourself!"
It was everything we hoped for and more.  Went for wife's birthday and had a great time. Service ten stars.  For. Ten stars.  The room was packed for a rainy Sunday night. Can't wait to go back.
"All I can say is WOW!!! It's our 17th anniversary and we decided to celebrate at Bavettes.  Can I say that their bread is the most moist, chewy delicious bread in all of Chicago.We started with the baked crab cake. -light & flakey,  not greasy.  Whatever is in the crab cake sauce is the most amazing, succulent,  finger-licking stuff I've ever tasted. Next came the mixed green salad with shaved green apples. Light and refreshing. Thoughtful wine list. Filet mignon cooked to perfection. Roasted garlic mashed potatoes melt in your mouth. Top it all off with a truly gourmet chocolate cream pie. I've died and gone to heaven. We'll definitely be back! My only complaint is how dim the lighting is. You can see across the table but that's about it!"
"Although I seldom eat steak, I come from the land of Peter Luger's and in a past life, had a Wall Street consulting gig that allowed me to eat at many of those fine establishments.Because Bavette's was still relatively new at the time (this was back in November), I made my dinner reservation a month in advance.  The more positive things that I heard about Bavette's, the more I looked forward to cocktails and dinner.We arrived at 8:30 for our reservation and our table was not ready for us.  We were instructed to wait at the bar and have a drink, which was fine because I wanted so much to try some of the cocktails that had received good press in Time Out Chicago.  Except my friend and I waited 10 minutes without a bartender acknowledging us or taking our drink order.  It's fine, I told myself: I'm not a lush (seriously, I swear) and can order a drink when we are seated.  We were seated downstairs, which has much more of a lounge vibe than the upstairs jazz-era bar.  Needless to say, the atmosphere at Bavette's is a much-welcome departure from the stuffy ""boys club"" feel that many prestigious steak houses have.We finally got around to ordering those drinks which took forever to arrive (figure another 10 minutes or so).  My Corpse Reviver No 2 was good, but I've also had much better at other cocktail lounges (e.g., The Whistler, Barrelhouse Flat, or even Bavette's sister restaurant, Maude's).Our waiter was pretty aggressive in getting us to order oyster towers and king crab.  What I lack in income to order a $165 plate of shellfish, our waiter lacked in the ""dude, back off already"" department.  We did order appetizers though: the baked goat cheese (circa 1992) and the shrimp cocktail.  The goat cheese is one of the most popular appetizers on the menu - it's good for sharing and great if you love the combination of goat cheese, tomato sauce, and garlic toast.  And who doesn't love cheese and carbohydrates?For my main course, I ordered the steak frites (with a side of creamed spinach, my favorite steakhouse staple).  After what was another eternity (it took 2.5 hours for us to be served and eat 2 courses), our food finally arrived. I had asked for my steak to be prepared medium-rare, although it was probably closer to medium.  The steak itself was an okay cut, still tender given that it was cooked more than I would have liked, but it was just that: fine and average.We didn't even consider ordering dessert because we had already been in the restaurant for a while and were both stuffed from all of the steak and appetizers.I'm not sure if our waiter thought he was the stand-up comedian for the evening, but the way he spoke to my friend and I came across as snarky.  If I wanted snarkiness, I'd go drink $2 PBR in Logan Square rather than $25 glasses of Bordeaux.I was hoping that I would like Bavette's as much as I like Maude's and Au Cheval, but unfortunately this wasn't the case.  Bavette's is a good place to grab a cocktail - and indeed it is as my friends and I gave the bar a second chance, but when given the choice, I'd still prefer Maude's for my whiskey or gin hankerings."
The place is beautiful! The music was great and the food even better... money well spent!!
"An excellent spot with great ambiance and superb food. Although the menu may seem conventional and with a large French influence, dishes are defined by their classic American twists. In order to enjoy your meats to the fullest, order them as rare as you're willing to go - doneness seems to be a bit higher than what would be expected either way. It's clear Bavette's has a very demanding kitchen team already from the bread - served in almost comically large hunks with a firm crust and a moist, soft interior reminiscent of the fresh bread from the wood-fire ovens in Italy. Fight the temptation to gorge yourself on the entirety of your bread, there is more marvelous food to come. The Pepper Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine was a ruby-pink affair with great texture, accompanied by a well-spiced chutney that almost gave it the notes of barbeque sauce. The friend chicken, which we had heard accolades of, was crisp to perfection but was steaming and soft inside. A minute less, and the meat near the bone would have been a light pink, so the cooking point was just right. The creamed spinach, in the classic American fashion, was a lot more ""cream"" than ""spinach,"" making it a delicious indulgence, although the blue cheese in it was not very prominent. Another side, a baked sweet potato slathered with butter and brown sugar, was almost creamy soft inside, and the addition of the brown sugar made it all the more special.My steak frites, recommended au poivre, or topped with peppercorns in the classic French way, was served crisp on the outside as opposed to the usual, more liquid sauce. The fries were hot and firm, and the duck fat they were fried in gave them a very special flavor. The steak was of amazing flavor - but I had asked for the piece ""medium rare,"" and had instead gotten closer to something ""well-done."" The waiters were very accommodating and had a new steak, this time with just the right bite in the center, for me in no time. Since the meat here is so special, it would be a shame to have it too well-done and risk losing out on some great flavors. As far as doneness goes, go on the low end of your comfort zone.I would have asked for ""rare"" another time through, although this would be the equivalent of medium-rare or medium in France or Italy.A little shout out to the tea I got with my dessert, the Georgia Peach Rooibos. I usually can't stand peach-flavored anything, but since Bavette's was a pleasant surprise at every turn I decided to try it. The tea was smoky, the color a gorgeous reddish-orange, and the peach notes elegant and subdued. As for the dessert itself - we got a lemon-meringue pie slice of biblical proportions - it was one of the best slices of pie I'd ever had. The crust, made with vanilla wafers as opposed to typical pie dough, is crumbly and dark brown (kudos to whoever managed to get it out of the mold. The lemon curd was firm and tart, incredibly delicate and not too sweet. The meringue on top was unbelievably fluffy, had a perfectly clear flavor and had been singed to perfection on top - another 30 seconds and they may have very well burned the thing. In every dish, technique seemed to be put to the extreme, and dishes were often a few seconds away from being burnt, which is always when the best flavors emerge. For a person who doesn't often go for steakhouses (Peter Luger's in NY may very well be my arch nemesis), Bavette's is a reminder that steaks, as well as a number of other classic American preparations, can make for equally exciting and unexpected dishes as any haute-cuisine establishment."
"Had a wonderful meal at Bavette's the other night. Loved Bavette's punch first off.  Eating highlights included the ribeye (definitely order the ribeye as it's so good), salmon tartare and the butter that came with the bread.  We weren't huge fans of the wedge salad as it had too much dill.  Overall, wonderful meal. Loved the ambiance. Service was attentive."
"There's not much more I can say that hasn't already been said about this great restaurant. Great steaks (shared the bone-in ribeye) and the coolest of cool ambiances. Oysters, shrimp de jonghe, elotes...just do it all. It's great for a special occasion or for meeting up with your friends for drinks to feel like the cool, sexy, grown-ups you are. The service is definitely great as well. After I ordered the cognac sazerac, the waiter sweetly warned me that many ladies tend to dislike how strong the liquor is in the drink. My husband and I shared a giggle because this particular lady would never produce such a weak-sauced complaint, especially when we're talking quality stuff. It was a really great cocktail and I thought everything was balanced and finished nicely. So ladies, unless you only drink cosmos and amaretto sours, go for it - though it may be the only drink you need for the rest of the night."
"One of the wife's and my favorite eateries in Chicago. They have great steaks and their French dip is one of the best I've had anywhere. The prices aren't cheap but you get what you pay for and this place is well worth the price. My last visit I didn't really like my Caesars salad, but it doesn't hurt my overall rating and the solid foods are amazing and perfect every visit"
"I can't say enough wonderful things about this place! From the ambiance, fabulous drinks, delicious food, attentive Waite staff and great service"
"On a whim and with strong Yelp reviews, my wife and I decided to check out Bavette's for our anniversary dinner.I ordered the Old Overholt [rye] old fashioned and my wife ordered a French martini. Bread was warm, loafy, tasty yummy-ness.When we arrived, the interior was dimly, but romantically lit. Our waiter was perky and friendly and helped us pick out some good choices. My wife ordered the petite filet and I ordered the Fettuccine Merguez (tasty, lamb chorizo-like meat). Everything was delicious.Great place for a special occasion!"
"Wow, that was not good.  First though, props to our waiter Eric and the other staff who were the highlight of the evening, beyond that, nothing much good to say.  The Cesar Salad was topped with flaked brown trout, which was a substitute for white fish, which they were out of.  Why you would want any fish other than anchovies in a Cesar is beyond me and the result was mushy fish in salad.  The entrée was another experience.  We had the petit filet and steak frites.  The steaks were good cuts, but mine came with what I think was supposed to be béarnaise because that would be obvious and it had tarragon or something else green in it, but it tasted like lemony, so maybe it was hollandaise, not sure. The frites with the steak were so salty and could not be eaten. We are not complainers, but we did tell Eric about the salt to tell the chef and he credited $7 to our tab. That wasn't necessary, but appreciated.  Drinks were good, pricey, but worth it if you can grab a seat at the bar. Maybe we just caught the kitchen on a bad night, but I don't think we will be dinning there again.  I just noticed the many of the reviews are regarding the drinks, ambiance and appetizers so maybe the entrees are not the focus here???"
"Love the decor. It's pitch black in there, especially the lower level.  Had literally one of the best cheeseburgers of life!  Delicious. Try the dark and stormy. Can't wait to go back and try more things. Nice servers too."
"Bavette's is a great addition to the Chicago restaurant scene.  It has a classic, sexy, atmosphere with impeccable interior decor.  A great place for a romantic night out.  Food is on point- the double bone berkshire pork chop and bone in ribeye are the show stoppers.   The meat is rich and literally melts in your mouth, cooked to perfection- I'm still salivating here....If you're not in the mood to eat,  Bavette's is perfect for a nightcap, and Zach the bartender is the perfect man to make your drink(s); may I add he's extremely dapper and debonair? ;).  He makes drinks on the menu, as well as his own signature drinks (off the menu).  Watching him make them is almost as good as the drink itself.  He made me ""the south-side"" (off the menu) which was delectable.  It was so refreshing and unlike any other drink I've had, you'll just have to try it to see.  He then proceeded to tell me the history of the drink which was quite enjoyable.  He was extremely knowledgable and experienced in food and beverage industry making my first experience at this sultry, speakeasy-like restaurant that much better.  I'll be back for sure for the food and to pay Zach a visit.  A+++++"
"Lives up to it's reputation. The drinks were great, the food was excellent. I had their ribeye, and it was arguably one of the best steaks I've ever had."
"Redundant- but felt inclined to post.  Great place, great food, excellent cocktails, excellent ambiance, impeccable service.  Bravo."
"I only give them 2 stars because they have good strong drinks. I was very disappointed by the service there. I have reservations a week in advance and somehow they just disappeared...Hmmmm had a big night planned and then it was ruined!!! I expected them to try to do something...anything to help me out after I told them my plans and they put me on hold for 15 min and another lady got back on the phone.... acted like I wasn't on hold and then just plain out didn't care, said sorry I cant do anything the next table we have is for 11pm. WHO THE HELL GOES ON A DINNER DATE AT 11PM!!!! Very disappointed to say the least. I would have been ok with them seeing if any of their places within the company had places but they DID. NOT. GIVE. A SHIT.....No shits were given!. BLahhh-vettes"
"After a visiting the Merchandise Mart it was so easy to walk over to Bavette's. I liked the atmosphere and and the interior was creatively designed. I am not much of a steak eater but a friend offered to split a prime ribeye steak with me. I'm happy she did because it was made well and cooked right. They also had a large selection of Scotches, bourbons and whiskeys.  As a Scotch drinker I wanted to try bourbon and asked for the waiter's recommendation. He told me to Breaking & Entering and it was a great choice because I enjoyed it with my meal. Everyone I was with liked their meal very much. I would come here again."
"Pretty close to perfect! Worth the splurge. I had the whitefish Caesar salad, the Chicago-cut rib eye with pomme frites. More food than I could handle. Service was spot on, the atmosphere was subdued for an upscale joint (a good thing)."
"This place is very sexy...perfect date spot. Not a first date, as it's pretty pricey. Almost TOO pricey. The cold seafood towers were kinda ridic. Do people really drop $125 on an appetizer? All the food we did try was really good. The crab and avacado, the fried chicken and the shortrib stroganoff were great. The mashed potatoes...not so much. They are described as ""buttery"" with garlic and chicken jus. But what I got was a big bowl of potatoes that were swimming in butter. Like 1/3 of the dish was butter. This was just too much.I would definitely go back for another special occasion dinner. That I didn't have to pay for ;-)"
"I dined with two friends, and each of them ordered the filet mignon.  I had the pork chop.  Excellent food!  Even the next day, the leftovers were excellent.  We had a side of creamy spinach which was very good.  We tried to convince ourselves that it was healthy since it was spinach, but who are we kidding.  It was decadent.  I wish I didn't have to share it with my fellow diners."
"Where do you take your significant other for a special Birthday steak, when they're so used to expense account steakhouse dining?  Bavette's.  Their menu features a 25 ounce dry aged rib-eye... At $56 it is not inexpensive, but it could be two meals very easily, particularly if you order a few appetizers. This is the best steak you'll have all year.We ordered some appetizers, the dry aged ribeye, and also the braised veal cheeks. The braised veal cheeks were OK to good, but nothing in comparison to taste that the dry aged steak puts out.  It's absolutely amazing.  Easily the best steak I've had in many years.  I believe the SO agreed, which makes it a success. Every now and then you have a steak that's just way better than usual--""the best steak I've had in years!"" ...this was very much that steak.Service was pretty decent.  The waiter seemed experienced but newish.Showing up w/out a reservation is probably hit or miss but if you're willing to wait a drink or two you'll probably have good luck.  We walked in without a reservation at 8:30p and had one drink at the bar before a table was ready."
"Honestly, if you haven't been, GO.  Even with all the amazing food spots that Chicago has to offer, this has become my absolute favorite.  The ambiance is like an old time speak easy, and the cocktails match the decor - phenomenal.  Definitely get the duck terrine...it's too good for words.  Also, the wedge salad.  It's a SLAB of pork belly.  Holy Hell.  Of course, the steaks are incredible, and the sides are delish. I loved the brussel sprouts, and enjoyed the elotes (although, honestly, it was a little cream heavy for me).  Service is always outstanding.  This is place is 100% worth the hype and the wait list."
"5/5 in a true-blue Steak Town!!!DISCLAIMER: So, I'll caution you on several fronts: (1) I waited months to permit my bias to subside in order to let the rating rise to a legitimate 4 or better because of the Hipster problem; (2) I managed to evaluate the food and other criteria legitimately and immediately, saving the rant on hipsters as the finale; (3) I'm playing catch-up on my Yelp reviews because, frankly, I do work for living; and (4) do not read this if you are a hipster, as this one may legitimately cause you to cry about the failure that is your life.  So food first; then hipster rant.Bavette's did the impossible: it achieved a 5/5 on food and drinks IN A TOWN KNOWN FOR GREAT STEAKS AND GREAT STEAK PLACES.  You guys came out swinging for the fences as rookies and hit a grand slam.  I would put the actual steak up there with Smith & Wolinsky, Gene & Giorgetti's, and Chicago Cut.  I always let my server tell me what the chef recommends on anyone cut of steak at a place, and the Classic Chicago cut ribeye was perfectly cooked at medium rare.  It had a healthy sear without being burnt, was tender, and had enough au jus for both the dish and the sides later onward.  If you know your steak, this is one to make time to experience.  The knife was not necessary.For the fine-tuning on the steak, Bavette's has succulent options.  The place has au poivre, Roquefort, etc., and next time I will reluctantly try one of these preparations just to see if it is possible to make this steak any better.  The portion will leave you fully satiated regardless of the cut you choose.  Again, though, I fail to see how it could get any better.The sides were simple flavor with brilliant execution.  At the time, asparagus was in season, so I had a few giant sprigs, and another side of the buttery mashed potatoes.  Both were likewise prepared to perfection, as the asparagus had a slight grill mark on it, and the potatoes had a smooth texture that helped them slowly melt in your mouth.The drinks merit mixed rankings.  Among our party of four people we sample and shared the Death in the Afternoon, M. Laurent, French 75, and of course the Negroni for a basis of comparison.  The Death in the Afternoon was a perfect absinthe drink; no more need be said.  The M. Laurent was the butter sweetness you think it would be, with a rich and oily texture.  The French 75 was actually the only true aperitif, leaving a freshly cleansed palate for your meal with citrus-pine combination.  Refreshing.  However, the Negroni failed on execution--not ingredient.  Instead of a Negroni, I got sugar water with a fresh grass aftertaste.  Not so good.However, the wine list recovered the barman's slip on the Negroni because every single variation you would prefer on the red wine-steak pairing was present.  If you wanted to go big with a cabernet or Bordeaux, then go for it.  If you wanted a Gigondas/Cotes du Rhone/Chateneuf du Pape middle ground, you could support your steak rather than compete with it.  Finally, if you wanted a Pinot Noir or some other little Nancy wine, then the night was still yours. That Negroni embodies the sole critique: service.  I understand that it takes awhile to adjust to hype combined with a Friday night.  However, when you blow an 8:00 P.M. res. by an hour and forty-two minutes, I begin to think you did that on purpose to run up our drink tab and make more money.  By my next visit, I hope this is remedied, otherwise, the ice water will flow like wine in protest; but I can do better because I deduced the root cause of the slow service: hipsters.HIPSTER FACTOR: HIGH....nay, TEEMING!!!!The good news is that by the end of the evening, the food will have won over your affection; but here's a truth: I survived the 1990's.  Survived.  Maybe you did, too.  Want proof?  Experts can trace the origin of the Yet-ster (a portmanteau of ""yeti"" and ""hipster""), one of the earliest known hipster subspecies to the ""Two Princes"" video by the Spin Doctors, but as you can see, the Spin Doctors rocked the khakis rather than the skinny jeans.  Before you reach through your computer screen to choke me for even reminding you of the dam ""Two Princes"" video, please keep in mind that I did not choose to bring back this terrible tragedy in American history.Thus my feeling of annoyance regarding the service originates from a decpetion.  At first glance, you view the wood walls, the dim lighting, the aroma of the steaks, the quiet clatter of cutlery and china.  Your brain says, ""Steakhouse.""  However, the bubble bursts when a clone of the guy from the ""Two Princes"" makes a ""crunchy"" drink suggestion.  You get really angry when skinny-jeans Mary has an unsolicited wine recommendation, but you soldier onward.To summarize, this place is fronted and frequented by all of the kids who receive participation awards growing up as a child.  Everyone is a winner...just ask them.Overall, though, well done, Bavette's!"
"There isnt much more to add that others havent said already about decor, service and food. I will just say that I have eaten at restaurants all over the world and this is in my top 5 of restaurants not just in Chicago but anywhere. Go."
"Bavette's is a regular hang out for one of my BFF's and I.  We go there when he comes into town and it's now kind of our spot.  The first time I had a meal there I was thoroughly impressed for a few reasons:  Firstly, I don't eat a lot of meat, dairy or bread/wheat.  I'll eat these things every once in a while, but they're certainly not everyday items on my menu and I prefer not to indulge.  I found that for a steak house, Bavette's was surprisingly easy to order in.  I could order the food that felt good to me and not feel like a missed something amazing (although I'm sure I did).  I appreciate that.  Secondly, Bavette's (especially the downstairs bar and dining area) is beautiful.  It's one of those places that makes you feel sexy, flirty, and like playing footsie under the table (not that I did).Anyhow, I know that people say reservations are difficult to come by, but in my experience it's not that bad.  And, my friend and I have gone in last minute on a few occasions and simply waited at the bar to be seated--it always worked out fine.  For classic American faire, Bavette's is a winner, and worth a try.In my experience the food is better than good, I don't know if I would call if phenomenal (like some others have).  If your best meal was at Bavette's you're off to a great start, but don't stop exploring ;)The Cesar Salad is unique, but a little heavily dressed for my taste.  The lamb was divine, and the fish dish (salmon, I think) is excellent.  Also, their in-house bread is delish.  The drinks are also well crafted and yummy-yum.xoxo"
"I cannot stress this enough, the bacon ... yes bacon was absolutely delicious!!!This place does not disappoint. Wide palate need apply"
"Place was awesome! Food was great and the ambiance was perfect, love the pre prohibition feel."
"Bavette's I did not fall in love with you like I assumed I would after your rave reviews.  But I will be back nonetheless!I made these reservations about 2 months ago - hot lil' place here!  We arrived a bit early and were escorted in to sit in the lounge - SUPER sexy place inside!  Love it!  Good music.  Good vibe.  Love it.  We got a corner booth - good for snugglin'! And ordered drinks (old fashioneds) and they were fantastic.  Thinking we'd killed enough time and we should order food because it might take a bit, we did.  And I think that's where Bavette's lost its luster.  Our food arrived *maybe* ten minutes after we ordered.  And wasn't piping hot.  And gravy on the meatloaf and in the stroganoff slightly congealed-like.  I'm not saying there was a heat lamp back there, but that's the consistency of the food that arrived at our table.  It was tasty though - but nothing over the top. The fried chicken that I thought would be weird to order arrived at a table near us, and I decided I want THAT next time to share with lots of their delicious sounding sides!  Looked and smelled great!I think that this place perhaps might cater to the shell fish lovers of the city?  The oysters and such around me were presented gorgeously.  But alas, the allergies of shell fish....  Also, there was an air vent directly above us that cause our not piping hot food to be cold quite quickly.Again, I'll give another chance because I am in love with the sexy ambiance.  And they make a decent cocktail, but so far it was not worth the wait."
"HANDS DOWN FOR BAVETTE'S !The food was amazing, Mike- our server- provided one of the BEST SERVICE experience I've ever had and believe me when I say that because I am in the Hospitality industry :)First of all, the ambience was dark and warm.. If you close your eyes and just listen to the music and people talking, you'll feel like you were brought back in time or in a Mad Men episode :DSecondly, as i said, the food was amazing. We had the shrimp cocktail, soooo much better than i expected.The honey apple salad was refreshing and mouth-watering lolFor main course, we both had the filet mignon which came out with roasted tomato.. And we had whiskey ice cream for dessert..I'm saving this one for last because it was the best and I'm so glad I ordered it: BAKED SWEET POTATO.. heavenly wonderful *drooling just to think about it*Our server, Mike, was really attentive but didn't make us feel like he's rushing us out or like some servers keep showing up every 5 minutes to ask about your food. He seemed to know the menu well :) The food came out in perfect timing. I have always been a fan of Brendan Sodikoff's restaurants.. from Gilt bar to Maude's and Bavette's just blew my mind. Will definitely come back!!!"
"What an awesome place to dine! It is so cool and edgy while being relaxing. I came here for my wedding anniversary and we tried the martinis, wine, oysters, bone marrow and aged steak. Double YUM! The service was friendly and attentive from the moment we walked in through the door. LOVED it!"
"I came here to celebrate a birthday for my boyfriend.  They gave us a huge round booth in the basement--awesome.  Dark, intimate and not crowded next to other diners.  The food was amazing--shrimp cocktail came beautifully presented, same with the crab legs.  We also ordered the filet which was cooked perfectly.  The staff was courteous and not overbearing."
"Been to Bavette's a few times now and it is definitely one of my favorites in this immediate area. They have good meats and they have good drinks. And that makes a pretty good restaurant in my mind. The atmosphere if very classic and classy, lots of wood and mirrors and  plush booths to sit at. I've had the prime rib sandwich , kinda pricey at $21 but hey, its a special night out and the aus jus is off the chain. The steak frites are also a good option. All of the appetizers I've tried are very delicious. The drink menu is concentrated on classics and the execute them perfected. Service was great. Big fan of Bavette's."
"FABULOUS!!! From the moment we walked in the door the experience was  THE BEST I ever had!!! Delicious food and drinks but the best part of all was our waiter Brandon. Brandon is a wealth of information about the entire menu including drinks, he was so welcoming that I felt like I was dining with a new friend. If you get a chance to visit this MUST DO restaurant ask to be seated in Brandon's section, he will not disappoint!!!"
"I really, really liked. We celebrated a special lady's birthday earlier this month and really had a lovely time of it. A round of cocktails to start (champagne cocktail for this gal) and some oysters to whet our briny whistle, we were ready for dining.We shared the goat cheese appetizer. It was good, but forgettable. Eat the bread and the butter on the table instead. I promise. This butter will make you want to take the little dish, slide it under the table, and occasionally eat it all by itself when no one is looking. Ya know, if you are into butter, and sly about being gross about it, like me. SO GOOD.I had the roast chicken with a side of elotes-style corn. Amazing. This is the way chicken is supposed to taste. Crispy, flavorful skin, juicy insides...perfection in poultry form is found here. Of course, our table imbibed in a bit of the boeuf as well. Cooked perfectly (as it should be, the boeuf is in the title), it was juicy and lovely. A safe bet as well. Other sides that wowed: the frites, the baked potato, and the roasted broccoli. Nothing that really blew my mind, but all very tasty. I was surprised at the portion sizes. We all had leftovers (and took them to go), which so rarely happens at nicer restaurants. The chocolate cream pie was the perfect end to our meal. Perfect for four gals to share.Service was very good, despite the roasted broccoli taking eons (it was comped, of course). Bartenders were friendly, our server was knowledgeable about the menu, and very nice, and the host staff was very nice.Pricey, reservations necessary, but a lovely choice for a special evening out. I mean, you only turn 30 once, right?"
"wow, probably the best steak I've ever had.  absolutely perfectly cooked to a medium rare, even on the edge of the ribeye, which normally is cooked well done.  very tasty and a huge 24oz portion!  I was upset I had eaten too many appetizers that I wasn't able to finish this huge beast!  I also ordered an old fashioned prior to dinner and it was also great!  they had a ""mixologist"" there, it reminded me of the set up at the Whistler in Wicker Park.  So order one of their fancy mixed drinks and a steak and enjoy the night!"
"Great cocktails, nice wine list, tasty food, what's not to like?  The Bacon Roasted Tomato Salad combines two of the best side items - homemade bacon and roasted tomatoes - to create a starting dish well worthy for a great meal.  I presume if you're coming here you're not a vegetarian but if so you'll still enjoy the tomatoes.  My bartender recommended the Shaved Prime Beef Sandwich for dinner which was pretty much spot-on.  Didn't need the au jus, just great beef on what appeared to be a long ciabatta roll and it came with really good homemade chips for $18 total.  The cocktails were well made, service was friendly, and the food was excellent.  I think I'll have to head back when I'm in Chicago for my next visit, it was that good."
"Came here for the 1st time tonight and had the best steak I have had in a long time. Had the Prime Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye - medium rare. The dry aging made the steak incredibly rich and flavorful, the texture was terrific and it was extremely tender. Clearly this was a nearly perfect cut of meat to start with and was cooked exactly perfect. Our table shared the Shrimp Cocktail, which came with nice sauces was served on a big bowl of ice and was everything that classic steakhouse starter should be. We also had the baked goat cheese which came with a wonderful garlic bread and was also top notch. The Garlic shrimp de jonghe had outstanding shimp just like the cocktail and the garlic sauce was out of this world. Overall service was transparent and great. The thick cut bacon was the only disappointment, it was decent, not nearly as good as Peter Lugers. Skip it and leave room for the amazing steak. Also, the Lemon Meringue pie we split was humongous and delicious. Overall, while pricey, the steak certainly was among the best I have ever had. I find many steak houses to be disappointing, tired and costly. I overall felt that this place delivers on the steak and exceeds expectations."
"The food at Bavette's is absolutely phenomenal. Per another Yelper's suggestion, we ordered the Peppered Duck & Goat Cheese Terrine hors d'oeuvre. It is amazing, plentiful, and served with house-baked sourdough bread that is to die for. Ask for extra bread and BUTTER. Their butter is also made in-house. It is salted and creamy and oh so good. All of our main dishes were delectable, but also amazing are their side dishes. We tried the creamed spinach. What is in this dish that makes it SO GOOD?! (Actually, don't tell me. It's probably something very high cal that I don't want to consider when enjoying this dish again!) And the buttery mashed potatoes? Also great. Other Yelpers said service was not Bavette's strong point, so I was a little worried because I do really value good service. But contrary to those reviews, as soon as we walked through the door (7:00 reservation on a Sunday), everyone was super friendly, from the hostesses and our waiter, to the food runners and the busers. So either Bavette's management read those negative reviews and did something about it.. or we just got really lucky!"
"LOVE this place. The food, drinks, atmosphere and service were all amazing. We had the goat cheese appetizer, salmon for entree and the Lillet Rose' martini (delish). No room for dessert but I have heard that the chocolate pie is awesome as well. It's dimly lit and a great date spot. My only complaint is that it's difficult o get a decent reservation time but I guess that's how it works when a place is as good s Bavette's."
Loved it... Hip atmosphere... Shared a dinner and loaded up on the sides.... Elote is awesome and bacon side melts in your mouth.. Servers are very knowledgeable about food and not snobby;) I got the none in ribeye... Now my fav steak joint:)
"We had been told by many people that the$56 Dry aged bone in ribeye was the best steak they ever had, so my party of 3 went to Bavette's. We started with the crab cake (a little spicy, I've had better), then Crab Stuffed Avocado salad (very good), $56 steak (it was good, but expected it to melt in my mouth and it did not. A little chewy. I've had better @ David Burke's), baked sweet potato (very good), and mashed potatoes (no thanks). Next dessert...Chicago style Cheesecake (absolutely awful) and whiskey ice cream (very good). We each only had one alcoholic drink and 2 cokes. Loved the decor/atmosphere. But for $370, I expected a whole lot better :( Especially because we've been to 2 of the owners other restaurants that were really great. So tonight I was very disappointed :("
Service and food through our four courses were outstanding.  The atmosphere was a little too loud but we could still understand each other.
"Three words for an appetizer: GET THE BACON!Also, I really enjoyed the basement bar.  It was quite dark, but very cozy."
"Went for our 5 years anniversary! Very cool, trendy decor, friendly staff and great food!! The bread basket was superb! We had the rib eye and the petit filet mignon, both wonderful!! Some mashed potatoes that were delish and the chocolate cream pie was just heavenly!! We will definitely go back"
"Five stars, despite long waits. They deserve it!Food: YUM. The bread is served warm, and is thick and crusty. Portions are HUGE (good for sharing). Flavors are spot on. I'm drooling as I type. Service: colorful. Our dude was super chatty, super into wine, and SUPER DUPER into chatting about wine. He stopped at our table probably... 5 times to chat about Italian wine/wineries. Corkage fee: we did BYOB and learned bavettes has an interesting policy. No corkage fee, but you are asked to share a glass of your wine with someone random... Sort of paying it forward, I guess. It's a cute policy. Can't wait to return!!!!"
"Off the charts cool what they did with the interior and the vibe.  Seriously.Had some snacks at the bar but didn't get too deep into the menu.  Food wasn't memorable however so I can't really remember what to say about it, but it was good.  Cocktails are the standard 'mixologist-centric/retro/trendy' thing but excellent nonetheless.A great place to bring someone if you want to make an impression or have sex with them."
"Short and sweet: This place is amazing.The Maine Lobster portion was great (and tasted great) for it's price. The steaks are juicy and their seasonings are delicious. We ordered 4 different sides, all tasted great, but the Elote is a must!Service was outstanding, from the host, to bartenders to our server. Everyone is laid back, but attentive, they do a good job of offering suggestions.This is what a Chicago Steakhouse should be."
"Go!  Had to wait a couple weeks to even get a 7:45 reservation on a Monday night.  The host told us that they were actually booked through June during prime time hours even during the week.  Beautiful dark, comfortable, speakeasy interior.Showed up an hour before reservation and while they did not seat us right away, they were able to accommodate us earlier & gracious about it.    Great service at both the bar and table.  Stand-outs:  -  bread-  crab stuffed avocado salad - refreshing and light, what a wonderful combination- THE ELOTE CORN!  .....LOVEV GOOD:  -  oysters-  roasted chicken-  spaghetti & meatballs"
"Favorite date spot in the city!!!  Cozy, dark, delicious, perfect ambiance.  We have been here many times and have never been disappointed.  All the food is amazing, my favorite is the roasted chicken, by far the best chicken I have ever had.  The boyfriend says the steaks are simply outstanding, better than any other Chicago steakhouse.  We request Brandon as our server he is awesome and has perfect wine recommendations every time.  Make reservations today they book up fast!"
Bavette's had a great atmosphere and vibe coupled with fantastic food. This is really a tucked away gem. I would recommend hanging out at the bars where you still get full food service. Make sure you check out the awesome cave below as well. And don't skip out on getting a side of corn.
"My husband and I dined here for my 31st birthday. I was going through the Chicago Magazine's Best Steakhouses of 2013 and decided to gove this a try. We found street parking around the corner, and at first,  it doesn't seem great. The hostess area os a bit strangely located,  and chilly. But when you open the doors to walk in- o.m.g it is beautiful! The ambiance is sooooo romantic. Dim lights,  candlelight tables.  They sat us in a corner booth where my husband sat side by side. Our waiter was so nice- he recommended some sauces with our filet mignon and it was delicious. The sides are big and we split a baked potatoe. We ordered a medium and medium well- we should have stuck to medium for both because it was DELICIOUS. Soft-fall apart in your mouth because it is so tender kinda good! And considering this is a fancy place and we only spent $80, that's not bad! Would definitely recommend!"
"I just went last night and wanted to re-cap all the deliciousness in full detail before I forgot (like the other times I've went)To start off this is already one my favorite restaurants, I can't wait to go back and I was just there last night!! bread and butter -- they make this fresh in house everyday....it is SO good. You should at least try a little even if you aren't a huge bread person, it's that good. oysters - really fresh and deliciousceaser salad - MUST. GET!!  it doesn't sound like anything special but they make it with white fish and it's so creamy and delicious, I would eat this everyday if I could.roasted chicken - now I normally wouldn't order roasted chicken, but if you've ever been to maudes they have a really great roasted chicken and I figured bavettes would too (same owner and all). They did not disappoint, it was so juicy and flavorful!chicago cut ribeye - I'm not a steak person but this was awesome. cooked perfectly and also super juicy and flavorful creamed spinach side - I was skeptical but they make it with blue cheese and it was the perfect side.pomme frites- can't really go wrong with these but we had so much other food we didn't eat a ton other stuff I've had in previous visits but I can't recall in as much detail:beef tongue - sounds very strange but if you want to be a little adventurous, you should order this. It basically melts in your mouthfried chicken - good but not the best I've ever had steak frites - eh just ok, the ribeye was MUCH better shortrib stroganoff - I remember I liked this but I remember a lot of details about it sorry for this super long review, but I LOVE this place and think everyone should give it a try!!"
"This is my favorite cool, fine dining experience in the city of Chicago. Recommendations:Small Plates:-Thick Bacon-The best bacon you will ever have in your life. I promise I am not exaggerating. So good, you could mistake it for steak. -Bone Marrow-this could be an acquired taste but I love it! if you are like me and are filipino or have grown up in ethnic kitchens, we have a obsession with fatty foods and that is exactly what bone marrow is. It gets all the tasty slivers of fat and when you smother it on your piece of bread mixed with the jam and onions...YES. Large Plates:-Bone in Rib Eye: AMAZING steak. For real though. I have had steaks at steakhouses for years now but this is hands down one of the best steaks I have ever had. The vibe of the whole place is really cool and trendy. The crowd is young and professional and it is I time warped to 1920's France and the Gatsby Era every time I come here."
"Came back here again for other awesome looking dishes. Fried Chicken, Beef Tongue and French Fries were the highlights of the night, but eating all of them together might just be a little bit too heavy..."
"after reading about all the terrible long waits, we were afraid that we have to wait, but we found parking easily and were seated right away. we orderedbraised veal cheeksburgerfried chickenfrieseverything was awesome! especially the fried items (because they were fried in pork fat). the veal cheeks were tender and soft, but needed more pieces!!! will go back for the other items, but the steaks that the other patrons ordered did not look great."
"The service was excellent, as was expected of a classy restaurant.  We shared the crab salad and the wedge salad to start off.   I prefer my bacon crispy, and the bacon on the wedge salad was thick cut and still retained ALOT of fat.  The salad was tasty, but the bacon prepared that way was definitely not my cup of tea.   The sides were comparable to those at other high end steakhouses; the addition of blue cheese in the creamed spinach was a welcome curve ball though.  My filet mignon was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  My father's ribeye, the most expensive item on the menu, was yummy, but I've definitely had more tender (and less expensive) ribeyes."
Oh my god! The bone in lamb chop was un-frickin-believable and the atmosphere was great. Super retro while still modern. Sumptuous and still relaxed. I love whiskey so this was a great place to get a drink. If I wasn't a classy lady I would have licked my plate
"Our new favorite place in Chicago!I found this place on Yelp by sorting by reviews instead of the ad-fueled default filter. The minute we walked in we were in love; such a romantic atmosphere!They were kind enough to try to fit us in on short notice but it was the worst table in the place. Oddly enough, the host never mentioned that the bar area is first come, first serve; when we realized that we went right in and scored a cute little private area with couch seating and surrounded by candles... so cozy!Ben from the bar took amazing care of us and everything was terrific (do NOT forget to try the bacon side!).My wife and I LOVE to eat at the bar or in the bar area so this was perfect for us; we are from L.A. but perhaps that is not so popular in the Midwest...Either way, love, Love, LOVE this place!!!"
"Bavette entree prices are up there but the portions are decent sized and well prepared.  We started with the foie gras (rich and recommended as all foie gras should be) and peppered duck and goat cheese (just ok - not quite what we expected).  The pastas were excellent - both the meatball and pasta and fettuccine Merquez were delicious and generous with both pasta and meatball/sausage. The fried chicken wasn't particularly memorable, wouldn't order it again. The food alone is good but its the experience that makes it a solid four star for the money.  Great speak-easy 1920's ambience (6 of us had a plush booth) and the wait staff was friendly and fun."
"Excellent! I only hesitate to award five stars because we only enjoyed appetizers and cocktails, but OH did we enjoy them!! Yes, Bavette's relies heavily on its mood lighting, but it's attention to food and drink does not fall short.  We were wowed by the beef tongue and the generous duck terrine.I highly recommend this restaurant for pairs and small groups.  Even of you only come for the drinks, you won't be disappointed.  Bavette's bar is stocked with skilled and enthusiastic mixologists.  We'll definitely be visiting again."
"Bavette's is phenomenal and let me begin by saying that I will certainly go back.  This is the newest place by the same chef that is responsible for Au Cheval, Maude's, and Gilt Bar, all worth going to.  It is a great dining experience from the moment you walk into the door.The décor of Bavette's is very classy; low lighting, wood paneling, a beautiful bar area, and incredibly comfortable leather booths.  To be fair, the low lighting can make it a little difficult to navigate the seating area when you first walk in and we all cut corners a little too tight around some of the tables.  That said, definitely like the feel of the place.Like Au Cheval and Maude's, Bavette's has great cocktails.  I started with the Sazerac and was not disappointed.  Wonderfully blended, it was a traditional Sazerac with an absinthe rinsed glass instead of putting the absinthe right into the cocktail.  I definitely want to go back to try some of the other drinks.For dinner I had the dry aged rib eye and it was excellent.  The meat was incredibly tender and the rub really made the steak.  It gave it a tasty crunch while being juicy on the inside.  The steak was good enough to stand on its own and did not need any kind of extra flavoring or sauce; however, the béarnaise sauce was so good that I couldn't resist using it my steak.  The blend of spices, salt, and pepper that they give to flavor the steak, while not necessary tasted delicious.  I will most certainly be back."
2nd time eating there.  2 people ordered bone in delmonico strip steaks.  Not good.   Very difficult to cut through.  You shouldn't have any trouble cutting your steak at a high quality steak place.  First time was MUCH better.   Had the seafood tower.  Good cocktails.  Probably won't go back.
"AMAZING food, AMAZING service and AMAZING ambiance. I can't wait to dine here for my second time in a couple of weeks!"
"Nothing I can say will be different from the other 253 reviews of Bavette's, so I'll just say this: it was one of the best meals I've had in a very long time. The service, the ambiance, the food, and the drinks were all outstanding. I had the petite filet with bone marrow, spicy corn, frites, and the goldbrick dessert. Every bit of it was absolutely delicious. If I could afford to eat here every single day, I would. Go here...and quickly!"
"Food was AMAZING, service was great, and they have a very creative corkage fee...it's BYOB and instead of paying a corkage fee you have to donate a glass of whatever you're drinking to another patron of your choice. They have a great cocktail/beer list too. Prices were a bit high but well worth it."
"This one hurts me to write.  I was so excited to hit Bavette's due to some many favorable reviews and a deep affinity I have for all of Brendan's creations.  I was even taken there by friends who had raved about the experience.  The room was beautiful, the menu inviting, and the food was overall pretty darned good.  So you might ask -- what give Forks?  Why only 2 stars?  Here's the scoop.  The Chicago scene at times suffers from the ""too cool for school"" staff thing.  I come from 15 years of restaurant service and nearly 20 years as a professional person dining out.  It takes a great deal to wow me and my tolerance level for poor service is 'zero.'  I am compassionate that every server has an 'off' night.  However, bad and inattentive service is inexcusable and that is what we received.  Our waiter fawned over a table of young ladies and a table drinking big wines -- while we sat in Siberia.  His delays went without apology and I got the distinct feeling that he felt we should have been so happy to be there that any sleight should be expected.  Inattentive service flowed throughout the meal.  When the runner came with the food -- he had no idea what position to deliver the entree.  The table maintenance was an atrocity as steaks arrived without knives while empty glasses and app plates laid all over the table.  We received better service from the busboy.  My steak was overcooked (but tasty).  I don't blame the kitchen as I suspect the waiter fired the ticket late and then asked the kitchen to step on the gas.A great meal demands 3 things: Food, Service, Atmosphere.  Bavette's spit the bit on service this time.  Out of loyalty I will return and report back to y'all.  But for now 2 *'s"
"I can't wait to go back here. Ok first off the ambiance is wonderful! It makes me want to channel my inner Daisy from the Great Gatsby. The drinks are fantastic and although I didn't have the steak, the salad I ordered came with this succulent piece of bacon . . . hence why I'm writing this review. Yes, I am writing this review over a piece of bacon. It was that good. :)"
"This may not make everyone's best of Chicago steak list, but it makes mine.  The atmosphere offers a sort of throw-back, 1920s prohibition-era feel.  I can't think of a dining experience that I received better service than the waitstaff here.  Our waiter was attentive to every detail and was more knowledgeable about the menu than 90% of his colleagues elsewhere.  I will without a doubt re-patronize Bavette's."
"Finally made it  here.  Since my review will only echo what everyone else has previously shared, I'll make this brief:Late 19th/Early 20th century European atmosphereRoasted Chicken (didn't know that chicken could be that good, even the next day)Sweet Potatoes (OMG)Creamed Spinach  (OMG)Old Fashioned with Bourbon soaked cherriesDrinks go down easy and your bill will be highCan't wait for the next visit"
"More like 4.5 stars.Hands down, one of the best steaks I've had in Chicago. Swanky, dimly lit dining bodes well with sipping a ""Dark & Stormy"" (Get one...or a few. So delish.) The only real drawback to this place is how hard it is to get a reservation...I suggest planning an outing weeks, even months in advance. Worth the wait though. It's pricey, but as with any good steakhouse it's worth it.Enjoy!"
This place is beyond dark inside so it makes it the perfect place for bad hair dates. It will feel like you can't see anything when you walk in until your eyes adjust. I liked that. The drinks we had were excellent. That was the best dark and stormy I've had anywhere. I also enjoyed the punch.The steak was by far the highlight of the meal. Everything we had was rich with butter and I don't recommend getting the baked potato as a side unless you can eat a ton of food - it is huge. But back to the steak. I'd ordered the meatloaf and I wished I had ordered the steak instead. Since it was huge I ate a lot of it and it was by far the better of the two entrees. The apple salad we started with was light and fresh and so what we needed after eating all of the amazing bread slathered in butter. I thought the price of the meal - around $100 for all we got was well worth it. We will be back for sure.
"Can't go wrong, if you can get in! Such a great place to eat in the city. Has to be one of the best steak places. Wonderful food. Shrimp cocktail is a must. The bread they start with is amazing. Crab cake is great... salmon is also a good entree option. Just a wonderful place!"
"Five stars for the following-  atmosphere, bar tender, drink menu, Host /front staff, decor, and following dishes, fried chicken, frites, crab cake, corn, broccoli,  and oysters.  Truly excellent and priced well. I'd stay away from the pork chop, it was very very fatty. I was surprised.  It's a great place. Stop in the downstairs bar if the upstairs is packed.  Great music..."
"My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday and we were disappointed. We started with a dozen oysters, which were standard. The house made bacon in the wedge salad was fantastic, but the salad itself was grossly overdressed and very dill heavy. For our entree I ordered the petite filet and him the Chicago cut steak. His steak was inedibly salty and mine was nothing to write home about."
"Everything about our meal here was great.  The service was outstanding and the food was delicious.Our server was Ryan and he did a great job taking care of us.FoodWe started with the Beef Tongue.  I know it sounds weird, but don't knock it until you try it.  It was delicious and very tender.Four our main we had the Chicago Cut Ribeye.  Our server suggested getting one to share and even offered to have the kitchen slice it up for us.  This was a great idea, because I would have struggled to eat the whole thing by myself.  It was perfect with the Bernaise and the Roquefort cheese.For our sides we had the Elote Style Corn and the Thick Cut Bacon.  The Mexican style cream sauce that the corn was in was very tasty.  Thick Cut Bacon.... not much to say.  What's not to love about four thick cut pieces of meaty bacon?I had a couple Lion's Tail cocktails which were very good and hit the spot.Didn't have room for dessert.Overall we were very happy with out dinner at Bavette's.  We had no complaints about the service or the food and would definitley return."
"Freaking ridiculous had the stroganoff( get it ), fried chicken, bone marrow, creamed spinach, whiskey ice cream. Service was perfect cocktails excellent and really enjoyed talking to the hostess walked us through the menu and her suggestions where on point. Will be heading back there  to try the pork chop and everything else on that menu. There truly was absolutely nothing I could complain about the place loved the decor. My kind of spot 1920's baby!The next day I used left over cream spinach and made a awesome omelette !"
"Best manhattans in the city and super consistent . Fab waiters and waitresses, always a pleasure. Love this ENTIRE family of restaurants"
"This is a review for the bar downstairs.It was pretty crowded so we got seating downstairs on the couches/small tables. We were doing a bit of a pub crawl, and wanted some bites to go with our drinks. It was a sad moment when the bartender told us we couldn't order food on the ""carpeted area"". Basically, if you're sitting over a rug downstairs, you can't order food.Fail.So we just waited for seats at the bar and got food haha.I got the garlic shrimp with toast and a couple Old Fashions. The drink was solid, but not exceptional. The garlic shrimp was very tasty, and the shrimp very sizable. Drinks and food a tad on the pricier side for what I got though.Still for the ambiance (nice plush couches, dim lighting with candles, and a legit speakeasy feel) and service (the bartender was friendly and awesome), I'm a fan."
"I had high expectations given I'm a big fan of Gilt Bar.  This place had a different vibe but the part I wasn't impressed with was the food. There just wan't anything super inventive or creative about it.  Ordered honey apple salad, short rib stroganoff and the fried chicken.  I believe there's a way to make rich food satisfying without feeling like you're drinking a vat of fat and needless to say, that is what I got with the dishes I had.  Maybe I need to try it again but should I be in the area again, Gilt Bar would probably be my choice.  But now that I think about it, the bad taste in my mouth really started even before we ate.  While the hostesses were friendly and pleasant, one of them kept on accosting it for not having our entire party there by the time of our reservation.  Our friend was running late as result of GPS failure (LOL), and let's just say, she was not the most hospitable when 30 minutes after our 9:45 p.m. reservation, she still wasn't there.  She then threatened us by saying they couldn't hold the reservation for much longer.  The mystery of course was that the place wasn't even busy and after we finally got seated, there were plenty of empty tables.  If there's anything I dislike, it's this type of petty restaurant ""policy"" that just manages to spoil a what could've been a beautiful dinner experience.  You see, I still believe that it is an experience - not just the food (although that's super important) but everything else that is associated with the restaurant.  Oh well...some places get that, I guess this place doesn't."
"Our experience at Bavette's was wonderful. We arrived this past Saturday for our 6:30 reservation and we actually found street parking right in front of the restaurant, that was a good sign that we were going to have a great night. We were seated promptly and were attended immediately. For our appetizer we ordered the garlic shrimp which were wonderful. After the bread and the shrimp my husband and I were already getting full but very excited for entrees. I ordered the traditional filet mignon with the baked potato (which was enormous) and he ordered the classic ribeye. We were both gushing over how incredible everything tasted. I added the roasted garlic sauce and every bite was sensational. The reason I did not rate the restaurant 5 stars was because our waitress was a bit slow towards the end. She got pretty swamped with the bar it seemed like she rarely check up on us anymore. I asked for the drink list once we had our entrees and she brought it to me right away but took a while before coming back to see if I wanted to order the drink. Once I did order my husband was going to ask for something as well but once I told her what I wanted she just ran off and didn't even bother to ask him if he would like to place a drink order. Other than that this place was wonderful. We had the lemon meringue pie as dessert and left there very, very happy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."
"I was recommended bavettes by a Chi local and it lived up to their praise. Stylish classic decor, very friendly staff and accessible menu that I think stands up to all the usual named restaurants in the area. Also close to gilt so grab a drink there prior if you have the time. Wine menu isn't prolific but absolutely would go back and suggest to anyone looking for a great meal not named maestros, RPM or sienna. Just bring ur large size wallet"
"This review is way overdue! In a nutshell, this place is amazing! The ambiance is so different from what you will find at any other Chicago steak house. The positive reaction was immediate upon walking in. As for the service, the server was perfect! I was at dinner with another Chicago steak house manager and he was so impressed with the server's knowledge and etiquette. The server was professional, but not stuffy or pretentious. As for the food--delicious!!! My fiancé ordered a steak topped with bone marrow and he was in heaven! The server also took it upon himself to bring him a complimentary glass of wine that he felt would be a perfect pairing with the steak. We immediately made another reservation upon leaving. This place does not disappoint!"
"Went here last night- our waiter brandon was super nice, fun and helpful. The food was delicious as well! We got the oysters, duck and goat cheese terrine, a wedge salad, a burger, and the broccoli. The broccoli was my least favorite but the other 4 items were all equally spectacular. The drinks are great too, boozy but tasty, and you can tell the bartenders know what they're doing. If you're looking for a delicious meal, great atmosphere, and good staff, you should check it out. We will definitely be back. Make reservations soon, they fill up!"
"Great to PERFECTION! The side dish, bacon, omg, was the BEST side next to their broccoli. All I can say is...Mmmm..."
"Meat heaven!  Bavette's and Maude's are a tie for me (both better than Gilt), but they each have their own feel and menu specialties.  Like, Maude's the menu at B3 is perfect for Chicago winters and the ambiance is correspondingly cozy while still maintaining an old-school classy vibe.  Bavette's is better for steak, has large portions, a little bigger menu, and the space is larger.Myself and a couple girl friends visited Bavette's on a recent Friday.  The restaurant was lively during our 7pm res, but we were seated on the first floor right away.  Great waitress and service throughout the mealDRINKSFor drinks we tried a gin smash, vodka smash (they made the Maude's smash for my friend), and the Martini.  Smashes were the same as Maude's and equally delish.  Martini was great.  We also split a bottle of wine, and there is quite a range of prices on their wine list.FOODWe split the apple and endive salad to start - light and very tasty.  My friend also 3 oysters (you can order as few as three and they still bring out the whole iced plate presentation like you were getting a dozen), which she loved.  We all ordered beef entrees - steak frites, duchess steak, and meatloaf.  Loved them all.  Steak came cooked perfectly and the meatloaf was a winner.  We were stuffed but still finished with the goldbrick dessert with whiskey ice cream (with a candle for our birthday girl) - simple but fantastic."
"The food was pretty good but service was off. My husband enjoyed his fried chicken and I liked my steak, which I got with the bone marrow. I asked for a bit of bread so I could eat some of the marrow separately, but the server kept insisting that the marrow was supposed to be eaten only with the steak. He eventually brought me some bread but the damage was done and I was left with the distinct feeling that my server thought I was some hillbilly (I'm not, but even if I was, why does this matter to him)?  The service issues continued after we paid and started to leave. The server actually ran after us, and asked us in front of a number of patrons where our bill was, since it was not on the table. The implication, I guess, was that we had taken the bill with us and tried to dine and dash. In fact, a busser had picked up our signed bill with tip immediately after we had gotten up without informing the server.  This happened a few months ago, so perhaps service has improved or we just chanced upon a bad server.  But we haven't thought about going back so far."
"We came to Bavette's for my brother's birthday. We sat downstairs which was a bit basement-like. I think this is a suitable place for a birthday, as it is on the pricey-for-what-you-get side. I ordered the steak frites which was tasty, a friend ordered the shortrib stroganoff which looked very good and he said it was great. The baked sweet potato is good although be warned that it is very sweet and almost dessert like. I did not care for the elotes -- I think I will stick to having it prepared streetside."
"Seafood tower, fried chicken, ribeye was fabulous!Loved the ambience and the vibe.Servers were cool but seemed like they were busy at times..Overall it was a great experience and will go back!!!"
"Okay, so I have to say that Bavettes is my best meal of 2012.  Hands down...the atmosphere, the service, the suggestions, the cocktails, the wine selection...you name it.  I loved it.  At any of the restaurants..maudes gilt etc..the bone marrow is to die for (MY FAVORITE) - and I dream about it.  Bavettes was no different.  if you haven't had it i suggest you try it out.  It sounds creepy but you will not be sorry.  We also tried the following items and everything was insane. bacon roasted tomato saladcrab stuffed avocadopeppered duck and goat cheese (was interesting almost the texture of a pate so if you dont like pate then dont get it)southern fried chicken looked amazing but we didn't have itboneless filet (amazing)pork chop (amazing)short rib stroganoff frieselote cornbroccolisweet potatoesI think we sampled majority of the menu and everything just kept getting better.  Enjoy and go asap!"
"Bavettes is a special place!!!  One of my favorites!!!  From the minute you walk in the dark, beautiful interior is as inviting as the people that are working who are all warm, welcoming and inviting.I have been to Bavettes three times now and I have never been disappointed!!  Everything on the menu is spot on.  You can't go wrong with any of their steaks.  I personally really enjoyed the dry aged bone-in ribeye.  It's delish.  On this last visit, however, we ordered the lamb and I must say, it's definitely the BEST lamb I have ever had, but also the best item on the menu.  If you like lamb, you MUST try this!!!  The apps are all very good, and the wedge salad is one of my favorites.  They use HUGE thick slices of bacon, which could be the best part.  All the sides I have had are amazing.  I personally enjoyed the spinach, corn, and potatoes. though tI don't think you can go wrong.Also, be sure to check out the bar in the basement.  They seat for dinner down here as well, thought there are some bar tables to sit at as well as the bar itself.  Its very dark, intimate and very much like an old ""speakeasy"".  Love it, just to go in for a drink!!If you haven't been to Bavettes, I suggest you make a reservation now!!  It's a wonderful spot!!"
"Twins-a-dining-and-imbibing! Visited Bavette's with my loveliest mija, Caroline A., purveyor of all things glamorous and fabulous.If she approves, it's chic and how.Well, BB&B is chic.And how.Immediately took note of the uberobvious Gilt Bar + Maude's similarities.All good things, mind you.It's dark. It's amply candlelit.It's a smidge too loud.And it's hands - or panties - down sexy.Date spot approved with a second date guaranteed or your money back.My favorite drink of all time - which initially made its debut at Maude's - has triumphantly returned on the Bavette's menu. Say hello to my little friend, M Laurent.With Cognac, Champagne, Amaretto and a little hint of lemon, it's effervescent cocaine.Don't miss the Sodikoff signature meaty goodness while you're here: short rib stroganoff, pork-and-boeuf meat loaf and bone-in, dry aged steaks are a must. The smoked white fish caesar didn't bowl me over.The crab stuffed avocado did.Of course, the grand shellfish plateaux's are here. They still impress like David Beckham in running shorts.Kumamoto. Beau Soleil. Kusshi. Oh My.You can't go wrong with the aphrodisiacal.Bavette's is excellence.And I want more excellence."
Great place for a date or special dinner. Both food and service were great. Steak was prepared perfectly.
"My wife and I have been to many of the best restaurants in Chicago. This is not one of them, but not because of what you would expect. We came here on  a Friday evening and upon entering, this place looked great.  I love that the hostess greets you immediately upon entering prior to your coming  into the restaurant. When  we were seated, our waitress introduced herself the  walked away and served wine to 3 other tables and appeared to engage them quite often, after about 15 min she asked if we wanted an drinks which I ordered the lilette rose martini which sucked. We waited another 15 min as she continued to rub elbows with other patrons and then asked if we were ready to order but my wife needed a few extra min. Never once did she ask if it was our first time there or explained the menu. After waiting a few extra min, another random waiter who was a enthusiastic and nice introduced himself and asked, did the previous waitress tell you that i would be serving you this evening? We answered no, and he then asked if she even bothered explaining the menu, which she never did. Anyhoo, we ordered the beef tounge, bacon for our appetizers, the bacon was ok, but incredibly underwhelming. It was not thick cut, flavors was missing and,  as  explained to NY wife, her bacon is 100 x better. You can get a much superior bacon at Au Cheval, now that's some great bacon. The beef tongue was indeed very tender but I was not impressed with the flavor, maybe an off night for the staff or maybe most yelp reviews lack a sophisticated palate, you no se! I ordered another drink which was the champagne smash which was 8/10 ice,1/10 whole mint and 1/10 actual alcohol, suffice it to say, very unimpressed. My wife order the M Laurent which was OK.. Something my niece could put together Now for the entree...  Had the classic Chicago ribeye cooked medium and it was perfect, arguably one of the best steaks I ever had, cooked to perfection. It was a full 22oz at about 39 bux. Not too shabby. Wife had he roasted chicken with a side of potatoes and the chicken was blah. Overall it was an expensive experience that we wouldn't have again. The steak was to die for but that js certainly not enough for us to ever go back. It's funny because they whole time we both were kicking ourselves in the head because gilt bar is right next door and always a far superior experience... Steak isn't as great but the time is always well spent and the staff always makes sure we are comfortable"
"my husband and I dined here recently for his birthday and we were blown away by the experience! we were recommended this spot by a client of mine and I still can't thank her enough for introducing us to this little gem. the room is sexy, but inviting and, even though it was packed the Tuesday night we were there, the noise level was comparatively quiet. our server was attentive, helpful, professional and fun. I really got the sense that the employees genuinely enjoy working at Bavette's which always lends to better service for the customers. the food was impeccable. I love that all these seemingly simple dishes were done with so much care. I'm forever on the hunt for the perfect Caesar salad and I think I found it at Bavette's! the smoke whitefish was cooked to perfection and the dressing was bursting with flavor. our oysters were fresh and light, my stroganoff had the most quintessential ""melt-in-your-mouth"" short rib bites, and my husband was in heaven with his steak frites. do yourself a favor and save room for the chocolate creme pie at the end. you won't regret it!"
"NOTE:  This review is only for drinks.  What can i say...this place is fantastic!  Came here on a Thursday night with the bf.  We wanted to grab a nice cocktail and I suggested Bavettes and I'm sure glad i did.  Not too crowded but not empty either.  Place is dark, sexy and surprisingly large.   If Au Cheval is the mid twenties fun younger brother, then Bavette's is its more sophisticated, older 30 yr old sibling.  We sat at the bar and both ordered the Cognac Sazerac as our first drink.  My 2nd was a mint julep and the bf's was the Bavette's punch.  Wow!  Was that good!  I really want to go back just for that.  Our waiter was very friendly and the drinks were perfectly made.  Strong and well worth the $13 price tag.  I sure had a nice rosy glow to my cheeks after the two drinks.  Since we came in around 1030pm we didn't have a chance to try any of the food.  But if the drinks and the fact that its the same owners as Au Cheval and Gilt Bar are any indication of how the food will be like.. then sign me up!  Whoa!.. does that..make me ... dare i say it .. a Brendan Sodikoff groupie?!  :: GASP ::  Well if it is then I shall wear my ""S""odikoff Scarlett letter proudly! I can't wait to come back and try the food but more importantly.. I just want Bavette to Punch me in the face!  Umm.. I mean I just want Bavette's Punch.. umm.. wait.."
The best.
"Loved it! Wonderful food, service and so romantic!"
"Bavette's was great.  I would probably give it a 4.5 because our waiter was a little bit off, but he was still on top of service so it didn't matter, and everything else was very well done.We first had drinks at the bar, which were great:  a corpse reviver, which was incredibly smooth, and the cognac sazerac, which was perfectly balanced.  The bartenders were so nice and helpful, I could have sat there all night.Four of us sat in a booth, which was really comfortable.  We took advantage of their awesome corkage policy (you need to share on the of glasses with another patron) and had a great time with it.  Our table ordered a lot of things to share:Shrimp cocktail and oysters (both delicious and briny)Wedge salad and bacon roasted tomato (both great, but the wedge was best)roasted chicken (perfectly cooked and a huge portion)fried chicken (just okay, too much fry, I would skip this in the future)meatball and pasta (more meat than pasta, and completely amazing)beef stroganoff (extremely rich and delicious)baked sweet potato (huge and classic)elote corn (I liked, but didn't love this)We skipped the steaks, so I can't comment on that, but overall everything was well executed. We were really able to relax and take our time, and as everyone has said, the environment has a warm, old school, and dimly lit atmosphere.  A great time and a great place."
"As good as it is touted. The aged rib eye is enough for two, with just one side. The beef was soft and falling apart (aged to perfection). Proper whiskey sour. Excellent terrine (duck). Loved the crab, avocado salad was super fresh and perfect combination."
"Amazing.  I've tried em all, and this is the best steak I ever had."
"Good. Worth the money?? I'm not so sure about that. There was a ""chain restaurant"" quality to it, which took away from the ambiance.  I had previously eaten at Maudes Liquor Bar, and their food and presentation is almost identical to Bavettes. (they're owned by the same company)The steak was good, my BF got the dry aged prime rib eye, delicious.I got the Chicago cut, which was very chewy, but still alrightwe both got the bone marrow on top of the steak, which was a gigantic bone cut in half.  Only problem was...there was no marrow in it....only fat.  DONT get this if you're  a marrow fan.  all in all I had a really great time, the drinks were great, and I loved the cream of spinach.  It was just lacking a ""special"" quality that would compel me to go back."
"Hello Bavette, and thank you for being my new favorite broad in town! The minds behind Gilt Bar and Au Cheval have done it again - and I'm not complaining. Neither will you. Bavette, your food is delicious. I'm not a 'steak place' type of lady, but you've made the theme approachable. The menu is thought out and thorough. Your meat is top notch and your sides are scrumptious (the corn! the corn!). Your cocktails are quality and your bartenders are ridiculously talented.And then, your ambiance. The upstairs is a throw back to Frank Sinatra days with over-sized booths in a see-and-be-seen environment. The downstairs lounge is dripping in sexiness. Dare I say, this is my new favorite hideaway bar on a weekend night - fantastic music in a relaxed spot. All in all Bavette, I adore you and plan to be back often."
Decor/Atmosphere: The quintessential steakhouse- woody and dark.  Bavette's gets my vote for BEST decor in Chicago. Service: Excellent Food: Great- I thought my steak could have been a little bit more flavorful but all in all still great.  Sides were huge and plentiful.
"We came on a NYE, so they were only open to those that reserved a table ahead of time.  I'm not sure how the crowd or the wait is for regular nights.  The food was decent.  We ordered their much raved about huge burger, which was actually just okay to me.  That burger's got nothing on Kuma's Corner.  For appetizer, we ordered the duck and goat cheese terrine, and that was a very generous portion, and it was pretty good.  We also ordered braised veal cheeks, and that was very tender.  The flavor was good, but it wasn't very special.  It tasted like pot roast. We also ordered a side of elote style corn, and we weren't fans of it.  There was too much lime in it.  Overall, it was okay, but I don't think I will be back.  Service was very good though."
"Loved Bavette's.  We will certainly go back....great steaks, apps, and drinks.  Service was on point, for the hostess, to bartender, to server.     I enjoyed a very tasty Old Fashioned (a house specialty) while waiting for my girlfriend to arrive.  Very cool little bar area.  You need to experience the ambiance of this place for yourself.  The large booth we were seated in was perfect for a date night.We were both very pleased with our steaks.  A Ribeye and a Filet were both cooked to a perfect medium rare.  As good as any I can remember.  Apps and sides were tasty as well.  I look forward to getting back there soon!"
"Found a great new date spot in town. We loved it!It's a beautiful place, playing great music. Although tables were close and it was crowded, we were comfortable. Be aware, attire is dressy. Service was also pleasant. Our waiter made great recommendations. We had a baked goat cheese (toast with a melted cheese and tomato dipping sauce). Very good! Then we each had a filet. Cooked perfectly. Awesome flavor. Sides were broccoli and a baked sweet potato. So good!!We'll be back soon. Seems like a good place for groups. Looking forward to impressing our friends."
"Utterly phenomenal from start to finish. Bavette's exceeded all expectations for a birthday dinner from their perfectly made cocktails to the engaging service (I believe our server's name was Brandon?).. the romantic and dark ambiance (downstairs in the parlor) to the wonderfully tasty garlic shrimp.. from the most impressive Wedge salad I've ever eaten to their steaks prepared to perfection. I can't wait to return with friends for a cocktail and oysters upstairs, or for another cozy date night downstairs. What a wonderful addition to the Chicago restaurant scene!"
"Bavette's did not disappoint and all the hype is true, absolute perfection! Lovedthis place. Started with the baked goat cheese appetizer, then on to the delicioussteak, pommes frites and corn. Dessert of ice cream with hot fudge was to die for.Also enjoyed the cocktails. Service was attentive and professional. Shall return."
Space is very cool. Service is top notch. Drinks are good. Food was disappointing. I prefer Maude's.
"This place is unbelievable. I went here for my Fiance's Birthday dinner with a few of our closest friends.  The ambiance, the service and THE FOOD are all to die for.  Food Choices:Burger: Melt in your mouth, I can now die happy. Fried Chicken: HOLY CRAP. Everyone at our table wished they ordered the fried chicken after stealing a bite from the genius who did.Steak and Frites: Delicious. Filet Mignon Petite Duchess Cut: The birthday boy ordered this.  He was worried about the portion thinking he would still be hungry after.  The portion ended up being just perfect with our additional sidesRoasted Bone Marrow: This looked difficult to eat.  Our friend put in a lot of work scraping off the bone meat onto the bread. He thought it was worth it though.  Sides: Pomme Frites, Creamed Spinach and Buttery Mashed Potatoes. YUMAmbiance: Upstairs: I felt like I walked into the 1920s when I entered the restaurant. The music was amazing and the decor was divine.  The noise level was pretty low.  Seemed like everyone was whispering.  It was almost weird.  But it would be desirable if you wanted a nice romantic dinner. Downstairs (Parlor): More upbeat fun music. Even darker than the first floor (difficult to read the menu--thanks iPhone!).  Obsessed with the wooden taxidermy on the walls.  I just loved this place!"
Great food!  Killer liquor menu.  Bourbons are notable.  Bring a bottle of wine and share a glass with another table.  Warm and cozy atmosphere.
"Cool atmosphere that gives off a speak easy-ish kind of vibe. The downstairs is pretty chill, at least the night I went there, and they have a good drink selection as well. I haven't eaten there but hear good things."
"There was nothing I didn't like about my first time at Bavette's.  Our party of 4 arrived at 7:30pm but had 8pm reservations.  We were seated right away without any problems, which was a pleasant surprise.  The restaurant looks great with dark woods, high ceilings, soft lighting, etc.  I started with a Negroni on the rocks.  It was a tad strong but after the ice started to melt, it was nice  I ordered an Old Fashioned (on the bill, it showed Old Overholt) and it was PERFECT. CAPS LOCK PERFECT.  My party started with the Salt Cod Brandade.  Personally, I think Avecs is a notch better but Bavettes version is no slouch.  It is very, very good.For entrees we had the Fried Chicken, Short Rib Stroganoff, Steak Frites, and Hamburger; sides of Bacon and the Elote.  The person who had the burger said he preferred Bavette's burger over Au Chevals.  He thought it was seasoned better.(he thought the Au Cheval burger was a sodium bomb)  My fried chicken was great, if a little greasy. I didn't ask about the steak frites or the stroganoff but I didn't hear any complaints.  Elotes was really good too.  There are two things about our dinner I want to mention.1. While waiting for our first round of cocktails, we noticed the tables around us had bread and butter baskets.  I don't know if it's the restaurants policy not to serve beard unless asked but we had to ask.  It wasn't a big deal for us but just a tip for you breadlovers.2. The stroganoff and side of bacon came out first but the rest of our meal didn't arrive right away.  No more than 2 minutes after the stroganoff was served, the manager came to our table and apologized for the wait and comped our sides. We were so impressed that she took the initiative to approach us to explain that the kitchen was a little behind and that we would have to wait just a few more minutes. This alone was worth the 5 stars in my opinion. We ended with the Goldbrick Sundae, made with Black Dog gelato.  If you've ever had the Whiskey Bar at Black Dog gelato, you've had this sundae.  It tastes exactly the same.  I don't like everything at Black Dog but I do like this.I would recommend Bavette's to anyone.  You should do the same."
"Awesome place to have my new year eve dinner! Great atmosphere, definitely a great place to dine with your lover or friends. The waiter asked us about foods we allergic to!! They are so caring!! We ordered medium well ribeye, which is so great. Highly recommend this place!"
"Bavette's is awesome... from food to service to ambiance. I'm not always impressed with the new ""trendy"" places but this was well-thought out in terms of concept and the owners did a good job creating a cool atmosphere.As far as food goes... only had the burger and it was outstanding. One of those melt-in-your mouth burgers that gets better and better with each bite. Great wine selection. Bartenders rock. Can't wait to go back for a full (steak) dinner experience."
"Excellent cocktails, great service, amazing food, and wonderful ambience. We went to Bavetts last night with another couple. Our server was very knowledgable and helpful when it came to selecting menu options. I had the meatloaf, which was perfect. We did order the wedge salad earlier in the meal with the bacon on the side. I ended up eating some of the bacon with my meatloaf-highly recommend that little trick. Really, everything from the bread to start the meal to the chocolate pie and whiskey ice cream for dessert was outstanding!"
"My favorite restaurant! The steak is UNREAL. Elote corn and the mashed potatoes are to die for as well. Service is a little slow, and they take forever to seat you even if you have reservations."
"Lovely low-lit old-school ambiance. Deep, dark booths and ultra professional staff. I've been to Bavette's with gal pals, on date night, for double dates, for business dinners, after-work drinks, and I always leave happy. I must have at least one lillet rose martini whenever I am there, but their old-fashioned is not to be missed either! I like to order oysters, the filet mignon (ask for the tomato with the 10oz.) and as many sides as the table can handle. Do not miss the elotes, buttery mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. I'd say Bavette's is my go-to spot in the loop."
Amazing food at a great price.  The bacon that comes on the wedge salad is amazing.
"Very well done.  Its like Maude's and Gilt had a love child.  The space itself is very comfortable with high ceilings, exposed brick walls, and leather banquettes.  The service was excellent and knowledgeable.The duck terrine was simply amazing and the wine list was top notch.  Its not the best steak in the city but a very good restaurant and highly recommended!"
"I guess I am just really good at picking spots on bad nights. I say this because, from reading the reviews here on Yelp, almost everyone loves Bavette's and gives them good to great reviews. I must say that I did not have the experience that everyone else here on Yelp had.We get to Bavette's at 9 PM. We had a 9:15 PM reservation, so I was expecting to wait awhile and grab a drink at the bar. I was surprised because we were seated right away. Seems like we are off to a good start, right? Well, being seated quickly was the ONLY thing that went well for us at Bavette's.Our waiter doesn't bother to stop at our table until 9:15 PM, so we have had a 15 minute wait. Not good considering this guy literally circled our table about four times before stopping at our table. Maybe he got dizzy from circling so much, I don't know. Anyway, he takes our drink orders, which do not come until 9:30. I had the Sazerac, which was a little strong; it was clear that the bartender had a slight overpour. However, the drink wasn't bad because of the slight overpour. The drink was bad because the bartender gave me so little of it in the glass. Not good. So, the waiter finally takes our order. I order the Classic Ribeye - Chicago Cut, medium rare, with a side of creamed spinach. This was the first time in my dining history that I received a steak that had fat on the sides of it. I could not believe it; I am sure that the look on my face demonstrated my unhappiness because we only saw our waiter again once in the next hour and a half. Now, notice that I said an hour and a half. That's how slow these people were. We did not get out of there until 11 PM. I never got another drink because, again, the waiter disappeared on us.We literally had to track him down just to pay for our meal. Needless to say, I won't be back."
This place was excellent. A very fun atmosphere that makes you feel like you time traveled. Drinks and food were delicious. Great service.
Everything was just delicious! Beautiful restaurant and amazing service.
"For me, it doesn't really get much better than this.  I went into this wanting to love it and I did.Hubby and I came here on Valentine's day, sans reservations around 530pm, shortly after they opened and still found a table.  Overall, service was great, and our server was an all-star.Drink: we stuck to the cocktail list and for $12-13 a pop, I was impressed with the tastiness, size, and strength of the drink.  If you are anyway inclined to have a drink here, do it, you will not be disappointed.  I had a French 75 and another champagne cocktail and hubby had two whiskey ones.Food:  It is a little embarrassing to list the entire entourage of our table, but we knew we were balling out, so here it goes:Oysters and Foie Gras.  Oysters were very fresh, crisp, and beautifully shucked. The Foi terrine was absolutely divine.  Portion size was very nice and came with a delish compote and toasted bread.  Such a yummy rich dish.For the mains I had the veal cheeks, where were very flavorful and tender.  Roasted veggies were perfect.  Hubby had the classic rib eye, medium rare, which was perfectly cooked and delish.  I noticed that other comments said their cut was fatty, but just to be clear rib eye is one of the fatty cuts of nicer steak, and I thought theirs was very lean in comparison to other ones we have had.  I also thought the flavor was great and I believe they are grass fed, which also leads to a leaner animal.  Also ordered a side of bone marrow, which, if you like bone marrow, is as good as it gets.  We skipped dessert, as we literally had no room left.Can't wait for our next trip back!"
"We found this place on Yelp and came here for our 1 year anniversary on our visit to Chicago.The Spot: The atmosphere was cozy and romantic; very Parisian. The large brick wall, beautiful chandeliers and jazz music really give you the feel of an old speakeasy. The Wine: We ordered a bottle of Malbec that came way too cold from the cellar. After complaining, the sweet manager offered us a glass of a French wine while waiting for the bottle to reach room temperature. This was nice, but they really have to do something about these cold bottles. Both wines, nevertheless, were delicious. Food: WOW. Great quality for affordable prices. Endive salad was simple, refreshing and tasty. Goat cheese - absolutely amazing....like home cooked...but heavy! If you're ordering an entree you should skip it.The classic Ribeye steak was phenomenal. Simply one of the best we've ever had. The side of a HUGE loaded baked potato (the size of the steak) was really good. Service: The cute tattooed waiter kept making sure we're ok. The busboy folded the napkin twice (!) when we went to the restrooms. Brownie point for sure. Overall we felt very respected and the staff made sure we were satisfied. Bonus: The restaurant is located by a chocolate factory. Upon arrival we were greeted with yummy (though not overwhelming) fumes. We would definitely come back. We couldn't have picked a better spot in Chicago for our anniversary."
This place was extremely nice. My boyfriend and I went here for New Year's Eve 2012. We had a great time. Nice ambiance. Its kind of formal but then again you doing have to dress up. Great food.
"Absolutely amazing!!! Love the decor and the music.  The food was absolutely exceptional, one of the best dinners my husband and I have ever had.  Don't forget to save room for dessert!!!"
"By far my favorite place in the city. This hands down has the best food, atmosphere, and customer service."
"Love! Love! Love! New favorite restaurant in Chicago. Had been there before for drinks only, returned this weekend for dinner. We were seated in the downstairs parlor. Food: OMG! The food was so good! Huge portions, big enough to share which makes the pricing reasonable. Ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer, white fish caesar salad, sweet potato, ribeye, and cole slaw. My husband and I shared and couldn't finish.Drinks: You can't go wrong here. Top notch. The ambiance:  Dinner was nicely paced, not rushed at all. You don't want to be when you are here. Very cool, sleek and cozy. Dim lighting, smooth jazz, comfortable leather booths, and excellent customer service. Thanks for a great birthday dinner, can't wait to go back!"
"I've been to Bavette's twice now, and from what I recall, it's really good. The second time we went, we got so drunk that I would be lying if I said I remembered anything, but I woke up the next morning with a swollen face/fingers and a vile hangover - only attributable to an evening of rich, salty deliciousness and copious amounts of red wine.... both of which, Bavette's does well. Another thing this place is good at is ambiance - the same dark and glimmering deal as Gilt Bar. That dim lighting which makes it difficult to recognize anyone you might know/acceptable to completely ignore them, accompanied by a noise level which somehow drowns out any individual sound and creates a delightfully warm whirrrrrrring. I haven't found anywhere that strikes this strange balance quite like a Brendan Sodikoff establishment.Anyways, the food is great. Try the shrimp de jonghe, roasted chicken and elote corn. And the pomme frites, because how can you not.   All in all, great place. A pain in the rear to get a reservation right now, but definitely worth it."
This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago hands down!  I've been to all of the great steakhouses in Chicago and nothing beats the Dry-Aged Bone-In Ribeye here.  Everything on the menu is great...it is a must go if you live in or are visiting the city.
"One of the best meals I'd ever had was at Bavettes about a year ago. So when planning a trip back to Chicago for Fourth of July weekend I knew I had to go again. Bavettes truly did not disappoint. Everything was just as amazing as I remembered. The standout item is definitely the bacon, which is unlike any bacon I've ever tasted, or really anything I've ever tasted. I could have ordered bacon only and been happy! We ordered it with the wedge salad, which is highly recommend. One member of our party ordered steak, which was perfect once again. This time we also got the fried chicken, which is surprisingly great! The best fried chicken I've had for sure. We also branched out with mashed potatoes this trip, which were fantastic. Every part of the meal was delicious, from the bread to the steak. I also opted for a cocktail this time, and had the French 75, which is am amazing gin drink.Overall, Bavettes was just as I remembered it, perfection! I like trying new things when I go back to a city I've already visited, but I think I will be dining at Bavettes every time I am in Chicago!"
1. Yum2. Yum3. You must eat Chocolate cream Pie!!!
"My best friend and I have been impatiently waiting for Bavette's so we could eat some effing steak. So we did an uncoordinated happy dance when we were told to come in at 8. The space is really large - much larger than i expected. Old school-y and badass with bits and pieces from Brendan's other restaurants such as the light fixtures. Enough of that. The food. The in-house dry aged bone in ribeye induced a foodgasm. The honey apple and endive salad was large but delicious. The bacon roasted tomato ""salad"" was a thick ass slice of super juicy tomato with aptly thick ass bacon and watercress. You don't need bread to enjoy this BLT...but perhaps if you got some bread and butter service while you were eating it, that might just be the perfect combination of food things to put all up in your mouth. Just get it.  Otherwise we had the beef stroganoff, elote style corn, loaded baked potato, and peppered duck and goat cheese terrine. The terrine came with some super crusty bread and apricot mustard, and it was just perfect. Everything was so good. We're coming back in like a week to try the meatball & marinara and steak frites and everything. Especially the chocolate souffle. Beware, it takes 30 minutes to make it. If you don't want to wait, the malted whiskey ice cream is just too good. I am indifferent about dessert, but if it has whiskey in it I'm eating it. The goldbrick sundae should be real good, too. We tried some of the sauce with our whiskey ice cream, and clearly it's better than that shit you remember as a kid.Cocktails are pretty classic, and the whiskey selection is on par with Gilt. Instead of a selection of smashes, there are a selection of old fashioneds. My friend had the mint julep, which is a good julep for people who don't want whiskey all up in their face. I happen to like whiskey all up in my face, so I'm going to keep drinking my Whistlepig neat. The parlor downstairs is perfect for sitting at the bar, getting a drink, eating a burger, and wondering, ""Where do you even find a huge pineapple lamp?""The staff is amazing. A lot of the people we like from Gilt moved over to Bavette's. You can tell how happy they were now that it's open, and it made us happy. That was a lame thing to say, but look at all the fucks I give. All the dudes wear vests. Looking sharp. The bathrooms, as always, are cool and have the shower head faucets. And finally the hand soap thieves have been thwarted by some newfangled soap securer thingamajig.I'm always lurking around Au Cheval...almost an embarrassing amount. But now I'll have to split my time between the diner and Bavette's. It's like my parents got a divorce and I have to be shuttled between their houses. But that means two Christmas's, right?"
"Not as good as Gilt Bar in my opinion, but very similar. You enter through a large door into a mix between a speakeasy and a bad Weed street nightclub from the early '00s. Then the hostess allows you to enter the actual restaurant which has a decidedly speakeasy vibe with dark wood, my grandmother's couches (minus the plastic covering) and lots of low lighting. The bar menu is nearly identical to Gilt Bar. My drinks were well made and served quickly.All of the food we tried was OK, but nothing was yelp worthy. I was particularly disappointed by the crab cake - I expected for $20 it would have a significant amount of crab in it. It was mostly breading and while the accompanying sauce was tasty, it overwhelmed the limited crab flavor.  We shared the burger, the hangar steak and the veal cheeks for our main courses. The veal was the best of the three but nothing you couldn't make at home. It made me feel like I was getting old, because all the flash of the restaurant wasn't enough for me to want to come back."
Bavette'sLike Maude's but darker.Delicious.   Expensive.   Pretentious.   Lovely.
Came here on a Friday right after work (630)  to celebrate a great week. No reservations so we weren't sure what to expect - they asked for our number and said we could sit anywhere at their two bars. Loved siting at the cozy lower level bar with friendly and knowledgeable bar tenders! The drinks were top notch and well crafted. The food was excellent. The bacon was some of the best I've ever had. The steaks were top notch. Everything was of the highest quality. I even loved their place settings too :) I can't wait to come back!
"Selfishly, I am a little upset that Bavette's has gotten so much recent exposure, available reservations are now 3 months out! On the bright side, I've already eaten there twice and it is by far my favorite restaurant ever. Amazing service, delicious food, and great ambiance. What more do you need!"
"There are no words to describe how much I love this place.  The charm and style are perfect and so different than the over hyped, sterile environments that keep getting pumped out lately.  This trip to Chicago was my favorite and I'll be dreaming of that Duck Terrine for a long time.  YUM!  The lounge area downstairs was very cool as well.  Totally different vibe and I loved it."
"Tonight's experience was less than stellar. I fear Bavette's is getting too big for its britches, starting to suffer from an Emperor's New Clothes effect -- people who don't really know what they're talking about blindly praise it and the restaurant believes the hype and stuff starts to slip. It's drinking its own I'm-so-cool Koolaid. What was especially disappointing tonight was the service. Our server, while friendly, struggled to describe menu items we asked him about. Even worse was when we attempted to ask about wine. He was not knowledgeable at all and when you're paying top dollar for food and ready to buy a nice bottle of wine, you want to feel like your server has a clue about the wines on the list. Not so. We awkwardly had to ask for him to get someone else who might know the list better to come over because all this guy could tell us about 3 different wines from 3 different regions was that they were all ""great"" and had ""dark fruit."" Uhhhhh, thanks. I knew more about wine than this guy; my dad, who is a negotiant, knew more about wine than this guy. Train your servers, Bavette's. The manager who came over was marginally more knowledgeable, but still seemed not confident. Personally, I think if you have $600 bottles of wine on your list, you should have a som on the floor who knows their shit. Seems like a no-brainer. The food was solid, per usual. Maybe richer and saltier than I remember. We were seated late, maybe 8:20 on an 8pm res. Not too big a deal. I was a big fan of this place, but in my opinion, it's slipped. Took my family from out of town here to impress them and we were all underwhelmed."
"First impression was that this place was very dimly lit cave with a slightly odd crowd. It was also rather loud for a restaurant. But all that changed rather quickly. Although the darkness and music were not to my taste the service and food were undeniably amazing.To begin, although we showed up early for our reservations, the hostess was able to seat us quickly and early. This was very nice considering we didn't anticipate how quickly we would arrive and find parking. The server was absolutely AMAZING. He began by detailing the oysters on the menu and almost immediately asked if either of us had food allergies. I have a horrible shellfish allergy, so I was impressed by the fact he asked and cared to tell the kitchen. Both the bus boy and server checked on our table regularly even though the restaurant was rather full. I was amazed at how quick and courteous they both were, I can't say I've had service like this in any other restaurant.On to the food: considering the appetizers were predominantly seafood, I cannot comment due to my allergy. However, both my girlfriend and I ordered the Steak Frites medium rare topped with garlic. It was cooked PERFECTLY. The fries were crispy and the steak was flavorful. I was amazed at how cheap it was for the quality. We finished off our dinner with the cheesecake. I could do without the raspberry glaze, but the cheesecake itself was extremely good. My girlfriend went at it like she'd never seen food before. All in all the experience was great. Still not a fan of the music or darkness of the restaurant, but we will definitely be returning for the food and service soon. Also, just to give reader's a feeling for the price of a date, our bill was approximately $110 (less tip) for the two of us."
"Decor is beautiful. Very spacious seating and perfect sound/ lighting. We started with the Garlic Shrimp De Jonghe and fresh oysters. Both were perfect. The oysters were very fresh. For entrees, the Chicago Cut Ribeye, (ordered medium rare, perfect) Steak Frites and Pork Chop. Everything was amazing, but the pork chop really stood out. So tender, a must try! Elote style corn was a great side. Not too heavy and full of flavor. Service was perfect. High quality ice. :)I want to go back asap and try the crab cake, ceasar salad, fried chicken and stroganoff."
Food was good but not worth the hype. A little too dark in the room but nice romantic feel. Drinks were significantly marked up compared to other comparable restaurants. Cuts of beef are excellent but I found the food in general to be over salted. Steak frites and broccoli were cooked to perfection.
"When you eat out as often as I do, it takes something real unique to make it a memorable dining experience.  Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of amazing places in this Chicago, but a lot of them start to blend together.  Bavette's definitely stands out from the crowd, and here's why:From the time we arrived to Bavette's (9PM) to the time we left (12AM), we were treated to an awesome, knowledgeable staff; unbelievable food and a truly unique ambiance.  The main floor decor is a mix between modern and 1930's Chicago.  As Ron Burgundy would say, ""...it smelled of rich mahogany and leather-bound books.""  It's classy and sexy.  I highly recommend dressing to impress at this place -- dudes, leave your going out shirt at home and do it up with a sport coat, even a suit is at home here.The food is excellent.  We had:Peppered Duck & Goat Cheese Terrine:  Was not what I expected, but in a good way.  It was a spread, if you will, that went fantastic with the toasted bread served with it.  The duck was well done with the cheese pairing, came out like a loaf.Seafood Tower (can't remember the exact name):  It was two levels of oysters (west and east coast), king crab legs, ceviche, and shrimp.  It came with a few cocktail sauces which paired well.  It was amazing, the seafood was so fresh.Pommes Frites:  Outstanding.  Crispy and the perfect amount of salt.Cocktails:  I tried all three of their old fashioned's and had a glass of white wine with the seafood (yes, I got a little carried away but whatever).  Let me put it out there that I'm an old fashioned connoisseur (of sorts) and I tend to judge a ""mixologist"" by how well they construct my cocktail of choice.  Let me tell you that these were some of the best I've ever had.  Period.  After dinner, we went downstairs to their lounge which has a different feel from the main floor.  Upstairs, they played great, classic music like Frank Sinatra, etc.  Downstairs is more textured, laired electronica.  It's dark lit, intimate, and a great change.  I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!  Definitely one of the most memorable dinners I've had in a really long time.  I'll go out on a limb and say that this is my favorite new restaurant in Chicago.  Enjoy!"
"We made reservations and they made sure to put us right next to the door to freeze. I believe this is the ""you are an as5hat to make an reservation and are not cool enough"" penalty.Because we are in our 40's and while of an age to afford expensive dinners - we however get the shitty treatment decree. ""Though shall always kiss as$ to those who might not have the $$$ & most likely won't tip well. Those who might have the $$$ and will tip you well... make sure to alienate and treat rudely.I soooooo want to know how that works for the bottom line."
"It's hard to add to what so many others have already said.  There is a little something for everybody.  I will have to say the pork chops are the best I have had anywhere!  How can pork chops be possibly that exciting, right?!The lamp and steak are also excellent and the service keeps getting better. This is my third time there, and our server knew we were a slightly rowdy business group of six but he didn't miss a beat. Again, like others have mentioned, the atmosphere is cool and people of all different tastes appreciate it.  I will be back again, as long as I can get a reservation (which is getting harder and harder these days)."
"Hold your breath when you walk from the modern front vestibule to the main dining room. It is one incredible reveal- One Yelper said the atmosphere was all ""boozy, schmoozy"" and I can't think of better adjectives! The sexy lighting will make just about anyone look movie-star perfect and the jazzy tunes add to the supper club vibe.We were seated on the main floor in a semi circular booth in the back, which was cozy and semi private while giving us great views of the bar.  Our waiter was socially awkward and was fond of calling me ""dear"" in the most condescending of tones, but I stopped caring once I had a martini in hand.We ordered:- Roasted Tomato Bacon Salad: A salad to rule all salads. THICK SLICED House Cured MAPLE BACON & a giant roasted tomato- Wedge Salad: Hardly got to taste this for fear of having a finger chopped off by it's protector/my partner. He said it was awesome. The greek yogurt herb dressing was a  tasty twist.- Medium Rare Filet: No-knife-needed, perfectly cooked- Wet Aged Rib Eye: HUGE and full of flavor. Make your man order it so you can have a bite.- Blue Cheese Creamed Spinach: This ended up taking the place of dessert, and I couldn't have been happierThe portions are large, but that doesn't stop you from wanting to order one of everything on the menu. Go here hungry and go often."
"Excellent food, great service, beautiful design, AND great music.Went to have a late dinner with my fiancé and was really happy with the whole experience!Check this place out, you'll love it."
"This is how NOT to run a restaurant.-the host stand. What the hell is that? I was scared to death when we walked in. Our reservation said ""Anniversary"" maybe the hostesses [or anyone] could say ""Happy Anniversary""-the table wasn't set, when it was set, the side plates were chipped- Most awkward server [Julio] ever. We wait 7ish minutes for him to arrive and then get rushed through ordering everything over the next 3 visits we get from him-- including the ""Official last call for the kitchen"" excuse me? Was there an Un-Official last call?-there was lipstick on my husband's martini glass-Appetizer. Good crab cake, oysters, and crab/avocado salad. The food runner kept putting my husband's food down first, even though she was auctioning food off when she got to the table. -we order second drinks and are told after the delivery that they are doing the ""Official last call for the bar""... again? What? We order another round.-Entrée. Food is delivered [husband first, again]. My steak was good. Perfect temp, but under-seasoned. The potato had some un-rendered bacon on it. The elote was good, the fries were fries. My husband's steak, however, had the most gristle we've ever seen in a filet. Between the bone and the steak was a huge mess, and the steak was all lobe-y and just inedible. The bone side always cooks more than the rest- we know that- but it was a hard medium on a rare steak. He's upset [it's an $80 steak, and it's a shit cut]. -We tell Julio the steak is bad and just give it back. He offers half of my steak to my husband [he doesn't know that I don't share well, but that's fine- I want my husband to eat] as a remedy, and asks if there's ""anything else?"" No apology, no nothing. Julio goes to the kitchen, and comes back with a retort ""the kitchen says that cut generally has more fat on it"". A little fat is one thing. The piece that he got was a mess. Ok, so I give up half of my steak, but they took my husband's fork and knife with the steak and forgot to mark the table again, and now he can't eat. So, we have to ask for silverware. -Some dude comes waltzing up to our table, sleeves sloppily pulled up, tattoos up his arms [generally managers look more put together than that, also, this is our only way of identifying him] and from two feet away *condescends at us* ""You're sure you don't want anything else?"" Then proceeds to lean over, plant his hands on the end of the table like he's going to do push ups, and talk at us for a minute. Never apologizes. Never tries to make it better. Just talks at us, and walks away.***Say You're Sorry!!!! Nobody apologized! Nobody did anything! They just talked down to us like we were in overalls and had straw coming out of our mouths!-MGR walks away and the server comes by to tell us that the steak is off the bill. We tell him the MGR hasn't done him any favors, and say ""Nobody apologized"" and he THEN says, ""I'm sorry, Satisfaction is our priority here.' -We are so mad, we need to leave. Now. Every single thing has been wrong to this point and nobody cares.  So my husband says [the entire entrée course and 2 cocktails each are on the table] whatever you think is fair that we pay for, and we'll take the check. Julio's got our check in his pocket, with only the one steak taken off. Says ""we got the steak, here's everything else"". $240 and we don't eat 3/4 of it because nobody could be bothered to *ahem* fucking apologize.Awful. Awful. Awful. Never again."
"I was thoroughly impressed with this slick new bistro in River North and can't wait to go back.The Room:The designers did a great job mashing up vintage and modern in a way that avoids being overdone or pretentious in the least. There's a real sultry vibe which is accentuated by the jazz music and low lighting. A great date spot.Drinks:I tried the signature old fashioned. The bartender recommended a certain brand of whiskey (name escapes me) that had an amazing smokiness to it. Loved it - one of the best old fashioned I've had. We had a nice of burgundy with dinner that they decanted for us. Menu:Steaks are at the core of the menu but there are other options like hand-cut spaghetti and southern fried chicken. For our appetizers we ordered the roasted bone marrow and the baked goat cheese. Both were excellent. The baked goat cheese paired perfectly with the wine. I had the steak frites and a side of grilled tomatoes for my entree. While I have no complaints about my dinner, I regret not trying some of the more involved dishes that kept getting delivered to the tables around me. Service:Understated and friendly. Our waiter made several good recommendations on menu options, although she recommended pretty much everything on the menu. I didn't sense any pretension and thought we were well taken care of.  A few reviews have complained about the hosts. I disagree - they were kind enough to hold our reservation even though we were twenty minutes late. To summarize, Bavettes is the best of the bevy of hip new restaurants that opened in the last year. I thought it was far superior to Au Cheval, which is owned by the same people. I love trying new places, but seldom do I leave and want to make a reservation to come back the next weekend."
One of the best steakhouses Chicago has to offer.
"My brother and I were in town for a convention as we are always on the lookout for interesting dining experiences our interests were peaked by this place.  Unfortunately we failed to make early reservations but were informed that the bar was full service. The atmosphere was classy but warm and busy but not crammed.  We got in around 630 or 7 and quickly found a spot at the bar.  Two very friendly bar tenders welcomed us and offered us drink menus.  Looking at the bar we decided we needed cocktails even though they are not usually our thing.  Upon asking for a recommendation we were told the Old Fashions were a bit of a house favorite.  I had never had one before but I feel the bar is now set pretty high if I ever order another!  The bar tender took her time crafting our drinks not out of inexperience in my opinion but out of care and I could taste and smell every bit of it.Next we ordered some appetizers: some oysters for me (they had a few choices here and I went for Wellfleet) my bro had the garlic shrimp.  Both items were served just how you'd expect but done extremely well.We chose a couple of wines to go with our dinner and got some assistance from our helpful bartenders but could not help but think that a place with bottles of wine selling for over $500 should have a sommelier.Dinner choices were varied but we were both looking for steak so I don't remember too many of the other options.  I went for the steak frites au poivre style which came with very nice fries and peppery steak. The stars start getting deducted here.....I ordered medium rare and got medium at best.  Still it was tasty and had a nice texture.  My brother got the fillet also medium rare....at first I thought his was over cooked a bit also but it may just be it had been allowed to rest (which is proper) and just wasn't dripping juices.  Both came with a bernaise sauce that was a tasty addition.  I ordered cream spinach which was a cheesy baked variety with lots of flavor while brother got the roasted tomatoes, big beefsteaks which blew us away with their simple tastiness.  Bottom line on the steaks perhaps you should ask your server about the house interpretations of done-ness or order a little rarer than you like.I switched to beer and my brother to scotch at this point.  He commented that some of the scotches were rather uncommon and well picked.  All I have to say is 3 Floyd's Alpha King really is a great beer.The other reason I can't give 5 stars is that at this point the bar was getting busy and our bar tenders did start to get into the weeds a little.  I asked the bar tender to surprise me with one final drink....I was very surprised....she forgot!  But I didn't get charged and perhaps it was not the proper time to throw her a curve.Overall this place is fantastically classy in an inviting sort of way with lots going for it and I would love to return (calling ahead and getting a table next time) and highly recommend.Side note:  I never know if I should be rating a place based on what it is or verses all restaurants out there.  Bavette's is up there with some of the best restaurants I have been too so I did hold it to a higher standard in my ratings perhaps it should have a 4.80 stars but it wasn't perfect so I can't go with 5."
"I've been to Bavettes twice. The first time I would say 5 stars. Amazing food and service. My last visit was three at best. Hats off to a great bartender who is a true mixologist. Had a couple appetizers including duck terrine and shrimp cocktail. The terrine was ok, needed the jam to bring the flavor. The roasted Tomato salad was good and the side of two large pieces of bacon the best addition.  The steak is where it fell apart. Ordered their signature bone in dry aged ribeye. It arrived like warm at best. Asked for it to be warmer. No one apologized for it being cold, and in fact it almost appeared the server didn't really care or believe us. Came back having been under the broiler.  Was average tasting.  The Pom Frittes were ok. Overall just ok. So I'm unsure if I'll rave as much about it going forward. I love the vibe there. It's warm and inviting. Honestly? Even coming out $8 ice cream would have been a nice I'm sorry for a cold steak. So Bavettes, please rethink how you handle cold food!!!"
"i really love anything from this restaurant group.  it's one of my favorites.  everything was delicious.  ordered the goat cheese and duck terrine, steak, elote, and the chocolate pie.  even the free bread was delicious."
"I've found my favorite bar in River North. And given the proximity to work and home, I've found what may become my favorite bar, period.I've been working my way down through 30 of Yelp's ranking of the top craft cocktail bars in Chicago. Three had stood out spectacularly: Violet Hour, Maude's and Whistler. After visiting Bavette's this last weekend, I have another on the list. And two blocks from where I live, no less.Zach at the bar downstairs was fantastic - there to offer anything, there to chime in with cheerful witticisms but never intrusive. I'm hugely partial to places with friendly bartenders, and a check-plus for Bavette here.We only had appetizers but those were great as well.Finally - I was so happy to find the $3 shots of Old Heaven Hill Bourbon (served up with pickle juice chasers which absolutely hit the spot)."
"Officially open for business but not officially promoting their opening (the soft open concept). I went last night and ate a lot, tried a lot of things and took a lot photos. No full review yet, it's soon soon after they are serving the public, but I'll post the pictures now. The decor, lighting and atmosphere alone will keep bavette's slammed, and then you get to enjoy the food and drink. Also, definitely check out the downstairs 'parlor'. I love the faux animals heads and the wood paneling combined with the original stone work. The music is a little more upbeat too which makes downstairs an awesome place to end the night, or any night."
"Dinner was fabulous!  Hostesses as you enter a small front area need more training and education.  They just appear to be ""hanging and chatting""...annoying. Valet between Gilt and Bavette's the worst and most unprofessional ever.  Pouring rain. Offered no umbrellas. Don't open car doors for either driver or passengers.  I want my tip back on top of the $14 they charge and didn't earn or deserve.  So, dining very good...staff greetings and farewells to this fine dining experience need work."
This place distinguishes itself a one of the Chicago Greats.  It makes its own path.
An amazing gastronomic experience! went to central standard - which i really like - and found it closed down.  we went to bavette's which is one block down by gilt bar.  it is charming old world french decor and has a warmth and intimacy. we didn't have to wait and did not have reservations.  the food was simply amazing.  i had the short rib papardelle. i am not a particular fan of red meat but it was mind blowing.  it had a slight carmelization to the outside and the meat was so tender and juicy.  the pasta was clearly hand made and the sauce outstanding.  we started out with the foie gras.  i thought it was a little pricy at 18.50 but changed my mind once it came. it was served wrapped in the duck fat - which sounds gross but is actually amazing. it was also served with blackberry sauce.
"Most amazing experience eating out I have ever had. My wife and I were in town from San Francisco and put a lot of effort into finding the perfect restaurant to eat. From the hostess, to the server to the bartenders in was amazing. The staff was knowledgable and gave great recommendations. The filet, rib-eye, mash potatoes and sweet potato were outstanding. The server named Johnny was great and provided us with things to do after dinner and was spot on with his Green Mill recommendation. The Scottish bartender was awesome. Great conversation, very knowledgable and down to earth.Overall I have never met a staff who was just sincerely nice. I mean everyone was. People that were not even serving us talked to us and knew we were from SF.You are missing out if you don't go here."
"I thought I'd seen the height of gastropubs and steakhouses... Bavette's proves that there are always more amazing things that Brendan Sodikoff and his gang can come up with. Fantastic ambiance, great service, amazing cocktails, a great selection of wines, and best of all - some of the best food I've ever had. The bone in ribeye was out of this world, the chocolate souffle was soft, fluffy, delicate, yet deeply flavorful, even the pomme frites were so tasty (cooked in pork fat. Of course)Just go here. You won't regret your visit."
"This is exactly what I expect from Brendan Sodikoff and company. 5 stars for the atmosphere and service. I patiently sat at the bar swigging exquisitely crafted dirty marts while I waited for my date whose flight into snowy/icey Chicago was delayed. The hostesses were beyond patient and when he finally arrived, we were having such a great experience that we cancelled our plans scheduled for later in the night to instead stay a bit longer (while drinking numerous French 75s). I felt as though our server was honest in menu suggestions and not pushy toward the pricier, expected choices. Of course we did not end the night here...the ambience does not carry into the late, late hours as, say, Maude's...but this will easily become my new favorite for happy hour-ish meet-ups and such. Can I get a better steak frites in the city? Maybe. But I'm quite content here."
"You know how you have a dining experience and then you recount it to your friends and they want to know exactly what you ate and drank and you can't remember it at all? This place is the place that makes you remember every morsel you put in your mouth and you're capable of recounting it for years to come. In all honesty, this was the best dining experience I've had in a while. My boyfriend and I came in at 8 on a Friday and were seated at a table near the bar. The layout is different, but I like it. The tables are well spaced, so you aren't having a conversation with everyone else sitting next to you, but you still feel like it's a cozy atmosphere. They have these warm inviting circular booths--perfect for a group of 4-6. Can't wait to take out clients or have a dinner with a group. The drinks are fun and phenomenally strong albeit expensive. To be fair, they are using some miraculously top shelf, ridiculously good liquor. I don't mind paying $13 for a drink if it's worth the change. We ordered a 30 day aged rib eye and a petite filet--both med rare. He had the rib eye with marrow and sauteed mushrooms on top. Awesome, even if you aren't into the whole weird food thing. Marrow gives it extra flavor like truffle or fat that flavors meat. I had the filet, perfectly cooked. Even at 4 oz, it was enough for me. For sides we had creamed spinach (with blue cheese), mashed potatoes and asparagus. Everything was amaze. For dessert, we had the most extraordinary lemon meringue pie. It was not too sweet, not too tart and the meringue was piled on top to the hill. It doesn't sound sexy, but seriously, it was. Bill was $250 with tip, for two. Yes, it was a splurge. But it was worth every dime."
"Arrogant.  Please do not go here.  They do not need your business.  Their hostess and manager can figure out how to reign people in on their own.   Made us wait for an hour because our friend's flight was delayed.  Still sat us at the table that did not need the seat anyway - was too small.   There are other places in Chicago.  Go to a place that better understands what it takes to please a group of people that will not bat an eye on good food and drinks.  So not only did they displease 6 different people, but now they have spoiled it for their friends and everyone else we will tell not to go there.  Food was good - the chef should find a new place to work!  There are better people out there to manage his/her talent."
"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago right now.  Amazing steaks, seafood and killer drinks.  They make a mean old fashioned and have a good whiskey selection.  BUT, back to the food - it is awesome!  Great deserts too.  Very hard to get a reservation and for good reason."
"Great vibe, great food, great service and staff.Had a totally old school meal, cocktails, oysters, steak.... in a sexy dimly lit room with great jazz playing.Ain't that what a dinner out is all about?  I say yes."
"Not a lot to add to most of the positive reviews, but our service was top notch, oysters great, shrimp dejonge was awesome.  We had the meat loaf, fried chicken, and crispy hash browns, all top notch and plentiful.  No room for dessert.  Real cool room, dark and sexy, great music and feel.  Not Cheap...go for special occasion or date night."
"Bavettes is Wonderful! A great place for a date, to take your parents, or any reason to kick it up a notch. Something for everyone here.Very pretty and comfortable atmosphere. All the food we had was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. Good cocktails (Loins Tail and Bavettes Punch) and nice wine list.I recommend everything we had - Wedge Salad, Fresh Bread, Roasted Chicken (possibly the most flavorful roast chicken I've ever had), Shortrib Stroganoff, Steak Frites, Baked Sweet Potato, Elote Style Corn (SO GOOD). I only wish we had room for the adorable ice cream dishes we saw floating around at other tables.We paid $75/person (including drinks and tip) I will be back hopefully soon!"
"This was my favorite restaurant on my recent trip to Chicago. I loved everything about it. The dimly lit, speakeasy like atmosphere was so cool. A throwback to older eras. The service was some of the best I've received- extremely friendly and attentive without being overbearing. And of course, the food was spectacular. Before we even get into the meat of things, lets talk about the bread basket. Easily, one of if not the best breads I've ever had in a restaurant. They could easily charge $5 a basket and have people dish out for it. Thick chunks of fresh, piping hot (not just warm) bread comes to the table with a tub of butter. Yes, tons of butter. This is how every restaurant should serve their bread. Without getting too detailed, the taste was phenomenal, yeasty, incredibly soft, luscious and almost silky. The butter melted almost instantly upon spreading, and the bread literally melted like cotton candy once it hit my tongue. A great way to get introduced to such a fine establishment.Let me make this clear. I am a steak lover, fanatic, connossieur of sorts you may say. I've been to all of the top steakhouses in New York, which are some of the best anywhere. My standards are extremely high when it comes to beef. After getting a tip from a friend that I hold in very high regard concerning matters of food, I was told this is the best to get the best steak in the city. After eating it, I am hard pressed and happy to say this is one of the best steaks in the country and one of the best I've ever had.The steak to get here is the crown jewel- 24 ounce bone-in prime dry aged ribeye. Every steak lover knows that bone-in is the best. Ribeye is the most marbleized and therefore the fattiest and tastiest cut of beef. So what set this one so high? For one, it is just simply season with high quality salt and pepper and definitely basted in copious amounts of butter. All means for success. Secondly, they know how to cook a bloody rare steak and still get a nice crust on the outside. Something even the best steakhouses cannot achieve. Third, comes the accoutrements that just add to the gluttony and pleasure of eating such an incredible buttery, bloody, funky bone-in ribeye. You have your choice for a few additions- but do yourself a favor and get these two: herb maitre'd butter and bone marrow. Yes, both on top of your already wonderful butter basted ribeye. Butter and steak are natural companions. Taking a page out of Minetta Tavern's book, the bone marrow was a great addition. When you combined everything on one forkful, it was like dynamite exploding in the mouth! It was heaven in a word.Nothing could outdo that steak, but the sides were also done with extreme care. The cream spinach was especially rich and delicious. Studded with copious amounts of blue cheese, I thought that it might be too overpowering but it was actually a stroke of genious as the flavors were terrific together. The elote corn was spicy and the squeeze of lime added a nice citrus acidic bite.Dessert was equally caloric and lavish. Chocolate cream pie. Awesome, thick chocolate piled a mile high on an oreo crust and topped with a soft ball sized sphere of whipped cream. The whipped cream was unlike any I've had. Second best to Peter Luger's schlag, the consistency was almost ice cream like. This dessert was damn near perfect. I'd take this over any foo foo one bite dessert any fine dining restaurant throws at you these days.Absolutely terrific. A meal I will never forget. Bravo Bavette's- on everything. You impressed me, an extremely discerning steak critic. You should be proud."
"This review is only for the bar. We stopped in after a cooking class at the Chopping Block for a drink. I had heard this place was pretty cool. I have to say, the whole 'speakeasy' thing is a little over done, but I loved Bavette's! I thought they really got it right, it really felt like I was in Boardwalk Empire or something! Love the music, bartenders (Andrew was ours and he was great, he explained all the crazy things he was putting in various drinks, which was cool), ambiance. I tried the Champagne Cocktail and the Champagne Crush. The Cocktail was my favorite. My husband had the manhatten on the menu and said it was great. Overall, awesome place. I will be back for sure, for dinner this time!"
"Great atmosphere, great old school cocktails and even better food.  Not the easiest place in town to get in, but worth the wait and fight for reservations.  I've actually had luck walking in late and getting a table or snagging a spot at the bar (reservations seem to be easing a little as well, as I was able to book a table on a Friday night with little notice, something that was unheard of a few months prior).This is the kind of place where the bartenders put on a show, and not a Tom Cruise in cocktail kind of way, rather its like watching an artist who is so devoted to his craft that he is precise and painstakingly exact about every little detail and the finished product is a potent, yet balanced cocktail.  That rival some of the best in the city (still give my nod to Aviary though, but that is comparing apples and oranges with modern/molecular gastronomy vs. classic).  The one downfall I found was the wine list was a little lacking, but do yourself a favor and trust me on this.  Stick to the cocktails and you can't go wrong.The food is awesome.  The shellfish is all fresh and a great selection.  I have yet to conquer the $175 tower, but it is larger than life and might be a necessity during my next ""client dinner"".  The duck/goat cheese terrine is one of my favorites appetizer.   The wedge salad comes with the thickest, juiciest bacon that seems too good to be real (although the dill dressing wasn't up my alley, the bacon more than drowned it out for me).   Even though everything I have had there has been awesome and indulgent (philly cheesesteak, burger, fried chicken, salmon), the darkhorse has to be the flatiron steak that was part of the steak & frites.  The fries were some of the best I've had, but the flatiron (usually a cut I avoid) was right up there with a steak I've paid 3x the price for.  I want to go back and try one of their more expensive cuts to see how they could possibly improve on it or maybe I'll just stop by the bar on a random weeknight and see if they can replicate the best flatiron steak known to man or if it was a one off fluke....(I'm guessing the former over the latter)."
"Ventured into Bavette's last night with a fellow chef/colleague. Atmosphere was great, although I assumed it would feel more like a traditional steakhouse. Seating in the restaurant is very mixed.  The booths are few and far between and the tables are very close together  We sat at a 2-top banquette sandwiched between 4 women on a ""gals night affair"" and two divorced men who wished they had our table. Big picture here, the service is really troubled. There is no real management happening of food and beverage service. Orders getting placed and food getting run with absolutely no orchestration of the dining experience. Servers are nice and happy to clean up the mess they make, but management is seriously lacking.We were served our appetizers literally 3 minutes after ordering. No drinks in sight. Even after bringing it to their attention, it still took another 7-10 minutes. Bar was 1/2 full and bartenders didn't seem like they were doing much, so I just didn't get the delay. Table next to us was having it out with the manager over their ""inexcusable"" service experience so I don't think it was just us having issues. Wines by the glass were organized well albeit a small selection. The 24$ glass of 05' Bordeaux was seriously lacking though. The $15 cab/italian was much better. So why the 4 stars. Well sometimes the food is so good that it completely carries the place. What we ate -Whitefish Caesar Salad - yeah sounded weird, but I'm a sucker for good whitefish. Big portion, good smoke in the fish, shaved croutons were perfect texture and solid dressing. Nuf saidDuck and Goat Cheese pâté - 2 large slabs of pâté - good balance of duck and pork and dotted with goat cheese - Served with a sweet fruit compote (apricot?) and great smoky grilled bread. Classic execution, good seasoning, yummmBone in Ribeye- served with perfect Bernaise (just the right amount of tarragon) - cooked a little on the medium side of mid-rare, but well rested, good char, good rendered fat cap. Not über aged tasting, but a solid steak in a steak town. They had a nice flaked salt served on the side that really brought out the flavor of the meat which was just what the doctor ordered. Braised beef tongue - Simple and delicious. Good crisp caramelization on the tongue, fork tender with an excellent red wine Demi reduction. Horseradish sauce on the side wasn't even needed, but was equally deliciousRoasted broccoli - Slightly salty, but I like it that way  Creamed Spinach with carm onions and blue cheese - The big winner of the night. By far this is the best creamed spinach you'll ever eat. Once they get the service sorted out, this place is going to be a stand out. Can't wait to go back and taste through the rest of the menu."
"I went to Bavette's last night to celebrate my birthday and everything was top notch-the ambiance, the service, the food...We started with cocktails that were made strong and tasty followed by a delicious red wine. We ordered oysters and salads to share. Each salad selection (smoked white fish caesar , roasted tomato and bacon, and apple mixed greens) was unique and delicious. I had the broiled salmon (It was hard not to  get a steak after all the reviews but I felt like seafood and I was promised to share my friend's steak) and it was made to perfection! My  favorite taste of the night though was the spicy corn side - not what I would normally go for but I could not get enough! The ambiance is speakeasy-esque with big leather booths and candle lit lighting. I absolutely loved it at Bavettes!"
"Bavette's Double Cut Lambchop is soooo good. The peppery jus is coated on every bite of it. I'm enjoying the half of the lambchop I didn't finish last night this morning. Incredibly, the fois gras-like meatiness and texture is still perfect. Thanks for the great dinner, Bavette's. I will definitely be back for your steaks."
"Not sure what makes this place a ""European"" steakhouse, but I do know it's delicious. Bread was served warm, service was friendly and helpful, wine list is thoughtfully organized. Atmosphere has a club feel, although it takes your eyes a few minutes to adjust because it's dark. The bar is a great place to grab a drink if you have to wait for a table; although the surface of it is uneven in areas, so be careful where you set your drink! My petit filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare, the spicy corn side dish was soupier than I was expecting and I  am not sure the corn was fresh, but it tasted good. Pommes frites were also delicious, crispy and the right hit of salt. Side of aioli not necessary. Will definitely return here!"
"If I could I would give this place 6.5 stars. I loved it THAT much! We came in with a party of 7 and our reservations were for 6 - they dont have a lot of seating that accomadates 7 ppl. But they made it work for us and we only waited for 20 minutes! Unbelievable service!!! We got seated downstairs in a corner booth. The lighting was very very dim and we had to use a flashlight app on our iphones to read the menu! But it was coool :) we also flashed our waitress and she thought it was funny ha! Anyways, the food is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I dont even like steak let alone ever finish it and guess what - i LOVED it and finished it, doown to the boooone. We ordered bone marrow and crab stuffed avocado for appetizers.  Both were excellent, the bone marrow didnt have enough marrow on it but it was delicious! The marinated onions that came w it were excellent too. For entrees we got bone-in steak, rib-eye and beef stroganof! Boy, the bone-in was unbelievably juicy and so full of flavor. I couldnt believe how much I liked it and kept eating it! I usually do like 5 bites n push it aside. The beef stroganoff , our friend, proclaimed to have the best tasting pasta hes ever had! The rib eye was great as well. For sides we got cream spinach - phenomenal, roasted tomatoes-best tomatoes ever!, corn - sweet and creamy!, and mashed potatoes- delicious! The entire meal was just unbelievable from presentation to the taste - we can not wait to go back! Lille Rose drink w st germaine was the right choice-sweet and citruicy and super fresh. The vibe upstairs is very frank sinatra circa 1920s...the lighting, the furniture, the bar...downstairs is pretty dark but I loved it! Definitely a must if you're somewhat of a steak person."
"Went here for Valentine's Day. What a great experience! The interior is not visible from the street, and a classy, relaxed vibe inside. Lots of wood, great music (recorded off vinyl - for a retro feel), the acoustics are great. Place is lively but not over the top. We were seated quickly, ordered drinks and oysters. Two different kinds of delicious oysters and homemade sourdough bread - yum! My steak was perfect - just exactly medium rare. My husband got the pork chop, and it was melt in your mouth. Butternut squash was a well-prepared, a great side. We had a late reservation (10:15) or we would have ordered dessert. Next time for sure! Can't wait."
"A lush mix of eclectic design and tempting menu items. The atmosphere is the perfect backdrop for a variety of occasions. Night out with the gang. Date. Business meeting. Solo. You name it.  I had the luxury of having sitting at the bar downstairs.  It was the perfect setting to feel tucked away yet apart of the atmosphere.  Lighting is perfect.  Service is spot on.  The decor is ornate but not overwhelming - brilliant mix of masculine oversized tuft leather furniture and dainty glass candelabras.   My recommendation is to bring a cart or small basket to your dinner and take plates and plates of their corn dish home with you [Elote Style Corn chili, lime, parmesan] it is incredible.  We sampled their Filet as well which was cooked to a sensational medium rare and had phenomenal seasonings.  A true testament to the menu were the fantastic sauces that accessorized each dish, particularly the Garlic Shrimp. Old Fashioned is a knockout.  I will definitely return...."
"Loved the ambiance when we came here for dinner and the waiter was fantastic.The seafood salad and the honey apple salad was a great start to our meal.  The fried chicken was moist and juicy, but there was way too much breading on the fried chicken.The martini was fab, but in the one glass of wine I had had loads of sediment and left a pretty nasty taste in my mouth.Overall, it was a very tasty meal."
"Was in Chicago on business.  Had dinner here.  Delightful, dark restaurant.  Superb service.  No upsells.  Delmonico steak, bone-in, was as good as any steak at a top NY restaurant."
"Dear Eric,Everything you recommended last night was marvelous.  The oysters, the crab and avocado salad, the bone-in ribeye, the goldbrick sundae with bourbon ice cream...  When you offered to leave the fries so that I could dip them ""Wendy's style"" in my ice cream you elevated yourself to best waiter of all time.  It was perfection!  Will definitely be back."
"One of the best meals I have ever eaten! Food was un FRIGGIN believable and the service was spectacular as well. Got seated right away. The only complaint of the night was it took a little while for our waiter to get to us for the drink and appetizer order, which he was very apologetic for later on and made up for with a free glass of champagne and free tea. Started with the Baked Goat Cheese, Salmon Tartare, and the Roasted Bone Marrow. All three spectacular. Mind my first bone marrow experience, it was my favorite of the three with a delicious onion marmalade. Each had its own respective carb to accompany which we loved. Then we ordered the Shortrib Stroganoff, Aged Bone In Ribeye with Roquefort, Creamed Spinach, and a Loaded Baked Potato. My favorite dish of the night was the shortrib stroganoff, only sad that there was no room in my stomach for another order. Shortrib was cooked perfectly, so tender, and the noodles were in a cream sauce that paired excquisitely with the juice/sauce from the shortribs. Best shortribs I have ever had! The Ribeye was cooked perfectly medium rare and had amazing flavor and crust. The creamed spinach might have been the most unhealthy creamed spinach ever prepared, but the most delicious with bleu cheese and caramelized onions. The baked potato had this thick-cut bacon that was awesome, and in the end just a good deconstructed baked potato.Dessert was the Chocolate Cream Pie, best dessert I have ever had, the Lemon Merengue Pie, and Vanilla Bourbon Chai Tea. The chocolate pie was absolutely the most decadent and delicious dessert I have ever experienced, with a level of flavors and textures unexplicable. A must try for any visit. The merengue did not quite compare, and the tea was pretty good.Server was very friendly, helpful, and I never had to fill my glass which I loved."
"Believe the hype, my new favorite steak place in Chicago.  Cocktails were great, Cognac Sazeracs went down way too easily, apps were so good, especially the salmon tartar.  I had the classic Chicago cut rib-eye and it was cooked to perfection, I really don't think I've ever had a better steak and I've been to almost every other steakhouse in Chicago.  The sides were great too, we had the creamed spinach and of course the much raved about elote style corn (which lives up to the reviews).  Even though I'm not a dessert person I couldn't resist the whiskey ice cream and it was delicious.  It's tough to get a good reservation for good reason, apply now."
"Yep, another 5 star review.  Even better than expected.  Granted we ate early (545) before it got too crowded, but service (by Daniel) was excellent.  Didn't visit the downstairs lounge, but the main dining room is beautiful.  Looks a lot like Maudes and Gilt inside, but bigger and grander and somehow more American.  Nice long bar, but also lots of room to sit.  Playlist is brighter, crisper, and more classic than what you usually hear at these restaurants, which was refreshing.  Started off with an old fashioned, and my wife with a champagne smash.  All good.  Then went into the duck terrine, which we spread on perfectly charred sourdough and smothered with marmalade.  Very nice indeed.  Then into the famed smoked whitefish caeser - everything you want in a salad and more.  So much more.  Already feeling full, we split the fried chicken with a side of cole slaw and called it a night.  But then we saw the dessert menu and decided to split a slice of decadent chocolate cream pie with oreo crust, before really calling it.  Oy vey.Will get back here before too long to get into some of the steak offerings."
"I really want to like this place, because the ambiance is swanky, and still somewhat unique for Chicago.  However, both times I've been there the service has not been what you would expect for a restaurant that is somewhat pricy.This is not the place to go if you're spontaneous and just want to stop in.  I didn't have a reservation either time I went, and both times the wait was at least an hour for a table.... while being surrounded by empty tables.  The food was amazing on our first visit.  The second time... not quite as tasty.The positives are the drinks, which are really, really good, and our server, who almost made up for the extremely long wait and the lackluster, borderline rude greeting at the door.The hostesses could be a little friendlier, especially given they are the face of the restaurant.  First impressions matter.Overall, would only come back for a quick drink."
"Okay, I'm not sure what the huge hype is with this place. it's very overpriced. The food is pretty good, but not for the money. The place is so dark that I can't walk and have to shine my phone to see the menu. The ""famous"" fried chicken is coated in Bisquick- you can do this at home. There is better chicken at popeyes i promise. The burger I tried was very good, though. But I'd rather spend $9 at Fatty's for burgers and fries. It's just too much of a splurge for mediocre food."
"Very cool atmosphere. FABULOUS whiskey cocktails--especially the ""old fashioned""...BUT...the food, with the exception of a few standouts (the Rib Eye, the Seafood Tower) is very average and expensive. The service is really hit or miss also. Definitely worth trying, but not worth the wait."
"So in Chicago for one day with some friends and decided I had to have a deep dish at Gino's east and a proper Chi town steak dinner, someone recommend Bavetttes so I booked it for 10:45. The atmosphere is incredible, dark and mysterious ( try to get a table in the basement) feels like a 1920's speak easy, and everything was amazing. Did the Dry Aged Ribeye with fries and some peppermint Gelato. It was all incredible, and the the service is top notch. I had Lila take care of us, answered all my questions and really educated me on my options. A bit of an expensive meal yes... Would I do it again???? IN A HEARTBEAT!!!"
My new favorite steak place in Chicago. Great atmostphere and near perfect steak. My only problem is the tough reservation and falls on the pricier side (but well worth it).
"I'm a steak and potatoes kinda gal so when I read that this place has one of the best steaks you can get in Chicago I HAD to try it. I came into town to catch Da Bears (who unfortunately had a terrible game) and had a hankering for some good steak to remedy that sad loss. We tried making reservations on the phone but were told they were booked for the night but that the bar area has a full menu and open seating.  So we made a quick trek over on the ""L"" and was pleasantly surprised that a table was available. We ordered a salad, the 22 oz. dry-aged bone-in ribeye and a side of potatoes. I couldn't be more HAPPY with everything we ordered. The 22 oz. steak is big enough to be shared and is perfection! Perfectly cooked (medium rare). Melts in your mouth and full of flavor. They even give you some extra house blended salt that they use to cook the steak so you can sprinkle more on the steak. The steak didn't really need the extra seasoning since it was perfect as is.  And the service was impeccable! My glass of water was never half empty. I wish this place was in LA...but then again, I'd be here every night and about 500 lbs! The restaurant is also gorgeous! Dimly lit and not too terribly loud nor quiet. Overall, this place is Da-vine!"
"I read some of the other reviews and I can't believe we are talking about the same restaurant. First, my colleague ordered a Dewars on the rocks. Reply: Sorry we don't carry Dewars. He then ordered a Bacardi Lemon. Reply: sorry we don't carry Bacardi products. Another ordered a Coors Light. Reply: Sorry no Coors light. When asked for salt and pepper they brought a pinch of sea salt. It took close to 20 minutes to get our drinks. The food was decent but much better food can be had at any of the Chicago standards. The rough wood tables left me with a splinter. If your a 25 year old wanna be you might impress a date. If you looking for good service, a full bar, and better steaks go somewhere else. If you go, order the cream spinach with caramelized onions so the night won't be a complete loss."
"Came here with a group of friends on a weeknight, and the place was packed. As everyone has said before, the decor is awesome- trendy yet laid back and comfortable. My biggest complaint about the restaurant itself is that the hostesses were a bit pretentious, as if they were doing me a favor by letting me spend my money there. Oh well.The bread and butter are to die for. The bread manages to be thick and warm and chewy and delicious all at once, and the butter is the most spreadable I've ever had at a restaurant. Delicious. I ordered the burger, and it was a great burger- the kitchen originally messed up my order so I ended up getting my food after everyone else had finished eating, but at least it was on the house, and very tasty. Everyone else at the table loved what they ordered. I also asked the bartender to make me a refreshing citrus-y cocktail, and that is exactly what I got- wish I knew what was in it so I could order it again. As for dessert- don't even look at the menu, just order the chocolate cream pie. It is OUT OF THIS WORLD. One of my favorite desserts I've ever had in the city, maybe my absolute favorite."
"I'm not a big steakhouse person, but this is the best steakhouse I've ever eaten at in my life and one of the best meals of my life (also probably the most calories). This is one of those places where you marvel that literally everything is done perfectly. I've had the garlic shrimp appetizer, tomato salad, ribeye, filet, corn...I'm not sure what they put on that ribeye but it's an incredibly flavorful spice."
Arugula and beet salad was good. Short rib stroganof was excellent. Classic cut ribeye was cooked perfect (medium rare) but tough as hell. Seemed more like usda select sirloin rather than choice ribeye. Sent it back and they were nice about. Obviously not the server or cook's fault (unless it was sirloin). Cognac sazerac was a bit too licorice-y for my tastes. I'll stick with the traditional rye.Ambiance - 5Service     - 4Steak        - 0Fyi - veal cheeks are no longer on the menu
"Outstanding experience! Perfect date-night atmosphere. Our dinner was delicious - steak perfectly seasoned and cooked to temp. Corn side dish out of this world! Wonderful cocktails. Best part of the night? Our server Ryan (I think that was his name). Completely on point, charming and gracious even though we looked up and realized we were the absolute last table in the dining room. Well done Bavette's! I can't wait to return"
"This was one of the best food experiences I've had in a while.  Everything about this place is 5 stars - food, service and ambiance.  The upstairs is reminiscent of an early 20th century French bistro, complete with rich, dark wood and mood lighting.   Downstairs is like a parlor or old mansion library, without the books.  Deep booths and romantic 2-tops.  Our server, Michael (or perhaps Michele since he's from a French area of Africa) was very helpful and knowledgeable.  He was also very personable.The food was so good.  I don't think you could go wrong.  We had the fois grois, wedge salad, oysters and two steaks.  My steak was unfortunately medium though I ordered it medium rare plus.  Other than that, everything was  exceptional.  The chocolate cream pie is the best I've ever had.  It's like soft fudge in a delicious crust.  I'd go just for the pie and a glass of wine!"
Honestly. Amazing.Have gone here 3 times and will be going tomorrow night for a birthday. So good. Great Ambiance. Amazing Sevice. Whats more to ask? Go and be sure to get the goat cheese as an appetizer!!
"Ok, how do I eat here...every day? The food is absolutely fantastic. I enjoyed the crab and avocado for an appetizer which was zesty from the lemons and creamy from the avocado, all around yummy in my tummy. For entrees we had the Prime Bone in Rib Eye, medium rare (only way to eat good quality meats) which just melted in my mouth and I still have drooling dreams about it. Service was wonderful and the atmosphere is just what I was looking for! You must go, right now and try it!"
"After a really disappointing birthday meal at Mastro's, I made reservations here for a do-over.  Both of us were thrilled with the experience and can't wait to come back.  We had a very early reservation on a Thursday, but the place was already packed.  I started with the oysters and the husband got the bone marrow.  We then shared a wedge salad (huge) and I got the steak frites as my entree and he went with the fried chicken.  Everything was super fast to the table and the steak was perfectly cooked.  The chicken batter is a tad on the peppery side, but I am a fan.  Wedge was fresh and had a lot of blue cheese chunks as well as two thick cut slabs of bacon (but the dressing has onions).There are plenty of options from the bar - including a tawny port - and we ended the meal with french press coffee and a sundae with a homemade pecan ""magic shell"" topping.Delicious, and well-timed. Thanks for rescuing this year's birthday meal!"
"I adore this place...it's one of my favorites in the city!  The atmosphere is gorgeous--big booths, crystal chandeliers, and a beautiful bar.  And the food lives up to the decor.  My go-to is a Manhattan, the beef bourguignon, and the malted-whiskey ice cream dessert.  Nothing quite like it!"
"This is the best Steakhouse in Chicago and overall one of the best restaurants in the city. Everything from the concept, to the food and service (Eric is exceptional and Erin, the manager, is superb) are beyond excellent and innovative. Brendan is truly pioneering the restaurant scene in Chicago!"
"After asking the "" oh can we help you attitude "" hostesses about a realistic time for a table for 4 ( now let's say it's also 9:30 PM ) we were told..."" oh just about 10 minutes ""  After waiting at the bar for 20 minutes, racking up $100 plus of cocktails, we weren't even checked in by the "" we can't be bothered hostesses "". We had to ask two times - each time getting the rolled eyes.  They were just too busy wiping down menus and organizing god only knows what at the small check in stand.  Needless to say we left after no less than 4 to 6  "" reserved tables "" went unseated in our 30 minute wait time.  Shame...the place has a great vibe, and nice interiors. Even really nice bartenders.  But the "" we are so important "" attitude of managers and hostesses doesn't work for us successful River North professionals. It didn't work at Gilt Bar, and doesn't now work at Bavette's !   We'll visit GT Oyster, Kinzie Chop House, and Coco Pazzo instead !"
I have to join the chorus and agree that this may be the best steakhouse in Chicago.  It has a completely accessible and relaxed atmosphere and is the kind of place you could practically live at.  I haven't tried a bad dish and cannot wait to go back.
"Bavette's is exactly what I want in a steak house. Perfectly cooked steaks, delicious sides, large portions, a cool vibe.  The Chicago ribeye was fantastic.  The elotes and the broccoli sides were a perfect compliment to the decadent steaks. The crab stuffed avocado was a perfect opening to go along with the fresh sourdough bread. The drink list was well balanced and the fact that they had Pappy Van Winkle available made my night. Great service from friendly and helpful servers also made the experience even better."
"I'm torn. Some really bad things and a couple of really good things.My first steak, a Chicago cut rib eye, ordered rare, had so much connective tissue I discarded most of the first half , while only having 2 bites. the meat I had was very good, but the quality was not acceptable. I, for the first time in my life sent a steak back. The waitress told me, ""I shouldn't have ordered it medium"", to which I replied ""it was ordered rare and is clearly rare"". She then replied, ""oh yes I remember I did tell them rare, you need to order it more than rare to help soften the fat."" I replied, ""i have no problem with a little fat on my meat but a third of the steak is connective tissue and a third is fat"". I can't chew through connective tissue. She then told me I should have ordered a filet. Really, a filet? Filet is for people that think they like steak. I then had to wait while she consulted with the chef to return my steak. I was brought a delmonico to replace it and ended up paying an additional 10$. Oh thanks. Awesome deal. Thank god I had the 75 day dry aged steak at David Burkes for lunch or my trip to Chicago would have been wasted food wise. Btw, the delmonico I had was very moist and tasty, but overall I didn't get a good feeling on quality on that either.I literally only eat meat and eat at high end steakhouses in NYC and Boston all the time. The meat here is the same, but costs a lot more.It's not remotely worth $40-60. I'd rather pay more to not have to chew through leather. Again, the few bites I had were great. Also,  waitresses should know enough about their job to know when their customers are calling their BS. If your customer refers to sinew, how the steak was cut, and the temperature fat renders out at, you probably shouldn't try and BS them. I wish I had a picture of the mound of tissue I cut out of the first steak. The couple next to us even gave the waitress a piece of their mind about my steak.As a side note...My girlfriend had the shaved prime steak sandwich with au jus. Wow. Must try if you go. It was the highlight of our dinner tonight. I'm eating it for leftovers in our hotel as we speak. The drinks tonight we're also fairly high end. Very complex, though slightly imbalanced. Best I've had in the city so far. They have a small but we'll thought out beer menu. To see 3 floyds and bells on a list of 10 beers is good.You'll probably have better luck than me. If not, call them on it."
"Thanks you Caitlan (i am sure i spelled it wrong:))WIfe and I visited her this past Saturday, it was amazing!  One of the best dinners we have had in Chicago, the ambience is so perfect, the music is fantastic, and our waitress Caitlan was incredible.  Thanks so much for a wonderful evening we will be back!"
"Was brought here last week as a surprise for my birthday dinner, and couldn't have been happier with the choice my girlfriend made (thank you very much!).  .Vibe: definitely trendy, but in an understated/refined manner, rather than the glitz and glam which is nice, as its not screaming ""I'm trying too hard"".  The place was filled, but still not super loud, and able to hear each other throughout the night without issue..App: Crab Stuffed Avocado Salad.  WOW.  No skimping on the crab meat.  A very refreshing salad, and a great way to get the meal started..Entrees: Prime Bone In Ribeye: 26 oz with Béarnaise and steak salt.  Hands down, one of the best steaks I've had in Chicago in the past year.  Prepared medium rare just as I asked.  Not overly salted.  Wonderful...  My girlfriend got Filet Mignon which was just as tasty..Sides: Elote Style Corn and Cole Slaw.  I'm a slaw fan, and thought it was great, not too soggy or watery, just the right texture with champagne vvinegar, aioli and parsley.  The Elote Style Corn with lime, parmesan, and chili was awesome as well..Dessert: Whiskey ice cream... unique taste, and definitely satisfied my sweet tooth and the chai tea complemented it very well.  One of my new favorites, will definitely be back to tackle either the King Crab or Grand Tower!"
"I'm a fan of the interior styling (downstairs bar in both Gilt and Bavettes are new favorite winter hangouts), the drinks are excellent the food is good. What's not excellent are their incompetent and rude host staff. At both Gilt and Bavette's these people go out of their way to irritate and vex anyone they encounter. They have difficulty managing the table headcount and on multiple occasions I sat next to tables empty for hours after they said they were ""Just slammed all night long"". Make a reservation online and hopefully you will only have to deal with these twits for the briefest of moments."
"My dad really wanted to try this restaurant out and he had clients in from Amsterdam to take to dinner, so there were 5 of us in all, not a large number. He had made a reservation and we walk in, and they had our reservation, and no table set up for five...so around ten minutes later, they seat us in a passage-way area, with my dad at the head of a table for 4, so it was really crowded to begin with, then we had the waitstaff and bussers etc. all squeezing past him every 5 seconds, like the last table you would ever fill in a restaurant, saved for those who did not make a reservation. Especially since it was not crowded and there were other tables available. The wait staff was slow, the drinks were fine and were the only saving grace, and our waiter forgot one of the orders, of course for a client, since that was predictable, and even though the drinks were fine, they still took forever to make. My dad ordered none of the fancy cocktails (gin and tonic) and you would have thought they had to go out to purchase the gin. All in all, we won't be returning. Poor service for the price and nothing that stands out to make me say, well, except for the service, we would return..."
"I ate dinner at this restaurant last week and service at the bar was great, however, I was very disappointed in the food. The french fries and fried chicken were fried in pork grease and made me very ill. The restaurant should make you aware of what they are frying your food in; to avoid this problem in the future for your guests. Also, the steak didn't compare to other area steakhouses that I frequent. I am only giving two stars because of the excellent service, otherwise, I would not even give it one."
"Had a great time and a great meal. Service was friendly, helpful and efficient. The food was OUTSTANDING!! We got an incredible, spacious booth even though it was only two of us. Sadly, we only ordered three dishes and I can't wait to try some more! The Peppered Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine is a must have!! Unfortunately, our crisp Apple and Endive salad was a little over dressed but still soooo good! From what I hear, the we must try the Tomato Bacon Salad next time. The drinks were also incredible and they had a large variety of scotch, bourbon and whiskeys!Make sure to peek your head downstairs, or just head over early to have a drink at the downstairs bar. Will return for sure. New Chicago staple for when friends visit!"
Best steak in Chicago dare I say. I'm a mastro's advocate but Bavette's steak trumps it all. Sexy prohibition feel and great for a romantic date.
I'll keep this short and sweet ladies and gents.  Totally awesome!
"I have been to Bavette's twice now... once with clients and another with my wife and another couple.  In both instances, we were pleased and had a great time.The atmosphere is fun, a little 1950's Ny style vintage inside.  The ambiance has a great feeling to it, with a little dark lighting to add to the mood.  The moment I walked inside the parlor, I definitely wasnted to order an Old Fashioned... which I did both times.  The Cognac Sazerac is awesome and recommended!In the client meal we ordered the Grande Tower, which has oysters, crab and lobster.  This was awesome and worth the money.  We also had the broccoli and sweet potatos.  The sweet potatos were awesome... almost dessert like.  The broccoli tasted a bit strange.  Having had a large lunch prior to this dinner, I wanted to keep it light, so I order the Salmon.  It was tasty and fresh, but probably not the best thing on the menu.For the couples dinner, we had the baked goat cheese and oysters.  The oysters were OK, though being a steakhouse, you don't expect them to have a wonderful selection.  To my suprsise, however, they have four choices, two from each coast.  The goat cheese was excellent.My wife and I shared the Bone in Ribeye and the Roasted Chicken.  The Chicken was awesome and had a wonderful taste and texture to it.  The Ribeye was pretty good, but would probably try one of the filet mignon selections next time.  We ended the night with an ice cream dessert, and it was tasty as well. I have enjoyed myself each visit and will definitly go again!"
"Took a client and associate to Bavette's for dinner last night and it was fantastic.  We started out with the apple and endive salad, the crab stuffed avocado salad and the duck/goat cheese terrine.  All were great and the plates were empty in the end.  The filet I ordered medium rare was done to perfection.  The pork chop was also a big hit at the table.  The sides we ordered were the baked sweet potato (maybe the best ever!) and the corn.  Everything was great, including the service.I'll be back next time I'm in town!"
"Like everyone else has said, the food is delicious. Like, seriously delicious. The bread is heavenly, the goat cheese and marinara appetizer was a hit, and the buttermilk fried chicken (the few bites we could manage after filling up on everything else) was crispy and tasty. Cocktails are delicious, but don't expect large portions. A sip or two plus a large block of ice is what you will get, and you will pay a pretty penny for it. The primary reason I can't give it five stars is for the attitude of the staff. We arrived without a reservation, and when we put our name on the list for a table and asked about the wait, the hostess told us with her nose semi-in-the-air, ""we typically don't quote times."" What?! Seriously? You are a restaurant. Please don't be so trendy that you are too cool for school."
"Grab your fork and go! Just an incredible dining experience. Highly suggest for a date. The atmosphere is romantic and the music is classic. The food is out of this world. We had the bone in filet which was outstanding and gives Chicago Cut a run for it's money. We also enjoyed the white fish caesar salad which is light and has a surprising flavor for a caesar (in a good way). Our sides for the steak were the mashed potatoes which were delicious and the creamed spinach with blue cheese and caramelized onions (a little salty but pretty good). To finalize our outstanding dinner we had the chocolate cream pie. It's like oreos and chocolate mouse had a baby and that baby is ridiculously delicious. To top it off, the service was outstanding, both at the bar and at our table. Bavette's provides a perfect evening with great service, a wonderful atmosphere with a classic chicago feel and a unique and playful menu."
"Ambiance and food presentation get 5 stars. Food was good but not life changing. We ordered the bone marrow, whitefish Caesar salad and filet mignon and braises ribeye. Meat was cooked to order but the flavor was just kind of regular. I was a little disappointed considering the rave reviews on yelp."
New addition to my Favorite Places to Eat list!
"Friday night was the second time I've eaten at Bavettes. The first time was during their soft opening and everything was amazing. From the service and ambiance to the food. It was easily one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. The other night was atrocious. If any of my friends have eaten at Bavettes due to my recommendation I apologize. As early as the checkin for our reservation, things were off to a mediocre start. With a 7:15 reservation we arrived at 7:10 to be told that our table wasn't ready and we should go get drinks at the bar. As soon as our drinks were ordered a hostess approached us to sit down. This was less than five minutes after being told we would have to wait. It took the bartender a few minutes to make our drinks as the hostess anxiously waited for us to be done. When we were then seated it was in a corner with many other two tops. (We were in fact so close that we could hear our neighbors conversations verbatim). Once seated our waiter took about fifteen minties to get to us. Thankfully the runners were filling our waters as we waited. It was obvious that we were not his top priority. He attended to our table once for every four times he checked on our neighbors. It was one of the worst waitstaff experiences I've ever had in Chicago. Our food was incredibly subpar. Whereas last time we had some of the best steaks we've put in our mouths, these seemed to purchased out of the sale case at the local supermarket on sale. My duchess cut filet cooked to medium was charred in the outside and my husbands bone in rib eye was not marbled with fat but had chunks of it throughout. For a place that has Boeuf in the title, you would expect the meat to be very  notable. My glass of wine had so much sentiment in it that the last four sips tasted like someone had mixed beach sand with the Cabernet. The waiter never asked us how our meals were or offered to get us another round of drinks. After this experience dessert was not even on the radar but we did order coffee. Our waiter managed to drop off the check without a word before the coffee was even delivered. I'm pretty sure he would have liked to kick us out if possible. Unfortunately we were not even at our table for 80 minutes. Talk about a quick turnaround. I would recommend outback ahead of bavettes. While the old fashioners were yummy everything else was negative. For a restaurant that one must get a reservation over four weeks out the experience was horrible."
"Wow... I love this place. Simply giving it 4 stars, rather than 5 because I haven't DINED here, yet. I've been here a couple times now, after work hours and met friends for a glass of wine.  I LOVE the dim lighting and ambiance of this place.  I' d imagine a date here would be quite romantic.   A wonderful Riesling by the glass (not overly sweet) they have, as well."
Great whiskey cocktails and love the steak frites
"This place was recommended to me by a coworker and i decided to go on march 11....I made a late reservation for 10:30 at 9oclock, this was kool but i wondered was this a good or bad thing. Now I am definitely critical when it comes to service and quality...and I will tell you that this place is freakin AWESOME....customer service was super great, from the young lady at the door who directed us to our booth to the young gentleman that removed our plates...our waitress Sarah was an angel and the chef must have cooked for kings in past life...lol... Although the upstairs was totally kool with the jazz music and I definitely appreciated where I was offered to be seated, problem was they were out of booths on the main level,only tables...I liked the booths better so the hostess suggested the lower level...i absolutely loved the atmosphere...it was dark but not gloomy quite sexy...it had a 20's &30's gangsta feel mixed with a modern of the same.... music was dope...late 90's early 2000  real hip hop...method man was rockn when I got there...nice right?...the music gradually changed (seemingly on cue)  from french artists to American contemporary...the dry age ribeye was huge, cooked perfectly as I asked medium well-to-well, (something that a lot of chefs don't do right the first time)and  the cole slaw was super fresh and creamy...my dates fillet was just as great!....I passed on the whiskey ice cream only cause we had drank vodka already but next time I will partake....whiskey is my fav:)....but yes I recommend this place to all...I was won over early with the door service and seating, mainly because in the recent past a few other places within the area had not shown my date and I the warmest welcoming. However, this place did no such thing, the entire staff seemed not to even notice our ethnic difference...5 stars all the way around....in the words of Arnold...I'll be back!"
Didn't do it for me. Stuffy place and the food was very so-so. The good thing was that it was open late and we could get in without the reservation.
"I know I'm going to go against the lot of you who worship Bavette's, but I just had a different take on the food than the rest.The restaurant ambience is really nice. We we're seated promptly and service was good. Not really any complaints there. The people I dined with, picked a few spirits and beers that the restaurant didn't carry, but that shouldn't be a real deal breaker for most. I've been there once before, and had a steak, which was good. Better than the rest of the Chicago steakhouses in Chicago? Not really, but good. The night I dined, I was really just looking for something lighter than a big steak. I ordered the Shaved Prime Rib sandwich. It was good, but certainly not worth the hype the server dished out. Kind of an expensive beef sandwich on a nice crusty baguette. We ordered that with the frites & the garlic aioli. For $7, how about some double or triple fried frites? Hand cut? The fries tasted no better than your average fries that you get with the local gyro sandwich. There certainly could have been more thought put into something as simple as frites, especially at Bavettes. I wouldn't go to a restaurant based on frites, but c'mon, you can do better than these.I also shared the baked goat cheese. It just might have been a bad kitchen day for me. The goat cheese ratio to red sauce seemed off. There were too many herbs & the kitchen over baked the dish. It was dry. Things happen I guess.The biggest letdown was the crab cake. Simply stated as baked & ""Royal Lump"" I expected to be wowed for nineteen bucks. I've enjoyed crab cakes all over Chicagoland, East Coast, etc, so this was going to be the finale of my night & I couldn't wait! I'm not sure if there really is a designation for ""royal"" crabmeat or that's just their own description like ""Cheeseburger Royale"" kinda thing. But I figured that if there was such a class of crabmeat, then it must trump Jumbo or Colossal Lump crabmeat. The cake was the size of a hockey puck, so it seemed properly portioned, like other good restaurants, but it all ended there. If the kitchen is using an expensive crabmeat for the cake as the price would dictate, someone back there must have taken all of the delicate lumps & beat the hell out of it all til it looked like the cheap claw meat you buy at Jewel. But for $19.00, this cake should have been flawless! Sorry kitchen, go have one at Joe's or any of the great seafood or steak houses in town and see that crab is the star of a really good crab cake. Look, when you're charging a premium for a product, be it steak, crab cake, frites or a burger, you have to be ready to take criticism. If you're charging $10 bucks for something, you can probably fly under the radar for some. Charge $20 bucks for something just ok, and you've got some explaining to do Lucy. The place looks great & feels great, from the front door back. Maybe I just had a bad food day, but I'm not going to drink the kool-aid like everyone else just because it's the trendy spot in town. Make me feel good about the food also!"
"Update:  One of our absolute favorite places anywhere. Great environment, service and food, the total package. Visited again last night and had our favorite waiter Brandon. Appetizers were tomato with bacon (if this isn't the best bacon anywhere tell me) and a smoked trout Caesar salad. We share the Chicago cut steak and the lamb T bone, both perfectly cooked and delicious. Side dishes were the corn (also the best anywhere) and spinach. Although we were all full, the chocolate cream pie disappeared in moments. Hands down one of the best restaurants in Chicago. The food is great and its a really sophisticated, swanky place. If you can manage to snag a reservation, go. Although they are promoted as a European style steak house, and the steaks are great, the roasted and fried chicken (recently named by Chicago magazine as the best fried chicken in Chicago) are great too. The corn side dish and the stuffed potato are delish as well.One minor, but really classy touch was while we were seated in a waiting area for one more guest a waiter came over and poured two glasses of water for us, just like we would have been expected to be treated if we were at our table. The only other place that I have been treated like that is a the 4 star Grace."
"Went here last night and had a wonderful meal.  I thought I made a reservation via Open Table, but it somehow did not get confirmed.  However, I still was able to be seated (I did get there when the opened).  I was dinning alone, but they sat me at a four top toward the front of the restaurant which kind of sucked but they were so nice that I quickly over came this feeling.  My waiter Brandon was so kind and accommodating, he provided some of the best service I have had this year.  He have quite a few tables but still managed to make me feel like I was his only table. I ordered the following:Whitefish Caesar salad - I thought this was really very good.  I loved the potato chip crunch in the salad. I tasted like an upscale tuna fish salad which I love.  I would definitely get this again.Spaghetti and meatball - This was o.k., the sauce was a little too sweet for me, but the meatball itself was very tasty.  Chocolate Cream pie - O.M.G. this was amazing!!!  The pie was so rich, silky and smooth.  I was not going to order dessert, but the hostess (who was also so very sweet)  suggested I order this. She was right on point with this one.  If you like chocolate you must order this.The palace is really very dark, and everyone who came in had to take a few seconds to get adjusted to the lighting.  I like a little more light when I am eating, but that is just a preference thing."
"What an incredible experience! We elected to sit at the bar, which was a great choice. There were plenty of seats late Saturday night. The bartenders were ridiculously accommodating and took a good amount of time to prepare our drinks just right. I had an amazing dirty gin martini to start (it seems simple but it really is an art). With my meal, the bartender actually made me two half drinks to pair with what I ordered. Um, awesome?! The food was also incredible. Everything came out promptly and the portions were fairly large. I can't wait to go back, get another cocktail (or 5) and try some different dishes."
"Great atmosphere, drinks, and food...enough said."
"The best dining experience.  The best service.  The best atmosphere.  Oh, and the best food that I have enjoyed while visiting Chicago!I had the goat cheese appetiser and the bone-in filet and cream spinach.  I would highly recommend everything.The only negative was the au poivre sauce for the steak was good, not great."
Great hip place very busy. I was in downstairs bar at the bar. Great drinks Chicago cut ribeye somewhat disappointing too much fat but tasty! The bacon appetizer was not good at all.  The shrimp appetizer well worth it and outstanding. I would go back can't always be perfect for everyone.  Went before hawks game on a Friday night.
"I'm not quite sure what all the rave reviews are about.  I was very excited to try this place but the food alone is not worth a return trip.  The ambiance is very cool...more intimate and mellow downstairs and upbeat and party-like upstairs.  The food is another story.  We started with some oysters and duck terrine that were average and a wedge salad that was very large with delicious bacon.  Then I had the ribeye which was the fattiest piece of meat that I've ever been served, especially at a restaurant of this quality.  I was shocked that this pice of meat was even served no matter what the price.  If the waitress ever came back to our table I would've returned it.  However, I didn't see her until the end of the meal and told her then.  She didn't seem to care about the food as she was just trying to get us to order another drink.  Overall, if you're looking for top quality food in Chicago, you don't have to look very hard.  At these prices, I can get a steak at Joe's, Gibson's, Mastro's, etc. that is much, much better.  Not even a comparison.  If you want a drink and cool scene, check it out.  But for food, save your money for all the other amazing steakhouses in the city!"
"Bavettes is not only delicious, but has such lovely decor! My boyfriend and I love steak and French food, so we figured this would be a perfect fit and it was! It's pretty dark inside, but music is a little loud (not too loud) making it intimate but still upbeat. Feels like you're in an upscale Parisian bistro.Food was amazing. We started with the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine which was very tasty. My boyfriend had the steak frites, he enjoyed the steak but fries were average. He had it medium and it was the perfect color!I had the shortrib stroganoff which was pretty good. I loved the noodles and the cream, but I'm not a huge fan of shortrib (in comparison to steak) but I still found it really delicious! Would be awesome if it were chunks of steak!We also shared an order of thick cut bacon - wow!! It is THICK! So tender! If you're a bacon fan, it's a must!Finally, for dessert we had the chocolate creme pie, with oreo crust.. mmmmm..... let me warn you, it's very rich. So if you're a big chocolate fan, it should be perfect. It came with a huge dollop of whipped cream on top, which helped lighten the chocolate in each bite, perfect for someone like me who can only do so much chocolate before getting sugared-out. 5/5 on everything, great friendly service, and cocktail list looked amazing! There will definitely be a next time!PS, we got a kick out of the grandma china ;)"
"Fantastic restaurant! I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we both lovedddd it and will definitely be back!  It's a classy, sexy, fun, restaurant with amazing cocktails!As expected it is higher end, but it was nice to see a pretty decent price range on the menu--not everything here is $$$$, but it all tastes like it!"
"Went here during the soft open, and will definitely be back!If you love Gilt Bar, you'll love Bavette's.  Sexy atmosphere (we sat downstairs), great food, and delish drinks.  Duck & Goat Cheese Terrine - awesome. If you've gotten anything on toast at Gilt Bar, this will look familiar to you. Had a filet that was cooked to perfection, and the herb roasted tomatoes on the side were delightful. Finally, the elotes - love their spin on the classic streetfood.  Doesn't beat the original, but I welcome this as an alternative side dish.Can't wait to come back and try the lamb chops!"
"The cocktails were great, I recommend the Lion's Tail.  Our server was very good and very knowledgeable.  The bone in ribeye was outrageously awesome and don't skimp on the sides!"
"My favorite addition to the Brendan Sodikoff empire. That's saying a lot because I love them all. Dry aged, prime yeah yeah yeah...I skipped these options and went to the heavy hitters. My date and I shared the tongue and cheek. Awesome of course. Somehow throughout my gf's life she had manage to never have a run in with a lamb chop so we rectified that. Great lamb chop, one of the best I've had. By server suggestion we tried the elote appetizer and that dish was the true porn star of the evening. For dessert we had the biggest most delicious wedge, slab really, of cheesecake I've ever seen in my life!   We started with the Bavette's punch ,and then shared a couple bottles of vino. That seems appropriate here. Try a cocktail while you review the menu, and then switch to enjoy some wonderful wine food."
"Definitely in my top 5 for Chicago restaurants. Bavette's is a very special place. I highly recommend the smoked whitefish caesar salad - it's wonderful, the crunch of the smoked crispy whitefish is unreal. The sourdough bread is to die for. I would have to say that the fried chicken was the fan favorite. I truly believe that you cannot go wrong here. Make sure to make your reservation well ahead of time, as it could be a month before you can get in. Also, the largest party size they take is a party of 6. All in all, Bavette's is stellar."
Excellent place. The decor was exceptional and the food was fantastic. The steak bone in ribeye steak was made to perfection and the shrimp de jonghe was very tasty. The atmosphere was very romantic and soothing. The jazz music was the perfect choice. I would definitely come back.
"Another great find in River North! The food and ambiance are great, the only thing I would suggest is to open the lower level for dining when the upstairs area gets crowded."
"Ahhhh, heaven. Our server was AWESOME and suggested a drink off the menu for me- a Mezcal Old Fashioned. Just do it!! We sat for over three hours drinking and stuffing our faces.We shared oysters, tartare, fried chicken, beef tongue, pastrami veal, elote corn, sugar snap peas with ricotta and lemon and creamed spinach. Albeit almost everything was heavy and rich *you are at a steakhouse!* we left stuffed and happy. LOVE this place."
"Great steak and great drinks. I really think you can go to most of the famous chicago steak houses and get a great steak (Gibson's, smith and wolinski's, david burke, etc). But if you want to get a great steak and eat it in a restaurant that looks like it came out of the most recent episode of mad men, then this is your place. This place is really cool!"
"An amazing place to take someone special.  Everything on the menu is wonderful, from the oysters to the avocado crab salad, and to finish the chocolate pie with a French press.  Way to go  Bavette's!!"
Wonderful cocktails and non-steak beef dishes in an incredibly romantic and charming atmosphere.
"I'm in absolute love with this place! So dark (hint: romantic), such great service, excellent food. Ill definitely be a repeat customer."
"We came here for my birthday & everything was fantastic. We were seated downstairs, which was nice because it was kind of removed & quiet.  I really wanted a loaded baked potato, but saw one at the table next to us & decided against it because it was ridiculously large. Whiskey ice cream was also good."
"After months of eagerly awaiting a trip to Bavette's I was finally able to secure a reservation for a Saturday night with my boyfriend. We were seated in the main part of the dining room which was surprisingly bustling at 6:15pm. Our waiter came over to greet us and gave us a drink and dinner menu to look over as he attended to his other tables. We probably waited a solid 15 minutes or so until he came back to check on us and take our drink order, but we weren't in any rush so this didn't bother us. It seemed as though they only had a small handful of waiters attending to the entire dining room, some of which looked flustered at keeping up with their tables. Our waiter came back with our drinks and went over the menu with us, highlighting their seafood towers and steak offerings, as well as touching on some of the other unique offerings. I liked how he didn't press us to put in an order immediately, and gave us as much time as we needed to enjoy our cocktails and peruse the menu. After much contemplation of the menu, we decided on the following: 1) Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine: This was a fantastic appetizer to start the meal off with. There were two generous slices of Terrine served with three thick cut pieces of freshly baked bread. The duck paired nicely with the goat cheese and reached perfection with the apricot mustard spread that was served alongside the terrine. The contrast of flavors along with the crunch of the bread made this a truly memorable appetizer. For those who are ""iffy"" about duck, this wasn't gamey in the slightest and I'd highly recommend giving it a try.2) Southern Fried Chicken: This dish came out incredibly hot temperature-wise, which really tested our patience as our first scorching bites were delicious. The chicken was perfectly breaded and crunchy on the outside and the chicken was very moist and flavorful on the inside. The homemade buttermilk ranch and bottle of hotsauce really kicked up the flavors in the chicken, making it some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The only ""odd"" thing about this dish was that it seemed so out of place with the other offerings on the menu and the classy atmosphere of the restaurant. That aside, I'd gladly dig into a plate of piping hot fried chicken at Bavette's anytime. 3) Steak and Frites with a side of Garlic Aoili: We ordered the steak cooked to a medium temperature and it came out perfect. We used some of the steak salt that was provided as a side to the dish, which I enjoyed since many restaurants oversalt their steaks. Nothing about the steak really stood out to me flavor wise, it was good but nothing to write home about in comparison to other steakhouses in the neighborhood. The frites, on the other hand, were outstanding and quickly disappeared along with the garlic aoili. 4) Bacon: It pretty much goes without saying that I have to get the bacon at any of Brendan Sodikoff's restaurants. The bacon is some of the best that I've had, being thick cut, house cured, maple goodness that melts in your mouth. I found that bites of the bacon went very well with the steak, but then again what doesn't bacon go well with? Just go ahead and do yourself a favor and get this.5) Elote-style Corn: This dish reminded me of a Philipino style corn and also seemed a bit out of place given the overall vibe of the menu. The corn was roasted and was in a thick, orange sauce (mayo or yogurt) and served with a fresh lime to squeeze on top. It was incredibly flavorful and I enjoyed it as a side to the chicken. The dish was good, but not one of my favorites, so I would probably pass on this the next time around.Drinks1) Cognac Sazerac: My boyfriend got this and enjoyed it--it came out a bit syrupy but once the ice melted it mellowed out the texture of the drink allowing the cognac flavors to come through.2) Lion's Fire: This was a shaken combination of Evan Williams Bourbon, angistora bitters and allspice that came out very... pink and sweet. This surprised me as I wasn't expecting a shaken and sweet drink based on the description on the menu. It was a good drink, just not my favorite.3) Old Fashioned with Weller: This was my second drink and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There was a large twist of orange peel and two boozy cherries in the drink that were fantastic. The flavors were spot on and I'd definitely get this one.4) Mint Julep: This was my boyfriend's second drink and it was exactly what you'd expect--well executed and delicious.Service: As I mentioned before, the waiters seemed a bit strained at times, but I didn't mind this as it created a relaxed and un-rushed dinner which can be hard to come by. He checked in on us when our food arrived (which came out promptly upon ordering) and the support staff was spot on. The hostesses were also very friendly--I can't find any complaints across the board.Atmosphere: Five stars--can't go wrong with the dark, cozy, saloon vibe. Loved every aspect of this!"
"After dining at Gilt Bar and Maude's Liquor bar, I paid my first visit to Bavette's last night. My boyfriend and I had a 10:15 reservation for drinks. I started out with a Mint Julep. We had the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine. I'm typically weary of duck dishes but this was wonderful. We finished the evening with the ice cream sundae and two Jameson shots with a spiced pickleback- amazing! I was just as impressed with Bavette's as I have been with the other Hogsalt restaurants. The atmosphere is quieter and upscale with grandiose chandeliers and cozy booth seating. It's safe to say I'll be back."
"Tip to male staff---don't call women ""girls"".....please!! (Do they call male patrons ""boys""?) Happened twice, first with the host, and I could have sworn the male server we had heard me complaining to my friend about the host's use of ""girls""; the female server we had upstairs would never think of calling my friend & me ""girls"". She was great.Tip to restaurant---turn up the lights a bit. Had to use a candle to see the menu. Really??!! I'm all for atmosphere, but like to see what I'm ordering, and see what I get."
Ridiculously good. That's the only way to sum it up. Get the wedge salad. The bacon that comes on top tastes more like steak than bacon. I had a couple bites of my wife's fillet and it was perfect. It melted in my mouth. The pomme frites were very good as well. My strip steak and asparagus were satisfactory. The cocktails were amazing. I had a couple whiskey sour's and they did it right. My wife had a Dark and Stormy (which is made with ginger beer) and was also great. The only downfall is that it was pretty pricy. This would be a great place if you're looking to go out on the town.
"Bavette's is AH-MAZING and one of my new favorite restaurants. It's got the perfect warm atmosphere for either a romantic dinner or a fun night out with friends. The service is impeccable (hello, byob with sharing) and the food is excellent. Our faves were the caesar salad, shortrib stroganoff, steak, elote corn and the bacon. All of it was so well prepared and decadent. The only thing we weren't fans of was the spinach. It has a bit too much tang with both the blue cheese and onions. But with everything else being so delicious, it wasn't a big deal. Dessert was also phenomenal."
"Been here a few more times. The drink lounge downstairs is cozy and rich. The food continues to be excellent. Try their salads, they are really spectacular."
"Amazing service, atmosphere and food!  We had the dry aged bone in ribeye (best steak we've ever had), corn (crazy good), bacon (unbelievably delicious and I'm not a big bacon fan), crab stuffed avocado salad and frittes (homemade fries).  We left raving about everything and super stuffed!  Will definitely go back and take our friends."
"After giving Bavette's another chance, I have no other option but to give them a raving review. The host/hostess problem that I had encountered on my 3 previous attempts to enjoy Bavette's has been fixed with the most wonderful young man with large granny glasses and a huge smile! He was a breathe of fresh air after preparing myself for the worst. The server was fantastic and the food was mind blowing! Our table ordered oysters, shrimp cocktail, meatloaf, dry aged ribeye, salmon, cheesecake, and lemon pie. Simply amazing!"
"Put it straight.....this is a beautiful restaurant with an equally impressive menu, which made for a fabulous birthday dinner for my wife and I.  Everything you read here is correct, so therefore, go.  And enjoy!And, by the way, Michael (our waiter) did a great job last night.  Many thanks"
"This place was on point! The service, the atmosphere, the food are all exceptional.The bread is warm, home made and accompanied by creamy butter. We shared the goat cheese appetizer which reminded me of dipping my bread in my mom's pasta sauce as a kid.  I am not a steak eater, so I cannot comment on the meat, however my date said it was one of the best steaks he's had. The salmon was cooked to perfection. For sides we ordered the corn and creamed spinach.  The spinach was awesome. The corn was good, but nothing I got excited about.Would absolutely recommend this place."
This place is setting the bar high. See Zach downstairs bar. Bang. Then head up for an exceptional dining experience. Awesome lamb chops... Get here and try this joint.  Get ready to experience the great clash of the old vs new.Perfect blend an great staff. Highly recommend.
"Yummmmm....we had filets with french fries and the bacon. Yes.  I had bacon as a side.  I like the way the steak was cooked.  Very flavorful.  The french fries came with a dip that was AMAZING.  Yum.,"
"Wonderful!  One of my new favorite places.  The ambiance is nice and relaxed. Woods and low lighting.  Service was impeccable. We never wanted for anything.  Could be romantic.  I was with co-workers though....  The bread that comes early is amazing.  My cocktail, Lillet Rose Martini was delicious. Three of us easily shared the smoked fish ceasar salad and crab cake.  Also delicious.  We had the filet mignon, short rib stroganoff and roast chicken.  We shared the broccoli, elote and fries sides.  Not one bad bite on the table.  As for dessert, I have 4 words; malt whiskey ice cream!  OMG  With the fudge sauce?!!  wow.  I would go back for that.  the lemon meringue pie was old school and again, delicioius!  We had 6:00 reservations.  THe place, including the bar, was packed.  Can't wait to go back."
"This might be the best restaurant in the city of Chicago.  The martinis and appetizers are out of this world.  The tab runs high, but you get what you pay for at this spot.  I went here for a work outing and couldn't have been happier with the choice.  The beef stroganoff and cherry foie gras were the best i've had."
Beautiful rustic and romantic ambiance. Service was excellent and the food was delicious. I started with the smoked whitefish Caesar salad which was awesome. The lamb chops were good although not the best I've had. We ordered a side of the sweet potato with butter and brown sugar. Well at least the sweet potato is good for you. It was heavenly.
"Honestly, this place is in my list of top dining experiences.  The food was fatastic, the service was great and the place has a great vibe.  Everything thing from the drinks to desert was as close to perfection.Did I tell my friends, will I take clients, will I be back again with my family?  Hell yes!OystersDry Aged Ribeyethe BACON - must have!!!!Wedge Saladthe Fried Chicken - yummyChocalate pie - oh yeah!Lemon pie - awesomeRun don't walk, but don't try running after dinner, you won't want to move . . ."
I get it. Swanky scene. Great ambience. Food was good. Just don't get the price tag.
"4 stars for the food, 6 stars for the experience.What I appreciate most is that it's immediately clear this is a place for grown-ups; everything felt deliberate and thought-out. Sure, they're trying hard with the whole ""Edgar Allen Poe meets Alfred Hitchcock via the Matrix"" decor, but I have to admit it pays off. And any place that has the brass to spin 50's bebop upstairs and Portishead downstairs knows what it's trying to accomplish. After acquainting ourselves with the bar with a couple of cognac sazeracs and Manhattans (both drinks were spot on), we were seated at an elevated booth that was great for people watching and helped us generally feel pretty good about ourselves (the vibe and alcohol were working their magic). Our server was pretty talkative and, luckily, we were feeling chatty.Apps: - Garlic Shrimp de Jonghe: plump and sliding around in garlicky goodness. - Smoked white fish Casear salad: the whitefish works well with the anchovies in the dressing. It's not pretty to look at, but we couldn't stop eating this one; it was tremendous.Mains: - Roasted Chicken: people in the blogosphere rave about this dish. You'd think this was a rare species from the Amazon and not just a very well-executed roast chicken. - Classic Ribeye Chicago Cut w/bone marrow: I'd read less than superlative things about the steak here, but this was a really darn solid effort, cooked perfectly medium-rare. The steak salt that comes with it must be laced with crack cocaine, and before we left, the busboy slipped me some to go on the sly, bless his heart. But when the best thing about a steak is the seasoning, something's not exactly doing its job.- Berkshire Pork Chop: The surprise of the night. Pungent rosemary complemented the lemony acidity of the jus in a way that smelled like home holiday cooking on a cold winter's night. It was a good decision to share everything family-style because I could imagine getting flavor fatigue with any one of the mains. One of the only missteps of the evening was when the waiter, emboldened by our constant chattiness, brought one of our party a drink because it was ""his favorite."" She didn't enjoy it and told him so, but it stayed on the bill. He did, however, comp us a dessert after we had ordered it. Potato-potata?At the end of the night we were having such a great time, it's clear the overall experience of the place went a long way in coloring the food with rose-tinted glasses. The booth, the music, the vibe, Hitchcock, the STEAK SALT, we were powerless to resist!  So I guess if you leave a place feeling that good, even almost-great food is enough to make the entire thing feel like you hit the jackpot."
Only visited the bar but had a great experience. Bartender was very friendly and mixed up some solid cocktails. Had a tasty appetizer as well. Little pricey otherwise 5 stars!
"Great dining experience! We started with oysters that were very fresh & tasty. Then we split the smoked fish caesar salad. It is definitely big enough for 2 people to split before the main meal. The salad was fantastic, flavorful - the best caesar we've ever had - highly recommend. For dinner - steak frites with a side of bone marrow, roasted chicken and a side of the creamy mashed potatoes. The steak & chicken were both tender, juicy and again, full of flavor.  The chicken & potatoes both had a lot of garlic!! They serve a huge portion of chicken so you can easily share some. The frites had a great seasoning on them. For dessert we shred the whiskey ice cream w a side of hot fudge. It was a really good sized portion. Very creamy. Finished with French press coffee which is fantastic! Our server was helpful and attentive but not hovering so that we felt rushed to eat & leave quickly. It was a nice relaxing meal. Dishes were cleared quickly. The decor, lighting etc. give the room a perfect ambiance for a great meal!! We will definitely go again."
"Ambiance is great, flat iron steak OK, but the service... is AWFUL. It took forever for our beverages to arrive, not to mention how long we had to wait fot the apps and entrees. But the most unbelievable thing is that I had my HAIR BURNED DOWN by the small candles they have right behind the seats downstairs (what a DUMB place to put candles, come on)!  I asked for the manager, Ms. Annie A., who just said she believed in me (really? anyone could smell what just had happened). The bathroom downstairs is really dark so I couldn't see how bad it was and I'm really upset for paying a $100 bill for having OK food, slow service and a ruined hair."
"I am so glad I tried this new hot spot.  The Lillet Rose Martini was the perfect way to begin this delicious meal.  The bread was warm and crusty, which makes me so happy.  No one looked at me funny when I asked for more bread so thats a plus.  We had a crab salad, meatballs and spaghetti, and beef stroganoff.  The beef stroganoff was divine!!  The meatballs tasted a bit odd, definitely not the ones your mom makes.   It was extremely loud.  I would come here with a fun group to celebrate and then go out on in the neighborhood.  I definitely got the impression that the people who work there think they're the cats meow, but overall they were fine."
This place is all ambience mixed with phenomenal food. It's like stepping into a time machine back to the roaring 20s! You don't mind the wait thanks to the bar and cocktails that result. You can't go wrong on the menu: seafood is the house specialty but the beef will make you question that distinction.
"What a great place.  You must visit the downstairs bar prior to dinner.  Favorites included the fresh east coast oysters and the most perfectly seasoned burger.  We also ordered the bacon which was cooked to perfection, but too fatty for my liking.   Wine list was a little disappointing."
Perfect for late night dinner. Book in advance ...
"Was in town for a few days during the week, and managed to get a reservation here for a Wednesday night.  Service: our server, Ryan, was excellent.  He took us through the menu, gave us great recommendations, and was super friendly. He even gave us recommendations for other places in the city to go the following two days (all of which were spot-on). He didn't rush us at all, and gave us candid appraisals of all of the food we were considering. To us, the hallmark of a good server is one who can add value to the evening.  I can say with 100% certainty our night would not have been as enjoyable had we not had Ryan helping us along.Food: WOW. Shrimp cocktail, Elote Corn, Mashed Potatoes, 22oz Prime Bone-In Ribeye, wine, coffee, malted whiskey ice cream.  Everything was phenomenal.  Ryan told us steaks were big enough to share, and that the kitchen recommended that they cut the steak accordingly.  The steak came perfectly done, and cut just right to make it shareable. The Elote corn was to die for; it's an absolute must-order.  The roasted garlic on the mashed potatoes was awesome: roasted until it was almost as soft as melting butter. Price: certainly not a cheap night, but not outrageous.  All things considered, the night was not much more expensive than it would have been at a similarly regarded restaurant in our hometown of Columbus, OH. Worth every penny.Overall: great ambiance to the restaurant, food was wonderful, and service was solid. We will ABSOLUTELY be back next time we are in town."
Very romantic!  Excellent service and exquisite food and drinks!  I cannot wait to go back!
"I give Bavette's an A+ on decor and atmosphere alone, but had to give it a ""Meh, I've experienced better"" which is only 2 stars. I'd probably give it a 3 but meh kind of is my feeling about it.I adore Au Cheval and I love Maude's, but Bavette's was kind of meh based on service alone. Our waitress at our table downstairs (short blond haired girl wearing a bandana headband) was not very attentive much of the night. She seemed to only walk around aimlessly and each time I tried to make eye contract with her because our empty drinks needed refilling or our first course was done and we wanted to order more things, she seemed to glaze over and walk by the table for a few times until she finally asked us if we wanted anything else 10-15 minutes later. This happened multiple times throughout the night. She just seemed to be walking around in circles and doing the same thing to most other tables too. The other waitstaff, on the other hand, were super great and very tentative to clear the tables and bring other silverware, etc.The food was just okay. It was GOOD, but again, comparing it to Maude's or Au Cheval I just didn't think it was as good. I only give it 2 stars, because in comparison to Maude's and AuCheval, it just seems to pale in comparison. I wanted to like it more, but our waitress kind of soured me on this place."
"Unfortunately, I haven't eaten here yet.  It is a great place to chat and mingle over a few well-crafted cocktails.  The ambiance is straight up sexy and the bartenders are both pleasant and well trained.  I will certainly return for dinner.  Don't miss this place."
"Came here last night and had an absolutely FABULOUS dining experience. As so many others have said, I've tried many Chicago hot-spots, and Bavette's definitely wowed me and left a lasting impression.First, Ambiance: absolutely perfect. I've been to a lot of the Chicago 1920's speak-easy places, but none have done it as well as Bavette's. The bar in the back of the dining room is particularly cool. I also love the mirrors with the painted menu items written on them. I couldn't help but continue to oogle at the restaurant throughout the meal. The booths are also exceptionally comfortable.Drinks: I started with the Old Fashioned Cognac. Definitely a strange choice for a girl like myself, but the waitress recommended it. I have NEVER been so pleased with a drink choice in my life. I also never order two of the same drinks at a restaurant, as I like to try something new. However, this drink was an exception to my rule! I got two, and the orange flavor mixed with the house-made maraschino cherries was to-die-for. I imagined this drink would be very strong and bitter, but it had a pleasant sweetness to it (while still being very nice and strong) and a little bit of a cinnamon spice flavor. Food: Starter: We started with the lump crab cake-- great choice. This crab cake was cooked to perfection and already flavored with some lemon. The crab cake had a very decent amount of actual crab chunks in it, which is essential for a good crab cake (I hate when they beef up the crab cafe with other nonsense to make it seem bigger). Portion size was very generous, and it came with a really flavorful dipping sauce.Mains: I ordered the steak frites and my date had the salmon. Both were delectable. I ordered the steak medium-rare, as recommended by the waitress, and was not disappointed. Great cut of steak with minimal seasoning (how I prefer it). The fries were also awesome-- crunchy and seasoned (but not overly). Came with some creamy dipping sauce. The salmon had a great crust to it, just crispy enough and cooked perfectly (the kind where it melts in your mouth).Dessert: Despite being stuffed, we couldn't help but try the Whiskey Ice Cream. Let's just say the portion size was more than generous. Extremely rich and delicious flavor that tasted like a mix between chocolate, carmel and Ovaltine (yes, the malted milk drink from your childhood). And I mean that in the best way possible. Absolutely necessary to try. Overall, one of my favorite meals in a long time. I can't wait to come back. This place definitely left a lasting impression and is great for dates or even a special occasion."
We returned for the 2nd time within a week....all becacause of Nathan.  : )Not only because the food is great but the service is impeccable!! The best bartender ever! He totally went above and beyond.
"Swoon. Everything was tasty, everyone was nice, the interior is classic and romantic. No missteps.  I'm still full."
"AMAZING.The customer service was impeccable and the food was absolutely delicious. We arrived early for our reservation so we went downstairs to the lounge  to start off our dinner with some cocktails. The vibe is so chill and you are still able to have a conversation over the music. When our table was ready someone came down and got us and waited patiently while we closed out our tabs and then carried my drink for me while we were led upstairs. We were seated at our table and given the chance to order more drinks while bread and butter was brought out. THE BREAD. it's so good. I ended up ordering the roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and chocolate cream pie. Normally I'm hugely disappointed by upscale restaurants. The food never lives up to the cost. My bill totaled around $65 including my two cocktails and I would gladly pay it over and over. The chicken was moist and full of flavor and the mashed potatoes were delicious with whole cloves of garlic. The chocolate cream pie was rich without being painfully so. It ended up in my freezer and was just as enjoyable on the second day. This is definitely going to be my new go-to place when I want to go to the effort of doing my hair and putting on makeup and wear something other than jeans."
"If I was to somehow end up on Death row and I had my choice of a final meal, this mean would indisputably come from Bavette's Bar and Boeuf. Just the bread and the butter alone tasted better than most of the meals I've had in Chicago. From the ambiance, to the friendly and knowledgeable staff, to the perfectly mixed Old Fashioned this place left a huge smile on my face. I've tried the burger with King mushrooms, perfect, a side of cured bacon, perfect, loaded baked potato, perfect. I tried a cut of their dry aged steak, perfection. I can't say enough good things about this place. If Bavette's Bar and Boeuf was a woman, I would propose on the spot."
"New favorite bar/restaurant. You have filled a hole in my life that I did not know existed.  I don't know what I love more - the atmosphere, the food, or the friendly staff.  I have already been twice and I want to go back many more times.The upstairs has a french bistro meets speakeasy atmosphere.  There are curved booths along the walls and free standing tables in the middle.  It is a warm and not overcrowded space.  There is also a long bar that was packed with people.The downstairs is a lounge.  It still has the curve booths on the side (the can comfortably fit 4-5 people).  The middle of the room has upholstered chairs and couches.  The first time I went to Bavettes that is where we hung out. Last night we ate there and it was extremely delicious.  The menu definitely focuses on beef and seafood, and they do a really great job with it.  I love when a restaurant doesn't try to be 15 different things (Hub 51 is an example of a restaurant failing at this) and they are focused instead.  The portions are generous, especially the salads.  Our server did help us out and made sure we didn't order too much food.  I shared the endive salad with a couple friends, it was definitely enough for 3 people.  Then I had the Shortrib Stroganoff.  Order it.  It was perfect.  The short rib was cooked to perfection, it just melted in my mouth.  The pasta is fresh.  The mushrooms were full of flavor.  The sherry cream sauce pulled everything together.  This is something I will order again.  My husband ordered the bone in rib eye.  It was huge.  He ate the entire thing.  I tried it and loved it.  He had Roquefort added on top and it made something that was already delicious even more delicious.  There were 5 of us total, and we ordered 3 sides: sweet potato, fully loaded baked potato, and the roast tomatoes.  We did struggle to finish everything.  These potatoes are HUGE.  And so good.  The bacon at Bavettes is thick cut amazingness.  Add that to a potato with cheese and sour cream and you really have something.Bavettes is a great place for a date.  There were lots of dates going on around us.  I went with 4 guy friends and they all loved the food.  This place also makes a mean cocktail.  The lounge area is a perfect place to kick back with friends.  It has a cool atmosphere, but it isn't too loud.  This is a great addition to the River North scene.  I look forward to becoming a regular."
"I have a metaphoric and obvious boner for a few things: victorian-industrial spaces, steel, parlors, vests. I am -that- person and even though I should probably apologize for being so annoying, I can't. So it's pretty reasonable that my reviews for Sodikoff-operated restaurants are always the most obnoxiously long and usually borderline rabid with fandom (which is funny, because I am generally not a fan of people), and this is obviously not going to be an exception. Except this time, unlike Au Cheval in February, other people clearly know it is open.So we didn't crash this staff dinner. We showed up... with a table in our name. Like real people. Like real F&F instead of restaurant hookers like we were in February.But for real. This is some of the best food we have ever had. It isn't that we're obsessed (although let's not lie to ourselves here) that we think this, either. It's because it really is some of the best from start to finish: inventiveness, flavor, prep, plating, service, whatever, froth on. Like so good that we had to really nitpick to find constructive criticism. Maybe we are easy to please. We were unbelievably pleased. Because I am feeling especially obnoxious and hungover I am going to write about everything in detail now.Things we ordered:- Peppered duck and goat cheese terrine. Are you fucking SERIOUS? (yes.) I don't really know how to describe this. This may be tied for my favorite thing I have eaten on a piece of bread, ever, and I didn't even know I wanted it. I mean, it's terrine. Shreddy duck and slightly gamey goat cheese and pepper. Taste and believe, mfers.- Honey apple manchego salad. Killer, sort of sweet, and INTERESTING for being a vegetable. And very large so be forewarned (we needed greens).- Prime ribeye, bone-in. We had to order this, we were told. So fucking happy about that one. What can you even say about this? It's a perfect cut of meat. It is. I can probably never order it again, but you should, even just once.- Mushroom stroganoff. I have been trying to find mushroom stroganoff for weeks. It's the middle of summer so you can imagine I haven't fared well. This is with paparadelle and comes with big hunks of meat. This is a nod to people who love Gilt Bar, and just as good.- Loaded baked potato. It's what you think, except they use the bacon they use everywhere, and is therefore taken up 10 notches.Things we somehow managed to try anyway:- Bacon and tomato salad (the tomatoes are roasted and topped in bacon, like a perverted BLT-caprese without the cheese).- Elote-style corn. Creamy and wonderful. I have no idea how it fits on this menu. I don't care. You know what it goes well with? Meat, which is how we had it.- Foie terrine, in which we are served a giant slab of it on top of an already enormous steak.- Whiskey ice cream with some type of caramel sauce. Hooooooly. It had a candle in it courtesy of Johnny. It was not a birthday. It's the little things.Things we will be ordering next week when we inevitably return:- Giant meatball. It is technically meatball and pasta but it's a fucking 10oz meatball so, I'm pretty sure the balance here is gonna be in favor of meat.- Chocolate souffle. Allow 30 minutes. We were about to die and did not get it this time.- Everything else.I had two mint juleps. I always get stuck on a cocktail. The mint julep is to Bavette's as the violet smash is to Maude's - nobody understands it, everybody likes it. It doesn't really taste julep, but it tastes like something awesome. The parlor is downstairs and features more men in vests, one of who (the fabulous Mike B., now at the bar too) created me what I think was some type of customized beautiful corpse reviver that I wish I remembered more of. It looks like The Office had a child with Curio but on the way borrowed a few chromosomes from Au Cheval. That's the downstairs.Bavette's is a brilliant best-of. It takes all the greatest hits (the Au Cheval cheeseburger, the Gilt house made pastas, the notorious bread, the pork fat fries) and then adds a steak section. The staff here is a bunch of fucking rock stars, who I am so happy put up with us and even seem to maybe like us. And the vests. We owe this one to Johnny B., who is one of the best (who you'll know if you've been to Gilt) - but really, we like everybody here. A lot. How can you not? It's a joke. I will be such a regular here it will disgust people. My bank will probably call. Technically, it's not even open yet, so we have a few more days to feel special before everyone discovers the majesty that is Bavette's Bar and Bouef and attempt to take all the reservations that will soon be mine."
"I went here with my family for my parent's 33rd wedding anniversary and I was a bit disappointed. I definitely dug the Boardwalk Empire feel of the restaurant, and the service, drinks and appetizers was good, but two steaks came out well done, when they were ordered medium rare and rare. With all the great steak houses in Chicago, there are definitely a lot of  better options."
another amazing dinner from start to finish
"Maude's tower is a definite must if you love seafood. A nice variety of oysters, shellfish and fish tartare. Dry aged ribeye, also another must. Generous portion is perfectly cooked, tender, and mouth watering."
"To be fair, I've not actually tried it. But I tried to call and make a reservation and they shut me down immediately - they aren't taking groups larger than 6. Very strange."
"I took my sister here last night for her bday...i wanted to write a review both because we loved it so much and because we ate a bit differently from everyone else who dines here.  My sister and i are not big steak eaters so when we go to these kinds of places(mastros) we concentrate on the appetizers and the sides.  Here is what we got...for apps we had the salmon tartare....diced up salmon on lavash crackers...light and delicious. We also had the shrimp de jonghe...6 decent sized shrimp in this buttery sauce....amazing.  We had trouble deciding on salads but ended up with the whitefish caeser...a bit heavy...perfect to split and very smokey    We wanted the crab stuffed avocado but thought we would see if we were still hungry . We never got it as we were stuffed. Oh well...next time. We got the fries....same as au cheval and gilt bat if you have ever been to either place. Yum. We also had the corn which was fantastic. My sister enjoyed eating it in the salad. The creamed spinach was heavy on the blue cheese and a diaappointment. When they saw we didnt like it, they took it off the bill. We didnt have room for dessert.  The tab was really reasonable. Obviously we didnt have entrees but there was so much food. The bread and butter to start was also phenomenal!!"
"Before this meal, I was already a fan of Brendan Sodikoff. Gilt Bar and Au Cheval both offer generous portions of high quality grub, with a side of hedonism just the way I like it. After dining at Bavettes, I can safely say that my fandom has morphed into groupiedom. I went here with 5 dudes, all of whom started with Old Fashioneds. Bavette's mixes up three ($13-14) - a standard version with single barrel Four Roses, a Sazerac with VS Cognac, and an extra strong one mixed with Weller's 107 proof. All are delicious, but the latter stood out in my mind - a no-nonsense cocktail with lots of swagger. Roast duck and Goat Cheese Terrine ($11.50) is a hefty and rich appetizer; the duck and cheese are not mixed together, but served heterogeneously, with a generous portion of grilled bread. This is well-executed charcuterie to say the least. Salads are all made to share; apple and belgian endive ($11.99) is a well-executed version of an old standard, and as with all great salads, not overdressed. The star in this category, however, is the poached Whitefish Caesar ($10); maybe it's my Jewish heritage, but the perfectly poached, smoky fish adds an unexpectedly perfect complement to the classic. I really enjoyed this. Steak Frites ($21, +$4 for various and sundry extra accoutrements) is reasonably priced and cooked to perfection, served with an ample side of perfectly fried spuds (which, along with Gilt Bar's, are among Chicago's best). It's well executed, but does not really stand out. Bone-in ribeye (somewhere around $50; I don't know because my friend, but not I, could afford it), on the other hand, melts in your mouth and has great beef flavor. This is an excellent cut of meat. Lamb Chops ($35) look like they come from the Flintstones, with massive bones and enormous hunks of meat. Beef Tongue ($18) is braised with a piquant red wine sauce and horseradish - I guess this was the second time a traditionally Jewish ingredient snuck its way onto this menu, and I'm ever so glad it did. Decor, as with all the Sodikoff joints, adds to the hedonistic element; in this case, transporting you to a 1920s era steakhouse (upstairs) or to Rudyard Kipling's basement (downstairs, though this was a bit whimsical for my personal taste, and involved the always kitschy fake books). We ate upstairs, and I felt like Nuchy Thompson. Service is attentive but not in your face. What's not to love?"
"Hands down my new favorite spot in Chicago. I live in the area and could not wait to try this place out. The overall ambiance and atmosphere is really comfortable and warm.  The first time here I sat and ate at the bar with a couple of buddies. The best part of our experience was not even the outstanding food/drinks- it was our bartender Zach. What a pleasure- he whipped up some wildly good drinks and essentially hand picked our meals based on our conversation. Top notch drinks, great food and unmatched service. I have been back several times and will continue to dine here regularly."
"Fabulous! Early reso(5:15)...only time available, so I knew it would be crowded later. Sat us in a quaint corner table. Ambiance is masculine & sexy. Good vibe. Service was an A+! Ricky & Brandon were delightful...definitely a match made in heaven:) Food was delish. Started out with the 2# lobster cocktail...fresh...firm & sweet. Served with clarified butter, cocktail sauce and a zesty dijonaise. We shared the Southern Fried Chicken, Elote...and the Chocolate Cream Pie! Say Whatttt? That effing pie made me cream in my panties...just joshing...but I was close...ha! Thanks for a lovely experience, we will be back with a gaggle of ladies...who love to eat, drink & have a good ol time!"
"This place is fantastic!  It's my favorite restaurant in the city.  When we have visitors in town, this is our go to spot.  The atmosphere makes anyone feel instantly cooler and the food is out of this world."
"BAD to WORSE to FOOD POISONING: I rarely write Yelp Reviews because I just don't have time, yet I so often rely on Yelpers when choosing our next venture. I am writing because I hope my fellow YELPERS take notice. We dine at upscale restaurants at least once a week from places like Alinea and Chicago Cut to everything in River North and on Randolph St, so we know what good food is.I, initially, had high expectations from all of the rave yelp reviews. I had booked a reservation for Sun, but  called to cancel it yesterday at 7:50pm. The hostess asked me when I wanted to reschedule and I jokingly said, you don't have anything tonight do you? She said we have an 8pm opening, can you be here soon? I said, I can be there by 8:20pm, would that work and she said yes, she would hold it.THE BAD: We rushed to get there exactly 8:20pm and that is where the BAD started. We walked in and we were told it would just be a few minutes, but we should just go sit inside and get a drink. I was famished, and the last thing I wanted was to wait. I had just spoke to the hostess 25 minutes ago arriving exactly when I said, for an 8pm table that she was holding. How is it that 20 min after our reservation someone is still eating at our table? I'll tell you, poor management skills for an upscale restaurant is how. I loved the speakeasy rustic atmosphere, but it's dimly lit, so we were trying to figure out where we were allowed to sit to wait as the bar was completely full. I talked to the hostess 10 min later and told her we were going to the bar downstairs so we weren't in people's way, but made it clear that we were antsy to eat, explaining we had plans in an hour. As we are sitting at a table in the downstairs (which is so dark, you can barely see 5 feet in front of you) I hear a scuffle from the table in the entryway between a 4 top and the hostess. There were some terse words exchanged about them being told they could sit there and the hostess telling them they had to move. I offered our table b/c I knew by this point we should be seated any minute (it had been 20 min). I am pretty sure had we not offered up that table, they would have stormed out, it wasn't pleasant as I could hear them 10 ft away and they were pissed (and in their 40's, not some young kids). We went back upstairs b/c I wanted to be visible as it had been over 20 min and I was starving and annoyed. A reservation in my book means, you have a table you are holding that is OPEN. Not one that you hope opens up 30 min after I get there. We sit at the now empty couch and a waiter approaches us asking if we want a drink. I furrow my brow and tell him we just want our table, since we have been waiting over 20-25 min. He asked if we wanted a mgr to come over and I said no, I just want to order food as we are supposed to be meeting friends at 9:30pm. About 5 min later the hostess seats us in the waiter's section who initially approached us, he was the ONLY positive about our evening. Now comes the WORSE. The FOOD was as close to AWFUL as it gets for an upscale restaurant where you can count on about $100 p/p. Nothing inventive, nothing exciting, just standard steakhouse food, so it should be fabulous, right? I order 3 COROMANDEL (FOOD POISONING)  raw oysters, roasted bone marrow and my husband gets the beet salad for apps. We order the the 24oz Bone in Dry Aged Ribeye and potato to split, plus drinks. I quickly change my potato to go for the wedge salad (I am a connoisseur of them). I get my 3 oysters and not only does one taste really funky, but all 3 taste like they are sitting in a saline solution bath. They literally tasted like someone soaked them in a  bucket of salt and I am a seasoned oyster eater (Shaw's loves me). The Bone Marrow and Beet Salad come. I love bone marrow, and my husband will partake in a bite, but when he did, he squished his nose in dislike. I then ate a few scoops and it was the worst tasting marrow I have ever had. Maybe my oysters had hepatitis and my cow had mad cow disease. Either way, they were awful (but I was famished and used the great jelly to mask the flavor). The beets were too thinly sliced, not a good chunky beet--lacking flavor for his salad (his complaint not mine). Here is where I lost it. I already had crappy oysters and bone marrow, his beets were too thin for him,  but then my wedge salad came. How can you screw that up? Bavette's can! The core of the wedge was so big and bitter. Throw it out when you have that much yellow core; and the dressing, the WORST. It tasted like watered down mayo, with a hint of ranch flavoring (I hate ranch) w/ some blue cheese crumbles. The steak was solid (it was $56) it better be.THE FOOD POISONING: We left to go meet 8 of our friends at Mastro's. I didn't drink or eat a thing there. They asked our opinion as none of them had been, we both gave it a thumbs down. But then came the icing on the cake--me vomitting and other things all morning from my meal at Bavette's. DON'T GO!"
"Bavette's is now in my Top 5 favorite Chicago restaurants (no easy task).The ambiance itself sets this place apart from many others. We dined in the Parlor in the lower level, it was dark but not too dark and was a wonderfully intimate and unique atmosphere.The food was spectacular:Sourdough Bread- Great, just don't fill up on itBaked Goat Cheese- ExcellentTrout Caesar Salad- Good, not great. To get to great, it could use more of the chips in there for additional crunch to offset the lettuce and generous portion of troutShortrib Stronganoff- ExcellentSteak and Frites- ExcellentElote- ExcellentWe will definitely be back soon to try some other items."
"Sodikoff et al, can you do no wrong? From my first experience at Maude's to my visits to Au Cheval, Gilt Bar and the wonderful Doughnut Vault, I can't help but to think that this is THE restaurant group that will carry Chicago's dining scene into 2013. Bavette's is no different; it's at the top of my list of places to go for any number of occasions whether it be a date, group dinner (quiet enough to have intelligible conversations), or drinks w/small bites. Lovely decor and ambience, AWESOME servers, and best of all, amazing food! It's a Euro steakhouse also serves some excellent seafood, but let's focus on the red meat first; in my two visits, I've had the lamb chops and the bone-in ribeye. The lamb chops were some of the BEST I've ever had in my life; so succulent, juicy, tender, and flavorful, I tell everyone that THIS is the place to go for lambchops. My last visit was was the time I was able to try the massive bone-in ribeye; perfection. Big enough to share, although you won't want to, risking the loosening of the belt at the table routine that I'm sure many of you are no strangers to (and luckily the restaurant is dark enough to potentially hide if you're ninja enough). What more can I say? Bavette's delivers on its meat!Next up - the Grand Tower. The price has actually increased since I first dined there, so I'm not sure if they added some additional items, but I ordered it with 3 friends the first time and we were presented w/2oz of salmon ceviche, about a dozen very large shrimp, and 2 dozen oysters (split between east coast and west coast varieties). The entire tower, as its name implies, is indeed grand. And it was quite a bit of food; it's really enough to share with a group of 6 as a starter. Super fresh, super tasty, and well worth the splurge.The other stand out dish? The bacon roasted tomato salad. Listen. They take two generous, thick cut pork belly and cure it in house. Read that again. Yes, you read that right. You love bacon. Well, you think you love bacon. Then you try Bavette's bacon and you suddenly understand the universe. It's eye-opening. It's magical. And best of all, it's real, and available for all to order, savor, and order again. Please, get this. Get the bacon roasted tomato. (The tomato was pretty damn good, too btw).I also tried the fried chicken (moist, but the batter could use some tweaking as it basically burned), the beef stroganoff (very flavorful, generous helpings of braised beef), the corn elotes (a must get), and of course the Golden Sundae (with a 'magic shell' chocolate coating and whiskey gelato courtesy of Black Dog). All in all, a fantastic place that has leapt to the top of my favorites list in Chicago."
The food is absolutely great let me first just say. The ambiance is cozy but Disappointing. After waiting well over an hour the put a this crappy little table right when you walk in. Our server was pretty rude and seemed bothered to be there or help. I give 3 stars only because of food. I heard how fabulous this was supposed to be and was let down.
"Went here for the first time last night. We sat at the bar, enjoyed some whiskey old fashions, and ordered oysters. Wonderful atmosphere, friendly staff and crowd...overall cool place."
"We had an excellent  experience at Bavettes last week.  The food and service was perfect! Such a beautiful space!  Had a funny yet personable and confident server who appeared to be sick that night and we were some what concerned about getting hs cold or the way our food was being handled.  I'm sure just our germ phobias kicking in.  Overall a great experience!  Must go.Afterward we went next door to check out the Git bar.  Beautiful place also, but took forever to get a drink at the bar."
"Second visit and second matched the first - great.  Service was outstanding food was outstanding.  We will definitely return.  Caution portions are large so bring your appetite. The malted whiskey ice cream was yummy, serves two normal dessert lovers."
"Yum! Lobster appetizer was dreamy, short rib stroganoff SO good, filet perfectly cooked and cheeks super tender.  Whiskey Icecream perfect ending!  We woke up the next day still dreaming about the food we ate. YUM."
"This place is great, was there over the holiday weekend enjoying some great food. Service was AWESOME. Definitely would go back here. Steak was EXCELLENT!!!"
"This is one of the better places to eat that we've been to in Chicago, and that's saying waaaay more than a lot.  Worth the high price tag.  Manhattan's were perfect.  Bone-in ribeye is top 5 I've ever had.  It should be a city law to start your meal with the smoked whitefish Caesar salad and a wedge.  Don't even question it, just order those when you sit down.  The service is slow, but I think that's on purpose.  We weren't in a hurry, so didn't really care.  Best place I've been to in a while."
"Fantastic food, outstanding service and great ambience!  This is my new favorite steak house!"
Great atmosphere. Amazing food. D-bag bartender... or mixologist... whatever it is you think you are. I won't specify which one but I would do something about that.
"We had a 7:45 reservation on a Tuesday.  We were there on time, but we weren't seated until 8:15.   Service was slow the entire night and the waiter had a pretty serious attitude.  Food was decent.  The sides were the highlight of the meal, but didn't make up for the shortcomings elsewhere.  I'm in no rush to get back to Bavette's and would much rather go to Maude's."
"Delicious. Dark ,comfy and sexy."
"Top notch, top notch."
"After about five visits, this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, and I am not a food critic but I've eaten at half of the Michelin-starred places in town. It remains tough to get a table on OpenTable but not so bad if you're willing to call ahead or wait at the bar for a little bit. In a nutshell: Five star food, in River North, at three-star prices. Everything I've tried (a couple steaks, chicken, duck, most of the sides) has been very good and the drinks, particularly the Sazerac and the Weller Old Fashioned, are fantastic. Service is very good and if you open a tab at the bar, they will give you your card back and keep the tab so you don't have to go back the next day to get it.  I was so relieved to see it fall off the top 5 restaurants in Chicago list (and therefore off the maps of so many tourists). So why am I giving the place five stars? Because my mom taught me not to lie to people."
another home run for sodikoff outstanding cocktails and the food just as good service spot on
"This place is amazing.  Great drinks, great food, good service.  We started with the wedge salad and some oysters.  The salad was prob enough for 3 with some pretty amazing thick cut bacon on top.  For our mains, we had the ribeye and the roasted chicken.  The chicken was perfectly moist with crispy skin.  We got the boneless ribeye and it melted in our mouths.  Dessert was the whiskey ice cream...delicious.  The good atmosphere and Jameson shots with a pickle back topped off the night."
"The food and atmosphere were both incredible. The service was just right - not overbearing, not snooty, but always (quietly) there when you need it."
"Really wanted to like Bavette's.  The space is beautiful, and they make one of the best Old Fashioned that I've ever had.   They may be on par with Aviary for that drink, although my wife's negroni was not great, and we have had better at many places in the area.  The goat cheese appetizer is amazing, and their in-house baked bread is delicious.  But, then I got their dry aged bone-in ribeye.  I've been to steak places all over Chicago, and I have to say this was without a doubt the worst steak I've ever had since going to Sizzler in my college days.  Fatty, gristly, without any of the typical flavor that you would get from dry aging, just awful.  Their wine list also was very disappointing as the wines either were not good, or had such a large mark-up that is bounded on the ridiculous.  We also had the corn side, which was good.  As I said, really wanted to like the place, but if you specialize in beef, make a good steak.  If I was in the area, I'd go back for a drink and appetizer, but would not go for dinner."
"this place is quickly becoming my favorite spot. even though i am not a huge meat person. their steak are something to die for. when we first discovered it awhile back, we went twice in the same week for their steak. it is heavy and not good for cholesterol so i reserve it only for special occasions. the atmosphere is great as well. service is always pleasant."
"Was I on the set of Mad Men?! The atmosphere was amazing. Dim lighting, leather booths and chandeliers...fabulous. Meal was delicious and the pacing was perfect. An awesome server just added to the experience. My new favorite restaurant. Worth every penny. If you like Maude's and Mastro's...you will love Bavette's!"
"Loved it! - the caesar salad, filet mignon and wiskey gelato were delicious and very satisfying.  I also had one of the best Sazeracs ever.  Service was great, prompt, friendly and even provided suggestions for the chef's other places.  My only issue, which was a relatively minor one -- my steak was more medium than rare.  Definitely will come back when I am in this wonderful town again."
"This was one of the better meals we've had in Chicago this last year, and we already look forward to coming back.  We snagged 2 spots at the bar last night (NYE) around 6:30p and let the very knowledgeable Bartender do his thing.  We started off with the Baked Goat Cheese, then split the 24oz Prime Bone-in Ribeye steak with 2 sides - Elote Style Corn and the Pommes Frites, and then finished with the Chocolate Cream Pie.  Everything was outstanding, the food, the service, the atmosphere - it is worth the higher prices considering the quality and larger portions as well.  We've only been once, but i feel that this is already our favorite Sodikoff spot."
"I don't eat steak, so I was hesitant to come here considering the price.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  From service to food and everything in between, this was one of the best meals I've had in a while.  Worth the price and the calories, so put this on your list if you want a special meal out in River North.The crab and avocado salad was a standout--the dressing delicious and the serving size generous enough to share.  The salmon was perfectly cooked--flaky, just a little under-done in the middle with a crispy top.  The roasted chicken was very good, but on the heavy side.  The sweet potato, while seemingly basic, stood out as a favorite side.  The elote was surprisingly in a creamy sauce--very flavorful and while not the light vegetable side we envisioned, it was worth it.  The baked goat cheese was very good but the least stand-out dish.The cocktail with St. Germain/elderflower was refreshing.  Get the brickhouse sundae with bourbon gelato and thank me later for the tip.The only minor criticism was they were a little heavy handed with the salt.The service was top notch.  Our server was incredibly friendly and informative.Any friends who tell me they are visiting Chicago soon, I've sent them here, so hurry up and make a reservation."
"I really enjoyed the ambience and food here. I didn't love the snooty girl at reception, but forgot her quickly. We started with the delicious wedge salad, with giant hunks of bacon on it. We moved on to the bone marrow with crunchy bread. These both hit it out of the park. I wanted the fried chicken, but was disappointed to learn, it was dark meant only. Wish they has a breast in there. We had the roasted chicken instead. Juicy and flavorful. The pork chop was dry and did not have much flavor. We had the corn and hash browns for sides. The corn was great, hash browns overcooked and dry. Lastly, the chocolate cream pie.  Fantastic ending to a good meal."
"We had a really nice dinner here. Our server was helpful and attentive when we needed him to be, but allowed us to take our time ordering and to enjoy the experience of the food. The cocktails were nicely balanced, all of the entrees were delicious, and our salad was a great start to our meal. This restaurant is lowly lit and the music accompanied our conversation perfectly. I would have to throw out a word of caution about the valet - a big group started to collect outside of the Gilt Bar, waiting for the valet guys even to be there to take our tickets. At first, I thought it was because they were retrieving cars, but that wasn't the case. Who knows where they were, but when our cars finally came, they sped up to the curb like they had just been racing."
"Brandon has done it again.  I went to Bavette's both nights this weekend.  Friday night just for drinks and loved the space so much we came back on Saturday for dinner.  The chandeliers, dark word and lighting, and leather banquettes made me feel like I was in a different era and was perfect for a chilly fall night.  We tried a number of he specialty cocktails which were delicious.Dinner on Saturday was good but not great for one reason only- too much salt- on every dish. The food was still cooked perfectly- petit filet, salmon and the roasted broccoli- but I felt we needed to drink extra water to compensate for the heavy-handed seasoning. The wine selection was great as well as service."
"Can Sodikoff do any wrong? I first fell in love with Gilt Bar, then Au Cheval, and now Bavette's. The decor is awesome. Classy and traditional. Lots of wood and large chandeliers. But the real winner is the food. I ordered the rib eye and it was excellent. The bernaise sauce on the side was a nice touch. The good cocktail selection helps and I'm looking forward to trying one of these seafood specials."
"Four-star food, three-star service. The food comes in steak-house portions at steak-house prices. Standouts include the smoked trout Caesar salad and the chocolate pie."
