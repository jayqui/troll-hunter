Smoque BBQ
"I've been coming here for quite a while and they still have the best BBQ in town. I always get the ribs and they are delicious but when I tried the brisket and the pulled pork, OMG!!! It's like heaven was in my mouth. I love how you can get two different side dishes when you get the platter, but my favorite side dish would be their coleslaw. I would always tell my friends to go here if they want some BBQ and they will not be disappointed. But I would suggest that you come in early because the line are always all the way out in the streets, but they are fast in getting your orders out. If you don't want to wait in line you van always call ahead and just eat it at home. You will still get to eat the best BBQ but at comforts of your home.If ever someone from out of state comes and visit Chicago. Smoque is one of the places they should try. That is because they are the best!!!"
One of my favorite bbq joints in Chicago.  The ribs are always really good but the brisket is the real star. Their pickup system is great and always great with nothing ever missing from my carry out order.
"Darling fiancé and I went on a whim one day while we were in the neighborhood for lunch. Surprisingly, there was not a wait at all! I like the whole chalkboard menu concept.. Makes for the fast time BBQ experience! Anyways, I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my babe ordered the brisket. We shared a Mac and cheese as well. The service was good and the food was up fast! The Mac and cheese is unforgettable! It was so so yummy! I'm happy I don't live in the neighborhood or I'd be a lot heavier as a result of frequent visits for that reason alone. The pork and brisket were tender and the bbq sauce was on point. I know it may seem trivial, but I judge a BBQ place heavily on their coleslaw and theirs was on point! Very fresh tasting without having too much mayo, etc.We will definitely be back :)"
"I love BBQ and I cook KCBS Competition BBQ I've been to a lot of the top places in this country. Franklin's in Austin, Memphis BBQ Co, Lockhart TX and eaten at the big three so when I say this I have the credentials to back it up. This is one of the top 5 places I've been to. I say this because most places do one or two things good but the other are not. Example the Brisket in TX is amazing but they do a bad job at pork ribs. Memphis does good pork but bad Brisket so on and so on. But here at Smoque they did everything well.Brisket ExcellentRibs ExcellentTX Sausage, is very similar to the Lockhart style sausage Beans are just like OK Joes and they are some of the best in the world.Pork, good Corn Bread is a can't miss"
"I really do enjoy this place. I think it a really good deal for some quick tasty barbecue. I must say that it is not my favorite BBQ spot but it is definitely close to it. Here's what I ordered last time I was there:// St. Louis Full Rack - $20.95 - Theses ribs are so tasty. They have a pretty decent amount of meat on them. They are very soft and tender. It is REALLY hard for me to decide which one I prefer: St Louis or Baby back ribs. The baby back ribs are smaller and more curved. They are a bit sweeter. But the St Louis are more straight on the bone and have a little bit more meat. Not as sweet. I would recommend you get some with a friend and split the two. // Added Sliced Brisket - $5 - This brisket was pretty good but it was a little bit dry. Then there was a time I went back to smoque and the brisket was delicious. So I think it depends on the day, so I would maybe steer you away from getting this due to its inconsistency. I mean if you are hungry, then get it! ha. this is definitely a spot to hit up while you are in Chicago. And Also if you are up north, it helps.  :)"
"My friend and I decided to take a spontaneous trip to Smoque BBQ which has been on our list since we moved here. On a late Friday night around 9, we walked in to a busy, homey joint eager for barbecue. We scanned the menu and walked straight to the counter to order. I got 1/4 rack of St. Louis ribs with cole slaw and Mac n cheese (felt like the perfect portion to me) and she got a 1/3 rack of Baby Back ribs with fries and Mac n cheese (hers came with cole slaw). As we settled down to the picnic like tables, we realized the cramped venue was BYOB. People brought in their own beer and even hard liquor and everyone looked very cheery and comfortable! Our food came shortly after and we of course had to take a first bite of the Mac n cheese - holy cheese gods! The flavors and creaminess of this BBQ side staple were absolutely heavenly and though the silver tin it came in was tiny, I was so excited to gobble down the whole thing. But, I have this thing where I like to save the best for last so I moved on to try the cole slaw. The cole slaw was a downer, not a lot of wetness and too peppery for me. Alas! But the crunchiness of the cabbage was a good complement to everything else. My friend's fries came in a huge portion. They were seasoned well, but felt too heavy for a bbq side in my opinion.Next, the ribs! Man oh man, it's been so long since I've had ribs and they were phenomenal. I cleaned each rib to the bone. Each rib was so meaty and flavorful and the 1/4 rack was perfect! My friends 1/2 baby rack ribs were much smaller (not sure the appeal of baby back over St. Louis?). The ribs came with a small cup of the St. Louis sauce and I wasn't a fan of this sauce actually. It was more tangy than I would prefer. If I were to compare Q BBQ with Smoque, Q would definitely win the sauce category with their variety and unlimited quantities. Since I had brisket at Q, I can't compare the meats, but both had me blown away! After some time, I was ready to finish up my macaroni. I was devastated to find that it got cold and the creaminess kind of curdled. TIP: eat yo mac n cheese right awayBecause Smoque BBQ is rather far away, I see myself going to Q BBQ over Smoque. If it was closer, you better believe I'd be a regular for this top-notch Chicago barbecue!"
"Best BBQ place in the city.The space is small for how popular it is.  You usually wait in a line during peak hours and you'll have to stake out for a spot to sit at.  However it's all worth it when you bite down into your BBQ.Their BBQ brisket and BBQ chicken are so delicious!  I don't have any idea about the science behind smoking but whatever it is they have it down.  Their chicken, ribs, and brisket are always nice and moist (literally falls off the bone).  All their food has a nice and delicious hickory, woody, smokey taste. Their sauces and their sides are just as great.  While I normally think homemade BBQ sauce is vinegary I think Smoque's is not vinegary at all.  My favorite is their hot sauce, I can put that thing on everything.  But their sides... wow!  Unfortunately for other BBQ places in the city, when I think of BBQ sides I always compare others' to Smoque's.  The cornbread, the mac and cheese, the cole slaw, the peach cobbler, the fries... it's all so good.  You won't go wrong anyway so try them all.  They are BYOB so it makes for a nice evening if you're able to sit outside.  Be prepared to eat and leave though, this is not a sit and hang out type of place."
"There isn't much that I could say in my review that differs from the other 3,000 reviews haven't covered, but I am just going to reiterate the fact that the baby back ribs are f***ing amazing.  A couple days prior to my visit at Smoque my fiance had found out that I never eaten any ribs...ever!  I know, okay, it's very strange that I've lived in one of the greatest cities for food (BBQ especially) and have never eaten ribs.  It's not like I had some outrageous grudge against them - they've just eluded me.  But no longer!  I went to Smoque with my fiance and we split a full slab of those baby back, baby back, baby back ribs and they could not have been any better!  If you haven't had the pleasure of trying ribs before then THIS is the one and only place that should be your introduction to the phenom that is a baby back rib.  Even if you have eaten ribs before then you still need to go to Smoque.  It was televised on the Food Network for a reason guys!  The ribs really are that good!  The meat is some of the most tender I've tasted in a long time and you can rip it off the bone so easily.  Indulge your inner carnivore!  Besides the tenderness of the meat, the ribs also have a smoky-sweet flavor that couldn't possibly get any tastier.  Sure, the ribs are somewhat expensive, especially if you order a full slab instead of a half slab, but don't use that as an excuse not to get any.  You're not going to be eating ribs every week so you can afford a splurge on some noteworthy ribs once in a while.  They are worth every dollar you spend on them, I guarantee that!The ribs do come with two sides so we ordered the BBQ beans and the cornbread.  I will say that the sides are not the best I've had and in fact the cornbread seemed a little stale, but regardless of this the sides were not bad by any mean.  To put it simply, they just were not my favorite.  What the sides lacked, though, the meat made up for.  I'm serious - the ribs were glorious.  That is what you're going there for anyways.  Just keep in mind that your stomach is going to have to rumble for about a half an hour to an hour because of the long line.  Yes, I know that long lines are quite annoying to deal with but take it as an indication of how good the meat is there.  Luckily for you, Smoque is a BYOB so you can bring a beer for that long wait you will surely have to endure.  Also, a sidenote, just know what you want to order way before you get to the counter because it will make the process much quicker for you and for everyone else that also has to wait in line.  It's just a courtesy thing.  I'm sure that the employees will appreciate that more as well!  Keep in mind that they are extremely swamped for the entire time that they are working; despite this they are still extremely friendly!Oh!  Oh!  One last tip - it says that Smoque closes at 9 pm, but they actually lock their doors around 8:45 pm so that they don't have a line out the door at 9 pm.  If you can get there earlier than that is better - you don't want to run the risk of not getting in!  They do close it a little earlier because it takes a while to actually cook the meat.  Again, this is definitely the go-to place for all your rib first-timers like myself!  Who am I kidding though?  This is a go-to place for anyone that loves BBQ!"
"Finally made it to Smoque last week & this place did not disappoint!  I was warned to get there early and by 5:45pm on a Friday, the line was already forming. I had to wait about 10 minutes to order and was quickly seated.  The staff does a nice job of finding a spot for you to sit, letting you know when you're number is called, and clearing trash away for the next guests. The food was the real highlight though. I opted for the chopped brisket plate with a choice of 2 sides and slaw for ~$14. The portion of meat was substantial and I had plenty to take home. The meat is definitely the center piece at Smoque, with all meats served with two sauces on the side.  Meats are paired with specific sauces that complement the cuts and flavorings of the dish and I enjoyed the contrast of the two sauces that came with my meal - one was a thick and creamy mesquite sauce and the other was a brisket-specific, vinegar based sauce. Both were tasty! I hoped the brisket would compete with the likes of some of the Austin BBQ I've tried, but it didn't quite get there. A pretty solid Chicago alternative, but I've still gotta make the trek to ATX the best of brisket country.Lots of sides to choose from but I went with the mac & cheese and the fries. The mac & cheese was decadent, with just the right amount of cheese flavor.  The small portion left me wanting more, and I later saw other customers choose mac & cheese for both of their sides to make up for it (what a great idea!).  The fries were served hot and fresh in a small brown paper bag and were plenty to share with a friend.  Portion-wise, the fries were the better deal. The place is BYOB (except for the patio, which is a bummer) & totally surprised me! They would still have quite the crowd without the added bonus of bringing your own booze, but I happily spent all the extra dough I saved on treating myself to a hot peach cobbler. Can't wait to go back and try more of the cuts of meat and sides!"
"I got 5 (stars) on it!!This place is awesome.  It can get crowded, but they do a great job of keeping things orderly with the seating, the line, etc.  Great job on the execution of that.The meat was delicious.  The brisket, the pulled pork and the ribs were all excellent.  The brisket was the best in my opinion.  I also suggest the fries as a side.  They are tasty and they give you a ton.  I do not recommend the beans.  I just didn't like them.  The mac and cheese was good, but it was small.  The cornbread was also good, but small.They have byob, I repeat byob.  Just bring in whatever you have and go to town.I thought the prices were reasonable on all fronts, but when you figure in that you can byob, the value goes up exponentially.The girl working the cash register was nice and answered all the questions I had both times I went.  Yes, there were two visits to smoque during the trip to Chicago...Yes that is a 750ml bottle. It went down!"
"Loved this place, stopped here before I had to fly out. Ordered the 1/2 slab of baby back ribs. My two sides were the brisket chili, fries, and it already comes with slaw. These ribs were the best I have ever had. I didn't even need bbq sauce. Just ate it dry, meat just fell right off the bones. Loved the way they smoked the ribs, flavor was bursting. Chili was excellent, and fries were great. Their slaw was good, but may take time to get used to it. Overall experience was more then expected. Would love to come back if I'm ever in town again!"
"So hungry and excited to try one of the most popular restaurants in Chicago, my friends and I stopped here for lunch and drinks. It's BYOB so we brought a few bottles of Stella to accompany our ribs. Between 4 people, we shared 2 racks of ribs, a platter of beef brisket, and a platter of pulled pork + sides (mac & cheese, fries, and a salad. Total was $50ish. The food came out pretty fast and we digged in (after a few pictures for social medias).The baby back ribs were dry rubbed and I did not enjoy it as much as Pappy's in St. Louis or Phil's in San Diego, CA. But my friend, who is an expert in ribs and he loves dry rubbed, loved the ribs here. The meat is good but the meat didn't fall off as easily and not as tender. You do get to dip into different sauces that are available and each one has a subtle difference.The sides aren't unique and nothing stood out. The beef briskets were super tender and just melts in your mouth. I think that was my favorite part of the meal. The pulled pork was seasoned pretty well, but it's nothing amazing. I guess I failed to see what got all the other 3000 people to think that this place is amazing...Street parking is fairly easy to find and it's free!"
"3.2/5I found this place due to all the amazing yelp reviews, but I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. The St. Louis ribs & the brisket was tender, but the sauces were just ""okay"". The sauce really makes or breaks the meal. The sides were small, but the fries were plenty. The peach cobbler was also my favorite part of the meal. If only they include a scoop of vanilla ice cream, that would really hit the spot. The service was amazing though. The server was very attentive. We were very pleased. I also love when parking is free. Just park along the roads nearby."
"Carryout Review: Great BBQ for a good price, Smoque is some good classic eatin!The good: Great tasting food all around. The variety was fantastic, a little bit of everything. Pulled pork and chili were the highlights for me personally, but everything tasted really good. There was even peach cobbler, which was fantastic. Great value. For catering, they packaged very well.The bad: The baked beans tasted like plastic and were terrible. The meat was too dry for my taste.Atmosphere: N/AService: N/AFood: 8/10"
"2 Meat Platter (Pulled Pork, Sliced Beef Brisket) w/ Slaw & 2 Sides (Macaroni & Cheese, Cornbread)The 2 Meat Platter served w/ Slaw and 2 Sidesa la Carte - $8.95w/ Slaw & 2 Sides - $12.45Yes, it's another BBQ Joint; you're best not to get tired of BBQ here... If so, I feel bad for ya! Here at Smoque, you can expect an absolute line out the door, so be sure to get here no later than 11am if you want a seat. The atmosphere is the a-typical BBQ joint. Small, not much for seating and the main focus being the fantastic Q! Which in my honest opinion is pretty rockin'. Keep the atmosphere, just give me good food!As seen on Triple D's Real Deal BBQ, it is the Real Deal and Smoque lives up to it. So if you're in the Chicago area and you're looking for the ""best of the best"" BBQ, stop by Smoque and get it!"
"Love this place. 2nd time going figure i give a reviewParking: Street and lot. Place can get crowded so hopefully not too bad for ya. I never had a problem but luck goes a long way. Free btwScene:  can get crowded with lines looped through the establishment. Place can accommodate enough but its not the biggest place. Has a bbq line order feel with more lively vibe if that makes sense. Casual atmosphere overall.Service: Nice enough for a place like this. Someone leads you to the order line, gives you a ticket, you order, once you are served they show you your seat to eat. Simple enough but could imagine witha large party this being mildly troubling oh well. Everyone one is nice. No issuesFood: I order the bean spicy chili, mac n cheese, and chicken BBQ. Portion size are a lil on the small side for the side dishes wish is a let down but the taste makes up for it. Everything is fresh, hot, and packs great taste. I'd recommend each dish I mentioned. Overall: If you need a bbq fix can't go wrong with place. Small portions and long line but its worth it especially if youve never been. Cheers"
"I'm pleased to report the fries are back to their former stellar quality. The brisket is still the best choice in my opinion.  Tip - No alcohol is allowed on the outdoor patio so if you BYOB (as in booze), you'll need to sit inside. You'll be closer to the candied jalapenos anyway so no big deal."
"Disclaimer: I haven't been to the actual location. During my 4 years working at Ticketmaster between 2009-2013, we used to always have Smoque catered and that's where I fell in love with it.Their mac n cheese is simply the best. Hands down, it's the best I've ever had. I don't really need to say anything else about it. If you go to Smoque, order the mac n cheese one way or another.Their BBQ is absolutely phenomenal. The brisket and pulled pork are some of the best I've ever had and personally think they're the most tender and delicious in the city. I recommend the platters, however I've never tried the sandwiches and would imagine as long as the meat is the same, they're probably just as good. This place doesn't need a long and drawn out review. It's some of the best BBQ around, and I'm not just talking Chicago."
"I've only had Smoque catering, so I can't speak for the service or ambiance, but the food - wowwee! I had a pulled pork sandwich, BBQ chicken, corn bread, coleslaw, mac and cheese, and bourbon-pecan bread pudding. THE GOOD:- The pulled pork was tender and juicy, and tasted phenomenal on the sandwich. There were several sauce options, so naturally, I poured all of them on my sandwich. - The coleslaw wasn't too mayo-y, and added a really nice and refreshing component to the meal- The mac and cheese was truly out of this world. Smooth and creamy, not too salty, jam-packed with flavor-  THE BREAD PUDDING OH MY GOD OH  MY GOD. I wouldn't say that this is a traditional bread pudding - because it's not - and so it cannot be directly compared with those fresh from the South, but that's what makes this so amazing. It tastes like a pecan pie with a bourbon kick, with the soft and smooth texture of a bread pudding on the inside, with a pie-like textured crust. Different, but in a great way!MEH:- The chicken was fine. Nothing special. Kind of plain - the flavor didn't seep into the middle. - The corn bread was not sweet or spicy enough. It was very bland and a waste of calories. The only positive was the little pieces of corn in the mix - they were delightful."
20-25 min wait at 6pm on a Saturday night is not bad for this place. They have a good system of seating and ordering. The food is pretty darn great.-Rib Combo. I can't say if the baby back ribs are necessarily better than the St Louis. They are just 2 versions and both are good. (I prefer baby back)-Pulled pork - no need for additional bbq sauce. it's just great on it's on.-sliced brisket - this was falling apart in a good way :)- I actually like their coleslaw! - cuz it has no mayo...vinegar based. almost inspired me to figure out their recipe. I like that the bbq sauce containers tells you which sauce to use for which meat. That was useful
"This place is barbeque heaven. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich. The brisket was juicy and absolutely perfect. I love that we were given a side of two different barbeque sauces (smoky and sweeter). It came with cole slaw and a side.  When it comes to the sides, we only tried the mac and cheese and fries...both were delicious. The place got pretty crowded (it was early afternoon), so we snagged a table on the patio. Definitely sit outside if you can! It just adds to the barbecue experience.I'm excited to go back to Smoque and try some of their pulled pork!"
Meat is so juicy it falls off the bone (well flavored). the flavor is great. I love this place. Waiting in line for 30 mins on Father's Day but well worth it!!
"This might be the only place where I can say everything is good here. I've tried like 80% of the menu and it's all tasty. I've tried many great BBQ places in the south and this little place in Chicago rivals all of them. I guess that's not a surprise since this place has a nod from Michelin. My favorites are the pulled pork and brisket. I also really like that the menu is a la Carte, it makes for tasting various things easier. I first came here with a large group for a birthday party. They don't take reservations but the staff was kind enough to help seat our large party; very good service overall. I love this place and I will keep coming here and recommending that everyone should come here as well."
"Joint is overrated. Hard to believe that people will stand in line 40+ minutes for the dried-out chicken, oil-soaked fries, overly sweet BBQ'ed beans, flavorless slaw, and dried out cornbread I had last night on my first and likely last visit to Smoque. You know the feeling of disappointment when you blow your week's diet on something rich and decadent that doesn't even taste that good? Exactly.But if you and your loud unruly children love small portions of mediocre food served on cafeteria trays in an obnoxiously loud, alcohol-free setting, go for it!"
"A really hole in the wall kinda place, it is infamous for its BBQ there is always a line but it's a Byob, so brings a glass of your favourite wine/spirit along and wait your turnThe staff is friendly and alert, we ordered the ribs they were tasty but slightly dry would have liked them juicer. Our friend got the brisket which was super tender an tasty.The Cole slow is made with vinegar and pepper which is light and delicious You get a table to still within a short wait, must try!!"
"Luckily, I always seem to miss the ridiculously long lines here.  I've been here a few times now and I always at least get the brisket as part of my meal.  The pulled pork is good, but I've always preferred some good smoked brisket.  I've had the brisket chopped and sliced and I personally prefer it sliced.  I like to see how juicy the meat is and the defined smoke ring near the edges whereas when it's chopped, the consistency is more like shredded beef.  Smoque's sliced brisket is definitely top 3 in Chicago."
"As a Texas native, I didn't have high hopes. But oh my goodness is the brisket good here! I'm so relieved I found a place where I can get true Southern brisket!"
"This might be the unicorn of reviews for this establishment but it's honest. I saw Smoque featured on the Food Network and told my family we had to try it. There was 10 of us, and we had a big table. The staff was really attentive. The food was just okay. I was not impressed with the barbecue. The ribs were okay. The seasoning was bland. Mediocre at best. Honestly just drive to Kansas City, Tennessee or other barbecue capitals to get the real stuff. Chicago should just stick to the pizza, beef and hot dogs, and leave the barbecue to the pros."
"In Chicago for the day seeking a lunch spot to fill and plump us up to fight the chill.  Hubs and I tend to hit DDD spots while traveling and he LOVES BBQ... So I cross checked the Flavortown recs against 2800 glowing Yelp reviews...and Smoque seemed like a clear choice for lunch. Just a heads up for newbies like us -- you have to order *then* you get a seat.  They keep it moving in here and it was basically PACKED at 11:15 when we arrived.Here is what we ordered:Brisket platter (chopped, no bun) with fries and smoked baked beans1/2 Chicken Platter with mac & cheese, brisket chili, slaw x2 (stolen from hubs)Added a ""taste"" of St. Louis ribs for $6Total for tons of food + 2 sodas = $37.67 The star of the show at Smoque had to be the baked beans.  They actually put these beans in the smoker, and you can totally taste it.  However, should I return to a BBQ joint for the baked beans alone?  Hmmmm...The mac & cheese was good -- there was just not a whole lot of it.  (Spoken like a true carb addict and mac and cheese lover, I know.)  It is baked with a crumb top -- served in its own disposable foil ramekin.  Tasty.  Especially with a little hot BBQ sauce added.  Yum.  Chicken (white meat) was remarkably not dried out, but not super juicy either -- Hubs said the dark meat was better.  Ribs were not fall-off-the-bone tender, but had a good taste for a dry rub.  Didn't really even need sauce for these.The down sides for me: first off -- the slaw.  It was simple -- just big long chunks of grated green cabbage and grated red onion...but that's it.  Luckily I could navigate around the chunks of onion (so my husband could bear to spend the rest of the day with me) and the dressing they used actually ended up saving the day...otherwise this would have been a total miss in my opinion.  Secondly, I wanted the brisket chili to be so.much.more. than it was.  The hub's pulled brisket was tasty, so I hoped the chili would be too.  Sad Panda.Let me say this -- if the hubs was writing this review, it would have been given 10+ stars.  He LOVED this place.  I *liked* it  and can see going back to try some other offerings.  Perhaps the hype and my expectations were too high... or I just regret not getting the Bread Pudding with Bourbon sauce.  Either way, we may give it another shot in the future -- but there are just SO many options in Chicago."
"Looking for some good BBQ in the Chicago area? This is definitely the place. Looking for a nice dining experience? Do yourself a favor and order take out here. First of all, I truly don't understand BYOB in establishments with the type of business Smoque does. The line through the dining area is ridiculous as well. After all the wait you get to sit in an overcrowded dining room. I ordered the baby back ribs with all the meat sides. It was all delicious. Almost made me forget that I had to practically rub elbows with the guy next to me."
We ordered the full rack of St. Louis rack with Mac and cheese  and fries as the the side. Also the bbq gumbo and sliced beef brisket sandwich. All delicious! Definitely will come back again.
I must this place is pretty good! I wish the expand more because this venue is so small to serve all the hungry customers that want to check this place out or come back for some more. The wait is really long but worth the try. I waited 30 min for a table when I was hungry maybe I should have been warned to come in before I start getting super hungry. Everything was good and I will definitely come back for some more!
Went here based on reviews.  Overrated but good.  Ill start with the worst thing.   The baked beans taste like you swallowed a campfire.  They were unedible.  They have a soda fountain way in the corner that we didn't see.  When I asked what they had to drink they pointed to this case filled with 12oz. sodas that were over almost $4 after tax.  We went there at 6pm so not late to avoid dried out bbq.  So I ordered the brisket.  Dry as a bone.  Glad I had the sauce to dip it in.  The mac and cheese was awesome but about as much as an ice cream scoop and they charge $2.95 a la carte for it.  The service was great except the counter worker forgot a side on both of our orders.  I wonder how many people realize they are missing a side with how busy it is.  Ill go again but I'll try the ribs since they looked great.
"My boyfriend and I heard about the restaurant from reading a Buzzfeed article about things to do while visiting Chicago. Out of all the places we ate during our trip,  the food here was definitely the most memorable. It was over a hour away from where we were staying but there were no regrets. Between the two of us we tried the baby back ribs, brisket, pulled pork, slaw, macaroni, beans, fries, cornbread muffin, and pecan bread pudding. The ribs appeared to look burnt but I kid you not the meat literally fell off of the bone and there was absolutely no burnt charcoal taste. The brisket was tender and delicious. The pull pork was full of flavor yet didn't have any big gross chunks of fat.The slaw comes with each meal, it wasn't anything special but it wasn't awful by any means. The fries were done nicely and the cornbread tasted like cornbread. The real good sides was definitely the macaroni and the beans. The macaroni was covered in bread crumb crust and baked perfectly. The sauce was creamy and cheesey as it should. The beans were covered in a sweeter bbq sauce and cooked to perfection.  Last but not least the pecan bread pudding was an absolutely must! Neither of us typically like bread pudding but it was cheap and we decided it was worth the try. It had a sweet burbon caramel sauce and covered in candied pecans. The pudding itself had a more cake texture which I really enjoyed. Despite being stuffed, we spent time really debating buying more to go.Overall, the experience was great. The atmosphere was really comfortable and the restaurant had a lot of character and life to it. The service was great despite it being extremely busy. Definitely not the place to go if you want fine dining because it's more of a cross between fast food and dining. Really cannot emphasize how great the food was."
"Very very good barbecue!!! the brisket is just amazing! moist, crispy outside. the best part of this place is that the food is lean!!! the plate stays clean, not full of oul and still the meat is tender. plus, the cole slaw is perhaps the best I ever had. Ribs are good but nothing crazy. And they give you plenty of gooood fries!!!"
There's nothing special about the barbeque. We waited longer to actually place our order than to be seated or get our food. For the price we paid I expected a better atmosphere. Even being served water at the table would have made the visit better. The staff was nice but it doesn't make up for mediocre bbq and a bland atmosphere.
"My friends and I wanted to go to this because of all the reviews, and the place lived up to the expectations. Just a quick caution, it's not a sit down restaurant and the line was kinda long but the food was just awesome!!!"
"I am a BBQ person.  I'm always looking to find places outside of TX that are doing it right.  I heard Smoque was one of those places.Tried the 3 meat sampler.  While at the counter I was distracted when I was told I was given some extra meat for free and didn't catch one of the gals who sauced my plate.  I couldn't be mad though, I mean free meat and all...Brisket - great bark and flavor, fat was rendered perfect.  It's rare to find brisket like this out of TX, nice job.Ribs- it's hard for me to judge them with the sauce.  They weren't sliced to that made it a little messier but overall they were good.  Not overdone either.  Great flavor.Pulled pork - I have to admit I was pretty full by the time I got here.  It was good but nothing stood out for me.Would definitely go back.  4.5 rounded up."
"Yes! This place is excellent! Service is quick even when busy. Not a lot of seating. This is byob with no problems! A bit pricey but the food quality matches the prices!!! Everything is good here. We had the ribs, pork, and brisket. My mouth is watering just writing this review. Thank you smoque!!!"
I rarely almost never give a 5 so you have to know this place was good.  After the wait it's all downhill.  Yes I arrived and the line was out the door on an 85 degree day.  The service was good.  The atmosphere is casual barbecue like.  And the food is off the chain good.  The hot food is hot and the cool/cold food is cool/cold.  The cole slaw has a light non mayonnaise dressing so that you can actually taste the slaw.  The ribs come bare and piping hot cooked to perfection with a side of barbecue sauce for those who needs.  I ate them both ways and the ribs were good.  They had a slight smoked flavor but they were tender and flavorful without overpowering the meet.I can't wait to get back to this restaurant and I am not even a barbecue person.  This place was great.  And I say that even after the wait and driving to get to this spot.  Worth it all.
"Nothing says promising quite like a large framed picture of Guy Fieri on the wall (....sike).Luckily what Smoque does get right is their meats. The brisket is phenomenal, maybe even the best sliced brisket I've ever had. It was incredibly tender, almost feeling unnaturally soft as I poked my fork into it. The ribs probably appeal most to those that don't eat their barbecue with a preference. I'm no barbecue connoisseur, but cooking the meat with a dry rub seems to make the meat a little tougher than what I'm used to down in Southern California. It still packs in a lot of flavor, but I prefer my ribs a little more tender.The sides are honestly mediocre to ""pretty good"" at best. The mac and cheese/the fries that I stole from a buddy were probably the top contenders. The brisket chili and coleslaw were kind of a letdown; the coleslaw being almost bland and the brisket chili not bringing anything new to the table.This place gets packed in waves, so hopefully you don't get swept in with the crowd. Definitely add on the brisket for an extra $5, you'll be glad you did."
"* SMOQUE BBQ *An excellent BBQ spot that I first saw on Diners,Drive-In's & Dives.Everything is made from scratch, quality ingredients.I had cornbread, Mac-n-cheese,BBQ brisket beans,brisket chili & BRISKET( a deep and rich smoke flavored brisket that is moist and tender )You can order it in a platter or as a sandwich.My friends ordered the RIBS & Turkey ( stole a bite of each )OUTSTANDING!!!"
"We went for father's day. This place has 5 star Service and more importantly 5 star food. I got the half and half dinner. Sandwich and half slab rib. The sandwich  I was able to get half pulled pork and half brisket. The pulled pork was absolutely  spot on! Did not need the extra  bbq sauce given, this can stand on it's own feet. The brisket was very good. It was soft and cooked right. The ribs...wow. done right. Soft inside a little  crispy outside. Absolutely solid! The cornbread was made like mom made. My kids through down the mac n cheese. The brisket Chile was good.  Not the best item on the menu when the meat courses are superior. I would recommend like a cinnamon apple sauce or cinnamon apple mix. The service have to say is pressive. The guys helping on the floor will assist and take care of you. Just ask nicely  and they will get it for you. I have to say it may not look like much. But this place is a neighborhood gem. We will absolutely be back for more. Next time, not a weekend or evening. It was packed. But one of the most worth the waits I will have to say!"
"If you are looking for a casual, laid back atmosphere with expertise cooking you the best barbecue as close as it get to anywhere in the country's best barbecue then Smoque hits the spot. These guys are so good they were on Diners Drive in and Dives, they quit their comfy corporate jobs and hit the road eating the best barbecue around the country and once they got back home they add their own flavors to the best in St. Louis, Texas and the Carolinas. I'm pretty much a fan of all their dishes but what i love the most is the Cole Slaw and Baked Beans with a Brisket Sandwich. Stick a fork in me, I'm done!"
"Had some Smoque today.  Have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I think I am almost ready for a let down when eating brisket outside of Texas. This time that let down wasn't that big, almost none existent. Let's start with the brisket. Taste really good.  Bark pretty good.  Smoke ring really couldn't tell the was much of one.  Texture of the meat wad lacking a little bit as well as the color.  Perusal this was really good tasting brisket.  Some of the best I have had outside of Texas.  That is saying a lot coming from a bbq snob like myself. Next up ribs.  St. Louis style. Good taste,  good smoke ring.  Just a little tough to get from the bone.  Might have came off the smoke to early.  Sausage was good but it's shipped from Texas not made in house. Sides,  liked the brisket chili and the bbq beans.  The beans were a little different from the usual but we're good.  The slaw I will pass as i didn't enjoy.Lastly the sauce.  They have two both were good.  I actaully enjoyed the vinegar based sauce. Which is not the norm for me. But this que doesn't really need the sauce.  Which in my opinion is the best compliment you can give a pitmaster.  This is a definite recommended stop if you love bbq. And if I am correct might even fit in to the bottom end of my top ten."
"Ok, so this place is almost at 3,000 reviews and it's averaged 4.5 stars. You are CRAZY if you don't try this place. It's not as conveniently in downtown but if you have time or you just happen to be on the Blue Line going to or from O'Hare Airport, I DEFINITELY recommend you make a stop. It's a really short walk from the Irving Park station. Came here on Tuesday night and was lucky that there was hardly any people in line. The guys attending the dining room area were super friendly. Great customer service. I wish I wasn't by myself so I could have tried everything. Had the opportunity to try the Mac & Cheese, Sliced Brisket, Pulled Pork, Corn Bread and Slaw. SERIOUSLY! SOME OF THE BEST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD! And no shame, but I even enjoyed my cold leftovers in my hotel room lol I recommend everything. I wish I could have tried the ribs and cobbler. The BBQ sauces were so delish. They give you two types. This place is everything you imagined would be for the best hole in the wall place you've ever been to is. You gotta try it!"
"We went to Smoque on a Saturday night for dinner with KT and BS.  The place was very busy is not really set up to handle their fame.  Their system works well in that a host gets your order number and when a table comes available he seats you and puts your order in.  This works, but in the meantime you really have no place to wait.  You end up standing in awkward places between tables and in what aisles there are.  We did have a fairly long wait, although it may have just seemed that way.  I think I would try another night of the week, but who knows, it may be the same.To sample, I ordered a chopped brisket sandwich and for Ms T I ordered pulled pork.  I also got a half slab of back ribs and some slaw.  KT and BS had a rack of ribs with mac and cheese and slaw.The ribs were probably 3-1/2 stars.  Pretty good flavor and a nice rub.  They were not intensely smoky although they are very dark.  This is how dark my ribs at home looked when I did not realize how hot my smoker was running.  I have since fixed that problem.  I suspect they are smoking all of their meat too hot because it is all really black but not exceptionally smoky.  The ribs on this occasion also were a little overdone.  You can see a lot of white bone in the photos that you should not see.  I'm sure there is day to day and rack to rack variability but this kept my appraisal short of four stars or better.  Certainly they are worth trying again.I ordered chopped brisket in self-defense.  Lately when ordering brisket outside of Texas, it has been underdone and you can't eat it on a sandwich without pulling it all off with the first bite.  So chopped was my choice to pre-empt this experience.  I appreciate that they offer this choice.  I suspect they provide the chopped option as a way to use the ends and pieces that don't make nice slices.  That is not a bad thing, you get a lot of outside meat and consequently a lot of smoke and bark flavor.  This was a good sandwich, much larger than I wanted.  Because the bun is too large and bready, I just ate unsauced meat off the bun. Ms T had pulled pork on her sandwich.  She prefers to eat her barbecue with sauce.  Simply put, you do not want to eat Smoque's sauce.  Neither the spicy nor the mild were worth bothering with.  So she did not enjoy eating the pork.  She felt it was not very smoky and without sauce, well..... live by the sauce, die by the sauce.  KT and BS were given a free sample of both sliced and chopped brisket because the nice guy preparing their order thought they should have some with their rack.  He unfortunately put sauce on the sliced portion, so it was hard for me to really evaluate the sliced brisket for flavor.  It was moist, good bark, not as smoky as it looks.  I would say above average for the Midwest.  Just don't let them sauce anything for you, but that is my policy anyway, regardless of the place and the sauce.The sausage was OK.  It was almost more like a Polish sausage than what I associate with barbecue.  It had more garlic, was denser in texture and was not smoked a lot.  I can't help but compare it to what I have had in Texas.Sides were indifferent.  We did not touch the slaw due to the significant dose of red onion.  We would not have ordered it if we had known.  I am the only one who liked the baked, thick style mac and cheese.  I prefer this to the Kraft Velveeta kind.  This was made with actual cheese, so consequently it was a little grainy.  That happens.  I also liked the corn bread.  It was pretty sweet with some sweet corn kernals.All in all I am having a difficult time rating Smoque.  It is definitely a ""thing"" and overrated by barbecue starved Chicagoans, but that does not make it bad.  Ms T would not return while I would, but hopefully on a night with no significant wait.  I would try ribs again and see if over cooking is systematic.  I would order chopped brisket as a platter.  I don't know what sides I would get.  It breaks my heart to not be able to get onion free slaw.  OK, I made up my mind, the slaw tipped the balance to three stars.  I really would go 3-1/2 if I could."
"Smoque is so tasty! I always get the chicken platter with beans and corn bread. The beans are get an A+. The cornbread gets an A- (its very good, but not the best I've ever had)The chicken gets an A+++ though! So juice and tasty. I don't even put any sauce on it! It does get very crowded though so be prepared to wait or take it to go on a busy night! Its also byob so grab a 6 pack and enjoy the deliciousness"
All I have to say is brisket and bread pudding omg food coma and there Mac and cheese its little for a reason very rich
"I had the half brisket sandwich, a quarter slab of the St. Louis ribs, and baked beans. I love that they give you two kinds of BBQ sauce. The brisket had delicious bark on it though the meat was a tad dry. The ribs were simply heavenly. My friend ordered several sides and they were all yummy; the peach cobbler was great. I would definitely come back if I visit Chicago again."
"I went here based on them being on Triple D. They did not disappoint! The process is pretty different than other restaurants, well at least in LA. First, order and pay at the counter, next a waiter has a table ready for your party. It was pretty crowded, but after ordering, I didn't wait at all for a table. The food was only a few minutes.I had the sliced Brisket platter with two sides, Mac and Cheese and Fries. The lady at the counter said those were the two most popular. I also had the bread pudding. The Brisket was divine. It was good with the thinner of the two BBQ sauces. Although, mind not to use too much. The meat needs to carry the flavor. The Mac and cheese was really good with a nice crust on top. The fries were not bad. Perhaps because I had so much food they didn't stand out. The slaw was good, but I could eat much of it because I wanted to save room for the Bread Pudding. It was more bread than pudding, but it was incredible! This is a must try. They are strictly BYOB. Something I haven't seen before, being from California. I don't think you can do that there.Overall, this place shouldn't be missed, you know if Guy likes it, it's gotta be good!"
"Ehh. I don't know what all the fuss it about. I thought the food, flavor wise was mediocre. here are the items I tried:Ribs (I asked for saint louis, they served baby back. I found them to be under seasoned)chicken (remarkably tender, but lacking in salt)brisket chill (pretty good)Spicy and regular bbq sauce (neither one of them were particularly good)French Fries (DELICIOUS)Mac & Cheese (ehh)Corn Bread (I would put my money on this being a jazzed up off brand jiffy)Peach Cobbler (topping good, peaches, however, were not good AT ALL)Slaw (GOOD. the vinegar sauce was great to cut the fattiness of the ribs)I won't go out of my way to go back, however if someone caters them for an event I wouldn't necessarily avoid."
"This is our go-to BBQ joint. There is no other. Since it's BYOB, my husband and I stopped at a liquor store on the way. I ran in and picked up a 6 pack of beer and a nice Mexican guy came up to me and asked me if he could buy it for me...after this moral dilemma, we were on our way to Smoque. So excited. So very very hungry. We got here on a weeknight a little after 6pm and were prepared to wait in line until we had experienced many emotions ranging from excitement, to indifference, to frustration, to near starvation, to murderous rage, satisfaction, forgiveness, and everything in between, but we only had to wait a whopping 5 minutes before placing our order. I love that the menu is written on a chalkboard so you can decide what you want while you wait in line. We both got the brisket platter with the BBQ beans, fries,  and mac n' cheese. Both of our meals came with a side of cole slaw. Can I just talk about the mac n' cheese for a sec, because that mac n' cheese is so damn good I just want to roll around naked in it and now they offer a large size which makes me so happy because inside my soul, I'm just a fat kid. We sat and proceeded to devour our meal like rabid hyenas. I couldn't finish my platter so my husband took over. He had a hard time finishing as well. The brisket was so tender, so juicy, so succulent, so sexy! We sat there drinking the last of our beer while he stood, raised his beer and declared Smoque, the best brisket in Chicago. I stood and concurred. Everyone cheered and clapped. In one swift movement, he swooped me up into his arms and  we exited and walked down Pulaski with BBQ sauce on our faces. The wait time totally depends. Sometimes we've gone there and waited only 5 minutes. Sometimes we've waited 20 and it can feel like a mosh pit in there and everywhere you stand, you're always in someone else's way. They seem to have their own system down to make the line move as fast and smoothly as possible and it appears to be working well for them. They don't have the proper license so you can't BYOB and sit outside"
"Very unassuming as you drive by, except perhaps for the line out the door and down the street of people waiting for delicious BBQ.  Excellent comfort food, with the sides just as tasty as the main dishes."
"I am officially obsessed with this place. It's crowded on weekends, but not on weekdays! Weekday afternoons are definitely the best time to go if you want no lines and no waiting. I also must say that the lines during the busy times look long, but the wait time is never really that bad (and the food is DEFINITELY worth the wait!). Helpful hosts/bussers clear you a table while you wait in line to order, and once you've placed your order you'll have a place to sit (usually, depending on how busy it is). All of the food is amazing but the Mac and cheese is amazing x 100000. It's just so great there are no words that can accurately describe its greatness. Also, I know it sounds basic, but the french fries are also awesome and perfect. There is free parking in the back after 5:30. It's cool that they give you sauces from different types of bbq (Memphis, Carolina, etc.). If you haven't been here, you really HAVE to go, they definitely have the best bbq in Chicago hands down."
"I'm not big on barbeque, but this place was great. I had the pulled pork sandwich, the corn bread, the mac 'n' cheese and the peach cobbler. it was fantastic! I was surprised at how quickly the place filled up. a line started to wrap around the outer exterior of the restaurant. if you've made plans to eat at Smoque and are anticipating yourself being hungry in an hour, I would suggest leaving for the restaurant then because there is a bit of a wait and after the wait you'll be famished."
"So we got here around 730 on a Friday and there was already a line out the door, though it did move fairly quickly I think or maybe not I'm not sure I was a little faint with hunger. Unfortunately right when we got to the front of the line we were notified that they were out of brisket... Womp womp. So instead I got the rib combo which was one rack of the baby back and one rack of the St. Louis. I got the side of fries and a side of the brisket chili and a side of slaw. The ribs overalls were pretty good though I preferred the St. Louis ribs a lot more than the baby backs. The fries were pretty solid but the chili was just kinda meh. The slaw was really good though, not mayo based which I prefer and the vinegary kick was a good contrast to the pork. Definitely coming back here again and earlier to get the brisket next time and maybe a little bit of the St. Louis ribs."
Amazing fall off the bone BBQ!!!In Chicago for the weekend and heard about this place from the locals and it truly lived up to the hype.  Love that it is a local mom and pop neighborhood restaurant with great service and food.  I had the 1/2 baby back 1/2 st Luis rib combo and it was great!  Highly recommend!
Amazing! Pulled pork was great and the service was even better. My friend and I had never had brisket before and we asked  one of the employees what it was; he brought us a whole small cup full to sample while we were waiting. Nice atmosphere too- small place but they keep everything organized. Def recommend if you are looking for some good BBQ!
"Very good local BBQ. Not quite where you'd expect to find highly acceptable smoked meats, but here we are!I had the Texas links and St. Louis ribs. Links were just slightly tough to cut into with plastic cutlery, but excellent and reasonably lean. The St. Louis ribs had an almost cinnamon like flavor with the dry rub. I also tried the chopped brisket and pulled pork--I think I'll try those next time...Each meal is served with a side of Cole slaw, which I found only average. It was vinegar based but practically tasted like simply vinegar and cabbage. It was fresh tasting however. The corn bread is great, so was the Mac and cheese. For dessert, the bread pudding was top notch. My wife had the peach cobbler which was good, but mine was better. Places like this scream for a cold beer, but alas none available. This is a demerit. Signs posted outside on the patio (where we ate) stated no liquor allowed, which surprised me as I thought I read the place was BYOB. Still--free soda/tea refills. I'd definitely come back for the good food."
"I live close by and have seen all the brouhaha that goes on outside, so I've saved off several years before attempting. I went last night on a Saturday night, and although there was a line it was not as serious as summers past. I don't eat pork so I can't speak to the whole menu. I ordered chopped Brisket wish was good but a bit on the dry side, I find that all BBQ that I've  had is well....dry, but this was better than most. I find the sauces and beans are WAYYYY too sweet for my taste. the one thing I enjoyed the most (although sweet) was these free containers of sweet pickled Jalapeño peppers YUM! All in all It's o.k."
"With nearly 3000 reviews this won't matter much but, I'm a fan.  The food is good, the atmosphere is bustling and the staff is nice.  What more could one want?  Ooh yeah, parking.Parking is a real problem.  We got orders to go having to park semi-legally a couple of blocks away.  If dining in, boy, be prepared to walk unless you happen to get very very lucky and get a space in their very small lot.My recommendation is to go with another licensed driver and have them drop you off and drive around until you exit with the take-away.  It's worth it.BTW, it's not Angelo's (Ft. Worth, TX) but then again, where is?"
Pros: Pulled pork melted in my mouth. Cons: N / AFinal Verdict: Highly Recommend
"Yummm. All I have to say. You walk in and it's a bit small but packed and the turnover is perfect. People leave people sit. Now to the food...The menu is small, but everything is tasty. I ordered a half slab of the baby back ribs and a half pound of brisket. They came with a side of cole slaw, Mac and cheese and brisket chilli. The ribs were fantastic, juicy and smoked just perfect plus they fell right off the bone. The brisket...amazing. 5 stars alone! The sides on the other hand nothing to write home about for such a delicious menu. The sauces are wonderful. I recommend the spicy Memphis."
"We arrived at Smoque shortly before the dinner rush, which, trust me, get there before 5.30-6 or pay for it with smelling the BBQ and having to wait. Lets start with the ordering process, which is a bit new and was confusing for some. You look at the chalk board when you walk in, and once you have your mind made up, hit the counter up and order things. You take up residence inside at a table or on the patio and wait for your number. Waited for about 10 minutes for our order... half a slab of baby back, chopped brisket sammy, baked beans, mac-n-cheese, corn muffin, slaw and bread pudding.Hearing your number called... Its like winning the lottery. Tears fill your eyes as you hit the pick up window and as you hit your seat, your tears of joy turn to tears for the dead pig you're about to destroy.The ribs are good without sauce, but with their house bbq... dear, sweet baby jesus... they could cure world peace issues. Lets just put it that way. They have amazing chew, are lean, and pull from the bone perfectly. It's not melt away pull from the bone, but it gives you that gnaw needed to strip the bone and that's amazing.Brisket... oh brisket... more. Need more brisket. Damn sitting not at Smoque and thinking of the brisket. The PERFECT brisket. It melts into the bun, and melts in your mouth. Such amazing flavor all around from the bit of flour baked goodness of the bun to the salty/sweet/briskety flavor of the meat and smoke. I almost cried when the sandwich was gone. Sides... corn bread was amazing. Mac-N-Cheese is killer, slaw was not bad (I've had better), beans were killer - and even better when you put some of that BBQ in with them.And.... the bread pudding. Order this, it may be the best bread pudding you EVER have. No joking that you'd get it here, it's absolutely fantastic. I will forever be in debted to Smoque for this amazing experience of BBQ."
"Not that this place needs another review with it's 2000+ reviews but what the heck. Here's my two cents anyways. After reading several reviews, I was prepared for a long line and wait. And while I didn't relish the idea of waiting outside on the street in Chicago in January, for good BBQ it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. Turned out I had nothing to worry about. We walked in placed our order and than were sat almost immediately. About 15 minutes later, a line formed but even then people didn't seem to have an issue waiting a few minutes for a spot. Food wise, I ordered the chopped brisket platter with the Mac and cheese and baked beans for my sides. Mac and cheese, amazing! Loved the toasted bread crumbs on top and it was the perfect balance of creamy cheese with noodles. From reviews I knew their baked beans were cooked in the smoker and I enjoyed the smokey flavor the beans had. The slaw was good. I usually prefer a creamy slaw but the vinegar based slaw was a perfect compliment to the meal. The chopped brisket was great. I'm a fan of the Tennessee BBQ sauce and once I put some of that on the brisket, I was in heaven. I'm sure I'll have to wait for a spot the next time I come here but I know it's worth the wait."
"Smoque!!! SOOOOO good in every way! We've only been here a couple times but each time we've been here it's been beyond amazing for our family. Owner has always come by to talk to us, which I greatly appreciate! I always get the sliced brisket with 2 sides. I love their regular and vegan dipping sauce! Everything is good! Like meat falling off of the bone good! Like...you just had a rough day and need some good ole comfort food and Smoque's is what will hit the spot good!"
Really good barbecue and sides. What more could you want?
"4 words...The Best Brisket Ever.  I think all the 5 star cazillion reviews here are a testament to how popular, authentic & delicious Smoque BBQ is, so I will try to keep this simple.  I have been here twice.  This place is small, and with its growing fan base I imagine at some point they will relocate to a larger space.  They have limited parking behind the restaurant and luckily we found a spot!The best brisket I have had anywhere period.  Sliced or chopped, it has the right amount of smokiness, fat, and is the most tender brisket I have ever had.  Yes, it does melt in your mouth and leave you wanting more.  First time here came with a group of 7 and we must have been very lucky arriving on a weekend around 5pm with a short line.  Line was pretty fast paced and yes you do have to scope out a table when walking in, however I was really impressed with the staff assisting us in landing a table & making sure we were taken care of.  This place gets busy, busy, busy...you come, you stuff your face and you leave.  If you think Q's has great brisket, try it here.Everyone tried the brisket, pulled pork, baby backs, St. Louis ribs, chicken, mac & cheese and cornbread for sides.  We did not try the Texas sausage. You can also 'add a taste' for $4-$6.00 which is great for sampling.  Chicken was juicy and moist, DELISH - Brisket came in as the winner, runner up's:  pulled pork & St. Louis ribs.  Although these were not fall of the bone ribs, they were tasty & meaty, but I wanted them to be more tender.  The spice rub is not overpowering, the meat is not 'overly smoky'.  Love the rub and you could go without any sauce.  Pulled pork was tender & tasty.  Sides were great as well, but you come here for the BBQ.Sauces?  not my favorite, too sweet for my taste, I prefer more vinegar.  We asked about the different sauces they had and someone in the kitchen mentioned they use Coca Cola.  I could actually taste it in the sauce.  May contribute to why the sauce is on the sweeter side.  Either way, the BBQ here is one of the best in Chicago, these guys know BBQ.  It's worth the trip."
"I think this is my favorite for BBQ in the city. I haven't been to every top joint in the city, but it does really well for Chicago. I have had pretty much everything except for the chicken here.Pulled pork: 9/10 Extremely tasty and not dried out like most pulled porks can be.Brisket: 8/10 Very smokey and a great crust, I just expect a little more from it.Ribs: 9.5/10 Not the best I have every had, but these are my favorite on the menuMac N Cheese is quite good, the corn bread is outstanding. The coleslaw is really tasty and the fries are good as well.Overall I really like this place and the prices arent bad.BYOB and the wait is never too long."
"What can I say that I haven't said before... Counter workers are A+, brisket was awesome and the Texas sausage is my new fav. Brisket chili tasted fresher and bolder ... I liked thatWin win every time I come"
"I was bitchin' & moanin when friends suggested we check this out. But it turned out to be great! We had the St. Louis ribs, pulled pork & of course the famous sliced brisket. Everything was so tender and flavorful and moist! No wonder it has thousands of stellar reviews. Well-deserved!"
"I don't think I need to actually make a review here but here I go:AMAZING BBQ! Great main dishes awesome sides. Great all around. There is a reason they have won awards and are often rated best in Chicago. I guess the only down sides are it does get busy (because it's good), sometimes it's hard to get a seat (because it""s good and small) and its a bit pricy (you know, because it's good)."
"Smoque is always delicious! I have been coming in every so often (when the line isn't out the door) since they first opened and over the years I have never had a bad meal. The meats are always soooo good! The Mac and cheese is my favorite ever and I always wish I could order a big tray of it lol I also love the peach cobbler and bread pudding, yum!"
OMG the ribs were amazing.  The wait was long but soooo worth it.  I will definitely be back.  I can't remember what sides I had but everything was great.
"There is absolutely no question in my mind of why the line is consistently out the door here. Their ribs are amazing, their brisket makes me drool a little bit just thinking about it, and their Memphis BBQ sauce is excellent. Trust me - it's worth the line. You might even get lucky and they'll have their pecan bread pudding for dessert."
"Well, this place is clearly not a secret. At 5:30 pm on a Saturday night there was a line to the door waiting to order. That gives you time to peruse the big menu board: all the usual suspects, essentially.We were patient and finally made it to the front; meanwhile, an alert young man (the host, basically) was darting around determining the number of people in everyone's party and figuring out where they'd fit based on table availability. That's one game of Tetris I wouldn't care to play, and I'm sure at some point it involves a bit of ""eat and get out"" prodding. Actually it didn't take us long to eat because you want to scarf down these goodies. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with one side (mac and cheese) and a ""taste"" of Texas sausage, plus the complimentary cole slaw. The juicy, succulent pork arrived atop a forgettable soft roll, with a choice of Memphis (sweet) or Carolina (vinegar) sauces in small cups. The mac and cheese was tasty but lost warmth very quickly, clotting into an unattractive clump (the warming trays where everything is arranged must not be keeping up). The side of cole slaw was an unexpected delight: a sprightly but not overly punchy vinaigrette bathed the strands of cabbage and onions. The one disappointment was the sausage: a thick, tough casing held a disappointingly mild meat with a really bland texture. This ""taste"" was a waste of $4, unfortunately. This is not particularly cheap BBQ, but it is decent-sized portions. My friend got the platter (two sides, one meat -- in her case, brisket, beans and fries) and it was definitely plenty for two meals, unless you are a very hearty eater. Lots of street parking up the block with no meters! That's something nice in Chicago...Overall, this was an enjoyable meal, and now I'm apparently part of ""those in the know"" ;) So if you're looking for some BBQ, get in line and soak in the Smoque."
"So pleasantly surprised to find such a good BBQ establishment in my neighborhood. Came on a Thursday evening and the line was pretty much out the door. The wait for the table was decent but just watching the food come out and people feasting made it seem longer than normal. I ordered some plate combo thingy, I chose a half slicked brisket sandwich with the St. Louis style ribs, mac n cheese and cole slaw. Not too long after we were seated, our food came out and boy did it look tasty. Went of the sandwich first. Brisket was tasty and juicy, nice smokey flavor with a good spice rub. The sauce was tangy and delicious. Scarfed it all down and moved onto the ribs. The ribs fell apart as I touched them, came right off the bone. You could see a good smoke ring and the spices formed a really nice crust on the outside. Juicy, tender and flavorful. Mac n cheese wasn't very special. Good but not life changing. Cole slaw was really good though. Seemed to have less mayo than normal and more of a vinegary tang. Very lively and energetic atmosphere. The next time I come I'll probably stick to some slicked brisket and a full rack of St. Louis ribs. YUM can't wait for my next visit."
"With all of the wonderful food choices in Chicago we're severely lacking in barbeque, so Smoque was a wonderful surprise. Tender, flavorful ribs and brisket to die for. (I prefer sliced over chopped.) The pulled pork is delicious as well, even without sauce. They have good sides and sandwiches too. My family likes this place a lot. It's on the north side of the city and definitely worth it."
"The best BBQ! The meat is so tender. You can really enjoy it without even putting any BBQ sauce. The sliced brisket is soft and melts in your mouth. The chili brisket is a good side and the mac & cheese are OK.If it were my first time there, I would order half slab and a brisket platter.They also have 3 types of BBQ sauce, the Spicy Memphis is my favorite.I heard they buy the meat directly from up north cattle farms..."
"Fall-off-the-bone ribs with a great rub.  mushy gross mac and cheese.  Friend's brisket was good and other friend's pulled port was just ok.  I'd say that their rub and char are the good parts, so get the ribs if you go here.  I was put off by the Soup Nazi atmosphere.  As you walk up, you're greeted by a large sign indicating ""the rules"".  No alcohol.  No self seating. No x y z.  And then the staff boss you around regarding where to stand and close the door and etc.  By the time we got through the hour long line to order, I was thinking these had better be the world's best ribs to justify this behavior.  The verdict:  probably not delicious enough to go back and be bossed around again."
Best BBQ Brisket in town! Get it sliced! Come early or else you'll be stuck in the line. Get the platter with two side. Peach Cobbler And corn bread are really good! Take a bottle of their sweet and spicy BBQ sauces home!You must come here!!!!
"Decidedly mediocre.  After reading so many reviews that were over the top positive, i could not help but be disappointed especially when i live 10 minutes away from the BEST BBQ in the state at BLACK DOG in Urbana.If you've been to Smoque and think its the best you've had, do yourself a favor and go to Black Dog and then you will see what i am talking about."
"Ummm.... I'LL HAVE SOME MORE OF YOU PLEASE!!!! =D We decided to FINALLY try this place after my neighbors catered their annual memorial day party from this place. My family ordered the combo ribs, sliced brisket, texas sausage, & our sides were mac & cheese, brisket chili, french fries, cornbread, & peach cobbler for dessert (thanks to our neighbors, we've OD'd on bread pudding)....  Bless me father for I have sinned by cheating the poop out of cheat day.... Oh, we'll be back...."
I only have one gripe but this place.   I wish they had greens. The whole part about Smoque is that is BYOB. The BBQ here is pretty good.  The prices are incredibly reasonable and you can escape only paying about $15/person.  We ended up trying a little bit of everything with my visit here. -The pulled pork was just but average. Nothing spectacular or work complaining about. -The ribs were tasty. Tender but not facing apart. A nice bite. Excellent dry rub and you don't even need the sauce. -The brisket was melt in your mouth tender and probably one of the best things we had there. -The Mac and cheese was good but slightly to creamy for my taste. -The baked beans were slightly sweet and had a meaty taste throughout. -The chili was one of my favorite sides but could have been a little spicier. Overall it was a pretty good experience and I would go back.
"If you like BBQ, waiting in line and BYOB then this is your spot. I am not that big into BBQ, but my BF loves it so we decided to give it a try. For a Friday night, I expected it to be way more crowded, and luckily it wasnt. We waited the longest on getting sat at a table than we did waiting in line to order. I had the 1/2 chicken with the brisket chili and french fries and my BF had the Kansas City ribs, mac n cheese and beans. He really enjoyed his ribs and thought it was a great portion. I like the vinegar coleslaw that comes with the order as well. All in all it was a good meal - i suppose. Not some place I will come rushing back to."
"Great food very delicious but I think I hyped it up too much in my head. I saw it on the show Dinners, Drive-ins & Dives with Guy & I travelled 12 hrs from Jersey to Chicago & honestly, it was great food but it wasn't the best dish I've ever had. The brisket was a little dry, the smoked beans had a great bbq flavor, the mac & cheese was very good. The coleslaw was different in flavor, it had apple vinegar which threw me off a bit & not in a good way. Potatoes were fresh but they get very stale after an hour or two so I wouldn't recommend taking the food to go."
"Wow! This place is as amazing as everyone says it is! The line was out the door, but don't let that stop you from coming in. We had 6 people and It only took about 15 minutes get to the front of the line, order and have our table ready. We waited about another 10 minutes for our food to be done. The food was amazing, between all of us, I tried; the sliced beef brisket sandwich, ribs, corn bread, baked beans, French fries and the salted Carmel/bourbon pecan bread pudding. Everything was amazing! The Memphis BBQ sauce is the BEST BBQ sauce I've ever had! And the bread pudding, was by far, one of the best desserts I've ever had! The ribs were tender and amazing! It was a bit pricer than I thought, about $35 a couple for sandwiches/sides/drinks. But, totally worth the price and time you'll spend waiting. Take-out was an option too!"
"BLUF:  Good standard BBQ.  Definitely fills the void but I need to try it again.  I would like to go again and not share.  We split the brisket, pork and chicken with a bunch of sides amongst 6 people.  I couldn't be a true pig (pun intended) so i didnt get to really test the place by giving myself a food coma.  It was definitely good.  The sauce on the side was really awesome too; vinegary which is the way i like it. Place is busy and they sell out.  Call ahead when you can.  It is good.  I want to go again to really try it out."
"Worth the wait in my opinion, I'm not a huge bbq eater but I know when the pulled pork is melt in your mouth tender then they're doing something right. Just the right amount of charred bark and meat to make me need to take a nap after eating. Fries are good, but the mac and cheese was bomb. Corn bread is nice and soft and moist. Yep, I used the word moist. My parents had the ribs (each got the different style) and my hubs got the Texas sausage. The beans were smoky and have some heat to them. Overall we were very satisfied even after waiting about an hour and 15 minutes. The people in line made it very entertaining. Wish I would have brought some brews, forgetting that it's a byob joint, but I will definitely come back. If you don't want to wait, I suggest calling ahead and picking up, the line was long even during non-peak hours."
"Good food and really good service. I got the brisket plate with cole slaw and fries. meat was pretty soft and the sauce they give you on the side is good. Service is good cause they had a specific person to tell me which foods i could get with my food allergy. also, we got the food pretty quickly given that the line was out the door when we first got there."
"After a night of binge watching on the Travel channel I needed to have my BBQ! I found Smoque via yelp & made the 30 min trip to the place. Rainy Sunday, yet still busy. We were lucky enough to find street parking or else that could've been a problem. The place is pretty tiny! But we were able to get a 2 seater easily. I had the St. Louis rib w/coleslaw & peach cobbler. Hubby had the brisket with Mac n cheese & baked beans. The stars were def the ribs, baked beans, Mac n cheese, n coleslaw. I don't even like Mac n cheese but I had to grab one to go! Only grip is that I wish they had more sides to choose from because I'm sure they would be great!"
"I have been dying to try this place for few years now. Flew all the way from Arizona and this place didn't disappoint. Everything was amazing and delicious. All I can say is Holly ""Smoque"". If I could give it 10 stars I would."
"Lets get right down to the food.The ribs are really good. They don't look that pretty but their rub has really good flavor. I don't know that I detected a really good smoke flavor but they tasted great and were tender and the meat easily released from the bone. Delicious, I think the best ribs I've had in Chicago of the 4 or so BBQ joints I've tried. My bf also got a side of their Texas sausage. I had a bite, garlic-y and delicious. I would happily eat their sausage as a meal. I don't know how authentic it was compared to Texas sausage, I suspect not much, but still very good.Their staff is also extremely friendly. My bf and I were standing in front of the pick up counter and the cook asked us if we were the order # he was working on, we were indeed. He was surprised we did not order any brisket, he said he would give us some for free to try, which ended up being an entire tray of both their chopped and sliced brisket with sauce, completely free. That's what I call service. The brisket was really good, tender and flavorful. Regulars obviously know how the ordering process works here. For the newbies, here's the deal: You line up to order for dine in, staff ask you how many are in your party and say they will seat you once they are ready with a table. After you order this same staff member will ask you for your order # so he knows what food goes with who. They do not fire your food until their is a table ready for you. It's a small, cramped place but despite it being packed with not a ton of space, the staff is on top of everything and extremely nice. When there are tables clearing out and being cleaned up, they tell the cooks what order #s to fire so you have a table when your food is ready. That does mean that many people who have already ordered and are waiting in a cramped place will have their food on hold until there is a table ready for them. This could make for very long wait times. We got there ""just in time"" on a Saturday night and still had to wait. I wouldn't be surprised if the others waiting while we were eating waited for an hour or more. The place was hoppin. Where they fall short? Their sides and sauces. I didn't like either their regular or spicy sauce very much, and in fact really actually disliked their regular sauce. Their spicy was better on the ribs and the Texas sausage, but not on its own. I would have liked it a bit more sweet. Because of their sauce I would never order their brisket. It was good and tender like I said, but its just sauced meat either on a tray or on a bun. If their sauce was better, I'd be more into it. Their cornbread and mac n cheese, the 2 sides I got with our full slab, are after thoughts. The cornbread is a bit dry and could be more flavorful. The mac n cheese is typical mealy, powdery type mac n cheese that you get at basically every restaurant in America because no one knows how to make creamy mac n cheese apparently. It was better with some salt but nothing to talk about. Their fries are the same kinda soggy fries you can get at any hot dog or italian beef joint in Chicago. DESPITE their sides and sauces not being stellar, their ribs were so good that I can overlook the sides and sauces. I understand why people line up for this place and would definitely come back."
"Great food! The place is smaller than I would've expected, but I didn't care. Parking is extremely limited. The food though is amazing ! The pulled pork is perfect. The Mac and cheese and French fries are great. I tried a little brisket, and it was great! Worthy of being on DDD! So good, and would recommend to any barbecue lover."
"Best ribs in Chicago!! There is always a long line, but worth the wait. Their menu is simplistic and right to the point. The only difficult decision is do you go with the Baby backs or the St. Louis !! The staff are very friendly, I definitely will go there again."
"I first saw this restaurant on Diners, Drive Inns and Dives and had to check it out. Im a huge fan of BBQ so I need to try this place. I had a full slab of the St. Louis, the slaw, cornbread, beans and peach cobbler. The ribs were delicious. A dry rub and the meat is so tender. The sauce was on the side and was also delicious. The slaw was vinegar based, I was a huge fan of it. But if you prefer cream based, maybe not for you.Beans were amazing and had bits of brisket in them.Cobbler and corn bread tasted very fresh. I paid $25 for it all, but it was very worth it. I took what I didn't finish home and was still good."
"This is my favorite BBQ place in Chicago!!! and consequently the only BBQ I will eat that's not my own.The pulled pork sandwich and sliced brisket sandwich are rich, meaty and unctuous.I love the Texas smoked sausage, it has a great snap and wonderful flavor.The St. Louis Ribs are delicious, they don't have as much smoke flavor as the brisket but they  are full of porky goodness.  They are tender but still have a nice chew to them also.The chicken is my least favorite of the meats they serve.  It is cooked well, but it is just not seasoned and finished to my liking.  I would prefer more seasoning and cooking i at a higher temperature.The baked beans are my favorite side, mac and cheese is good, peach cobbler is good, cornbread is ok.  I really do  not like the brisket chili at all, it has good flavor but its just not my thing.  Cole slaw is ok.  Fries are good when fresh, but like any fried food they do not transfer well, so no luck with take out.Great place, you should definitely give them a try if you haven't already. I gave them 5 stars because I've always had a great meal here."
"Pretty decent bbq.  I came here with high expectations, so this review may be a bit unfair.  Tried the Sliced Brisket, St Louis Ribs and Texas Sausage.  Thought the ribs were slighty tough, the brisket was intensely smoky and needed more salt or seasoning in the rub, and was hoping for more of a kick from the Texas Sausage.  It was all good but didn't blow my mind.  I'd choose Green Street Smoked Meats or Twin Anchors for best BBQ in Chicago."
"I'm a mostly vegetarian, but was blown away by Smoque.I bought the Ala Card packet and barely used it. However, Smoque made the entire packet worth it!Delicious to the max!"
We eat at BBQ places all over the Midwest.  The pulled pork meat was tender and flavorful.  The handcut fries were the best part if the meal.  The St. Louis ribs were very tough but had good flavor.  The sides were nothing special.  The sauces could use some work.    The service wasn't very friendly or helpful.  I doubt we will be back.  St. Louis is the only place e to go for good BBQ!
Best ribs in town!  We prefer the baby back ribs as it is more juicy.  Their cole slaw is not like the typical one you find elsewhere. This is light and tangy.  Love it!  Must try there cobbler peach dessert (yummy goodness).
"Unbelievable BBQ!  The best I've ever had.  We had the brisket and St. Lpuis ribs.  They literally fall off bone. The flavor, the service, and hospitality is 5 stars.  We waited 30Minutes but didn't mind. It was worth the wait and the kitchen does a fantastic job too!"
"We came by for a carryout of sliced brisket and ribs.  They now also have some outdoor patio seating (not sure when this came about, but at this point, it hasn't started snowing yet)."
I had to see what all the hype was about and to be honest.. it's just another bbq place. So what happens is... you get there.. wait in line.. order and pay for your food.. and if you want to sit... see the employee in line and he'll seat you as soon as a seat becomes available. I had the bbq brisk and it was good... standard.. it did indeed taste smokey! I also had the cornbread and bbq baked beans... ehh.. I could have done without the cornbread. Their coleslaw is actually quite tasty!! And their infamous peach cobbler was really nothing I would write home about. Overall... good if you're hankering for some meat.. but be sure to stop by during the weekday when it's not too crowded! PS. It's BYOB! So plan ahead!
"This Memphis girl's favorite BBQ joint in town. Everything is good here, except the line out the door at peak times."
The place is chill for the time I was there. The food menu is everything you would expect from a bbq joint so if your not about it then don't act surprised when your ordering a vegetarian wrap. I had one of there burgers with fries and I enjoyed it. they have some decent specials here there.  check it out if your in the area. other than that it's not a totally amazing spot that I would come back to again.
"I used to go on a regular basis, even in winter when the line was out the door! The platters are delicious and are true B-B-Q, having been cooked for some 14+/- hrs.  The sides are delicious, too!My late father lived in Northbrook and always would pitch the concept of opening a 2nd location in Northbrook, but the owners were always resolute in resisting!"
"In our house, all you have to do is say, ""How about Smoque?"" and we are walking to the car. We love this place. I know a lot of BBQ fans are all about the pork, but I am a beef girl. I love the brisket at Smoque--beautiful dark edges, pink smoke line, and a tender, melt-in-your mouth center that is soooo good. Every time I order a sandwich I take off one slice of brisket so I can eat it all by itself last, so that taste will linger long after I am done eating. I can't rate sauce on my brisket because I take it plain. As I said, I am a beef girl. Sides are good, but remember the meat is the star. The cole slaw is dressed with a vinaigrette and is a light counterpoint to the rich smoky meat. The mac and cheese I wish came double sized--it is really good, a little smoky, and made with real cheese. The baked beans are a little too sweet for my taste, but my husband likes them because they are very smoky. We both love the peach cobbler. It has an interesting smoky taste as well, different from an oven baked version. It does make me wish they had ice cream in the menu, so i could put some on top.Now about the pork. The pulled pork is tasty and has a nice caramelized edge which is mixed in with the pulled meat. The sauces are more vinegary than sweet and tomatoey, which is how I like them. I usually don't eat the sweet thick sauces most places serve, but I will have the sharper sauces at Smoque. As for ribs, I prefer the St. Louis ribs because I think that cut has more flavor. These are not parboiled, fall off the bone ribs. These are smoked, gotta-tug-a-little ribs with a good dry rub and not too sweet. Good stuff, but not the sweet saucy stuff served at other places. Chicken is good, not dry, but I prefer beef and pork for BBQ.Parking can be tight on the street, but it's free. We often do take out because the place is crowded most of the time. The line is long, but it moves pretty well. I highly recommend this spot."
"The BBQ was not bad, but certainly didn't live up to the hype this place has. I live around the corner and went twice in 2 years.Coleslaw was terrible, IMO. Not that i'm an expert on coleslaw, but it was easily the worst i've had. Very very dry, no seasoning. Maybe if I had done a burger or something and but the slaw on it with some BBQ it'd be okay but served as a side was not good. Overall, mediocre. Sauces were good but nothing to write home about IMO. There are better places in Chicago. Personally, i'd go to Smalls Smoke Shack over Smoque."
"If I could describe this place in one word it would be ""Brisket"". I tried the St Louis ribs and the brisket plus all the sides. The brisket outshines everything. It is so juicy and tender that it basically falls apart. The ribs were cooked perfectly, but it just didn't compare. I saw a lot of reviews about the meat being too smokey. I do my own smoking at home and I use very little smoke. I felt this was just as smokey as mine. You do taste the smoke but it's certainly not overwhelming. The sides were good, but nothing special. Same goes for the sauces.  I just tasted the sauces on the side. I would recommend this place and I will be back for sure."
"If you haven't been here, but enjoy BBQ, find some time to get here.  The place is small, so coming before or after high traffic periods will benefit you. I had the Brisket Platter with mac n cheese and fries.  The brisket was cooked very well and had great taste and 'smoque'.  The flavors were not overwhelming, I'd even prefer a bit more pepper/rub, but it was balanced and cooked perfectly which outweighs about anything else for me. Also had some pulled pork and it echo'd good pork.  It was also cooked well and pulled perfectly.  The flavor was a little more prevalent with the pork.  The sides with the platters are a bit small, its worth it to buy the sides separately and get the larger portions.  The fries... WOW, they were great. They were crispy and had a hint of something more than just salt on them.  I don't know what it was as I couldn't see it, but they were great. The location was a bit of a hike from where I was coming from, but it was well worth it.  I'll add it to my rotation when I'm in the area!"
"With all of these great ratings, I was expecting a fantastic BBQ experience, but walked away pretty meh about it. The peach cobbler was easily my favorite, the meat was generous, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the sauces and the sides were on the smaller side."
"There's something about their secret BBQ sauce or cooking style that makes everything here so good. I was a little afraid of bringing a vegetarian friend along, but they do have some veggie options. It would be nice to see more though. Their mac & cheese is delicious... And the peach cobbler is to die for, yum. :) I've been going here forever, since it's right around the block from where I live. It never disappoints. So glad they decided to open in Old Irving. I'd like to check out their patio sometime."
Great BBQ! Read many reviews and they all contracted each other haha!Enjoyed brisket and St Louis ribs. Mac and cheese is legit!
I really wanted to give  3 stars. I did 4 out of peer pressure. Smoque is well...smoky....smoky tasting that is. I liked the baked beans but they are too smoky. I wish they had one or two more choices of bbq sauce. The fries are amazing. The peach cobbler tasted like canned peaches with a little granola on top. Not that great. The tables are a tight squeeze. Good if you are into chatting with your neighbors. I'm not. The cole slaw was surprisingly fresh and yummy. The meats were good. The pork is amazing. The bbq sauces are just ok. Lots of hype when they opened. It's good not great. $40 for two for lunch. My husband said he would have rather gone to White Castle. Eek. It wasn't THAT bad! I'd recommend it for sure.
This place is good but I will stick to my pulled pork the rubs just didn't have enough meat for me and weren't falling off the bone  but such good food
"First of all, they have Mikeska's family Bbq sausage from Texas. I grew up on Jerry Mikeska 's since his restaurant was less than a mile away from our house of 16+ years. Secondly, their Brisket is second to NONE as far as BBQ goes in Chicago. Get over there ASAP and don't worry if there is a line out the door, they are super efficient with their service and by the time your food is ready you'll be sitting down. Git it!"
"I've only had their food catered, but the Mac and cheese is pretty amazing as well as the brisket !"
"When someone tells you to stop at this place when you are in the city of Chicago, you won't regret it. Believe them!. The Ribs & Brisket are unfound treasures to your mouth. And let's not forget about their chicken salad. For you health folks which we all try to be : )Only down side to this place I can say is the prices, and the size portions of some of the sides you choose."
"OMG!!!!! GREATEST BBQ EVER!!!!I saw this restaurant on DDD, and thought to myself if I ever go to Chicago I have to go.  Good decision on my part.  This place is so good you can smell the BBQ from about a block away, and as good as it smells it tastes better than that if you can believe it.  My wife and I had the full rack St. Louis style, incredible! As for sides we had the Mac n cheese only great and cole slaw, which I usually hate but I found myself eating the whole side. The owner/manager? Al gave a taste of the brisket with a mild sauce and sweet jalapeño which we wish we would've ordered because it melts I your mouth. This place had me wanting to move  from NYC to Chicago. I might come back just to eat here again!  OMG!!!!"
I eat at this place often and I give 3 stars with a heavy heart. I LOVE BBQ..I do not think I have had anything other than the sides or dessert that I would come back for if it were not close to my buddy 's place. Perhaps the candied jalapeños.meh++.hype train canceled.
"Ah-mazing ribs! I recommend ordering in advance though bc it can get hectic in there. Try the combo with a pop, fries and Macncheese"
First off this isn't the best barbecue in the city.  It gets a lot of hype but its really not.  The pulled pork was ok and the ribs were average and nothing to go bragging about.  The brisket was actually pretty tasty.  Their sides were hit or miss.  The coleslaw tasted too mayo-ey for my taste and the mac n cheese was on the dry side.Overall I'd go back but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice
"So you've heard the hype about Smoque and you're deciding whether or not it's worth the line. Let me help you out...you should already be standing in line deciding what yumminess you'll be partaking in. Are you there yet? Hurry up, you'll likely have a while to wait once you arrive if you're planning on eating there. On the other hand, if you're not there yet, stop and pick up a 6 pack to enjoy with your meal. This spot is BYOB (if you're eating inside)!I'm a HUGE fan of the chopped brisket. I pretty much always order it, unless I'm going for the pulled pork, which is a rare occurrence. If you're getting the platter - which you probably should be - you can get 2 sides and slaw. I'm not a cole slaw person, so I always sub in corn bread - YUMMM - but I've heard the slaw is pretty good. The mac and cheese is my favorite side to add...so much so I may just grab 2 mac and cheeses. Don't judge, now that we live in Seattle we don't get to enjoy this gem nearly often enough, so I've gotta get it when I can! Other delicious options include: the texas sausage and the ribs - you can add a taste of something to your meal for a few bucks so you can have more deliciousness to devour.As much as this place is the bee's knees, the cat's pajamas, and any other variety of animal- or insect-related superlatives meaning a-freakin-mazing, parking can be a pain and the line moves pretty slowly sometimes."
"It's tasty. I only get it to go and bypass the ever present line. The bread pudding and Coleslaw are sleepers on the menu. Having had the whole menu I think everything is a safe choice but feel the chicken is the weakest link. Full slab of St Louis style ribs, a chili,  with 2 extra coleslaw is my standard order."
"Smoque's ribs are the gold standard, as far as I'm concerned. I have, quite literally, never had ribs ANYWHERE as good as these. Incredible."
"Definitely SMOQUED to perfection, too smoked for my liking.. Actually, more like blackened. I was hoping that the meat was going to fall off its bone the moment I bit into it while drenched in sauce.. Darn my imagination. We ordered the Rib Combo, and it was unanimous that the St Louis slab tasted better. However, Phil's BBQ in San Diego, CA is def 65828139271x better! The cornbread was good tho.. lol"
"Items selected:Half and Half Brisket and Pulled Pork SandwichPeach CobblerBread PuddingCornbreadMacaroni and CheeseOpting to take advantage of an automobile for transportation yet not wanting to overdo it before dinner at Boka it was just after 2:30 on a Friday afternoon that my mother, aunt, and I entered Smoque and with the lunch crowd still lingering but several seats open it was only dried out cornbread and an unpleasant 'host' who barked at us that no one could be seated until an order was placed which prevented the visit from being a resounding success.  Located on Pulaski just seconds from the Kennedy Expressway and considered by some to represent Chicago's best barbeque a visit to Smoque is unlikely to be mistaken for anything resembling an 'upscale experience'  and opting to eschew the more fanciful digs of Lillie's or Bub City there is no doubt that the food is the star of the show - a lean blackboard menu, steel trays lined with white paper, and plenty of napkins on wooden tables the only things besides a few pictures decorating otherwise Spartan décor.  Every bit matching the Texas experience with orders placed at the counter and sodas self service it was after only a few minutes of indecision that our tray was presented, the $20 tab a veritable bargain for a large portion of meat along with two sides and a duo of desserts.  Admittedly ordering lightly with a focus on favorites it was first in the brisket that each of us indulged and with a good smoke ring visible on each slice the tender beef shined, a statement slightly less applicable to pulled pork that was just a touch too sweet.  Largely unimpressed by cornbread that was improved only slightly by a pat of butter but happy to find similarly plated macaroni tender amidst rich cheese it was onward to dessert that we moved and although the peach cobbler was admittedly quite good it was for the bread pudding that we'd all fight, a nearly molten slab slathered in creamy caramel with smoky pecans adding just the right bit of crunch."
"Best BBQ in Chicago for me. Smoke Daddy has a cool atmosphere and good beers, Dino BBQ has great ribs, but all-around, Smoque is the best. Pulled pork is just damn good. It's tight and the parking leaves a little to be desired, but once you start eating, it's all over. Phenomenal."
Best rib joint out there. Their baby back ribs have a delicious smokey flavor to them that can't be beat. The smokey flavor on the meat itself is perfect that you don't need to smother it with bbq sauce.
"My favorite food spot when visiting Chicago. This isn't a ritzy place but the food is amazing and probably the best BBQ I've ever had. My boyfriend and I shared the baby back ribs, french fries, cornbread, and coleslaw and we were stuffed with happiness. Their BBQ sauce was on point, and everything truly had a ""smoquey"" flavor. The place was a bit crowded but completely understandable since the meals are amazing. Reasonably priced and totally worth it! I'd hop on a plane just to eat here again."
Oh Jesus Christ I cannot even write this without salivating. The brisket is beyond amazing the pulled pork is perfection the fries super crunchy oh and the corn bread is simply delicious. They are closed on Mondays which I keep forgetting -_- the weekends get crazy packed the longest I've waited was over an hour and 45 min. If you're going to wait that long no worries about trying to find a table they're smart and slow down service so by the time your food is ready there will be a table available. Note: they will seat you don't just sit down wherever you please. To go is a recommend. Oh and it's BYOB. Can't beat that. The bbq is the best I really don't have a negative thing to say about this place.
"BEST SLICED BRISKET and smoked chicken in all of Chicago. Bread pudding is also on point, sweet jalapeños are so tasty, and their coleslaw and Mac n cheese are tasty! Really really well managed, service is quick, and the taste of their food is so scrumptious I could eat here every day! Come here if u want fantastic Bbq- u will leave more than satisfied and will wish you lived around the corner to enjoy their delicious, succulent, perfectly flavored brisket!"
"Food was good. Husband and I each had half and half meals, me with mac & cheese, him with cornbread. Friend had ribs and chicken, pie, fries, a bunch of food. He seemed to enjoy it all. Portions are made to size, its a order and sit type of place, street parking, cute little place.My only compliant, is its Sunday at 11 - they just open, only one other table occupied. We come in, ask do we sit ourselves, ""order and sit, how many in your party""... I tell him were waiting on our friend, which then he says ""cant sit until your entire party is here""... R U SERIOUS. So we all order and sit, still the place is not full, they rush us out - lingering around our table in groups of two removing everything after the guys finish... the sause, the drink, the wrapper from the fries. Total turn off. Good food, however Id rather go somewhere to made like I can relax. Id get it if there was no tables left, but nope its apparently a hurry up and eat and leave type of place."
"This place was so so good. One of the best BBQ places I have been to even in the south. THE BRISKET, OH MY GOSH THE BRISKET, melted in your mouth. I have never had better. Wow. Anyways, what's cool here is if you are an indecisive eater like me here you can have the 1/2 & 1/2 which features half an order of the pulled pork and half an order of the brisket. This also comes with 1 side. I tried the mac 'n cheese which was also heavenly. It was simple yet refined. One of the best m'n'c's that I've had. No fancy schmancy cheeses here but I swear tastes amazing. I also opted to try the cornbread, which was nothing special. I personally prefer my cornbread on the sweeter side. I wish I ordered myself the peach cobbler bc it looked delish, but oh well next time.A few things to note, I wish there were more BBQ sauce options. The meal came with just one. For a BBQ place that's kinda not too legit. Also, I felt a bit rushed when I was eating. The line was long, and the busboys were running around cleaning plates... I guess a better option is to take your yummy food goodness to go so you can eat at your own pace at home. I can't wait to come back."
"I love bbq.I've had all sorts, all over the country.Not only does it stand up as a bbq place, but it is just a good restaurant.It was really busy, just before closing, but oh so good.I've recommended it to others who loved it as well."
"Finally made it to Smoque BBQ after having heard so many praise it as the best BBQ in town; Smoque easily measured up to it's lofty reputation. Enjoying a guys' night out the four of us ordered a large cross section of the menu and dined family style so we could sample everything. All of us were really impressed; the St. Louis Style ribs were possibly the best ribs I have consumed - such exquisite flavor and perfectly cooked. The pulled pork platter and brisket platter were also delicious and even the sides were extremely well executed (the baked beans the the cornbread being my favorites). Portions were fairly generous and pricing quite reasonable - even more so when you factor in the BYOB aspect. While Smoque was bustling even on a weeknight evening the line moved fast, the venue was well organized and food came out at a nice pace. Once you are seated you do not have to stand back in line to order more, but can do so table side. Fantastic experience and will have to make another trek to Smoque BBQ sooner rather than later."
"Maybe it was the long line which raised my expectations or the fact I am just a straight up BBQ snob, but Smoque was very dissapointing.  My wife and I got the ribs with the two sides (she had baby backs and I had St. Louis style) and added the brisket for $5.00.  The presentation looked good and that is where the goodness ended for me.  When you walk in you are greeted with a sign telling you how the process of ordering works and they describe how their ribs are like meat jello which fall off the bone.    Well, my rib meat didn't exactly 'Fall off the bone' and they were some of the driest ribs I have ever put in my mouth. The rub on the ribs was lacking in flavor and could have used a bit more salt.  Also, the smoke flavor on the ribs and brisket was lacking this could be that they are cooking the ribs at a higher temp.  I can usually crush a half slab of ribs pretty easily, but I could only eat half of the half slab.  For the sides, I have one word to describe them, Vinegar.  The slaw you get is like a carolina style with no sweetness at all.  I am a huge fan of slaw, but I could not eat this at all.  The bbq sauces are very runny and lacking in much flavor.  The beans were decent, but could have used a bit more sweetness.  The fries were really tasty.  We also ordered a  bread pudding desert, but were disappointed with that as well. The atmosphere was clean (aside from the big signed picture of Guy Fieri hanging on the wall) and so were the bathrooms.  The staff was upbeat and attentive to details.  However, I don't think we will be back."
"Hubs and I made it here an hour before closing time last Thursday.  It still was pretty busy.  Everyone was super friendly which eminded me of some BBQ joints back home in NC.  Someone near the front will seat you after you order.  Of note, if you want to eat outside, you have to finish up right at closing time, but if you eat inside, you can stay longer if you want.I tried the sliced brisket platter.  The brisket was good, but I've had juicier.  The vinegar-based BBQ sauce was pretty good.  Hubby's 1/2 slab Baby Backs a la carte were so tender, juicy, and delicious.  They took an extra 10 minutes to make, but they were worth it.  Since the platter already came with the slaw and 2 sides, we just split those and an order of cornbread, which was more than enough for 2 people.  The coleslaw was a delicious vinegar based slaw that had either celery seed or dill seed, which gave it a great flavor kick.  The mac & cheese was also very tasty.  The fries were the best side - freshly made, not to thick or too thin, just right with the salt, and dusted with pepper.  They taste just like my favorite Kettle Brand Krinkle Cut Salt & Freshly Ground Pepper Chips  Cornbread was extra - it's the kind with actual corn pieces.  Big plus that they have both types of ice tea - YAY! Excuse me while I lick my fingers reminiscing before I finish typing up this review."
"So I'm not exactly sure what all the hype is about. In Texas these types of places are all over the place and I suppose its a novelty to have on in Chicago. With that out of the way the food is not all that incredible. Is it good BBQ? Absolutely, but I can find at least 5 comparable sliced brisket places in Chicago. I was not blown out of the water. The pros are the a la cart style with always included coleslaw, the quick prep, the control of tables so you have a shot at a seat (like Edzo's), and decent portions.The cons: the neighborhood clearly hates having this place there as evidenced by the ""no smoque parking"" signs and disgruntled looking neighbors. The beans were not worth beans, and the cornbread was really crappy. So the experience was overall pleasant but I would never make the trip to this place if I werent in the neighborhood."
"Been there a bunch of times. Great brisket sandwich. I always liked with both sauses. Pulled pork sandwiches good too, but like brisket best. Super friendly and helpful service."
"Now I'm a southern boy and know what good BBQ is. And this place is my favorite in the Chicagoland. I found this place several years ago and love it every time I go. Even if there is a long line, I wait. Cause I know what pot of gold I'm receiving at the end of this rainbow and its brisket with a taste of ribs."
Wow was this good! Came by on a Friday about 12:15 - there is a line to order but it goes pretty fast and there are people asking if your going to eat in will find you a table - we had no problem getting a table outside. I went for the 1/2 & 1/2 - pork and beef. They both were so good! I got the combo that comes with cole slaw and choice of side. The slaw was VERY good - it was vinegar based with slivers of purple onion. I opted for the BBQ beans-amazing!
"This might be 4.5 stars FOR CHICAGO, but I'd put it at 3.5 stars if we're comparing it to other BBQ joints across the country.  I went with a pulled pork sandwich (everybody in the joint seemed to be eating a sandwich of some sort), baked beans, and mac n' cheese.  It was good.  The sauce wasn't my favorite, but it was good.  It doesn't seem like they gave any other options for BBQ sauce like many of the top spots in the country do.  I would have liked to have had an option to sample a variety of sauces but, alas, t'was not the case here. All in all, I was satisfied with my meal but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there like I would at other BBQ joints in the country:  Henry's Hi-Life (San Jose,CA), Loveless Café (Nashville), Mac's Speed Shop (Charlotte,NC), Arthur Bryant's (Kansas City), Oklahoma Joe's (Kansas City) . . . off the top of my head.  I'd go 3.5 stars for this spot if this was an option but I think it's closer to 4 than 3 so 4 stars It is."
Very good ribs!  Excellent Mac & Cheese!  Fries are fresh and tasty!  We love this place.  Ribs are very tasty!
"I've heard mixed reviews about Smoque so I was eager to try it.  Meh, I wasn't missing much.My friend and I walked in right before the lunch hour mayhem so, we were able to order and sit down immediately.  My go-to is pulled pork and theirs was pretty dry.  The bun/bread the pulled pork was served on wasn't complimentary either.  And their BBQ sauce, aside from being extremely runny, tasted off.  I took a bite of my friend's rib meat and that was really dry, too.  Maybe some people prefer dry rubbed ribs over the kind of ribs that fall off the bone, I don't.  Overall, I think Smoque is over priced.  I honestly believe I can make a better pulled pork sandwich at home."
"Dear Smoque,I think your food is good, but as a native Texan, my expectations for barbecue proper are unseasonably high. When graded on a curve, I have no choice but to ding you.Smoque is hailed as the reigning champion of Chicago barbecue. I've yet to eat other contenders like Lillie's Q or Chicago Q, so my review of Smoque is strictly in silo with my Texan (re: better) and other BBQ experiences.Smoque's brisket looks the part. Squint and it doesn't look unlike an offering from Austin's own world famous Franklin BBQ. The char looks legitimate, the smoke ring is present, and the meat looks fall-off-the-metaphoric-bone worthy. Wherein lies the rub? In the taste. Smoque's brisket is by no means dry; it just lacks the requisite flavor.Smoque does take great care to make the best brisket they possible can make. Take a moment to read its BBQ manifesto, and it's clear that they are trying to emulate Hill Country 'cue with its brisket. Smoque even imports its sausage from a famous Texas family, the Mikeskas (I'd stop by the Columbus post all the time en route from Houston to Austin).As for the more near and dear to Chicago style, the pulled pork and ribs, I had the great misfortune of stopping by the nothing-short-of-amazing Pappy's Smokehouse in St. Louis on my drive up from Texas to Chicago. Smoque's ribs and pulled pork are both good; Pappy's is better.At this point, it's hurting me to give Smoque a three-star rating, since its BBQ is really tasty and I definitely plan to go back again. Smoque just needs an extra push to go from good to great, and I hope it makes it there."
Repeat customer every time I'm in town. 1/2 & 1/2 sliced brisket and pulled pork sandwich with BBQ beans. Delicious!
"Melt in your mouth deliciousness.  Even though parking is a challenge, the struggle is worth it. Mac and cheese must have crack in it. Brisket is the way it's supposed to be....tender, sweet, and delish."
"Best BBQ I've ever had. Tried Sliced Brisket Platter with BBQ Beans, Macaroni And Cheese and Cole Slaw. Everything was phenomenal. Meat comes with 2 sauces. I will be back for sure.Parking could be a hassle and the place is not very big inside so try to go in off peak times. I went in at 3 pm and had no issues."
1/2 brisket sandwich with fresh cut fries. Sliced brisket melts in your mouth. Spice it up with candied jalapeños and spicy Memphis sauce. Tried the baked beans a little too smoky for my taste.. Husband says the macaroni and cheese was excellent he would share.  Excellent food overall.
"Love this fun neighborhood restaurant. Featured on Dinner, Drive-ins and Dive there were folks in line checking it out for the first time, not disappointed. Love the pulled pork, sides are not my thing. Be prepared for a wait and great staff."
"I love this place! Food is so delicious. I love the mac and cheese, bread pudding, cornbread...everything is so good!"
There really isn't much more to be said compared to what has already been said.  Best I have had in Chicago.  Place is great and will be back.  I am going to save myself the typing of what other have already written.Love it
"I really like this place and I'm from Memphis so I'm pretty picky about my bbq.. Everything I had was solid. Okay, the beans weren't my favorite but that's just quibbling."
"Meat is as advertised, delicious. The sides are very good. They add an extra element and I would recommend getting as many as possible.Seating system is a little scary at first, because you order first then get seated, but the line moves quickly and we got seated before our food was ready.Decent bathrooms."
"Unfortunately Smoque always misses the mark. Maybe my bbq palate is slightly different from everyone else, like having a preference for certain beers over others. But the thing that bugs me every time is the dry, bland brisket, and flavorless pulled pork. The food always smells amazing, but the flavor is just not there. Having to drown your bbq in sauce is a sign of bland bbq...sorry."
"I could go into detail but I would just be repeating what everyone has already said about Smoque, so I'll keep it short and sweet:1)  Probably the best BBQ in the cityand2)  Often not a line, which seems crazy, but it's true143/365"
"The rating speaks for itself. If you are craving barbecue this place will meat your needs. I cruised up with my Sunday funday partner, who is from the barbecue state of Texas I might add, for a long awaited fix of some tender fixings.We walked up to a line out the door on a nice warm day and waited what seemed like 30 minutes. It was the nicest day that week in the spring so as you can imagine people were out and about on the street mulling around. No amateur mistakes were made as we grabbed a six-pack of brews from Hangovers Sports Bar and Liquor Store just a couple blocks north. Once we got inside we cracked a beer and anxiously debated what to order when we got up front. Half slab of baby back ribs, Texas sausage, and the brisket with corn bread, mac n' cheese, and baked beans. About 10 minutes after we put our order in it was time. Hot damn everything was good but the brisket was great and is worth the drive back. I enjoyed the beans best of the sides. Around 30 bucks for two to eat and it was a perfect helping.When I hear a native Texan praise the BBQ and say it was better than most she has had in Austin there's something to be said about that. Next time the craving hits I know where I am headed. Meat heaven."
"My friend was visiting from NYC and wanted to try this place because he saw it on tv. We went Saturday night and the line was so long that we had to leave. Looking at people eagerly waiting in line and seeing people thoroughly enjoying their food inside told us we had to come back to try this place. We went back Sunday late afternoon and the wait wasn't too bad. We ordered a pound of brisket and the rib combo. The briskets were moist, tender and melt in your mouth kind. I would definitely go back for the briskets. The St. Louis ribs were better than the baby backs."
"Their brisket.....gawd. The best I've had. I'm not a BBQ snob and didn't grow up with it. That said, I've had brisket at a bunch of spots in the city and this spot does it right. Go NOW!"
"I ordered a tray of bread pudding for a BBQ I was having. I was in traffic for 2 hours driving to Smoque to pick it up and 1 hour driving back home. A total of 3 hours commuting .. And I will say, the bread pudding was worth the trip. Definitely will be ordering again in the future. While I was there, I tried the Mac n cheese and peach cobbler. Both were great. Will be back sometime for lunch to try a meal."
Jesus behind the counter - whomever yells out the numers.I think that was his name. Has great customer service. Winning combination amazing customer service with great food. Good for you Smoque and thank you!
Finally got to eat here after wanting to for the longest time. All I can say is wow! I got the brisket sandwich and Mac and cheese. My boyfriend also got the brisket sandwich with beans and everything was just incredible! I didn't want to finish eating! And to top it off the prices are actually really great! Can not wait to eat back at this place asap!
"I really love BBQ. No matter what city I'm in, I want to try the ""best' BBQ. I finally made my way to Smoque and it didn't disappoint. I went with a platter of brisket, mac, fries, slaw and the peach cobbler for dessert. Everything was on point and I haven't had better BBQ in Chicago.Be smart and go!"
"When I have done something that causes me to feel I deserve a reward - I get ribs from Smoque.  That's how good this place is.....Seating sucks, parking sucks, they give you styrofoam cups and they are not even that big.  Even with all that - this place is my ""You deserve something nice"" place....I want to fight anyone who doesn't give this 5 stars...."
"Can they please open another location?!?!?!The food here is absolutely amazing! You can order any of the meats and any of the sides and leave feeling completely satisfied. My favorite is definitely the sliced brisket. It's smoked to perfection. The meat is so tender and there's just the right amount of fat left on the edges to give it that natural flavor. I also like the cornbread, mac and cheese and beans. You really can't go wrong here.P.s. the line is out the door and seating is limited. There aren't any non peak times. It's packed all the time"
"I was introduced to this restaurant by a friend that lives in the area. The last time I had good smoked b-que like this was in Nashville, Tennessee. We ordered the ribs, brisket, and pulled pork, fries, salad, and corn bread. I know it's just fries, but I am a freak when it comes to fries, and these fries are to die for. The pulled pork, brisket, and ribs were incredible. They were juicy, tender, mouth watering and paired with the salad and corn bread.. Mamma Mia!! Each meat has a different smoked flavor with a sweetness from the sauce than the other, but compliments one another so well. I am a big fan. There are not that many smoked b-que places around Chicago that I have been able to find that are better than this place. Please do not ever change Smoque BBQ.. Keep your recipe just the way it is."
"Always a ""must eat"" when we head to the city. My favorite is the brisket, but you simply cannot go wrong with the pulled pork or the ribs. Mac 'n cheese, cornbread, fries are all incredible as well."
"Great service and Food is delicious...Been here 3x and love it...It's a little restaurant but the quality is outstanding. If they make the restaurant bigger, they can make a lot more money...I always recommend this place to all my friends..."
The nearly 3000 other reviews speak for themself. There's a reason this joint has 4.5 stars. This place has the best BBQ around.
This place is great!A smoke flavor so good that not even a review can describe.Expect a line out the door and dont forget the peach cobbler!I liked the pulled pork!
"Smoque BBQ is the best BBQ in the city of Chicago.  That's all there is to it, folks.  The beans, while not vegetarian, are worthy of religious treatment.  They are SO delicious.  Sometimes I get two sides of beans.  That's a little embarrassing, but whatever.  WORTH IT.  I also recommend Smoque for take out.  During the summer, the wait can be insane.  But, it's easy enough to pick up your food and go.  Real tasty, with no hassle!"
"Not bad BBQ for Chicagoland. Excellent brisket-- nice ambience, and OK prices. The brisket was so tender and smoky with great flavor. I would definitely come back to grab a brisket sandwich again.I also sampled the pulled pork (very subpar), the St. Louis style ribs (not bad, but not great) which had a really strong smoky flavor, but it just didn't jive with my taste buds I s'pose. The baby back ribs were a big let down. Kinda tough, not all that tender, and they needed quite a bit of sauce. My main negative here is that the sauce was not all that great-- slightly spicy, slightly sweet but nothing special, and they only had one sauce. So, if you don't like it much, you are outta luck."
"I hired Smoque to cater my husband's birthday party.  It was affordable and delicious!  We picked up the food, which they had nicely wrapped and boxed to stay warm.  We were greeted by pleasant workers, even though they were crazy busy, as usual!  They even helped carry everything to our car!Our guests were THRILLED that we had Smoque and they tore that food UP. Brisket, pulled pork, bbq chicken, mac & cheese, baked beans....all we had left over was a few spoons of sauce :P"
"Half rack of baby backs, slaw, corn bread, and chili.  All excellent.  The flavor I kept coming back to was how well the rub in the meet went with the bbq sauce.  Out of this world.  I was not hot on the sauce when mixed with any other item...but ohhhhj, with the rub....heaven.  The fact that there are no TVs in there too is nice since you are able to really engage your chow partner."
"Came here with Kevin N. to satisfy my inner white/southern girl (as he would call it). We had the sliced beef brisket, pulled pork, rib combo (St. Louis and Baby Back) with slaw, mac and cheese, baked beans, and cornbread. While I can't say this is the best bbq I've ever tasted, it did the job. The beef brisket was very tender and juicy and the ribs fell off the bones, just the way I like it. The bbq sauces were delicious and gave the meats that extra umph it needed. The baked beans is a must. On a week night, it took about 30-40 minutes for us to order and get a table."
"Ya know I am SHOCKED that I haven't done a review on Smoque!!! My wife have been here SO much, that we were going there BEFORE we got married!!... The Brisquet is so tender. the ribs are wonderful, and flavorful. Their sides are a bit small, but I can live with that. I wish it weren't so far away :-(   Maybe it's for the best. That way I won't be able to walk in ANYTIME I'd want some good BBQ. :-) Oh yeah, the ONLY reason that Smoque does NOT get 5 stars from me is that they REALLY need more space??...room?? uh, real estate??... so 4 stars.."
"Always packed but for good reason. As a frequent traveler, I've tried BBQ all over the country and Smoque can definitely run with the likes of Texas, Tennessee, and wherever else. I recommend the brisket with a side of mac and whatever else you feel like eating. Might as well throw in some cornbread, too. Be sure to get some extra BBQ sauce and jalapeño peppers up at the counter and don't forget to BYOB. Green Street Meats is also good but much farther away from me and more hip/trendy. Food is comparable and it just depends on what atmosphere you're looking for. Cuisine wise you'll be equally satisfied."
"Pork Ribs are the thing to get here. They have Baby Back and St Louis Style and both are executed well with good smoke, moisture and a unique rub. St Louis Ribs - GoodBaby Back Ribs - GoodSliced Brisket (burnt) - OkMac & Cheese - OkBaked Beans - GoodPeach Cobbler - GOODFolks here like their sauce and like to dunk their meat into it. They have a daily dessert special but the Peach Cobbler is pretty solid. It would be tough to pass that up."
"If you love bbq, you have to check this place out! You'll smell the delicious goodness just walking by. Be prepared for a long wait if you come at night, but on a Sunday afternoon, there was no wait. When you head in, you order at the register and then someone directs you to a table. The food comes out fairly quickly, and it's great. We ordered a full slab of ribs (22.95) and since we were indecisive about which type we wanted, baby back or St. Louis. Both were delicious, but I prefer the baby back ribs since the St. Louis is fattier. None fall off the bone since they are smoked. For our two sides, we chose the Mac and cheese, which I would recommend, and the chili, which I would not. It was a little too watery. We also ordered a platter of pulled pork a la carte (8.45). You should definitely get this- it's pretty much perfect. Overall, this is my favorite BBQ place, and you should give it a try!"
"the brisket was so so. lacked flavor without the sauce. felt like it needed more seasoning, salt in particular. the sweet sauce is amazing though. the ribs, baby backs & St. Louis, are great. Texas sausage might taste a bit over cooked for some and too spicy. I enjoyed it. Mac & cheese was pretty good. the slaw is made with a vinegar based sauce so if you're a fan of the mayo type, you may not like. however, I found it lighter and very tasty. didn't really care for the peach cobbler, but I'm not a fan of cinnamon. I'm a bit of a purest when it comes to cobbler."
The reviews are right.  Go there as many times as you can and try everything on their menu.  You will not be disappointed.  Get's crowded.
"Let me just start by saying this is my FAVORITE spot to eat, everything I ever ate there I enjoyed to the fullest. My favorite dish is the half and half with baked mac and don't get me started with how amazing the bread pudding is, it's to die for. I recommend this spot to everyone that enjoys BBQ!"
"The only barbecue I'll even touch in the city.  I've gotten so many of my family and friends hooked on this place.  The ribs are beyond tender, the mac & cheese is the to die for,  the brisket just melts in your mouth.  I don't even enjoy beans and I could live off of theirs. And the best part of the whole experience is no matter how many times you wash your hands, they will still smell like smoqued meat the entire day (only making your wish you had more food)."
"Smoque BBQ is my new favorite BBQ place.  My dad, who often complains that everything is ""far,"" said that Smoque was ""well worth the [50 min] drive.""I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich with chopped brisket and pulled pork.  I admit, the brisket was a little dry, but their BBQ sauce is outstanding and I doused my sandwich in it.  The sandwich was huge, half of it would have been filling enough with all the sides.  Sandwiches come with coleslaw and the choice of one another side.  I ordered the macaroni & cheese, which is the best macaroni & cheese I have had at any BBQ joint.  It was creamy and had a crunchy topping.  I usually don't like coleslaw, but it looked pretty good and I ate a few bites.  It's fresh, not that slimy stuff you see everywhere else.I came here with my husband and parents, so I got to sample a LOT more of their other food.  The St. Louis ribs were just okay (again, a little dry), but I'm not a rib person.  Okay, stop cursing me out, I don't like ribs.  Anyway, I also tried the Texas sausage.  I didn't know what to expect, but it had a nice snap and wasn't too spicy.In addition to sandwiches and ribs, they offer ""tasting"" portions of just about everything for a few bucks.  Even the peach cobbler was fantastic.  Nothing disappointed us here.  On top of all of this, it's BYOB!It's worth noting that they were busy on a Saturday afternoon, as expected.  The line was almost out the door, but we waited maybe 20-30 minutes max from the line to receiving our food.  They have a good system here - wait in line, order at the counter, and when your food is ready, THEY tell you where to sit.  This prevents people from ""saving"" tables and camping out while they wait for their food.For two of us, we paid a little more than $40 and received a lot of food.  We all left stuffed and happy!"
"FINALLY made it to Smoque BBQ!!! Why did it take me this long?! Don't question me!Be sure to get here early if you want to skip the line. My friend and I arrived at 5:45pm on a Tuesday and there were plenty of empty tables to choose from. By 6:30pm, the line was extended to the door. We ordered a platter with sliced brisket, cole slaw, barbecue beans, and corn bread. For more variety and better sharing, we also added a few tastes to our platter: pulled pork, Texas sausage, and quarter slab of St. Louis ribs. Everything on the platters were delicious even though I'm not generally a fan for cole slaw and beans. With over 2,000 reviews for Smoque BBQ, I don't find it necessary to go into detail on why this place is so devilishly capturing. Just try it if you haven't yet or keep coming back for more. I will do my fair share of returns!"
"Service is somewhat inconsistent here, they make mistakes in orders too often.  The ribs and other barbecue dishes are good, not the best in town, but the best in the neighborhood. The tables and seating here isn't all that comfortable and at peak times it's too crowded.  Order ahead and take it home."
"I had been meaning to try out Smoque BBQ for weeks but there was always such a long line! Long lines tend to mean great food though so eventually my roommate and I decided to suck it up and go. Boy were we glad we did! The line actually moved quite quickly, it's just constantly growing. The service was great and the perfect blend. You place your order at the counter and someone will seat you. Then, they let you know when your food is ready and you go pick it up at the counter and take it back to your table. When they called me, majority of my order was ready except one thing. They offered me a free cornbread to apologize for the wait and said they'd bring the last thing to my table. It was a nice, thoughtful, simple touch. Now onto the food. I got both types of ribs (no regrets) and my roommate got the brisket. I was shocked but I actually liked the St. Louis style ribs even better than the baby back ones. There was a ton of meat and while it's a dry rub, it comes with killer BBQ sauce on the side that you can drench them in. I dipped everything in that BBQ sauce. Fries, corn bread, ribs, brisket, my hands, my face. It was so good.I tried my roommate's brisket as well and it was so ridiculously tender it just fell apart in your mouth. I'm usually a die hard rib person but I will probably actually get this brisket next time I go. (and maybe a side of ribs for good measure). All in all, the wait isn't that bad and is definitely worth it for the food!Note: it is BYOB and you can't drink if you sit outside."
"This is by far the best BBQ I have had in Chicago. My review is based on the overall experience and not just limited to the food.It is a Texas style joint with a real smoked meat, dry rub and and great sauce with a sufficient amount of black pepper, smoke, and heat if you want it. The sides are good not awesome but better than most in chicago."
Best ribs I've ever had and this is coming from from a person who dislikes ribs. Must try in Chicago!
"These ARE the ribs you've been looking for.BBQ crawl stop #3. Best ribs and best brisket (chopped)! Also most low-key and affordable.You know when you have an idea of what kind of BBQ you like, but never quite find it? Well, that's the way it was for me before I visited Smoque. I've tasted many delicious ribs lot of places, but I finally had the ribs I've always known were out there somewhere, right here at Smoque. FANTASTIC!Our mini crawl was coming to a stop with our bellies being pretty full by the time we arrived here. We were able to park just down the street (for free, no less), and were happy to see no line on this sunny summer Saturday at about 4 pm. We walked in and right up to the counter, only one person ahead of us, and lots of seating. Yay!We got a combo for $22 of 2 half racks of ribs (1 St. Louis, 1 baby back), 2 sides (peach cobbler and BBQ beans) and it comes with coleslaw as well. To that we added ""a taste"" of sausage and of chopped brisket, for an additional $3 each. So, for $28, we really got quite a lot- and took leftovers home! Next time, I'd really want to try the chicken quarter. WOW, did that look phenomenal!I chose the chopped brisket based on Meghan H's review that it was basically burnt ends- my favorite, and oh my, I'm glad I did. They were juicy, succulent, full of flavor and just outstanding. It really does compare well to burnt ends. Great tip Meghan, otherwise I might have waited til another time to try. It is making me salivate right now, actually. :-)~ The sausage we had was good, but I felt it tasted better the next day.But, the show stopper for me, was without a doubt the baby back ribs! They are what I've been looking for my whole BBQ life. The blackened crust was devine, the meat was not quite fall off the bone, it was juicy, smoky, flavorful, a lil spicy- everything ribs should be, and what you expect them to taste like when you find yourself watching a BBQ cook-off on the Food Network for one too many hours on a sad Thursday night.It was really hard to discern the better of the two, but the baby back just slightly edged out the STL ribs. Both were outstanding. Just as a note, my husband liked these second best for the crawl, as he said they tasted a bit of liquid smoke. Apparently, either he was high, or I'm totally ok with that. Either way, I'm so happy I know where I am getting ribs from now on. The sides were just ok for us, tho I did really like those BBQ beans, and my 2 bites of the cobbler. But this was most definitely all about the meat, baby. Overall, this is a more ""spill-friendly"" environment I'd be comfortable with taking kids to, and again, the most affordable of the three today. One might even say it was a tad grimy, a real down-home kinda place. But we were grimy too by the time we left, so I guess that's ok!**Yay, 200th Yelp review, & it's Smoque!**"
"f-ing goodseriouslybrisket, melts in your mouth.the st. louis ribs are phenomenali dont know what else to sayits certainly not free but its delicious"
"Fantastic. Although it's a little out of the way, I loved it. We had chopped and sliced brisket, BBQ chicken, pulled pork and sides of macaroni and cheese, cornbread and fries. It was a feast for all! It was delicious-- all of it-- and the guys were really nice and helped us share all of it with extra trays, lots of napkins and awesome service. This place is also BYOB too! So don't forget to grab some beers before you head over."
"I'm old enough to remember Bones Resturant in Lincolnwood, and how the meat would be smoked and tender enough to fall of the bone, this was BBQ heaven for me. I even remember when Bones had a small fire and all my classmates were wondering if this would be the end of our favorite BBQ place. I shed a tear when they closed Bones for LWoods. I've tried eating at Smoque before, (actually a number of times), but with 45+ minute waits at the prime times I knew it had to be good, but with a limited lunch hour, getting in here for a bite was near impossible.Finally after the closing of my near and dear Hot Dougs and waiting in an epic line in one of the last weeks, I made an effort to eat at Smoque BBQ.I'm in BBQ Heaven again, I had the sliced brisket sandwich, and it just melted in my mouth, there are not enough food adjectives to explain this taste and feeling! I now have a new comfort food HQ, and its practically walking distance from one of my clients. I can't wait to bring out of town friends to eat here, even if it means waiting in line for 45+ minutes, its worth the wait!"
"Saw on Diners, Drive In and Dives. Had super high expectations and was let down. We got there about 2:30 on a Saturday. No wait at all. I can understand why people say the wait is super long. Very small dining area. But it is quaint and nice. Service was very friendly. Why 3 stars???  I have had better BBQ at many other places (I love BBQ). The brisket should almost melt in your mouth....it didn't. Baby back ribs were tough. I did like that their neat was dry rubbed and they face you two wet sauces to dip. Two lunch entrees and soft drinks (no alcohol) was $40.00. I would opt for a better BBQ establishment in Chicago."
I liked the cornbread which had corn in it. The ribs were good. Didn't understand why cornbread was considered to be a side item. I thought it should have come with the meal. All in all the wait wasn't bad. Service was decent.
"By Far, My favorite BBQ place. My favorite is the 1/2 & 1/2 Sandwich, with brisket and pulled pork. The sauces are all amazing,  and the mac & cheese reminds me of some homemade recipe that only your grandma can make. I just wish the sides were bigger, I can't get enough. I tried the ribs for the first time last week, and it was almost breath taking, mainly because I didn't want to waste a second on breathing, but rather eating these ribs. You haven't lived until you try it out."
"There are only a few restaurants where patrons walk in with a smile on their face, order their food with a smile on their face, eat huge tender chunks of meat with a smile on their face, and leave with a smile on their face. Smoque does that. When people talk about Chicago, lots of people mention the hot dogs or the deep dish, but they should really be talking about the BBQ. Food here is served as ala cart items or you can order meat with 2 sides and slaw. When you enter, you order and pay at the counter, but then they seat you and bring the food to you.  The Meats:BBQ Brisket: This was one of the most tender and juicy cuts of meat I have ever had. In combination with the smokey char on the outside, you can tell that this meat had been smoked for no less than 14 hr. After 14 hrs this meet was so soft and tender on the inside that you thought it had been watching nothing but adorable puppies forever. Ribs: If you are a fan of getting messy when you eat BBQ, don't miss this treat. The meat literally melts off the bone. It has a Memphis style dry rub that really makes the ribs very savory with just a little bit of sweetness from the BBQ sauce. I did not want to use the wet naps afterwards, because i wanted to lick all the sauce off my fingers.The Sides:mac and cheese: This mac and cheese was melty & rich and a great complement to the savory pile of meat. Slaw: Okay, I know that slaw might be an after thought for you.  You think it's something that people throw at you because its easy to make, but I really liked their slaw. It was light and tangy and not to heavy. Overall, everyone is super friendly, the food is delicious, and you should eat here if you have the chance."
"I'm not sure what happened here. I've always really liked this place, but today I had flavorless onion-ie cole slaw, vinegary bbq sauce, beans with way too much brown sugar and onion, pasty (instead of cheesy) mac & cheese, and the sliced brisket was dry, had a thick slab of fat on it and was burned on one end. I'd like to say maybe this was an off day, but not with that many things wrong on all these items. Did ownership change or something?"
"Now THIS is barbeque.  After reading their manifesto on BBQ philosophy on their website I had high expectations, but they were exceeded here.  Everything we had was delicious.  Somebody here is clearly thinking about balance and how the different flavors will harmonize, so the slaw complements the sauce which complements the meat, which goes nicely with the beans, etc.  The standout was the St. Louis ribs -- smoky, flavorful, meaty, and neither too tough nor too tender.  I cannot think of the last time or place that I have had better ribs.  (For similar reasons, the smoked chicken was also excellent -- I wonder if the techniques are similar.)It's crowded, but remarkably well-organized (you order, then they seat you at a table roughly when your food is ready).  Go now."
"Okay So its a typical Friday night.. My ex had been raving about this place.. My friend from California was in town.So we figure why not try it. So we get there around 7 pm. Line isn't long at all. Cool. We order our food and get a table.  We receive our food rather quickly.We start eating. Food is delicious. But we are sitting next to these Obama hating stuck up drunk dudes.. Im trying to ignore them. Out of nowhere the one across from me silently pukes.  No one notices at all except his friend.He was like dude we got to go.  The dude cleans up with a bunch of napkins and they leave the mess. At this point , I had lost my appetite, I tell my friend about it. She tells one of the employees, they clean up promptly and keep apologizing. Luckily they gave us gift cards to come back without us even asking. Such an amazing staff."
"BELIEVE THE HYPE.Smoque has been at the top of my eatin' to-do list for a long time. My wife finally took me there last night for my birthday dinner. I'll spare you all kinds of flowery language and just say it plain: Smoque is -- by far and without question -- the best barbecue I've ever had. I've had BBQ in all kinds of places, and nothing comes close. This is the real friggin' deal. And BYOB to boot (indoors, not on the patio).THE MEATS:- Sliced brisket: juicy, tender and covered with excellent bark. I only needed my fork to cut it, but honestly, it was so tender a stiff breeze probably would have done the job. It's served with a thinner, somewhat tart sauce that balances the rich smokiness of the beef (no need to drown it in sauce, a little dab will do the job).- Pulled pork: as my wife put it, this was the most ""pulled"" pulled pork she ever had, as it fell into beautiful shreds when met by a fork. The pork also had a lovely bark and was perfectly moist.- Ribs: Seriously. These ribs. I'm a rib fiend and these were the best I've ever had. They're the perfect texture (tender, but not mushy/sliding off the bone). The ribs are covered in a crackling bark and come with a thicker, sweeter sauce (again, no need to go overboard on the dipping, the meat speaks for itself).- Sausage: Excellent smoked beef sausage. Not much more to say here -- if you dig Texas-style smoked sausage, you won't be disappointed.THE SIDES:- Slaw: I typically avoid slaw at BBQ joints because the gloppy, mayo-blasted stuff you usually get is foul. At Smoque, the slaw is fresh and acidic with nary a drop of mayo in sight. It's made with a simple mix of cabbage and red onions and was a nice counterpoint to the BBQ.- Beans: Not your typical baked beans. There's no sugary-sweet thick glaze on these guys, which is a good thing in my opinion. They had a thinner, more vinegary sauce that was studded with little bits of brisket.- Mac and cheese: Cheesy, crusty -- nice and straightforward. They didn't try to get cute with anything here, just cheese sauce and noodles, nothing else needed.- Fries: Crispy, hot and salty. What else could you want?- Cornbread: Excellent cornbread. It's not some crap made from a box mix. It was warm, fluffy and buttery, and had whole kernels of corn in it (which I love). THE SERVICE:The staff at Smoque was great. They have a team of hosts/runners/waiters that get you a table, bring you your food and clear trays away. They were all friendly and helpful. You pay at the counter then take your seat, but make sure to throw a few bucks in the tip jar for the team -- they earn it. We actually got a bonus rib portion because when I went to pick up our sample tray, the gal behind the counter said the piece was too small (it wasn't, but who am I to argue with free ribs?).All in all, this is one of the top 5 meals I've had in Chicago. Like I said at the top, best BBQ I've ever eaten. I will definitely be back. We were still in the middle of our meal when we began concocting excuses to make a return trip."
Best BBQ I've ever had.Park around the corner down the block and just order the pulled pork. I had 1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 sliced brisket. Both were amazing but I wish I had more pulled pork.I also had the peach cobbler which was also amazing and the perfect serving size.Pulled Pork - 5/5Brisket - 4/5Peach Cobbler - 4/5
"About 2 weeks ago, 2 friends and I went to a BBQ joint in Chicago called Smoque. We were craving some meat especially some really good brisket. Smoque was on the show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives about 7 years ago and has built a reputation for good BBQ around the Chicago area. And it so happened to be that when we were there, the Food Network was filming at Smoque again! They wouldn't tell us what show it was for though, but it was cool to see the Food Network there.When we got to Smoque, it smelled really good. You could smell the meat and the smoke and it made us hungrier. We decided to go family style and share everything. We got the sliced beef brisket platter with Mac & Cheese and BBQ Beans, the Rib Combo (Half Baby Back/Half St. Louis) with Brisket Chili and Cornbread, we added a Texas Sausage, and for dessert we got both the Peach Cobbler and Bread Pudding. Coleslaw was included in every platter.The food took about 10 min to be served, but it felt like 30 cause we so hungry. I had to stop myself from digging right in to take a quick picture of the food.After we all took our pictures, we went straight in for that brisket and one word came to all of our minds...mushy. The brisket was terrible. It was not brisket and it was definitely not BBQ. It was boiled meat that has been boiled for too long and served with a less than average BBQ sauce. There was no smoke ring, no smoke flavor, or any flavor at all. Yeah I know it's supposed to be fork tender or melt in your mouth tender, but there is a BIG line between melt in your mouth tender to having the whole piece disintegrate into nothing before it even touches your mouth. The sauce tasted like generic BBQ sauce that they poured in vinegar and mustard. It was nothing interesting or spectacular. The brisket chili was horrible. It was watery, no flavor, not enough salt, the beans were too mushy, and the brisket was non-existent in it. The cornbread was not good. It was not sweet, it was not savory, and it had no corn flavor. And the coleslaw tasted like pure apple cider vinegar and that's it. The vinegar was so harsh that any flavor or spice they put into that coleslaw was just obliterated by the vinegar.Then we moved to the Rib Combo. This combo was good except for the coleslaw and the baby back ribs. The baby back ribs were okay. They weren't the best ribs I have ever made nor were they the worst. There could have been more seasoning on it, more smoke, and it was overcooked. People think that ribs are the best when it falls off the bone, but to me that's wrong. The meat should be tender but when you take a bite out of the rib, the rest of the meat should still stick on the bone. That's exactly what the St. Louis ribs did. This was the highlight of the entire meal. These ribs were really good. It was nicely seasoned, you could taste the smoke, and it was perfectly cooked. This platter also had the 2 best sides as well. The BBQ beans were good, but it was just a little too sweet. It could have used more vinegar and mustard to cut down that sweetness. The Mac & Cheese was good as well. It was creamy, cheesy, and rich, just like how every Mac & Cheese should be. The panko topping on top added the crunch the Mac & Cheese neededThe Texas sausage was also really good. It was nicely seasoned and had that great snap to it. This is a must get as well.However, the dessert was a huge failure. They were stone cold and did not have that wow factor that desserts have. The peach cobbler was just completely one note. The crunch on top was soggy, the peaches in syrup should have been bubbling so create that warmness in peach cobbler, and there was no pastry base to it. It was more of a crumble then a cobbler. The bread pudding was so dense, heavy, and dry. It needed more of that pecan caramel topping on it. The topping was actually pretty good. It added that necessary crunch to the bread pudding.For almost $20 per person, Smoque was not worth it. It was way over hyped for what it was worth. Maybe they were having an off day or maybe Guy just got it completely wrong, but this was definitely not a place where I had to check out in Chicago. Overall this whole meal could be summed up in one word. Disappointing."
"Now this, my friend, is a top BBQ joint. My girlfriend and I went to Phil's BBQ in San Diego which has 6270 4.5 star Yelp reviews and is hailed as top tier. But that does NOT compare to the caliber of Smoque. From prices to the juicy, beautiful tenderness of their brisket... You will leave satisfied. They're generous with the BBQ sauce so don't be afraid to ask! The brisket is so damn tender you literally don't need a knife to cut it. The baked beans are a must. Their smokey flavor is making my mouth water. I love you Smoque. Thank you.PS love the craft bottled sodas!!! Black cherry = mmmmm"
A friend ordered delivery of this delishness and I must say that for even eating all this meat cold and not hot and fresh in the restaurant still is freaking amazing! I LOVE the tangyness of the BBQ sauce and literally everything was moist and soft.  ALL the sides are good and I think the sausages here are my favorite thing and the brisket. If you want GOOD BBQ This is where it's at! DO IT!
"Had heard about this place from several people, they said it was good, they should of said great! AMAZING brisket! They cook it for like 15 hours and it shows, it is so tender it just falls apart and then melts in your mouth. My husband picked up his napkin, pulled it towards him and the napkin brushed across his brisket and it fell apart! That's how tender it is! The portions are generous as well, I always have left overs to take home, you get your money's worth for sure. The Mac n Cheese is made to order in a personal ramekin, which is really cool and it is so creamy and gooey, yet crunchy on the top. YUM! I just did a not so nice review for a bar b q place(County bar b q), stating in the review ""if you want good bar b q, go to Smoque""! Seriously, it is amazing food, good value and a cool atmosphere. My only complaint is it is far from my house!!!"
"YUM!!!  That was so good!   The wait is WELL worth the food.  The staff is friendly and  understands how hungry your are when walk in,The only down side is they are so busy, you have to request a table when you walk in, before ordering. Thank god it wasnt that busy when we came in that day  cause we got a table 2 mintues before our food was ready. Since your only 1 mile away from me, and i love BBQ   i will Definitely be coming back for dinner tonight with my family"
"Service was great! Very organized by having customers order their meal first & then having the hostess seat you. A smaller venue inside than I expected.The BBQ sauce was too tangy for my taste. I preferred the ribs w/o the sauce. The ribs were delicious!!! Although, very fatty, that's what gave the ribs flavor. The meat came easy off the bones too.The beans were okay and the coleslaw was more of a vinegar than mixed with coleslaw sauce. The Mac & Cheese was good."
"I was just checking out my Yelps and realized I haven't Yelped any of my Chicago favorites. Smoque is way way up there. When I lived in Chicago I would drive an hour to get some Smoque BBQ. I always said it was 15 minutes because everything in Chicago is 15 minutes away. I dragged everyone there I could and it was always a hit. I get ribs and brisket. I love the smokey flavor. They give you BBQ sauce but it doesn't need it.  However, I do buy several bottles now for home.  I've been to The Dinosaur in New York and this is hands down better. I guess you have to like that flavor and if you do or not sure give it a try!  What's it going to hurt?  My Arizona runner up is Piggly's at the Fair in Mesa, AZ.  There is nothing to eat in Arizona!And now my new activity of Geocaching has given me the discovery of a cache right there! I'll be getting you my friend in two weeks and counting.  Mmmm meat"
Ill keep it short and simple ...For Chicago this a damn good BBQ spot   but if your used to some spots in KC or Austin  it will be more like a 3 or 3.5 for you ...  end of story   ..oh yeah I almost forgot the brisket is awesome
"Dec 2011 Review:Probably the best consistent BBQ in Chicago, but its not fantastic.Chicago is just NOT a good BBQ town (OK, growing up in Texas colors this a lot).I'll take Smoque over all the fancypants BBQ places like lillie q and smoke daddy.Aug 2014 Update:The only place to go in Chicago is now Green Street Smoked Meats. Stands up to any legit Austin BBQ joint, including Franklin or La BBQ and frankly it's better better than Blacks and Smittys in Lockhart."
"I'm from a southern family, so I know good smoked meat and BBQ. Smoque is good- but just good. It's worth trying, but not to the extent I would wait in line to get in here. I'll give them this- they are really efficient with the seating, which is a plus because it can get crowded quickly here in weekends. I had the chopped brisket platter and also tried my friend's ribs. Good food, worth the price, but I just don't get the hype!! It's not the best BBQ I've had. It doesn't even make my top 20! My recommendation- give it a try. If there's more than a 30 minute wait, leave. Smoque is not Kumas or Hot Doug's- there's nothing here to justify standing in line smelling the food for longer than you will sit eating it."
"I never really order ribs from resturants, but this was by far one of the best ribs i've had in a long time. I waited about 30-40 mins to be seated, but it was well worth it. The Spicy Memphis Bbq Sauce was amazing with the ribs and also the 1/2 chicken. The Mac n Cheese was a great side with the brisket chili. I would go back for sure to try the pulled pork. Also, this place is byob."
"Wow is so delicious..i recommend this place the Baby backs St Louis the fresh cut fries are so good and the beans so I have to said I eat happy,and the price is okay"
"Incredible !!This is what Q should be.Very consistent and always delicious.The brisket really shines.So tender moist and smokey.The ribs are fantastic,and don't miss the smoked Texas sausage its incredible.It takes me well over an hour to drive here but its worth it.Chicago is lucky to have such a place."
"I really can't add anything new to this, other than I would say it's the best brisket in city limits. I'll still drive down to the south side for a tips and links combo (sauce on the side, please), but the brisket here is spot on. The brisket chili is definitely my favourite side, hands down, with the coleslaw in a close second. The rest of the sides will just fill you up before you get to finish that delicious brisket, so don't bother.I wish that Smoque still did the smoked salmon special on Easter weekend. I'm pretty sure this hasn't been offered in years, but I still think about that smoked fish from time to time. Word was that they didn't sell enough portions that weekend and lost money on it. Had I only known, I would have purchased all the salmons."
"Finally made it to Smoque last night, and I'm a fan.We purposely decided to visit on a Wednesday night to avoid the crowds, and it paid off - we scored free parking on Pulaski less than a block away, and were seated almost immediately after ordering.We ordered the pulled pork and ribs, along with fries, chili, cornbread, and peach cobbler.The pulled pork and ribs were both phenomenal - tender, great flavor, and good portions. I usually don't like coleslaw at all, but Smoque does it right with just enough acidity and sweetness to cut through what is otherwise a pretty heavy, saucy meal.The fries were exceptionally good, which I hadn't expected, as was the cornbread. The cobbler had a nice crust but the crust-to-filling ratio was a little lower than I would've liked (and I wished for a scoop of ice cream on the side).Overall, delicious, and I know I'll be back."
"One of my favorite places for comfort food!The ribs accompanied by Smoque's classic BBQ sauce, mac n cheese, coleslaw, cornbread and peach cobbler was one of the best meals I've ever had. Really busy in the late afternoon, even though we went on a week day, but the meal was well worth it! A must if you haven't tried this place already."
"I came here with a friend a few nights ago. The line was really, really long, but don't be discouraged - it also moves pretty quickly, and we needed pretty much that amount of time to decide what we wanted to get anyways. We ended up ordering: a full slab of baby back ribs (for me) and a pulled pork sandwich (for him), along with orders of fries for both of us. The star of the meal was definitely the baby back ribs (worth four stars, I think). They were tender and flavorful, and the sauce that came with it was fantastic. The pulled pork and fries, however, as the reason that I'm giving Smoque only three stars. The pulled pork was simply not that great - dry and a little flavorless, even with the little tub of sauce drizzled all over it, and the bun was nothing to write home about. The fries were only a little above lukewarm when we got them, and they were drenched in oil - twisting it a little bit resulted in squeezing drops of oil out. Service was fine and quick, and we didn't feel like we were being rushed at all by the servers - although we did feel a little rushed because the rest of the diners were eating at an incredible pace. We saw people get their food, scarf it down and disappear from the restaurant within fifteen minutes. It was actually crazy, although I'm not going to complain too much, since it did result in us being able to get a table. Overall: I would go back for the baby back ribs, and I saw some really great looking brisket at the table next to us. I would definitely go back to try that!"
"It may surprise some people that Chicago doesn't actually have a strong BBQ tradition and there aren't a ton of places where you can get really good BBQ in town. As a BBQ lover, some people brought this place to my attention. As I recall, this has been on some Food Network show (probably DDD) and the line can be quite long here in the summer.I'll say that everything I've had here is pretty damn good. Not the best BBQ I've ever had, but solid BBQ. If you are a fan of BBQ and are in town, then definitely check the place out."
"I've been to Smoque BBQ on several occasions and have never been disappointed in the food. I love their pulled pork and I have tried their ribs and brisket, which were delicious! I usually get the macaroni & cheese and that is yummy too. I have yet to try their peach cobbler since I always leave here feeling stuffed. If you're in the area I would definitely recommend trying this place. It has been busy everytime I've gone but I have never had a problem with getting a table/seat. You will likely have to stand in a line for a couple minutes to order but it moves pretty fast and there has always been a ""host"" that checks with you while you're waiting how many people your with to ensure a table. The atmosphere is casual, busy, and loud (but not so insanely loud you can't hear the person next to you). Since it is casual and loud I would definitely consider it ""kid friendly"" and they have some smaller options available for kids. If you can go without a stroller I would recommend doing so since it can get kind of tight."
"Amazingly tender meat! Both the pulled pork and brisket are so melt in your mouth tender. Mac n cheese is good. I love that the Cole slaw is more like a salad, seems not to have mayo. I like the ambiance, not pretentious, friendly staff. Close to the best BBQ, but too far to go regularly."
"Great food with zero ambience.  The heavy policing for seating turned me off big time.  We were told, scratch that, instructed that we need to go order food at the counter before taking seats.Because I try to be understanding, I recommend this place solely for take out."
"I can't comment on the service or surroundings (thanks, hubby!) but their brisket was some of the best I've ever had, as was the pulled pork. Both were incredibly moist with just the right amount of smoke. Delicious. The sides were not anything too special (mac n cheese, corn bread), but not bad. Everything was packaged really well though, and I'd certainly return over and over for that brisket. Yum!"
"This place might be one of the best bbq spots in Chicago. It is a bit of a drive but it is definitely worth it. You are greeted by a clean and casual atmosphere. Everything is labelled clearly-from instructions on ordering to the menu written on a huge blackboard wall. The people taking my order were pleasant, patient, and helpful. The place features a decent selection of bbq meats and has various combo options. I tried the pulled pork sandwich, the brisket chili, and the slaw. Everything was delicious! They actually use a decent bread roll for their sandwiches as opposed to sliced white bread that falls apart. The pork was flavorful and didn't need to be drowned in extra barbecue sauce. I appreciated the chili wasn't your same-old ground beef, and the slaw was not your usual mess of vague vegetables and cream. All the above merit this place a high rating. Yet, my praise does not end here. We arrived 30 minutes before closing and stayed at least another 20 after the kitchen closed. None of the staff tried to rush us, even after we had finished eating and were chatting oblivious to the emptying restaurant.I am often unaware of signs, for example, hours of operation. So (of course), right before we left, I decided that I wanted to try their dessert, an amazing pecan bread pudding with bourbon caramel sauce. A very pleasant lady told me their kitchen as well as registers were closed but gave me the dessert to take home. For Free!  I was basically a very (unintentionally) annoying customer right before closing and still received impeccable service. Thank you!Update: Went back and noticed that they have actually won several awards and are Zagat rated. It is all well-deserved."
I love this little hole in the wall restaurant!  They are very busy and the atmosphere is lively!  My brother and I got their pulled pulled combination sandwich with corn bread and Mac and cheese.  The pork tasted amazing and they come with bbq sauce on the side to add more.  They mac and cheese was baked in a small individual size container but I felt it was sufficient and tasty.  The corn bread was fresh and made with real corn.  There is indoor and outdoor seating and limited parking in the back.  Definitely a place to visit when I come into town!
"Ok, I was definitely skeptical about the whole ""Best BBQ in Chicago"" title.But alas. I have found my oasis of southern BBQ in Old Irving, right in the middle of the North side. Bonus points for the blue line. Bonus points for the 24 hour Pulaski bus. More bonus points for a short bus ride to a short bus ride to the HIP (just in case you wanted to shop til you drop as the food coma kicks in). Atmosphere: If you're like me and don't mind embarrassing your partner by eating like a caveman (who eats ribs with utensils anyway???), this place is perfect for dates IMO. Service was good, food was ready fast, dining area was clean, bathroom smelled like roses, decor is nice, portions are generous, and the price is right. I think I went on a Thursday evening and the place wasn't too packed. Not so sure about Saturday nights or anything like that.Now onto the food. I think that's the important part.To sum it up in one word: DAYUM.The ribs were on point. I ordered St. Louis ribs and my boyfriend had the baby backs. We agreed that both were delicious and tender (though I'd say I made the right choice! mmm fat)BBQ beans were great; not overwhelmed with tomato-ey flavor like at most places. The cornbread was legit. Even the slaw would be delicious if I didn't hate slaw. It was like a family dinner without the family (you decide if you like that idea).The only con besides the fact that they don't deliver was the saddest excuse for sweet tea I've had since the one time McDonalds accidentally gave me water. There was no sugar to fix it, just splenda. I wouldn't knock off a star for something like that, but I'd suggest bringing a packet or two of honey if you're a tea person. Otherwise, the fountain sodas are perfectly fine.It's good to bring some wet wipes too if you'd rather not succumb to the temptation of publicly licking your fingers, because if this isn't the best you've had it will at least be SOME of the best.5/5 wanted to cry."
"Of course I heard about Smoque from triple D. I HAD to try it. I haven't had BBQ in forever. My family came from WI to try it with me. (Also lovers of DDD) we walked in and immediately impressed. By the smell. We couldn't wait to order and shove our faces. When we finally got our food (not a long wait) we were totally impressed. Everyone got something different. Pulled pork sandwich, ribs, 1/2 chicken, brisket. All amazing. Everything melted in your mouth. I was even more impressed by the slaw. None of that fatty mayo slaw. This was fresh tasting and light. I would suggest planning not to eat for the next two days because you'll be too full for the next two days. Other food doesn't compare. :)"
"Awesome BBQ--love their brisket and pulled pork. Try both the Lousiana and Texan style sauces. Get the cornbread or mac n' cheese on the side. Their chili is awesome too! Can't go wrong--there may be a line out the door, but you'll know why, and it moves pretty fast."
"This place used to be a weekly stop for me and my family.  Im very displeased to have seen what i have because we loved their food so much however i can no longer subject my family to the sub par cleanliness smoques employees have.  When we were walking into the restaurant we witnessed one of there employees oht back with his hand inside his pants scratching himself.  He went so far as to inspect the underside of his fingernail after he was finished to see what it was he had picked off.  By the time it took me and my family to walk to the door and enter this employee had already assumed his position behind the counter and was handling meat.  He was the ONLY one there without gloves on, probably because he forgot but it was clear that he hadnt had enough time to wash his hands prior.  He was a very large heavy set man and when i pointed it out the employee at the register she apologized with a smile and thanked me for the info.  I do believe a supervisor overheard the convo but we left before anything was done, if they did anything.  This truly upsets me because this is probably  the best bbq in the city."
"Nothing much to say that hasn't been said by others. A few years ago, I would have reviewed Smoque as the bomb because good bar-b-que was still hard to find on the north/northwest side. These days, it holds up to its competitors (Rub's in my neighborhood). Brisket is the best choice and ribs come in a close second. Hand-cut fries and baked beans are delicious, but other sides are pretty average. Be prepared to wait in line almost any evening, but the staff works hard to keep everybody moving. Probably not the place if you're looking to linger over dinner."
"My addiction to Drive ins, Diners, and Dives brought me to this locale. It's funny how the Food Network can make anything look super tasty! I ultimately ventured here after an hour of CTA (my food obsession takes me places!) to Smoque. I got the sliced brisket platter with cole slaw, Mac and cheese, and cobbler. Hm... As a Texan though, I was slightly disappointed. I mean, I know REAL BBQ but I felt Smoque was very average. Sure, the meat was tender and tasty and the sauce was divine, but I was expecting out of the world flavor when I heard Smoque had the best BBQ in Chicago. The portions are also pretty small for the sides. I was underwhelmed by the Mac and cheese but it was my fault going in with high expectations. The peach cobbler was a nice ending to the meal. I loved the crunchy top. I was, however, impressed by the coleslaw! So light and refreshing. None of that mayonnaise junk. This seemed to make me feel like I'm eating healthy after a meal of Mac and cheese, brisket, and peach cobbler. That's all that counts right?"
"Best Brisket in town. Addicting sauce. Awesome sides. Well-priced. Nuff said. This place has the order and seating system down to a science, maximizing a tight space with frequent hordes of devotees, so don't be too afraid of the lines."
"Ordered a platter of 1/2 chopped brisket and 1/2 Texas sausage.  The price for the a la carte platter was very good (only $8.95 - 5 stars on value).  Food came out fairly quickly as well.The brisket was tenders, subtle hints of smoke throughout and lightly covered with a delicious sauce.  They also include a thick and slightly lighter bbq sauce on the side.  The brisket combined with the thicker sauce was amazing!  The Texas sausage had good flavor and smokiness.  It was as much of a showstopper as the brisket.I will come back - but next time just get the brisket.Food - 4 starsValue - 5 starsService - 5 stars (quick and people are friendly - even though its soft serve)."
So delicious!!! I loved the smoked flavor of the beans and mac n cheese. The sliced brisket sandwich is very filling. The customer service is great! Street parking is plentiful. I went on a Friday for lunch and was able to find seating.
"Is success going to their heads or is my initial infatuation with this place waning?  My last two visits to Smoque were ok.  The ambiance still rocks (who can't like sitting with your fellow Chicagoans at communal picnic tables chowing down on sloppy BBQ?)  While the food was still good this time I was struck by the sodium levels in nearly everything (rub on the ribs, beans, fries, etc.)  I drank water like a desert camel the whole night.Now, don't get me wrong.  This very well could be the best BBQ in the city.  In fact, we were in KC last year and compared theirs to Smoque.  Smoque won (or, at very best, tied) KC's best.  And, it's right here in our own back yard.Will I go back?  You betcha!  I'll just bring my water bottles for the ride home."
"Not nearly as good at Lilly's, and I'd argue that Smoke Daddy is even better.  BBQ is one of my favorite activities and foods--I try it all over the country (frequently in the deep South, but also Texas, Nashville, etc.), so I I wonder if people over rate this place because of it's hole-in-the-wall appeal (under a train track, by the highway, $9.95 spent on the interior decor, etc.)?  I tried the brisket and the pulled pork and was underwhelmed by both."
"Beef blessed by a priest? It quite possibly is here. Tender and juicy. Just what a slab of meat should be. The sides I've tried are excellent. The place can get quite crowded. Its ok though cause the brisket aroma will drown out their funk. Parking sucks around there. Only negative i can think of is introducing my father in law to this. Now every time i see him i get, "" wheres my smouqe biiiiiiiitch?""I just smile. The anger doesn't build up. I think."
"Smoque BBQ made sure they kepted me updated on the time and offered drinks during the wait. I had ribs, brisket and sausage. The reason for the wait is the customer service at the meat counter; worth it. Yum."
"LOVE THIS PLACE.Everything you get on the menu is good. We've had the pulled pork and brisket, both which have been phenomenal and I've heard the sausage is divine. This place is always crowded, even on a Tuesday night expect to wait in some sort of line. Summer it's out the door and maybe even to the corner. When you get close to the ordering, servers come up to you in line and ask you how many are in your party and reserve one of the tables for you by moving around chairs, etc....which is nice for a fast casual place because it takes the stress out of having good food but nowhere to sit. The sides that come with it are awesome. Mac and Cheese is your perfect BBQ place type of mac and cheese, and same for slaw & beans. You won't be disappointed with anything you get. It's a Chicago staple. Will be back here many times."
"This place probably don't need another raving review, but here's some tips!You can order before hand and just go and pick up! If you really want that Louisiana Ribs, ya better get there early!"
"I absolutely love this place!! The food is delicious and it's definitely worth the wait!!!! My favorite is the baby back ribs.. So smokey and tender. The Mac and cheese and baked beans are really good as well!! Come on in, and see for yourself!!!"
"After hearing from many people that Smoque has amazing bbq, we finally decided to try it. I should have paid more attention to the bad reviews on Yelp. It's not that anything was bad, per se, but the food was really not worth the hour wait and the rushed dining experience. We got the side salad, Texas sausage, pulled pork, sliced brisket, and a selection of sides (fries, mac and cheese, brisket chili, and corn bread). I have to say that the side salad was both huge and delicious. I also liked the Texas sausage and the mac and cheese and corn bread. But neither of the other two main dishes had much flavor and I've definitely had better elsewhere. I also thought it was crazy that the restaurant was out of St. Louis ribs by 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday. I dd think the staff was great, but that's not enough for me to come back."
"I'm not even sure why I'm going to make a yelp review for Smoque,  It has over 2500 reviews at this point, its been on tv, its been in the papers.  You either love the food, or you really like the food... OR you're a competitor giving a false review.  If you're on yelp and have been eating in Chicago for more than a few years and you have to look this place up because you don't know what it is, maybe its time for you to stop being on yelp.  5 stars, anything less than 3 from anyone is because they had a bad experience or smoked cigarettes for too long and ruined their taste buds."
"I placed an order for catering (pick-up).  I had called a few days before to see how much advance notice they needed to accommodate my order for pick-up on a Saturday afternoon.  No problem, they said.  Call the day ahead - whenever.  So easy.  I ordered several pounds of the various types of delicious meats as well as a few pans of their sides.  When I got there the place was a zoo. So many people waiting to order, sit, eat.  My pan of mac n' cheese had been forgotten and the nice manager (?) asked if I wanted to wait or to get a credit. I said I'd wait the 15-20 minutes or so.  When the order was ready, he gave me a gift certificate for my (minor) inconvenience. Yay!  More delish BBQ for my belly! Thanks Smoque!"
Honest review okay do not come here i was excited because they said this is the best barbeque in chicago its not at all trust me its supper expensive n the portions are so small m its a very small restaurant the entres were cold n gross the sides were great the bread puddin was great i would jus go back for the sides n that not the actual barbeque if u want the best barbeque go to hog wild on 157th its amaizing supper cheap n the portions are huge
The only thing I miss about my old job is working down the street from Smoque! There's another local BBQ place near my new job that makes me frown... :-( I'm definitely overdue for another BBQ/Briskit fix... :-D
Ribs and meats are good. I prefer real urban barbecue to the place but the place is much closer to me. Lines gets busy at times however once you order the wait for a table has not been that bad since the staff is paying attention to waiting folks and directing people traffic. I kind of feel pressured to leave when here but they are busy and trying to accommodate standing customers. Food is ok but not the best. I usually have food that is not as warm as I expect r get from other places. Check your orders as I have had the wrong kind of ribs more then a few times. real urban barbecue is still my prefers overall choice. Btw: no parking and parking near by is horrible.
"We wanted to visit Smoque since seeing it on Triple D. We finally made it on a Saturday evening after a Cubs game. The wait was about 45 minutes to place our order, which isn't bad considering their popularity. Once ordered we were immediately seated at a table outside and our food was ready within 15 minutes. The staff are excellent with customer service and friendly enough too. We shared sliced brisket, chicken, mac and cheese, baked beans, slaw, and the peach cobbler. It all was good, but I had personal preferences that stopped it from being great for me. I prefer creamy cole slaw and theirs is vinegary, and the baked beans were really soupy. Glad we got to go and experience it, but the general agreement is we wouldn't go out of our way to do so again."
"I picked up dinner the other day. I got the beef brisket which was just full of fat. The ribs were good, I would recommend ordering those. The pulled pork was very dry. I wouldn't recommend that. The corn bread was very good, and if you like smoky baked beans then you would like those. I was disappointed because I love smoked meats."
i ordered rib combo which really delicious!!And it's perfectly enough for 2 people.Meat is soft and melt in my mouth. I love it!Everything there was great except noise in the restaurant! Group of people behind my table talked too loud so i think it would be better for sitting outside the restaurant
"It kind of gets packed to get seating during their busy hours.Their smoked meat is tender and delicious, it doesn't feel like you're eating a lot. The perfect sides are mac n cheese & baked beans. Wish I lived closer enough to go here every day."
"My husband and I absolutely love this place.  We order the same thing everytime: Pulled BBQ sandwich with fries and/or MAC & Cheese.  The food here is so FRESH, great flavor with generous amount of meat and fries with your order.Is it always packed? Long lines? YES and YES.  But for a reason!  This place is the bomb! I'm so glad they finally got their permit for outdoor seating, its not only nice to sit out and enjoy your meal, but its even better not having to wait forever for a table!The price is great for the quality of the food you are getting. Parking is BRUTAL.  They have a tiny shared lot that with a time zone, so beware.Best BBQ place is town!"
Good brisket. Ribs are good too but not the best I've had. The old man owner freaks me out. If you want to stare at your customers and ask weird questions please take a seat away from the long line that is soon to be lining your pockets. At least some breathing room while we wait for all that meat!
"For my money, this is THE best BBQ in the city, although there are several places that are a close second. Pulled pork has a great smoky flavor with some burnt strands for added flavor. Vinegar sauce is almost as good as we had when we lived in Carolina. Brisket is also smoky with burnt crust, and very tasty with their sweet sauce. Texas sausage has a nice spicy kick too.Service was great but it's always packed so be prepared to wait your turn. Parking is tough but that's because it's so popular. Highly recommended."
"All around, very very solid. Quality food at a reasonable price. Holding me back from 5 stars was the rub used for the ribs. I felt it was a little bland I wanted something more. Aside from that, the brisket and pulled pork were great, both were cooked very well and tasted great. I loved the pecan bourbon bread pudding they had on special that day, too."
"The food is delicious, no servers. You order. pick it up and grab a seat. crowded at lunch time and the line is around the corner on the weekends. I recommend a week night, unless you have the wait time. The food is affordable. The pulled pork and brisket..oh my goodness!the sides. Meh. but who's here for sides?!My kids love the food here, they eat it with and without sause. I eat it all :)"
"Smoque BBQ may be the best BBQ in the city!  It's delicious and never too heavy.  The large menu board, written on the wall, lets you pair many of the meats together so you can better get a taste of what they have.  I wish this place was closer to downtown so I could go more often!"
"We decided to take the 1 hour round trip trek to Smoque based on the fantastic reviews that we've seen on Trip Advisor and many other outlets! We were NOT disappointed! There were three of us, so we got to sample the St Louis ribs, brisket, cole slaw, baked beans, macaroni and cheese, and peach cobbler. Everything was excellent!! The ribs just fell off the bones. The brisket literally melted in your mouth! Everything was brought out while it was still so hot , you had to wait a bit for it to cool down. My only regret is that this place is halfway across the country!"
Great food and funky casual atmosphere.  You order your food then wait for a table.  Your food it served on small sheet pans.  Great sauces and great staff.  Parking can be a challenge but worth it.
"If there was ever a place to entice every one of your senses, this is it.  The smell of rich, hearty smoked meat hits you the moment you walk up to the small, acquainted building.  Although seating is limited, the eat-and-go method seems to work out to everyone's favor.  Anticipate a wait - as the line exceeds out the door.  Smoked brisket, chopped or sliced, pulled pork and half of a chicken are all listed as favorites.  Creamy macaroni and cheese and soft bread pudding are must-trys.Bottom line, although the food was GOOD and the service was undoubtedly fast, the hype of this place was met with disappointment.  My taste buds will be venturing elsewhere."
"Going early on a Sunday was great idea! No wait at all :) Best bbq in town hands down. I like the sliced brisket, hubby likes the pulled pork. Sometimes I have a sandwich and sometimes I do the platter. You really can't go wrong either way, probably just depends on how hungry you are. This last trip we tried a cheddar jalapeno sausage link that was AWESOME!  Really tasty, little spicy, great real cheese flavor. Their coleslaw is amazing- vinegar based, no mayo, tangy and delicious. It's BYO which is always nice. We live really close so we typically take it to go.  However, for a to-go order, you will want to plan ahead! We've been told anywhere from 45-90 mins and that's for a pickup, not delivery.  When the time is right, it's a must try...if you haven't been there already. :)"
"Ranked one of the top restaurants in Chicago it was long over due that I have never been here . I have only had this type off BBQ in stl and I loved it! Driving down Pulaski you might miss it there's no sign or anything that sticks out. I got the sliced beef brisket with a portion of pulled pork. The beef was good tender. Although my favorite was the pulled pork it had a lot more flavor. Mac and cheese was standard. The beans were ok they had a strong smoky flavor that was overboard to me. But I loved how the coleslaw was fresh and crunchy and not soggy like many places. Finish all that with a sweet peach cobbler and it's a wrap! Really homey food that will put you to sleep after. Unfortunately I have to end this by saying stl BBQ is much better ( pappys, sugarfire) that's hard to say being born and raised here my whole life and cubs fan lol but my stomach doesn't lie. Overall a must try!! Ps wish they had more sauces!"
"Girlfriend and I drove up the highway for smoked meat on Sunday, from one of Chicago's most popular restaurants. I dropped off the dry cleaning and navigated the Kennedy while she placed the order by phone. When we arrived at Smoque, I parked outside. It was about 5PM and there was a line way out the door. I asked the busser how to deal with the line- he directed me right in to the register. Minutes later we were on the Irving Park road to Portage Park for some BBQ in the grass.The trees were greened out in buds and baby leaves. The grass was lush and the ground was dry. We got two slabs of St. Louis style ribs with creamy crusty edged mac and cheese, not-sweet cornbread, well seasoned fries and peach cobbler, which we got to later. Actually there was cole slaw too, but haven't got to that yet either. The ribs were unbelievable, pink smoke ring, so much smoky flavor that my hands still smell like a campfire. They need no sauce. I ate half the slab and was so full I meat-tripped the rest of the afternoon well into the evening.Boss and I made a bet- she said the leaves would be in full bloom next week and I said this week."
The ribs are really good. I had the baby back ribs with a side of mac n cheese and chilli. The mac n cheese is the best. It's a must try if you have not already.
"Best BBQ in Chicago if you ask me. As a girl, the meat isn't fat packed (it's all melted off), the sides aren't too large, and the BBQ sauce is delicious. Parking is a nightmare and the place is obviously way too small for the amount of business they do -- but what good restaurant isn't too small! I swear it's all in their plan.. The catering is very convenient and well organized too. I order it often for parties of 4 or more people and it's just as good, to-go."
"5 stars for food.  3 stars for service/pickup orders. If you want to avoid the lines call in for pickup.  However, it may take up to 1.5 hours for you to pick up.  Sometimes the STL ribs have way too much fat on it, but majority of the time they are the best in Chicago."
"Come there to try ribs and burgers with my family. They tasted really good. Does not mattet it is weekends or weekday, the store is still busy with a long line. Good foods and great service. Will be back for sure."
"Great, yummy, scrumptious barbecue! That's is all. Try it, you won't regret it. Ribs, brisket, and pulled pork are excellent. Do it!"
"For a first visit, Smoques was good...not five star good but decent enough to warrant 3 stars. First the staff was efficient and courteous. There was a wait but we didn't mind because the staff was really good about keeping us informed and seating us promptly once a table for 6 opened up. The prices were a bit high but not totally unexpected for city eating. Now I got the pulled pork, my boys ribs and husband the brisket. We agreed that the bbq was good not great. The meat was tender but like the other items on the plate ie mac, cobbler and coleslaw could use a deeper flavor profile especially in the smoke department....at the very least more salt and I am not big on salt! The Memphis sauce left a bad taste in my mouth but I kept trying to eat it due to the need for more flavor. The Carolina sauce was decent. Overall it was a good experience."
"The barbecue here is great. It's not a sitdown place, you are your food at the counter and then pick it up and say where you like. very busy place, give yourself a little extra time if you're going to eat here. Menu isn't that large but there's many great things to choose from. Our food came out fast and hot which is always a plus. The brisket was great melts in your mouth like none other I've had before. they only had one barbecue sauce, for a barbecue place you think they'd have more options.The barbecue beans are awesome to pull pork sandwich was great. Mac & cheese was well done to simple but elegant. Fast  clean and friendly. Highly recommend trying this place if you're in the area, especially if you're in the barbecue."
"Oh...my...God! This place is by far the best BBQ in the Chicago area. I traditionally get brisket orders for Easter dinner & my family salivates over it. When I picked it up today I noticed they had Pecan Bread pudding. Nobody likes bread pudding as much as me and its remarkable how different it is everywhere. I just got 1 order and ate it when I got home. By far the best bread pudding in the area. You will be very happy with your choices here. Enjoy. Parking can be a challenge, but its definitely worth it."
Mmmmmm brisket. Smoque is probably my favorite bbq joint. Don't waste valuable stomach space with bread.. skip the brisket sandwich and go for the brisket platter. The mac and cheese is my favorite side. I'm hungry.
"I had heard so much about Smoque from friends as soon as I moved to Chicago, and it took me about a year to get here. I came here one evening by myself (for the first time) when I was feeling blue...and boy, did it turn my frown upside down!I got the sliced brisket with slaw and two sides and it was pretty glorious. The brisket itself was just...falling apart in my fork and the sauce was wonderful. The sides were perfect portions. I got the mac & cheese (awesome, piping hot, and breaded on top) and the BBQ beans. I took my meal to go and walked about 1 block before I dug in. I did cool down a bit but it was still awesome. I think everybody should go here by themselves at least once so they can enjoy this meal in silence. I can't wait to go back for MORE BEEF."
"Service is terrific! If I lived near the area, I'd be a daily diner. After trying multiple items on their menu (the owner let me have a sampler), I'd say that EVERYTHING is worth getting, but my favorite is brisket. The owner found out that I liked spicy things, so he added some candied jalepenos to my plate. YUM!Thanks again Smoque -- we'll be back every time we're in the area."
"Been here several times and now I can compare it to the ones in the south. Brisket lacks flavor compared to others I've had. It was tender but doesn't jump out at you when you bit into it. Not as good a cut of meat either .Baby back ribs were tough not fall off the bone like I thought and expected. Brother had St Louis ribs and they were great. Cole slaw is just OK, mac n cheese is pretty good, I like how they bake it. They would have got 4 stars."
"Everyone knows the food is unmatched, this review is about the service that we witnessed this past Father's Day. It was busy as usual and the line wrapped around the building and everyone was told about an hour wait. An elderly couple both with canes decided to enjoy the food and proceeded to join the line. Well one of the staff radioed in and one of the owners came out and sat the couple down right away. He also gave them menus, took their order, and served them their food and drinks. You do not see this level of service in many places and my family and I appreciated experiencing this kind gesture.  We love this place even more now and will continue to eat here as long as we can. Thank you staff of Smoque for going above and beyond."
"I have eaten at Smoque more than once - every single time I go to City Smiles next door, I eat at Smoque after. Thats right. I pay money to get my teeth cleaned by professionals (City Smiles has a death metal dentist on staff 5/5) I eat enough ribs to satiate even the most grotesque of appetites.Again, I PAY MONEY TO HAVE PROFESSIONALS CLEAN MY TEETH WITH TOOLS THEN I PISS THAT PROGRESS AWAY AT SMOQUE.Don't even look at the menu while standing in line (on the queue?) for food. Make sure your eyes are glossed and your saliva is viscous. Idle in the line until you order RIBS AND BEANS, then sit down (you get slaw, don't even ask). You will be seated next to the most obvious stereotypes. These people will be loud, well-scootered, and frothing about their jowls. Play the part. You are with these people. They are your peers. Eat and enjoy. Return constantly."
"I'm a huge fan of BBQ and always make an effort to try new places when I travel for business. If there's BBQ being served, I'll give it a try.  I've been to the well known ""hot spots"" such as Austin, Memphis and Kansas City to little known places for BBQ such as Green Bay - and yes, this place loves up to the hype.First off, you WILL wait in line. There is always a line.  And yes, the place is small so if you don't like making new friends and/or have personal space issues, this may not be the place for you.  It's also no frills, it's all about the BBQ here.  All that being said, it is hands down the best BBQ place in Chicago and would give some of the places I've been to in Dallas, Austin and/or KC a legit run for the money.Brisket, BBQ pork, BBQ turkey, ribs, fries, Mac n cheese and peach cobbler are all amazing. Love BYOB so I can bring along some of my hop bomb beers that pair so well with BBQ.Been there a dozen times and have brought along friends and family. Worth the visit - and wait."
Love the brisket and mac n cheese!I usually pickup and go cause this place always seems to be packed.
"Places like Smoque make me truly grateful for Chicago's amazing food scene. I had tried Smoque twice before as carry-out and was not that impressed. I went with friends again for round three for Sunday night dinner and had my faith re-established in Smoque. As other reviewers have said, their seating system works when the place is packed because they take your name at the door and the # of ppl in your party. And you will get seated by the time you're done ordering. Don't fret. As for the BBQ, I decided on the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich option, which I got half pulled pork and chopped brisket. Both were amazingly flavorful and juicy, and had a good amount of fatty juice that made it extra tasty. I also sampled the sliced brisket which is truly a work of art, gleaming pink meat with a beautiful charred black outside. Sides: I tried the mac and cheese (delicious), cornbread (pretty good), bbq beans (smoky, sweet and delicious), chili (just fine), fries (pretty good), cole slaw is sliced thin and vinegary (perfect compliment to the bbq). Sauces: Definitely prefer the spicy sauce, it is thicker, sweeter, and bolder. The Carolina sauce is more watery and vinegary. We also tried the candied jalapenos that were hanging out by the cashier, definitely try them with your bbq! Solid, solid place in our beautiful city. Will definitely return when I am having meat cravings."
"Best bbq.  Love the salad too.  It is always packed so my advice, call ahead to order."
"For openers, if you think the best barbecue is usually found in the worst part of town, in a place with bars on the windows and just enough grease on the table to write your initials, then this isn't it.If, on the other hand, you're in Chicago and wander a few blocks off the Kennedy onto Pulaski in a neat little neighborhood and you can find a parking place  (a real problem ) then BBQ Smoque will serve you well.This is Texas style barbecue in the hear6t of the Midwest, except here they use apple wood rather than mesquite and the flavor shows.Count on standing in line to place your order, and then standing around to pick up your order when your number is called. And no grabbing a table in the interim. They have folks who will try to be polite telling you they'll show you where to sit, but only when your food is ready.  Inside, maybe seating for  50 at tables for two that can be pushed together, and outside maybe enough for 25 more.The menu is on a blackboard. The prices more than fair for the quality.We tried the chicken, pork (pulled), brisket (chopped), and ribs (St. Louis cut) and the table was divided as to which topped the list... but even the number four choice was better than just good.  Personally, the chopped brisket was exceptional. Full flavor, just enough fat to keep it moist and chopping the brisket helps avoid those dry, stringy slices you can sometimes get off the end.The ribs had a nice thick coat of rub and were smoked to nearly perftection. Tender but not falling off the bone - always a giveaway that they've been parboiled or baked in advance of the grill.   The pulled pork was very good, and the chicken was equally as good.  Go for a combo plate and you can help but come out with a great meal.Smoque's hand cut french fries are world class; no need to say more. The baked beans were fair to middlin', the slaw was thin sliced cabbage in a vinegar based sauce with thin slices of a red onion; different and better than a lot of them.   The mac-n--cheese was a great choice with a crispy top.They have a couple of sauces, and here comes a complaint: one is called a Memphis style sauce (thick , fairly sweet tomato), the other a Carolina sauce which means there's vinegar involved.  They decide which you'd prefer based on your order; you wouldn't use the Carolina red with chicken... but what they don't do is let you decide how much of either you want to use.  They put a shot on your order and a little plastic cup with what they think goes well, and you've got to go back and ask (and ask again if you want more) for any extra.   Why not put two containers on each table and let folks serve themselves?  It's got to be cheaper than buying thousands of those little plastic gizmos, and there'd be fewer people trying to get back to the counter.For most true barbecue lovers, the drink of choice is either a cold beer or sweet tea and it's in that department that Smoque misses out on the fifth star.  Their sweet tea is colored water with not enough flavor to pass the blindfolded taste test. And what's with those three gulp paper cups they provide for your drinks? Having to stand in line for refills (the tea and soft drink dispenser are in a crowded corner) is an unnecessary waste of time (always a long line waiting) and results in the table being tied up longer than necessary.  Bigger glasses please.   The service is self, so there's not much to say about their folks except they're all friendly and eager to help answer questions for first timers. The p;lace is kept clean despite the volume of barbecue lovers who find their way to Pulaski Street.For someone who has spent a lifetime in pursuit of the perfect barbecue (read reviews of 60+ other barbecue joints across the country), I'd have to say while Smoque isn't it...  it is awfully close.  Once you've found a parking place and made it inside, stay away from the diluted sweet tea, order extra sauce from the get go, and get set to savor some very good cue."
"Recently went here over the past weekend and I must say I was impressed. It's a little hard to spot when coming off I-94 (I got turned around twice trying to find it) but once you do you'll love what you have found. The menu is displayed on huge chalkboards along with the prices to give a old lunch pal kind of mojo for customers and I like it. I ordered the brisket platter with a side of mac and cheese and french fries, it comes with a side of cole slaw as well. The portions are HUGE here and worth every penny. The brisket was the best I have ever had (this is my first time trying brisket though), the mac and cheese was awesome and the fries as well. I was surprised by the cole slaw because most food places just drop a cup full of mayo and call it a day but not Smoque. You can taste the freshness of the veg they used for it as well as the vinegar. The waiters/hostess/tray pickerupers were amazing as well."
"I liked Smoque a lot, but for all the hype I've heard, it fell just short.Ordered the half brisket half pork sandwich. Both meats were incredibly tasty with a little side of tangy sweet BBQ sauce. The mac and cheese was very good, but a little on the pricey side for what you got.Will definitely be back to try the peach cobbler."
"The food here is good. But as my husband and I made the trek back to Bucktown after standing in line for an hour just to order, we both came to the same conclusion: we can eat bbq just as good, if not better, much closer to home. (Lillie's Q, The Smoke Daddy)We wanted to try as much meat as possible, so we covered the pulled pork, sliced brisket, Texas sausage and St. Louis style ribs.Of the four, the only pure standout was the brisket. Amazingly tender and its sauce was just sweet enough. The casing on the sausage was thick, making it tough to chew. The ribs were a little on the chewy side but very flavorful. The pulled pork was forgettable.Sides: beans were disappointingly bland, brisket chili was good and the mac n cheese was phenomenal.If you're in the area and don't mind waiting, go for it. If it's going to mean a train ride or drive, I'm sure there's something quite comparable closer to where you live."
The fatty juicy brisket was awesome! The chicken was great! But the best part? The fresh cut French fries!!! Those fries will keep me craving for them even after I get back to NYC! AND ALL OF IT WAS GLUTEN FREE!!! fries have their own separate fryer.
Best brisket.  Melted in my mouth just perfect.  Got it with baked bean and macaroni and cheese and I was in heaven.  Ate the entire thing too because it was just so good.  Prices are very fair.  Line can be long but moves quickly.  I like that they find a table for you so you don't have to hover around to snag a table.  Definitely go here!
"BBQ !!!! Best in Chi-town according to Yelp, and food channel. We arrived at Smoque BBQ around 1 pm on Saturday. It was not packed at all. I ordered Sliced Brisket Platter, it came with slaw and 2 sides, I chose Cornbread and Peach Cobbler (sweet dessert). The brisket was moist and tender, also it had deep and rich smoke flavor. Dunking the brisket into the BBQ sauce or spicy BBQ sauce it made your meal completed. The Coleslaw was fresh and it was without mayo, unlike the usual one. The cornbread was amazed. It was moist, and crumbly. For the dessert, peach cobbler, it was new to me, it was rich and delicious. This place was absolutely better than The Smoke Daddy which next to where i lived. Maybe the portion was bigger, but the quality was bad. At last, the service was very efficient and attentive here."
So delicious!!! Everything on the menu is great but my usual is the brisket with macaroni and cheese and I ALWAYS get the peach cobbler!  Great staff and even better food. Great place to take out of town guests or friends from the suburbs as this establishment has be recognized on many food TV shows.
"It was OK. Not what I thought it was going to be. The food shows and friends who've gone thought it was great, and don't get me wrong it is, but the portions are small and the prices don't follow...It was, however good enough for me to go back. Just don't expect it to blow you away."
"This place is the bomb! Seriously the best BBQ in Chicago. Snowier has been featured on shows like Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.The ribs are great, but the brisket is better than most that I have had in Texas. For those who don't know Texas brisket, just think about the most tender, juiciest beef with a good smoke flavor. The bark (or crust) is good enough to be served as a dish by itself. It is juicy, fatty, perfectly crusted goodness.If you get the ribs, don't settle for the baby backs (which are still tasty). The Kansas City style ribs have more meaty, BBQ flavor. Why settle for less when you can have more?The pulled pork is also very good. It's like a North Carolina style pulled pork, but without as much clear, vinegar sauce. I like my NC BBQ very vinegary and sweet. The red sauce that Smoque uses is good but not as authentic.The sides are also extraordinary. I esp. like the mac and cheese, which are served in individual tins--creamy, cheesy goodness in a cup. Their beans are also great. They use leftover beef brisket in the beans for extra flavor, texture, and goodness.They have a couple of BBQ sauces, one for the pulled pork and one for everything else. Their house sauce is sweet with a hint of cola (trust me it's good).Smoque was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, in one of the earliest seasons. It lives up to its reputation. It is my favorite BBQ joint in Chicago, and there is a ton of good BBQ here."
"This place is fantastic! So good!There's usually a line to get in, but why wouldn't there be?"
"Best BBQ I have EVER had.  Better than the Salt Lick in Austin, TX.  Order ahead.  Line is usually out the door."
"I have been here three times, all during dinner hours.Smoque is one of the most popular barbecue restaurants in the city.  They don't take reservations, they seat and move people in and out.  If you are going during dinner plan on standing in a line all the way out the door and weather will not scare people away.  They will ask you how many are in your party if you are dining in and you will have a chance to order before being seated.  Usually by the time you order a table is made available for you.  You will be given a number so it is important that you keep your ears open as it can become quite loud in this restaurant.  The staff is very professional and they know how to keep people moving.  I've had the pulled pork sandwich and the sliced brisket sandwich with all of the different sides.  Everything on this menu is exceptional.  Even the slaw is good for someone who doesn't really care for coleslaw.  The meat is savory and tender with just the right amount of sauce.  They offer you a cup of additional sauce if you want to add more.  All the food is served on a metal cafeteria like plate with a sheet up cooking paper.  A nice touch to the scrappy eat with your hands kind of meal.  Smoque can be kind of expensive but at least you are getting what you pay for.  For $10-15 you will not be disappointed as this is by far the best BBQ in the city."
"This place deserves every bit of their 5 stars...FAST COUNTER SERVICE... Minimum wait for food maybe is 10 minutes, maybe.Food is always hot and taste fresh, even if in warmer for an extended period of time.Service : Always top notch, great staff, period, attentive and nice... You can always county on seeing one of the partners standing around in his usual eye glasses and Bluetooth in his ear overseeing everything, always willing to lend a helping hand or smile.Crowds - This place gets crowded sometime and you may have to stand outside, this place isn't big... Go during a non-peak hour.Food - Ribs, Brisket, Baked Beans, Macaroni and Cheese, Peach Cobbler are all TOP NOTCH! Perfect smoke flavor and visible pink smoke rings... Hell, the fries are even good, I can eat the fries all day and they give you a bag of them.BREAD PUDDING - PLEASE MAKE THIS A REGULAR... VERY DECADENT and DELICIOUS!! Official menu item! Make sure you get it if they are still serving it.Negative - It's way up north (irving park area) so it's not convenient unless you live near there. It's worth the trip but I mean, I'm looking forward to the time they relocate out south for us south siders. BBQ is getting big in Chicago, but only some meet the cut. Many newcomers are food truck ppl and novices, these people are killing the game right now. Don't be fooled by Q in the Goldcoast, Husky Hog in Bridgeport, or some of these uppity and expensive downtown and west loop places like Green Street Smoked Meats... This place has the QUALITY and FLAVOR at a great value, if not less than the competitors, the consistency of the food is always there. If these guys moved to the Beverly area of Chicago, or even the up and coming Bronzeville or Hyde Park area, business would boom as there is a lack of good BBQ places, just hood bbq places that are take out (which are ok, especially Uncle John's on Cottage Grove) but not the most ideal....Hey Smoque Owners, if you're reading this, check out the recently departed and vacant Panera bread space on 95th and Claremont in Beverly or the vacant used-to-be starbucks across the street or the vacant spots on 99th, 103rd, or 107th and Longwood off these metra stations, plenty of parking."
The is the best BBQ I've had in chicago.  I grew up traveling between Kansas City and Memphis a lot but as an adult I've also gained a taste for carolina gold and texas brisket.  Smoque is the only place that gets the meat perfect..in that texas brisket kind of way.  The chicken is also freaking delicious (How often do you say that about a BBQ joint) I avoided it for years due to the hype but that was at my own expense...Smoque is the best in the area.
"Awesome BBQ place! I had the half and half combo which includes half a brisket sandwich and half a pulled pork sandwich, slaw, and a side. I got the mac and cheese for a side and it was very good with a baked crispy top. The brisket was the winner of the meal and I also tried a friend's peach cobbler which was amazing. Good portions, decent price, and the outside seating was great for such a perfect summer day. Also very quick service."
BBQ without the drama or flair. What BBQ should be.
"Fabulous....definitely worth the wait!!It's craziness in there, wall to wall people and the line is out the door.We live within walking and smelling distance.... :)We love it!"
"Delicious smells and even better BBQ.  Worth the drive up there.  I've never actually eaten in but have gotten take-out numerous times and done catering once.As for the sides, the cole slaw is a must.  The beans are also very good.   Cornbread is fine if you're into cornbread."
"So me and the BF made the trek from Oak Park to pick up Smoque. Real pain to get there, but worth it, right? Well, yes and no. BF got the chopped brisket. A+. I got the full rack of ribs and gotta say, disappointed. First, they seemed overcooked. Second, they were not especially meaty. Really? Come on, Smoque! And they are pretty much the priciest thing on the menu, so I expected more. Will be back, someday (it's a long drive) but I think I'll stick to Q in La Grange. Way closer and honestly? Just as good."
"I have eaten at and carried out from the N Pulaski location.  Delicious! Fast Service! Dine in or carry out!  We love the pulled pork and beef brisket; the ribs are also over the top, yummy.  We rarely eat dessert, and always enjoy Smoque's peach cobbler. The only thing I want is a small green dinner salad instead of the cole slaw.CJC"
"I had been hearing great things about the new BBQ joint, Smoque,  but also heard it had been really crowded since it opened.  I decided to wait a few months before attempting to go since I don't like crowds or waiting for food when I'm hungry.  We happened to be in the area recently.  It was a weekday and around closing time and thought it was a perfect opportunity to finally try it.  It wasn't crowded at all and it only took about 15 minutes to get our order.  We tried the brisket, St. Louis ribs, pulled pork, macaroni, baked beans, and corn bread.  Wow.  It was all very good, but I especially loved the ribs.  I love ribs, but the smoky smell and flavor of these were unlike any I had ever had.  I found myself daydreaming of these ribs and decided to try them for a party about a month later.  We catered from Smoque and had the same items as above plus the coleslaw.  Everyone loved the food.  My husband picked up the food and I highly recommend getting the styrofoam containers to keep the food warm. The food stayed very warm until it was ready to serve about 2 hours later.  Don't throw away the containers though.  They charge an arm and a leg for them.  Eating this food made me go out and get my husband a smoker for his birthday last month.  I'm hoping he can replicate  some of the flavors of this place."
Food is delicious. Order the baby back full slab.
"wow, some of these comments are pretty false, i had to speak up. i live in socal now and still dream of smoque. best brisket! best mac and cheese! and please make room for that peach cobbler... i've been to a lot of bbq spots and smoque blew my mind. yes, there is a wait but its BYOB, take advantage of that, the awesome BBQ, and the awsome company you bring to eat with you. we love smoque so much, hubby will be ordering catering from them for my birthday =)"
"Needs some serious redecorating ,but the food was pretty good I had the chicken and my partner had the baby back ribs that he thoroughly enjoyed...."
"Since my last review here was four years ago and I visited again tonight, I thought I would provide an update. The St. Louis ribs are so worth it. They're meatier than baby backs and they indeed fall off the bone. The spice blend is enough to wake the meat up, but is by no means overpowering. I also wanted to mention I tried their new dessert: the pecan bread pudding. I have to admit it surpasses the peach cobbler, which I was already a fan of. Toasted pecans, caramel, a moist cake. For less than $2.50? This dessert is a must-get! Smoque is still the best BBQ I have found in Chicagoland and I can't imagine anything taking its place."
"Too good.I am a household of 2. It's 25 min to get to Smoque though, so everytime we go there we order $60-70 of food and take the rest home. We get an extra 2-3 meals out of it, so it's great value.You can't go wrong with anything, but I highly recommend the ribs and the sausages. The peach cobbler is a very nice surprise!"
"Good bbq.  I got the 1/2 and 1/2 platter.  The bbq sauce is tasty.  Ice tea not freshly brewed, which is a plus for bbq.  BYOB which I never argue with.  Helping Chicago bbq prestige!"
"Best BBQ I have ever had.The brisket is amazing! as for sides, I recommend the mac and cheese.Do NOT miss the candied jalapenos!"
"AWESOME BBQ!!!!!!Went here during my trip to see Michigan-Notre Dame football, NOTRE DAME WON!!! :) :) The BBQ in this place was FABULOUS!!! I had the brisket platter with mac&cheese and cole slaw as my sides. It comes with delicious hot corn bread. I am pretty sure they use cream style corn in the mixture. The brisket with their sauce, very tasty, on it was so tender it was hard to pickup with my fork so I used my personal ones, MY FINGERS!!! I also tasted the pulled pork and the St. Louis style ribs and was NOT disappointed. The pulled pork was smoky, moist and delicious. The ribs were pull-away from the bone heavenly!!! I highly, highly recommend going here if you are ever in Northwest Chicago. FYI, no alcohol sold here but it is BYOB but you can't sit outside with your adult beverages but that will not take away from having great BBQ here!!!!"
I think my first sentence sums it up. Thank goodness we had a choice beyond Fast food. The parking is in the back and abundant. All of us enjoyed our meals.
"The BBQ was delicious! We easily waited 45 minutes to order and be seated on a Saturday evening, but it was definitely worth the wait!!  We tried a lot of food and most enjoyed the ribs and pulled pork. The sides were nice compliments to the BBQ."
"I enjoy the food here, but I don't think they have enough options. I last had their food yesterday; Mother's day. At opening time, I wasn't able to place my order for pickup over the phone, because they were backed up with orders. Someone had to go place the order in person and then wait around.I had the sliced brisket sandwich, as usual. I don't like pork or chicken, so there are not many choices. It was good, a nice portion of meat, and the bread was soft. The meat isn't very flavorful, and I had to sprinkle some salt. The fries were good, but could use some salt.The macaroni was good, but the portion is too small. I don't like that it's in an aluminum container, because you can't microwave it. If you don't eat it while it is hot, you have to turn on the oven, unless you want to lose most of it by trying to spoon it out onto a plate.Others had the pulled pork. I don't like pork, but theirs isn't porky. The baked beans were OK. They had a bread pudding special. It was good, I never had bread pudding before. It had an extreme amount of butter, and an even more extreme amount of sugar. I imagine one portion had at least 900 calories."
THE BEST.That is a lll that needs to be said
"I'm not sure what all the hoopla is about. The brisket was pretty good, the ribs were nothing special, the sauces sucked, and the BBQ beans were the best part.Not sure why all the TV guys rave about this place, there's better out there."
"Often when I have driven by Smoque, there is always a long line out the door. Could the barbeque be ""that"" good? Are people really that anxious to get barbeque at Smoque as opposed to anywhere else? The answer to both questions is yes.Pulled pork barbeque sandwich. Homemade macaroni and cheese. Baked beans. Peach cobbler.The sandwich was worthy. Must admit the sauce was thin, although flavourful. He macaroni and cheese was more creamy than stringy, but that was fine. The baked beans had me won over from the first spoonful. As to the peach cobbler, it needed a scoop of ice cream.You have to be patient to get into Smoque. Food comes fast once you're in, though. It's worth it. I even allowed pork in my diet this one time for the sake of experiencing Smoque."
Clearly the best BBQ in Chicago. Baby back ribs are excellent.
"Too much hype! BBQ is good, but certainly not worth the long lines, high prices and small portions. And if you're lucky enough to get a seat after waiting in a long line and spending $30 for a plastic tray with a small portion of BBQ, the cafeteria-style seating sucks. We were packed in like sardines at long tables and bright lights. Save time and money by skipping this place. BBQ - 3 starsValue - 2 starsDining area - no stars"
"YUM, YUM and YUM!! excellent BBQ brisket and ribs! there's always a line, but its worth the wait. We always pick up the food and enjoy the feast at home. Place is way to busy to sit down."
"It's pretty good but I have definitely had better. I wouldn't wait 30 mins in line for it. There was no line, no wait. I guess 3p was a good time because I didn't see any of the crowd that's been raved about. Found a park easily on the side. Walked right in, ordered and was seated. Pleasant staff, clean. Nice sized portions but it definitely wasn't what it's been hyped up to be. Would I eat there again? Sure... If I'm in the area but I wouldn't take another 40 minute trip just out the blue."
"Smoque is one of if not the best bbq place in Chicago. From the minute you walk inside, the place smells delicious! The place is every welcoming and the employees make you feel very welcome. But on to the food, I had the combo rib platter with the brisket platter that came with bbq bean, beans were bomb by the way!! Also got coleslaw and chili. Everything was delicious and can't wait to go back!!"
"If you want to eat BBQ and cry tears of happiness, Smoque is the place. This is legitimately the most mouth watering, most delicious BBQ around. In my group we got pulled pork, the Texas sausage, and sliced brisket last time I was there. I can literately eat these items every meal and not be sick of it. Smoque, you are doing everything right in your food.Only thing I am confused about is why they don't either expand or get a larger place. It is a bit cramped in the restaurant. But once you take a bite of the food, you're not even thinking about where you are. I cannot explain thoroughly how amazing this food is."
"As I am back at home in LA, I crave Smoque BBQ... It was one of the best things I tried in Chicago. When I went in for lunch, there was hardly a line and it moved very quickly. They take the party number in order to guarantee a spot before your food comes out. The prices at Smoque BBQ are extremely reasonable and the quantity of a full rack of ribs is perfect for two to share. We ordered an extra side of brisket with our ribs, and I completely recommend this! It is the softest most delicious brisket I have ever tasted. They have a variety of barbecue sauces so make sure you try them all! Eat the meat with the jalapeños, because that is what makes it delicious. It brings that crunch to BBQ. The sides are much smaller than anticipated but the portion of the meat was big enough to cover our appetite. The mac and cheese is much too cheesy, the corn bread is amazing, the fries are perfect, and the cole slaw is fresh and delicious!A must try place!"
"In town from Seattle visiting family. Heard about this place online. The wife and I made this our must try spot before we left town. Decided to do a carryout since I heard about the lines and with nine of us didn't want to have kids wait long. I called in a pretty large order covering the entire menu, St. Louis ribs, brisket, pork, slaw, corn bread, peach cobbler and the bread pudding! The gal told me the wait was about 35min which was great for lunch. I arrived and my order was professionally packed up in a box ready to go with no wait! As far as the food goes, AWESOME! Meat had great smoke flavor, ribs had good bark on it, didn't even need sauce. Slaw was freshly made and and not running the mill. Cornbread and Mac and cheese were a hit and to top it off the Peach Cobbler and (my fav) Bread Pudding were outstanding! Got my in laws hooked now and our new go to spot when in town. My only suggestion is to offer more BBQ sauces."
"I guess it's pretty good BBQ.  Considering I'm not a huge fan of BBQ to begin with,  that's a good review.  It's always packed, so that should say something and my family seemed to enjoy it. I would have given it 4 starts but,  It's a bit small, the layout has you in pretty close to your neighbor actually.  Other than that, if you like BBQ, it's worth a try."
"I don't get the hype behind this place. I ordered a sliced brisket and pulled pork platter with a ""taste"" of st louis style ribs with mac and cheese and peach cobbler. I NEVER add salt to my food and apparently this place doesn't either! Seems they used all of it up salting the sidewalk during the winter. The texture of all the meats were a little off, it wasn't quite tender nor could it be deemed chewy. Sampled my friends' texas sausage and fries. The sausage was lacking in the flavor and salt department but the fries tasted like In N Out fries. The service was great with no wait on at 9 pm on a Friday night. Would not return."
"Great brisket yummy mac and cheese, Ribs finger lickin good. Service is fast.Seating is not my favorite but the food makes up for it."
"This is my favorite BBQ place in the city and it pains me to give this rating.  Love the food, but I just found out they use High Fructose Corn Syrup in their sauce.  They just became a BYOSauce place for me.  Disappointing."
"I have dined at Smoque BBQ on a couple of occasions.  The beef brisket is amazing.  Perhaps as delicious as some of my favorite Missouri BBQ restaurants.  The St. Louis ribs are prepared to perfection.  Each bite is filled with tender and easy to pull pork from the bone.  The smokey flavor of the ribs makes the overall experience more satisfying.  My only hiccup is the BBQ sauce.  The sauce is mediocre at best.  The sauce does not seem to enhance the outstanding flavor of the ribs.  I ate most of my ribs without the sauce for that reason.  I would recommend for the owners to sample the BBQ sauces featured at some of the better rib joints in the country and add those sauces to their restaurant.  Also, once the sauce is improved, have bottles of the sauce on each table.  Pouring bbq sauce on brisket or ribs from a small plastic cup takes away from the overall BBQ experience."
"I've been a fan of Smoque for years.  Their food is consistently wonderful, the people are nice, the restaurant is well kept (especially for a BBQ place).  They still have some of the best brisket in the area, but don't let that deter you from the pulled pork (or the ribs for that matter, but I feel the other two are better).  The sides are all fabulous, especial their mac and cheese and their baked beans.Unfortunately, Smoque just doesn't travel well.  I've picked up lunch for my folks (who only live about 40 minutes away), yet it's never tasted as good as it does at the restaurant.  Don't get me wrong: the food is still good, but just not as good as it is at the restaurant.  Go figure.FYI: there can occasionally be a line, but the Smoque staff handles this very effectively.  If you love barbeque, you've got to go to Smoque."
I've been coming here for a year now and tried everything I could off the menu and I've come to the conclusion that the best thing on the menu is their smoked chicken. Get the chicken. I repeat GET THE CHICKEN. I've been to a lot of barbecue spots and nobody does smoked chicken like Smoque. Nobody.
"We've never had to wait for a table, and my boyfriend basically lives to eat here whenever possible. It honestly took a little while to grow on me. The brisket and pulled pork are quite good, but they just offer the one signature sauce. I continue to be unimpressed by their sides - tiny little cups for a little too much money, the mac and cheese especially just isn't anything special. That said, it's a good place to grab a bite, you'll always get a table, and odds are any bbq fanatics you bring will like it."
"Off the chart good.  My son had 1/2 rack baby back platter and I had the RIb Combo platter which  is1/2 baby back, 1/2 St. Louis.   We ended up spllitting the St. Louis which was a perfect amount of food for lunch.  Sides were cole slaw, beans and fries.  The meat was incredible, juicy and just slid off the bone.  So good. Would recommend getting there by 11:30 am for lunch to beat the lines."
"Went in with 2 friends to try out this highly talked about BBQ joint. The Wait: Since it was 0 degrees outside on a Friday, the line was not too bad. By time we got in line to sitting on our table with the food was about 20 minutes or so. Not bad. Plus, we were preoccupied by having some beer while in line.Speaking of which, BYOB. BBQ Food, Chopped Brisket: They ran out of sliced brisket, so I ordered the Chopped Brisket meal and it came with 2 sides + coleslaw. A mound of Chopped brisket placed on my tray looked like a challenge to eat and I barely finished it. The charred flavors was just the right touch and the sauce in the meat was just enough. They do provide extra sauce and if you want, you can order 'extra char'Side # 1: Mac and cheese was baked with breadcrumb on top. Very delicious. A little small for the portion I thought, but it's probably a good thing since I had so much food anyways. Sleeper side pick #2 : Peach Cobbler. I waited until I was finished with everything and man, this was the highlight. The crust was the best part. Crispy exterior with soft exterior. Coleslaw: I grew up seeing my parents eat KFC coleslaw and having tried it once, completely turned me off from it. Smoque BBQ's coleslaw was surprisingly good. I ended up combining it with the brisket and the contrasting flavors blended well. Apparently this is how they do it in the South? Maybe I'm wrong, but it was delicious.Baby Back Ribs: My friends and I split a half slab and it was delicious as well. At some point the brisket and the ribs tasted the same. Not sure if they use the same rub, but it seemed like it. Overall, a must-go. Tough to get there though because of the location, but they do provide parking in the back. Make sure you read the parking signs!"
Amazing BBQ that falls off the bone. Be prepared to get messy. :)
"I LOVE this place! Yum I am rating food here and I happen to love good BBQ! This place has awesome baked mac and cheese, delish peach cobbler and different yet tasty coke slaw. The ribs are my daughters fav and reg (not baked) mac and cheese for my young boys are always on the list. Hubby likes the pulled pork and sausage. My weakness is the chopped brisket! Wish we lived closer. Actually, maybe not. I'd probably be 20 lbs heavier! lol Even got my brother and his GF enjoying it! She lives close."
"I would recommend Smoque over the following BBQ places I have tried in the city of Chicago: Lilly Q, Fat Willy's, Twin Anchors, Smoke Daddy.I would then list out the remaining locations in the following order:  Twin Anchors, Fat Willy's, Lilly Q, and I cannot recommend Smoke Daddy as I was unimpressed.Brisket was solid, pulled pork good, did not try the ribs however.I was also under impressed with Lilly Q.  Very nice restaurant, excellent cocktails, but overall not so impressive. BBQ is difficult as I think my own ribs hold their own against most places.  BBQ down in Memphis or over in Kansas and down in Texas is way better than anything I have had in Chicago.Brisket in Texas is the bestRibs in Kansas is the bestPulled port in Memphis is the best"
"Love the smokey beans and ends of the brisket, which the ""chopped"" brisket yumminess of which Texas BBQ brings to good 'ol Chicago. The beans have chunky smoked sausage Nugs of heaven. Smoque competes with best of 'em. Been here a dozen times and always top notch."
"This is by FAR my favorite BBQ place in Chicago.  There's something great about the non-pretentious atmosphere coupled with the communal seating.  Although some places (like Chicago q & County BBQ) have a more intimate vibe that might be better for special occasions, if you're just worried about the food, then Smoque is your best bet.Go early and go hungry!  You can't go wrong regardless of what you order!"
"I went to Smoque BBQ for the first time with a friend. We used to go to school together at the middle school nearby that was under a different name back in the days. I tried the half rack of ribs, with the peach cobbler, fries and coleslaw. The food was delicious and it is in a convenient spot. Parking is a little bit of an issue close by but we knew where to park and we made the walk over. I would definitely come back for some finger licking good ribs."
"Having gone to Kansas City last fall, I was fortunate to have a taste of what this country has to offer in terms of BBQ. Though this doesn't even come close to the tastes of that city, I'm glad I visited Smoque as it's been on the list for some time.The good - the mac and cheese.  I'm the pickiest person when it comes to mac and cheese to the point that I don't care for the way most restaurants make this childhood staple. Smoque's version ironically did me just right. The cole slaw was also nicely flavored and cut through the fattiness on the rest of my plate. The fries were a favorite of mine.  Thicker fries go well with BBQ and I was happy with what I received. On a side note... Smoque gets points for presentation as well if you are into taking pictures of your food. But I did like the music and the overall sloppiness left on my hands and face which makes me feel like I just had BBQ.The bad - the brisket. It was cooked too long or too high resulting in a brisket that practically fell apart like a pot roast. I was hoping for a little more texture.  Also, the crust on the brisket slid right off which was due to the fat underneath. A bit weird for me.  I didn't care for the sauce much either. There was a flavor in the sauce that made me pass on the extra provided.  The ribs were also very tough. You can't really separate them easily and biting in doesn't really work that way it should.Were this place in KC it may be out of business. Here in Chicago there are lines out the door. But that's expected in a city known for hot dogs, beef, steak and pizza. With mixed feelings, I'll hold in those BBQ cravings until I have the opportunity to once again head down South."
Very solid BBQ for Chicago. Was super crowded when we arrived but the link moved a lot quicker than I was expecting and we were seated and eating in no time. The pulled pork and brisket were both amazing.
"We went out for a late lunch last Saturday and decided upon Smoque after seeing review in the Tribune.  For a late lunch on Saturday the place was still doing a brisk business.  After a 15 minute wait in line to place our order there was another 10 minutes to seating.  Seating is communal.  Ambiance is good.  I had the Brisket platter and my wife had the Pulled pork sandwich.  The beans were good.  The Brisket was the star of the show, dead on with a tasty backend bark but tender moist interior.  I liked the Memphis bbq sauce.  Coleslaw was good as well.  Mac and Cheese was only fair in my opinion.I snuck a bite of pulled pork which was very good as well."
"This place reminds me of Phil's BBQ in San Diego.  You order your food first and then sit down.  The people here are really friendly.  Once you walk in they greet you and find you a seat once you order.  That's great!  The food here is pretty delicious.  I really enjoyed the BBQ beans.  It has a delicious smoky flavor.  YUMMO!  The Baby Back Ribs were also scrumptious.  If you like a meatier cut, get the St. Louis.  The Brisket was just okay.  To me, it looked more appetizing that how it tasted.  The BBQ sauce had too much of a vinegar flavor for my taste.  Overall, delicious, I would come here for some good O' BBQ!  I am eyeing the chicken next."
"This place is very solid BBQ.  I conversed with one of the owners as a consequence of coming in here with my uncle (one of those guys who knows everybody) and he was a nice guy as well, so there's extra points.  There's a nice variety of BBQ items and everything I've had is good.My only complaint, which will probably draw me stares of intense hatred in BBQ circles, is that there aren't really any vegetables options for sides.  I feel guilty if my meal doesn't contain something green, so I shy away from coming here as much as I otherwise would.  Hook me up with some green beans or asparagus and I'm all over it!"
"Best barbecue north of Tennessee. This place serves up some quality bbq for a decent price. The side portions are pretty weak for a true southern eater, and I'm waiting for the day they add potato salad to their menu. However, this place takes the (peach) cake for the best barbecue in Chicago."
"Chicken - just smoke no seasoning ... a little dry.Sausage (labeled ""Texas Sausage"") comparable to Elgin, Tx, sausage 20 years ago ... black pepper ... a little dry.Brisket - good smoke but thin, damp crust. Lean, but not dry. Good flavor.Pulled pork - excellent, good flavor and great bark."
"Still the best BBQ in Chicago, I've had. Everything on the menu is great. You should get friends to put a blindfold on you and spin your around like you're playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey. Point to something and it will be the best meal you've had all week. I could go in detail, but BBQ makes me tired and nappy."
"I like to consider myself as a BBQ snob being I'm from Missouri which is very near to some of the best BBQ. I always judge places based on their brisket bc you either do it well and it's not worth eating...... Well let me tell you the brisket was not a disappointment.... I loved every bit of it from the burnt ends to the perfectly smoked taste. The cornbread was pretty decent but the coleslaw was not, in my opinion good at all. If you're going through Chicago and want BBQ go here!!"
"The bbq meat is good, sides not so much."
"OMG this place is delicious! I love the atmosphere, the waiters are attentive and the food is off the charts! My fav is their baked macaroni!"
"Wish this was a full service restaurant cuz there will be a wait. Smoque has amazing brisket, pretty good ribs but they were out of pulled pork which is probably an indication of it being awesome as well. Definitely stop by to get your fix on bbq."
"Super tender meat and you can taste the smokiness. Ordered chopped brisket platter with cole slaw, corn bread, and BBQ beans (I am now a fan of beans). The house salad was really refreshing as well. My brother ordered the meat by the pound sliced brisket with the jalapeno sausage link. The meat is filling, so I shared with my family.The wait for the food was not long and I like the general mood of the place."
Amazing.
"Was here last week with the family. It was probably my 50th time there. BEST BBQ IN CHICAGO. Everything there is good but I'm hooked on the ribs (Baby back or St. Louis style, does not matter). It's not a fancy dining establishment if you choose to eat there but that's not why we go. My favorite sides are the Mac and Cheese and glazed apples. I highly recommend this place!"
"I'm writing this review some time after our visit but what I can recall is that this place was just mediocre for a rib/meat joint. Excited to try after seeing on Food Network, we waited for a special occasion. We ordered a half chicken, sliced brisket and St. Louis ribs --hoping to have a taste of the big ticket items.  Meat - skin on chicken was in edible and meat was ordinary. Not a fan. Ribs were chewy and tough, seriously, they were hard to eat. Best part was the brisket.  Melt-in-your mouth delish!Now in to the sides. Corn bread was ordinary. Slaw was fresh and crisp, OKAY. Mac-n-Cheese HEAVEN but only a micro portion that was consumed in two bites. For the $2+ I was disappointed. Summary - overpriced for ordinary food. We have heard of the lines but this day time during the week was empty. Actually had a lot of staff standing around looking lethargic."
"My husband first saw this restaurant on Diners, Drive Inns and Dives and had to check it out. He is a huge fan of BBQ. We ordered the St. Louis, the slaw, cornbread, beans and peach cobbler. The ribs were delicious. A dry rub and the meat is so tender. The sauce was on the side and was also delicious. The slaw was vinegar based, I was a huge fan of it. Beans were amazing and had bits of brisket in them. Cobbler and corn bread tasted very fresh."
"There's not much more that can be said about this place that the last 1400+ people haven't already probably covered.  I had been here for the first time maybe about a year ago, but wasn't really blown away by the food.  I came back recently with a group of 7 and this time I got to try more of the different offerings and it was much better than I remembered.I got a 1/2 & 1/2 platter (it's not on the menu) that consists of your choice of 2 meats (Pulled Pork, Brisket, or Texas Sausage), 2 sides, and the cole slaw.  I thought it was a great deal since the portions were not that much smaller than the full order.  I ordered the pulled pork & brisket which were both perfectly cooked and not dry at all.   The cole slaw is really light, it's not the stuff that's drenched in mayo, and goes really well with the BBQ.  The brisket chili & mac & cheese were also good.  The chili was a little lacking in the actual brisket but the flavor was there!I have to dedicate a paragraph to the incredible service here.  You usually don't think about service too much from a place that doesn't have waiters but the guys & gals who work here are awesome.  They're quick to answer any questions you have and super friendly.  I was here on a packed Friday night with a group of 7, and usually at a place like this I'd expect to be separated with that many people, but thankfully they've devised a great system where there's someone to take down the number of people in your party and let you know where to sit once a table is ready.  The service even extended after I left the restaurant!  We were outside and one of the staff who was taking out the garbage helped out with a question he overheard us talking about, even going so far as to go in and ask one of the owners.Overall great food & great service, definitely looking forward to coming back again!"
I was excited to try this place because of all the good reviews. I had the sliced brisket platter with beans and Mac and cheese. The briskets just melted in your mouth. The beans were also very good. The Mac and Cheese was out of this world amazing. I did not really enjoy the BBQ sauce. I've had better.  But man if you go to this place make sure you get the Mac and cheese. It's a must!
"Best barbecue, not only in Chicago but compared to everything we had on our trip to Memphis and Nashville.  Literally, my boyfriend and I went to Tennessee for a week, then visited Smoque after we came back and he was like ""This is the best.""  Really puts the south to shame.  I remember not only was the food delicious, but that the staff was kind and friendly.  I can't remember what happened - I think because we came right when they opened they didn't have one of their side dishes ready yet, so they gave us a different side for free and then made sure to bring out some of what we wanted once it was ready.  Great customer service!It's now on his list of ""go to"" places every time he comes to visit.  I wish I could remember what exactly we had but alas, we visited in January!  But I remember distinctly that we felt it was the best we'd ever had.  Sorry, Memphis."
I had their pulled pork which was good but nothing that really made me think I should order it again. If I had it to do over again I would have went for the ribs or brisket. Which more people were eating.  I went during the lunch hour and had to get it to go and tear it down in my car.  I would stop back again if I was in the neighborhood.
"Love Love Love this place!  I went back several times, and haven't been disappointed.  I do wish they served beer, but I have only been at lunch anyhow.  Maybe they let you BYOB?  Shortly after I went there for lunch, I saw the restaurant featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives!  That was super exciting to see!!Thanks for great BBQm Smoque.....Now grab a location in the 'burbs! ;-)"
I ordered food for 8 people and it was ready when we went to pick it up. The food was exceptional! All of the meat was tender and juice and the sauces were on point. Service was great and they even helped us to our car!
"Believe the hype..this place rocks. Not a big fan of cornbread but it was decent, edible. The mac & cheese was amazing, Bbq chicken, beef brisket and coleslaw...were absolutely DE-lish. Byob..huge plus. I'd definitely go back to this BBQ joint."
"I first tried the brisket here, but wasn't incredibly impressed.  However, I have since had the pulled pork, beans, and fries and ALL were AMAZING!  Good feel, good food, and BYOB."
"We where in town for the 4th of July weekend, and a good friend recommend we try this place. There where four of us and everybody ordered something different. The only things we didn't try were the chicken and the brisket chili. Sliced Brisket - 5 Stars, great flavor, moist, good bark.Pulled Pork - 4 Stars, would have been 5 but the sauce knocked it down one. Spare Ribs - 3 Stars, a little bland, a little soft. Fall off the bone is good, but     it's nice to have some texture. The sauce didn't help much.Texas Sausage - 4 Stars, good flavor, not over cooked, we'll worth the adder on a plate. Beans - 4 Stars, good taste not mushy. The meat scraps are a great addition.Mac & Cheese - 3 Stars, the crispy top was great but the cheese had separated, not the creamy texture I expected. Fries - 4 Stars, French cut and good, just needed a little more salt. Corn Bread - 2 Stars, nothing special. Cole Slaw - 3 Stars, vinegar based and good compliment to a heavy meal. Peach Cobbler - 5 Stars, one of the best I have ever had. Good texture and firmness on the peaches. The topping was just right, not overly sweet. Bread Pudding - 5 Stars, thick and rich, not overly done. The only issue was I should have eaten it in the beginning of the meal. It has cooled down by the time we dug in. Service - 5 Stars, great people, friendly and willing to help. Glad we went and will definitely return the next time we are in town."
"My favorite place for american BBQ in the city of Chicago. Avoid the lines by phoning in your order for pick up and get in, get out and enjoy much quicker! I've never had a bad meal here, and that's a rare thing to say about a restaurant anywhere!"
"This place was on my list for a long time, after reading about it many times I had to make the trek here. Of course I also had to order the Brisket since that's what they are known for. The ordering process was streamlined, wait in line, order, be seated, food comes, and that works nicely considering the volume this place does.Service was good and attentive.Brisket was not that great, it was okay and the portions were decent (not typical BBQ huge, but not small). They seem to do this differently than applying straight smoke, it's a bit too broken down and might I say not red/smokey enough versus some of the best brisket I've had.Sides:  Mac and cheese - superb, love the little ramekins they serve it in.  Chilli - Not very good, extremely watery and not meaty enough at allOverall, this is a good spot, but I expected so much more."
"Yet another place that has so many opinions, it surely doesn't need mine. But, here it is anyway:This shizz is delicious.Go at a random time. Fin."
"It's probably the best BBQ in Chicago.But it's well behind anything I've had in Texas and well behind Black Dog in Urbana (right by U of I).Is that fair to compare it to BBQ places so far away? I don't know, don't care.The food's fantastic, really is.The brisket and pulled pork are both cooked very well and the barbecue sauces have great flavor. The brisket has a great smokey flavor which is not overwhelming either. I haven't had the ribs but from friends who have, they say they're very good and the meat comes off the bone well.The pit beans are great while the mac and cheese is average. The cornbread is poor, almost like it came from some pathetic boxed mix. The peach cobbler is the best dessert option as well and it really is superb. Definitely save room for dessert.It's the best BBQ option in Chicago, but there's much much better BBQ down south."
"INCREDIBLE, AMAZING, FANTASTIC BBQ...in Chicago!?!  Listen, Chicago loves it's food and love's it meaty, hearty, and delicious!  This place is the brain child of a Texas transplant, and this is far and away, hands down, no questions asked the best BBQ in a ""non-traditional"" BBQ place I have ever been!  Top 5 BBQ of my life!  The meat is outstanding! The sauce is incredible! The sides are out of this world!  Do not let the line discourage you.  A line means something great is worth the wait!"
"Came here based on the Yelp reviews and I must say, the food did not disappoint! I ordered the Sliced Brisket platter with mac & cheese and baked beans. The mac and cheese was good, the baked beans were great, but the brisket was amazing! It was tender and cooked to perfection. Probably some of the best brisket I've ever had (and this is coming from a girl from Alabama). I will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago."
I did the 1/2 and 1/2 at my nephew's suggestion and it was delicious.  I had the mac and cheese and corn bread which were also good.  Could of used more of the mac and cheese.  Food came up quickly.  I will go back soon and often.
"No fancy white table cloth, no over head waitstaff.  Just probably the best BBQ in Chicago.  I would match up this against the so called championship ribs of Q any day.  As far as Fat Willies, the quality of Smoque leaves them in the dust also.It takes you back to what a BBQ shack should be.... Its all about the meat.  And they also have incredible fresh cut fries....."
"There's no sense in writing a lengthy review, reiterating what the rest of the nearly 2,000 reviewers have already said. So, let's just get to the point...Smoque is the 'ish when it comes to BBQ. Here's the Cliffs Notes: 1. Be prepared to wait. No joke. At 3:30 in the afternoon there was a line out the door.2. Best meat: Brisket. Tender, juicy, smoky...3. Pass on the mac, it was just okay. However, order two sides of the sweet and crunchy peach cobbler. 4. Order a ""taste"" of meat with your dish. For a few bucks you get a hefty portion of meat to try in addition to your meal. 5. As it refers to the above statement, BBQ reheats well. Welcome the leftovers! 6. Make you order a side of BBQ beans. You won't be disappointed.7. It's BYOB.I detest the word ""amazeballs"". But when it comes to describing Smoque, no other word pops into my head, which in my opinion, fully justifies its use. Phenomenal. Fantastic. Delicious. Amazeballs. However you want to describe it, I can't wait to go back and get my Smoque on."
"So I went here with a bunch of friends, thinking that this would be some amazing bbq after all of the hype on Yelp. Was thinking that the bbq would be comparable to the mouth-savoring juicy brisket that just melted in your mouth with its tangy sauce. But sadly, it was just, okay. It was nice. No doubt about that. It got the appropriate messiness that came with eating bbq, where your hands smelled of the smoky aroma a day after you ate it. And you got that feeling in your tummy of the mass amount of beef that you just threw into your belly to be slowly digested and rendered into some scrumptious fat by the amazing body that you have. Yet, the fries in all honestly were the highlight. The fries were a cross between in-n-out and Five Guys fries. They had that fresh crispiness of an in-n-out fry but a little larger towards the steak fry persona. Texas links were good, but not memorable. I just remember them being alright.And FYI, the wait in the line is pretty sporadic. You go into line to order your food; then pick it up when they call your number like a good o'le bbq joint. When I got there, I was at the tail of the line that went straight to the door. But once I got my food, I sadly watched the line dwindle to 3-4 people to reach the all holy cashier.So would I recommend this place? I would for a try. Does it live up to its hype? Sadly, I think that this is another one of those places that was over-hyped."
I drive from Wisconsin and pick up my Mom (who is either in a wheelchair or using a walker depending on how she's feeling) and we drive to Chicago just to eat at Smoque BBQ. The food is absolutely worth the trip. We have never been disappointed and we've been there at least 5 or 6 times. The chopped brisket sandwich with mac n cheese is fantastic. Very tender meat with the sauce on the side so you control the BBQ level. Note-- We finally realized that we can call when we are on our way and place the order for our food so that our order is ready when we arrive. This saves time so we don't have to wait in line for our food. Marvelous!!!
"Sooooo good! BYOB and DELICIOUS. I've seen lines out the door and down the sidewalk, but I have never personally had to wait too long. Very simple menu, very tasty BBQ. I've had the sliced brisket sandwich which is my favorite, the pulled pork, the chopped brisket, and the Mac n Cheese side. When you want hearty, stick-to-the-ribs ""Boy Food"" I like to call it- this is probably my first recommendation for a pig-out session. The portions are not over-sized but I always have leftovers and it is GREAT leftover. Dare I say sometimes it almost tastes better leftover, its that good. Bring a couple of good IPA's and chow the f down."
"The place is packed! Very uncomfortable, just as bad as a school lunch room. you can't even get through all the people to get your drink. The food is ok. The guys that get you a table and clean the tables etc are very nice. Even though they r super busy and can barely move around in there they still try to go above and beyond for you. They'll go get you a to go box etc. So other than the staff the place is not that great. I wouldn't go back."
"the BEST BBQ, love the brisket, chicken and pulled pork, yummythis place ALWAYS has a line to get in, and a long line.  then once in  you order, they call your number someone helps you find a seat in the cafeteria type seating and eat and people watch.  this is the best place to get an awesome meal and people watch as it is packed.  best to experience eating in, and then once you know the routine and want it, call in your order and have it as a pick-up, don't be fooled though even the pick up times can be a bit lengthy, all worth iti hope they never change, would not be the same."
"I have been to Rudy's BBQ in Texas multiple times (the gold standard against which to judge all other BBQ) and I have to say that Smoque has nailed it!  But before we get to the awesome food, here were a few notable things - 1) on a weeknight, we walked into a packed restaurant with reasonable wait, to both get a table and our food (~10-15 min).   2) AWESOME SMELLS coming at you from every direction, torturing my starving boyfriend.  3) it's BYOB - don't forget.  4) Their awareness of TX BBQ and Rudy's in general is apparent by the fact that they actually get their sausage from Rudy's - a good sign for things to come!Now, anyone will tell you that I am very picky when it comes to brisket.  I grew up in TX and while I have had some amazing BBQ pulled pork in the midwest and northeast, I haven't found many places whose BBQ brisket provides the same lean, smoky, tender meat-eating experience.  Smoque does.  And also, there was the tasty BBQ sauce, HUGE portions (mac & cheese, peach cobbler, vinegar cole slaw) all shared between two people and it was more than enough, we were stuffed.   Now, I haven't yet tried the more ""hot and trendy"" joints (BellyQ, Bub City) in Chicago to compare, but can say with all honesty, that Smoque is the real deal."
"Smoque is pretty awesome. The Brisket is always amazing. Wish they had delivery, but then again...walking over to smoque and back is good exercise. Which you'll need, considering the decadent pork you will be consuming."
Yes I have been to Smoque BBQ. The wait in line is worth it! The food is fabulous. I love their baby back ribs BBQ sauce was so good I bought a bottle home. I also like their peach cobbler side and the owner is a cool friendly guy.
St.Louis & baby back ribs were great. Pulled pork also had great flavor. B back soon!
"This is my favorite BBQ place . Ive never traveled south to BBQ states. This place is amazing. There will be a line out the door in the summer all the way down the sidewalk. I enjoy the baby back ribs. I enjoy the spare ribs. I love ribs, and these are awesome. The sauce is not my favorite but it is very good. I prefer very sweet BBQ on spicy seasoned meat. The brisket is to die for. The briskett melts in your mouth. I have never tasted flavor like that in briskett from anywhere everrr. It is so tender and never dry. I want it and need it like every week. Too bad I dont live in Chicago. Please do yourself a favor and try SMOQUE"
WOW I just found out about yelp and I must say that I have lots to  say....This place is as real as it gets... Try the brisket sandwich melts in your mouth!! ps go on a week day
"Great little location, kind of hidden from the main streets.  Great food and good for social individuals. Reminded me of school cafeteria, large table and a lot of people enjoying themselves. Kind of nostalgic.  Food was some of the best bbq I have had in the city. Worth the travel to go to and worth getting a group of friends together to experience a good meal."
"While it's not the best BBQ I've ever had, it's the best BBQ I've had in Chicago. This place embarrasses Urban BBQ, which all suburbanites rave about: they don't know BBQ. Smoque, which not only has the nicest staff you've ever meet, has REAL BBQ. The brisket is nice and fatty, carries a thick, black crust, and has a red smoke ring. The dry rub ribs are a unique addition to the Chicago food scene, as people here probably don't even know you can order in such a way. I also love that you can order brisket ""chopped"" or sliced (for people who enjoy spice, get the candied jalapeños). My only real complaint is that they don't serve burnt ends, which would be off the hook slow cooked here in their sauce. If you think you've had great BBQ in Chicago, you haven't. Smoque is it. Get extra to go, because you don't wanna wait in line again..."
Everything is delicious there. The beef brisket and the baked beans are the best I have ever had in my life and I am picky about my BBQ.
"Parking around here is pretty hard to find, and you might end up waiting a bit to be able to sit down, but the food makes it all worth it. My personal favorites are the baby back ribs, mac and cheese, and peach cobbler, but honestly everything they serve here is delicious. If you're not into sitting and eating somewhere crowded and noisy, they also do carry-out. Also, if you're not a fan of cole slaw but want to order a combo that comes with cole slaw as  side, you can substitute cornbread instead."
"I've been hooked on Smoque ever since I tried it for the first time a few years back. When asked what my favorite type of food is, it's always been barbeque and Smoque definitely makes some of the best bbq I've had. Frankly, this Smoque is probably my favorite joint to eat at. Period. Their chopped brisket is my go-to order and it should really be renamed to burnt ends because the two are basically synonymous here at Smoque, due to how fantastically  fatty and flavorblasted their brisket is (in a good way of course). Big fan of their ribs too. St. Louis style all the way. The side of mac n cheese is just as to-die-for as their meats. It is so fantastically cheesy and rich and flavorful. I so love the portion size of all of their sides - the container holds such the perfect amount given how rich and flavorful each side item is.Now the peach cobbler is just SILLY - I told myself that I was only going to ""try it"", you know just one bite!......well folks, I basically inhaled the cobbler - it was gone so quickly. So I'm hooked on that too...This place is always jam-packed and the lines can get pretty long, but it goes quickly and is beyond worth it to wait. Plus, if you're dining in, the staff helps you out in making sure you have a table come time for you to sit down and eat, so that's a nice feature of this place. Basically, I have nothing bad to say about Smoque - I just love this place."
"I'm a vegetarian and yes I went anyway.  So this review is for the mac n' cheese and chocolate chip cookies.  So if there are any vegetarians wondering if it's worth the trip just for that, my vote is yes.  The portion is just enough.  It's cheezy, gooey and the crackling of the topping is addictive!  I also had the cornbread.  Meh.  I work about 3 minutes from here so if I'm ever in need of just a side to complete the lunch I brought to work, I'll definitely make the trip again!  Oh and the chocolate chip cookies were pretty delish too!"
"I'm not a BBQ fan but this was crazy good. I had the brisket which was cooked so perfect that it barely took a fork to cut it. The slaw with it had GREAT flavor (homemade), I had the BBQ beans which were a bit smokey but had killer taste and the fries which were really good. My boyfriend had the pulled pork (I liked it a lot also) and we tried the sausage (I probably wouldn't get that again). We got there maybe 5pm and they were getting busy. I would either phone your order in or come a bit early unless you want to wait awhile. He was correct...this place is awesome...I'll be back!"
"Great food.  Ribs have a great flavor.  My favorite is the St Louis Spare ribs, coke slaw and fries.  Small and cozy and a little loud the way a down home place should be."
"Really enjoyed our dinner tonight. Brisket and chicken platters with brisket chili, cornbread, mac&cheese and coleslaw. The brisket was very tender and served with 2 sauces. We ordered one of each dessert: peach cobbler and bread pudding. Both were good but I preferred the bread pudding. BYOB- we brought beer and wine. The wait on a Sunday at 6:00 was not bad, about a half hour for a party of 5. Not a place for a leisurely dinner since the tables have to turn quickly."
"The sides are excellent, but the ribs are just ok. And everybody in my group said the same thing. I won't drive that far again for their food. I think my ribs are better."
"First things first.  Do not get discouraged by the line that stretches out the door.  They do a very good job of moving everyone along quickly.  That said though, the seating in the restaurant is difficult to come by, so I would recommend ordering take-out if possible.  No wait, and the food is just as good!Over my visits, I have tried the brisket, ribs, hot link, and pulled pork.  For a place called ""Smoque"", I am kind of surprised at the lack of smoke flavor in the meats.  While very tender, I find the brisket to be lacking in that smoky flavor that I am used to getting.  Something tells me it is because they do not have enough time to dedicate to the smoking, while accommodating the thousands of people they get each day.  Same can be said for the pulled pork and hot link.  Where this place has truly disappointed me though, is in their ribs.  I have yet to have a batch that wasn't dried out and chewy.  The sauce they serve with the meals is very good, and if you remember, ask for the spicy version as well.  Very good in its own right.Staff is very friendly and the atmosphere, if you are eating in, is nice.  It will be loud, due to the number of people that are there at all times, but nothing that can't keep you from having a conversation with friends.  Bottom line, it is a good BBQ, but I have had better.  Much better in fact in the suburbs (Steamboat in Wheaton for anyone in that area).  If I was in the area and wanting BBQ though, I would not hesitate to get some Smoque.  I would just make sure I placed a to go order."
Great smoked meats. Excellent smoked chicken. Love the pulled pork. We eat here all the time. Thank you for doing such a great job
"I've eaten here a few times.I don't understand the big deal.It's literally A-OK. Nothing to write home about.  But, it's VERY consistent.That might go a long way with everyone."
"There is totally a reason that this place has almost 2,500 reviews and manages 4.5 stars!! I can't think of another restaurant I've *ever* seen on Yelp that has that many reviews at that high a star ranking. The food is incredible. Arguably the best BBQ in the city, rivaling true Southern barbecue. The only thing I'd warn about is the limited seating and the lines--this is a better place to get weekday meals and take them home. That said, they usually still manage to move the line along pretty quickly.Food so good! Go now!"
Whenever I get to come to Chicago I try to stop at this place! It's very very yummy. The bbq sauce is also amazing!
"This place is a goddamned treat.Everything is good, including the mac and cheese.Most times, people GUSH over mac and cheese at a restaurant, then I go and am like ""hey, thanks for putting bacon, basil, chicken, and scallions in my mac and cheese, can you please make this fucking mac and cheese  good and normal?""This is what goes on here with this M and C.It's never been disputed that the two things Jewish and black people have most in common is a love for brisket and basketball - so there's no shame in these recipes and foods being crafted by what I can only imagine are Hebrews."
"So delicious!  I have a good time here, service was wonderful.  I would recomend to anyone!"
"It's a heaven for meat lovers,it's pure protein in big quantity and amazing taste....the best there is rips in saint Louis style and beef brisket.  For newbies: U can get half rack of rips with a taste of beef brisket, 3 sides and drink for about 20 bucks....love it"
"Be prepared to stand in line and wait. Make friends with the folks in line. Because there's nothing stronger than the bond of delicious BBQ and we had a good time talking BBQ with other hungry folks in line with us.It's a tiny corner restaurant and seating is very close to each other too, so if you didn't make friends while you were standing in line, you'll get a chance to make friends with the folks seated next to you. Knocking elbows and knees can make you fast friends. Because this place is small, you're easily enveloped in the aroma that is BBQ'ed meat. My husband and I ordered the brisket platter and the 1/2 slab baby back platter and added a Texas sausage link. Coleslaw comes with each platter as well as 2 sides.  So we chose cornbread, baked beans, fries and mac/cheese. The meat was delicious. The brisket is heavily marbled so it's very moist. But our new friends next to us (remember what I said about making friends?) told us that you could order the brisked leaner if that's what you prefer. Great tip! The ribs seemed kind of small to me, but they were cooked really well. Tender meat, not fall off the bone, but giving to a little pull.  The sausage was delicious, nice bit of spice. All the meats had a great flavor on their own, but I really liked the BBQ sauce, peppery and tangy, I also loved dipping my fries in it. The sides, except for the crunchy fresh coleslaw, were disappointing. I didn't care for the beans (a little mushy) and the Mac N Cheese (overcooked). Friendly and helpful service. They run the dining area so well--finding a seat for everyone--so don't fret, even if a little one in your party needs a highchair. There's patio seating and It's BYOB too!"
The St. Louis ribs was so so good! Their house BBQ sauce both mild and spicy is incredibly unique and compliments the meat perfectly. Hands down the best BBQ I've ever had in Chicago.There was a line out the door into the vestibule but orders were turned up efficiently so the wait time was fine. They don't have very many seats but the staff there did an amazing job attending to customers and turning over tables instantly. Totally worth checking out! But double check your order as they did mess mine up.
"Love this place!  I had the sliced brisket platter. With beans and coleslaw.  First of all the brisket was so tender you can cut it in half with a plastic fork with ease.  The smoke flavor was on par with some of the best BBQ I've had.  The beans were good, nothing to rave about.   The coleslaw was excellent. It was so fresh and crisp.  Nothing like the soggy stuff that  most restaurants try to pass off.  The place itself is just a simple layout. You go there for the food and nothing else.  It's a little off the beaten path.  Parking sucks.  So you want to either take a cab or bike it."
"Mac n cheese is great. Meat is cooked really well, very tender, but the flavor wasn't impressive. Customer service is great. Fries are crunchy, decent taste. Corn  bread was a little stale, a little bland. If u like a more vinegar Bbq sauce vs sweet you'll like it here. Fair price for good quality of food. I would definitely recommend coming here to try."
5 stars on the food 5 stars for the BYOB option4 stars for the cafeteria like dining room
"Smoque is BBQ heaven. Got a platter with sliced brisket, chopped brisket, and pulled pork, with a side of mac & cheese and peach cobbler for dessert. Everything was delicious! I can't wait to come back. No complaints whatsoever."
"My wife took me for a birthday adventure. Got too long a wait to get in. Fairly uncomplicated menu. My wife isn't big on pork, so we ordered the 1/2 chicken with slaw and two sides: Mac and cheese and peach cobbler ( we were ecstatic about having dessert for a side!)  with a taste of the Texas sausage and 1/4 slab of the St. Louis Ribs. The sides: cole slaw was good. Not the creamy slaw I'm used to but very refreshing! The Mac and cheese was definitely legit! I would recommend trying as the cheddery goodness was undeniable. Peach cobbler was up there with some of the best I've had. The crispy sweet topping mixed with the tart peachy innards was delectable. The meat: the chicken was juicy and well seasoned with the rub. Not salty ( I would have liked a pinch more) . Ribs were cooked perfectly same rub as the chicken but that sausage.... That was worth the trip! In all, I enjoyed myself. Would def go back."
"We drive from West Michigan to get BBQ at Smoque. The brisket is the real star of the show, but don't miss the smoked peach cobbler (sounds weird, but the smokiness with the peaches is amazing!). The brisket is like slices of delicious beef butter. The sauces are home made and compliment perfectly. Ask for the candied jalapeños. Worth the 2 1/2 hour drive!"
"It was okay!  We were hoping to find our official ""amazing Chicago barbecue place"" and long story short, this isn't it."
"Wow what a meal! I usually don't like eating a lot of meat mostly because I've had experiences where the meat is really chewy. Despite my awful experiences, I decided to give this place a try. I got the sliced brisket sandwich which was fantastic so tender just melted in your mouth. The bun they used was simple not too dry or moist just perfect. The fries had a good crisp to it no oily or soggy fries! The BBQ beans were a good side to have. They have excellent customer service surprised to have two different ppl check up on us. They even suggested the spicy BBQ sauce and sweet jalapeños which they have generous samples of. After that amazing feast we had their peach cobbler pie which was an explosion of juicy flavor with a piece of granola crunch just perfect! Loved it! Great experience! I would suggest they improve their coleslaw and add mashed potatoes to their sides!"
"Loved the brisket and the pulled pork. Both were tender and juicy. The mac n chesse was good, the cole slaw was good, the baked beans were good. Portions were large. We had plenty of left overs. I still plan on returning to try the St Louis ribs. The place is pretty busy and the ordering process is weird. You have to order first and then wait to be seated. Kinda strange but overall, delicious."
"Our lunch was catered by Smoque yesterday. I wasn't terribly impressed, but the hype was high and it was catered with only a few options- I'm sure at the restaurant is better. The beef briscuit was good, I didn't get to try the pulled pork or the sausage- but they smelled great. The Mac and Cheese was baked cheesy goodness and incredible. I wanted to eat the whole tray. I think I need to try going in and getting something hot and fesh- but a decent spread for a catered office lunch."
"A Chicago Institution....It's all been written here. This is a place I simply just haven't reviewed in the almost 7 years I have been a part of Yelp now....sigh.It's amazing here, they take pride in EVERYTHING they do and they are nice about it too. Can beat it for Chicago BBQ!!!!!"
"I visited this establishment on a Saturday evening.  The line was out the door.  After an hour wait and hearing rave reviews from many people in line, I was disappointed from bite #1.  We ordered a full rack of Baby Back ribs, added on a side of chopped brisket. For sides - cole slaw, mac&cheese & corn bread.  We topped it off with Pecan bread pudding.  Plus, we got two drinks to wash everything down. It was A LOT of food for less than $40.  By the way, this place is BYOB.  Main meal: Baby Back ribs were flavorful and smoky BUT dry and a bit tough =/ They sold out of St. Louis ribs about 40 minutes into my long wait in line. Perhaps the higher fat content of the St. Louis ribs would be more tender and moist. Sad day for us.  Chopped brisket was the same - flavorful but dry.  Their BBQ sauces were also disappointing.  Sides: Cole slaw was perfect compliment for the heavy foods. Light vinegar, no mayo. It was very refreshing.  Corn bread was fluffy and had actual bits of corn =) My favorite item out of the whole meal was surprisingly their Mac&Cheese.  Very flavorful, perfectly cheesy and I loved the crumbly breadcrumbs baked on top.  Dessert: The bread pudding was yummy but cold by then.  We took it home and ate it the following day reheated.  Definitely, much much better.  Next time I would even add a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top (not available @ Smoque).One last note - ALL the food was served lukewarm which was a huge disappointment.  IF I was to visit again, here are the things I would do differently - Order St. Louis ribs, sliced brisket, & pulled pork.  I would also SKIP THE LINE. Call in a order before, pick it up, take it home, & heat it up before eating it."
"I've been going here for years, and every time I visit Chicago, I make a trip up to Smoque. The pulled pork sandwich has always been my go-to, but the sliced (fatty) brisket is phenomenal as well, as long as you request the Carolina sauce to cut some of the richness.As for sides, you gotta get the mac n cheese."
Amazing food. My 2 favorites are the macaroni and cheese and brisket. Mmmmm mm good!! The workers are always really nice there too :)
"Great service, great food, and reasonable prices. The mac and cheese were my favorite!"
"I have eaten here a few times and I get my yearnings for the place when it comes to their ribs, but I hate their lines and once I was there they actually ran out of all ribs which was bizarre so it doesn't get 5 stars for this reason. My favorite style of rib is the baby back and their sides are all good. You can't go wrong with any of them and they are freshly home made so this is a plus."
Best BBQ in Chicago! I love the sliced brisket and ribs! The BBQ sauce is amazing but the dry rub they use on the ribs really makes sauce unnecessary. I always get the mac & cheese and fries as my side - coleslaw comes with the platter options.
"( Licks BBQ off my fingers before I type) Can I say finger licking good?? Yes it is some amazing BBQ. I mean the meat is tender and not dry. The sauce is amazing! The sides the go with the BBQ are stars themselves. The Mac and cheese is soo yummy. And the sweet bread is so warm and fresh, taste great with butter to melt right on it."
it's good. it's not great. they try to do several styles of bbq. some work better than others (though probably that due to the fact that i prefer certain styles over others). you get you food quickly. you should at least try it for yourself. i found the parking to be a pain in the ass at times.
"Great sides, terrible everything else. No idea why this place gets a line except for hipsters trying too hard in the nw side. Also the set-up inside seems create to make a line so it looks like something is going on here. TONS OF BETTER PLACES FOR B B Q."
"Amazing BBQ. Even though I haven't been here for a few years, the BBQ was amazing. Great sides too like the Man N Cheese."
2nd best bbq i've had in chicago (behind real urban bbq).  the only reason i gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because the wait is terrible.  great food!  everything there is good!
"Inexpensive, great portions and BYOB!"
"I have traveled to many BBQ cities and I've had great BBQ but never in my own city. I mentioned this to my wife and she surprised me with a visit here.When we walked in we were greeted by Carlos aka Omar, who asked if it was our first time. I love it when a restaurant recognizes new customers and lends a helping hand. He was very helpful and recommended we try the beef brisket. He told us it was his favorite. I also thought his story about his nickname was cute. They call him Omar because there are too many other Carlos working there. It was funny how he delivered it.So of course we ordered pulled pork...sorry Carlos/Omar. We also got coleslaw, Mac and Cheese and peach cobbler. Carlos then came over and he offered us two more sauces to dip in. I really loved the spicy BBQ sauce. It was really yummy. He even hooked us up with sweet jalapeño peppers. They were so good...I started eating them with my pulled pork.The pulled pork was amazing. It was one of the best I've had in a long time. Carlos noticed we only got the pulled pork. I think he was sad we didn't take his advice. So he brought us over a sample of the beef brisket. Oh boy was it good. I am completely torn between two meats. I know next time I will get both.The Mac and cheese was so good. The small side left me wanting more. I love the little individual foil dishes. Every container had the perfect amount of bread crumbs toasted on top. The peach cobbler was also fantastic. The crust was one of the best ever. I only wish I had a scoop of vanilla ice cream to put on top. Maybe management will add this for a summer treat. The Cole slaw was also very fresh tasting. I loved that it was not drenched in mayo but seemed to be vinegar based.While we were eating my wife told me to look over my left shoulder. And there was guy hanging on the wall starring at me. Really? Why is he everywhere in Chicago? This is starting to get a little ridiculous. He should just move here and open a restaurant.As we were leaving at 11:50am, a huge line started to form. We had beaten the lunch crowd. I also got to see Carlos in action. He not only welcomes guests and cleans tables but he is the enforcer too. Some guy was trying to save a table even though his party was at the back of the line. He very diplomatically informed the guy that he had to get others seated who were in front. I love that!!! Good for you Smoque for defending the rights of the hungry people needing a spot to eat. You have got this down to a science.Some side notes...the neighbors do not like you and your cars. They have giant professional signs in the street informing you to not park in front of there houses. I found it kind of funny but understood. It only told me that the food was so good that people will risk there car for an amazing meal.I loved Smoque BBQ...it was one of the better BBQ's I've had. I can hardly wait to come back for some more of this fantastic food."
"The food at Smoque is just OK. The restaurant layout is kind of cramped, as a person waiting in line to place your order I felt as I if I was standing over the diners. As diner I felt like I was crammed with the other diners. The restaurant decor has the feel of a modern barbeque joint. The service is pretty simple, you place your order at the counter,  then wait for your order to be called, take your try and bring your food to your table. As for the food I had the beef brisket. The brisket was dry, I am not sure if it was dry because the cut of brisket did not have enough fat on it or because it was over cooked. We were there during a very busy dinner service so I don't think it had been sitting around all day. The barbeque sauce was tasty, the sides were typical barbeque restaurant sides, nothing to write home about. I would not make another trip to Smoque, the dry brisket is not worth the trip."
"I've been searching for good brisket since I moved back north... my search was officially ended when Smoque was catered in at work. This prompted several visits to their physical location to try out the different options, and I was happy each time. I've tried the chopped & sliced brisket, pulled pork and the texas sausage. The brisket melt-in-your-mouth moist, the pulled pork is juicy and the sausage was pretty flavorful (for the one bite that I manage to steal from the boyfriends plate.. oops). Highly recommend the mac'n'cheese, some of the best I've ever had (and even reheats well.. if you can mange to not eat your entire meal in one sitting). Also had the cornbread, brisket chili, baked beans.. all good.I will say the restaurant is pretty small, but tables turn over quickly and I've never been left standing when my food came up. There's also a small outdoor seating area, and it's really close to the Blue Line (I'd be in danger of being severely obese if I lived off of it).Overall: amazing food, reasonably price for what you get, recommend you slowly bribe your office to cater it in."
This place is great all the way around. I must admit that it looked like a cluster f**k when I walked in the door but after observing for a few moments I realized the staff had everything under control. So don't get intimidated by a large crowd you will get a seat by time your food is ready. Chopped brisket sandwich was perfect as well as the pulled pork sandwich.
"Amazing barbecue! Dry rub on all with a choice of delicious sauces to enhance the smoky almost carmelized flavor (instead of cover the lack of flavor that some BBQ places do). Catered for our wedding. Prompt delivery, excellent service before the event and upon delivery, everything was perfect according to our order, hot and delicious, and even delivered 45 minutes away for us. Thanks!"
"Bad news, Chicago.  They do not have the best rub, the best sauces, the best sides, or the best ambiance.I've been to the competition in the city and the suburbs, and the food I had at Smoque took longer, and was mediocre at best.  Don't get me wrong, it was good BBQ BECAUSE it is BBQ, but you probably want to look at my reviews to see where the better places are.  It was crowded, messy, and overall disappointing."
The St. Louis Ribs was super delicious and well worth it. Totally recommend it to anyone.
"When i tried their brisquet, i had an epiphany! Just amazing! We tried several items: st louis spare ribs, pulled pork, ans a few sides. The core dish however is the brisket...just order a pound of it....you will smoque it!"
"This is probably one of the best BBQ joints you will find in Chicago, they are located right at the highway I90/I94 exit of N Pulaski Rd. Based on my experience, this place is always packed and a long line of people waiting to order. However, the waiters here work pretty fast and efficiently that you would not have to worry about where to seat.Their chopped beef brisket is moist and tender, it is as if it's melting in your mouth, but make sure you eat it while it's still warm. Their Texas sausage got this smoked flavor to it that you know it's been cooked right.  As for the side, their fresh cut fries are pretty good, and I really like their peach cobbler, the crust and the peach just make a good combination. Overall, I always have a wonderful experience with this place. This is a must go-to place for any BBQ lovers.By the way, did I forget to mention this place is BYOB? so bring your favorite wine/beer and enjoy your gourmet food with delicious drink."
"The name of the establishment, says it all!! SMOQUE, that's all you smell.  Lol The food is delicious, we had the 1/2 chicken and fries.  It gets packed so be prepared to wait, but well worth it."
"Smoque is outstanding.  Just go now.  Our favorites are the chopped brisket sandwich, the ridiculously good, best we've ever had fries  AND mac and cheese, and my partner loves the ribs.  I even had a salad there a couple of times, and it was surprisingly fresh and fantastic (kind of unexpected for a ""meat"" place).  Nice outside seating now too, and BYOB.  Seriously great BBQ place.  Best in the city. Go."
"Love it. Pulled pork, brisket, corn bread, baked beans, even the slaw is ravenous. I have always ordered the food for take out, and I have never been disappointed. Prepare to wait if you go at noon so try to get their earlier if you plan to sit."
"This place was nothing short of amazing. Ribs, chicken and brisket perfectly smoked. Fries were fresh cut, corn bread amazing and mac and cheese to die for (add a little salt tho) I'll be back, definitely."
"FINALLY tried Smoque BBQ after wanting to for quite a while and it did NOT disappoint!Got in around 11:45am and was lucky enough to only have to wait in line for about 2 minutes.  The brother ordered the brisket and I ordered the brisket sandwich.  Love the fact that you're able to choose your own side, too!  The brisket itself is possibly the BEST brisket I've tried.  It's ridiculously tender and has a nice enough amount of fat to add amazing flavor.  The BBQ sauce itself is tangy with the perfect touch of sweetness.  The cole slaw is great--it's crunchy and is a nice break from the BBQ...and I don't even LIKE cole slaw!This just might be my new favorite BBQ place in the Chi-city.  Looking for a time to go back!"
"High-quality food at very reasonable prices. Sample as many sides as you can- the mac and cheese, baked beans, corn bread and peach cobbler were all worth trying. The ""small"" salad is pretty large. We went on a Saturday and arrived about 5:30. We stood in line for maybe 20 minutes and were seated immediately after that. The line only got worse after we arrives, so I suggest coming early if you're in a hurry.It's BYOB, which is a plus, but seats rotate pretty fast. Don't expect to linger."
"Great brisket , not too smoky ( which I don't care for), ribs (both kinds) very good( 4 stars).  When people don't give a place like Smoque 5 stars I wish they would tell me what place in Chicago gets 5 stars in THO.Negative (to me), cole slaw. Don't like it at all.Love Central BBQ in Memphis and Smoque (IMHO) is just as good.PS the two have very similar BBQ sauce."
"When it comes to sliced Brisket, Smoked Chicken, St. Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs and Pulled Pork, this is where you want to go get some.  The best way to experience this great taste sensation is to call ahead for takeout.  Seating is limited and too close, when you add patrons who are coming to pickup their takeout it gets even tighter.The food portions are just right and they have never failed to live up to expectation.  The baked beans go well with anything you order.  Try it once and you'll keep coming back for more, guaranteed!!"
"Excellent, food, service, portions"
"Stopped by on Saturday around 12:30, place was jam packed. The first thing you notice is the amazing smell of the restaurant. Considering how crowded it was, the service and ability to find a seat was amazing. The chef also was real nice and looked to be on top of everything. My buddy and I split two platters (pulled pork and chopped brisket). We then got four sides, which are included. We had baked beans, chili, fries and mac and cheese. My only complaint is that the mac and cheese is kind of small. But, it is beyond amazing. Literally the best bbq I have ever had. It is totally worth going to this place and I will be back again and again."
Love this place. Small hole in the wall bbq joint. They have a no fuss menu with every option tasting amazing! They have a good system down for the space they have. I will admit it is always packed and busy but it doesn't bother my husband and I.
"They have got it down.Their seating system is great.Even if it's busy, it seems like you get in and sit down fairly quick.The food is delicious, I loved the coleslaw and the beans.I've tried everything and it is all super tasty.But, the brisket is probably the best I have ever had.So there you have it.EAT HERE!!"
"This place is perfect... Long lines? Not a prob for Smoque! You get your food quick. The food is delicious! I always get the brisket, mac and cheese, corn bread, peach cobbler, fries, and bread pudding! Yes, I eat all of it... The slaw is to die for, along with everything else. This place is a must when visiting Chicago!"
"Pulled pork sandwiches can be found almost anywhere, but few restaurants make me remember the really good ones.  Smoque BBQ is one of the few BBQ places in the city that will have me coming back.Tender, juicy, and flavorful while surprisingly not overfilling typically from what you get with most PP sandwiches.  On its own its flavorful, but I do love BBQ sauces, and Smoque has their own brand that has flavor.  A great atmosphere, a great casual date night that's close by my house. Cant wait to go back!"
"This place was fantastic !  I had the pulled pork, sliced brisket, slaw, and chili.  The pork was tasty, but the brisket.... mmmmmm.  It was amazingly delicious.  I probably could have eaten a pound of it.   The slaw was great - nice and tangy.  And the chili was a big surprise, it looks like they may use yesterday's brisket meat for the chili.  It was some of the best chili I have ever had!Can not wait to go back!"
"I've been to Smoque 3 times.  Every time I have gone, thankfully lines are not too bad. I had the half ribs with French fries and mac and cheese and also the colesalaw. The mac and cheese is super yummy, and the coleslaw was actually pretty good.  Let me tell you I don't care for coleslaw anywhere but here its definitely yummy! I really like trying new places but my boyfriend is very reluctant to try new things(he's from Ecuador) so when I told him to come with me to eat ribs. Since I had already been there once, and he finally agreed I was super excited. He had the same thing I had the first time I went and oddly he said it was really good and now every time we go out to eat he actually says let's go eat smoque ribs!"
"Guess why there is always a line out the door here?  Because Smoque has the best BBQ in town. Who is better I ask, Who?"
REally Good Stuff!
"Best brisket I've ever had, great staff and a wonderful dining experience EVERY TIME."
Fantastic. Be prepared to wait an hour+ in line but then savor every bite because it's delicious. They just added bread pudding to their dessert list and it's simple but perfect.
"Incredible BBQ. Had the chopped brisket with slaw, fresh cut fries, n Mac n cheese.  Also had a half slab of ribs which I was not a fan of.  But EVERYTHING was excellent. The bbq sauce is addicting.  My cousin had the sliced brisket and I think I would of gotten that instead. But it was still awesome. Highly recommend this BBQ joint. Want to try the corn bread and chicken next time."
"Tasty food. Everytime I eat there, I am always full and very satisfied. Try their brisket and St. Louis ribs and peach cobbler. 2500+ 5 star reviews speak for this place."
"Their meat is amazing but their sides are only so-so. $25 for two people for lunch is a bit pricey for what we were given. Pulled pork sandwich was really good and I was impressed with their bread being able to handle the amount of meat and sauce they piled on. The brisket chili was not chili. 1 it had beans and 2 it was liquidy. So at best I would say it's a brisket soup. They did however pet me substitute the slaw for cornbread. So that was awesome. He got the chopped brisket sandwich. We both agreed the pulled pork was superior. That's not say it wasn't good, it's just the pulled pork was amazing. He got the slaw and fries. Slaw was, well slaw. Nothing to write home about, it just existed. The fries were way over-seasoned but seemed to be made on site so I'll forgive them their heavy hand. Overall, we'll probably be back because it's close, but only if we're craving good BBQ"
"It's been a long time since I'd wrote an reciew, but this just made it impossible not to write one. I found one of my new favorite place for bbq. I'd got the brisket and it's perfect. Soft and juicy and tender. Tasteful bbq sauce without overwhelming the meat. I don't like coleslaw but I like theirs. Everything is delicious. Price is reasonable and they have free street parking. Friendly service and definitely worth the 2,000+ reviews. Texas girl approved!"
"This place is fantastic.  The sides could be a tad bigger but the food is phenomenal and very reasonably priced considering some of the other BBQ houses I have been too in Texas and Kansas.  Great Food, Good people and well priced.  Can't say enough good stuff about everything they have here.  The brisket and the BBQ chicken is amazing.  Highly Recommend!"
I've eaten here twice and been extremely happy with both of my visits. Amazing BBQ and the sides are awesome as well... The Peach Cobbler is a must!
"We were starving as we head to over to Chicago from Hoffman Estates so we decided to yelp and stumbled upon this place.  We decided to grab some lunch here and wait out for traffic.  Great Find!!! We ordered Sliced Brisket and the full slab of ribs.  Luckily, they allow us to split the full slab for half and half; half slab of Baby Back Ribs and half slab of St. Louis style ribs.  Yummmm!!! The sliced brisket was very moist as well.  I love how they give you many choices of sauce and you get to mix and match with you meat.  The best condiment I found was actually the Candied Jalapeño. I cannot have enough of it.  So good!!!  I know you are probably drooling reading this part as I know I am just typing up this part of my review.  We chose baked beans and fries for the 2 sides.  Baked beans were okay, not bad but a little bit on a sweeter side.  The fries were delicious and the portion was quite generous.   Also, the workers are wonderful at this establishment.  They will helped us narrow down our choices as we would have ordered one of each from the entire menu. We're glad to have found this place."
"Really solid BBQ, I think similar to KC style, but I am not an expert. I like the casual atmosphere and the vibe. Could use a spicier BBQ sauce, but that's just me."
"Went here for a buddy's birthday after we found out Rockit was closed for renovations. As far as appearances go, it has the same feel all other ""legit"" BBQ places I have been. Transient seating, old school vinyl flooring, and that smell! The smoke you smell a block away. The smoke that smacks you in the face when you walk in the door. There is no doubt you are in a place that takes BBQ seriously. They don't really have a ""combo"" platter, but you can order your main meat meal and then add on ""tastes"" of the other meats available. I had ribs, brisket, and sausage. They were out of pork by the time we arrived.I am a fan and I will be back! For sure I need to try the pork!"
"There aren't a lot of BBQ places in the city, but this is one of the best.  It's nothing fancy but who needs fancy when they are eating BBQ!"
"The chopped brisket is delicious. ends burnt to perfection, while tender in the center. It is SO good, that it took me several visits before I would try any other menu items, but I can now say that everything is fantastic.  Natural cut fries served in a paper bag (huge portion) and a tangy vinegar based BBQ sauce that you'll want extra of to pour on everything.Tip- Closed Mondays, BYOB"
"Smoque is a little off the beaten path, but it's worth the trip. The food is excellent, and the place is a well-oiled machine. I rocked up at dinnertime on a Thursday, and the host told me all about the system. You have to order your food, and when you've finished ordering, he'll find you a table. We learned upon arrival that it's BYOB (poor research on our part), so we had to make a quick trip to 7-Eleven before we could order. No big deal. My husband ordered the Texas sausage platter with beans and macaroni and cheese, and I got the chicken platter with fries and cornbread. It was a LOT of food and was absolutely delicious. The barbecue sauce is absolutely delectable, the fries abundant and crispy, and the cornbread not too sweet and not too dry. PERFECT. My husband was very pleased with his meal but said that the beans were too sweet for his taste. The prices are right. I think we paid less than $30 for our food, which is all but unheard of in Chicago.There was no pressure to clear out after we were finished. We hung around for 20 minutes talking and letting the food settle. The wait staff were clearing tables constantly, but they didn't make us feel like we had to hurry up and get out, which we appreciated.This would be a great little ""hidden gem"" to show people from out of town. It's fun, it's inexpensive and it's a true dining experience."
"Heard so many great things about Smoque BBQ that my friends and I decided to make the trip up here to see what all the fuss was about. BELIEVE THE HYPE -- the food is simply amazing. When we arrived, we expected the line to be down the street, but to our surprise, it was very short. We parked on the street right outside the restaurant which was convenient. The has a wide variety of items, but we ended up ordering a full slab of ribs consisting of 1/2 baby backs and 1/2 St. Louis style as well as brisket and pulled pork. For sides, we got mac 'n cheese, brisket chili, fries and cole slaw. The ribs were my favorite by far, namely the baby backs. The meat was incredibly tender and just slid off the bone -- could've eaten a whole slab by myself. With those ribs and a thick slathering of their tangy BBQ sauce, I was in heaven. The brisket and pulled pork were amazing too, both being flavorful and smoky, but didn't quite shine like the ribs. Out of the sides, the brisket chili was disappointing. The flavors were muddled and needed more seasoning. The fries were crispy and hot -- there's something about eating them out of a grease-soaked brown paper bag that makes that much more appetizing. Mac 'n cheese was creamy and cheesy with a slight brown crust on top just how I like it. I enjoyed every part of this meal. I don't even feel bad embarrassing my friends by licking my fingers in public because the food was just that damn good! I will definitely hit this place back up when I get that insatiable craving for BBQ!"
"Some of the best pulled pork I've ever eaten, and the coleslaw is perfect. I wanted to mention the great service - We came in about 45 mins before closing. By the end of our meal, it was after 9pm (Sunday closing hour), and without thinking about that we went back to the counter to order some bread pudding. They initially told us the register was closed (which we understood, it was after closing), but as we sat finishing our beers, one of the folks from behind the counter came out and gave us two servings of bread pudding to go! Totally didn't have to do that, but it was very generous of them to do so. And the bread pudding was FANTASTIC! Will definitely be back when I travel to Chicago again."
"best bar-be-cue ever. The place itself is cramped, but they have expediters that get and orchestrate seating for guests. and it really works. I cant say enough about the food though, its amazing."
Great food. Decent prices. They know how to run a business. I especially like their corn bread.
The pulled pork was simply amazing! I also loved their ribs. I didn't care for the peach cobbler because it didn't have a lot of crust and personally I think that's what makes peach cobbler taste so good.
"This is an amazing restaurant and experience. The decor is phenomenal and the service is better. Eat until you're stuffed and you'll be a happy patron. Nina was a great waitress, and I'm very happy with my choice. Check out the rooftop deck"
"Solid place for good BBQ.  Never have had a bad meal here, though I have only had 4 or 5 of the items they have for sale.  The baby back ribs have a really good dry rub and the bbq sauce that they have works really well with the ribs.  Ask for the spicy for added kick.  The corn bread which comes in a muffin tin is great to sop up the left overs"
"Yum!!  We have ate at Smoque twice and love it there!!!  The food is great.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was fabulous.  I had to share it because the portions are big.  I also liked the Mac and cheese.  My husband and sons favorite thing on the menu is Texas Sausage.  My other son had the ribs and recommends them also.  Last time we sat between two groups and had so much fun.  One group was a bunch of older guys who has been friends for years and were a kick.  They had a cooler of beer and offered us one.  So, my point is 1) BYOB and 2) you will share a table with other people.  Make the most of it and enjoy meeting them.Great food.  Cheap alcohol.  Friendly people.  What more can you ask for??"
"I was in the city today and decided it was time to give this place a try. Since I live about 30 miles from Smoque, take out isn't really a good option. So dine-in, it was. I waited about 15 minutes until they took my order, then was assigned a table right next to the waiting line of people that I had stepped out of. The idea of dining amidst a human canyon isn't a good one and very nearly knocked this place down a star or two rating-wise.But after enjoying a brisket sandwich with fries and cole slaw, I just couldn't do it. This is the best BBQ I've ever had. The brisket was tender, nicely placed on a fresh bun - and a fairly good amount of meat too. The sauce wasn't too hot or too sweet - it was right there - the perfect accommodation for beef that was so thoughtfully cooked. Fries were good and the cole slaw was delicious as well - sometimes vinegar cole slaws are a little harsh - this was just fine.This place really needs a little more room and a better place for people to wait in  line. Seating was fine - the staff has it together that way, but it was a little aggravating to have all these people stand around me, along with an occasional touch of cold air coming from the exit door about 10 feet away. I was there on a Saturday around 2PM - not exactly prime time - I can only imagine it being worse at other times. Nonetheless, when I'm in the area at an even slower time of day, I'll certainly consider a return to Smoque - savored every bite!"
"Wow.  Probably the best smoked brisket in the midwest.  I haven't been to many places in Texas, but Smoque competes with the best of them. WOW!"
"Good, interesting, delicious, but not great."
"Amazing BBQ.  The ribs, pulled pork, and brisket are to die for every time I have them!!!   Get there early and it's BYOB so bring some beer or wine with you.  Great choice!!"
"Absolutely loved the food here. Had half a slab of baby back ribs, Mac and cheese, and fries.  Being a first timer here I did expect a different ambiance. I thought it was a sit down type of place where a waiter/waitress takes your order. You actually order your food at the register and grab it there. Overall a really comfy at home type of feel place. Will definitely be returning."
"Smoque is one of the few good BBQ joints where you can get a full meal with your barbecue and not just fries/ bread in the city. Took the nephews for dinner a few months ago and I remember getting: Ribs for the boys and brisket for me, Mac n cheese, greens, beans, cornbread and peach cobbler. It was great! I highly encourage you all to ask for burnt ends with your brisket. They are awesome! Get ready for a loooong wait, hungry faces staring at you calculating if they will get your seat.( when we were there management were seating/clearing tables) We even met the owners(eye candy ladies!) He was so sweet to me..gave me some free stuff to take home and extra ribs for Josh because he remembered him from Diners, Drive In, and Dives."
"Dried pulled pork, don't really know why  people line up at thi place most Mexican carnitas are much better."
"I love this place. I try to go as often as possible. I'm not one for sweet barbecue ribs, so this place is perfect for me with the dry rub ribs. They're coleslaw is unlike any other also not sweet but, very vinegary and I love it. My son and I always share a rack of ribs as well as a kids brisket sandwich. My husband loves the pulled pork sandwich. Honestly when you walk in to here you want one of each, which is why they have a small portion called a taste. The Mac and cheese is amazing. The fries are great. I'm not much of a fan of sitting at a table with other people I don't know, who are having loud conversations. I. Usually take my food to go and only make it to the car. I go as often as I can! Highly recommend this place!"
Recently I was stuck at the children's intensive care unit for 5 days of misery. One day a ray of sunshine came through the door- the March of Dimes organized a Father's Day lunch for the families stuck there. Smoque was generous and kind enough to donate some excellent brisket. Thanks for making my stay a bit better!
"OMG!!!! I went here for the first time last month, I cannot say enough about how awesome the food and service are.I had the pulled pork and my friend had the brisket, this is the best place to go for bar b que.The wait staff is incredible and they help keep the place spotless. There was a long line, but the food and service are well worth the weight."
Epic place.  Epic.
Great little location with free parking. Louis ribs are fantastic. I'm not a fan of cheese but  the macaroni and cheese is unbelievable delicious. The fries is awesome as well. Probably the best BBQ in town. This is definitely a spot for you!
"Stopped here for lunch on our way through the city. It's been highly recommended by friends for years and, as I discovered, for good reason.We opted for sandwiches. I had the chopped brisket and the husband had the 1/2 and 1/2, which is half chopped and half sliced. I ate about half of mine, which he happily finished. The   macaroni and cheese is awesome - creamy with sharp cheddar and a nice sprinkling of toasted breadcrumbs on top. The coleslaw was good, but not fantastic, especially in comparison to everything else. We ended with the peach cobbler and weren't disappointed -- huge pieces of peach topped with a cinnamon crumble crust. It tasted vaguely of fruit punch, but not in an unpleasant way.The good news is we loved it. The bad news is that it's ruined all other barbecue for us."
"I was a little late to the party since this was my first Smoque outing. We got a little bit of everything and LOVED the sausage. Two different sauces although the flavors were similar. BYOB, always a plus. Good place with nice options to sample different styles. It's no Salt Lick but what is!"
"I really don't like BBQ food. When I think of BBQ food, I think of burnt burgers from a grill at a friend's house. You would just squeeze a condiment of your preference on your burger. It does not appeal to me one bit.As exaggerating as it sounds, Smoque BBQ blew my mind away. It was that good. The beef brisket sandwich was delicious. It was slightly burnt and had a nice texture to it. You get BBQ sauce with it too. Now this is good BBQ food. Try all their side dishes, they are all fantastic. I really liked the peach cobbler and the cole slaw. The peach cobbler...fresh pieces of peaches and a nice crumble on top. Amazing! I don't like cole slaw from Popeye's, KFC, or grocery stores but the cole slaw here is fresh and a vinegar base which makes you crave for more."
"I should preface this review by saying that I eat beef and pork very sparingly, so a BBQ place isn't really my thing. That said, I was excited to try the chicken platter at Smoque when I came here for dinner recently with a group of friends. Unfortunately, the chicken did not live up the restaurant's description and was quite possibly the driest chicken I've ever eaten. I ended up eating about a quarter of it and then gave up. The sides, however, were excellent. I loved the cole slaw, cornbread, and mac n' cheese. If I come back, I would probably get all sides and skip the meat altogether.Other people in my group ordered the brisket and pork. No one really liked the pork; people reported that the brisket was pretty good.Be warned that this is not a place to sit and linger. Because there's a line to get in, you should expect to eat quickly and go."
"This place is the amazing!  We arrived around 6pm just before the line started if your planning to go get there early.  I have been to a lot of BBQ places I usually am very disappointed with brisket and always nervous to order it. So at Smoque I decided to order 1/2 rack of St. Louis and a brisket taste (4oz). This was the best brisket I have ever had it literally melted in my mouth. The bark was perfect not a over powering rub it was about the beef! They did put sauce on the serving but just a touch, it didn't need it but at the same time I was happy it was there it just add another layer of OMG! It was super juicy with just the right amount of smoke and moist moist moist!  I also got a 1/2 rack of St. Louis style which like the brisket had a great bark, smoke and perfect rub. The meat was moist without sauce and the flavor very much about the pork!  Now to the sides most places I have been to the sides are just sides and seem to get less attention. We got Baked beans, corn bread, cole slaw, brisket chili, Mac and cheese and fries.  The baked beans were the star of the sides absolutely amazing with a great smokey flavor! All the other sides were great as well fresh and flavorful. If your in Chicago make sure you don't miss out on this gem of a BBQ place.  Can't wait to go back some day!"
"I stopped in at lunch time on a Tuesday and found nearly every chair filled with good, solid northwest Chicago stock. The kind of guys who wear Haggar dress slacks, collared shirts, and Bluetooth earpieces. The kind of guys who always ""have a guy""...and their fathers, the ""guys"" that other guys have. ""Indipindint CANtrakerz.""Not that this, the joint's 1,630th review, is going to be the tipping point for you, but Smoque's darn tasty.Well-smoked baby backs. Particularly tasty slaw. All-you-can chug fountain drinks.  $18.01 with tax for a half-slab, slaw, two sides and a drink. Nice.If I lived off the Blue Line or commuted up the Kennedy, I'd be wearing out the chairs in this place. As a Lincoln Parker, though, I doubt that I will be making the trek again... unless that guy I got takes me over DARE to take a look at a few of his siding jobs."
"Best BBQ I have had so far in Chicago. Super smokey and meat focused; the sauce leans towards the vinegary end of the spectrum which is always a plus in my book! The sides can be hit or miss, but once that smoked pork and brisket is in front of me I have never felt a strong need for anything else. Bonus points for being a place that really brightens up the neighborhood. Old Irving Park does not have a ton of destination dining, but between Smoque and Thai Aree House the ones they have are nothing to turn up your noses at!"
"Great ribs, tasty mac n cheese (small portion), and that's about it. I didn't care for the sauce and small portion sizes for the sides. The coleslaw almost has an Asian dressing that I also didn't care for and the beans were meh. This is really all based on my personal preference. If you like vinegary sauces... This is the spot for you."
The best. Hands down. Great at dealing with the crowd.  Food impeccable.
"I went with some work colleagues, always good to get a dinner of grilled meat.  Typical BBQ style with grilled meat and sauce on the side.  It was good and decent for the price.  They control the seating so be aware there's a system.  It wasn't crowded when we were there, but I can see it probably get crazy when the place is busy."
Daddy Likey Wingy!
Best BBQ joint in town.  Been there too many times to count.  You'd think you were in Texas (although thank God we don't have to be). Try the chopped brisket.  A guy I know who smokes his own meats was really impressed with it.
"smoque is the reason i started to eat BBQ; i WISH i was joking! smoque is the reason i started branching out into other areas of BBQ lovin'.smoque is amazing. their style is unique and their sides are also amazing. their mac n cheese is the best! i also enjoy their cornbread. all their food is rich in taste. their BBQ is rich in flavor. my favorite is the slice brisket platter.their coleslaw is to die for; add a little pepper to that bad boy and have yourself a feast! i highly recommend smoque to everyone who loves BBQ, not because it was on  diners, drive-ins, and dives."
Mmmm mmmmm delish!!! The Mac and cheese is delish!! Pulled meat sandwiches are great!
"We had the pulled pork, ribs and sausage.  I would say that the pulled pork and sausage were excellent with a lot of smokey flavor.  The ribs were fairly bland even though there was a nice crust on the top.  The sauces that accompanied the meats were very tasty so, it is a must to have them with the ribs.  Macaroni and cheese were so so and the cole slaw was more salad than slaw.  I would definitely go again and go all out with the pulled pork!"
"Best bbq in the area, by far. I love it all. Their beans are made with the bbq sauce, which btw, is so good I could drink it."
"Smoke is hit or miss for me. Some days they hit it out of the park, and other times, dare I say, the ribs are way too smokey. It tastes like they doused them in liquid smoke. The sides are always really good. I'll still go to Smoque every once in awhile, but I won't deal with the wait if I'm starving."
Consistently good BBQ in Chicago. Plus the sides are equally good. My favourite is the sliced brisket.
Best brisket I've had outside of Texas.  I have yet to try anything here I that doesn't exceed my expectations.  By far my favorite BBQ place in Chicago
"Let me start off by saying that I love ribs.  I could eat them every day, but I was not  impressed with the ribs at Smoque.  I like ribs that are falling off the bone and every time I have given them another try, I find myself ripping the meat off and scared I am going to lose a tooth in the process!  On the bright side the pulled pork, mac & cheese and peach cobbler are delicious!  If they could get the ribs cooked how I like, I would be much more of a fan."
Other than the small amount of seating this place is awesome! The baby back ribs are the best I've ever had. The pulled pork also the best. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. Well worth the money you'll drop here. But you'll save bringing in your own liquor!  Highly recommended! Will definitely be going back!
"I was pretty disappointed with Smoque.  I had heard great things about this place from friends who used to live in the neighborhood.  When I walked in, I noticed that while it was not packed, the scene was chaotic. In other words, the staff obviously did not have their stuff together.  I would hate to come when it is crowded.  My friend ordered a 1/2 brisket sandwich, chopped, and I ordered a 1/2 brisket sandwich sliced.  The bread felt cheap, like the Hawaiian buns you buy at the jewel.  While the traditional BBQ sauce was delicious, the vinegar sauce had a terrible aftertaste; I love Carolina BBQ, so I love vinegar sauce. The brisket was dry as a bone, even after I dumped BBQ sauce on it, and the rub did not have much of a flavor. I have made better brisket at home.  I was shocked.  The mac and cheese had an excellent crust, although their choice of cheese blend was disappointing because it was rather bland.  The best part, by far, was the cole slaw, which is saying something because it was just cabbage, Italian Dressing, and red onions.Honestly, the City of Chicago has really poor BBQ choices, with the suburbs having much better quality and much better selection.  I would make the trip out to LaGrange, Westmont, or Naperville than get some substandard BBQ that doesn't satisfy my craving."
"Smoque was good...very good! What brought me in the door was some out of towners from London that saw it on the Food Network, and I am glad they dragged me there (I was weary of the line that was out the door) because the line was worth the wait! The mac and cheese firstly, was to die for. I wish I had a bigger one. The brisket was so tender and flavorful, I highly recommend getting it sliced and not chopped (it stays more moist). I tried both ribs and liked the baby back ones the best. One more thing-- as suggested by the name, the meat is SMOKY. The smoky flavor is what makes it but it can be a bit overpowering as well. Be prepared!"
The BBQ was good but the sides were just ok (thus the 3 stars). Overall staff if nice and restaurant seems like a cozy neighborhood place.
ok me and my friends went here on a fat kid adventure and this place was really good. The place has a very relaxed vibe when u walk in. There is a big huge chalk board with the menu written on the board. i got the pull pork sandwhich and a side of mac and cheese. the wait wasnt to long for as many people that where in there. The sauce was really good wasnt to sweet or to tangy the mac and cheese was sooooooooooooooooo good the portion they give u just isnt enough. i would visit this place again and also it is byob so that is always a plus
"I've been going to this place for about 4+ years now. Since then there have been a handful of very good BBQ spots that have been opening up in neighboring parts of the city, but this is still my go-to spot when I want great BBQ. My standard orders are usually brisket or St Louis ribs (sooo good!). The brisket is so tender that when you try to pick up a slice with your fork, it will fall apart if you don't get it into your mouth quickly enough. And friends that I have gone with also speak fondly of their pulled pork (personally I have never tried it), and when I feel like something else besides red meat, I go for their chicken. I know most people might think, ""Chicken? Really? If I'm going to get BBQ, I'm getting red meat."" Well I've been here enough to want to change it up from time to time, and their chicken is EXCELLENT. Easily some of the juiciest, most flavorful chicken I have even tasted.They also have pretty tasty sides. I'll start with their 'slaw. If you order a plate or sandwich, the 'slaw comes with it. Personally I think creamy 'slaws are disgusting, and until I went to Smoque I thought ""creamy"" was the only type of 'slaw out there. Smoque's 'slaw is vinegar based and is pretty damn amazing. Whenever I go, I get a large container to go, to have as a side with my lunches. Their beans, mac n'cheese and fries are all must tries as well. I'm not a fan off their cornbread, but I know some that are; and from what I hear their peach cobbler is pretty damn tasty as well. I've never had it, because by the time ""dessert"" enters my mind, I am stuffed! I will say that if you're thinking of carrying out, you may want to have realistic expectations. I've carried out 3-4 times and EVERY single time, the meat is too rare on the brisket. I feel like they may just save the rarer stuff for the to-go orders since most people don't check their food until they get home. I'm not say that's 100% the case, but it's hard for me to believe that my luck is THAT bad. That being said, I've never been any less than absolutely satisfied, when I dine in... hence the 5 star rating. I'd recommend this place to anyone living in Chicago who hasn't tried it, and anyone passing through (and I actually did. I had family in town from FL a few weeks ago and I told them to go. My uncle is VERY picky when it comes to food, and he said it was the best BBQ he's ever had in his LIFE!!!).  :)"
"4.5 stars for Takeout. we had a large order for a backyard bbq party and everything was really phenomenal. Brisket and pulled pork especially blew everyone away.3 stars for eat-in. just don't think what I got was worth the wait and their sauces were just OK, nothing really ""wow."" I know I wouldn't go back and wait around for it again."
Ordered a half slab of ribs via takeout a few weeks ago on a Sunday night - some of the best ribs I've ever had.
"Booya! This place rocks!! Melt in your mouth brisket, crisp and tasty sausages and the ribs are out of bounds! Dont miss out on their coleslaw or cornbread either!"
"Not bad. I got the brisket platter with Mac and cheese, fries, brisket chili, and cornbread. The brisket was excellent. Not dry at all. The fries are hand cut and very good. The Mac and cheese was pretty good. The brisket chili tastes like vegetable soup with little pieces of brisket in it. The cornbread was dry and below average."
"my most recent visit to smoque was by far the best, my bf and i ordered and enjoyed our yummy brisket. When it was time to leave, a worker noticed and offered to get me to go dishes for my food and also noticed Ryan went back in line to bring some home for his parents. He told ryan to sit down and he can get it for him, he took his order and came back 5 minutes later with the food all ready to go! Thanks so much to the guys at smoque, that's quality service and food!"
"The Brisket and The Ribs do get 5 stars..the place, not so much...The long lines are a drag, the way the push you around in there is something else. They will tell you where and when to be seated. It is one thing when the place is busy perhaps, but they always do this. It is VERY ANNOYING. The slaw is not creamy, more of a vinegar based shredding of cabbage. Not a fan of that. You can get cornbread instead, which is what I suggest...Back to the rules of this place...see the picture I posted here. Kind of says it all.Since they know they are the real deal when it comes to Ribs and Brisket, guess they can get away with an attitude.   They have the best ribs and brisket around Chicago, but if you want a better dining experience and the same good ribs and brisket, just go to Que in LaGrange...it is the same..without the BS."
"Simply the best ribs I've ever tasted, got there before the lunch crowd around 1130 on a Thursday there were plenty of seats to be had.                                                                I originally wanted the St. Louis style ribs but there was a wait. So I opted for the regular baby backs instead. while enjoying my meal the gentleman I placed my order with (who I believe to be manger)  came out from the kitchen and informed me the st.louis ribs were cooked and he would bring them out, I declined because I already had a half slab but he insisted. He came back with a half slab of the st.louis style on the house! both ribs were dry rub. I'd say if you a dry rub fan this is the place for you. It was nice to see a business that cared enough to go the extra mile for its customers even on my first visit there."
"Great food, very busy.  I like to grab it to take home every now and again"
1/2 1/2 sandwich was goof wish they had the option of making BBQ spicy.  The staff is amazing they where able to give me a table outside for my family.  I would love to try the ribs and chicken next time around.  please call ahead the line gets a bit long.
Love their BBQ
"The best brisket in the city, bar none (with the exception possibly of Whole Foods on Kingsberry).The best ribs in the city, too, for my buck.And to think all this great pork barbecue, and it's owned by a ""family"" member who used to be a trader!!!Ordering at the counter, and they bring it out to you keeps the price down by about 20%, too, though the tip jar CAN and SHOULD BE FED.  L-rd knows, we are well fed there, as are most of the customers you see.Way to go!  Keep it real, Barry!"
Oh so good!
"We go here a few times a year. It's pretty good food (we live on the South side so I have to really be craving it to face the drive), albeit parking can be a PITA. Consistently good food, service is always on point & the the desserts are delicious. My only quibble is that they don't always have the best pick up times for take out & they don't have a branch closer to Hyde Park."
"Loved the baby back ribs platter. It's just delicious. For the sides, we had the mac and cheese along with fresh cut fries. The mac and cheese is good, but the  bread pudding is just unreal! Can't wait to take my friends here."
"It's not fancy. It's not a place to relax nor linger for any length of time. It's not a place to go get boozed up at and have a drink after work. What it lacks in these areas is more than made up for with its freaking delicious BBQ.I recommend the brisket (chopped of course!!!), the pulled pork, and the STL ribs. I inevitably over-order every time I come in, but it would be a moral sin to leave this place hungry. The sides are pretty tasty (had the fries and mac and cheese this last time), but their meat is where they really shine.I've lived in St. Louis and Kansas City, so I know a thing or two about BBQ. Smoque gets it right and at a reasonable price."
"Once upon a time I was a vegetarian...Also, that Mac and Cheese, man."
"finally tried this famous bbq place, got the sausage and brisket, both were really good, and the mac and cheese and cornbread and coleslaw for sides, all were solid. i guess i wasnt as blown away as some are, but its still really good"
"There's a reason this place has almost 2300 ratings.  I thought there was no way it could live up to the hype, but I was proven wrong.  Came here on a Saturday for lunch and surprisingly didn't have to wait for a table (the lovely Chicago weather we've been having probably helped).  Two of us split a sliced brisket platter.  It comes with slaw and two sides.  We couldn't decide on sides, so ended up getting mac & cheese and fries and also a side of cornbread.  Because what's BBQ without cornbread, amirite.    I think the platter is a nice portion for two people to eat if you're not looking to stuff your face to the point of being uncomfortably full.  Obviously, the meat was a great and I enjoyed all of the sides.  Even the slaw, which was more on the vinaigrette side rather than mayo.  The cornbread is also on point.One thing to note is parking is a bit of a pain.  The parking lot is pretty small and the area has a lot of permit parking.  Something to consider when planning ahead."
There are very few places that do BBQ better.
"One of the best BBQ places in Chicago. However, the saying that good things come to those who wait is definitely true when it comes to Smoque. Be prepared to wait in line for your food.  It is definitely worth the wait.You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I would suggest starting with the ribs and cornbread if you have never been there before."
"I've been to KC, Memphis, Dallas. This is good Chicago Q. Uh, uh, ok. Nothing better than that. Chicagoans still have a very low Q IQ. You could do a lot worse but this place doesn't remotely deserve the hype. Go to KC then come back and we'll talk."
"I'm giving Smoque 5 stars because even though it is not the best BBQ I've ever had in my life, it is where I will go EVERY time I want good BBQ in Chicago.  Also, you can get carry out for parties.  This is what you should do for the Superbowl next year.  They are consistently excellent - the line is worth it, plus they move really fast.  Things to get:  Brisket, Pulled Pork , Ribs, mac and cheese, and the slaw.  The sauce is great too. This place is where you get BBQ on the north side.  No doubt about it."
Some of the best BBQ I've had in Chicago. I wasn't to crazy about the buns/rolls they use but that's irrelevant.
"Ordered every single side in the menu. My faves were surprisingly the cole slaw (vinegar based instead of mayo), the baked beans, which had a really nice smokey flavor and the mac and cheese.  Corn bread was average and I found the mini peach cobbler to bee too syrupy sweet.As for main courses, we tried the 1/2 slab St. Louis ribs, 1/2 slab baby back, an brisket sandwich. Sauces included were Memphis, NC, and a spicy sauce that came with candied jalapeños. Overall the meal was good, but expected the meat to be a lot more tender than it was. I later learned that they only smoke their meats for around 3 hours and it's intended to be chewier... But honestly, that's not my preference. I prefer my BBQ to be fork tender and none of these dishes qualified.I've heard about crazy lines, but we showed up on a Thursday at 1 pm and didn't need to wait at all.   Bottom line: I wouldn't discourage you from coming, but I also won't be back."
"Best BBQ in the city. The pulled pork platter is delicious, tender and falling apart. The BBQ sauce has a bite and I love that their coleslaw isn't swimming in mayo. I will definitely be back!!"
"Good gawd, I love good BBQ, and after living for a goodly chunk of my life in the Southeastern US, I know about good BBQ. Smoque is the good stuff. Brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and chicken are all delicious. Sides are well done and tasty. Service is pretty amazing considering how many people come through their door. Great all around"
"The brisket is tender, juicy and sweet. I always add a side order to my chicken or rib order for a savory sandwich the day after. This is one of those places where I have to plan ahead, not my strong suit, otherwise it seems like the wait for service goes on forever. That said, it's always worth it."
"Finally, an oasis in the BBQ desert....For years, Chicago was a place where decent bbq could be had at a reasonable price.   I remember  when places like ""Leon's,"" ""Curt's"" and ""J&B's"" were affordable treats that my parents and I used to look forward to.  Sadly, times changed and before long, prices went up and quality went down.  For years now, I'd considered Chicago, where I was born and raised a place where BBQ could only be purchased from almost upscale places (Carson's), or from places that have bullet proof glass (Alice's, Barbara Ann's).After hearing and reading about Smoque for years, I finally made my way North to give it a try. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.The MeatBaby back Ribs: The center of my BBQ universe.  These did not dissapoint.  The meat was tender and came of the bone easily, but is was easy to detect the smoke that had kissed this meat.  They were delicious and I was sucking bones.  I gave the bones to a co worker for his dogs.  I'm sure they also liked them.  ASt. Louis Ribs:  Even better than the baby back ribs.  Meaty, tender well seasoned.  I am a fan.  A+Pulled Pork:  Good, but not as good as I was expecting from a place like this.  The same as pulled pork you can get anywhere. CBrisket: The only brisket I've had that was better than this was in Houston.  Amazing. Tender, moist and full of flavor.  Get this, even if you usually don't eat brisket.  A+Texas Sausage: very good with a little bit of spice.  Way better than I was expecting, but not the star of the show. BMac & Cheese : While the serving size is small, the mac & cheese is creamy and tasty, baked so that there is some nice crust on the top to add texture.  As a mac & cheese lover, I can't give it an A, but it provides a nice balance for the sauces and well seasoned meat. BBaked Beans: There is a unique taste to them. They are a little sweeter than I am used to and seem as if wine or Worcestershire was used. Another small serving, but good.  My girl was not a fan, but I was. This is my Yelp not hers, so there.  B+Fries:  Hot and crispy, but nothing to slap your mother over.  Make sure you eat them fresh, they won't handle travel well. BThe meat here is wonderful, and the sides are pretty good, if small.  A little pricey but well worth it if you want real Southern style, smoked BBQ. My new favorite place in Chicago for all things BBQ when I'm ok spending a little $"
"I don't pretend to have southern roots, or have the sort of griseled BBQ palate that only develops during decades of smoking meats,  and growing goatee beards.What I do claim, is the knowledge that I've visited the very bottom of the BBQ abyss - practically meatless ribs from my childhood, in England, prepared* by my lifetime-vegetarian mother.*cooked until drier than the turkey from Christmas Vacation.This has given me a unique appreciation for BBQ food,and Smoque is THEBEST.Since it's a bit of a hike, I decided to make my trip worth it. I ordered (between 2 of us) :Brisket (always sliced, never chopped) - unbelievable. Seriously the benchmark against all other BBQ food will be compared, forever. So tender, I didn't need a knife. I can't adequately describe how good this is, so just get it.Rib combo: didn't compare to the brisket, but they were both really good. I was a much bigger fan of the baby back. Super tender and flavourful.Sides: The fries were surprisingly amazing. I don't usually associate these kinds of places with standard bar fare. The beans were good, but the mac & cheese stole the show. Great comfort food. Even though we were stuffed from the meat, we still managed to polish it off before rolling out.Also, it's BYOB.There was a line out the door when I visited, but it moved quickly, and it seemed that most people were getting their food to-go. We found a table without much problem."
After reading all the great reviews I was super excited to try Smoque.I will admit that the sides i had were delish and my ribs were tender but the one bbq sauce they provide was not my cup of tea ( not sweet enough). I much more prefer the  selection of sauces and  free pickles that Q-bbq provides rather than the one sauce fits all approach Smoque  uses. If you do enjoy Smoque's sauce this will probably be a home run for you. .but for me it fell flat
"I kid you not, I nearly climaxed when I was done with my meal. After having the STL style ribs, delicious fries, and BBQ beans, I would have been ok dying in a car accident on my way home. This place is amazing! My tastebuds were never exposed to something so great. Going to Smoque should be on everyone's bucket list. It is a shame that I don't come here often to enjoy the ribs, soft and tender brisket, and everything on the menu. I have also catered from here. They packaged the food very well and the packaging maintains the food very warm. I suggest to eat at the restaurant and then take a few slab of ribs along with 5 pounds of brisket home, you won't regret it.  No need to quest to any other restaurant for BBQ... this place is it!"
"Oh, god. Smoque, you may just kill me! This is one of the best restaurants in the city, and DEFINITELY the best BBQ place I've ever encountered, which includes all the ones I've been to in Southern states. The food is indescribably good, especially the ribs, pork, beef brisket, and of course both types of the BBQ sauce. The meat is so tender, flavorful and cooked with care and ultimate quality.  All the sides are delicious too. This place has excellent customer service, a great ambiance inside and out on the patio, and also great with catering! Trust me... If you choose Smoque to cater your party, the only bad thing is that you'll have to do it for the rest of your life, because every time family visits you, they will say, ""you're going to have Smoque, right?!?"""
"Best BBQ in the city in my opinion. Takeout is very efficient and if you choose to dine in, you normally don't have to wait for a table. It's also BYOB!Everything I've had here is great, but my favorite is the sliced brisket. If brisket isn't your thing, they have excellent pulled pork and ribs as well. Bring an appetite, because you won't want to leave anything on the plate!"
"Solid BBQ, but overrated.  With the growing landscape of legit BBQ in Chicago, not worth a journey."
"I am always coming back to Smoque. There's nothing I've gotten here that isn't awesome. You like BBQ? You like, I don't know, eating delicious things? You should love this place. Pro tip: parking isn't great and it can get wildly crowded. Call ahead and just get takeout. Boom."
Originally the name of this place caught my attention. Usually crowded but that's a good sign when it comes to a BBQ joint. This is my spot now. They do a great job of finding you a seat and it doesn't take long to get your food. I have always ordered the Memphis style ribs (dry rub with no sauce) and they're perfect every time. The pulled pork and brisket are also extremely good. I would compare this place to some of the  BBQ restaurants I visited in Nashville. I've tried most of the sides and have zero complaints.  Brisket chili is da bomb. Parking is easy incase you need to get home before that itis kicks in.
"When I ate meat, which was a few months back, we had a slab of ribs and I think some mac and cheese. The food was not horrible, the place was packed, and it was for sure not memorable, exactly why I cannot remember what we ate. MEH"
"We came here on 5-3-14, On a Saturday late in the day. We were running errands & drove past the place and saw the long line outside the door. We actually waited 55 min but the line moved kinda a quick. I was worried that we might not have a place to sit down and eat, the older gentleman found a small place for us 2 cleaned it off for us. I had the Chopped Brisket A-La-Carte w/ 2 Slaw & 2 sides So I asked for French fries & Mac & Cheese. I had to try the cornbread. My sister had the 1/2 slab of ribs w/ slaw & 2 sides Mac & Cheese ,BBQ Baked Beans. We were both stuffed to the gills. It was really good BBQ. Looking for parking is a diamond in the rough, we drove around 2 times then finally find it in the parking lot behind the place. I would visit again. Also try something different."
"Great ribs, meaty and flavorful.  Sides are average.  Customer service is good but at certain times of day they direct you to seating even if the place isn't crowded, which feels a bit awkward.Overall, though, if I were a local, I'd be here regularly and I definitely recommend you at least try it if you're a barbecue fan."
"If 2000+ reviews was not enough, let's just say in fantasy football you have tiers of QBs, RBs, WRs, etc...3 tiers, with QBs, tier 1 would be Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, Aaron, yeah that guy, tier 2 Jay Cutler, Romo, yada yada...Smoque BBQ is tier 1, Famous Dave's, a tier 2...I recommend highly and can't wait to do the brisket & pork as I hoped today, but forgot to do, and oh yeah, this place is BYOB, can't beat that"
"VERY LONG LINE. About 45min wait. FYI ...You have the option to take out as well.Restaurant is BYOB!!! So bring some booze to drink while you wait in the line. My gf and I luckly had some nice ppl in line share some of their brew with us. Which was awesome. I ordered half n half rib dinner. St louis style (blackened/smoked longer ribs) and bbq ribs. Only received the st louis style with Memphis sauce. So hungry I didnt care. The sauce was tangy at first but grew on me. For sides I ordered the cooked twice fries which were delicious and saved my experience.  The mac n cheese, sweet beans n the desserts (peach cobbler n banana something) were also pretty good. The brisket chili and the cole slaw were mediocre. Nothing really special. Chili tasted like chili from wendys.. which I like but I would have preferred to have ordered another mac n cheese or beans. The side of brisket by itself was pretty good. $5 extra.. definitely worth it. Next time going try the other bbq ribs style to complete my experience. For 2 full rib dinners with 2 sides each, 2 desserts, 2 can pops, a large order of fries and a side of brisket...the total came out to just over $70."
Had to try Smoque because of all the reviews. It was a fine place to eat but not sure if it lived up to all of the hype.  The prices are pretty high - I paid almost $3 for some mediocre Mac-N-Cheese - and there was not much of it. The pulled pork was good. Tried the beans - ok.  Coleslaw pretty good. They need to move the soda machine to a spot that you can get to easier. Place was packed but efficient.
I don't eat pork.... but when I do.. I go here.
"I've eaten at the restaurant and had catering, both experiences were equally good in terms of the food which is a hard feat to pull off.  The ribs are outstanding, some of the best I've had in the city. The cornbread is also one of their better items.  The rest of the pulled meat items are tasty but if you lined them up against others in the city they wouldn't come out ahead, no differentiator. Really solid place but for the hype and the time you can find equal places for cheaper with no wait."
"Easily the best beef brisket I've ever had, (but I haven't ventured into the south.)I ordered the brisket platter ala carte and it hardly fulfilled my appetite.Given the sparkling 4.5 stars through 2200 reviews, I thought this place was just slightly, slightly disappointing -- especially considering how much I paid for a few slices of brisket."
"Very well cooked BBQ, although their sauce is average. Like that they are closely located to my work, but parking can be tough. Food comes out quickly. Overall, great experience. My fav here are the ribs and the chicken."
"I love Smoque. I've eaten here countless times, and it's a place with food so good that it tastes exactly the same every time. Really great service too. I love their brisket, mac and cheese, corn bread and peach cobbler. They nail everything."
Came here this past Sunday and it's Tuesday and I'm still thinking about the ribs!! Had to come all the way from the south loop for these ribs and they were worth the traffic. Also the peach cobbler was amazing only thing that kinda made me upset was that the Mac and Cheese was not big enough but other than that I had a wonderful experience dining here
"Overall: The BBQ combination of quality, speed, and price is pretty tough to beat from Smoque. One of the better BBQ spots in the city and certainly worth the trek up. Be careful going on the later end as they can run out from time to time.Do Go: If you love Texas style BBQ (and are willing to accept that you're not sitting at the Salt Lick) and you're looking for a laid back, BYOB feel.Don't Go: If you're a native Texan who can't be placated by Yankee rubs. I promise you this much: you'll have a hard time finding better this far north.Dream Team...Meats: Brisket and RibsSides: BBQ Beans and Mac & CheeseDessert: Peach Cobbler (only option but still delicious)"
"The best BBQ in the city. Possibly the best BBQ outside of Texas. I had pulled pork, jalapeno cheddar sausage, mac and cheese, bbq beans, and slaw. The pork was juicy and melted in my mouth. The sausage was smoky and spicy, with a crisp casing without being dry. The sides were delicous. Nothing needed the smoky bbq sauce, but I still put it on everything. Can't wait to be back to try the brisket and ribs. Everything on my plate was consumed, and I collapsed into a food coma without regrets."
"I really can't add anymore than what has already been said about Smoque. I ordered the baby back ribs, mac n cheese and baked beans. The sides were just ok (I think the portion size for the mac n cheese could be bigger) but the ribs are to die for! I'll definitely be back!"
"I'd been looking forward to coming to Smoque for a VERY long time. The boyfriend and I came in on a Tuesday night and there was no line which was exciting. We had both anticipated a wait! The ordering process is easy and we were directed to a table right after we ordered/paid. Everything is very reasonably priced!I had the sliced brisket sandwich and it was delicious. Tender, flavorful, loved every bite. I have to give credit to Aidan L. for the discovery, but the spicy rib sauce was incredible and trumped their regular BBQ sauce by a million. Definitely head up to the counter to ask for a container of this! I also loved the vinegar based coleslaw and the mac n' cheese. Serving sizes of the sides aren't overwhelmingly large, but it's definitely enough food to get you full. The boyfriend really enjoyed his pulled pork/brisket combo with fries. We also shared a little side of cornbread which was very tasty. Overall, in addition to the thousands of reviews already posted for Smoque, I would go during the week and absolutely order brisket and mac n' cheese, ensuring you pick up a side of the spicy rib sauce."
We ate there a few days ago and the place had great ribs. Great place and would recommend it anyday.
I will start salivating before I come eat here because the food is always amazing. the staff are fast and friendly too. It sucks when they run out of certain meat later in the day but that rarely happens. one of my favorite restaurants :)
"Small cramped place with seating problems. This is why they miss 5 star rating from me.They have amazing brisket and great Mac n cheese.The ribs are tender and smokey, the BBQ is pretty much ok too.Nice place to hang out with friends."
"There are those who would be grimacing if they saw me give this excellent BBQ joint only 3 stars. But I tell the truth, and the overall truth at that. Yes, their food is delicious. But the four times I went there (seems like enough times to be considered fair), one time they were a victim of their own success outright, having a sign in the window which said they were out of many of their items. Sadly, we had waited in line just to get to that point. The other three times, even with a shorter line, the experience is very much a 'cattle call' style: wait in line to get in. wait in line to place your order. wait to get an open available table. mull around for your name/number to be called when the food is ready. It's not table service, in other words. It's counter service. And for these prices, I'd like to have a better dining experience.That being said, the food is very good. Flavors are excellent. Why, however, has food been received cold or room temperature, if it's coming from the staff to me? I don't know, but about 1/3 of the time, that's happened. I will say, the staff is friendly even as they rush people from one position to the next. They are handling high volumes of food and people, so it's to be expected in such a small space.I'd suggest going off hours for a less hurried experience. It's a tight fit, but the food is worth it. Yes, there are other barbeque joints out there, but I like the variety myself. I have definitely enjoyed my dining elsewhere, but I am glad that I've eaten at Smoque and do recommend it."
"The food here is so amazing. I generally hate BBQ, and my mouth is watering thinking of their brisket sandwich. Mac and cheese is also great, as is their peach cobbler. My only complaint is that we called ahead to order takeout at 3 pm on a Saturday, and it still took over an hour to get, including over 20 minutes waiting in the restaurant before they gave us our takeout. It's the only thing keeping me from coming back all the time, because the food is outrageously good."
"I went there before the dinner rush so their was no wait.  I tried a half an order of each rib, the sliced brisket, and the tasting of pulled pork. For sides I tried the mac and cheese, fries, coleslaw, and peach cobbler.  Everything had really good flavor and was very smokey :) I would order the same things over and if I went with more people, maybe more of it!  The sides are really good also! Peach cobbler is so yummy!"
Best Ribs in Chicago. Who needs Rib Fest? Taste the Variety Here. From pulled pork to full racks! Yum! And the Mac and cheese is even better. Enjoy!
"Love, love this joint! I do wish there was one closer as I have quite a ways to drive to get it. If you want tender, flavorful ribs this is the place for you. Oh my goodness is the sauce the bomb I could drink it by itself, the mac and cheese is great, the slaw is tart yet so tasty I get a second serving to go. All in all, try everything on the menu."
I have gone a number of times and it is that good.  I have always gone on off hours so it is even better I guess from some of the reviews.  hits on all points and if your out that way or jump off at Pulaski from the highway give it a go
"Best ""non high end"" BBQ in Chicago, hands down."
I usually switch between the ribs and sliced brisket. Today got the slice brisket a la carte. For my sides I got peach cobbler and baked Mac and cheese. Everything was delicious and on point. I always bring my friends by here if they crave bbq. I would go at non peak hours so you don't have to wait.
"I LOVE this place. It's become a tradition for my girlfriend and I to stop here and eat on the way home from the airport.Don't be put off by the long line. The seating is flipped quickly and efficiently by the restaurants super friendly staff. Honestly though, I'd wait a long time for BBQ this good.I've tried everything on the menu and everything's good, but the brisket (sliced) is especially good. The sides are fantastic as well, the beans are were a sleeper surprise for me... fantastic!There isn't better BBQ in the city. This place is quickly become a Chicago institution!"
"I enjoyed my visit to Smoque, everything I ate was tasty.  That being said, unless I happen to be in the neighborhood, in the mood for some bbq I doubt I'll be returning soon.  Personally, I think that there are a few spots in the city that are just as good if not better... still, If you haven't been I encourage you to try it.Some pros: al carte sides (maybe a little pricey for the size)seating available in a very busy restaurantpeach cobbler!"
"A buddy of mine had Smoque cater his Christmas party. I had long been wanting to try it after reading and hearing many glowing reviews. Everything I had heard held up. The food is verrrrry tasty. I was surprised actually at how moist the brisket was, considering the catered food had been sitting out a while. The pulled pork was excellent, and the mac and cheese was top notch. I cannot wait to go to the actual restaurant and get the full experience. BBQ lovers need to eat here. ASAP."
"I guess being from Texas, I was excited to hear about ""Texas-style"" BBQ in Chicago.Did not live up to expectations, sadly. The staff was incredibly friendly and courteous, and the sauce itself was good, but the meat was dry and just not as flavorful as I am used to. :(The quest continues."
Holy Smoque!!!  Best brisket sandwich I've ever had.  Go there.  Eat.  It's amazing.
Awesome!!!!
Best bbq I have ever tasted. The sliced brisket is so mouth watering and tender. Saturday seems to be extremely busy but worth the wait. Love this place!
Good sauces.. Not so much the meat but average BBQ joint. a little bit exaggerated from the bib gourmand in my opinion...
It's the best place to eat in Chicago! Most of the time it's really busy. I love their pulled pork & sliced brisket. My favorite is by far the Mac and cheese! I didn't rate it 5 stars because their cashier isn't the friendliest. When my boyfriend and I were ordering she wasn't speaking or making eye contact. She didn't even ask what type of side we wanted. But overall amazing food!
Not certain to what degree reviewers take their bbq but this place is ok at best. Perhaps its because there aren't a ton of joints to choose from in the city. This is a small and cozy spot that will fill your plate no doubt. Definitely worth a try considering the options around the neighborhood.
Took a taxi to get here from Wicker Park. It was worth it. Not my favorite Chicago BBQ but in my top 7. Waiting was the hardest part.
"I recently moved to Irving Park for the summer from Spring, Texas and had to try the much hyped Smoque. It was crowded and noisy but what BBQ place isn't? The beans were terrific with good flavor, the slaw excellent and the Mac and cheese very good. The brisket was moist, tender and almost devoid of flavor. There didn't appear to be a rub on it, just black smoke without much taste. The meat grey. It almost seemed like someone cooked it in water and finished it in a smoker. My wife, who was reluctant to go with me, said on previous visits, the taste was about the same but the meat dry. Sorry but this wasn't close to the real thing."
"Before you could get the peach cobbler as part  of your meal, now you have to pay extra for it. Not a happy customer"
"I love when I order takeout and the server says, ""congratulations"" as he hands me my bag. I feel like I just won the lottery. A sweet, savory lottery."
"Still living, with a mad craving for some good bbq, I finally made it to Smoque before it closed for the night. I walked in at a quarter to 9pm on a Sunday and was greeted by a friendly young man, ""Hello, ma'am.' I was afraid he was gonna tell me they were closed, but when I asked, 'Are y'all still open?' he smiled and opened a hand toward the counter.I stepped up and ordered a pulled pork sandwich a la carte and a brisket platter entree with french fries and peach cobbler as my two sides. I was even offered, ""For here, or to go?' I ordered carry-out and sat down to wait. My number was called and I was handed a bag full of piping hot food that smelled delicious. When I got to the car I noticed it wasn't even 9 o'clock yet. Wow, quick service.I couldn't help but sample the fries on the way home and they were sooo good!When I got home and ate my meal, it was all I could have asked for, and more. The meat was perfectly tender. If you want sauce on your brisket you'll have to pour it on, because it's too tender to dip. The slow-cooked brisket tasted similar to that my grandma used to make. I really enjoyed it. I tried a piece of the pulled pork sandwich, and it, too, was really tasty. I like that they put the sauce on the side. I'm a dipper, I love sauces, but the meat is just as delicious without it. The entree also came with a side of slaw which is vinegar based and made with fresh cabbage.The peach cobbler was really flavorful and I like how it was served in an individual tin, and that it was warm. I would add a little more crust and/or almonds to the topping, so it' s a little thicker, but that dessert was absolutely nothing to complain about!I was in the restaurant just a few minutes before they closed as I awaited my carryout order, and while there were loads of customers still eating at the tables and a bunch of workers moving about, it didn't have a stressful atmosphere at all. The people who work there all had super friendly demeanors and the food I was served was hot and delicious.Everything I ordered at Smoque tonight was fresh and tasty and I recommend this restaurant highly if you're in the mood for some good BBQ and southern style comfort food. I will most definitely be back and look forward to trying some other things on the menu, as well.Keep up the good work guys. You rock."
"Best bbq ever! Brisket so moist. Ribs falling off bone. Peach cobbler super good Was very impressed by staff who helped our party of 5 plus a toddler find seats quickly. We've eaten here before, but wish we could come in from our suburban home more often. Prices reasonable. We'll be back!"
"Good just expensive. We got carry out so that we could avoid the lines. We ordered chicken (7 out of 10), brisket (10), pork ribs (9) and peach cobbler. I usually love chicken but the ribs and brisket  were better. The peach cobbler was good but  a bit too sweet to finish it all."
"Best barbeque in the city of Chicago, hands down.  Best brisket this side of central Texas.  No joke."
"One of the best BBQ joints that I have been to in Chicago. But the atmosphere is nothing special, just bare looking tables and chairs. Also the place is always Packed so that can be kinda annoying. But the food is top notch."
"Good food and love the way everything is set up so you can actually sit and eat! Wasn't wowed by the ribs, but everything else I've had there was pretty good. The prices are really good too. Not sure it's my favorite place, but it's definitely one of the better places around."
"Really and truly the best! I had the pulled pork, mac n cheese, and coleslaw. My partner had the brisket and baked beans. All of it was wonderful!"
Had high expectations from all the reviews online.   Disappointed at the food.  We had the baby back ribs and the brisket.  The ribs were sub par and the brisket was average.  I'm was not a big fan of the sauce either. Mac and cheese was good.
Everything was great. Only negative thing I have to say about it is how small it is. Sitting right next to some one you don't know trying to eat some BBQ can be a challenge lol. I think in some years to come they should really think about expanding! Pulled pork sandwich and peach cobbler and fries were really good!!!
"The food here is great! I have had the chopped brisket sandwich, the pulled pork sandwich, and, of course, the baby back ribs. All of the meat is super tender. I had the ribs to-go, but they still had the smokey smell when opening the box! The BBQ beans, fries, and cornbread are all really good too. The cornbread has corn kernels inside. The cole slaw is a bit vinegar heavy, but I still eat it. I will definitely return!"
"I live in the West Loop.  I've driven here twice - and convinced a friend from the South Loop to do the same.  This place is VERY good.  Be prepared to share a platter though - the food is delicious and filling and you get a lot of it. I can't highlight any single item because I really like all of them!Brisket, pulled pork, mac and cheese, baked beans - yum!"
Always a meat eaters thrill!
"i feel bad giving this place 3 stars, but i think i'm just a bbq snob. after having bbq in the meccas of austin, lockhart, and kansas city, this place does not come close to ranking. however, i will give credit where it's due!  the brisket is delicious, probably one of the most tender i've ever had. however, what lacked is the genuine smoky flavor and seasoned goodness compared to other briskets. the ribs were also very good, and i'm quite picky about ribs. Get the St. Louis style ribs for sure - way more flavor than the baby back. the pulled pork was just okay. Me and my husband both enjoyed the sausage too. For sides, we had the brisket chiii and baked beans. the chili was a little disappointing, it didn't quite meet my expectation, but the beans were delicious.For dessert, we had the bread pudding, which i highly recommend.Overall, i'm glad we tried it and it's probably the best bbq you can find up here in chicago."
"Some of the best BBQ I've had anywhere! Definitely the best in Chicago! Everything is great and mouth watering, the brisket is the standout. If you want excellent BBQ go here, no questions asked. There will be a line, but it moves quick and it will be worth it."
"Oh Smoque I do love thee. I don't know if it's a curse or a blessing that your location is a pain in the ass to get to. On the bright side, I still have some money left, my white shirts aren't all stained in BBQ, and I can still run to catch a bus. Despite the location, it's always busy, a tribute to the food. So delicious. BYOB is a very nice touch too. Your eyes will always be bigger than your stomach. The amount of food you receive is deceptive, and I promise you will be full from the platter. If you go during peak hours (Friday or Saturday nights) be prepared to wait. It is worth it, just remember to bring a 6-er along with you, since there is not much else around here. Enjoy!"
Good BBQ in Chicago can be hard to find - Smoque would probably be on the top of my list.
"You know this is real BBQ when you walk in and that smell of smoke hits you.  I was not a big brisket fan until I went here.  The brisket is one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life.  It's that good.  But you have to get the sliced (fatty) brisket.  The fat is rendered so well that it melts in your mouth.  Sauce should be used as little as possible so you can taste that smoky meat.  The pulled pork is hit or miss.  I've had it when it was smoky and delicious, and I've had it when it was bland.  Babyback ribs are great.  I only tried them, so I want to order a slab next time.  St. Louis Ribs are good too, but I liked the babybacks better.  Fries are some of the best anywhere too.  Mac N Cheese is very good too.  You can sub the cole slaw for a cornbread muffin too.  They can get busy, so expect a short wait of 10-15 minutes.  There is a patio for outside eating.  I am mystified how popular they are and there is only the one location.  I am sure it will change someday.  This is one of Chicago's new (in the last 10 years) treasures.  I had a friend from Philadelphia come in and I took him to Portillo's (Vienna hot dog, Italian Beef), Al's (Italian Beef), Malnati's (deep dish), Pequod's (deep dish), and Marie's (Chicago thin crust pizza) and he felt Smoque was the best meal overall (though he loved everywhere we went of course!).  I don't even know why you are reading this.  You can see by how many stars this place gets that most people love it.  Expect to pay about $15-20 if you really want to experience this place right and get a couple of meats."
"The short and sweet - Ribs are outstanding. Th long and bitter - The lines go half a block down the street sometimes. The seating is cramped.Conclusion - If you want good ribs, then come to Smoque."
"Simply the best BBQ around!  Had lunch there today.  Stopped in about 12:30, place was 3/4 full and 5 people were in front of me in line. I had my lunch in front of me in less than 10 minutes! Now for the lunch, the baby back ribs were great, the sausage and sliced brisket are simply THE BEST!  The sauce is a great compliment! For sides, tried the cole slaw and chili, both were very good, even though the chili was a little more soupy than I expected. I'd still order it again. Peach cobbler is just the ending of an incredible experience! I STRONGLY recommend Smoque to anyone looking for a great meal!"
"My 300th review goes to a very deserving, Smoque BBQ!!Mmmm...BBQ. I was recently in the area and wanted to try it out due to their popularity. I needed to see what the hype was all about!When we walked in the door, we were greeted by a packed house. We wanted to sit inside so I quickly looked around for an empty table but were soon told that once we placed our order, we would be directed to a table. After viewing all of the choices, we settled on pulled pork. The hype is true...their pulled pork was amazing. They drizzle a bit of BBQ sauce over the pork and they also provide a side of additional BBQ sauce. We also got a side of coleslaw and fries. The coleslaw was probably the best I ever had. It wasn't creamy or sour at all (I find most coleslaw to be this way). It almost tasted like it was tossed in Italian dressing, sooooo good! The fries were also perfect...warm, super crisp and seasoned well. One side order of fries was pretty large so you might want to split with someone.The place does get pretty crowded, but their ordering/seating method works and is very organized. There was someone always walking around clearing tables of trays and then cleaning the table for the next guests. They also provide ample wet-naps to wipe away the sticky mess that is all over your fingers...and possibly face?The parking situation can be a bit difficult. There is street parking and a small back lot that is available only during certain days/hours. You can find non-permit street parking which is a short walk to Smoque."
"We were super excited to finally get to try smoque! We popped in on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch and were pleasantly surprised that the line wasn't too long. Ordered a 1/2 slab of baby back ribs, sliced brisket and a pulled pork sandwhich with sides of mac n cheese and baked beans. The good: The ribs were amazing! Great flavor on the bark and strong smoke so no sauce was needed. Not the most tender ribs but the taste overruled this short coming. Mac n cheese was good as well. Good crust on top cheese blend was good.The bad: The brisket was over cooked and didn't have much flavor. I have seen other post describe it as pot roast like and I would have to agree. Not much smoke flavor, bark was no where close to what was on the ribs.  Overall the brisket wasn't horrible, it just wasn't what I expect brisket to be. The pulled pork was not very smokey and didn't have much flavor at all. The texture reminded me of tuna fish. The bun was pretty boring too. There was really nothing special about the sandwich at all. As for the sauces, they are not even worth mentioning. The service was great though and all the staff were polite and helpful. This is what bumped it up to 3 stars. If I go back it would be specifically for the ribs."
"A must try. 1/4 slab of St Louis Ribs for $4.5. The crust on it makes them ""last meal"" worthy"
Have never been happier after a meal
"Ok, I wasn't impressed the first time I went there but wanted to give them another chance tonight. I'm sorry to say I was even more disappointed this time. I understand the name is Smoque but that doesn't mean everything has to be smothered in that taste. It was a cross between that and burnt flavored. I'm still trying to get the taste out of my mouth. The fries and brisket chili were decent, the baby back ribs and chicken were not. This was definitely not worth $26.00. I wont be back."
"Not much to say, but that it's the best BBQ in Chicago!"
"I miss this joint. It's been a while since I've actually been to Smoque, but I can tell you it's some of the best in Chicago. The prices are a little steep but the experience your mouth will endure is worth every penny. It can get crowded at times so be prepared to wait a little in line. Aside from that, get anything you think you'll like cause it's all awesome!"
Had this place a few times through work events. Amazing! The brisket was so tender and melted in your mouth! Definitely will have to make a trip to the actual restaurant soon!
"Their food is all around amazing. I love love love their salads and homemade dressing and their pulled pork is out of this world. However, I would never come here on a weekend as they get slammed and there is nowhere to sit. Delicious! Writing this is making me hungry!"
I love Smoque! I've been here twice and the 1st time I had the St Louis ribs meal half rack w Mac n cheese and cornbread.  So good! Mouth watering! The 2nd time I had the baby back half rack w max n cheese and cornbread again. Both were fantastic but the St Louis was INSANE! Delicious Mac n cheese and awesome cornbread. And the portions are big!
"Just picked up for dinner on Friday night.  Ordered  on the phone, and the person who took the order was very helpful - as I wasn't certain about portions and sides,.  I asked for a specific time on a Friday night.  It was ready, for  pick up, easy peasy.  I had two Texan's over and they raved!  At one point whispering between one another just how the ribs were. We had such a fun night because every one's mouth was doing the happy dance.  Smoque doesn't rest on it's laurels, they keep their standards up.  Of course, will be back!"
Eat here whenever we get a chance. The brisket is moist - the best in the area.
"I take out beef brisket from this place. The brisket is as good as it gets. I just buy a pound of it, and we eat it for dinner. My wife dreams about it, but the restaurant is not close enough to home to enjoy often.Ribs are OK, but again, nothing compares to their brisket! My 5 stars are for it."
Solid quick service bbq
"I saw the restaurant on Diners, Drive In's, and Dives.  Made it a must to go.  As of now in my life, hands down the best bbq brisket EVER.  Since there were 4 of us, we were able to get a bunch of stuff.  If there is 2 of you, get one full plate and then one ala carte.  Here you go:Brisket - Best everBaby back ribs - good, but too smallPulled Pork sandwich - Big sandwich.  Tasty.  I'd put this as #2 of the 4 we got.  Sausage - good but I'd never order it myself.Cornbread (I asked to substitute the cole slaw for something else.  This was my only choice.  Fine with me) - Absolutely tasty.French Fries - way too many for one person.  Very good.Beans - Best of all the sides.If, I mean WHEN, I go back, my order shall be Brisket with beans, cornbread, and fries (in that order)."
"O.....M......Delicious.....GI went to a wine and BBQ tasting at a wine shop awhile back, and the BBQ, the wine shop proprietor choose to pair with his wines, was from Smoque BBQ .AMAZEBALLS!Don't get me wrong, this place has great BBQ sauce too, but the REAL emphasis is on the meat, the BBQ sauce is a mere after thought in comparison!  It's so smokey and mouth watering and you would not believe how well it pairs with wine!Side story....the dude who made Captin Crunch cereal makes wine (for real people), and his wine was paired with the BBQ.....let's just say after that bite I groaned like I was having an ""adult"" moment.....kinda like When Harry Met Sally....but I'm a better actor.....kinda of groan.I've been to Smoque's restaurant once and loved the experience.  Nothing fancy or flashy, just meat cooked to perfection smokey perfection.  Again, their BBQ is not smothered in BBQ sauce, so if that's your thing, this may not be the place for you.  But if you love to drool over pure, delicious, smokey, and moist meat (omg...that sounds so perverted...HA!) than give this place a go!"
"Bottom line: Finger-licking good.Time: Early dinner around 6:30PMOccasion: Just because. Party of 2.Service: Order and wait.- Even though there is a long line to the register, they don't rush you to make your order.- Fairly quick to get your order out.- Place can get quite cramp so be prepare to make a new friend.Food: Unbelievable.- You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu.- Ribs - Almost falls off the bone. Brisket - Tender. Pulled pork - Juicy. - Coleslaw - my fav because its light and not very heavy to balance the meat.Worth the wait. Love the smell. You will feel full and happy when you leave."
"Lean brisket, delicious beans, coleslaw and cornbread all for under $15. Way better than green street meats. Best BBQ in the city. Haven't had this good of bbq since I was living in Texas."
nothing is bad here - the peach cobbler is to die for and just the right size - no guilt!
"Went here for Valentines day on a date night. And if you are thinking that stuffing yourself silly with pork and side items is as romantic as it sounds. You are absolutely correct.....They were running a special of full rack of ribs and 2 sides for like 18$ I believe. I decided to go big and get this with 2 sides and a extra side of cornbread and a side of some bread pudding concoction they were serving up. The ribs were some of the best I've ever had and it was indeed a full rack. Kinda looked like two racks of ribs stacked on top of each other to be honest. The meals come out on aluminum serving trays and we had some much food they had to bring out a extra tray for our sides. Needless to say, cupid himself would have fallen in love with this meal. For the sides I had some cornbread and brisket chili and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was awesome as well as the brisket chili. The cornbread was good but they serve up the sides in little aluminum cupcake sized containers which are fine for most of the sides they have here but could be a little more generous when it comes to the cornbread. Anyways, they also give you plenty of extra BBQ sauce on the side for dipping and it is sweet, salty, spicy and everything you'd want for a BBQ sauce. The bread pudding was also some of the best I've ever had and it was another one of those cases when I was actually kinda sad when it was all gone. I still cherish it's memory, kinda like you would a childhood pet that was once a important and close part of your life but is now gone forever /sigh.... If you like ribs and great brisket you have to check this place out. I'm looking forward to going back as soon as I can to try out some of their other items."
"The first time I went to Smoque, I was terrified. Terrified that they'd run out of beef brisket. You see, I had gone to a different 'Q joint the week before, and they had run out...so justifiably terrified (or just certifiably food crazy). My fears were unfounded as they had beef brisket a plenty.Ya'll (no? ya'll doesn't work here? sorry, I'll never do that again) are missing out if you haven't tried Smoque. True to its name, the bbq'd meats definitely have that distinct smokey goodness. I tried a little bit (ok...a lotta bit) of everything, and I definitely was not disappointed. And it's not just the meats, it's the sides too! Definitely one of my favorite BBQ joints in the city. Just be prepped to wait for a table if you get there during peak dinner time. Ya'll."
Pretty good food.  Chopped brisket & mac and cheese for the win.
"The ribs and beef brisket are REALLY good. I can't stand the wait on this place but there's a reason why, which is the food is delish. The coleslaw, which i'm not a fan in general is well made and not as greasy or with too much mayo. Mac and Cheese is good but it could improve.Been there three times. Overall great food."
"Awesome food. I've been here multiple times and the food keeps getting better each time. I'd recommend going during non-peak times as when they're busy, you can wait in line for over 30 minutes."
It's pretty good!  I didn't think I'd like it much but I did.
"It was good, but not as I expected."
"SO GOOD! I love BBQ but am a little picky, and this spot definitely didn't disapoint. It's a very casual place that you wait in line to order and then they direct you to where to sit.  We went on a Friday at 7:30 PM, and I was worried the wait would be ridic but it wasn't bad at all. We probably waited 10 minutes which gave us the perfect amount of time to figure out what we wanted. We shared (2 people) chopped beef brisket, half slab baby back ribs, peach cobbler and mac and cheese. I wasn't IN LOVE with the brisket, but it was good. Everything else was delicious. I like my BBQ saucy, so we drenched the ribs in sauce and they ended up giving us a piece extra because they shorted us a little. We didn't ask, they offered! The mac was super creamy but not too heavy. The peach cobbler was the perfect ending to the meal! So awesome!!"
"Best place for ribs and fries!! I love going to Smoque! The food is great, the atmosphere is super chill and it's BYOB! During the summer the line gets pretty long so I would suggest going early if you don't want to wait but I do think it's worth the wait!"
"I want my baby back baby back.  My friend and I were sharing the half slab baby back ribs.  As I was eating my half of the half I was singing it's praises.  She was telling me that she didn't like them.  How come? My half of the half was actually juicy.  Hers?  Not so much, very dry.  We also got the pulled pork which was good -- we paired up the entrees with the following sides: Mac 'n' Cheese, Cornbread, and Baked Beans.  We also got the Peach Cobbler and that was delicious.  Would I recommend coming to Smoque BBQ if you're from out of town?  Probably not.  But if you live in Chicago, then it's definitely worthwhile."
This place is great. I recommend the pulled pork it is amazing. Its small but cozy definitely going back again.
"Years later and another twirl at Smoque, i can sum up my update with one sentence: I have yet to eat bbq made by white people worth paying money for, and certainly not worthy of waiting in line for.  Smoked for 15 hours?? All that really means is the meat is dry ass shit.  You wanna to eat real Ribs? Then you better find a 54-65 year black man named Willie or Joe Ingram who slow cooks his ribs while he is piss ass drunk, on Kingsford charcoal with mesquite chips and makes a sauce you'd put on your cereal.  Im a white boy whose father did business in black neighborhoods and that is what i grew up on and that bbq blows away anything you will eat here."
Delicious brisket and the sides were a perfect match.
Great BBQ. Loved it.
Believe the hype. Delicious. Don't miss the peach cobbler.
Not worth the wait in the long lineTried the baby back ribs and brisket. Preferred the ribs over the brisket. Brisket lacked flavor. The line was long but moving fast. They did a good job in helping people with seating.
"I went a while ago, the food was delicious, but the prices were a bit high.  I love more authentic BBQ and this place was more fad BBQ.  The wait was a while as it's busy because they are popular."
"I had a horrendous experience at smoke tonight. When I arrived at 6 PM I was in formed in a belligerent tone that no brisket was available tonight. Since brisket is the  primary attraction of Smoque,  the restaurant was rendered useless by virtue of this fact. Imagine McDonald's without hamburgers or Hot Dougs without hotdogs. That is the equivalent of Smoque without brisket. There is no excuse for this type of indifference to your customers. If this continues Smoque will no longer be a destination restaurant.  I certainly will not be going back."
Worth the drive. Brisket was great and pulled pork BBQ sandwich was the best. Next time I'll go for the  ribs.Saw this in Fieris DDD book and wanted to try it next time I was in Chicago. The restaurant is situated in a typical Chicago neighborhood and  parking might be a problem. It is certainly worth the traffic and parking.
Had lunch -- the brisket platter is awesome!
"All I can do is cast my eyes down upon what should have been the best meal of my life and ask, why?Smoque, you have indeed forsaken me, and forgiveness from me is not easy to come by.I wanted to like everything about you but I just couldn't do it. If you turned out to be less than perfect, I would have rounded up for you, Smoque. But, I have too much disappointment.When I arrived with an empty stomach, but the line out the door stood in my way, I waited like a trooper and took it in stride. ""Lines mean it's a great place,"" I reassured myself. When I was met by an eerily robotic cashier that took my order, I brushed it off as efficiency at work. When I scanned my surroundings and took note of at the limited seating and the forgettable décor, I was able to push that aside. I promised myself it was because they care about food and not paint swatches.However, when my small portion of pulled pork showed up, lightly dressed in a vinegary sauce that I just wasn't quite a fan off, I was a little saddened. I had some of my girlfriend's chopped brisket and liked it, but was still let down. The mac and cheese arrived in a baby cupcake tin with a cheese sauce that was quite separated and gritty. I then relied on the brisket chili, which should have had a rich barbeque flavor, to be the home run to save the game. However, the dominant flavor was tomato with a tenuous barbeque-ish undertone.Now, don't get the wrong idea, the food was pretty good. However, my goal for the night was not to have something categorized as pretty good.  I have not completely written the place off. For the time and money however, I would recommend the Smoke Daddy."
"After seeing it on DDD, Smoque was one of the first places I went to after moving to Chicago a few years ago.  I was not disappointed!  Smoque has the best BBQ I have had in Chicago, and probably the best brisket I have ever had.  The sliced brisket with BBQ beans and mac and cheese makes an amazing meal.  Both kinds of ribs are also amazing, and the dark horse on the menu is the smoked chicken.  It is amazing.  The best part of Smoque's menu is the ""add a taste"" section where you can add a small portion of many of their meats to your meal.  It is a great way to try many different things.  All of the sides are incredible.  The people at Smoque are always friendly and they do a great job at finding your group a place to sit.  Smoque is BYOB but you cannot drink on the outdoor patio.  This is another place I always try to take visitors from out of town."
"Best brisket in Chicago. Best BBQ sauce too! Baked beans are solid. About the only thing here I'm not in love with is the pulled pork. If you haven't been here before, go. What are you waiting for?"
"This place is top notch BBQ. Authentic and delicious! If you crave BBQ in Chicago, be sure this spot is at the top of your list."
"Amazing barbecue!  Dry rub on all with a choice of delicious sauces to enhance the smoky almost carmelized flavor (instead of cover the lack of flavor that some BBQ places do).  Catered for our wedding.  Prompt delivery, excellent service before the event and upon delivery, everything was perfect according to our order, hot and delicious, and even delivered 45 minutes away for us.  Thanks!"
The best BBQ in Chicago. I used to live off the blue line and would ride my bike 20 minutes just to pick up their ribs and pulled pork. By far the best BBQ I've had in Chicago. I'd venture to say the only good BBQ I've had in Chicago.
"Long lines even at 8 on a weeknight.  I think people definitely camp out since it is BYOB.  Amazing, fatty, tender, brisket.  Pork is good as well.  Mac and cheese is nice and hot, Peach cobbler is a must as well.  Check this place out...I'm thinkin it may be worth the hype..."
"Came here on a Friday night and thankfully we beat the dinner time rush.  Line was fast and efficient. This is definitely a take out joint and not a place to enjoy a nice dinner, but if you must dine in, you will find a decent place to sit and the bus boys are friendly and attentive.  Now on to the food..The star of the show was definitely the brisket, it had to be the best I've ever tasted. The cole slaw was great and I usually do not care for cole slaw, they make it with vinegar and no mayo which is a plus  I was not crazy about the St Louis ribs and the baby backs were slightly better as the meat was too tough for me.  The mac and cheese was okay and the baked beans were too runny, but they did pack a good flavor."
Few weeks ago Smoque BBQ was featured on Check Please! and got great revews so I decided to give it a shot and see what is everyone raving about.I was actually very lucky as I did not have to wait in line that long maybe 10 min. However as I was exiting I saw that the line was a 1/2 block long outside. Crazy.I ordered a little bit of everything-mac and cheese - ok-french fries -ok-green beans - not so muchand the famous brisket - ok BUTI could not finish all of this food so I took some left overs home and here is where the secret is..............THE BRISKET IS DELICIOUS COLD!!!! Seriously it is better cold than hot. I love it. If I am ever in the neighborhood  again I am getting the brisket to go and sticking it in my fridge for a day.
"This place is great. It was not what I expected when I arrived. I had no idea you ordered at the counter and picked up your own food. I came before the dinner rush so it was empty, although I heard it gets real packed in there. Definitely would not want to be there for that. I ordered sliced brisket and my friend ordered pulled pork and the texas sausage. It was so delicious. You can tell it had been cooking for at least a half day, the meat just melted in my mouth. I can't believe how delicious it was. The sides were okay, I got mac n cheese, brisket chili, baked beans, and fries. I concentrated more on the meats. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because the vibe in there was not as chill as I would like it to be. The bussers were just standing around awkwardly and staring at us and it was hard to max the way you should with BBQ when you have 3 or 4 guys looking at you. But don't worry Smoque, I will be back!"
"BBQ here is delicioius! All of the meat, especially the brisket, is tender and succulent. Though the sauce is sweet with some tang, eating the wonderful meat alone is enough for maximum pleasure. I would recommend getting the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich deal with a side of ribs... if you want to take a trip to meat heaven. Sides are also tasty but are a bit smaller. That's not a problem because you don't take a trip to a BBQ place for the sides. The place itself is also kind of small, the staff is nice, and there's an outdoor seating area when it's nice outside. There is no wait staff at this place. In my mind I thought it was a sit down and order kind of place but that didn't take away from my experience. The food is so good that I will gladly come back here again."
"I'd like to rip out my heart and hand it to Smoque for their amazing brisket. To be honest, I don't even really like brisket. The first time I went there, I didn't even want to go, but I didn't want to seem like a ""buzz kill"". So I sucked it up, and figured ""whatever, it's one meal."" So, I ordered the sliced brisket platter, and OH. MY. GOSH. It has the best smokey flavor and just like everyone says - melts in your mouth. I couldn't finish mine and brought it home and actually tasted just as good three days later in the microwave. I couldn't believe it. Meat just never tastes good reheated, but it tasted amazing. Go try it! Try it now!"
Order early and often.
Being from the south I am  very picky about BBQ. After seeeing this place on Food network and seeing the great reviews I just had to try it. Let me tell you the food is some of the best BBQ I've ever had!!! Trust me you will not be disappointed. My only complaint is the place is a little small.  Not able to really enjoy this awesome food when you are sitting 15 inches from a complete stranger.
"The King.  Top to bottom, best BBQ in city.When it comes to BBQ in Chicago, you have tiers.Tier I, the Kings (plan your night around it): Smoque and Fat Willy's.Tier II, the Good Guys (never disappointed): Smoke Daddy, Lillie's, sometimes Honky TonkTier III, the No Mas Guys (not worth the time): usually Honky Tonk, ChicagoQ, most places not listed in Tier I or II."
Still the best BBQ in the city. Went back last week and was not disappointed. Try this place!!
"There is nothing better than Smoque in the city of Chicago. Great sides and great prices. If you are looking to not wait in line, order ahead, but keep in mind, you need to order a few hours ahead so that they can tell you what time your order would be ready. Best brisket outside of Texas."
"Best BBQ I've ever had in Chicago. And the brisket chili is delicious. The ribs were perfectly smoked. The meat was not falling off the bone. Brisket was done very well, very tender with just the right amount of chaw."
Best BBQ in the city.  Takeout is a little awkward.  Expect long lines.
"Some friends brought me here and it was a pleasant meal.  It's BYOB when you eat inside, bonus!  This is good, average priced for BBQ.  I enjoyed everything I tried from the menu here, but I wanted to find a bbq sauce that was an A+ but didn't, although theirs is good.  The beef brisket was good.  Not sure if they have any healthy side items, but this is on par with other bbq joints."
"This place is byob and yes, we came at lunch with some pbrs... on a weekday... no judgement! Hey it was a staycation day drinking sort of lunch. The pulled pork sandwich was awesome, i love having some good bbq and the laid back, order at the counter and sit at your table is just what I wanted for a chill lunch.  This place gets packed quick so we couldnt hang out all day with our pbrs but it was still some good bbq for a day off."
"Really good food.  We brought some friends from Germany recently, and they loved the barbecue, as did we.  The meat was fantastic, especially the brisket and pulled pork.  This being my first time, I didn't know it was BYOB, so be advised if you're expecting a bar.  They're organized such that you order at the counter and then get your table - this is probably the best way to get everyone through most efficiently.  DELICIOUS."
"Came in 2:30 pm on a Tuesday, no wait! You can tell the brisket was made with love!  Tender, juicy, perfect!"
"Now, looking at some recent reviews, I recall something else.  That because some were written by some tourists who actually photograph their food, themselves, and who eat way too much.  Aside from gluttony, these reviews feature food photos which remind me of all the plastic, polystyrene and disposable junk in which nearly all of Smoque's dishes are served.  This is a small-site EPA disaster area, all by itself, but the fat women could care less."
"The hunt for good BBQ in Chicago starts with a line out the door. The wait was roughly ~30 min to 1hr to order. Upon ordering, we were escorted to a table that was held for us by the hostess (or something similar to). Their food arrived on a metal tray.This place is probably as good as BBQ gets in Chicago (and I'm a bit disappointed given Chicago has such wonderful food/restaurants/eateries). It's definitely not a top-tier BBQ place. The ribs, brisket, and pulled pork were OK, but could be quite dry and overcooked. The cole slaw was rather enjoyable with a vinegar-based dressing (I'm accustomed to mayonnaise being from the south). The brisket chili was nothing special, with the brisket not adding much to the party. The menu is also more pricey than I'm accustomed to paying for BBQ, but this isn't a large point given it's in/near Chicago. I also found it odd how the owner (or who I presumed to be the owner) is sort of on watch over his customers. His interactions seemed a bit odd/strange, acting almost like a statue in the corner. If an owner is out on the dining floor, I'm usually accustomed to seeing him ask how things are going/how the food is. Instead he was just sort of...there... Also not a fan of the seating method, but I guess they need to sort people when there's a line snaking out the door. With the price I paid, I would've preferred eating elsewhere as Chicago has a huge HUGE selection of places to eat. Smoque will satisfy the BBQ itch, but you'll need to go elsewhere for really REALLY good BBQ. Rewards on their wall also seem to reflect this, as I don't recall seeing anything that was non-Chicago awarded.This is probably not the most valid point, but if you've got a car and a day, go to Pappy's in St. Louis. Their ribs are probably the best I've ever had. However, the brisket in Texas is still the best."
"Smoque is great; I'd go there at least once a week when my place of employment was within walking distance.  Start with the pulled pork sandwich and french fries and work your way up to more complex meats.  Peach cobbler side is wonderful as well.  The coleslaw is not my favorite, but that's mostly because I'm not a raw onion fan."
"I really wanted to like this place, but was unfortunately underwhelmed.  The service was quick and fast which I definitely liked, the owner was friendly and gave up his table when all others were taken.  I got the brisket and it was good but not phenom.  I guess my main complaint was the sauce.  I hump sauce in general so when they give it to you in a little container and the consistency is watery, it just doesn't scream BBQ."
Probably the best bbq for the best value in Chicago.Brisket chopped or sliced is great.Pulled Pork is good.Macaroni is unreal.Fries are fantastic.Ribs are legit.Chicken I haven't had.Avoid going on the weekends to spare yourself from the lines and If there's one thing that could make it better it would be a bit of and increase in the portions of the sides!Enjoy.
"Great menu, delicious food. They were super busy but run like a well oiled machine service wise. This is fantastic barbecue!!!"
"The absolute best BBQ... The brisket sandwich melts in your mouth, the sauce is so tangy and tasty, great atmosphere and a friendly group of people.  You have to try this place..."
"Best BBQ I've had in Chicago. Had the sliced beef brisket and a link of the Texas sausage. As great as the brisket was, the sausage was perhaps even better. I also tried a taste of the St. Louis ribs from a friend's plate, and it was phenomenal, with a great rub and sauce, and the meat slid right off the bone. The BBQ beans were an excellent side choice, as was the mac & cheese. The cole slaw was not to my liking, as I prefer a creamier base; theirs is in a vinegar base. Lines were long, but were worth the wait. Would highly recommend this place, just expect a long wait during peak times."
"I will be back for the tender and smoky chopped brisket and sweet-sour crunch-gooey peach cobbler. After eating loads of BBQ in Memphis, Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Florida these past few months, I'd have to say that the best brisket has been right here at home!  At Smoque BBQ!  Smoque didn't win the title for best smoked pulled pork. Though they beat out Charles Vergos's and Central BBQ's somewhat dull pork in Memphis, and some forgettable watery stuff I had in Austin.The title for best pulled pork belongs to my Uncle Gordie in Boynton Beach, FL, who injects his pork butt with pineapple juice, before slow smoking it for 6 hours, and finishing it in the oven for another 3.  Smokelicious and bark-tastic and served with a South Carolina mustard-based sauce that would make shoe leather taste good.Sorry Gordie doesn't own a restaurant.  But he did admit that his recipe is a modification of one he pulled from his favorite cooking show Americas Test Kitchen. cookscountry.com/recipes….  Gonna try that one out myself this long hot summer. You should too, because you can't be as bad at cooking as everyone says you are."
Amazing!! I'm a bit of a BBQ snob but this was the best I've had in Chicago for sure. I had the ribs dry. They were very tender but still had a good texture with a little pull to it. Perfectly balance of rub and smoke. Will definitely be back for more.
"Awesome place to eat! I had the pulled pork, fries and baked beans. Pulled pork was definitely the best I've had, fries was plentiful and fresh! Baked beans was a little to sweet for me but still good! Parking is hard around the restaurant, but if you park near the bridge, its free and plenty of parking!"
"You have to try it at least once.I love the smokey and tender flavor of the brisket.  The staff was super helpful and kept everything running like a well oiled machine.  My sides where the mac n' cheese, sweet potato fries and cornbread.  The sides aren't anything to write home about but good enough.  Don't forget to thank the staff before you leave they work hard at making food I'm sure you'll love."
I have heard of and driven by Smoque on many occassions. Today I finally gave it a try and am I glad I did. Smoque has the best smoked brisket I've had outside of Texas. It's very good!! Highly recommended.
"vert tasty BBQ be sure to try all the side dishes they really are the bestbrisket and pulled pork are my favsalways crowded, call in order and pickup is fast but they tell you when you can pickup so call early, the wait is worth it"
"This is great BBQ. I cant say enough. Its more than worth the drive into the city. We had the St Louis ribs, brisket, pulled pork and 1/2 chicken. AMAZING! the brisket  just melted in my mouth. This is the best bbq joint in Chicago. LOVE IT! coming back for my Fathers Day dinner."
I love this place!  It's an adventure to just stand in the long line to get in.  Everyone is in a good mood and you meet people from all of the suburbs who have made their trek into the city just to eat here.  The food is worth the wait.  Every bite is amazing.  We always order extra to take home for the next couple of days!
"Best BBQ in the city! We waited for about 20 mins to place our order, then it was just a few minutes till our table was ready, and another 15 mins for our food to be ready. It was well worth the wait. We got the 1/2 brisket 1/2 pulled pork sandwich and a half slab of ribs. It was so yummy the meat was nice and tender and I love that they give you the sauce on the side so you can add the BBQ sauce as you like. For sides, we got the Mac and cheese and peach cobbler and instead of cole slaw we got the corn bread. Besides the BBQ the next best part of the meal is the peach cobbler. Warning it might be hard to find parking around there."
The best brisket I've found in Chicago.  Pulled pork is also really solid.
Long line as to be expected. A little confusion from everyone on where to go if you are picking up vs if you are ordering to go vs if you are eating in. Resulted in a lot of people cutting the line and a lot of people getting angry.Everyone in our group who ate the brisket ended up with food poisoning after so we won't be returning.
"I've tried barbecue all over the US so I didn't come to Smoque with high expectations. In my opinion, Chicago isn't really known for their barbecue and Smoque is no exception. The brisket was juicy but didn't have any smoke flavor. My boyfriend pointed out that it tasted like it was braised rather than smoked, and I have to agree. As for the ribs, no one in our group could taste any difference between the baby back ribs and the St. Louis style ribs. And of all the sides (macaroni & cheese, fresh cut fries, cornbread and brisket chili) nothing really stood out as amazing. I appreciate the quick service and BYOB but I doubt I would come back for the food."
"Love this place, always great service and amazing bbq sauce, i want to buy a franchise.."
"We've been loyal Smoque customers for 5 years.  We've had it catered for multiple parties and its truly a crowd pleaser.  Everyone raves that its just the best brisket they've ever had.  The sauce is so flavorful and the meat is beyond top notch and cooked to bbq perfection.  I love the mac and cheese and coleslaw as well!  Don't forget the homemade peach cobbler too, one of my favs.  Truly the best BBQ place in Chicago!"
Great yummy BBQ here. Stop in and try it out ! I would go back but I stopped eating pork. I remember the corn bread being abosultely delicious!
Worked with Smoque for 2 weddings and the food is amazing! I'm not a meat eater but I will have their brisket any time! A must try :)
Love it here. I'm sad that its so busy all the time. Good for them bad for me.
"Tried this place on a whim one night when we were craving BBQ and we were very impressed.  The ribs themselves were meaty and the rub was great.  The sauce was decent, though I have had better-- the meat itself is definitely the highlight, rather than the sauce.Also very impressive were most of the sides.  Though I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw in general, the others in my party found this coleslaw to be excellent-- great flavor, with some apple added.  The mac n'cheese and the cornbread were both ridiculously good.  When you first get the little cup of mac n'cheese it seems small but the richness is such that the serving is perfect.  The cornbread is also baked in little individual cups and is very rich and delicious.  The fries were nicely seasoned and cooked perfectly.On a service note, when most of our order was ready, they didn't have any fries ready to go.  Though we didn't mind waiting a couple of minutes for them, they gave us a free side of chili to apologize for the wait.We will absolutely be back to satisfy our BBQ cravings!"
"Loved Smoque! Went over lunch on a weekday. Particularly enjoyed the no-frills ambiance; sat outside. Liked that you could order half sandwiches, which was just the right portion for me and allowed those with a larger appetite to enjoy a wider variety of the (awesome!) bbq. The cornbread was tasty (a sweet cornbread, which I like), as was the mac & cheese.  I can't wait to return to try other menu items. I need to learn more about how to judge bbq though to truly appreciate how great Smoque is."
"Amazing customer service on top of the amazing BBQ! I ordered a half rack of ribs, and went to pick it up, after my number was called. The employee behind the counter said ""that half rack is small, hold on a minute."" I thought it looked great, but she insisted and proceeded to give me another half rack for free to make up for it. Cornbread and brisket chili were great too!"
Awesome barbeque but I have to be in the mood for the drive and/or have a serious barbeque craving to go.  Parking is a bit of a beast as well but you can't go wrong here.  This is hands down some of THE best barbeque in Chicago.  It's southern barbeque done right!!!!  I had St. Louis slab of ribs with a side of macaroni and a corn muffin.  My husband and I were definitely impressed.  The place is always crowded so order ahead and Enjoy!
THE best brisket I've ever had in Chicago.  The BEST.Reasonable prices - good portions -- EXCELLENT quality.Excellent staff.My one critique:   I like my BBQ with onions and pickles  (it's a Texas thing - where they often also give you a slice of white bread or a roll).
"As a life long Chicagoan, I always thought barbeque ribs should be smothered in sweet sauce. Smoque has shown me the light. Their rubbed and smoked ribs are sensational. Who needs barbeque sauce?I got the St.Louis and baby back combo and I forgot to ask which was which. But they were both the best ever. The sauces on the side were good with the fries. Fantastic place!"
"Every once and awhile, something or someplace utterly shatters your perception of great food. For me, culinary nirvana has struck twice before: once at Father's Office in Santa Monica, California and again, two years later, at Moto in Chicago, Illinois. Smoque's sublime barbeque officially raises that number to three.  Having won a trip here through a fundraising auction, I was fortunate (read: blessed by the BBQ gods) to sample Smoque's entire menu in one glorious, pant-stretching visit. Everything from the baby back ribs to the smoked chicken raises the bar on what great barbecue should taste like. Indeed, the food here was so outstanding that my face hurt from smiling so much while I was eating.  However, the absolute star of the show was the smoked brisket - a juicy, fork-tender affair that tasted so delicious, it felt sinful to eat. Coming from a self-avowed ""pulled pork"" guy, this conclusion came bitterly at first but Smoque BBQ earned it. The brisket was bafflingly tender and exploded with flavor the moment I sunk my teeth into it. Even without sauce, Smoque's brisket outshines every barbecue restaurant I have previously been; however, add a touch of their Carolina inspired sauce, and we officially reach culinary nirvana."
"If you've made to this review then you should already be in line waiting to order at the Smoque. Simply put, divine!"
"I'm not a huge fan of their ribs, but their pulled pork, brisket, baked beans, and mac & cheese are all frigging delicious! Great sauces! This place it always packed. Inside the seating is very cafeteria like and communal. I usually get my food to go. It's pretty hard to get a spot outside."
BEST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!Holy smoques. This was the first time in my life where I didn't sauce the ribs at all. There was no need to. This was 110% legit smoked bbq. I'm not from Chicago but I can die a happy man now knowing that I've had the best bbq in America. Do yourself a favor and go here.
"Stopped here for lunch today as one of my coworkers was raving about it. A bit of a drive from the office, but completely worth it! The place is smaller, so there was a bit of a wait and a crowd, but they do a good job of clearing tables and getting people in and out. The food was fantastic. One of the best BBQ joints in the Chicago area...especially for the price. I think i paid about $11 and was full beyong comfort!Highly reccomend stopping by to cure your BBQ fix."
"One word: smoque'd!My cousin and I didn't know what to eat so of course I turned to Yelp! Being a Friday night we couldn't turn down the idea of BBQ so we headed on over to Smoque! Boy was it packed!The idea of having bussers get a table for us while we waited is a smart idea than people won't have to fight for seating! We ordered: 1/2 slab of St. Louis ribs, brisket sandwich, large order of mac and cheese, large order of beans, and large order of fries.-- 1/2 slab of St. Louis ribs is tender and definitely smoque'd, love the flavor it left in my mouth and the bbq sauce definitely makes the ribs, however, I wish our ribs were warmer, it got cold quick.-- the brisket sandwich meat was soft and tender and the sauce was a nice touch-- baked mac and cheese? extremely declicious! it's more for the creamy lover who just absolutely adores that heavy cheesey taste.-- the beans are flavorful with a hint of sweetness-- the bag that fries came in was quite oily, but oddly the fries theymselves were not. they came fresh and steaming hotIt was a delicious smoque'd bbq meal! Can't wait to try their pulled pork, baby back ribs, and peach cobbler next time!"
"Smoke is so unbelievably delicious, I have dreams about it.Just go, and eat as much as you can."
"We had lunch on a Tuesday, so there was no line and service was quick! Ordered chopped brisket and pulled pork, and I must say - best BBQ joint in Chicago!! Absolutely gorgeous meat that falls apart at the fork I almost cried T T. pork was exceptionally great, but I just prefer brisket for my taste. Mac and cheese was creamy,  cornbread was nice, and peach cobbler is a must buy for a side. The only side that was average was the chili, but even then it was ok. Will definitely go again!!"
"Smoque is as good as it gets.  We just moved to Portage Park from Wicker Park and this will certainly become one of our usual dining spots.  Anything that I've ever had here (been there 2x) has been delectable!  Love the peach cobbler.  I highly recommend it.  Its certainly unique, you order at the front then pick a table and they bring you the food.  One time that we went we decided to forgo dining in because the line was so long, that we phone ordered from the car and picked it up and ate in the car.  Yes, that is how delicious it is.  Highly recommend!"
"I've been a big fan of Smoque ever since it opened, and despite all of the barbecue restaurants that have followed behind, Smoque still is the tastiest with the best service. All of the main dishes are favorites, and the sides -- especially the mac 'n cheese -- are winners. Get there early, because although it's been around for a few years and all of the other imitators mentioned, lines can still be long."
The chicken was terrible! The sausage was not even close to what BBQ should be. I would have rather had a BBQ chicken Hot Pocket!  The sides were decent but that's not what makes a restaurant good. I'm not a food snob or a BBQ snob but this was some of the worst BBQ I've ever had. The smokey flavor tasted like it was sprayed on like people spray on tans. I'm sure they're nice people but the food was super disappointing.
"Great food, which is dictated by the slow line, but it moves fast! took my Uncle from Kansas City here, a man who knows his fair-share of bbq, and he was impressed! was also featured of diners, drive-ins, and dives so you can't go wrong!"
Very tasty...
"The brisket here is excellent, the best I've had outside of Texas.  The ribs are pretty good as well, but you should really get the brisket.  Trust me, I'm a doctor.  (Full disclosure: I am not a doctor)In any event, do me a favor and decide before you show up - too many people dilly dally while in line and have no idea what they want when they arrive at the register.  That, more than anything else, contributes to the long lines here.  Come on, people, its barbeque!  These are not hard decisions.PS, Hooray for BYOB."
"These folks are the expert smokers, I mean BBQ'ers. We ordered the baby back ribs and the meat was so tender. It had a good meat to fat ratio. Plus, the meat had a wonderful crust that was not charred up with burnt meat.  It was smoked really well and you can taste it in the food. We were so impressed!!!If you order the food as a combo, it comes with two sides.  The order comes with a side of coleslaw already so make sure you pick two different sides.  We had the baked beans, french fries, mac and cheese, peach cobbler and the corn bread.  My favorite was the coleslaw.  It was made with a vinaigrette dressing and was super delicious!  My other two favorite sides were the french fries and the peach cobbler.  The mac and cheese was good too but too creamy for me.  I was surprised that this BBQ place did not have mashed potatoes. Maybe a suggestion for the future? I love me some mashed potatoes!There are rules outside of the restaurant, such as you cannot pick where you want to sit.  I guess seating is tight at the restaurant so they need to pack everyone in. We had a table sitting right next to us, even though there were other open seats available.  It did start getting busy later in the evening so I can see why they want everyone seated in an orderly fashion.Service here was really top notch.  Everyone was really nice and friendly.  Its a pay first, eat later type of restaurant so I wasn't even expecting to be served. What a pleasant surprise!Street parking is available in the area.  However, there are signs across the street from the restaurant that say you aren't allowed to park. I think its because the residents that live across the street from the restaurant don't want anyone taking up their parking spots. Be careful where you park!The restaurant was a little out of our way to get to, but definitely worth the trip. It was really good smoked meat!!!"
"I went to Smoque BBQ a few weeks back and I have to say I am totally coming back here and literally have told all of my friends to go ASAP. Really friendly staff and the food was amazing! I had heard about this place a few times and finally got a chance to go and it was everything I expected. I got the pulled pork with sides of mac and cheese, beans and peach cobbler, all which were great. I came when it was not too busy but when I was leaving it started to get busy so try to come on an off peak time. I also loved the layout of the food on the tray, I know that is silly but it is totally true. I think they sell the BBQ sauce too, and I regret not buying any, or else I would bathe everything I make at home in that sauce."
Tried there sliced brisket sandwich taste great and the portion is huge. Highly recommend.
Got there right as it opened and there was already a line starting to go out the door.  Really small dining room but WELL worth the wait and the lack of elbow room.  I've had Smoque BBQ catered for someone's birthday and it was also just as good as eating in.  One of the best BBQ experiences I've ever had.
"EXTERIOR: 1/5 (not a good neighborhood. if you drive a nice car, you won't feel comfortable parking it in this neighborhood; also, finding parking can be tough)INTERIOR: 4/5 (for this price range and aura, it has a nice interior. very clean. friendly staff)CUSTOMER SERVICE: 4/5CLEANLINESS: 4-5/5QUALITY OF FOOD: 3-3.5/5TASTE OF FOOD: 3/5----------(**note: I rate each eatery relative amongst its type/range in THAT city.  So, no, I'm not rating this restaurant compared to Alinea or some Michelin-star restaurant.  I rate it and analyze it's component qualities (above) from 1-5 compared to other eateries with similar food type, aura, and price range)Smoque was really a solid 3. Had I not heard about the hype, I would say ""it's ok, if I was in the neighborhood, maybe I would drop by if I was craving BBQ""--which is likely never, since it's not in a good neighborhood.  Having known about the hype, I would say it's severely overrated.  A few Chicagoans have called this the best BBQ place in town.  I'm a bit confused.  I've had far better fast-food BBQ in Washington D.C. and other places.  Maybe Chicago just doesn't know BBQ?  I don't know, I'm not native to this town.  I actually prefer Carson's over Smoque, though I'm enthralled by neither (Carson's has better appetizers, like their cornbread is legions better).The best thing about Smoque is probably their buns.  They're steamed, which makes them incredibly soft.  I had their brisket and pork BBQ.  Their brisket was disappointing.  It was a bit hard.  The pork BBQ was very soft and much better.  Because the brisket was so dry and a bit tough, it wasn't too flavorful.  The pork BBQ was significantly better.  I wasn't in love with the sauce.  Neither had a really ""smokey"" flavor, which I love in BBQ."
"It's good. I think it's very good actually but also overrated. It's not as good as Chuck's on the Southside (Burbank) or Smalls which is AWESOME!! Nonetheless, I still eat there because it's good."
Totally worth the trek up north. It's BYOB and the line really wasn't that long. I absolutely love pulled pork and this is the best I've had in the city by far. Their brisket and mac and cheese is really good too. I almost don't recommend going here because you will find yourself hiking it up that way every time you have a BBQ craving after you try it! Haven't been to a place downtown that comes close to comparing.
"Still great, but I have to say not in as many fields as I suggested before.  The texas sausage is weak.  Their sandwiches could use some slaw.  Their sides are actually kind of weak too with only the beans being extraordinary.  However, their salad with mustard vinaigrette is dynamite and make a perfect pairing with some of their delightful ribs.  Dessert is also really solid here.  Still the best in Chicago."
"Pulled pork was awesome especially with the great BBQ sauce that comes on the side. The Mac and cheese is the best I've tastes so far, kinda small portion though. The fries were ok, think McDonald fries are better but the best pulled pork sandwich ever. I give this place 5 starts because of the delicious food and staff service."
"Yeah it's good.  Particularly if you go mid afternoon when you aren't elbow to elbow with other patrons and they still have everything on the menu. I love the chopped brisket, the pulled pork and the bbq chicken.  Their mac and cheese is amazing, as are their fries.  If you're coming to get bbq and you're complaining about the size of the orders, you may as well get a McRib."
"This is excellent BBQ. They're consistent which is why there's still a line out the door after all these years.  Great service, not too long of a wait, everything on the menu is awesome except I didn't really like that style of sausage, it was a bit dry but other than that, solid BBQ!"
"Let me frame this up.. We went here one weekday night while craving BBQ. There was a line, as expected but it moved rather quickly. This isn't a place where you hang out. I got the half and half and my husband got the brisket. Both were delicious but I'd have to say the pulled pork was top notch. They also allow BYOB and have plenty of different appetizers. I didn't find the man n cheese that special... It was mediocre at best but what made the place top notch was that the owner was out working the tables. That's the way to keep business!"
"From a gal who knows barbecue, Smoque was incredible. Party of four and we wanted to try as much as possible so we ordered a bunch of different items. Pulled pork, brisket, ribs, sausage, beans, mac and cheese and coleslaw. EVERYTHING was excellent but standouts IMHO were brisket, ribs, sausage and beans. Oh, wait. That's almost everything we ordered!  I wanted to bathe myself in those delicious, smoky beans!! The bun for my pulled pork sandwich was just a tad sweet which complimented the meat without overwhelming. Also loved the different type sauces. Smoque is so worth that cab fare from downtown!"
I am glad that they accept take-out! I love their BBQ brisket sandwiches and macaroni and cheese. I think their spicy sauce is also very great!!!
"First, let me tell you: the food and staff are 5 stars. BUT: be forewarned that just tonight I spent an obscene amount of time waiting to order online, only to be dropped right when I was the next caller....THREE TIMES!! (I was caller 13, 5, then 10. ugh! ) I'm incredibly frustrated. I don't know what's wrong with the phone system, but SMOQUE, I hope you see this and fix it. Otherwise, everything else is truly fabulous."
"I've been to Smo que dozens of times. I was tipped off about this place by my former boss when I noticed from his expense account that he ate here every week. Kind of a trek from the office but I was game. I haven't looked back and make sure I arrive before 11:30am at Smo que to first get a good parking spot on Pulaski and second to beat the crowd before the line forms out the door.The Beef brisket is heavenly, the best that I have ever had as far as BBQ. What I like about Smo que is that they have the barbeque sauce already on the meat. I hate squeezing barbeque sauce out of a bottle. The beans are the best I have ever had, the fries are freaking amazing as well. You can get out of there for about $13 for lunch and don't need to eat for the rest of the day. Sometimes I even order take out to eat later in the week since I didn't live close to Smo que. If you need a good laugh, read Smo que's Manifesto on their website.I crave Smo que more than ever since I ditched the Chicago scene to live in Arizona. I can't wait to get my ""Smo que on"" this coming summer."
"I love barbecue, and Smoque is the best I've ever tasted. I am partial to the chopped brisket platter. Even my vegetarian daughter loves their salads. The restaurant is not fancy, but you're going for the food anyway, right? The staff is really kind and helpful too. Plan to arrive early or wait, and don't forget to BYOB."
The reviews speak for themselves.  I've been going to this place for the past 2years and can't get enough of it.  My favorite is the chopped brisket sandwich and the Peach Cobbler is a MUST!
"I've been to Smoque on 2 occasions and experienced similar quality both times.  I completely understand they cant go in the back and prepare fresh, authentic BBQ specifically for every order.  The issue I had is the BBQ was dry and lacked quality you would expect for the price they charge.  The St. Louis style ribs were without any moisture but had a decent flavor.  The brisket was a complete bust.  I almost cried as I ate it because of disappointment.  It was super dry, lacked flavor, and the sauce they provided was not good.  I held out hope for the sides to be delicious but they too disappointed.  Mac'n cheese was plain and boring and the baked beans were too soupy.  I will not be going back to Smoque and that is unfortunate because I love BBQ."
"It was good BBQ if you live close-by.  But for a 20-30 minute drive plus a 45 minute wait I didn't feel like it was worth it.  Its really crowded so you feel like you are in your neighbors conversation - I accidentally bumped into neighbors on both sides when I got up to leave.  I prefer Blackwood BBQ in the loop.  Food is much tastier, more conveniently located.  Obviously it doesn't have the same dine-in experience but the food is better to me.  But each to his own!"
"Very well one of my top 1 or 2 BBQ places in the entire city! Pulled pork, brisket, Mac and cheese, all of it is awesome. Definitely gets crowded and a long wait to sit but worth it if you have time.  Calling in before hand and carrying out is my preferred way to go since I live nearby. Would eat it three times a week if I could."
"Belief the hype.  The best barbecue I've ever had in Chicago.  The owner borrows from all of the great American barbecue traditions, which creates a best-of-the-best of each kind of meat.  Like, central Texas brisket, Memphis-style pork ribs, and North Carolina pulled pork.  All of the sides are spot on, too.I am actually really happy that these guys have had so much success.  It's a testament to the fact that putting love and care into your cooking without taking any short cuts is still appreciated in Chicago."
Best brisket I have ever had! Hands down. Their mac & cheese side is excellent. I always get it. They are the perfect portion. Some other BBQ places I've been to have too large a portion & I wind up being over full. That is not the case at Smoque. Their portions are perfect & I always leave feeling like I have gotten my fair share of food.Go here & you will not be disappointed.
"This is my favorite BBQ place in the city. I've been here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed. I rotate between ordering the pulled pork, brisket, and chicken (although this is my favorite BBQ Chicken of anywhere in Chicago). All of them are excellent choices. Yum yum! Tip: Always call ahead if you are doing a to-go order."
"This is excellent BBQ! I have had the pulled pork sandwich (my favorite), have tried the brisket (if you get it as a sandwich sliced is juicier and chopped dryer but leaner FYI), and I've enjoyed the sides of cornbread, baked beans, like homemade mac and  cheese, and the fries!! All excellent. Every time I bring someone here, they are hooked!! Just yummy! You'll thank me later!"
"Quick service, good prices, and excellent food.  Brisket, pork, and ribs were outstanding!  But...the best part of all:  the beans and the bread pudding.  Those two dishes alone are reasons enough to come here."
"Had a full rack of ribs, Mac and cheese, pulled pork sandwich and the peach cobbler. The BBQ sauce is what makes this place. The ribs were do tender we cut them with plastic forks! We dinned in so all the aromas added to the overall experience. Besides what better way to celebrate the 4th than with ribs!!The Ribs were so tender i was easily able to cut them with a plastic knife! food was ready quick and the staff was really nice. The peach cobbler had almonds or pecans in the crust which gave a really delicious taste; original in its own way. I love an establisment that doesnt over charge customers for petty things like fountain drinks. Somque has free refills!Lastly, their original bbq sauce is off the chain...so good in fact they actually sell it by the bottle! i will mos def be visiting Smoque again real soon!"
"So my son took us to dinner here last week. To be honest I had low expectations - barbecue in Chicago? This is not glorified bbq- this is the real thing. Oh- and bring your own beer or wine to drink. When you walk in, you wait to order and they ask you if you are staying or taking the food to go. If you are staying, an employee watches the tables and they call your number when your table is ready. Not more than 2 or 3 minutes kater, they call your number as your food is up.Thing to know- baked mac and cheese as a side- best I have ever had.  The peach cobbler as dessert is good and my baby back ribs and sons brisket were spectacular. And you will smell like barbecue smoke when you walk out so plan accordingly."
"Best BBQ in Chicago, period."
best BBQ in Chicago.
Good food but doesn't meet the hype as Chicago's best BBQ. I've had most food items on the menu. Brisket is not impressive. Everything else is good.
"Why didn't I go here sooner?I was in the mood for some BBQ for dinner, so I decided to come here on a Thursday night. I was somewhat surprised the line was forming out the door, but it moved rather quickly. I decided to go all out and eat like a pig. I got the sliced brisket platter with mac n' cheese and coleslaw as my two sides. Also I ordered the cornbread and peach cobbler. The brisket was delicious and the BBQ sauce that came with it was so good. Everything I ate was wonderful. I was even tempted to get more peach cobbler.Afterwards, I went into a meat coma and fell asleep at home. Good thing I ran this morning also. Definitely coming back here when the BBQ mood strikes again."
"Ehhhh? The atmosphere is fun, but I think I have figured out the reason for Smoque's popularity, because I'm thinkin' it ain't over the food, or the location (sh!t's far away, yo).It's the name. My silly (boy) friends just love love loooooove to say, ""Hey dude, wanna Smoque tonight???"" Yes you're super awesome. Such creative play on on the name. I'm so lucky to call all you idiots my friends. Maybe I just don't get the real reason behind BBQ. To me, the purpose lies in two areas:1. Sauce2. Tender, meaty goodness Smoque kinda failed in one arena and skated by with a 6.0 out of 10 in the other. The sauce was lackluster and minimal. I need my meat saucy. It just isn't the same for me. The meat was somewhat tender, though sometimes difficult to chew and occasionally quite tough. I don't like to work to swallow my meat. (That's what she said.)I'm not saying that Smoque does not provide classic, for reals BBQ. All I'm saying is they do not serve the kind of BBQ that I enjoy. Every now and then I can be talked into Smoque(ing), and then I order the sides, which are much better than the meat."
Went here a few months back.All I gotta say is... pretty good food here.  Will be back in the future.
Man this place is good! Probably the best real BBQ (Smokehouse) in Chicago.
"Once you have BBQ in the south, everything else is blah.Sorry smoque. Blah.If you want to have real BBQ, skip Smoque, take a flight to Atlanta and head over to Fat Matt's. Now, thats Bar Be QUE!!!!"
Best BBq chicken ever. I don't eat chicken skin as a rule but the skin on the chicken at Smoque is crispy and so full of flavor that I ate all of it. The lack of the fifth star is merely because I asked if the baked beans had pork in them. I was told that there wouldn't be chunks of pork in them. There were chunks of beef though. Should have asked if they had meat in them. Ill take the blame for that but I will absolutely come back here next time I'm in town. Only next time I will order a salad to go with the half chicken. I saw their salads at the table next to me. WoW!!!!!! The prices were really great too. Three of us each had a full dinner and a drink and left full for less than 50 bucks. Can't ask for more than that. Amazing food at a great value.
"I had heard so much good about this place and it is generally reviewed as one of the best BBQ joints in the area. So I finally tried it and I was not disappointed. I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich. Both the pulled pork and the brisket were good. I have had better brisket before but the pulled pork was amazing. the mac n cheese side was some of the best mac n cheese I have had from a BBQ sot, and the cornbread was great. I am going to try a few more BBQ spots around here but Smoque is definitely the leader of the pack for my go to spot for BBQ."
Had a combo plate on a cold winter night. It was pretty good. The bbq sauce was delicious.
"Very tasty barbecue, highly recommended!  Lines are normally long, if you can, order carry out and then pick it up and take it home to eat. Then you can avoid the lines."
Great BBQ! Reasonable prices. Down home authentic BBQ that has a classier atmosphere. Great place to take a date! I think I had the sampler platter and it was out of this world!
Food was great but I wish they were better at clearing people out. My party had to wait for people who were just sitting at their table drinking soda and texting while the place is packed.
"We really liked the food here- the cafeteria at rush hour vibe, not so much."
Had Smoque at a graduation party.  It was delicious.  The brisket was maybe the best I have ever had.  The sauce is the best-- not sweet or syrupy like most.  Great favors and a bit of a bite.  Just perfect!
Never disappointing with the portions and flavors. The staff works very hard at keeping the place moving and clean so the line can be served and seated when the line is out the door. The smell from across the neighborhood always draws me back. yum
"Boy am I due a return visit here... certainly remember my visit from a while back and Sunday around 4 pm worked well last time. Many delicious items on the menu. The brisket is drop to your knees good. I recommend you go ahead and take a seat before tasting.The beans are just that good, you might want to consider a double order. Their food  travels well and worth the trip in from the burbs!"
I did enjoy smoque. Long lines for dinner so expect to get their earlier. Tables here and there to dine in. Cool menu board. Awesome smoked ribs! Wish their sides were larger but other than that yum!
Amazing BBQ! Mac and Cheese was to die for as well :)
Delicious pulled pork and an amazing environment. It's like walking into a random place along the side of the highway on a road trip. It's some of the best BBQ I have had in the city.
"I moved to the neighborhood three years ago and I've lost count of the number of times I've been here.  Sometimes the line is absurd, sometimes the meat can be a bit dry, and some of the side dishes are forgettable, but I love this place too much for anything less than five stars.  My favorite is the sliced brisket sandwich with sides of fries and coleslaw.  Their fries are secretly awesome, plus the coleslaw is pretty darn good.  My girlfriend swears by the babyback ribs and usually picks them clean.This place is worth going out of your way to try.  Maybe the BBQ is better in North Carolina or Texas or whatever, but this is some of the best BBQ you'll get in Chicago."
"Really solid BBQ place. Heard lots of great things about it and finally gave it a shot. We ordered a variety of meat items: baby back, st. louis, brisket, pulled pork. And then a sample of sides. The restaurant lives up to its name. Nice smokey flavor with good rub taste. And a little cheaper than places like Fat Willy's and not so pretentious as some other places like those in the west loop or Wicker Park. Good choice of a spicy sauce and a regular sauce. Regular sauce also has a subtle kick. Another critical plus - cornbread was moist.  Only knock - and maybe I missed it on the menu - no greeny foods (green beans, collard greens)? New favorite spot!"
"Not sure which I like better, the sauce or the smoked meats - Does not matter, eating them individual or combining them are my favorites. If there was room for a tent outside I would be there but the lines of people would not approve. As always, the ribs here are the best - despite the long wait and lines - worth every minute. Take out is my choice to get this great BBQ in my mouth the fastest."
"Go there NOW! Brisket, yum! Pulled Pork, wow! Texas Sausage, I will sell your children (don't have any of my own to donate to the cause)! Mac'n'cheese amazeballs. The only things I am not wild for are the chicken and cole slaw.  Absolutely everything else I have had is crazy good. Enjoy!"
"BYOB, wait in line order your food.  Plain good old BBQ!!!"
"Loved this place. Awesome, awesome, awesome bbq. My fiancee wasn't really too impressed, though. I had the half brisket sandwich, added a sausage, had the baked beans and the cole slaw. I loved how the slaw wasn't a mayo based but more vinegar. The baked beans were really tasty as well. We also had the mac and cheese which was ok and the corn bread, to which my fiancee stated was the best thing we had, it was really good.The bad, everything was vinegar based. Not much variety in terms of sauces, or maybe I didn't know that there were other options. Also, it is WAY out. I mean I probably would not make a special trip out there again, not just for this. Its also BYOB and thankfully Walgreens started selling because there is one close by."
Brisket- ORDER IT- you won't be sorry. The BEST in CHICAGO!Order ahead if you can.
"They are no short of 5 star reviews, yet I want to add mine. Been there twice, very impressed with the efficiency of the operation, everything runs so smoothly; staff are super nice. Noticed that when they got the table ready for us, they even cleaned the high chair for the baby. Then when we left our iPhone there by accident, the guy chased us down the block to return it. Great food great people!"
"Amazing! I've had almost the entire menu and have loved everything. It gets really crowded but the line moves fast so it's never much of a problem. The brisket is so delicious! The side of Mac and cheese is small but beyond satisfying. This is my favorite BBQ place I've had, with Fat Willys being a very close second. :)"
"So good. Even a vegetarian can make a meal of the sides, or have a big ol salad. Tips:Sources tell me go brisket over pulled pork. Get sauce for dipping your fries. Peach cobbler is fan-freakin-tastic."
"Before I get into the meat of this review (get it?) I'd like to dedicate it to my very tall friend Jim.  Without his guidance and insistance on making me fat I probably would never have tried Smoque.Smoque obviously is doing something right, 1307 reviews and 4.5 stars makes that pretty clear.  The food was good, the service was friendly, and the dining room is nice and clean (read: not sticky).  I had the 1/2 & 1/2 pulled pork and sliced brisket with cole slaw, fries, and beans.  Don't worry, I had no intention of eating all of that, but I wanted to try it all.  The pulled pork and brisket were both very good, either would make a fantastic sandwich.  The cole slaw and fries were also good.  Something just wasn't quite right about the beans though, they were too sweet I think.  Skip the beans, you won't miss 'em.It's a counter service place, which works efficiently here.  When I got there they were pretty much empty, by the time I was leaving there was a line to the door, so go on off peak times if you don't want to wait.  The food was worth it if you're nearby or it's on your way.  I don't know that I'd go too far out of my way to get some Smoque BBQ."
"I have to be a little bias with this review giving that I am from Texas. But having tried a few places before eating Smoque, it was really good. I would come back again."
"Great place great food great service. The baby back ribs, sliced beef brisket & baked beans were awesome!!! Definitely would go back!!"
"It's been on our Chicago bucket list for awhile, and we finally made the trek last night. We got there around 5:00 and had to wait a good 20 minutes to put in our order. By the time we left around 6:15, the line was literally down the block.Between the two of us, we ordered a pulled pork sandwich, a half rack of St. Louis ribs, and a tasting portion of the brisket. Our sides were baked beans (which we both agreed were the best thing we ate) and macaroni and cheese. I thought the pulled pork was absolutely fantastic. One note on the macaroni--you can get a small (one aluminum tin) or large (two aluminum tins, aka the large is twice the size as the small). The small is what comes with the entrees. So, if you're getting one of the sandwiches, it's actually more advantageous to order the sandwich a la carte and then a large macaroni on the side. It's much more macaroni bang for your buck (and yes, it's delicious).The seating situation is not a big deal at all. You wait until you've put in your order, a host finds you a table, and you eat in peace. There are enough tables and few enough cashiers that they have the whole operation timed perfectly."
Went here for lunch with a friend.I had the 1/2 and 1/2 pulled pork and bbq brisket.Yum and Yum.I paired it with coleslaw which was very good.I tried my friends baked beans - greatFantastic BBQ and I can't wait to go back.Outdoor seating.
My favorite BBQ in Chicago. I absolutely love their brisket with a side of mac & cheese.
I highly recommend this place to friends when we are in a mood for BBQ. The place is small and always packed. But the waiting line and lack of comfort and space is worth it.
Their smoked brisket and peach cobbler is worth the wait. You might wanna call in your order to save time for a quick pick-up.
"Yelp had told me my next review awaits... and I couldn't believe I hadn't already reviewed Smoque BBQ!!!  Best brisket ever!  Get the platter, sliced.  Meat falls off the bone and is melt in your mouth delicious.  The slaw on the side is also pretty fantastic, and I don't really eat typical mayo-based coleslaw (pretty sure this is more of a vinegar based cabbage anyways).  Pulled pork and Texas sausage is good too, but you can get better pulled pork elsewhere in my opinion.  The brisket alone grants a 5 star review.  And the mac and cheese!  But go, and go early if avoiding a line is important to you.  The line does move pretty fast, but definitely not a place to go if you need to be in and out in 10 minutes."
yummy! you'll burn up the calories standing in line waiting to get all that delicious food. lots to pick from and great side dishes and desserts. i luv me some bbq!
capital  yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
"Best brisket and ribs in the city.  The pulled pork is ok, but there's a reason this restaurant gets the stars it has. Massive crowds speak for themselves."
Can't go wrong with this awesome neighborhood joint. They do great catering too! The only disappointing thing was that you want more than what they give you for the mac n' cheese serving.
"The ambiance isn't the greatest, but I recommend dinner here before a show at the Abbey. Great coleslaw too!"
"Best BBQ I've had in Chicago.  I'm from Kansas City so my expectations for BBQ are ridiculous.  Smoque is very good.  The brisket is delicious, the rib meat falls off the bone, and all of the sides are great."
Just moved here from Texas and have had trouble finding good BBQ. The Brisket and the pulled pork sandwich are where it's at! Very tender and juicy! Ribs were too dry for my liking. We also tried the mac and cheese and the cole slaw. Wasn't crazy about either of them. I didn't see anyone with booze but I heard it's BYOB.
"While it's a nice place, I don't see the big draw like others do."
"Very nice rustic feel to a place with great flavors.  Personally my favorite part is the Bourbon and meat combinations, natural flavors that go hand in hand.  Service is great, food is good, restaurant is very loud!  Now, one thinks that I am the quiet, reserved type by stating that. Quite the contrary, but I don't like yelling across my table to talk about everyday subject matters.  I don't know if its the people, the layout, or lack of sound absorbing ceiling tiles, or what it is, but its loud enough to keep it from being a five star review."
"You know a place is going to be top quality when the line of people waiting to order includes BOTH cab drivers and police officers.  Smoque did not disappoint, at all.  I've spent a lot of time since coming to Chicago trying to find quality bbq (for a city of foodies, our bbq offerings are sorely lacking), and smoque is definitely my go-to place.  Highly recommended.  Eating in is sort of a pain, the dining room is tiny.  And takeout is rough because its in a totally weird location, so your food is cold when you get home.  And like all good bbq, it ain't cheap.  Its great food though, and honestly, I think bbq is a food that should be eaten elbow-to-elbow with your fellow diners!"
"It's got to be the best barbeque on the North side of Chicago, perhaps in the entire city."
"Best brisket in Chicago and the best restaurant operations in the city - it could be a Kellogg business case study. You order food at the counter and magically by the time your food is ready a table is available (even for a party of 5 on a Friday night).  I was very impressed with the timing and efficiency of it all.Back to the food, I really enjoyed the mac n' cheese - definitely my favorite side.  It was real cheese and had a good crumb topping.  The brisket is very tender and pairs really well with the BBQ sauce.  The ribs were good, but the brisket is the best.BYOB as well - couldn't be better.  They have (plastic) cups and a wine bottle opener if you are so inclined."
"There is not one bad thing about Smoque. Yes, granted, there can be a line out the door at times, but its worth the wait. Besides, its not a long wait typically. While the ambiance is very relaxed and its BYOB, there's nothing all that remarkable about the location. It's clean, well attended, and love that they have someone get you seats when you order & time your seating with it. You never feel rushed and leave feeling satisfied with your Q feast.Their call ahead feature and carryout is top notch. The food always stays warm (and reheats well if necessary!), and you can lounge while devouring the best Smoque has to offer.Don't be scared away by the pink chicken - it's based off of their smoking technique, they're not serving raw chicken. Rookie mistake that I learned quickly.Definitely try the baked beans, mac & cheese, the brisket with the spicy bbq sauce and peach cobbler."
"I don't eat meat, however my boyfriend will not stop sneaking to Smoque BBQ during his lunch breaks. I might be getting tired of the very fragrant, sweet scent of brisket, but he has not one bit. He was even thinking about buying some to bring to his mom under the guise of his inner master chef, though I'm not sure that she'll buy his little bluff. Anyway, as a vegetarian, I do really enjoy the mac & cheese."
"Fine ribs, fine pulled pork, fine brisket, great sides. The food remains great, long after the place has been discovered.   it's crowded, sure, but the staff handles crowds well.  Many are the imitators on the north side; this is what they wish they were.  BYOB permitted... but fergawdsakes people, it's BBQ.  If you're gonna BYOB, bring beer.  Not wine.  Not cocktails.  Not wine coolers.  Beer.  Beer."
One of the best BBQ places in Chicago. Place can be mobbed so bring your patience.
"Let's talk storage - I'm talking space needed for those items that currently don't fit in your condo/house right now.  The LockUp facility on Kinzie has exceeded our expectations.  Staff is friendly.  The facility is always very clean.  Have used the facility for 5 years without any problem.  The manager, John Cisnerios, is a great guy, knowledgeable and very helpful."
Fantastic!  Just sent a client from Atlanta there today
"I just visited this place last weekend with a few friends on a Saturday night.  We ordered the pulled pork, baby back ribs and brisket.  The brisket and baby back ribs were the best.  They gave you more than enough bbq sauce to enjoy your meal.  The place do gets pretty pack on weekend.  Definitely one of the best bbq joint in the city.  Could use more space to sit though"
"Everyone raves about Smoque but  I feel like its just ok for BBQ, Idk if its the raging heartburn I get from it or what but I'm usually never that* impressed with it. I would call it average.Pulled pork sandwich is great, fries are better at Wendy's, banked beans, awesome. Mac & cheese, not great. The slaw, however, is perfection.Usually a line wraped around to the outside, so if you are dying for BBQ..Drive to Lillie Q in wicker park.."
They do ribs and brisket right. Some of the best I've had since moving here from the east coast. Keeping a star because I'm not much of a fan of their sides.
"Incredible BBQ. Odd location and always busy, but the food is so so so worth it. They also have a pretty efficient ordering/table seating system that boggles my mind. Highly recommend."
"Best ribs in ChicagoBaby backs are the best, try the peach cobbler if you have room."
Had this catered and have been wanting to go back ever since.  Chicago has a severe lack of BBQ restaurants but luckily Smoque (terrible name) is there to alleviate the drought.  Their sides are incredible and while I cannot comment on the portions or what you order in the restaurant I can say that what was catered was outstanding and did not last long in the office.  I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys BBQ and who has been looking for BBQ in the city.
"I love the quick efficiency of this place, which handles a huge crowd without long waits. The BBQ is good, but not life changing. I agree the brisket is tender, but I've have much more flavorful brisket in the South. The sauces are good, though, so pile it on and you'll enjoy some excellent BBQ."
"I was here about 2 1/2 years ago with a friend. The line is super long but the food is great! Authentic food and great drinks. It was a very hot day so we had the tea and it was great. They serve cafeteria-style, which adds to the authentic appeal. I was pleased and would come back. A great place for people who have big appetites and enjoy flavorful southern food!"
"Get there early because the line is always long. The meat tastes just like the name says, smoked. They do everything very well and this is probably my favorite BBQ spot in the city."
"The line to get the meal is definitely worth it! The ribs just fall of the bone, would recommend the BBQ, less fat. The brisket slised is always cooked to perfection. The mac and cheese is a must."
"One day at work I started to crave barbecue out of nowhere. I heard that when you're starving in the wild, your instincts kick in to guide you to the proper nourishment. As the workday progressed, I realized that this hankering may be related to survival so it would be wise to fulfill. I picked up some brisket, a slab of ribs, mac & cheese, cornbread, and the BBQ beans. They were all fantastic, and fulfilled my craving. The brisket had a deep smoke line, nice char and great flavor. One of the owners was manning the cash register, and she provided me with all of their sauces to try. I'm a bigger fan of the smoky, spicy BBQ sauces as opposed to those of the sweet variety. The ribs were pretty good too, but I wouldn't call them lights out. All in all, Smoque does a good job and I was satisfied with their BBQ."
"The food is incredible, by far the best BBQ I have had in Chicago (and I have had my fair share).  The only down side to this spot is the long wait.  I have never eaten there, I have only taken out, but you have place the order for your meal way ahead of time, if not, you could be waiting an hour or so for your order.There was also another time, where my husband waited an hour or so, brought the food home and was given the wrong food... We ordered pulled pork sandwiches, but received a half of slab of ribs and 6 buns....doesn't make much sense...Oh well, people make mistakes.  The ribs were good.  I have gone back since then, and will continue to go back."
"The brisket was tasty and tender yet very lean!  The sausage was ok - personally I prefer spicy sausage and fortunately was able to enjoy mine with their spicy house bbq sauce. The ribs here were good, but I've had better ones."
"In my ongoing quest for the best BBQ well, ever, smoque is a top contender. I went back and forth on 4 stars or 5, and settled on four as a reflection of the overall experience. Based on the actual bbq, though, this would receive a 5+ rating.I had a pulled pork sandwich, and it was, in a word, Phenomenal. Best bbq pork I've had outside of north carolina (home to the best pulled pork on earth.) The meat was juicy, smoky, and tender. I didn't need a sandwich, I could have just eaten a mound of the meat on it's own. Perfection. 5 stars.The rest of the experience was a solid four. I wasn't blown away by the mac and cheese, and I can't handle the vineger slaw that yankees insist on calling cole slaw (if it's not creamy, it's not cole slaw.) That being said, I still ate all the mac and cheese and slaw on my plate, so it's not like they were bad.My boyfriend's meal was the opposite-- his sides were pretty out of the park (baked beans and corn bread), but his sliced brisket was just on the good-side-of-average. I was too full for an order of peach cobbler, but as I do consider peach cobbler to be my true love of the dessert world, you can be sure I'll be back for more. one last note-- it's communal seating, but just barely. The tables are long, but someone seats you after you've ordered, so there's no fighting for a table. All very civilized and easy."
GREAT BBQ! The beans are awesome and the cole slaw is real good.  The pulled pork is really tender too
"very authentic atmosphere, fast service, friendly staff, and great BBQ.  love it.  enough said."
"Murked this place four times, about.  Once went here with Robert Irvine and his peoples.  Crushed all ribs."
We have been here many times and is probably my go to place to bring guests from out of town.  I have always been impressed with the food.  This is THE best BBQ I've ever had.  You will not be disappointed!
"5 stars for a bbq joint might seem excessive, but I have no idea what could be better.  oh, right....if they served beer, but other than that hards to say."
"As far as BBQ goes this place is great.  Had the pulled pork, the BBQ sauce is delicious.  Mac and cheese was great along with a nice cole slaw made with vinegar.  Will def be returning."
The longest part of this was deciding what to eat. I had the pulled pork sandwich it was fantastic! Workers were walking around cleaning tables as soon as someone was done. Will definitely go back !
"Well saw this place on Diners Drive In's & Dives.  Read everyone giving it 5 stars.....hear the place is always packed and hard to get a seat. Heard this is the BEST BBQ in Chicago.  Well, finally I was in the area on a weekday and had to check it out to see what the hype was about.  Walk in and a worker asked me ""how many"" and told me to order as he held a seat for me.  I liked that, instead of people holding down tables for everyone.  Now it was time to order.I went with the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich.  Heard it was awesome.  Came with great fries.  The BBQ sauce they give, is a tad watery.  The Bun......gets very soggy.....the pulled pork.....seemed to lack flavor if you didn't drown in in BBQ sauce.  I was let down.  I found myself eating all the fries first before I even finished my sandwich.  Over all, I wasn't impressed.  I think my friend's BBQ company makes a much better BBQ pork sandwich, with much more flavorful sauces.  Sorry but it's true Smoque."
"Don't be thrown by the Q and the U - Smoque may be run by white men and targeted towards the Yelp crowd, but it's an unassuming place with top notch barbecue and delicious sides.I stopped in on Saturday for a late second lunch, with Michael K., Janice K., her sister, and her sister's roommate.  The place was neither full nor empty at 4 in the afternoon - we enjoyed our food in good company, but without an attendant wait.  I liked the casual bare bones feel of the place.  It felt welcoming in a neighborhood lunch stop kind of way.  We ordered at the counter and took our place at a communal table.  The cashier was pleasant enough, and the food came out fast.After some strategizing, we put in a big order for our party of five, accounting for three of us who already had bellies full of hot dogs.  We ordered brisket, a half rack of St. Louis style ribs, a taste of pulled pork, and a sausage, with sides of cole slaw, BBQ beans, brisket chili, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread, and a little peach cobbler for dessert.  This feast, about enough to feed three hungry people, cost a little over $40 with sodas.Everything was delicious.  The ribs were smokey and very tender, but meaty enough to give a satisfying resistance when I sank in my teeth.  They were painted in sauce, but not drenched, so the flavor of the meat remained supreme.  The pulled pork was superb, moist and flavorful, smoked for hours and pulled apart by hand.  The brisket was not quite as good as the first two, but this was just preference - it was faultless, with a delicate texture usually reserved for fattier cuts of meat.  The sausage was great, thick and full of flavor and spices, with a good level of snap.  We got two barbecue sauces to slather on our meats as we pleased.  One was thicker and sweeter, the other a bit runnier with a vinegar tang.  Both were delicious, and I actually loved mixing them together.The sides were as impressive as the meat, and they made our barbecue session into a complete feast.  I loved the mac and cheese.  It was very cheesy with a touch of creaminess and a nice crispy topping of bread crumbs.  The beans were among some of the best I've had, full of flavor with a far cooked but toothsome texture.  The brisket chili was likewise fantastic, deeply comforting with nice shreds of meat.  The cole slaw was the only light side on the table, and it was refreshingly easy on the mayo, with crisp clean flavors to cut through the smoke and fat of our meal.  The cornbread was the one side I stopped eating after a bite.  Not bad, but not good, a little hard and a little short on butter.We finished with the mini peach cobbler, and I wouldn't leave without tasting this tiny $2.25 treat.  It was more of a crumble than a cobbler, mostly peaches and sugar under a little bit of crunchy crust.  It was sweet and fruity, with a softened fruit texture.  A couple spoonfuls made a nice cap to a meaty meal.I admit I'm no expert, but Smoque provided some of the best barbecue I've had in recent memory.  It was comforting and delicious, and if it were in my town, I'd take advantage of it as often as my body allowed."
Ive been to this place 6 times all pretty good..... ribs today were dry! Tried the bread pudding not good at all.... dry and no flavor! Got some brisket to go it was great! Will be back!
"I've been coming to Smoque for years, primarily for the brisket, and the last two times (this past Tuesday, and about a month before that as well) it has really been off.  Someone else commented that the brisket has been ""pot-roastey"", and that's spot on.  This past Tuesday I ordered one pound of brisket, and the majority of the slices were grey with little-to-no smoke ring.  The slices were also mushy and fatty, with almost no smoke flavor...and the bark, well it really wasn't bark.Good BBQ is part art and part science, and with so many variables even the best are going to have an off day now and then....so I'm still giving Smoque three stars.  It's quite possible that I just hit it at an off time or a bad day, and I won't give up on it yet.  Smoque has definitely earned some leeway, and I hope to raise the rating to 4 or 5 stars down the road.  But another bad experience, and I may be done with it."
"It was amazing! You can only sit at the tables in the restaurant after you order, so there really isn't anywhere to wait with your family. Very long lines, so if you can order ahead and pick it up, do so!"
"Best bbq in the city, everything is really great. It's kind of a trek to get to, but well worth it. There is often a long line, but it moves fast so don't let it scare you away!"
"I've been here twice and the first time was 3 years ago. I don't usually critique food that harsh because I'm not a picky eater. However, if there is a place that serve the same food, then I usually reference that and make a judgment. I'm really picky about BBQ food because the most amazing BBQ place I have ever been to is 'Phil's BBQ' in San Diego, CA. That place is heaven on earth for BBQ food. I've had everything on the menu here and everything's good... but not great. With that said, this place does get crowded I guess cause for Chicago there's not many BBQ place. Overall for me though, this place is ok but don't take my word for it, try it yourself cause your palette is probably different from mine."
"Love the food, hate the long line!!! Love love loooooove all their sides!"
"Delicious!  The food here is really good, but it's not the best BBQ I've had.  If you're visiting Chicago though, I'd definitely check it out."
"This place is pretty good, but I didn't think it was amazing like so many other people have stated. I've been here a few times and the food was always above average, but the consistent long lines i've encountered often make me overlook this place."
"Fun, tasty BBQ. Lots of sauce on everything and kind of masks the flavor of the brisket I had. Will try again and will update my review accordingly!"
"This place was awesome! I was literally sitting on the couch watching DDD waiting for my boyfriend to come home from work when I saw this restaurant.  When he got home, I showed him where we were going to dinner and we were off!! It exceeded every expectation I had! The meat was amazing and the mac and cheese was fabulous.  My best friend is coming into town this weekend and I cannot wait to go back!  Oh and its BYOB"
"I'll be honest, I probably had some over-inflated expectations going into Smoque. Just about everyone I know told me this was THE place to get BBQ in Chicago.My wife and I ordered two full racks of ribs, enough for dinner plus a ton of leftovers. Both of us agreed that the St. Louis style ribs were way better than the baby backs. It wasn't even close. The St. Louis ribs still had a good meaty bite to them, and the smokey crust on the outside was amazing. The baby backs had the same great taste on the outside, but they were actually a little bit TOO tender. They fell apart a little bit too much and you lost a lot of the great meaty flavor. All you got was the crust.We both agreed that randomly, the menu item most deserving of praise was the beans. Their BBQ baked beans are amazing!!! I would highly recommend them. The coleslaw, on the other hand, was a watery disappointment.In the end, I wouldn't say that it was the best I've had-- but a few of the items we ordered came pretty close. Smoque is the perfect name for this place-- they pack some serious smoke flavor into their meats. My hands smelled like a campfire after we were done!!"
"Delicious very smokey ribs. Fantastic and tender brisket. The brisket chili was a zesty and light yummy chili. The Mac and cheese is among the best I have ever had. Very creamy with a crunchy crust. And the final great mark was the salted carmel bread pudding. They put toasted pecans and a streusel topping that adds a great crunch to an otherwise soggy treat. And the salted caramel on top sets it above the rest. Check this place out if you like BBQ. At 8.00 a sandwhich and 4.00 a side, you won't be disappointed."
"Smoque continues to be one of my favorite places for BBQ in Chicago. The beef brisket is so tender and falovorful. They smoke their meat for 12 hours on Monday so they are closed, but this is a guarantee it will be all you hoped for. For sides my top choices would be the mac and cheese and the cornbread. They give you a large portion of fries as a side option too. Although, they wouldn't be my first choice as a side. Don't skip this place, it's worth the trip."
"This place is AWESOME. The food is always fresh and ALWAYS consistent quality. The service is always warm and friendly. One of the best BBQ spots in Chicago for sure. My favorites are the half and half sandwich,  mac and cheese and fries! Glad to live a few blocks away. :) keep up the great work guys!"
"My wife and I have been to Smoque 4 times.  We've never been disappointed!  The food is fast, delicious but come hungry and ready to wait.  The first time we went we had beginners luck with no wait.  The last 3 times we waited roughly 30-40 minutes.  To sum it up, friendly service with great food that doesn't beak the bank! We'll be back... a few more times."
Had them cater my baby's baptism lat year during on the the MAJOR blizzards that stopped the city. Not only did they actually make it to the venue (early!) but the food was warm and DELICIOUS!!! We've used their catering for multiple other events since then and have never been disappointed. Must try!
Love the place!  The Mac & Cheese is to die for!  Sinfully delicious!
"The unrivaled #1 BBQ destination in Chicago for white people scared to go to a black neighborhood. All jokes aside (wait, that wasn't actually a joke), Smoque consistently delivers some really, really good smoked meats. The brisket and the sausage are the unquestioned stars at Smoque. Other than the brisket chili, the sides are nothing to write home about, but only a food would jusge a barbecue spot based on the sides.This place has been packed since it opened and there's no reason that should stop."
"Yummy, tender brisket.  I love the tangy BBQ sauce."
"Smoque is a fairly tiny BBQ joint with a line out the door.  It's good, but not exactly worth the trouble unless you can sneak in when it's not crowded.I arrived late on a Saturday night and my check of Yelp definitely let me know what to expect.  It took maybe a half-hour to get to the register to order.  I didn't understand why so many large groups had shown up to eat.  In a packed zoo like Smoque, bringing the entire Von Trapp family doesn't make sense.  And while it's nice to have a good post-meal conversation, maybe you want to skip it when there is a teeming swarm of people who wish they could sit down.*This is not a restaurant for large groups.*If you want your entire biker gang/graduating class/Mormon Tabernacle Choir to enjoy Smoque, might I suggest getting it to go and having it in your crime den/school gym/rehearsal hall.(A sign on the wall says occupancy by more than 45 people is unlawful and dangerous.  45.  There were easily 100 people there if you include the line out the door.)We ordered a sliced brisket platter with cornbread and fries and a full rack of baby back ribs with beans and mac & cheese.  Peach cobbler on the side.The brisket was good, but not amazing.  The ribs are definitely charred, so hopefully you like that going in.  I preferred the thicker rib sauce to the more watery brisket sauce.As far as the sides, I loved the cornbread and fries.  Big fan of the zesty slaw.  The cobbler was good.  Wasn't a fan of the beans, but I never order them for myself.  And I wish the mac & cheese were creamier.  It was kind of chunky/gritty?I liked Smoque, but I didn't love it.  If I have to stand outside at a restaurant and wait for a tiny, loud table, the food better leave me licking the plate.For future BBQ fixes, I'll stay closer to home and hit Twin Anchors."
Everything is good! Love how the corn bread and peach cobbler comes in a personalized sized cupcake. Coleslaw is different but def good. Also you can taste the smoqued baked beans and the meat falls off the ribs mmm
"Everyone loves Smoque and now I know why...pulled pork, sliced brisket, french fries and baked beans were all incredible.  My friend Ian recommended grabbing some candied jalapenos to go with my meal; I thought those were okay, but everything else was quite tasty.  I would certainly say that for the price and the amount served, a half-sandwich with one side is certainly enough for most regular people during the work day, and enough for my 5'3"" wife any time!  Will be back for sure to take advantage of the outdoor seating."
"Great BBQ, Love the ribs"
"I'm not even joking when I say they had the BEST baby back ribs EVER. The chicken was out of this world, and the peach cobbler and bread pudding were to die for, and the mac and cheese was like angel pillows. We went around 8 pm and there was a line still that only went down around 8:50 or so. Highly recommended!"
I lived in Texas and ate a lot of BBQ. The brisket I had was better than any brisket I've ever tried! The cornbread was to die for. I will be back with anyone looking for some real Texas style BBQ in Chicago.
"I came here more than a year ago and still dream about you guys.Some day, Smoque. Some day..."
"I always like scope out new places, but this place always keeps me coming back.  The smoked brisket is outstanding.  Quite possibly the best I've had anywhere.   Impossibly tender, moist and smoky all at the same time.   I like the ribs and would love to try the pulled pork or chicken, but the brisket keep me coming back. Overall, the sides are okay. B+ to A- range with the mac n cheese and brisket chili being the standouts.  However, the meats are done flawlessly.  Great, great BBQ joint."
There is always a long line so go early!  I went at 11:30ish and got in really quick on a Saturday.  Really great pulled pork BBQ.  The spicy BBQ sauce period is really really good...you can buy a bottle there...which I did!The only thing I didn't really like was the cornbread but everyone else I was with loved it.  You'll smell this place from down the street and it will make your tummy growl.
"Let me begin by saying I've had BBQ in Texas so when several people praised this place as best barbecue in Chicago, I had pretty high expectations which Smoque failed to fulfill.I ordered a brisket platter with cornbread and baked beans as sides. Honestly, the sides were the best part of the meal for me. The brisket, to me, was kinda bland. I didn't even finish it, despite the not-huge portion because it was not satisfying to my palate. I've had better barbecue in Chicago and don't get the hype surrounding this place.I'm willing to make another visit and try a half slab because of this place's reputation though its many accolades and awards make no sense based on my experience alone."
I could die happy here. Enough said.
"Just when you think macaroni and cheese can't get any better, we check out Smoque BBQ and get lost in what can only be described as macaroni and cheese sent down from the Gods (or God). By far the best mac 'n cheese we have ever had. While we didn't sample any fine BBQ meats this go-round, we managed to grab some coleslaw, cornbread, and of course the other worldly Mac 'n Cheese. Slaw wasn't as creamy as most, but far from inedible and popping with flavor. The cornbread was superb, velvety and fresh out of the oven. Only downside was the freaking crowd! This place gets rocking at lunch, so if you're in a hurry, call ahead and get it to go. Unless you enjoy rubbing elbows with strangers while BBQ sauce drips down your face. Bring your wallet too, it can get expensive. Thanks again Smoque!"
Food was good. Environment was good. The brisket chilli and the peach cobbler is a must try.
"Sooooo good. Only had take out, but have never been disappointed. Brisket is top notch."
"I must say this is quite the best BBQ joint in the city, the chopped brisket just melts, I go there every time I go to the city. Oh and don't forget to try the peach cobbler."
"I could definitely smell and taste the smoke and me likey!We ordered brisket, ribs, coleslaw, fries, and macaroni and cheese for about $25. We were greeted and served by the owner, which was a treat. He took the time to really explain all four sauces before me. M declared them to be truly spectacular.So here's the deal. You know from all the other reviews that the food at Smoque is delicious. No contest there! I especially liked the coleslaw, which tasted kinda like this Asian cabbage salad with Ramen Noodle topping. M said that my dad makes better ribs. I thought the brisket was yum yum yummy, but M thought it was too fatty. I wasn't the biggest fan of the macaroni and cheese... The noodles were too soft.The service was also amazing. All of the employees seemed happy (not quite Trader Joe level, but close) to be there and the owner was friendly, but not overbearing. We ordered at the counter (with gentle suggestions from the owner) and then were told where to sit. In a few minutes, our food was brought to us. The tables were clean.This is our major complaint about Smoque. It was not overly busy the rainy, Wednesday evening we went (not like the descriptions of other reviewers). Yet, people were still seated, cafeteria-style, right next to one another. Literally. I could move my elbow a few inches and jab my neighbors on either side of me! It was noisy. M and I could not have a conversation. That characteristic alone is enough to keep us away from Smoque. After all, if we're going to travel out of our way for food, we'd like to savor the experience with a dollop of conversation."
My favorite BBQ in Chicago!  Everything is amazing!  The only thing I wish is that the sides were a little bigger.
"I've visited this place just once....here's my take.   Pleasant enough place, efficiently run.  Get's crowded but they help you find a seat after you order at the counter.   It seems to be the in place to get BBQ.  I don't see why.   The food is good, but not great.   I've had much better ribs at many other places around Chicago and other cities.   There is often a line  - if it's too long, it's not worth the wait."
"I came here early last fall on a Saturday around lunch time.   They were out of bbq'd chicken, so I had the brisket instead.  It was pretty tender, but I defintely prefer chicken to beef when it comes to my bbq.  The space is small and the tables are super close together."
Some of the best BBQ in the city. I think it is tied with Lilly-Q and Honky Tonk BBQ.
"Neighboorhood place with excellent BBQ.  I luv the sauce, Brisket, half and half, mac and cheese, slaw and it's a nieghborhood chef/owner.  I look forward to a larger space but it's really good.  Check it out."
"I love me some bbq, I would say I'm more of an enthusiast than a connoisseur, because I like it all and can appreciate the different styles.  Even mediocre bbq is better than just about anything else you could eat.  I've been to Smoque a few times, a line out the door is usually a good sign that a place is going to be worth the wait.  The line at Smoque is always long, but it moves fast and even thought the tables are always full, it always seems to work out that someone is leaving just as I am finishing up my order at the counter.The pulled pork is the star for me, the brisket is a close second it's smokey and juicy, the ribs are good but not the best.  The sides are all delicious, I love the beans and cole slaw, and the desserts were good.I'm always on the lookout for a better bbq joint, but for today Smoque is king of the hill in Chicagoland."
"Disclaimer:  this review is skewed because I went to Smoque after a 50-mile bike ride and ANYTHING would have tasted good after that.I'm not a huge fan of ribs.  But I love the baby backs at Smoque.  Incredible.  Just writing this is making me want to go there right now.Tips for you:1. Go at off times!  It's more relaxing.  I like 3:30pm on Saturdays, myself.2. Get the full rack of baby back ribs.  Get a half rack and you'll be sad.  Get anything else on the menu, and you'll be missing out.3. Sides:  choices, choices!  Cornbread, definitely.  Baked beans--a must if you can handle the sweetness.  Don't order the coleslaw as a side--it comes as a mini-side for free.  If you are extra hungry or have someone who can help you finish, get the mac and cheese."
"Going to Smoque for BBQ is like going to the south side for blues. As a white, middle class suburban kid, this is an adventure! Fortunately, they're about 6 inches off of the Kennedy on Pulaski, so that's lowers the anxiety a bit. But then you pull in and the street seems full of signs that basically say, ""If you're a Smoque customer, don't even THINK of parking here!"" In fact, I think some of the signs said EXACTLY that. But after a bit of roaming around, we found a parking spot that didn't appear to have a ""TOW ZONE"" sign in effect -- at that moment.With that friendly neighborhood greeting, we walked into Smoque. It's nothing special to look at on the outside, and not much better inside. There's a wall-covering blackboard with the menu, but it's starting to fade out, making it hard for noobs like us to decipher. Fortunately, my brother is a regular here, so I didn't need the menu.Even at 1:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon, the place is jammed. The line is not out the door, and that's something. We order, a kid on the floor asks uhow many are in our party, and what our order numbers are. Every table is jammed and it looks like we're going to eat standing up.15 minutes or less later, as the kitchen nears our number, the kid shows us to 4 seats, conveniently located in the corner and near the pop machine --perfect for me! 3 minutes later, our food comes out. I order the sweet jalapenos and head back to the table.My first mouthful of chopped brisket is, well, awesome! Lots of smoke, crunchy crust, great beef taste, subtle complex BBQ sauce and perfect moisture. Cole slaw and fries are both really good, as are the beans.I agree with my bro -- the brisket is the choice here, but my wife's pulled pork sandwich was great -- and the 1/2 sandwich was just the right size for her appetite.We didn't feel rushed, even with 30+ people standing in the aisles waiting for a table. Overall, this place runs great -- they should give crowd management lessons to some other restaurants that will remain nameless. And to all my fellow melanin-challenged white kids out in suburbia, it's okay, nothing to worry about here -- c'mon down!"
"Great food, had them cater.  Everyone loved it!!!!"
"Fantastic place for BBQ in Chicago.  I've been several times and never been let down, food is always hot and fresh, they do run out of stuff thought so best to go earlier than later! My mouth is watering just thinking about this place! Can't wait to go again!"
"This place is bomb, was quite busy a Sunday afternoon, line getting almost out the door.Me and my buddy ordered the brisket, chicken, ribs, and sausage links.  The ribs were very smokey flavor, brisket so tender and juicy.  Those were the real standouts to me.  I wish we had BBQ like this in so cal, maybe it's good we don't or I'd gain so much weight eating here!Parking was really easy outside.  The house BBQ sauce had quite a kick to it, not spicy but like vinaigrette-like.  My friends loved it, I can only handle a little.  Just great BBQ!"
"This place is killer. Small menu, but everything's great. Speaking as a side dish aficionado, I'm a particular fan of the beans and the cobbler. One star off for the inadequate seating and nonexistent waiting area, which makes the experience a lot less pleasant. I'm fine with the picnic tables -- they just need a better way to accommodate the (justified) crowds. Take-out is a better choice."
"Good BBQ. Had the pulled pork and brisket with a side of mac n cheese. The pulled pork was great, the brisket was good but not great, and the mac n cheese was just ok. The inside is small, however, they do get people through the place quick and you don't feel rushed. I thought the bbq sauce could use some work.Still a great place to eat."
"I had heard about Smoque as being the best BBQ place in town, but given it's offbeat location, I never actually landed up going there until now. I ventured out there for lunch today and tried their brisket platter with a side of corn bread and slaw. Everything was fantastic, and I can see why this place h as 4.5 stars on Yelp with almost 2800 reviews. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because I've had better BBQ elsewhere, but may be I'll change my change once I try a few more things on their menu."
"Smoque is fantastic! We go very often for lunch. I love the brisket and the ribs. I recommend getting the ""taste"" of both and a side. Sometimes it can get a bit loud inside, but otherwise it's a great spot for some delicious BBQ."
"We came here for the husband's birthday. He loved it. We split ribs, pulled pork sandwich, slaw, mac and cheese, brisket chili, and peach cobbler. All were delicious. The staff is very friendly too.This place must be filled to capacity on a regular basis. We went at 1 on a Tuesday and it was packed. Guess everyone knows how good it is."
"Please Smoque, add a location in Andersonville or Edgewater!"
"Best BBQ I have ever had!  I don't even know where to begin.  I am picky as all hell when it comes to meat so lets begin there...the sliced beef brisket, pulled pork sandwiches, and baby back ribs are for lack of a better word, flawless!  It's rare when you can rely on a single place to make all these cuts having all the desirable qualities you are looking for in authentic barbeque.  From my understanding, they slow smoke with an applewood and oakwood mix for upwards of 15 hours.  And their Memphis style barbeque sauce perfectly compliments these cuts.  The brisket is moist and flavorful.  The pulled pork sandwiches use a brioche-like bun that doesn't overpower the flavor of the meat.  And the baby back ribs are done correctly.  I hate eating ribs that fall right off the bone like gelatin.  The ribs here have the perfect consistency which is a testament to the quality and attention to detail of their smoking process.Their sides deserve mention as well.  I don't really care for coleslaw in general but their coleslaw is wonderful.  It doesn't have an overpowering mayonnaise taste that's become so commonplace.  Their baked beans incorporate some of their chopped brisket!  And their ""side of fries"" is a big bag of beefy potato fries.The bottom line is that Smoque BBQ is the quintessential standard of barbeque in the Midwest.  I only make 2 suggestions: come hungry and don't be impatient if there's a line out the door because the food is worth it!Full disclosure: I did try their Texas sausage and chili and I wasn't impressed.  Hey, nobody's perfect!  They still get 5 stars because of the quality of everything else!"
"Smoque in my personal opinion is by far the best BBQ in Chicago. Local's love it, and so they should. Offers an amazingly proportionated meal with some of the most hearty, filling, but not over the top food. I loved the peach cobbler. Went there on an afternoon adventure to walk away dying to return."
Excellent Ribs for reasonable price!
"Best BBQ I have ever had. Brisket is the standout, but the ribs just may make you cry, as well."
I am kind of a BBQ snob (grew up in KC) but this place is awesome. Definitely one of my favorite spots in Chicago!
Had lunch here. Boy was it busy. They seat everyone in order of when they come in. No seats between people to keep the place packed. I had the briscuit and my girlfriend had the pulled pork. Both were great. Even got to have some butterscotch soda. It was called DANG. Good place. recommend.
"This place is phenomenal.  If you're into smoked and barbecued food, this place is the gold standard since everything on the menu is delicious!  They have red meat, chicken and sausage.  I can't tell which I like more, the taste of the meats or the sauces (I've been caught drinking the sauce!).  The sides are all amazing, each has it's own unique taste, which is compared to no other establishment.  My go-to dish is the sliced brisket sandwich, a side of barbecue beans and a half's of St. Louis ribs.A note on the ribs: if you're looking for ""off-the-bone"" ribs, this isn't that type of place.  These are heavily rubbed and smoked for hours and hours, so you have to take your time with each rib bone and slowly play the meat off with every bite.  I'm making my own mouth water as I type this.  =DTake it from this dental doc, eat here and be merry."
Awsome Q. I know my brisket and this place is the best. Sides are great as well.  All it needs is a wine and beer license and it would be perfect.
"Get a little bit of everything. Go crazy. You will not regret having leftovers. Also, try and know what you want when you get there - the line forms fast! This place is definitely not BBQ authentico, but it's a nice respite from the chewy stuff everywhere else."
Hands down the best bbq in Chicago! And very reasonably priced. Make sure you come early to beat the rush. Don't be scared by the long line... it moves quick
"This place has the most amazing brisket ever in life. So good that I've been obsessing pretty hard lately. I go every other week, and though I just went this past Friday I'm fighting the urge to go again today (Sunday) for more! I'm pretty sure they know me and my husband by now lol. So should I go again?! Haha help me out guys. They need a program for this or something. Their St. Louis ribs are pretty amazing too. Sooo much goodness!"
One of my favorite places for BBQ in Chicago!
"Is Smoque the best BBQ in the whole wide world?  Probably not.  But by Chicago standards, this place is awesome.  But disclaimer!: if you order to-go in the winter, make sure you eat the food in a timely manner, because if you spent inordinate amounts of time outside with your takeout, the cold will ruin that hot freshly-smoked taste of the BBQ.I got the sliced brisket sandwich, slaw, and a side of mac and cheese.  Even though my food cooled down a bit, my brisket was still moist, tender, and juicy, with a few bites here and there of the fatty portions.  The BBQ sauce was a fine compliment-- zesty and tangy to balance out the richness of the meat.  The mac and cheese was also fantastic: creamy with a hint of sharpness from the cheddar, and topped with a crust of bread crumbs.  And unlike many other places which will slather their coleslaw in mayo, Smoque's slaw was crisp, tangy, and refreshing.  I haven't tried the other meats or platters, but I will be back again."
Favorite BBQ place so far! BEST PULLED PORK!! Sides are great. Our shop is right down the street so if a client is waiting to get tattooed and is looking to get something to eat we do not hesitate to send them there. Gets a little packed at times but we always get lucky and only have to wait a short time. :)
"First off, when you get a side, get peach cobbler. This is an absolute must and is basically non-negotiable for me.I went today and got the chopped brisket meal with an addition of a 1/4 rack of ribs. The brisket had a lot of smokey flavor that mixed very well with the flavor of the barbeque sauce. The ribs had the similar smokey flavor, but had a different twinge to them. I assume that twinge is the St. Louis style. For my sides, I got the corn bread, peach cobber, and the free addition of cole slaw. The corn bread was very moist and flavorful. As a corn bread lover, I was very satisfied. The cole slaw was oil based and very flavorful."
"To say this was the best brisket I ever ate, would be an understatement.  To say that I never really ate brisket done right until this day, would be more appropriate.  And I eat alot of barbecue.The baby back ribs are also excellent and maybe the best I've ever eaten as well.  And then there was the Texas sausage that was amazing.It's a small place and very popular but the staff are incredibly efficient so by the time your food is ready, they have cleared a table and will escort you to it.  The sides are overshadowed by the meat but the peach cobbler is pretty awesome and I could have ordered two.  Bill for two pple wtih sodas was $34.38.  But it's BYOB so bring your own if you like.Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!"
"I get the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich with brisket and pork. It is fantastic every time. This place is out in the middle of nowhere so we've always driven, which is probably your best bet. The cornbread is also good and the slaw is great- not too sweet, which is what I like. I probably won't make it out to Smoque as much since my office moved down to the loop, and I will lament that for the rest of time."
The absolute best chopped brisket you will find in Chicago (but I have not been to Honky Tonk Barbecue yet.).
"I will consume pork only at Smoque. I am not religiously or culturally affiliated with anything that forbids pork consumption, but I try to avoid it when possible. However, I will eat the Smoque ribs very willingly. And not eat ribs anywhere else.The St. Louis ribs are very satisfying, and the bones are enormous. After eating all that meat (which tastes excellent dry (i.e. without sauce)) the bones left behind are almost comically big! Adding a little sauce every few bites adds the right amount of tangy sweet extra saltiness.Smoque definitely sets themselves apart from the competition by offering superior sides. The french fries are incredibly consistent, always hot and the right crispiness / tender, never limp or underseasoned. And the portion of french fries is decent as well. The baked beans and brisket chili round out my trio of favorite Smoque sides.The rib meat, combined with fresh french fries, rich baked beans, and that incredible cool crunchy vinegary fresh coleslaw is one of my favorite food experiences. If anyone requests a Chicago restaurant recommendation, usually Smoque ends up being one of my top recommendations. Prices are fair, maybe a little high. You may want to consider that after dining in the restaurant you can sometimes end up leaving with your clothes smelling a bit like the smoque restaurant...I do wish Smoque would try making BEEF RIBS sometime! I would be willing to come much more frequently if they tried that out. Please.."
"So....I really really really wanted this to be a 5-star review.  Sorry Smoque, I just couldn't do it.  Smoque is the reason I implemented the ""would I bring out of town guests here"" to some of my reviews...because...and I'm sorry to say it, I wouldn't...So, on with it...Pros:- Good BBQ, fresh, juicy- Pretty good sauce...but not my favorite, but still good- They seem to have other sauces (how can I try them?)- BYO- SUPER friendly staff- Value is good- Mac and cheese!Cons;- Location- Parking- Food was good, but I didn't find it spectacular.  - I don't love the cafeteria vibe...good for lunch, not so for dinner- I would like way more sauce- Fries...look delicious...not so muchI wouldn't bring people out here, but I would get take out...I'm not sure I'd stop in for dinner, but it's an ok spot for lunch.  My 4 stars are basically for food quality, but I do like other spots a tad better.  Sorry Smoque!"
Best BBQ in the city. The sides are excellent and the brisket is awesome. Sweet tea is pretty solid too. Can't go wrong at this place.
"Little story. I went to Nashville for work and flew to Nashville Airport. On the way back home, I almost got a ticket cuz I was almost late, but somehow, once I got checked in 'n' all, I had plenty of time! So, since I didn't eat lunch, I stopped by this random bar that served food (remember, this is in an AIRPORT). I had their pulled pork, and while their BBQ sauce was about on par with Smoque, the pulled pork itself was DELICIOUS! But this is not a review about Airport Bar Food, this is Smoque.Then I thought to myself, there is no way that an AIRPORT, no matter where it is, can have better BBQ than an established and popular restaurant like Smoque. I've been dying to go back to compare, and finally I did...Tried: (My rating in parentheses)- St. Louis Ribs (8/10)- Pulled Pork (2/10)(Sides)- Mac & Cheese (7/10)- Smoque Chili (3/10)- Slaw (1/10)(Sauce)- Memphis Style (5/10)This time I got a 1/2 slab of St. Louis and the pulled pork. They had a special thing for Smoque Chili, so I subbed that for the beans. Now that I actually have something to compare the pulled pork to, I can safely say that Smoque's pulled pork is bad. It's try and tasteless. It's so bad that the mediocre BBQ sauce actually helps it a lot, but the texture doesn't change and it's just disappointing. Feels like sawdust, your mouth gets dryer eating it. With every bite I compared it to Nashville Airport's and it paled in every regard. Funny, because this is what people say to try when you go.St. Louis Ribs took a small 1 pt dive. Maybe it's because it's not new anymore, I don't know. 8 is still very respectable; problem is, I don't think I'll ever crave Smoque for it. The rib meat itself is great, but I don't want to have JUST ribs, I want sauce, and if the rib meat is good, but sauce sucks, then it just crapsizes the whole experience.All in all, I'm lowering my Smoque rating to 2/5. It really is ""Meh"" and I really have experienced better. It's not A-OK, and I'm pretty certain that I'll never have a craving for it. In fact, if I'm with a group of people and they all suggest Smoque, I won't adamantly refuse, but I will definitely be the first to offer a new suggestion. Add another one to the Great Chicago BBQ Failure. Next up, Honkeytonk BBQ."
so good.
"Yes please! The aroma alone with knock you taste buds silly! Its what a BBQ joint is suppose to be. The Mac & Cheese is money and being from the south the cobbler will give you that taste of southern comfort food. And that's just a side and a dessert, imagine the Q?"
"I'm not sure what the buzz is about. I suppose when a place catches on, it catches on. Heavy weekends crowds, Cable TV acclaim...I just didn't get it.I had the pulled pork. It was moderately flavorful, the sauce was rather bland, smoky but otherwise bland. Decent fries. Ok BBQ beans.I dunno...go there and see what you think. If I'm wrong, you get a good meal, If Im right, well I warned you! lol"
"Wow, I never thought BBQ could be this good. But it can. And it is. At Smoque BBQ just about 15 minutes outside downtown Chicago. I would give it 6 stars if I could. Recco'ed by JL who has never disappointed and really knows her eats. Keep your friends close and your foodie friends closer.Nestled on a street lined with small businesses and residential homes, the brick building stood out with the name painted right on it. The minute we walked in, the smell of BBQ wrapped around you like a warm hug. Mmmm...barbequey hugs are the best. The atmosphere was like being in someone's garage. One wall held a huge chalk board with the menu. I didn't have to look far before deciding on a 1/2 slab of baby back ribs with 2 sides for about $14. I originally chose mac and cheese and coleslaw as my sides, but happily found out that the meal already came with slaw and so I ecstatically selected cornbread. Tears almost came to my eyes as I realized they served Coke. After being at multiple places in the city, I was beginning to think the entire state of Illinois only served Pepsi. But there is was, a self-serve fountain soda machine with Coke clearly written on the side. Some guy told us to order our food first and he would put together a table for our party of 5. The entire place probably only seated about 25 or 30 people. We were seated by the window, right next to the counter where the food came out. We probably waited about 10 minutes, maybe less before our orders were called. You help yourself to plastic utensils and there are plenty of napkin dispensers on the tables. Important detail: the napkins came out from the top so they were easy to pull with your bbq-laden hands. Very important to have easy access to napkins.Anyway, the ribs were flavorful, juicy and fell off the bone. They give you extra sauce and it was probably the best BBQ sauce I've ever had. I wanted to stick a straw into it and drink it. The cornbread was so warm, the crust was perfect and the bread was moist. It and the mac and cheese, so cheesy, so yummy, both came in these little aluminum containers that were the perfect size. Anymore and it would've been overkill. The slaw was vinegar-based, not mayo-based, so it was interesting and different, but in a great way. For 5 people, it was only about $70.Others at the table got brisket (thumbs up) and someone got the fries, which came in a mini brown bag that soon became grease-soaked. They were regular-sized fries, just simple tossed in like salt and pepper, but still had the skin on. And they were fried to perfection. As we finished one by one, some guy came by and took away some of our trays for us.As we stood up to leave, my colleague who ordered the fries put it on his tray. I panicked. Me: ""Are you going to throw those away??!"" Him: ""Well, yeah."" Me: ""Are you crazy? I'll take them to go and eat them in the car.""So he handed me the bag, I took some napkins and wrapped the bottom, and took them with me. As we pulled away, I looked back and was so sad that this would be my only visit to Smoque during this trip to Chicago.As I sat in the back row of the Sienna, with my Coke in the cupholder, I finished off the bag of fries in about 5 minutes and was completely content. Until we meet again."
Best brisket around
This place is AMAZING!!!  It's become almost a weekly Friday night dinner for us.  My kids (age 4) love this place and ask for it on a weekly basis.  The mac & cheese... awesome!!!  Pulled pork... THE Best!  Cannot recommend enough!
The chopped brisket sandwich is the best barbeque I've ever had. Don't miss out on the mac and cheese either. I crave this relentlessly.
"I moved to chicago not long time ago, and i have tried the brisket in some other place and i did not like it at all, till one of my friends was convincing me to visit this place and he was very sure that i would like it,I actually been to the place many times now i really like their brisket they are very tasty and its one of the best restaurants in chicago that i have been to.I really recommend this place and who ever visits chicago not to miss it"
"Second only to Lillie's Q. Definitely top 5 BBQ pit in Chicago for me. Actually go here quite often nowadays. I usually get the half slab of baby back ribs with a double side of mac & cheese or mac & cheese and fries. You get a choice of two sides with your platter. Whatever you do, make sure you get the mac & cheese, you won't be disappointed.The host/bus staff is extremely helpful in finding you a seat as soon as you submit your order at the counter. Very affordable and worth the wait. The long line goes fairly quickly. Just have someone in line with you to chop it up with, and you'll barely notice the wait."
"I was so excited to come here and was woefully disappointed despite sampling a few things:The coleslaw, followed by the pulled pork, was the highlight of a rather mediocre lunch here. And coleslaw should not be the best thing at a BBQ restaurant. Their famed brisket was dry despite being fatty and was a total let-down. I also wasn't a fan of the dry rub on the ribs, and something had to be off because they were extra brittle and dry.However the price was decent and the staff nice. I've directed friends to go to Fat Willy's instead."
"great sets of sauces...tasty sides and the most important, good meat.  The brisket is fabulous.so many delicious things to chpoose from"
"I won't bury the lead here - my girlfriend and I ate here last night and our stomachs are still upset about 24 hours later.That said, the food didn't taste bad. The mac and cheese and cornbread were bland, but the beans and slaw were just right. Baby back ribs and pulled pork could've used more seasoning. The barbecue sauces were unremarkable. Like I said - not bad, but definitely not what I was expecting given a 4.5 star average. There's a chain in Ohio/Indiana/Kentucky called City Barbeque that blows this place away.I thought the portion sizes were okay, and the prices would've been fine if the food were as great as advertised on Yelp. If I hadn't gotten sick, I'd give this place three stars, but anywhere that makes me sick pretty much has to get one star in my opinion.Edit: I'm going to put two stars back for excellent customer service (the rating I would've given the place if I hadn't felt sick after eating there). Barry wrote me today asking for a chance to make this right and comp my order. I'm willing to do so, to see if I like some of the other items on the menu and in the hopes that this bad experience was an isolated incident. Either way, I'll write another review about my experience when I come back."
"Smoque is Great!  By far they have some of the best BBQ in Chicago.  Order ahead or be prepared to wait in line, sometimes all the way out side.  I think the sides are a bit small, but other than that, Smoque is top in my book."
"This is the best barbecue in the city. While I enjoy everything on the menu, the brisket is the best I have eaten anywhere.  I also enjoy all of the sides. They do a good job at moving people in and out during lunch. I also have used them to cater parties and it worked out well.  This is a place not to be missed."
The Beef Brisket is outta this world.  Can't stop eating.....
"My friend Bethany, who lives nearby, recommended this place and it did not disappoint. This place is Mmmm Mmmmm good! My favorite? The pork sandwich. Ask for the Memphis sauce. This is the more ""BBQ-y"" of the two sauces. The other is more of a vinegar base and lacks that tangy BBQ flavor.  The mac n' cheese and peach cobbler make for delicious sides. My friend, Bethany, loves the ribs. I have yet to try them as they are a bit messy to eat. I guess I can be a BBQ prima donna that way! lol Smoque is closed on Mondays, but other than that, it's a fantastic place worth checking out, with outdoor seating, weather permitting!"
"This place is pricey, but the St. Louis ribs are good they have a lot of meat on them better then the baby back ribs.we always call for take out haven't eaten in. The cold slaw is not good at ALL. all of the side come is white foam tubs. Bake beans has a lot of onions in them.my husband said the mac&cheese is good it has to crust on top. Corn bread is in a small aluminum tub wrapped in foil.everything was hot .i have heard and seen if you wanted to eat it its a long wait."
"Always on point!!! Everything is excellent! !!! Crappy service when crowded though.would,ve recieved 5 stars otherwise."
I went here because of all the reviews but did not find it to be anything special. We got there right when it opened which is good bc within twenty minutes of eating the place was packed! I got pulled pork which had a lot of smoky flavor which was nice but I like my pulled pork with a lot of BBQ sauce and this didn't have much. Their sauce also wasn't very sweet which is how I prefer it. The portion sizes were good for the price. The service was also very good and they do a good job of clearing tables quickly to accommodate all the customers.
"Mmmmm beef brisket and peach cobbler!  Those are the 2 dishes I would most definitely come back for. The beef brisket was as tender as meat can get.  Be sure to get it sliced instead of chopped.  And that peach cobbler was a cup of heaven!  The toasted almonds really made it exceptional.The pulled pork, chicken, mac 'n cheese, and slaw were alright, but nothing to write home about, in my opinion.  What I was impressed with was how efficiently and expertly the waitstaff organized the line and found each party a table to sit at.  Smoque smokes any other BBQ place in my mind, to date."
"incredible, not much else to say"
"Great southern BBQ, had the brisket sandwich with the side of fries, the brisket was great and the fries were great. The place is a little small but it's a must eat."
"Went for lunch on our Company Outing. I had the Half Pulled Pork Sandwich w/ slaw and fries, and it was AWESOME! The sandwich was huge (i'm afraid to see what a whole one looks like), the fries were crisp, and for someone who dosen't even eat coleslaw, that container was empty. The best part? BYOB, so I was able to enjoy my Hard Apple Cider with my sandwich."
"I love hot meat and BBQ, and fortunately, this place has a lot of both.I've heard nothing but good things about Smoque and after a little convincing, my dad and I drove there for lunch while he was in town visiting. Yes, it's not convenient to get to, but with some spare time, a bus (or cab), you can get there without one.Let me just say, this BBQ was damn amazing in my book.I got a platter of sliced brisket and pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese, cornbread and sample of the KC style ribs.My meal was amazing. The sauce was excellent, pork was perfectly cooked and tender, brisket had very little fat and was just fall apart cooked. I cannot rave about this enough. Literally, I wanted to make inappropriate noises out loud because it was so tasty.The mac and cheese was good but very rich. Glad it was in a small cup, but still worthwhile to try if you're a fan.The coleslaw was also good, but not my favorite. However, my dad, who loves cole slaw, raved about it, so there you go. He also got the side of the BBQ beans which he loved and from my taste, I was impressed too. Very smokey flavor that was really nice with the beans.The only thing that missed the mark for me was the ribs. Maybe it was because of the smaller portion, but the KC style ribs were tough and difficult to eat. We had to cut the bones apart to get to the meat. But dad took a rack of the Baby Back ones home and said they were great, so maybe I just got a bum sample.I even went BACK inside to get food to take home, which I'm enjoying as I write this. And i still wish there were more just sitting in my apartment.I cannot rave about the food enough. LOVED IT.The service was also really professional and well organized. Staff helped us order, get seated, notify us when the food was ready and the wait time for food was short. They were all very nice and no question we asked was ever considered dumb. Very  nice experience, on top of the food.Get there!"
"This is probably the best St Louis ribs outside of St Louis, and definitely the best BBQ place in Chi Town, hands down yaw!! A lot of folks complains about the line at this place - well there's a reason for that line.....it's great BBQ!Ambiance: 4 out of 5You don't go to BBQ place for Ambiance, but hold your horses.....you gave it a 4 stars rating!??....For me, ""real"" bbq place are a hold in the wall with great food. You eat with your hands. This place actually has good table and seating with nice ""waiters"" so the ""4-stars"" are in comparison to other BBQ place not a micheline restaurant - which BTW Somque is recommended by Michelin.Service: n/aAgain same concept with ambiance - service is not the why you come here but the ""waiters"" and cashier are nice and answers our questions and gave good recommendations.Food: 5 out of 5This is where the Smoque is the creme de la creme!. Again, BBQ ribs are the best I had outside of St Louis. The suprising star for this place is actually thier brisket and the common and lowly Mac and Cheese. I had the best Brisket here, nice and tendor, melt in your mouth.I was not a fan of Mac and Cheese until I came to this place. Bake beans - a BBQ staple is tasty and well done. Bottomline:-I AM going to be back very soon and I highly recommends all folks looking for a BBQ place in Chicago to come and try out thier Brisket, Ribs and Mac and Cheese!. DMAN"
"As Creative Director of The Agency in my mind, I try to come up with a good slogan for this place, like:""Meet me at Smoque, for Barbe-queue and a Coque."" Or""Smoque really taques the caque where BBQ s concerned."" Or how about:""It's no joque. This old bloque, he really liques Smoque.""OK, so an ad man I am not.But seriously, Smoque is a most unpretentious spot for quality made-with-love BBQ, friendly uncomplicated service, and mouth-watering food at a reasonable price. Hit it mid-afternoon like we did on a Friday and you can skip the usual ""queueing up."" We were served lique it was a fast food  joint. Love the brisket and pulled pork. Have not tried the ribs yet. I also lique the casual college town ambience. The painted cinder block walls, the hard cement floor and the utilitarian hard-edged furniture. You can get Taque-out, and the place is BYOB, too. For Pete's saque, if you haven't bean, maque haste, and get thee to Smoque. Queue or no queue,  it's well worth the treque."
"You have never eaten at a real BBQ place, you'll think this is great.  If you have had real BBQ before, you'll know this is a waste of time.Pro-tip to the owner: learn how to trim a brisket before you smoke it. Not only is an inch of fat on brisket unappetizing, but it doesn't allow the fat to render properly or smoke (or smoque if you're being cute) to penetrate the meat."
"This is the best BBQ in Chicago and the midwest. Briskett, sausage, pulled pork, ribs, you name it - incredible. Good sauces. I can't wait to go back. Its also BYOB which is a plus."
"Love me some Smoque! Their BBQ is amazing, the baked beans are incredibly delicious and the staff is really warm and welcoming. Not a huge fan of ordering my food before I have a seat but Smoque is the one place I will make an exception. Yum!"
"This place is awesome.  Fast BBQ, great prices, huge portions and delicious!  You go in, place your order and then get seated.  I ordered the half slab of baby back ribs with slaw, fries and Mac and cheese. It came with a lot of fries that were super crispy.  If there were any negatives, it was that the fries had a bit too much oil in them but that's where the flavor is at!  You definitely don't come here if you are trying to diet.  The ribs were tender but not fall off the bone soft.  The sauce had a little kick but was delicious.  The cole slaw was awesome. It was made of cabbage and onions with some kind of vinaigrette mixture.  No mayo in cole slaw!  Everyone working there was extremely nice and friendly.  After eating, they even cleaned off and bused my table!  I felt bad as I was leaving because I should have given them a tip!  Sorry!  Definitely visit this place and tip those people that are kind enough to bus your table.  I definitely will go back if I'm in the area and will tip!  :)"
Great BBQ! I have been here numerous times both for take out and delivery. Mac and cheese is delish as well as their brisket and pork. I especially like the bbq sauce. I only knock this down a star because of the pricing. It is a tad bit too high for BBQ but maybe that's because I used to live in Texas.
"Best BBQ in Chicago bar none! Seriously maybe the best Beef Brisket and Pulled Pork we've ever had and this is from someone whom participates and who's team placed third in the World Championship BBQ Competition in Memphis, TN! The meat fell apart, the people were friendly and fast, the owners were there talking with patrons.  Seriously I think this is the best BBQ I've ever had.."
Tasty Brisket.
get there early! i have never had a bad thing.  there is nothing fancy about this place and that's why i love it.
"Went for lunch during a weekday. Pretty good BBQ, but in my opinion all of the hype is not all its cracked up to be. This is not to imply that Smoque is bad, whatsoever. Just wasn't as good as I expected based on what I had heard.I had the chopped brisket platter and found it was good, just a little dry. The cost was a little pricey for lunch, $13 or so,  but not outrageous. All in all I will be back."
"Eating at Smoque is a almost a religious experience. Being from Canada, I had no idea what I was getting into when I ordered a plate of pulled pork and brisket. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the brisket was absolutely delicious. One of the best meals I've ever had. If you're in Chicago, there's no reason why you shouldn't stop by this place and give it a try. Even if BBQ isn't your thing, I really challenge you not to like this place."
"Lets put it this way - YOU MAY GET STABBED BY YOUR WIFE FOR THE PEACH COBBLER.....Mac N Cheese is to die for!I visited Smoque'd when it launched...and was not too impressed....But gave it another shot after craving BBQ and was so blown away I had to do a double-take the next day....If you love BBQ, you will love Smoque'd....Wait time sucks, so i would def. order in advance and pick up your order...Place is always jammed packed with BBQ lovers and not too much space inside...Enjoy!"
"You can't go wrong here. By far the best BBQ in Chicago. My go to meal is: sliced brisket, mac and cheese, baked beans and corn bread."
"Love the brisket here. Also, not really a fan of chicken when dining out, but the chicken here is really delicious and i'd order it with the brisket every time."
"As a Mississippi and Memphis guy, I'm going to be prideful and say I'm qualified to make a few comments. My comments are based on three visits. Anyone can accidentally knock a brisket out of the park just as Darwin Barney accidentally hit six balls out of the park this year. First suggestion. Toss the chicken and sausage off the menu. It has no place at a barbecue joint. I remember ordering my first hot dog with ketchup in Chicago. No one told me different. Down South, they would be even less polite. ""Did you say chicken, sir?"" ""If so, you have about 3O seconds to leave before my angry uncle put a brick bat upside your head and makes your eyes crossed."" As for the sausage, sell 'em out of a hot water, hot dog stand. Common trash. Do the O'Mally's  live with the Vanderbilt's?RIBS: wash yo hands because they so good, you'll smack yo mama. Excellent dry rub that isn't too salty like 98 percent of ribs. Seriously slow cooked as they must be. How can one tell? Put your plastic silverware down and pick it up like you're supposed to. Hold it by one end. Does it seem top heavy because it leans and perhaps even cracks and breaks in two. Of great importance, of all meats ribs are the easiest to cheat on. From this point forward, look at the fat on the exterior and between bones. Should be about 2O percent max. Score 9BRISKET: For the most part, brisket is a fairly lean piece of meat. It is the toughest to tenderize because it's the thickest. If the middle is warm and moist with a black/brown, but not burned crust on top that is seasoned in a highly pleasing manner, someones doing something right. Here's a test for great seasoning. Scrape a little off with your knife and hold it on your tongue. Sure, salt is an ingredient, if it seems to be the largest ingredient, your eating at a poser's restaurant. I'm not a big brisket eater and often rely on what others say. I'd like to take my buddy Steve here once a week and order him brisket. It's the only time he don't constantly run that damn mouth of his. Score 8The sport of kings: Horse racing. The meat of his heirs: PULLED PORK. So Smoque, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. You and your pulled pork  can go toe-to-toe with anyone, anywhere, anytime. I admit, I was surprised and humbled by the people who would attempt such a dish above Interstate 4O. That stuff will make you want to fist fight a rude man just because everything else is right with the planet while enjoying meat that is of varying color which is normal. Yes, there can be a bit of grease. Guess what, take that away and you got beef jerky. It's like comparing a fillet with sirloin. Marbled means magnifique. Smoque's had less grease than any PP I've tasted. That means when the pork is pulled, they actually may discriminate against a few pieces. To come in Smoque's and not order PP is like going into Mike Ditka's and not eating the veal chop. The knowing chaps and chapettes  give each other a wink. All seven judges concur, even the contrarian Bulgarian judge. This PP is a 1O.* CORN BREAD preference is like having a bias for a Ford F-15 or a Chevy Silverado. Regardless, you should wear a bag on your head if you don't eat cornbread with your barbecue. That sounds mean, but it's true. I like CB slightly sweet and crumbly without pieces of corn which is just plain nasty. ** PEACH COBBLER has somehow become a custom at a barbecue joint. It's tough to pull off. Peach season is 1O weeks long and even then, why fool with fresh because your customers are used to, and want, what you have been serving. I'm addicted to sugar so I have to have desert. My peach cobbler provided the strongest memories of Smoque. The line was backed out the door. I sort of stuck my head over the stainless steel into the cutting area of the kitchen. I shouldn't have done it, but I asked the cook if there was a way to get desert  without going to the back of that line. In two seconds, he produced the peach cobbler and said to pay later. The peaches were a four. The warmth was an 8 and the crust was a shocking 1O. You'll never guess one of the ingredients of peach cobbler. Butter. Butter is a food group, but that's for another time. Loved the ladies and gents working throughout the restaurant. Pros. Thanks y'all. -ralph"
Bring comfy shoes. There's a line :o
"It's everything positive that anybody has ever said about this place. The menu is limited to what I can eat (not a pork eater). But here's what our table had on it:MEATS:- Brisket: 6 out of 5 Stars (I know 6? Yes it's that good)- Chicken: 4 out of 5 Starts (Juicy, but too smoky for me)SIDES:- Coleslaw: 5 out of 5 (Vinegar based dressing)- Mac-N-Cheese: 5 out of 5 (Just awesome)- Fries: 5 out 5 (Homestyle Fries)- Cornbread: 4 out of 5I guess the great thing here is when I am in the mood for GREAT BRISKET I'll need to make the 45 minute trip to Smoque, YES IT'S WORTH THE DRIVE!!!!"
"The brisket is soooo good - and the sauce that goes with it.  It's is pretty expensive for what you get - so I don't go here at often as I would like (and the sides are tiny), but if you know that going you'll never be disappointed. Oh - unless you want a can of Coke - then they will charge you $1.69 and that IS a rip off. :)"
"Great BBQ in the city.  The ribs are excellent as is the brisket. Cool atmosphere especially when its warm out.  The sides are equally as tasty, especially the mac n' cheese.  If you have a hankering for bbq served on paper (the best kind!) then this is the spot you definitely should consider.  No non-sense BBQ, just quality smoked meat."
"Delicious BBQ in a low maintenance environment. It's also BYOB. Go early, because they often sell out before closing time."
"Now I have two favorite BBQ joints in Chicagoland. When I'm on the North side it will definitely be Smoque again.Let's start with the meats. I had the Rib Combo (both Baby Back and St. Louis). They were cooked to perfection. As a BBQ Judge I have become very spoiled with perfect ribs, and these are perfect ribs. The meat comes cleanly off the bone where you bite, but it does not ""fall off the bone"" when you take a bite. The bone dries immediately. That's a perfectly cooked rib. As for flavor, it was fabulous. I asked for the sauce on the side so that I could taste the meat, and it was heavenly. I added some sauce and it just made me happy. Both the Baby Back and the St. Louis ribs are awesome. My wife had the sliced Brisket. It, too was awesome. Just a little on the dry side, but nothing to complain about. She, too, had the sauce on the side, and if they would have put the sauce on the meat, it would have been perfect. The sides are great. We had Mac n' Cheese, Brisket Chili and Cornbread. The Slaw comes with the meal, too. They were all awesome. Mac n' Cheese was very cheesy, creamy, and not overcooked like many establishments. The Brisket Chili is almost as good as mine (seriously that is awesome Chili). Heavy on the Brisket, light on the beans. The Cornbread was sweet and moist, and delicious. And now the Slaw. Normally I like creamy Slaw, but this Slaw was fabulous. Sweet vinegar with red onions and cabbage. Simple, and simply divine. One thing I really like about both of my favorite 'Que places in town is the fact that the owners take an interest in the customers. Barry was out working the crowd, he apologized when our meal was taking a little longer than he liked. He followed up with everyone in the place, and when I asked for a little Pulled Pork to go, he got me some. All in all it was a very great visit.Now to that Pulled Pork. We live about 45 minutes away, so I knew the pork would be cold, but oh, how heavenly. The perfect amount of smoke, still very juicy, and tender. Again, not overcooked. Oh, and Saturday night at 5:00 in the rain didn't deter anyone. The place was packed. I will be back.I will definitely be back."
We went here for my husband's birthday.  He was craving a smoked meat smorgasbord and Smoque delivered!  We knew it was going to be a success when we could smell the deliciousness as we walked down the street.  What a fabulous greeting! We ordered almost everything on the menu and definitely tried every side dish available.  We split everything four ways and there was still leftovers.My favorite was the pulled pork and my husband loved the ribs.  We would definitely go back!
"Best BBQ on Chicago area, without a doubt!    Brisket is like butter in your mouth...."
"CAUTION:  Most of the BBQ in the 312 = Garbage!If you have been blessed to have enjoyed REAL BBQ (i.e., Memphis, KC, TX, East Carolina, Georgia), and you live in Chicago - Go. To. Smoque. Now.The meats are what really stand out here.  I recommend the BabyBack Ribs and the Pulled Pork.  Sides are good, but not great.  I'm partial to the beans (hard to mess up), cole slaw (vinegar blend, excellent), and fries (I'm not supposed to eat these).The macNcheese side really let me down.  It tasted like the type of mac that you'd see offered in the ""premium"" frozen entrees at Dominicks/Safeway - whoaFYI, this is a BYO spot - Cheers."
"This is one of those places I've never written a review for, because they don't really need it- there's always a line out the door, and the prices are fair. Free parking in the back is convenient. The brisket is solid, the mac and cheese is where it's at, and it's BYOB. Duh."
I've been here 3-4 times and I like it. their mac n cheese and corn muffins is delish!
"Wow. Good to the last bite, our party scraped off every bit of food off of our plates.Some Tips:Don't be scared of the lines, I don't know how it works but by the time you get up there to order, and by the time your food actually arrives, tables magically open up and you have a place to sit.  Don't question the logistics, it just works. :)Don't share the cobblers. It will just cause discord among your party.  There are some things that shouldn't be shared.  Don't skimp and go a la carte.  Well worth the few extra bucks for the sides.  Lastly - their french fries are tasty.  A nice surprise as I don't usually expect to get good fries with my bbq.Oh and almost forgot, but the staff is extremely friendly.  I don't need good service if your food is as good as this, but the helpful staff was just bonus!"
"This was hands down the best BBQ I have had outside of Kansas City and St.Louis. The place is very small and the seating is communal. This just adds to the appeal of the restaurant. The only complaint I will make is not about the food or experience, but the parking. Since it is in a neighborhood the parking is mostly residential and difficult to find. However, they do provide a map that shows where available parking is. My best suggestion is to take to train and save yourself the hassle. My wife and I ordered the brisket, pulled pork, and we added a 1/4 rack of ribs for around six dollars. The service was relatively quick for a place that was without an open seat. The brisket was very moist and had extremely good flavor. The pulled pork was equally good and the cooks definitely make sure to let the meat stay the focus point of the meal. The ribs were fall off the bone delectable! The sauces were not very special but we're not necessary due to how well the meat was done. The sides were exceptional especially the baked beans. They are made with the leftover brisket and could sit alone as a meal themselves."
This place is great!  Best BBQ in town.
Delicious. Try the mac and cheese.Be warned: small portions for the sides. Pork Shoppe is better in this regard. Wait times for orders on weekends can sometimes be long.
"Smoque is very, very good.  I mean this in the best way possible, we could have been in St. Louis or even KC.  I think brisket is a hard but to pull off well, but the Smoque version was quite good.  My wife is a pulled pork fan and she liked (but didn't love) her meal.  The side dishes were the perfect complement to the meal; in particular, the mac & cheese was tops.If you want very good BBQ in Chicago in a casual atmosphere (which I how I think BBQ should be served), then Smoque is for you."
"Best BBQ I have ever had.  Brisket (both chopped and sliced) is super flavorful and tender.Fries and mac and cheese are outstanding.  Cornbread, beans and chili are good.Highly recommend.  I have never waited more than a few minutes, with the exception of a Saturday night I went and waited 45ish minutes.  I would recommend avoiding going during the Saturday night dinner rush."
"This place features some of the best BBQ around.  Tried the brisket, which was very soft and smokey.  It was good, but not great.  The meat was just a little bland for me and I found myself drenching it in bbq sauce, which I don't usually do.  The ribs however, were really good.  I tried both the St. Louis and baby back ribs.  I personally prefer St Louis because the fat content is higher and thus it's a safer bet to be less dry.  Sure enough, I did enjoy the St Louis a little more, but both had good smoke and flavor.I personally wish the sauce had a little more kick, but that's more of a personal preference.  The sides, especially the peach cobbler was ridiculously good!  The crust on that cobbler... wow.  Next time, I may just get a double order of peach cobbler.   Mac and Cheese were good, as were the beans.  The coleslaw was meh to me, but I've never been too big of a coleslaw fan.  Overall, a good bbq joint.  Definitely give this place a try if in the area."
Still Smoqin' it's been a while since I have been here but I think the slaw has gotten better. Tried and loved the corn bread. Spicy sauce is the way to go on the sliced brisket. The brisket a little dry this visit maybe because it was Sunday. Fries still rock but the baked beans are way to sweet for me. They had my pancreas doing back flips.
"There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said already.  Truly as good as it gets, whether it's the brisket, or even the chicken."
Pretty decent BBQ. Long waits and parking lot is crammed and hard to get in and out.Pulled Pork is good with spice.
Best brisket in the city!
"Smoque is as close to TX Barbecue as you can get outside of Texas. Living in Austin,  I would frequent Franklin BBQ monthly, Stiles Switch weekly and sprinkle in trips to Lockhart, Louie Mueller and Snow's on a regular basis.  Smoque could hold its own with many of the Central Texas places.Their brisket exceeded my expectations.  I would say its probably in my top 10 favorite briskets I've had.   The fat was rendered perfectly and it had a great bark with perfect seasoning.    While there I the pleasure of talking to Barry one of the owners and he was very friendly and it was obvious he loves bbq and knows what good bbq is. If you are in Chicago this is a must.   Forgot to mention the sauce, I enjoyed it but sauce != BBQ and should not be how you judge a BBQ joint.   MEAT and only meat = BBQ.  If you go to a BBQ joint and leave talking about their sauce, they have failed and well so have you."
Not exactly an expert on bbq being from the east coast.  I actually never wanted to have it because the few times I went to random places they were gross.  I went to Smoque w a friend who raved about it and he was correct.  The food was excellent.  I've been back numerous times and the brisket and pulled pork are my favorites.
Surprisingly hard to come by really good BBQ in a city like Chicago but this is one of the few places.If you like this I would recommend Twin Anchor and Smoke Daddy- same goes in reverse.
Baby back and St. Louis style ribs so good you don't even need bbq sauce!
it's nice. nothing like super amazing great but it's definitely not bad bbq and you get your money's worth. plus they have nice soda and stuff and it's a pretty friendly atmosphere
I recently visited Smoque with my daughter and we bothe loved the place! My daughter had the ribs and judging by the bones left on the tray and the lack of conversation during the meal I can only assume she loved them. I had the chopped barbeque brisket and I have to say it was fantastic. I highly recommend smoque the food and the atmosphere is fantastic..
"I agree with most of the reviews.  As of late July 2013, the barbeque is still one of the best in the city.  The price is fair and the staff is friendly.  If you like barbeque, you should check it out!"
"We stopped in and they had plenty of food left.  It was near closing.  Chicago is not known for BBQ and so I don't expect the locals to have a good understanding of what is good BBQ.  This was just OK BBQ.  I've had BBQ all over the country.  Again, this was just OK.  Probably a good choice while in Chicago but yeah.....Brisket was over done and fell apart.  Brisket should not fall apart.  They offer sliced and chopped.  They only difference was that it was served from different parts of the brisket.  Same texture no matter what.  There was next to no smoke.  A classic problem of many amateur BBQ cooks.  I asked what kind of cookers they were using having already known the answer based on the taste in my mind.  Southern Prides.  I have yet to have great BBQ cooked on southern prides all have the same kind of smoke register.  Little to no smoke ring, also a sign of an electric cooker, who knows. Bottom line was that the brisket was unimpressive and reminded me of pot roast.The ribs were better than the brisket but not by much.  They were also over done. Meat fell right off the bone, however, this is a sign of an overdone rib. Flavor was decent.  Sausage tasted like Hillshire Farms.  Nothing special at all. At the end of the day it was ok, just ok.  It satisfied my craving for BBQ but barely.Service was good.  The best part of this to me was the atmosphere.  This is what BBQ is about.  Communal seating, basic eatery, done right."
"I'm having a hard time knowing where to start. Their ribs are excellent. I RARELY eat a whole rack, but I've done it here. They also smoke their brisket to perfection. The cornbread is just awesome. The right amount of moisture (most cornbread is too dry), and slightly crumbly. Peach cobbler is probably the 2nd best I've tried, and really, really good. My son is a picky eater but he loved their mac and cheese.They're very busy for a reason. Some nights the line goes out the door. We've actually walked away once because it's torture if you're hungry. The food is so good, you can smell it, and you'll have to wait for it!"
"I got carry-out from this place for a sunday night bears game.The wait was pretty long both on the phone and then for our pick up time.The staff was very nice and helpful and I was in and out quickly with my food.Since I got carry out I can not accurately declare how great their food was but I got a pretty good idea.I got the brisket and the St. Louis style ribs with the BBQ beans, coleslaw, and french fries as sides.The fries were a little soggy but that's probably because it was raining and it was carry out with a 20 minute drive home. The beans were delicious but extremely small in quantity, especially compared to the size of the fries, same for the coleslaw. I really with I got half the amount of fries and at least 50% more coleslaw and beans.I thought the ribs were good and the sauce that went along with them was not bad but a little sweet for my taste, I like a spicier BBQ sauce with a good kick.The brisket I was a little disappointed with. It's my favorite BBQ food and theirs was somewhat dry and I didn't really taste the rub. The sauce for the brisket was very watery compared to the ribs sauce and I did not like that since it soaked into the bread very quickly and didn't stick to the meat as much as I would have liked."
"Brisket and pulled pork are good, but the ribs are heavenly. They use 11 spices in their rub to form the most amazing outer crust. Side bbq sauce is on point with champion bbq. If you like chili, the brisket chili will not dissapoint. Prices are pretty darn good (sandwiches $7, includes delicious slaw). A full slab of ribs is $17 (you'd pay $20 at famous daves). It does get crowded, but usually in spurts (not constant), but they have a very efficient system (one cashier, bunch of guys cooking, and they line the orders up on the counter). Even though seating can feel a little cramped, it's not bad considering the size of the building.If your still not convinced, watch the ""diners drive-ins and dives"" episode on youtube, the owner did his homework (traveled through austin and memphis to learn from the pros). If your anywhere near chicago, I can't recommend this restaurant enough."
"Recently got my birthday party catered from this place as it was recommended by the venue (Revolution Brewery Tap Room).  Got pulled pork, chicken, cornbread, mac & cheese, and beans.  Everyone LOVED it.  Service was prompt and great as well."
"Best place for Ribs and Chili in Chicago. We have been fans and hooked on these Ribs since we first saw the Guy F. from Tripple D air it on the food network. The Ribs, fries, chili, corn bread, etc. it's all good. Don't get me started on the peach cobbler, its heaven to your taste buds. We went to honky tonk, daddy's in humbold park and famous dave's but let me tell you people, Don't waste your time going elsewhere, stick to smoke, Better quality, taste, BETTER PORTIONS are done at SMOQUE. Please go on empty stomach to enjoy your food, works for me.I always take a quart of Chili for later in the night and another peach cobler, can't get enough of it. Try the spicy sauce to take home and added to your grilled chicken, its too bad that they dont offer it at the restaurant to have rather than the regular sause( the regular sause is till good)."
this bbq place is really good. the briskets are tender and sooooo good. the macoroni is to die for. They are also good for large groups or corporate events. the prices are resonable and the customer service is great.
"The typically long lines attest to the excellence of the food that awaits inside.  The beef brisket can be ordered as a sandwich or a meal, either way it's fabulous.  The side dishes are a must have:  mac and cheese and for dessert the peach cobbler.  I just wish the portions were larger because they're so incredibly delicious.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The BBQ sauces are excellent and perfect consistency, not too thin or too thick.   Parking can be a pain, but once you find a spot, you're in for a treat."
"BBQ is huge in my family. The talent is high enough that I don't go to Chicago BBQ restaurants, they just can't make the cut. Smoque is the only place that can do ribs/sandwiches on par with my old man. If Memphis style, dry rub, lightly sauced with good, slow cooked smokey flavor is your style, this is the spot."
"WOW Your reviews enticed me! I live 30 minutes away. I drove 30 minutes to get there. It took me 15 minutes to find parking. I found parking. Took me 5 minutes to walk to the front. I waited in the front for 30 minutes. 30 minutes we got to the door. We opened the door to be in another line to be seated. We stayed in this other line for 20 minutes. 20 minutes we placed our order (we ordered everything, taste portions). We were immediately seated outside and waited 15 minutes for our food. We sat down and started chowing down. We finished in 30 minutes. In that 30 minutes there was a lot of drool, ""mmmhmmm-ing"", and pointing at the great stuff we just stuffed our mouths with. EVERYTHING was delicious. Who the f* cares how long the wait was! IT WAS WELL WORTH IT! I'd do it again, as long as it isn't 90 degree weather like it was that one day I went."
"My first time at Smoque with my wife and two teenage sons. I was really looking forward to trying a few things out after hearing so many positive reviews. We ordered a full slab of St Louis ribs, chopped beef sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich. We arrived early, probably around 4:30 and the tables were already full with a line of people still waiting to order. I was worried we wouldn't be able to sit but as soon as we got in line an employee asked if we needed a table and reassured us one would be ready as soon as we had our food. Another concern I had was that I didn't pick up any of that sweet hickory smoke in the air that I would expect at a real BBQ joint.The wait wasn't bad and we did get the table as promised. Now to the food. I really appreciate good BBQ and the exterior appearance of the ribs was excellent. Upon cutting the bones apart however there was no pink smoke ring at all. The meat was gray. That was pretty disappointing. Although the ribs looked good and smoked from the dark brown/black exterior, they really lacked the soul of a true BBQ rib. The meat was tender and fairly juicy so not a total disappointment.My wife had a chopped beef brisket sandwich, which was also good but not great. My 18 year old son had a pulled pork sandwich which he said was as good as the ones I make at home. That's either a stellar endorsement or a slap in the face.The sides were the fresh cut fries, the best of the sides, cole slaw, which had way to much onion in it, mac and cheese, which was also good but not great, and the beans which were a close second to the fries.Overall I'd rate our meal at 2.5 stars based on the service. Would I run back? No, I'm still looking for the best BBQ in Chicago."
Hands down the best BBQ in Chicago.
Best Brisket in Chicago and worth the visit!
"When I go to a place that has been hyped this much, I tend to be disappointed. That was definitely not the case when I went to Smoque. Here's how it stacked up.-Brisket: delicious and not too fatty/greasy. Order chopped if you like the crispy burnt ends-Pulled pork: Some of the juiciest, most tender pork I have ever had. Even without sauce it was moist. Even better with a little Carolina style barbeque sauce which they do so well. -St. Louis Ribs: Incredibly meaty. Usually I don't like ribs very much because they are too greasy and fatty. Smoque uses a dry rub which is delicious and the ribs are very lean.-Mac & Cheese: Indulgently rich, with a nice crunchy topping of bread crumbs.-Baked beans: The best baked beans I've had in a long time. Little bits of brisket and heavy smoke flavor are balanced by the deep sweetness of caramelized sugars.-Brisket chili: This is the only item I tried that was not amazing. Not to say it was bad, it just wasn't as good as everything else. Next time I visit, I will opt for something else.Overall, this place is awesome and worth all the hype, and then some. I highly suggest you visit if you're in the area. It is also very reasonable for all of the high quality food you get."
Loved the brisket. It is so yummilicious that one might lose control. The coleslaw it is paired with is really good. I will most definitely go back. Tough to find a place that can do better justice with the brisket.
"Best brisket I have ever tasted.  Their brisket is now my gauge on other briskets and I have not tasted one that comes remotely close.  Don't me wrong, all the food is incredible. From their individual mac n cheese to their sandwiches, it is all amazing but all I can say is their brisket is to die for.Now I want some of their brisket."
"The dine-in atmosphere leaves something to be desired, but take it To Go and enjoy!  Great bar-b-q, delicious sausages.  If you time it correctly you can take the blue line to Irving Park, pick up your food and catch your homebound train."
Best brisket I've ever eaten. 'Nuff said.
"Great food... atmosphere... not so much.We took my BIL here for his bday. We love to pick BBQ places (notice my review on Lillie's Q). Hubby and BIL had ribs. My other BIL and I had brisket. We all enjoyed what we ordered. The brisket is to die for! I saw complaints about the BBQ sauce on some yelp reviews, but I loved it. The cole slaw was nothing special. Corn bread and baked beans were tasty. The guys all had mac n cheese. They all liked it. It's BYOB so we brought wine and beer. They only have plastic cups. So if you want to drink you wine out of a glass... bring one along :-/We loved the food, the neighborhood (parking was easy at 5:30pm on a Saturday), and the staff. They were the friendliest bunch of folks!They do not get 5 stars because it is basically a fast food joint. You come in, get in line to order, they find you a table, then you have to go get your food when they yell your number. AND they have screaming kids, just like any other fast food place. (OK... so we could have gone later in the evening to avoid the screaming kids.)But I would go here any day before I would step anywhere near Lillie's Q ever again!"
One of the best BBQ places in the city. Highly recommend!
Was Ok
Great
Yummy.

"This is a very good BBQ place.  I've been to Memphis and this would do some damage there.  Not my #1 place , but I think I'm secure to say this is my second favorite BBQ place.  Get the brisket (I got the sliced).  It's very tasty.  I can't tell you which sauce to taste.  You should try them all. The downfall was the sides honestly.  The cornbread wasn't very good.  The Mac and Cheese was ok.  I've had a lot better.  Fries were ok.  I think you should just get the platter a la Carte option versus 2.  You'll concentrate on the meat anyways."
"Traditional great BBQ, took their carrier out, was hot and ready to go, they gave plenty of sauce. The food speaks for it self. fantastic"
"I've not had any better BBQ in Chicago. I recommend the Pulled Pork, BBQ Beans and the Brisket Chili. The sauce is phenomenal."
Love the BBQ ribs they have here soo good and a little messy but its worth it
"Just awesome, I don't know what else to say...pulled pork! Mac n cheese! Slaw! Cobbler! It's better than being back home in TN"
This place makes me cheat on being vegetarian.
"As a lifelong Chicagoan my idea of BBQ is different than down south, but I'm definitely the type to get up to my elbows in sauce without shame.  As I was about 75 feet from the entrance the aroma of BBQ hit me and got a big OMG.  I got the chopped brisket platter with two sides, a taste portion of St. Louis ribs, and peach cobbler.  Here's the breakdown:chopped brisket - Smoky, but not excessively so (I had a bad experience elsewhere where everything just tasted like smoke and was awful).  It's flavorful and very moist.  The portion is quite generous.  They give you a cup of sauce on the side, which I think needs work, as it's entirely sweet with no savory or smoky element.St. Louis ribs - All my life I've eaten sticky, sweet baby backs, so this took a little getting used to.  The ribs are huge and meaty, with a nice thick layer of bark from the dry rub they use.  The meat itself is just firm enough to sink your teeth into, with a little effort needed to pull it away from the bone.  Eating ribs is meant to be a carnal experience, and Smoque does it exactly right.  When someone advertises ribs as ""fall off the bone good"", give them a scowl and walk away.  It was hard to get used to ribs that are entirely savory rather than sweet, and for personal taste I still prefer baby backs, but on their own merits these are quite good.  I just don't think I'd want a whole slab of them.BBQ beans - That's what they're called and that's what they taste like.  This is not the thick, dark brown baked beans.  These are beans with sauteed onions and a pronounced BBQ flavor, and are tasty.corn bread - It comes baked in an individual aluminum foil cup and is moist, flavorful and has some whole corn kernels inside.  I'm not generally a big corn bread fan but I'd order this every time.cole slaw - As someone who loathes mayonnaise, I generally give or throw away cole slaw, but this is actually good and I ate it all.  As others have said, it doesn't have mayo and instead has a tangy flavor that made me think of Italian dressing.peach cobbler - Scorching hot from the oven, and as good as any I've had.  This will also be a staple each time I return.I got enough food to be stuffed, with enough brisket left over to make a sandwich the next day, and the grand total was about $20.  I'll go back to try the sausage and the chicken.  BTW, I went right as they opened at 11 on a Saturday and got street parking and a table very easily.  Service was prompt and friendly as everyone has said."
The beef brisket is something to tell your friends about. It was so tender my butter knife cut the brisket with ease. The only downside is the close eating quarters.
Simply Amazing
"Ohh get here early on Saturday and beat the line which can and does go down the block! If your picking up, call ahead...shorter line for pick up. The food, BBQ, is outstanding! The brisket here is just awesome and sometimes there's a brisket chili which just rocks. The pull pork is so good, you'll feel that they didn't give you enough and you'll want more. The ribs are good, but they're smoked, most people are use to local restaurant ribs that are baked or boiled drowning in sauce...not here. Two styles of ribs, both very good. The side are tasty ...I really dig the Mac n cheese and peach cobbler thing a am jig. The place is small, but the staff I'd awesome and will help everyone get a seat, clean place to eat, and napkins. Weekends I drive down a block and park in front of the school, free and plenty of parking...walk the block and you are in BBQ paradise."
"As someone who has lived in North Carolina, Kansas City, and Oklahoma and has spent considerable time in Texas, Memphis, and other BBQ immersed areas, I would say that Smoque is average at best. I honestly don't get the hype? I'm definitely not saying that it's not worth eating, I just think we need to be honest about the quality of the product."
"Superb BBQ.  We get dinner here (carry-out) every couple of months.  The food is incredible and here's a recommendation that I am surprised and happy to report....they have a fantastic salad!  The one thing I don't like about BBQ places is they tend to be rather unhealthy.  The salad sounds like an after thought (romaine, sunflower weeds, some cukes, some sun-dried tomatoes) but it's a simple salad and the vinagrette dressing is so delicious.  Sometimes I stop in just for that salad."
"Not a huge BBQ fan, but it was good!"
"I love this place. Although it's been crowded every time I've been there, the staff is really good about helping move the line along and finding people places to sit.The ribs are outstanding and I like that you can add small portions of some of the dishes to your order. I would like them to add another vegetable side option, though, like collard greens or green beans."
"Smoque actually catered our wedding back in November. While we had our own helpers to serve the food, the catering staff was very thorough and easy to communicate with and the food was dropped off with chafing dishes, etc on time. The cost was very reasonable for 215 people! We ended up ordering brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and salad.  People really loved it. Even a few months later, we still get many compliments of using Smoque as our caterer. Would definitely recommend!!"
"Went to Smoque this weekend with some friends and had a pretty good experience. The ribs were cooked perfectly albeit a little on the bony side. The mac and cheese was sharp and delicious. Fries were perfectly cooked and a huge portion. Peach cobbler was also very good.Overall, a good experience but I think for the size the sides are a little on the pricey side.Service was very good and the wait for food was very reasonable.Only negative was the cole slaw, it was just basically shredded cabbage had no real flavor to it. That was disappointing since the coleslaw can really be a great addition to your meal. All in all a good experience and would try again."
"You WILL get a seat - I promise. I know the line is out the door, I know every table is full - but trust me - they will get you a seat. While you are waiting in line to order, these guys (I call them air traffic controllers) will come to you and ask how many people you have. While you are ordering, they will find you a table. This is one of the most important things to remember, because the line out the door will really put off first timers - but you will get a table. The inside is very casual, quasi-communal eating. The noise level is a bit high and the amount of people can at times become overwhelming...but you will get a seat! When your meal is done though, don't linger...eat and then move on to whatever else is on your docket for the night.Now - the food....Chicago is not known for its BBQ and BBQ - especially good BBQ - is hard to find. I am not an expert, but I have had Corky's BBQ from Memphis before, so that is what I compare against. The food at Smoque is excellent.I have had the baby back ribs - they are excellent. They come with a dry rub which is very flavorful (sauce on the side)...the meat has that ""pink"" coloring that comes from a good smoking. The sauce on the side is pretty good...a little less sweet than I am used to, but still very good.The Texas sausage is excellent - really recommend itThe coleslaw that comes with every meat meal is very fresh and vinegar based, not mayo - it is cool and refreshingThe Mac & Cheese is very good - I usually like the idea of Mac & Cheese, but am always under whelmed - these folks do a really good job of it thoughI have never tried the place for take away, but I bet you that is really the way to do it - and there are a lot of people coming in to pick up orders. Overall though...this is excellent for BBQ!!!"
Yummy to my Tummy!My boyfriend and I went here while waiting for my car to get repaired at a nearby shop and WOWSERS!  This food is the BEST EVER!  The meat melted in my mouth.  No teeth needed.  YUMMMMMYYY!!!  Must. Stop. Talking. About. It.  I'm getting SOOO hungry for this BBQ!!!Yummmmmmyyyy!!!!
Smoque BBQ catered a big party for me and it was a total hit. The food was fantastic and   they came and set everything up. The Brisket was amazing and was so tender and yummy. The ribs were fantastic and you also get a few different BBQ sauces. The sides were incredible too and wonderful mac and cheese. Everyone that loves BBQ needs to go to Smoque.   Thanks for making our big party a giant success. :)
"I am from Texas and I have to say, this is GREAT BBQ. I cannot believe there is this hidden gem in Chicago, amazing. I ordered the baby back ribs and the briskets, which was recommended by AL, one of the employees. I also had the mac and cheese, and the cole slaw, both excellent. The cole slaw has a really lite vinaigrette dressing and it goes so well with everything since some things are quite heavy. The meats were absolutely moist and smokey and it's out of this world. I have no idea why anyone would complain about this restaurant. Also, they may not tell you but you should ask for the pickled jalapenos, those are so yummy, especially if you put it with your mac and cheese, weird combo but DELICIOUS. I have to say this will be a place to visit next time i'm in Chicago."
I love this place.this is one of the best place if you love BBQ.
"I've gone to Smoque on quite a few occasions and I can't say that I was disappointed in any of my experiences with Smoque themselves, just with my decisions.  The first time that I went to Smoque I decided on the baby-back ribs because that's what I'm used to.  Don't do that. Not that they aren't good, they're great.  But another of my family members got the St. Louis style ribs and I haven't steered clear of them since!! The St. Louis style ribs are just as tender and wayyyyy meatier.  You also cannot go wrong with the brisket at Smoque, they do a really good job, so be sure to get yourself some ribs with a ""taste"" of their brisket.  Don't forget some sides either, I'm a huuuuuge fan of their mac and cheese and baked beans! I know baked beans aren't for everybody, but these are really great!!  If you're a fan of BBQ, like myself, definitely give this place a try.  It's hard for me to decipher which I like best between Smoque, Honky Tonk, and Fat Willy's, but I think Smoque just does good BBQ with no gimmicks or games.  OH! I forgot to mention! There always seems to be an owner of Smoque walking around, pitching in and making sure that you're satisfied!! That is huuuuuge to me, it really shows me that they care about what they're doing at Smoque. Great food and great customer service, all the makings of a fine establishment!"
"I had pretty high expectations coming here, and I wasn't disappointed.  The line was rather long when we arrived (I came with a group of five at 7pm on a Saturday), but it moved quickly--I think we waited about 30 minutes to place our order, and then the food came out another 15 minutes after that.  I was slightly worried that my group wouldn't get to sit together, but the staff was really efficient at seating everyone at the long, family-style tables.I had the sliced brisket, which was very tender and delicious--I would definitely recommend it!  You get to choose two sides with the entree (standard bbq sides: baked beans, corn bread, , mac 'n cheese, etc.), plus the coleslaw.  If you like BBQ, this is definitely a place to check out!"
"Hot Damn!!!!! Hands down best BBQ I've had!! When you see a line out the door you know your in the right spot. I had the sliced brisket sandwich,Mac and cheese side with a taste of the ribs..... A day later I'm writing this review and my mouth is watering. Please don't let the lack if parking and long lines deter you, you will regret it!!!"
"This place was so hyped up for me that I was slightly disappointed. My friend and I came here for Sunday dinner and he basically ordered every meat off the menu except for the brisket, which I ordered.Pulled pork- He thought it was amazing, 5 stars. I thought it was alright.Baby Back Ribs- It was a dry rub and there just wasn't enough meat on there for me, he agreed.St. Louis Ribs- This had more meat than the baby backs, and the sauce was better.Sliced Brisket- Now this was GOOD! It melts in your mouth and the owner was walking around and asked if I liked heat. I love heat and he offered me a different BBQ sauce that was spicy and delicious! That was definitely my favorite combo. Mac and Cheese- It was kind of dry, but decent.Beans- Way too sweet.Cornbread- I'd skip it, nothing special there.Peach Cobbler- The crust was AMAZING, but the peaches were too tart and a little hard.All in all if you go here I recommend the brisket! I'm sure the brisket sandwich is perfection! Otherwise everything else is mediocre in my opinion. The owner is realllllly nice though!"
"great food and fast service! Tender meat,  sauce options were super tasty"
"I love this place. Its almost like being in the soup nazi  line the way you place your order then move quickly out of the way . The food is absolutely delicious. Pork smoked then smothered in wonderful sauce. It fulfills every excited taste bud . I enjoy the bun less meal, this makes tummy room to indulge in the sides. Each time I try something new. Amazing Great food plus  its fun to bring your own beer. Bringing your own beer just adds to the fun. Makes it seem like you're  a teen sneaking a drink. One of my favorite stops. If you go when the line is out the door don't despair it moves quickly. Well worth the wait."
"I won't go into a lot of detail other than to say that Smoque is the real deal and worth the wait.  Here's what I tried with comments:Brisket - great flavor, melt in your mouth although just a tad fatty (4 stars)Pulled pork - terrific, one of the best I've had (5 stars)Baby Back ribs - Wow!  You've GOT to try their ribs.  Great smoke ring, smokey flavor, meaty and juicy (5 stars)Mac and cheese - some of the best that I've had (Only gets 4 stars because the cup is so darn puny)Cole Slaw - nice vinegar rendition (4 stars)Great BBQ!"
did not care for this one had hard time with to many choices . but over all was good
"I'm from KC and moved her from Dallas so I'm a bit of a barbeque snob, so trust me when I say SMOQUE HAS THE BEST BBQ IN CHICAGO!That's it.  My entire review."
"I came here years ago, I think the first place I ate in Chicago when I didn't know anything about the food scene here. We tried a little bit of everything, and it good, no frills. I think I remember not being too crazy about the sides/desserts though."
It's ok at best. Not worth the hype. The sides are great and the rubs are adequate. Not worth more than a 5 minute wait in my book.
"Probably the best BBQ in Chicago. I moved to Glenview 2 years ago and still drive to the city for BBQ. Awesome brisket, Barry!"
"Try anything and everything, best barbeque in the city of Chicago. Buy a bottle of sauce when you are there, you won't regret it."
This truly is a hidden gem in Northwest Indiana.  Certainly worth checking out.  I was pleasantly surprised.
"Everyone loves this place and it is warranted. After eating here since it first opened I finally got a 1/2 rack of the St. Louis style ribs and was not disappointed. The biggest tip I can give for this place is to either go at 11:30AM or 1:30PM, the seating is very tight and you need to experience the food....not be stressing over where you are going to sit. They do a very good job of getting you in and out, but even when you are eating there during the lunch rush you feel those eyes glaring at you to wolf down your meal so that they can have a place to sit. Better to go when you have a little leeway with your lunch hour and you aren't in a rush, I guarantee you will be back. Typically when you cater from there they don't have fries on the menu because they don't travel very well, but if you are close you should order the fries for sure they are amazing, and if you are eating in they are a must. It just isn't about the beef and pork people....they have amazing bbq chicken as well, so don't pass it up."
"There is nothing, nothing, no-thing on this menu that will not leave you wanting more. This is the quintessential BBQ place and they have perfected their craft to be an art form."
"Chicago is a phenomenal food city. I have been here just under a year and am amazed at all the variety. I have sandwich places, gyro places, dozens of pizza places, Indian, Italian, everything, the only genre missing, or at least left undiscovered by me, was BBQ. I went to Smoque and loved it. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich, but recommend people head here in groups so you can have a sample of the brisket, the pulled pork, and the ribs. Mac-n-cheese, baked beans, french fries, all great. They even made cole slaw taste good.Going to continue to look for Chicago BBQ joints, would love recommendations."
"This place is unbeatable!  The food is great and so is the staff! My favorite would be the chopped brisket platter with the slaw and 2 sides of my choice. The prices are very reasonable especially for the amount of food you receive and the delicious taste. Whenever my family that lives out of state comes to visit me, we always end up coming here. They share the same opinion about this restaurant as I do and I think it is very worth giving it a try!  They also cater, which is amazing! I used this service when I was throwing a surprise birthday party for my mother. The man arrived just on time, the food was hot, everything I ordered was in place, I absolutely loved it! Everyone was amazed once again by the quality of the food! Do not hesitate to visit Smoque BBQ, very very very worth it! Like most people reviewing this place, I am giving it 5 stars. (5/5)"
"meh.it's not like I was jerkin it after I ate the meal.no big deal, just an average bbq joint.p.s. the beans are like sugar bombs, blech."
Wow - the best way to do this place is to order in.  The line is OOC but the food is great.  I recommend the cornbread and mac&cheese as sides.  The pulled pork is great.  The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because I had my first case of heartburn from this place!  It was horrendous.  But try it - it's delicious!
"I love you, Smoque.  I have loved you since you first opened and you have done nothing to dissuade me from buying your incredible bbq since that very first taste.  The BEST mac and cheese I've found, and that includes Mom's.  Every bbq item is better than the one before.  The portions aren't huge, but they're adequate.  The joint is a joint, but cleaner and better maintained than the one you might expect.  The service is fast and the sensory memories linger, whether you eat in or take out.  Yes, the weekend lines are long and the prices are just a little higher than you wish they were, but you are getting one of the three best bbq meals I've found in this city.  Just go there.  You'll be so happy you did!  God, I wish they delivered; I'd be eating their food once or twice a week without fail."
"Perfectly good BBQ if you don't mind sauce on the sweet side.  Doesn't live up to all the hype (but honestly who could?) and not worth waiting in the line out the door, but good for a visit if you catch them on a slow night."
"Best BBQ in Chicago, hands down! Service is always great - they're super friendly and will find seats for your whole party. Food highlights:Pulled Pork & Beef brisket - melts in your mouth! Peach cobbler: Crunchy crumbles on top of sweet&savory peach. Amazing and a must for one of your sides!French fries: huge portion so if you're with someone else, share this and get another side you both can share. Always hot and crispy.Coleslaw: Not your regular coleslaw drenched in mayo. This one's crunchy and refreshing with some sort of vinegar dressing. Yum!There's also limited parking in the backlot specifically for Smoque if you're driving but I've never had a problem finding street parking either. Definitely worth the trip."
"This was the best pulled pork that I ever ate! I'm in love with this place! I'm not a meat or BBQ lover but I have to admit that my meal was amazing!  I had pulled pork with fries, corn bread and coleslaw... It was terrific! The sauce is really good!My fiance tasted the St. Louis ribs and he loved too!I highly recommend this place!"
This place is amazing. Order the half chicken and you won't be disappointed.
Great food. Some of the better brisket I've ever had. I kind of prefer to order out from here. Not the biggest fan of the inside.
"Food Network, Fellow Yelpers, and various media outlets definitely blew smoke for Smoque. The inside leaves something to be desired, I get it it's a hole in the wall, but after many years of success you would think you would fix the chipping paint on the wall of awards. The seating is very tight and awkward, there's a host to sit you, but it seems like they love to sit people in awkward places. I felt like many of the employees were encroaching on people's personal spaces and the service leaves something to be desired-it's very much ""what do you want, ok, payment?, next"" and you're just a number here. We came here today during lunch time and it wasn't very packed. I have to just come out and say it that Guy Fieri you my friend are a liar, and I trusted you. You are paying roughly $11 for a sandwich the size of a big mac (in width, not in height), a ""fruit cup"" size of macaroni and cheese (and it is not ""dynamite, again Guy what the hell?), small piece of corn bread (that was actually good), and slaw. Did I feel ripped off? Absolutely. The pulled pork was extremely dry and didn't taste special and the brisket itself was good and really was the ""Star"" of the meal. Now to the sauce-we all know in the United States BBQ Sauce is a personal preference, kind of like underwear. I myself am not not not not not a fan of this BBQ sauce and neither was my fiance. It is definitely Kansas City BBQ Sauce and It was to me absolutely repulsive-very thin, very sweet, very vinegary. Overall after months of wanting to try this place and making a trip for lunch, insanely disappointing. So, if you're reading this and you love KC BBQ, then maybe you'll love this place...if you don't skip Smoque because it is awful for those of us who are not KC BBQ fans. Guy Fieri, you just lost some of my trust and I don't know how we're going to get back to that point in our relationship again."
Just not that into brisket. I am more of a rib person.
I think the BBQ is mediocre. The line was extremely long and we still waited for the food. It was worth the wait and it did not disappoint. It was good and i think it is unique in chicago.the pull pork is a must order item along with the peach pie and beans.
"Great BBQ, love the brisket and beans. Not the cheapest in town but not the priciest either."
"If there's better BBQ in this city, I certainly haven't found it yet.  Amazing ribs and brisket, and BYOB too."
Love Smoque. Been here for lunch three times. Lucky enough to go after the rush so no wait.  Last visit was 1:30 on a Sunday - got a table outside and had our meal in a very short wait.  Our highlights:Brisket Platter - VERY tender.  Slices melt in your mouth. Pulled Pork PlatterMac and CheeseBaked BeansBoth the regular and the hot sauce are great.  We don't order the sandwich options - prefer to have some leftovers.  Haven't ordered the chicken from Smoque since my own BBQ chicken is pretty good.
Best BBQ I've had in Chicago!!
"I spent the last two years living in Kansas City, a town known for BBQ, so I have unreasonably high standards for BBQ. That being said, Smoque is a great place for BBQ. I didn't give it 5 stars, however, because I felt the highlight of my meal was their sides, not so much their meats. I break it down below:Sides: The macaroni and cheese comes baked in a separate metal container. It was rich and cheesy, but not too heavy - certainly a must have. Don't skip the fries, baked beans, or cornbread - all delicious and certainly noteworthy. Most importantly, do yourself a favor and save room for their peach cobbler... holy shit.Meats: I tried the pulled pork and the sliced brisket and both were solid. Juicy, tender, and flavorful - great, but not amazing. I haven't tried their ribs or Texas sausage and I'll be sure to reevaluate this review when I do. Sauce: I enjoyed it - it was tangy with a hint of sweetness, though it was a bit on the runny side. Is it the best BBQ I've ever had? No, but you'll be hard pressed to find a better place in Chicago."
"My review will be so buried no one will ever read it. That said. its good, but its not the most amazing BBQ place in Chicago."
"Boom-Shaka-Laka!  I love great BBQ and Smoque does it like a boss!  We arrived starving on a Saturday night and as expected, there was a line starting to form out the door.  We ended up waiting only 30 minutes and since we had a bunch of beer in a mini icebox, it was all good.  All 8 of us luckily got a large table, only a few minutes after ordering.Their menu is written on a large chalkboard up on the wall.  As I was drooling over the menu, I was having a tough time deciding what to order.  I wanted to try everything, but was happy to see they had tasting portions of some items.I ended up ordering the Beef Brisket with a taste of some St. Louis Ribs.  The Beef Brisket was damn good.  Super moist, smokey black crust, thick cut, with great spice rub/BBQ sauce.  The brisket easily breaks apart with your fork and I was smiling with every bite.  The taste of ribs included a quarter slab, which was plenty as the St. Louis were meaty.  The ribs were fall off the bone tender and the smokey crisp crust has great flavor.  The sides didn't disappoint at all.  I loved the vinegary cole slaw, which went well with the smokey BBQ, but the mac & cheese was freakin awesome!  The side was just the right amount of mac and hot creamy cheese.  I also got the Peach Cobbler which was really good.  The sides were small, but with all the meat I thought it was just the right amount.I can't wait to go back for some more brisket and to try the other sides."
"I'm going to Chicago and I'm on a mission. Find amazing BBQ.Done. And Done!Our family members thankfully recommended Smoque. Wow! We are such carnivores so the menu was music to our eyes, or rather, our bellies.Brisket. Yes please. Ribs. Yes please.The service was great also. The guys helping us to a table, helping us fill water, etc. were extraordinarily helpful, and friendly. Good job guys - keep it up!Chicago beats Seattle in BBQ."
This place has the best Mac n cheese and brisket.  Don't go expecting to sit down though as this place is always packed!  Definitely worth the trek coming from lincoln park.
"I really love this place. The brisket is excellent. The sides are good too, but nothing can beat how tender and flavorfull the brisket is. Also, they have candied jalepenos which go great with the meats. Definitely the best BBQ place in chicagoland."
"Traveling through Chicago, saw DDD show that featured Smoque. We decided to stop, it was worth the wait. Would highly recommended this place."
I'm pretty sure that I am very lucky I live close to Smoque because I go here often. The food is absolutely delightful! The best brisket and ribs in Chicago that I have tried thus far! I would recommend this everyone! My 2 and 5 yr old love their food as well. After going in twice last week and at least a dozen other times I thought I might make a review! Great service and hospitality; even tho sometimes I don't know where to stand to wait for my carryout lol
"ok so Im sorry but I dont really get this place. i didnt like the food, at all. The meat was tender enough, but definitely didnt have the delish smokey flavour that one wants from bbq. The mac and cheese was rather insipid, the best that one can say for it is that it was browned and crispy on top and that made it worth while. oh and the ambience is rather diner-y, much like you would expect from 5 guys. Wont be coming back in a hurry"
Brisket is as smooth as butter. Seriously did not have to chew a piece of it. Would definitely like to come back and try more of the items on the menu. Only complaint was the house BBQ sauce was which super peppery.
"Go hungry, leave stuffed! We found out this place was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and with good reason. Best BBQ yet! Everything is fresh and delicious. If you're in town and want to have a great eating experience, go to Smoque!"
Bloody great
"Come one, come all, but please don't be the moron who turns on to Grace St and puts your hazards on in the middle of the road!I have the distinct pleasure and ""misfortune"" of living within walking distance of Smoque. I say misfortune because brisket and ribs are from the healthiest foods around and Smoque's are some of the best tasting around.After multiple visits to Smoque I have decided to write my review, concurring with the praise that litters their Yelp page. The bbq sauces are amazing, the brisket is amazing, the pulled pork is amazing, the ribs are amazing, but the chicken is only reliable.In summation... Don't be a bad driver, and come enjoy the best barbecue Chicago has to offer!"
"I was in the mood for some good BBQ while on my recent trip to Chicago. Oh My Goodness, this was some of the best food I have had. I got the Pulled pork with a side of baked beans and macaroni and cheese. Everything was delicious and it was very hard to find a suggestion for improvement. Order at the counter and the host will help you find a seat."
"Some friends and I went to Smoque last nite for dinner.  Boy!  Am I glad we did!  I've been searching for a BBQ place ever since I moved back to Chi over a year ago.  Now I've found it!Smoque served up some delicious briskets.  I got the brisket platter (half chopped, half sliced), cornbread, and peach cobbler with a taste of Texas sausage.  OMG!  The savory brisket melts in your mouth, especially the sliced brisket.  I much prefer the sliced over the chopped brisket.  The Texas Sausage was a little spicy and was perfectly grilled.  The peach cobbler, oh peach cobbler... was fantastic!  Sweet and sour and crunchy...  The flavors and texture just blends together so well in your mouth.  The cole slaw was good as well.  I like that it's not a creamy slaw (although I like that too).  But it's good the way they make it here!The restaurant was packed and with a group of 7 people, I had no hope of getting a table.  But magically they got a table big enough for 7 of us!  That's cool!  The guys who cleans and assign tables are cool!  Funny, courteous, and pleasant.  It's kinda nice to feel welcomed at a busy place like that.The only complaint I had was that some of the patrons would just sit there yapping away with their friends long after they've finished eating and their plates taken away.  Come on people!  Have some courtesy for your fellow hungry diners, and get your full-asses out of the restaurant so that other people can sit down.  It is ok to stand outside and talk.  It won't kill you...  Oh, I wish they'd convert the back parking lot into an outdoor patio. That would rock!!!I'll definitely be back for more brisket and cobbler at Smoque!!!"
"BBQ Brisket heaven. It's a 15-20 minute metro/subway ride from downtown Chicago, but very much worth it. For about $10 you get a main meat and two sides. The service and speed of order is excellent, though call ahead if you're late to see what meat they have left.Get the mac and cheese, it's amazing with the bread-crumb(like) flakes.The cold slaw is surprisingly refreshing and crispy too, but the beef chili side is really good and much more bang for your buck. The cornbread was average as always (and that's a compliment).Skip the cobbler though. The pulled pork isn't bad at all, it's just not nearly as the brisket. Same goes for the ribs, very plain and lacks flavor. skip it.Brisket it and you'll be happy."
love there bbq great service
Brisket sandwich and mac & cheese are the yummiest. Don't recommend the ribs tho.
"After hearing so many good things about this place (from friends and various TV shows) I was disappointed with my experience.  The food was OK but it tasted a lot like other BBQ that I've had (namely at a friend's house).  The place is cramped and there's some waiting if you come at peak times.  There's a lot of street parking available but it's sort of in the middle of no where, so plan on taking a bus."
"2 stars for Meh is exactly right.  It tastes more like just meat than smoke, if that makes sense.  I can do that in my crock pot.  Look, it's not bad.  It's just not that good.  And everything was so sweet.  I didn't really get any salt or spice out of anything."
"Perfection.  An absolute must try if you're in Chicago.The sides and peripheral items (chicken, sausage) are all excellent but get the ribs (both types if possible)--they are better than I ever thought ribs could be.  The sauce is also excellent but have a few with none at all, as the rub has plenty of flavor and is again just fantastic.  Every time I have been here--many, now--the preparation was flawless.It's not expensive but the reason is there's effectively no service and finding a table is a real pain, so come off peak if possible.  It's BYOB so bring something good (Brooklyn Local 1, perhaps?).Think about what barbecue ribs are.  You take a rather low quality cut of meat, season the heck out of it, and cook it at low temperatures for long enough to make it edible.  It's real easy to get any of those steps wrong and have it turn out really poorly.  It's really very difficult to get right every single time.  Smoque absolutely nails this, and has come up with an extremely well balanced rub and sauce to go with it.  Mad props."
Smoque is as good as always! Had lunch here today with my dad and an out-of-town guest. She really enjoyed the food and meeting the owner who is a very kind guy. Top notch BBQ and sides.
There is no better BBQ in Chicago and I've been to them all. Brisket is the best in Chicago and the Pulled Pork is great too. Ribs are very good but the Brisket is really the the best
I have been here a few times.  It is good bbq.I think the brisket is great. Every time I have tried the ribs I am slightly disappointed. I feel they are slightly over smoked.  They just are a little bitter due to the over smoking. Everything else has been great. Well be back but will avoid the ribs.
"6 stars.Amazing BBQ--the best I have had in Chicago, hands down! The meats are expertly smoked (have tried pork and beef brisket) and the peach-cobbler is out of this world delicious (and I'm usually not a big peach cobbler person).  I cannot properly stress how good the peach cobbler is.  The cole-slaw is just-right, the fries are excellent, the beans are actually incredible (what is in them??).  I actually haven't had the mac and cheese because the portions are so small (my only complaint about this place) but I hear it is delicious nonetheless.  I wish I lived closer or it was more convenient for me to get here and if that was the case I would come here at least once a week."
Possibly the best beef brisket on the north side. The rest is also quite good. Cafeteria style reasonably priced and BYO. Go now.
"Best BBQ in the city. It's all good. Brisket, pulled pork, ribs, mac and cheese, corn bread. I want to eat it all always."
This place is worth the line that at times you have to wait in to get in. Just be patient because the juicy flavors will taste amazing. Everything is good here from the brisket to the mac n cheese. The prices are affordable which I love and the place is always so nice. The staff is friendly and willing to accommodate your needs. Go! Now! Try it!
Smoque is the best bbq I have had in the city of chicago after 4 years of living here. A bit pricey depending on what you choose but the food portions are a good size and filling.
"Best BBQ I've tried in Chicago. Yea, there is a long wait, but they serve fast and the take out option is a nice one. Their sauces are amazing yadda yadda yadda.What I really want to talk about the slaw, which I could eat by the trough-full. It is so perfect, and such a perfect counterpoint to the smokey meats. Fries also great."
"Best BBQ place in Chicago hands down!  Been coming here since they have opened...Can't beat the sliced brisket sandwich with homemade fries!  They get you in and out, so the wait is not too long.  Worth the short drive from downtown. GREAT STUFF!!!!"
"We came here after hearing so much about it and seeing the place on Food Network.  We came and weren't disappointed.  Be prepared to wait in a line (outside too) before you go in and order.  We waited about 45 minutes.  It was definitely worth it!They have it down to a science.  You order and then they have someone seat you.  It is loud and nosy but that's okay.  It is a place you eat and leave.  I did note that they had pick up which I will definitely keep in mind. The food was very good.  We had a sampling of almost everything.  My favorite was the Brisket.  Yummy! I loved the sauce that it came with too.  The pulled pork was also delicious and my boyfriend loved the Baby Back Ribs.  As for the sides, we went classic fries and mac & cheese.  Very good!   We will definitely be back!"
"Not the best, but one of the better BBQ spots in Chicago. I love this place and have planned on going back. The location is really unfortunate as far as public transportation goes, which is probably the reason we haven't been back yet. Driving will be worth it.We all enjoyed our meals. For myself, I ordered the St. Louis 1/2 slab, brisket, the Texas sausage, mac 'n cheese, BBQ beans. The brisket was by far my favorite. The slab was great, plenty of meat. It's important to note that my BBQ preference leans more toward the fall-off-the-bone saucey type vs. the dry rub though, and that's what the St. Louis slab was, the dry rub kind. But, I enjoyed it regardless.The sauce pretty much made this food trip for me, I loved it. I'm one who tends to think a lot of things need more acid though, so I enjoyed the sauce being more on the vinegary side, but that might not be your thing. There is another sauce available that's much thicker, less acid, with sweeter notes. As for the sausage, it was okay. I would just move on over to Uncle John's instead if you plan on centering your order around something that.I'm not head over heels in love with the mac 'n cheese like everyone else on here seems to be because I've had much better, but it IS very creamy, and very good.Not a fan of the communalesque seating but at least they've got a system going in helping you get seated."
"We were there Saturday 1-28.  A busy and popular place.  I had the brisket, a link of sausage, mac and cheese, slaw, and the beans.  My partner had ordered a pulled pork sandwich, but wound up somehow with a brisket sandwich.  The brisket was good, the mac and cheese was very cheesy in a good way, the slaw was forgettable, and the beans were outstanding.Why 3 stars?  I have been to Lockhart, Taylor, and Elgin, Texas.  The food at Smoque is as good, perhaps.  But, unlike Blacks or Smittys or Meyers or Muellers, Smoque doesn't have soul.  Well managed, easy in and out, good food, but no soul.  Maybe, one day it will be laid back and the walls and tables will smell like smoke.  Time will tell."
"I heard from many people that if you are looking for BBQ in Chicago, this is the place.  I have sort turned into a BBQ snob as I was unfortunately living in Kansas City for a year.  That being said, this place was very good and if I am ever near the Irving Park blue line, I will make the stop.  On a side note, please do not let the line deter you from coming here.  The staff will seat you after you order, you will definitely get a seat.  This is very efficient, I wish they did this at Oklahoma Joe's in KC.  Now to the food, my fiance and I got pulled pork sandwich, fries, mac-n-cheese, and a sample taste of their ribs (which is a nice feature, so you can try and not buy the whole thing).  The pork was very good, a tad bit dry, but again I was spoiled for a year.  The fries were very good and crispy with a great seasoning.  The mac-n-cheese, which is what a lot people crave, was very good.  However, the portions were very small on that.  The ribs were good as well, they were seasoned great and had great char and smokiness.  The sauces.  I was not a fan of the Carolina style because it was too vinegary.  The Memphis styles sauces were good, both the spicy and original.  I wish they had a KC style sauce (ketchup based).  The prices was a tad bit high, but not outrageous.  Overall, it was great and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for good BBQ in Chicago.  Another great thing is, it is BYOB!!!!"
awesome bbq spot. i had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich and was stuffed
"Great BBQ (sand the most tender brisket I've had), great staff, very authentic. Love that the slaw is vinegar based and not a overly-creamy mush - great side dish.It's counter service, no frills, but well worth it."
"BYOB, and delicious smells.  Get in where you fit in and enjoy the unreal food.  I'm a sauce guy and this place does not disapoint."
"Nothing here that hasn't been said already. Super tender brisket, long lines, worth the quick wait. My favorite BBQ brisket in the city proper. Ribs leave more to be desired, hence 4 star instead of 5. Stick with the sliced (not chopped) brisket."
Love this place. Hands down best ribs in chicago. I am a rib fan and tried many rib joints in chicago and nothing beats smoque right now.
"What they do well, they do really well (the brisket). What isn't my favorite is still great."
"I dont like bbq...thats what I thought until I tried Smoque...had the pulled pork sandwich SO YUMMY. Not to even mention the BBQ sauce...we left home with a bottle of the spicy bbq.Cool spot to stop by. Go there early, as there might be a wait... no reservations/"
luv these ribs and the brisket..had if for our holiday office party yummmy
"Really enjoyed the ribs. The long wait was kind of interesting in the people watching Department. If your looking for a relaxing meal this probably is not the place. ..... But of coarse we are talking about cave man Ribs mentality here, right? The ribs were amazing, the sauce was way to vinegar for me. If I could only combine these ribs with Fat Willy's Sauce I would be in Rib heaven. So check it out but be prepared for a line and cafeteria style ordering and a bunch of happy cave people."
"Restaurant: Smoque BBQCuisine: BBQLocation: North Center (Chicago)Address: 3800 N Pulaski RdPrice Range: $10~151: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: ExcellentFood: 4Service: 4  Ambiance: 3Overall: 3.5 Extra information:*Ranked #6 restaurant on Urbanspoon Chicago*Pay first, and then sit downSmoque BBQ was a random find for me. Nobody told me about it, and I didn't find it on urbanspoon or yelp. To be honest, I can't remember how I stumbled upon their website. Anyways, regardless of however I found this spot- there was no way I was going to pass up on a BBQ place. It was a few minute drive from Chicago downtown, so my friend and I decided to check it out.Smoque BBQ is known for their brisket and bbq ribs- but personally, I find briskets to be a little too dry for me. Since there were only two of us....I had to think really hard as to what I wanted to order before I visited the restaurant.Once I walked in, I was surprised to see the restaurant lay out. I was expecting a full service restaurant, but it was order and pay at front and sit whereever kinda thing. There was a guy from the restaurant guiding everybody and making sure everyone had tables, which was super helpful.Keep in mind that they don't let you sit down unless all of your party is present at the restaurant.Ordered: St Louis Rib 1/2 Combo with coleslaw + 2 sides* 1/2 St Louis Rib, coleslaw, mac n cheese and fries for $14.95* You can choose between Baby Back Ribs or St. Louis* They said St. Louis is the meatier and fattier cut so I went with that* If you choose a combo, you get to choose 2 sides other than a coleslaw* Sides are BBQ beans, mac n cheese, fries, brisket chili and corn bread* For $14.95, this combo was huge and it could be shared between 2 people (girls)* Ribs were kind of on the dry side, and the sauce was more so marinated into the meat rather than dripping from it* Explains why there was a side of bbq sauce on the side for you to dip in* It wasn't fall-off-the-bone type which I prefer, it was kind of disappointing* Coleslaw was light and refreshing but nothing special* Mac n Cheese was so good! it was small in portion but had the perfect consistency of cheeseyness and the crust on top was to die for* Fries were huge in portion, it was good but again- nothing special Ordered: 1/2 Pulled pork sandwich * 1/2 pulled pork sandwich for $4.95* This was better than I thought it'd be* Most pulled pork sandwiches I find it to be dry* But the pulled pork was so tender and juicy* I didn't really like the bun since it was toasted and made it a little messy to eat* They give you some more BBQ sauce on the side to use* BBQ sauce was tangy with the just right amount of sweetness and smokynessOrdered: Cornbread* Side for 95 cents* This went well with my meal and it was well made* It's made like a corn muffin which made it easier to eat* I could feel the texture of cornmeal when I ate it (how it's suppose to be)* If you like cornbread, it's def worth 95 cents!Summary: I looked around as I was eating my ribs and it seemed like a lot of people were getting the briskets (what they are known for). And they looked pretty damn good! It wasn't dry looking like the most briskets I've seen. I love bbq and meat- and I can't stop thinking about their mac n cheese.  Price is decent and the turnover rate for tables are quite fast. Would recommend to drop by if you are in the area"
Awesome food... and it's BYOB.
"I've been to Smoque multiple times and it never disappoints. Problem is I love the ribs so much I get them every time! Need to make a point to try other stuff on the menu.St. Louis ribs are as good as it gets. Meaty, they take the time to really cook and smoke them so there is tons of flavor. All the sides are delicious but my favorites are the beans and the fries! Fries are fresh cut and a generous portion. Other sides have smaller portions but are rich enough you probably don't want (or need) more. BBQ Beans of some of the best I've had (warning for vegetarians there IS meat in them!).And the service there is great. The people on the floor are very efficient at preparing your table so you can sit when your food is ready. People move through at an efficient pace! Well done Smoque!"
meh. stil havent found good bbq in chicago. only place i can find good bbq is in texas when i go home for the holidays. tear.
All of the meats are amazing and their mac & cheese is top notch. Can be long wait though so go on an off day
This place has great food. No wonder the line is always out the door. Would go again and would recommend to friends!
Pulled pork sandwich = PhenomenalBeef brisket = PhenomenalBaked beans = PhenomenalColeslaw = PhenomenalCornbread = PhenomenalFrench Fries = PhenomenalService = PhenomenalFriendliness = PhenomenalMenu choices = PhenomenalSeating = Not so phenomenal
"Smoque is a no frills counter style bbq place where everything, even down to the sides, is wonderful.  I'm not normally a fan of chicken at bbq places, but this one is amazing.  The peach cobbler and the mac and cheese are also regular items for me.  It's byob and parking is pretty easy.  The only catch is that it's a popular place so sometimes you have to wait, but it goes pretty quickly and is definitely worth it."
Smoque is the best bbq in town.  We have been using them for years for any event or party at my house and just get great comments from everyone.  They also care about the community as they have been great at helping out at any fundraiser in the area.
"I have gone to some of the best hair salons and have paid way to much to get my hair done, What's worst is that my cut or color wasn't necessarily  what I was looking for. I decided to take a leap of faith and stop into the Hair Cuttery in Skokie on Skokie Blvd . I met Georgia who listened to what my frustrations with my hair was and delivered the cut and color I love! Oh did I mention  1/2 the price!!! She's great and know her stuff."
"In the course of one afternoon I went from a girl who didn't really like barbecue to a girl who was completely ignoring her lunching companion because she was having a special moment with a brisket sandwich. Yes, folks. Smoque is THAT good. Smoque serves up heaven on an aluminum tray. The brisket is so tender that it falls apart the moment you even look at it. The brisket sandwich (which I'm told is served on Hawaiian bread) will make you forget your manners, neglect everyone around you, and induce fantasies of shoving piles of brisket sammies into your face hole. The mac and cheese passed the Wisconsin Girl test - it was creamy and cheesy with crisp, buttery bread crumbs on top - and the coleslaw was phenomenal. The peach cobbler will make you weep tears of joy. The sauce at Smoque deserves its own paragraph, because barbecue sauce is the reason that I don't (or didn't) really like barbecue. Typically the sauce is too sweet or tastes like ketchup and I just think it's icky. However, the sauce at Smoque was tangy and peppery with a little bit of spicy heat. It was perfect. I wanted to drink it. I have been told that there is usually a line out the door but we arrived around 2:30/3pm on a Sunday afternoon and, while there was a small line inside, it wasn't a very long wait. Also, I appreciated that they seated us at a table for two instead of the long communal tables, because I wasn't minding my table manners. At all. Go to Smoque. Don't ask questions, just go. And BYOB."
"I still love the food at Smoque but I'm deducting a half star for some service issues. I placed an order for a 6:30 pickup on Friday night so I wouldn't have to wait in the line from hell. I arrived at exactly 6:30 and my food was ready. So far, so good. Unfortunately Smoque only has one register and I had to wait for a good five minutes for my order to be rung up...meanwhile my food is getting cold. I also had a $10 A La Card to be deducted from the final total of my order. I didn't know that giving them the $10 A La Card would cause all kinds of problems. Apparently a manager had to come over to handle the transaction which took additional time and then caused everyone behind me to wait since they only have the one register. My debit card was charged; I thought the amount still seemed high after the discount was applied but after being there so long, I just wanted to get the hell outta dodge. I got in my car and then looked at my receipt and it turns out I was given a discount of 10%, not $10, so I was shorted over $6. I debated dealing with it later but then figured it would be more of a hassle, so I did a questionably legal U-turn on Pulaski, re-parked, and went back in, fighting my way through the crowd. The girl that handled my food order (not the cashier) saw me and asked if something was missing from my order so I told her no and clarified that I was overcharged. She told me the cashier could help me when she was done with the current transaction she was ringing. So again I had to wait. The girl (pretty much the only bright spot) asked me if I wanted some chili while I was waiting ""because it seems like this has been one huge pain in the neck for you."" I acknowledged my annoyance but declined the chili, but I thought it was a nice gesture on her part. Again, the manager had to come back to deal with my transaction, which took another five minutes. Why they couldn't have just handed me $6 and change in cash and deal with sorting out THEIR error later instead of making me wait, I have no idea. They re-ran my credit card for the reduced amount but of course since it was on my debit card, the pending charge is still the higher amount until the final processing. I received no apology or acknowledgment of the hassle (other than the girl who gave me my food) from the cashier or the manager so I found that to be off-putting. I can't think I'm the first person to use an A La Card so they should know how to handle these transactions by now and they should also think about getting a second register to speed up the process for their customers. And of course because it took me so long at Smoque all of my food was cold by the time I got home. Soggy fries are a bad way to start out the weekend. ""First world problems"" - yep, they're a bitch."
"Honestly, I didn't really care for their ribs... BUT, I loved the beef brisket sandwich.  That was good!The place itself is very smalled and crammed.  I usually just take it to go, then go eat in the comfort of my own home."
"As a lover of BBQ, I am always on a quest to find the best I can or make it myself. I have had plenty of Q that I considered good, some even great....than I had Smoque.We got there around 4:30 on a Sunday and a super friendly server greeted us and we were able to be seated outdoors. Wait time to order was 2-3 minutes, and food was another 5-7. My girlfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which she enjoyed. I had the sliced brisket with a 1/4 slab of ribs, mac and cheese, and peach cobbler. The brisket was absolutely the best I have had in my entire life. Perfect rub, great bark, and the smoke was just heavy enough to give you some of the flavor from the wood, but light enough that you could taste the meat. I grabbed a fork, however it was not necessary. The brisket was fall apart tender, my hands worked perfectly. The ribs were very good as well, however they were really overshadowed by the brisket. The mac was cheesy, but not overbearing, and the baked crust on the top was tasty. The peach cobbler was decent. The crust was awesome however I'm 99% positive it was made with canned peaches..they had somewhat of a rubbery texture. The sides did seem small, however I was barely able to finish my plate, so they were indeed appropriately sized.I will go there again and again just for the brisket. A++"
"This being my last non-vegan meal... I loved it!!! I was told that they are the best BBQ in Chicago so I had to try it before I gave it all up!I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw and peach cobbler. The pulled pork was just how I like it with certain pieces a bit crispy. I smothered it in their hot BBQ sauce which kept my taste buds on their toes for sure! The only down side was that they use soft buns so things got mushy a bit. The coleslaw was exactly how I like it. They use a vinegar base instead of mayonnaise! Yeah! And the peach cobbler was not too sweet, had a good textured, crunchy topping and was the perfect small size for after a big meal. Yes... this meal has been in my dreams a lot lately... night! ;)"
"Delicious BBQ,  I had the brisket which was delicious, tender, and flavorful.  I would highly recommend this place for the BBQ hunger pangs"
"not sure if it's because I was tired...but I have the feeling that they just want you to get out of there as soon as you can. This is definitely not a place to sit and enjoy your meal, but a place for you to eat and go! I order the sliced brisket sandwich which was OK, simply ok, nothing that great, BF ordered the pulled pork and he liked it, fingers liked and all. Can't complain about the waiting time, 5 min top on a busy night. Personally I prefer to sit, relax, and enjoy my meal, so 3 stars it is, sorry Smoque not impressed!"
"The food is good, Nothing to rant and rave about, portions were not great, the sides are a little bland not bursting with flavor. I might stop in again if in the neighborhood. Location and Parking is terrible."
Deeee-licious.  Love love love the pulled pork and the mac and cheese.  I also like how they offer half orders.
"yum! this place was really great. my friend and i both had the sliced brisket platter and it was so so good. the brisket is tender and juicy and delicious. i have to take some points off for the sides though. the mac and cheese was pretty good, but kind of dry. it was tiny too. the other side i had was the brisket chili, which was nice and spicy but low on the brisket and high on the beans. it had a more watery consistency than i like in my chili and was just overwhelmed by beans. oh the fries were really good too! crispy and hot.the cole slaw was the kind that doesn't have mayo, which i know if supposed to be better and maybe even classier, but i'd rather have my mayo! especially with barbecue. but i'm not complaining as it was a refreshing addition to the meal and still had a nice tangy flavor. speaking of tangy flavor, i don't think i liked their sauce very much, which was a huge disappointment. it was just more sweet than anything else, and i wanted a lot more flavors and different ones at that.they have this great option where you can ""add a taste"" so i added a taste of pulled pork. they give you a pretty nice portion for the price of the add-on (3.50) and it was really good too! but not as good as the brisket.the service is good and everyone we came across was really nice. it's cafeteria-style seating so you order first and then go get your food when your number's called. i could see this being a nuisance if it were busy, but probably still worth going. plus it's byo so you can enjoy whatever booze you want!"
"Well you can tell by the thousand reviews that this place is good...I tried a little of most things on the menu and can say for me it was all good.  Here are how the menu items break down:The chopped pork platter was number 1 for me.  Yes it is better than I have found in Texas,The sausage is second best.  A little spice to it and much better than expected.The ribs come in third (sorry) Dont get me wrong, they are good but once you have had Pappy's in St. Louis you cant really have ribs anywhere else.For the sides you cant go wrong here.  Order any of them and you are golden.  The staff is great and very nice.  I will surely eat here next time I am in Chicago!"
Great BBQ. I had the brisket sandwich with the fries & beans and everything was delicious.I like the way they dont allow people to take tables before they get their food which allows everybody to get a table when its time to eat.
"I'm giving this 5 stars bc it is the best BBQ I've encountered in Chicago.  I live close and order take-out from here at least once or twice a week and love it.  The Chopped Brisket Platter (with an extra bun and cornbread instead of slaw) is always more than enough for me and my wife.  So while Smoque definitely ranks near the top of my nationwide BBQ list, it is certainly the best in Chicago and everyone should go here often.  Oh and the wait is super long so if you just roll up and ask for a table, you'll be waiting super long.   My advice is order takeout and they'll give you a specific time to come in and get it. And although you may feel guilty walking past the fools in line and going straight to the register, you deserve it for planning ahead.  Even just calling on your way over will get you a lot closer to that brisket platter.  Oh and ask for the thick sauce too.  I prefer it to the more vinegary style sauce that comes with the platter."
"I've been going to this place for years and it has never disappointed me! These guys know how to make great barbeque; the ribs, brisket and chicken are great choices. The Brisket Chili and Mac and Cheese are my goto sides. This place is a must try in Chicago!"
Probably the BEST place (besides a couple south side places) to grab a fantastic pulled pork. It's delicious and definitely worth the price. The mac and cheese is pretty good too; I hate oily mac and cheese but Smoque's recipe is spot-on.
Yes.  Simply yes.  I used to drive by here every day on my way to work with the windows rolled down.  Had to stop taking that route because it always put me in the mod for barbecue at breakfast time.  Definitely worth the stop.
"Great, fast barbecue. I showed up on a busy late Saturday afternoon, but the staff was very quick to sort the queue of people and direct people to open seats once they were available. A real gem for this part of town."
"The quality of the meat is very good.  The sauce they give you is sub par if you prefer sweeter sauces.  After my visit, a friend alerted me that they have other sauces available.  I wish someone on their staff would have let me know that they had different sauces available.  If the other sauces are good, then I will upgrade my review to a 4 star.  If you are on the south side, check our Hogwild on 148th and Pulaski.  They are cheaper and have very good food as well, but I think the quality of the beef brisket at Smoque is slightly better."
This should be 5 STARS!  But the portion to the mac and cheese is to small!  It's way to good to tease me with such a small portion!
This place meets the hype.  Really good BBQ.
"Ribs, chicken, and brisket all good.  Sauce too.  Went there three weeks in a row.  Sides don't look too appetizing though.  Wouldn't dine in, line too long. Tip: call in advance for pick up."
"Just slightly overrated. We've eaten here a few times when we're in the area, but it's never blown our doors in. If you're a BBQ connoisseur, lower your expectations and it may be ok. We LOVE BBQ and eat a lot in places like the Carolinas and Memphis, so we've been spoiled. Our search continues for excellent BBQ in Chicago."
"Best BBQ around, no lie."
"Fast is usually not an adjective used to describe good BBQ. But this was good, fast service for really good food. Best part was the brisket.  Definitely a must."
"I really like smoque bbq. Probably one of the best places for bbq in Chicago. Their meat is usually tender. The pulled pork is my favorite, but the ribs are good too. I'm not the biggest fan of their brisket, but I know people who love it. The cornbread muffins are delicious as is the coleslaw (I usually HATE coleslaw). Make sure to end your meal with peach cobbler!"
Amazing.  Delicious.  Terrific value.  What more can you ask for!
"I have heard so many great things about this place and I was so excited to finally try it out.    The line looked short from the door so we jumped on it.   There was a bit of a line inside but that gave us time to decide what we were going to order.  We wanted to try a lot of different things so we split ribs, brisket, fries, mac and cheese and peach cobbler.   The gem of the meal was definitely the brisket.  YUM!   You muct try it!   It was near perfection.  The ribs were excellent!   The fries were delicious, mac and cheese was not special and peach cobbler was a nice way to round out the meal.  We will be back to Smoque definitely.    Next though, we will call ahead for pick up."
"Maybe Smoque was a victim of all the hype for me, but I went last night expecting to be blown away and simply wasn't.  The best thing I had by far was the sliced brisket sandwich.  It was tender and tasty, and I'd make  return visit just to get it.  That said, everything else was just ok.  The pulled pork was a bit dry... The baked beans were a bit too sweet and soupy in my opinion... The St. Lois ribs were good but not great (tougher than I like).  Lastly, the cornbread was pretty standard fare for cornbread, and the much touted mac 'n cheese was good, but not super flavorful and was a little too creamy for me.  All in all, 3-stars seems like a reasonable review based on my experience.  Good, but not oh my freaking god good."
Best barbecue in the City of Chicago.
"Fantastic pulled pork, smoked meat and sides.  But what keepsme thinking about it is the mac and cheese.  Finally a place that makes really delicious mac, not the usual restaurant fare that looks pretty/tastes like nothing.  Best mac in the city, I think, other than homemade.BTW, Chicago IS a barbeque town.  One of the great consequences of the Great Migration!"
Sliced Brisket Sandwich and Mac and Cheese are amazing.
"Smoque BBQ, you son of a BEEF!You're kinda tasty, anyone ever tell you that?Baby Back Ribs were engrained with spices and pipin' hot fresh from the oven. The fries were also good but I didn't eat any.  The mac & cheese were also pretty good; just enough to fill the tummy and not become an oompha loompa. The only item that I had a problem with was the beef brisket. Don't get me wrong, it was fall of the fork tender. But I thought it lacked alot of flavor, almost bland some would say. It does come with a water down vinegary sauce and it does taste good with the sauce but I like my meat with some flavor. Nevertheless, I still liked the brisket and I will probably continue to get it but spices wouldn't hurt.Note: Parking was another son of a BEEF! But there's free parking near the side intersection near the highway. (Wall area)"
"This is my husband and my favorite bbq in Chicago. The first highlight is of course the food. They have 2 types of ribs: st Louis and baby back. The st Louis ribs are more rich (fatty) and are award winning. Personally I prefer the baby back (my husband prefers the st Louis) because they are leaner, to me taste meatier. The brisket is good too- my husband prefers sliced over chopped- melts in your mouth. The pulled pork is also very good. Cole slaw is citrus based which I prefer and comes with the platters. As for sides my favorites are Mac and cheese and fries. The brisket chili is also very good. Less impressive I thought were the peach cobbler and cornbread but nothing is bad.Lastly, the service is great. The owners are really friendly and are great at customer service. I ordered the wrong type of ribs and without saying anything- they just saw my husband get up with my food- they came up to us and got me Baby back ribs even though they hadnt made a mistake. They have two sauces if you ask- the usual and spicy.I recommend going early. There usually is a line out the door and the meat can run out. I think we ordered around 645 and there was plenty, still a line out the door. It goes fast and seating is cozy but somehow always works out by the time you get to the front. My favorite bbq is in st Louis but for Chicago the staff and food do it for me here."
"Chicago is not a BBQ town.   Mind you I have loved Ribs and Bibs and Harold's since i was a student.  But it's not Tulsa, OK city, Houston etc.  Accept it.That said, Smoque's is flat out fantastic.   Everything I've had there has been excellent - BUT - the SLICED BRISKET IS TO DIE FOR - and the mac & cheese is close, same for the sausage.  Fries are very good also, but beware - a single order  of fries is plenty for two or three people.  The sauces range from mild to reasonably hot and are marvelously spiced. Interestingly the owner hovers near the place where you order, and turns out to be there to help you enjoy the food.  When asked what is the best thing on the menu, he recommended the sliced brisket (I had had the pulled pork at the recommendation of a friend, and that was very good, but more of a foil for the sauces).  He asked what sort of 'heat' we liked, and then came over with a variety of sauces to try (I guess you have to know about the additional sauces and ask...??).   Anyway I loved them all, for different reasons, but forget which was which, so I guess I have to go back this week.  Outstanding BBQ and service."
"what in the sam hell is all the fuss about????? honestly,a cold sub par pulled pork sandwich doesn't deserve more than two stars. My husband, who, admittedly ,is WAAAYYYYYY more into bbq than I am, even said ""ehhhh"". maybe it was an off day? either way, we won't be going back."
"Been back a few times over the years, most recently on 10/13/13.  If I get to have a last meal I want it to be the sliced brisket platter.  I have yet to find any meal of any kind that tastes better.  This is simply the best tasting meal I have ever had.  Period.  The fact that it's a few steps from the blue line makes it even better.  No parking worries when I take the train."
"Smoque is a good solid BBQ in Chicago. First time, lines were winding around the building, and seating was impossible. Second time, about 8 months after opening, earlier in the evening was a little more manageable. Still packed but not overwhelming. The brisket is delicious, roasted chicken as well. I don't like BBQ all over the meat. I like to taste the meat and add the BBQ from the side. They do this their meats really well. Decent sides, nothing stands out as amazing, but the cobbler is good."
"I love this place.  Great space, amazing BBQ at reasonable prices.  This little Wicker Park gem is a great place for a casual evening for groups.  The outdoor patio is hard to beat.... I'll be frequenting this spot again this summer!"
"if you like the barbecue this is definitely the place to go! we drove  40 minutes to get here and it was definitely worth it! I also love that they have a parking lot behind the restaurant which makes parking a breeze. I went ahead and I ordered the brisket platter with came with  three sides. the brisket was delicious, tender, and juicy. their barbecue sauce was also sweet but spicy and had a great kick to it. I also order the macaroni cheese and the cobbler. the macaroni and cheese was great,  I just wish the portion would have had them bigger because it was so good. the cobbler was a great finish to a delicious meal too, I even had to  keep my fiance's hands off of it, lol! we also sat on the patio because it is a beautiful day out which made the experience that much better!"
Smoque is absolutely the best in Chicago. I travel throughout Chicago and burbs and try a BBQ place if one is close by. I am a novice smoker myself and the other BBQ places don't even come close to Smoque. The pulled pork is my favorite and all the sides are the best too.
"I know, it's shocking, but my BF and I actually went to this place without checking Yelp; We found their website via Google and went based on what we saw there. Bad idea. To preface: We are not food snobs at all. All we want is good food, good service, and a pleasant experience. We go out to eat several times a week and try to judge everything fairly, within context, and with an open-mind. I say this only because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this place that I do not get at ALL.They have their own parking lot, and we had no trouble with street parking. Walking up to the restaurant, the outdoor seating section looked lovely (unfortunately, it was full - at 5:30 PM on a Friday, so go early). We walked inside and were told by the busboys they'd ""seat us"" after we placed an order, but the inside was completely empty and basically had cafeteria-style seating, so, um...okay. Dress code? Feel free to show up in your sweatpants (not necessarily a complaint, ha).You place your order at the counter, much like a deli, and are given a number. We ordered from a bored young girl who couldn't have looked more unhappy to be there. Within mere minutes, your number is yelled out for you to walk back up to pick up your tray. Okay, so in a deli, your food can be made-to-order within minutes, but BBQ? No. So the food is not made-to-order. You can BYOB or serve yourself at a soda station, not unlike, again, a deli or McDonald's or Burger King.My BF ordered ribs with the brisket chili and mac & cheese, I ordered the chicken with corn bread and mac & cheese. They really are sides, quite small, which is fine. The sauce is VERY VERY VERY sweet, like, 20 sugars dumped in per serving sweet. The chicken was fine, the ribs were fine. Far, far, far from the best we've had, but certainly not the worst...just meh. The main dishes were just...fine. Nothing to write home about, at all. Maybe they'd have tasted better if they hadn't been (barely) luke-warm. The sides were excellent, and I wish they were available as their own entrees. My boyfriend completely devoured their coleslaw (I'm not a fan of coleslaw in general), so that's also a plus in terms of sides (and comes included).So, yeah. Cafeteria seating. Deli service (in the short time we were there, they went from yelling out 60 to the mid-80s - that's not impressive, that's a factory line of food...again, like a BBQ McDonald's). Food that isn't made-to-order. The entrees are overpriced, the sides are excellent. Disgustingly-sweet sauce. $40 for this? The equivalent of fast food? No, thank you, not with all of the legitimately incredible options out there. Guess it'd be alright for a quick lunch if you don't mind blowing $40-50 on lunch for 2. Their prices are ridiculously inflated for the quality of the food and the dining experience.Maybe this is ""great BBQ"" for people who never venture out their own neighborhood. It's not even charmingly simple or down-to-earth. We left super-disappointed. But, hey, the mac & cheese was delicious, so maybe we'll just order 6 side orders if a craving hits."
"Finally a place that lives up to the hype! This was a last-minute dinner decision, and I was really surprised to find the place packed, and I mean PACKED, on a Thursday night. We pretty much had to wait out the door, but surprisingly things kept moving. 30 minutes, and many edited dinner options later, I finally decided to go with the Brisket Platter with the BBQ Beans and Peach Cobbler. Holy yum. Full of flavor and delicious-highly recommend.My partner got the Pulled Pork Sandwich with a taste of the St. Louis Ribs, both were reallyyy good. The only thing I would've like was more sauce on the Pulled Pork, but it's personal preference really. I pretty much want everything on the menu, so I will definitely be coming back to do just that. Yay Smoque!!"
This place gets really crowded really fast.  Their brunch is excellent!  I also love getting chili and a side of mac and cheese to go.  It is the best take out.
"Yum! Their BBQ is really good! St. Louis Ribs, cornbread, mac-n-cheese and apple cobbler are a few of my favorites!  I love the staff, all nice, fun people and super accommodating.  They have outdoor seating this summer, and it's GREAT! Take out is perfect for an impromptu picnic!"
"I can't believe I have the good fortune to live just 4 blocks from here. We order to go from here since it does get super busy/crowded. The wait time is usually 15 minutes for pickup. Everyone here is super friendly.We got the brisket & pork sandwiches with cornbreads, cole slaw, beans & mac n cheese. Everything was amazing & we'll definitely be regulars here."
mmm southerny delicious.  Tasty meats and other delectables.  The best is the brisket and the peach cobbler is the perfect finish for a hearty BYOB meal.  Quick service because you order at the counter ensures low wait timeDefinitely a place to hit up sometime in your life.
The BBQ is fantastic here!  The place is always jammed but just call your order in and they get you out pretty quickly so you can get home and dig in.
Awesome place just signed on to yelp today and ate here so I thought it would be nice to give this place a shout out.... Waited for a bit in line but it was damn worth it.Great Mac and cheese and pulled pork.I will most def be back!
"It ain't no Texas bbq, but it sure is good for the midwest! I'd have to say - best bbq in Chicago. Ok fine, not that I've tried all of them in Chicago (I swear), but still, this is really good and legit stuff guys. Tried most of the meats on the menu - pork ribs fall off the bone, brisket is juicy, pulled pork melts in your mouth, and the bbq chicken was perfectly cooked, just about! Char grilled skin and errrrthang ;) Comes with sides - baked beans are amazing! Cole slaw and fries aint too shabby either. Seating is pretty limited, and street parking is available. Overall, good atmosphere and great bbq! I'd definitely come back."
"Yum! This is one of my favorite BBQ places in the city. Beats LillyQ and Q hands down. First the meat is great even w/o the sauce. But the sauce is an added bonus--sweet and a tad hot! The sides are great, too. We usually opt for the mac and cheese, beans, and corn bread. It's a bit of a hike from downtown but worth the drive."
"I haven't been to a lot of BBQ places in Chicago, but I will go out of my way to get my pulled pork fix here.It can get pretty crowded, so finding table space can be tough."
"Best BBQ around.  Bar none.  There might be a line, but it's managed super efficiently, line moves quickly and food is well worth the wait.  The pulled pork is my favorite, and love the Mac&cheese.  Super clean.  BYOB"
"Are you kidding me??? Smoque is the best BBQ ever. I could eat here everyday. They do it right, with fresh ingredients, and a high standard of quality. Chopped brisket, fries, and the various flavors of BBQ sauce keep me coming back! Loveitloveitloveit!!! Great place to bring out of towners."
The Brisket is the best I've ever had!
"Definitely the best ribs that I've had so far. Even though the line's kind of long, it's worth the wait. That night, we had Baby Back Ribs, St Louis Ribs, Pulled Pork and Peach Cobbler. The ribs're very tender and flavorful! The Peach Cobbler's amazing, everyone should definitely try one. If you guys like ribs, make sure to stop by this place."
"Another review, another 5 stars for Smoque. It's been over a week since we came here for lunch and I'm still raving about how awesome Smoque is. We knew going in that this place served up some great BBQ, but it was above and beyond anything I expected.Coming off fresh from a BBQ disaster elsewhere (review to come), I was a bit skeptical. Could it be possible to eat BBQ without fat oozing everywhere and feeling like a disgusting glutton? The answer is YES!Atmosphere:We were prepared for a long wait and were pleasantly surprised at how quick the line was moving. I think it helped that additional seating was available in the outdoor patio. Cleanliness definitely caught my eye. Also, it was nice that the staff take on the task of finding you a seat after you order. It not only helps to avoid confrontations for ""seat saving"" for instance, but also helps to keep things moving.Food:I ordered the half &half with one side. This sandwich gives you the best of both worlds and is perfect for someone like me that can never make a decision. One half of the sandwich was of the brisket while the other half was of the pulled pork. Brisket - deliciously moist and tender. Be sure to order it sliced since it's a bit juicier than the chopped.Pulled pork - More of the same awesomeness. I was amazed at how little fat at all (if any) was on any of the meat. The BBQ sauce - the perfect mix of spicy, tangy, smoked BBQ. Yum! I really like how they give you a separate container of it which is perfect for dipping.I substituted the coleslaw for corn bread (YES!) and got the side of fries. The fries were huge; enough to feed at least 3 people. The corn bread was good - even had real corn bits in it.Service:Friendly service, despite a very fast-paced atmosphere.  Another plus for having free soft drink refills and an endless supply of napkins at each table. We can't wait for our next trip here. We also are hoping to be able to have Smoque cater an event for us in the near future it's THAT good!"
"My husband is from the Kansas City area so finding BBQ in Chicago that lives up to those standards is a challenge. When we first visited Smoque a few years ago we weren't terribly impressed but because everyone loves it so much we decided to give it another try and I'm glad we did; I thought our meal was much better this time around. We had the sliced brisket with sides of fries, mac n cheese, and cornbread and everything was really, really good. The brisket was very moist and had a nice smoke flavor although my husband did comment that there wasn't the nice smoke ring that some people think is The sign of great brisket. No smoke ring needed here in my opinion, it was great without it! The small order of fries is HUGE and more than enough for 2 people to share. There will almost always be a line so be prepared for a bit of a wait, although they do a great job of getting people seated quickly. Smoque is also BYOB so if you're dining in bring a bottle of wine or beer and enjoy!"
Well let me just start off by saying I am not a huge Barbque fan in any way in fact I rarley have it. If anyone is in the mood for BBQ though I don't hesitate to tell people about this place and how good their food is. I usually only get the pulled pork and beef brisket dish. That is the best dish here IMO. Plus get the side of real corn bread yum yum. I had their ribs before bother styles and they were OK. Tried the chicken but it was a little dry
I'd seen Smoque featured on a TV show highlighting the best BBQ joints in America a couple years ago and since I love ribs I was so excited to try it out when I finally stumbled across it while returning from my favorite Filipino restaurant.  It was a huge letdown after the hype I'd seen on the TV show.  The food was just ok and  overpriced for what you get.  There were 3 of us and not a single one of us was impressed.  At the prices they charge they really need to be serving great ribs and not just ok ones.  Will I return in the future?  It's pretty unlikely since there have got to be a hundred really good BBQ joints in this fine city so I'm off to search on Yelp for someplace else with outstanding ribs.  If you do decide to try this place go in with low expectations and hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised and find out that we just hit them on a bad day.
"There are over 1,100 other reviews detailing in depth how AMAZING the food is. There may even be one or two that would actually do the food justice. I won't even try. But I WILL tell about a couple of the things I was surprised with:- Cleanliness! I was expecting a place with such good food to be kind of gross. It's not gross. In fact, it's actually pretty clean.- Low wait time - When we got there it was pretty crowded, but there is a fairly quick turnover of the tables. There are a couple guys working that really do a great job of cleaning the tables, seating you, and making sure things are running smoothly.- Outdoor seating - there are a few tables outside, which was a nice surprise as well.I could go on and on about the food, but what's the point? If you're reading this review, somebody else has probably already told you about the food. Listen to their recommendation, and GO TO SMOQUE RIGHT NOW."
"Smokey bbq at its finest. The half chicken melts in your mouth, but I will say that the brisket is where it's at. Get the sandwich. The sweet bread makes the brisket's tangy goodness even more apparent. For sides, I am not a cole slaw fan. But I do love their mac & cheese. So much so, that when I get to have two sides, I opt for two orders of the mac & cheese. My mouth is watering right now...Bring your appetite and get a ""taste"" of the ribs for only 4.50 more."
"My family LOVES smoque - they like the ribs, the pulled port and the brisket.  We like to order for family parties at the house.  I'm a vegetarian and can recommend the mac and cheese!"
Mmmmm mmm. That's all I can say about the food. But it was pretty packed and the seating is cozy so I'd recommend getting your order to go. It'll still taste just as delicious.
Mmm their Mac and Cheese.. I love it here. I love that it's BYOB! my favorite is their burger with Mac and Cheese on it.
I really don't need to say anything more about this place.  It's great BBQ on the Northwest side.  Right off of the Irving Park exit.  The best was when this place teamed up with Cemitas Puebla.  More restaurants should do stuff like that.  Keep it exciting!
"I mean, man, it's OK. Choqago has extremely low expectations for barbed bequeue in the first place, which doth make sense for a collection of expatriate rubes from their respective small cornfed (not grass-fed) mid'ouestern burgs. They come, hand-in-hand, guileless former Model U.N. team captains, rubes all, full-sleeve tattoos of internet memes (""me, me!""), queuing up and begging for the queue, barbed bequeue, rube-ix-que'be. From Iowa or the ""upper penisuala"" they arrive, ignorant and demanding. Even down to the name, it is expected that ""ashtray mouth"" is the penultimate goal of dining here, but nothing will cure such a flavor, least of all notwithstanding the inappropriately vinegarish ""Coles Law."" Sound the Amber Alert, they done made off with Ashley's innocence!"
Great customer service! BBQ sauce is good and has a unique taste. Baked beans tasted home made and the mac and cheese is actually pretty good.
The best BBQ in town.
"Best barbeque in Chicago. I'm already craving it a couple of days later.I went on a Sunday afternoon ready to wait. Lucky me, I was ordering in just a couple of minutes! I got a half slab of baby back ribs, mac and cheese, fries, and coleslaw. My boyfriend got the chopped brisket sandwich, beans, and coleslaw. My ribs were absolutely perfect! Smoky bark, juicy meat, not too fatty. I dunked the pieces in the accompanying regular and spicy sauce. And... that's where I feel Smoque falls short. Where are their sauce choices?! One of my favorite aspects of barbeque is trying all of the different sauce options, from smoky to spicy to vinegar-based. Smoque's spicy sauce was yummy, but it didn't really entertain my fire-loving tastebuds. I just like variety... is that so wrong? But I'll get over it. Anyways, back to the rest of the food. The mac and cheese is really as good as everyone says: super creamy, real cheese taste, beautiful crust. The fries seemed fresh cut and the portion was huge. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's chopped brisket and was surprised by how juicy and flavorful it was. We both liked the coleslaw well enough but it was primarily regular cabbage--not much color in there. The staff was unexpectedly pleasant, from the girl taking my order to the guy telling my confused face that I could go sit down outside and he'd tell me when my food was ready.Oh yeah, the girl sitting next to me got a salad. Idiot."
"I guess I have a thing for no frills dives, provided the food is excellent.  If you are looking for outstanding barbeque in the windy city area this is the place.  What can I about Smoque besides there is a reason you have to stand in line to get this food.  It is the best brisket hands down that I've had in the Midwest.  The food is consistent; the owner prowls the tables to make sure everyone's happy.Now again this isn't a fancy sit down barbeque restaurant.  You walk in the door stand in line order your food and pray there are two seats available next to each other for you and your wife kind of place. But once you try the foods or the sides, you'll love it.My opinion after many visits, the ribs and brisket are world class.  The pulled pork is very good.  The Texas sausage is ok but I would never order it again.  The sides are all excellent.  Go have fun and try this great piece of America."
"After being to Austin several times and eating some of the best BBQs I have to say that this place can easily hold their place, most likely one of the top 3 BBQs in Chicago. Try the peach cobbler!!!"
"If you want better BBQ than this, you'll need to take a road trip down to the southern states. Order anything on the menu. It's all good."
"Saw this on Guy's show awhile back. Finally got around to going there.4pm on a Tuesday, and we walked in, ordered, and had food in under 10min. Go at random times to avoid the crowd.Great Brisket(shaved/sliced) Great fries, cornbread, mac/cheese, slaw, BBQ sauce. Ribs were very good, and the reason I didn't give it 5 Stars. My issue with them was they were a little inconsistent. Half of my 1/2 slab was great, half was good. If they all tasted like the great 1/2, it would've been 5 Stars!Great job there! I will definitely go back! ALL Brisket next time! I'm allergic to pork, but still eat it if I feel like its worth a stomach cramp to eat! haha"
"Chopped brisket sandwich was divine. I got a half-portion because I usually can't eat that much, which was obviously a mistake, because the chopped brisket sandwich was *divine*. I also sampled their baked beans (delicious) and fries (also delicious). Went at 6PM on a Wednesday and faced no line. By the time we were leaving though a line was beginning to form. The owner of the establishment was warm and friendly when my friend inquired as to what style of BBQ they specialized in and gave us a bunch of different sauces to sample. Will definitely try to make it back on another weekday sometime."
"We felt Smoque was way over-rated.  Four of us went there on a warm summer night, the line went far down the block.   We waited over an hour to get in, then placed our order at the counter.  It was hard to push through the crowd to fill our drink glasses at the machine placed way in a corner.  We then found seats at a small table that needed wiping.  We were so close to the tables next to us that you had to be careful with your elbows.   To get to tables past us, people had to push by, bumping into us.   The food was fine but not anything special.   If we had walked right in and been seated comfortably we would have thought it was ok, but not exciting.  After the rave reviews, long line, uncomfortable seating and noise level, the food had to be way above average to be worth it.  We don't plan to go back, we can get much better BBQ with much less hassle."
"The sliced brisket was the best I've ever had. I haven't eaten a lot of brisket in my life, but this was really good! The Mac n Cheese is really good too and the people I was with said they liked the Peach Cobbler a lot as well. The wait wasn't very long either, despite it being back. Parking was easy too. Check it out!"
"We went for lunch. Chopped brisket was good although its' temperature was lukewarm while the chicken we also ordered was piping hot. Chicken was delicious - very moist - and delicious when dipped into the sauce we were given. Mac and cheese was ordinary, coleslaw dry, and fries greasy. We were not asked what sauce we wanted so I guess you just get what they want to give you. Compare that to Smoke Daddy on Division which has various sauces on the table for you to try. The biggest disappointment for me was the lady that took our order. (And I would have overlooked this if the food had blown us away.) There was only one other customer in the entire place; she was not busy. It was obvious we had never been there before from our confusion as to where the menu was (blackboard on wall) and to our discussion on which sides to choose. She neither offered her suggestions nor conversed in anyway besides asking ""What would you like?"" If you're going to have someone interact with customers and take orders, have them be a bit personable and friendly. Parking was easy right on the side street. Free for 2 hours. I'm sure, though, it's super busy on the weekends. And, yeah, don't park on the south side of the side street where you will see the ""NO PARKING for SMOQUE BBQ' signs; it's permit parking. Smoque's neighbors must be tired of cars taking their spots. Good they're trying to save people from getting tickets."
I probably eat too much Smoque as I can literally walk there which can't be said for many spots around this location.  Consistently good.  Baby back ribs are my top pick.  Call ahead for carry out as the line can be a little long.
Great food.  Super YUM!
The food is good.  It is not far from where I live.  Convenient to CTA Blue Line and buses.  Friendly people.  Indor and outdoor seating.  Affordable.
"Amazing!  I have always been skeptical of BBQ in chicago, but now Smoque has changed all that.  I stood in line for about 45 minutes on a Saturday night, but it was well worth the wait.  I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich (1/2 brisket, 1/2 pulled pork).  The coleslaw, baked beans, Mac and cheese, and peach cobbler were all equally amazing.   My only complaint is that this place should either be bigger or they should open another location.  Yum!"
"Wow!  What a great place to go for a good old-fashioned brisket sandwich, I ordered mine sliced, not chopped.  Next time I'll have to order the platter.  I'm not an expert, but I know good BBQ, and I haven't had brisket like this since I went to Texas a few years ago.  It's moist, smokey and literally melts in your mouth!  No wonder there's always a line!!  A place like Brand BBQ could learn a thing or two from a place like this.  Although I went here a few years ago, I don't remember it being all that memorable?  Either I ordered the wrong thing or I wasn't in the right frame of mind for BBQ.  All I know is now it's the best place for BBQ, not only in Chicago, but in all of the Midwest!!!  Next time though, I'd bring my own sauce, prefer Robinson's, which I think has a better kick to it.  I don't know if there's is homemade or not, it's just  so-so."
"FINALLY. After all this time I got to try the infamous Smoque. I went on like a Tuesday night, so the wait wasn't bad at all. Considering the fame, the wait time was basically nothing, because we probably waited like 15 minutes. I got the 1/2 slab of ribs, mac and cheese, cole slaw, and their fries. So I loveeee Gale Street Inn's ribs, but wondered if Smoque would be any similar but it was so different I'm not sure if I can compare. If Gale Street has lathered, rich sauce all over the ribs with fall-of-the-bone tenderness, Smoque has dark, smokey, home-made-bbq ribs. I felt that the BBQ sauce was lighter than super thick, which does NOT mean bad.I do not like coleslaw because it's usually super mayo-y but this one was more peppery with zesty vinegar sauce, yummy. The mac and cheese was very good as well, with nice crusty bread crumbs on top and rich and cheesy inside.I will try the brisket next time :D"
"Tim, thank you for coming to my home after 12 midnight. you made me and my children feel so very safe and secure. you are such a very nice man! your professionalism and mannerism, is something to be thankful for. i truly hope that your boss appreciates you. if he doesn't let me be the one to tell him how he should appreciate you and why. Tim, there is no doubt  in my mind or in my children's mind. you are the best hands down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!­!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!­!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Oh yeah, and you also have a BEAUTIFUL HEAD OF HAIR!!"
"Delicious BBQ! Pulled pork, beef brisket, mac n cheese, peach cobbler, beans, cole slaw... my mouth is watering just thinking about that food. If you'd rather avoid the long lines (and long wait) and the crowd, I recommend ordering take out."
"Possibly (probably) the best beef brisket I have ever had.  I had been here years ago but recently returned with my husband who is now obsessed with this place.  We both ordered brisket sandwiches.  We were feeling gluttonous and were curious, so we both also got one side and a ""taste"" portion of something else.  We got fries, mac n' cheese, a taste of the St. Louis ribs and a taste of the Texas sausage.  All was amazing.  I am NOT a big fan of ribs but they were phenomenal- just the right amount of sauce and not too much fat...  Yum.  The mac n' cheese is very very good, so are the fries.  The only reason I took off a star is that we got there at 5:30pm and it took over an hour to get our food.  We knew this going in, and were not surprised or miffed by the wait, but if the weather had been crappy or if we had come later and had to wait longer, this wouldn't have been as good of an experience.  Next time we will call ahead and do carry out.  Yum!Be aware, as other yelpers have mentioned, that you may have to drive around a bit to find parking as the adjacent neighbors do not permit parking on the block.  We found parking 1 1/2 blocks away around the corner- not bad."
"I've got to start this review off with one word..... Disappointment!! I finally was able to make it to Smoque last night with my friend and was really not that thrilled! My other friends have been going on and on about this place saying it was amazing and I just didn't feel it. 2 Stars for logistics and set up of this restaurant: It's so difficult to get a table and you have to wait for a while just to be seated on top of your neighbor. There's one area for drinks that is in the far corner and you're bumping into people just to move. Plus the cups they give you are so small for water, you might as well plan on getting up multiple times just to get enough water. We did move through the line pretty quick considering how packed but still, not a pleasant experience. 3.5 stars for food: Yeah, the BBQ is good, but it's NOT GREAT/AMAZING/EARTH SHATTERING. The portions are decent and the food has some flavor. Sauces are unique and have a kick. The fries are great. The food is priced on the expensive side however. I've had better so I'm sorry to say I can't give it an amazing rating. BYOB - this is a BYOB place so you can bring your own beer, which is pretty cool. If you're not going to drink I suggest you bring your own cup or plan on making many a trips to the fountain. I told my friend after we were done. Maybe if the place was not so packed and such a cluster f*ck, then i might give this another whirl."
"Flavor was nice and matched the smell coming down the street, but I was less than impressed with the texture of the brisket and ribs.  Not a bad place to go on a whim if the line is short, but not worth the wait through the weekend lines."
"If you are in Chicago and love BBQ you must stop here.  Line always out the door for dinner, but they get you in and out very quickly.  Mac and cheese, pulled pork and peach cobbler are my favorite.  Hard to eat BBQ anywhere else as we compare it to smoque.  Also another find from DDD, so more for our Triple D tour in Chicago area."
This is classic bbq food - can't get much better than this.
"DELISH BBQ... could do without the wait in line though, but worth it!! MMM.."
great bbq.
"i want to start out with a very important statement...i.never. eat. leftovers. EVER.so, with that said, i ate my (very minimal) leftovers the next day for dinner so that right there is a huge compliment. i never, ever do that. i always take my doggie bag home with all the right intentions but then they just get stock piled in the fridge until its too late to save their poor souls! sad, neglected, delicious leftovers :( anyway, this place is pheeenomenal. we went there on a sunday night and it was packed, line out the door, no tables available, packed. however, when i had called, the girl on the phone said it would be at least 45 minutes; i dont think it even took 20 and while waiting we scored a table. bonus! they have guys walking around helping bus tables and saving you a spot which is super nifty. so, i got the half and half sandwich with beans and cornbread. unbelievably good, i literally craved more instantly. they have sweet tea (real brewed) which is the biggest plus in the world. sweet tea with bbq is literally the only way to go.i didn't even take the time to glance at the reviews below but ignore the bad ones. do not wait any longer. get off your couch, get off the yelp app on your phone, stop texting your lover, pause netflix, forget everything you are doing right now and dont walk but RUN to this place and get the best smoqued BBQ you will have this side of the mason dixon!"
"Dang. That's five star barbecue. I mean, holy shit, that was good. My buddy and I sat down to what looked like an immensity of meat, and plowed through like it was nothing. I usually don't eat beef, but that brisket was some of the best beef I have tasted. It wasn't exactly a blur, but it went down so fast and easy and good. I'm  sure it's all been said here, but I do wanna shout out to the young guy hanging out by the seats, making sure everyone was taken care of and tables were cleaned properly. I'm sure it's a bottom-of-the-totem-pole position. I wouldn't say he was happy. But he did a good job, and he added an extra note of attentive professionalism to an overall superb dining experience."
"Best brisket in the city.  Topped off with Mac n cheese and peach cobbler, perfect call any day of the week (except Monday, but everyone needs a day off).  Eat in if you have the time, but a call for pickup always works."
Long wait. Great food. Probably better to take out if you have kids. Been here several times and have yet to fail me.
"Do not get the ribs! These were a dry rub and the meat itself was dry and very smokey (I guess that it why they call it ""Smoque""). The worse part was that my fingers smelled like smoke for the rest of the day, after washing my hands a couple of times. It was so overwhelming that it literally made me sick to smell that all day. The only thing to remove the smell was a scented lotion. In fact, it's making me sick right now... just thinking about it. I cannot speak for the rest of the food."
Really really disappointed after my trip to Smoque. After spending some time in Austin I was able to taste some truly great bbq and Smoque would be laughed out of town down there. I was hankering some good brisket and was dismayed to find it extremely greasy and worst of all the crust was TERRIBLE. Perhaps my favorite part of a good sliced brisket is the smoky peppery & salty outtery crust. Smoque's crust (if you can call it that) has zero flavor and no snap to it. Really shocked that this is supposedly Chicago's best BBQ in such a good food town. Great BBQ has made its way to NYC you'd think Chicago could get some of the same love.
Amazing mac n cheese! Not a huge bbq fan but these guys pull it off big time!
"Pretty tasty. If you like good Bbq this is the place to be. ,,,"
"A.M.A.Z.I.N.GI do not hesitate to make a trip out of coming here. It's a hell of a drive for me but it never disappoints. Pulled pork, brisket, fries, mac & cheese, baked beans. I have a hard time not ordering everything in one sitting. And the BBQ sauce is one of the best. Do not let the line scare you. It moves fast and they will get you a seat."
"Stopped by after seeing this place on DDD.  It was a small place with a ton of people.  They handled the crowd very efficiently.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We tried a variety of food and it was all very good.  Sliced brisket and St. Louis Style ribs were fantastic.  I wasn't crazy about the sauce, it was more tangy...I prefer sweet.  I also thought some of the menu was slightly overpriced."
"I'll catch hell for this, but their Ribs were, eh a meer 4 out of 10 for me.  I have yet to try anything else, but I most likely will cuz it's close to me"
"Casual, excellent flavor, good eatin's all around"
"Can't really put my fingers on the reason why this place is so popular.  I've had people say ""you HAVE to try Smoque, it will change your life!"" SO I'm like cool, there really aren't very many BBQ spots on the Northside (really in Chicago) that are decent, let alone good. So I gave it a try. First trip a no go.  Was gonna do the walk in thing. line was almost out the front door.  Also it was an odd way to have the line waiting. It's in the middle of the restaurant so you have a lot of ppl moving back and forth between the line including servers bringing food to customers who were eating in. I have issues this I know! however, something rubs me the wrong way when I see food traveling to tables having to weave its way through a line of mouth-breathers, looky lous and coughers before it gets to the table. I'm sure it happens in other places but maybe because I don't see it it doesn't bother me as much.  Anyway after catching that glispse I decided another day would be my opportunity to try them and it would definitely be via call in. So the next time comes around about a week later (Monday of this week 8-19). The order is the 1/2 slab baby back ribs, and the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches. the ribs were so so, a little dry and the flavor combination didn't work for me before adding the sauce. the brisket a little better. the taste was good without the sauce and slightly better with. the pulled pork by far was the best of the three. And no I'm not a fat, greedy pig.  got the items for two people and we split the meals as it was her first time trying them too. I'll keep looking for good BBQ in the city of Chicago. To me there was nothing really special about the flavors and taste of the BBQ, not to mention the layout and annoyance that I felt on my first visit wasn't particiularly great either. Still had to wait in the line to pay for my call in order and that was extended because they were training a new girl on the register.  Yeah, I'm grumpy and not an old man!I'm gonna wrap this up. Smoque to me is in the middle of the pack for taste and flavor. you can do better, you can do worst. See yeah later."
Darn good Q! Came  here for the first time the other day and man was I pleased. I got the platter of brisket with the mac and cheese and fries. I also got a taste of the pulled pork. Both the pulled pork and the brisket were heavenly. The meat was tender and had a great kick to it. I don't know if its the seasoning or the way they cooked it but man was it good. Next time I visit I will most likely get the pulled pork sandwich. Also they give you lot and lots of bbq sauce which I can dig.
"This is a great place. The sliced brisket is to die for.  I cannot speak more highly of this place.  The prices are reasonable for Chicago bbque, but, what you get is ridiculously outstanding.  Very impressive."
"We all know Smoque makes the best barbeque in Chicago.  I recently found out that they provide excellent catering service as well.Smoque wowed my wedding guests with a buffet that even the North Carolinians and Texans in the crowd couldn't find fault with.The price is excellent, the staff is friendly, and again the food is outstanding.  Peggy, the catering manager, made things clear and easy and was onsite the day of our event to make sure everything got off to a great start.  I won't hesitate to use Smoque catering again for a major event."
They have one of the best BBQ ribs! lines are usually out the door.
"Disclosure: I've been to Memphis, Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas and have ate at some of the finest BBQ places there are. Stopped by on a Sunday night around 8 to find a line out the door. Not crazy it length, but SLOW moving. While waiting in line a gentleman came out to announce they were out of both chicken and St. Louis style ribs. Wasn't planning on ordering chicken anyway but I was bummed about the ribs - but in the end somehow I DID get some! Conversing with locals in line, it seemed the brisket is THE item to get here. If you order one entrée, you are able to order a 'taste' of everything else for $3.50. So I decided my plan was to order a 1/2 slab of babyback ribs, and a taste each of the brisket, pulled pork, sausage, and St. Louis style ribs. 1/2 babyback ribs - dry, a little tough, not much flavor. 1/5brisket - moist, nice flavor, fall apart tenderness. 4.5/5pulled pork - good. nothing memorable though. I've had better, I've had worse. 2.5/5sausage - stunningly flavorless. no kick. nothing. 1.5/5St. Louis style ribs - MUCH better than the babybacks - though no where near as memorable as those I've had in Texas or Memphis. 3.5/5Final verdicts:- Place is NOT worth waiting in any line for and doesn't compare to BBQ veterans like Memphis and Texas- IF you decide to wait in line, there isn't anything worth ordering other than the brisket. - Staff are extremely friendly and sharp- Happy they don't bath everything in sauce and that it comes out the side with the exception of the pulled pork. Q is about the meat, not the sauce."
"I have been wanting to go here forever and I finally got to last weekend! I love the cafeteria-style set up. You order your food and pay at a register, then sit and watch the pick-up counter, where they will set your finished tray and call your number. I had the St Louis half slab rib platter with mac and cheese and peach cobbler for my sides. It also came with coleslaw. The ribs were great - not as tender as baby back, but really unique and tasty seasoning. The mac and cheese had great flavor, but it was too runny. I would still probably deal and order. The coleslaw was tangy and delicious. Honestly, the highlight was the cobbler. OH MY GOD. The crust is thick, seasoned and crisp. The inside is warm, sweet, with firm peaches. I had quite the experience eating that dessert. Would definitely come again. Everyone in our group did the platter option, and everyone ordered different meats and everyone was pleased. Don't think you can go wrong!"
"I've only been to Smoque once and really want to go back.   I found out about Smoque while watching Diner's, Drive-ins, and Dives and thought I would give it a try.  The pork and brisket was top notch but it was the barbeque sauce sold me on Smoque.  It was one of the most unusual sauces I've ever tried.  It is not thick like your bottled sauces.   It's more thin,  like water and has a slight vinegar taste to it.  What ever is in it,  it is fantastic and I wish I could duplicate it.  My only complaint would be the sides were too small.   I wish I could have had more of that fine mac and cheese.   I think anyone in search of fantastic BBQ will not be disapointed by visiting Smoque."
"Omg now i know what a true definition of a feast is!!! I dont think I need to say more. The ribs are out of this world! The (pulled?) chicken sandwich is amazing and all the sides and the peach cobbler!!! The 30 minute line was WELL worth it!!! The service is great there too, got our food fast and the bus boys were very helpful and friendly. Not a place u go to every day or even that often - am sure its not uber healthy! But every once in a while its a TREAT! Expect a long wait, but worth it!"
Best brisket in Chicago. It's as close as you can get to the southern style BBQ. The macaroni and cheese is delicious and so as the peach cobler. I like their bun it's kind of yelowish bread with light sweetness that melts in your mouth. The owners are very nice people and very freindly. I highly recomend this place.
"Although the ribs are not my type of ribs that I like, which are fall-off-the-bone tender, all of their other stuff were really good. The brisket is out of this world and the corn bread was delicious. I've tasted better ribs and cole slaw elsewhere and really would not say I would wait so long in line again but would definitely come back with friends if the wait was not long."
"If you haven't been, just go (or get takeout).  Best BBQ I've had in Chicagoland, and the sides are great, too, which isn't usually the case with other BBQ joints."
"This place is amazing! Why there aren't more Smoque's around, I don't know?!? Wish I could give it 10 whopping stars!!! This gem should not be held a secret especially with the great staff and owners like Allen! I was treated like a star from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out. I was treated to a great selection of different sauces by Allen. Honestly guys if you haven't been to Smoque by now, you have not lived a day in your life. I would go as far to say that you are not a true Chicagoan if you have not paid Smoque a visit! 'Nuff said!"
"I'm from Texas and I've had plenty of BBQ, so I am very honored to give this place 5 stars in my book! I love the layout and presentation of the food. You order a dish and it comes with two sides, or you can get them a la carte. When your order is ready, it's presented on a tray lined with wax paper and the sides come in their separate containers so that there's no cross contamination of different dishes (not that I mind that at all).  The portions appear small, but if you're visiting and want to try a little bit of everything, the smaller portions are excellent for that. My favorite was the corn bread, BBQ beans, peach cobbler and the St. Louis Ribs. The St. Louis ribs are to die for. I've yet to have a tender, slide off the bone rib since I lived in Texas. So this place, being NOT anywhere near Texas and having an assortment of BBQ and sides definitely made my 30~ minute drive from our hotel near Lake Michigan worth it. We also ordered chili soup, pulled pork, bbq chicken, fries, slaw and mac and cheese. Also, if you want to try something, but not sure if you want to order the WHOLE order, there's a few items you can ""sample"" for an additional cost at the end of the middle panel. That is what I did with the St. Louis Ribs. Afterwards I wished I had gotten the WHOLE RACK!The restaurant was super busy when I arrived, but there were associates who were nice enough to anticipate your seating and dining needs that they actively reserve a table for you, so that by the time you're done ordering your food, your table is ready, you eat, and then ready to head out and enjoy the rest of the beautiful city! The process is so efficient that I don't know why other restaurants don't follow their method.I was pleasantly surprised that our peach cobbler was still CRISPY even after it had been waiting on our tray for over an hour as we finished our mounds of BBQ goodness. Oh and a BBQ meal isn't complete without sweet tea! I will definitely be back for more BBQ next time I'm in Chi Town. Oh and almost forgot to mention that Smoque was featured on Food Network Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives! Good call man!"
best BBQ I've had so far!
"Some of the BEST BBQ in the city!!  Pulled pork, sliced brisket, cornbread, fries, and peach cobbler are fantastic."
"I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to love this place. I was so excited to finally be able to go after seeing that even after over 2000 reviews, this place still had 4.5 stars. However, it didn't blow my mind as I thought it would. It wasn't the best. It was good, don't get me wrong. The meat was delicious, but they only give you one sauce and it wasn't all that great. It's just better to eat the meat without it. The BBQ beans were probably the best side we ate, the mac and cheese was definitely overrated."
"Great food, great service. We have eaten there and also used them for catering a party. They do everything well from main courses to side dishes. Just be ready to wait because the dining area is pretty small. They usually have staff there helping coordinate who will get the next open table so that helps."
"Great food, nice portions, and a good price.  The staff is friendly.  Go here and eat!"
"Yes, I saw all the awards they display on the wall but I have to be honest I wasn't blown out of the water.... no I wasn't even swayed by the endless promoting of their time on Diners, Drive-ins and Dive's  with Guy Ferrari, posters, pictures, books, really !!Now, how to compete with the other 837 reviews...hmmm how about 5 tips for the wise1) GET THE PLATTER... platters come with 2oz more meat and 2 buns worth less of carbs. do it. In General portions are big, you sure get your money's worth, I got the chopped brisket platter, comes with over 2 cups of tender chopped brisket, slaw and two sides, which look small, but when its all together its enough to feed a small country. Mac and Cheese and baked beans were good. Addition: Even better the next day, as I am eating this cold at 8am. yummy !!2) BYOB..... woooo. enough said.3)  DON'T EXPECT FIRST CLASS SERVICE... though everyone was friendly its very self serve here, order from the counter, no table service, communal table seating, metal trays as plates, and plastic silverware, though they some of the best bus boys in town.4) DRIVE... if you don't have a car invite a friend who does, don't pass it by, it is not advertised well unless you know where it is, there is lots of free parking just North on Avondale and in front on Pulaski though its not the best neighborhood so leave your brand new Ferrari at home, my friend got the tire cover stolen off her jeep while we were eating... eeek. 5)  GET THERE EARLY... got there at 6:30 on crisp fall night, we were pleasantly surprised that they were practically empty, though by the time we were finishing up a little after 7, the line grew and it was sooo busy ! I had wanted to try the cobbler but it is served warm so the only logical thing to do is order it after your done eating, but by that time I was not willing to wait in that line. Guess I will have to come back !It also get very loud in here, when it was only about 1/4th the way full it was almost impossible to hear my friend, even sitting in the corner of the restaurant ! not cool !Definitely worth a trip to Avondale to try it out when your craving some BBQ and nice and hungry !"
Smoque is good. Not the best.
The pulled pork sandwich is the best I've ever had.  It's amazing how the delicious bun soaks up all the bbq sauce!  I love taking my co-workers here for lunch during the week and my friends on the weekend.  My friends and co-workers love the chopped brisket.  You can also get a sandwich that is half and half to try both the chopped brisket and the pulled pork.  Very friendly staff.  I've only had great experiences here.
I'll make this fast since there are tons of reviews here. Get the brisket sandwich and the macaroni and cheese. Both are absolutely delicious!!
"They catered a party of mine.  Besides the food being awesome, their set up service was incredible.  Brisket, ribs, sausages, cornbread.  Everything was a big hit.  Very reasonably priced too for what you get."
Great BBQ just beat the lunch crowd!!
*Coming Soon*
I thought it was pretty good.  I wasn't blown away like others have been.  I think I still prefer Smike Daddy...but maybe i just have Wicker Park bias.
good ribs!
"I just visited a Texas BBQ place this week, which reminded that I better get this review in. And, let me tell you, you WANT to hear about this place.Wowser! This is literally effing fantastic BBQ! No, better than that...BBQ nirvana! Yep, nirvana about describes it. You have GOT to go!!Let me give you a few logistics before I talk about the crazy good food. First, you need to BYOB, so go by Trader Joe's or Binny's or Whole Foods and buy beer. Get a good micro-brew because this place deserves it. Second, go EARLY! They sell out. Having been there many, many times, I can tell you that they sell out often of the good stuff. Third, don't let the line scare you. They move that line pretty quick. Yes, the darn line goes out the door and down the block sometimes, and, while I hate waiting, I always beg my hubby to let us stand in this line. Even in the winter, and if you knew how much I hate, hate, hate the Chi-town winters, you would understand what a sacrifice that is for me. The place will usually be PACKED when you finally get in the door. But, don't worry. They will find a table for you by the time your order is ready. Just go ahead and place your order, stand where they tell you to and the owner will tell you when and where to sit. Just do it. It's a privilege to be in there.Now, the food. I'll start with a disclaimer, as a native South Floridian, I didn't really know good BBQ from bad. I mean, we're known for not knowing how to vote, and not for our BBQ. But I married a Texan. (Yeah, girls, be jealous, they know how to grow them in Texas.) And, my Texan knows BBQ. So, an endorsement from him is a big deal. He LOVES this place.They make this beef brisket by smoking long and low. It gets this lovely smoke ring all around, and the flavor is to die for. Then they get their sausages from Mikeska's. Texans will know what that means because Mikeska's is a Texas institution. They know their sausage. And, Smoque gets it from them. (The sausage is a big sellout early in the evening, so try before 7 pm for that).And, the cornbread! Oh, man! Sweet but not like cake. Moist. With little pieces of real corn. Love it.Then, they make their baked beans in house. With their own recipe. And they put chopped beef brisket in the baked beans! Oh, my stomach growls and my mouth waters just writing about it. Chi-town, how I will miss those beans!The hubby likes the mac and cheese. He's a big mac and cheese eater and he likes the one made here.Lastly, one of the owners is usually in the kitchen, while the other one helps keep the line flowing smoothly and the seating arranged. Just go! You won't regret it! (Unless you are a vegetarian...then stay away.)"
"The rating is deserved and the hype is true. Smoque delivers a consistently awesome BBQ experience that justifies the line stretching out the door. The staff are all smiles because they know they're serving up portions of awesomeness at a fair price. The seating is casual and the paper towels are right there and ready.The brisket is tender and high quality. The sandwiches are on a good-enough quality of bread as to make it more than just a vehicle of getting meat to your mouth. The pulled pork is flavorful and firm.The dipping/drizzling sauce has an addictive lime flavor that makes me want to gargle with it. The sides are appropriately portioned and seasoned to compliment the BBQ meat.If you're going to pig out, do so where you are guaranteed to enjoy it.They also kick butt and take names at short notice catering. My Superbowl party LOVED the party tray they put together with just an hour's notice!"
"Everything was super!!!! And the brisket was the best I have ever tried. The rib was also not bad. In terms of the side dish. OMG!!!  You must try the BBQ beans. So delicious to accompany the BBQ sauce.  The mac&cheese was also great. I personally do not eat mac&cheese in daily basis, but this one at Smoque BBQ nailed it.  It will be pretty busy during weekend. I suggest you have a patience for a long line or go there during weekdays."
"Great food, great service, BYOB which means a great time. The line may be a bit intimidating, but it moves fast and you can typically get a seat before your food is served. The prices are fair for the the quality of food you are getting. Be sure to try the mac and cheese, it's the best in the neighborhood"
"Unbelievably tender, flavorful brisket. Sliced or chopped, it's the star of the show."
"Ordered lunch for a group of 21 at work. Everything was really good. Corn bread was fluffy, brisket fell apart, BBQ sauce was great, macaroni and cheese was perfect. Definitely going to be going back soon. Prices were very reasonable also. Loved it overal.."
"I came from 60 miles away to have lunch at Smoque. That in itself should be enough of a review. AMAZING BBQ in Chicago, well worth the trip from just about anywhere."
"Smoque is the best barbeque you'll find in Chicago. The brisket is the most popular item on the menu. I got the chopped brisket sandwich - with a side of fries. My girlfriend had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. I will give them credit for having a ""taste"" option on the menu where you can order a small portion of basically any menu item... which i did take advantage of. I also tried the St. Louis ribs which in my opinion was best thing I tried.  Maybe it was just me but i enjoyed the pulled pork better than the brisket too. I found the brisket to be a little too dry.  The sides were also very good and overall it was a great bang for your buck. For me, Smoque doesn't measure up to a few places down south, but it is the best in Chicago."
Decent food and portions but not my fav BBQ in the city.  Overall the meat seemed a bit dry and over-seasoned to me.  I really liked the sides much more than I did the actual meat.
5 stars-everything is amazing!!I travel a great distance for this BBQ
"This place is my neighborhoods gem.  Evenings and weekends get busy and can have a line out the door, so show up in the weekday afternoons to avoid the crowds.  I always get their mac & cheese, corn bread, and sliced brisket sandwich and dip it into their barbecue sauce."
"Sitting at The Smoke Shack in Milwaukee I was seated with another couple talking BBQ. The gentleman highly recommended Smoque and after some research a small group of us went down there.We got there nice and early and were among the first in line to get in.I got half slab of St. Louis Ribs, Smoked Sausage, Chopped Brisket, Beans and Mac and Cheese.Their BBQ Sauce that is offered is good. I kept finding myself going back to it.The ribs were tougher then I thought they would be. When attempting to pull the bone away from the meat or remove a portion by hand there was a lot of resistance. It was one of those moments where if it would have given way I may have clocked the guy next to me. Another in my party commented on the toughness of the Ribs.The smoked sausage was good. Nothing I haven't had elsewhere though.The chopped brisket is a good choice if you want to sample the sauce in my opinion. It serves as a vehicle for the sauce to be consumed. Eating this by itself tends to get tiresome as the bites ware on. I found myself wishing I would have had the sliced brisket.The Beans were fair and the Mac and Cheese was standard that you find at more popular restaurants. Everywhere I go the waitstaff usually comments on and highly recommends the mac. Everywhere I go it typically all comes out the same. I mean really folks... its noodles and cheese and only so many combinations of the two.I would come back and get a different cut of ribs. I would also get the sliced brisket then update this review to reflect that. As it stands now I wasn't overly impressed. It was good BBQ but not really worth the drive. I am sure Chi has other joints that I'll be checking out when i am down there next."
"The food was good, but the meat just wasn't there. There was a lot of fat on the ribs and there wasn't enough sauce. I was really interested in this place after seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives but maybe they are still riding on that."
"Finally got around to trying this place. Went on a Friday night around 8pm. Plenty of seating outside and seating available on the inside as well. I ordered the chopped brisket platter. The brisket was delicious, while I don't consider myself an expert on brisket, I don't think I've had better in the city or otherwise. Meat was cooked perfectly and the barbecue sauce was delicious. BBQ baked beans were amazing and the standout dish I tried. Mac and cheese was solid. It's a no frills design on the inside, which is appropriate for a BBQ place I suppose, but the seating can be tight, the staff hover over you a bit, and it's a quick turnover. Byob on the inside only. Overall, excellent BBQ for a reasonable price. Great place for carry out."
"The St. Louis Ribs are awesome, the fries and mac and cheese are great.  I would defiantly recommend doing take out cause it is usually hard to find a seat.  Otherwise, amazing food!"
"I mean cmon. If you don't go to Smoque and get something for the here/now and some for later, you're not taking advantage of their pulled pork or brisket. I think the play is getting a rack of ribs and some chicken and around 5 sides b/w two people, in person. Then you get a pound to take home and grow on in the freezer. This place is delicious. There's nothing I haven't liked. The cole slaw has red onion and is vinegar based fyi. The mac and cheese is pretty special. The brisket chili/cornbread goes great together and the chili is heavy on the cumin, imo. fyi. That said, the STL ribs are a dry rub (but wet) dream. Charred black on the outside and falls off the bone. GREAT SAUCE!"
It is really good but I think it is a bit pricey for the portion size. The mac and cheese side is really small. I am also not a fan of the communal type eating. But I would go again and do carry out.
Read what Nik O has to say. I was with hi and helped him write the review. So many better places in Chi-Town to go to than eating mediocre food.
Delicious comfort food--what else can I say? Always crowded and for good reason.
"There's not much I can say about this place that hasn't already been said.  My only advice is to get the chopped brisket rather than the sliced brisket, it sounds the same but others have agreed that it's better chopped.  As far as barbecue goes, this is as good as it gets!"
"After hearing nothing but rav reviews from fellow Chicagolanders my lips were smacking just at the thought of going to Smoque...I however was disappointed. It's quite possible that it was talked up a bit too much for me... My husband and I went the day after the 4th of July (when they were closed) so I suppose the ribs werent as low and slow as they could/should have been. They did not fall off the bone, they were not tender, they were chewy. I regretably did not get the mac n'cheese. It looked divine. The beans were some of the best I've ever had. The BBQ sauce is middle-of-the road... nothing to blow your mind or anything.I was also surprised to find that it was not a sit-down, table service kind of place... I guess the fans who raved about it left that part out? There is no beer either. My expectation was to come, sit down, order a beer, have some mind blowing BBQ brought out to me... and I didn't get that at all. Smoke Daddy in Bucktown still beats this out in my opinion."
"Great pulled pork!  I would recommend calling your order in when doing carry out - the place is always packed!  Well worth any wait though.The mac and cheese was awesome, so was the pulled pork sandwich!  Slaw was good too!"
"YUM!I didn't know that Smoque catered until it appeared at a friend's wedding.  This place makes amazing BBQ.  Come for the pulled pork, stay for the corn bread!  Getting here can be a bit of a hassle, but it is well worth the trip."
Awesome BBQ. The best beef brisket I have ever tasted. It was so soft and juicy. It literally melts in your mouth. It is nothing like the tough chewy brisket you find elsewhere. The family had chicken and pulled pork And loved them too. Sides were also great. Place was crowded on a late Saturday afternoon but tables opened up pretty quickly. It is worth a trip to try this place.
Crazy lines but it's great food. The baked beans are waaaay to sweet but maybe that's just me.
best bbq in the city i've found.  Specifically the sliced brisket and the mac n cheese are outstanding. Pulled pork is very good as well.  ribs/sausage are average though.im from texas.  I have more than my fair share of BBQ.  this place is great.
YUM. I want to go back!!
"Best bbq in town!  Ribs and brisket were amazing.  Also, cool that it is BYOB.  Just wish it was closer to where I live, but if it was closer I would be 400 pounds heavier!"
"I'm so glad my new place is a few blocks from here.The food is good, and the prices are fantastic. The combo meals are well-worth the price; go with the fresh cut fries.The sauces are the real deal; none of that fake, watery stuff from Cisco Food Systems. My only gripe about this place is the whole ordering and seating system. It's rather confusing to see signs telling you to queue in one place and then have a host or hostess tell you where to go next, including your table."
"I went on a Tuesday. Parking was horrendous. I think it is overpriced for what it is. I was not a fan of their sauce. The links were delicious, but the St. Louis ribs seemed overdone. I had them without sauce and they were dry. My daughter's chicken was ok. The fries were the best thing we tried. I wouldn't return because parking is too horrendous, but if I lived in the area, I might stop by once a month."
"The most incredible BBQ beef brisket sandwich on the face of the planet!  No longer do I have to anticipate my trips to Houston, TX for the best example of this delectable meal.  Fast service, an empty table for my BBQ banquet, and available street parking during lunchtime.  Thanks yelp for helping me find this extraordinary place!!I can't wait to take the family!"
"My husband and I love Smoque, so of course we wanted them to cater our wedding.Peggy and her crew did an absolutely amazing job doing just that.  She worked seamlessly with our main caterer (Cork) to ensure the look and feel of the event would not be compromised.Peggy also worked very closely with me to understand guest counts, help calculate how much food to allow for vendors, and to ensure I was comfortable with her staff's attire.We had SO many comments about how good our barbecue was - which means a lot because half the guests were Texan!If you are even kind of considering using Smoque for catering a ""high class"" event, do it!  They are awesome."
"Best BBQ I have had in Chicago.I like everything about this place. Great atmosphere, service, and food!Brisket is AMAZING. Ribs, pulled pork, all sides are extremely good. Reasonable prices for the food you get. It is a little out of the way but make it a point to visit soon."
"Leave the sides behind and go for the best ribs in the entire city, period. Carry them out . . . . and indulge!"
"Yowza, yowza, yowza!  Let me get this out there:  I looove barbeque!  I like crappy barbeque even.  What is there not to love about a rosy pink smoke ring, a crusty bark, juicy, succulent meat and a perfectly balanced sweet/sour accompaniment sauce?  (Yes, I am from the camp of bark bbq fans.)Proper barbeque should have all the above.  Smoque BBQ delivers!  Last night was my second visit.  I have tried to go on several other occasions, but the line had been out the door and I was too ravenous to wait that long.  Fortunately last night my wait was a mere 15 minutes.First, let me give Smoque BBQ a big shout out for the tasting portions!  I can be indecisive at times, and the tasting portions are reasonably priced and sized to allow me to sample without grazing on my dining companion's dinner.Now for my meal last night...I ordered the brisket chili, the sampler of St. Louis ribs (1/4 slab) and the cornbread.  The brisket in the chili was good, but I was looking for bark chunks and was disappointed that there weren't any.  It was a bit on the watery side for my liking for chili -- I prefer the stick-to-your-ribs kind of chili that leaves me satisfied until breakfast the next day.  There was, however, a nice balance of meat, beans and tomatoes in the chili.  The spiciness was very good too:  a heat that wasn't so overpowering that people who can't handle spiciness should shun away from this.Now for those ribs.  I'm drooling right now as I write this.  Boy, Pavlov would be so proud if he could see me now!  Let me sum this up quite simply:  Go to their website and take a look at the ribs.  Yes, their ribs look like that and YES YES YES, they taste like that!  They put the sauce on the side, which I feel satisfies both sides of the barbeque dichotomy.  You who love the sauce can slather that goodness as much as you need.  You who love the bark can grab a hunk and dip to your heart's content.Lastly, I can't forget that cornbread.  The cornbread was really good with pieces of corn.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Moist, but not to the point that the bread gets stuck to your teeth.  If only they served it warm with a pat of butter on the side.And please don't insult Smoque:  Don't dare use a fork on those ribs."
"The BBQ is good, although I have to say not my favorite.  We've never eaten in, always ordered and picked up, the service is great though.The ribs are FANTASTIC!  Love them and don't need sauce on them because they are SO flavorful!  Baked beans are amazing, incredible flavor.  YUM!My biggest issues:1.  Without the sauce, not much flavor to the meat - whether its the beef brisket or the pulled pork.  With the sauce, good flavor, but I like meat that stands alone and doesn't require the sauce.2.  Sides are very small, even when you order the big ones... a family can go broke trying to get sides to go with their meal.Yes, we will order from Smoque again, have done so a few times now, but will probably stick to ribs because that is what we enjoy the most."
"I love BBQ, and having lived in Florida, I was spoiled on some really amazing places, even a few which were just screened-in shacks. Smoque elevates BBQ to a different level; not better per se, but more of an element of style. I do wish they'd vary the menu up a bit, to include the mac-daddy of all bbq meats, burnt-ends, but alas, I'll settle on the pulled pork. Adding a ""taste"" to your plate is always a bonus. There's some competition with Big Bricks, County BBQ (which is close to work), and my own fine slow-cooked ribs, but Smoque's still on top."
Best BBQ in Chicago
What's there to say? This place makes damn good barbecue. Especially the brisket. That's all you need to know
"One thousand three hundred and ninety eight reviews.... So there's probably not too much to add!I had dinner with a long time friend and we both have wives who don't do BBQ, so it was a nice man date! I had a nice tender plate of sliced brisket... great flavor without sauce, a nice bump with a touch of the different sauces. I also love leaving the joint and smelling all smokey, but not cig smoke.... BBQ Smoke!"
"Smoque's stellar reputation is well-earned. I've tried SmokeDaddy and LillieQ's, and the BBQ here is much better - especially compared to LillieQ's. Almost every cut was great...moist, strong flavors, and tender. They are efficient too: I would call ahead of time for a weekend pick-up order. My only complaint is the price. It's not outrageous, but I would visit more often if entrees cost a couple of dollars less. Cornbread is good, but I like crunch edges."
I have been to many events that were catered by Smoque and have never been disapointed.  Top quality delicious meats and sides.  Be sure to try all of the different sauces.
ok...it's no memphis...but this place is pretty awesome without having to drive the distance! you can't beat the combo of byob and their bbqs...the mac and cheese is to die for!
"I recently realized how much I love BBQ so I knew I had to check out Smoque. It was kind of a hike to get out there but it was totally worth it. Best pulled pork I have ever had, great fries, great St. Louis ribs. Reasonable price and BYOB. No complaints except location and maybe sauce variety. I tried Chicago Q, and there was really no comparison. This place is a BBQ must."
"Everything here is delicious.  The ribs are amazing, the brisket, the pulled pork, the sides, the cobbler, etc.... If you have a taste for BBQ, go here!  it is worth the wait and you can drink the beer that you brought while you wait in line.You can't have it too much as the food is pretty rich and it stays with you all day...you smell like smoke, you burp smoke, you taste smoke.  Actually went here on a date....bad idea!  It is the least romantic thing one can do.  So I like to go here with my family when they come into the city."
Awesome. Enough said!!
I love this place. I've been there several times and they fail to disappoint. The last time I ordered from them was when it was my husband's birthday. I went through their catering office and they listened to all my needs. The party was a success! You haven't had bbq ribs until you've gone to Smoque!!
"I was told by numerous people that Smoques had the best brisket they've ever had. I'm convinced it's because those people never had good brisket.Smoques meats are in fact tender. They cook them for 15 hours so they can't screw that up. But they're pretty flavorless. I mean I couldn't tell if was eating the beef or the napkin. It wouldn't have been so bad if they had better BBQ sauce. I guess that's a thing of preference, as the person I was with appreciates vinegar based sauce and I'm more fond of tomato based sauces as they have more flavor. And something strong was needed to help this poor beef. The pulled pork was nothing to write home about. I've made better pulled pork in my oven.The sides were decent. The mac and cheese was pretty good, but they give it to you in a container the size of a bottle cap. The fries were hard and over-cooked. The links were okay, once again nothing special. Overall, not horrible, but definitely overrated. I have no desire to go back. I have yet to enjoy any of the hyped chicago eateries that everyone seem to enjoy."
"Yumitty-yum-yum-yum!!!  This BYOB restaurant was a card in our ""a-la-card"" deck and was the first card we used.  They were out of their brisket the night we went, but that wasn't my first choice anyhow so no biggee.  The staff was super-nice and made sure we were well aware they were out of brisket before we got in line.The line was long, but it moved quickly.  The staff was fabulous and set us up with a table and high chair ready after we placed our order.  Again we had to spend $25 to get $10 off so we ordered a full pulled pork sandwich a half pulled pork sandwich a rack of ribs and a side of sausage (for our son).  Everything was delicious!  Right down to the mountain of fries, the cole slaw and the sauce.  The wait from a line to the door to placing our order was probably about 12 minutes.  We then waited maybe another 8 minutes for our food.  Excellent efficiency for a restaurant that was absolutely packed.Not too close to us, but this one isn't too far either and is worth the drive.  We will definitely go back."
I absolutely LOVE SMOQUE BBQ!! Unfortunately I can only eat here when I have time because the place is ALWAYS PACKED!!!! And with good reason.If you've never been here I URGE YOU to try it ONCE!!!! You'll be hooked.I am!!!
"Get the sliced brisket! It's so tender it won't even stay on you fork! Being from Tennessee and living there for 25 years of my life I like to think I know my BBQ. This place is so good all around! The food and the friendly staff. If you live here in Chicago and haven't tried this place, do it! If your in town visiting and have time to make a stop here you won't be disappointed. Just know that's its BYOB and cafeteria style seating arrangement. The patio is great on a warm summer night. Be prepared to wait on the weekend."
"Get the sliced brisket.  It is super tender and juicy - a one of a kind melt in your mouth goodness.  The mac & cheese side was also delicious.  Homemade mac & cheese is a hit or miss and this one definitely hit the nail on the head.  Creamy, cheesy, delicious."
Meh. Maybe my expectations were too high. Staff was fantastic though. Got the half and half full slab it was okay but nothing to write home about. Skip the peach cobbler if you go.
It simply doesn't get any better.  The best BBQ in the city.
"Best. BBQ. Ever.The staff was very helpful in making sure our group of 6 was seated together, no mean feat, considering how busy the place was. The staff also does a good job keeping things moving, without trying to rush one out of the place. As for ambiance, well, it's a BBQ joint. I saw families and people from every walk of life. It can be a bit loud in there, with everyone talking. (Which kinda surprised me. The food is so great, you'd think you'd only hear moans of ecstasy, but yeah, some people actually manage to talk!)I had the sliced beef brisket and St. Louis ribs.  It was an orgasmic experience. The brisket was buttery and falling-apart tender. The ribs (being ribs) were slightly less so but oh-so-tasty! I preferred the dipping sauce that came with the ribs to that for the brisket, but both were really damn tasty.I especially appreciated the fact that you can order ""A taste"" portions which is great if you want to try EVERYTHING or are trying to watch the calories.Would I go back? Yes, in a heartbeat. And drag my friends. And people off the street.  Great food for a very reasonable price. Go there. FYI, they have kids' menu items too.Also, drink is BYOB, with no corking fee. So I had mead with my BBQ.YUM! Go there."
Best BBQ in Chicago!!!
My wife and I are from California and we were in Chicago for the weekend at the time craving for something a really good place to eat. This place is great! I don't really know what else to say about this place that has not been said yet within the thousands of reviews by fellow yelpers. My wife and I had the pulled pork and tri tip brisket with Mac n cheese coleslaw. The tri-tip is so tender it just crumbles. The pulled pork was the best I've ever had (and I've been to quite a few of BBQ restaurants). Sides are pretty good as well. I love their Mac n cheese.This place has won quite a few awards for their BBQ and has also been featured on food network.
"Eat the Brisket!  Eat the Brisket!  I thought it beat out the Pulled Pork.  Love their sides.  Incredible baked beans.  Weird I know, but I'm not really a fan of mac n cheese, but my friends tell me it is incredible here.  Place is small so lines do form at all times, but seem to move relatively quickly.  You can also do pick up too."
"This place is ok. The brisket was very tender, but you really need the sauce, otherwise there isn't a whole lot of flavor there. And the sauce is hit or miss. They eyeball it when making it, so sometimes it is perfect, other times it is wayyyy to acidic. Went on a Thursday afternoon and there was pretty much no wait."
"All winter long I had heard of Smoque BBQ: first on the Food Network and next on ""Check Please!"" When the weather started to turn, the call of barbeque was simply too strong to resist.  I started looking for excuses to travel to Irving Park to gorge myself on sumptuous barbeque.  I finally got my chance this last week.When my girlfriend and I walked into Smoque, we were immediately greeted by a friendly staff person who helped us place our order and reserved a place for us to sit.  I thought that this was a nice touch, since it seems that Smoque can get crowded in a hurry.We ordered the Texas brisket, pulled pork, and a half-slab of St. Louis ribs.  We also ordered baked beans, cornbread, and macaroni and cheese as sides.Let's start with the good.  The brisket was cooked perfectly.  One thing that I really liked is that the meats were not drowned in barbeque sauce a priori.  The sauce is given separately for the diner to freely decide how much or how little he wants to use.  As a person who wants to taste the meat above all else, I really applaud Smoque for this decision.  The sides were also pretty good.  The mac and cheese was the standout among the sides we ordered.  The beans were altogether too sweet for my taste--so much so that I couldn't eat more than one bite.Now, for the bad.  The brisket, while cooked perfectly, was under-seasoned.  The pulled pork and ribs were very disappointing: both were severely dry.  My girlfriend almost choked on the pulled pork because it was so difficult to swallow.  Both the pulled pork and the ribs were a far cry from the best that I've ever had.I am so sad to say that I cannot recommend Smoque because of the quality of the food.  The service and prices are spot on, but they really need to put some work into perfecting their barbeque.Food: 2/5Service: 5/5Price: 4/5"
"Delicious! I am not a mac & cheese girl, but their mac & cheese is awesome. Their chicken and ribs are just so finger licking good. I am getting hungry just thinking about it!  Everytime I have been there it's pretty busy, goes to show how good it is. Yum!"
Love Smoque! The food is great and I like the atmosphere. I have gotten lucky and not gone when the line has been too long. I love a good plate of BBQ! I usually eat the pork or the brisket and I love the slaw!
"Very good experience.  Above average food.  Not a place to go for ""Dining"".  There is pressure to eat your food and get out..."
"Best in the Midwest. Thanks Barry, Great to meet you."
Go there
"great bbq. We drove there to get togo food, thinking we would check out the place while we waited.  Line out the door at 4pm on a sunday, so I tried calling in the food since I knew what we wanted.  We were quoted a 1hr 50 min wait time, even after I told her I was outside the building.  Line took about 30 mins and we were on our way.  Well worth the wait.Sauces were phenomenal. 5/5 baby back ribs were 4/5, a little dry, but overall impressive.pulled pork sandwich 5/5brisket 5/5beans 5/5 mac/cheese 5/5service 3/5"
"Ok, so this place made me fall in love with BBQ. I was so hesitant to go because I am not a BBQ fan (Weird, I know, but I dont usually like the stickiness of it). I got the beef and it was incredible. It has been 5 long months since I have been here and can hardly wait to go back. Beware that on a weekend there will probably be a line, we waited probably 15-20 minutes but it was definitely worth it. The BBQ sauce they use is out of this world, I even took the small amount I had left home so my family could try it!"
"I love Guy Fieri and Diners/Drive-ins/ Dives.  So this place was definitely on my list to check out.  I really enjoy this place for going all out on their sides. I'm a flavor junkie. I like to taste it all, but I don't have the stomach capacity for ""all you can eat."" So this place works! It's great to share with other people.  I'll usually split a full slab of ribs and share the small sides. I really enjoy what this place has to offer, but I feel sometimes there's a hit-or-miss feel.  Once I've went and the meat was a bit dried out.  Sometimes the bbq sauce was too much tang and not enough sweet. Cornbread not quite as hot as it should be....But still. I do like the place and it's definitely worth the check out.  Just be forewarned. You may have a long wait for dinner hours, so try and head out to this place around lunchtime.  Otherwise an early dinner (like 4-5). Seating is a little tight, so don't be surprised to share side-by-side seating like you would in a highschool cafeteria. I love love clean hands.  Kinda too bad that they don't have little antibacterial hand wipes that other places do.Still. I've had some terrible ribs.  This place is pretty good--- although not exactly amazing."
"Smoque BBQ represents a new era of food to Chicago. In the past couple of years, Chicago has been seeing an influx of true BBQ restaurants; we're no longer tied to just a par boiled rib slathered in BBQ and then slapped onto a grill. Smoque is the real deal.Amongst the BBQ restuarants in Chicago that I've tried (The Patio, County BBQ, and out in Wheaton, Steamboat BBQ) Smoque is arguably the best. When you go to Smoque's you will immediately see an incredibly full dining room and probably a ridiculous line. This is always a good sign to me. There is very little service involved here, walk up menu and then a host will seat you (""host"" being a loose term as they are the waterboys, they clean and they help people line up if its getting crazy). When your order is ready you get up and get it, so again, service doesn't mean much here. That being said I've found everyone there very helpful and kind, though busy.The food is the main attraction of course and when I went to Smoque I had the BBQ Rib Combo. I wanted to try both the baby backs and the St. louis ribs. The St. Louis style ribs are much better, some how more tender and definitely more flavorful. Full of smoke and pork flavor and deliciously meaty (they're not too thin but thinner than the baby backs for sure). I was very happy with the baby backs as well due to the real smoke flavor however if you are deciding between the two, save yourself the trouble and get a full slab of St. Louis ribs. I will note however, that both ribs were a bit dry on the edges. I attribute this to the inconsistencies of BBQ smoking. This is not an easy thing to avoid when you are cranking out many racks of ribs a day so I let it slide (especially since this may be the most faithful BBQ representation in the area). However as time goes on I expect this to get better. The BBQ sauce they serve with the ribs is also very good; smokey and sweet. I did not find any hot BBQ sauce but you might have to ask for it; I hear they have some off menu add-ons that you just have to know about. For the sides I had coleslaw, beans and fries. All of which were very good. The beans were smokey with quite a bit of bacon bits and the coleslaw was actually excellent. It was my favorite side. The slaw was not the creamy kind you normally get from BBQ restaurants, it was tangy and refreshing. The fries were also good but honestly I don't really care too much about the difference between fries as long as they're crispy and tasty.Overall, Smoque's is great representation of what is possible for BBQ in Chicago. We're long overdue for real BBQ flavor and I'm hoping that Smoque's only gets better over time. Here's to more BBQ in the area!Also, if you're from UIUC and are trying to compare to Black Dog's, in terms of ribs I still prefer Black Dog's but they give you less meat and they're more expensive compared to Smoque's. As for brisket I only tried a little bit here at Smoque's but I think Smoque's has Black Dog's beat."
"DYING. Just...dying.This place is beyond amazing. Maybe I'm a tad bias because one of the owners lives down the block from me but regardless Smoque is worth the wait, worth the money, worth its weight in gold. Not only is their meat high in quality and taste, but it's unbelievably satisfying. It's like a little getaway in your mouth.My mother bought some pulled pork and chili for a family dinner last night and boy was it decadent. They even gave us their rolls to make sandwiches with. I had to reheat my meat since I came home late but even then it was to-die-for. You know something's good when it tastes amazing even when it's microwaved! Only gripe is that the sauce is kinda watery, but the upside to that is that the bread sops up the sauce that much better, making every bite count. Also wish they would've given us more sauce, I could've used it to dip some random things in...it is THAT good. Just do me a favor and get your tush over to Smoque. You won't regret it! Plus the owner donated tons of food to our annual block party where we live...so you know the guys have some heart, too! PS: to the person who said it's in a bad neighborhood...what are you, nuts? People, you'll be fine parking and walking around here. The fact that I live just a few blocks away just kinda insults me. Oh well, go back to your suburb if you feel better there."
"You can't go wrong with Smoque.  When I have a bad day at work and am driving up North, a slab of the ribs plus sides really brings it all back.  If you want to stop in for lunch, the pulled pork with fries is great.  Side sauces are great for dipping the fries also."
"Man to be honest I'm split between Smoque and Urban BBQ in the suburbs.  Love the brisket and ribs.  Mac and cheese is delicious.  If i'm in the area, smoque is definitely an option.  But I think I will have to give to Urban BBQ's burnt ends."
"I know that people probably wonder if this place lives up to its hype, but I think that it does. Coming from Michigan, I always make sure my trips to Chicago include a trip into Smoque. And, I will say that it never disappoints.  Went there with a group of friends this past weekend who all left fans of this place. I highly recommend the brisket. I always get it and I'm always happy. Two of the guys got the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich, which is half pulled pork and half brisket. They both loved the sandwich. The mac and cheese at this place is pretty decent, but the baked beans are better. The other thing I would suggest is that if you're like me and you're into spice- ask for the spicy barbeque sauce and the pickled jalapenos. I never KNEW how much this would up the flavor factor of my sandwich until I slathered this BBQ sauce and topped the jalapenos...I will never go back to a plain brisket sandwich here. The only thing I would suggest? A place to take naps :) Cause I really needed one after having a very full belly."
"Unreal. Fantastic. Phenomenal. Best BBQ I've had in Chicago (I've lived here a little over a year). The only criticism I have is that the place can get packed on the weekends, so be prepared to wait a bit."
"Southern sightseers may scoff at this Chicago smokehouse, but we swear by their sauces and sliced brisket. The sides are swell, but they're a bit small."
"a 1 hour wait in line in march in chicago to get my grub of bbq is something i am willing to do. but at the other end of the line i expect to be delighted. sadly, i was not. it was ordinary. nothing out of the way except the peach cobbler which i sincerely adored. st louis was underwhelming than the baby back which was smokier. if i must i wud try the baby back.the cornbread - nothing memorable.the beans - i liked the sweetness. may be too sweet for some.the chicken - it was flavorless but that's coz it;s chckn, not the fault of the place.the brisket - it was okay. in my head i was longing for lean.in all, i imagine the high ratings are attributed to the lack of a comparable bbq place in chicago than the superiority of the product."
"Excellent BBQ. Pulled pork and brisket.  Mac-n-cheese - check, peach cobbler - check, vinegar style cole slaw - check.  All dee-lish.  Order the pulled pork often for Superbowl, block parties, etc."
"Great food - very informal atmosphere - may have to wait for a table, but food is worth every effort! Try the pulled pork and BYOB or W!"
Love Smoque BBQ. Best BBQ I've had in Chicago yet. You cannot go wrong w/ a pulled pork sandwich with a taste of smoked sausage. Amazeballs.
"First I must say, I was not excited to get BBQ.  Unfortunately, I worked in a rib place in my teens and am still traumatized by the smell of smoked meats.  Smoque is completely different then every other BBQ place in the city.  In Chicago, it is all the norm to expect sweet, thick sauced baby back ribs, not at Smoque my friend.  We are talking about a vinegar based sauce, which I'm told (mainly by the Food network) that is common in the Carolinas.  Vinegar in BBQ? Its good, its really good and the ribs are tender, try the St. Louis style ribs, COME ON JUST DO IT!  Fries, always fresh, cole slaw (mixed with a vinegar based sauced) is refreshing not creamy and heavy, and if you go and don't get a peach cobbler, you need to be smacked! JK"
My all-time favorite BBQ.  The sliced brisket can NOT be beaten!!!
"I've had this place bookmarked for weeks and finally was in the area and hungry on top of it!Parking was a breeze - there is plenty of parking on Avondale, which is less than a block away. We came in at 3 PM on a Saturday. Seemed like a random time, too late for lunch and too early for dinner, but the line was out the door. The wait did not turn out to be very long, because Smoque is very well staffed.We ordered the pulled pork and brisket platters. Both were very tender and flavorful. The portions are not big, but keep in mind that the flavor itself is enough to satisfy hunger. Fries were decent as was the mac & cheese. The beans were a bit too sweet for me, but hey, it's just preference. The coleslaw was really nothing to write home about, but it seemed like a healthier option over the usual cream based.I wish I would have tried the peach cobbler everyone is raving about - maybe next time.The dining experience is cafeteria style. We jumped at the first available standalone table - I don't like eating next to strangers... Anyway, that's why I'm taking away a star. I wish the ambiance was a bit more comfy and it would be great if they found a way to incorporate some outside seating.Oh, the drinks come with free refills!"
"OK, so I have heard so much about Smoque that I finally got to try it today for lunch since I was working in the area. I had the 1/2 and 1/2 platter with brisket and pulled pork with a side of fries and mac and cheese. The brisket was good but It was not the best I have had. Many people on here did not like the fries. I thought the fries were crispy and good. The mac and cheese was OK but then again I am from a family that has been making REAL MAC AND CHEESE for decades. First I have to say that I have had alot of BBQ in my life from my family and restaurants. To be honest since I have family members that have been cooking BBQ for decades I have not found any place that I feel is as good as what my family makes.I am not here to bash Smoque but just give my opinion of what my taste buds like. I grew up on the south side of the city so I can assure you that there are quite a few BBQ joints that are really good.  The difference between Smoque and other BBQ joints is that the real BBQ joints have just a few tables and maybe some stools but most of the time you have to stand and eat.  Also Smoque has the power of advertising and yelp definitely helps. Real neighborhood joints don't advertise, you either know about them or you don't. Also lets face it, a lot of people will not go to the south side. Hyde Park is as far as some people go or have ever been. With that being said people are really missing good BBQ in the city.I thought Smoque was decent and I think it is a welcome addition to the North side for BBQ. Keep in mind that this is just my opinion. I would never bash a restaurant because I think that we all have different taste buds. I had a place in North Chicago/Waukegan area called Big Ed's and let me tell you that I loved Big Ed's better than Smoque but I am sure that there are people who would go to Big Ed's and say that it was just ok and they like Smoque better. So just go and decide yourself whether or not it is good BBQ."
"Love, love, love this place. Seriously, love this place. I have literally tried everything on the menu within the multiple visits. EVERYTHING is authentic, amazing and is the ultimate BBQ in the city. If you do go, brisket, ribs, peach cobbler and the mac 'n' cheese are absolute musts. I drive all the way in from Elgin just to make this place happen."
"food was tasty and delicious. local was inconvenient, not really a ton of parking and very congested area. but none the less great food!"
"Visiting my friends in Chicago, they told us that we HAD to eat here at some point during my trip.  A week prior to my arrival, another friend was visiting a week early before we all met up for a convention.  She almost had Smoque everyday that week!!  All she could talk about was this place when I got picked up from the airport.A couple days before I had to leave Chicago....we stopped by here.  And WOW.... was it frikkin DELICIOUS!!  We had the pulled pork.... everyone in our group chose the pulled pork.  The place was packed so since our friend lived only a couple streets away, we took a couple bags back to her place and began to stuff our face!I am definitely always going to stop for some pulled pork here every time I travel to Chicago!!"
"This is by far, the best BBQ I've had in my life. I ate every single thing we had on the plate!The first thing we had was the Memphis-Style Baby Rack Ribs which were amazing. Succulent in flavor, great crispy burnt texture on the outside, but soft tender meet you can bite off the bone on the inside. Next, the Sliced Brisket was so, so tender and every little bite had a burst of flavor. The outside was nice and burnt, crispy but the rest of the meat was so soft and juicy. I know I'm making all the Texas Rudy's BBQ fans cry by saying this, but I never liked the brisket there and therefore resigned in thinking I just didn't like BBQ. So in a way...Smoque has changed my (bbq) life.I loved the BBQ sauce as well, tangy and meshed well with the meat. Damn. I could swim in that sauce. The sides we ordered were the Mac & Cheese, Peach Cobbler, Coleslaw, and the Corn Bread. Where do I even start? The smalls were a bit too small, it's meant for one person but we ordered a lot of sides to share. I really enjoyed the Coleslaw because it wasn't your traditional Coleslaw - it's not made with mayo at all, instead it is made with a vinaigrette which helps to lighten up and balance the meal and the rest of the more heavier sides. Even the Mac & Chese wasn't that heavy though, just the right amount of cheese, not too much. No complaints about the Corn Bread. And lastly, the Peach Cobbler was the perfect ending to our meal. I don't even know how to describe it other than I've never had Peach Cobbler like that before.Besides the food, this place has no atmosphere. It's in a weird location, located off the beaten path in a small neighborhood. The service is good though. The line is ridiculous but if you go later, it's shorter. Smoque is definitely worth the wait though."
YUMMY!!!!!!!!!
"4 stars despite the fact, calorically, I can't eat here regularly."
"Saw this place on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives a couple years ago and have been waiting to get back to Chicago to taste it. All I gotta say is AWESOME!I got the taste portions of the pork, sliced brisket, and a texas sausage with a side of the beans (which were the most interesting to me on the TV spot) and a cornbread muffin. I've never had better meats and the sauces tasted good although I didn't want to mess up the flavor of the meat so I went mostly dry. The sausage wasn't as spicy of a link as I prefer, but the perfect smoke flavor more than made up for that.Absolutely worth the hype. I don't subscribe to hype, just to taste and it was perfect.Enjoy!"
BBQ done right!
The pulled pork was delish...i was not a fan of their bbq sauce...i know I am in the minority on this one.
"Any time I crave BBQ, I always convince my hubby to ride out to Smoque.  I have yet to try something that tastes ""just ok.""  Everything tastes so good!"
I have yet to find another barbecue establishment as good as Smoque. Their presence almost makes me forget about the departure of my beloved Brother Jimmy's.
"En lieu of the Super Bowl, a close bud and I decided to head to Smoque and consume mass quantities of meat, assuming that once the game started the typical crowds would diminish.  And hot damn we were right!  We walked in and were second in line to order.  For me, there was still a competitive element to the experience even if we weren't watching the game - I am slowly making my way to all the popular BBQ joints of Chicago, and eventually I will be able to claim my favorite.  Let the competition begin...I've mentioned in BBQ reviews passed that I consider myself a decent judge of BBQ character if you will.  Yea, yea, I know what you're thinking ""everyone says that.""  Let me list my credentials:-Dad owns a BBQ restaurant and is Kansas City BBQ certified.-Sister lives in TX - So I've had my fair share of TX meats at Rudy's and Salt Lick just to name a couple of many.-Kansas City at one time acted as my second home.  Whenever in town I would eat BBQ for lunch and dinner...not a gross exaggeration - well, it's gross...but not really.  I love meat, kiddos!  I've sampled Arthur Bryant, OK Joe's (My favorite - the Z Man sandwich OMG - is this what heaven is like?), Gates...and so on.  -I'm not fancy - as in, I walk into Lillie's Q and I'm like ""whoa...what's this...where's the line?  Why so fancy?""  BBQ places should feel like a joint...or a dining hall where people from Defiance, OH have their wedding receptions (I was born there, I can make fun - you, on the other hand should not).Smoque was exactly what I thought it would be - a BBQ joint, no frills, divine brisket, ribs, and sausage (and probably pulled pork and chicken but they ran out due to the abundance of Super Bowl orders received), delicious sides, and it's BYOB so I got to enjoy it all with some Begyle American Pale Ale, and a Hop Whoopin'.   Honestly guys, the brisket was the best I've had in Chicago no contest...perfectly smoked and tender with delicious burnt bits here and there.  So why not five stars?  Well, I have one sizable pet peeve about BBQ restaurants - no sauce on the tables or at the very least readily available at my discretion.   Before visiting Smoque I had only experienced this at one other establishment - Smokin' Woody's.   Never.... NEVER in TX or KC...or at my pop's restaurant where BBQ is available on tables and/or in pumps where you can dispense your own into cups.  Perhaps I missed pumps that may have been near the fountain soda station?  But I don't believe this was the case judging by my half filled plastic cup of sauce served with my meal.   When my sauce DID run out (because let's be honest, it always does when rationed like that)  I worried, ""Are they going to charge me for BBQ sauce...at a BBQ restaurant?!""  Please say it ain't so!!   This was the case for Smokin' Woody's and I have never been back.  It's unforgivable.  Does McDonald's charge for ketchup?  Hot Doug's for mustard? But what really bugs about the no BBQ sauce readily available is the inconvenience of stopping mid-meal to get up and get more, most likely having to wait for whoever may be ordering at the counter at the time to finish.  All the while my delicious meats get cold.  Additionally, it appears they have two types of BBQ sauce but I have no idea if I was served the Original or the Spicy.  I would have liked to try both, but in the end tried....?????  No idea.  I cannot confirm whether I would have been charged for additional sauce.  I never wanted to leave my meat to ask which speaks to how amazing the food is (or rather, what an oinker I am).  But Smoque, I've gotta know - what gives with this set up?   It left this BBQ fan a bit disappointed."
Really good BBQ! Really good everything!
"Delicious, love the brisket. I grew up in Texas, and this is the closest I've had in Chicago. The owners and employees are awesome, always friendly and accommodating. Call ahead if you're gonna take out, you get to skip the line."
Absolutely no complaints! The best BBQ I've had in quite sometime (other than my fathers).  The baked beans and mac n cheese are decent but what keeps bringing me back is definitely the half chicken A+++.  My advice is to either get there early (because its always packed standing room only) or order take out unless you like waiting an hour to eat. Its definitely worth it!
"This place claimed to have ""Southern-style bbq,"" and being a Southerner, I thought ""I'll be the judge."" Well, let me tell you....this is Smack-yo-mama bbq. It is wonderful! As soon as I walked in the door the first time, I thought to myself, ""This smells like home."" Usually, bbq is reserved for cookouts, and July 4th-like holidays. But this place makes it completely accessible all the time. The classic pulled pork sandwich is what I got, and my friend got the brisket. Both...UH-MA-ZING! And their slaw is SO good. I mean...SOOOOO good. Take it from a Southerner...go there, and go there, and go there."
"Just went back to Smoque again this past weekend during the Blues Festival, and it still rocks my socks. One of the best gems on the NW side of the Chi, and not a ""hidden gem"" anymore by any means!The BBQ was still chargrilled to perfection. The meat had the right fattiness and came off the bones easy. I had the 1/2 slab St. Louis and 1/2 slab Baby Back combo. $23 OTD, but worth every penny.The sides (Mac & Cheese and cornbread) were still piping hot and small enough to not fill you up (so that you enjoy the awesome MEAT). Oh and this place is STILL BYOB with no extra ""corking"" fees to exploit it. Yep! My group and I brought in a fifth and a 6 pack of beers, and boy was it great to sit down and drink that to get a nice summer buzz going before eating :-) $25 liquor store tab sure beats a $125 bar tab! LOLGo Smoque! This is what great BBQ in the Midwest is all about. I wish that the mandatory slaw was replaceable with any of their other sides though."
I thought it was alright.... im more of a smoke daddy kinda guy i suppose
"Really good! I've had the pulled pork sandwich and the ribs so far and really enjoyed them both. The mac and cheese is a great side and the cobbler is so good I have to hide it from my boyfriend when I order so he doesn't eat mine! Definitely going to try again, maybe the chicken next time..."
My old office was a few blocks away from Smoque.  It was a delight to lunch there regularly. It got a bit crowded after the Food Network exposure but the food stayed tasty. Chatting with the owner and anybody of staff was also a pleasure.
"Smoque catered my Backyard BBQ engagement party two weeks ago. I'm still getting phone calls asking where we catered from because everyone LOVED the food. From the very beginning Smoque made everything so easy. It's hard to find a place that will deliver to the suburbs, but I called and discussed how much food they thought I'd need and worked with me without any problems. When I called a couple weeks later to say that our guest count had gone down they had no problem reducing the amount of food I ordered. I even told them that I didn't want to use their buns and they were fine with that and suggested how much I should get to make sure I had enough. Setting up the day of the party they arrived on time and made sure everything looked nice and organized. The food was delicious and many people went up many times for more helpings. I love eating the food at Smoque but I definitely recommend their catering if you're looking for someone to provide food for any sized party!"
"Smoque, without a doubt is the best barbecue in the city.   I've never had anything there that wasn't absolutely awesome. I recommend the pulled pork, hot links, and Mac and Cheese--my favorite ever. The prices are right, staff is friendly, and the swine is delightful. Keep it up, Smoque!"
"Pretty good food, went there few times. I didn't like it when it was a Superbowl since I believe they had the ribs pre made from the day before. Which is understandable since the line was going around the block. Have to try if you are in the area tho"
"What Smoque does well - BBQ. What Smoque does not do well - Carryout service. I called at 7:50 last night and placed an order. The guy on the phone said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I got there at 8:13 and apparently they had not even started filling my order. I paid, then they started making my order thus rendering calling ahead pointless. At 8:28 my order was ready and sitting on the counter. After waiting for name to be called, I walked over and asked if that was my order to which the woman at the counter said ""ohhh, I didn't know you were here."" Ummm, you would have known if you had simply called my name or order number. That's ok, people screw up, no big deal but at least have the decency to say ""I'm sorry that we're 25 minutes late in getting this order to you"" or something to that effect. Someday businesses will learn that apologies cost them nothing to give, while withholding them definitely cost them business."
"This is a cafeteria-style interior restaurant that employs passionate people who deliver on the promises of a home-cooked meal off of a line. Everything you try here will taste like authentic barbecue, including the mac and cheese."
"This is by far the best barbeque food I have eaten. The meat is always tender and the sauce is excellent. The cobbler dessert is great. Sometimes the lines are a bit long, but I haven't had to wait very long. This place is so worth it!"
Damn this place is so good
Smoque has amazing food and sides and is my go to BBQ spot but today I was even more pleasantly surprised by their service. I really wanted some of their delicious peach cobbler and I called in to pick up and they told me it would be an hour wait. I was put on hold and when the  guy came back to the phone he told me to come in and ask for the awesome owner Mike and he was going to get me some peach cobbler quickly AND gave it to me for free! awesome customer service and awesome food!
We have gotten carry out and also had an event catered by Smoque and they are a #1 class operation.  It is also the best barbeque in Chicago.  The brisket and ribs are our favorites and the kids love the macaroni and cheese.
This was well worth the trip we saw Smoque on DDD and my husbands mouth was a bucket - it did not disappoint.  We were there last time in Chicago and will be on the list to visit in August
I recommend this place.  The food is good.  Try it.  I don't understand some of the more negative reviews.
"I basically starved myself all weekend in anticipation of my mini-feast at Smoque.And I'm so glad I did. Because I ate, ate and then ate some more. First of all, I think you'd be hard-pressed to walk into this joint at a time it isn't busy. On a Sunday afternoon around 4, the restaurant was full with a growing line. There's communal seating, which definitely helps speed things along. As we placed our order, our seats were pointed out to us. Within 10 minutes, our order number was called and we entered BBQ heaven.I had the pulled pork platter, which is basically a heaping pile of juicy, tender meat which I topped with the super vinegar-y cole slaw. The acidity of the cool slaw really balanced out the smoky flavors of the meat. The platter also comes with two additional sides-- albeit small, both the cornbread and peach cobbler pack a tasty punch.The sad part is that I could have kept eating after my mound of food disappeared! Luckily, my dining partner didn't judge and was kind enough to let me sample his divine brisket which was also soon gone, baby, gone.I still prefer Honky Tonk as I like their seating better but Smoque is a bit more accessible to me and let's face it, also rather delicious. And, Smoque is BYO!"
"DELICIOUS. Went on a Saturday afternoon and it was a long wait, but SO worth it. Quick and efficient service. By God, the best ribs in town."
"I've been meaning to try this place out for a while given all the praise it gets and finally got the chance a while back.  A group of us ordered a handful of items for take-out and everything lived up to the hype.  We had the baby back ribs, the St. Louis ribs, and the brisket.  The baby back ribs rivaled ribs I've had anywhere else, but the real star for me were the St. Louis ribs.  They were meatier and juicier than their baby back equivalents and with extra barbeque sauce they were to die for.  The brisket was excellent as well, fall apart tender with great smoke and beef flavor.  I was also a big fan of the vinegary sauce that came along with the brisket.  As for the sides, I enjoyed the mac and cheese which was cheesy, creamy and everything a good mac and cheese should be.  However, the side I enjoyed the most was the peach cobbler.Chicago may not be a mecca for barbeque like Memphis or Kansas City, but Smoque is definitely a stand out."
"This place is legit.   I can`t claim to be a BBQ connoisseur, but I experienced some good Q when I was in Texas and this place is at least on par with the great joints down there.  Nice sized portions, great flavor, and the meat is cooked just right.   If not for the wait, I`d probably give it 5 stars."
"cold food + awkward seating = Smoque did not live up to my expectations.I went here last night after hearing great things about the place. When we first walked in there was a sign warning that they would run out of pulled pork soon. Seeing as this is what I came to eat, it was pretty annoying that they would run out of one of their most popular items. When we did get to the register, it took them awhile, but they decided they had enough pulled pork left for one sandwich. I was happy that I was going to be able to eat!After ordering my boyfriend and I were seated very quickly, but I was squished between a pair of Chicago police officers and an overweight couple. So this was annoying and awkward. Holding a conversation was difficult being in such close proximity to the other people, and being bumped by the man next to me multiple times made it even worse. Now I know why they can seat people so quickly- no one wants to stay and eat when it means you are forced into dining 3 inches away from complete strangers. Once my food came, I was just looking forward to eating. But, my sandwich was cold. Cold pulled pork is disgusting!!! Obviously, this was very disappointing. Since the place is so crowded as rushed, and they had ran out of pulled pork, asking them to fix it seemed unlikely. Overall, if Smoque would have served me a good meal I could have gotten over the other annoyances, but when you can't even serve me my (overpriced) sandwich at an acceptable temperature, you fail.PS- Don't order small ala carte sides. What a joke! For $2.25 I got about 2 tablespoons of mac and cheese. Lame. (At least that was hot though.)"
"Ah, it's so true what Poe said--anticipation IS a turn-on (of course, Balzac said that ""all miseries lie in anticipation,"" but who listens to the French anymore?).  I've been looking forward to a return visit in general for almost a year, and to today's visit for almost two weeks.  And goddamn, it was so satisfying.Half slab of baby back ribs + Texas sausage + sliced brisket + fries + barbecue beans + cole slaw = well...let's just say a decent-sized lunch.  I could have eaten more, but I have to show SOME restraint, right?  Actually, I intended to order the peach cobbler but forgot.  And then I was too intent on my own food to snare a bite of my friend's before she finished.  Next time!Ribs A, brisket B+, sausage B, fries A, beans A-, slaw B+, pulled pork A-.  I still love the tangy sauce and the people are still super friendly.  Thank me for coming?  No no, sir--thank YOU for enticing me here and feeding me so well."
"We had a party catered by Smoque for our company CEO's 50th birthday. It was extroardinary, and I have been wanting to go back ever since!"
"It was ok, but to me a tad over - rated. I had the pulled pork and Chris had the brisket. It was tender, but without a ton of sauce, we did not find the meat to be particularly flavorful. The slaw was ok, the fries average and the mac and cheese decent, but a small portion.I sure miss the old NN Smokehouse on Irving Park Rd. Oh well. I'd meet friends here for a meal, but I would never wait in line for the food."
"my god, it's been forever since I've eaten from here. So when my friend texted me that he wanted to grab some smoque for pickup I naturally said of course. I put my eating boots on and got myself mentally prepared for the inevitable gorging that was about to happen.We ordered up a brisket platter with two sides of mac n cheese (I mean really, how do you not get down with their mac n cheese), a half slab of st louis ribs, and an order of brisket chilli. Well, all of the food got demolished when we got back (along with some of the food getting picked at in the car as well). The brisket was insanely tender and was falling apart left and right. The ribs were very good, but the chilli was awesome and the mac n cheese got inhaledIt was packed when we got there and I'm not used to ordering ahead, so I was looking around like a lost lamb at first and was looking at the big line that was at the door. I finally figured out to just go up to the register and in about 5 minutes or so I had our order and was out the door. When going here after 4pm, this is definitely the way to go, or else you'll be waiting in line like a sucker with everyone else"
"Basically... if I start eating meat again, this will be the first place I'd go. Best bbq in town hands down."
"My favorite BBQ in the city. The sauce is excellent, the pulled pork is especially good. There really isn't much else to say, you will not be disappointed."
"Finally had the pleasure to stop by here Sunday night!The negatives: Finding such an odd location and the parking can be difficult, and we had to wait about 30 minutes just to order and find seats. The location is extremely small, and I would definitely recommend ordering to go in order to avoid the seating hassle. The sides were OK, nothing out of this world. And since it was Sunday night, it was a little disappointing that there were no TVs for the football games. That would've complemented the ribs perfectly. The positives: Ordered the half slab of each: St. Louis and Babyback. I really liked their menu flexibility where you can add on ribs/brisket/other sides if you want to try something new. The prices were reasonable, and each order came with a substantial amount of food. The ribs were really tender and the brisket was scrumptious as well. I would recommend the brisket over the pulled pork sandwich, but they were both delicious so you can't go wrong."
Not much to say thats not been said. This is my fav bbq restaurant. Just go and try it.
"The brisket is indeed delicious, and the clear highlight of the meal. The remainder of the offerings that I tried we just a bit above ordinary. The pulled pork, while on the lean side, was a bit bland. A dousing with the BBQ sauce provided just lift things with too much vinegar flavor. The coleslaw is above average, not swimming in mayonaise, which is nice. Some good bread, rather than the squishy enriched white flour offering, would have gone a long way to bumping the joint up a star. Don't get me wrong, it is good - you can tell by the line of customers that have smiles despite a wait ... and the fact that I cleaned my plate."
"One word: AMAZING! One of the best bbq places I've ever had and I am def. picky about my bbq. Got here on a Sunday night with some friends at like 5pm and the line was already out the door which shows you something about the place. When my hubby asked me what I wanted because you have to order first and then have a seat, I said ""everything on the menu"" because the place just smelled of pure deliciousness. We had the baby back ribs and the pulled pork as main entrees which were both melt in your mouth yummy. The sides were even more incredible, whether the cole slaw or the amazing corn bread or the mac and cheese. Oh and the best side of all was the peach cobbler, crunch on top and gooey on the bottom. Oh em gee, we will be back for sure. The only negative is that the tables are kinda on top of one another, I would suggest expanding and bring this place to the suburbs!!!"
"The very best BBQ in Chicago, and probably one of my most favorites ever. Believe the other positive reviews because they are true. The meat quality is excellent- this is a huge part of what sets this place apart from other joints. I always get the pulled pork platter and it is always smoked perfectly, and the flavors are amazing. I LOVE the peach cobbler for desert, and their mac n' cheese, fries, and beans are good too. There is usually a long line, so I call in my order ahead of time and pick it up- it tastes just as good at home!"
"Really good brisket and pulled pork! The mac 'n cheese is SO good - so are the fries! The BBQ sauce they use is really tasty. My boyfriend likes their cornbread - I think it's just okay. Personally, I'm not a fan of their ribs and the line can get kind of long. Sandwiches come with cole slaw and one side, platters come with cole slaw and two sides. If you're like me and you're not a fan of cole slaw, ask and they'll let you swap it out for a different side! Love, love love the food and this place!"
Awesome barbeque and BYOB!  Prices are very reasonable as well.  What's not to love?
"It's not hard to believe that Smoque BBQ is one of the highest reviewed places in Chicago on Yelp.  My family and I went here for dinner the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  We had to wait outside because the line was kind of long and pretty busy.  Luckily Smoque supplies umbrellas for those waiting outside because it was raining.  A few minutes later we were inside and waiting to order.  The decor is nice, with the articles about Smoque from the New York Times as well as the Food Network from when Diners, Drive-ins and Dives came to film.  We got up to the counter and ordered.  I got the Pulled Pork Sandwich with a side of Mac 'N Cheese.  We moved out of the way and waited for the staff to find us a table for 7 people.  The Pulled Pork was the best Texas style that I have had!  It was the perfect ratio of Pulled Pork to sauce.  The Mac 'N Cheese was also great.  You can't go wrong with any of the food at Smoque BBQ.  My family headed outside to wait for my brother to bring the car around because of the rain.  The owner happened to walk outside to tell us we could wait inside, if we wanted to.  We ended up standing around the front talking about the restaurant and how the business runs.  He also explained how Smoque ended up with an article in the New York Times and the reason behind the umbrellas.  Smoque was a great experience.  I look forward to going back soon."
"Without question, the best barbecue in Chicago."
"It used to be excellent now it's just okay. I've had the ribs, brisket, chicken, mac n cheese, and fries."
The best BBQ in Chicago. If I could get a 1 lb tub of their mac and cheese and just have that for dinner I totally would.
"Smoque gets 5 stars because not only is everything on their menu delishible but they have ""seaters"" who find you a table and reassure you that when your food is ready, you will be able to sit. This is huge. It's like Hot Dougs in that respect, which to me shows you care about your customers. My biggest pet peeve is people who sit down to save a seat for their group before the group has ordered their food. So people who have already ordered but don't have someone to save a seat have to stand around and wait. Don't do this, you are an asshole if you do this. Their ribs are incredible, their brisket is incredible, their sausage is incredible, their pulled pork is incredible and their chicken is incredible.Their sides are the real stars though. I'd be just as satisfied eating a giant portion of their brisket chilli or french fries as I would their main dishes. It's BYOB, the line moves fast, and the afformentioned ""seaters"" don't fire up your order until you have a seat. And they have a list of who came in what order so it's a very orderly dining experience."
Best BBQ in the city although the side dishes make the meal. Get the peach cobbler!
"Its been a while since I have 5 starred a restaurant. i am ecstatic that this is the restaurant I am coming back with. Word of mouth, yelp reviews, passing by, aromas, etc. I HAD TO TRY THIS PLACE. We arrived and parking was plentiful and luckily got a spot in their parking lot. Arrive early because when they run out of ribs, you will be pissed. They line was almost out the door and we squeezed in and to my surprise, the manning behind the counter was moving like a well oiled machine. Employees had a line assembly thing going and the line was moving. We ordered the Pulled pork, and both the St. Louis and baby back ribs. On the side we chose, mac and cheese and coleslaw. It was communal style seating and hosts help accommodate us. My food was picture perfect. In fact, I took a few shots myself. I make the perfect bite consisting of my pulled pork sandwich and and some of the peppery slaw. The meat was juicy and tender accompanied by a warm soft bun and that slaw. Utterly amazing. The ribs were tender and fell right off the bone goodness. I was a little ashamed that I might need to do some bib action because I wanted to shove it all in my mouth and I didn't want to stain my new white tee. I refrained from making a bib from paper towels but I still ate like a maniac. The meat wasn't over powered by crazy spices and the flavor of the meat was very pronounced with the right amount of smoke.The sauces are all made from scratch. The BBQ sauce was sweet, tangy, and with the right amount of spice. The mac and cheese was light and fluffy, it didn't stand a chance. I might not be a BBQ queen, but I know what good food is...this is it! Its an experience that I want to relive over and over and over and over."
"Someone (I assume one of the owners) asked how I liked my food.  I told him the chicken was dry including the dark meat.  I mean DRY.  He told me they smoked it for 5 hours.  Well, that's why it's so DRY -- smoked 3 1/2 hours too long.  I was not offered a replacement or an apology.  My husband thought his brisket was good.  The fries and cole slaw were just okay.  This place is too crowded for the price and the quality of the food.  Just goes to show hype will get you everywhere."
"This is one of the best BBQ in Chicago! I have never been disappointed...sausage, brisket, pulled pork, and ribs have all been flavorful and quite delicious. One of my favorite places to eat!"
"My daughter and I saw this on Check Please and decided to check it out for real. I don't know much about great BBQ but I do know that was the best damn mac n cheese and BEANS I have ever tasted. The husband is picky about ribs but he was happy as can be, he said they were the best ribs he's had. I don't think my daughter said one word the whole meal, it was that good. I recommend the brisket, seems like that was everyones favorite.I was super impressed with their crowd management. My husband hates waiting in line so we tricked him into going here even though we knew there would be a wait. On a Saturday night at about 7:30 we waited outside for about 15 minutes. Once we got inside I was a little worried because this place is tiny. Every seat was taken and lots of people in line still. They asked us how many we needed to seat and I have no idea how they did it but they seated us as soon as our food was ready, and everyone else in line too. Amazing!The owner was standing at the door. When we left he asked us how it was and thanked us for coming. I love that, espcially since we drove over an hour just to try his restaurant, it's nice to be appreciated!"
"I've been to Texas, I've been to St Louis, I've been to Carolina's, I've been all over the south.  You will never, ever, find a better brisket than Smoque.  It's life-changing.  If this place had been open when Gandhi was alive, he'd have weighed 300 pounds.  It's that good.Oh - what's that?  They have other menu items, too?Yeah, but they're just fricking amazing, not soul-stealing like the brisket.  Just try it, if you don't love it, I will literally pay for your meal.** Figuratively.  I will not pay for your meal."
"Anytime you see a line out the door for food - eat there. People don't want to wait for ANYTHING, but most humans are intelligent enough to understand the concept of a worthy sacrifice. Fortunately the line wasn't out the door like I have seen, but there was enough of a line for people behind and in front of us to complain incessantly. The staff is prepared for the long lines, so if you can't deal with waiting and sitting next to strangers, do us all a favor and eat somewhere else. Four of us first-timers went for lunch yesterday - and it was tip top. I've always been a pulled pork guy but I went brisket and it was a very wise choice. Perhaps the ribs would have been even wiser but I am no Jedi yet.  Mac and cheese was above average, barbecue beans were amazing, cornbread was spot on. BBQ joints keep a line coming for their meats though - and Smoque's is some of the best anywhere."
"Love this place esp the mac n cheese & pulled pork sandwich ammazing though i really wish the mac serving was more then a few spoon fulls, then i would give 5 stars!"
"This is the top reviewed BBQ place in Chicago and locals love it.  We got a small sampling of their ribs, brisket, links, pulled pork, and chicken.  The links and chicken were forgettable, but the pulled pork is great.  We made stops for the best BBQ places in Chicago, St Louis, and Kansas City, and we felt that they had the best pulled pork of the places we visited.  The meat was juicy and it had good smoke flavor.  People love their ribs and I have to be honest - our first rack of their ribs was terrible.  This rack was dry and, though there was a discernible smoke ring, the smokey flavor wasn't deep.  We had a second rack of their ribs and it had a little more tenderness and flavor.  But our impression was heavily biased by that first rack of ribs.I would not recommend the brisket as it was dried out.  On my barbeque adventure through the Midwest, we have to admit that Smoque wasn't high on our list of places to check out.  But it fared pretty well when it compared to the best of St. Louis and Kansas City, which are towns that take pride in their BBQ."
Half my family are Carolina hillbilliy's.  I gotta say this the next best bbq to my granny's !
This is one of my favorite places to take friends who are visiting Chicago.  I'll often literally take them straight from O'Hare to Smoque.  Make sure to ask for the candied jalapenos to go along with your brisket.
"Can't wait to come back! Easily found parking right outside and luckily there was no line but it was pretty crowded for a Wednesday afternoon. I had the ribs, split it with the BF.  Good, but I like ribs saucy and this was a dry rub. But I tasted my bro's brisket and it was so tender. The mac and cheese is good and so are the fries.The sides seem kind of small, but I guess they make it to be portioned out. They're 'cute-sized'.  I can't wait to come again and try something else!"
"The BBQ at Smoque was good, but nothing extraordinary.  On the weekday afternoon I went, it wasn't overly crowded and took about 20 minutes from the time we stepped inside to the time we received our food (I was expecting an hour+ so I was pleasantly surprised). The pulled pork is soft and well bbqed and the meat from the ribs just fell off the bone.While I should probably remember the bbq from a BBQ joint, I don't.  I remember the mac & cheese.  Get an order of the mac & cheese, then get an extra order because it's that delicious."
Great place to eat.  Food is amazing.  You will usually have to wait up to a half hour but they keep things moving.  They will try to keep you happy when you are waiting to be seated.  It's byob so that's a plus if you enjoy an occasional beverage.  This is a must eat place if you live near or have easy access to the blue line.  I always take out of town visitors here and they are never disappointed.
"Love this place! Have tried the pulled pork, baby back ribs and the chopped brisket.  They are all delicious, my personal favorite probably the pulled pork.  The sauces also fit well with each dish.  The french fries as a side are crispy and delicious.  The peach cobbler also very tasty.  If you are going with a few people best to each get something different and share with each other to get a little bit of everything!!!"
"Very Good Bar B Que! You can get several dishes and it is done very well, all be it ala carte. I wish the layout were a bit different but a must not miss on the gastronomic tour of Chicago."
"Came here on a Saturday evening and didn't have to wait very long in line.  Woohoo!  I got a pulled pork platter, which comes with coleslaw and two sides (BBQ beans and mac and cheese).  The pulled pork was very tender and flavorful, but the temperature was on the cool side, so that was kind of disappointing.  The coleslaw was not my favorite - I didn't really like the dressing - but it provided a refreshing crunch.  The BBQ beans were very good.  Sweet, smoky, bacony, piping hot.  The mac and cheese was good too (and topped with breadcrumbs!), but I think I'll try the fries next time.  My companions said that the brisket chili was fine but nothing to write home about.  Next time, I'll have to try the other meats - ribs, brisket, chicken, and Texas sausage (which I thought was called Elgin sausage in Texas?) - I was playing it safe this time."
"I have no issue with the food at Smoque, it's perfectly passable when compared to other Chicago BBQ. However, having been to several BBQ places in Tennessee and Texas I wouldn't really rave about anything they make either. Although I haven't been in a while and certainly not since a Texas BBQ road trip last year. I'll give them another try soon and see how they stack up"
"The seating situation is the only reason I give this 4 stars, as your food can be ready and you can end up with nowhere to sit...  The food is absolutely delicious.  I've been here several times before and will be back again!"
"I didn't realize my wife posted a review until I logged on just now. We ate here Sunday night and I was just telling a co-worker about Smoque and my mouth literally started to water. I've been in most of the BBQ meccas around the US, and Smoque is right up there.  The brisket was a great blend of tenderness, smoke and crust. I was very happy that the quality didn't fade through the day as we arrived with only 30 minutes left before closing.Kicking myself that it took me so long to eat there, especially since it is 8 blocks from our house.   I joked that we should bring our daughter there and tell her to have  Smoque cater her wedding. The more I think of it, maybe that shouldn't be a joke!"
"Great Great Great!!! It's great to see a business as such thriving. I was hooked since the first time I stepped foot in this place. The meat melts in your mouth and even though I know this is a BBQ joint, less salt would have probably been appreciated even more. As it is usually crowded to come in during normal lunch hours I chose to come by a little later after 2PM and the place has less patrons just like how I like it."
Love this place. Best BBQ in Chicago. Never had anything that wasn't excellent.
"Really excellent BBQ, every single time I've been here. The staff is also great. Every time friends come in from out of town, I make a point to take them to Smoque."
Absolutely fantastic food.  We have tried everything on their menu and it is all great.  I like that their mac n cheese and peach cobbler come in individual littlealuminium containers.  The brisket is especially goo.  The staff is very friendly and efficient.  I ws worried by the large line but it moved along really well.  They also help you find seating - sharing a table if need be.
The is by far my most favorite ribs place.  Most of the ribs places here put so much BBQ sauce.  It's great to see a really good dry rub place.  The sides are excellent and the portions are a good size.  I would definitely try the St. Louis ribs!
"not really sure what else to say.  There are a handful of very good rib joints in the city, but the STL ribs from Smoque are about as good as it gets.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I would like more of a bar/rest atmosphere.  If you could put Smoque's ribs in the Smoke Daddy room I would be in heaven."
Friendly service and wicked good BBQ.  It's a very small place so go early.  The brisket is the way to go.  Try the different sauces too.  And the peach cobbler was almost otherworldly good.
"Best BBQ I've had in Chicago.  And I take my BBQ seriously.I saw Buddy Garrity eating brisket on Friday Night Lights and suddenly got the itch for some good BBQ. Yelp reviews led me to Smoque, and the itch was scratched.Meats:There was a classic red smoke ring in all the meats, but they remained amazingly moist.  Everything melted in your mouth.  Excellent dry rub.  Delicious sauce.  Sides:The Mac & Cheese was cheesy - not watery and bland like most places.  The beans had an amazing BBQ flavor.  The slaw was a refreshing complement - not a mayo-drenched blob.Tips:- Expect to wait in line.  We got there at 8pm on a Saturday and waited for 40 minutes.  WELL WORTH IT THOUGH.  If you get there a little later, you'll wait less.  You order at the counter, then someone eventually seats you.- BYOB!- Call ahead and carry out.  You can skip the line.You can eat well for about $12.  I can't wait to head back!"
"This place is legit.  I got there a bit after 1 PM on a Saturday and just missed a huge crowd of people.  The set up is interesting.  It's fairly small inside, but doesn't seem too bad once you're in there. You order at the counter and then get seated (if you're eating there).  Once your order is ready, they call your number and you go get it from the counter.  -I got the pulled pork sandwich (comes with 1 side and coleslaw).  The pulled pork was excellent...one of the best (if not the best) that I've had.  You definitely need to use the extra sauce they give you.    -The mac & cheese is extremely cheesy, oily and most likely terrible for you, but it tasted very good.  -The coleslaw was average, but helped cut through all of the cheese and pork.I tasted the baked beans and they are great...very smokey too.  I need to try the brisket next time as that looked awesome. The service is quick and the staff turns tables around quickly.  I was able to order, eat and get out of there within 25 min.  Bathrooms: Only 1 men's and 1 women's.  The line for the women's bathroom was long; the men's had no line.  Men's bathroom was clean and that's always a good thing.  Aside from the scratched in graffiti (what gangster scratches graffiti into the bathroom of a smokehouse?), it was pleasant.  Parking:Can be challenging.  There's a lot behind the place that has restrictions on when it can be used for Smoque patrons, and it is real precarious.  There's metered street parking available, but if you search a bit, you'll find free street parking as well.  Other than Smoque, there's not much worthwhile in this area. I will definitely go here again and I will dominate the brisket.  This place is definitely worth a shot."
"Three words: PULLED PORK PLATTER. I couldn't finish it by any means, but let me tell you, with tasty fixings like pulled pork drizzled in sweet BBQ sauce, cornbread, baked macaroni and cheese, and warm peach cobbler, you better believe I tried my mother effing best. OH MY GOD.OH.MY.GAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHWWD.And now for the review: Seriously, let me start first by saying that damn, this place is super efficient. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and informed that upon ordering we'd then be seated. So it's 6:30 on a Friday night and there's a manageable line in front of us, okay, no big deal. I ordered the Pulled Pork Platter and my boyfriend got the brisket platter. When we placed our order we moved to the side and were seated right away. Seating here is communal so you're literally sitting quite closely to the other patrons who (hopefully) aren't gnawing on the tasty BBQ -- but if they are, you can't really blame them.Within about 5 minutes our number was called and we grabbed our food. I was not prepared for what happened next.Wow. Just wow. My pulled pork (enough to serve 2) was mouthwatering. It was perfectly cooked and also came with a side of extra BBQ sauce (included with the order). The baked mac and cheese was crunchy on top and melted inside. The cornbread was the best though, quite possibly the best comfort food, better than your mom could make it, trust me. I got the peach cobbler as one of my sides (yes, amazingly I had room for dessert)....the perfect ending to the perfect meal. No complaints whatsoever.OH! My boyfriend's sides included cole slaw - I absolutely despise cole slaw but here they make it almost sour - just cabbage, onion and vinegar, it was great in between bites, really crisp and cleansed the pallet.When we finished eating, someone offered to take our plates and the next couple was seated. They clean tables immediately after every meal before seating whomever is next so it's super clean and efficient. The line may look long (and sometimes out the door) but they are eager to get you seated in a timely manner.I'll be back!"
"Ordered: sliced brisket platter (brisket+mac&cheese+peach cobbler) = 12.45+tax.I came here because Smoque's the most reviewed BBQ place in Chicago. It's definitely not a fancy-smansy sit down place, though there are tables and we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. But who really cares that much about seating- I came for the food!Brisket: THE BEST brisket I've ever had. I'm wary of saying anything is the best in the city because I don't really plan to visit enough places for that statement to carry statistical value. However, it was amazingly tender and moist and melted in my mouth. I thought the portion was fair considering that BBQ is usually expensive. Next time I will probably just buy a straight pound of this stuff and forgo all the other food distractors. Mac&Cheese: I have to preface this by saying I'm not a big mac&cheese kinda guy. I never did the blue box stuff growing up, so cheese covered macaroni doesn't really bring up childhood memories. The mac&cheese here is baked and adequate, which is about as good as mac&cheese gets for me. Peach Cobbler: Again, no childhood connections for me. I thought it was pretty good. Overall, I considered Smoque a great value, which is really hard to find in a BBQ place in a major city... actually, it's probably because I'm a cheap bastard and I don't think many places offer good value ^_^ I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere here and their commitment to amazing brisket. I will definitely be back!"
"Delicious!!  Smoque is pretty no frills, but it seems as they put all the extra energy straight into the food, which was amazing.  This place can get busy, so be prepared to wait a bit, but they run an efficient operation, so things move pretty fast. I had the brisket and my date had ribs. Both were fabulous, which I may have mentioned a few times at this point. The rib meat pretty much just fell off the bone and the brisket had such a great flavor. An older gentleman who seemed to be somewhat in charge even brought over some more sauces and candied jalapenos for us to sample.  The sides were pretty great too, mac and cheese, cornbread, and peach cobbler.  Smoque, you delivered some knock out food. Keep up the great work."
"ZZZZzzzzzzz.....zzzzzz.....zzzz....zz.... Oh, sorry. Just ate 12 lbs. of bbq from Smoque. Scientists have accounted for close to 100% of the human body. However there is a small percentage unaccounted for. Many believe this is the human soul. I believe this is the human beings passion for BBQ. Or perhaps a combination of both. OR, are they the same thing?I digress, Smoque makes some damn good Q. I was fortunate enough to get here before the busy crowd (about 5:45-6:00 on a Friday). Instantly after I placed my order, there was a line reaching the door. The facts. St.Louis Ribs. Bomb diggidy. Big ol' smoke ring (the pink lining under the skin for newbies). They remove the translucent skin underneath the rib, hate when places don't do that. Hugs the bone gently, doesn't fall off the bone (that's a no-no, again for you newbs). Sliced brisket, that's one BIG OHHH YEAHHH! Masterfully cooked with and almost pillowy texture. No sauce needed. Pulled pork's good, but I'd prefer a vinegar based sauce for PP (can't all get what we want though). We forgot to order the Texas sausage, nooooooooo....The sides. Coleslaw is one of the best. Love the dressing the use. So-so beans. Comforting mac and cheese (i like the serving dish, to-go that is). Excellent cornbread and one mighty good peach cobbler. Smoque knows their BBQ. Splurge, enjoy yourself, and have some of the best BBQ you can get your hands on in our beloved city."
What can I say?Come early to avoid the lines.Order: St. Louis Ribs with baked beans and peach cobbler. Maybe a little brisket on the side... you know you want it. Taste of meats? Genius!And that runny vinegary BBQ sauce? Please send a thermos to my house. I will happily drink it for sustenance. I love you Smoque!
"This place is so good, Im not even a big fan of BBQ,but damn, it was good."
Smoque is very tasty. Always a line and wait but well worth it! Definitly more a take out place. The meat is tender and tasty and the sides are solid. I have used them to cater parties as well and they set it up wonderfully.
I only tried the wings there but the wings were really good. The atmosphere of live music was refreshing and I would love to go back soon. I highly recommend it.
"Everything at Smoque was amazing, except the ribs.  In fact, the ribs are some of the worst I ever had.  With that being said, the brisket and pulled pork is incredible!  You can't go wrong with anything else, but stay away from the ribs, and remember its BYOB."
"dope place, but I wish they had a little bit more side dishes as far as the serving goes."
The brisket was the best I had in the area.  Next time i'm getting it by the pound because who needs the sides (which are lacking) when it's the meat that this place is all about
"Have been to Smoque many times because my husband and daughter love it, but I think it's just okay. I like a sweeter BBQ sauce--their's is a bit acidic. Also, the cole slaw is just average. Again, it's too acidic for me, especially along with the acidic sauce. And the fries are really greasy."
"For the variety and types of q you probably can't beat Smoque.  We got a bunch of different types of q to share which include: a rack of St. Louis style ribs, 1lb of sliced brisket, Texas Sausage, with sides of mac and cheese, beans, chilli and slaw.  The smoke flavor in the meat was fantastic, strong yet subtle, flavorful yet not overpowering.  The ribs had a real nice rub on them that stood up alone and the bbq sauce was just a nice accent to the meat.  They were not fall of the bone tender yet they were very tender.  I actually prefer my q to have a little chew to it so I enjoyed the ribs that way.  The brisket once again had great smoke flavor and was fall apart tender and super flavorful.  My only complaint about the brisket which is just matter of taste is I thought it was a little too fall apart tender, I do prefer to have a little more texture to my meat.  But nonetheless it was great.  The sausages were good but nothing to write home about.  Smoque would be a 5 star review if it weren't for the sides.  It's not that the sides weren't good it's just they seemed to be overlooked.  They were super small portions even for the large, and when I think of having a bbq it entails huge ass portions of sides.  I want to be able to get big ass buckets of beans, slaw, etc.   Also I felt having the mac and cheese in the metal ramekins gave it a metallic taste which I did not enjoy.Overall if you are looking for some killer q Smoque is a good stop.  If you are looking to have sides with the q I may look elsewhere to get your side, unless they start to serve some bigger portions."
Best BBQ in the city.   Do it.
As good as BBQ gets in Chicago!
"Good.  Maybe not out of your way great, but if I lived in the neighborhood, I'd hit this place 2 or 3 times a week easy."
"Best BBQ I have ever had. Far better than anything I had in Memphis, the capital of BBQ. I had the BBQ pork and it was tender and flavorful. I also had some ribs which were also delicious."
"Having grown up in the South, I know a thing or two about bbq and this is the best I've had in Chicago hands down. Maybe the best bbq I've ever had. What more is there to say. Oh, it's byob and there aren't many nearby liquor stores."
"Really good barbecue, I alway have the chopped brisket and macaroni and cheese.  Because it's so small, you will be sharing tables, and you can byob.  Great casual place."
If you are trying to decide where to go and you like BBQ...look no farther.  Food rocked!
"I've been there twice so far. First time I went there for lunch when it was not busy, food was OK. Price is cheap, but I still felt that it could be better . 2nd time, I was there for dinner, I got there early, surprisingly food was much better than the first time."
Like all the review say it's great BBQ. Definitely a must try.
Best BBQ on earth.
"It's much better Memphis-style dry-rub barbecue than I'm used to, but if you're more into Kansas City barbecue (where the sauce is the boss), I think there are better alternatives. Seating was very tight, but tables opened up pretty quickly. Portions were very small. A ""full"" rack of ribs, 2 sides, and a drink was borderline enough for me (I weigh 125 pounds) and God help you if you get the 1/2 rack. At around $25, it was too expensive for the portion size."
Excellent.  Not the undisputed champs some purport it to be.  But excellent none-the-less.  Brisket is the way to go.
"Ugh! Don't go here. This place is horrible. No really you won't like it. ;-) I went here with high expectations. The food was described as exceptional (it is) The service is a mix of utilitarian but attentive. (more on this later) Okay the truth now. You probably want to go here early. Okay for you readers sans wee ones early likely means 7PM. You will be in for a long wait. Think Seinfeld's Soup Nazi without the insults. So yeah fair warning. We were there early by our standards and by the time we left at 5PM the line was already wrapping out the restaurant on a freezing day. The food is delish and uncomplicated. They do BBQ and they do it well. They do nothing else. The service for a cafeteria style place is superb. These guys are helpful to a fault. I don't know how they'd keep this up later into the night but we felt like we had servers at our beckon call. Again this may have been a function of our arrival time. The only terrible thing is that I only learned about this a few months ago. Time to make up for lost time. Also, they cater y'all! If you plan on eating there I recommend a crispy lager (Metropolitan). I've clearly been doing my BBQ wrong because there was a flavor war when I paired it with a Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
The Salt Lick meets Chicago. So good and rich with flavor.  BBQ fans will love this joint
best BBQ in the city..brisket is the king here but I've had every other meat and they taste amazing aswell
"Ah, This is a 4.5 star restaurant to me, but I am giving 5 because (first of all they don't have 4.5 officially, but also) their brisket was something special.  It was so tender and juicy but still the texture was intact.  We also loved the St. Louise rib.  However, their baby back rib was dry and just ok.  I would definitely recommend, as a lot of people say, to try briskets and baby back rib."
"Awesome-5 star-brisket!!! Brisket is my only focus when heading into this meatopia. The sauce is not necessary b/c it's flavorful and definitely not dry...but adding a touch of the spicy bbq sauce does compliment it. Since it was on the Food Network, the lines are sometimes craaazy long... fortunately, it goes pretty fast. The seating is a bit packed & loud but who cares when you're feeding your face with meat!"
"A well-oiled machine for meat lovers to enjoy ribs, pulled pork, brisket, sausage, and chicken in a quick, casual atmosphere. Plastic utensils, communal seating, food served on trays, carryout option, etc. The place was packed on a Saturday mid-afternoon but the unique seating system works perfectly. Although you order at the counter (no tip!), an employee takes down the number of people in your party while you are in line and finds you a table. The menu is not big -- the meats are the feature and everything else complements them. As they profess in their manifesto, quality BBQ can stand alone without sauce. Many sub-par BBQ places highlight their sauces or mask their meat with sauces. Not at Smoque where the sauce is served on the side. Perhaps not the best ribs I've ever had (Twin Anchors is awfully good), but hands down the best brisket. I have never had juicier or more tender brisket in my life.The sides are just as good. The slaw is not of the creamy variety but light and vinegar based. Beans are amazing. Only slight complaint is the mac n cheese -- not as smooth as I would like. I do appreciate the bread crumbs on top for the crunch though.Worth making a special trip for lunch if you are anywhere in Chicago."
"I grew up in Kansas City and regularly eat BBQ all over the country.  Smoque is hands down the best in Chicago.  I only wish they'd create a second location and upscale it a bit with a dining experience (you know, ambiance and table service)"
"Best BBQ, hands down. How i miss you, Smoque...."
"I am from Texas.  I know BBQ...These guys are the real deal.  Brisket is some of the best I have had and I have been to Lockhart TX, Kruetz's Black's...Ironworks in Austin.,  Smoque is better than all of them.  Keep it up Barry!!"
So GREAT!  I've tried everything on the menu and it is wonderful!  I'm always so full and bbq-guilt ridden when I waddle out.  I also love how someone always directs seating and patrons so there is limited waiting for seating - great thinking smoque.  Plus it's wonderful that they allow all-you-can-drink soda to wash down that excellent food.
"So like many of these Yelpers, I found Smoque through DDD [Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives] on the Food Network. It was drool at first sight.I went with a few friends and we decided to mix it up and order something different than one another so we could get a taste of a little bit of everything. Here's the lowdown:- Texas Sausage: A little greasy for my taste..Don't get me wrong, I'm down with eating unhealthy, but this went a little overboard for my taste. Verdict: Good, but I've had better sausage in my day.- Brisket: Flavor was AMAZING with AND without sauce. However, when they advertise 15 hours of cooking, I expect it to be ridiculously tender..maybe I came on a bad day. Verdict: Delish. I'll definitely give it another go, though.- Baby Back Ribs: No lie, some of the best BBR I've had in a while. Great flavor. Lean meat. SO tender. Verdict: Primo stuff. - St. Louis Ribs: Apparently I've been sheltered most of my life because I have never heard of St. Louis RIbs. Stuff is AMAZING. The rub on these bad boys is insane. There was so much meat on there, too. Verdict: You gotta try it.- Sides: Mac n Cheese was ok. Slaw was above par. Fries had this divine seasoning.Overall, service was solid. Didn't wait too long to order. They had table staff to ensure everybody got a table. For the most part, the food was excellent. Definitely worth going back."
"I'm 5 stars here. The Sliced Brisket is amazing/ Great smoky BBQ sauce! Sides are good but small. I love the fries,beans, and mac and cheese. Also DO NOT miss the Homemade Mikesa's Links, handmade in Texas and phenomenal!! I don't think it expensive at all for what they give you.. And It's BUSY almost all the time, I wonder why??"
"You know when you are told to get there by 5 to get a seat and to make sure that they still have everything available that on the menu- that this is no ordinary BBQ joint. First the experience. This is not going to be a leisurely dining experience. More of a ""get in, get food, get out"" mentality. They have to move people through as the space is small, the crowds are large but they have a system that is pretty darn efficient even on a Saturday night. We ordered a little bit of everything . . .brisket, ribs, Texas sausage and all the sides. I loved that the meat was rubbed and smoked and that the vinegary BBQ sauce is served on the side- to slather on or not- your choice. The portion sizes for the meat are large but the sides seemed a bit skimpy to me. The foil ramekins that the mac and cheese came in were small but I guess that's so the star is the meat, The peach cobbler for dessert- also good but call me crazy but I'm a girl that likes my food served on dishes. I get the simple approach- I just don't like to eat off of foil, paper lined trays and Styrofoam bowls. Dinner for two with a ton of food leftover ran about $37 (enough meat left over for at least another meal) Get there early. Bring your appetite and don't dawdle over your food. Cuz that person who is standing there waiting for your seat just might be me!"
"It was great before all the hype and it's still great.  Their brisket is awesome as is their sauce which is handed over in small containers for you to distribute as you wish.  I don't particularly recommend the brisket or pulled pork sandwiches because you can't really get all that BBQ flavor through the flavorless pieces of bread.  I'm also just not a big fan of going to BBQ places and getting pulled pork sandwiches, but especially here.  The mac&cheese beats out most of the other sides, but the beans are still a must.  The interior can get pretty packed around peak times, so a line forms.  Also, during a visit, I dropped my food and they replaced it within 30 seconds, with no additional charge.I don't recommend doing this, it was just a nice thing they did for me."
Pretty good.  3rd time I've been there and very happy with the food.  Try to go on off hours as the lunch line can be lengthly.I took my Grandmother there (a lover of BBQ) and she had a huge smile when she walked out... And BBQ all over her glasses from refitting them while eating.Definitely worth a stop.  Parking in the back!
"Since I wrote this review, this place has been featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives with Guy Fieri. Nuff said!"
solid Q in the Windy City
Always fantastic!
Dynamite BBQ. Definitely the best in Chicagoland. BYOB.
Excellent BBQ! Great catering. The pulled pork is amazing. The brisket is excellent.
A+ Pulled Pork Sandwich A+ French FriesA+ Mac & Cheese ! Will be back !
"Awesome new addition to the place with more seating.  The beef brisket sandwich is good, as well as sweet potato fries.  Only thing that wasn't great was the greens... they weren't cooked enough and were smothered in oil."
"I have never given a restaurant 5 stars, but this one deserves it. This has to be the BEST bbq place in Chicago/Northwest Suburbs. I am a huge fan of bqq and believe that this is as good as it gets (close to home anyway). The place is a little small and the line can get farely long but it is well worth the wait. There isnt much room to sit inside either and the tables are close together so get ready to sit next to someone you dont know. The ribs are incredible and just put you over the top. When I dont have a lot of time I usually get the 1/2 pulled pork 1/2 brisket (sliced) sandwich, coleslaw and fries. Also an amazing choice. The pulled pork is tender and has a sweet and sassy bbq sauce. Macaroni and cheese is a delicious side as well if thats more to your liking. If you have room left over for desert, definetely try the peach cobbler, taste's like its from Georgia (if youve ever tried it). Absolutel must go!!!"
"While this doesn't compare to Kansas City BBQ, I give them huge props for what they deliver in Chicago. First, this place is BYOB. So nice. Second, they do a great job of moving the line, getting people sat, getting food out, etc. Finally, the food is good- you get a lot of the $$ and even the sides are worth it. The mac and cheese is a must try, I was also a fan of the corn bread. As for meat, I thought the brisket was the best I tried, but I definitely need to get back there to try the ribs, I know I'm missing out!"
"I'm so glad I tried their BBQ; however, now I wish I lived closer.  Their pulled pork was moist and had great flavor.  I didn't even use the sauce I was provided (which is a shocker).  Their sides are delicious!  I had the BBQ beans, mac & cheese, and cornbread and no complaints.  I liked how their menu was limited w/ choices.  Sometimes restaurants have way too many items to choose from.  When I'm back in the neighborhood, I will be stopping by."
Excellent briskets! i highly recommend for any one who likes BBQ to try this place.
"What constitutes a good rack (of ribs)? I'd say, flavor, texture, and the SAUCE.I've always been a fan of ribs, but ever since moving from Texas to California, I've never had a good slab of ribs that could compare. Anywhere. One of the three criteria were always off. Smoque BBQ on the other hand gets it done with flying colors. The flavor of the ribs could stand on its own, even without sauce. The texture isn't chewy and falls off the bone with one meek chomp. And now, the sauce... married with the ribs, it's pure perfection. The sauce has just the right amount of spice and the right amount of tang. It would be a sin to let a drop go to waste, and honestly it could probably stand on it's own in a glass with a silly straw.Now that's a nice rack. Saucy."
"Some of the best BBQ in Chicago. If you're going, best to go at an off-time, or if you're getting take-out, best to call ahead.Inside, the places is pretty no frills. Long, communal seats. Order at the counter. Awesome smell of meat wafting throughout. To see the place, pricing seems a little on the expensive side- until you taste the food. Clearly a ton of time and attention has been put into smoking the nice selection- including ribs (baby back/st. louis), brisket, pulled pork, chicken and sausage. You can a sandwich, but I'd recommend going with a platter- if in a group you can get a hearty sample of the different meats, served on paper/cafeteria tray. I've had the baby backs, brisket and pork, and all were fantastic.The sides are standard fare- fries, mac & cheese, slaw- all very good, but the highlight is the meat. As it should be."
"Best barbecue in Chicago, IMHO."
"Having eaten Brisket all over Texas (and even lesser BBQ cities) this is not really in the same league.  I had the brisket, sliced.  The smoke is too light (almost nonexistent in mine that day) and the the meat far too moist and tender. There should be a slight pull but this seems rendered like they steamed it after the fact.  Maybe they're shorting the time in the smoker to meet demand and finishing in an oven.  But, hey, they have the lines waiting to pay, so who am I?  Not sure if the folks I saw have much of an idea what BBQ is about but it must work for Chicago.  Will say the Coleslaw was a great complement."
"Absolutely amazing.  Not sure if I've found or had better BBQ in Chicago.Everything I've gotten from here so far has left me satisfied.  I highly recommend the St. Louis ribs & the brisket.This is not a place to go see & be seen, hang out for long, etc.  It's not a place that will shine with ambience or decor.  It's just a BBQ joint, one that's doing it right.  Go early or wait in a long line."
"I don't even like BBQ.....Smoque is just that good. My hubby and I went to Smoque last Friday night. We got there about 6 and somehow missed the rush, because 30 mins later there wasn't even standing room. The staff is phenomenal. They keeps this place running like a well-oiled machine.  The line can be intimidating, but there are several excellent wait staffers/busers/attendants/cooks that want to get you in the restaurant and fed. That always helps :)The food is flat out amazing. I had the brisket platter with fries and mac and cheese. It was so good. The brisket was so tender it fell apart when I was trying to stab it with a fork...maybe I should have used a spoon to dip it in the awesome sauce! The mac and cheese was perfect--not too creamy, cheese, or runny. Seriously awesome. The fries may have been some of the best I have had. I got my standard ketchup, salt, pepper---I didn't use any of it really. They were perfect.  I did use one packet of ketchup to mix with the BBQ sauce and dip with the fries, that was excellent--but not necessary.And the coleslaw is delicious. It's more oil based than the creamy mayo based, which I loved. I cannot wait to bring my mom, in-laws, friends, etc. to Smoque. I know all my family members will love it."
"Picture the scene: 7 people, 2 toddlers, where to eat on a Friday night?Normally this scenario would give me nightmares, and a busy place like Smoque would be out of the question. But since it wasn't my decision I went along with the plan expecting the worst. I can happily report that my fears were unfounded. When we got there the place was half empty, and we were seated right away. Then we put in our order and got our drinks from the fountain. By the time we got back to our seats our food was ready!The food was delicious. I had the half rack of baby back ribs. It comes with slaw and two sides. For those I chose the peach cobbler and beans. My only complaint is that the half rack seemed on the small side, but everything was seriously good.I would come back again anytime. Parking was easy. Although we drove, its really easy to walk to from the Irving Park blue line station."
"3.5 stars for the food alone, but the BYOB , seat-yourself, and parking lot factors bumped up Smoque to a solid 4 stars!My girl friends and I arrived around 5:30 PM on a weeknight, and there was a constant steady flow of patrons.  You order at the counter, seat yourself, and pick up your order when your number is called.  This minimizes costs by not having to tip a waiter - bonus!  We also brought in a 6-pack of beer w/o being charged a corkage fee - another bonus!  And we parked in the lot for free - bonus again!!Aside from these great perks, the food was very enjoyable too.  From word of mouth and Yelp reviews, I quickly realized that the brisket and St. Louis ribs are on point here.  So I ordered the ""1/2 and 1/2"" sandwich (half pulled pork, half brisket - either chopped or sliced) which came with cole slaw and 1 side (I chose mac & cheese) and added a 1/4 slab (~3 ribs) of St. Louis ribs for ~$15 after taxes.  Pretty affordable!  The pulled pork was my favorite, but I was also impressed with the extreme tenderness of the brisket.  However, I thought the St. Louis ribs tasted too smoky, the sauce for the sandwiches were a little too tangy (although the ribs sauce was just fine - ketchup-y, slightly sweet, and thick), and I wish the side portion of mac & cheese was larger.  But these aren't dealbreakers, as I was really content with the pulled pork and brisket.  I will definitely come back!"
"love this place, even though the line is outside whenever I drive there all the way from the south side of chicago, It is soooo worth it! I take out of town guest here! The wait is never long and the service is great!!!  Did I mention the food......Im a pickey eater and everyone knows this, so congrats to Smoque to living up to MY standards!!!! The best brisket I have ever eaten, mac and cheese is awesome so go on and order another for later because if you dont, around 3 hrs later, you will regret that you dont have more and digging around the edges for the last isnt cool. lol YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PLACE!"
Saw this on the Foodnetwork and decided to check it out. Its on the North Side. Decided to check it out because of all the great reviews. And they are right its one of the best places. The brisket is pretty amazing. Go now if you have not been there.
"Solid bbq joint, not too far off I90/94, so a good stop off on the way to the airport if you're coming from the south. Seating is managed by the host (no reservations), but I've never had to actually wait for a table, even though this place has been super busy the 10+ times I've visited."
The best brisket I have ever had.  So juicy...the cobbler is fantastic as well.  I think we tried every kind of meat they have and I can't think of one downside whatsoever.  Highly recommended!
"This place isn't bad, if u can afford the astronomical prices."
"Good BBQ for Chicago.  The brisket was moist and perfectly smoked and charred.  The BBQ sauce was good, but nothing too special.  Overall a very good experience, but expect long waits.  Hard to beat Pappy's in St. Louis in my books."
Delicious!
Great food and great ribs. Will be going back very soon.
Very good smoked meat. Portions could be bigger for the brisket. Also they need to add rib tibs to the menu. All in all though very good.
"We went here before the lunch rush and walked right up to the register and placed our order. Since it was my first visit I wanted to try everything and they made the menu so you could by ordering ""tastes"" for $3 each. I ordered a full slab of baby backs and a taste of pulled pork and beef brisket. Yes I ate it all. My son got a brisket platter with 2 sides.The baby back ribs are so good no sauce is required. Whatever rub they put on the ribs would be drowned out by the sauce IMO. The pulled pork was moist and had a great flavor (the rub again ?) The brisket was lean and perfectly cooked but lacked flavor, this is where the sauce comes in handy. Next time I go I'm getting the mac 'n cheese that my son recommended to me. They cook it in it's own little tin container and it's so good. The Smoque BBQ sauce didn't work for me, but like I said it may not be needed. I love Heckys sauce.  This place was very clean and well run. If you dine in they will seat you so that say, two people don't hog a whole table for four. Yes you will be rubbing elbows with strangers, so what! Everyones there for good Q!I'm still giving this joint 5 stars even if I wasn't crazy about the sauce and the $3 tastes are a bargain add on. Have fun finding a parking place.CLOSED ON MONDAYS"
When I am in the mood for bbq this is where I have to go.  Small casual place with big flavors.  Huge portions so if your not super hungry you might want to share with someone or plan on bringing some home for someone else.  Things I have tried and recommend:Chopped Brisket (or sliced)Mac n cheeseBaked beansFrench fries
Wow guys I have to tell u the best pulled pork and brisket I have ever eaten been there 5 times now and it stays consistent!!!
"Great food, casual, a little hard to find a table, but overall a fine experience. I would go back or recommend to someone in the area."
"Delish! Excellent meat, super sauces, and no tude on the side. Worth the trip and definitely worth the detour from the Kennedy."
Awesome BBQ- like the best in the city.  Worth the hike up north.  They also have really good peach cobbler and macaroni and cheese.  You will find there is a line however as anyone that goes here for good barbaque comes back it appears... even if it's raining.  It's a bit cramped for sitting down and eating a leisurely meal but they have a good system and get tables moved quick.  This place isn't 5 stars for ambience but if you want 5 star BBQ then this is the place.
"Don't get me wrong, this place is quite good, but I must admit I don't understand the giant lines. It's not *that* overwhelmingly awesome. I feel like a lot of people from out of town Google for ""bbq joints"" and this place comes up first. Which i suppose is fine but there are plenty of other places in the city that are just as tasty. Fat Willys & Pork Shoppe come to mind."
"Best BBQ in Chicago, hands down. Casual atmosphere and good price for the quality of  the food you're getting.I usually get the pulled pork with the peach cobbler as a side. Just writing about it makes me crave another Smoque run, too bad it's so far from where I live."
"Had another good meal here recently, and I think they've earned another star. The BBQ beans were amazing(and have now become my favorite thing on their sides menu), and I only wish they'd make the portion of the macaroni and cheese they get(if you choose this as your side) equal to the portion you get of the BBQ beans. Finally tried the Saint Louis ribs, and those are excellent! The sauce that comes with the ribs(it has a very tomato-based taste) compliments the ribs very well. Peach cobbler isn't too bad, not my favorite place I've had it at, but certainly is still very enjoyable(and within the city of Chicago, how many places serve it anyway? not very many).I'm starting to think the cole slaw issue is just more of a matter of taste, as I just prefer cole slaw that isn't heavy in vinegar. But I've gotten past this, and my opinion of this place is definitely on the way up."
"This is now my go-to place in Chicago for BBQ.  Most of it is a-la-carte so an order can get pricey but you will get more than your money's worth trust me.  Great pork, brisket, sides.... oh man now I have to go get some ::drool::"
"Our visit to Smoque was fantastic. I tried several things here and they were all excellent. A few surprises: it's a casual walk-up order place, no waitstaff, and they actually have parking in the rear of the building!What else can one significantly add to a place that has been reviewed over a thousand times? Not sure. If you need to know anything else I'd say get prepared for some crappy coleslaw. The the bleu cheese coleslaw recipe from Bat17 in Evanston would be a great match; they should steal it."
"Very good bbq. I don't like the slaw(oil and vinegar), prefer creamy with my que. But everything else is great. Remember: It's bbq, not fine dining, no one cares about peeling paint, we want bbq!! My go-to is the pulled pork, done quite nicely!! The brisket is good, but not great. Ribs are wonderful, I like the St. Louis ribs best! The beans are also great. I don't give it 5 stars because it's expensive, bbq shouldn't be expensive."
"People may tell you that the North can't proper BBQ, which, 99 times in 100, they can't.  Smoque is the exception.  Everything I've had here has been fantastic, and I've made my way through most of the menu at this point, even if I always end up back at the brisket (and the delicious smoke ring).  Even the sides are astounding, the Peach Cobbler is not to be missed, and I seem to end up with a side of mac and cheese every time I'm there as well."
I wasn't quite sure what to make of the place. They don't make it easy to order. But I have to admit its more than worth the time it takes to learn. Great food. Really great.
"Pretty good, not the biggest BBQ fan but if the line out the door doesn't tell you something about this place then I don't know what does.  Oh and it was on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives...cant ask for more than that!"
"I've never dined in, but ordered to go several times for group dinners and everything on the menu is always a hit."
"This is barbeque at its very best!!  Everything here is so yummy. My favorite is the chopped brisket sandwich.  As a matter of fact, that is the only thing I have tried. I'm really committed to the cause!!"
"Yep, this place rocks. Especially the pulled pork. Like most BBQ places outside of Texas (where I'm originally from), Smoque's brisket tends to be drier and tougher than the best Texas 'Q. But it's much better than at most other places in town. Ribs are great."
"I have been here on numerous occasions and keep coming back. I just really love their brisket. My most recent time was a few weeks ago with my fiancée who raved about his meal. He really enjoyed his pulled pork. I agree this form is the best way to retain their sauce. I like a thick and sweet BBQ myself, but I love the tang this place has to offer.  My go to is the brisket because of how tender it is, but I agree that I need to mix it up on my next visit and do pulled pork or maybe the ribs. I'll just keep it standard by ordering their Mac n cheese ;p"
"I love making myself miserable by eating $30 worth of smoked meats. How stereotypically American of me. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu save for the salad maybe. Roughage? Pfft. If you're going to Smoque, you know exactly what you're doing and this is the best way to do it."
Awesome brisket and pork!  Best BBQ I've found in Chicago.
"The only thing here I'm not bonkers about is the coleslaw; I prefer creamy and they have a vinegary style. Other than that, everything I've ordered her is aces. We live nearby and shortly after it opened, we were risking rapid-onset obesity from the frequency of our visits.I've been to other BBQ places in Chicago. This place remains a steadfast favorite. Bonus points that it's in my neighborhood!"
"Best BBQ in Chicago. Period.And when I say BBQ I mean a smokey brisket or dry-rub ribs, not the chain-restaurant, drowned in sugary-sauce, baby-back ribs that the midwest is plagued with.  Real southern BBQ.I've known about this place since it opened and unfourtunetly it's ever-rising popularity keeps me from going as often as I'd like.  It's not uncommon for them to be be out of pork and/or ribs some days shortly after lunchtime.  The only 'real' authentic southern BBQ I've had in the Midwest and there isn't much more I can say that hasn't already been said."
The best Brisket money can get you in Chicago!
"Amazing BBQ!  The girlfriend and I had the brisket, sausage links, baby back ribs, mac & cheese(best I've ever had), baked beans and fries.  ALL were excellent!  Place is not cheap, but portions are fair and the ""treat yourself to kick ass BBQ every once in a while"" experience is worth it.Place is A MADHOUSE at dinner time.  Do yourself a favor and go in during off peak hours, or call in for carryout (unless you enjoy 50 hungry people staring at you through the window trying to ""Jedi Mind Trick"" yo' ass into eating faster and getting the hell out so they can have your table...)Gotta try the pulled pork on my next visit!"
Their food is delish.  And it's a hopping fun place to visit.
"Yummmm! I loved pulled pork but their brisket is out of this world...just melts in ur mouth. I been here twice so far. Each time its been busy and crowded but they have a nice line system and ur food is ready by the time u get a plate. Def recommend the mac n cheese. It comes in the little metal tins, perfect side, I get them both as two side options. I had the BBQ beans, they are good, but I prefer my beans sweet, if you prefer them smokey, then get them! I have yet to try the ribs, but they are next on my list!I like the sweet BBQ sauce not the vinegar  based one. But u have to ask for it. Staff is great one of the owner walks the floor..even gave us free cobbler after we turned in a wallet that was left behind! Great place..once is never enough ;)Only issue is parking, be prepared!"
"I really enjoy their ribs - my favorite in the city.  The only downside is that parking is a challenge, but usually there is something on the street nearby."
BBQ goodness and as good as it gets!
"The best barbeque in Chicago - hands down. Don't go anywhere else. Even our children loved the food there, and children can be picky!"
"OMG....amazing.  I've had both styles of the ribs, pulled pork, brisket, the combo's......they are all top notch!  The sides are terrific as well, the coles law is yummy, the peach cobler is to die for."
"I like this place. The BBQ is pretty darn good. Sauce is not overly sweet, which i like. Baked Beans are good, but too sweet. Fries are very good, especially dunked in the BBQ sauce! I just wish the seating area was larger. Sometimes it's not fun eating BBQ when someone's bum is in your face...ack!"
I was told this is the closest you can get to Texas barbecue in the city and I have to agree so far.  I haven't found a BBQ place that tops Smoque.
Delicious. The best BBQ pork and brisket sandwiches PERIOD.
"Wow wow wow!  Brisket! Tender Pulled pork, Baby backs, Brisket chili, Mac and cheese, I could go on and on... Seriously the best BBQ in Chicago hands down.. Otherwise prove me wrong... Great great great establishment... 5 star food."
Best BBQ in Chicago. Super casual and it's BYOB. Even if there's a line it moves really fast! Highly recommend it!
This place is unbelievably good.  Nice to know they're from my alma mater!
"Good BBQ. Tangy, vinegary sauce. Excellent Mac and Cheese (eat it there, it doesn't travel well). Peach cobbler? More please!"
"I like this place. Good food and a pleasant atmosphere. This place does almost everything right. Carnivores will enjoy the variety of meats, side dishes to how you want your meal prepared. This place has ""Hungry Pig"" written all over it. But, the sticking point for me is the sauce. I'm just not into the sauce man. The sides are also pretty damn good, with cornbread being my favorite. This place does everything better than any barbecue place in the area but, again, it is the sauce that fails. It's good but not great."
"Came to this place through a friend's recommendation. Probably had too high of expectation, the experience ended up to be somewhat disappointed. it is a very very small place far from the city that takes no reservation, you order at the counter and find your own table kind of place. way too crowded and I felt like I ate in a hurry because so many people were standing around looking for a place to sit. I had the half slab st. luis ribs which I thought was slightly dry and not alot of meat to eat. my bf had the sliced brisket platter with sides and we thought the portion was a bit small and left hungry even after eating. The only thing out of this meal that I think is good is the candied jalapenos and the corn bread. you would have to ask for the candied jalapenos when ordering food since it is off the menu.No comments on the service since it is basically a self-serve place. For the price we pay for our meal, I would prefer going somewhere else with better atmosphere and not eat in a rush."
"Good BBQ, Good craft beer selection."
love their brisket...their ribs was ok
"Absolutely the best! You cannot go wrong with anything you order. Brisket is of course elite. Everything else is of the highest quality, even usual side-throw-away items like the coleslaw (that tangy vinegar goes great with sweet bbq sauce) and fries are killer. If you haven't been and you are from Chicago - what is wrong with you!"
"Decent but not life changing BBQ.  It's all been good when I've been there (a few times, but it's been a bit).  Kind of crazy waits during nice days."
"It's 5pm where to go for sime great BBQ? Smoque that's where. It's our first time here and it was amazing. 1st street parking is a must. Park on Pulaski if possible. 2nd when you walk in and not sure what to order? No problem the owner is more than happy to meet and greet you at the door and help you pick out something you'll love to eat. The food well unless you try it for yourself I cant explain it except WOW. Definitely one of the best places in Chicago if the Best for BBQ.P.S. If there's a line outside the door to get in, belive me it's well worth the wait."
"Coming to Illinois from North Carolina I was anxious to find some decent barbecue. Smoque gets me through my cravings. The meat had a nice smoked flavor. The sauce is lacking, but that is always a matter of preference. I miss the vinegar tang of NC style. Smoque's sauce seems to straddle a few different styles of sauce so it never quite lands anywhere I like. On side dishes, coleslaw is a winner, and mac and cheese was good, if a tad dry. Loved the individual serving containers. The peach cobbler is dreadful. Crunchy peaches!? No thanks."
this place is AWESOME!!! i missed it so much especially when i'm aboard. gotta have some of their baby back rib and peach cobbler soon!
"WORTH THE WAIT.  Bring your appetite and patience and you will be awarded with delicious food.  Better yet, order online and pick-up.FOOD:* Chopped BRISKET is smoky and delicious. A cup of BBQ sauce is served on the side for you to slather your meat the way you like it.  Choose Regular or Spicy sauce.* Side dishes come in portion cups perfect for one person. (You wouldn't want to share anyway, they taste so good!)  I especially like the MAC AND CHEESE (creamy cheese sauce topped with crunchy breadcrumbs) and the PEACH COBBLER (sweet peaches with a caramelized crust).* COLESLAW comes with every platter and has a light vinegar dressing.  The coleslaw alone is no show-stopper, but its crunchy texture and mild flavor provides the contrast needed to support the meat and sides.  WAIT-TIME and DINE-IN SERVICE:A line ran out the door during during the our entire visit (Friday night dinner).  From waiting in line to sitting down to eat, we only waited a 1/2 hour.  Smoque was managing the seating process, so there was no pressure in racing to save tables which was a HUGE PLUS.  RESTAURANT SIZE:The place is really tight. The line runs out the door and there is no area to wait for your order.  Tables are jam packed, so it is difficult to dine-in with a large group or if you have kids that need to move around.PARKING:Private lot behind the restaurant fits about a dozen cars.  Street parking available.  I'm not sure how difficult it is to find parking, since we were able to secure a spot in the lot."
This place is great! I would suggest the ribs (baby back) and the cornbread.
"Enjoyed the pulled pork and BBQ ribs. My sister ordered a meal that came with 1/2 a slab but it was a bit too small, according to the wait staff, and they gave her a full slab instead! Great service and great food!"
"Even a block away you smell the smoke coming from smoque! And it's simply calling out to you to go in . . . .I always go for the half and half sandwich of pulled pork and sliced brisket. Its just the perfect combination of heat paradise sandwiched in a bun. The brisket is cooked really slow and it simply melts in your mouth. The sauce has the right mix of tangy, sweet and sour mix that just complements the meat. One time I was shocked to see a line piled up outside the store and took more than 45 minutes of a wait. Was I pissed? Yes I was! I was hungry and I was going for takeout! But when I finally got home with my treasured meats in a bun, it was worth the wait. They should expand the store and open up on mondays!!!"
Best BBQ in the city in my opinion.
Delicious! Peach cobbler is wonderful! Prices are reasonable. But the lines are long. Guess that's what happens when you have wonderful food.
So good. The chili is amazing!
Best barbecue I've had in the city... and better than the BBQ I've had in some cities known for their barbecue as well. Not to be missed. Thank God I don't live closer or I'd be there all the time.
"If it weren't for the hype it MIGHT have gotten five stars, but for all the hype I was expecting something truly amazing.  Don't get me wrong, most of the items were quite good, I'd say the brisket was at the top and the pulled pork was also quite good, but the baby back ribs and some of the sides let me down a little.  A good place worth going to, but not sure it is worth a trip too far out of your way.  Saying that, I do need to get back to this place..."
"Really strong BBQ. I got the 1/2 Baby Back Ribs with Peach Cobbler and Mac & Cheese. The ribs were not quite off-the-bone but were big enough helpings to fill me up. I would say the meat needed a bit more flavor, but that just may be that I'm not so hot on dry rubs. The entire platter was a bit small compared to the price ($14-15), IMO.BYOB and be ready to stand in line. I went around 7pm on a Saturday and it was about 25-30 minutes from foot in the door to the first bite. Not bad for a place that always has ""a line out the door."""
"Love Smoque. Consistent quality, meat is always moist and tender and very good. My favorites are the chicken and ribs. Not a fan of their sides."
"Hands down the best BBQ joint in Chicago.  Super tasty.  Very consistent.  Awesome sides.  Don't stuff yourself silly with ribs and brisket without trying the mac and cheese, peach cobbler, or dipping your fries in brisket chili.  This place is legit."
"What makes this one of the best bbq places in chicago is the variety.  You dont get this type of variety at other bbq places.  Other places might have better items singuarly, but you have to look at the whole when you come here.  Add to that great service, its a no brainer.  I just wish they had more seating, because this place deserves it."
"I'm a BBQ snob and Smoque is as good as it gets.  If you like Smoque and find yourself in STL, try Pappy's and/or Bogart's, you will not be dissapointed."
"nom nom nom. This place hits the spot when you're in need of some good ol' comfort food. Smoque actually reminds me of Brasa in Minneapolis, but is not as healthy-feeling. We got the baby back ribs, brisket, and pulled pork platters with all the sides they offer. Our favs were the brisket and pulled pork. The baby back looked dry but actually weren't. However, none of us were a fan of the dry rub marinade (that's a personal preference b/c my mom's ribs are 100000x better than anyone else's, including Smoque's... sorry!). I actually like Smoque most for the smokey (ha.. ha...) flavors in its meat and its sides. The sides are def my fav. I would recommend the mac n' cheese, corn bread, peach cobbler, and fries. The cole slaw comes with every platter and is one of the best I've had."
"This is a review by a southerner & daughter of a BBQ enthusiast.Having lived across the South, I deem myself an authority on sweet tea- this place got it right. The darkness showed the steeping was done just right with just the amount of sugar to sweeten, not turn beverage into syrup. The brisket is on par with any that I've had in Texas. The beans were adequate but not my mother's. The ""cobbler"" was tasty but more of a crumble & not a cobbler (Smoque tops peaches with sweet, crispy, buttery oats-yum! but not cobbler)."
"It's been over 2 years since I have been back to Smoque (I only remember because I last took out of towners who were in October of 2010) and it was better than I remembered. It's silly that I don't go more often since its roughly 15 mins with the highway being clear. Anyway...Went in around 245 on a Sunday and there was a line that ran up to the entrance with almost all tables occupied. After placing my takeout order I stood close to where the food was going out and I have to say the efficiency of the restaurant is very good and the way it should be. All too often I observe issues at different places of business that could be fixed so simply!When my order was called I found a well packed brown paper bag and asked if the sauces and both ""taste"" portions were in, the girl at the counter gave me an assured yes and that was enough for me!I came home to find everything I ordered!FOOD:Chicken - I think this may be the best chicken preparation I have ever had, it originally was taken by the Publican, but I think in terms of chicken, Publican has to take a 2, albeit a VERY high 2. The chicken looks EXACTLY like it does on their site, perfectly moist, smoked and they browned exterior carrying a ridiculous amount of flavor. I will not go to Smoque and ever not get it.St. Louis taste - love the taste option here and love the fairly hard to find St. Louis rib which was DELICIOUS.Brisket - I love brisket, but not sure if I've ever had any that rocks my world, I get it when I get bbq. It was good, wish the top layer of fat was slightly thinner, although it's not thick by any means.Coleslaw - I wish they would chop it after its shredded, great flavor but think theirs would benefit from a confetti cut.Mac & Cheese - It's good, very good, but my personal preference is a ""drier"" style with less cream, rue like binding. I get disappointed by most macs, and I am grateful that I can be satiated by a few bites!Peach cobbler - OMG - will get it every time, it's divine.The food is GREAT, I think in terms of all the barbecue spots in the city outside of Chicago Q and Lilie Q since I haven't been, SMOQUE is KING!Glad to see this place thriving I wish they had a food truck and other locations, I don't see why they couldn't open up 3-5 other locations throughout and not do well!"
I like the simple nature of this place.  Great BBQ.  Great selection.  Low key.  Whats not to like?
"This is the best place in the world for chopped brisket and hand-cut french fries!  So good, in fact, that I have yet to ever try anything else on the menu - I just don't need to.  The brisket is consistently juicy and delicious with a near-perfection darkening of the outside (that gets mixed in when they chop it so I always order chopped instead of sliced).  And the fries are consistently crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  (So many places have trouble getting a really good crunchy outside, but Smoque gets it right every time.)  And for such a tiny restaurant, I think they actually do a really good job making sure everyone gets a table without having to wait - that is, after making it through the long wait just to place your order.  I've seen the line go outside the door, but it actually moves fairly quickly.  YUMMY!"
Very good place to eat. Friendly service clean facility. Parking ok on street. Line moves kind of fast. Food is awesome.
"Being a Texas native, I'm a bit biased when it comes to BBQ. I like it flavorful (smoked, not drenched in sauce) along with some good sides. Smoque fits the bill for midwest bbq, however I will be trying some other BBQ restaurants to see what else is out there.We had the chopped brisket sandwich and the pulled pork. Both were good, and I would order the chopped brisket again, but the pulled pork just didn't taste too great. Their amazing spicy bbq sauce made up for this, however the meat doesn't stand out on it's own. Their sides are pretty delicious. I enjoyed their cole slaw, which held back on the mayo in favor of vinegar, a big plus in my book. Their mac and cheese was good, however I wish I would've ordered their fries, which on the plate next to me looked delicious! I would recommend the sliced brisket or the ribs here, they both looked good and when I return that's what I'll be having."
"I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this place yet. This is the BEST BRISKET i've ever had in my life. This is coming from a Texan. When I moved here from Texas, I assumed that I would only have good BBQ when I went back home to visit family but this place is amazing! I make the hour hike over here for the fatty, perfectly charred piece of brisket that always makes its way to my plate when I get here. I haven't been in a few weeks and thats a shame. See you next week smoque!"
Good. Sides are small and I like all of them except for the coleslaw. The peach cobbler is outstanding. After tasting most of the menu I think the brisket and St. Louis ribs are your best bets.
Just OK BBQ....I was not impressed with the meat or the sauce but I tried it because of all the hype received in the reviews. The ribs were the best thing on the menu. The brisket and pulled pork lacked seasoning and while the pulled pork also lacked moisture. I give it three stars because the service was excellent but the food still leaves a lot to be desired.
"A friend introduced my hubby and I to this place and we are forever grateful!When I am craving BBQ... Smoque is the place. If eating in..get there early - it gets packed!  Best bet: order ahead and take it to go.We usually get the platter and ""add a taste""...that's a great way to sample their menu offerings or get more of your favorite (mac & cheese!)You can't go wrong with Smoque!!"
Best brisket ever!!!
Love the brisket and pulled pork.  Fabulous french fries!  To me the ribs are too dry and hard and the cole slaw has too much vinegar. I live nearby so I do carryout.  To me its not good enough for a an hour or more wait.
"It was good queThe brisket chili is worth coming to smoque forBut the brisket is not the best, but okThe baked beans were also okThe brisket , beans, and sauce were slightly blandThe beans and sauce were overly sweetWhen considering BBQ outside of the capitals of KC,Memphis,Texas, and the Carolina's Smoque is probably a four star, but when compared to the capitals it falls short"
"Im sad because I live so far, and I crave for the brisket here. SO delicious. I will be back though!:)Super good!"
"I'm a southern girl, from Louisiana/Texas and this place is LEGIT. The brisket is the best i've ever had in my life. The sausage is good, the pork is good. My first trip i loved the ribs, but my second trip they were a bit dry. The fries are great and crispy. The peach cobbler is my favorite part!"
"I went to Smoque one night when the meat was just dry and not-so-good, but every other time I have been it was wonderful.  I am not a fan of the communal seating, the waiting in line to order, and the funky way they take care of seating, but the food makes it worth it.   I didn't much care for the brisket chili, but everything else I have had has been delicious.  The staff has always been very nice.  I would recommend the place.  There is a small parking lot in the back that is free, but not easily seen!"
"Ok, so after numerous recommendations to dine here, I finally did so.  What was I waiting for????  SOOOO delicious.  You're definitely missing out if you don't take the time to try their St. Louis ribs!  It will become the basis in which you judge the rest of the ribs you ever try in your life time!Seasoning is perfectly tasteful and meat so tender. Mac and Cheese was a perfect compliment.  However, I just loved the Slaw.  I've never been a big slaw person, but I almost loved it as much as the ribs.TRY THIS PLACE!!  IT'S A MUST!!!"
"Sure it gets crowded.  But it is damn good bar-b-que, and some of the best this side of the Mason-Dixon."
"Went back to Smoque for a late lunch, with a girlfriend after hours of garage sale shopping. The line for service was out the door and onto the sidewalk! So - we called our order in - waited comfortably in the shade on a bench in a little park 1/2 block away, then strolled back to pick up our brisket sandwich order. Walked back to the park, and enjoyed our meal al fresco! (This was definatly the way to go!)Oh yea - food was excellent!"
"Had good BBQ here tonight but just don't know what all the fuss is about.   Its not THAT good.  The chicken is excellent.  I'm usually not a huge fan of BBQ chicken but Smoque's is moist, juicy, and tasty.  The pulled pork is pretty good...nothing to write home about though. And the beef brisket is well below average.  All the sides I tried were ok (nothing remarkable though).Next!"
"Truly excellent bbq.  Beef brisket is moist and tasty. Baked beans are absolutely delicious. Cole slaw is vinegar based, fresh-tasting, and unique (with red onions). Sauce is spicy without being overbearing. Atmosphere is very casual. Wish they had wireless for customers, but I can see they like to move people in and out. I will definitely return!"
"Holy Smoque, this is possibly the best barbeque I've had that didn't come from my dad's grill. We stopped in on a Friday afternoon and walked right up to the counter, ordered from a very friendly young man and grabbed a table after filling our cups with some sweet tea (which is a must with southern barbeque). Shortly thereafter our number was called and we dug in. We sampled a bit of everything with the exception of the peach cobbler, ribs and chicken. I chose the brisket, brisket chili (lay off me, I spent my formative years in Texas and I love brisket) and fries as my sides. My dining companions went with the pulled pork, cornbread and macaroni and cheese and the brisket and Texas sausage, baked beans and cornbread. The brisket was delicious. It was juicy and surrounded by the most flavorful bark. It was so good, I let it go sauce-less. The Texas sausage is another matter. On its own, it's good. It's spicy. But, it needs the sauce. It's almost as if it was made to pair with Smoque's sauce because when you put the two together, it's barbeque bliss. The pulled pork was melt-in-your-mouth good. But, I'm glad I chose the brisket. And the sides were amazing! The brisket chili is Texas chili at its finest. It was so well-seasoned and chock full of brisket, beans and tomatoes. I wanted to take a quart of it home so that I could slip into something more comfortable and get in some alone time with it. The cornbread was sweet and savory, with kernels of corn throughout, and perfect for sopping up every last bit of the sauce from my plate. The baked beans were super tasty but paled in comparison to the chili. Now, I do not go out of my way for macaroni and cheese but Smoque has me singing a different tune. It was rich and topped with bread crumbs. It was so good your granny would be tempted to ask for the recipe. Let us not forget the coleslaw that comes with all the platters. It's just cabbage and vinegar (apple cider vinegar maybe?) and perhaps some seasoning but it is fantastic. It's clean and simple and it pairs perfectly with richness of the meats. I loved it, loved it, loved it. And the sauce is divine. It's the love child of Memphis barbeque sauce and Texas barbeque sauce. It's vinegary and spicy and the stuff Smoque makes will stay there forever if you dare to get it under your nails...So get that frown off your face, Smoque's gonna replace it with a smile and a dream come true. You probably won't see a pretty girl dancing to jug band music but you will get a mess of some of the best barbeque."
WE love it!  These guys get BBQ right - but the wait can be horrendous now that they have been reviewed on TV - The sides are great too!  I like the ribs but next time I will try the brisket - and take more home and the sauce too!!!!I hear they have an outside eating space but that will not work with winter coming  so maybe it is best to take out - it is a long drive for us from the burbs but we have friends that love it too and we can deal!!!
My boyfriend and I have tried almost every known BBQ joint in Chicago! Smoque is by far the best place for Brisket and all things BBQ!
"Service could be a bit friendlier. Mid-twenties girls who would rather be on their phones texting. Not rude, but ""just"" get by.Food is GREAT! Try the chopped brisket sandwich!"
Great ribs. Can't wait to go back.
Best BBQ in the city!!!
Great food. Sliced brisket platter with mac n cheese and fries. Best Brisket I've ever had thus far. Sides were damn good including the slaw. Line was out the door at 8:30pm Saturday night. Well worth the 45 minute drive and wait.  Highly recommended.
Great food!
"Sometimes when it comes to the power of Yelp and the ""hot spots"", you just become a number.  This is one of those cases.  I'm just a number.At Smoque, simplicity is key...well that is til it comes to the intense smoquey flavors.  Usually I don't care for smoked foods, but here it's welcomed because they must do it right.So how it works (ordering, not barbecuing--it's probably a secret) is you jump in line, wait, order your food, [behind the scenes it's prepared via a kitchen assembly line], await your order number to be yelled, have the host seat you (or grab any seat you can find), and dig in.  The messier the better--I mean it's BBQ after all!  Just make sure you have your metal platter underneath and a roll of endless napkins at arm's length.  More food than necessary and delicious Mac N Cheese and Baked Beans sides.  I was just recently in St. Louis and Smoque's ribs are ultra close to perfection.  St. Louisians would be proud!If the owners keep up with Yelp, I see that they love keeping it to the basics (like BBQ should be) but for time's sake, they need an electronic number sign reading orders to be picked up versus having their poor employee continue to lose his voice."
"I'm giving Smoque an extra star just for the delicious smell that permeated our car on the way home. If I could have eaten just that smell alone, I would have been satisfied for the rest of my life. So, I was a liiittttlllee disappointed when I actually got some of that food into my mouth. Just a little bit disappointed. Not ridiculously so. I got a 1/2 slab of the St. Louis ribs, which Smoque recommends as their ""most authentic"" smoque experience with sides of mac n cheese, corn bread and slaw (I know. You just gained 5 lbs thinking about that, didn't you?)My husband got the pulled pork with sides of the BBQ beans, corn bread and slaw.My ribs were good. I liked the tangy sauce, but I didn't need a lot of it because the meat was smoked well, so it wasn't dry. The meat was tender and while I find the description of meat as ""falling off the bone"" pretty disgusting, this meat did come off easily without being too fatty. They're really the only reason I am giving Smoque 3 stars instead of 2 (even with the extra star for smell alone). The pulled pork was just ok. I'm biased because my husband makes a delicious pulled pork and I didn't think Smoque's was any better than his. The sides were, well, meh.  The mac n cheese didn't have much flavor to it, and I am not a fan of the bread crumb topping at all. Come to think of it, the corn bread didn't have much flavor either. It was pretty dry and I have had better from a box from Trader Joes. Husband said the beans were good, I thought they were just ok. Honestly, the slaw was pretty bad. I thought I would like it more because it's not too saucy, which is good for me considering that in my version of hell, everything is covered in mayo. But it just wasn't good. The cabbage pieces were too large and again didn't have a good flavor. I took two bites and offered the rest to my husband, who will eat pretty much anything, and even he declined. Oh well. We called ahead and picked it up, so I didn't have to wait in the line out the door when we got there. I just walked right up to the pick up counter, paid my $30 and got out of there. I'm glad I didn't have to wait very long. So, all in all, Smoque was just as the rating says, ""A-OK"". It's a good option for winter months when you don't want to BBQ yourself, and I prefer Smoque to other BBQ joints I've tried in the city. That being said, Smoque isn't putting Chicago on the map in terms of BBQ, but it will do in a pinch."
"Frankly, the best brisket in Chicago.  BYOB is a plus too."
"Smoque delivered a cultural experience. The place is a picturebook playland of Americana indulgence.  Sitting next to us were two groups competing for our attention: (1) a group of happy ladies practically pouring hot sauce in each other's mouths; and (2) a table of foodies proudly displayed Half Acre growlers.  This place has become a destination and people make an event out of it.The food here is delicious, but I have a couple tips-worth of advice.  First, if you don't want to deal with the out-the-door line (especially in the winter) order take-out 45 minutes prior to your arrival.  It'll help you make a quick getaway.  Second, if you're real hungry and debating between the platter and the sandwich meal options, go for the sandwich and add the sides.  My platter portions were noticeably short-shrifted, meat-wise, in comparison to the sandwich options.One more thing - my palette may not be refined, but barbeque isn't the most demanding of dishes.  As I see it, the difference comes in two basic angles: the smoke flavor of the meat and the taste of the sauce.  Smoque delivers a nice cedar flavored pork sandwich and a citrusy barbeque sauce.  There's a lot of hype here, but you'll probably walk away satisfied with your meal."
If you like BBQ try this place. Im not a huge BBQ fan but their brisket is out of this world tender and has great flavor. The ribs are good and the mac n cheese is heavenly.Frank Campeglia (The Food Club)
"When ever I'm in the Old Irving Park area I think of this place and most often then not, I end up going here and ordering their sliced brisket, BBQ beans, cornbread and slaw...yummy. A real good place for BBQ that's conveniently located near the expressway (Kennedy off Pulaski Ave.)."
"Yes! I can finally get good brisket. It's smoky and moist! Plus, the Mac and cheese is pretty fantastic."
"After much rescheduling with my BBQ lovin' buddies, and many dashed dreams, we finally made it to Smoque.  Unfortunately we finally made it to Smoque after Smoque finally made it on TV.  I will damn Guy Fieri to Hell for making me wait in a one hour line.  I am old, and I am hungry.  Bite me.At least we were richly rewarded for our wait in line.  Pulled pork platter was a great choice.  My pile o' pulled pork was juicy and topped with some excellent BBQ sauce.  The cole slaw was zingy, and the mac n cheese holds its own against Fat Willy's.  Yup, I said it.  I was sad that they were out of peach cobbler (I blame you Guy Fieri) and I opted for some brisket chili which was good, but not as great as my other goodies.  I enjoyed sitting next to some feisty old folks who tore into some ribs like their dentures were cemented in.  I hope to be just like them some day.  I guess I'll come earlier next time, or start a rumor that the cobbler is full of rat poison.  One of those two."
Best BBQ I've ever had! The peach cobbler and ribs are aaammmazing! I'll definitely be returning!
Great BBQ - there aren't many good BBQ places in the city. This one is worth it.
"Amazing!  Love the ribs, slaw, mac and cheese!  Great and quick service.  This is my favorite BBQ spot in town!"
"great bbq. the sliced brisket is a must try, but all of it is good there."
"Their BBQ sauce is incredible.  I crave it.  It is unlike any other BBQ sauce I have ever had.  I would drink it from the bottle right now if I could.  It is that good.Their ribs are not dripping with grease and I appreciate that.  The meat is just moist enough.  It isn't dry at all. I'm sorry to use the word moist because it is a really grating word, but I can't think of another word to use.  I didn't care for the macaroni and cheese at all.  The peach cobbler was good.I haven't been back to try other sides, but I will go back when I can.  It is definitely straight up cafeteria style, but not in a kitschy way.   I appreciate that, too.  Street parking can be difficult, but don't let that deter you.  Take the bus if you can.  You won't regret visiting here."
"I like it, but it's not going to get on the super-special-express anytime soon for me.Sides were okay. Place is accessible. Service was okay.The main food, underwhelming. The sauce on the meats was good (seemed like the same sauce no matter what you ordered).Here's my issue. The smoke seemed fake. It tasted like they used smoked flavorings in their sauce rather than actually smoking the food. I could be wrong, but that is what it tasted like. Their website says otherwise of course, everything in this place is smoked and everything is smoked using varied woods depending on the dish (they expertly chose the right flavor combinations). I don't know, I've been in a few chili-cook-offs that had contestants with very apparent smoke-flavoring and that's what my meal here reminded me of.I had the beef brisket that was incredibly tender, but it wasn't very flavorful on areas that the sauce had not touched. I'm okay with this now that i know I must be equipped with enough sauce.Fiance had the chicken and I am incredibly glad they didn't overcook it. I hate overcooked chicken. It was cooked well, moist and fell off the bone. Again, the sauce issue, but the chicken did have it's own flavor.Forgot to mention that I would return if I'm craving BBQ and if we're too lazy to make it ourselves. However, I wouldn't make this my ""go-to"" for BBQ.......hey, that rhymes."
Once you've had Smokin' Woody's there not much comparison... I like their peach cobbler. That was good..
I absolutely love this place. It is an authentic BBQ joint and amazingly good at a very fair price. I am from the South and this place is way up there in the world of great cooking and smoking. I love going there to eat. It is a total everyman place. The folks who run the place are down to earth and just really great and friendly. There is no pretense. They know who they are and they know how to turn out a delicious product and they seem to really appreciate their customers. It really does not get any better.
"This place got super packed since I last time I came here! holy cow! perhaps it's because it was on diners, drive-ins, and dives?  maybe...so there's a crazy line out the door now where you wait to go in and order. There isn't much room for tables but the nice part is that one of the guys takes down your party size and helps you look for one (maybe this is only on busier nights?)I got the sliced brisket. They put the marbled ones on top so that the first bite is deliccccious. The ones on the bottom only have a layer of fat on top so it's a big tougher on the bottom.  The sliced brisket gets cold FAST. I sat down and started eating and my second slice was already cold.The bf shared ribs with a friend and we both thought the St. Louis was much better. More Meat = More Delicious! (Not really but it was in this case)The mac and cheese is baked with a crust on top. 2 Thumbs Up and a Big Toe!"
"Big, bold, smoky BBQ flavors and that's what smoque is all about.  The only downside that it's not good for your cardiovascular system but who cares when you've got awesome briskets and ribs in front of you.  I am a fan of their sides as well, mac n cheese and cole slaws are my favs.  The service is great as well, the guy who took our name down for seating told the cashier to do half-half on ribs (st. louis and babyback) and different sauces for us to dip our ribs & pulled porks into.  Be ready for a smoky BBQ meaty goodness when you walk in!"
Great ribs. Try the beans even if you are not a bean lover.
Still my favorite BBQ in the city. If you plan to eat there make sure to arrive early. Or do like we do and get the brisket to go! The sides here are very good as well.  You really can't go wrong with just about anything on the menu.
"Torn. Don't get me wrong - the food was very good. I am torn over giving this three or four stars. However, the hype had me thinking I would enter the pearly gates of BBQ heaven and it just wasn't so. We sampled a bunch of things - brisket , ribs, pulled pork, etc.  All of it was very good and there wasn't a thing we didn't like. However, it wasn't in a different universe from other BBQ I've had. I've had comparable good BBQ.  The coleslaw and Mac and cheese sides we excellent. Would I go back? Yes. Will I wait in some crazy line (we didn't - went ""off hours"" -  but, I've seen others do so)? No. Food was very good - service was really good, too. The guys busing the tables were super helpful with doggy bags, etc."
"Firstly, I'm a vegetarian. Not a strict vegetarian, but I haven't ordered my own meaty meal in quite some time. My partner on the other hand, is from St. Louis, grew up on BBQ and is very picky when it comes to it. We ventured to Smoque on a Monday, walked in and were graced with the heavenly smell of smoked meat. Looking at the sides, I decided I wanted to try everything--a side of beans, corn bread, french fries, and a small salad should be more than enough for this vegetarian. My boyfriend ordered the sliced brisket platter with mac and cheese and cornbread--We also opted to add the 1/4 slab of STL ribs. Food arrived at the table in just a few minutes, and we were both silenced by the deliciousness.Mac and cheese: perfectly cheesy, not overly creamy.Corn bread: Seeing as I'm not from the south and cornbread has never been a staple in my diet, I found the cornbread to be delicious. My boyfriend was a bit skeptical of it, giving it an 8/10.Beans: smokey, saucy, sweet, tangy...awesome.Salad: For a bbq place, they do salad quite good! Sunflower seeds, tomatoes, and a great dressing!Brisket: My boyfriend said it was comparable to Kansas city bbq, apparently the capital of all bbq.Ribs: I haven't eaten a rib in too many years to even remember, but I caved. It was frigin awesome. Fries: Crispy, not too greasy either (dip them in the rib sauce!!!)Coleslaw: tangy and vinegary, perfect compliment to all the sweetness from the bbq~Overall, an awesome experience. We'll definitely be returning!"
"This place is always super crowded no matter what time you arrive here. The BBQ here is Southern Style with a New Orleans twist. The sauces are tangy, sweet and/or hot, but they are definitely off the chain! I always order either their fall off the bone ribs and/or their brisket sandwich.  The sides are very small and more appropriate for a 3 or 4 year old child. Their price point is moderate, but not super inexpensive. This is one of my favorite BBQ joints in the city.  The service is well organized and the super long lines move relatively quickly.  This is a hole-in-wall type of place.  Have you heard of ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives""?  The Triple ""D"" show with Guy Fieri?  I would describe this restaurant as a ""Dive"" Diner. It is very small and tables are close together. There is outdoor seating during the summer months (albeit a small one). The main attraction at this ""Dive"" is the food. Go here for an early lunch and skip all the crazy long lines at dinner time. Once I went here at 8 pm and it was super crowded even late in the evening. Parking can be a bit challenging, but it is free street parking only. I give the food four stars. The customer service gets three stars. Although this is one of my favorite BBQ joint, I sometimes think it is over-rated. I have tried to figure out what is ""unique"" about their BBQ compared to other BBQ restaurants in the city -- I can't come up with anything!  This is a place where one stands in a long line, order your food at the counter, pay for your food, THEY TELL YOU WHERE TO SIT, wait for your number to be called (listen hard because it gets very, very loud in this place) and pick up your food and beverages. They accept major credit cards and/or cash."
"My husband likes to make runs to here whenever he has the chance. We always get the baby back ribs without the sauce. SO TASTY EVEN WITHOUT SAUCE and I usually don't like it dry. I don't think the sauce makes it better either. I can finish a full slab all by myself and I'm a small girl.Now the sides...Cole Slaw - love the vinegary, oniony, peppery sauce for the slaw; different from most places using mayoMac n Cheese - don't think i've had better mac n cheese anywhere around here. the bread crumbs on top are a nice touch.Dessert is Peach Cobbler - i have never tried actual peach cobbler other than like peach cobbler flavored stuff. i was in for a very good surprise. too bad the portion was so small. I should get more than one.Please go if you're ever in the area."
the mac and cheese. the mac and cheese. that's all.
"LOVE LOVE LOVE their BBQ. Went last night around 8:30 p.m. and there was absolutely no line. So unusual!! The BBQ is delicious...smokey ribs, tender melt-in-your mouth brisket, and tasty pulled pork. Love it all, especially all the great sides. Small portions, but it's all you need with the BBQ. I especially love their Peach Cobbler made in house. It's perfectly baked and crispy on the outside with hot peaches cooked on the inside. MmMmm... This place is even BYOB which makes it so convenient and a great place to try out new and delicious BBQ with friends. Try coming during non-rush hours or you'll be expecting a long line. You can not reserve any seats..rather they will ""save"" you a seat after you order. Pork at it's best...YUM!"
"Unfortunately, this isn't 5 stars......perhaps for folks that haven't been to Texas and tried their BBQ, but this does a ""very"" good job making some tasty meat, but it isn't perfect or the best..........so call me ridiculous.Arriving at probably the peak time to eat (8pm), there was  a line from the counter out the door, but it did move at a nice clip.  Now your first inclination is to ask, ""why don't they have outdoor seating?""  Well, I overheard another table say that the neighbors are against it, which is evident by the big signs on the side street indicating that parking along that street is for ""RESIDENTS ONLY.""  But there is plenty of parking on Pulaski, so don't sweat it.When we entered, we had plenty of time to read the big black chalk board showing all the options and items one can partake in this crazy busy place.  We were asked by staff how many in the party and they looked for a table.  Now this isn't community seating, but the tables are so close it might as well be.Our order was placed and I had the brisket....something I dearly miss from Texas and have struggled to find a place that does it as well as places like Salt Lick in Austin in the Mid-west.  It was a brisket platter I ordered which comes with cole slaw and 2 sides.  My sides were baked beans and fries.  By the time we had our order taken and paid we had a table to sit in.  We waited for between 10 and 15 minutes which wasn't that long, but felt longer with all the folks around us eating, plus the smell of the food cooking?!?!?!Our number was called, ""45!!!!!!!!""  and it was time to eat.  The brisket was tender to the point of falling apart when you tried to pick it up with a fork and the sauce was just the right mixture of spice and flavor.  The baked beans had a nice little bite, though my GF didn't think it was enough.  The cole slaw was mild and vinegar based and the fries......well they were just a big bag of fries....personally it was a filler and not spicy or jazzed up and I'd recommend you don't get them, but rather some other side dish, particularly the mac & cheese which is very good.I also had a taste of the ribs, which I thought were very good, even better than the brisket which the meat seem to lack flavor and I found myself dipping it into the sauce on just about every bite. All and all Smoque lives up to the hype, but not in the flavor department in my opinion - at least for the brisket I had that night.  I'm going back, but for the ribs next time!"
"Smoque was OK. The Ribs were good but I wanted them to be saucey - the sauce was on the side - first gripe. For my sides I got Mac and Cheese and Cornbread - the Mac and Cheese sucked, the Cornbread was OK, but there was hard parts in it that kept hurting my teeth - was like eggshells although I'm hoping it wasn't eggshells!!!! It is pretty overpriced for the quantity of food that is given. The one thing I did enjoy was their Peach Cobbler and I HATE Peach Cobbler..it was YUMMMYYY! Overall, I was disappointed - spent way too much money for mediocre food :)"
"Food was great, but because of the super crowded space and wait-time, next time I'll be getting take out."
"This place is decent. I ordered brisket with fries and mac n cheese (for my daughter who didn't like the mac n cheese.)  I also got a side of brisket chili which was a little too salty to me. The flavors are better than your average BBQ joint, but not compelling. The slaw was a little disappointing and the brisket not as flavorful as I had hoped. I prefer Whole Foods' brisket to this one. The service was stellar. There is a somewhat of a wait staff sitting around to answer your questions and do nice things for you. It is clean. I would go back again, but not make a special trip."
"After you get past the cheesy name and logo and the long line you end up with an aluminum tray piled with food. I enjoyed most every morsel.  I had the brisket plate. The meat was cooked mmmm perfectly; however, I would have liked it to be sliced and then cooked some more in the sauce so it could caramelize. Otherwise, the dipping sause is too tomato-juicy in my hypercritical opinion. But, I am crazy. The slaw was superb if you like the non-dairy type (I like both but you probably don't care). I would pass on the standard fresh-cut fries if I went again; although, I did like the cute paper bag they came in.  It's expensive, but the price holds up in my court."
"Best BBQ on the North Side. Often very busy right at noon, so I prefer to go a little later. The pulled pork sandwich is a favorite. The mac and cheese melts in your mouth and has a great texture."
"My boyfriend and I went out to Smoque on a date due to a suggestion from my brother who saw the place reviewed on tv. What we got was not exactly what I was expecting. The place is kind of assembly lined like a fast food restaurant. That is, they turn tables, fast. Also if you think you're getting your own private table to eat your meal, don't count on it. A server walks through the line and gets a count for your party and somehow by the time you get to the front of the line to order your food there is a place to sit. We were set next to a nice couple who makes Smoque a regular stop on their way through the area. Now that you understand how the place runs let me tell you the food is nothing like fast food. The who meal was amazing and I suggest you get one thing and everyone else gets something else so you can sample a little of this and a little of that. Be aware though that they run out of stuff fast due to the fact that they make bbq the way it should be made, over hours or days of cooking. So when they are out, they are out til tomorrow. The food is good but a little pricey for what you get. I'd suggest getting take out and going home with your food so you don't have to pay way too much for your drink. This place blends a very interesting contraction in my head, that is it's runs people through as quick as McDonald's but has the taste and price scale of a higher end restaurant. Worth at least going once, but not somewhere I'd suggest going often unless you've got the bank account to fund it."
"It's been almost a year since I've last been here but the meal was still one of my best.  I had heard great reviews from my sister and friends about this place and I just had to try it for myself.The trip to get there was quite annoying due to traffic and the lines were quite long as well.  However, the meal was fantastic.I had a pulled pork sandwich while my girlfriend had the brisket.  We shared the meal between ourselves and both of them were extremely good.  We each had a side of mac and cheese to go with it which tasted alright, but not the best I've had.The meal was delicious, but was not all that filling for me.  I have yet to try the ribs which I hear are out of this world.  Until next time then..."
"Delicious, I highly recommend. I was here passing through on the fly, wanted some bbq and was not disappointed. Come 'round y'all! I hope to be back soon. You newbies whom have not been here before, go here at least try this place once :-D"
"I'm from the southeast, home to the kings of BBQ.  Trust me, I wanted to knock this place a little because of it's distance from the true BBQ capital but I can't.  What I ate here, my god, I hate to say this but I've had the best BBQ ever and it didn't come from the south.  It came from Smoque.  The owners here know what they are doing.  This isn't just some hole in the wall with good food.  This is the epitome of flavor, tenderness and smoke.I was born in Chicago and moved to the south and now I'm moving back.  Guaranteed that I will be a regular here.  I'm even going to apply to work here, even though they may not let me, I've been smoking my own pork and beef for years and I want to know how they do it.   Only thing that would make it better is if they tried out my mustard, ketchup, vinegar blended sauce that symbolizes all of the Carolinas.  :) Five stars, hands down..."
The brisket was amazing and have good sides.
"I'm from Memphis, appreciate great bbq with some pickiness.  Reluctant to give 5 stars to any bbq restaurant, but the best dishes from this restaurant are worth 5 stars and the worst are 4 stars, so I round up.  Not a lot of great bbq in Chicago (I've been to as many as I can), but this is one of my top 3 and worth visiting repeatedly until you find which 5 dishes treat you just right.  Frequently order to cater for meals with friends and family, most people sing praises.  Beef brisket often amazing, sometimes dry and 4 stars.  Love the beans and cornbread.  Slaw is well-balanced, not too risky...good solid choice.  Worth the time and effort, especially with friends to try many different offerings."
"1st stop on a recent culinary tour of Chicago.  In town for three days staying at the Chicago Hilton.  Grab the blue line to Irving Park where I meet my brother who drove in from the west suburbs.  Light rain, and the Cubs were at home, so fortunately there was no line as described in other reviews.  Can see why locals line up.  We ordered a pulled pork platter and a brisket platter.  Platters came with slaw and choice of two sides. Brisket was delicious, pulled pork was excellent.  After having experienced the pulled pork at Smith's luau in Kauai (whole hog cooked 24 hours in an earth hot stone pit) I have yet to find an equivalent anywhere.  The sides we ordered were Mac&Cheese, Fries, Peach Cobbler, and the brisket chili.  Most notable was the brisket chili.  Was lucky.  Noticed that they had just finished slicing brisket, and they had put all the scrapings in the brisket chili pot prior to serving my portion.  Prices from my perspective as a New Yorker were a bargain for barbecue.  Would spend at least 40% more for the same platters in the city.  One of the reasons I love coming to Chicago is the BYOB, which we took advantage of at Smoque with their blessings.  Will save the 5th star for our next trip when we try the ribs.  The rib standard for me thus far is Rendez Vous in Memphis.  Next stop Hot Doug's for a snack."
"When I evaluate barbecue joints on the North Side, I feel like my experience with baklava is relevant.  The first time I had baklava was in Istanbul.  Not only was it authentic baklava in the most beautiful city in Turkey, but it was from the chef that's renowned from making the best baklava in the world.  It was amazing.  UHMAZING.  The result?  All other baklava tastes like shit to me.    Similarly, I never even tried pork until I hit my twenties.  I grew up in a vegetarian family, and occasionally had poultry or fish.  And I had never had ribs until I came to Chicago - and it just so happens that I was living in the south side and ended up trying it at joints like Uncle John's, Lem's, BK - in fact, the south side is filled with amazing barbecue joints.  The lesson I'm trying to convey is this: when you try something for the first time, don't get the very best.  Its setting you up for a world of disappointment.That said, the ribs from Smoque are what I would describe as SOLID.  They were perfectly done and delicious.  Not very saucy, not particularly flavorful - the menu suggested St. Louis for the ""authentic experience,"" but they were out and we got baby back.  It's a little pricey for what you get, and they charge extra for bread. It didn't capture my heart the way Uncle John's has, but it's close to my apartment, and no one in the neighborhood looks at me and assumes I'm there to buy drugs. It's not a friendly neighborhood joint  - the young lady who took my order didn't even look at me and none of the customers chat in line, but they were perfectly courteous.Since, as I said, I didn't try pork until I became an adult, I get a very minor stomach discomfort when I eat it - which means I only eat it when it's REALLY fucking good.  Smoque doesn't quite warrant the discomfort, but I'm going to be honest - if  I had never tried Uncle John's or Lem's, I'd probably give Smoque five stars."
Everything is great from this place!  Although it gets crowded it is worth every minute you wait.  We normally take it to go and it is packaged up perfectly!
"The people are so friendly and generous I almost don't want to give it a one star for food so I will give them a 2.  I personally almost choked on how dry the barbecue was.  I am thankful we have a barbecue place out here called Al's Barbecue Shack in DeKalb, IL.  Who knew we had such a good thing in my neck of the woods!  I drove about 1 1/2 to dine at this pretty cool chipotle set up establishment because I saw it on TV and they did have the friendliest people you will meet.  But the meat just didn't do it for me I'm sorry Guy Fiere you are WRONG once again.  First it was with Nasty Nana's in Bridgeport and now Smoque which rhymes with choke, which I literally almost did and yes I do chew my food but not ike a grazing cow so maybe it was just an off day.  I wasn't going to say anything that day since the owner was next to me talking to the owner of Urban Belly and he seemed pretty excited delighting him in his food."
"Great food.  Sometimes Yelp hits one out of the park.  I was visiting some good friends in Chicago and Yelp'd some BBQ places.  Smoque looked good and off we went.  The decor is bad.  Cheap paint on the walls, cheap tables and chairs, and so what!  The food is so good I wouldn't care if I had to sit on a cactus.  I travel a lot, and these are my favorite ribs I can remember eating.  BBQ is a very personal thing and I'm sure that if you grew up on a certain kind of BBQ you can always find fault with BBQ that is done different then you are used to.  But don't be a sucka.  This place is great.  Ribs, sausage, brisket, all good.I was there in the winter.  All I can imagine, is bringing a sixer of beer there when the sun is out and it's warm.  Ordering everything on the menu, sitting outside and just killing it."
Worth the wait in line.  Order the brisket and a bunch of sides.  You will not be disappointed.
"OK I think the ""que"" had me thinking this was going to be a higher end restaurant than it was. I for one was very pleasantly surprised! It is reminiscent of southern, no frills restaurants with no frills, just great food. I confess I just had a salad and side of mac and cheese, but my friend had their ribs and fries and vouched for me that they are amazing! The salad was seriously delicious though. Nothing special but the sunflower seeds gave it a fun crunch. It was gigantic and lasted two meals too! I will definitely be back!"
"I have not gone there yet, as I've only had it as a take out order that someone else has gone to pick up.  I'm a huge fan of brisket, so I've only had their sliced brisket sandwiches, but both times they were to die for!  To me there is nothing special about their mac & cheese, but I LOVE their coleslaw!  I am a huge fan of vinegar based coleslaw and their is so good I can't stop eating it!  If you like creamier coleslaw, you will not like this one.I've told my mother & sister about this place, and have made tentative plans for them to come into the city to join me here for dinner.  I know they are going to love it also!"
"I was very anxious to try out this place so two of us stopped by on a Saturday night. The line was out the door which I expected given the excellent reviews found here. I ordered the brisket platter plus a sampler of St. Louis ribs and chose baked beans and french fries for the sides. All their entrees and sandwiches come with a side of coleslaw. Though I love peach cobbler, I had the bread pudding for dessert .The cobbler portion size was child size. The brisket is the best I have every tasted; tender and full of flavor. The St. Louis ribs were just okay. They were not as tender or juicy as I would have expected from here. The barbeque sauce is passable but nothing special. The baked beans were okay but better when I added some brown sugar to my leftovers the next day. The fries are fresh cut and plentiful. I paid an additional $.30 to upgrade my ""free"" coleslaw to a large. Sorry I did that because it wasn't very good. It had too much of a vinegar flavor and wasn't wet enough for me. However, I added coleslaw dressing to my leftovers the next day and the flavor was much improved. The bread pudding was simply delicious. The restaurant is a dumpy kind of place. It is very small, has paint chipping/peeling from the wall, and offers only communal seating. A good size person or a physically challenged individual would have difficulty maneuvering around the restaurant. The staff I interacted was all friendly and accommodating. Surely with all the business this place gets, as well as the prices they charge; they can afford to expand, relocate or rehab their restaurant. Cons: not enough inside space; communal tables; peach cobbler portion too small; pricey. Pros: BYOB, except on patio; free refills on soft drinks."
"We have gotten smoque catered for my work 3 times now, so I have sampled just about their entire menu.Being not the biggest fan of bbq, I was shocked to say that I absolutely loved it...the pulled pork and brisket are AWESOME. The brisket has that char on the outside but is tender on the inside, and the pork pulls part and is nice and charred with different textures. The babyback ribs weren't' as a big a hit w/the crew...I can't handle meat on the bone, so passed on that.Corn muffins come in individual tins and have whole pieces of corn interspersed. Coleslaw isn't my thing, but it is mayo-free. The mac n cheese tastes deliciously terrible for you and it's impossible to stop eating. Great baked beans, and sweet, smooshy 2 hand rolls make this place a great place to add to the list.I can't speak to the interior, but if they can cater food in mass quantities to be that tasty, I imagine on an individual basis it's even better."
"Love the BBQ here, especially the pulled pork."
"Damn good BBQ.  My boy D.P. and I took the Blue LIne up Saturday and we could smell the place before we could see it.  We weren't disappointed.The Saturday 12:00 noon crowd was starting to pile up.  We waited in line to put our order in for about 15 minutes, which was almost not enough time as we were drooling over the choices.  We waited another 5 for a table and a little more than 5 before the food came out.The place is well named - the smoke on the bbq was just right.  The rob on the ribs was amazing by itself, but with the killer sauce it was heaven in my mouth.  I personally liked the St. Louis style over the baby back.The pulled pork was amazing - very juicy and flavorful.  Had a taste of the sausage, which was also good, but not on the level of the pulled pork and ribs.As far as sides - Mac & cheese was solid, the cornbread was good, and the cole slaw had just enough tang (and a few slices of red onion) to cut through all of the fattiness of the meat.  It was a really good palate cleanser.Peach cobbler was bomb.  You gotta try this place out!"
"Good, but over rated."
"Good food...really good. BUT, for having over 1000 fantastic reviews on Yelp, I was expecting something super magical....it wasn't. Recommend it, but I won't brag about the experience to friends like I had hoped."
"Smoque, cooked meat for a  ""certain people""  who stumble though their lives(  smiling) with their life style settings  stuck( rusted) on Appropriate & Strip the Soul Out of  Real Cultural Offerings Auto Pilot.  Smoque offers Sterile cooked meat for a sterile people.  I remember when Carson's Ribs opened and my Grand Father took me there and was horrified. I'm glade he didn't know how bad it would get.I get it,  Smoque is for people who  want BBQ with out having to venture out of their NorthSide comfort zone to experience real BBQ. Well at least go to Brand Market BBQ in Logan Square where it's  at least  much more creative and flavorful and doesn't have all those bros  bro-grubbing downI can't wait for Smoque to bottle and sale their Smoque ( a clear sauce) so all their adoringsuburban and northside  fans can cook the exact same meat in their own ovens and just poor a little Smoque flavor on it twenty five minutes before it's ready to serve."
"#1 BBQ in Chicago no question about it.  I would recommend going to a water park in the summer all day and not eating then stop at this place on your way home and get a full slab of ribs, 2 ginger ales, fries and mac n cheese."
"Writing this review was so difficult, because all that would run through my head was ""Brisket brisket brisket. Brisket, briskety brisket. Brisket!""Excellent little spot that's welcoming during off hours but mayhem during peak.Their cornbread, beans, and mac'n'cheese are nothing to trifle with.Go home with those three sides and you'll be as happy as a clam without even having the most tender (tenderest?) brisket you'll loathe finding a rival for.( Who decided that clams were so happy anyway?... And WHY?!)"
"Smoque catered a dinner I had recently and I couldn't have been happier. The process was simple. They were quick to respond to questions on order size given the headcount, food allergies, and confirming details as the day was closer. The delivery person was on-time, accommodating, and very helpful.And of course the food itself - absolutely delicious.Would order again from them anytime."
"I have been going to Smoque periodically over the last 12 months.   I will say for north side BBQ, it's good.   Generally speaking for a BBQ snob, it's alright.   My likes here are definitely the brisket.   The brisket is top notch with a bit a heat, very juicy and quite tasty.   I find the pulled pork to be average.   I thought the ribs were overcooked and dried out.  As for sides, cole slaw is so so, same for the beans.  People rave about the mac and cheese and I thought it was overrated.   Had brisket chili the last visit and it was interesting.  The fries are fresh cut and very good.Overall, I find it easier to carry out than eat in.  You won't be disappointed but don't expect a WOW moment either."
"Food is great... but the service staff and the guy at the door are more interested in turning the tables as many times as possible during the lunch and dinner rush than creating a pleasant dining experience.  When you ask 17.00 dollars for a lunch entree, you had better make me feel comfortable while I'm there to keep this guy coming back.  Smoque, you could win me back if I start reading better things... forTwin anchors, thanks for making me feel at home.  Oh and having good food too!!"
"ahhh its all right, but as everybody says, they could work with their portions cause some of them are ridiculous small."
"Amazing bbq. Pros: tender, smokey and delicious brisket, creamy mac n cheese, good sweet tea, awesome baked beans. Cons: Small place with long lines, no bread with platters, the bus boys walking around give the uncomfortable feeling of ""hurry up, eat and get out"""
"Our Smoque dinner was 7 hours ago. I've washed my hands plenty of times. My fingers still smell like smoky BBQ. My boyfriend's fingers still smell like smoky BBQ. Yours probably will too. Weird? A little, but it's just a testament to how rich and powerful those smokin' St Louis ribs were. I don't even care how uncouth I may have looked sucking on those bones with all I had in me. I went from sweet Asian girl to frenzied Asian barbarian, fingers coated with that deleeeeeectable spice rub. I apologise, these babies deserved all the love I could give them. Oh, and don't get me started on the peach cobbler. Whatever, right? Peach cobbler is peach cobbler is peach cobbler. False. This, my hungry friends, was some crazy rich buttery heavenly divine PERFECT peach cobbler. If someone reading this discovers the recipe to this peach cobbler, please message me. I will buy you dinner. After reading this review (and the countless others), it should be clear. SMOQUE IS GOOD. Go eat."
"Definitely as good as it gets.  Smoque BBQ is as good as good if not better than anything you'll get in St Louis, Memphis or Kansas City.  If there's a line outside rest assured it's because the food is good.  Don't fret over the line or the wait, if any.  Just enjoy and quit bitchin about any inconvenience to you. The food is worth waiting for.Two thumbs up and more if I had them."
"I frequent Smoque. The brisket and mac & cheese are great. Plus, they serve sweet tea...good bbq and sweet tea puts a smile on this southern girl's face!!!"
"Had fantastic catering from these folks.  First, food is Ah-mazing.  All my guests were raving about the make-your-own pulled pork sandwiches.  Nice and professional folks on the catering staff--they managed a last minute request from me and still got everything done on time.  Someone even had a cart and helped me take all the food to the car. Highly recommend the catering! :)"
"I so wanted to love this place but while the food was good it was not great. After reading all the awesome reviews and watching a segment on the place on the Food Network, I really thought that this place would blow us away but sadly it did not.We got the brisket/pulled pork combo and the pulled pork plate. The pulled pork was pretty good but the mac and cheese and cornbread were borderline stale'ish tasting. My husband really enjoyed the beans and cole slaw and the highlight of our meal was the pulled pork and french fries."
"There's definitely some good eats here. With the best days of summer long gone, the smokiness and selection of food helped me ignore the cold, fall downpour and feel like I was at a backyard cookout in the middle of July.Loved the half slab of St. Louis ribs I ordered. When they say smoked, they mean it! The smoky goodness was intense, but the occasional dip into the provided BBQ sauce rounded flavors out nicely. And these babies are served up nice and HOT--I burned my fingers trying to pick them apart as I hurried through my lunch.The mac & cheese sadly didn't thrill me, but the BBQ beans and coleslaw did. The coleslaw especially since it's my favorite type--cabbage and onions in a light, slightly sweetened vinegar dressing with just a bit of celery seeds. Simple, delicious and a great contrast to all the other rich flavors. I'd give this place 5 stars, but I have nothing to compare it to, especially nothing authentic. Despite that, I'd definitely go back and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anybody in the area looking for some good food."
"This is deliciousness!! The BBQ options on the menu are perfection, but some of the side dishes are just as noteworthy!! I'll be honest, I've never cared for peaches or anything peach-esque. As a matter a fact, if you hand me a peach, I would probably throw it a you. However, I LOVE their peach cobbler. It's so incredibly delicious and the perfect way to end your meal there. Food is always served fresh and prompt. Seating can be difficult as the dining room isn't large and there is always a line out the door on most evening to place your order. But the wait is worth it on every level. If you have never been, I strongly suggest you try this establishment, but you will probably become addicted."
"Smoque BBQ is one of the best barbecue restaurants in the Chicago area. Their food is really good. I love their brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. The sides at Smoque BBQ are great as well. Their macaroni and cheese, fries, and cole slaw are amazing. Try this place out if you're in the area."
"I have moved to California and MISS Smoque.  There are alot of bbq places in Chicago, but this place is by far one of THE BEST bbq joints I have been to."
"Absolutely loved the pulled pork, fries (they give you a TON), Mac N' Cheese, and the peach cobbler. We didn't want to have to stand in line after we decided to go back for a second helping of the mac n' cheese so the manager came and got it rung up for us...Very nice!"
"I L-O-V-E Smoque!!!They have the absolute best brisket in all of Chicago. I like mine Texas style. Moist, delicious, fatty with that peppery salty crust. So many Chicago places have such inferior brisket. Oh man. Now I want some.It's so good I'm pretty confidant I'll be talking to them about catering my wedding."
"Smoque...what can I say about Smoque? I love this place! I had the Brisket, Beans, Coleslaw, fries, and a Mikeska's Texas sausage. The brisket was perfect: nice pink smoke ring, still moist, and full of flavor. Some of the best Brisket I've ever had. The sauce was a perfect compliment to the beef. The sides were very good, but the best part of the whole meal was the Texas sausage. The finest spicy pork  sausage I've ever eaten. Hands down. Nice balance  of spice, fat, and smikey meat, wrapped in a natural casing and smoked just right.I've eaten a lot of BBQ in my life, and currently own a BBQ joint in the Western Suburbs. Smoque is where I go when I'm tired of my own 'Q! If you love good BBQ, you have to try this place. You won't be sorry."
"Sides are tiny, other than that it was amazing."
"It's been a while since I've been here, but I distinctly remember being sort of unimpressed. Don't get me wrong, it's totally fine barbecue, but it has nothing on REAL SOUTHERN STUFF. Also between the meat and the sauce, the sauce is the clear winner. The meat just doesn't fall off the bones the way you'd want it to. It's almost there, but no cigar."
"I live three blocks away from this place. I've had it 3-4 times. It's just ok- and the service is always lacking.That said, the pulled pork is really good. But, overall, Smoque is not a good value."
"Seriously?  I do not get it.  About a week after moving nearby, we tried this place again for take out and the food was worse.  I really do not know why we opted to try them again.  I think the only reason this place popular is because it's been on tv; people feel like they haaave to go and looove it.  The food is just not good.  Dried out, flavorless, spongy, cold, lackluster, boring and did I mention flavorless?  Seriously.  Pork Shoppe, people.  C'mon.  Seriously."
"I'm a HUGE BBQ fan and this place is hands down the best BBQ place in Chicagoland. Everything is good! Smoque (smōk) BBQ is a neighborhood kind of place that cooks up BBQ good enough to make it a true destination. It was created by five regular guys who happen to be passionate about food in general and BBQ in particular.We believe barbecue is at its best when all of its powerful flavors combine and harmonize. The natural flavors of the meat. The savory flavor of hardwood smoke. The spiciness of the rub. The sweetness or pungency of the sauce. When these elements are in balance, you have found BBQ heaven.We've worked hard to match the right cut of meat with the right rub, wood smoke, sauce, and cooking technique. Our proprietary sauces and rubs are lovingly crafted from scratch in our own kitchen. Same goes for our sides.It's a bit more work to do it this way, but we believe the results are well worth it. We invite you to stop by soon and see if you agree.They have everything from pulled pork, brisket and chicken to coleslaw, baked beans, and the best mac 'n cheese I've ever had (except for Alisha's of course). This place not only has amazing BBQ but the owners are extremely hospitable. When I went with about 12 teenagers one of them sat down with us and actually threw our trash away for us. This place is a must if you're a BBQ lover, it never disappoints.Stop by and check 'em out!"
"Great food, super busy lousy parking"
"Yes, Smoque is the BBQ joint in the city, hands down.  Better than Smoke Daddy, better than Pork Shoppe, better than Lillie's Q, better than Chicago Q.  Their vinegar-based sauces is so good that I could almost drink it.  Their brisket was so tender that I didn't need my knife at all.  Their mac & cheese was perfectly cheesy and crunchy with breadcrumbs.  And their peach cobbler was a nice sweet end to the perfect BBQ meal.Smoque is also BYOB!"
"Great food, but still a little overrated.  Get ready to stand in line, especially on a summer weekend the line is up the block.Very friendly and helpful staff!Crowded dining area and it's a bit confusing at first.  There is a huge line, someone taking numbers for a seat (which you don't realize the first trip there).  You stand there watching for a table, go to sit, and then are told that you need a number or to get your name on a table list.  I like Smoque, but will come back when they are on their down hours.PS - right next to a dentist, so stop in for some floss."
"This place is soooo uberly amazing!!  Sad that we're moving to San Jose in two months and just recently discovered this place....I guess that means we'll just have to go here 2-3 times a week before we leave - which we've been doing because it's so darn addicting!  Words can't describe how good the pulled pork and the chopped brisket sandwiches are.  If you've had bad bbq before you know that theyre usually really chewy and dry even with a good douse of bbq sauce.  Totally NOT the case here.....the meat almost literally melts in your mouth, so tender, so juicy, so perfectly delectable that I think I ended up eating twice the amount of food I usually consume in one sitting.  They have a half brisket half pulled pork sandwich in case you cant decide but if I had to pick one I would most definitely go with the brisket because it was a little more flavorful.Sideswise go with the baked mac n cheese, baked bbq beans and fries.  I would personally skip the coleslaw and cornbread but definitely get the peach cobbler for dessert!So when you first get there, get in line to order (you'll see the line when you get there....and there's ALWAYS a line) and afterwards someone will assign you a table.  Don't try and grab a table before you order or you will mess up their whole seating system....I don't know how they manage to do it but it works every time :)  The longest we've had to wait was about half an hour and that was when the line went back to the door so not too bad.if you're looking for good bbq in Chicago, RUN don't walk here ASAP!! :)"
Nice little place. The food was good-only bad thing is that they do not have tips-only slabs. But the pulled pork and sides were pretty decent.
"This has to be some of THE BEST bar b que we have ever had here in the Chicagoland area!!!! The ribs are excellent. My father and I were first timers so we sampled most off the menu.... Ribs: First rate. Seasoned perfectly, falls off the bone and meaty. Texas sausage good, pulled pork ok, brisket good, macaroni awesome, fries great, cole slaw great, the sause great. We were serverd quickly even though it was very busy on a Saturday. Service was excellent. All in all an AWESOME dining experience. Definitly going to roll out there again....."
"Ok so let me start off by saying that I spent much of my life eating Texas BBQ, growing up in Texas.... My dad used to own a deli which was close to Sonny Bryan BBQ (anyone from Dallas knows Sonny Bryan's), and they used to trade lunches. That is the best of the best. I have to say that Smoque runs a pretty close second! I am so excited to have found Texas BBQ in the great city of Chicago - who knew!!!! I went there for my second time today and enjoyed it as much as the first time I was there. The brisket is smoked to perfection and as tender as can be! I recommend the mac & cheese as a side - it is some of the best mac & cheese I have ever eaten. The table set up reminds me of eating in the best BBQ joints in Austin! I highly recommend Smoque if you are craving a great smoked BBQ meal!!!"
"I liked the food, it's what to get if you're looking for down-to-earth no-frills bbq.  it's all about the food, good portions and reasonable prices."
"We've had BBQ from many Chicago places - and some authentic in southern states (TX, LA, etc). Smoque is just ok. Way over-hyped. The portions are very small, the prices are high, the food just ok.Do yourself a favor and explore other BBQ in Chicago. There's much better."
"Smoque has become one of my favorite BBQ places. It's close to my neighborhood, and often I just get it for take out (no lines!) and eat at home, though I love that they are BYOB.I love their St. Louis style ribs (I like my ribs meaty!), pulled pork, sausage and sliced brisket. Though everyone talks up the brisket, its my least favorite of all that. Their macaroni and cheese is pretty damn good, the chili with brisket is good as well. The beans are great as is the cornbread. I'm not a fan of the vinegar-y and onion-y coleslaw though. I wish they had collard greens, that would be amazing and they would be just about my IDEAL BBQ place then.They have pretty good peach cobbler too.The owners are always there, they've gotten the crowd control going pretty well and usually there are no issues."
"With the plethora of BBQ joints opening up in the city these days, Smoque is still the best of the best."
"The only thing that stops me giving Smoque a 5 star is the length of time it can take you, with lines out the door especially in the summer time.This is one of the best BBQ joints in Chicago, have visited multiple times and tried almost everything on the menu and have not left feeling dis-satisfied.The Brisket and the Ribs where by far my favorite, moist meat, good portion size and plenty of extra sauce. Some of the taster options are a nice way to allow you to sample the delicacies without having to commit to buying a full platter.The Mac and Cheese side is one of the best I have tasted, with an interesting bread crumb topping and the portions of fries are extremely large.This place is B.Y.O.B and has also been featured on some Food Network Shows.It is good for smaller groups as there is only 40 seats in the whole place and you can feel rushed as the crowd begins to gather.Parking can be a little tricky and you must get there early if you are not prepared to wait, but Smoque is a truly delectable experience!"
"Hands down the BEST beef brisket that I have had anywhere and trust me, I have had A LOT of it!If you are in the Chicagoloand area, this place is a must, it is a destination!Dr. Michael L. Johnson"
"I was really skeptical since I'm used to southern BBQ but this was SO good that I crave it once in awhile now that I'm back home in Dallas. I ordered a brisket platter that came with two sides of your choice and cornbread. Must I say, the cornbread was AMAZING and moist. The two sides I chose were mac and cheese and coleslaw, YUM.The brisket was the best part, obviously. The second I forked some into my mouth, I WAS IN HEAVEN! It was sooooo delicious and it melted in my mouth! Definitely will make another trip to Smoque on my next trip to Chicago."
"Wow, really impressed, and my expectations were already high!  We traversed here from Oak Park since everyone raves about Smoque.  I'm from the South and one of my friends in the group is originally from North Carolina so we are very picky about ribs. barbecue, etc.  The traditional ribs, and brisket are excellent!  Don't forget to bring your beer, BYOB, oh and the mac and cheese is actually done well, more of the thick bechamel base  over the watery mix typical at other places.  Even when there is a wait, it doesn't feel bad because total wait time includes you+food at the table since you wait to order, then staff get you a table.  Enjoy!"
"this is the real deal.lived in texas for 5 years for work, they really know how to do bbq there, i would eat it every few weeks.smoque has got some great stuff, the chopped brisket, chicken, ribs, brisket chili, beans, all was excellent and had different flavors from each other.BYO, if you forget, go 2 blocks down to the 7-11will definitely be back - they were out of the pulled pork the night we went"
"Smoque Catering beat out two other quotes from other, competing BBQ joints here in Chicago. I recently hosted a large family party at my home and was really excited to serve their food. Two days before the party, I checked-in with Peggy from their catering office and was really unhappy with the way she talked to me. She was short with me, inpatient, and sort of patronized me. It got me really nervous about my order. I admitted to her that a handful of people RSVP'd to the gathering later than I had wished and she managed to bring my conservative $350 order up to nearly $600. It was really more than I could spend but she said this, ""So are you only trying to feed your guests just a taste because if this was my party, I'd order a lot more than what you're ordering."" That statement really made me nervous... I told her a lot of the guests were not big eaters... I also have catering experience having planned conferences for a living professionally... well, I should have gone with my gut.The food arrived, by one of the most helpful guys ever. The food tasted and looked great (the guests loved it) but I can't tell you how much food was wasted. We had two and half extra pans of pulled pork that went uneaten. We had three bags of buns that were never opened. And we had one extra container of slaw. I'd say, about $150 worth of extra food that didn't need to be there. Peggy upsold me and I wished she would have just respected my original order instead of using my uncertainty to bring in more revenue."
"You don't go to a place like Smoque for the ambiance; it's noisy, full of screaming kids, smells smoky (and so will you when you leave!) You go for the amazing food.My S.O. and I braved the nightmarish CTA from Lincoln Park in -20° windchill to sample some Smoque barbecue, and despite the fact that while waiting for the Diversey bus back home I thought my feet might fall off, it was totally worth it.We tried the baby back ribs, brisket, fries, and baked beans. He had their Mac and Cheese, too (I've got a dairy allergy, so none of that for me). Everything was awesome. The ribs had those pink smoke rings in them and the meat was super tender (I don't generally eat pork, but made an exception here), all the sides were delicious, and I liked that the coleslaw was vinegar-based rather than slathered with mayo. I wish the barbecue sauce was slightly spicier, but I just like things that burn my mouth!One of the owners chatted with us before we left to ask how everything was, so I feel like the people who run this place really care. If you're craving barbecue this is the place."
"What an awesome brisket sandwich!  Fries and mac & cheese: also delicious!  Good crunchy, refreshing slaw, even though I personally prefer the creamy variety.  We left stuffed and very happy."
This is the best brisket in the state of Illinois. Probably better than any in Texas. And giving new york city a serious run for its money. Look out Katz and  Carnegie!Jesus and his disciples would have had the last supper here if it were open two thousand years ago.Try the candied jalapeños. They are unbelievable. The peach cobbler totally rocks. it's not an inexpensive restaurant but the value for the dollar is huge.
Tasty as heck.
"I, too, don't have a lot else to add to what has already been said.  My husband and I love this place.  We usually stick to the same thing, although I'm realizing after dining in that I REALLY need to try some of the delicious looking ribs and french fries that I saw.  I love the chopped brisket and pulled pork sandwiches, as well as their BBQ sauce, coleslaw, mac-n-cheese, corn bread, and peach cobbler.  I also appreciate that their sandwiches come in half portions, especially when ordering them with mac-n-cheese and coleslaw.  We usually call in and order the food to-go, but yesterday we got to eat there.  We got there about 6pm and the line just kept getting longer and longer after that.  Everyone was very friendly and we were happy to get a table right after we ordered.  I woke up craving BBQ and I think it's because my hair still smelt like smokey BBQ, made me hungry for Smoque all over again.  :)    It really is not a big space, so although it's BYOB and their staff is very friendly, if you're really hungry or in a rush you may be better off calling ahead and ordering it to go (although I've had to wait for an hour for pick up before - so I guess that can go either way).    Whatever you do, just get there and enjoy some fantastic BBQ!"
"I had the best pulled pork sandwich ever. THe meet was soooo tender, it was just melting in my mouth. I will definitely come again and try their ribs.I would like to say that they have the best hostess I have ever seen in my life. He was very, very helpful to all the customers. Way to go!"
they catered our wedding. the tastiness never disappoints and magically they always have a table ready
"I went in there on a Saturday night and man oh man was it packed. The line was all the way to the entrance. That definitely turned me off right away but holy shit the smell alone in that place and seeing everyone munch made me wanna stay. It took about 20 minutes total to get a table and start eating but it was definitely worth the wait. It was super chaotic in there but the staff was really good about getting people tables and cleaning up quickly after people were done. I had a half a slab of the St. Louis ribs (my personal favorite style), the corn bread and the mac and cheese. The ribs were so damn juicy and the bones pulled clean out. I don't like having sauce on the ribs because I love the taste of the burnt crust and taste the flavor of the meat. The house BBQ sauce they gave was nice and sweet and good. The corn bread was super delicious. The best part was that there was pieces of corn inside. The mac and cheese was super creamy and the best part of that was the bread crumbs on top. That meal was super super good and I definitely loosened my belt when I walked out the door. I'll be back for sure."
"My friends and I drove about 40 min. to try this place (which was featured on diners, drive-ins and dives) for lunch. Since we didn't eat breakfast, we were all getting a little irritable from hunger. But after trying the first bite of our food, we suddenly became very happy -- if you were eavesdropping on our table, you basically would have heard a bunch of ""oh my god""s and ""this. is. AMAZING.""I tried the pulled pork and the brisket. Both were on the drier side, but it had really good flavor. Dipping it into the bbq sauce solved the dryness problem, but masked the natural flavor of the meat. So I ate half without the sauce and half with.I'd say the highlight of the meal was the SIDES. The coleslaw and bbq beans were pretty good (probably b/c they were so sweet?). The mac and cheese was great as well, esp. since the top had that crispy part with breadcrumbs. Also, you must try the peach cobber. It's one of the best I've had. You could come here and just get sides and feel like you had a satisfying meal.Oh yeah, and I had a $10 off $25 alacard coupon, since I came in 2010 -- I don't know if they are doing that this year, but that definitely made it even better!"
It's real good even catered. Been eating it for years.
Best bar=b=que in the Ch
"Best BBQ I've had in the city, which unfortunately doesn't say much."
"This place is so amazing that I'm giving it five stars and I don't even eat meat.  How is this possible?  Excellent mac n' cheese and fries, all dipped in excellent BBQ sauce.  It's that easy folks."
"I made a special trip for BBQ on a rainySunday.  I heard alot about Smoque and it lived up to the hype.We had a a full rack of ribs, the pulled pork sandwich and the chopped brisket sandwich.  Everything was delicious.  My kids picked the ribs to the bone and my wife and i swapped sandwiches.  The side dishes were good too.  Everyone commented how tasy the fries were and the kids could not get enough of the peach cobbler."
"This past Saturday, my husband and myself had the priviledged of joining my brother and his wife and my father for a meal at Smoque. I had never heard of it before but was excited to try to down-home cookin'. Upon entering, you will have to order first then you will be seated. We were in a little bit of a line but it went quickly. Our orders were fulfilled within 5 minutes or so which I also thought was nice and speedy, considering the place was pretty much full.I ordered the pulled pork ala carte with a side of the cornbread. I have to say that the pork without any additional sauce would have been just fine but once you add in the sauce, WOW! It was delicious! The pork was moist and the sauce was so flavorful. I also very much enjoyed the cornbread and actually saw some kernels of corn inside which made me appreciate the flavor even more.My husband ordered the same pulled pork but I do believe SOMETHING must be said about how amazing the mac and cheese is. No joke, it's amazing. If we ever venture back to Smoque, I will be ordering that M&C because it has this lovely crumble layer on top like a panko bread crumb and it's so cheesy! I also tried my brother's brisket which was delicious. I did not try the ribs but they looked great, too!Overall, our experience was great, I would definitely recommend this location for a lunch if you're in the area. Only downside would be parking but even when it was busy and snow was everywhere making parking difficult we still found a spot within a few minutes. Great spot for BBQ!"
"OK, Smoque. You sold me.The ribs were delicious, the brisket was so tender and juicy, and the cornbread was perfect.  Even with the long line, the staff made things incredibly efficient and made sure we had a place to sit.  It was raining, so they put umbrellas outside the entrance in case the line stretched outside.  The real kicker was when my plate of ribs came out, they apologized for the half slab turning out a little small.  I hadn't said a word or complained, or even noticed for that matter, but they gave me a whole new half slab for free. I ended up with a whole slab of yummy ribs, and everyone I was with was stunned at the service.Thumbs up, Smoque.  If only you were closer."
Very good bbq.
"My favorite thing about Smoque are those super-adorable-oh-my-gosh-cute tins they use to serve up their sides. I'm not trying to be silly. Really. This is my favorite thing about this place.I am from Kansas City. Roll your eyes if you want; I'll wait. I'm from Kansas City and nothing can unseat from my heart those champions of BBQ (Smokestack, Gates, Oklahoma Joe's). But I'm also a realistic person. I know it's more convenient to drive 20 minutes south instead of 9.5 hours south when I feel like eating BBQ. And my fiancé loves this place so I'm sort of stuck with it.Now, if this was KC, I'd rate this place on meat, beans and sauce. But this is not KC. And by that, of course, I mean the beans aren't great. So instead I'll rate this place on the tins, the meat, and (dammit) the sauce.The brisket is pretty good. By Chicago standards, I think it's pretty famously good. The sliced brisket has a strip of fat through it which weirds me out, but I'm easily weirded out by fat. I will carve a brand new cut of meat out of a steak if it's served with any normal amount of fat on the edges... and I certainly carve the fat out of this brisket. But this probably only reflects poorly on me, and not on Smoque or most other restaurants, for that matter.The sauce is really where I wish this place exceeded itself. The thin and vinegary sauce is ok, but it's not great or grand. I had high hopes for the thicker sauce but it tastes like BBQ ketchup. And so I suffer, destroyed by my unfulfilled BBQ-cravings. It's good on french fries, though. I'll give 'em that. But it's in Chicago, you know. It's in Chicago and it's alright. Plus the service is friendly and I'm into that. It gets four stars because of these two considerations."
"This is my go to spot when it comes to BBQ. as good as you're going to get in terms of BBQ with balance. Balance. Not BBQ that's drenched in BBQ sauce to hide the lack of quality in the meat. If that's your type of BBQ then this place is not for you and I'm sorry. Balanced BBQ, low and slow, which is the rub, spice, smoke, the quality of meat, and the sauce. Everything in their menu here is exceptional to damn near perfection. Pulled pork, awesome. Ribs, full of flavor and fresh fall of the bone. Chicken is great as well. Texas Sausage had a nice little kick. Their sides all deliver as well, especially their brisket chili, bbq beans, fresh cut fries, and the cole slaw. But the brisket is the best in the city and from what I hear, better than some areas in Texas. How is that possible? Lol just make you're next trip to Smoque if you're craving BBQ. Not a true restaurant though, it's a order and pickup your food on a tray and sit down.  But it's worth it if you're a restaurant-savvy type of eater. The staff is friendly and will help you find a seat for you and your party.  Cafeteria style seating(patio is more restaurant style seating), fountain soft drinks with free refills, bottle drinks and BYOB. Enjoy!"
"Smoque has a well deserved reputation of being one of the best BBQ in the Chicago area. In my family, we ordered the shredded pork sandwich, brisket, and st. louis ribs.  All were excellent.  The shredded pork is meaty, the brisket is tender we cut ours with a fork, and the ribs fall off the bone.  It's clear the restaurant slow cooks the meat for hours.Sauce is the right combination of a brown sugar or molasses and the accompanying sweetness and a bit of vinegar for a kick.  Those combined with the meaty taste of our meals was a true threesome of taste.Sides were good, not excellent but still good. I liked the baked beans not being drowned in a sweet flavor typical of other 'cue joints.  Smoque nails the taste.  One star is deducted for the somewhat chaotic seating arrangements.  Once you give your order you wait for an open table where the staff will seat you.  Except there's no place really to stand so you end up standing amongst the people dining and getting their fountain drinks."
"I've been waiting to try this place for a LONG time. I live all but one block away from the lake so going out west as far as Pulaski is a rarity, but hell for Smoque I am more than willing to make the trek out that way more often. When it comes to BBQ I have my own personal particular preferences for various elements to what I consider to be ""Perfect""I'm talking about factors such as:- Spice/Seasoning: Give great flavor without ruining the integrity of the product- Texture: Tender doesn't always equate to mushy meat. Have it be soft but retain some level of bite that ensures you that you are indeed eating real meat. - Sauce: Sweet and tangy with a little heat. Balance, viscosity, color - all are important. - Sides: Costars to the meat that need to be able to standalone. At Smoque...- the meats taste great. not overtly smoked but just the right amount that makes you remember that smokiness exists for good reason.- the texture is superb. nice and succulent expertly prepared meats IMO.- The sauces I got were so tasty (different sauces for different meats) not too sticky nor runny. I got nice sweet caramely notes along with nice peaks of acidity that brought things together to meet the heat.- the sides here are great! I absolutely love the slaw here. Not mayo based which goes against my normal mantra of picnic style salads (mayo ally) but I really appreciated the vinaigrette. The french fries are pretty damn good and mac & cheese is super tasty."
"Smoque was solid.  It didn't knock my socks off the way the reviews and line to get in suggest, but it was definitely solid and I'd go again.  You do wait a while in line, but once you get in it's counter service, so you're eating right away.  It's BYOB, so if you drink a few while you're waiting in line, it's just like a normal restaurant, except you have to stand up until the point when your food comes.  Go on a nice day though, cause a chunk of the line is outside.My bf and I split the pulled pork and brisket platters, of which the brisket was way better.  To me, the sides were the superstars.  Baked mac n cheese with perfect consistency, amazing baked beans, and a fabulous special side of the day - brisket chili.  You get 2 sides with platters, but you can add more for not too much, so I'd load up!Also, prices were down right awesome.  We payed $22 for two platters, with 2 sides each, plus an extra side of cornbread."
"Sure, I'm the 915th person to (most likely) extol her praises of Smoque on Yelp, but by golly, I want to share. Mostly because...HOLY MAC AND CHEESE, YOU ARE THE TASTIEST MAC N CHEESE I HAVE EVER TASTED THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.Seriously, this is my favorite mac and cheese around. While I like the barbecue here, I love this side and could devour it all day every day. Fortunately, I am a (slightly) responsible adult and don't gorge myself on their cheesy goods.Also worth mentioning was that two older dudes sat next to my boyfriend and I while we were here with three bottles of wine and proceeded to drink their meal with a side of barbecue. Long live BYOB and cafeteria style seating!!!"
"It took me two years to get to Kuma's, and then another two to get to Smoque.  My holy trinity of north side gluttony isn't complete, though; I still haven't been to Hot Doug's.  Slowly but surely, folks.  We came here the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  Most of Chicago was still dealing with leftovers and heartburn, and this allowed us to place and receive our orders within about fifteen minutes of entering.  I think the Thanksgiving leftover crowd ran out of gravy soon after our arrival, though, because the line was to the door from the time we sat down to when we left.  I went with the half and half, as I didn't want either the pulled pork or the brisket to feel bad about being left out.  And since I still don't want either the fallen pig or cow to feel slighted, I'll say that they were equally good.  Sides: the fresh cut fries are excellent, although it would be quite the disappoint to ever get a bad order of fresh cut fries (was there ever a food name with such built-in deliciousness?).  They didn't skimp on them either, and that's appreciated.  Some of the other sides my friends and I sampled were small but intensely flavorful.  I'd never had baked beans that needed to be savored quite like that.  Room for improvement?  The meat was cooked to perfection, but the sauce wasn't very memorable.  And like countless other bbq places, Smoque would do well to put some more effort into their bread/buns.  Some average bread won't spoil the meat here, but the right kind will make it divine.  Cooper's is a good example of a place that has embraced this concept.  Both the guys working out the seating arrangements and the folks at the counter were very polite and cordial, and this was a pleasant surprise.  You would not expect this at a place that has a line from open to close every day.  You folks at the DMV (who no doubt read Yelp religiously) could learn something.  We were witnesses to a funny thing while eating.  The gentleman I took for the owner and one of his employees were having a conversation near the exit on the side.  As the line pushed toward the door, a well-heeled looking older lady seemed annoyed that they weren't following the line towards the cash registers.  ""Excuse me, are you in line?""  Come on, lady.  You may not know that he runs the place, but he's wearing a white coat and checkered pants; he clearly works here.  But surely it's plausible that if he were employed elsewhere he'd cheat on his own kitchen for some Smoque."
"Tried Smoque BBQ while on vacation in Chicago. This is honestly some of the best BBQ I have had. It makes me sad that in Los Angeles we lack good BBQ. The staff was attentive and helpful. They are more than happy to find you a seat once you place your order. They also bring the food to your table and cleanup once you are done. The food was amazing! I was able to try the Sliced Brisket Sandwich (yelp.com/biz_photos/LPwA…) with some Mac n Cheese. The brisket was super juicy and tender. Literally melts in your mouth. We also ordered a platter (yelp.com/biz_photos/LPwA…) with Chicken, Ribs, and Links. All the meats were perfectly smokey, with a great bark on the outside. The sides were also delicious, but obviously the meat is what people come for. It was definitely worth the drive outside the city!"
"i dare say that these are the best ribs in chicago and worth the drive. the sides (yams, mac 'n cheese and greens) are just as good!"
"Just came here last night for the first time. Overall, the experience was fantastic. I'll mix it up and start with my complaints first. I only had two small issues with this place. First, the ordering/seating was a little disorganized, especially since it was pretty busy. It ended up working out fine, and we got our food quickly, but it was just a little disorganized and confusing. Second, we got a ""taster portion"" of the ST. Louis ribs. They weren't the best I've ever had (*cough* they were no Twin Anchors *cough*.) They were a little tough--definitely not ""fall off the bone"" tender that I like. Now the positives: my husband and I each ordered the brisket plate. We were in agreement that it was the best brisket we ever had. The sides were also very solid: we got beans, mac and cheese and cornbread. I thought the beans were the standout (I pretty much drank the extra sauce in the cup at the end) and my husband thought the mac and cheese was the best. All of the sauces were fabulous as well: we stuck with the Carolina and the ""Spicy"" Memphis. Bottom line, I'll definitely be back here. This is the best BBQ (overall) I've had in Chicago."
"Some of the best smoked meat I have ever tried! The brisket literally melts in your mouth. Though it can get very crowded, time your meal during off-peak hours and you'll enjoy a much more peaceful meal."
Above average. Not great
"Brisket and pulled pork were good, but not amazing by any means.  The Mac and cheese was lumpy and flavorless, a big disappointment.  The sauce tasted like burnt, watered down tomato paste, definitely forgettable.  To top it all off, the cash register or POS system broke, once we placed our order they told us that we had to come back and get in line to pay after we finished our meal, totally inefficient."
"I am a Texan, born and raised then transplanted to Chicago.This is some good ol' Smoque BBQ with some great Southern Sides.  Now I think of myself as a bit of a connoisseur of BBQ.  Let me tell you about my tasting Resume: Salt Lick, City Market, Black's and Rudy's to name a few.  This place is great and I will add it to my favorite BBQ joints in Chicago....oh wait!?  This is the only place so far in Chicago to make me review, desire more of, and want to tell friends about!Yup, good ol' fashion Smoque BBQ!  Try the brisket and the Turkey and check out the smoke rings!"
"Soooo gooood! Everything was delicious. Really no complaints at all. The BBQ sauces were the best that I've ever had. I was so surprised by the differences between them. The one for my chicken was tangy and a little spicy, whereas the sauce for the pulled pork was citrusy but not too sweet. Fries, amazing. Even the slaw was great, and I usually hate cole slaw. It was light and again had a bit of citrus in it. Great place and amazing value. Truth be told I was a little wary when I saw that the bleached blonde gnome from the food network and chili's/Fridays had higlighted it. But, as I've written, a terrific restaurant."
Amazing by all means !!! Every thing i tried was excellent
"The brisket is the best here!  Ribs are not bad.  All their sides I love.  And it's byob too!  Sometimes it's crazy busy, but well worth the wait.  Gone back number of times already."
"Theres a reason why this place is so highly reviewed!  The price is right, the food is great, plus its BYOB!  I can go into detail but I wont...JUST GO!"
"Absolutely the best smoked brisket I've ever had anywhere in the country! It's so tender it can be cut with a fork, and it's wonderfully flavorful.  So smoky!!!  The rub they use is also fantastic.  Then when you add the vinegar based bbq sauce, it's a combination of flavor made in heaven.The mac and cheese is also to die for.  They start with creamy mac & cheese in a small tin cup. Then they sprinkle on top bread crumbs, white cheese and yellow cheese, and run it through a broiler.  Wonderfully delicious. The pulled pork is also superior.  I also order the dinner plate with half pulled pork and half sliced brisket.There is often a line, but it moves fast and is so worth the wait!!!"
"This place has been on my bucket list ever since I saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and recently I finally had the pleasure to dominate their BBQ. If you are looking for ri-donk-ulous BBQ then you need to get your Smoque on! I came here with some fellow Q lovers and got the pulled pork platter with a side of fries. I knew I was in for a treat when they served me my platter of pulled pig on a cafeteria tray and then, before they handed me this dish, they dumped a full ladle of thick BBQ sauce on my entire dish. (If you are drooling on your computer right now....I totally understand)The meal was flat out authentic BBQ. Each bite had a mixture of perfectly cooked oink oink, smoke flavor, and tangy BBQ sauce. I also tried the beef brisket and grilled chicken breast and they were equally as good, but I still think the pulled pork was tops. Drink a lil drink, Smoque a lil Smoque. Boom!"
"The meat was excellent but I guess Texas style just isn't my favorite. I like the style of bbq traditionally considered subpar in which both the sauce and meat are integrated; here, they give you little buckets of sauce for dipping, pouring, whatever, and it's fine, but could be better. I also wish the menu offered more combination options, although it IS nice that you can order a ""taste"" of various meats for ~$3 (and they're pretty generous tastes).But really, overall it's very good. The baby back ribs were a little small, which was fine, and nicely cooked. The pulled pork and sliced brisket had excellent flavors, and the smokiness was balanced without being overwhelming. Parts of the brisket were really fatty, but it was a normal, not weird/gristly, fat. The texas sausage was my least favorite meat, although it wasn't bad. The chili with brisket was tasty but plain, and the macaroni and cheese was probably the best thing I had, and I'm not sure if that is a good or bad sign. Anyway, it's very good, the employees are great and keep the place moving, and we didn't have a wait a little after noon on a sunday but it was filling up as we were there."
"For a place that's received so much hype, all I can really say is, ""Meh, it's okay, but I've definitely had better.""First thing's first: I'm a born and bred brisket girl--I love brisket in all of its forms, especially the BBQ variety--so when I learned that Smoque offered brisket, I was all over that sh*t.But when I took a bite of my long-awaited brisket, my BBQ dreams deflated a bit. Though the meat was incredibly juicy, I found the brisket to be lacking in spice, even with the sauce on top. It tasted a lot like the kind of brisket you would have with your Passover meal (not a bad thing, but I was expecting more spice).I moved onto the mac and cheese thinking that would be better. It was good, but also underwhelming (I can make the same exact thing at home). Same thing with the peach cobbler. Also good, but still a little eh.The Texas sausage and the ribs, on the other hand, were pretty tasty. Just enough spice, but you can definitely find better Q in other less out of the way places in Chicago."
"Headed to the airport? Make a stop at Smoque - skip crappy airport food and prices. You will be full until you reach your destination! We usually get the baby back ribs - the only way to go. Excellent pulled pork as well. We always get 2 mac n cheeses (they are so tiny :*( ) and fries. I love the non-mayo-y coleslaw. The ambiance can be weird. With the line of people waiting in the main walkway and all the tables smashed up against each other. However, it's still great because it's very no non-sense."
"I had been wanting to visit Smoque BBQ for some time now, and finally did.To say this place was built up more in mind than in realty is an undertstatement.The aroma of BBQ could be smelled for a block away and I was giddy with anticipation.Although small in size the restaurant is nice enough in usual decor. I however was placing a to go order so, no big deal.I ordered a half slab of St. Louis ribs, fries, and mac & cheese. Slaw came with.Also ordered a sliced beef brisket sandwich with a side of beans. Slaw came with.First the ribs: while cooked nicely with a good char crust I thought the hickory smoke flavoring very overpowering and distracting. The smoke flavor should enhance the meat, not take it over. The fries were great and plentiful with a dusting of a spice powder which gave them some good flavor. The mac & cheese was only fair. The whole thing was dry with not much flavor and the crumb topping made a mess on the table. The slaw was fresh with a light dressing, however, the red onion was way too strong. The entire bowl smelled and tasted like onion. Finally the extra sauce that came with. For a place that concentrates on BBQ, this sauce is not good at all.It's thin and with a tang of vinegar and spices but, there's most definitely something else in there that made it have an ""off taste"". Can't quite figure out what that is but it does take away from the overall flavor.The sliced brisket sandwich was good, not great, not bad, just good. The portion size of beef was very small considering what the sandwich cost. I was expecting a pile of meat but the two halfs of the bun were touching each other. Meaning not much meat was between the bread. The beans really were not that great, kind of watery with an addition of the bbq sauce which again made for an off flavor. So all in all Smoque was good for a quick BBQ fix, but I would not go out of my way to visit again."
"The day after I get back from Atlanta and my friend wants to get BBQ for dinner. I agreed. Ugh. I'm so fat. MUST ORDER:- sliced brisket: So tender it melts in your mouth- mac n cheese: Cheesey goodness with a bread crust!- peach cobbler: Best cobbler I've ever had. Next time I will take these to go and eat it with ice cream at homeRibs were decent, pulled pork was decent, and the chicken was decent. So pretty much whatever you order it will be good. BYOB. But if you're sitting outside I don't think that applies because there was a sign at the patio stating no alcohol."
"This is what I love about Smoque... the trays.  I know, weird, but I think they're super cute and isn't that what's really important when it comes to BBQ?  Okay, I know it's not, but I was more impressed with the tray than with what was on it.  Everybody raves about Smoque and my sister has been on a barbecue kick so when she was in for a visit we decided to go give it a try.  We knew we'd have to wait in line, we knew it was cold out... we were prepared, except for the guy behind us who didn't understand the concept of personal space and grilled us about all of our favorite barbecue places in the city.  He was visiting from out of state but he'd been to all the big names in Chicago BBQ.  Maybe it was all the talking about Fat Willy's and Smoke Daddy that ultimately led to my mild disappointment.  We ordered a couple different things to share so that we could get a good feel of the place.  Ribs, brisket, and a pulled pork sandwich.  They were out of peach cobbler (Which is maybe my second favorite thing on Earth) so I was a little miffed.  I thought the ribs were pretty good (better at Smoke Daddy) and the brisket was pretty good (better at Fat Willy's) and I didn't have room for the pulled pork (although the bf said he liked it.) so I don't know how that faired.  The cornbread was dry, the mac and cheese was alright, the baked beans were tasty, the fries were awesome.  I found the place friendly and nice, but nothing was so good that I feel compelled to go back.  I do want to try the cobbler though; I just don't know if I want to stand in line for 40 minutes to try it (or worse, find out they're out again.)."
"Went here last summer after doing some research on a good BBQ joint to hit up while in town. We took a cab here from downtown to the tune of $20, dumb idea. Cabby looked at me like I was crazy when we got picked up downtown and said where we wanted to go. Take the Blue Line, it stops nearby and is way cheaper.My girlfriend and I waited in the long line for about 20 minutes. Too bad we didn't know you can bring in beer and just drink while in line or I'd have hit up a party store.She got the brisket, I got one of the varieties of ribs. A co-owner was there and overheard me mentioning we were out-of-towners. He hooked me up with some free pulled pork and the other variety of ribs I did not order. 5 stars already!The brisket was Godlike. I've never had better brisket. And my girlfriend doesn't care for BBQ. She devoured it with a smile on her face that I'll probably never see again unless we return. Both styles of ribs were amazing, very flavorful. A lot of people mess up ribs by making them taste like 90% smoke and 10% meat. These were perfect. Can't remember which type was fattier (St. Louis maybe?) but I preferred the less fat ribs.Pulled pork was pretty damn tasty too. Don't recall too much about its flavor but I know it was good.All the sides were amazing. Cole slaw and cornbread stand out as two of the better options.Worth the trip from downtown if you're in the mood for some memorable BBQ. How much I can recall from a visit 14 months ago should tell you it's quality stuff."
"Ok, this place gets a lot of hype (at least from people I know) but I'm giving it the four stars it deserves even though I felt a little let down because I was expecting to have a food-gasm.  Don't let people trick you into thinking this place is life-changing, do'nt get me wrong it's really good, but you know...Everything is very good. I was lucky enough to go with people who all ordered different things and I tasted most of the meat offerings. Those offerings however, are kind of limited. I know it's a BBQ place and they do what they do and they do it well and it's their thing and that's all, but still the menu is small. That said, the sauce is really good enough that they could serve only that, alone and I think I would still come here from time to time. The sides were good, although I like a gooier, rather than creamier mac and cheese, theirs is very creamy. The price is about right, the portions are excellent and it's BYOB so that's awesome."
"I have been there a few times.  It is always good. Not great.  The last time we went there it was crowded as always.  I don't mind waiting.  The brisket was okay. Good smoke ring.  I don't eat Mac & Cheese.  I wanted another roll.  ""98 cents"" is what the server told me. Was very happy to take my money. He was not too happy to give me my damn roll. I stood there over 5 minutes. The same guy came over to ask me WHAT I WANTED?  I said are they milling the wheat or something. I had to show the same guy my reciept before he gave me a roll.  Good food not worth the hassle."
id go back again and again
"The pulled pork sandwich is the best I've ever had. I rarely eat meat, so when I do it better be worth it! The pork is juicy and tender and the bbq sauce is sweet but comes with a kick. The portions are generous. Just a sandwich is a meal in itself. My boyfriend had the brisket sandwich and agreed that the meat was tender and flavorful.  I also got a side of cornbread, which was made with whole corn kernels mixed in. It was delicious! I would definitely recommend going for an early dinner or lunch and sitting outside. This place gets packed on the weekends!"
"Love going here for a casual meal that delicious. The ribs and pulled pork is delicious, and their sides are great.  My boyfriend craves their mac & cheese (he's from Wisconsin and claims to be a connisseur of this dish) and always orders two when we go. I love their salad, peach cobbler, baked beans."
"If I lived in Chicago, I would probably be a regular.  However, after having bbq in KC, STL, NC, Memphis, and Texas, this just doesn't match up.  The sausage was ok, but bland.  The coleslaw was dry and bland.  The baked beans were not memorable.  The peach cobbler seemed like canned peaches with toasted granola on top.  The bbq sauce was average. The best food I had was the chopped brisket, but even that was just average.  I realllllllly wanted to love this place, but I wasn't blown away like everyone else.  Also, it's very confusing when you kind of have a server.  You order at a counter, but a person finds a table for you and ""assists"" you at your table.  Another person brings out your food.  Either have servers or don't...don't have various people hovering over you and interrupting your meal trying to guess what you need."
"I don't know what took me so long to check this place out!It's a cute little spot where you order you stuff and pick it up at the counter. I like that they have a hostess to help you find seating because that can be a little daunting and this creates organization and who doesn't love organization?So let's get to the good stuff--the food! The BBQ here is amazing. Ribs that fall of the bone without that ""boiled"" taste. You can tell that they cook it low and slow. The BBQ chicken is the moistest I've had and and the skin is so crispy. The best part is that when you cut into the chicken all the juices come gushing out so you just know that it won't be dry! The brisket here is the best I've had in the city. Nice and juicy..smokey without being too smokey.The slaw here is the sh*&! I like that it's not a heavy mayo version and that they don't throw all kinds of crap into it. The fries here are heavenly...nice and crispy! Their mac n' cheese is tops. I would say their corn bread and bbq beans are ok but nothing spectacular.Their sauce is right in between that thick sweet sauce and the vinegary-type bbq sauces.Can't wait to go back...this place will totally give you the itis b/c you won't want to stop eating!"
"Visited Saturday night for the first time.Here's what you should know...-Parking can be complicated.  Just be careful your first time, then grab a menu with a parking grid for future use.  It details places to park anytime, places to never park, and places to sometimes park.-It was crazy chaotic, line out the door at 530pm on Saturday night.  Having said that, there was a clear process.  Line up, place your order, and the floating host will seat you as your order comes due.  Takes a bit of trust - but it worked and reminded me of how Hot Doug's works.-Food was awesome.  Loved the chopped brisket (little drier than sliced, but no giant pieces of fat) and the pulled pork.  Cornbread was the best I have had since moving here from the Carolinas.  Mac and Cheese was great - rich, and has a bread crumb and cheddar topping.  Beans were okay - too much onion for our taste.  And were mayo base slaw fans - so hated the slaw.  fries were huge and hot, and seasoned great.-  Everyone was super friendly.  The host, cashier, person who plated our food, to the busboys.  All very nice.-If you cant choose between meats, ask for a platter with half and half.  Its not on the menu but we both had two meats instead of 1."
"One of the better places for bbq in Chicago. I love the sliced brisket here. It's always juicy and soft and can be eaten with or without the sauce. I've heard other people say that sometimes it can be dry but I've never had that experience whenever I order it. To me the pull pork is a bit dry but it's alright if you eat it with the sauce that comes with it. The St. Louis ribs are great as well. It has an excellent smoky flavor to it and like the brisket it can be eaten with or without the bbq sauce.The sides are good as well. Homestyle fries and the mac and cheese are my favs but the portion for some of the sides can be small. They come in these cupcake size aluminum containers where they're individually cooked.As for the place itself, it can get crowded. But the staff there help you find a table while you wait in line to order. They do have their own parking lot and there's street parking but there's not a lot of spots I recommend carpooling if you can. All in all one of my favorite places to eat."
"Best BBQ I've had in Chicago. I'm typically not a fan of tangy BBQ sauce but the glazing on the ribs complimented the sauce to perfection. Both the ribs and half chicken were as succulent as it gets. The beans and brisket chili were average but the cornbread was delicious and not dry like typical cornbread. Lastly, the fries were bountiful and comparable to five guys fries which I am quite a fan of. Anyone look for a top notch bbq BYOB should check out Smoque."
I always drive past this place and see a huge line out the door. So I decided to try this place out being that i love bbq ribs. I ordered ribs and was not impressed. The ribs were very dry and didnt have much flavor to them. There was no room to sit and enjoy your meal. Glad this place is out of my bucket list.
"Saddened, disappointed, but still going to go back for another try.  My chicken was VERY PINK inside, which made my godmother shy away from eating it.  When I called the restaurant to complain, they assured me that it was smoked for 2 hours, low and slow, and that it was customary for it to have that pink hue....The manager apologized and said that he would reimburse me for the chicken, but that transaction it yet to be completed and it's well over 2 monthsThe brisket was pretty good, although it needed some of the sauce for it to have nice flavoring.  I don't really see it standing alone.  The mac and cheese was GA-REAT.  Great texture, great flavor, well seasoned, good cheese to pasta ratio.  I'd give it another shot because an Elite high in my book, J.P, gave some recommendations that said would knock my socks off.  Pretty good in house service, so maybe two's a charm."
"Smoque confuses me. Sometimes it's good, other times not so much. The people are friendly and it is hard to find good St. Louis ribs elsewhere. But oftentimes the sides are the highlight of the meal and even they're not all that great. Don't get me wrong, this place isn't bad. It's just not as good as some make it out to be. It gets crowded in there, parking is hard to come by, and they put everything in these little foam containers, which shouldn't be a huge deal but it just makes the product look cheap. I've had better and worse. Stop in. You might love it. Or you might not."
"After seeing the place on TV, I had to make a visit to see if it was as good as they said on TV.  We got there just before lunch, so there was no line to speak of.  After flying up from Texas I had to get the brisket, right?  I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of the meat, it was really good, as good or better than a lot of the hole-in-the-wall places here in Texas.  The beef was tender and had a good smoke flavor.I was worth the trip to the North side for a true Texas style BBQ brisket.  I was not disappointed at all and will make the trip back to ""Smoque"" again. Next time I'll have to try the ribs!"
"First off I guess I should say that I'm not from Kansas or Memphis or one of the true BBQ capitals of the world. But I have set my heart on finding the best BBQ that I can on frequent trips to the US.Smoque's location should really put a tourist off, but after a trek out - it's a really long walk from Wrigley!!!, I found the best BBQ joint I've experienced so far. The babyback ribs were fantastic, the sides amazing - and who knew mac and cheese could be so good.I'd also have to say that the owners on both visits we made (we took the L the second time!) were incredibly friendly and chatted at length about theiir passion for the restaurant. They also ran back and got us some brisket to try, which merits the many great reviews on here.Really worth the trip out for great BBQ and superb service. I certainly know that it'll be first on my list when I head back to Chicago in May! Counting the days down already!!!"
This is my favorite restaurant in the world!!!  I would not recommend the ribs... go for the brisket.  I don't normally like coleslaw but their's is AMAZING... no mayo :)  The reast of the sides are great as well.  If you like BBQ... GO HERE!!!
Absolutely-hands down the best BBQ Ive had in the city of Chicago. Words can't explain how I feel about the BBQ at this spot. All I can say is if your a real BBQ fan then you should take the time out of your day one day this week and get your butt up to Smoque.We tried the 1/2 Chicken and 1/2 Slab of Ribs. Both were incredible. All of the side dishes were amazing. I can wait to go back.
"In my opinion this is the best BBQ in the city. There are other good bbq places in Chicago but none are in the same league as Smoque.I could write reviews of everything but no use in boring you, just try everything, it is hard to go wrong. My favorite though has to be the St. Louis Ribs. The rub is so good you do not need any BBQ sauce at all.Don't be discouraged by the line at the door, it will move fast and by the time you are eating you won't even remember waiting in line."
This place is amazing. Whenever my wife and I feel like BBQ we come to Smoque. This is the kind of place that after you eat here you compare all other BBQ place you so to with Smoque!
"There is one major thing I did not like about Smoque and it was the sauce.  I am not a BBQ aficionado but typically like more of a sweet brown sugar, thick and tangy type sauce.  The sauce at Smoque is pretty thin and tastes a lot like vinegar  - just a little too much for me.   In fact, at the end of my meal I had to eat my brisket without sauce. Well then, why the 4 stars ... because everything else here is top notch.  The dry rub and meats were all very tasty and extremely tender.   My husband and I got a bunch of sides to share and everything was fresh and had good flavors.Again, not being a BBQ expert, I felt the prices were good.  There was a bit of a wait when we went but it was quick.  I really liked how the quasi host found a table for us after we ordered.  I felt like we didn't have to stand and hover over a table until they finished their meal."
"The location seems kind of random, but the haul west is worth it. They have a smooth operation getting people in and out without feeling rushed. Food comes out quickly, super hot, and so delicious.The pulled pork is awesome and the mac and cheese is one of the best around. Great food at a pretty good price. You'll leave satisfied for sure."
"The best straight up BBQ in the city, with a decent edge over Smoke Daddy's. We get Smoque catered at work once a month, and I've been to the actual establishment twice. The mac and cheese is the best...ever...anywhere. Man do I wish it was good for me. The BBQ beans and the cornbread are both excellent as well.The ribs are second to none. I prefer the smokier St. Louis ribs to the more traditional Baby Back, but to each his or her own. Why argue when you can just do half a slab of each anyways? The brisket, pulled pork, and chicken are all awesome too with the chicken being a real standout to me. Usually chicken at a BBQ place is either super dry or mad greasy. Smoque's is just moist and flavorful. I don't remember the names of the sauces, but there are two main ones which really go well with the meat they are intended for.The restaurant itself is what it should be: a stripped down little joint with plastic benches, a counter to order at, and no frills. The service is very friendly and more than happy to help you make a decision.Oh, and the peach cobbler kicks ass too. I don't even really like peach cobbler. Or do I?"
Never a bad meal...best brisket I've ever eaten.  There really is no need to read any more reviews - just get your BBQ-loving arse in the joint.
"So good!  The ribs, pulled pork and brisket was delish!  The sauce was tangy and tasty.  Loved the mac and cheese!  It was different than others I've had.Although the line was long, the servie went fairly quickly.  It was hard to figure out where to order or who was waiting in line.  But I think the chaos works for them.  We will be back!"
"Good food. A little packed in tight but the food is worth the piled up feeling.  Good mac/cheese, and bbq flavor on the meat! Loved it! Will go back soon!"
"As soon as we stepped in out of the rain, we were in line. Yes, that busy, but seemed to move at a fair pace. They do have people that will seat you. We had a group of 9 and thought it would be out of the question, but sure enough, they had a table for us. Food was enjoyed by all. I could not decide so I had the 1/2 and 1/2. Half chopped brisket and half pulled pork. Best of both worlds. No choice on sauce but liked the house sauce so no foul there. The mac and cheese was decent but was too small of portion. Would not get again, only because of size. Cole slaw was tasty enough. Not usually a fan, but ate my sons as well. Would definitely recommend, but would take out if you can."
"Sooooooo yummy.  I've been here 4 times with friends and we all love it.  It's byob.  Tender delicious meat, perfect peach cobbler.   Don't go on a friday/sat night or you'll wait in a long line."
"As a recent transplant from Texas, BBQ is second nature, and there's plenty of places to find some good ol' Southern BBQ.  However, when I set out to find a good BBQ joint in the Chicago it was more of a challenge.  Most of the recommendations lead me to Smoque BBQ but expect to wait in a long line, I was told, because it's a popular place.  I grab some friends one Saturday afternoon and headed there. The line wasn't as long as expected and the smell was very inviting. After several minutes of being in line, we placed our order, and then were sat down in their main dining (or outside patio).  They call your number to come get your order when it's ready.  We were not disappointed at all. The staff was friendly, the environment cheerful, and the menu reasonable. Of course...the BBQ would compete very well against some Texas BBQ joints.  You can order off the menu to dine-in or do yours to-go. The patio is very enjoyable and within walking distance there's a childern's playground if you're looking to entertain or tire out the little ones after lunch."
"Ok I do know how this place gets such great reviews.  I've been in the food business my whole life and this place skimps on quality all the way.  One thing I learned after 30 years in the food business, if you put food in a nice package and market correctly people will convince themselves that a pile of crap tastes like sugar, I'm not saying Smoque is a pile of crap it's just decent mediocre food that obviously fooled a lot of people.  The BBQ sauce and seasonings are above average but it needs to be in order to cover up the taste of the meats they use."
You'll only get better ribs in Tennesee.
"As a Texan, I can honestly say, Smoque has the best BBQ in the Chicago area. "" Nuff said"" enjoy."
Best BBQ in Chicago. Yum!
"Great place for barbecue!! Excellent ribs, and pulled pork sandwiches!! There cole slaw is so amazing!!"
"Wow. What can I say bad about Smoque. Probably nothing. Well, the location and parking sort of sucks, but worth the travel.Every time I go to Smoque I get the same thing - Chopped brisket sandwich, side of mac and cheese, and slaw. I have had their ribs, cornbread, brisket chili, and texas sausage in the past, and all were good.If you get the full brisket sandwich, you can get a combo of chopped and sliced. I am sure sliced is wonderful, but I have yet to try it. The meat has such a good BBQ bark that is fantastic. The mac and cheese is individually baked so you get a wonderful crust on top. However, eat this while hot. The deliciousness is directly correlated with the hotness factor. The slaw is great too - mixed with a vinaigrette rather than mayo. Nice tough Smoque.  You might have to wait to get a table, but it is worth it. Great food, great service, and good price for BBQ. Try the brisket chili if you get a chance - you will love it. They are very good about giving samples if you ask!Fries look to greasy for my taste, but I hear they are good ..."
"Liked it. Not sure I loved it.The pulled pork was incredibly disappointing. All I heard before coming here was that it was to die for. When I ate it, it was incredibly bland. I did go on a Friday night at their peak and will chalk it up under a bad batch. I'll give it another chance when more care can be put into the food.The brisket was incredibly juicy. The St. Louis ribs were very smokey without losing a freshness or soft texture. The Texas sausage was mediocre.The place was packed and the line out the door was intimidating, as they don't take reservations, but the line moved fast and my girlfriend and I were seated almost immediately after ordering (you order & pay before sitting).The food was three-star food, to be honest, but their BBQ sauce elevates everything to mouth-watering levels; the service was incredibly attentive and helpful; there's free parking; it's BYOB, the price is more than right, and you're not rushed out; and, again, the BBQ sauce is amazing!I really think this place is five stars at the right time. Friday at 7:45 p.m. really isn't that time."
"Very good bbq for chicago, but did NOT meet expectations. Line out the door and everyone says best bbq in chicago. If so, i give up on finding great chicago bbq. Its definetly good, but not incredible. (2000th review)!"
"Really delicious BBQ.  Small dive-y joint a little far outside of the city, but worth the trip and the wait.  We brought my suburban dad here who was initially skeptical about the BYOB factor and having to wait in a line that wrapped outside the building (and on a weeknight, no less) but even he seemed more than satisfied to finally sit down and eat good BBQ while drinking the beer of his choice.  Between the 4 of us we tried a little bit of everything and everyone left full and nobody left disappointed."
great food. mac&cheese is great.
"overated. It really is. For what  you're spending at Smoque, you could have a fantastic meal at a restaurant in the city that has a quiet, comfortable atmosphere. Call me crazy but I really don't enjoy spending $40-$50 on a meal for two people just to be crammed between loud talkers at dirty picnic tables. It's just not my thing. When I want to sit at a picnic table, I go camping. The three stars are for the delicious pulled pork. It's fantastic. However, the sides leave something to be desired. They are expensive and the size of a cereal bowl from which The Littles would eat."
"What more can be said about this place?Don't let the website fool you.  This is somewhere between BBQ pit and hole-in-the-wall.  In the best possible way.  Everything we had was great - my favorite was the brisket but the pulled pork, ribs and chicken were all perfectly cooked, heavily seasoned, and most definitely fork-tender.  The mac & cheese was deliciously cheesy and fired on top and served in an adorable little foil ramekin.  And the best of all - the sauce!  The vinegar BBQ sauce has a heavy dose of smoky, sweet and sour, in just the right proportions.If you walk into a place and most of the customers are significantly overweight and wearing smiles on their faces, you know the place is either gluttonously unhealthy, absurdly delicious, or both.  Smoque is probably not particularly good for you... but it can stand up to any BBQ in the city."
"Being raised in farm country, the son of a hog farmer, working at a hog processing plant... I KNOW my pork dear readers. So believe me when I say that this was some of the BEST pork ribs and brisket I have EVER eaten.The staff was friendly and effiecient despite how crazy and busy the place is. And despite understandably long line of people waiting to get their hands on some damn fine food, the staff keeps things moving very well.The ambiance is a bit lacking, the noise level is a bit high, and there isn't a whole lot of room. BUT what it does have is some of the best BBQ that there is! And it is also BYOB and don't charge a corking fee, so bring some beer or wine of your own to enjoy with your meal!I had the chopped Brisket sandwich (which comes on sweet Hawaiin roll buns!), with cornbread, fries, and a taste portion of their ribs. EVERYTHING was fantastic and some of the best I've ever had.The menu is a bit spartan, but what they do have they do VERY well and frankly I love seeing a place that does a few things perfectly than try to serve many mediocre dishes. If you love BBQ pork and chicken you will love this place.I will definitly be coming back here as many times as I can!"
"Absolutely over rated. They have their cooking methods perfected, the brisket just feel apart and was extremely tender. What they don't have down is flavor. You could barely taste the rub, the smoke flavor didn't penetrate the meat, and the barbeque sauce was just bland. I went in to this place expecting great things. If this place hadn't had a million reviews on yelp and been all over food shows, I would of came out happy. With that type of hype I was expecting bbq that is hard to find, but they didn't deliver."
"Everything is good here.  This the city's best BBQ restaurant, hands down. My favorite is splitting some ribs and a smoked chicken! Generous portions, not too expensive."
"These guys can cook. Food has excellent taste. Menu and pricing well thought out. Parking, order line, and finding a table ain't bad. But we did go in the late afternoon to avoid rush. Friendly staff."
"I was lucky enough to get here when something went wrong with some of their machinery so they were doing a $8.95 deal for half a slab of baby back ribs and 2 sides. Ribs were perfect and the SIDES were bomb. I ordered the fries(HUGE) and mac & cheese....that was enough to fill me up.. but I kept going. Also, their slaw is awesome. I don't like coleslaw, and this def was an upgrade from the usual. I'll be back!"
"This is a BBQ joint done right. A simple menu, quick counter service, and a delicious product. Yeah, the place is freakin' popular, and yeah, they've shoved in as many tables as possible so that people have enough room to eat. It isn't a huge location, and that is half of what makes it great. I really enjoyed the mayo-less slaw and pulled pork on that sweet (I'm thinking Hawaiian?) bun. I haven't tried the brisket yet, but that is next on the list!  Hooray - BYOB!"
"1st visitThe food here is not all that.  What ""real"" BBQ Joint runs out of ribs at 6:00 at night? Small portions. Not a ""true"" full slab of ribs. Mac and cheese was nuked!Parking absolutely sucks!Not the cleanest looking people working thereGave them the benefit, 2nd visitsame old, same old!Out of ribs at 5:30 2 hours for pick-up! yes, 2 hours!out of certain items at dinner.I think their egos in this place is bigger than their menu.won't be back!"
"Best barbecue on the North side, but wish the sides were larger."
"Best brisket this side of Round Rock, TX. Dry rub ribs are top notch. Chicago will never be a bbq destination like Memphis, NC, or Central Texas but Smoque is the place I'll keep coming back to when I'm jonesin' for BBQ.T"
"OMG - can I say BBQ heaven???!!!  Now I'm no bbq expert, but this is damn good food.  I make the 20 mile car ride once a month to treck out to this little hole in the wall bbq joint.  I've had the sliced brisket,  pulled pork, Texas sausage, BBQ beans, corn bread, peach cobbler, and cole slaw.  I love the sliced the brisket, and their cornbread.  The cornbread is moist, brisket is tender, and their bbq sauce is very tasty.  Pulled pork is delicious, but I prefer the brisket.  The Texas sausage is a very yummy, smokey sausage.  Their cole slaw is vinegar based and no mayo.  Although there usually is a line, the restaurant has a good workflow of how you order, how you get seated and you pick up your food when your number is called.  It's fairly fast and fairly priced good food."
"I don't know why it took me so long to try this place out... you need to look no more for great BBQ! Smoque BBQ is the place. I had the full slab of baby backs with the slaw, fries and beans... awesome! It's exactly what I expected and more. I really appreciated that the BBQ sauce was on the side and not hiding the beautifully cooked ribs...they call it ""low and slow"" here at Smoque BBQ. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The order came with 2 servings of BBQ sauce and I used one with a couple of dashes of hot sauce, the other I left alone to compare... excellent balance of heat and smoke. Smoque BBQ is definitely in the ""going-back-here"" category!"
"I'm Filipino so its an autonomic response to LOVE pork! and this place is a PORK holiday all day every day! I had the sliced brisket sandwich w a side of mac and cheese. It comes w a side of their special bbq sauce, and their mac and cheese has a creme broulee breaded concoction on the surface making the cheese crispy on top but the mac soft in the center w oozing goodness of dairy.I wasn't fairly hungry but as I sank my teeth into my 1st bite and the juices and meat touched the 1000s of taste buds on my tongue I became an animal.  You know when you're starving and you just stuff food in your face non-stop until you feel yourself and your stomach bulge out like a 3month old prego lady? Unfortunately I did that but caught myself 1/2 way so I could enjoy the sandwich more.I do have to go back there and sample everything else they have on the menu.  Its inexpensive, the menu isn't that extensive and the location is perfect; doesn't get too crowded or noisy during rush hour!"
"The St.Louis was just perfect but I love the bbq sauce, it is sweet, tangy, with a little spice.  My favorite was the cornbread, it was moist and came hot. I thought the mac & Cheese was ok."
"My new favorite place for bbq.  Worth the drive, worth the wait, worth the lack of beer :) Had the baby back ribs, and fell in love. Brisket chili??  Yes please & thank you!  The corn bread is just delicious.My friend had half and half brisket & pork and she couldn't decide which was better, she loved both.  I can't wait to go back (and would've this week had it not been closed on a Monday.)"
"Smoque is absolutely delicious. From their smokey and savory brisket,  creamy and crusty mac & cheese to the crunchy coleslaw everything there is just great. I fell in love with everything there. There will be a wait to get your food and to sit down. It is a deli style operation. I would suggest you try a little bit of everything, they offer such a platter, but if you are a fan of brisket skip everything else and get that. It is juicy, smoky, tender and the bbq sauce that accompanies it is vinegary, sweet and spicy all at the same time. Delicious! Once you get your food and sit down to devour this amazing food you will thank me for my suggestions."
amazing... that's all there is needed to be said. be prepared to wait in line and be patient.
"MMM indulgence.... picture: decadent, charred, smokey, tender meat. All the meat.Two different sauces... one sweetish and thick, the other... juicy and pungentMac & Cheese: Thick, crispy, tangy, creamy, perfectionPeach Cobbler: Sweet, crumbly, fruity, and warmTexas Sasuage: Crisp casing, juicy... PEPPERY but not overpowering, juicy, melt to your knees sasuage.(not a fan of savory cornbread, so I'll leave my image of it out)Oh how I want to run there this instant! I want to give this place 5 stars, but I don't go often to BBQ restaurants so I don't have much to compare it to. I used to eat normal chicago bbq... but now, I'll never go back! This place is meat heaven. Please remember, its best to take it home, I've never been able to eat there without getting elbowed in the ribs or get my hands stuck to the sticky table. The only reason why I stay away more than I want to is the crowds.. sometimes, its just too much :("
"I finally ate at Smoque after several tasty take-out orders. It was a Tuesday evening but the line was pretty long, but did not extend out the door. The ribs taste even better on the premises! Someone will ask if you are dining in or taking out, and will point out an empty table for you. We left a bit after 8PM (they close at 9PM) and the place was still crowded."
"Smoque is amazing. It's far from our current residence but when we lived near Smoque it was our go to for great BBQ. Although I do miss when it wasn't so crazy busy. The owner used to be able to take the time out to speak with everyone, but now its understandably impossible given the long lines. The only downfall is it isn't located near a lot of public transportation but there are a few bus lines if you live in the area."
"Got the brisket and was excellent. I grabbed an extra one to go so I could bring it to work for lunch the next day. Fries were good too, and the food was fairly priced. Definitely plan on going back again."
"This place made me love brisket-- I'm really a pork girl (I'm Filipina!) but the beef brisket was juicy, beautifully smoked, and tender.  Love the sauce, and the ribs are good too.I'm really picky with my mac and cheese, and this place gets it pretty good.  The beans hit the spot too, with bits of brisket.  It's not all that comfortable a place to dine-in as the lines can be long and the place is really too loud for conversation.  So, take it to go and you are good to go!"
"Smoque was great! As someone that doesn't eat red meat or pork plus the talk of lines, I was a bit hesitant to head here. I went during prime dinner time during the week and only waited a few minutes in line--which I definitely needed to figure out what to order! There was someone that cleaned a table and sat us immediately after we ordered. We waited about 10 minutes for them to call our number and grab our food. It smelled and looked fantastic!We ordered a salad with smoked chicken, mac n cheese and the brisket platter with fries, coleslaw and mac n cheese. It was a lot of food that wasn't all finished! With drinks it was $26. I wished there were more chicken options (there was 1 plus salad w/ chicken) or fish. But there were a lot of sides that didn't have meats to choose from and the coleslaw, fries and mac n cheese that I tried were good."
"AWSOME!!!I'm definitely a fan of Smoque!We thought we were there early to beat the dinner rush but even at 5 pm, the line was pretty long but by the time we left, the line was out the door and around the corner.We waited 30 minutes to place our order and another 20 minutes to get our food to-go but well worth the wait!!We ordered the brisket (sliced not chopped) platter with 2 sides along with an add-on order of the St. Louis 1/4 rack ribs. 1. Brisket: Absolutely Delicious - 5 starVery moist and so tender...the BBQ sauce is very tangy and not as thick as other BBQ sauces.  It's not really sweet either...more spicy and with a vinegar tang to it. 2.  St. Louis Ribs - 5 star1/4 rack = 3 pieces of juicy ribsCome with it's own unique sauce that is thicker than the brisket sauce and not as tangy but goes very well with the ribs3. Slaw - 5 starReminds me of sauerkraut and nothing like your KFC slaw.  It's just finely shredded cabbage with blk pepper with a tangy kick (once again, not sweet)4. Peach cobbler - 3 starI haven't had many peach cobblers so I really cannot be a judge of this dessert but it can be best described as canned peaches with a gooey cinnamon/sugar base with some sort of bread/butter/sugar crumb topping.  I had one bite and the hubby at the rest but let's just say that he devoured it ^^"
"HOLY MOTHER OF ALL THINGS HOLY this place is frickin' delicious. I love going there with a six pack and a friend and gorging on brisket (by far, my favorite). The last time I was there, they weren't serving the St. Louis ribs which was a good move in my book. I had them one time and they were kinda tough and not horribly flavorful. The brisket though... .oh, the brisket. If I could fall in love with a piece of meat I would drop mad L-bombs on that brisket.The mac and cheese is to die for, the BBQ beans are always a solid choice, chili is pretty tasty and  even though I don't typically like coleslaw, I even enjoy that. Something I really like about this place is that you can get a ""taste"" of something for the low, low sum of $3... so you can really try everything. It's safe to assume that as long as they're dishing out tasty noms, I'll be there helping to keep them in business."
"Disclaimer: I'm vegetarian, so take this review with a grain of salt and a lot of BBQ sauce (which smelled heavenly, btw). Unless you're also vegetarian, in which case I must recommend that, should you get dragged here by some carnivorous buddies, do not sulk.Order the mac & cheese. Make that a double order. Do it. That's an order."
"I'm not a BBQ connoisseur by any means, but this place is delicious, no doubt about it. It's true that you will generally have to wait for your food (abt 15 min. for us at 2:20PM on a weekday) and you will probably have to wait for a table (but your food will be timed to your seating). However, Smoque doesn't seem to have either dropped the ball in either its organization or its setup. Smoque is simply too popular and it's dealing with that in the most sensible way possible. So instead of hovering over people as you might do in HK, Smoque has a dude who asks you if you're eating in or out and places you on a list for seating accordingly. If you think about the space, Smoque isn't actually tiny or cramped. It has tables and seats for at least 40 people. It just seems that way because those seats are always filled. In any case, if you're whining about the wait ... you're contributing to its popularity so it seems a bit circular. IDKAnyway, I enjoyed everything I ate. My only gripe in terms of the food is portion size (again) I know, but this time of the sides. I know the focus is on the meat, in my case - baby back and st. louis ribs, but I do wish that some of the sides (Mac 'N Cheese, Baked Beans) were a little (a lot) larger. I don't know that if you order them separately instead of as part of a platter if they'll be any larger, but the side orders that come with a platter are definitely not sized to share. The only exception to this is the bag of their steak cut fries, which are delicious. As for the food itself. St. Louis Ribs were very tender and moist, the baby back ribs less so - but apparently this has to do with sauce distribution.The mac 'n cheese was the tastiest version I've had for a while without any graininess and it definitely tasted of real cheese and not that cheez whiz stuff. Baked beans were just delicious. Cornbread was a little on the dry side if you were to eat it by itself but paired well with the ribs. I also love how the coleslaw is not mayo-based (vinegar instead). It provides a really welcome interlude of crunchy sour fiber. The meal for 3 people came out to about $50 for two platters of ribs that we couldn't finish. Each platter came with about 12 ribs. Platters come with slaw and your choice of 2 sides.Smoque is also michelin-starred (I assume 1 star but feel too lazy to fact-check), if you're interested in that kind of stuff."
Phenomenal barbecue.  I take it to go all the time since it's right off the expressway.
"Overrated.After reading all of the great reviews, my girlfriend and I could not wait to try this place out. I was extremely disappointed.I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was pretty good, as was the coleslaw, but nothing special. The pulled pork sandwich, unfortunately, was not very good at all. The pork did not have much taste to it and when I added more of the bbq sauce to it (which they give you on the side), it did not do much to add taste to it. I have had much better pulled pork elsewhere (Carson's).My girlfriend tried to Memphis ribs. She thought that they were good. The service was good, but I think you can find better barbeque elsewhere."
"Smokin'!!  Sorry, I had to say it.  This place was oh-so-good!!  I came here for lunch because I'd read that the restaurant routinely runs out of food and if I am going to travel all the way to Irving Park for food and I can't get any...well, Johnny T (like Wayne Brady) will have to choke a b!tch.  And I am trying to cut down on my assaults and batteries for the year.  Trying.So, I was armed with the address and I made my way down Pulaski from the Blue Line.  It was bright, I had my sunglasses on, I was strutting, saw the address, opened the door, walked in...and it was a dentists office.  I tried to play cool.  I told the receptionists that I was ""meeting a friend.""  Then I had a pretend conversation on my cell phone with my 'friend' saying that ""I was at the office and she could pick me up now..what was that...oh, if you are running late, that is fine.  I'll walk around.  I feel a little awkward waiting at this office anyway...""  And I left.  I am sure the receptionists were laughing at me.Walking next door (and trying to reclaim some cool), I finally entered Smoque.  There were a decent amount of people sitting but still some empty tables.  I sauntered up to the register, ordered a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries and a soda.  With tax (hi Todd!), that was $10.14.  Not bad.  I went to the soda fountain, drew some SWEET TEA (the only non-alcoholic beverage to drink with bbq) and sat my happy self down.  Then I remembered I'd been on the CTA and I washed my hands in the restroom.  And used some towellettes.  In the midst of my hand-cleaning OCD, my order number was called!  Immediately, I was impressed by the portion size.  The sandwich is served on a thick wheat bun and there's a more-than-generous amount of pork and sauce awaiting your lips.  Add to that a BROWN PAPER BAG full of fries, container of extra sauce and tub of slaw (with vinegar, not mayo; I hate mayo) and I was ready to dig in.  Remembering my Southern upbringing, I took a bite of my sandwich without adding sauce.  Yum!  Tender, seasoned pork and just the right amount of sauce made for a flavor explosion in my mouth.  Remembering my gluttonous ways, I dumped the rest of the sauce on the sandwich and sopped up any extra that ran off with the bread.  That's how we get down in the dirty dirty.  I assume that I was eating like Homer Simpson because I caught some looks of horror as I gulped down sweet tea, made smacking noises as I ate my sandwich and stuffed fries in my mouth.  I didn't care.  There were free refills to take advantage of and food in front of me to eat.  The looks are deceiving re the portion size.  The folks at Smoque do not skimp on portion size.  I'm a big eater and I was barely able to clean my plate.  I was happy that I didn't order the cobbler, as I would not have been able to eat it.  Since I was in a trance-like state as I gorged, I noticed a few things on the sparsely covered wall.  1.) a crayon drawing done by a child, complete with the word ""Texes.""  It took every bit of my self-control to not turn the ""e"" into an ""a.""  I am still thinking about it. 2.) I couldn't stop giggling at one of the plaques.  It was the EAT OUT AWARD for BEST BUTT.  Hee.  Dirty, but oh-so-humorous to my 12 year old mind, it made me laugh and laugh.One last free refill (and giggle at the best butt to, well, you know) and I was on my way home.  I barely made it back to my place before I passed out from a full belly.  And, ladies & gents, that's good eatin'."
"My husband and I went to Smoque after we had seen a special on the Food Network for the best BBQ and man was it good! I dont know if it's like this every night or because it was a Friday, but the line went from the counter to outside the door. It was almost wrapped around the building. Basically you have to order your food first and then the host seats you. The food is so delicious that the tables turn around fairly quickly. It's a really small place, so it's not even a guarantee you can sit and eat. We were lucky and were able to get seated quickly. The St. Louis ribs are amazing. Very smokey and tender. And living in the South....we know our BBQ.  We tried a taste of the sliced brisket b/c everyone said it was to die for. It was like butter! I rather have the ribs, but the brisket was definitely good. The mac and cheese was SOOOO yummy, but they only give you a tiny little cup. We also had the beans, which were strange for us but most seem to like them. The french fries were very good and the coleslaw, which is vinegar based, was alright. I prefer more of a mayo based coleslaw. Basically you're not there for the sides, you're there for the meat and the meat rocks! Here's a tip for parking: After 5:30 there's a little parking lot with a wooden fence around it connected to the restaurant that you can park at. Nobody was parking there b/c the sign in huge letters says no parking, but there is an exception after 5:30 in small letters. Otherwise if you dont park there you have to try and find street parking and it wont be close. It's worth going after 5:30, so you can park right next door!"
"Long overdue for an update.  Since the original post (and we have been to Smoque no less than 20 times since it opened) we have gone back probably 5 times for carryout. The brisket is STILL the meat of choice here (my husband gets chopped, I get sliced). Maybe once in the last 5 visits have I noted that the meat was a tad dry - but it's always flavorful and generous. While we still like the fries, the integrity of them (like anywhere else) is lost when you do carryout and they are not piping hot and crunchy. Our new favorite?  The beans are awesome as is the brisket chili!  Highly recommend.  In the final analysis...we still love Smoque and it's definitely the best BBQ place in shouting distance of 60657."
"Be prepared to wait in line for a while, this place is busy.  Is it worth the wait?  I'd say so.  The food is pretty good.Of course everybody has their own opinion about what makes good BBQ, you're going to hear mine.  Their Brisket is always great-- tender and flavorful.  I'm not really a fan of the giant sweet bun they use for the sandwich though, its kind of a distraction from the meat.  Baked beans and Mac n' Cheese are perfect!  I get a quarter slab of St. Louis style ribs almost everytime I go because sometimes they are perfect (flavorful, smokey, chewy) but sometimes they can be a little dry and tough-- its a little bit of a crap shoot, but when you win you win big!  They use a dry rub that has a little bit of spice to it, and they pair it with a sauce that's a little more sweet.  People used to Chilli's or Applebee's boiled ribs will be in for a surprise!"
"5 stars. DUH.Ordered pulled pork sandwich. Delish! The bun is soft but stays together (a pet peeve of mine are wimpy buns! No more wimpy buns!) My boyfriend had the same but his came with the slaw. He piled it on top his pulled pork and loved the crunchy fun it brought.We also both got the 1/4 slab of St. Louis ribs. The rub was a little smokey for me, but i ate them alllllll nonetheless. I just slathered on their A mazing vinegar BBQ sauce. I only wish they supplied wet naps, as I go through 25 napkins in one sitting!The corn bread is always a favorite of ours when we go to Smoque. A little word of advice- they don't have honey-so bring your own! This is how it goes in my house:Boyfriend: 'Want to go to Smoque?""Me: ""Yeah! Grab the honey, honey!""We love Smoque!"
"The food was awesome... Beef brisket was the most tender, juicey I've ever had. BBQ sauce to die for."
"4.5 Stars! Awesome moist, juicy baby back ribs, ditto on the brisket, very good coleslaw and yummy cornbread. Cannot wait to go back!Why can't BBQ be this good in the northeast? *crying*"
"Brisket equals awesome, when are we getting smoque II in my neighborhood?"
"Best bbq I have tried here in Chicago.Sliced brisket, excellent.The pulled pork is tender and juicy.Ribs had a nice bark and flavor.Don't make the mistake of not ordering the peach cobbler.The line is always out the door and indoor seating is limited. Be mindful of this if you come rolling up in the winter with a group expecting to sit and take your time."
"After hearing so much about this place in the media, etc. Our experience at this place was a BIG disappointment. The food quality is mediocre but you they charge you so much more.  The ribs are not as tender and flavorful as could be. The beef briskets are a bit dry.  This is one of the few bbq places that offer briskets.... not all bbq restaurants in norther IL sell beef brisket.  I do have to say the restaurant definitely had good PR going for them."
Best pull pork I've ever had
"St. Louis ribs were fantastic, seasoning very well done and very juicy.Didn't like the fries as much, but they were still good with the BBQ sauce.Slaw was fresh.Didn't like the cornbread as much as I would would have thought.  But maybe it was because I already had dinner before... dinner."
"I tried it all, and I loved it!  Wish it was closer to my home.Cobbler is great there, brisket is tender and juicy.Ribs were great and so different than one is used to here in the midwest. The sausage was excellent as well.  Owner was around making sure everyone was happy, and I like that a lot.5 stars....all day."
"I've enjoyed barbecue all over the country.  Smoque is among the best that I have ever tasted. Out of all their meat options, the ribs are the most notable. Both the St. Louis, which are larger and meatier, or the baby back, which are leaner and smaller, are fantastic, and hold up well with the best from Texas or Alabama. The rub is great, the smoke flavor is excellent, and the meat is obviously of very high quality.The brisket, either chopped or sliced, and the pulled pork, are both excellent as well. The meat is lean, which may be why some reviewers find it dry. It's also why I choose the ribs over the brisket and pulled pork every time. The Texas sausage and the chicken, which I've only had in the salad, are also very, very good.The sauces are excellent. Unlike traditional Chicago barbecue, the meat is the main player here, and the sauces do not dominate the flavor. That said, both the rib sauce and the pulled pork sauce are excellent.The cole slaw is vinegary and complements the meat quite well. It is one of my favorite parts of the meal.As for the other sides, my favorites are the brisket chili (which they don't always have), the baked beans, and the fries. The mac and cheese is also good.The place is a bit cramped, and their system for organizing who sits when is effective and charming. However, I have not sat down to eat at Smoque for some time, preferring instead to phone in my order and skip the occasionally long line. It also is not a place to linger, unless you want to heartlessly deny barbecue goodness to the people in line.They also do catering, and are partly responsible for my happiest birthday party ever.I love barbecue. Smoque is the best place that I have tried in Chicago for barbecue, and is among the best places in the country. Truly a gem."
"Hour 10 min wait. Good thing it's a great night. As usual great food. Excellent brisket and ribs. My six year old loved the 1/2 chicken. Personally I don't see what the fuss is with the Mac and cheese, but I love the cornbread"
"I like Smoque for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is a perfect example of what happens when somebody likes something enough that they devote themselves to trying it out and not stopping to get it just right. The second reason is just that...they got barbecue just right.The sliced brisket is juicy and flavorful, and the ribs rock. Also, be shire to get a side of BBQ beans. They are sweet, smokey, and have bits of beef brisket in them. Could it get much better? I think not."
Smoke excellent. Had the brisket and brisket chili. I know my BBQ and can tell that hours of prep work goes into each cut of meat. Freshness was on point. Very legit here. Staff is frienly and adequatley staffed. Hit it up.
"I've been here twice, both times have been of equal quality.The dining room is pretty small and the line is long, but most people don't linger too long after eating and the host staff is awesome about arranging tables for a big party.  Even though you order before being seated, the host staff coordinates with the kitchen so that your food isn't done before a seat has been found for you.  Both times I've come, we've had a big party of around 8 people and getting seated hasn't been a horrible experience.I'm a huge fan of pulled pork, so that's the only thing I've ordered both times.  I find the sauce TO DIE FOR.  After living in North Carolina, I've really become a fan of vinegar based bbq sauces, and Smoque's sauce definitely has that ""tang"" to it.  I could bathe in the stuff.  Friends have ordered everything else on the menu and I've tried bites of it.  I like them all, but will always stick with pulled pork.I would have given this place 5 stars, but I'm taking a star away for the horrible excuse that is their coleslaw.  I know that everyone may do their slaw a bit different, but really there is no reason to deviate from the creamy goodness of traditional coleslaw.  These guys do and it's not a good deviation.  Can't wait to go back for more!"
"Best Mac and Cheese and I could bathe in the cole slaw... (shout out to no mayo!).Brisket is cool as well.You have to wait in line a la Hot Doug's which is kind of annoying sometimes... especially because if I'm going to wait in a Hot Doug's style like, I'd like to see Doug at the end of it... or at least the same face every time...  no matter- the food is good.  Highly recommended."
So delicious!  and BYOB
"Most decent BBQ places can pull off excellent pulled pork and chicken, but I find a lot of places in the Chicago area have terrible brisket. This place is not one of them. Their sides are good, and I love that the place is BYOB. Yum yum."
"Best ribs in Chicago.  Brisket ain't bad either!  Even though there may be a long line, be patient.  It moves quickly and the staff will always help you get a seat."
This place is great. They really know how tho bbq cooking everything low and slow. The mac and cheese is among the best I have ever had. The ribs are perfectly cooked and the house sauce is great. The only small complaint is that there can be a wait depending on the night. Who can fault a place for being popular though. Great food at a fair price.
"YUM! YUM! YUM! I had the beef brisket today - so tender and tasty, I am not a fan of beef, but it looked so good, had to try it.  The mac n cheese - just as yummy!  The ribs are seasoned well and the meat is T-tender!"
"Read tons of positive  reviews and saw them praised on many TV shows. So, I visited this place 3 times.Basically, I tried everything and everything was OK. It wasn't mind blowing. And if I'm being critical, the meat was just too bland. Without the sauce their wasn't much ""Smoque."" Really, where's the smokey flavor from properly smoked BBQ? If your joint is called ""Smoque"", shouldn't  the food have that signature BBQ flavor/smell?Being less critical, everything was just down the road, very light flavors and nothing over powering. It's BBQ done OK. Not too dry, but not too moist, but I guess just not enough ""Bang"" or ""Yeow!"" for me.My wife just doesn't care for it and like me can't figure out all the praise. She just can't believe all the hype for just OK BBQ.The line is always long here and be prepared to wait. The counter people have complained that there isn't more space for more cash registers. The place is small and getting a seat is tough.The place is relatively new, clean and nice. Parking is tough around there too, street parking mostly.Its location is in a quiet neighbor hood and easy to get to since it is near a highway exit ramp."
"I love this place!!!  I saw this resturant/dinner on Food network and found it to be interesting.  Apparently these guys went around the counrty and found BBQ that was good, then they brought it back to Chicago.  I've had Texas BBQ and it's pretty much the same, but they have more types of BBQ.I think there BBQ is a little spicy, which I love.  Plus the sides are pretty tasty.Only waring is watch out for a long wait, since it's not that big."
The brisket sandwich is a party in my mouth.  End of story.
"Great brisket, ok baby backs. Vinegary slaw was superb (reminded of Phil Johnson's of Deerfield)."
Brisket was good.. But the pull pork was fantastic.. For being in Chicago it is a very good bbq. place. tight place so don't bring a crowd..
"This is by far the BEST BBQ I've ever had! I have to get the beef brisket every time, despite my contemplation to go for something different for once....BUT I love the brisket and by the time I get there, I've already made my mind up that I want that again. Haha. (That's when I just start trying things off of my boyfriend's plate) ;-) Anyway, the fresh-cut fries are to die for, the coleslaw is the best around, and the mac-and-cheese side option is awesome. Oh...and it's an absolute MUST to save room for dessert! I must warn however, that when it's busy, parking is a pain in the butt to find! However, if you're willing to drive around for awhile waiting for a street spot to open up, or if you want to just park in Timbucktu and hike it back...it's well worth the effort!"
"The best BBQ brisket is the best I've ever tried. It was easily my favorite dish, and the entire menu was good.Here are my two gripes:They need to make it easier for a group to buy a sampler platter of all the meats. ""The Feast"" at Famous Dave's may be a sales gimmick, but it's the best way to serve a table of people BBQ that I've seen. They need a $60 platter of meat at Smoque.The seating in the dining room is stupid. We were told to sit down and try some fries while we waited for some friends, then asked to get up so another party could sit, then we were given another table. It was confusing and annoying.The next time we were in the mood for brisket, we just got it to go."
Amazing and worth the wait!!!  Best BBQ in Chicago.
"YUM!!! Everything here is SO good. I feel like I'm a decent BBQ connoisseur, and this easily passes the test. The brisket is amazing, the ribs are delicious, the pulled pork is surprisingly tasty... the list goes on. I like ordering the baked beans and the macaroni and cheese and mixing them together. Don't go with a group--it's a small place and hard to squeeze in as is. But definitely worth any wait!"
"I loved this place. I got the brisket and then I got the mac n cheese, the cobbler and the beans as well as the coleslaw (I love sides). The meat was delicious and I loved my little tray filled with tubs of my delicious side dishes. Yum! Good thing this place is kind of far, otherwise I'd be there all the time!"
"I am not a barbecue expert, but this place is awesome. It was my first real exposure to the real thing. Since trying Smoque, I have tried many other ""authentic"" places, but to me, nowhere else comes close. The brisket and ribs are really outstanding. Ribs are tender and meaty, with a nice smoke ring. The brisket is fork-tender, with deep and satisfying flavors. The sauces are good, but I usually find that I barely  need them!Additionally, I love the sides, especially the slaw and the mac and cheese. As a Wisconsinite, I know something about mac and cheese -- this is stellar. Definitely. Go."
"Excellent bbq. The ribs had a fantastic rub and great smokey flavour. They were served dry with sauce on the side -  the way good bbq should be served. Mac and cheese was good, coleslaw was good,  and the beans were only okay. Price is fair."
"Smoque has been making quality bbq for hordes of patrons for a few years now. I have always gone for the brisket, which is consistently excellent, and sometimes enjoy the pulled pork, which is also outstanding. I am not a rib fan, I don't generally enjoy meat off the bone. Perhaps this invalidates my opinion to hard core bbq fans. I apologize. I will say this, however, I do love me some ribs from Smoque.Damn, these guys know what they're doing. I had the pleasure of living mere blocks away from Smoque, so I could often catch them during their ""slow"" hours, so the door-escaping lines were not often a problem for me. If you're anything like me, and don't really want anything ""green"" on your plate when consuming bbq (vegetables have their uses - accompanying bbq is not one) ask to sub corn bread for slaw. Also ask for a side of both kinds of sauce to maximize your smoque experience.Update - After dining at many more BBQ places in many other states, I have decided that this truly warrants the five stars."
"the best i've ever had?  no, that honor goes to Blue Ribbon BBQ in Newton, MA ...but it was definitely very, very good.  Sliced brisket was very tender, I loved that - but I agree with what several people said, it lacked some flavor and definitely needed sauce.  Good portion of meat....I was stuffed after eating maybe 1/4 of the meat.  I wished I had a piece of bread or something with it though...next time I may just get a sandwich instead and save some $$.St Louis Ribs - Nice rub, fall of the bone, hearty.  Add sauce if desired (which I recommend cause their sauces are tasty-see below).  One of us had a taste portion of the pulled pork - which in all fairness I did not try, but was told was very good...I liked both the vinegary sauce and the other thicker smokier/spicy sauce (for the ribs)...Fries were good, not greasy at all, and a pretty good portion I might add!Mac & Cheese - good - pretty small ""side"" - but not the best I've ever had.  it was ok.  Cole slaw...I actually likes the cole slaw..I am not a fan of mayo and really like citrus so it worked for me.  It was a nice light contrast to what was really heavy meal.  The line never went down, but we did not have to wait for a table either so it worked out.  I never felt rushed to leave, in fact the guys were always good about telling us to take our time.  For three of us to eat it came out to be a little under $60..which was reasonable considering two of us had full platters and the other had 1/2 slab and taste portions, plus drinks.  (remember, it's BYOB)I probably would not make this a nightly outing both for financial and health reasons, but I would definitely venture out to Smoque again, if anything to grab a sandwich or two and some of those sides we didn't get to try this time!"
"I hate it when places don't live up to all of their hype.  Luckily, Smoque BBQ hasn't received any praise it didn't deserve.  This place is great!  From the hand pulled pork to the succulent brisket, you just can't go wrong.  I suggest you call ahead on a Friday or Saturday night so you don't have to wait in the massive line.  I am not kidding- The line is huge and well deserved."
"BIGGEST TIP-BRING YOUR OWN BEER! The smell from the door made me even more hungry then I already was! We arrived on a late Friday evening with a large group with the line out the door. We were all seated together in about 30 minutes, this place MOVES!  I had a pulled pork sandwich which turned out to be a group favorite.  I would definitely recommend it !  My only tip for next time is that I would order the fries as a side, I ate quite a few of my friends who ordered them! Parking lot is in the back for customer use so that was a HUGE plus. It was worth the drive outside of the downtown area."
"First time there. What wonderful BBQ! The brisket, pulled pork, St Louis ribs were all amazing! That brisket is to die for. The baked beans and mac and cheese were terriific sides. If you don't mind the wait, we waited about 50 minutes from the time we got in line to the time we got our food, it is well worth it!! The place is a little small and seating is tight. But the price is right and the food is off the charts. I'm a huge fan and can't wait to get back there."
"1 year ago, I would've given this place 2 stars based on the chicken and pulled pork - both were mediocre.  I also had a tasting of the brisket, which is the ONLY reason I agreed to go back recently- it was the MOST TENDER, SOFTEST brisket I've ever had!  I normally hate brisket but I turned into a fan at Smoque.Since I read Nick C's recent review before my most recent visit to Smoque (as the fiance was dying to go back), I understood that they offer 2 different sauces and maybe that's where I went wrong.Al (the host who was seating us) gave us his recommendations for which sauces to put on what.  All I can say is that the ribs were delicious on it's own but with the ""regular"" bbq, it's to-die-for!  The brisket was awesome again and they were nice enough to give me the vinegar based sauce and the tomato based sauce on the side so I could do what I like.  Both sauces are great but it's a matter of preference for how you want to top your meat.  We also tried the peach cobbler - YUMMERS!  The crust was caramelized and had almond slices to give it an extra crunch!  I'm still drooling!"
"After a day of turmoil and trouble, my boyfriend and I decided to have a date night in.  Ribs was his request of the night and, although we love Gale Street Inn for their ribs, I wasn't in the mood so, after a terrible first experience, we decided to give Smoque a second try.We went there on a Friday evening for pick up and, unlike the first time, didn't even have to wait in a line.  We walked up to the counter, grabbed two paper menus (as the chalkboard menu gives my eyes hell) and stepped to the side.  About 3 minutes later, we were approached by one of the employees who asked us if we had any questions and, upon our decline, politely excused himself but made sure to tell us where we could find him if we changed our mind.We finally decided and, again, were able to approach the counter immediately.  The counter help was beyond friendly.  When I asked her how the brisket chili was, she offered me her opinion, mentioned she likes it with Tabasco sauce and offered me a sample.  Sample? Sure!  Except that the sample was an ala carte sized side of the chili which we devoured while we waited for our actual order to be ready.He chose the St. Louis Style Ribs w/ Corn Bread & French Fries.  The ribs were rich in smokey flavor, moist, tender but still edible off the bone (without crumbling).  The corn bread was average and, although I'm not huge on french fries, there is something about the aroma of theirs that makes me sneak a few out of his bag when he's not looking.  I chose the Sliced Brisket w/ Brisket Chili & Mac & Cheese.   YES!  The brisket chili was so good that I actually got a second side all for myself!  The sliced brisket was so tender that I struggled to actually pick it up with my fork.  The accommodating BBQ sauce that comes along with it on the side had the perfect amount of zest without overpowering the flavor of the brisket itself.  The mac & cheese was also delicious.The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because, for the price, I believe the portions are are a little on the small side.  The meat itself is substantial but the side portions are lacking just a bit.    The side of brisket chili was average sized and so were the fries but, I'd like to see larger corn bread muffins (or offer two for the price you're charging for one) and larger mac & cheese portions, for sure!I should mention they are  BYOB joint, as well!  We plan to dine in on our next experience - the pulled pork is the next thing on my menu!So glad we tried this again!  The first time was just a fluke and, honestly, probably more so on our end then Smoque's. :)"
Best BBQ in the city and suburbs with excellent customer service. Everything is delicious but the brisket is superb.
classy and still can watch sports and eat bbq
"Went on Friday night and my wife and I liked it a lot. I had the half baby back ribs half St. Louis ribs.Both sets of ribs were very good. The 1 star negative was that the baby back ribs were very fatty. Three ribs on the end were almost all fat. And the side dishes are too small. That goes as a positive though since the sides were very good.Sides: Macaroni & Cheese and Backed Beans - The Mac & Cheese had a nice crust on it and was served in a small (too small...see above) dish and the beans were served the same way.If you don't like lines or crowds...you might want to go at off times. Luckily when we got there there were only 8 people in front of us. Ordering and pickup was easy, and the staff was really nice. Especially with keeping the seating moving. I will definitely be going back and ordering a WHOLE slab of the St. Louis style ribs. Oh forgot, the BBQ sauce there rocks."
"Delicious! Some of the best BBQ I've had in Chicago. The brisket is delicious and amazingly tender. The sides are amazing as well, definitely try the baked beans and the mac n' cheese.  Will definitely be back here again!"
"This place did not disappoint!  I've been here 4 more times since I first initial visit.  I'm in love with the baby back ribs and the brisket!  Literally ife changing! It's absolutely delicious!  Pulled pork is amazing too.  Love both of their sauces too.  Just tried their brisket chili and it's awesome!  I'll be going back for more of that when the weather becomes more brisk during football season!  They have the only peach cobbler I'll eat.  I like it because it's more like a peach crisp than a true cobbler.  The corn bread is good.  Baked beans are good. Mac n cheese is good.Love that it's BYOB.  I brought a bottle of Zinfindel, which paired well with the smokiness of the food.  We were lucky enough to snag a spot outside. ;o)I think what I like most is that it's a paired down, simple kind of place.  It's not trying to be something it's not.  Just good BBQ at affordable prices.  Can't beat that!"
"I don't think I would have made it here without the help of my Dad's car...I do not have the patience for long long bus rides to the north side of the city nor for insanely long lines and table waits, combining those two things in one trip? Forget it. My Dad, his girlfriend, the little sis, and I hoped in my Dad's Jeep one evening and came here for dinner. It was around 6:30pm on a weeknight, and line was out the door. We nearly left and went somewhere else, but my Dad's girlfriend insisted that the food would be worth the wait. Finally we got inside and noticed that a guy was taking orders so that the line would move a little smoother and quicker. He was also nice enough to see to it that we would get a table(all of them were full) and get me a paper menu because my eyes were not allowing me to read the chalkboard menu. We finally made it up to pay, were kindly seated at a freshly cleaned table, and waited about fifteen minutes or so for our number to be called. I went with the half and half. Half pulled pork, and half brisket sandwich. For my side I got the Mac and Cheese. It also came with coleslaw. The pulled pork was tasty. Though It was a tad on the bland side, somehow the smoke didn't fully come out in the meat. The sauce helped to add some zing though. It was a tasty sauce, I really liked that it was a vinegar based BBQ because it had a nice tang to it. The brisket half was a whole other story. It was moist tender super smokey. Also had a different sauce. Still tangy but it had a little bite to it as well. The brisket was the clear winner. I ate all my coleslaw, I usually am not a fan of the stuff, but it was not a mayo based slaw. It was crisp tangy, slightly sweet. Yum. The mac and cheese was done very well, it was buttery creamy and cheesy. I just wish that the side had more than three bites in it! Also I got to sample a rib. Which was super flavorful and smokey, but not tender. To me they were kind of tough. They are dry rubbed with sauce on the side. The sauce with these was a little strange, It actually kinda reminded me of curry, which wasn't what I was expecting to taste. I sampled some BBQ beans as well. The smoke taste in the beans was a little overwhelming, not my thing. All in all there were a few things I enjoyed and a few I didn't so it adds up to an A-OK in my book."
"My friend Candice took me here, and all I can say is wow!!! Best BBQ ever!! The price cannot be beat, the place is busy as can be and they turn out food very quickly. I definitely enjoyed it and cannot wait to be back. The Peach Cobbler is amazing, the Macaroni is heaven, and the Brisket... is the way to go. Everything else is good beyond a doubt, but please try the brisket!"
"The bbq here is really good.  I got the sliced brisket platter with a side of mac and a side of fries.  The brisket was saucy and very tender - almost too tender, verging on stewed.  The mac, though tasty, was too small of a serving to be satisfying.  The serving of fries was a good size, and the fries were delicious - skin-on and cut not too thick/thin.  Great cole slaw - I dislike the normal mayonnaise variety, but Smoque's was tangy and refreshing with absolutely no mayo.The pulled pork was also good, and, to my undiscerning palate, tasted very similar to the brisket.  St Louis ribs were good and smoky as well, but served with the same sauce (though thicker) as the other bbq-ed meats.Laid-back atmosphere.  Good food, decent prices.  If the meat held up a bit better or were a little more distinguishable across mammals, maybe it could warrant an extra star."
"I don't think I had ever eaten sliced beef brisket before in my life.  But my dad insisted that it is the best, so I ordered it.  I inhaled the entire sandwich (after carefully adding their tangy, tasty sauce).  The brisket was very nearly as soft and chewy as the bun that surrounded it.  Incredible flavor.  We also ordered the mac & cheese on the side, and loved it.  The small side order of mac & cheese is not big at all, so don't plan to be all ""healthy"" and share it... get your own!!   It is very close to the highway, so it was very easy to pick up my order to go.  You MUST go here."
"I have yet to make it inside this place, but that did not stop me from enjoying their BBQ.I had ribs and my bf had the Brisket. For the price, it was not amazing, but okay. The sides were not memorable, as I can't remember what we had. This place is ALWAYS packed, so perhaps one day I will dine in."
damn- that's a lot of reviewsI will say this:BrisketPeach Cobblermore Brisket
Five stars!  100% lives up to the hype!  Pulled pork and brisket were both delicious as were the corn bread and decadent mac 'n cheese!  Can't wait to go back to try the ribs.
Smoque is decent at best. It's the fast food of BBQ. If you want good BBQ go to Lillie's Q on North Ave and Milwaukee. I promise you it's way better. Smoque couldn't even hold Lillie's jockstrap.
Being that I am from Memphis I truly don't make it a habit to try BBQ from other places.  I branched out and walked to Smoque's with a friend.  This place is about 4 blocks away so that is very convenient.  As we approach the restaurant I see a line of people to get into the door.  Now anyone who knows me knows that I am totally against standing in line.  If I had been alone I would have continued to walk until I found another place.  I did suck it up and 45 minutes later I was inside preparing to order.   For this reason I will probably never eat inside of this place again but now on to the food.The BBQ was good.  I can't say that it was the best I have ever had but it is definitely worth returning for carry out.  So I give this spot 3 stars because it's Chicago and there was actually a good BBQ joint.  I took one star away because it really should never take 45 minutes to get inside of a place to eat.
"Finally... Guy Fieri was right about something!Yes there is a line folks. Even on a Tuesday night. But like every night, its worth the wait. I had the brisket platter, mac n cheese, fries and a peach cobbler.I have to admit, I was kinda put off by the seemingly small portion of mac n cheese and cobbler served in mini muffin tins. Portion control never goes over well with me. However, as soon as I started to get a taste of everything, I was pretty full and didn't think I can finish the cobbler. My favorite thing is that the cobbler was only $2!!! At some places, I want to have dessert but usually never have room for it in my tummy or my wallet. Overall... it was bomb."
"I have had BBQ all over the US and Smoque has the best ribs anywhere. Their rub is so good you don't even need to use sauce. The pulled pork is very good. The brisket is fair. Seems to always be over done.  The beans are very good and their Mac and cheese is fair. Too dry actually. If you haven't tried this place you are missing a great place. The St. Louis ribs are my choice over the baby back, but you won't go wrong with either one."
"Smoque is by far my favorite BBQ in the area.  It must be...my husband and I drive 30 minutes just for take out!The St. Louis ribs and their sauce are our favorites.  We also like the pulled pork, brisket, BBQ beans, mac & cheese, corn bread and the peach cobbler."
"Holy Smoques. Been here many many times and it never disappoints. Most recently, my lunch partner and I shared a brisket platter with cornbread, mac & cheese, a 1/2 and 1/2 sammich, fries, cole slaw, and peach cobbler. Everything was delectable.  The peach cobbler is silly good, like about to have a crisis good.  All of the meat we had (which was a lot) was tender and juicy.We went around 2:30 on a Sunday and there was plenty of seating inside and only a few people in line ahead of us.  Want the ultimate test in self control? Live within a couple blocks of Smoque and try to not go there everyday. Fortunately, I have since moved and my cholesterol has thanked me."
"Smoque is good BBQ, don't get me wrong, but lets be honest, I think all the hype left me disappointed. Smoque appears as if it is a BBQ joint you would find in the Middle of Texas, such as the one on Friday Night Lights, but in my opinion the sauce was just not that great, and sauce makes or breaks the BBQ. The sauce is tangy, which I usually am a fan of but it detracted from the food. I did enjoy the brisket and sausage. I did not like the feeling like I was being pushed out by people hovering for a table although it slowed by the end of my meal. This understandable due to the size of the place. Overall decent prices but over rated. Good place for people who have not experienced real Texas style or Memphis BBQ. In my opinion Honkey Tonk BBQ in Pilsen is superior and much more authentic."
"My biggest complaint about Smoque is that it's closed on Monday, but they are still cooking and the smell is fabulous if you are walking through the neighborhood. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. Other than that, I have nothing but positive things to say about this small storefront in the Old Irving Park neighborhood. My family goes to Smoque on an average of once/week: on the way to school, on the way home from school and at various times in between. My 8-year-old would probably rank this as his #1 restaurant in the neighborhood -- we go for a bag of piping hot, fresh-cut fries to share on the way home from school on Friday afternoons. My 4-year-old prefers Hot Woks, Cool Sushi, but he's unlikely to turn down a side of Smoque mac & cheese -- served with a nice crust of breadcrumbs on the top. My 6-year-old, a latent picky eater, turns up her nose at the kids' mac & cheese (served without the breadcrumbs and therefore a bit runnier)...and then promptly finishes the bowl. The portions at Smoque are generous, almost to a fault. I usually order from the children's menu, opting for a mini brisket sandwich (both chopped and sliced are great) & fries and a side of crunchy cole slaw. I'm sated, but not overfull and it makes a weekday lunch at Smoque more affordable. If a giant portion of meat is not your thing, the salad -- with or without smoked chicken (unavailable otherwise) -- is pretty tasty. I've tried about 85% of their menu and it's all great. My husband likes the ribs and baked beans and my oldest child digs the pulled pork sandwiches. I do not like the mayonnaise-y cole slaw served in most restaurants, but I love Smoque's vinegar-and-honey version. Communal seating may bother some -- especially if you happen to be in on a Tuesday afternoon with a crowd of Chicago's finest in uniform -- although it minimizes wasted space in a popular restaurant where there is pretty much always a line. However, I've had some lucky accidents in seating arrangements and am seated next to or see someone I know three times out of five. Smoque also provides catering for private parties. I've ordered from them for family parties and it's a big hit and very easy."
"Does this place need more reviews to prove they got good bbq? No, but I'm gonna say i was really pleased with my meal there and hope the owners are delighted with yet another good review. I had the rib combo with the mac and cheese, slaw, and brisket chili (of course, with a friend). It was all tasty and even though it was so far away from where I live and  it was rainy like crazy going back home, I was full and happy with my meal that I didn't even care. I did also have a food coma afterwards."
I totally love the brisket and the fried. It was nice and juicy with a nice smoky taste. The ribs are awesome too. The only place I have had it better was Salt Lick in Texas but not by much.Do expect a long line out the door for a rush hour on weekends. So I normally go there on weekdays night instead.
"Eh.  That's all I can say.  I was SOOOO excited to try this place.  If I remember correctly, one of the owners took a sabatical and went all around the country finding the best BBQ and taking those recipes and molding it into one.  And I have to say I wasn't that impressed.  Will I go back?  Sure.   But I seriously think all the hype and the crazy long wait to get your food just isn't worth it."
I wasn't over impressed with Smoque.  I've been there a few times.  Definitely one of the better options in Chicago proper for BBQ
"Awesome sides, awesome service, not the best pulled pork in town.I love pulled pork, probably too much for my own good, so I was really looking forward to eating here after having heard such glowing reviews. Maybe it was the anticipation, maybe it was a bad day, but I was sorely disappointed. The pork was just barely OK - way too dependent on the BBQ sauce for flavor, and way too tender. What's too tender, you ask? Well, if you could take the pork and sell it as baby food, you may have crossed the line from ""tender"" to ""mushy."" I didn't know this was possible to do with meat, but Smoque showed me that it is.The sides, however, were incredible. Probably the best baked beans I've ever had, and the macaroni and cheese was really great too.The restaurant smells delicious, and you shouldn't be intimidated by a line running out the door because this place runs like a well-oiled machine. The staff gets things done.I'd definitely love to come back and try something other than the pulled pork, or maybe just have a big vat of those delicious baked beans - worth a star all on their own."
"This BBQ is great!  I've lived in Texas for 7-8 years so I know about good bbq!  I had the babyback ribs, which were tender and delicious.  The brisket was very, very tender, easily breakable just using your fork.  The mac 'n cheese is delicious as well.  I think the side dishes are a bit small for the price, but the bbq can't be beat by anywhere else in Chicago.The service staff are very friendly as well."
"My friend Ewa and I went here for dinner tonight because she loves ribs and Smoque is famous for their ribs.  She ordered 1/2 and 1/2 Rib Plate, which is half slab Baby Back and half slab St Louis style ribs.  For a skinny Polish girl, she can throw down some ribs.  300 lb police officers were in there getting to-go boxes for the same thing, but Ewa ate every morsel and left a pile of bones on her plate!  I had beef brisket sandwich and mac and cheese.  Our clothes still reek of BBQ.  The owner was so friendly and delivered our food to our table for us, then brought us extra bread warmed up just for us!  It was worth the 20 minute wait in line."
Great bbq...lives up to the hype
"My favorite BBQ in Chicago.Awesome sides, like beans, mac and cheese and apple crisp."
"A bit loud, but the restaurant was very nice and the food was solid."
"sliced brisket, to die for..............tasty ribs, beans with pieces of smoked meat, great mac and cheese, sweet peach cobbler.........yum."
amazing!
This place is amazing.  I am from the south and had my fair share of great BBQ.  This is up there with some of the best.  Must go in Chicago.
What's all the Smoque about? Nothing to write home to your grill about.The End.
"I think Smoque's rating here on Yelp speaks for itself. The place is not much to look at from the outside or the inside, but the food is out-of-this-world good. If you're a vegetarian, I'm not sure this place is for you, but if you're like most other people and you like meat - oh man, it's heaven. The food is simple, it's prepared quickly and IT'S SO GOOD. If I lived closer, I'm not sure I would be able to stop myself from coming back everyday."
"This place is soo damn good!! Best of all its cheap AND its BYOB too! What more can you ask for.Peak hours have a very long line but it seems to move rather quickly. The food is cheap for the portions. For $10 I got pulled pork, a small side of the best mac & cheese everrrr, and fries! Just an FYI, they turn over tables quick, so this isn't a place to eat and linger. Eat. Drink your beers. Leave. Go, go, go!"
"Amazing.. Delicious.. Mouth watering Brisket sandwich Cheesy and satisfying Mac-n-cheeseFresh and Tasty Coleslaw (As if the other awesome reviews don't speak for themselves) If you haven't been here, you should make the trip.. its well worth it."
"Everything you've ever wanted in barbecue. Make sure you grab some extra napkins, because you're going to devour this food so fast you won't have time to be tidy."
great BBQ.  i usually get the ribs.  meat is a tad dry but the rub and sauces are great.  dont sleep on the peach cobbler either.  its mind blowing
"I wasn't sure what to expect, but Smoque is a very down-to-earth BBQ joint reminiscent of those you'd find in North Carolina. You wait in line to order, give your number to the guys manning the tables, wait for your order, and those guys find a table for you. We got there with the lunch rush on a Saturday afternoon so I was afraid that we'd be standing with our food, waiting for them to find a table for us, but tables turn quite quickly and we were seated before our food was called. The hubby ordered the sliced brisket platter with mac n cheese and cornbread. I got the pulled pork with bbq beans and mac n cheese. Both orders also came with coleslaw. My pulled pork was so good! Moist pork with crispy edges and skin, with a side of bbq dipping sauce (sweet and tangy). The hubby's sliced brisket was delicious and clearly a favorite as most tables had at least one order of it. The mac n cheese were served in little foil cups and had a breadcrumb topping that added some contrasting texture to the creamy, cheesy mac underneath. The cornbread was good, nothing spectacular. The bbq beans though - those were spectacular. Served hot, with chunks of beef, a good amount of spice and tang. I loved it. The slaw was simple, vinegary, and nicely cut through the rich, sweet, spicy bbq sauce and beans. Pulled pork -- Beans -- Bite of Mac n Cheese -- slaw -- sip of Sweet Tea -- Repeat. We left with full tummies and happy hearts. We'll definitely be back to  try other menu items, namely, the St. Louis ribs!"
"I'd like to think we were one of the few who frequented  this place before they got so cool....but they took off quick!  We love you Smoque, and you will be greatly missed when we move away :( Consistently great BBQ"
If you are wanting some good ribs you can't beat this place.
"I love this place so much, my husband and I had it catered for our wedding party once we got home from Vegas. Everyone loved it and it was no problem pawning off the left-overs on our guests. Everything was delicious and sooooooo reasonable. Their staff was prompt and polite and had everything running like a well oiled machine. Well done."
"Great brisket and pork, make sure you ask for both bbq sauces."
"Am I the lone dissenter here?  We tried to hit Smoque on two separate occasions over the past couple of weekends and the line was out the door and down the block.  I don't like lines so we didn't wait.  Last week, we had a free afternoon during the week and decided to head to Smoque for a late lunch.I didn't love it.I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich platter.  1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 chopped brisket with beans and slaw.  The meat was dry.  Both of them.  Either they were cooked to death or they sat in a warming tray for a long time and we got the end of lunch service.  The beans were really tasty.  The slaw was good, vinegar style, I like it.  My friend had the 1/2 and 1/2 ribs.  1/2 St. Louis and 1/2 Baby Back.  They were okay.  I liked that they weren't cooked to death and falling off the bone, they still had some structure to them.  They were tasty, but I've had way better.  He had beans, slaw and mac & cheese.  The mac and cheese was ok, but not my fave.  Overall, the service was really great, the people were nice and it's a typical BBQ atmosphere.  I love BBQ, but being raised in the south, I think I have a pretty high standard.  Think I'll pass on visiting Smoque again."
"I had BBQs from a lot of different BBQ joints, and I must say, this place is on my number 1 list for BBQ in Chicago! The workers there are really nice and the service is fast. I ordered the ribs with two sides. The ribs looked too dry to me, but when I took a bite of it, it was actually tender and delicious! For the sides, I had the Mac and cheese and the brisket chili. Both sides weren't that amazingly great to me, but they're pretty good. I had the sample of the peach cobbler from my bf's plate and that was amazingly good! I'm not a big fan of sweets and I usually complain if a dessert is too sweet for me, but as for the peach cobbler, it had the right amount of sweetness to it, just the way i like it! I also had a bite of the brisket from my brother's gf's plate and I actually like the brisket better than the ribs. But overall, I'm satisfied with my meal and I'm pleased with the fast and great service they provided us."
Hands-down the best BBQ in the city. Possibly the best BBQ in the country. And you won't find a better value anywhere.
"Nothing to see here, move along.  Nothing to see, move along![pause]Are they gone?Good, those of you left behind should lean closer while I tell you about something you need to try.  First, please excuse me while I may seem rude, I need to lick this BBQ sauce off my fingers. Ahhh.The food here is simply good stuff.  While it's not the best BBQ I've ever had, it's damn tasty and it could hold its own in a smoke-down.  First up, contender #1, the pulled pork.   Standard fare, and as far as I'm concerned, the bar setter at any BBQ place.  Very tender meat and I really liked the extra sauce served up on the side to add a bit more wetness, because some of us like it like that.Second up, contender #2, coleslaw.  One word: vinegar vinegar vinegar!  That counts as one because it was just repeated, right?  Smoque does coleslaw just like I prefer and not creamy at all.  Only fresh, crisp, and vinegary.  Snap!  Did I mention vinegar?Contender #3, the fries.  Big, hearty, and served in a brown paper bag.  That's cool.If you go here hungry, don't order a small side of anything expecting a huge amount.  It's literally a small portion.  Also, don't expect a quiet, private conversation with your bestie or a date.  The tables are communal and just enough elbow room to keep the person at the next table from slopping BBQ sauce your way or swiping a nibble of that brisket.BYO helps the wallet and makes the experience overall a good value.  The friendly staff is the icing on the cake.The winner?  Your stomach.  Easy call."
"Finally ate here just this past Monday, the seating arrangement is family/picnic style so make room for others to sit next to you. There is a nice big board for you to read the menu. We decided to get half and half. I wanted the pulled pork, she wanted the brisket. Was it amazing and tender! The sauce was really good and vinegary, I wish it was thicker, but still worked out. The mac n cheese is a must have along with the scrumptious corn bread! Last but not least, peach cobbler was really great...all it needed was a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The price is really good, and all for about $22 for the 2 of us was more than enough! There is always a line, but it moves pretty fast and worth the wait if you are a BBQ lover! I will be back for more even though I make some good pulled pork myself hehehe..."
"AMAZING BBq chicken!!!! have been looking for something like this for years and then couple of years back I finally found it!!! their sides are really hearty and delicious too!!!! the coleslaw there is to die for too, could drink the dressing!!! never dined in, always take out. Note, they are closed Mondays!!!"
"I heart this place a lot! A LOT!!Love their BBQ and pulled pork. By far the best I have found and I've always on a mission for good BBQ. I love that you get extra sauce when you order since I'm an ""extra sauce"" type of girl. This is my favorite place to go for lunch. Great atmosphere and while it's a little busy during the lunch hours, it is definitely worth it. I've talked to the owner a few times and I love how he's always there and enthusiastic about his restaurant. For the record, I wasn't a big BBQ fan before this place, but Smoque changed it all for me. I didn't know it could be so great! Gotta get the fries...they're pretty tasty and come in a paper bag."
pretty good. pretty pretty pretty pretty good
"If any place I know in the city of Chicago can be described as 'finger licking good', it is Smoque BBQ. Off the beaten path, this little shop of glorious smoked meat creations provides a small menu, but big flavor. I found my way here after a catered event by Smoque to try their foodums first hand. And I was thoroughly impressed to say the least. The meat is perfectly seasoned, and absolutely melts in your mouth. The mac n' cheese oozed with goodness. The BBQ sauce was heaven sent. And don't you dare leave without the cobble. It was PACKED on a Wednesday evening when I ventured it, and I had to wait a bit... but it was worth it. If you are a fan of BBQ, you will be a fan of Smoque."
Not sure about all the hype - I like the cole slaw and salad a lot.  The ribs were alright but I would go to Pork Shoppe instead.
best brisket in Chicago
"Throw a dart at the menu. Anything you hit will taste great.Actually slap your hand on the menu and order all you hit. It's that good. The brisket, pulled pork, mac and cheese, beans, and peach cobbler are amazing. The service and atmosphere was very nice too!"
Anytime a restaurant has a wait....its because their food is excellent! We waited for 30min on a Sunday. This bbq reminds me of the great bbq from the south. Definitely food that you will crave!
"A little while back I was researching BBQ joints in the city when I came across Smoque.  It had a ton of great reviews and had been featured on Guy Fieri's ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"".  (You can see the segment here.)  It looked pretty darn good so I thought I should probably give it a go.What I learned from the show is that the guy that opened this place had little restaurant experience and no professional cooking experience.  He was just an IT guy who decided he'd ""rather make ribs"".  So he and a couple of his buddies traveled around the country figuring out BBQ.  They decided not on one style, but a variety of styles from the likes of Texas, Tennessee, and the Carolinas.  Kinda cool, I thought.The other great thing about the menu is that there are plenty of different combo options for maximum sampling.  We ended up with 3 meats and 3 sides between 2 of us.The St. Louis Ribs were definitely delicious.  The held together when you needed them to but were super tender to bite into.  Good and smoky with plenty of sauce for dipping.Here you see our half and half sandwich.  It's pulled pork in the foreground and sliced brisket behind.  Both delish but for me, hands down, the brisket wins the grand prize.  I'd go so far as to say that next time, I'd skip the others and eat A LOT of brisket.We were less enthused over all with the sides, especially the beans.  Kind of disappointing after watching the video and getting excited to try them.  They were just way too sweet for me.  The slaw, too, was a little less than exciting.The mac 'n' cheese, however, merits its own picture.  This was dangerously delicious.  All I had to say about it was, ""Oh my God.  This is what mac 'n' cheese is supposed to taste like?""  I've never been a mac 'n' cheese person but maybe because I've never had a good one.  Until now.  It was creamy and cheesy and moist.  Not at all dry and sticky with pasta so overcooked it's impossible to stab, like most versions I've tasted in the past.  This one was worth the calories!I have to say that I'm a little sad that we didn't try the peach cobbler.  Oh, well.  Next time.The place is obviously a quick-serve restaurant.  Very casual as you can see by the styrofome containers and plastic ramekins.  You order at the counter and hope that there's a seat available for the 'host' to direct you to.  They'll call your number in a few minutes for you to go up an retrieve your food on a cafeteria tray.I think we must've walked in at just the right moment because as soon as we sat down, the line had stretched all the way out the door.  The good news is that these guys crank it out so even if you do have to wait, it's not for long.  But that also applies to you so just know that this is not a place to linger.  It's just understood that you are expected to get up the immediately after you've finished.  Understandable, though.The Short Version (Out of 10)...Food:  7.5Service:  9 (friendly and fast)Ambiance:  6  (it's not about the ambiance)Overall impression:  8Would I go back?I don't often eat BBQ and it's pretty far out of my way so you probably won't see me here much.  But that's not because it wasn't good for what it is.  What I'm saying is, just because I'm not going to be there doesn't mean you shouldn't be!"
"Smoque you were smokin....!!!!!!! With that said....I didn't know what to expect of Smoque. My friend had seen them featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives : Guy Fieri : Food Network. My friend said Guy has not steered her wrong yet and he didn't! It was the so damn good I ordered food to go. The place was packed and yes we had to stand in a long line and endure communal seating (which I cant stand) but it was ALL WORTH IT!!! The brisket was so tender it just fell apart, the Mac and Cheese was so sinful, BBQ Beans were delightful, and the cole slaw...OMG i hate cole slaw but I would go here just to have the cole slaw. Peach Cobbler that would make you slap yo momma it was so good! Price was great and people were good!I will definitely go back to get my Smoque on!"
"Smoque has some of the best BBQ I've had in the city.  As other yelpers have said, you will want to get there early.  On a weeknight you should be able to order and enjoy your dinner if you get there around 615, but come 7pm it's a packed house and seats can be hard to come by.  I had the chicken and pulled pork and the sauce really made the meal.  The side dishes were good but nothing to write home about.   Deal Tip: They have a parking lot you can  use on weekdays located directly behind the restaurant to avoid Chicago's favorite Laz Parking."
"This is the stuff all of the other BB-Q places in Chicago are trying to do, but no body does it as good as Smoque! The Brisket is amazing,but you better order ahead because they only make so much. When it's gone it's gone till tomorrow. Pulled Pork is ex as well!"
OK I feel the need to yell this from the roof tops .MORE LOCATIONS GUYS PSSST Guys SUBURBS SUBURBS SUBURBS you are sleepy SUBURBS
"Finally made it to Smoque today. BBQ joint on Pulaski 2 blocks south of Irving. It is touted as best BBQ in Chicago. Chicago, yes? Outside of Chicago? Passable. Ribs= very good. Not par boiled and slathered with sauce. Decent smoke and rub ONLY!!!! Thank goodness. Don't ruin good meat. Sauce on the side. Pulled pork= Above average. Brisket= Chicago has real problems smoking brisket. I bet they shortcut the time. No smoke ring (dead giveaway), tender, semi juicy but not the smoked flavor I like. I can tell it is a fraud when I got out of my car and had to go to the address for the place and didn't follow my nose. Even upon entering I did not experience olfactory heaven. It was more like limbo. Sorry. Stay with the Italian Beef, Vienna dogs, and Gibson's steaks. Smitty's and Salt Lick do not have to worry about competition from the Nawtheners..... JohnnyChitown needs to throw his hat into the ring."
"I went here to try the hyped up brisket along with the St Louis Ribs.True Barbeque = Low & Slow.The line outside the door = Long & Slow.The Brisket, pulled pork, and St Louis Ribs = Delicious!The brisket and pulled pork were tasty and moist and the St Louis style ribs were a nice change of pace from baby back ribs.  Great flavor on the ribs, which are often underrated.  Try 'em! I'm a fan!"
"Love no bullshit, finger-lickin' good BBQ?THEN SMOQUE IS GUARANTEED ORGASM IN YOUR MOUTH.-Tender meat.-Out of this world BBQ sauce.-The best sides (they give you what seems like a pound of fresh cut fries that perfectly seasoned, their macaroni and cheese is GODSEND, and their cole slaw is PERFECTION)...Smoque, can you be my new boyfriend?Tips:- Call ahead. And make sure you do this EARLY. The wait can be for up to an hour.- If you are picking up your food, don't forget to throw in forks, napkins, ketchup, etc...the staff doesn't do that for you. Enjoy. I've seriously never had better BBQ."
"Not only great food but great service.  Have guys waiting to get you anything you need, take your plates when done, open the door.  This restaurant is a well oiled machine."
"Brisket is 5 stars (smoky, ridiculously tender), ribs r 3 stars (not that tender, pretty good flavor tho).  (5 + 3)  / 2 = 4."
"Ambiance:  Pretty low key.  Not your typical restaurant, but more like Portillo's where you pay for your food ahead of the time. Simple decorations but I got the impression that people came in there to EAT and not for their ambiance.THE GOOD: let's see, their RIBS were DELISH! - Both St. Louis and baby back style!! Their Mac N Cheese was pretty tasty, but came in a small individually backed foil container.  Fries was typical, but... IT'S BYOB!!! That's always good on my book. The sauce was great! They have their own version of a bbq sauce which had a sweet and tangy taste.  THE BAD:  I wished they served more of Mac N Cheese.  For the little container that they had, they were charging $3.  I also wished they had more variety of sauces instead of one.The Service:  OK.  Some guys walked around to make sure everything is OK.  They have a Fountain drink so you'll have to do your own refills.BOTTOM LINE:  IF you're looking for a really good bbq ribs, this is pretty good!  You get in, you pay ahead, eat, drink, and be on your way!  Their ribs was very tender and their own bbq sauce was prettty tasty too.  And it was pretty reasonably priced."
"Get the brisket and the sausage.  You will not be disappointed.  Feels a little commercial, but the food delivers!"
I love this place! Consistently good all around.
"I had high hopes for this place. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't impressed either. The baked beans where awesome and the mac N' cheese was great too. I tried the beef brisket and it was tender (burnt on the outside, but didn't taste burnt), but just lacked flavor. The BBQ it came with was weak and just about any famous dave's sauce would beat it (not saying Famous Dave's sauce is that amazing either, but it's at least something to compare too). The sauce was sweet but that's it. I also had the Texas sausage, which was good and had decent flavor. Prices were very reasonable and the environment is great. Everyone was friendly and it seems like a well oiled machine. I would definitely eat here again, but it I wouldn't go out of my way and would probably try different meats."
"My bf and I came here during our first trip to Chicago in search of good local Chicago food.  Based on the spectacular recommendations on yelp, we thought we'd give this place a try.It was.... ehhh okay.  I don't eat meat, but my bf got the combo ribs (St. Louis and baby back), but it didn't look like there was any difference between the two.  We're not even sure if he got the right order since they tasted the same.  We had a side of cole slaw, mac n cheese, cornbread, and peach cobbler.  The mac n cheese and cornbread were average.  I loved the cole slaw... it was different in that it was less mayo-y and more tangy with some citrusy or vinegar base.  The peach cobbler was pretty good too.Overall though... it wasn't anything we'd rave about and probably wouldn't go out of our way to revisit Smoque if we were in town again.  For us, we don't know how Smoque has such raving yelp reviews.  Maybe it's really good BBQ for Chicago... but I know for my bf, he's had the best BBQ ribs at Phil's in San Diego, CA and Dinosaur in NYC.  But Smoque in Chicago just didn't seem to compare."
The food is good and the place is clean. Even though I can walk here I would rather go somewhere with bigger portions of sides and things like fried pickles and sloppy servings on my plate.
"I've never stepped into the place, though take out RAWKS.Either dine in or pick up ALWAYS phone first and see what's left.Phone orders appear to get priority and if you've ever been victim to Smoque running out of food...this is how to increase your odds in getting what you desire.Brisket and pulled pork by the pound! only way to do it, take it home and feel like its Christmas as you unwrap the silver wrapped packages of cholesterol clogging goodness.What's even better is the leftover brisket the next day mixed into the BEST omelets EVER!"
"Smoque take-out is a tried and true crowd pleaser.  I've brought Smoque brisket to birthday celebrations, family get togethers, and even to a friend who had lost a parent.  It's good comfort food.  Try the brisket (chopped or sliced), baby back ribs, and the BBQ beans."
"We arrived at smoque at about 2:30 on a Saturday, and it was packed. The service, however, was very quick, and for how busy they were, extremely friendly.It was my first time there. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries, and I added a taste of the sliced brisket. My total came to about $13. We were seated after ordering and waited for our number to be called. When our food was ready, my first impression was how small the sides were. I tasted the coleslaw first and thought it was a little on the sour side.  At this point you're probably wondering why I gave this place five stars.After one bite of the meat, I knew I was going to give it at least four. After all the remaining bites, I knew why the sides were the size they were. I was pleasantly full. The coleslaw, after a few bites of the rich bbq sauce was a pleasant palate cleaner, preparing you for the next bite of perfectly smoked meat.Next time I go, I'm getting the sliced brisket. Next time I go will probably be later this month."
"It definitely was not the best bbq I've had. I tried the brisket sandwich and pulled pork platter. Both meat kinds were not flavorful and the sauce didn't make up for it. It was on the more watery and tangy side. The meat tasted boiled and then smoked. I will compliment the sides and service. The place had a busy, crowded, popular feel to it, but things were organized. You place your order at the register, someone comes and asks if you will need seats, you stand and wait until a seat opens up (they find seats for you), and then wait for your order to get called. Cole slaw was not creamy - which I liked. Mac&Cheese was the best! and cornbread was good- I just wish the portions for the sides were a little larger. Fries were delicious too."
"Not that this place needs another review, but I've been several times by this point and never get sick of it.  The meat and BBQ sauce is delicious and the people working there manage to always get us a table right after we've ordered, despite how busy it is."
"Fabulous food!  Brisket, ribs, mac & cheese, cobbler!"
"My husband introduced me to this little BBQ place a few months ago, and since then I've ordered a brisket from there for Passover and dreamed about it no less than 4 times.  Look - okay, BBQ chicken = boring, right?  WRONG!  I've never had chicken like this before in my life.  Did you know that BBQ chicken can be juicy?  Flavorful?  Sexy?  Ok, maybe not sexy.  Nevertheless, Smoque's chicken tempts me away from my usual brisket or ribs staples.  I haven't tried the Texas sausages yet, but I'm sure I'll get around to it one of these days.In summary, Smoque is hands down, some of the best BBQ in Chicago.  Please do not take this claim lightly.  I love BBQ like a bear loves honey.  I also love honey.  By the transitive property, I am a bear.  Yay logic."
"Saying that you don't like Smoque is like saying that you don't like Radiohead or The Beatles. It's just lame. These dudes are BBQ scientists, and they've uncovered the secrets of perfect BBQ, and they make it the same way, every time. Good gracious, I recommend going with a group of four and splitting 4 different entrees so that you can sample all of the meats. And listen to Paranoid Android on the way there."
Mmmmm glad this place is so close to my house. The ribs are AWESOME! Try this place out. Nom nom nom!
"Considering Chicago isn't Memphis, Kansas City, or any where in Texas we might not be the greatest judge of talent when it comes to BBQ. However, if we're just talking food and how good it tastes, Smoque is where it's at. I've had both kinds of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and the sausage. Not one of those meals disappointed. And I've had them all more than a couple of times each. Consistently good and spot on. The only thing I don't like about Smoque is the size of the place and the wait for food, especially in the summer when the line is pretty much out the door. Sides are small too but evry good especially the mac and cheese, but this isnt enough for me to knock it on points. I'd give it a 4.5 if possible, but since I can't a 5 will do."
"This was my first visit to Smoque in quite a while. The Brisket tasted better than it did on my last visit. The place was packed on the Sunday afternoon I made my visit. But they did a real nice job getting everybody seated. They held your order until you got a table so your food was served up nice and hot. I ordered the Brisket and a side of a Chili. The Chili was listed as the special side of the day. The Chili was fabulous. It was made with Beans, Brisket and onions. It had a nice kick to it. The Brisket was a decent sized sandwich. The Dry Rub they used was tasty. The sauce they use is decent but It could use a bit more heat. I added some Hot sauce to mine to give it a little more of a bite. All things considered, it was a pretty good sandwich.  The bottom line is that Smoque is a nice alternative to the more expensive BBQ joints in Chicago. It's a bare bones dining experience. If you are looking for a fancy night out, you may want to go elsewhere. The interior reminds me of a High School Cafeteria, just a bunch of tables, chairs and Napkin holders. But it was a $9.00 Brisket Sandwich, so I'm""m not complaining. Smoque is good BBQ at a affordable price. I can do without the Bells and Whistles. It's all about the food."
"Everyone loves Smoque...its been talked about, reviewd, and talked about somemore. Mary had been here a few time...and this was my first trip. Line: of courseService...pretty good....food came fast.We ordered the pulled pork...brisket and a taste of ribs.side of mac and cheese.Pulled Pork to me was lill dry...brisket was juicy,tender and had a nice dark bark to it...with pleanty of Smoque to it. Very tasty one of the best I have had so far...ribs we very smoky and had a good smoke ring to them...jus a tad bit strong...but not overpowering.The biggest hit for Me tho was the Link Meat/Texas Sausage very very good! That was the big surprise of the day...LOVED IT! Huge flavor...just the right amount of smoke, and depth.Mary loved the brisket...didnt like the ribs...and said the same that I did about the pulled pork.Smoque was good overall...maybe a tad overrated, to Me. I wasnt left blown away like most ppl. Worth a spot in the Top 5 in a BBQ list."
"I know the food is good, but if it's such a pain in the arse to get it, well for me, forget about it. As per usual they were out of something, tonight it was the chicken. I don't mind waiting for good food, but there's a problem when it's so crowded that you can't even get in the place to get to the counter to place a to go order. I'm glad I didn't place an order by phone, because I'd have to ask people to get me up front as if I were in a mosh pit.I've gone here many times, and I've left without food more times than I have left with food. I know most you feel the Yelp love for this place, but for me, all I'm feeling is hungry."
"Pretty good food for bbq in the city! but....... there was no sweet potato fries. I thought sweet potatoes were synonymous with bbq places!! Much disappointed there.. but the corn bread and peach cobbler were pretty good. We got there around 7p.m and had to wait to get into order, but we didn't have to wait too long to get seated for a group of 7. I did feel like I was playing bumper cars with other customers though as we were standing and trying to get water because it was just that packed!"
Smoque is by far thee best BBQ I have ever had! and let me say that I have had a lot! It is sooo delicious and not very expensive at all ($4-$10) But the best part of the restaraunt besides the food is the service.The first time I went to smoque I ordered a pulled pork sandwhich and the owner gave me free brisket also to try and mac n cheese. The second time I didnt have enough money for what I wanted (forgot most my money at home...opps) but they gave it to me anyway! Its such a friendly and warm enviroment that is so welcoming I would recommend this place to anyone!!! try it out!!! :)
"The first time I had tried Smoque it was shortly after they first opened and we had gotten take out.  I was very under-whelmed and had no real desire to go back.  But Andy's brother wanted to go for lunch the other day, so we gave it another shot. While it certainly was no 5-star experience, I could tell they had made improvements.  The brisket was juicier and was of a thicker cut (before it was served almost minced).  The sauce was good, but too watery and too high of a sugar content.  The mac and cheese was lovely and creamy, but the cheese flavour did not pop through like you would expect - it tasted more like a thick white sauce with a tiny sprinkling of cheese throughout. The peach cobbler was a huge improvement which i was pleased to see.  instead of a cup full of tiny, anemic looking peach bits slathered with a tasteless crust, now we have plump yummy peach chunks under a crisp, brown oatmeal topping.  For $1.95 it was a perfectly portioned, tiny bit of sugary delight.However, eating there is more difficult than giving a spoken word beat poetry performance to a room full of weak bladdered, deaf elders.  Oh my god!  If seating takes the navigational skills of a Navy Seal Commander, don't you think it is time to do something about it?  Expand, move, offer take out only?  It was absolutely insane and this was at 2:30 on a Sunday! I can't even imagine what a lunch hour or a Saturday during dinner would be like.  Yikes."
"We met another couple for dinner here and found the dry rub ribs tender and delicious. The default sauce, was a little disappointing compared to how well prepared & cooked the meat was - the sauce was trying too hard, but next time (!) I will explore sauce options, there were choices, but as this was my first time, I was curious to see what I would get.The sides (corn bread, (vinegar) slaw & peach cobbler) were just ""OK"", by comparison. The corn bread was tasty without applying butter, but nothing to write home about. The Peach Cobbler was OK, but I think that I was in the mood because reflecting back (1 hour ago), there wasn't anything that really stood out. I'm not a big fan of vinegar slaw, in general, that being said, this was well prepared, good proportions of pepper, cabbage & vinegar (I ate it all).My wife had the brisket it was also very well seasoned & cooked (I got to taste). The brisket sauce was different than the BBQ sauce that came with the ribs and was tasty (IMHO). She liked her Mac & Cheese, which she is very picky about.Given the ""atmosphere"" & seating accommodations, I was a little surprised that it was over $30 for two dinners. That being said, the food came up (#1) reasonably quick and the table was cleared inoffensively. Smoque is near the top of my heap for casual bar-b-q."
"This place is so good. I can see why people trek to it. Just off the Blue Line makes it pretty easy to. Lucky for me I live a couple blocks away. I have to will myself not to go in there all the time. I think my favorite is the brisket, but the ribs are great too. The BBQ sauce is amazing. I like all the sides. The slaw is refreshingly real and light. Really good. So is the cornbread. I could order a whole meal of just that."
tried but not woth the trip...only OK
"Not bad. Probably one of the best in Chicago, actually. It's just that there AREN'T many good BBQ joints in Chicago. They just can't quite find the right mix. Case in point: Smoque. GREAT meat. Quality, in that it's actually smoked everyday, and the aroma of the place brings you to your knees. But their sauce? Not for me. Perhaps I'm spoiled by having lived near Texas for a few years, but there should be a little more natural flavor to the sauce. Oh, and my ribs were cold and the brisket was stringy. I can't fault the pink and grey, though! They know what they're doing with slow smoking the meats. Bottom line: If you're a fan of straight up smoked food, you're overdue here. If you like flavorful sauces, you probably need to go somewhere else."
"A friend treated me to this place last week and I think I may make him my bestie just for this trip alone.I went from his recommendation and got the brisket with a side of french fries and macaroni and cheese. The platter comes with coleslaw already. The brisket was like BUTTER BABY. So, tender..very flavorful  and delicious. I barely had to slice it. The sauce they pour over it was tasty although not as sweet or tangy as I prefer BBQ sauces to be but still very good. The coleslaw was good, they use a vinaigrette dressing I think. I like that its not a traditional mayo slaw. The mac and cheese was inspiring. I want to figure out what cheese they used and how they made it so creamy and cheesy. Fries were crispy and a great compliment to the meat. They give you so much food that I suggest going on an empty stomach or being prepared to take food back home for later. Dessert: Peach Cobbler!! The topping is crispy and almost like a baked granola that you have to break to get to the fresh tangy peaches and sweet cobbler beneath. It was very good! All three of us at the table was tasting and trying to dissect the ingredients. & I like the location because its so inconspicuous. I guess thats Chicago for you too though. It's nestled in a mostly residential neighborhood and a fairly quiet spot. The resteraunt itself was packed on a Sunday afternoon. It's not a huge place but its obvious that business is going well. It's also a nice family friendly spot. Many of the tables were filled with families eating Sunday dinner.I am definitely going back one day soon to try more things on the menu."
love the ribs and brisket w spicy sauce and pickeled jalapeños!!!! wish it was closer!!!!!
"Best in the city, bar none. The rub is great and the sauce is just a bonus--the meat really doesn't need anything at all! Had it randomly catered at a company I worked for and have been addicted ever since!"
"This place has a real bbq pit feel, lots of communal tables, small, and smells delicious. I had the rib combo with slaw, peach cobbler, chili, and corn bread. Of the ribs, the baby back were better without the bbq sauce, while the st. louis were better with the bbq sauce. The St. Louis rib I thought was the better of the two, and they are inherently meatier which makes them more satisfying. The peach cobbler was really delicious, the slaw was good - though I would prefer less crunchy, the corn bread was good but not addictive (I prefer either sweet or with jalapeno), and the chili was ok but I couldn't really detect the brisket and I'm not a fan of a strong tomato flavor. It really all comes down to the meat though, and that's the best rib meat I've found in Chicago."
"Rows of people lined the inside, disorganized pockets of people outside were tapping their toes and looking at their watches hopelessly crossing their fingers that they would not be late for the Super Bowl. Fortunately for us, we zipped in through the express ""I called ahead"" line and got our food in no time as they were very organized with tables of pre-ordered food waiting!The look on some people's faces could only be compared to that of a college kid running out after a massive liquor run as I saw guys hauling hundreds of dollars of food with boxes stacked upon boxes looking like a giant tower of Jenga ready to collapse in seconds. We made our heist and hauled back the food to Super Bowl central.For the first half we munched on Lawrence Fish Market sushi and were very intent on eating ribs at associated side orders during the Halftime show featuring The Who. As the bum rush to the kitchen ensued with boxes and foil flying everywhere, I landed a slab of ribs and some cornbread for my troubles.The ribs were tender, heavily seasoned and had a magical smoky flavor. In the dead of winter, Smoque gave me a slice of summer sitting on my plate and I savored every sliver. It will be well worth it for me to go back, line be damned."
"4 stars: A casual place for yummy comfort food.I'm not a huge BBQ lover, but I like this place a LOT and get regular cravings. The ribs are really good - their Baby Back ribs are tastier than the St. Louis, but the St. Louis has more meat (so more bang for your buck). They both have an amazing smoky flavor that I love, the sauce is tangy good, but the meat is not as tender and juicy as I would expect. The Macaroni&Cheese side is creamy n'delicious and I think the Peach Cobbler is the only dessert they have, but it's the only one you need, it's so good! The place is small and the tables are crowded (so don't expect to have long, intimate conversations, though why would you while you're stuffing your face). The food's just as good ordered to go, so if you don't live too far, I'd recommend taking your food to eat comfortably in your own home."
"I went to Smoque on a work lunch trip with a vendor and was amazed at how packed the place was. It was kind of ridiculous. Good thing we had reserved a table! The line was very long and the wait was somewhat agonizing, since the aroma of brisket and pulled pork wafted everywhere and I was starving! Finally, we were served our food. We were cramped at the table, literally rubbing shoulders with each other, but that didn't matter so much to me, the food was excellent. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was very good. Came with fries and cole slaw. I only wish this place was less chaotic. That's the only thing that keeps me from going there again soon. But believe you me, I will return there again some time because frankly, the food is GREAT."
"All the hype is true. Everything you have heard about Smoque is all real. It really is that good.A pack of friends and I decided to meet for dinner at Smoque last night. We got so lucky that the line was not insanely long when we got there. (By the time we left, the line was out the door with 20 people outside.) I had the baby backs with beans, slaw, and fires. My friends had the half and half plate, the beef, and the pulled pork. We ate like kings! Smoque is definitely the best ribs I have had in a long time (possibly ever)."
"had a catering order.  we got about half the menu.  pickup was right on time.  everybody who ate said ""good choice, where's this from?""  so there you go.  fat and happy."
"The problem with Chicago is no one can do BBQ and this place has no exception. Cold, dry, chopped pork. The sauce is a mix of a typical BBQ sauce/paste with some vinegar, which is just enough to drive this city wild with excitement calling it revolutionary. Do yourself a favor and buy a plane ticket with the money it would cost you to purchase a sandwich here and fly to any place in the south and figure out what real BBQ really is before ranting and raving. This place isn't diverse or anything special, it's truly just a cash crop for the owners and has quite the poorest wait staff I have ever experienced, it seems a bit useless to even have waiters if you have to get your own food."
"Absolutely delicious. The mac n cheese was pretty good, and the brisket was the best I've had in the midwest. Even though the line can seem long, they are very efficient, and the owner walks around a lot to check in on patrons. I've been here twice and been happy both times"
"I have quite a few friends down in Texas, and they always judge their BBQ by the brisket.  When they come to Chicago, this is where I recommend they go as it's the best in the city."
"This place is always busy! And no wonder, it is worth wating in line for this place. The first time I was there, instead of going for the usual ribs, I decided to sample their brisket. Huge fan of brisket. The first time I had it  I had the sliced brisket sandwich. It tasted so delicious! Loved the BBQ sauce on the side with it. The next time I went I had the chopped brisket. Just as good as the sliced. This place is definitely worth the wait in line. It's pretty small, but was able to find a place to sit the times that I was there.  Definitely will be back for more!"
awesome.
"Texas transplant here always on the lookout for BBQ - and this place completely delivers! The brisket and pork are EXCELLENT. And they got the sauce right - not overly sweet. The sides are amazing - mac&cheese is awesome, and well as the beans. AND the best peach cobbler I've had outside of Texas! My only minor gripe is the place is a little small, and there is no table service (you order and wait for your number to be called). So, don't make this ""event"" dinning. Take out would be ideal - but definitely go - it's worth it! OH - it's BYOB  - they should put that on the website."
Yum...  Great BBQ for Chicago.
"My first time there about 2 years ago and was expecting the ""wet"" BBQ. I like my briskets saucy! that's not how Smoque serves their meal. I've been back a few more times and always get their pulled pork instead. BYOB makes it a great Friday lunch joint."
"I can't disagree with any of the great reviews about Smoque, BUT I would like to point something out. This is unquestionably one of the best BBQ spots in the Chicago land area, but only if you like a vinegar based BBQ sauce (think Virginia and/or Carolina style), so be forewarned if you are a tomato based BBQ fan. Beyond that minor detail Smoque is a ""can't miss."" I went to Smoque with a rather large group so I was lucky enough to sample almost everything on the menu! I ordered the brisket platter, which was great. I did use some of the thicker sauce intended for the ribs on it, and it made it even better. Other notables were the baked beans, and peach cobbler. While everything was very good, these two dishes were quite memorable.I would suggest giving Smoque a try without question, and be sure to remember it is BYOB."
"So finally I've managed to eat... well not at Smoque proper because there's no place on this planet I'd stand in line outdoors for.  But I phoned them on New Year's Eve and asked a lot of questions, and the gal I spoke to was unfailingly nice to me in spite of probably being ferociously busy.In the end I ordered two pounds of the pork, two of the brisket, two sausages (I thought I'd ordered three, but I could be mistaken) a quart of the beans, six cornbread and two slabs of ribs, one of each kind.  It was a little pricier than I expected it to be, but all things considered it made a damn good meal for me and my guests and it was ready when it was supposed to be, and packed very well.  As for the specifics, I'd have to say that anything I found not to my taste was probably pretty much a matter of personal preference.  For example, I don't like fatty beef and the brisket was kind of fatty.  Good flavor, but fatty.  OTOH, the pork was lean and delicious.  The ribs were very good, though neither were the fall-off-the-bone sort which I prefer.  The dry rubs were excellent, but the sauce had a lot of cumin in it and I just barely tolerate cumin.The sausages were very good and I'm not a sausage person, and the beans were extraordinary.  Also, very good cornbread.  Not sweet at all which more southern style (Northerners tend to like it a little sweet.)I was very impressed over all, and do want to try them again, though nothing I had made me want to stand in line there, particularly in sub-zero temps.  I'd like to try the chicken and have some more beans and sausage.I do see why their reputation is so good."
"This place is absolutely amazing! The ribs and the brisket sandwiches are great, as are the sides. I would pass on the chili, but always go with the mac and cheese. The peach cobbler is to die for. The best part is that the prices are really reasonable for barbecue. This place is becoming one starting to be one of my ""regular"" places to eat. The one drawback to this place is the long long lines (just b/c its so popular)"
"By the looks of it, Smoque doesn't really need another 5 star review but I'm going to give them one anyway because they deserve it.I should begin by saying that I've only been to Smoque during very off-peak hours, so I've never had to deal with the ridiculous line, however I like it there so much that I'd gladly wait for a taste of that barbecue.  Specifically, the Jew in me loves the beef brisket and the St. Louisan in me loves the pulled pork: slather both of them in sauce and I'm a happy gal.  The mac & cheese deserves a special shout-out because it is SINFUL: its perfectly creamy, but it has a good breadcrumb crunch on top.  And the peach cobbler is a great way to end the meal: I could eat it for breakfast the morning after!  Smoque, you might not see me for a little while because I've been a fat bastard lately; its a new year so I plan on abstaining from red meat and artery-clogging fare in general.  But I'll be back once I fall off that band-wagon (and you KNOW I will)."
"Best BBQ i've had in a long time, definitely within Chicago. I think we had everything on the menu last night:- St. Louis ribs:  a good amount of fat, very smoky but I'd probably go for the baby backs next time;  bbq sauce is sweet and has a good amount of sour/tang.- Brisket- Pulled pork- Texas sausage- Sides: cornbread, baked mac n' cheese, mayo-less cole slaw, french fries, peach cobbler, brisket chili, beans - the sides were almost my favorite part of the meal; definitely get the cobbler, which is probably the best I've ever had, and I believe it was even made with canned peaches.Our party trickled in ~7pm on a Friday night and this place was just beginning to get completely packed, the line running out the door.  Staff is as friendly as can be, and helps to facilitate the line and counter to table self-serve and seating.  Open view into the kitchen shows this place is spotless and a tightly run unit.  Gotta love this place."
"First time my Hubby and I went to Chi-town and He insisted we head to Smoque after watching that feature on TripleD. I am SO glad we went... We took the blue line all the way to Irving Park. HANDS DOWN... Best BBQ ever!!!!! What we ordered: St. Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, Coleslaw (came with ribs), fries, Mac&Cheese, Beans, and corn bread!!! St. Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs - BEST EVER! Seriously! My Hubby liked the BB's and I favored the St. L's. Sauce is AMAZING! I literally died it was so good. Coleslaw - so good and I actually felt healthy eating it. YUMMER! Mac&Cheese - I am sort of a M&C connoisseur and Smoque has the BEST BEST BEST EVER. I want to cry thinking that I have to come all the way back the Chi-town to get this heavenly experience. Beans- Hubby LOVED these.... He said they were the BEST he has had! Fries - Reminded me of FIVE GUYS... so delish! Cornbread - Perfect COMBO to top off the lovely meal with just a tiny hint of sweetness! LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.... Chicago, I'll definitely be back:) Thank you SMOQUE for being so perfect! P.S. It's BYOB, wish I knew that before I came!"
"Definitely one of the best in town.  I like every menu item on here especially the Brisket.   Never has been dry - just the right combination of lean/fat,.    Line seems longer than it really is.  To go is an easy process.   Can't go wrong with any of the sides either."
"Like everyone else, I love Smoque.  It was so delicious, and I have been wanting to go here since they opened!I loved the brisket - my bf had the pulled pork.  He couldn't even speak when we were eating - he couldn't put that sandwich down!The Mac and Cheese was creamy and yummy, and the topping on the peach cobbler was to die for."
"Yummo is what I said in my quick tip and yummo is what I ended up getting. This place is always busy and I think it is the best BBQ in Chicago and up there with any Texas BBQ place. You get in line, order at the counter and then they call your number when your food is ready all the while trying to make sure you get seated as well. The people are friendly and the food is great. On this particular occasion I had the Baby Back ribs and they were outstanding. All of the sides are great as is the brisket. So if you are in the neighborhood give it a try!"
"We tried three different types of BBQ sauce with our brisket and pulled pork. It's soooooooo good. I can see why this place is one of the best BBQ places in the country.The mac and cheese is the best since it is baked! Their coleslaw is good, not the mayo drenched goopey mess but fresh and vinegary. You don't go here for the atmosphere and you might have to wait around a bit for a table but it's all worth it."
"Oh Smoque how I'm so glad I found you.Great BBQ, fair prices, my go to place for comfort food.Surprisingly I actually tried this place catered the first time around. I was blown away that catered food could be this moist and delicious. I'm a HUGE cheese lover, thus I always go for the mac and cheese and almost any BBQ joint. It's sad how my first experience with Smoque included a TRAY of mac and cheese. Sadly when I went to dine in I only got a small tin and ended up ordering 2. Get the St. Louis ribs, mac and cheese, and a side of pulled pork or brisket. You cannot go wrong."
"Good BBQ, good sides, good pricing!"
"BBQ- Delicious, the meat just tastes cared for.Fixins- Fantastic, excellent portion size, let us not forget the meat is the prize!Location- This is where the fifth star falls, it's hard to get to unless you have a car, and even then-parking is unpredictable.  BYOB, laid back atmosphere, good eats!"
"Best BBQ in Chicago...and realy one of the best in the country.  I have been to BBQ joints throughout the U.S. (St. L, KC, Texas, and more) and this ranks up there with the best of them.  Their brisket is incredible, memphis-style BBQ sauces are great, and the sides are tops too.  I reccomend for sides the Mac & cheese and french fries as two of the best.  Always be prepared to wait as the lines are always very long for this great BBQ.  You wait in line to order and get a table shortly after ordering and then the food is ready not long after that- the wait is the wait to order which they space out nicely."
"My recent craving for everything BBQ led us to Smoque on our recent visit to Chicago. The tiny corner shop had a line out the door when we arrived, which moved fast, but was just long enough for us to have a contentious debate about what combination of ribs/brisket/pork and sides to order. If only they offered an ""everything"" sampler! We settled on the baby back ribs (the St. Louis ribs weren't available that night) with BBQ beans and mac and cheese for the sides, and added the sampler portion of the sliced brisket. Even though it seemed every inch of the place was full, we were led to an empty section of the table immediately after ordering. We had our food within minutes and our first taste of the extra smoky BBQ beans had us wishing we could get a bucket of them.  Not that we would have had room with the substantial portion of ribs, brisket and the thick and creamy mac and cheese with a generous topping of crunchy crumbs. Even though I ate more than I should have, I kept sneaking a peak at the tiny side of individually baked peach cobbler on the tray next to me wishing I could just sneak a taste. Next time we're in Chicago, it would definitely be worth going back."
"Update: We went again this past Sunday night at 7:45pm, knowing that they closed at 9pm. We arrived and there was a line about 15 people long out the door. The staff there is great though; they keep things organized and the line moving.Warning: if you go near closing time, just know that they do run out of many popular items. ""Sorry folks, we are out of Chicken"" was posted when we arrived. By the time we ordered, they had run out of sliced brisket and only had chopped brisket available. Also, out of Peach Cobbler too. I wiped my tears away and ordered up some delicious cornbread instead.We live nearby, so grabbed our order to go to avoid sitting in other people's laps.Took about 45 minutes to order and get our food, but definitely worth the wait (and weight...gained...after eating another hefty/affordable meal)."
Great food. Ok service. Would go back
Fantastic pulled pork sandwich!  Cool atmosphere with super friendly staff.  You'll get a large portion of delicious BBQ for a reasonable price.  My only complaint is that their cornbread tasted exactly like it was made from an 89 cent box of Jiffy cornbread mix....boring!
"4.5 stars.Prior to eating at Smoque, I simply believed that one could not get great BBQ on the North Side of Chicago. Now there are a whole slew of bbq joints, but Smoque takes the cake.Pulled Pork: perfect mix of crisp, chewy bark and tender meat.Brisket: fuckable. The brisket is fuckable.Mac n' cheese: Crisp top, gooey inside, strong cheese, not overcooked pasta. Awesome.Slaw: God I love that there is a place in Chicago that doesn't ruin its slaw with the world's worst condiment. Also, it's healthy! (not that anything else here is, but you don't go to Smoque to please your Weight Watchers guru).BBQ beans: So. damn. tasty. Bits of brisket in the beans, enough onions and spices to offset the delicious sweetness. Did I mention that there is chopped brisket in the beans?Brisket chili: A special that I've had the last two times here- hopefully it will become a permanent menu fixture. Personally I prefer pinto beans to the large kidney beans that populate this chili, but the brisket is so good you kind of forget that you are eating chili and not just foraging for meat gold.Fries: The reason I give this place a 4.5 and not 5. Okay, they're pretty good fries, but if you're gonna go to the trouble of eating one of the most unhealthy things on the planet, why not season it up a bit? I like that there are places popping like Edzo's Burger Shack that doll up the fries. But maybe it's just that I don't really see the point in plain fries...Sauces: The house BBQ sauce is thin, sweet and vinegary: It's not a North Carolina style sauce, but more similar to that then what you'll find in a bottle of Baby Ray's.-The other sauce (is it called Memphis?) is what I usually go for. This is what uppity food connoisseurs hate, and what most midwesterners love: A sauce that is thick, sweet, and full of deep, peppery flavors. People say that this stuff masks the BBQ, but I would beg to differ: Is it not possible that creating the perfect BBQ sauce to complement your meat is just as high an art as creating a good piece of BBQ-ed meat? All I know is that when I lather my brisket in this stuff, I taste both the meat and the sauce, and it is a match made in heaven.Line: I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes and usually go at prime dinner hours.Dining area: It is what it is- this is a BBQ joint, you pay BBQ prices, picnic tables are okay by me. And the BYOB is nice."
"Absolutely the best BBQ joint in Chicago!! Hands down. Friendly service. Expect a wait most times you go, because people consistently crave this joint. I wish like hell that the owner would open up another joint in trendy Bucktown. :) Ribs, Brisket, Beans, sides, everything is top notch. Geez my mouth is watering just typing this."
"Best brisket in town. But I have to say, DO NOT MISS THE CHICKEN!. Every person I take here I insist we order it and everyone thanks me for it later. The only quiblle I have is that it seems, for whatever reason, that the quality isn't always as good for take away. it seems they put the lesser parts of the brisket in the to go orders. Maybe it is just bad luck but the only bad meals I have had from there were carry out."
Best Brisket imaginable.  The only thing that keeps the rating down is the size of the place.  The wait can be overwhelming as it's really small.  Superb food.  I have yet to have anything bad on the menu.
"I must've been grumpy when I wrote my original review for this place....Today for lunch I was in such a good mood.... (calling ahead helps too)My half-slab of lightly sauced st. louis ribs, with a side of fries, and mac and cheese just elevated my spirit into a new conciousness, that i overlooked everything else...Barq's root beer complimented the ensemble perfectly.Phone lady wasn't super nice when i called, but ikilled her with kindness.The elder lady inside was extraordinarily nice, and held a conversation with moi and mother for a while....i was so pleased with this experience that i have to give it 5 stars..sorry for my grumpiness in a previous review, smoque... forgive me.... i love you. :)"
"FREAKING AMAZING!Brisket: tender, fall off the bone and full of flavor.The Sauces: brisket comes with a sauce, ask for rib sauce also.  Both are out of this world and have a unique sweetness/hickory flavor unlike any other sauce I've tried.Mac and Cheese: GET IT.  That's all I can say.Peach Cobbler:  Dessert heaven.  If you even like peach cobler a little bit, you will go nuts over this one.Even the fries are pretty special!  Real potatoes. Simple and tasty.I can't wait to go back and try more.  I'm sure its all good.  After years of using yelp to help me in my daily decision-making process, Smoque BBQ has single-handedly given me reason to create my own yelp account so I could review it. The verdict: GO NOW! Expect to wait in a long line (ours took about an hour...no exaggeration.  We were hot and grumpy as hell but once we had the food...everything was right with the world.)  I think you can order ahead of time for carry out and skip the line completely.  The prices are VERY reasonable because you get a lot of food for the money. we spent about 25 dollars for both of our brisket meals plus 3 or 4 sides each PLUS dessert and a soda. It was insane.  The place gets pretty packed so you end up in tight quarters with other diners, but its ok cause you're all sharing in the same mind blowing food experience.  I think the guy sitting next to us summed it up best when he said:""This is so good...I've never been so annoyed to have to breathe.""right on!"
"Best Brisket in the Midwest, good sides can get crazy crowded. Very knowledgeable staff, they did their homework and it shows off in there BBQ. One one the pillars of the new wave of great Chicago Q"
"I had heard great things and been wanting to try this place for some time... So glad I did! We went just a few days ago on 3/25/11 and had a wonderful experience. The place was packed, but they have a great form of organization down. The young woman at the register was super friendly and helpful with us first-timers. I chose the sliced brisket, and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Best brisket I'd ever had. The coleslaw comes with pretty much everything, and it's good. I liked the baked beans, but they weren't the best I'd ever had. But let me tell you, the macaroni and cheese is the way to go! My boyfriend had the St. Louis style ribs, and they were amazing, too - he loved them. He also enjoyed the corn bread. I feel like you can't really go wrong at Smoque! I can't wait to go back, and I'd like to introduce some out-of-towners to the place sometime. The place is in a very unassuming location, which I like. FYI -- there is a parking lot behind the building for restaurant diners. Always nice!"
"we got them for lunch once, delivered, solid place, but hard to get to"
"smoque = awesomeness!i had the pleasure of dining here and ordering a few different items from the menu - the staff was courteous and delightful even with all my annoying questions. the sausages was tasty, snappy and smoked to perfection - the ribs had a great rub on them that i didn't even have to bother with any sauce but of course, i had to tast each of the sauces (just in case) i recommend this place to everyone!!"
"Ok I give in. Returned for a third try. The baby back and the St. Louie ribs are pretty tender and tasty.  The brisket is still by far the winner. The sides still need a little work but the again i don't go to ribs joints for the sides.Even though I would like to take a star or two off for the crappy seating arrangement, I still love the food."
"Service: GoodAtmosphere: CasualFood: ExcellentPrice: ReasonableI heard of this place on Diners, Drive in and Dives! on The Food Network. Cornbread was dry, Mac and Cheese-awesome! St Louis Ribs were the best I ever had! Coleslaw was average! I'm not a fan of vinegar type BBQ sauces so I'll leave the evaluation of the sauce to a vinegar based enthusiast. I'd go back and will recommend it to friends!Rick"
"Had a pulled pork sandwich here with my friend. The atmosphere was kind of loud and uncomfortable (bad acoustics + crazy noise) and they tried to seat us at a long table knocking elbows with a screaming kid (no thanks). We sat off to the side somewhere else. The food itself was pretty good, but I think we crammed ourselves too full and got nauseous. The bread they put the sandwich on wasn't really my favorite (I shouldn't be eating bread anyway but couldn't resist), it was like a dinner roll or something.Pulled pork itself was fine, but the sauce? Weird, thin, and way too tomato-based which I guess is ""another kind of bbq"" as opposed to what I'm used to (I don't pay enough attention to the bbq Nazi shows on Food Network where people argue about what's ""right"" about bbq sauce). Cole slaw wasn't bad. I would go here again and give it another shot."
"Smoque made me change the way I think about BBQ and I thought I knew it all.  It goes down something like this:First, the type of meat is matched with a particular wood that compliments it (just like how certain wines are paired with different proteins).  Then, the smoking technique comes in, which they have down to a science.  Finally, a particular sauce is dressed onto the meat (memphis style for ribs, carolina for pulled pork, etc.).And I thought it was ALL the sauce.  I'm wrong and I happily admit it.So I've been coming since it opened and have NEVER had a bad experience.  Service is quite speedy, despite the long lines, friendly; and the sweet tea (yes, sweet tea), mac n' cheese (just the right amount of sharpness), fries (crispy and not oily) and peach cobbler (sweet/tart) is incredible.  Even the cole slaw has merits all it's own (mostly vinegar with some sweetness and mustard seed for an additional note).I love their BBQ so much it was catered for my 40th birthday party and everyone raved about it.Of all my Chicago BBQ experiences (Fat Willy's, Honey 1, Smokin' Woody's, Smokey Bear's, Gale Street Inn), I would say don't waste your time going anywhere else."
"Prior to visiting Smoque, I had only one recommendation in terms of where to go for great ribs.  (I-57 on Halsted)  That was until I made the trek and visited Smoque.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised.  The ribs were meaty and delish.  The sides were fantastic.  Although there was a long line, the seating process was rather efficient.  Overall, I was reallly happy.  This is DEFINITELY a place to try."
"i stumbled on to this again--it has 800 reviews--this is one of the greatest BBQ spots in the country, plus it has great sides.  Anyone who considers this less than one of the greatest places ever does not know what they are talking about"
"MMmmmmm...now that's some barbeque!Great meats - I've tried the ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.Terrific sauces - -- thicker, sweeter with the ribs -- thin, vinegar-based with a slight kick with the brisketLove the sides - could the mac n' cheese be more creamy?Save room (or MAKE ROOM) and splurge on the cobbler!Aways a wait, and you stand in line, but go with some friends and just take it in as part of the experience. Plus you get to eye all the various meals getting served and at nearby tables, which just serves to increase your appetite and prepare you for the large portions.Not too pricey, and worth every penny. The only downside is that, in my experiences, it's always busy and as you start to finish eating it is easy to feel rushed to leave.Definitely worth checking out."
"Absolutely amazing - took my crew from work for dinner Wednesday night.  Was hesitant as first due to some recent below than average ratings.Boy - one of the best eating experiences.  Amazing food, great service, and just all around awesome.  Wish they had a Smoque in Dallas!"
"Excellent barbeque, cornbread is delish, as well as the mac & cheese.  Downside is the place is tiny so space is tight!"
"So you have to know that today I started my eating with bacon. Just wanted to say that.I have heard of this place a lot, and especially lately the idea of BBQ was just exciting. After spending the day tooling around I was hungry. And I was given this among 4 places.I'm babbling. Took the Blue Line. Walked down the back stairs. From the smell of piss and CTA, you get a whiff of the BBQ from nearly two blocks away. I was excited.We walked the two blocks and took our place in queue like good boys and girl. The line was out the door, but what I quickly realized is most people do take-away. We stood. And waited. Around the corner you see the simple menu. By the time you get to cash register, you should know.We placed our order. Someone asks you if you're staying or going. He'll point you to your table (family style so be warned). We got our 12oz cups at the all-you-can-drink dispenser and patiently waited for our order to come out.At the table, we got a bit of all animals to enjoy: the half-chicken, the brisket and the ribs with a side of sausage. The sides were mac 'n' cheese, fries and beans. We all got the complimentary slaw and a side bucket-sito of the sauce.When our number was called, we marveled at the aluminum trays. And everything was amazing! My wife had the chicken and she actually ate the skin... Which she NEVER does. I had the brisket and it was so tender. And the ribs were not fall-off-the-bone but they were amazingly delicious. The mac 'n' cheese were as everyone says simply divine. No complaints here.The bit is: if you order a human-sized portion you don't walk out of there waddling. It's the right amount of food. The BBQ sauce isn't that thick Kansas City stuff either. It's definitely on the tangy side and a bit sweet. And those beans. MMMMMMFFFF! So good!This place is BYO and folks live it up, most bringing a six-pack of what I believe is beer. That would've rounded this meal off perfectly. Parking's a PITA so be warned. If you have access to the Blue Line I would do that instead."
"With almost 2,000 reviews, it all seems redundant, but I had to comment. Barry & Co. did a stand-up job preparing me a special order of chicken and ribs (which I ate in house) without any seasoning or sauce because I have food allergies to some of the ingredients. Even without spicey saucy glory, the ribs were super tasty and smokey, chicken juicy and equally smokey. Extra adverbs = extra delish. They went out of their way for me, and we were incredibly grateful! Thanks again, guys!"
"Okay... I've been converted!  I used to not be a Smoque BBQ fan... I didn't want to fall into the hype, but I must admit the corn bread and mac and cheese is great.I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich combo this time, I'm not so much a fan of the brisket, but the pulled pork was so GOOD, fall off the bone, savory, and juicy.  I don't know why the brisket doesn't do it for me, but if I had to guess, I think that it has to do something with their sauce, I am a fan of a sweeter sauce and their sauce is tangy and spicy.... I don't know...I'd still eat here because like I said before the pulled pork and mac and cheese are heaven!"
"Just got back from here.  That line was out the door and more.  I almost hit some people on Pulaski.  I tried a 1/2 pulled pork + 1/2 brisket + 1/4 slab of ribs + cornbread + other people's fries.  Glorious food.  The doctors have confirmed that I am currently in a food coma.  As my friend said, halfway through the meal, ""The storm is coming.I feel like Cassandra warning of the fall of troy.  Heed my warning.""  I shall now heed."
"Four of us split: pulled pork, brisket, 1/2 rack  of baby back ribs, and a 1/2 rack of STL cut ribs.The baby backs and the pulled  pork were as good as advertised...but the stars of the ball..were the brisket and the STL ribs.The brisket was probably the best I have had out of Texas...but not the best of the meal.For those who do not know..the STL  (Saint Louis) is a squared spare rib cut.  It makes a uniform cut..but it was what the pitmasters @ Smoque did to that was crazy good. Of the 3 who normally favored -- baby back ribs...we all admitted that the STL cut..was the best pork rib we had tasted in our 35-40 years.  It  was as close as one could achieve to bacon..in BBQ. We had to order an extra rack to satisfy everyone when a 1/2 slab was adequate for one.Sides:Mac and  Cheese was cheesy and excellent. BBQ beans were very adequate.Cole Slaw and Fries were the weak components of a 5 star meal.I would have been blown away by the pulled pork and baby backs..but so glad we chose to pull ourselves out of our element."
"We were wandering around in the snow looking for a new place to eat since we moved to the Old Irving Park hood in the fall. We had actually walked into Smoque before, but the lack o' vegetarian options made us walk out. (Yeah, I know BBQ place...meat, I get it)I did have a craving for Mac N Cheese and the non veggie fiance wanted to try the brisket, so we stopped by and grabbed some food to go.The service was fast, and most of the food was warm by the time we got home. (The fry bag was open so our taters got a bit chilled). That being said, the fries were still awesome, the brisket I am told was tender and delicious. The mac was good and the beans were delicious... though strict veggies beware a meat chunk did live in the beans. I also indulged in some corn bread which had corn in it and was not your typical dry cornbread. And I'm not big on slaw, but the fiance really dug that it wasn't made with mayo. I do wish that Smoque would throw on a portabello on the grill or something, but I have no problem with making a meal of sides here."
"I'm passionate about meat, and I appreciate places that have that same passion. This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago, and for my money it's the best barbeque in Chicago.First thing you notice when you go in is the smell. I almost already know if a place is going to be good by the smell. The place is permeated with the sweet aroma of barbeque.Must HaveBrisket. Sliced. Not chopped, b/c sliced is the fattier cut.St. Louis-style ribs. Dry rub, meatier than the baby-backs, $1 cheaper.BBQ Beans. Smoked, with bits of brisket and onion in them. The best beans I've had...pretty much anywhere.Pulled Pork. The first time I went I was disappointed, but I must have been expecting something other worldly because on repeat visits, I've come to appreciate the tender delicateness of the pork.Make sure you get the vinegar-based bbq sauce for the brisket and the ketchup-base bbq sauce for the ribs. They should give it to you without asking, but last time I was there they forgot one.SolidFrench Fries. Fresh-cut, crisp, well-seasoned fries. They give you so much, though, that it can detract from the meat. Recommend share one with someone else.Cole-slaw. Vinegar based. Cleanses the palate decently, and is so straightforward, doesn't try to pretend to be something fancy.Mac'n Cheese. Great taste, though it's a really small portion. (I'm clearly not refined in my mac'n cheese taste buds)WhateverSmoked sausage. Genuinely disappointed. They taste like they could've come from the grocery store.Haven't triedBaby-Back ribs. Seriously, why would I get baby backs when I can get one-of-a-kind (in Chicago of course) beautiful dry rubs?Brisket Chilli.Peach cobbler. Looks like a small portion, but I've heard good things about it.Anything else not listedRecommended meal(s) Listed in order of hunger and descending price (I think)Brisket Platter with a taste of St. Louis ribs. Sides: BBQ Beans and fries (to be shared with someone else).Brisket Sandwich with a taste of St. Louis ribs. Side: BBQ BeansFor an emphasis on the ribs, switch the St. Louis ribs and the brisket (you get a half slab of ribs with a taste of brisket, etc). Yeah, this list is shorter than I thought it'd be. :DGo early if you can, later if you can stand the wait, late if you can stand them running out of meat. Let me know how your experiences have been/your recommendations!"
"Awesome BBQ, definitely worth the wait! Always pretty crowded yet the service is great! Love having places like this in the neighbrhood! :)"
"I am a vegetarian, and Smoque is one of my favorite restaurants. The mac and cheese, salad with grilled tomatoes, and peach cobbler are phenomenal. Seriously, meat-lovers need not feel guilty about taking vegetarian friends here; all will be pleasantly surprised."
"The Baby Back ribs are incredible! And that chopped brisket sandwich was the sh#t! None of the sides disappointed, I think it is BYOB so next time I am bringing a Scrimshaw Pilsner with me. And the people were so nice and seem to really feel how the customer's where enjoying the BBQ. Awesome place and I can't recommend it enough for rub they use on those baby back ribs."
"I'm no BBQ connoisseur, but dang, I could easily tell that is some pretty awesome BBQ. Easily the best I ever had. We went on a Friday night around 7pm. There was a decent line out the door and it moved relatively fast. About a 20 minute wait in total. Completely worth it for the awesomeness ahead. If you want the line to seem faster, bring some drinks with you. Its a BYOB which makes the awesomeness ahead even better! We tried a bit of everything. The pulled pork platter, the 1/2 chicken platter, mac and cheese, peach cobbler, baked beans and a small tasting of the brisket. We came away with amazing tastes and very full bellies. To me, the highlights were the pulled pork and brisket. So delicate and so amazing. Accompanied sauces were amazing the sides were very good. My only complaint of Smoque is that I wish it was bigger! Tasting such awesomeness with shorter lines would probably equal weight gain across the city."
"Not that Smoque needs ANOTHER review...but alas here I am. I suggested going here for lunch with my boyfriend and I got major points for the suggestion!!!We went at 3pm on a Saturday in the pouring rain and the line was still out the door. If that doesn't speak volumes for their food I don't know what would. (tip- they have Smoque umbrellas inside for the diehards willing to wait in the rain)As far as food, I had only ever had the ribs which are delish. My bf ordered the beef brisket and let me say...I was converted. I can't wait to go back and order my own!!Great place!"
"I have ordered from Smoque since they opened several years ago.  At first, I loved the Mac 'N' Cheese it was great.   Lately, it has been kind of bland, same with the Peach Cobbler. The brisket is still top notch and so is the pulled pork.  I wish Smoque would step up the game with the Mac 'N' Cheese and offer larger portions for sale"
"Being a bbq fiend and a certified bbq judge, I had to seek out some barbeque during my Chicago trip.  Due to my limited time frame, I was only able to hit up one spot and I decided on Smoque after a good bit of research.  I got up early for the sole purpose of hitting up Smoque even though it was way out of the way (I used 3 modes of transportation to get there - very rare for an Atlantan). I managed to arrive a little bit after they opened and beat the crowds.  Due to a lack of breakfast, an intense desire to sample everything on the menu, and that sense of abandon you sometimes feel on vacation, I ended up with an absolutely obscene smorgasbord of food sitting in front of me (check the pics).  Despite the grueling task facing me, I totally devoured all of it like a boss.  The Meat:-  1/2 rack of baby back ribs - These were pretty good - maybe B+/A-.  They had a nice smokiness and bark to them.  The texture was solid (not extremely tough or ""falling off the bone""), but they could have been a little more tender. Overall, they were tasty, but could've been a little better.  However, they were my favorite of the three meats I sampled.  - pulled pork - The pork was decent - a B-.  It was nicely-pulled, had a nice bit of smoke and was tender.  However, it was probably cooked a little too long as some parts were borderline mushy.  It also seemed to be a little underseasoned too me.  It was also served with the sauce already on - which is a no-no (good meat should be able to stand on its own).   - brisket - This was fairly good - a solid B.  The flavor was pretty good on the brisket, but it had what I've found to be a common problem with brisket - dryness.  The brisket was a bit on the dry side.  It was also served with the sauce already on which in nearly all circumstance I don't like but here it didn't really matter since it helped combat the dryness.    The Other Stuff:- sauce - Not bad, but not really memorable either.  Kinda sweet, kinda vinegary.  - mac & cheese - I love m&c that has a crumbly/crunchy top so I really liked that aspect.  The rest underneath the crust was good as well, but didn't have the smooth gooeyness that I like.  Flavor was pretty good throughout.  - fries - The bag of fries the most impressive thing I ate there.  Who would expect it, right?  But seriously, they were excellent - hot, fresh, crispy on the outside/soft in the middle, well seasoned.  I wish everyone could do fries like this.  Maybe they were just really spot on that day with them though.  Who knows.  Dare I say - maybe the best I've had in '09?- cole slaw - Kudos to them for having a non-mayo-based coleslaw (mayo sucks).  It had a lot of potential to be really good, but it was so sour/tart that I couldn't eat much of it.  Lessen the acidity (lemon juice maybe?) and it'd be solid.  - peach cobbler - I didn't get a picture since I ordered it to-go afterwards and ate it later, but there is a pic of it already up.  Anyway, it was very good though a bit non-traditional for a cobbler (crumble top, somewhat heavily spiced).  - sweet tea - It was ok - better than I would expect for a Midwestern joint.Non-food Impressions- The staff seemed top-notch: competent, friendly, & helpful. - The restaurant is certainly nice enough for a bbq joint.  I like the large menu on the wall.  - The layout of the restaurant seems problematic though.  The arrangement of the line, the drinks, the food pickup, and the layout of the tables seems poor.  You have to go all over the place and through lots of people if it's crowded.  There's no logic or flow to it.  I didn't have the problem since there was hardly anyone there when I went, but I'd bet it's pretty chaotic when there's actually a bit of a crowd.  However, I realize that they might be doing the best they can with the space they have to work with so, if that's true, you can't fault them too much.   Overall, Smoque was pretty tasty and serves up some good bbq.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's the best bbq that Chicago has to offer.  It's better than quite a few places in the A even.  Anyway, hitting up Smoque was definitely an adventure - and a satisfying one at that.  Smoke meat everyday.4[Ed. This was not intended to be an exercise in reading comprehension.  If you made it through, well, o/\o]"
"Let me tell you, being from Texas I have very high expectations when it comes to good BBQ because I grew up on the best...Smoque did not disappoint. Never mind the fact that I had to wait in a long line out the door @ 4:00p.m. in the afternoon, and then 20 minutes later I'm at the front giving my order, the smell was enough to make me unconscious. There's not better aroma than that of good BBQ. I got the BBQ brisket, sausage, coleslaw, BB baked beans, and a roll in a timely fashion and it was delicious. The only thing else I could've asked for was fried okra. #nomnomnomThe portions were Texas-sized. The meat was tender, juicy, and smoked to perfection and the BBQ sauce was just the right amount of smoky and sweet. And for dessert, I had peach cobbler. It was the best peach cobbler I have ever had. The peaches were warm and juicy. The crust was crispy, yet moist and sweet. It was fairly priced, but the size of the joint and the location are not very accommodating. They ought to consider expanding, if they remain that busy. Two Texas Thumbs up for Smoque..."
"Amazing BBQ!The place gets crowded, so plan to wait a bit, but it's well worth it!  I hear it's BYOB as well, which only makes it better."
Great BBQ. Best in Chicago and closest to Kansas City
"Ribs = greasy (not the good greasy like most ribs, there was lots of fat on these baby backs)Briskey = pretty goodpulled pork = left more to desirepeach cobbler = tastes like canned peachesmac and cheese = yummyslaw = decentNot worth the hype.  Good if you're near, not worth more than a 5 minute trip"
Smoque was recommended to me by a friend and I am VERY happy that I went.  I went with the full slab of St. Louis and they literally fell off the bone.  They are very proud of their BBQ sauce and I can see why.  I also had a side of Mac n Cheese and that blew me away.  I absolutely love cheese and love to try Mac n Cheese wherever I go.  The only downside to the mac n cheese was the tiny portion.All around great place to get your BBQ fix.
"Gf and I split the full rack of st louis, a taste of the chopped beef brisket, peach cobbler, fries!  It was outstanding.  The line and crowded eating area was an indicator that it must be good.  The staff was outstanding and the food was excellent!  The ribs were fall off the bone, full of flavor, but not over powering.  The fries tasted like they actually used a real potato that day instead of the fake fast food or applebees type fries.  Highly recommended for under 30 bucks it was a great meal and great experience."
"Soooo, a group of friends decided to celebrate a birthday here on a Saturday night.  Not the best idea since that is when this place is most busy!  We arrived to find a line outside of Smoque and half way down the block!  Good sign since that means it's loved; bad sign since we have to wait in that line.Thankfully the guest of honor (Hi, Nickolas!) was 45 minutes late so by the time we got to the front, they arrived.  If you are carrying out, no worries: you place your order and leave.  If you dine in, however, it's a bit complicated.  You basically wait for your seat and when you have a seat they then put in your order and food arrives in about 15 minutes time.  With a group of 10 in a place that seats 50 (max) and has a continual line of people, that is when it gets tricky.  But the workers were great and seated us as quickly as possible.Now to the good stuff: the food!!!  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was amazing!  I also tried the brisket which was pretty good (not a big brisket fan).  Friends ordered the ribs and FYI, there is really no difference between the St. Louis and Baby back (from what they could tell).  The sides I tried were:1) Mac & Cheese - This is not like the mac & cheese I am used to.  It's different.  Too different.  I am not a fan.2) Baked Beans - Good stuff if you like baked beans.3) Corn Bread - Yummy for my tummy!  This was my favorite especially since it is done correctly.  It's sweet, just like me! :)4) Peach Cobbler Pie - I thought it was great.  It has oatmeal on top which gives it a yummy crunch.  If that's not your style you won't like this (but I loved it!)Smoque is definitely the standard for bbq in Chicago!"
"Really- I have been to damned near every BBQ joint in the city, as it is the BF's quest. I have my own opinions, but have become willingly educated in the ways of BBQ. And this is it, really. You may as well stop your quest here.Chicago Q's Kobe/Wagyu beef brisket *is* better, but it's from a cow that was massaged with baby oil and fed beer and cornpops or some such. For your non-gold-coast BBQ?This is it."
"I would like to give 4.5 to 5 stars. The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 star is I need to come back and try more other foods here. It was my first time here. 5:00pm on Sunnday afternoon. We arrived at a perfect time since after we sat down and started eating, the line waiting for order had grown to about 15-person long. I had Sliced brisket and ribs. The meat was tender, juicy and beautifully smoked  The sauce was tasty. The most important thing is that the BBQ food was NOT COLD here, which made big difference from another 2 American style BBQ places I went to during last month.  But the sweet tea was a lit too sweet to me. Good service. Food came fast. Friendly and helpful staff.Definitely will be back to  try other menu items,"
"Get it all DAMN IT. JUST GET IT ALL. my favorite is the St Louis ribs. Although the Mac and cheese is creamy and cheese. Don't forget the peach cobbler, ahhhhhhhhhhhhh the peach cobbler. I like to add some brandy to mine just because I can. The sauce is great just the right tang. Great staff, fast service and awesome owners. It's always nice when the owners or managers of a restaurants take time out to just simply say hi. Love this place. Keep it up!!!!!!!!"
"This place is not for people who want fancy dining. If you want good BBQ, you need to go to Smoque's.  I was lucky to find a time that it wasn't extremely busy. So I was able to order and eat pretty quickly. The brisket is amazing and cornbread is right on point."
"Good 'ol Southern Cookin! Very popular place and for good reason. Great bbq sauce and very tender meat. Menu is short and sweet, but you can't go wrong! Ribs are my favorite! The cornbread, macaroni and cheese, and peach cobbler are the best sides. Cole slaw is vinegar based and the beans are...well, beans! :)  Perfect bbq place, but the food does add up money-wise!TIP: CALL AHEAD for take out. There's usually always a long line so if you call ahead you get to skip to the front of the line when you arrive to pick up (pissing everyone else off!)  Clearly not a genius idea, but you'd be surprised how many people wait in line when they could have been in and out in 5 minutes if they had just called ahead."
"I made my first trip to Smoque in the middle of a lazy Sunday afternoon.  A nice drive on a 50 some odd degree sunny day with the windows down definitely set the mood.  We found parking easily on the street just west of Pulaski.  The air on the walk over was infused with the barbecue flavor; it was then that I wished I was able to take a picture of an odor.Walking in the line was backed up to the door.  For a place so popular, I was not surprised.  I was, however, surprised at the size of the interior.  I figured for a place so popular they needed more room!  Luckily they have an employee who's seemingly only job is to coordinate seating for customers.  The line moved smoothly, the owner conversing and joking with his patrons.  Our turn to order and we dropped our $20 and were politely guided to where we were to sit.  After about 10 minutes sipping my orange Fanta, our order was up and ready to consume.  My chopped briscuit was piled high and deep on two rich pieces of bread, so I trimmed down the mountain of meat using my fork.  I felt bad when I eventually dipped the morsels in the side of BBQ sauce, because the meat tasted fantastic without it....but I craved more flavor!  The mac and cheese was just a bit too cheesy for me but what the heck, I made quick work of that as well.Overall, this establishment did an A+ job of accommodating the vast number of customers in such a confined space.  When my brother and sister-in-law come to visit from Texas, I know exactly where we are going!"
"I love BBQ. I need it. Sometimes, I wake up in the morning and I want ribs. I haven't smelled ribs, I haven't had ribs in forever, I just wake up with this gut feeling that tells me-hey, you need some damn ribs in your life. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, I need some BBQ in my belly. Maybe it's because I lived in Texas those two years of my life, I don't know.I had been meaning to try Smoque but was terrified of the long lines that I heard about. If there's one thing that I don't like, it's waiting for food when I'm hungry. I get grouchy, I get mean, I get-well, we just don't need to see me when I'm too hungry. So once upon a saturday, me and the bf woke up early to go and get BBQ. We got there around 11:45; no wait in line at all for us! I was excited! But I didn't know what to get. And there wasn't a combo platter, OH NOES. I wanted to try everything.So. I kind of did. I got a half slab of the St. Louis ribs and a side of brisket. My lovely boyfriend was so kind to get the pulled pork sandwich, so I got to try some of his as well. Everything was delicious. I don't know what brisket these other people are eating, but mine was quite tender and not dry at all. The ribs had the nice pull to them that you expect from St. Louis ribs, and I really appreciate the fact that you get different sauces for different meats. A-plus.So that was Saturday. Then Tuesday rolls around, and my boyfriend offers to pick up Smoque again for dinner. BBQ and Lost? Who can say no. This time, I got the pulled pork sandwich and a side of the sausage.We also split another half slab of St. Louis ribs. I loved the bread that it came on, I felt that it didn't soak up all of the bbq sauce and let it marinate on down into the meat. The sausage was wonderfully smokey with a hint of spice in the background. I wish it was a little spicier, but I think that's because I love hot links. I'm really only giving it four stars because I think their sides could be a little better. I enjoy the mac and cheese, but it doesn't blow me out of the water and there aren't enough vegetable options. Like, hello? I could be eating some greens with my ribs. All in all, of course I'll be back when that craving hits me. I'm sure it will be soon enough."
"I had lived in the hood three years before my dad in Wisconsin had seen this place on some Food Channel show.  I meet a friend there who was coming from downtown on the blue line (5 min walk). The menu is written on a board on the wall so you would think people would be looking while waiting in line, not always the case. I love the brisket and the sauce!! I prefer the vinegar based sauce to the super sticky BBQ sauce and this was perfect! The spices were well blended without the pepper taking over.  The slaw is also wonderful and not that mayonnaise based crap that most BBQ joints serve. Overall a great place to eat in the Irving Park hood"
"Everything is amazing here! Even the damn salad, LOL!  BBQ perfected."
Great place for take-out!
"You come here for the great BBQ, not a nice ambiance.  It doesn't get much better than this."
You walk in and wait in line. Then you order. Then you wait for a table. Then you wait for your food. It's a lot of crowded waiting. An it's all worth it. Holy snap this place is good! Hands down THE best BBQ I have ever had. No kidding. Go there. Wait in line. Then thank me.
"Why can't Smoque be closer to downtown? There aren't many BBQ establishments downtown, so on a warm Friday afternoon I decided to venture North and West from downtown to find what this place had to offer. Consensus: It's amazing just as everyone before me has already stated. The meat was so amazingly tender. Cole slaw which I generally despise (ew mayo and cabbage?) was very very good as they use a vinaigrette. Fries? Awesome. Mac N Cheese? Just as you would expect.If you're driving definitely park on Pulaski because there aren't too many other options.Why oh why are you not closer to downtown?"
"This place is about 3/4 of a mile away from my condo and I am so glad it is.  I am a repeat customer as the food here is fantastic.  Everything I've had has always been excellent, but the Pulled Pork sandwich is my favorite.  A single sandwich is typically more than enough food for 1 meal, and I sometimes make 2 out of it (usually with a side order).  The peach cobbler is a great desert, but i do wish that there was a little more to the corn bread.The only real drawback in my opinion is the interior - it always feels like a mess hall to me and I wouldn't really ever consider eating on site.  The good news is that their take out service is great.  They will give you very specific times for pick up (sometimes in excess of 2 hours, so plan accordingly), and they are almost always on time with their schedule.  Its nice to walk in, skip the line (which is always to the door!), pay quickly and escape."
"At a busy time, the wait is pretty long, but the food is pretty damn good.  Love that you can get a variety of items on one platter.  Portion sizes are reasonable for the pricing."
This is a very nice treat to travel to.  I love the food and come here a couple times of year.  I have never been disappointed in a meal that I have had here.
"Love it. Peach cobbler like Grandpa made; solid Mac'n'Cheese; ribs and brisket that have demolished my ""eat less red meat"" goals on numerous occasions."
"followed Guy fieri and he is right! This place is awesome. We tried almost everything... The baby backs were perfectly done, tender meat, great sauce. I worried that ithe sauce might be to tangy but it was not... Perfect..... Pulll pork - yum... You can't really go wrong with pull pork. Texas sausage = delicious especially for all the sausage lovers! And the briskets... I didn't even know I like briskets. The sides of salads, cornbread, etc was a good way to balance out the meat..."
"Really good brisket sandwich. The meat was extremely tender and the BBQ sauce they use, though thin for my tastes, was really tasty. The brisket chilli, though also thin, was flavorful with nice big chunks of meat. Prices are reasonable as well."
"Ever have one of those places where you go and get stuck on ordering the same thing over and over again because it's so damn good?Smoque: Chopped brisket. BBQ baked beans.Holy whatever.I just thought about it and I think I got half a stock, as Pauly Shore would annoyingly say. Yeah. Blah blah blah. Everyone has written about this place. Stop reading this and just go there. Best BBQ I've had ever (I'm inexperienced, but my tongue and gut like what they like)."
"So, I learned about this place from DDD, and every time I drove by, I would see a long line of people waiting to enter the restaurant. So I was smart and ordered take-out. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac-n-cheese, and my hubby got the brisket sandwich w/a side of BBQ beans. It was good, but definitely more hyped up than anything. The meat was tender, and it comes with a side of their sauce, which we poured on to combat the dryness of both meats. The coleslaw was delicious, as was the mac-n-cheese and bbq beans. And the peach cobbler was great, too. So overall, okay, would I come here again? Honestly, unless I was starving and this place was the only thing nearby, probably not.  I just don't see myself craving this place. I have yet to try their ribs, so maybe on another rainy, boring day, I'll give them a shot again."
Love the chopped brisket
"Sweet Carolina! This is the best Carolina style BBQ I've ever eaten, better than anything I've actually had in the Carolinas or east Tennessee. In fact, when comparing some east Tennessee BBQ to this stuff I was embarrassed to tell folks there where it was done better. I think I was more surprised than anything else that this wasn't St. Louis or Kansas City BBQ.Can you go down to North Carolina and teach them a thing or two? Please?!"
"Damn that Brisket was great, I gave it an B+ :) mac and cheese good B+ :) baked beans good B+ :) corn bread was good as well. they didn't have much on their liquid  selection. I didn't care for the coleslaw :( it had way too much vinegar and onion.  I also didn't care for be set up as far as how are you order and pick up, when you dine-in. it's a very small place for the magnitude of customers, looking forward to hopefully them opening up a bigger location.  Overall yes I  give Smoque 4 $tars :) I definitely would recommend and return  myself."
"BEST BBQ IN CHICAGO.  I don't know if I need to say any more.  Everything is fantastic--meat, sauce, sides, cobbler.  I don't have a favorite dish.  I just rotate what I get each time I go.The line to eat in can be quite long.  I like to call ahead and do carry out, so I don't waste any time between when I first park the car and the delicious Smoque-y aroma hits my nose to when I get to dig in to the food.  Waiting in line with that delicious smell wafting by is torture."
"Very good BBQ, authentic St. Louis style. Loved the sides, BBQ beans and mac and cheese. I prefer the pork to the brisket (against popular opinion) but everything tastes great drenched in the sauce. I was lucky enough to go on Saturday before a rush hit. Check it out if you like BBQ.The only other things I would add to my experience is that my friend was a little surprised at the location/appearance of the place. I wasn't too shocked, especially when compared to other ""BBQ Shack"" places, but yes, we did drive past it before we noticed the little black awning that signaled we had arrived. The prices on everything seemed quite reasonable and would not say I left there hungry. The platter dishes (helping of meat with no bread) comes with two sides for $11 (incl. tax), and sandwiches (including one side) just a couple dollars cheaper. They also appear to have a robust catering organization if you needed another option for feeding the masses. If the #2 ranking on Urbanspoon for Chicago restaurants doesn't say it already, the line out the door at 2pm on a Saturday should be enough reason to check it out."
"I learned an important lesson from my trip to Smoque.  Sometimes I will not be in agreement w/ 500 people.  And that's ok.I thought Smoque had good BBQ, nothing amazing and nothing I would travel from the West Loop for in the future.  The brisket was moist and tender, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce or the overall seasoning/flavor.  I thought my sides were average.  There wasn't a single item, other than the ribs, that I would ever consider going back for... although, if I lived closer I probably would throw another star on.  The curse of Yelp."
"Score another victory for the Food Network's #1 show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. I love barbecue and Smoque does it right. We were in town for the USC/Notre Dame game and decided to break our tradition of having pizza on the first night so we could try this legendary restaurant. And it was a little bit of a tough sell because from our hotel in downtown it looked like it was half way to O'Hare. But after the first few bites the consensus was that it was worth the $20 cab ride. I went with the baby back ribs and they were the best I have ever had. I liked that they were served with the sauce on the side so you could appreciate the rub that not only flavored the meat but caramelized slightly to give the ribs a great texture. The girlfriend, J, is a brisket fan and she declared the brisket at Smoque the best she's ever had. So why 4-stars and not 5? Well for me the barbecue experience has to have great sides. The sides at Smoque are great. We had a combination of mac & cheese, beans, coleslaw and cornbread. But --and this is really nitpicky-- I didn't think the sides were as good as the sides at Baby Blues BBQ in Venice, CA, another Triple D hot spot. But if you haven't had Baby Blues then you don't know what you are missing. BTW, the peach cobbler is the best peach cobbler I have ever had and if you are a fan of almonds you will love this dessert. It's like fresh peach cobbler and a bear claw had a one night stand and this is their shameful but delicious offspring. Do not pass it up."
"After waiting an hour in line and finally getting our food, my family could not find a place to sit - even though we were asked if were dining in.  So as a last resort, we made our order to-go and drove back to my apartment in Edgewater.  We were surprised on how well the food held up, but I'm sure it could have been better if we have eaten there. Two thumbs up for bad-ass to-go containers!We ordered the ribs, and brisket and also bbq chili (a special they were running).  The melt in your mouth ribs, no-need for sauce brisket and hearty bbq chili made us forget about eating there.  It was actually better for us to get out food to-go - we would have been dreading driving back with full and sleepy bodies.  The mac and cheese we did not like so much, it was kind of bland for our tastes. It may seem a bit pricey - but you'll cave in once you read their ""Manifesto"" on BBQ. smoquebbq.com/manifesto.…"
"Over-rated.There are many better BBQ places in the city, both in terms of food and restaurant experience.  Nothing is special about this place."
"We saw this place of DDD and since we were going to a Cubs game the following week we decided to check it out.  Boy are we glad we did!!  First of all, it is very convenient, right off I94 and close to Addison so we didn't have to go out of our way.  They have  a great system of getting people through quickly.  There was a line out the door when we got there, but it moved quickly.  Now to the food.  It was fantastic.  My husband and I shared the brisket platter and added a 1/4 slab of ribs. The brisket was probably the best I have ever had.  Tender a full of flavor.  same for the Ribs, nice and smokey, tender and juicy.   There is a dry rub on both of these and they didn't need the BBQ sauce that was provided on the side.  I didn't really care for the sauce, it was a thinner Carolina sauce, but like I said the meat was so good it didn't really need the sauce.  On to the sides- every platter come with Cole slaw.  I don't even like Cole-slaw but it looked so fresh that I decided to try it, and I am glad I did.  It was excellent.  Not a creamy dressing, but a lite one with may celery seed or poppy seed. the mac n' cheese was amazing!!  creamy and full of flavor.  The BBQ beans were made with the brisket, so it was smokey and sweet.  My friend had corn bread and it was sweet and moist and had real corn in it.  So I highly recommend this place!!"
"I'm having a hard time finding an opening sentence to express how much I love this place. I'm not even a typical ""bbq"" kind of person. (No, I dont know what that means, so dont ask me.) But this....it's heaven. It really is. I have had the following things:Brisket- To. Die. For. Perfection. I've only had it in sliced form and I've been told this is the far superior style. It's smoky and saucy but not too saucy (but just saucy enough if you know what I mean). It reheats well, so dont hesitate to get some to go. Maybe a pound of two. Eat it for breakfast. Seriously.Cornbread- EXACTLY how I like it. Not dry, chunks of corn...perfect amountMac and Cheese- ditto what I said about the corn bread. Delish.Brisket Chili- everything I said about the brisket, but add gasCole slaw- not mayo-y, so not my style, but people that like a vinegar cole slaw tend to like it.I've also tasted the St Louis ribs and they were heaven as well.  About the place in general, yes, it's packed (thanks Guy Fieri!) but it's BYOB so bring something to drink while you're in line. Both times I've gone, on a Sunday night around 7ish, I waited no more than 20 minutes for a table. They've got a very efficient system going, you get your table, then shortly after that you get your food.  It's cheap (to me at least) and a good amount of food for what you pay. To sum it up...I like Smoque. Just like everyone else. But I wanted to write a review anyway. :)"
"Food: I'm from the dirty south, this bbq kicks major ass.Recommendation: Sliced beef brisket... omg, I'm hungry.Price: Not bad for BBQ.Other:  You'll be addicted.  Frequency:  If I wasn't worried about keeping slim for my upcoming wedding, I'd eat here two times a day."
"If you like BBQ food, this place is a good start."
"If I don't eat at Smoque at least three times in one week, I am not a happy girl.  Too much Smoque? No such thing. Being from the south, I was hesitant when I first heard about this supposedly amazing barbeque restaurant in Chicago. However, I regret not going to Smoque sooner and regret missing out on their delicious brisket and warm, cheesy macaroni and cheese. This place far exceeds anything I have ever found in the south! I have brought countless people in front out of town to Smoque and am always thanked for sharing such an outstanding new world of barbeque with them."
"Great stuff, long waits....Still worth hitting if your'e in the area!"
"the closest i have ever come to having an orgasm from food. This place is just that good. I have been here two times and both times ordered the bbq shredded pork sandwich. the pork is moist, delicious and they give you a side of bbq sauce so you can drown the pork in sauce as you please ( which if you are me is a lot). Sides are also delish, the last time i got the beans, perfect for eating on your sandwich,  and the mac and cheese. The beans were smokey with little nibbles of brisket mixed in. Mac and cheese was very good, but also very rich, i had to abandon ship mid way through. oh and they give you coleslaw with everything. hence the four stars and not five. cole slaw really? go here. do it. your tummy will thank you."
smoque kicks boooottyyyyyyyyyyy
"One of the best, if not the best BBQ joint in Chicago.  The restaurant is pretty bare bones, so geared more towards the true BBQ enthusiast, but the food and sauces are uncomparable.  Gosh, now my mouth is watering just from writing this post."
"We finally made it to Smoque, and it was everything we had heard it would be and more. We picked up and brought home, and everything stayed warm and delicious after the 20 minute drive. We got chicken, which was so moist and smoky, and the ribs, which were really tender, and the pulled pork, which was also moist and full of flavor. For sides we got the cornbread and the mac and cheese, which come in little metal containers that they're baked in, so everything stays really moist. The bread was full of flavor and had pieces of corn in it, and the mac and cheese had a great topping. Now, the really amazing thing about Smoque is their customer service. When we got home, we realized we had gotten sausage instead of our chicken, and the people on the phone insisted on delivering the chicken to us, AND brought us a gift certificate for our troubles. So above and beyond, and we're definitely customers for life now! Totally worth the trek to support such a great establishment. Thanks, Smoque!"
"This is a solid 4 star place. I have been here several times with 2-10 people. The Bad: The lines are annoying, parking isn't the easiest, and some of the items are not palatable to all people. For me, it's the Mac and Cheese* that is just meh... too creamy, not sharp enough, seems like they use oil instead of butter... the bread crumbs on top add nothing. The Good: On the other hand, I LOVE the lightly vinegared *Slaw. Lower the calories and add some zing! It has always been fresh too. As far as meat goes, I'm in love with the *Beef Brisket. I eat anything fatty and succulent and this perfect cut delivers. It is always tender and spiced well enough to eat alone. I get the sauce on the side. I think the pulled pork is pretty good too. Once, they had *Burnt Ends as a special, which essentially is the fatty end of the brisket cooked and sauced a bit differently. I loved it, but alas it isn't a regular item due to supplier constraints. The Average: The *Corn Muffins and *Baked Beans are average, as well as the greasy *Fries- I love that they use unskinned potatoes for them (think 5Guys). I used to go on weeknights and beat the crowds when I lived in the area, but now that it's a bit of a drive I think it will only be an occasional visit. It is certainly worth at least one visit, because if it is your style of BBQ (esp sauce) then you'll be in love!"
"I realize I'm in the minority here, but I swear, I've had better cole slaw at KFC & pulled pork at bars. Everything tasted either too bland or overpoweringly of smoke. Their sauce was too thin, too sweet and did have way too much cumin in it, as someone else mentioned. Everything's too pricey for what it is, too.To be fair, I DO pretty much dislike most things ~American~ so my palette may have adjusted accordingly... But perhaps my displeasure with our culture began with the cuisine... Who knows! All I know is that I won't be back here again. Sorry, Smoque. Next time I'm craving BBQ flavors, I'll just dump some Sweet Baby Ray's on something."
"Not much more needs to be said here, but I will anyway.Got a pulled pork sandwich, it was delicious, and I guess it's cool that the sauce is on the side, it was the highlight for me, and would taste good on anything, sweet yet tangy.  Mac-n-cheese was good, kinda small portion, but included with the sandwich, and let's face it, I'd probably eat as much as they'd give me, so portion control is good.The slaw was the vinegar-but-no-mayo variety, decent but forgettable, and also comes with the sandwich if you get the 'deluxe' or whatever.Great meal under $9, and I got there around 4:30, so no line.  I'm not the type to wait an hour to get a meal."
"Smoque is some of the best food for the best prices in all of Chicago.  We have had everything on the menu at least once, and you honestly can't go wrong...but the fact that you don't even need a knife to slice the brisket makes it the best!  Also, the sauce that comes with each meal will knock your socks off.  Seating is a little tight, but even during the busiest of times, the staff does a good job getting everyone who wants to dine in a seat before their food is ready.  But do be aware, that on certain nights/times, the line can be out the door and around the corner...Pros:- A place where you cannot order the wrong thing!- Wonderfully staffed with food coming out fast, tables cleaned quickly and a very upbeat environment.- The sauce is to die for, and you can take home a bottle for only $6.Cons:- Street parking can be chaotic.  Certain days/times (all day Sunday) there is a connected, free lot."
"I love Smoque!  My bf and I arrived at around 6:00 on a friday night.  Fortunately for us, the line wasn't too long yet but by the time we went to order, the line was almost out the door!  I was glad we didn't come in any later.The staff was pretty helpful in finding us a table.The ribs are fantastic!  I ordered corn bread with mine and the bf ordered mac and cheese with it.  I loved both and was extremely jealous that I couldn't have more mac 'n cheese!! I would have gone back to order my own but the line was too long!  I'm not a huge fan of cole slaw so I didn't even really try it.All in all, I can't wait to go back! :)"
"We decided to carry out from Smoque Friday night and am I glad we did! The line was out the door but the hubs was able to walk right in and pick up our dinner. And it was still hot when we got home. I ordered the half St. Louis ribs with mac and cheese and fries and he ordered the full baby back ribs with fries and mac and cheese. In a word, delicious. We have been talking about going here for months and the built up anticipation was definitely worth it! The ribs were meaty and practically fell of the bone. The sauce was tangy and great for dipping fries. The mac and cheese was amazing. I am kind of a snob when it comes to mac and cheese.  I can't stand the boxed stuff and this was far from that.  The portion for the mac and cheese was on the small side but I am not complaining.  Even with the half order, I still had lunch for Saturday.This place is BYOB which we will definitely take advantage of when we dine in.  Overall, a great spot of solid BBQ and tasty food!"
"Hey Smoque - you still got it, baby!I went back last night and got the same BBQ orgy I had the previous time: Pulled pork with the slaw, mac & cheese, and peach cobbler.  And added fries.  I left a very happy women.And, apparently, it's not just beloved by us Midwesterners who, living north of the Mason-Dixon are often told they know jack about BBQ!Some folks in from North Carolina came in and popped by our table asking for recommendations. My group suggested the ribs, pulled pork, brisket, mac & cheese, and cobbler followed with a timid, ""Hope you like it....we sure do!""  On our way out, we stopped at their table to ask their opinon and got a bunch of thumbs up and BBQ-saucey grins.  So apparently the Southern-dwelling BBQ conneisseurs enjoy it too.  I knew you had it in you, Smoque!"
"As a fan of Mikaska's in Taylor TX (where the Smoque folks claim to get their inspiration), I found Smoque to be the best BBQ I've had in Chiacgo, although still a noticeable notch behind the places back in Texas. The sauce is suitably spicey although on the runny side. The Brisket is tender and juicy, although a bit bland. The Peach cobbler is OK, the mac and cheese is delicious, and cornbread is authentic. Worth the long lines for dinner."
"I saw Smoque BBQ on an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Smoque BBQ is definitely one of the best eats when traveling to Chicago.  When we came here, the line was out the door and wrapped around the block!  The BBQ smell filled the air and I was so anxious to eat.  I had the sampler and had some very tender beef brisket (half sliced , half chopped), some scrumptious pulled pork, and some fall off the bone ribs.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  Also, their side dishes were excellent.  It complimented the BBQ very well.  The baked beans  was perfectly sweet and savory had chunks of beef brisket in it, the Marconi and Cheese topped with some bread crumbs was indescribable, and the french fries came filled to the top of a sandwich bag. This will definitely be a place I will go to every time I visit Chicago."
"Not Kansas City BBQ but by far the best I've had in Chicago. (Do yourself a favor and never go to Smokedaddy's, that BBQ made me throw up alittle in my mouth.)My usual is the ribs with a side of the mac and cheese. I will say I'm pretty picky when it comes to my ribs, and Smoque meets the challenge. I don't love their mac and cheese, probably cause it's too thick but I do like it enough to order it repeatedly. The beans are also delicious. Pick your meal times wisely, this place gets packed, quick!"
"Nothing fancy but great food.The dining room is pretty small and the line is long, but most people don't linger too long after eating and the host staff is awesome about arranging tables for a big party.  Even though you order before being seated, the host staff coordinates with the kitchen so that your food isn't done before a seat has been found for you.  Both times I've come, we've had a big party of around 8 people and getting seated hasn't been a horrible experience.I'm a huge fan of pulled pork, so that's the only thing I've ordered both times.  I find the sauce TO DIE FOR.  After living in North Carolina, I've really become a fan of vinegar based bbq sauces, and Smoque's sauce definitely has that ""tang"" to it.  I could bathe in the stuff.  Friends have ordered everything else on the menu and I've tried bites of it.  I like them all, but will always stick with pulled pork.I would have given this place 5 stars, but I'm taking a star away for the horrible excuse that is their coleslaw.  I know that everyone may do their slaw a bit different, but really there is no reason to deviate from the creamy goodness of traditional coleslaw.  These guys do and it's not a good deviation.  And  it is BYOB. COOL!Can't wait to go back for more!"
"Lots of hype, didn't quite live up to it.  Service was excellent, nice place, but food only OK.  We went on Friday nite and they were out of the dry ribs. Babybacks were over cooked and not much meat.  Pulled pork was good, brisket as well.  Sides were average.  We wanted to check out the buzz since we were in the area, and came away slightly disappointed.  With many other places to choose from, wouldn't go out of my way to go back."
"I had heard about Smoque from so many people but since I don't have a car, I haven't been able to get there. So last Sunday my friends and I were going kayaking but it started to rain. I lay down on the couch and started to watch the Food Network and Diners. Dives, and Drive-Ins was on and they were featuring Smoque!I started texting...I got an immediate interested and we then got our friend who had just eaten, to drive us to Smoque.The line was out the door and we waited. A long time...about 45 minutes but had very good conversation with other patrons along the way. I finally ordered and sat, waited and then my number was called. Here is the run down:Babyback ribs: tender and moist and semi fall-off-the-bone. The rib size were smaller than I'd had at other places. The bbq sauce is really sweet. I prefer more spice.St. Louis ribs: more juicy, tender and moist and semi fall-off-the-bone. Ribs also smaller than what I am used to.Sides:NOT IMPRESSED AT ALLMac 'n' cheese: cheese sauce was runny and the bread crumbs were raw.Slaw: seemed like it was just green cabbage, a hair of red onion and vinegar.Brisket chili: watery and the not cooked enough: beans were hard and the spices needed to meld more.I guess I was expecting much more compared to what I'd read (and after seeing the line).A good lesson learned here...I don't need to get all excited up just because a celebrity chef features a restaurant on his/her show."
"I love me some Smoque. Nom nom nom...I will admit I am not a huge BBQ snob, but this is pretty darn good food. The brisket, ribs, pork, and chicken are all super yummy, and the baked beans and mac and cheese are great sides. The cole slaw is vinegar-based, as opposed to mayo-based, and I know that's not everyone's cup of tea, but I like it. The peach cobbler is a nice finale.Only drawbacks - it's small, gets crowded, you may have to sit next to people you'd rather not, and I'm gathering the neighborhood folk aren't too pleased with Smoque patrons parking on their street (note the NO SMOQUE PARKING signs).  But I can't seem to stay away for too long...."
"My better half has had a hankering for GOOD barbeque for oh, I don't know, TWO YEARS or so. A quick search on Yelp revealed that Smokin' Woody's is nearby, but reviews were mixed. A second quick search revealed an average rating of 4 stars for some place called Smoque BBQ. We public transit over to Smoque BBQ to discover A HUGE LINE. (I returned home after our meal to discover that the place has 460 reviews, a minor oversight of mine).Okay, so this place must be good. An hour later we sit down with a sample of everything on the menu--pulled pork, brisket, chicken, ribs, mac & cheese, fries, cole slaw, and baked beans. Was it worth the wait? Hell yes. Everything was fantastic. The long line did not lie. My favorites were the pulled pork, mac & cheese, and fries. What's almost as amazing as the food is the system. Once you get in the door, a guy asks how many are in your party. He keeps an eye out to let you know where to sit. They have good insight on how long people stay and by the time you are getting your food, your spot is ready. It's really efficient.On top of all this, Smoque BBQ is BYOB. You can drink in line as you wait!"
Good food. Long wait!  Small space. Get there early!
"I have been to Smoque more than several times over the past few years and I have never been disapointed.  The ribs are the best that I've ever had in Chicago, always tender.  The beans are good, the french fries pretty crispy.  The brisket is good too but not my favorite cut of meat.  The pulled-pork is good too.  Watch out going on a Fri or Sat night.  Be prepared for long long lines and waiting.  Go some other night or on the weekend for lunch."
"We have been hearing about Smoque for some time but it was just a little to far to travel.  We were presented with the perfect opportunity this Sat to head in that direction.We arrived around 11:30 and the place was already starting to pick up.  So we scoured the board for the goody details we were about to order.  Now I have to say one thing really kicks off the experience is a very helpful and pleasant cashier/order taker.  This lady was extremely pleasant and answered all of our questions with a smile.I ordeed the chopped brisket with mac and cheese.  David have the 1/2 and 1/2 with mac and cheese and baked beans.  My meal was excellent, very tender and cooked to perfection.  The mac and cheese was very good and just the right size.David said he enjoyed the pulled pork over the brisket but found both to be tasty.  Now these bean he ordered had to be excellent as I thought he was going to lick the bowl when he was done.  They really have the process down and get you in and out of there.  I rolled myself out of there and onto the Pulaski bus for a quick trip home.  I am sure we will be back...we now have a reason to head in that direction again."
"In comparison to my last review I really don't think much has changed. Except for my rating. I recently took a trip Texas and went to a few BBQ places and I realized that smoke hits the nail pretty dead center. So I came back, and sure enough I was right. All around great flavor on the brisket, good BBQ sauce similar to that of Texas and good portion sizes. I think my personal taste is to have the sauce a little thicker. The best part about this recent trip was their Texas Chili. By far some of the best chili that I have had in long time. It could even beat my family's recipe. Similar Bonus Points as last time: BYOB, and Pretty good brisket, nice and tasty and good quality meat (Not a lot of fat like some places). I love the macaroni, wish you could get more. Finally they provide guided assistance/table organization during peak hours."
"You don't need me to tell you what the hundreds of other reviews have. The food at this place is great. The St. Louis ribs, the Texas sausage, the pulled pork sandwiches, the cornbread, the mac & Cheese, and the french fries were all sampled by yours truly on a recent visit. It was BBQ heaven, everything was amazing and done perfectly. I can see how this place would get crazy, and I'm not sure I would have given it a full 5 stars if we had to wait hours to order, but we came here at about 11:45 a.m. on a Sunday and there was only one person in line ahead of us. We ordered, were seated right away (with a high chair for our daughter no less), and had our food all within about 5-10 minutes of walking through the door.If you want to try this place but are put off by the prospect of fighting the BBQ-Loving masses, then I would suggest heading here before noon on a Sunday as we did. Even the parking out front was no problem."
"On the way back from spending the morning at the Shedd Aquarium, my husband had suggested we stop here for lunch. I had just bookmarked this place on Yelp after seeing them featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives Friday night, so I was excited to try the food. It did not disappoint. And keep in mind, this review is coming from someone who normally avoids BBQ since I'm not the biggest fan of it.I had the beef brisket platter with mac & cheese and cornbread. My husband had the pulled pork platter with baked beans and cornbread. Everything was delicious. Even the coleslaw was good, although I prefer the creamy variety (this is more vinegar based). We shared the peach cobbler for dessert which was out of this world. I'd come back here just for the dessert alone. We got there at a good time (noon) - it was busy, but they kept the line moving and there was seating available even though it is relatively small inside. You just have to resign yourself to the fact that your chair is going to get bumped every few minutes since it's pretty cramped. Everyone is in a great mood, though, so I didn't really mind. By the time we finished our meal the line was out the door. :)"
"As a vegetarian of over a decade, I do not recommend a lot of meat.Smoque gets my top recommendation....I wish I had a plate of it in front of me right now!!!Side story that totally won my heart: My husband and I return from out of town, looking at the GPS for nearby restaurants for over an hour without luck. Smoque comes up in the cue.....we're reminded of how many of our friends talk about this (Thanks JD below for reminding me to review Smoque!!!)We go and they're sold out. No luck, no joy.I'm waiting for my husband to use the restroom and a manager walks by and starts talking with me. He hears the situation and sneaks us two plates from a catering order!!! We stealthily ate an AMAZING beef brisket plate and were so thankful for it!!!Yum times a million, wish I had more time to drive up to this location more often!p.s. they are worth the long line, but we've never done it..we always have a back-up plan if there is a long line there..."
"This BBQ here is OMG DELICIOUS. I went here because Guy Fieri recommended this place and he has yet to lead me to a horrible place. The line was out the door and around the corner, but it was worth the wait. I got my food to go because the place didn't have any seats.  I waited and had my food within an hour. The beef brisket is so tender, the cornbread is full of pieces of corn, the chili has a smoky taste and the coleslaw is made just how I like it, with vinegar instead of mayo, YUM-O. The baked beans were perfect, I will be back, but I will phone first next time."
"I am big fan of BBQ, and I certainly miss my plentiful options while living in the south.  Smoque BBQ definitely hit the spot.  The place can certainly be termed a dive, but  a great one featured by Guy Fieri on Triple D.  The pulled pork and brisket certainly have experienced some TLC.  The mac n cheese was very good and very cheesy.  I also found the French Fries to be excellent! I look forward to going back to try the chicken, BBQ Baked Beans, Cornbread, and Peach Cobbler.  I took my food to go on this occasion, but the place was packed out with a line at 9PM on a Saturday.    Enjoy this neighborhood gem.I look forward to"
"Recently we went to Smoque for some carry out (our friends just had a baby so we figured it will be nice to bring them some good eats). One of the owners of the place (or manager) was kind enough to help us maneuver the menu (what to order and how much to order).We ended up having some ribs (both baby back and st. louis), some briskey, baked beans, corn bread and peach cobbler. He also gave us some complimentary texas sausages (he heard me saying how much i wanted to try it)Everything was tasty (esp the sausage and peach cobbler for me) but what impressed me most was how helpful and friendly the owner was. Definitely will go back and this time we will be eating in."
"My goal in life is to work here and find out what they do with all the food after the place closes at night.  If they give it to employees after closing, can I come work here????I continue to come back to this place on a regular basis and am still blown away.  Food temp and quality is consistent, service is outstanding, and the price is right. HELL TO THE YES."
"Best BBQ in chicago!  Without question the best Ribs I have ever had!  The St. Louis ribs were the amazing!   The Fries were up there too!  This place is worth the hype!They are byob!  Nice, I can bring some of my homebrews!The only negative, the building is way to small for herds of people!  They need a place 4 times the size, and few more locations!  Brookfield would be nice!  Nothing else to say.......the best!"
"The long lines outside that you'll invariably find yourself standing in are well worth standing in because the  food  is incredible and absolutely worth the wait. The first time I went to Smoque I had argued against going  because I was not a BBQ fan, but I was outnumberd by my friends so I reluctantly went along. Then I grumbled about having to stand in line to get into a place I didn't want to go to in the first place. Well, not any more! I've been a Smoque fan for almost five years now, have had everything on the menu at least twice, and have never been disappointed with anything. But my favorites are  the baby back ribs and the brisket. Cole slaw comes with every order, but I always also have the beans and the mac & cheese and the corn bread (althought there is no way I can eat all that at one sitting so, of course, what I don't eat there goes home with me) - and there is no way I'm not going to have the peach cobbler for dessert. The place is quite small and the seating is family style, you order at the counter and pick up at the counter, although sometimes the ""seaters"" (the guys who stay alert and seat you as soon as spaces opens up) will pick up your food for you. So don't let the long lines deter you. However, if you're in the neighborhood and don't see a line, don't think you got lucky - it'll be a Monday, and Smoque is closed on Monday."
"This place is all hype!  Thankfully we arrived around 5:45 on a Wed so getting the disappointing meal wasn't as hard as eating it.  Parked right outback, walked right in, ordered, and was seated in about 10 minutes.  Thats the positive.  Now the food ......Brisket, not Smokey nor juicy, kind of bland in fact. Pulled pork also lacked smoke and flavor.  Don't try to add flavor to the meat by dousing it in sauce either!  The vinegar based sauce is the work of amateurs.Ribs were only OK.  Nothing special.The beans had allot of smoke flavor!  The chemical liquid smoke variety.  It was obvious by the texture of the beans that someone was trying to make up for the lack of cook time."
Barry and his team do many things well here but fail on some of the big ones!! I have been to dinner here 4 times and it is very inconsistent! In speaking to Barry he has told me that he doesn't eat BBQ!! what!! you run a restaurant selling bbq!!!! they have the methods and the madness down but my three stars is for lack of consistency!! one needs to eat here to have an idea about the top 10 bbq joints in Chicago!! if you get there during a fresh shoulder or solid rack of ribs - or succulent brisket! you could die of a foodgazim!! try it!! you will find some yummy bites!!
"The first time I went to Smoque, we must have waited 30 mins in the line before getting in. It was a good thing that it was warm and not freezing cold. The menu is up on the wall and it's a serious BBQ joint. The location is pretty easy to get to as it's right off the Expressway. Parking was not an issue either as we found one fairly easily on the side street a couple of blocks away. You order the food first and then tell the person how many ppl is in your group and they will find you a spot. The place is filled with rustic benches and tables - very laid back and conducive for eating BBQ! The place is also a BYOB so that definitely helps cut down on the cost of your meal. :)Since then I've only order for to-go to bypass the long wait and the food is just as good! Their sandwiches are a hefty portion and I typically have enough for a 2nd meal. The sides are also quite tasty such as the mac & cheese and the baked beans. They have bits of meat in beans which makes it heavenly. You also can't miss the peach cobbler! Overall, great place for BBQ if you don't mind the long wait during peak-hours. Otherwise, order take-out and I promise that it's just as good!"
"a little background: im a huge fan of bbq...summer is most definitely my favorite season because it means i can eat bbq-ed meat for basically every meal and not be judged. and go to baseball games. oh how i love baseball. really and truly. a friend whose a bit of a foodie raved and raved about this place...so naturally, my sense of urgency to try it climbed. finally, on a chilly thursday night i was able to. and i have to say...i liked it. i liked it alot.i got the half rack of ribs, mac & cheese, and cornbread...the bf got the pulled pork platter, baked beans and coleslawCHOMP. not a morsel was left on either of our plates...highlights...-loved their sauce, defintiely order extra like a few reviews say-sides are great and very fair portions-the smell permeating the building is heavenly...-BYOB-add hot sauce to the mac and cheese for a spicy delightloses a star for how dang crowded it was (and apparently always is). bf and i were cramped up against a wall...next to a large party unafraid to invade our personal space..."
"OOOHHHH!  This place is The Best.  I went there a few months ago, not knowing what to expect, as I had never heard of it before - even though the restaurant was featured on ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"".  When I first walked up I was surprised to see a line of about seven people ahead of me.  Once inside I saw that there were seating for about 40, and the place was packed.  Didn't wait too long.  I got a deliciously tender pork sandwich.  And don't forget the dipping sauce...unbelievable.  I have never and probably will never taste such sweetness.  Thick, seasoned fries take you over the top - forcing you to loosen the belt a bit.FYI: It's BYOB, you choose where to sit and they call your number when your order's up."
"I'm most definitely not a BBQ conneiseur and I don't eat it very often, but this is by-far the best barbecue I've had.    Because of Smoque, I'm now a barbecue lover.  I dream of it.  :-)It would be great if they opened other locations.  I'd love to go back, but rarely travel to that part of the city."
"I'm trying not to eat out much lately, but today was a miserable failure. Breakfast at Jam's (biscuits and gravy were good, not great) and lunch at Smoque's. I was on the Northwest side see, as one is when they're not in another location, and google maps for iphone conveniently informed me I was a mere few blocks from one of the more revered BBQ restaurants in Chi-city. Brilliantly, I made the decision to invest $11 towards keeping my weight up. The sliced brisket sandwich was off the fucking hook. Just amazing meat. The mac 'n cheese, despite a distinct lack of truffle oil, was also epic. The coleslaw, however, was flavorless and sorely lacking in calorie content. It was not mayo-based see. The restaurant is fairly clean, with 2 bussers just waiting for you to take your last bite so they can snatch your tray. There were also other randomly scattered employees who have clearly mastered their trade, but appeared none-too-happy to be working there. I caught a couple of random scowls. Maybe it's because I was dressed like a total d-bag? I rocked the untucked Polo shirt, khakis, and flip flops getup today. I might as well have had ""How do I get back to Wrigleyville?"" tattooed on my forehead."
"Closest you can get to New Orleans style BBQ. I've been to New Orleans and this is pretty close.We got the different ribs, chicken, and pulled pork. The sides are delicious. I also love the communal benches you eat at. Gives it a neighborhood vibe. I met some interesting people despite having BBQ all over my face.The line is pretty long, but again, the people help make the experience that much more memorable.Three thumbs up. Wait a minute..."
"Smoque is a slightly above average bbq joint.  The brisket is phenomenal and the ribs are good.  I even tried the mac & cheese and peach cobbler and they are both adequate substitutions to what I'm used to.It's difficult for me to give and fast food bbq joint high ratings since I grew up on the south side and my uncle made the best bbq ever so my standards are extremely high.  Also, my granny makes awesome cobbler and my aunt makes the best mac & cheese hands down so compared to these, Smoque is OK."
Pretty good
Crazy good y'all! A little out of the way but totally worth it. Probably the best pulled pork and brisket I have had out.  I am very picky about BBQ. We liked the 2 sauces mixed together. Get the Mac and cheese and peach cobbler. Stop at the Walgreens and get a six pack. It is BYOB. Friendly staff. We got lucky-no line.  I would have totally waited.
"I think pretty much has already been said, that can be said about this place, but I'm going to throw in $0.02 anyway!No off-street parking, and on-street parking close to the door is prohibited by signs that say ""No Smoque Parking"".  The side street had little un-signed parking as well. we however, drove around the block, through the alley, went South on Pulaski and parked in the spot closest to the door.  I suspect we were pretty lucky.If you have read many of my reviews, you know that my once-a-week lunch buddy and I go after the lunch rush is over.  When we arrived, the place was full, but as soon as we placed our order, tables were available.Unfamiliar with the place, I appreciated the helpfulness of the host as far as the menu.  They have the menu on a huge blackboard, but he asked me if I would like a pring menu, which I did.  I had already decided I was going to try the sliced brisket, so ordering was effortless.I ordered the fresh-cut fries for my additional side.  I got my cup of ice water and was seated.  I think within about 4 or 5 minutes of sitting down, my order # was called.I really haven't had any really good BBQ brisket this side of Amarillo,TXbut I would say that Smoque came close to being like you find all over TX.  The BBQ sauce was more TX-like than you get at most places.  Most places seem to run to a Southern style sauce.  The only thing wrong with the brisket was that it was over-done. I could have eaten it without teeth.  I like my brisket to be a bit chewy.  Not tough, but chewy tender.  The slaw was over-vinegary.  The fries were great!My buddy had the St Louis ribs, with mac & cheese and fries for sides.  He said that the ribs were quite tasty, nice and meaty, and while not cooked so that the meat was falling off the bone, it was close to that.  He didn't care for the BBQ sauce and said he preferred Sweet Baby Ray's. His thoughts about the slaw and fries mirrored mine.  For as fast as the turn over is, I didn't feel we were being rushed to leave as soon as we were finished eating.  So all in all, I'll go 4 stars.Being a far-NW Suburb guy, I can't say that it was so remarkable that I'd go back any time soon though.  Besides, life is so short and there are so many other places to try."
Great BBQ....its tough to get really great BBQ and this place is really really good (if I hadn't been to another place out in the Southern burbs I would have given this place 5 stars...but then it wouldn't be fair to the other place which is better)
"I went for the first time last night after seeing that it was on DD&D and only a ten minute drive from me. I've always envied Guy's job so I figured I could pretend to be him for a night. I get there at eight pm on a Tuesday night, and the place was packed! I waited in line for about ten minutes and got my food ten minutes later. I took it to go since there was no seats.I got the pulled-pork sandwich and my boyfriend got the beef brisket sandwich, which we split half and half. We got two cole slaws and BBQ baked beans and their brisket chili. Let me just say this..WOW! Their BBQ sauce was tangy and a bit watery but it was something I never had before. Definitely very flavorful. I used to not be a fan of beef brisket until I had theirs. It was definitely tender and nicely charred. The beans had this intense smokey flavor and the chili was sooooo good. I can't wait to go back for the ribs. Not to the mention the prices were just right too for such good food."
Love this place - set the bar for good north side BBQ: long lines/communal tables - finger-lickin' tender brisket and chicken and ribs. Yummy sides. Great fries and cornbread and apple cobbler. Very popular - expect a wait during peak hours.
"The brisket gets five stars and is worth waiting a half hour in line for.  The sides are kind of overpriced for the portion size, but decent.  The place is small so there is not enough room for everyone to eat in, but if there's enough people working then a person will survey the line and try to make sure everyone gets a place to sit by the time they get their food.I'd like to stress again that the brisket is really really good.  My bf says the ribs are only ok, and he feels the same way about the sauce.  I don't like change so I stick with the brisket and it is really really good."
"Did not steer me wrong. Finally got up there after hearing about this place for years.....My friend was told to order the chicken; I will absolutely return for that. I'd had the pulled pork and brisket at other venues (Jiucy Wine Co.) and enjoyed the pulled pork platter again. Special brisket chili last weekend was spot-on, esp. with a side of cornbread.I am not big on french fries, and they really grabbed me. Plenty of pepper (a must), nicely crisp, quite fond of those. Can't wait to go back with my p's who have seen this on various programs."
It's definitely about the meat at this BBQ hotspot.  Wish it was a little more affordable but good barbeque is worth the splurge.Don't fear the line out the door.  It moves quick and the tables turnover just as fast.
Wow.  St. Louis Ribs.  Mac & Cheese.  Baked beans with brisket in them. Delectable corn bread.  Best BBQ sauces this side of the Mason Dixon.  There is no better BBQ joint in the City.  A must eat.  Bravo to the service also! Owners are in there cleaning tables and chatting up the customers.
"I love Smoque BBQ!  Before I get to the meats, I have to say the Mac 'n Cheese is the best I've ever had.  Maybe its the crumbly topping, or the oozy cheese, or maybe it's because each one comes individually packaged, making me feel it was made just for me.AND THE MEATS... the meats are so succulent, all of them!  I love that I can get a ""taste of _______,"" because even though I didn't want to focus on Texas sausage, I knew I needed to mix it up a little bit.  The pulled pork is outstanding, the meat slips right off the ribs, and the chicken was soooo moist and tasty.Whatever you do, no matter how full you are, please, for me, end on peach cobbler.  It may not be the absolute best cobbler in the world, but there's no better way to complete a good BBQ meal than some homemade cobbler.  I personally ate mine while I waited 20 minutes for the Blue Line in 5º temperatures, and it somehow made the downtime bearable.Please know before you go in, this is not a typical restaurant with waiters and waitresses that take your order and bring you your food.  You walk in, place your order, and they yell your number when its ready.  Your food comes on a huge metal tray covered with butcher paper, just the way God intended.Enjoy!"
"For some reason, I have been on this bbq binge trying to find the good ones in Chicago.  I am giving this place 5 stars because it just might be the best sliced brisket I have ever had in the US.  Now note, I am more of a fan of dry rubbed bbq, nothing too saucey.  But I even love eating at this place.  With the guy there to find you a table to eat at, it feels comfortable eating there...which is what a bbq place should be like.Also when I ate there, I ordered a half slab of baby backs.  Now I will say, I think the ribs here are just ok...Id prefer the brisket over everything else on the menu.  However one cool thing about this place when I ordered my ribs...when I picked up my order from the counter, the person told me I was given a small batch of ribs and that they would give me a whole another batch to make sure its right.  Thats amazing.  Most places would just give the small batch to some unlucky customer but this place wants to make sure you get it right.  I was rooting for the ribs after this, so I was a bit sad it did not live up my expectation for ribs (so far, I have liked Q's ribs the most).  But I definitely felt the urge to give a shout out to smoque for offering this kind of service.I wasn't crazy for the sides either.  So basically, my message about this place is that its a great place to eat at, and the sliced brisket is the thing to get."
"tried the pulled pork sandwich the other day. thought the meat was pretty tasty but when i happened to take a peak at their bottled bbq sauces they had for sale, both the original and the spicy flavors had high fructose corn syrup and anyone who knows anything about bbq is even at a high volume place such as Smoque, its a no no in terms of taste compared to regular sugar. so that was a picky turn off for me. not to mention the place is really small, expect during a busy time of the day to be sitting right next to a stranger at the same table while eating. most of the people that came in were taking carry-outs though so i guess it all made sense. my continuing search of amazing chicagoland bbq does not end here at smoque, but im still glad i stopped to notice it along the way."
"My belly was so full that I was literally holding it out the door...After Yelp Summerfest, I convinced Denton J. to head over to Smoque.  Sure, we had already feasted on all sorts of deliciousness, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity since we are never in Portage Park.As we pull in the parking lot, a Range Rover tried to literally beat us through the front door.  With only 10 minutes to spare, they wanted some BBQ and were willing to fight me over it.Um, I don't think so.Anyway, we got to the door, smelled the deliciousness, and all of us were served.  Luckily.  Otherwise, I'd have to fight them south side style.But enough about the drama: let's talk about the food.  Oh my, is it sooo mouthwatering good.  Denton J. ordered a full slab of ribs and I ordered the pulled pork.  It was so good that we just kept on eating, ignoring the fact that we were on our fourth meal of the day.  Finally, we called mercy and packed the leftovers to go.And then we got home and realized, ribs and pulled pork won't taste nearly as good the next day.  So we finished the order, like two fatties, at the breakfast bar.I didn't eat until 3PM the next day."
This place is just down right awesome.  I always over eat here because I want to try a little of everything. The ribs are so delicious.  Not to mention the pulled pork.  I am going to have to stop writing this review because it makes me want to go there and eat.
"This is the point where I wish Yelp offered half stars....because if they did, I would give Smoque 4 and a half enthusiastic thumbs up.  But, being from Texas and knowing the true definition of authentic bbq, I just can't give it 5 stars.However, the one feeling I had after last night's last minute decision to venture to Smoque was...when's the next time we're going???  We happened to stumble in there at the right time...because as we sat down, we looked up and all of a sudden the line was out the door.  Thank goodness for good timing, because I was starving!The fiance and I split a half chicken, brisket (sliced, not chopped), cornbread, mac and cheese, and cole slaw.  I am a brisket fanatic, but I have to say, I thought the chicken was even better.  Everything was really delicious.One small downside...and it's really only because, as my fiance says, I don't like people...they pack you in to these tables, and we were seated across from each other, but pretty much packed in like sardines with a people on either side.  At first, I was a bit uncomfortable, as though I were eavesdropping on these other tables...but once the food came, I was so engrossed in the delicious meal, I hardly even noticed anyone else was even there."
mmmmmm my mouth just salivates when i think about smoque.best brisket i've ever had. so tender. i like it sliced.the ribs are ehh. i've had better at other places. they aren't quite fall of the bone or as tender as the brisket.the fries are good and the mac and cheese is good but rather small.there can be quite a line for smoque so try to go at odd hours or just be prepared to wait in line. it's also byob!
I went here Sunday to grab food to go for a birthday party.  First the smoked chicken is amazing! And the peach cobbler...O.M.G.  Also the staff there was so friendly! I called like an hour and thirty minutes before I was going to pick up and from the lady on the phone to the staff at the counter and a man on staff even offered to carry my bag to my car! Such a nice guy.  The food was a hit and I will definitely be returning!! Thank you Smoque!
"Best BBQ in Chicago - hands down!!!  We talked to the co-owner Al who was totally awesome.  Smoque goes through about 500 pounds of brisket per day so you know there are lots of fans of this establishment!  Al recommended the half-and-half sandwich which is half pulled pork and half brisket.... that way you get to try both!  It was TOTALLY awesome, but I think I liked the brisket best.  Get both the BBQ sauces so you can see if you like North Carolina style (vinegar) or Memphis (tangy) better.  The fries, cornbread and slaw were perfect accompaniments.  I tried my dates mac 'n cheese and thought it was only so-so but I'm not a huge mac 'n cheese fan anyway. It's BYOB so be sure to bring a bottle of your fav wine/beer.If you like BBQ, you need to go to Smoque ASAP.  I have a feeling I won't be able to go anywhere else now, and that is the ONLY downside of eating their BBQ."
"Huge BBQ lover & this place just doesn't do it for me. Recently moved to the north side from the south side & have yet to find a BBQ spot worth going to on the north side. I had ribs, brisket chili, mac & cheese & cornbread. Best thing on that plate was the corn bread. Tasteless, no flavor. And this place is SCREAMING for space. Way to small & you're sitting at atable w/other people u don't know. Reminds me of lunch tables in grammar school. Fat Willy's was slightly better but not by much. Would not return to either of them. Back to the south side I go just for some BBQ."
"This is by far my favorite BBQ place in Chicago.After seeing the restaurant on a show on The Food Network, we decided to give it a try and we were amazed at the wonderful food.I've been to Smoque several times and have tried mostly everything and all the food is simply delicious."
"This place is okay, but I don't quite see what all the hype is about.  Are there just not enough places in the area with BBQ, so one of the few gets more accolades than necessary?  I can only comment on what I ate:Mac and cheese - not my style due to the breading, but overall well done.  I would prefer if it tasted more freshly made than cafeteria-style and did not come in the strange little tin.Slaw - I normally prefer a creamy version, but this was surprisingly good.Pulled pork sandwich - pork was a little dry and I had to pull off several chunks of fat.  I like the pork completely smothered in BBQ sauce, and the amount of sauce given still left me with non-sauced pork at the end.  The top of the bun was rather dry, which also made me want more sauce.Sauce - Tangy, good flavor, not very thick.  Fries (I ate two of my husband's fries) - Very good, but I don't really go to a BBQ place for the fries. This place is fine for a causal meal.  Be wary of going in the winter.  It was cold in the restaurant and by the time I was about half-way done eating everything on my tray was cold."
Great sauces and generous portions. Easy to take home and reheat.
"Fast-food BBQ - Just be warned!!The food is decent but nothing to write home about. Sauce has a good taste and I thought the brisket was the best item on the menu. It was really tender and had the right amount of sauce. Don't get the bread - it is uncessary calories.You feel pretty gross after you eat for several reasons: the seating is smooshed together, the food is greasy and obviously bad for you, and the place seems a bit...dirty. Sorry to say. Parking is a big annoying too cause it is on a main street with lots of no-parking signs. The price isn't bad, but again it is fast food for sure."
"I came late at night (around 9:20pm) and it still kicks butt with amazing BBQ!   Quite simply,  way to go Smoque BBQ.  The product is consistent, tasty, well priced, and fast. I'm looking forward to my future visits already."
"Ill add a little wood to the fire I guess...This is by far the best brisket Ive tried, and thats including true texas brisket ... acoording to my GF the pulled pork was great as well ! service was quick and definitely friendly ... glad i finally made it out there"
"2 stars from my first impression of an attempted take-out order.  When you call you have to go through an automated phone system (press 1 for our hours....press 6 for a catering menu to be faxed to your office...press 2 to place a carry out order).  We were told the next available time to come get take out was 7:50pm (it was 5:55pm when I called).  I've never heard of having to schedule a take-out order before.  I wish them the best for being so successful that you have to schedule a take-out but, unfortunately, I'll have to wait to try their food another day."
"We went here for a Friday lunch since it's only 3 miles from where I work. I've seen other people's reviews and had a very favorable impression going in here.When we arrived, an older, unshaven guy in an orange vest told us where not to park or risk towing. I'm not sure if he was a city worker, valet, or The Parking Nazi. Once we parked legally nearby, we came inside the little corner joint. Inside, the restaurant is very plain in its decor. The menu appears on a chalkboard and is easy to figure out.  What you need to know when ordering is that the brisket is either sliced or pulled. I chose sliced since I feared a mouthful of meat imbedded between my teeth.While everyone else in my group of 4 ordered brisket sandwiches, I went with the brisket plate & 2 sides. The brisket is awesome, tender, and charred crisp on the edges the way I love it, for that rich BBQ taste. Definitely a great meal!Following other Yelpers' advice, I avoided ordering the coleslaw, though the guys with me liked it. I may try it next time. I have to say, the sweet and smoky-tasting baked beans are awesome. Likewise, same goes for the fresh-cut, skin-on potato fries that are the best on this side of Gene & Jude's. The corn bread was decent but not mind-blowing. Free drink refills are a plus. Service is pretty quick for sandwich orders, but I found myself waiting the longest, since the brisket platter orders seem to take the longest to prepare. Still, the orders keep coming and the crew looks very efficient. I would definitely recommend this place to others."
"Sweet Jesus! I haven't reviewed Smoque yet? Well, it all started at a friend's birthday party, well it wasn't his birthday, but his daughter's. Anyway, he told me about this wonderful place that sold amazing bbq and brisket. He even had some at the party, what luck! I tried the brisket and it was amazing. The mac and cheese...mouthwatering. I had to have more. I had to be sure it wasn't a fluke.It wasn't."
"I have to say that I have had BBQ in LOTS of places around the US, but this place is DA BOMB!!!!!  The best ribs, the BEST Mac 'n' cheese,and the brisket is A W E S O M E!!!!!!!!  If you like BBQ and you need a place to go, TRY THIS PLACE!!  There is usually a line out the door and parking can be an issue but it is worth the wait!!  YUMMY!!"
"Had my first Smoque experience recently and it will not be my last.  I enjoyed some of the best brisket with a nice flavorful barbecue sauce.  You have to be careful ordering a sandwich because soggy bun is the worst.  Smoque preparded the brisket sandwich perfectly, the bun was great and the sides delicious.Give it a try - one of my favorite BBQ spots in the area."
"It's been a while since I've written, I may be a bit rusty, but here we go.  Last night husband and I tried Smoque.  We'd heard so much raving about it, that we were dying to try it.  True to what we'd been told there was a line from hell.  However I had called ahead at noon to order dinner at 7.  Once we got into the door enough for me to see an employee I asked where to go's orders get their goods.  He pointed me straight to the front and I was relieved.  The place smells of, well...smoke.  What did I expect.We ordered a slab of ribs and a pulled pork sandwich with fries, slaw, cornbread and peach cobler.  Seemed like enough to put us in a food coma. We grabbed the goods and headed home dying to rip into the bag.  Portions were generous.  They were smart and put the sauce on the side so everything wasn't a gooey mess.  We doctored everything up and got to eating.  This is our impression.The ribs fell off the bone they were so tender.  Good sign.  However the smoke flavor was so incredibly overpowering we couldn't taste the meat at all.  It was like eating smoke.As for my pulled pork.  It was tender as can be.  Thank god it didn't taste as smokey as the ribs.  The sandwich was huge, I couldn't finish.  Fries were fresh cut tater style and plenty of them.  Slaw was good, not to much mayo (maybe there wasn't any at all) but unfortunately they were peppered with raw red onions that don't sit well in my stomach so I couldn't enjoy them.  My husband slurped them up.Cornbread, if I'm honest...we took one bite each and threw it away.  It was terrible.  Sorry :(We saved the cobler, maybe we'll have it this morning with breakfast.  The place is a dive, you'd drive by and miss it unless your windows were down and you smelled the smoke.  It was packed, so you know people are coming back.  We might try it again and order the chicken.  But in my humble opinion, while I enjoy a good smokey flavor to my BBQ, I also want to taste the food.  Ribs were a fail on that account.  But I enjoyed the hell out of my pork sandwich so, it's like it evens out."
"Absolutely the best BBQ meat place in the Chicago area. We got the St. Louis Pork Rib, the Brisket platter and the peach cobbler. They are all perfectly done.  I have had BBQ meat multiple times in Kansas and St Louis. This is definitely comparable to the best places in these areas.  I stuffed myself full just a day ago and now I am already missing this place."
The BBQ was out of sight.  Brisket like buttah baby.  The sides...meh.  I prefer the sides at Smoke Daddy.  Loved the laid back atmosphere and BYOB-ness.  The meat is a 5.  The rest to me didn't measure up.
"I have a personal rule that I only give out five stars when a restaraunt does something better than I've ever experienced before (or at least damn close). Smoque met this criteria on with SEVERAL items! First of all, and most importantly, it was the BEST bbq ribs/pulled pork I'd ever had. Listen to me here, EVER! Next,  it was the best Mac 'n Cheese I've eaten in my life, and this is coming from someone that considers himself quite the expert on the Mac 'n Cheese. The line can be a bit of a wait, but it is well worth it. That is, is if you can withstand every single person exiting the place (the exit conveniently next to the line) thinking they are at amateur comedy night at the Apollo. My personal favorite was: ""Oh no, they are all out, sorry about that (as they rub their belly)"". About every third person out the door gave us that one... However, for every person that made the obnoxious joke, there was another behind them offering a supportive: ""Don't worry it's worth the wait (also while they rub their belly; that is a consistent theme)"".  Overall, if you haven't already been there, I'm jealous of you that you get to go for the first time very soon..."
"We were expecting really great BBQ based on all the things we had heard about this place, but it didn't live up to the elevated expectations.  It's good BBQ but not great.  We sadly didn't get to try the brisket, which is what we went for, because they screwed up our order and we didn't realize until we got home.  The pulled pork was good but a bit dry and the St. Louis Ribs were even drier.  The cornbread was baked in little individual cups and ended up getting soggy in it's own steam.  Might go back to actually try the brisket, but otherwise not a repeat place for us."
Best BBQ anywhere! The chopped brisket is the best. Great baby back ribs. We pick up from here as often as possible. Highly recommend it.
"Great BBQ- go a little early or before you're too hungry, there is always a wait and it's oh so worth it. Don't miss the Brisket"
"Smoque has amazing BBQ but get ready for the ambiance of an Army mess hall with a fraternity party (at least the night we went).When we arrived at the restaurant where there was plenty of easy to find street parking in the area (about 8 on a Friday) there was still a line out the door. After waiting about 30 minutes being jostled and pushed by people cutting the line for various reasons (usually they would get a ""line holder"" then the rest of the party would try to push their way to the front through a narrow passage).Once we got to the front a guy ask us how many were in our party so he could find us a table, we ordered and paid (they only had one register open on a Friday Night with the line going out the door) then were taken to a table. The restaurant itself was mass chaos, there were groups of very loud, obnoxious post-college types swigging vodka from plastic bottles, screaming, yelling etc. etc. I thought I was at a college fraternity party. The whole experience probably would have been more tolerable if I could have got a drink myself but Smoque does not have a liquor license.When we got our food (it took about 15 minutes) the portions were gigantic! (An amazingly large portion for the price) and living up to the restaurants reputation the BBQ is great! I got the brisket that was perfectly smoked, the sauce added the right amount of flavor, and the sides (especially the mac and cheese) were equally tasty. I consider myself somewhat of a cole slaw expert and the slaw at Smoque was some of the best I have had in a while, it was vinegar based, tangy and really flavorful (if you order the platter it is included so you can get two additional sides!).  My advice would be to get carry-out of this amazing BBQ or eat in the restaurant on a non-weekend night when it is less chaotic."
"So, my past review of Smoque got me thinking it was time to revisit, and yup, it was just as good!Full slab of back ribs was a little heavy on the rub, but I still loved it.  The beans were great with nice chunks of meat and onion.  Then, my only deviation was trying their brisket chili.  It was pretty good, but definitely not as good as other options.Still, definitely fantastic ribs and BBQ in general.  This place has really nailed it."
"This is a review of Smoque BBQ, and to a lesser extent - a review of the Food Network show ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives."" Reason being, because DDD is the reason I went to Smoque in the first place.I grew up in Texas, so when a Texan buddy of mine was in town visiting me in Chicago he told me he had seen this Smoque BBQ place on DDD and we should definitely try it out. Texas BBQ? Profiled on Food Network? Sounded like a no-brainer and we were excited about trying it out. It was an unusually hot and muggy June day (very Texas like), so the scene was set for a little reminder of home. Or at least that was the thought process...Smoque proves that just because something is profiled on Food Network, doesn't mean it's good. Or even adequate. Food Network jumped the shark on food integrity long ago. I'd estimate somewhere between The Next Food Network Star and Cupcake Wars. Thank God for Alton Brown - perhaps their only saving grace. Anyway - the food at Smoque was barely just ok. I'm no BBQ purist, but I will say I've been to numerous good AND crappy BBQ joints during my life, and Smoque would have trouble holding their own amidst the ""crappy"" category. Very sub-par for something featured on the Food Network. The sauce - often the crown jewel of a famous BBQ joint - was forgettable. Our group of four each ordered different meats and sides so we could share and get a more comprehensive tasting. We were all disappointed to say the least. The disappointment was severe considering the journey we took to get there (because of construction on some EL lines, we had to take two trains, a bus, and eventually a cab to get there). The food was hardly worth our Odyssey. Oh, and did I mention Smoque gave me food poisoning? I was sick for 3 days after eating there, effectively ruining a long weekend with friends in town.Now, I am a fan of the CONCEPT of ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives."" This, because of my general disdain for chain restaurants and my love of great little-known mom-and-pop places. I do a fair bit of travel for my job and if I was limited to Chilis and Applebees for all my meals I would lose my mind. But Food Network really does its viewers a disservice by featuring places like Smoque. They get away with it because they figure most viewers are unlikely to actually go to most of the places featured, and you can't taste or smell food through the TV set. Guy Fiere, albeit a decent TV host, is certainly no chef of record and all he does is kiss up to these places he features. He never plays the role of true critic, automatically discounting just about everything he features. Not to mention his abortion of a Sushi/BBQ (con)fusion restaurant, Tex Wasabi. Anyone stupid enough to fuse BBQ and Sushi has respect for neither BBQ or sushi. And he should really be ashamed of himself. But the Food Network is the machine which gives people like Fiere a voice to lead us all astray in our cullinary pursuits.So to summerize: Smoque BBQ - SKIP IT. And be skeptical of anything Guy Fiere features."
"Who knew that good BBQ was walking distance from my house?!Smoque is not the best BBQ I have had, I will admit. I used to live in the Carolinas so I have a biased opinion on how BBQ should be prepared and sauced. I haven't tried the pulled pork here, but the brisket was pretty fantastic. It was flaky without being dry and the sauce gave it just enough zing to not be overwhelming.The beans were the highlight of the meal. I don't know what they do to give them that sweet but smoky but tangy taste but two huge thumbs up to the beans.I'll add that the last bit of brisket I had in Chicago, was twice the price and half the flavor, so if you don't have a favorite haunt yet, try this one out."
I'm not a BBQ fan in general but this place was fantastic.  I had the sliced brisket sandwich with the BBQ beans and coleslaw for lunch.  Everything was great and I will be back.
"Proof positive that some people in Chicago will do ANYTHING to avoid going to the south side of the city for (waaaaaay) better food yelp.com/user_details_re… . This place is crammed full of cutsieness (a mini cupcake tin of mac n cheese), small portions (a mini cupcake tin of mac n cheese?), kind of bland food (a mini cupcake tin of mac n cheese) and a bunch of people that don't know shit about barbeque (and mini cupcake tins of mac n cheese) proclaiming it all just the best thing ever. Puh-lese. The meat is all very moist and wet tasting and all, but almost completely devoid of seasoning or meaty flavor. Could be beef. Or pork. Maybe chickenish? The ""peach cobbler"" needs to change its name to ""peach crisp"" with a quickness, or else one of these days somebody's moms is going to whoop someone's ass up in there on principle - oats and nuts and shit do not a cobbler make, but the mini cupcake tin of it tasted pretty okay. But it's still not cobbler. I had to track down some Tabasco to liven up the weak sauces. Fries are really really great. Coleslaw is not.  I like the kids' menu.But seriously - seriously - What is up with the jail-looking, prison-issueish, quasi-thali-esque presentation of the food here? Tin tray , lined with wax paper, meat lumped directly on that paper? Like the paper is the plate? And then tiny little tin muffin tins of sides. Is that supposed to be ""authentic""? Authentic what? (-sigh-I probably really don't want to know, do I?) Look, I've lived in multiple areas of the south, and they do have themselves a lot of fucking problems, but they do (for the most part) use plates. Luckily I had zero wait time, no line and no crowd at all - trust me, it is worth none of all of that (Zagat and Guy Fieri can be damned if those bitches disagree). But if you're in the area and it's about 3-5pm with no line or anything, feel free to have yourself a decent and probably forgettable meal (as long as you don't make the critical mistake of hyping it up in your own head too much...). And the people who work here are super sweet, which always makes even mediocre food go down easier. I'll probably visit again, too - I'm not always lucky enough to be near better bbq. PS - And, fuck! I am sooo mad that Tony C. already called this place ""antiseptic""-that is is the perfect fricking word, too. I don't even have another word that good. I'm about to have to check a damn thesaurus for a stupid Yelp review or something, sheesh. PPS - Seriously, that's not a cobbler.PPPS - The brisket at the South Loop Whole Foods bbq station kicks Smoque's ass...for reals...PPPPS - You know what? I really should have done this review as a music analogy.  Like you know how there were a ton of versions of Hound Dog?  And the Elvis version is okay and all, but the Big Mama Thorton version is such an awesome different animal that it straight whoops Elvis's ass, but how the Elvis version is waay better that wack ass Freddie Bell and the Bellboys version? Okay, so at a real bbq place, like Barbara Ann's or something, that would be like Big Mama Thorton and the Bellboys would be like The Patio or Arby's or Famous Daves or something.  Smoque would be almost like Elvis.  And what's wrong with that, right? People like Elvis.  And good for them, too."
"We were looking for a place to pick up food for my husband, the kids and myself. We came upon Smoque. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my husband had the 1/2 brisket, 1/2 pulled pork, and the kids had the mac and cheese. The meat was so tender and the sauce that comes with it was so good. My only regret was that I had to eat it fast and couldn't savor this tasty delight! The kids inhaled the mac and cheese and even my 1 yr old went to town on the stuff.I couldn't give 5 stars because I didn't dine in and my husband went in  to pick up the food!Next time, I'm going in!!!"
BIG Fan!  So happy I can walk there!
"FANTASTIC BBQ! The brisket, pulled pork and mac & cheese are worth the calories!"
"Smoque,Your staff is way polite, and your bathrooms are very clean, even with a line around the block.  oh, and you have the best f$#king BBQ ive had outside of texas. I am considering moving to a place down the street from you just so i can smell your BBQ cooking all day. bless you, seriously. love, kat"
"This place is so good I don't even know what to say.  My usual order: Beef brisquet sandwich with cole slaw, macaroni and cheese, a side of corn bread and peach cobbler, and also one half slab of st. louis ribs please!You can NOT go wrong eating here.  YES, it can get expensive - BBQ isn't cheap...but it is totally worth it."
The mac and cheese and peach cobbler were the BEST!  I'd go back just for those.
"My first taste of barbecue/southern cuisine came when I was a young boy.We were driving through Alabama on our way to Mobile.  It was late at night and the only thing open was a KFC.  A mustached beacon in the humid southern night.  ""Fried chicken livers anyone?""  ""Yes mom, whatever you say.""Many years later, I made a habit of Lee's and Dee's in St. Paul.  Small, unassuming, great ribs.  You can sit in silence off Selby Ave. and lick your fingers all you want.    I would never lick my fingers at Smoque.  There are too many watchful eyes, judging your every move.  Too many people extolling the virtues of barbecue.  People upon people.  Milling about, eating barbecue, checking to make sure your dining experience is all you'd hoped.  At times, awkwardly touching your hunched shoulders.  For me, this is a turnoff.  When faced with barbecued/smoked meat products, I need solitude.  I need a place where I can give full attention to the task at hand.  Namely, cementing my status as a decorated member of the clean plate club.  Don't get me wrong, the food was great.  It just seemed like there wasn't enough of it.  The brisket was extremely tender.  In the future I may just buy a pound or two of this, instead of doing the sandwich thing.  The bread seems to overshadow the star of the show.I did however, like the pulled pork sandwich, piled high with fresh cole slaw, drizzled with their signature barbecue sauce (tangy and delicious). One thing that may keep me away from Smoque is the hype.  I could almost smell Guy Fieri's hair gel as I crossed the threshold.  And as we all know, with hype comes congestion.  And I get really cranky when I'm forced to wait for food, a bi-product of my self-diagnosed, social-anxiety disorder.  I'll definitely come back for the ribs though.  Past that, who knows.  I would  almost prefer the nine hour bus ride to Lee's and Dee's."
"Off the hook. Very good st Louis ribs, huge portions, tasty sides. Overall quality is very high. I brought some French tourists here and they loved their first American BBQ session."
Everything you can dream of when you want BBQ.
"While the staff and service are very good at Smoque, due to small table space, take out is the way to go for Smoque's deliciousness.  I learned to call plenty ahead if you need to pick up your food at a certain time.  My husband and I were taking Smoque's out to a friend's house yesterday -- I called at 2:30 to place an order for a 5:30 pm pick up, and they didn't have any slots left at 5:30.  I got a 5:15 slot, and it was done exactly on time with no wait to pay.  All the 55 year old guys standing in line waiting to place their orders looked longingly at my efficiently packed brown grocery bag of BBQ heaven.   Now, of course, the food is amazing.  We tried almost everything last night, and my favorite is the brisket (chopped) with the North Carolina sauce.  Perfection.  Sides -- all great, get the mac and cheese and the cobbler for sure.   Thanks, Smoque!!"
"Good ribs, good macaroni and cheese, and good prices. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich, which she loved. If you like ribs you have to try this place out. Just take note, the seating is limited and you may have a nice litte wait."
"Good bbq in Chicago. I've had better in other cities, but for Chicago pretty good. This place can be crowded, so be prepared."
"Awesome BBQ. Had lunch on Sunday. There was a 15min wait to order, but it was worth it.  I had the the best baby back ribs I've had in years. Don't forget to order the peach cobbler to share with a friend."
"My sense is that this place really picks up at the key dinner hours, but damn, if rollin' in around 5:30 PM on a Friday doesn't give you curbside access to the counter.  Rolled in here for my second visit last week, with mummy and little bro in tow.  Given that the last time I'd come to the spot was last August, and that visit did not disappoint, I figured it was time for a second go.  Additionally, the advice of fellow yelpers led me to believe that this joint was to be the best of both worlds, if the set of worlds under consideration are those that (1) serve some of the best macaroni and cheese in the city and (2) are kid friendly.  Point (1) eliminates a good majority of spots, and (2) knocks Kuma's and Orbit Room out of the running for good (though who doesn't love getting tanked and listening to metal around children???)So it was that our weary trio ended up at Smoque, ordered two pulled pork sandwiches (wif frites pour moi, wif mac por mi madre), and an order of the kid's mac (which comes in a bigger foam bowl and sans the delicious--but decidedly adult--crusty topping.  Three fountain sodas, pleeze.Took a seat (the fact that they have someone greet you, let you order, then seat you is a little weird, but is a necessary protocol for maintaining order when the place gets busier), and it didn't take long for our number to get called (maybe 5-7 minutes; they seemed to be filling a lot of carryout orders).  Ran up, hooked up the grub.The verdicts?My pulled pork sammy was delicious, and hit the spot right where i wanted it.  Dumped the coleslaw and the sauce on the sandwich, and was good to go.  Ate the shit out of it.  I really like the sauce; it's tangy and flavorful.  Typically I'm all about the spicy-as-possible but I actually quite like the combo of meat-bread-slaw-sauce this sandwich delivers--no spice needed.  The fries are greaaaaaaaaaat, too.  Some day I'll try some of this Texas sausage, 'cause it sounds great.  Mum liked her food too - tho she's generally easy to please.  The toughest critic was the 6 year old, who deemed the mac and cheese delicious, and wanted to know if I had any idea what the ""secret ingredient"" was in the mac and cheese.  I ventured that it might be butter, and he agreed... until we had been there for a while, the mac and cheese got cold, and then his decree shifted from delicious to disgusting in one drop.  Can't please all the people all the time, I guess.Overall, a tasty spot when you get the urge for BBQ all up in your belly."
"Pigs, cows and chickens everywhere are massaging themselves with BBQ rub, in hopes of being selected by Smoque.  And you know why?  Because Smoque isn't just BBQ-ing meat.  They are transforming the residents of Old MacDonald's Farm into moist and delicious gods.I love their ribs - the baby-backs are melt-in-your-mouth perfection, and the St. Louis ones will almost ruin you for all others.  The sauce, served on the side, is tangy with a kick of sweet.  Not too much, not too little, and it complements the meat well.  If I was not afraid of being socially ostracized, I'd put a straw in the BBQ sauce and hit it.  My only regret?  I can't eat the bones.  I guess I'll have to settle for sucking on them.  Poor me!My other favorite (!) is the brisket.  This is the best brisket I've ever had.  I had smutty dreams about Smoque's brisket that I can't describe in polite company.  Shhh, don't wake me - let me be!Further, when I die, I hope to be reincarnated as Smoque's macaroni and cheese.  It's gooey and creamy inside, with a sharp twang and - AND! - a crunchy top.  Just like Mom's!  OMGFinally, Smoque has the last word on good service.  Would that I could get every restaurant in town to have such thoughtful, efficient and pleasant people manning the front.  Those folks at the counter are exceptionally sweet, and I swear that I'm bringing them beers next time I visit.  For the service alone I would go back."
"So it was a Thursday night and our little one spent the night by Grandma's house. When I asked my husband where he wanted to go he suggested ""smoque"".  I wasn't that excited about making a trip further north for bbq but it was food and I was getting hungry. When we arrived at Smoque the line was already out the door and I was starting to get agitated at the thought of standing in the ridiculously long line. Seriously, a line for bbq? I thought to myself ""this hole in the wall better be good"". When we finally got to the cashier I ordered the brisket, corn bread and mac and cheese. Number 72, number 73.... number 74. Finally! I don't think I will ever forget that first bite of brisket- it was so tender and juicy that it melted in my mouth. I was not really a fan of the sauce they gave with the brisket, but the brisket was seasoned so well I didn't miss the sauce. Their mac and cheese was also excellent. It is a little too crowded for me especially if we have our little one along. I definitely will be heading back for the brisket- next time it will be take out though."
"If you don't give Smoque 5 stars, you are ridiculous!Yes the line was out the door when we arrived at 8pm on Thursday, but I thought it moved rather quickly and they even have reading materials located at the door. The management has a great system set up to keep everything flowing.Once we got our food...heaven! The baby back ribs were meaty and the rub is absolutely to die for. They didn't even need any BBQ which I never say about ribs. I got the BBQ beans and mac and cheese for sides. None were disappointing. The baked beans were hearty and though I like a tad more heat, these were definitely a highlight of the meal. Bust into the mac and cheese early when it is hot for the best result. The crunchy topping was the perfect accompaniment. My honey's sliced brisket was good too, though he admitted my ribs were better.  :)I will surely make my way back to Smoque and will probably get the ribs again. Boring, huh?"
Great BBQ!  Best brisket I've ever had.  Casual... come as you are vibe.
"So after hearing about this place from a bunch of friends I finally made it in.  First off, I'm not a fan of lines or waiting 2 hours like Kuma's corner...not gonna do it.  I walked away from this place twice because I didn't want to stand in line.  It is a small place inside and they do not serve liquor.So I went and patiently waited.  I ordered food to go as it was a nice day and figured I'd find a park somewhere, snag a beer or two from a liquor store and eat in the sunshine.  I orderd a brisket sandwich, half slab of ribs and a small mac and cheese as I heard it was great.  My ribs were not the tenderest that I've had, the taste was good but I'll take Merle's or Gale Street in over these.  The mac and cheese was eehhh, not so great.  I can make better mac and cheese at home.  The brisket....now that's where you earned your stars, I'd have rated this place much lower but the brisket is some of the best I've had and I will definitely go back for that."
"I LOVE this place! The food is amazing and the portions are just  the right size. I go here every time  I'm in Chicago. My favorite thing to order is the chopped brisket platter w/ beans,coleslaw and peach cobbler. Staff is friendly and tables are clean. Parking can be difficult. I like this place over other Chicago BBQ places."
"What can I say that hasn't been said about 629 times already?  Good BBQ, small, awkward place.  Every once in a while they'll throw a special at you like ""Brisket Chili""  Yum!  Never had a bad meal here whether it was take out or eat in.  Be prepared to wait, though.  Now if they could just add a second floor..."
"Great menu, great sides and a nice laid back casual atmosphere.  I will eat here often."
"The food was pretty good, but nothing all that spectacular.  It will satisfy your BBQ craving, but don't expect anything out of this world.We had the baby back ribs, chopped brisket and pulled pork as our main dishes and the mac n cheese, peach cobbler, cole slaw and cornbread as our sides.  Everything was cooked in cute little silver cups and served on a mini cookie sheet which was very cute.  The cornbread was pretty good, but everything else was just average."
"If you love true Texas barbeque then you will love this place.  It still doesn't come close to Salt Lick, Driftwood or Rudy's in Texas but it's pretty good and it's in CHICAGO! I don't have to go all the way to Texas for good barbeque.Everything looked tasty so I was in a bind. I was eating for one today and I wanted everything. So I ordered taste portions of brisket, pulled pork, texas sausage, mac/cheese, and cole slaw.  The brisket is fall-apart good. The pulled pork was a tad dry.  The sausage took home the grand prize! It's smoky, garlicky and very flavorful.  The casing is crunchy and a good thickness.  The mac and cheese was definitely unbelievably tasty. The cole slaw is NOT creamy and heavy on the vinegar. I love it but I can see how those from Chicago don't really like it.  I do miss one thing that Texan bbq places always have with their bbq...PICKLES!I will definitely be back.  Go on Sunday and you can park in the attached parking lot without being towed."
"Having lived in Austin, Texas, and experienced the BBQ of the Hill Country, I feel it is hard to find good BBQ. I think Smoque does a pretty decent job of bringing good BBQ to Chicago - in my opinion, a town that sorely needs decent BBQ. The food is always fresh and inexpensive. Over four of five trips, I have tried both styles of ribs, the brisket, and the pulled pork. I think the brisket still needs work. It lacks the deep smoke ring you see at places like Ruby's or Smokey Moe's or the Salt Lick in the Austin area. It is also a little dry. The pit masters of the Hill Country seem to be able to smoke brisket for 24 hours and have it emerge with a perfect consistency of smoke, moisture, and texture. I think if Smoque continues to work on their technique, they will eventually start getting better quality brisket. The other thing I wonder is where they're getting their brisket from? The meat is good quality but it doesn't seem to be the highest quality you might find in the BBQ meccas. Lastly, I think they add a little too much brine to the brisket, therefore detracting from the smoke.What the brisket might lack, I think the pulled pork makes up for. I really love the pulled pork here and think it is their most consistent and well-done dish. The pork is succulent and moist, with just the right amount of crust. The sauce at Smoque is excellent with the pork, with the vinegar base serving as a perfect contrast for the sweetness of the pork. The large white rolls they serve their sandwiches on are perfect for soaking up a good amounts of BBQ sauce. I've tried both styles of ribs and am leaning towards the dry rub Memphis-style ribs. Just like the brisket, I still think they need a little more smoke. But, they go extremely well with the sweet sauce they serve them with.If you go, you have to try to mac n' cheese as a side, it is delicious, with a hard crust of cheese on top that opens up to a hot, creamy interior. The beans and fries are pretty good and the slaw could use a little work. All in all, I think they do a good job and will likely get better with time. A legendary pit master in Omaha, Jerry, one of the owner's of Fojay's Pit Bar-B-Que, once told me that most smokers don't develop character until you've used them for a few years. I know I'll keep on checking out Smoque, because it is by far the best I've had in Chicago.Parking at Smoque can be a challenge and it is often crowded, but we've never had to wait for more than a few minutes for a table. The decor is basic, but I'd be worried if it were anything more for a place serving BBQ. The staff is friendly, and one of the owners is often walking through the restaurant inquiring about what people think about the food - a good sign as I think they genuinely want to make their BBQ better each day."
"The fam was in the mood for ribs so we ordered 2 full slabs to go.I didn't realize how popular this place was until we drove up to restaurant and saw a line out the door.  Fortunately, since we did carryout, we didn't have to wait to long.  Just pick up and go - fastest way to get to those ribs in your mouth.You can taste the smokiness of the ribs and the sauce was so yummy.  I like that they give you an extra sauce so you can add on as much sauce as you want.The ribs aren't tough at all ... nice and tender.I can't wait to try the other items on the menu!"
"Believe the hype. This is fantastic BBQ. Our party had the pulled pork sandwich, the chicken, ribs (of course), mac & cheese, cornbread, french fries, and peach cobbler. I can't think of a complaint for any of it.The fries were out-of-this-world."
"Wow this place is great. Can they open in MA?I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of chopped brisket, mac and cheese, and cornbread.  Pulled pork was great really meaty and good flavor. The sauce on the side was great, good flavor and a little tart. Great on the pork. The brisket was the best I've had to date. Not too fatty and very juicy. The flavor was wonderful. Cornbread was moist and wonderful as well as the hot cheesy cracker crust mac.   I just wish I had room to try the fries, chicken and ribs!Great place, great atmosphere even if you have to wait a while."
"As a southerner, I am a fan of good BBQ and so far SMOQUE is the best I have had in Chicago! The brisket and pulled pork are mouth wateringly delicious... and their sides equally tasty. The Mac and Cheese is rich and creamy, the baked beans are flavorful (from the meat they cook it with), and the fries are phenomenal. Portions are huge... but no worries... SMOQUE left overs taste just as good the day after!!!Dont mind the long lines, they move pretty quickly and the food is definitely worth the wait!This place is no vegetarian friendly... unless you want a meal of fries, corn bread and slaw (which actually doesnt sound too bad)"
"Yea, so we fell for it. It was on tv, we had to go. Well, and at the time we lived like 2 blocks away so we were shocked to have never noticed the place before. At first it was exciting. The smells were good, the place was small but wasn't packed, and the prices seemed fair. Well, the brisket is good but not the 'omg best ever'. Still better than Famous Daves. The brisket chili, however, is amazing. The mac n cheese...doesn't even hold a candle to Kumas or even my own home made. I think the breadcrumb topping tastes like burnt grated parmesan more than anything. The bbq sauce itself is fairly good, but Im not sure I get the hype on that either.My dad thinks its the greatest bbq hes ever experienced and is always bugging me to bring it to WI with me when I visit. I think hes just fallen for the hype of television.Oh, and picking up an order is better than eating there. It may not be fresh but at least you're not eating in an extremely crowded tiny place on a wobbly sticky table."
"This place is f'in fantastic!  Brisket is great, fries are awesome & Mac n cheese, do yourself a favor and make the trip to this place, you won't regret it.  I've had a lot of BBQ all over the country but this place is easily in my top 3."
"I am not a BBQ fanatic, but I am a food fanatic.  I have a good palate and have eaten everything and everywhere from 5 star dining to food trucks in 3rd world countries.And Smoque is just smokin'. I'm qualified to say this just after one visit while on a Business trip to Chicago because my colleagues and I literally tasted one of everything on their entire menu.Platters and platters of Brisket, Roasted Chicken, Lt. Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, Pulled Pork, Sausage, Mac and Cheese, Baked Beans, Corn Bread, Slaw and Cobbler came out with delish BBQ sauce and the owner's private stash of candied jalapenos.The brisket was amazing with the jalapenos... so tender it was literally melting in your mouth and you didn't need any sauce what so ever.The pulled pork was utterly succulent.  I ate this with a bit of their BBQ sauce with chopped up jalapenos.  We finished this off entirely.Baby Back Ribs vs. St Louis?  I thought they were both amazing, but I loved the St. Louis the most.  The ribs had more meat on them and they were juicier.  The Rub they put on the ribs are so tasty they barely need any sauce either.I didn't get to try the roast chicken, but my colleagues loved it.  When we realized we hadn't ordered the sausage, the owner brought our group a sampling of it.  A little spicy, totally fatty and delicious.AND THE SIDES!  All I can say is fresh hand cut fries, baked beans with chucks of yumminess (bacon, onions, BBQ sauce, etc) corn bread with real corn, and cobbler to die for.The only suggestion I have is that Smoque start carrying vanilla icecream for the cobbler. Yum.  I'll be back."
"I have been going to Smoque since it opened and I am a super fan and so is my entire family.  We go regularly.  I love evrything in this place.  my only objection is that the pulled pork is not for carry out.  I would recommend having it at Smoque's which is a challenge give the cult following the place has gotten.  oh, and no sweet potato fries.  WHAT!?!"
"A group of friends and I (yes, with ""Tom T"") went to try Smoque last night.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect...good BBQ is one of the few things I miss about living in Texas.I ordered the 1/2 brisket (sliced) 1/2 pulled pork sandwich and a side of mac and cheese.  The meat is a little hard to describe...it was soooooo tender and yet not mushy.  Super tasty!  The mac and cheese was so good also...I'm glad the portion was modest, as I probably could have eaten a gallon tub of it, no kidding.  The few bites of coleslaw I had I liked, also...very crunchy and not too wet.When I first got there, the line was such that I didn't think we would be able to sit down, but somehow a spot to seat all 7 of us appeared; throughout the meal, I noticed nobody was standing waiting to sit down with their food.  I don't know how they do that.  If only Kuma's was the same way.  ;)Anyway...I loved this place.  It's just my style...great food without being fancy."
"Really enjoyed this. I was skeptical at first, but everything I had was tasty. The only thing I was less than ecstatic about was the mac and cheese. So yes, really good. And pretty decently priced. Lives up to its hype."
"Come for the BBQ stay for the peach cobbler.I'll confess, the first time I went to this place, the BBQ was a little too charred and Smokey for my taste.  But when I returned.  It was perfect.  Ribs were falling off the bone, the coleslaw was not smothered in mayo, which was good, and the peach cobbler was orgasmic...yes orgasmic.  Not only did Smoque impress me with their food, they impress me with their food presentation and service.  No one is unfriendly there, not a single person.  I'll be back."
"The smells are awesome, the beef brisket is awesome and among the best I have ever had!  The back ribs on the other hand were very average for me. Not really a fan of the dry Memphis rub at all.  If I was just reviewing the beef brisket it would be 4 or 5 stars.  I did not have the pulled pork but will be back to try it.  For me still, Carson's Ribs are still the best baby back ribs I have ever had in Chicago."
"My Dad has brought home take-out from this place multiple times, and I gave it a chance initially but Idk I thought the food was nasty........The meat smelled and looked like it came out of an Alpo can, and oddly enough despite it's heavy mesquite aroma, it had absolutely zero flavor. The macaroni is unimpressive and tasteless, and the bread crumb top to it does not do much for taste than it does to visual imagery........."
"I'll preface this review witha couple of facts about myself:  I was born in Houston, TX and lived between there and Dallas, TX until I was 16 at which point my family moved to Charlotte, NC where I stayed until age 21.  I went to college in Wilmington, NC (far east NC) and lived there for 11 years.  My younger brother and his family live in Savannah, GA.  My father was on a BBQ team in TX for years before I was born and several years after.  I know BBQ.So, we were in Chicago looking for an apartment and a local friend suggested this place.  He went so far as to say the pulled pork was better than any he'd ever had in NC.  My GF (raised in Raleigh, NC) and I decided to give this place a shot.It looks like a BBQ joint outside and in.  We approached the ordring area and looked over the menu.  There were at least 10 people in the ""kitchen"" - more than I've ever had on a hot line (I'm a chef) in my career.  I ordered a 1/2 rack of baby back ribs, side of sliced beef brisket, BBQ beans, mac & cheese and cornbread.  My GF ordered the pulled pork, cole slaw and mac & cheese.Our order was ready in 5 minutes (there isn't any cooking involved - it's all done and ready to be served). Neither the ribs or brisket had been sauced before the meat left the smoker;  big no-no in the BBQ world.  Sauce should be applied about 30 mins before the meat comes out of the smoker and allowed to caramelize on the meat.  Two sauces came out with our order.  Neither was a Texas-style sweet sauce or a Carolina-style mustard/vinegar sauce.  Neither sauce was appropriate for the meats we ordered.The dry rub on the brisket was good and would have been enhanced by the right sauce.  The rib rub was heavy on chili powder and not complemented by either sauce.  The pork had no rub flavor to speak of.Ribs should be fall-off-the-bone tender if smoked and held properly.  These were not - I had to cut them of the slab.  The brisket was smoked and held properly - very tender and flavorful.  The pulled pork came out just over room temp and had no texture.  Sides...  this was not southern-style cole slaw.  It tasted of vinegar and seasonings with a little oil of some kind.  Cole slaw dressing is mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar and seasonings - which seasonings depends on who's making it.  My GF (initially very excited about eating slaw) took one bite and spit it out.  The mac & cheese was the same stuff I got a Luby's Cafeteria with my grandma as a kid.  I don't what BBQ beans are but we don't have them in Texas or NC.  We have baked beans, which should be a combination of pinto beans, ketchup, brown sugar, bacon and seasonings.  These were swimming in a thin sauce with onions tasted like they had Liquid Smoke in them.  Cornbread was from Jiffy Corn Muffin mix - $1.00 at the local supermarket.  It wasn't bad, I like Jiffy Corn muffins.Overall, the brisket was good- not great.  The pulled pork was awful compared to the BBQ shacks in NC.  The sides were nothing to write home about.  The experience was sub-par at best.  Makes me think I should open a BBQ joint in Chicago."
"Smoque BBQ DOES GLUTEN FREE!  I've had such a craving for BBQ and having Celiac makes it very difficult to find Gluten free places.  While looking on the internet i came across Smoque.  So of course the first thing to do was call and speak to a manager and ask about cross contamination issues! Al was great, he assured me all of their meats and sauce are gluten free and they have a gluten free dedicated fryer for the fries! WHOO HOO so hard to find gluten free fries!  We went in there Saturday afternoon, I spoke to Al again (the manager) and he assured me my meal would be prepared with special care....the fries were amazing and the ribs and sauce were really good too!  Give it a try my fellow Celicas....just be sure to let them know of your issue before you order! Thanks Smoque for the special care!"
Hype hype hype.The food is OK not great and it's WAY too pricey for what it is.Try Sheffield's in River Grove. It's my new favorite BBQ place.
"What can I say that hasn't been said.  Place is great for bbq.  I've never sat down, always pick up, and food is on point each time."
"Man, I wanted to love this place, but it's not that great. I came here with an empty tummy and I left with one. Now I may be a big guy, but when I eat I don't expect kiddy portions. I shouldn't have to order more food from this place when there are better joints round town. I don't eve feel like writing an extended review. Points below.-Mac n Cheese and cornbread were fantastic but flipping tiny.-Ribs were mostly bone and dry.-Overcrowded.-Nice staffMeh..."
"I had a pulled-pork sandwich and it was DELICIOUS, so tender and succulent.  Wish I'd ordered the half portion though, because they give you a stupid amount of food.  Seriously, I've been known to put away my share of BBQ, but those portions are ridiculously huge.  Their sauce is sweet but very good.We got there really early, around 6pm on a weekday, and the wait to order was maybe 35 minutes, then the food got out pretty fast.  The place got packed with a line out the door by the time we left at about 7:15."
"Pretty darn good, for a northern state's BBQ.  I was battling myself on whether to give it a 3 or 4 stars.  I think I hold BBQ joints to a much higher standard because it's just a crime to serve bad BBQ! Maybe because I know what Kansas City BBQ tastes like I may have a slight bias.  There are so few BBQ joints up here, I had to give it a 4.  I ordered the half order of brisket sandwich with a side of slaw and baked beans.  The brisket was fantastic!  Very moist and tasty!  The sauce was good, but seemed like it lacked something that would really give it a good kick.  The slaw was bland and the beans were runny and a little under cooked.  Dissapointing.I defiantly must make it up here again to try the pulled pork and ribs!  mmm.. mouth watering already."
"Pulled pork heavenly as are the fries.Didn't care for the cole slaw (it is just DRY with no sauce) nor the St. Louis ribs.Beans were good as was the macaroni and cheese.B/f had the brisket, that was quite good as well. Disappointed a few times called ahead, they weren't accepting call aheads as their line was out the door.  No longer in the area, but will make it back there some day."
"I will fight anyone who says this place is anything but the best.  I didn't understand the obsession with Mac and Cheese until I ate here.  If I ever commit suicide, I will do it by overeating Smoque Mac and Cheese until I burst ""Seven"" style.  And I ill die with a smile.  I do have to admit I have an eating disorder I like to call ""being a pig"" but I prefer the St. Louis ribs to the baby back.  Extra smoky and perfectly cooked, these plus-sized mommas give meaning and purpose to my bland existence.  Brisket- two ways!!! Both great. The peach cobbler is good too.  It is probably a good thing that Smoque is so far away from my home."
"Best barbecue in Chicago. Period.""But, what about ....""No! BEST. BARBECUE. IN. CHICAGO. In fact, after Arthur Bryant's and Rendevous, this is the best I've ever had.Went with my parents a couple of weekends ago. I got a half slab of Baby Backs and a half slab of St. Louis Styles. Both were phenomenal. The meat has fantastic flavor without any sauce because of the rub, and with the sauce, it was even better.  I prefer baby back because the meat is much more tender and falls off the bone, but St. Louis style was very good as well -- just had to put a little more effort into it.Sauce was more peppery than vinegary -- very full of flavor with a little kick. If you ONLY like sweet sauce, you might not like it. But if you're open to your sauce opportunities, you'll be very happy.The mac and cheese was tremendous. I loved the fact that there were bread crumbs on it -- made it that much more flavorful and added another texture element that makes you ask, ""Why didn't I do this with my Easy Mac?""My mom got the brisket, which was awesome. Not overly tough or chewy like most brisket I've ever had, and it's very flavorful with a nice charred crust.Pricewise, it's not too expensive, about what you would expect to pay for a full rack of ribs (I think the ribs are about $17 a la carte, $21 for ribs with two sides).I still like Famous Dave's and Carson's, but if the choice is between these three, Smoque is where you need to be."
"Love this place.  Went again and was definitely not disappointed.  SO good!  By far the best BBQ in Chicago!  The portions are plentiful.  The interior is modest with limited seating.  After ordering at the cash register and then finding a seat (if you can), it is well worth the short wait for the delicious meal.  The brisket is really good and so is the pulled pork.  It's all about the sides too though.  They have some of the best mac and cheese and cornbread!  The peach cobbler is good as well.  I went with six friends and all of us walked away very satisfied with our meals and anxious to return again! I just wish they would open another location further South in the city! :)  Also, note that this place is a BYOB!"
"We waited in the line outside the door in the pouring rain. The added humidity only enhanced the luscious BBQ perfume emanating from this decidedly small, un-fancy building known as Smoque. While long, the line moved frequently, at least a little. When we finally ordered, a guy found us a table and we sat and waited for our number to be called. Seating is heavily communal; if you aren't comfortable with coming close to bumping elbows with another fan of great BBQ, go elsewhere. My companion and I were sat next to 2 Harley bikers and 2 old ladies, both pairs of whom had been coming to Smoque for years.We got the brisket and the chicken, with a side of the pulled pork for good measure. While I don't often eat gut-busting loads of BBQ...I totally would at this place, every day of the week, if I could get away with it. Delicious, perfectly prepared. The meat truly is the star of the show here; any sauce a modest second player.  Darned fine stuff. You should go."
"Alright, I'm going to state this up front first - I grew up in Texas, so I am accustomed to the Texas style of bbq and am totally subjective...  I have been disappointed before with what has been touted as ""great bbq"" here in Chicago, and I am always on the hunt for good bbq, and this place did live up to its hype.I had the sliced brisket platter with cornbread and baked beans, and also shared  the 1/2 & 1/2 rib platter with mac & cheese and fries.  I love brisket, and this wasn't as good as what I like (not as tender and soft), but it was tastiest as I've had in Chicago.  The ribs were good -- the baby backs are smaller than the St. Louis style but meatier, and both had nice flavor.  The baked mac & cheese was awesome!  The fries are a huge portion too, and surprisingly good; they're the thick-cut, skin-on fries.  The cornbread was good (can't really mess it up), and the baked beans had some meat in it, so I liked that touch.  I probably wouldn't get the brisket again, but I would get the ribs again and would try the chicken and sausage sometime.I can't give it 5 stars because it just doesn't beat my favorite bbq joint of all time (the Salt Lick... drool...), but it does satisfy my craving pretty well."
"I'm a business traveler, so over the years I've been able to eat at many of the famous (and not so famous) BBQ establishments in the US.  Here is what I know:  Just because its famous, doesn't mean its good (duh); and a ""hole in the wall"" BBQ does not always insure you will have BBQ heaven on your plate.  Something else: most places have a specialty - the ribs, pulled pork, brisket or perhaps even a side; beans, corn bread, etc., while the balance of the menu is only so-so.  Regional tastes dictate different preparation methods, but come down to sweet, sour, hot, mild, salty, peppery an/or various combinations thereof.  Smoque, in my opinion, is one of the best BBQ establishments in the nation.  The balance they achieve between the rub and smoker is hard to beat.  The meat stands alone; sauce is very good (there are two kinds, one peppery, the other vinegary), but not required (and they are stingy with the sauce, too).  Although I order their chopped brisket a little less than half the times I have been there, the ribs are excellent (baby back - I'm a Chicago guy), and the pulled pork is a great sandwich or platter, too.  I have not had the chicken.  The sausage is very good, with some subtle heat to it. The sides are uniformly excellent, although the slaw is not to my taste.  The fries are double fried ala Al's Beef, and very good.  In my close to 20 visits since Smoque has been open, food consistency has been to the same, high standard.Be prepared to stand in line, and sometimes they are sold out of an item (mostly, brisket).  Seating can best be called communal, but that's not a bad thing at a BBQ joint.  Outside seating would be great in the summer, but I'll not hold my breath on that.  Street parking is as good as it gets, but I have always been lucky to find a spot."
There's always a line that crowds the whole place but the ribs are totally worth it.
"What can I say, what can I say, if I lived near Smoque I would redefine obesity. Ladies and gentleman, this is probably the best BBQ I've had at a restaurant, ever. True, better BBQ is available, but only in someone's back yard or at a cook-off. As for mass produced BBQ, Smoque is really not just a little better than the rest, it is much much better. I ordered the St. Louis style ribs, brisket, mac & cheese and corn bread. Holy cow the ribs were good, and you get two different kinds of truly fantastic bbq sauce. They don't serve the same old Cattleman's sauce, they have something different that I have never had before, damn is it good.It's BYOB, there are napkin dispensers at the tables, prices are extremely reasonable. The dining area isn't fancy at all...they basically focused on the food.Stop reading yelp reviews about this place and just see for yourself!"
"I'm not a huge meat fan so this wasn't a destination of choice for me until I heard they had award-winning mac n cheese. I'll be honest, the mac n cheese was good, but the brisket chili was the highlight of my meal! It's not a regular side, but they have a special side every day and that was it the day we went. I also had the baked beans which have chopped brisket in it too. Very very good. I must like brisket because I got the brisket platter a la carte too which was alright, but the boyfriend ended up eating it cuz I was too full after all my sides :) I really really wanted the peach cobbler and was told I got the last one! But then when my order came up they said they miscounted and I didn't get any. Boo.They did, however, offer me another side of my choice so I got some texas sausage and a corn bread muffin. The sausage had a hint of heat and was very smokey, I loved it! And the corn bread was a bit sweet but not too sweet and just the perfect amount of grainy corn meal taste. Overall great meal and I'd definitely go back again."
"While most of the meat is amazing... and some background info before I write further: I don't care about fruit so muchI don't give a damn about peachesI would eat ribs and bbq sauce every day  for the rest of my life if i could I would bathe in that sauce, could I get enough... I usually end up finishing that peach cobbler side at home, and get my hands messiest that way, trying to scrape out the burnt sugar out of the aluminum thingie... it's completely addictive, and... no... not ashamed of it, rather the opposite;-) Good call, Pall! Minus:that asshole on my left, talking my ear off, screaming to be heard (granted the place is busy and loud)Plus:BYOB, really can't beat that to go out cheap"
"On my recent trip to Chicago, Bella(my fat friend) brought me here, It was walking distance from where we were staying.I ordered the pulled pork combo with 2 side dishes. She got the 1/2 brisket and 1/2 pulled pork and got way more meat than I did! I have never tasted a better mac and cheese in my life. Only problem was that the serving was too small. The pulled pork was really good and so was the brisket.This is one of the better BBQ places I have been to."
"As I wait for that fateful day when my folks venture forth from those sylvan groves of the North Shore and cry, ""Child, take us to Uncle John's (or Barbara Ann's),"" Smoque does quite nicely, thank you very much. Once you get over the unbearable whiteness of being (a snazzy bbq in Old Irving Park while Honey I et al. struggle elsewhere), it's not hard to appreciate that Barry and Co. are the area's best emulators, which is saying something, given how many false promises of real 'cue this city has gotten before. Best news: this is not boiled meat jello. It's not Hill Country, but it's probably as close as we'll get it: the brisket is, as noted before, excellent; sauce comes on the side, thank cheesus; ribs are pink-y and have an excellent chew (I sound like Pat Bruno, sorry). Sides are not ignored, surprising for a BBQ joint; go for the beans.The operation is efficient, and the prices--even after the constant critical praise--are still lower than most of its Chicago-style BBQ competitors.And my folks like it. So there's that."
"These folks are the best BBQ in Chicago, no question! The food is simply awesome every time I've eaten here. The seating is more German house style where tables are set right next to each other. This makes it so you make new friends. I always overhear newbies talking about their food, then I butt in to open the conversation. The owners are almost always on site and will make the rounds to see how folks are enjoying their food. If there is a line out the door, be patient and wait it out, it's totally worth it. Also, for parking on the weekends, check out the wooden gated area just behind smoque, there is almost always a spot or two. BYOB."
"My review is based on the 3 times I have been to Smoque BBQ, By now you are probably thinking ok she liked it because she went 3 times so why did she give it 2 stars?  First of all I was not impressed at all with their BBQ ribs nor with their brisket. The first time I went I ordered the ribs and I did not like their BBQ sauce, it was too tangy and full of Smoque flavor that to be honest it was overpowering for me. Their meat was hard to come off the bone, i felt like i was fighting it off the bone and was more chewy than tender. I did like the mac and cheese I just wish they would serve bigger sides, you can literally pick it all up at once with a spoon. The second time I had it, my family who lives 3 blocks away from there and heard the great reviews on it decided to order it for Christmas dinner.  I thought hey why not lets give it another try. We called to place an order but they weren't going to be open Christmas eve so we ended up buying frozen ribs from them to try to warm them up at home. BIG MISTAKE. the already ""ok"" ribs were now awful tasting , to say the least it was not a happy Christmas. So the third time I had Smoque BBQ, my boyfriend surprised me by ordering ribs for pick up there on a Saturday night, we barely made it there before they closed their doors to pick up the food and this time the ribs were the worst i had ever had. I don't know if it was because they were about to close already and they just gave us the last ribs they had, but they were hard full of fat and muscle that you are obviously supposed to take off before you cook, I have made ribs before so I know its sucks and its hard work to take off all the fat and muscle (it also depends where you buy them obviously) We were so disappointed, AGAIN! We swore never to return to Smoque BBQ for ribs, they just were not ribs to be consumed by us, but hey apparently many other people do like them. This was just my experience."
"I've been wanting to go to Smoque for quite a while now ever since a co-worker recommended it and I finally made it today.  WOW......should have made it a priority when he first told me about it cuz it was great!  I had the sliced brisket, which is like no  brisket I've ever had.  So tender and smokey, it melts in your mouth.  Great sauce to accompany it as well.  The corn bread was awesome, as was the cole slaw.  Didn't love the mac and cheese but I'm not a fan anyway.  I also tried the baby back ribs....which were also divine.  Tasted the pulled pork as well, which was awesome.  Next time.....Texas sausage and the chicken.  I want to go back tomorrow!  My new favorite BBQ place.  Thank goodness it's right around the corner from my niece's house."
Best BBQ I've had outside of Austin Texas.  We were lucky enough to slip in right before the rush.  We pretty much ordered everything on the menu and enjoyed it all.
"I actually heard about this place from my uncle in California.  I think this place was on the food channel.  Everyone was excited to try the famous north side BBQ joint.  Things you should keep in mind- this is a small crowded restaurant so it is best to carry out your food and order ahead by phone.  The beef brisket is great- tender and comes with their own secret sauce (ok that sounded bad but you know what I mean).  The chicken is tender and delicious and comes with a special BBQ sauce (all of the sauces are different).The BBQ beans were nothing special, the coleslaw was ok- its vinegar based and could use more flavor.  The best side that we tried was the cornbread- they are cornbread muffins.  Truthfully I can make better cornbread but this was decent.  Another note- you can order brisket by the pound which is probably your best option.  I would skip the sides and come for the meat... call ahead and take you BBQ to go."
"If you're on a diet don't walk downwind from this place!  If you have a craving for some sweet bbq goodness tho, then you must come here.  Let me restate that - if you want BBQ and you live anywhere near here, this place will have what it takes to hit the spot.  Juicy meat with delightfully smoky undertones coated in a sweet sticky sauce that ties it all together into what I call bbq heaven.  Its a busy joint, so be prepared to bump elbows with local workers, cops, and out-o-towners.  The BBQ is smoked and falling-off your fork good."
"Food:  The food really makes this place (Note-  it's BYOB).  You can tell from the moment you walk in the door, the owners, cooks & cashiers are 100% focused on food.  I don't typically crave bbq, but I've started to now.  I sampled the pulled pork, chopped brisket, hotlink, ribs, coleslaw, mac n cheese, baked beans & cornbread - yummy!  The baked beans were a little heavy on the onion & the mac n cheese was more fluffy than creamy (from all the butter, I'm guessing) but all the flavors blended nicely.  The name was definitely the staple behind the meat flavor, but I had been hoping for a little more of a smokey crust to the meat.  There wasn't much of a crust, making me wonder if it'd been sitting for a while.  Maybe it's better during peak busy hours (I was there at 4:30pm on a Friday) but even without the crunch, I would go back - oh, and get the peach cobbler.Atmosphere: Small town feel in bustling Chicago; always busy but usually in a friendly way.  Cafeteria style seating can be tricky for shy folks, but doesn't bother me any. This place is down to earth and all about the food - which gives me confidence in going back again and again.  I wouldn't bring a date here for the first date unless he/she had moved from Memphis and was feeling homesick, but I would come back to meet friends and family.Parking:  Street parking during business hours, and there is a small parking lot behind the restaurant that's available after hours.  You might have to walk & if that bothers you, you shouldn't be going here anyway - there'll probably be a line to get in.Price: Moderate; you get a lot of meat for your money, but the sides are pretty small for the price, so I suppose it all evens out.Service: For my friend and I, there wasn't a lot of service involved - walk in, order food, sit down, eat, and leave.  Everyone was friendly though, from the Cashiers to the busboys.  I liked it and will be back."
food was great!
"Sliced brisket sandwich is terrific.  So tender, thought it was chopped.  Mac n Cheese (too small) and cornbread are nice sides.  Nice atmosphere even though it is for counter service.  Parking signs are annoying on the side street.  Park on Pulaski next time."
"Hands down, one of the best rack of baby backs I've had in a long time!! The dry rub is awesome! Only in town for 2 weeks working, and I will be eating here again before I leave. Can't wait to try the brisket. Thanks Yep for finding this jewel."
"I came here almost a year ago, and apparently forgot to write a review! I had a pulled pork sandwich, which was pretty tasty, and some mac and cheese, which was super delicious. My friend had some ribs, and he seemed to enjoy them quite a bit. Came here cause it had appeared on Food Network, and I wasn't disappointed. It was cold out when I went, and unfortunately, the restaurant itself was still quite chilly. I don't like cold restaurants because then the food doesn't stay super hot for as long."
"This is my favorite BBQ spot in Chicago. I like to bring friends here from out of town for an ""authentic"" Chicago restaurant experience. The waiting in line part just adds to the anticipation. I have been here many times. I usually like to get the ribs or the pulled pork sandwich, the mac & cheese (creamy), the baked beans (best I've ever had in life), the cornbread (sweet and fresh),  and the fries (freaking amazing- nice and crispy). Smoque needs to open another location- quickly. My words of advice for you: Don't get the peach cobbler - it is more like a peach crisp. There is not any crust or dough parts inside. For me, that's key. Go during off hours- before or after a typical dinner rush. I usually  like going during the week around 8pm or on a Sunday at 3 in the afternoon. Its much easier to get a table during off hours.Enjoy!"
"Probably the best BBQ place I've been to in Chicago.  Still second to Pappy's in St. Louis, sorry.  But soooooo gooood."
"Smoque popped my BBQ cherry.  I had had a little experience with BBQ before Smoque, but I'm offically a BBQ brat now.  I mean if this is your first REAL BBQ experience, what the hell can POSSIBLY stand up to it?  The brisket is so good, I'm literally drooling thinking about it.  The staff here is great too.  One of my first times here we were asked to move for a larger party, and gladly did so.  One of the staff gave us free food (Sausage, that was pretty damn good though I'd never order it with the brisket on the menu!) for being so courteous!  A++!  You really don't find good service around very much any more, but Smoque delivers on ALL fronts.  Come hungry, leave happy.  Their sides are ridiculous too.  The mac and cheese is breaded on top, and comes in an itty bitty little cup, but I can't stop ordering it!  The fries are really damn good too.    My only complaint is that this place isn't in NW Indiana!"
Some of the best BBQ in Chicago!
"First off full disclosure, let me say that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE BBQ. I could eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner. I keep a gallon of my favorite BBQ sauce in the fridge. However with all the choices in Chicago it's tough to find one that hits all the right notes. Pros: Consistently good food. I have been going there a few times a month for a couple years and have yet to have a bad experience Reasonable prices. When you are addicted to BBQ like I am, getting a meal w/ 2 sides for $10.95 is a steal. Not to mention that fact that it's BYOB Easy to get to - it's right off the Irving Park exit of the highway, so w/o traffic I can get there in 10 mins from Bucktown Cons: As with any good restaurant it can get crowded sometimes. Many times there is a line out the door, but rest assured it goes quickly Tips: it's BYOB - so take advantage of that. But note it's not so much as sit down restaurant as a order at the counter sit down eat and leave type place. Go at off times to avoid the crowds I prefer the ""thicker"" sauce but you have to ask for it when you pick up your food. enjoy!!"
Word.My BBQ pork sandwich was hearty and delicious. I wish the sauce was a tiny bit thicker but it has an amazing flavor. I absolutely loved the mac n' cheese! DO NOT FORGET TO GET THE PEACH COBBLER!
"This place only deserves 5 stars and nothing less.  I've been here countless times. Everything is amazing here, but my go-to is always the sliced brisket platter with amazing fries, amazing Mac n Cheese and amazing beans.  Oh, I'm not a cole slaw guy, but this cream-less slaw is amazing also. If you like more of a kick, ask for jalapeños and they'll give you the S.O.S for your brisket. Ribs are great, chicken is great and Texas sausage is great. Their corn bread is delicious and the peach cobbler warms the heart and closes the deal.  The staff has been there for a while and are super friendly.  Everyone is great here. Thank you Smoque for being in Chicago and adding to the great variety in this great city....oh and it's BYOB...can't ask for anything more!"
"I don't think I've ever had bbq this good in my life... then again I'm from the north, and i've never been to Memphis in May BBQ Cookoff (which I would love to attend one day). But as far as I've tasted, this is the best!It's the perfect place to go for ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, texas sausage, and your favorite country sides all under one roof... and the best part is that they allow BYOB. So you can sit there chill with your friends, make yourself some cocktails while you wait for your food. I like that there's no waiters/waitresses, it's counter service - you order, u pick up your food, grab a seat and chow down.Half a slab will fill you up if you're not a big eater, but I would still get the full slab b/c you'll definitely want the leftovers! Their mac n cheese and cornbread also compliment their ribs really well. The place has gotten a lot more packed since it was featured on Food Network, but it still hasn't lost its hospitable flair one bit... can't wait to go here again!"
"I don't know why but I can't get on the Smoque bandwagon; for some reason this place gives me a tummy ache, and not from over-eating because it's a tummy ache that is unique to Smoque. Everyone raves over the mac and cheese but I find it slimy and gross; the fries are soggy and dense; the baked beans are overly sauced and I can't taste the bean. The pulled pork and beef brisket are amazing and perfect and all that, but they use that Hawaiian style of bread, which I don't think works with BBQ; the sweetness of the bread combined with the sweetness of the sauce just makes the whole thing too sugary. I also never really care for a soft roll with loose meat. I need something firm in a sandwich, whether it's the bread or the stuff inside the bread. Overall, Smoque just doesn't quite do it for me.Although, they debuted some manner of Texas-style hot link, which I have to say was mind-blowing, except that it also gave me a tummy ache.Smoque! Enough with the tummy aches!"
"Great place, tried the briskett its awsome, it gets busy... so get there early. Will be back."
"Really, what's the hype? I would assume that most of the 5-star reviewers have never tried barbecue from Kansas City or Texas.On a Saturday afternoon, there was about a 30 minute wait for carry out, which wasn't too bad. I ordered a chopped brisket platter with mac & cheese.The brisket was decent, and had a mild flavored sauce that was a little too bland for my liking. The mac & cheese was pretty damn good, but seriously...it's mac & cheese. Kinda' difficult to mess up.Overall it was good...just nothing that I'd go out of my way to get. Will I return? Possibly, assuming I'm in the neighborhood and there isn't a wait. So, probably not."
"My husband loves Smoque in an un-natural way! (I eat vegetarian, so I'll take his word on it's incredibility). He's more than willing to stand in line out the door to get a bite of this BBQ!We knew that we wanted to include smoke in our unconventional wedding buffet! Peggy, who handles catering, was amazingly awesome at helping us determine the size of our order and putting together reccomendations for us! We ended up with Brisket and Baby Back Ribs on the entree bar, and smoked sausages during cocktail hour. Our guests couldn't get enough! We scored some serious points for indulging them with Smoque!"
"I'll start this review off with list of CONS and then PRO:CON:-Not enough seating capacity; can only seat 30 maximum.-On weekends, you WILL wait at LEAST 30 minutes if there's a line forming outside.  But expect one hour at least, in reality.PRO:-THIS BBQ IS THE S***!  Both St. Louis and babyback ribs are VERY smokey in flavor and falls right of the !#@$@$#@ bone.  Simple AND delicious.  The bbq sauce is sweet/tangy, as it should.-Pulled pork is very good, as is brisket.  The brisket literally falls to pieces because it's been cooked so well.  -Mac n cheese is sooooo cheesy and crumbly; speaking of crumbly, peach cobbler is awesome too.-Corn bread is pretty decent; I've yet to eat a cornbread that blows my mind.-The staff is UBER friendly and helpful; there's free umbrellas outside for those who wait when it rains, while all the workers are attentive to your needs and passes out menu to those who wait.-The owner takes care of people, asking what they need, taking suggestions and overall being a top notch restauraenteur.  Conclusion:-If you want to step away from ""corporate"" ribs and get into small joint goodness of bbq heaven, this is the joint!  Worth every wait!!!"
Amazing. No frills. Just GOOD FOOD.
Our go to bbq in the city.  Best chicken I've had ever low and slow.  We love this spot.
"I'd have to say this is my favorite BBQ place in the city. Beats Smoke Daddy's and Fat Willy's. For the pricier amount, you definitely get large portions. I can't say I've had everything there, just the pulled pork and half chicken. However, both were mouth watering and could only get better if you were with someone who knew how to grill or getting the BBQ food on the street going towards a Notre Dame game.Sides are pretty large too and excellent tasting. For instance the large bag of seasoned fries you get, totally worth the money.Lines can get long, but they're pretty organized about seating. They've had employees direct you towards open tables. Also, BYOB. While eating there the first time, I saw a man waiting in line with a Heineken  mini-keg all to himself, and not holding back the drinking while waiting. I'm meaning to go back and try that too."
"Being from the south, I can definitely appreciate good BBQ when I have it. They have some pretty amazing pulled pork and their mac and cheese is amazing. As I type this now I am definitely getting a craving for it. The only draw back is the amount of people in there at the times that I have been. Regardless though, they have a very efficient system for seating people and it's a great place to get your BBQ fix. I'll definitely be back!"
"My husband and I are huge BBQ fans! I am more of a dry rub type of lady and he is a sauce guy. This place has it both! The meat is great- not dry at all and you can get the sauce on the side (if you ask for it that way) We have visited Smoque at least 3 times now and it is always BUSY!!! You need to get there right as it opens, to not have to wait, but if you are waiting, it moves pretty quick. You should give this place a try- it won't disappoint!"
"Had the pulled pork sandwich with beans and coleslaw. It was good and maybe the best BBQ in Chicago (I would not know bc I am just visiting), but I would not say it's the best I have ever had."
"Smoque is Smokin'! With this many reviews, I'll keep my short and let it be known I KNOW good BBQ, having lived in the South for many many years and married into a Southern family. Yes,  M'am.MUST HAVES: sliced brisket, mac and cheese with its wonderfully crumbly topping, ribs, slaw, baked beans, frieds AND peach cobbler that comes in a scrumptiously pecan-crunchy caramelized crust. MUST NOT HAVES: nothing whatsoever. Well, the sweet ice tea was a little weak, but hey, at least there's that option. I'll still take that, thank you very much.The leftovers taste just as good the second time around. My stomach and mind are clamoring for another visit very soon."
"Absolutely fantastic!! The brisket is so tender when you stick a fork in it, it falls off the fork so you have to almost use a spoon. Great sides amazing price.."
"I'm no BBQ auteur, but I was sorely mistaken in my expectations of ordering a half order of the sliced brisket sandwich.  The sandwich was not much more than the size of a slider.  I enjoyed their macaroni & cheese and the corn bread was baked to perfection.I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly we were seated and eating considering how busy the place was.  If you do dine in here, it's probably best that you go in even numbers and have conversation ready that you're comfortable for your neighbors to overhear.  The (creepy) guys to our left stayed an extra 20 minutes while my friend back for the holidays discussed her sexual experimentation with other women with me.The bbq sauce they serve here also throws me for a loop.  It's unique, but doesn't pang of any specific region of bbq that I know of.  Not to say its bad, just a little messy.  But I don't go to a bbq joint expecting to stay clean."
"You have to try it......We went for the first time on March 8th. 2012 and it was a possitive experience.... First of all the staff is Very polite and helpful. Place is clean. A little small but the food makes up for that. Mac and cheese, beans , cornbread are to die for.... Best brisket .....Ribs too.... Must try you will agree...."
"Fat worth having. Forget the sides, eat a salad earlier in the day, this should be a meat only meal. This small specialty bbq shop apparently always has a line but it moves quickly. Once inside, the humid smoky smell of roasting meat hits your nose and the anticipation of tender, juicy meat consumes all thought processes. With an assortment of baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork, I made myself a custom napkin bib and rolled up my sleeves to indulge in this decadent meal. The brisket was my favorite and the bbq sauce was spicy, sweet, tangy. Just go."
"Finger licking good. Call ahead and pick up your order! It's by far the best way to avoid lines that snake out the door and crazy crowded tables. They do a great job packing up your food so it stays hot and fresh until you get home.I recommend the chicken over all the other meats. It's to die for. I am a sucker for the mac and cheese and corn bread. Great food, great value, GO!!"
"Saturday night was busy and the line went out the door.  Even though you don't get a waiter, a host seats your party.  I had the full slab of baby back ribs, taste of brisket( 4oz., kind of like a sample), baked mac/cheese, and brisket chili.  Everything was good, but the 2 sauces weren't my favorite.  Also, I saw a table bring their own beer in. byob"
"I went on a Tuesday night to avoid the crowds, who come with good reason!I tried the brisket platter, half sliced, half chopped with Fries and the cobbler.  Everything was excellent.  If you leave without trying the cobbler, you shouldn't have come in the first place.I only regret that I noticed the ""add-ons"" menu after I already sat down.  I would have eaten my way around the menu for sure."
"Absolutely delicious.  I won't spend a lot of time rehashing the things other reviewers have already pointed out, but this is a fantastic place for any BBQ-loved to try if they live in or are visiting Chicago.  It's very close to the Blue line EL so I would recommend taking that because the CTA rocks my pants.Go early, go often, try everything on the menu, because it is all delicious.  And ask for extra sauce because everything, EVERYTHING needs extra sauce."
"This place has great food, but I'm just not a huge fan of dry rub ribs. The rub is really tasty, the meat is so tender and crunchy...but I just prefer mine to be dipped in a vat of sauce before I eat them. Just my personal taste, but if you like dry rub, you will love love love it.My boyfriend gets the pulled pork sandwich and recently introduced it to a friend of ours, and now the both of them can't shut up about how great it is. This place is ALWAYS crowded though, so I'd suggest calling in way ahead of time. We were around on Saturday afternoon, called for pick-up at about 5pm, they said it wouldn't be ready till 6:30. When we got there, there was a line for people waiting to sit down that was out the door...and it was sleeting outside! I know Chicagoans are hardcore, but standing out in the freezing sleet with no umbrella just to get some ribs? You know this place has got to be good."
Excellent BBQua in Chicago. Delcious brisket and awesome sides.  Place is laid back and beyond casual.  I wasn't the only one who loved this place.  I haven't eaten here in awhile but I still have fond memories.
I only tried the brisket but it was incredible on a really warm Chicago October night with great friends. Others commented on how good the pulled pork sandwich and the mac and cheese were. Prices are reasonable. Any time I come back to Chicago I'm planning on going back to Smoque!
"The worst part about Smoque is over quickly: finding parking and limited seating.I had the 1/2 Brisket 1/2 Pulled Pork dinner with Cornbread and BBQ Beans with a Peach Cobbler to finish. The pulled pork was decent but the brisket was amazing. I feel like I had never eaten brisket before Smoque! The beans and cornbread were good, but have I talked about the brisket yet??The staff is great - we had a larger group and they really worked to accommodate us during their dinner rush."
"Went on a Saturday afternoon after seeing this place on 2 TV shows.  Bad idea to go then.  The line was out the door!  We could hear everyone talking ""I saw it on this show, I saw it on that show.""  We wait in line for honestly 30 minutes.  Oh, and they have a sign on the door saying they are out of one type of rib.Anyways, we finally order then wait some more.  We take the food home as there was no where to sit.  The food was excellent.  Everything tasted awesome, right down to the sides.  Well worth the wait, but to avoid the wait, make sure you call your order in first, then it'll be ready for you when you get there.Minus one star because I think the owner was kind of jerky.  It's kind of an open kitchen and he was a real jerk to his employees, then he'd turn around and ask the patrons how they enjoyed their meals."
"I was recently on a road trip that hit through the Southern part of the United States, and was understandably excited about passing through BBQ country. And indeed, several times we did stop, and have BBQ, whether in Memphis, rural Mississippi, or New Orleans. And through most of it, I was distraught, asking myself ""Is this as good as it gets? This, America's most delicious, most celebrated food - this is as good as it gets?"" I won't name the restaurants I frequented on this trip (well, maybe in a different review), but I will say that no, that was not as good as it gets, because Smoque was far, far better. Amazing even. I tried the ribs, pulled pork, the brisket, mac and cheese, and coleslaw, and everything was great. The brisket, especially, is a must try. And the smoke flavor of the ribs was phenomenal. Get there early, because there will be a line out the door. Go, go, go to Smoque."
"If I could do 3.5 stars, that's what I would give this place.  The ribs are definitely great here.  It has the great smokey flavor and the barbecue has a great tang without too much sweetness.  I prefer the st. louis ribs cause they're meatier.  Seating is little difficult, but you won't wait more than 15 minutes.My problem with this place are their sides.  It's my personal belief that one of the best thing about ribs are the sides that it comes with.  There is nothing like a side of mac and cheese or baked beans to compliment your ribs.  Here, the sides are simply disappointing.  I tried most of their sides, and they were all a miss with the exception of their french fries, which isn't even a true side when paired with ribs.There aren't very many choices of food here either, so come here only if you are looking for ribs and not much more.  Their brisket was not flavorful enough for me, although cooked to true tenderness.  They definitely know how to cook their meats.I do think they serve excellent ribs here, but when rated against other great rib restaurants in Chicago, it falls a little short b/c of its lack of great sides, so I had to take away couple stars."
"Best BBQ I've had in Chicago... Might be the best BBQ I have had north of the Mason-Dixon Line...We ordered it for the Superbowl, picked it up earlier in the day and kept it warm until game time and it was still amazingly tender... Probably the best brisket I have ever had... Ribs were awesome too...Can't wait to try it again!"
"This place was so good! The pulled pork sandwich was huge and the meat had such a wonderful flavor. The BBQ sauce was uniquely a little more vinegar-y than most, but it worked. The fries, of which they give you a million, were very good and the homemade mac & cheese was awesome. This place is very unassuming--no sign of pretentiousness. The coleslaw, while not as good as my grandma's, was still pretty damn good. I can't wait to bring friends/family here."
"I've been going to Smoque since before it got famous, and it's never let me down. Easily the best BBQ on the northwest side. Even when the line is out the door, things move pretty fast. I think we usually wait about 15 minutes to get to the register and another 10 minutes for our food.Mmmm, the food. The menu is short and to the point. My boyfriend and I stick to the ribs, pulled pork, and chicken. All amazing (though the chicken can be dry sometimes). The fresh-cut fries are my personal favorite of any fries ever in the history of fries. The mac and cheese is a close runner up. When I'm in a healthy mood, I go for the salad, but it's not my favorite. (I think they use marinated sun-dried tomatoes on it, and I can't get into the flavor.)The only ways Smoque could improve: 1) Move to my basement ... or add delivery service. 2) Have somebody redo that salad; it's not that hard to make a great salad. 3) Get a bigger space or a patio area (or both)."
"Any place that FoodTV visits has a lot to live up to. Smoque lived up to expectations and now I'm looking for an excuse to return for more. We ordered the St. Louis ribs and brisket with sides of mac & cheese, beans, cole slaw, cornbread and for dessert: peach cobbler. Even on a snowy cold day, this place was busy so I can only imagine what it's like when the weather is nice. In those instances, I would order take out for sure. Although it was teeming with people, the host easily found us a seat and overall, the service was incredibly attentive and kind. That always wins extra points in my book. But back to the most important part of Smoque -- the food. The ribs are cooked in a dry rub so don't expect messy, saucy ribs. They are tender and flavorful, with a sweet sauce on the side. The brisket was equally tender. It could have benefited from a bit more fat, and the accompanying sauce had a little too much acidity for my taste, but they were still good eats.The sides really stole the show. The mac & cheese is probably the best I've had in Chicago (thus far); the beans have a rich smokiness and some pork mixed in; the slaw, although not creamy, was crispy and fresh; and the cobbler was deeeelicious with a thick, crispy crust and firm, fresh peaches. Overall, an awesome meal and I cannot wait to return for their pulled pork and Texas sausage."
"I do not understand. I simply do not understand! It must be the power of good press. Maybe Oprah said something good about it so the drones showed up. I just do not understand. You do realize that other cities giggle at Chicago's attempt at BBQ. Restaurant 101: If you own a rib joint . . . have ribs. When we went, they sold out. Of every rib. It was 7:00pm on a Tuesday. They also had already sold out of chicken and sausage. Not good. Sauce . . . fine, I get it, they put lemon in their sauce. Everyone cheer, lemon is here! I don't get it. Fries were delicious. Perfect. Mac and Cheese . . . uninspired. Cole slaw, delicious. Pulled pork: dried out, little flavor, completely overrated. Clearly did not help that I did not want pulled pork . . . wanted freaking ribs! Brisket: fatty but delicious. Please Chicago, stop treating this place like it is a savior . . . have you not read Ayn Rand? If you keep saluting mediocre that is all we will end up with."
"When people are willing to wait over an hour outside the restaurant for the food, that says a lot! My St. Louis ribs were sooooo good! It was tender, juicy, and exactly what I needed.  The Mac & Cheese was surprisingly yums too! I'm very picky about my mac & cheese, none of that kraft easy mac stuff for me!  This one came with a great crust and very cheesy on the inside.  The pulled pork was super succulent and very flavorful, even without the bbq sauce.  The brisket was almost too tender, I had the hardest time trying to pick up a piece with my fork.  The Brisket Chili was their special side of the day, that was so-so, I'd probably try the beans next time..or just get 2 mac & cheeses!  My only complaint is the false sense of optimism when you walk through the door and order your food.  If you're waiting for a table...prepare to wait another at least another 15 minutes for a table to eat all the yumminess at! p.s. their cold pulled pork/brisket leftovers were almost better than the original. Can't wait to go back and gorge myself senseless again!"
"I thought this place was going to be awesome.Me and my bf shared the baby back ribs and a pulled pork sandwich.Both were a little too fatty for my liking, but my bf absolutely enjoyed it. so to each his own.Maybe its just my personal preferences but...I do not enjoy the texture of fat.I've had ribs, pulled pork b4 that didnt have this texture and i enjoyed it, but not at Smoque.On the up side, the sides of mac n cheese and fries were phenomenal.I doubt i'll be going back"
Great food and customer service! Very friendly and welcoming staff. I also found the menu to be very user friendly. Simple place with excellent food. The Pulled pork sandwich and Mac & cheese were amazing. Thumbs Up!BYOB
"Sucks that I have to wait in line for how good the food is....im all about the brisket platter, man and cheese and french fries!!! yummy!"
"I love BBQ and I love Smoque.  This is by far one of my favorite BBQ places ever, it only receives 4 stars because I hate they community, picnic  table seating that they offer for dine in.  It is safe to say that I have tried everything on the menu by now.  My two favorites are the BBQ pork sandwich and the chicken salad.  The flavor of the pulled pork and the brisket in this place is crazy, it's ilke they have an old fashioned smoke house hiding in the back.  The french fries are crispy, just greasy enough and salted to perfection.  Cornbread=delicous and the mac n cheese may actually have crack hidden in it.  The grilled chicken salad has the smoky flavor as well and is crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.   The small salad is enough for two meals.  I recommend getting the small with an extra piece of chicken and saving it for later.   Overall Smoque is awesome, I prefer to do carryout because I find it hard to relax and enjoy a meal with the line going out the door and around the corner with such a limited amount of seating.  5 stars for food, 4 for eating under pressure."
"quite delicious. long lines, but worth the wait."
I tasted quite a few BBQ joints in Chicago and this is hands-down the best I've had. The sandwiches are excellent and they have amazing sides. like the baked mac and cheese.The atmosphere is also enjoyable and the staff is friendly.
"I don't know jack about BBQ. Texan? Memhpis style? St. Louis-an? No clue.But I know I do like moist meat, tasty/tangy sauce and a smoky flavor.Smoque really hits the spot. I've had the baby back ribs and the pulled pork...both excellent. The macaroni and cheese is very tasty, though the portion is kinda small. And their cornbread/muffin slathered in butter is divine.The seating is a little awkward in that the tables are all put together in community style. One, I'm not a big fan of eating next to strangers and two, since most people share this sentiment, everyone tries to spread out , which only makes it more difficult to find a seat.It's BYOB, which I'll have to participate in next time I go.Get in line and get yourself some b-b-q!"
It's almost unfair how good the chopped brisket is. Absolutely out of this world delicious!
"The best brisket hands down, end of conversation."
"Reviewing strictly the tray of food that was in front of me: this was simply the best BBQ I've ever eaten. I had the pulled pork and the beef brisket, and from the first bite I was completely glad I waited in line. That's the truth.No atmosphere, very long lines, crowded seating in a small space, no service to speak of, inconvenient... and TOTALLY WORTH IT."
"The BBQ is awesome!  Truly the best in the city.  But, if you're looking for a place to go for dinner, this is not it.  I'm really not a fan of the picnic style tables and the dining area is VERY small, best to call in your order ahead of time and carry out."
"One of the best BBQ places I have eaten at .... the place is not much in terms of decor .... It has cafeteria style seating (i.e. you share tables with other people) ... the plates and silverware are really ordinary ..... but the food will knock your socks off .... I have traveled to the south for work frequently, places that are known for good BBQ ..... I feel Smoque can hold it's own with any of them.   When me and my buddy got there,  the line extended out of the restaurant  and wrapped half way around the block .... I knew right then that this was the place for me .... :) The lines move fast and the service is good so we were sitting with our food about 15mins later ..... Great place, awesome food and really fast service.  Will definitely repeat."
This place was delicious! Don't be scared of the line out the door it moves very quick. I took my parents there with my husband and it was such a fun experience. You will not leave hungry. Mac and cheese was my favorite part.
"More brisket puh-leassse!!!Love it.  I'm not much of brisket connousieur but I know what I like.  The brisket here is delish.  Flavorful, tender and cooked to perfection.  The BBQ sauce to dip with is tangy and smoky.  I usually like sweeter bbq sauces but something about this sauce made me like it.Can't be a great entree without some yummy sides to go with.  Baked mac and cheese, coleslaw and corn bread are my choice sides.  The slaw isn't creamy at all, it's has more of a vinaigrette kick to it.  Make room for dessert or at least order it to go because the peach cobbler is a MUST.The ribs are great as well.  Can't go to a bbq place without trying ribs can I?!!  I've had both the St. Louis style and the baby back style.  And depending on the day, I can swing both ways.  Ribs that is!!"
"Incredible barbecue!  It is still BYOB though they do not have fancy glassware.  It is set up like a cafeteria, communal tables and all.  One of the owners is usually at the restaurant, shows a true commitment to hospitality.  Too many delicious items to list, although the meats can get a little salty.  Overall, a great experience for a remarkably reasonable price."
"i absolutely love smoque and everything they have to offer. this review is based on my last experience which i ordered carry out for a party. they had suggested that i place my order about 10 days in advance so they could be ready. i dropped the ball and ended up ordering 3 days in advance so i was worried. when i arrived to pick up the food i was pleased to see that they were waiting for me to arrive prior to packaging the food so it would still be fresh and warm. the order was perfect and the price was right on! definately recommend going through smoque it you need food for a get together. we went with 3 lbs of brisket and 3 lbs of pulled pork, mac n cheese, and cornbread."
"Smoque makes some very solid BBQ. The meat is tender, ribs come of the bone easily, and everything is reasonably priced for quality BBQ. It doesn't hurt that it has very easy access to the express way."
"Absolutely amazing food!  I've been here twice and the worst thing about Smoque is having to choose what delicious food you're going to order!  At dinner time, expect a 30 minute+ wait outside. Yes, even in the cold weather!  It's that good!!"
"It was very good. Smoque BBQ is a hole in the wall place- so don't be surprised to walk in there and say WOW, this is beautiful! Of course, most people look for food in a restaurant, not it's looks. So we walk into this place, and  it immediately smells like barbecue. Smoky, too. I had a pulled pork sandwich, and some macaroni and cheese. I'd say it was one of the best pulled pork sandwiches ever. I tried the macaroni and cheese, and it was basically your average Kraft mac and cheese.  It was a good restaurant, but just go for the meat, not the side orders."
"Don't be discouraged by a line out the door at Smoque, it's there for a reason and it moves quickly. The food is delicious. One of the guys I ate with absolutely raved about how moist the sliced brisket was and the rack of St. Louis ribs was a wonderful tummy filler.Of course don't forget the sides in their little tins cups. The cornbread has kernels of corn, the macaroni and cheese is very cheesy and breaded on top, and if you order fries you'll get an entire bag full. Good luck eating it all.It's very good barbecue."
"So far, one of the few best bbq in Chicago. I recommend the sliced briskets and the pork. For their sides, I'd go with mac & cheese and peach cobbler. If you get the dinner portion, it comes with their coleslaw (made from scratch) which is really good and fresh. I thought their beans were a bit sweet and the fries and cornbread weren't too different from any other restaurants. It's BYOB and it's packed during the evenings but they're good with their seating system. Sometimes the line starts from the outside so dress warmly for the winter. It'll be like a 15 min wait but it's worth it."
"Tried Smoque for lunch for the first time and was impressed, even comparing it to some of my fav bbq spots down south! I had the chopped brisket sandwich with fries and was lucky enough to try some of my husband's St. Louis ribs and Texas sausage. All were EXCELLENT. We weren't planning on getting the sausage, but I had a couple to use (where you need to spend $25) so we added a Taste portion of that on and it was a nice surprise!From what I hear, they're know for their ribs and brisket, so of course that's what we wanted to try. I didn't dabble too much into the sides, because there was already so much to eat, but they looked pretty good.It's not a very big location, so you'll have to wait around (and move around a lot so people can get around you), but it's worth it. Just know that you'll probably be at a large table with others and won't have much space."
"This is clearly the best BBQ in Chicago. I ordered a slab of both Baby Backs and St. Louis style ribs, both were excellent! The tangy sauce is drinkable it's that good!Loved the Mac and Cheese and Peach Cobbler. Although the slaw and beans weren't to my taste, I would highly recommend Smoque."
"the quality seems to went down hill.. doesn't have that real smokey taste to it like it used to. the brisket and pull pork is the only things i order from there now since the ribs is either a hit or miss every time i go . the beans and mac and cheese also doesn't taste as great anymore, sometimes the beans is just to watery and the mac and cheese can get too dry.. i will look for a new BBQ place to go now."
This was fantastic BBQ!!! Best I have had I want to say. I got a combo...pulled pork and brisket. I also got a sausage. All was fantastic. Brisket and Pork were amazing. The sauces were also amazing. I was very happy with this place. I am from the south where BBQ is well known and I was amazed at the quality of BBQ in Chicago!!
"It's like going back to your school cafeteria where they serve some of the best ribs you've ever had.I had the 1/2 slab + chili + cornbread (b/c cornbread is where it's at, dawg).  You can add on to this meat fiesta w/ your choice of pulled pork, brisket or some sausage.  I'm going that route next time.  The slaw was definitely unexpected.  I'm usually ""meh"" when it comes to slaw but the slaw here was pretty much a B-Side gem.  It's nothing too fancy but the taste really complimented the meal well.  Oh and don't forget this is a BYO place so bring your drinks.  My crew and I realized this fact a bit too late and were mumbling ""beer"" all throughout our stay."
"I'm not sure why so many other reviews are complaining about the ""large line.""  The large line signifies that the food is excellent and worth waiting for.Also, it's BYOB.Great all around."
"Smoque has the best brisket sandwich in the city.  I've tried the ribs, the pulled pork, and then my experimenting stopped when I tried the brisket!  I get it every single time and I never wish I got something else.  Believe the hype, it is THAT good (the brisket).  The rest of their menu is very good and the portions are generous, but the brisket truly is the one thing I've had that's out of this world.  My favorite sides are the delicious mac and cheese and the slaw!  I love slaw that's oil and vinegar based.  I've also tried their cornbread, beans, and the peach cobbler.  They're all very good, but there's a reason I've been going to Smoque regularly for over a year and I get the same order every time: 1/2 brisket sandwich with mac n' cheese and slaw.  Tips: go for lunch, it's less crowded!  They do call ahead orders for pick ups so that's what I would suggest if you want it for dinner, because parking is also difficult.  And wear comfortable shoes because chances are you will be standing for a long time in line!"
"Glad my partner referred me here.  Smoque's Sliced Brisket is tremendous!   Also sampled the Pulled Pork which was just as good.  Sides that come with the meal are also nice.  Service was impressive. The time we came wasn't too bad, since I've been told lines can  be quite crazy here."
My Favorite BBQ place in Chicago. St. Louis Ribs and the Peach Cobbler are amazing! Everything is good actually!  Service is friendly whether dining in or out.
"This place is ridiculous!  If you are a BBQ snob, like me, you will love Smoque.As a Texan, I know GREAT barbeque and Smoque delivers!The brisket is the best outside of Sonny Bryan's in Dallas.  The sausage is imported from the world famous Mikeska's.When I'm homesick for Texas BBQ and I'm in the city, I always stop at Smoque!"
"BEST. BBQ. EVER!!! The chopped beef brisket platter is phenomenal, so soft and moist. The sauce has the perfect amount of zing, if its too much for you ask for their other sauce on the side. The mac and cheese is reaaallyyyy cheesy, basically melts in your mouth as you eat it. I hate coleslaw but their coleslaw is to die for I can eat buckets of it a day! You can't go wrong with smoque if your looking for good BBQ."
"I don't even see how this could be debatable.  Smoque simply has the best BBQ in the City.  I live down the street from Smoke Daddy - and don't get me wrong, I love Smoke Daddy.  But sorry, no other place stacks up. I started coming to Smoque right when it opened, and while the food was always fantastic they had some service bugs to work out.   Last time I went with a group of six on a crowded Saturday.  Somehow, the guy had a table ready for us to sit by the time we made it through the line to order.  Appears that those bugs have all been worked out now."
best  bbq bar none.  best beef brisket i've ever had.  sauce has a nice kick.  BYOB too!!!  only negative is long lines.
Awesome!  I've been traveling to Texas weekly for work for 3 years.  I know BBQ.  This joint is the real deal.  The brisket is to die for and the mac and cheese is the best.  Eat here!  You won't be disappointed.
"very nice place for a good, a little  overpriced brisket sandwich,must go back for ribs but really impressed with obviously very successful operation,fantastic fries and slaw"
"We tried going to Kuma's last night but no way we were waiting two hours for a burger, so we hit this place up. It was a very pleasant surprise. It was no bullshit BBQ--I can dig that. They were out of a lot of things that late in the night, but pulled pork is good for me. It was really, really good. I'm no pulled pork expert but it made my tummy happy. On the side I had this tiny baked mac and cheese pastry cup. It was the cutest thing. I love mac  and cheese but I feel like whenever you order a side of it, its never that good. This one was delicious, with crumbs on top--and so cute! The coleslaw was also phenomenal. Lost of pepper and red onion really gave it that kick.We ordered our food at the counter and even though the place was jam packed, they sat us right away. A few minutes later we had our food. Even though the atmosphere is hectic (and there were other customers lingering around our table), someone came by to ask us if we needed anything else, how the food is, and then to clear the plates. I really have no complaints. Well, ok, it was a little drafty but I was totally fine.You have a silly name, Smoque, but you are kique ass!"
this place is the bees knees. the pulled pork and brisket are to die for and the sauce is drinkable. underrated part of the meal: their coleslaw. no one raves about coleslaw but theirs is the perfect twinge of tangy. only drawback is the location but if you have a car in the city -- this is a must do. don't expect any frills - this is down and dirty bbq at its finest.
"With its trendy spelling, I expected the inside of Smoque to be some kind of Nouvelle Barbeque experience. And am I ever glad it's not! The inside is that of a simple, functional joint: tables and chair a little too close together, a self-serve machine for fountain drinks, and a counter where you place your order, pay your money, and pick up the goods when they call your name.How's the food? Mostly fantastic. Since I live west of the city, I usually get my BBQ fix at Famous Daves (used to go to Robinson's, but they've really slipped). And while FD's ribs, sides, variety of sauces, and service are always enjoyable, there's something else going on at Smoque that really knocked me out: depth. Where some ribs might offer you mostly the flavor of its sauce, the St. Louis ribs I had at Smoque had a deep smokiness that permeated the meat, followed by a savory and spicy rub, before I even got to the flavor of the sauce! Oh, and though Smoque doesn't have a table-full of sauces to choose from, the one they give you is worth a table full -- it's excellent. So the ribs alone were worth five stars.Several of the sides were up to this same high standard. The baked beans were delicious and sweet, with flavorful meat and carmelized onions. The french fries were terrific. And the peach cobbler in individual-size tins looked small but turned out to be the perfect size after gorging oneself on meat. In our visit, there were only a couple of misses: the Texas Sausage and the Brisket Chili were both perfectly fine but not home runs.Service, by the way, turned out to be an unexpected surprise. When I was undecided between St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, the unassuming mustachioed manager on the floor guided me to the former. And when the counter girl rang us out without beverages after mistakenly telling me they didn't have diet fountain drinks -- before I noticed that the fountain machine had Diet Coke clearly labeled -- Mustache Guy quickly gave me two cups. Thanks, Mustache Guy! And thank you, Smoque. I'll definitely be baque."
"There are many great things about Smoque BBQ, it's an unassuming place located in a small neighborhood in Chicago. The food was great, with great authentic Texas BBQ taste. The Mac and Cheese tasty and creamy, the coleslaw like it was made seconds ago and the beef brisket to die for! When I'm in Chicago again, I'm coming back!"
"Before coming to Smoque I heard epic tales of its succulent greatness. I'll be honest after trying it I am not that impressed. Perhaps it is because I am from Texas where BBQ is king or I think that when you throw down $10 you should be given more food than you can eat, but Smoque did not satisfy my expectations.I got the Brisket Platter with two sides. The first side which was Mac and Cheese was great. The second side of the day which was Brisket Chili was unimpressive. This was more soupy than it was chili and it didn't really have the smoked meat flavor permeating the itemThe brisket itself was average. The meat was tender, but not as flavorful as I would have liked. The smoked essence essential in BBQ was not evident. The BBQ sauce was watery and did not have anything distinctly special about it.All in all for BBQ in Chicago the meal was good, but for BBQ overall it just doesn't even come close to a place south of the Mason-Dixon line."
"OverhypedI love BBQ, and I was happy when my friend John decided to treat my wife and I to dinner here 3 weeks ago. I had heard of the restaurant on yelp, and was eager to try their ribs.I never blame a place for being popular, but Smoque is too small (a picture taken in January clearly illustrates this). It can seat about 20 on the left, and about 40 on the right, but the tables and chairs are really close to each other. It's hard to move around when the place is busy (this is an understatement), and you may also find yourself waiting to be seated (there are some chairs by the restrooms, and people were constantly walking by my wife and I).A portly man (I'm going to talk about him some more in a bit) was less impressed than I was. He asked someone, probably the owner, if the restaurant could be expanded. He even suggested that the business next door be bought out (he was politely told that it's hard to buy out a dentist's office).  There are only 2 registers, and the line was almost out the door when we arrived (there were 5 of us, and I'm glad that other customers were respectful of John's daughters- he had 2 at the time, but 3 now). It didn't move very quickly, and it always reached the door or beyond while we were there (we were inside for a good hour). Anyway, it took us about 10 minutes to order.+The menu is small, but diverse enough (ribs, chicken, brisket, pulled pork, Texas sausage). I should have ordered some Texas sausage, but I didn't know that the sausages are really hot links at the time.There's a salad on the menu (a small is $5.45, and you can add chicken for $2.50 more), and John took advantage of the Kids Menu (it consists of 2 meals and Mac & Cheese).There are 6 sides to choose from (ex: BBQ Beans; Fresh Cut Fries), and 1 dessert item (Peach Cobbler).+You can Add a Taste (a meat to your meal or salad) for only $3 or $4 (the latter is for 3 or 4 St. Louis Ribs).+The staff works hard (one of the food preparers was sweating). When we came in, the cashiers were all business (I expected this), but quick and attentive, and some guys worked diligently to seat people.The food preparers also have a good system going. We ordered over $70 worth of food, but nothing was missing or wrong.+The prices are reasonable (ex: with slaw and 2 sides, a Half Chicken Platter is $11.45).+/-The portions are solid, but not great. Big eaters like me need to spend about $20 here.-There's very limited parking. Thankfully, we were able to park in front of a building that was just about a block away.-The selection of drinks is limited. The soda fridge contains bottled water and about 4 types of soda, and the soda fountain features 6 or 7 selections (if the restaurant is busy, it can be a pain getting to it- it's in the back).St. Louis Ribs (with slaw and 2 sides, a Half Slab is $13.45): 8/10.They're meaty and flavorful (they'll demand that your taste buds take notice), but I actually found them to be too strong in taste (my wife liked them more). Some of our ribs were also a tad burnt.The BBQ sauce we had on the side was pretty good, but light.They're a little more expensive (a Full Slab with slaw and 2 sides is $21.95), but Baby Back Ribs can also be ordered. They're smaller, but possibly better (they've evidently ""been king in Chicago for years"").Pulled Pork Platter ($10.45 with slaw and 2 sides): 8.5/10.The meat is good and not overpowering in taste. I liked it more than them, but I know that the ""kick"" the St. Louis Ribs provide wows most people (this was the case with my wife). Mac & Cheese: 8/10.Different (because of the crust and crumbs, a container of it resembles a piece of pie), but fairly good. A popular side.Fresh Cut Fries (a large is $2.95): 7.5/10.Not bad, but not spectacular. They're easy to eat and enjoyable enough.Cornbread: 7/10.BBQ Beans: 7/10. Both sides are just okay. The portly man came in with his wife. He may have been a food critic (he came across as an uptight snob who wanted to be catered to- he and his wife were also overly dressed). The owner apologized to him (the man and his wife waited awhile to be seated), but to no avail.Anyway, the man was seated at our table, and he didn't like being so close to John's daughters (he may have noticed that they were sick, but I think this really had to do with them being playful- still, they were pretty quiet and didn't make contact with anyone). The final straw came when John was helping a guy bus our area. A napkin fell on the man (it landed by his hands), and he could barely restrain himself (the napkin, by the way, hadn't been used). Anyway, John and I knew that it was ""time to go"" (I'm sorry, but I hope his food gave the man the runs).The layout is poor, but Smoque lives up to its name. The meat is cooked ""Low And Slow,"" and is very smokey. If you have to wait, your food will be worth it for the most part. Still, I don't see what all the fuss is about."
"First my standard BBQ disclaimer: I lived in Kansas City for five years.  Arthur Bryant's is my Mecca.  I get the Jack Stack Catalog in the mail.  Let's say I'm a little biased.  Smoque was ok, but i won't be going out of my way to get here again.  I hate to say it, but suspect the meats were not fully cooked over wood.  This is a deal breaker for any BBQ place in my book.  The ribs we had were not very meaty and the sauce could have been better (honestly it was not memorable).  Otherwise the ordering at the counter and sit down is a fine system, but the layout of this place is bad which makes for an uncomfortable dining room.  I hear the line is typical - so why not change the layout?"
"For starters, the first time I saw Smoque, it was on the Hungry Hound. Not long after, I saw the Guy Fieri appearance on ""Diners"" and decided to check it out. Now I understand a thing or two about BBQ. I heard about the journey the owner's took that eventually ended up as Smoque. The when I saw that they served beef brisket, my first thought was these guys have a death wish. I can tell you first hand (as many others could as well) is that brisket is VERY difficult to do properly. There isn't much margin for error, especially when working with a Packer's cut brisket (both flat and point cuts together). I've seen so many people and places try to do it and fail terribly (under/over spiced, poor blend of seasonings & overcooked being most common). They did what most people should do- go to the people and learn how to BBQ properly. The brisket was moist, properly seasons (one spice didn't overpower the other- I wasn't trying to figure it out, I just wanted to eat). If you spend a few extra dollars, you can get a nice slaw and two sides. The mac & cheese was rock solid. I decided to go with fries and they were also very good (note- I don't eat fries much anymore, so someone else finished them off for me). If you say you can make a good brisket but whiff, news will travel FAST!! So my next visit, I decided to do something else. I bought the smoky Texas sausage (actually, I wanted to just take a bite and take the rest back home). Not too spicy but smooth (it could be spicy for others with much lower tolerance for heat). I had the St Louis ribs my next visit. These ribs are fantastic!! I could say they could stack up with the legends in this area. The ribs were not fall off the bone but nice and tender (I think fall off the bone took a wrong turn from what was originally meant; I believe fall off the bone meant pulling away from the bone NOT literally falling off the bone). For the record, I'm not a pulled pork fan (when I BBQ it, I prefer to slice it; pulled pork not bad but just prefer sliced). Bottom line. The spot is pretty visible and easy to get to. If you find yourself in that neck of the woods, stop by and have a taste. Sit down and eat it or take it home to eat later. You won't be sorry."
"I was ""Smoqued"" the other night for the 1st, and what will not be the last time, that I visited the restaurant.  The food was GREAT.  I'd had the ribs before when I'd had them in someones home during a party.  A real urban experience.  In a quiet part of Chgo, Old Irving......The ribs were great, the sides especially good...not so much on the slaw.  The full slab is huge, so I'll now have a half slab for later on.  The dine in experience is just okay...the order line seems to run right throught the center of the store and there is really no place for you to wait for carry out.  I hope they have oudoor seating now that the weather is so nice.....can't wait to tey many of the other menu selections.  I give Smoque five big stars!!!!!!"
"good for carry out, dont stay. the food i have had better, the sides were good, the meat was ok, but nothing to brag about. the prices werent even right..."
"There's no beating around the bush. Smoque is phenomenal. Best BBQ in the city. The food is as consistent as it gets. Every single time. The first 5 times I came here, I got the pulled pork. I've recently become a brisket fan. There's not an ounce of fat on the brisket. It's better than the pulled pork, which seems to get cold awfully quick. And even though one will not come here for the fries, they are absolutely delicious. Crisp and incredibly tasteful. Cooked to order too. Don't come here on a date or with friends for a ""going out"" night. You won't be able to stay at your table long because the next group will be waiting. In fairness to Smoque, the staff NEVER asks us to leave. We just sense it's time to go, so the next group can sit. But come here with friends, with the significant other, with the parents. Fantastic food for very nice prices. I can't say enough about Smoque. THE BEST."
Great BBQ. Dont expect much from the ambiance because it isnt there. Go for the food and enjoy it thoroughly. Large portions and reasonable prices. Two barks!
It's good!  We had to wait in line that went out the door and down the sidewalk to about the length of the outdoor seating area and I thought it was worth it! Brisket was awesome :)  It's definitely more casual than I thought - it's an order at the counter kind of restaurant.  Free parking on the streets around it - just make sure you check the signs!
"Just writing this review makes me want another order of Smoque's baby back ribs.  They were exactly the way I want ribs to be - not falling off the bone like they were done in a slow cooker but smoky, meaty, and requiring some actual teeth to consume.  The sauce was great too, although fans of sweet-style BBQ sauces (like most types of Sweet Baby Ray's, for instance) may be disappointed because the Smoque sauce has a little kick to it and definitely isn't sweet.  I had mac and cheese and peach cobbler as the sides.  The mac and cheese is very heavy and creamy so a small side portion is all you need.  The cobbler was my least-favorite part of the meal (although I ate the whole thing, so that should tell you something).  The cobbler topping was awesome and crunchy, but the peach stuff underneath was incredibly sweet.  Really needed some unsweetened whipped cream or something to cut the sugar.  I would skip it next time.A note about the line & wait time: We were a party of 3 and went at prime time on a Friday night.  The line was clear to the door and every single table was occupied.  We figured we were screwed and there was no way on earth we would end up getting a table - but we were wrong.  I don't know how they manage to do it, but somehow each and every group we saw was seated immediately upon ordering.  I'll chalk it up to BBQ magic."
"food 5 stars!!!I absolutely loves the food.  The pulled pork was better than I have ever had at any Texas Style BBQ and let me tell you that is a whole genre' in the South.  The beans where fresh and plump and their sauce was tangy.  For somebody that rarely likes coleslaw I gotta say that it was fresh, light, and without mystery sauces that give me the heebie-geebies.  The staff was friendly and curt.The seating was set up in such a way that my lunch partner and I had to sit on opposite sides of a very long row like were participating in a rib-eating contest.  The decor is boring and unimaginative but the place is small and we did come for the food.  They also have created more traffic at the soda fountain than needed by providing people with 12 oz cups which boggles my mind in a ""bigger is better"" style of food.  Take their food to an an investor and interior designer and this idea could go franchise."
"Love the sides.  Baked beans and coleslaw especially are super good.  Just the right additional flavors to go with the pork.  The baby back ribs were a little disappointing---good flavor but really really really really dry.    Had better luck with the pulled pork, which was delicious.  The place is obviously popular and it is amazing that people manage to get in there at all given the paucity of parking.  It is extremely noisy and there is absolutely no privacy.  Long tables at which people are seated.  I would say get the takeout and skip the baby back ribs in favor of other pork choices."
"What is this place that the BBQ gods have bestowed upon us? The best I've had yet.  A true carnivore, i ask for more meat instead of sides and Smoque has never ever let me down.  The brisket is something special.  The pulled pork, amazing. I want some now.   If you don't need to stay then order ahead, stop and buy some beer and be the envy of everyone when you go straight to the front of the line.  In and out in 10 with a line out the door. Go home and make a pig out of yourself.  (No pun intended)  That's wassup!"
Even though this place is no longer new it is amazing to me that there is still a line out the door on a Saturday evening at 6:30. Don't get me wrong the ribs are great but there are lots of places to get ribs nowadays. I think people go for the peach cobbler because it is out of this world tasty. We were told that Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the days to go. Street parking isn't too difficult and even though it is first come first serve seating the 4 guys working the floor make sure that no one sits before their order is placed.
"Amazing.  I still have dreams about their peach cobbler and macaroni and cheese.Oh, and the ribs were pretty good, too."
"As much as I love the food from this place, the prices for the amount of food you get are a bit outrageous. They're not the best BBQ in the world, but they're as best you can get in the city proper. The sides are what I take issue with. However good the macaroni and cheese is a(nd the others), again, they give you half a cups worth and charge you an astronomical price just because they were featured on television. This spot is busy because it's trendy, not because it's the best."
"Came in around 5 PM on a Sunday (scored the parking lot in the back that's only available at weird hours for Smoque customers) and the line was only a few people long and open seats.  30 min later (Bears game at night), the place was packed, consistent line out the door and no open seats.  I came in with a game plan - try the ribs and brisket along with the beans and macaroni and cheese.  Forgot to add the taste portion of the brisket (instead got the two half slabs of baby back and St. Louis style), BBQ beans, cole slaw, macaroni, and corn bread.  The ribs were both awesome, finger lickin' good!  Baby backs are still my favorite, but the St. Louis ribs with the dry rub really grew on me by the end.Macaroni was amazing, the beans were pretty damn good, corn bread was just OK as was the cole slow - as other commenters noted, more vinegar than I was used to but was a nice way to cut through the saltiness of the meat.Overall very happy with my first Smoque visit - I'll be back for the brisket though!"
"The best BBQ I've had in Chicago. But the place is way too small for the crowd it draws - we ordered but had to wait for almost 20 minutes to sit down! The ribs were just right - crusty on the outside but juicy and tender. The pulled pork didn't have as much flavor as I wanted to see, but the ""Texas sausage"" was excellent. I didn't think the much-heralded mac n cheese lived up to expectations, but the vinegary cole slaw was out of this world. The sauce was good, but I would've liked a variety - sometimes I like sweet, sometimes spicy, etc.In other words, Smoque is very good for the city but a mixed bag overall. If you want some SERIOUS 'cue and are willing to drive for an hour and a half to get it, Charlie's Piggin' N Grinnin' in Benton Harbor, MI. Charlie McGee is a world-class multi-state BBQ champion and knows how to do a pig right. Plus, his four sauces (regular/sweet, hot, tangy and may-based) are all phenomenal. Anyway, not sure when I'll be back to Irving Park for BBQ again, but I wouldn't mind the 15 minute drive for Smoque."
Unfreakanbelievable!
"simply the best barbecue in the city.  not sure where to start, because everything is incredible.  BYO is a big plus!!!"
I've been coming here for about two years now.  It gets really busy during the rush periods... Your best bets are to call in orders and just bypass the line of people and go strait to the front.  You definitely can't be shy here.  The barbecue is amazing.  In particular the pulled pork and their nc-style sauce.  I'm from N.C and have been spoiled with great barbecue my entire life.  I come here and reminisce about my North Carolina Day's.  This pulled pork is the BEST I've ever had.  The brisket is awesome too.... Rib's and texas sausage are just decent... but I've never been a fan of those anyway.  Sides are also good and they serve Sweet Tea!!
"This place was really far away, so thats the minus, and also it was crowded, but the staff was so handy. My friend was all 'It's hot in here'and he was all 'I'ma go turn the air on for you'Then I ate the mac and cheese.BAM SO GOOD."
"There's just something about less-than-kosher Chicago restaurants operated by Jews; maybe it's true love that drives them to the forbidden fruit, or maybe it requires a necessary dealing with the devil to get into the business, but in my experience, my fellow tribal Chicagoans do excellent things with treyf. First Hot Doug's, and now Smoque. We arrived at ~7:40 PM on a Thursday, and the line was just barely out the door, which is always a good sign. Our food was ready before 8:10; despite the sea of humanity in this establishment, you still probably eat quicker after entry than at a sit-down BBQ restaurant.Every last morsel was divine. The pulled pork was moist yet surprisingly lean, without an atom of gristle to be found. The ribs had the telltale pink ring of meat just beneath the surface that signifies an expertly-smoked rack. The texas sausage was tender and spicy. And then there's the brisket. I apologize if you have a Jewish grandmother, because this is better than hers. It is perfectly seasoned and smoked to perfection, tender while still retaining its meatiness and shape. The side dishes (fries, corn bread, BBQ baked beans, mac and cheese, corn bread) were all delectable; it was clear that effort had been put into them, which is unusual for a barbecue place, especially a good one. Halfway through the meal I was preparing this yelp review, and realized that there was one thing that would hold Smoque away from a 5 star review: the sauce. This being a Chicago establishment, it was no surprise that the sauce was too thick and saccharine, as my fellow natives have an inexplicable penchant for cloying, barely-more-than-ketchup barbecue sauces. Still, I could not forgive this very average sauce; I wanted a sauce that packed more vinegar punch, with less tomato and a heck of a lot more heat. A fellow patron overheard my gripe, and informed me that they carried a spicy sauce in addition to the regular offering; I immediately went to the counter and picked up a sauce that (surprise) packed more vinegar punch, with less tomato, and a heck of a lot more heat. There went my lone complaint. I guess I could take off a star because the woman who took my order forgot to ask me if I wanted mild or spicy, but this meal left me in such a state of ecstasy that I'd feel like a scrooge if I did so."
"Time: Friday night, 04/2011Entrée: Chopped Beef Brisket sandwich Pros: 1. Excellent customer service.  Everybody was very nice and friendly. 2. extensive menu3. My friend and I ordered the same thing, chopped beef brisket sandwich and it was OK. Well I think the sauce makes the meal.  They only had 2 choices of sauce to choose from for the beef brisket. They pretty much tasted the same, one was slightly more...spicy than the other. But they were pretty much the same. I prefer more of a sweeter sauce.  I've had better in Tennessee or even at Uncle Bub's here in the south suburb. 4. Average pricing 6. Appeared clean under the nasty white lights.Cons:1. Brisket sauce was not sweet.2. Nasty white lighting.Summary: I would go here again to try something else. Not for the beef brisket."
"I LOVE barbecue.  Did I mention that I love BBQ?  Well, I love BBQ.  Ok, now that I mentioned that, I have to say that Smoque BBQ is just OK.  I have heard raving reviews for Smoque from many friends, so I finally got there last Sunday.  First, a 90 minute wait?  Really?     I got there around 5 PM on Sunday and waited approximately 90 minutes.  By the time we ordered, I was drooling! But then my disappointment started.  I ordered the St. Louis Ribs (what they're known for) and they just ran out.  RAN OUT?  I nearly cried.  If this is your specialty, how can you possibly run out?  Having to make a very quick, on-the-spot decision (there were about twenty people behind me giving me the evil stare of death), I chose a pulled pork platter.  The pulled pork was standard.  Nothing great, but standard.  The mac-and-cheese was standard, and the fries were very good.Overall, I may have gone on an off-night and I'm willing to give it another try.  But, not on a weekend.  I'll try it during the week when there is a shorter wait."
"Love this place! This has to be my new favorite BBQ place. I had the brisket, mac and cheese, coleslaw, and peach cobbler! Everything was delicious. I loved the BBQ sauce and the brisket was so juicy. We also shared an order of french fries for the table and they were great too. I will be going back!"
"I don't quite concur with a friend who calls Smoque the best BBQ in Chicago, as I don't think their ribs really even compare to Carson's, but Smoque's Chopped Brisket sandwiches is one of my favorite sandwiches in the city. Accompanied by excellent fries, it makes for a great meal at a good price ($6.95/$8.95 with slaw & one side). Their Pulled Pork is also very good, and the ribs aren't bad, just not the best I've had. Their menu doesn't run too deep--only Chicken, Texas Sausage, Sliced Brisket, Side Dishes and a Salad beyond the aforementioned--but they do what they do well, their service is good, their take home packaging is excellent and they always seem to be doing a robust business. Deservedly so."
"This place can rub and smoke me any day.  So very good.  Had Pork and St. Louis Ribs- tender, meaty, smoky and flavorful! I could not stop!  Cornbread is a wonderful mix of crunchy and moistly tender.  Macaroni is cheesy goodness and not greasy.  Beans were tangy tasty- not just beans and bbq sauce but an intricate mix of onion, beans, meaty pieces, and sauce.  The sauce is tangy and bright.  I enjoyed the slaw, just like BBQ there are many ways to do it and many opinions.  This slaw was refreshingly bright- crisp cabbage, red onions mixed with a vinegary dressing.  Staff was super friendly.Will be back  to dine there instead of just pick up and go."
1st time visit and I will be back. Not what I expected. Very friendly staff and great food. I will be back. You may want to hold onto your wallet a bit as the al-a-cart can get pricy.
"One of my besties recommended this place to me. She actually tries to go here as many times as possible in a week, so I knew something was up. I was wow'd. The barbecue brisket was so tender, the pulled pork sandwiches were super moist, and the mac n cheese??! That totally sealed the deal for me. I didn't run into a long line when I went so I was pretty lucky. I hear the lines get really long!"
"this place is all about food.ive been here at least 20-30 times since i've known this place.*food-sauce: sauces are just amazing (both vinegary and tomatoey; and you can taste these guys make their own sauces), 5 star *****-meat: briskets and pork shoulder melts in your mouth, ribs are not fall of the bone type, and that is exactly why i love their ribs so much, the perfect texture. 5 star ******serviceservice is okay as they have a lot of staff roaming around to clean tables and take orders. it gets really crowded dinner time on the weekends, so recommend take out if you are feeding more than a date. **~*** 2~3 stars*consistencyin terms of food, meat, sauce and sides are almost always consistent, (i had a few occassions when the meats were dry), but they are epic delicious if you dont mind burnt food. (by that i mean they look burnt but they are just heavy smoked) 4 star *****pricei would say the price range is perfect, for around $10~20, you can leave the place belly happy.overall, food is one of the best bbq ive had (if not the best), service/dining experience is below average, but their outstanding food makes up for it.the best bbq in chicago!recommended $10~$25*updated 08/03/13visited a few days ago, this place still rocks; i am craving some bbq now! XD"
"This place has the BEST BBQ in Chicago!  It is so good.  I've gone time and time again, and love to bring out of town friends and family to this place.  The ribs are great, as are the sides.  Super casual atmosphere with picnic tables inside.  Enjoy!"
"Sinfully delicious. After seeing this place on ""Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives"" we had to try it. I got the chicken which was cooked to perfection, and mac & cheese which was heavy but amazing. There were only two downsides for me - no alcohol with your bbq and there was not a single vegetable on the menu."
"GOTO SMOQUE, GET THE BRISKET.  THIS PLACE KICKS ASS!  it's really easy to get to.  i live in pilsen and i've been there 5 times.  if there's no traffic, just exit the kennedy at pulaski and head south 3 blocks."
"Third or maybe fourth time.  Really like everything i have had; ribs, pulled pork, brisket sides.  Darn good sauces, byob too!   Enjoy!"
"I have been here 5 times since the begining of January when I first heard about Smoque on channel 7.  Wow.  It is the best BBQ you can get in Chicago.Everything here is good.  My husband has had every type of meat on the menu except the Texas Sausage (that is being saved for the next trip).  His favorite is the chopped brisket.  Mine is the pulled pork.  Last time we went (for Valentine's Day) he got the best of both worlds 1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 chopped brisket sandwich. I have to have baked beans when I come here.  They have the perfect flavor and are infused with smoke.  The macaroni and cheese is so good too.  I like to eat a little bit and then wait for it to cool down so the cheese is not runny.  It tastes like macaroni and cheese cake!  My husband loves the peach cobbler and eats it first because that is when it tastest the best.This place is also BYOB.  And though there is quite a wait at dinner time, many people just open a beer and talk with friends while waiting in line.  It is totally worth it.The owners/managers are also extremely nice and make sure that you have a place to sit down when it's time to eat.  Everything is very organized and you know that once you get your food you won't have to wait to eat it.One problem that I've noticed, it seems as though at dinner time the only cashier has to ring up both to-go orders and sit down orders.  This takes up a lot of time and causes people to wait more than they would have to if they had a separate person ring up only to-go orders.It seems to get bussiest around 5:30 pm on the Weekend nights and around 12:00 pm for lunch.  Busy means that a line has started that goes out of the building.  I would try to go before these times to avoid a wait.Also, you get quite a bit of food and they put the sides and sandwiches in great easy-to-take-with-you to-go boxes."
"pretty damn tasty 'cue. i finally made it here a couple months back. we arrived on a saturday afternoon around 4 - no wait!! armed with an a la card and minimum $25 purchase to save $10, the boyfriend and i were faced with a carnivore's dilemma - how do we narrow down our options??so we did what any other good carnivores would do...we ordered it all. oh yeah. a half slab of ribs. tastings of sausage. tastings of brisket. tastings of pulled pork. mac and cheese. biscuits. the meatastic trays were up a matter of mere moments after we were seated and the food orgy began.what were we thinking?? we came. we tried. but we didn't conquer. but that's what doggie bags are for! and that way, we were able to relive the experience throughout the week, bite after smokey bite.what i loved:the mac and cheese side. gooey yet crunchy. well worth it.the ribs. dry rubbed so you can sauce them as you see fit. personally, i think they're better unsauced so you get the full on smokey assault of flavor.the texas sausage. who knew? sweet yet smokey. it was the dark horse at the table and definitely our favorite overall."
"YUMOLA!!!!!like i needed a new restaurant to crave food from....the brisket was stupendous but i don't think recommendations need to be given.  just go, go now...and just pick something, anything...you can't be disappointed!  it's not all just smoque and mirrors, it's deliciousness and windows."
Some is great BBQ. Hard to get seated. Worth the wait. Good sauce. Brisket is awesome. For me it's got a good smoke favor. For me it's this or Ashley in Milwaukee. Good stuff.
"OK, so was the food at Smoque worth the 45 minute wait?  ...Kinda?  I guess?  I mean, don't get me wrong.  The St. Louis style ribs were perfectly done--meaty, tender, and not swimming in fat.  The chopped brisket (yes, I got ribs with a side of brisket--you wanna make something of it?) was moist and full of flavor.  But 45 minutes in line?  Really?  When there are so many other great rib joints, even on the northwest side?  Next time, I'm definitely calling ahead.  Some things are worth the wait, but some things just require better planning.(Oh, and peach cobbler should never be made with canned peaches--are you kidding me with that?)"
"everything was excellent.... so friggin' tasty!!! If I lived a block a way from this place, my cholesterol would probably no longer be at a descent 157 ;)... drum roll.... and the list:- beef brisket. awww.... it just fell apart into juicy tender goodness. It was so good, it broke my heart.- the pulled pork. we just got a taste... I wish my stomach was 3x's bigger so it could handle more.- Best cole slaw I've ever had. Was crisp! very crisp and fresh. Can't beat that!- pork and beans were sweet and good... but nothing to go wow over. I've been spoiled by good pork and beans before... so it's just me.- mac and cheese... baked mac and cheese... was so good I ordered some to go after we left to bring to my sisters house for dinner later that night.btw, the best way to eat bbq here with your girl, is to share the delicious goodness between the both of you.My only gripe about this place... they should leave the bbq sauce's on the tables with labels so you know which bbq sauce you like and can add as much or as little as you want to your meal.""tastes so good, make you wanna..."" youtube.com/watch?v=aFsE…"
"What can I say that hasn't been said??I *always* get the brisket (usually sliced), cos if I'm eating out and paying, I'm generally gonna go beef over pork.  But don't get me wrong, the pulled pork is fab, too.My preferred sides are the corn bread and fries -- you get more fries than you know what to do with and they're a nice-thickness of fresh cut potato.  Cobbler is good, as are the beans and mac & cheese.  Cole slaw comes standard with just about every selection and is amazing -- it's vinegar based with red onions in it; and one day I'm going to re-create it in my kitchen, I swear!Brisket frequently runs out on Fri-Sun nights, so I try to go either daytime or weekday evening."
"Smoque is BBQ done right!  The food I had - brisket, baked beans, and corn bread - was amazing.  I know this is going to sound silly, but you could really taste the smoke...and that's a good thing!I was amazed by how much the staff seems to enjoy working there!  Everyone seemed to be having a great time.  They got a thumbs up in my book when I was waiting for my to-go package and made a comment to my friend that the fries looked amazing.  Before I knew it I was given a little cup full of fries to eat while I waited.  That is great service, people!The ONLY downside to this place is that seating is limited.  You have to wait in line, place your order, and then find a seat.  In terms of BBQ in Chicago, I'm certain this place is tough to beat!"
"With all the fierce competition of BBQ joints.  This place is good but is not the best in Chi Town.  For me, the best would be Honey 1 BBQ.I also did not care for the limited and tight seatings.  I'd like some elbow room while I'm pigging out."
"Ever since I saw them on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dive my hubby and I love this place.  The best ribs ever in the hood.  They are always packed always a long line any day any time.  It only tells you the food is awesome!  People kept coming back. Its so convenient for us because it nearby :)"
"The best things about this place are the price and the smell.  They have good meat and decent mac and cheese, though it was not everything some people have propped it up to be.  The sauce is way too thin though, and the cole slaw was so overly sweet that I was unable to eat it.  As seems to be a common fallacy of Chicago's BBQ joints, they did not have Texas toast.  They did have a very good soft drink selection, which sounds weird, but they have a lot to choose from.  I do have to say though that the staff was very good.  The place just didn't wow me overall like I had expected it to after reading about it online."
"In love....I'm not a huge BBQ fan but I do enjoy it on occasion. My friend/co-worker and I needed a new place to go for lunch so we decided to head on down Irving and see what the fuss was all about. I decided to have a 1/2 pulled pork sandwich, fries and peach cobbler...I know..piggy me! I could barely finish the 1/2 sandwich 1/2 of my fries and the cobbler. The fries are those delicious fresh cut friends YUM! The pulled pork was to die for just absolutely yummy!! I like that it wasn't drowned in bbq, they put sauce on the side to let you choose how much you want. The peach cobbler was average but it was good. 1/2 sandwich honestly was PLENTY!They are very organized even though it gets packed!! The guy came and got us seats and everyone was cleaning tables. it's one of those places where you have to eat and go but it's no big deal! I just read a review about it being BYOB...really?? I'll be back many more times (not just because of BYOB) but that is a cool option. First thing I did was run back here to YELP about it."
"Being featured on the Food Network definitely does not hurt business.  Especially when the episode of Diners, Drive ins & Dives has aired twice already (by the way I am convinced the host of that show Guy Fieri--is going to die of a heart attack--sheesh!).  Went there after seeing the show & cannot say I was disappointed.  The food is absolutely tasty, the portions are very generous & the prices are decent for BBQ.  Have tried the brisket, baby back ribs, St. Louis Ribs, and the pulled pork--all of it is great.  Although I have come to the conclusion that I prefer baby back ribs to the St. Louis kind.  All meals come with sides & corn bread (YUM!).  The sides are delicious from the mac n cheese to the fries.  If you are watching what you eat--you may want to consider eating somewhere else--this is not light by any means.You may want to consider taking the food to go as the place gets uber crowded & it rather small on the inside.  Also, try & get there early or else you will be standing in one long line.  This joint is pretty casual & the seating is not the best--it is like a cafeteria with long tables where you can sit right on top of people.  If you don't mind that, I say check them out--you probably wont be sorry."
"Finally took a little trip to Smoque BBQ on a Sunday afternoon (11:45am) and it was busy but not lines out the door busy.  Was able to find parking in the back lot. Big blackboard for the menu. Boyfriend and I ordered the St. Louis Ribs and Brisket. I am in love with the Brisket! This was my 1st time trying it and not my last! Soo yummy and tender, melt in your mouth good! The ribs were pretty yummy too but I have had other ribs that I like better. Sides got the mac and cheese it was yummy, fries were good too! Tried the peach cobbler.. didn't really care for it but my boyfriend enjoyed it. The seating is kind of cramped but they do a good job of seating people."
"Picked up some brisket and a half slab of the St. Louis style ribs a week ago.  I think the brisket was great again.  I actually thought it was better than the other 10 times I have gotten it from there.  It did not have much of a smoke ring but it was so tender you could cut it with a spoon.I got the ribs just to see if I would like them, and again, I was not a fan.  They are dry and don't have a ton of flavor.  I prefer ribs that are moist and I tend to like sauce a lot so please take my comment for what it's worth, it's not a bash in anyway."
I took my girl here based on a recommendation. I found that the seating was crampy. I mean elbow to elbow crampy. That turned me off the most. The the food was average and pricey. I'd say this is a place to chill and have a meal but not a place to go if you want to make an impression.
"i've been to smoque a few times, and every time its a little piece of bbq heaven.their brisket is some of the best i've ever had, anywhere. and i love the peach cobbler, not too sweet and just the right amount to end your meal with. the ribs were delicious and juicy, though i didn't like the st. louis cut as well. the mac n cheese is so good, never too salty, and it had that little bit of bread crumb on the top and the noodles are always cooked perfect.the line is always out the door, but its always worth the wait"
"I know a BBQ place has promise when they serve BBQ on butcher paper rather than plates. Another sign that it might be good is a stack of wood in the back. Smoque is a very good BBQ place that doesn't try to do everything, but what it does, it does pretty well. Brisket, pork or ribs come in either sandwich form or just meat on paper. Sweet tea is always a great pairing with BBQ, so is BYOB...haha Parking however can be a little tough."
"I haven't been back to this place since shortly after it opened, as the line lately is too long to justify eating there.  Whenever I want to go, I never seem to have the time to wait.  Maybe I'll make some on my birthday this year.I first heard about this place in Chicagoist.  The review caught my eye when they called Smoque out for its pretentious name and painted-on faux-bbq shack chic.  They wanted desperately to give them a bad review, but had to remain honest when they tried the food.I couldn't help but get a bit everything the first time.  The brisket was as good as I remember from Texas.  The ribs came easily off the bone but weren't soggy with too much sauce. The chicken came out of the oven black as night but was as tender and white on the inside as Britney Spears.Throw in some crumbly corn-muffins and gooey, doughy, crusty-baked peach cobbler, and you have yourself a line out the door from open to close, every single day of the week.  Bring some Shiner Bock to this BYOB.I look forward to going back.  I hope success hasn't changed them."
Ewwwww!!! My BBQ ribs had a taste & smell of gasoline!!!
"Hands down the best Brisket this side of Texas -- just make sure you get it sliced and not chopped.  The brisket is already ""fork tender"" and that's with plastic forks so if you get it chopped it turns out a bit mushy.The sides are yummy as well; I especially like the peach cobbler and the mac and cheese.  The fries are fresh cut and large enough to share with a friend.What's not to like?  It's very busy -- especially during during the lunch hour so it can take quite a while to be seated.  If you go with a group larger than 3 or 4, expect to stand around a long time (i.e. 30 min) waiting for a table."
"This place was recommended by a friend that grew up in Oklahoma and spent some time in Texas. I also spent a year working in Dallas, and I'd like to say that it is a very representative version of Texas-style BBQ.I had a pulled pork platter, which came with an ample amount of pork. an extra side of sauce and 'slaw and 2 sides. The slaw was okay, but you may find that the two sides are a bit smaller than you may think. I had the mac and cheese, and the cornbread. Both were excellent, but a bit undersized considering you just forked over about 2 Lincolns.The pulled pork itself? Dee-licious! Soft, juicy and tender like it was meant to be, with a decent amount of sauce as well.There is ample seating space, and some parking within the neighborhood. If you happen to be there when the dental office next door is closed, you should be able to use the back (west of the building) parking lot as well.It can be a breeze to get to, if you take 90/94 to get here, since it's right of the Pulaski exit. A solid option, depending on where you live."
A must stop if you are looking for BBQ. A big fan of the sides: mac-n-cheese and the cornbread.
"It was Dad's birthday and he loves BBQ - so I suggested we order in from Smoque. We tried EVERYTHING: the brisket, pulled pork, St. Louis ribs, mac & cheese, beans, corn bread, fries and the peach cobbler.Both the brisket and the pulled pork were so tender and smokey, they come with sauce on the side. A thinner, less sweet type of sauce. Eh, i like the thick, sweet goopy stuff - but this was still tasty. I'm not a huge fans of beans, but these were fantastic with huge chunks of meat in them. Everybody seems to love the mac & cheese and it does not disappoint. The cornbread, fries and peach cobbler were good, although the cornbread was a little dry.Dad enjoyed his birthday dinner and I'm glad we ordered in - that place was packed with a line out the door. Solid good BBQ."
"They should change the name of this place to Smoqueue.Get it? ""queue"" - as in a line of people waiting? I kill me.Seriously, all you meatheads need to stop raving about this place. You're making it impossible for the rest of us to get in. At least until the owners wise up and move to a larger location with more reasonable parking rules.But if you do go, make sure it's on a night I'm not going, and get carryout. The dining room has all the ambience of a prison cafeteria."
"Just go.  I grew up in Georgia where barbeque and SEC football are the real religions, and Smoque is the closest I've come to the slow smoked deliciousness that comes from ""down South""I think the greatest strength of Smoque is that they pay homage to all the greats of the barbeque genre.Their brisket is pure Texas.  Slow smoked, tender, and juicy.  The ribs are straight out of St. Louis with a delicious dry rub.  Have the sauce on the side and try 'em ""dry"" so to speak.  Don't let the sauce obscure the amazing flavors of smoke, and the lip-smacking unctiousness of the pork.  And the pulled pork tastes almost exactly like the style from my hometown in Georgia.  I also think that as far as thick sauces go, Smoque's got one of my fav's.  It's not the syrupy sweet super thick sauce that you wind up buying at the supermarket, nor is it the thin vinegar and mustard based sauce of my childhood.  It's it own beast of delicious tangy flavor with a hint of sweetness.  I like to tear down my rack of ribs and dip just a bit in the sauce, so that I get a hint of the sweetness to accentuate the savory.  So do what I said in the first sentence.  Just go.PostScriptum:  ""Just go"" early.  If you go too late, you get to the front door and see a sign listing what they're out of.  Only restaurant I've ever been to that has to do this on a regular basis."
"They have the best dry ribs, brisket and mac and cheese. Great prices and if you go during the week night you can avoid the large crowds and long lines."
"Yes! A barbecue joint by my place! I was so excited to check it out but after experiences with them, I can only sum it up as a ""just OK"" place.The first thing I like to try when I find a new BBQ joint is their tips and links combo. So I look up at the huge chalkboard menu trying to find it....not on the menu?! Impossible! After a couple of minutes of careful study of the board, I had to settle for the half baby back, half St. Louis rib dinner. Then I found out that they can, and do run out of food for the day. I was told they were out of baby back ribs. So I settle for the St. Louis ribs. And I was not impressed. The rub on the ribs was only OK. The meat itself was just OK. I smelled the sauce that comes on the side. Smelled great, so I poured it on my ribs. And it proceeded to run all down my fingers onto my hands. The darn sauce is too thin! Not cool. Hopefully it'll wake up the flavor of the meat. I took a bite of the sauce-soaked meat, and it was a tad bit better. But I'd have to say that it's best to stay away from the ribs, at least the St. Louis ones.I faired a lot better the second time around. I'm not a fan of pulled pork, so I ordered the sliced brisket sandwich. Best beef brisket sandwich I've had so far. The meat was delicious and cooked to perfection.I have to give them props for the mac and cheese. It is awesome! Too bad they give you so little of it. I'll have to order an extra next time. And the cole slaw was fresh, tasty, and zesty. I prefer a creamy slaw, but their slaw was very good. The fries instantly reminded me of Jimmy's fries, except, they were not as good as Jimmy's.The place is not very pleasing to the eyes, if you care to dine in. That, and their limited parking means my future trips here are for take-out only (and only for the brisket sandwich with mac & cheese)."
5 reasons why Smoque is my new favorite BBQ place:1. ribs taste like real outdoor firewood grilling.2. Mac &amp; Cheese... OH YES PLEASE.3. order here/ pick up here ordering style4. BYOB5. finally something on the NW side.
"So I first start by saying I come from a mommy and daddy that both lived in South Carolina, St Louis, and a final destination of Kansas City.  We are some bbq folks.I was super excited about smoque cuz it smelled so tasty and I've only heard great things.  Was I super duper impressed? nopeDid I realize that the bbq sauce is tomato paste and A-1? yupCan the moms make better cornbread/beans/peach cobbler? yesireeThe staff was attentive and friendly and I did see the owner running around, so all's good there.I will say that the boyfriend liked the pulled pork and the cole slaw."
"oh man! finally went here after my BBQ connoisseur friends kept raving about it. it was not as i expected in terms of set-up. it was totally packed and kinda cafeteria style. you wait in line and a busboy asks each person in line how many are in their party...and by the time you get up to the front and order, he already has a spot waiting for you. it's very tight quarters, so if you hate people or get clausterphobic, it's probably not for you. but the food is ready quickly and wow!!! it is SO delicious that you'll forget your surroundings. the brisket and st louis ribs will make your eyes roll back. even if you find the sauce is not your style, the BBQ offerings are absolute perfection. even the side items and peach cobbler are fantastic. deserves all the praise it gets."
"I came here once and I fell in love. One of my fave thing to get are the baby back ribs. That's what I usually get there but I felt like trying something different. So i tried the 1/2 and 1/2, a lil bit of pull pork and slice brisket. omg! it was sooooooo good!!! If you like bbq, this is the place to be. Although the dine-in experience is like a lunch room, but if you only care about the food then it wouldnt matter.  I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic date."
"Smoque catered our Holiday kickoff party and I was blown away! I had no idea that scrumptious beef brisket was available north of Kentucky! Our selection for the event was pretty basic, but sometimes that's all we need! -Beef Brisket (tender, flavorful, just the right amount of smoke flavoring) -Pulled Pork (moist and not over pulled) -Macaroni & Cheese (Cheesy, rich, and distinctive home made flavor) -Individual Corn Cakes (each caked was baked in it's own tin cup with a slight sweetness from the whole kernel corn) -Cole Slaw/Salad (basic, simple and complimented the rest of the meal)Delightful! I'm craving it right now as I'm typing!"
"Best pulled pork...sides are money....really, everything is good.  Oh, and feel free to bring your own brews (BYOB)!"
"Smoque BBQ is without a doubt the best BBQ joint you can possibly find in the Chicago area.Of course, that isn't necessarily saying much. Many Chicagoans have considered a full slab of ribs cooked in an oven and slathered in sweet and sticky BBQ sauce to be actual ""BBQ"". As a result, there are very few restaurants that serve REAL BBQ, which requires several hours of slowly smoking various types of meat (Pork Shoulder, Ribs, and Brisket) at a low temperature.While it can't be said that the food at Smoque can truly compare to the stuff you can find in, say, Kansas City, it's more than good enough to satisfy both connoisseurs and newcomers to BBQ, and you'll find a little bit of everything on the menu. How about a Texas style sliced brisket sandwich with a side of BBQ Beans? Or a slab of St. Louis style ribs with fresh cut french fries and mac and cheese? Everything, whether it was an entree or a side, was consistently fabulous each time I went. Unless you're not into smoky tasting food or meat in general, there's really nothing to complain about.The service was minimal (you wait in line to order and then pick it up when your number is called), but the staff was incredibly friendly. Prices are a tad on the expensive side and it can get pretty busy in the late afternoon and evening, so try to eat here early if you can. Unless you hate the concept of BBQ, you won't be disappointed."
Awesome ribs. We had a hard time deciding whether we preferred St. Louis or baby back.
"This is the best place for ribs in Chicago, very busy with lines out the door but worth the wait.Dr. Richard G. Leyba"
We picked up some pulled pork and some brisket for a concert at Ravinia.  We also got some baked beans and cole slaw.I can't say enough about how fantastic the pulled pork was.  It was juicy and tasty and complex.  The barbecue sauce was tart and vinegary and really perfect.  I thought the baked beans were great too.  The brisket was well cooked and tasty.  I'll pass on the cole slaw next time though.
so good j'all.
"Great smoked food, what else can i say!"
"Good ol BBQ.  Small hole in the wall with some darn good food.  The sauces are good the beans are good and I liked all of the meats, although my brisket was a little bit dry.  The cornbread could use a little bit of work but the pulled pork was one of the best Ive had."
"We parked down the street in a residential neighboorhood and as we opened the door, we could smell the smoke. The food was delicious. I really wanted to try the St Louis ribs but there was a sign at the register stating ""due to quality concerns, we are currently not serving St Louis Ribs"", which totally bummed me out. I had the 1/2 slab baby backs meal with came with the best slaw I ever had and 2 sides. I chose the BBQ beans and mac & cheese.  The beans were amazing. My husband had the pulled pork meal with slaw, BBQ chili, and corn bread. I also orded a ""taste"" of their brisket. The brisket melted in my mouth. The sauces were on the sweeter side and the brisket sauce was thinner and I even drank it out of the cup. I can't wait to go back. Dinner with 2 sodas cost us $37, but it was worth every penny."
"Anyone who doesn't eat meat, please stop reading....Smoque BBQ is hands down the best BBQ I have ever decided to put in my mouth.  From the amazingly charred chopped brisket, to the incredibly tender and smoky pulled pork, followed by the heavenly pairing of beans and brisket pieces, to the sinful sampling of peach cobbler, this was the ultimate feast.  And don't forget the insanely low prices.Even on a dull Sunday afternoon the line was out the door, but moved rather quickly despite everyone savoring each bite.  The owners know their food is this good, and are willing to accommodate any particular wish of their devoted clientele, helping everyone choosing to dine-in find a comfortable table.The famous saying, ""Where there's smoke, there's fire,"" can now officially be changed to ""Where there's smoque, there's happiness."""
"one of the best briskets in Chicago.  pieces containing the edges or ""bark"" are money!"
"As a New Englander, I am probably the least likely person to review a BBQ joint, but when have I ever let that stop me before.Coming from a BBQ neutral region, I have no bias and I really enjoy Smoque.  I love how I can get pulled pork, St. Louis style ribs, and brisket under one roof.  Their sides are spot on too.  Get the beans - you won't be disappointed.The combo platters are good and I also really enjoy the fact that you can get cheap sampler sizes to supplement your order.The line can be long, but it moves quickly.  They do a decent job of keeping order.  The space isn't that large, so you may be rubbing elbows with your neighbor, but that's a small price to pay for BBQ this good.Smoque may not be able to solve the regional BBQ war, but it succeeds in giving everybody a fair shot."
"Food was OK.  My boyfriend loved the brisquet,  His ribs were average.  My pulled pork was just OK.  No real complaints about the food, but the atmosphere sucks.  We waited in a long line to eat at a place with as much personality as a Taco Bell.  I'd rather hunt for parking at Smoke Daddy's and have a beer and maybe listen to some music.I would have to submit this place as one of the most white washed places I've been to in a while. It felt really suburban.  On top of that, we had to listen to two guys next to us use the phrase ""amazing"" at least half a dozen times.  Really, amazing?  They must not eat out much.  If you live nearby, go, and take the food to go.  Otherwise, eat at a place closer to home. Or grill some meat yourself."
"I discovered this place after a coworker suggested it. I then came over to Yelp to find over 300 reviews, how could I have missed this place. I decided to have lunch. I ordered the 1/2 pulled pork sandwich. For being a 1/2 size it was just right for lunch. The pulled pork was very good. I really liked the sauce. The sauce wasn't too sweet it was just right. The sauce had a great mix of flavors. I decided to get the beans as my side. They were excellent! Great flavor and just the right texture. The other side that came with the sandwich was the coleslaw. I normally like the creamy style better, but this tangy and not creamy coleslaw was really good. I can't wait to try some of the other foods offered. I really like ribs, so that will be my future taste. The interior was nice and had a good down to earth plain decor. The people were very nice and helpful. They did a good job of managing the flow of people. One thing to know. I passed the place by. It doesn't have a big flashy sign out front if your coming from the Kennedy. I went around the block and did find it after looking more carefully. I will be returning to try other food. I will also be bringing along other BBQ fans to try the food."
"Damn good BBQ!  I know it's kinda hard to do bad BBQ, but we had Smoque's pulled pork and Carolina BBQ sauce at our XMas party and it was superb."
I don't like the over use of onions in a few of their dishes but if I liked onions then I would like those dishes too! Keep going back to Smoque...and it's a LONG drive! It's unique. The owners hang around all the time...which usually means that they care...and that the food will maintain it's quality.Did I mention that it's pretty easy to find parking. I will add more details later. Now go get yourself some SMOQUE BBQ!!!
"I'm from Texas and have spent my fair share of time in Memphis as well. I can say that this place is legit. They have great dry rub ribs and moist brisket. The sides were every bit as impressive as the BBQ itself. I had the BBQ beans, which are a meal in themself, and the mac and cheese - both were awesome. I went in a large group of people and heard the same impressive feedback on the peach cobbler. Try Smoque, you will not be disappointed."
"Have you ever contemplated working at a particular restaurant just to be closer to the food you loved?  I've often thought of approaching the owners of Smoque and asking them if they would pay me in barbecue.  You can't go wrong with this place.  You can order anything off the menu and be salivating while eating because it's that good  Let's start off with the sides.  I never was a baked beans fan, but now I'm a believer.  Their brisket chili is killer awesome, their Texas sausage is spicy and delicious and their homemade mac-n-cheese makes me want to cry tears of joy.Main Course?  Their St. Louis ribs are so tender and marinated to perfection that the meat just pulls away from the bone.  Their brisket is just as tender and so wonderful.  Not to mention, they do everything right with their barbecue sauce.  Sometimes I envision just slathering their barbecue sauce on everything I eat...The place is always packed, so you may be standing in a small to rather large line.  One time, we had called in an order to pick up at 5:30pm, but they told us it wouldn't be ready till 7pm.  When we got there, the line was out the door and around the side of the building.  I was so glad we called for take out, but I would have stood in line for this barbecue.This place is a definite must.  And if you find out if they will pay me in barbecue, please let me know."
still can't forget this small restaurants even after 3 months. taste good. will come next time.
"The best brisket I've ever had. Seriously amazing. The sauces are also very good, but really, it's the meat preparation that shines. Plus it's byob, which makes me wish I could give it six stars."
"Um, HELLO?  Where have I been?  Why haven't I tried this place before?  My loss.  Went to Smoque because my BF went to grade school with the owner. OMG, can I say DELICIOUS?!?!  So we each order 1/2 sandwich & 1 side - I got the chopped brisket and fries and he got the pulled pork & mac-n-cheese. I have never had a better BBQ brisket sandwich! As we're digging into that we are treated to a full slab of ribs and some of the spicy texas saaaaaasage. I have to say that neither of us are a fan of eating meat off of the bone but the ribs were awesome!  The rub had the perfect blend of sweet & smoky flavors.  The sauce is amazing - If I could buy a vat of it to take home with me I would. To end our meal we had the peach cobbler.  YUM!  I highly recommend Smoque but get there early because it's a popular place.  WELL worth the wait and the line goes quickly!"
I've been craving that damn pulled pork! Its so darn good that I've been wanting to drive up that way to get me some food. The place is a cute small restaurant. Kinda cool you get to sit almost in a lunchroom Atmosphere. Its a cool BYOB so this is a must to bring some beer or whatever it is you like to eat w/your BBQ. Thanks to a buddy of mine I'm a fan of this place. Yah to pulled pork!
"It's ok. I really can't tell how this place is considered so fabulous.  It seems a tad bit overrated.  I sent my husband to buy me something for take out when I was pregnant and he said he waited in line for an hour just to order.  The food was ok, not great.  I don't understand the hype."
"if you wait past 5pm or so on a weekend prepare to wait in a long line that snakes out the door, but its well well worth it.Pulled pork, St.louis Ribs, Brisket are all awesome and its hard to decide what to get so I try to get it all. Dont forget the mac and cheese side and the french fries. I believe I'm addicted."
"I haven't been this pleased with BBQ in a LONG time!  I took my boyfriend (originally from Kansas City) there for his birthday last night, and it was truly the gift that keeps on giving: a new favorite BBQ place!  I love that this place follows the rule of  ""Nothing to Hide, Sauce on the Side"" and they do it well. I will admit, the portions of the sides (cornbread instead of slaw and mac & cheese) were small but tasted really good, and the fries were good & plenty of them.  BYOB - love it!  Can't wait to try their sandwiches!"
"Unbelievable brisket.  Unfortunately they didn't have St. Louis ribs available the day we went.  Sort of out of the way.  We took a bus there from Wrigley and walked a few blocks.  Good food, no wait."
"Want to impress your out-of-town friends?  Bring them to Smoque. Everything on the menu is as good as you will find at any barbecue place, and that's what makes Smoque so impressive. You can find some great  barbecue and side dishes at a lot of places in the Chicago area, but Smoque is the only place that has them all together. A must experience for your out-of-town visitors! Also, you will never find brisket better than this!"
Worth the trip up north and the line when we got there.  Ribs are amazing and sides are great.
BRISKET!!! It was delicious.  I am proud Smoque exists in Chicago. There is often a line and some phone orders may take 1 hour for pick up... it is well worth it. Try everything and leave happy.
"Some of the best ribs in the nation. From all my travels, I would say it comes down to Smoque in Chicago or Sticky Fingers in Chattanooga TN. Both offering some of the best dry rub I've ever tasted.This place is a BYOB, you can get a rack and sides for less than $20. They do offer a 1/2 and 1/2, which is a half rack of baby backs and a half rack of St Louis style.Service is very friendly.Be patient as there is probably going to be a line, it moves rather fast. Understand that your not going to be the only family in the mood for great ribs in the city. Not always a line, but usually around dinner time."
"After reading about this place on yelp, I decided to check it out, as I love BBQ.  I got the sampler plate with pulled pork, brisket, and ribs.  I found the brisket a little dry and the ribs weren't very tender.  The pork, however, was very tasty.  The sauce was good, with a nice smoky flavor.The service was very good.  Although there is a small seating area and it was crowded for lunch, the staff was very friendly and found a place for myself, wife, and son with a high chair.  Overall decent BBQ, but there are better places much closer to where I live."
"Soooo good! The BBQ is amazing, and any side of cornbread and mac n cheese is a good bet in my book. I even loved the cole slaw, and I'm not usually a fan. This was more vinegar based (less creamy) but it was awesome!"
"Things seemed a bit ""off"" the last time I dined here.  The St. Louis ribs were a bit dry and the peach cobbler was not as good as it normally is. This still won't keep me away from what I consider to be the best in the region."
"Great, great food!  I got the 1/2 brisket 1/2 pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and fries.  This was definitely some of the best pork and brisket I've had.  The fries portion was huge and were so good.  My friend got the Mac & Cheese, which did taste good...but it was a super mini portion, so I was glad I got the fries.  It was a good price and quick.  Can't wait to go back!"
Great BBQ!!!! Delicious mac-n-cheese! Love love love this place!
"I can't heap enough praise on Smoque and their catering team. We hired them to cater our rehearsal dinner of 20, and absolutely everything they did was awesome. Their office team was efficient and on top of all the little details, and their delivery guy was quick, kind, and on time. In terms of the food, how could you go wrong?! The prices were the most reasonable we found, especially considering the quality of the food. The big hits for everyone were the sausage, the brisket, and the baked beans. We had more than enough food for everyone. Excellent all the way around!"
"No ambiance here, but who cares? They treat you great! They make sure you get a table, they come around and ask how your food is, you really get the feeling they want you to enjoy yourself here. And the food....THE FOOD! Oh my gaaaaaaad, the sliced brisket is so tender you can cut it with a plastic fork. The ribs are fantastic, the sides are excellent (especially the smokey beans and mac & cheese) and I have to say it was the best cole slaw I've ever had. It almost tasted like cabbage salad with a vinaigrette. None of that soupy, creamy dressing. All in all this place was a smashing success with me and my dinner partner. We both loved it and plan to go back for the pulled pork and the hot links. I think I'll have to order them in addition to that brisket, though, because I simply must have that again!"
"I've heard a lot about Smoque. But I was skeptical. Could it be as good as Fat Willey's (hands down my favorite BBQ in Chicago)? We decided to stop by on a whim and get carryout. The place was hoppin'. You order at the counter to get your food, and while there was a line at 5pm on a Sunday, the orders were coming up quick. I got my food in about 5 minutes after ordering even though it was packed.To give it due diligence, I ordered the full slab of ribs (1/2 baby back, 1/2 St. Louis style) with sides of mac and cheese and cornbread.We consumed and digested, and now the verdict is in. I have to say Smoque is every bit as good as Fat Willey's and that it might be a tie as to which I like better. Actually, I would have to have the ribs side by side to make a final decision.But the thing I like about Smoque are the options you have. Picking your sides is great, because the mac and cheese was really good, though I probably wouldn't want a large order of it. And the cornbread was tasty. Only the slaw was average.The ribs were great, both styles. The sauce was good, but did not overpower the meat. And the fact that you can get a half and half order is cool. Also-BIG PLUS-for $3 extra, you can get a side of beef brisket or pulled pork. I am always in the dilemma of whether I want brisket or just ribs, and this option solved my problem, and for the $3 you definitely get enough to make it worth it. The brisket was excellent as well.The place itself was actually not what I pictured at all. For some reason, I thought it was going to be somewhat more upscale (which for BBQ and the location,  I'm not sure why I thought this).But in fact the inside is as casual and bare bones as it gets. It's all about the food. There are dozens of small tables pushed together to make for a communal, get to know your neighbor, kind of experience.Everyone seemed friendly as well.There were people and kids of all kinds eating here and ordering to go.As far as ambiance, I may prefer Fat Willey's because it is a little more sit down, though casual, and they have outdoor seating and beer. But Smoque has it's own thing going too, and you may prefer to just order your food at the counter, rather than have someone waiting on you.Now the next time I need BBQ, it will be a tough decision. Willey's or Smoque?"
"As I was walking home Wednesday morning hammered (cubs game, plus lots of post game drinking). I decided that I was probably going to be hung over when I woke up.  Perfect hangover food is bbq.  Food from this place is as perfect as it gets when you have a hangover.   Writing this review is making my eyes mist up.  I miss this place already.I ordered the brisket platter, which came with two sides.  The brisket is perfectly cooked with a little bit of charring.  It was melt in my mouth good.  The portion was huge and I though I would have left over, but nope all gone.  My first side was Mac n Cheese.  All I'm going to say is this is the BEST Mac n Cheese this man has ever had.  I would marry this stuff if it would have me.  The baked beans didn't stand a chance against the cheesy goodness.  The Mac was crusted on the top and once you broke through the top it was pure cheese bliss.  I bought a large to take home with me it's that good.   The beans had little bits of brisket in them and were tasty.    The price was perfect 12 bucks for all that food, coleslaw and a drink.  The place was very clean and the staff was very friendly.  I will say it gets crowded in there, but believe me the line could be down the block, in the blistering heat and I would wait like a little puppy ready to stuff my face."
"I finally tried this place after hearing about it.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of bbq beans and cornbread.  The portions they give is just about right.  I have not had the ribs or beef brisket and maybe I will give then more stars after I taste more items on the menu.  I found the pulled pork to be average and the sauce was just ok.  The best part of my meal was the bbq beans.  I am rating this place solely on the meal I had, and I must say Ive tasted many pulled pork sandwiches better than theirs. This place is ok, but I wouldnt go out of my way just to have it."
Best BBQ ever! Get the St. Louis ribs for sure - and then get everything else!
"First of all, highfalutin restaurant owner -- learn to spell: the word 'smoke' doesn't have a Q. It doesn't have a U either.S-M-O-K-EGot it?Now we can get on to the BBQ. It's definitely tasty and tender and all you'd come to expect from seeing it on TV or in the myriad local magazine and newspaper articles. It lives up to its hype.I got a beef brisket sandwich with corn bread and coleslaw.The brisket was the star of the culinary show on my plate, and all I can really say is that it's good. Anything would be good after you smoke cook it for fifteen hours, I guess -- so this is actually above and beyond good.Hard to really say anything else about it. You just have to try it for yourself. Take confidence in knowing that I like BBQ, and this is a truly delicious specimen.I also liked the coleslaw. Normally I hate coleslaw. But at Smoque it is the tangy brother to the brisket. Also the cornbread is good. It's all good.Dining room's kind of small and like, 'blah'. I imagine you'd have hard luck going there for lunch rush. Food tops atmosphere and service, which is fine in a place like this -- but with a little more care to detail and service, it could be an astonishing place to eat BBQ. Right now it's just good.Just good.PRO TIP: If you plan on ordering fries, make sure you bring like twenty people to help you finish them. They give you lots of fries."
it's just ok.  ribs were too dry. pulled pork and coleslaw were just ok.  bbq sauce was nothing special
"The brisket was to die for! I've never had brisket that is so tender that it melts in my mouth. Excellent flavor. Didn't care much for the vinegary BBQ sauce on the side. Also had the Mac & cheese, which was delightful. Excellent slaw too."
"Is there anything worse than really looking forward to eating at a restaurant all day, arriving three hours before they close and having 2/3 of the menu unavailable?  I mean it's 7:00pm !!  Come on.Let's see. ""I'll have the St Louis Ribs!"" Nope.Okay, ""I'll have the brisket I've heard so much about."" NOT.Other Yelpers suggest that Smoque is going to convert Chicagoans to St Louis Ribs?!?!?!  With what, pictures of St Louis Ribs? They could put up huge posters of these fabled, yet unavailable, ribs so you could know what you wouldn't be eating that night. Or, maybe a coloring book would work better?Average baby-backs ribs which were frankly fairly dry and overcooked.  Needed to slather on tons of bbq sauce to make them a little bit moist.Other ideas.  Think it's time to change locations, find an extra 5000 sq. ft. of seating and expand the kitchen.  Add multiple cash registers and segregate the huge lines from the tables so people who are seated and eating don't have someone standing inches from their food.  Also, I'm also sure they'd love to get a liquor license and start serving beer with their food.  BYOB is such a pain.Sadly, Smoque BBQ does not even come close to the hype surrounding it.  Extra star is for very friendly, attentive service."
"2.5Having sworn off pork and beef for a decade and a half, I probably should have not have come to Smoque w/ the expectations that I had.  (One can't help but to read reviews and then to generalize.)  In any case, I had the half chicken w/ the mac and cheese and fries.  The chicken was pretty average.  The BBQ sauce was pretty mediocre in my opinion.  The mac and cheese, which comes in a small foil tin, and fries were also fairly average.  I couldn't rave about the sides or the chicken or the sauce or the prices, putting this place a little under a 3 in my eyes.  As we ate, my friend remarked that he felt like a cow.  I thought perhaps this was related to his meal (though in retrospect that made no sense since the portions are what I think is being called ""sensible"" these days).  It turns out that he was referring to the process of ordering and getting seated.  You slowly mosey up to the counter, place your order, go to the seating police, who then directs you to a table.  You then get to rub elbows w/ other patrons -- yes, I mean physically -- while you eat.  And that's if the table police is not too busy spraying the table right next to yours to turn it over for new neighbors.  (My arm actually got misted a bit.)The people there are really nice though, and I did appreciate the manager/owner? coming around and asking about our food."
"After years of using Yelp, this is my first review because I was compelled to share how great my experience at Smoque was tonight.  It was my second time there, and I'd been anticipating this meal for almost a year.In short, we ordered everything on the menu and everything was absolutely delicious.  The brisket was juicy and smokey, though unfortunately, we ordered the sandwich, which soaked up most of the moisture; order the platter.  The pulled pork was moist, soft and had just the right amount of sauce.  The ribs were perfectly done.  My personal favorite were the baby backs, which had the right combination of smoke and sweetness.  I don't think we used the sauce more than once.  The Texas sausage was a bit underwhelming, but went better with the sauce than the ribs did.The best part of the evening was that, near the end of our meal, another couple asked us (very politely) if we were almost done, so they could have our seat (the place was very packed and there was a line outside the door for seating).  Apparently, the staff thought that their intrusion was worth giving us 2 free peach cobblers to go, even though we did not complain or show any hint of being offended.  This is service at its best.I would recommend Smoque to anyone looking for excellent BBQ and even better service (and that is saying a lot, considering that the food is absolutely amazing)."
"It never ceases to amaze me how BBQ is truly the great divider.  I did lunch at smoque with a group of co-workers when it first opened.  Like most BBQ places smoque specializes in southern style comfort dishes in this case memphis and texas. The brisket seemed to be a favorite and one of my coworkers was immediately in love with it. The sides are standard- mac n cheese, cornbread, coleslaw, bbq beans.  I had the chicken entree- which was tender and moist.  The sauce was great ( I'm no bbq purist).  The baked beans were thick and sweet- really baked!  And the coleslaw was cold and fresh and tangy.   The service is fast and the food is fresh.  I couldn't afford to come here for lunch everyday but it was a nice treat. It's a good meal that will leave you full, comfortable and ready for a nap.  After the meal I came back to work and made a cup of black tea to stay awake at my desk."
"You know a place is cooking up some mean BBQ when you can smell the smoque (sic) down the street.  This place definitely lived up to all the hype!  The brisket is very smokey with a perfectly charred exterior.  Most of the sides come in foil cups (including the corn bread!?!) which was somewhat surprising but I'm sure helps them keep the line moving.  The coleslaw was pretty bland, but the sweet and smokey beans definitely made up for it.We didn't realize it was a counter service restaurant, but we ended up liking it.  We got there about 6:45 on a Friday night and were through the line is less than 20 mins.  The line seemed to stay the same length while we were there, but seating was definitely becoming a problem by 7:30.  When we go again we'll definitely aim to get there before 7, and plan for a fairly short meal.  It is BYOB which is nice, especially since beer is perfect for washing down smokey brisket.  The liquor store down the street sold mostly American macrobrews and Polish imports, so my preference would be to bring beer rather than planning to pick it up when you're there.Favorite dish:  Chopped brisket with baked beans"
"Yummy!I am a southerner and you get 5 stars for Yummy BBQ, yummy mac and cheese, and SWEET TEA!  Everybody should serve sweet tea!  I would never eat in but I will for sure carry out!"
"I have eaten here several times for lunch since it's located very close to my work, and I have yet to be disappointed. I love the Brisket very moist and tender with the pulled pork being second choice for me. I also love the vinegar based sauce, yum!  I generally call ahead of time to pick up so even with a line, waiting has not been an issue for me yet. Still looking forward to trying the ribs!"
"I just found out that I am allergic to wheat - so gluten free.  Eating out has been a challenge to say the least.  Smoque was awesome - When I mentioned to someone that I had allergies, they sent someone to speak with me and then he went into the kitchen to make sure they knew what was going on.  The food was delicious - hand cut fries, brisket, and pulled pork - so yummy.  I am kicking myself for not bringing home more pork to make some pork nachos!  Plus I was expecting a horrible wait (8pm on Friday) and it was less than 15 minutes!Such a fantastic experience - thanks for being gluten friendly!"
Delish! The pulled pork is great although the last time I had it it was a bit fatty. Mac n cheese is yummy!
Great Food and Great Prices
"The fact that barbecue from Smoque is the only thing I could keep down the day after Yelp prom must count for something.As a native Kansas Citian, barbecue is programmed into my consciousness somewhere deep inside me. When I smell a meat smoker working its magic, I waft along on its drifts of deliciousness like a cartoon character until I'm in the door and chowing down.It also makes me instant friends with any owner of a barbecue restaurant and makes me feel, even in the throes of the worst hangover of my life, like I should suck it up, eat myself retarded and like it. Hard.Well. This was not difficult at Smoque. The whole staff, including the woman at the register who could barely speak because of her allergies, was incredibly sweet and understood that it was nothing personal that I couldn't remain standing long enough to get a good look at the menu.Once my friend (the impeccable Daniel R.) and I were seated at our table, rocking out to our amazing barbecue -- him a half slab of ribs, me a pulled pork and brisket sandwich and a huge BRICK of fries -- an employee who knew we were from the superior barbecue capital of the world came to ask us how the food was.And I continued rocking out. As in. Threw up the rock. Devil horns. Metal. AWESOME.Go there, hangover or not, and be floored by the awesomeness. Rock out."
"NOTE: MOST BBQ JOINTS IN CHICAGO SUCK! Wise-up, people: Chicago is not a BBQ city...it's really not. Break out of Chicago once and while!As a Kansas Citian, I have rediculously high standards for many things, BBQ included, of course. Having said that, Smoque is the best BBQ joint I have found in Chicago. Even farther away than Kuma's Corner, but again, your taste buds will thank you!"
"Don't really love BBQ, and LOVE this place. Food is delicious. Portions are huge, and service is quick. Be prepared to wait in line, but if you come during off hours (mid-day, evening during the week) you could get lucky! Pulled pork sandwich and mac n'cheese are my two faves at this place!"
"THE best BBQ in Chicago. No room to dispute this. I've eaten here numerous times and never have been disappointed. The brisket sandwich is absurd. When there's a line out the door on weekday nights you know the food is killer. Besides dining in which is always good, I bought their sauce for ribs I was going to grill. The price was right on par and my family flipped out when the had a taste. There is some great BBQ in Chicago, too bad they all have to stand in Smoque's shadow."
As a yearly visitor to Chicago this is one of my must stops.  Let's start with the negatives.  Parking can be bad and you may have to wait for a seat.  That's about it.  Their beef brisket is one of the best I've ever had and I love me some brisket.  You can leave the knife at the counter because the brisket is so tender it just falls apart.  A MUST HAVE is the mac and cheese....I have dreams about it.  The crunchy bread topping just takes it to another level.  Cornbread is solid.  The last time I went I had the brisket chili and I'll be having it again when I go back.  The prices are very reasonable and the owner walks the floor to make sure everything is awesome...Well sir...IT IS
"That's it. Smoque is officially THE BEST barbecue in town. The last time I visited this fine establishment, I had the pulled pork. Good, very good. But this past time, I went out on a limb and tried the baby back ribs. I must admit that I was a bit skeptical, as I have a special affinity for barbecue sauce on ribs and didn't really trust the dry rub. But alas, I was feeling a little adventurous. And boy did it pay off!Not only did Smoque get an additional star from me to make an even five, they also earned my endorsement of the Best Barbecue in Chicagoland."
"A must go place in Chicago! We got the brisket, pulled pork, baby back ribs, cole slaw, baked beans, Texas sausage, peach cobbler and the mac n' cheese. They were all GREAT but the last two listed were the BEST! Don't miss out on the peach cobbler and the mac n' cheese. The place does get packed but we didn't have to wait long and the eating area was decent."
"The family and I really enjoyed this great BBQ joint.   I had a sliced brisket basket, and thought the meat was the best I've had in a long time.  I tried a sample of my family's ribs and sausage.  The meat was extremely well prepared and delicious, though the ribs weren't as tender as I've had elsewhere.  The meat is definitely the main event here -- and it was wonderfully well smoked and delicious.The sides were good, but weren't as wonderful as the meat, but nobody's perfect, right?  The beans were delicious.  I liked the BBQ sauce, though it was a bit too sweet for me.  (I generally prefer a bit more of a ""zesty zing""  in my BBQ sauce that wasn't present here.). The coleslaw and fries were both okay, but I wasn't as impressed with then as the meat.  However, the young children definitely enjoyed the fries.  I liked the macaroni and cheese as a side, though the kids liked it less.The wait in line was well worth the wait, and probably consistent with great BBQ restaurants elsewhere.  This is definitely not a place when you're in a rush, and finding parking may pose a problem a problem."
"If I ever dine out at a restaurant that has macaroni and cheese on its menu - in any form - I will order it.  It is my all time favorite food, and I am on a constant quest to find the good stuff!!.  Smoque is the real deal.  The perfect amount of cheesiness and creaminess, topped with the tiniest, crisp breadcrumbs that just melt in your mouth.  Oh yeah, and they have great barbeque too. :) The brisket is to die for - juicy and tender and dripping in sauce!  When my co-worker told me she was going to get takeout from Smoque for her birthday, I started salivating at my desk.  And this place is a trek for me.  It means walking and taking two different bus lines just to sit down at their tables and nosh.  But believe me, it's all worth it."
Very solid.  Reminds me of true southern BBQ joint
"Smoque BBQ Survival Guide1. ParkingThe restuarant is in the middle of a neighborhood with not much around but houses so street parking seems ample with no meters. The lot directly behind Smoque is for another business during most of the day but becomes available to anyone after 5:30pm for no charge.2. Times to goI arrived at 6:30pm and there was no line. Good time to go. After 7pm a line was out the door and was still there as I was leaving around 8pm. A not so good time. During the afternoon I'm not sure for I've only eaten dinner here.3. SeatingThere are no servers but as you wait in line to order your food a nice employee will walk up to you and ask how many people you are eating with. He will then try to find a place for you and your friends to sit together amongst the bustling little seating area. This is not a great place for groups. The second time I went here I was in a group of 11 and we were split up at two different tables. Not a big deal but it will happen. Whoever you go with though expect to interact with your neighbors. The tables are close to one another and the seating area is usually full. It's kind of fun but it doesn't create a great atmosphere for long coversations or a romantic evening. If you come here you should come here to eat and little else. 4. FoodThe brisket is very tender. More so than I am used to but it is meaty and delicious and I think my favorite item on the menu. Their baby back ribs took me a second try to really like them. The main issue is that their ribs are blackened more than I've seen before and come dry with a vinager based BBQ sauce on the side. Their ribs are not the sweet, sticky, saucy, ribs I have come to expect when I order baby backs. But give them a second go at another visit or eat your left overs the next day and I bet they will grow on you. I did not try a side I didn't like. The fries were fresh cut and great. The macaroni and cheese was brilliant with a nice creaminess in the middle and a crunchiness on top. The coleslaw was a tasty vinager based one that really helped cut down all the meaty, creamy, and starchy flavors I was eating. For dessert I had the peach cobbler which was great and I don't even like peach cobbler. Food here is good and of the BBQ places I've tried in Chicago: Twin Anchors, Cooper's, Ruby's, this is hands down my favorite.5. General TipsBe ready to be stared at. Because the menu is posted on a wall right behind you as you sit and eat, the people waiting in line to order have nothing to do but read that menu, stare at your food, and watch you to see if you are leaving so they can get your seat.Don't be afraid to talk to the employees. Yes, they are busy, but I had a worker get me some ketchup, answer my questions about BBQ sauce, and take my garbage. They are there to help and seem happy to do so.If you are coming to this restaurant because of the television show, ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives"" don't be afraid to say you are. They fully embrace their tv fame with a huge signed poster of Guy Fieri on the wall and books to buy at the cash register. A good neighbor ice breaker: What did you order?"
When you come to a place like this it is hard to decide what to get the first time.  We have been wanting to come here since we heard about it and finally had the chance to go there.We arrived about 5pm on a Sunday and did get into a parking spot in the lot just west of the building they are in.  We had to stand outside about 5 minutes before getting inside and then I guess it was about 20 minutes (maybe a bit longer) before placing the order.  But the time is welcomed as you are trying to figure out what you want.We decided on a 1/2 x 1/2 of the baby back and the st louis.  I am not sure the difference but the longer chewier ones I liked better.  The only thing I would knock on the ribs is that the flavor of smoke for me was slightly more intense than I liked but I would positively make the drive to come here just for the food.We also did the Add a taste for like $3 where you can get the brisket or pulled pork.  The brisket you get a choice to have it sliced or chopped and we got chopped.  I think I would have preferred sliced but it was good.  I liked the pulled pork better than the brisket.  It seems that with BBQ it is hit and miss on the pulled pork and brisket. We did both.  Sides we got: Fries (Excellent)/Mac n Cheese (Excellent but kids did not like) and the Corn Bread (excellent).  I heard a couple of people by us saying something about the peach cobbler so I which I would have tried that but I guess it gives me a reason to go back.The service here was outstanding.  The owner is constantly sizing the situation and planning where everyone will sit.  He is also making sure that everyone is happy.  Others are working to make sure the tables are turned quickly but in no way do you feel pressured.
"Oooh boy! I was introduced to this place by a customer of mine when she ordered the ribs from Friendship. She mentioned there was a BBQ place on Pulaski by the highway that had amazing ribs and brisket sandwiches. So, of course, I had to try it out.Sure enough, she was right, this place is awesome. I've been here twice for carry out, and once for dine in. All the times I have went they were busy. Super friendly staff and great eats, I couldn't ask for more, this is a place you should definitely try!"
"Be warned - We experienced a rather long wait on a Saturday night.  Part of it was outside in the January cold.  It was worth it, don't get me wrong, but just be warned."
"This place is great, the portions are very reasonable. We had ribs and the brisket here, very juicy and quick service. I especially enjoyed the peach cobbler that came in a tiny little cupcake-like mold, it was soo good. The mac and cheese was surprisingly delightful. Be prepared to sit next to strangers, FUN!!"
"I dream about Smoque.......went a few weeks ago and it proved to me, once again, how amazing this place is. My memory isn't infatuated, this place just rocks!For god's sake, get the Sliced Brisket Platter, and make sure to get an extra side of pulled pork - holy jebus."
"I'll start off by saying- I fucking love this place! I've been there a few times and has yet to disappoint me! the smell before you even walk in the place is enough to make your nipples hard! I've never been a Brisket eater, but every time I've went I had to get it ( which sucks because I really wanna try their ribs, but get trapped ordering the Brisket!) and I love BBQ sauce! I swear I'd eat an Elephants asshole if it was slathered in BBQ sauce,but this Brisket is so good it seems a crime to cover up the taste with sauce.Sides:Fries - huge side of fries,if you like fries,get 'em,.. theres a shit load! I got them for the hell of it one day, normally not into fries,.. but they do give you alot!Mac & Cheese - By far THE best I've ever eaten!!! I don't know how many times anywhere I've had Mac & Cheese somewhere else and thought it was a disappointment, to the point I felt cheap ol' Kraft Mac & Cheese way still better than any ""home made""  I've had anywhere,.. but Smoques Mac & Cheese fucking RULES!!! its got this nice bread crumb crust that just makes it!,... so insanely good,to the point you may even stop in JUST for that.BBQ Beans - Awesome awesome awesome!!! sweet,sticky,spicy and loaded with brisket,the Beans and Mac & Cheese are a MUST when picking a side!the place is always packed,..get used to it!!,..unless they move to a bigger location or open another store, it will always be packed! but that just a sign of great food! First time I went it was just as they were opening and it was 11 degrees below zero out and there was still a line out the door!"
"the best bbq i've ever had in my 30 years of existence.  maybe it's cuz i'm from LA where bbq isn't as big of a thing as it is in the midwest?  who knows but i went twice in two weeks because i couldn't get those ribs and brisket out of my mind!!!  i tried both the baby back and st. louis style ribs.  i couldn't totally tell the difference between the two but i didn't care because they were both just so good.  and the brisket...melt in your mouth deliciousness!!!!!  what i loved was that all the sauces were on the side, not overslathered on the ribs.  the peach cobbler is a must have.  MUST have!  i wasn't the biggest fan of their cole slaw but soon realized it helps out to have a light veggie side in the midst of all that meat!the line can get long but it's a pretty quick turnaround for a smaller sized restaurant.  and even with the order at the counter and pick up your food style, the service is great!  i had a man (maybe the owner or manager?) come up to our table to make sure everything was ok and made sure we had the hot bbq sauce and jalapenos to eat with the brisket!  they help you with the seating so you don't have to hover around people as they eat just to get a table."
The best on the N.W. side.  Sides kick ass. Brisket kicks ass. Super tasty. Go get some.
"Never disappoints. Go here on a bad day, and it will turn into a good day."
My wifes family is from KC. This is the best BBQ I have had in Chicago.
"You want some macaroni with that cheese? ""MMMM"" was all I heard from my son as he ate the mac n cheese, and boy was it cheesy, a little too cheesy for my taste. As for my son dairy products list number one on his food pyramid!The family traveled up to the restaurant at about 11:30am on a Friday afternoon and after hearing all of the reviews we wanted some BBQ. At about the time we ordered and were seated by the host the lunch crowd started lining up. Tables can get tight not too mention sparse when groups start piling in to the restaurant. The restaurant was clean and kept clean by the host/bus boy. He had the job of cleaning off tables and seating customers. I ordered the sliced brisket platter with cornbread and baked beans. The meat was TENDER, the flavor with the sauce served on the side was -Ful as in flavorFul,  but in my opinion the taste was not hitting the spot for me. Corn bread comes served in it's own foil cup and the beans were chock-ful of pieces of pork and onion with just the right sweetness. Cole slaw was fresh and had good proportion of tart and sweet with crunch. The other items ordered were the Baby back ribs which were also tender and flavorful and the Mac and cheese as mentioned above kid size, with a brisket sandwich (kid size), comes with fresh cut fries. Please do not get me wrong on this review. All the food was quality, and fresh, and had the yummy factor, but maybe my palate lacks in finesse and I just enjoy barbecue that is slathered with sauce that rhymes with ""Sheet Fabee Ways!"" I felt like I was the product of getting too much talk about something and then trying out the product for myself and finding out ""It was not all that"" Not bad food just not what I was looking for. Would I come back? Of course. Maybe take out and bring it back home. Or maybe I need to give this place a second chance for a first tasting kind of thing. P.S. Do not park in the residential areas. There are signs along the way that prohibits parking in certain areas."
Meh.  Their food is good but they are cheap on their mac n cheese.  I NEED MORE!!!!
"After all this time, I finally went back after much cajoling from the husband.  Not likely to happen again.  Still as dry as ever and I am not interested in any of the sides that they have.  $4 for a half sandwich of dried-out pork on a weird bun is not my thing.  Husband tore into his half slab of ribs with fries, cornbread and coleslaw and when I asked about why he was not eating anything but the ribs and fries he said, ""I love the ribs and the fries are okay, but the rest I could do without.""  And why do you come here all the time then?  Find a place that has everything to offer."
My favorite BBQ in the city! Ribs were tender and smoky and brisket was juicy and cooked to perfection. I love the sauce - tangy and not thick (more vinegar is definitely my preference). My 4 year old talks about this place all the time and recommends it to everyone he meets. The only downside of this place is the line! Come hungry but prepared to wait.
"Haven't had their fries or ribs, but... some tasty items on this menu. The pulled pork and cornbread are pretty good, the mac and cheese is really great, and the sliced (yes, sliced is always better and more tender in my book) brisket is YUMMY. Most places do not do brisket well, but for some reason, these guys have a handle on it. It's truly a disappointment ordering brisket at most BBQ joints after having had it at Smoque. Not kidding. Nice staff, too!"
"Long overdue review!!! Let me start by saying I don't eat very much meat, but when it comes to Smoque.....my mouth waters and I CRAVE it regularly!! My first of several visits to Smoque was sometime last winter, when it was freezing cold and miserable.  Delicious, creamy, homemade mac n' cheese, tender sliced brisket, and their absolutely AMAZING peach cobbler is just the kind of comfort food I needed to lift my spirits.  Fast forward five or so months to my graduation from college.  We were planning to have a party at my apartment for 20-30 people, and I decided I wanted to have it catered.  Smoque was instantly my first choice.  I called, placed an order with their catering lady and everything was set.  Until..... we arrived 30 minutes before my party began to pick up the food.  I tell someone at the counter that we are there to pick up our order that I had placed with the catering manager, and after running around for a few minutes, he returned only to tell me they had no record of my order!  Immediately, I start going into freak out mode in my head (what am I going to feed all these people!!!), until the owner Barry Sorkin came up to put my mind at ease.  He assured me that he would have the food ready in 15 minutes and that he would personally deliver it to my apartment.  Eventually, they did find my order, but for some reason it didn't make it onto their clipboard.  He told me not to worry about paying, that we could take care of it later.  We get back to my apartment, and 15 minutes later, Barry arrives with my order, and kindly included many extras that I did not order, but that helped to make my event run much more smoothly.  In addition to delivering the order for free, he included a $50 gift certificate to return to Smoque, as an apology for losing my order.  Lastly, they found yet another way to extend their apologies when it came time for me to pay for my order. Amazing!!   There aren't many businesses like Smoque anymore, where customer satisfaction is truly a #1 priority.  Barry went above and beyond to correct the mistake and helped make a customer for life! (And many more who had the food at my party and heard just how amazing he was in correcting the mistake!) As far as visiting Smoque just to have dinner or something....be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes! I have never been there when the line wasn't out the door!"
"I'm never disappointed when I grab some grub from Smoquemy typical order:-Brisket Sandwich  (swap out cole slaw for corn bread)-Brisket Chili -- yes, chunks of brisket in the chili!-Peach CobblerFries are good too, but once you try the Brisket Chili or Peach Cobbler, you'll never go back. I've also tried the pulled pork, but again, the Brisket is too good to turn down."
"The ribs were really good, but I think it would have been much much better if it had not been take-out for me..The corn bread was amazing and the mac and cheese was great. I'll definitely be back."
"PROMETHEUS MUST HAVE LOVED BBQWhy else risk the fury of the gods to bring fire to mankind, than to spread the wondrous joy that is created when fire and smoke lovingly intertwine with meat to create the magic of BBQ?  Smoque capitalizes on the titan's gift by creating some of the best BBQ in Chicago (or anywhere for that matter).  Ribs: Tried a 1/2 rack of baby backs and a 1/2 rack of St. Louis and both were superb.  They must have a masseuse in the house, because their ribs were obviously massaged with care with a heaping serving of spices that forms a crust bursting with flavor.  On top of all that, they smoke their ribs so thoroughly that if I was blind I'd be convinced I was sitting in front of a camp fire.  Between the rub and the smoke you really don't need any sauce, but I love sauce and Smoque's smoky-vinegary-spiced elixir really hit the mark.  Chopped Brisket: Incredible.  Went for a taste ($3 add-on to my ribs) and the first bite made me think I should've flipped my order around.  Better than I ever had in Texas.All in all it was a meal fit for a god...or perhaps I should say, a titan.  So the next time you're chowing down at Smoque, throw a bone (or maybe some brisket) to the one who made it all possible."
"Best BBQ I have ever had.  Went to memphis this spring and have to say that after comparing everything to Smoque, Smoque won hands down.  Their St Louis ribs are the stuff dreams are made of.  Great owners.  Excellent food."
"The smell of BBQ wafting through the air gives me more than enough reason to grab a place at the end of the order line that is far outside the door. 15 minutes go by and the line is creeping s-l-o-w-l-y along, but I decide to stick it out. I see each customer get to the counter and take, what seems to be an eternity to place their order. It is a full 25 minutes before I finally make it to the register to place my order. And, so it goes...Me: ""I'll have the brisket platter with beans and cornbread for the sides.""Smoque (speaking in the drollest possible manner): ""We are out of brisket.""Me (mumbling under my breath): ""Hmm, why didn't you tell me you were out of brisket before I recited my entire order? Me, again: ""Okay, I'll have the chicken platter with beans and cornbread for the sides.""Smoque: ""We are out of chicken. Basically, all we have is baby-back ribs. We are out of everything else.""Me: ""Thanks for wasting my time!"" as I walked out the door more than slightly pissed off. I am sure that every customer waiting in that long line experienced the same problem that I encountered when I finally got to the counter to place my order. I am sure that the baby-back ribs were great. But, I did not want baby-back ribs! And, I would have loved the opportunity to make that decision before Smoque wasted 25 MINUTES of my life waiting in their baby-back rib line. So, here is my restaurant management tip for Smoque: Somehow convey to your customers waiting in line what is and is not available, so they can make an informed decision on whether they want to wait in said line.  Thank you!The bottom line: great BBQ (for the northwest side of Chicago) but lousy customer service. I may go back, but I'll never wait in line again unless I know what is available to order."
"I am from Austin, TX and the guys that started this place got much of their inspiration from there.  In fact, their new sausage is made in Taylor, TX (about 30 min outside of Austin).  They are very true to form for someone that eats BBQ once a week.Good:- Ribs are the real deal - both baby backs and St. Louis- Brisket is just like home- Mac and Cheese is great- Beans are some of the best I have ever had - Brisket in the beans!- BYOB - cold beer!Wish they could improve:- Small seating but they seem to make it work- Outside of most of the tourist places so you have to make the effort to get to this place.I would highly recommend this place if you are not from Texas or KC and have not had real BBQ (Sorry Carolina, I have no experience there)."
"MeatFest!! YUUuUum! I love meat. After a 6 hour bike ride, we were super excited to check out Smoque. We were on Pulaski and we turned the corner and saw a HUUUUGE line on the side of the building. Doh!Luckily we were determined. Some people left the lines bc they were sick of waiting. BooHoo... The line moved fairly quickly. We ordered a full slab of the St. Louis style ribs, the brisket platter, and a taste of pulled pork. The pulled pork was freaking amazing. It was so tender and flavorful. This is definitely the best pulled pork EVER!! The brisket was also good, but not as good at as the pulled pork. The ribs had a great smokey flavor."
"YUM.There was a line to the door around 7:30 on a sunday night (they close at 9). No problem getting a table once we ordered. I had the 1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 chopped brisket sandwich. They were out of coleslaw, so they gave me my one side (really good crunch flavory fries) and threw in a peach cobbler for free. The cobbler may have been the best part of the meal - save room. As my friend noted, they use real peaches, not Del Monte fake ones.The pork was fantastic. I probably will get the sliced brisket (not chopped) next time, to have a better ratio of smoky beef to charred outer layer (though some will surely prefer more char).Definitely worth the trip, and it's a short walk from the Irving Park blue line."
"Simply delicious!  The sliced brisket is so tender utensils are useless.  My own mother said it was worth the trip to Chicago just for Smoque, and I haven't seen her in 3 months.   Everything was so good!  Mac n Cheese, fries, peach cobbler and cornbread.  There were three of us, so we all sampled from one another.  I seriously can't wait to go back!"
"I've had much better BBQ. Uncle Bub's in Westmont is my favorite and in the city Smoke Daddy is very good. I went to this place once, gave it an honest try, and was so disappointed that I will not be going back.Blah."
Best BBQ in Chicago... you can order brisket chopped and charred and it will be a lasting memory.  The pulled pork is succulent and juicy and the best I've had.  Sandwiches are served on a soft brioche bun.  They sell-out fast since the meats are cooked over 24-hours or something... call ahead.  Coleslaw and creamy-cheddar mac and cheese are stand-out sides.Secondary options: Smoke Daddy (try the fried apple pie for dessert)
"We just ordered lunch for 15 folks at my office. I faxed the order over to Smoque and included the names of my co-workers & clients after each of their orders, ie: (1 brisket sandwich w/slaw & peach cobbler - Pattie). When I arrived to pick it up, the food was in 3 big boxes with each order bagged separately & each bag had a name tag attached. It made our life soooo much simpler when distributing the food and made sure that all of the sides were included. We love you Smoque, thanks for the delicious food!"
This place is the SHIT!Go.  Eat.  Everything. Enjoy.
"You'll have to wait in line probably, it's counter service. But it's very delicious. We split St. Louis ribs, pull pork, mac&cheese, fries, baked beans, cornbread, and the peach cobbler. I think the ribs, mac & cheese, baked beans, sweet tea, peach cobbler and pulled pork sandwich are the winners from this menu. It's byob, loud, and busy. Be ready."
"I love this place, been going here for about two years now. The first time we went there the line was out the door and around the corner, literally. So I said heck no and went somewhere else. Big Mistake, the ribs we had at the second joint were terrible. On a followup visit, made sure to get there earlier. There still was a line but it moves well and if you're eating in, they really do an excellent job of finding a table for your party by the time you've placed your order.  I didn't think the family style seating was for me, but I quickly got over it just knowing we didn't have to scramble to find a seat that's so cool. And there was the food. The baby backs are excellent, never tough or drowning in sauce, it's served on the side, they're seasoned well and have the right amount of pink on the inside. The slaw is excellent, not that store bought crap that's been made days in advance and swimming in mayo. The BBQ beans, Mac and Cheese, Bag of cut fries, and cobbler. OMG, talk about having to loosen your belt. My only wish is they were closer to my house. Oh hell, that's what I-GO car is for when I don't have a ride. You can even call ahead for pickup orders and they tell you exactly when the order will be ready. How sweet is that."
"I'm not a big fan or BBQ, but a few friends an I were looking for a place to try and one of them recommended this place. I did not know it was BYOB - so that's an automatic plus for me. That calibrates a lot of expectations, since value is already established. So, I ordered the brisket sandwich, which is advertised as ""moist and tender"" on the website. I found it to be neither, really. It was good, for sure, but nothing to salivate over."
"This is the best BBQ place in Chicago, hands-down.  Phenomenal food.  Smoque clearly beats my previous best-BBQ choice, Rudy's (Texas).  The Smoque website has an essay on their BBQ philosophy that made me salivate like Pavlov's dog.  If you are even remotely interested in top-notch BBQ this restaurant is a must-visit....immediately.  Rather than repeating the accolades over and over, suffice to say that everything on the menu is best-in-class.By the way: Smoque is BYO!  Load up the cooler and Let the Good Times Roll!"
Great bbq.  Great brisket.  Pulled pork is very good.  Beans and mac 'n cheese was pretty good too.  The best bbq place in the city as far as I am concerned.
I live in the area and pass Smoque frequently.  I have yet to see a day when it is not busy.T he brisket and pulled pork are delish! I haven't tried the ribs as of yet..  I will though when I'm tired of the brisket sandwiches. haha!  The fries and Mac are pretty tastey also.
"Being a Texan, I'd have to say that Smoque BBQ is one of the best I've places I've ever been to.  The meat was moist and great.  I had the brisket and rib plate with macaroni cheese and beans.  Although I like to go to Barbeque joints to enjoy their meat and the occasional side dish that will most likely hit or miss, this place got it all right.. actually their sides shot my opinion about this place through the roof.  Seriously though, that Mac n cheese was ,, was,, freaking good. I'll be definitely going back when I visit the Windy City again."
"Oh my God!Best BBQ in Chicago.  I didn't want to stop eating.  The service here is spectacular too.  My wife and I ordered a LOT of food.  We both had leftovers to take home, and we clocked in at under 30 bucks.  I'll be back."
"This place blew my mind.  Easily the best BBQ in Chicago.  Just walking past the doorway you can smell the goodness.  It's a little bizarre how you order and then the employee next to the register tells you where to sit, but nonetheless I found the employees all very friendly.  Try the mac n cheese, it's unlike anything I've had before.  I plan on taking all of my friends here at some point."
"This would be a 4.5 star review if the distance wasn't so great, about 45 from where I live. I have been here once so far and that day was the White Sox home opener after the game. I got the sliced brisket platter which came with coleslaw and 2 sides which I choose to be the brisket chili and the mac n cheese. I also got a taste of pulled pork.1. sliced brisketExtremely tender, could barely pick it up with my fork. had good flavor. first brisket i've ever had so I didn't have anything to compare it too but It wasnt as juicy as I had hoped but it was by no means dry. Decent size portion with the slaw and 2 sides. 4/52. coleslawDAMN good slaw. I believe I am the slaw nazi because I am always critical of it, and I don't like vinegar based so much, but boy do they know what they are doing. Simple. One type of cabbage chopped not shredded like crazy, and some thinly sliced red onion. Little bit of pepper the slightly vinegary base, can't go wrong. Not drenched not too peppery. Only complaint was that I wanted MORE! 5/53. mac n cheeseTiny portion, but ooooh so good. Nice breadcrumb crust on top and very creamy in the middle. You can tell its homemade, because of the color and flavor (real cheese), and can taste the love. Again only complaint tiny portion which i'm going to say takes half a point this time. 4.5/54. brisket chiliGood spices, decent heat, nice sized bowl. Hardly any meat though just basically tomatoes and spices with a chili like broth. Tasty but not a chili that one should be proud of. The one low point of the meal. 2.5/55. pulled porkGood pulled pork. You can defiantly taste the smoke especially in the dark crust which tastes like a smokey bacon. The flavor was a bit one dimensional though. 3.5/5Overall a pretty good place, might not go out of my way to get back there but after a sox game sure. Good price for lots of good food, about 12 dollars for all of that plus a drink. Slightly disappoint how the BBQ sauce had more flavor than basically everything, or at least the meat.  Not much of a line at all when I went. Very organized I was very impressed."
I would highly recommend this place! Just look at all the other yelp reviews! What more can I say? :)
"Wow I was disappointed last nite.  What's going on?  Been here a number of times and the meat has been great but noticeably starting to change.  This time brisket was dry as a bone and st Louis  ribs were as well.  Thank goodness for some sauce to help ease that (used to be moist and delectable) dry brisket meat down. Im hoping the popularity of this gem has not  begun to ruin  the quality.   Places get  popular and quality starts suffering.  Please Smoque, don't go that route."
"I had high expectations for Smoque. I previously tried to visit the restaurant, but found a line outside and around the building. I kept going. On a Sunday evening at 7:00 P.M., I met friends there and found the line extending just outside the door.It took about 30-minutes to reach the cashier to place our order. There was an employee keeping tabs on the line trying to arrange proper seating for the groups. I counted at least 14-employees, which I find incredible for a restaurant of this small size. I would estimate the restaurant occupies no more than 2,000 square feet. I doubt the seating capacity exceeds 50 - 60 patrons.You place your order with a cashier, find a seat and wait for your number to be called. Once you place your order, there isn't much of a wait. Fountain drinks are self-service and located close to diners.I ordered a sliced brisket sandwich with cole slaw and baked beans. My wife ordered a pulled-pork sandwich with cole slaw and macaroni and cheese. We shared a small order of fries.The brisket was servied on a soft, dinner-style bun. The meat was flavorful, tender and smokey. It wasn't drenched in BBQ sauce, but we were each provided with extra sauce in a plastic container. The sauce is thin and vinegar-based--southern style. The cole slaw is also vinegar-based and very sweet. The baked beans were very smokey--much too smokey for my taste. The french fries were fresh cut and served in a small paper bag. They were excellent, except this batch was over salted. The pulled pork was flavorful with a nice crust of bark. Our tab was under $23.00.Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I had hoped for a better dining experience. With painted concrete floor and metal roof ceiling, the crowded restaurant was loud and difficult to carry on a conversation. Although a patron standing in line interrupted our meal to ask about the french fries. Barry, one of the owners, stopped by to ask how everything was. He was friendly and proud of his food and spoke about their efforts to maintain consistency. How to improve things (IMHO)...Find a larger location with adequate parking. It took ten to fifteen minutes to find a place to park on the street and another thirty minutes to reach the cashier to place my order.Cut back on the smoke a little--especially on the baked beans. My guess is they're using liquid smoke in the beans and it's overwhelming. While Hank Hill is at the other extreme with, ""Taste the meat, not the heat."" Smoque has too much smoke for my taste."
"Looking for some great ribs and being new to town I did not know where to go. Decided to use yelp for the very first time, I found that Smoque BBQ had great reviews. Keep in mind that I've been in Texas for the past 12 years so my standards may be a bit high. I have to say that the best they have to offer are the ribs, by far the greatest thing on the menu. As for the rest of the food Items I would have to say that they are good but leaves much to be desired. The brisket was very bland and did not have much taste or texture to it, I t seem as if I was eating roast beef instead of actual brisket. The coleslaw, beans, macaroni and cheese were very good and appetizing however the regular sizes seem to be very small and not contain much food. If you're in the mood for some good ribs this would be a great spot to go, however if you're looking for great brisket I would not recommend at this restaurant."
"Ive been to most of the bbq places in the city and evanston.  I consider myself a bbq snob (both commercial and private) and would never cook on gas, or briquets.   Many of the northside places, IMHO are way over hyped by people who think Open Pit is the sauce to end all sauces.Smoque is no such place.The St.Louis slab was perfect, and the dry rub was probably the best that I have ever had.   The sauce was complex and complimented the rub perfectly.  The chicken was juicy and cooked evenly all the way thru.My only gripe is the Peach cobbler did not have a top on it, and was sealed with foil.  By the time I got home, it had dripped in the bag."
"Finally went there today for the first time.  We've heard a lot of people raving about Smoque's and read the excellent reviews and couldn't wait to try it.  We decided to stop there for lunch today because we were in the neighborhood.  Both of us were somewhat disappointed.I had the sliced beef brisket sandwich.  The beef brisket had very little flavor.  It did have a small smoke ring around it, but the smoke flavor and rub never saturated the beef.  It also was fatty (fat makes me gag, so the 3-star rating, which should be 2.5.)  The BBQ sauce was thin and didn't have much flavor.  The meat was sliced thicker than I'm used to, but was very tender and falling apart.  I think the fat made it juicy.  So if you like fat, you may like it.My friend had the pulled pork sandwich, and told me that it definitely wasn't the best he's had.  The coleslaw was excellent.  The chili side dish was also very good.Portions were plentiful, but we compared it to other BBQ restaurants we went to in the suburbs, and didn't think Smoque's lives up to its reputation. Atmosphere is nice for a city restaurant.  Parking isn't easy because of permit parking in the neighborhood (OK, I'm spoiled living in the suburbs!!)  The staff was very nice and attentive.We were disappointed to spend $20.00 for lunch without drinks, and not thoroughly enjoy it.By the way, I've been to Austin, TX several times and have had the BBQ there.  No comparison.  Meat there was smoked throughout, flavor was throughout the meat and the BBQ sauce was delicious.  Maybe we hit it on an off-day?  However, I don't think we'll try it again.  We have several BBQ places closer to home that we think are better."
"This has got be my favorite bbq joint in the city right now.  I've been here three times already, yet with each time I leave wanting to come back even more!  Smoque's had an incredible amount of publicity since they opened.  It's been on Metromix, Check Please, and even Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network!!   Everything about this place screams bbq, from the shack-line appearance on the outside to the small, cozy interior w/ a heavenly aroma of smoke and goodness in the air.As if the anticipation wasn't great enough, Smoque happens to be BYOB, how cool!!!  My friends and I waited in line, case in hand, ready to devour.  We ordered a slab of the baby back ribs, half slab of st. louis style ribs, taster portion of the chopped brisket, corn bread, and chose our sides of baked beans, mac and cheese, and fries.  I can't even begin to describe how good the food is here.  The ribs were so tender, especially the St. Louis style, which were incredibly meaty and smokey.  Don't forget to add their homemade sauce, it's fantastic!  The brisket was insanely tender and flavorful as well.  I've never had better baked beans than here, they have an incredible meatiness that makes them taste so damn good.  The mac and cheese is baked w/ some parmesan on top, adding a nice crunchy texture.  The cornbread actually had bits of corn in it, how awesome!!  My mouth is watering even as I write this.  Come during the week to avoid the crazy lines on the weekend.  And don't forget to show up early because they tend to run out of the good stuff if you come late!! You might leave w/ bbq sauce all over your face, but you'll undoubtedly be be smiling all the way home after eating here!!"
"I know Chicago doesn't have BBQ like they do in the south and with good reason, but Smoque is the best, I think, that Chicago has to offer in terms of BBQ. Check it out. Go during the week to avoid lines."
"Some of the best barbeque I have ever had.  Easily my favorite brisket anywhere - super moist and smokey, wonderful flavor.  And the meaty side of beans are fantastic.  Smoque deserves any and all recognition it receives and should be on the short list for top 'que spots in the country."
"Flat out the best BBQ in Chicago, and possibly the best I've ever had.  We nearly ordered 1 of everything and just took the leftovers back to our place to gnaw on for the rest of the day.  Barbaric but amazing.  Their St. Louis ribs were the standout.  Amazing Amazing Amazing.  We love Smoque BBQ!"
best bbq in town.  best brisket ever.
"Best BBQ in Chicago!We've been eating at this place ever since we saw it on the Food Network show, Diner's Drive-In's and Dives way back when. It really is a ""dive"" in the sense that you stand in line, order your food, sit pretty close to others and go. It's a step up from a fast food place, but with WAY better food.I'm glad that the wait at this place has gotten better over the years. After it was on TV the line was always out the door, but it's worth it! We usually go for a late lunch/early dinner so that we can avoid the crowd. The BBQ here is just awesome. I've never tried the ribs because the brisket and pulled pork are just SO good. In fact, everything they have is good... Mac n Cheese, Peach Cobbler, beans, fries, even the side of coleslaw that you get with your meal is good. Its coleslaw with a clear dressing, not mayo based and its really refreshing and yummy. The sauce is really good too! YUM!If you are in the mood for a yummy platter of brisket or pulled pork (or even a sandwich) and great sides, look no further than Smoque."
I am totally into Smoque; kind of like an 11 year old girl gets into Justin Bieber.  Smoque just blows my mind.
"*Finally* made it to Smoque, long overdue and man I've been missing out.  For me, bbq is all about the pulled pork and theirs is something to behold....tender, nice smoky flavor and oh so delicious. Topped off with their zesty bbq sauce, this is how bbq is done, my friend.The place itself is fairly small, about 15 tables total.  I went at 11:30a thinking i'd beat the lunch rush and there was a line about 5 deep...no worries right?  Well, not really.  Apparently some jack-arse ahead of me ordered, and i kid you not, no less than 20 different things; he walked out with five gianormous bags of food...totally cluster-f'd everything up.  I ended up getting my order at just after Noon and by this time the queue was at least 20 deep with patrons quite visibly annoyed. oh well, such is life....now, let's talk food:again, pulled pork was tender, juicy and succulent with a nice char on a few of the pieces, easily a 5/5.  Love their sauce which was reminiscent of what Smoke Daddy's *used* to be (sadly, they've changed for the worse), semi sweet w. a nice kick to it.    I went with the 2-sides platter and chose fries and baked beans.  To me, sides play a pretty big role at a bbq joint and they delivered another 5/5..out.stan.ding!  Fries were hot and fresh, crispy on the outside steak type fries but not all ""potato-y"" like some steak fries tend to be, very flavorful!  Baked beans were as good as they get, nice hickory flavor, bits of bacon and pork included and a hint of sweetness via brown sugar and other seasoning, incredible.  Cole slaw (included in all platters) was probably some of the freshest i've encountered, light dressing (not mayo based) which I can only compare to my Mom's homemade Poppyseed dressing...again 5/5!  Food 5/5 !!! Look, feel of the restaurant and overall experience (parking is a total hassle and ironically it's similar to Fat Willy's...chicago bbq joints, sort it out already!) 3/5."
Pretty good BBQ. Brisket and ribs were both very good. Long line on a Saturday night--waited around 40 minutes in line before ordering.
"I am kicking myself for not going here sooner!  This is the best pulled pork anywhere, really!  I am a freak about meat (like picky, don't eat much of it, freak) and I would eat this delicious smokey pork every night of the week if I could.  The mac and cheese is amazing and the fresh cut fries are awesome.  My husband loves the St. Louis and baby back ribs from here- he said they're the best he's ever had- and we are bbq eating fools.  I haven't had anything from here that I don't love/crave."
"So I ate at Smoque for the first time on Saturday afternoon......This is the BEST BBQ in the city! I can't get over how AWESOME it is!I recommend getting a platter, with that you get your choice of meat,Cole slaw, and choice of two sides!My boyfriend and I each got a platter:Mine-Pulled Pork- moist, huge portion, great flavorSlaw- soooooooo good, not mayo based, light and awesome!Mac and Cheese- perfect portion, cheesy goodnessand Peach cobbler- I wasn't a fan, I ate the rest 2 days later drunk, and liked it.His-Chopped Brisket- again moist, huge portions, and not overly fatty, there was a smoked awesome favorSlawBBQ Beans- They were OK, nothing to write home about....Fries- fresh cut and seasoned well.and a side of St. Louis style ribs-- meaty no fat and full of flavor.We split everything and loved it all!The meat is plentiful, and not fatty at all.You don't need sauce, I prefer the meat with out it!"
"The pulled pork is probably the best I've ever had. I loved the brisket as well, but the last time I got it, it was a little fatty for my taste. Still, I love that you can get ""tastes"" of the different meats so you can try them all. I always have WAY too much meat when I go here, though. I can see why people say it's the best BBQ in Chicago. The vinegar BBQ sauce is absolutely amazing.The sides are really good too. The mac & cheese and cornbread are probably my favorites.This is not the place if you're looking for a really nice atmosphere. Everyone orders at the counter and the line is usually out the door. After you order, you're eventually seated in the cafeteria-style dining room and your order is put in to be made and brought out on trays. Definitely try to go on a weeknight or at an off time because the experience is just better overall. Plus, parking is a little spotty at busy times. It's BYOB so you can bring a few beers to have with your meal. The smoked meat is totally worth a stop."
Beans are to die for!
"As I sit here writing this review, I can still smell the smoke and vinegar on my hands.  This was, without a doubt, some of the best BBQ I have ever experienced.You must, MUST, go!!!Me and two of my friends arrived with some beers around 7:00pm on a Tuesday.  It was lively, busy, and smelled incredible.  Everything is ordered off a large chalkboard and seats are assigned only after you plae your order at the counter.  It's loud and cramped but I didn't mind one bit.  If you do mind, then you don't belong there as you have missed the point of what Smoque is about.  We're not there for the ambiance, you go for the food!I had the Brisket platter with slaw, baked beans, and fries.  Hands down, the best brisket I've ever had.  If I had to pick my favorite part of the meal I would have to say the BBQ baked beans...they were unreal.  Huge smokey chunks of brisket could be found in almost every bite of the beans.Everything was so good that I got back in line to have the peach cobbler.  Folks, this was incredible food.  You must go.  I will be back soon!"
"Giving Smoque BBQ one star likely won't persuade many people here, so please consider this review a reminder to demand your food be properly prepared. I've been to Smoque three times -- two of which I was served meat that was very much overcooked. Ribs and brisket are supposed to be moist and tender, not DRY and TOUGH.After my second outing turned out to be quite yummy, I thought I would give Smoque another try. Not again."
Great BBQ and the Beans are to die for! I can not wait to go back for some more melt in your mouth food. Had the Pulled Pork and it was perfect.
The best damn bbq I have had in this city!
"Great BBQ place. Clean tables, prompts service. Just order ribs and do not mess around with their sandwiches. Ribs are the way to go there. Very soft and smoky flavored  - they are as good as ribs can be.  For 2 people just get a Full Slab of St Luis Ribs and 2 sides that goes with it for free. That will be plenty for a dinner. Do not order any more additional sides. Their sides are nothing special."
"When it comes to me and barbecue, consistency is KEY and Smoque certainly pleases. The lines can be crazy long, but the help orchestrates the situation like culinary maestros and breezes you through the queue ensuring that you'll have a place to sit once your food is up. The brisket is my first love, but the ribs and pulled pork are wonderful as well. You just can't really go wrong, so try a combo plate. The sides (brisket chili, beans, mac and cheese and cornbread) are a perfect accompaniment to the meal. Thanks for showing Chicago how it's done!"
Only ate here once but the BBQ was good. It's always crowded so they must be doing something right. If you live nearby I'd highly suggest you call ahead and get your food to go.  Look forward to trying it again.
"A few weeks ago, my fiance and I made our inaugural trips to both Detroit and Slows Bar-B-Q, returning home with glowing things to say about both.  I posted a review on Yelp talking about our really positive (and delicious) experience at Slows, and almost immediately received a note back from another Yelper, telling me that Slows was good, but Smoque was ""10x better"".  So, when I was in Chicago and my friend Keem suggested that we go to Smoque for lunch for delicious, delicious BBQ, I was suitably intrigued.  AND also hungry.We met up with other lady friends at Smoque on a sunny Super Bowl Sunday afternoon, our mouths watering by the time we walked in the door.  A number of people were in and out picking up Super Bowl catering orders while we made our selections - in fact, about half of the restaurant was blocked off for Super Bowl pick-ups - and justifiably so, as this is just the kind of grub I'd want at my Super Bowl party, were I to have one.  We all settled on pulled pork sandwiches, available in the full or half size, with varying sides.  I had a vinegary cole slaw and a very large bag of hand-cut fries that we all shared - in addition, the others tried the cornbread and the macaroni and cheese, both baked in little foil ramekins.  Our sandwiches came with a bit of tangy sauce ladled over the top and a small cup of vinegary sauce to add at our discretion.  For me, the half sandwich, shared sides, and a soda were just the right size for lunch - though I regretted not being able to try the brisket (available chopped or sliced) and the various ribs on the menu.How does it compare to Slows?  In my non-expert opinion, I'd say they're just different animals.  Slows has a more expansive menu, but what Smoque does, it does well.  I liked having more sauce options at Slows, but I also liked the simplicity of the Smoque experience.  I felt like the meat was more flavorful at Slows, but I liked being able to get a half portion AND sides for a lower price at Smoque.  BBQ is something many people take seriously, and I am not one of them, but I am grateful that Slows is nearby, and that I can visit Smoque whenever I'm in Chicago."
"I hate trying to find good barbecue. Usually.  It never meets my expectations, and I just feel like a fat slob and really let down when I leave the joint. Usually.So the family walked into Smoque, which had been touted as all things gastrointestinally orgasmic. My fiance, he loves his barbecue. He looks at the guy and says, ""What's good?""  The dude behind the counter says, ""Everything.""So? We got everything.It's wrong how good it was.  I want to go back, which says it all.The barbecue was amazing.  Saucy and perfect. Every bit of the meat was sumptuous.  The fries were the best, tastiest, crunchiest fries I have ever had. The mac and cheese was fricking unreal. The damned beans were even good, and I usually won't even touch baked beans unless my mama made them. The slaw was great. The cobbler was fantastic.Jeeeeezus.  I want it now.Yeah, so I would say go. And get everything. Really.  Now.Are you still reading this?  GO!"
"I spent three years in Chicago, desperately searching for a passable pork shoulder before my husband found Smoque.  I had heard about it a few times, but passed it off, since I had been burned by a few recommendations for ""the best BBQ in Chicago"" before.  You see, I'm not interested in ribs AT ALL.  I mean, okay, sometimes I like some ribs, but when I want barbecue, I really want pork shoulder.  I didn't realize that this was weird until I left Kentucky.Anyhoo, Smoque has the best pork shoulder I have had in the city hands down.  Granted, I'm still on a mission, but this place is a definite go-to until we get our own smoker.  Something tells me that's going to be a few years since backyards aren't exactly easy to come by here..."
"Some friends took me here after seeing it on Diners, Dives, and something on Food Network.  The huge line going out the door and around the corner told me that it would definitely be worth the wait.  Order your food off the wall, pay, and wait for a table to open up, most likely next to some strangers, but that's ok!  Service is great.  The workers are super nice and helpful and make sure you have a table when your food comes up.  Everything we ordered was absolutely great.  I love bbq but usually am not a fan of pulled pork and brisket and the like because it's usually either too dry or too saucy, but it was excellent here.I tasted a bit of everything, courtesy of my friends and all of the meat dishes were good.  Meat was very tender, never dry and the bbq sauce is excellent, and I'm really picky about my bbq sauce.  The sides were good as well- cole slaw, mac and cheese and baked beans almost trump the meat itself.  No matter what you order, you will not be disappointed.  Food- Awesome.  better ribs, chicken, bbq than most steakhouses and bbq placesPrice- Decently priced- averageService- Surprisingly great service for a little hole in the wall placeParking- I think there was a small lot behind the building, also street parking"
"I am not an expert on BBQ and we found Smoque on an Internet search and put it on the list to try. I checked out yelp reviews before we went and am thankful for the heads up on the wait to get in & order food. We were there on a Sunday and the line was not out the door, so I figured that was a good thing. It was around 7:00 p.m. and it was 15 minutes till we ordered and another 15 minutes to get the food. We decided to take it home instead of eating in. I am not an expert on BBQ. I've eaten it in and around Chicago at various places. I've eaten BBQ in St. Louis, and KC. I've can't recall any bad BBQ any where I've tried it, there are just variations of it. We got the pulled pork, which was very good. It was moist and had a mild smoky flavor. I loved the vinegar based sauce, it is not hot or sweet, the right amount of flavor to compliment the pork. The chicken was good as well, although a little dry. The chicken had a nice smoky flavor to it. The sauce that came with the chicken was thicker and sweeter, it was good. We got a side of brisket. I've only had BBQ brisket once before at a South Carolina style BBQ place in Maryland. This brisket was UNBELIEVABLE. When ordered we were asked ""sliced or chopped"" we opted for sliced. The flavor of the meat, the smokiness of it and the melt in your mouth tenderness was too much! The side portion of it was generous and I may be a brisket convert. The cole slaw was vinegar based. It tastes like rice vinegar, celery seed and has thin slices of red onion which adds a pop of flavor. The cole slaw is different -  in a good way -  very refreshing.  I am an expert on baked beans, have had many excellent variations of them home made and out, but these rocked my world. The beans are smoked, have hints of brown sugar, chunks of bacon and onion and taste so good as I write this I want them- now!. I didn't believe how fast I chowed down my side order. I wanted to head back on the kennedy to grab more before they closed. I restrained myself. But from now on large side of baked beans, maybe 2, one to eat later in the week might be a treat. The side special of the day was brisket chili which I picked as a side. It was ok, not something I would get again. Overall, we thought the food was very good, the prices were reasonable, and their baked beans are perfect."
"I tried this place about 2 months ago and it was very, very good. It was a busy night, so I decided to do a carry-out order...and when I got there, I was really glad I did! There was a line out the door, but luckily carry-out orders are allowed to skip the line and go straight inside. I ordered the brisket basket and my wife had the baby-back ribs; both were excellent. We had the cornbread, mac n' cheese, fries, and bbq beans as sides and all of them were great as well. Overall, this is my favorite bbq place in the city. Everyone has their own preference (especially bbq foodies), so this place may not be for everyone, but it's definitely worth a shot b/c the food is outstanding."
"i'm sorry, but i just can't pretend this place is awesome.i don't eat red meat, but so fine--how bout the beans? no! they don't taste good. the cornbread? dry. the mac+cheese? oily. and worst things worst, there's rarely a table available. i just don't see what the big deal is. at all.+apple fritter dessert"
"We expected a lot from this place, and frankly we were disappointed. The pulled pork was average at best, the sides were small and (other than the mac-n-cheese, which is delicious) unimpressive. Coupled  with the long lines and high school cafeteria ambiance it's unlikely that we'll be back."
"Ok, sure... it's more fun to get BBQ in a little run down place on the side of an old dirt road run by an old man or woman with smoke-stained hands... yes. I agree. Chicago has had a few greats that fit this category too (.. the original Hecky's on Greenbay, Leon's on the south side... Oh Edith! We miss you so!). Smoque is not this. It doesn't have that cinematic, ""I've come across something nobody else knows about"" thing. They won't cast Wilford Brimley or Bill Cobbs to play the owner in the movie about this place. But really, who cares? For me its about how the food tastes... period. I don't require the foreplay... just fork over the smokey meats please. THEIR SAUCE has a kick but is not too spicy... nice and sweet without being too sweet as Chicago places do often... sweeter than Texas style, more kick than KC style.... just right.BRISKET is great! Fatty where you want it fatty, flavorful, smokey, tender... this is great stuff.RIBS are smokey and pink... tender... dry served with sauce on the side for dipping... very meaty and very delicious!BEANS may be the best thing in the place.... smokey and fatty and onion-y... yum!COLESLAW is a very minimal vinegar chopped cabbage with a little purple onion and that's it... very fresh and crunchy... not huge on flavor and not for everybody... but good pallet cleanser and heat relief.PULLED PORK is good but I think the brisket is the better choice here.CHICKEN.... chicken? Who orders chicken in a place like this?! It did LOOK good but sorry... can't waste my plate space on chicken.... maybe someday I'll try it.....FRIES are great... crunchy, yummy.... not an afterthought as with many other pure breed BBQ places..PEACH COBBLER will have you weeping... delicious!... and served piping hot... damn!... If it has a fault, it is that it's too small!THE BEST DEAL is getting a sandwich and fries on the kids menu for like $3.50 if you want a great lunch but don't want to have to take a nap after it... ALSO, it's BYOB which is a nice touch.... lots of folks were bringing in their own beer... makes for an affordable and delicious meal.IN ADDITION: I was just there with some friends... the place was packed but they went out of their way to make sure we ordered the best stuff... one guy gave us a consultation as we stood in line.. and man did it pay off! I will now always get the St Louis style ribs! Meatier than baby back. Who knew? He also went in the back and brought us candied jalapenos and an extra spicy sauce that they don't have on the table. He also dragged out a table for us to sit at... brought three chairs from the back. They really took care of us and we left totally satisfied! I LOVE THIS PLACE!"
"Outstanding food - made with care, well-thought-out recipes, good value.Wonderful staff/owners - they really do care and they're down-to-earth.So yeah, they're SO great that the line can be long and sometimes they run out of food.  Hey, you can only smoke so much meat in a day, ya know?Let's just pray that they can expand soon and buy more smokers (smoquers).  In the meantime, let's all start eating dinner at 3:00.There...problem solved."
"Smoque is one of our favorite restaurants, which is why we decided to have them cater our wedding.  I contacted them and dealt mainly with Peggy.  I have to say that Peggy was very responsive when I had a question, or when I had an issue.  Smoque came out to our venue a few weeks before the wedding to check everything out....they took photos and measured to ensure everything went smoothly.  Everything was perfect!  Smoque was there on-time with their staff....setup was done before guests arrived....and the food was EXCELLENT!!!  I can't believe (well, I can, it's Smoque afterall!) how many people came up to me during and after the wedding to let me know that this was the best food they've ever had at a wedding!  Well done Peggy...and well done Smoque!  Thanks for making our day awesome!!"
"Um, wow...as I've said many, many reviews before, I come from Texas, so BBQ is something that's easy to screw up.  So after watching Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, I was sold and couldn't wait until winter was over to take the car for a spin and go get some BBQ there!  We waited in line outside for about 30 minutes..and to think I actually considered turning around and leaving b/c I was starving!  This place has it down.  It was cracking me up the tourists taking pictures w/ the owner b/c he was on TV.  Um, no one actually know who that is, you know that right?  But he was super nice and checking on everyone.  There was such limited space I was wondering if we should get it to go.  But it seemed like when someone was ready to sit - a seat was available.  Unfortunatley, it's family style seating and we got sat next to 4 older ladies talking about dirty glasses at a bar and some other stuff...SO not appetizing while you're eating!Now onto the food...it..was...phenomenal!  I couldn't finish it all!  I was trying SO hard to but I couldn't do it!  Chopped brisket sandwich on some yummy yummy bread...mmm...baked beans yum.  I haven't had those in forever!  I wish I could have had this peach cobbler everyone was talking about but I just couldn't eat another bite.  I walked out so very happy and so sleepy from too much food.  I can't wait to go back here and get some more - thank goodness it's not a walk away or I'd be in serious trouble!"
"Whaaaaa?  You haven't gone to Smoque BBQ yet?  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?!?!?!Oh my god, this is now hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  No, not just my fav BBQ place, it's my fav amongst all else in the land.  My friend and I shared all of the following:Pulled Pork SandwichCornbreadColeslawBaked BeansMac & CheesePeach CobblerOk, the baked beans deserve their own paragraph here.  They taste like a campfire!  I mean, it totally took me back to being a kid at a campground, smelling the fire, cooking all the food.  It was just amazing...we were floored by the taste!!!Everything else is superb.  The cornbread was the best I've had in my life, and I've had some cornbread a time or ten thousand.  Holy crap.  Everything was just great.  You must go here.  It's cheap and not too far away and there's street parking...so really, you have no excuse not to go.  Dine in, get carryout, whatever, just get up and go already!xoxoxox love you smoque bbq 4evaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!!!"
"Restaurants in this area get too many stars simply because there is not a big selection in Portage Park/Irving. I think when something is ""DECENT"" the residents jump all over it. That's all this was, decent.  The meat was very tender. The BBQ sauce was only adequate and too runny. I would have actually given it 3 stars based on the meat alone but I needed to even out this place because to me it definitely did not deserve all the 5 stars it has gotten. I've had MUCH better BBQ that was SO flavorful, and paid a better price for it. I didn't like any of the sides; mac n cheese or coleslaw. Both were bland. The fries were alright but I wouldn't even choose them over fast food fries. If you want great BBQ, there are better choices in the city."
"order the brisket... everything else ranges from good to great, but the brisket is freakin life changing... order the brisket."
"There's a line out the door no matter what time you hit this place, apparently!We got in just under the wire before they closed and got the chopped Brisket platter with two sides each. I got the cornbread and the cobbler. Jen got the cornbread and the Mac & Cheese.Seriously brilliant brisket. The cornbread was moist and delicious and the peach cobbler was warm and gooey.It's a lot of food and well worth the wait. Since I've only been here the one time, I can't vouch for any of the other menu items, but the Texas Sausage looked intriguing."
"A rainy weekend afternoon, a decent crowd, and really delish food...   equals:   We'll be coming back!Actually managed to park in their lot (watch the posted hours, though).  Ten-minute line (inside, not out the door, likely due to the downpour).  Lots of happy diners.  Efficient and refreshingly friendly staff.  I liked watching the kitchen tackle all the dine-in, take-out, and call-ahead orders, both from my spot in line and while chowing down.  Makes me feel like they've got nothing to hide.  Darling had the St. Louis ribs - indeed meaty, with a definite smokey smell and taste.  My pulled pork with extra sauce on the side was tender and tasty.  BYOB or partake of fountain drinks.  Semi-spiced fries - good but not exceptional.  Beans with onions and peppers, cornbread with visible corn pieces, drier cole slaw (good for the pulled pork), and mac and cheese with a baked crust in its own little cup -- all worth going back.  $27 including tax.  Not bad at all.Would have kicked it up to 5 stars if the place had been a little less spartan (hey, get a friend to paint a mural or something!) and if the large hvac intake vent directly above my head on the wall had been cleaned in the last year...  All forgiveable, and we will return.  Soon."
"after menu surfing while doing laundry i finally decided that it was time to try smoque. called up the place and ordered ummm...damn near close to everything on the menu...it all started as a chicken platter with mac n cheese and baked beans on the side then i added a taste of brisket and ribs and i had to have dessert right? so i added on peach cobbler...the price of all that was pretty decent as i think bbq places tend to be on the more expensive side. well, when i went to pick up the order turns out they heard ""sausage"" instead of ""chicken"" so I had to wait a little while and they threw in some sausages for the inconvenience. SCORE! i think that if i had ordered the pulled pork you could have branded me a carnivore and just performed a coronary bypass right then.i have to say that the meat was pretty good, except i thought the sausage was a little lacking in flavor...the baked beans were good but a little sweet for my taste. the mac n cheese was good as was the mayo-less coleslaw. the cornbread muffin was rather moist and tasty and the cobbler was decent. overall it was a good meal if i keep in mind that their thing is BBQ and all the other stuff is just bells and whistles. i would def go back though, glad to get this one off the bookmarks!"
"Great BBQ! Down and dirty...paper napkins, mac n cheese in little cups...it's all about the food here!The Pulled Pork, the brisket, the ribs...they're all great...if you can GET them! They sometimes run out of dishes due to the popularity. The sides are amazing as well...I highly recommend the corn bread and mac n cheese."
"Glad the BBQ sauce wasn't too sweet (if you like it tangy) and glad that the meat wasn't inundated in sauce -- they do a 'dry' smoke and happily they provide you with a side of sauce so you can choose how much you want. Doesn't matter what you order here, everything is AMAZING."
"Don't bother with the ribs, you can get better elsewhere but look no further than Smoque for the best brisket and pulled port in the area.  Make sure you get a cornbread cup!Completely casual, no waitstaff, walk up only.  If you want comfort, call ahead for take out and bring it home."
"We drove out from Schaumburg to try Smoque at noon on a Saturday.  It was worth the 30+ minute drive.  The line was shorter than expected.  The available sides were varied just enough to make my husband, my thirteen year old son and myself happy.  I had the beef brisket platter with fries and cornbread.  The bark on the brisket was absolutely delicious!  The hot, fresh fries were served in a brown paper bag with the perfect amount of seasoning.  The cornbread was still warm enough to melt the butter.  I was a bit disappointed at the temperature of the brisket though.  It was chilly in the restaurant, so my brisket got cold really quickly.  My husband had the pulled pork platter with fries and the baked mac n cheese.  Coleslaw came with the meal as well.  He is a big fan of slaw and was pleasantly surprised at their simple, yet yummy slaw.  Finally, my son had a pulled pork sandwich with baked beans and the baked mac n cheese.  I wanted to try what looked like a fresh, soft roll, but by the time I had asked for a bite, it was all gone.  He wasn't a big fan of the breadcrumbs on top of the mac n cheese, but that was a first for him.  We will definitely head back soon.  I think we need to try the chicken, ribs and peach cobbler."
"The brisket is definitely the thing to get at Smoque BBQ. Tender, flavorful and reasonably priced. Order early though, because they do run out, which does not make my husband happy :(. Ribs are OK, but not nearly as good as Fat Willy's."
"***Read my Disclaimer below this review***Smoque should be fired for having sub par BBQ. I ordered take out for me and my roommate last night. The following is a synopsis of what we ordered and what went horribly wrong.Roomie's Order:Brisket Platter - Not much flavor. Not much meat (won't feed a big burly man). Plus side is that it was tender.BBQ sauce on the side - VINEGARY or something. It smelled bad and tasted bitter. Blah.Fries - Best part of the meal. Still weren't that great, though.Mac n Cheese - Small muffin cup sized portion. Tasted a bit eggy.Coleslaw - VINEGARY again. WTF is it with the Heinz up in here? Ick.My Order:Pulled Pork Sandwich - I would have thought this was chicken. No flavor beyond the bread. Put my own Baby Ray's BBQ sauce but could not salvage the sammich.Fries - see above.Coleslaw - see above.This does NOT compare to Fat Willy's. Fat Willy's has great sauces and their coleslaw is distinctive (I love the cilantro in it). Also, FW has steak fries, which kick Smoque's ash.I will also say that neither FW nor Smoque compares to Famous Dave's, which can be found in/near North Riverside.I will not be eating at Smoque again. It was disappointing. I wasn't expecting Carson's Ribs but hey... it's a bit pricey for getting bland food. DISCLAIMER: Portage Park restaurants get 4 and 5 stars all the time like they are government cheese. I believe this is due to the niceness of the residents of this area. The sad truth is that Portage Park has very few dining options that will make you salivate. Do not believe all the superb ratings. I would go by the worst review of any given place. I am all for dives, chains, and fancy places. It all depends on your mood. But one thing I look for is good quality for a decent price."
just yummy
"Finally Chicago has a place that serves good BBQ. I am not your typical loud Texan, but I am from the state. Since I left Texas in 1998, I have not experienced good quality brisket outside of Texas. In addition, I have not had that great of pulled pork since my many wild nights in Memphis...problem solved again.I have no more worries, Barry Sorkin has solved my problems. Barry is not only a very gracious host, but also an expert smoker. Great job Barry....Kristin and I are going to have you cater our Rehersal Dinner.Next stop...a downtown location??????"
"Despite the daunting line, Smoque seems to have a system worked out pretty well where you put your order in and once a table is ready, your food is shortly afterwards. For the food, I had the baby back ribs, which weren't as tender as I'm accustomed to, but were very flavorful and delicious with the BBQ sauce. The cornbread was decent, but the mac and cheese...oh the mac and cheese. Absolutely fantastic! I would order extra mac and cheese next time because one little tin of it is not enough! From the crumbled cheese crunchiness on top to the slightly smoked cheesiness inside, this is a must get. I'll be back to get the mac and cheese again...oh and probably try another entree!"
"There was a time I wasn't crazy about BBQ. Thanks to Barry, I'm a definite convert. I dream about the tender brisket and the juicy chicken at Smoque. Even the sides are drool-worthy. I'm partial to the coleslaw, beans, cornbread and of course the fresh-cut fries. The only improvement I could wish for is a second location closer to me."
"We've been meaning to try Smoque since it opened last year, and finally made the trek up to Pulaski. Maybe it's that my expectations were too high, after hearing such great reviews and seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. Maybe it's that I don't love barbecue sauce in general. Whatever it is, we left disappointed. I thought the macaroni and cheese and the fries were excellent. I loved the way the place was run - order at the counter, then see Barry to get seated. Everyone was super friendly - the woman in front of us in line talked us through what she thought were the best parts of the menu.But the BBQ itself? I wasn't overly impressed. I got the brisket - half chopped, half sliced, and while it was tender and the meat itself had a good flavor, I thought the vinegary BBQ sauce distracted from the flavor. I also thought that it was too fatty for my taste, but that's just me. Mike got the pulled pork, and he liked it, but said he'd had better pulled pork at Kuma's. He might stop by on his way home from work to pick up some BBQ for himself for dinner, but I think I probably won't be back to Smoque, at least not any time soon."
absolutely the best bbq everrrrrrrrrrr!!!!
"Smoque BBQ has excellent food!  The ribs, chicken, baked beans and mac and cheese are absolutely my favorite.  I am not a fan of peach cobbler; however, the peach cobbler from Smoque is pleasingly unforgettable.  By far the best peach cobbler I have ever had!!  A little small  and crowded for eating in for my taste, but great for take out."
"I was sitting in my cousin's room and he says ""you wanna get some good barbeque?"" as he sat on the computer. He was watching youtube videos of the Food Network (which I'm sure was in violation of strict copyright and redistributing laws) and showed me these raving reviews of this joint called Smoque. All the people were saying ""this brisket is better than Mississippi"" and whatnot. So, I thought myself if I get brisket at Smoque, then I can eliminate going to Mississippi. Really, there's no reason to go to Mississippi besides barbeque.So, I says ""hell yeah,bro, let's get that brisket"". I wasn't even that hungry, but I'm a fat glutton and love delicious food. We roll six deep over to Smoque.We go inside and there are bunch of scattered tables with no seating that could accommodate us six. Basically, two of us have to sit by the bathrooms, two of us by the windows and the last two sit by themselves one either side of an elderly Korean couple by the soda machine. They have a guy walking around trying to smoosh people together.Eating is my favorite social event and I can't talk about stupid things that happened at work or about girls I hooted at while driving, then what's the point of eating together? The other people in a restaurant don't want hear about women I yelled at today. No one is interested in that, especially not that elderly Korean couple.To say the least, I thought not being able to comfortably accommodate 30 people at one time is something most popular restaurants should be able to do. I don't think I'm being picky.It took me twenty or so minutes to get to the order taker girl. My five friends all went before me and all ordered this famous brisket I've been hearing so much about (from the youtube). I get up there and ask for the brisket platter. This girl told me they just ran out of brisket. I am completely bewildered as to how five people, and countless before us, ordered brisket with no problem. ""Fine, you know what, let me get the pulled pork. I can't believe you ran out of brisket so abruptly, but that's fine. I'll just take the pork, it's fine. Whatever.""No dice. The girl told me they just ran out of pork as well. Smoque has four different things: chicken, ribs, brisket and pork, and they just ran out of two of those four things.This girl said that she could take my money and if somehow they find brisket, they could give it to me. I said I didn't want anything else based on principle. Restaurants shouldn't run out of half of their types of food. It's like going to McDonald's and they didn't have any more hamburgers or any sort. I don't want chicken McNuggets (metaphorically), I want some damn brisket (literally).I know what you're thinking, they turned me down because I'm ugly. Not true as I am quite handsome. Apparently, handsome doesn't get you brisket in this town anymore.So, I sat there, pretty hungry and with no food on my non-plate. My friends all pitied me, offering me some of their food. I had a taste of their brisket (it was aight) and some of their fries (mostly aight).There was mac and cheese that was disgusting and coleslaw that looked like it was made by a chef with no hands.The owner or some self-important guy with a belt clip cell phone and zubaz pants walking around the twenty square feet of dining area asking how everything was going. I think he knew better than to ask me because I would let him have it.I saved the thirteen some odd dollars I would have spent on something I never wanted to eat that wouldn't have been good anyway and spent a third of that on some awesome Wendy's.If I could give Smoque one fourth of a star, I so would.Love,MarvinP.S. It was all white people working there. What do white people know about barbeque anyway?"
"Brisket sandwich = heaven.  I got one, ate it, and had to order another for lunch the next day.  The sides are wonderful as well.  Go early, they're always busy!!!"
"Woah nelly, this is some good bbq!!!The place was packed but it was a real orderly operation with a guy finding a table for you while you waited in line. So clever. I got the pulled pork sammich while Hubster had the chopped brisket. We both got mac 'n cheese as a side since we spied it at other tables and it looked great.Meat was superb and I am obviously echoing what everyone else has already said. Dy-no-mite! The mac 'n cheese was KILLER though, I wish I had ordered 3 more orders of it. That's the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, the sides are too small! I loved the cute little individual portion aluminum cups the mac came in, going to have to try that at home!"
"If you eat alot of BBQ, you know that when you get to a certain level, it's just a matter of preference.   For what smoque is going for .. i've never had better.  And i love what they're going for.I love the mac'n'cheese.  creamy cheesy, but not too heavy. with some crunchy breadcrumbs on top.  I love the BBQ Beans .. best side ever.  I like the fries, corn bread, and cole slaw.  All done very well, and they all seem to balance with the meat.The brisket is AWESOME.  The Pulled Pork is AWESOME (still need to try the ribs).  You can't go wrong.  It's not as fatty as other BBQ's, meaning you can eat a ton and not feel to sick the next day.  The sauce is good in a mellow way - i like it, but i would love if they had a spicer option.The price (value) is pretty good, too.  Sandwich and fries for like $7 .. or split the platter with your girlfriend and get an extra side or two .. under $20 for both of you.Atmosphere is perfect - casual, but not dirty.  Can be a wait, but worth it. Beautiful."
"Just visited Smoque for the first time with some dear friends who are in town and I must say----pretty AMAZING.  I love BBQ, but my experiences with really authentic tastes have been limited to Memphis (the rest of my experiences come from places like TGI Fridays...gulp) and that's it.  So it was great to try something new! I had a half slab of babyback ribs (plenty!), the mac & cheese, and the brisket chili.  The barbeque sauce is ON POINT with the ribs--I had to keep dipping them into the side cup because it was just soooo good.  The macaroni was also phenomenal---crusty on the top, gooey on the inside, and VERRRRRRY cheesy.  I didn't like the brisket chili, however...it was a gametime decision and was actually a little odd tasting.  I did, however, steal some of my hubb's fries and they were off the chains good. Be prepared for a no-frills, no-nonsense interior that is PACKED with people.  You order your food first then they find you a seat.  We did have to wait in line a fairly long time, but it was worth it.  Delicious stuff, y'all!"
"I had the brisket and was of the opinion that it was good, not great.  It hardly rates up against the Texas BBQ that apparently attempts to emulate, such as Cooper's in Llano, Country Tavern in Kilgore or Salt Lick outside of Austin.  All three beat the socks off this place.  That being said, Smoque is serviceably good.  I'd go back, but it's not going to envoke the mouthwatering daydreams that any of the above mentioned places might.  I do appreciate that it's BYOB.  However, they are definitely in need of an expansion, as the place is very tight and looks like it would often have a wait."
"Location is terrible, the beef brisket is pretty good. Make sure you order the sliced version, it's much better.  The sides are great but pretty small.  If you live in the city, Fat Willy's or SmokeDaddy's are better BBQ alternatives."
"I don't know what all the hype about this place is. Although I have to admit, a BBQ place in the vicinity is not really to be found, and I do like that it is in the neighborhood. But seriously the food was just ""okay"". I gave it 3 stars because I only went there once and had experienced only a small part of the menu. I have an open mind, and I will go again....my ratings could change after another time there.I don't care about how the seating is and the crowds, I'm used to it at about any popular place in Chicago. My gripe was that for all the hype, I expected some kick butt ribs. I orderd a chopped brisket sandwich with mac n cheese. The brisket was OKAY. I didn't really care of the stale type of bread, and I didn't like the taste of the sandwich sauce. Although decent, my palete craved a different taste. I LOVED the mac n Cheese however. Very Very good.I added on a 1/4 slab of st. louis ribs. DRY, NASTY, NOT MEATY at all. I know there are two different kinds...but seriously bad. My daughter who loves bbq and ribs of all sorts.....stuck her nose up to these doozys and ate frenchfries for dinner that night. I don't care for the excesive tartness of the BBQ sauce either. I know everyone has different tastes for BBQ. I guess I am spoiled by Famous Daves which I adore. I would rather take the drive to Berwym to eat at Famous Daves, than eat at Smoquee again. With that said, like I mentioned before, I am willing to give it another try. I'll do a follow up post when I do."
"The wait sucked, the seating sucked. The food was great. I'm not a big bbq fan but this food was delightful. I ordered the brisket that came with a side of mac and cheese and coleslaw, even though I told  the cashier no coleslaw was wanted. Boy i'm glad she gave me some coleslaw because it was great. It was vinegar based and I ate all of it, I usually stray away from coleslaw but it was great. The mac and cheese was some of the best i've had. The portion was small but it was amazing. The brisket was good and I had plenty of leftvovers for the next day."
"Excellent Pulled Pork sandwich, but it would be better if they toasted their buns! The baked beans were sweet, hearty and full of flavor. Mac and cheese was way too rich for our tastes (it was kinda like a cheese casserole)Friendly, fun staff and the line moves fast. Great ribs too. The St. Louis were better than the baby back ribs."
My sister was visiting from California and she insisted we try this place she heard about - I'm so glad we did! The food is really great. I absolutely love the mac and cheese (YUMMO). I had the BBQ chicken and my sister had the BBQ beef brisket. I liked the brisket better - especially with the slaw. Took a beef brisket sandwich home for lunch the next day hehe. I can't wait to go again!
"While I didn't eat at the restaurant, I am currently falling into a food coma from horking down Smoque's food via company catering.The mac and cheese was my downfall; I sneaked extra helpings after everyone vacated the conference room. I've traveled through the south extensively, eating from roadside vendors under corrugated steel shacks dishing out the best BBQ ever ... Smoque is the next best thing. The cole slaw has the perfect tangy kick without being too vinegary. Everything was so tasty I just called my husband and switched our date night from a pricey suburban restaurant to Smoque.BYOB and scrumptious BBQ? Smoque BBQ found a direct path to this girl's heart."
"Very popular place.  The wait to order was long and it was filled to over capacity.  The staff was very friendly.  They adjusted my bill after I misunderstood the menu and ordered an extra side by accident.  The half rack of ribs is enough to fill one or two people.  The brisket and ribs were just okay.  Nothing really special or flavorful.  The side dishes were small, but tasty.  Good mayo-free cole slaw and good mac & cheese.  BYOB.  Easy to get to off of the train, but wouldn't say it was worth the trip out of the city lines."
"Well here it is. I guess it's a common theme that people basically join Yelp just to review a place, and for me that place is Smoque. I've now been here three or four times,  gotten carryout probably 5 more times, and have officially had everything on the menu. The brisket is a revelation. Get the brisket. It is a little dry because it's BRISKET, and brisket is dry, but the chew, the flavor of the rub, and the sauce, oh my stars the sauce! The ribs are outstanding (I get St. Louis because I like meat, not just tenderness), and the half chicken is by far the most deeply flavored and moist I've ever had. My girlfriend raves about the baked beans, but I have to get two mac n'cheese and an extra side (it's like $2!) of cobbler. I can't even talk about the cobbler because there just aren't any words. The best is the taste menu. I can never settle on one thing, but since everything is so damn cheap here (a platter with two sides is $12 and change), I can get an extra side and then a bit of either brisket, chicken, or ribs (whatever I didn't order for the main), for an extra $3-4, and have it all. Surely I deserve it."
"The food at Smoque is EXCELLENT.  I understand that the long lines, somewhat cramped (when crowded) confines, and the potential for running out of key menu items have the potential to detract from the overall experience (these are the only reasons I'm rating less than 5 stars).  However, food-wise, it's easy to see that all of the negative/mediocre reviews have been written by folks who are either inexperienced in BBQ (particularly the smoked kind) or hold a grudge against the place because of its popularity in the media, and were just looking for some aspect of the restaurant's service or aesthetics to rail against.As for my own opinion, let me just say that beef brisket is one of my favorite foods.  I've cooked it at home (using a recipe that requires 2 days to prepare), I order it frequently at Irish pubs (""corned beef"" is almost always a brisket cut) and Jewish delis, and I have had the ""real BBQ"" brisket in Texas and other parts of the South -- not to mention many joints in Chicagoland and elsewhere.  The brisket at Smoque was at least as good as any I've ever had!  So good -- and so much more enjoyable because of how hard it is find it prepared this perfectly!  I've had plenty of dried-out and/or tasteless and/or overly fatty brisket in my life -- trust me, this is the real stuff, done right.I enjoyed the pulled pork as well -- I can't think of a better place for pulled pork in Chicago, but Smoque's version doesn't really stand out either.  I think that's because pulled pork is a little easier than Brisket to get right (you can easily make a pretty decent ""faux-smoked"" version in any Chicago kitchen just by browning a big pork shoulder roast and then letting it cook all day in the slow-cooker, bathed in about half a bottle of Liquid Smoke -- no other liquid is necessary.  Pull it apart when you're done, and taste the goodness).As for the sides at Smoque, they were great too.  As a Chicagoan I'm a sucker for fresh-cut fries and these were as good as I've had -- the ""small"" is a huge piping-hot bag, liberally seasoned with cracked pepper but not oversalted.  The cornbread and mac-and-cheese were solid too -- very small ""side"" portions of each, but they were rich and tasty enough to make up for that.  I personally don't like cole slaw but my wife enjoyed hers -- she doesn't like the kind slathered in mayo, but this was vinegar-based and hit the spot for her.UPDATE: As of my initial review I hadn't yet tried the ribs or chicken, but we just ordered carry-out last night and got to sample the St. Louis ribs and the smoked chicken.  Both were out of this world good -- and now that I've tried both sauces I can say they're both wonderful.  Thus, despite any misgivings about the ambience of the restaurant, I am compelled to upgrade from 4 stars to 5 stars!"
"Sheesh. This place has gotten to the point where you can't get their food anymore. The smoked stuff is ready or it isn't, right? They smoke it for 14 hours, or whatever, so they are not making it to order, so to speak. Nevertheless, two Saturdays in a row we tried to place a take-out order. The first was at 6:30 and they were not accepting orders anymore. The second was at 5:00 and they said it would be one hour forty minutes for PICK UP!Look, the food is fine, but this is silly. It just isn't that good. We have substituted a different place and have been thrilled so far (Smokey's on Northwest Highway)."
"Good enough for a wedding reception (according to my fiance)!My fiance took me to Smoque the other evening so I could try the food he wants catered for our wedding.  We're still debating about Smoque catering our wedding, but I'm totally open to the rehersal dinner.  The BBQ was AMAZING!  He and I split a plate of the pulled pork with 2 sides and it filled both of us up no problem.  Their staff is very friendly and helpful and I was amazed at how smoothly the ordering and waiting went considering how long the line was (when a line is out the door, it's gotta be good!)"
"Most of what you can know about this place has been summed up here a hundred times - but for my two cents, I have to say that as a Texan, I am happy to report this place is legit.Though the cooking staff isn't wearing boots or cowboy hats, and I was the only one in the joint saying ""yall,"" I still felt like they had captured a bit of the Lone Star State without the 14 hr drive usually required for me to get my BBQ on.The brisket was charred just right, moist & juicy on the inside.  I had it on a sammich with bread almost as thick as Texas toast (which is a good thing).  I also tried the ""Texas Sausage.""  It was as good as you could get it up here--- with flavor of mesquite wood and a bit of pecan.. it tasted the way I expected -- which is as good an endorsement as any.The sides were a mix of success & failure. My friend had the slaw on his platter-- only average.  I had decent cornbread, but I'll never understand why Chicago bbq places serve their sides in little tin foil muffin cups. Who created this rule?  The mac & cheese is a definite winner - and it's got a lot more flavor & depth than the typical elbow mac with Rico's cheese sauce.. I tasted at least a couple cheeses and the crust was excellent.The clincher?  SWEET TEA.  Yeah, sure, this is probably the least exciting part of the menu to most people, but for me it is a mandatory to have either sweet tea or beer with bbq.  They had both on the menu.  Thank goodness I can count on this place for a bit of back-home goodness between trips to Dallas.Update: Turns out this place is BYOB.  So bring your own Shiner or Lone Star..."
"I wrote a review of this a few days ago, but it has apparently disappeared into the Internet's black hole of missing pages.My husband and I each had the brisket, and it beats just about any other brisket I've had.  I'm from Kentucky...land of the Moonlite B-B-Q Inn (world famous barbecue joint), so I know barbecue when I have it.  Portions were generous, the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the atmosphere was friendly.  Beware of the ""family style"" tables in the tiny restaurant, though.  We got there around 6:30 on a Friday for dinner, and a line began to form soon after--so go early.Be warned:  it was featured on the Food Network (we didn't know this), so a lot of the patrons are coming from that particular buzz.  We actually saw the feature on when we got home from dinner.  How weird is that?"
"This place is awesome. I love BBQ but try not to eat it too often. so when i do, i want it to be great and this place hits the mark. We ordered for a big group so i got to taste almost everything. The brisket, pulled pork, chicken are all good. My favorite was the brisket. The ribs are great too although they have too much sauce for me. i like the dry rub rib style. This will be my go to place for 'que."
"After reading all the praise here on Yelp, I was really excited to try Smoque. I'm a BBQ fiend. I'm particularly fond of Texas style brisket, but I love all BBQ.I was very disappointed with the food at Smoque. The people were nice, but the brisket was possibly the worst I've ever had. I thought the pork was OK, but my wife didn't care for that much either. Totally overrated."
"We ordered rib combo (1/2 slab of St louis and baby back ribs), sliced brisket, cornbread and mac & cheese. The best thing of them all was the brisket. It was tender, juicy, and melt in your mouth. Everything else was average. I would go back just for the brisket."
"Simplicity is the key. The owners have wisely kept their operation small and the menu limited - which takes a lot of self control when your restaurant becomes a gold mine.The food is prepared to perfection and is delicious. BBQ is amazing, the fries are fantastic, cole slaw is really good - try it even if you don't like slaw. (it comes with anyway) The atmosphere is nonexistent unless you consider metal prison trays and people yelling numbers atmosphere. But hey - If you go to a BBQ joint for atmosphere you are probably leading a disappointed life already.If you are getting the fries (and you should, the first time at least) it is better to eat there unless you live pretty close, they need to be eaten quickly."
"Is there better brisket in the city?  That is a resounding NO!  This is the best bbq I have had in Chicago.  I have been to Texas, Kansas City and all over the country eating BBQ and Smoque is the best around.  I never had better St. Louis Ribs or Brisket.  Chopped is awesome, but sliced is good to.  The Baked Beans are to die for and mac n' cheese, forget it.  I will greatly miss Smoque when we move to Denver.  Get it while you can."
Smoque is the BEST BBQ in the city!  Go mid-afternoon to avoid a huge crowd.
"Finally went early enough to not have to wait to get in. Smoque has the best BBQ I've eaten since living in Texas. Had a sampler platter which included brisket, pulled pork and Texas sausage. Paired with lovely browned Mac n cheese and cornbread this meal brought me back to the BBQ I remember eating for so many years. The brisket was so moist and delicious there was no need to cut anything. Simply fell apart on your plate. They have 3 different sauces all wonderful. I preferred the spicy which was tangy but added a nice touch of heat.  I can't wait to make my next trip to Smoque which will be very soon!"
"I've been eating at Smoque BBQ for quite sometime now. I imagine if you go to Texas and tell them the best brisket you've tasted is in Chicago, you'd be in trouble... you'd also be correct.The brisket is the reason to go to Smoque, the sides are a reason to stay. Smoque is authentic and actually uses a smoker to cook the brisket. You shouldn't need a knife to cut it and you don't. The mac & cheese, fries, and baked beans are excellent dishes. If you're really hungry, get the fries because they give you enough to hold you over.Everything is well priced, I either get the pop for free refills or take advantage of the byob. The other food is also of high quality, but if I have to make a suggestion, the sausage isn't spicy enough for me and I'd love to see them introduce a different bbq sauce. The current one is fantastic, but a variety wouldn't hurt."
To date I haven't left this place unsatisfied--but I cannot say these are the best ribs I've ever had.  The Brisket and pulled pork is the best I've had anywhere though.Be prepared to wait..but service is typically good in getting you set up with a table.I dream of the peach cobbler.
"The brisket is the best I've had in Chicago,  but the ribs left something to be desired.   The smoked brisket has an excellently spiced rub and the meat melts in your mouth.  I tried both the St. Louis style and the baby back ribs.  Both were palatable but defiantly on the dry side.  This is a no frills, legit BBQ joint.   Right off of 90/94, so very accessible by car.  My Vote: 3.5 stars... (+0.5 for the friendly staff)"
"This place would get five stars except for the seating arrangement. Yes, I'm a baby because I don't like sitting next to other people like I'm at a church picnic. I'm sure, however, that there are dozens of us. The food is incredible. Best pulled pork sandwich ever. People are okay. Not terribly nice, but I don't really care about that. Just counter service. Ugh. Tasty tasty.  Go there. My brother even likes it."
"What can i say that anybody else has not said? Well just a couple suggestions. Choose take out instead of dining in because that place is tiny and you will be elbow to elbow with everybody. I should have called in my order but the line wasn't that long and it still took 45 min to place an order. This was my 1st bbq restaurant experience and it did not disappoint. Tried brisket for the 1st time in my life and it was yummy, it also had a really good smokey flavor. The mac & cheese was the best i've ever had. Baked beans were good, I just wasn't a fan of the onions in them. My bbq quest has just started!"
"Brisket, awesome. Mac and Cheese, delicious. Cornbread, melt in your mouth. It is a simple place that does BBQ right. No bells and whistles, just order your food sit down and enjoy. Also it is BYOB so I don't know what more you can ask for."
i've been to smoque when it first opened a few years back and didn't return until recently when i was waiting for my mechanic at grace automotive to finish with my car. i ordered take out the beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and mac and cheese.  i had forgotten how delicious it all was. i love how their fries are greatly induced with black pepper! i didn't mind waiting for the oil change as i munched on their awesome fries.
"I feel like I've done a good deed. I brought back food from Smoque to my co-workers. They LOVED it!!! Could not stop hearing raves about it. Pulled pork, brisket, ribs, mac n cheese, PEACH COBBLER!!!!! I've had cobbler only a few times in my life, this by far is the best I've had.  Encrusted with bits of slice almonds, sweet sugary crust and a caramel like filling w/bit sized peaches. I'm glad they only serve it in little portions or I may have gone well over my alotted amount of cobbler!!!"
"Yeah, this is the place that was featured on one of Guy Fieri's shows, however, that is not the only reason to try this place out! I flew into ORD and was scooped and schlept to this fantastic place, as it is a great stop on the way back into the city. Super friendly staff, rub vs. a sauce (take it from a Texan, it is solid!) and served i a very stylish and ""separate"" way! I went with the brisket platter with 2 sides. I look forward to returning on my next trip back to this taste bud tantalizing town!"
"Great Pulled Pork sandwich.  Mac & Cheese seemed a bit small but all in all I was full when done eating.  Parking is a bit tough, signs all over saying no parking for Smoque customers or unless you have a permit."
"Easily the best BBQ in Chicago.  Pulled pork, Brisket, Ribs:  all kill the competition.  Peach Cobbler, Mac and Cheese, Slaw...are all worth the trip alone.  I'm writing this after having been to EVERY other BBQ joint in the city (never had the ribs at Twin Anchors, but I've had the pulled pork).This place is no joke.  Yes, the place is on the small side.  But I'm not rating BBQ places on the seating situation.  It's comfortable.  The food blows my mind.  It's worth the trip."
"You ever have one of those moments when you bite into your meal, and you nearly collapse under the weight of unbridled joy, a feeling that everything is right with the world, complete, unmitigated pleasure?I had one of those moments at Smoque.As a lifelong Chicagoan, I have always felt ""barbeque deprived.""  Let's face it, our fair city does not have a reputation as a smoked meats mecca.  I especially felt slighted when I'd visit my brother in Austin, Texas, which has knee-buckling good barbeque on virtually every corner.  Smoque is the one place I've found in Chicago that comes close to replicating top-flight Texas barbeque.  The brisket is tender and bursting with flavor.  The St. Louis-style ribs (FAR superior to the baby backs, in my humble opinion) are fall off the bone tender, and paired with a tangy, vinegary barbeque sauce that puts Carson's molasses-based abomination to shame.  The sides are excellent - particularly the macaroni and cheese.  And this might be the highest compliment I can give - I ate every bite of my coleslaw, a food I generally despise."
"My Order:-Chopped brisket: (might have been my mistake. I also ordered 1 lb of the sliced brisket and pulled pork and when I got home and it was much better... even when it was nuked.):  In my opinion it was a bit on the dry side, although I did not eat it right away.-BBQ sauce: Definitely waaaay too watery, not watered down but on the runny side.  -Side of mac&cheese: A plus. Nice and cheesy just the way I like it. Also nice and hot!!-Baked Beans: Good flavor. -Cornbread: It was alright, a bit on the dry side (though again, it wasn't consumed immediately.)All in all, I think  I'd give it another shot if I went back to Chicago.  Plenty of other good BBQ places in the Bay Area.Minus 1 star for the BBQ sauce/soup and lack of BBQ sauce when the 1lb of brisket and pulled pork was ordered."
The meat briskett was very tender but I do not care for vinigar based sauce.  The sides are very tiny for the price.  This place gets such great reviews but for me did not live up to the hype.
"I have eaten at the Salt Lick in Austin, TX more times than I can remember.  I used to think they had the best BBQ in all the land, but now I must confess that Smoque is vying for that sauce-slathered place in my heart.  Their brisket is amazing - it comes out hot and tender with a sauce that compliments it well.  The sausage is delicious and authentically Texan.  Their mac and cheese is wonderful, their cobbler quite tasty and their coleslaw is some of the only slaw I've ever liked.  So what's holding them back?  A sad absence of pickles, onions and potato salad.  Then again, the owner (manager?) said it's perfectly fine to bring my own jar of pickles next time, so bonus points for Smoque.  I'm serious about the potato salad, though - a Texas BBQ dinner just isn't complete without it!  Oh, and you may also end up waiting for anywhere from 10 minutes to half an hour depending on when you arrive, and end up sitting quite closely to some strangers.  But that's just how things are done when it comes to Texas BBQ, from my experience, so I didn't think too much of it.  Sucks in the winter to wait outside, but you can always call ahead for pick up or to check if they haven't run out of brisket (or whatever is your fancy)."
"Highly over rated!  What kind of bbq joint doesn't server beer?  Sorry but i've had better ribs and they are not worth the wait at this tiny joint.  Parking stinks, the wait stinks, the food is....meh.  I don't get it, what do people see in this place, even the mac and cheese was mediocre."
"I really liked the food - Mac and Cheese, pulled pork, cornbred, cobbler... tasty tasty.  Can't wait to try the chicken.  Some of the best BBQ I have had in Chicago - but I must disclose that I am a novice to this genre of eats.Typically, Carolina style sauce is not really my thing - I would rather a nice thick, sticky, sweet Kansas City style sauce - but this totally worked for me this time.  The whole edible package was damn good.Overall, I can't say that I was excited about the atmosphere... the method of seatings straight stressed me out and it was so minimal I felt as though I were in a cafeteria at a tiny college.The BYOB feature is great, but they are obviously moving people in and out as fast as possible, you get the stink eye if you try to linger drinking beer for too long."
Salad at a BBQ Joint?I just had the salad with chicken from Smoque BBQ.  For the first time in my 39 years I did a salad when I could have had smoked meat.  Just too much good eating this week.  Damn if it wasn't tasty.  The chicken was moist by breast standards and had a nice smoke flavor.  Could have used a little more spice and another thimble of dressing but then again it could have been a rack of ribs.
"Smoque has the best beef brisket I've had in the city.  Any place that has more than one cop car outside has to be good. I definitely agree with Natalie T.  You have to order for pick up.  The lines have been getting ridiculous. I chit chat with the owner whenever I'm on the phone or in line and he says the same thing, that he loves that it's loved by Chicagoians, but hates that it's getting so busy.  Apparently, the idea was for it to be a neighborhood spot, only it's so good EVERYONE goes there.  So, the neighbors have been complaining, and it's not been very friendly.So, I do my part and get in and get out.  Take out has been great.  It's always ready when they say it will be and it's travels well.Tips:1. When ordering the beef brisket, get the dinner (brisket chopped) and two buns.  It's enough for two sandwiches and cheaper than doing separate orders.2. If you like mac & cheese, try theirs.  It's good, portioned out -if you are an addict like me, and it's got a great breadcrumb topping.3.  If you like fresh cut fries, you'll probably like theirs.  However, if you don't like pepper, then don't get them.  They tend to be on the peppery side."
"WOW!  As far as BBQ goes, Smoque has it covered.  What a fantastic lunch to have.  I stopped in over the weekend to check it out as I had been wanting to ever since I saw it on ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"".  I came in with my GF and I decided to try the pulled pork, with a side of beans, then we also ordered a small order of fries and a large mac n cheese.I have no complaints whatso-ever.  And I have to say, the people around me didn't seem to either.  There was a family of about 7 people, who ordered various items and literally made them disappear within minutes then decided to order a couple pounds of brisket and some ribs and various other items to go.ANYWAY - back to my food, the pulled pork was pulled perfection.  I have never had a pulled pork sandwich that when you took the first bite, you get an explosion of smoquey-ness in your mouth, followed up by that nice subtle pork flavor and BBQ sauce.  Phenomenal.  MMmmm..The beans, where could they go wrong, there was so many different flavors and chunks of meat that made these probably some of the best beans I have ever had.The mac n cheese?  I cant even begin to describe.  If you are used to eating Krap Mac N Cheese, this is going to blow you away.  The parmesan crust on the top, and the warm cheesy soft macaroni's are what dreams are made of.And Fresh Cut Fries - how can you go wrong?  Seasoned to perfection - and for a small, the portions were more then enough for me and the girlfriend.If you haven't been to Smoque, what are you smoquing?  Get off your butt and get there for some good eatin'!"
"Visiting old friends in Chicago.  One is a vegetarian and the other a repressed meat eater.  BBQ sounded perfect!The brisket was pleasantly or perhaps slightly over smoky. The slaw as crisp with vinegar.  The beans also quite smoky with bits of brisket.I liked the smoke, but some might find it overwhelming.  I think this is great BBQ for Chicago, but it really can't hold a candle to NC or TX BBQ.Bonus points for sweet tea being available with free refills."
"Best brisket in Chicago--hands down.Small location with a line outside by Noon on the weekends. But it's worth the wait! Slow-cooked brisket that barely stays together when picking up with your fork. Which is a lesson folks...USE YOUR HANDS!!! Get sloppy, it's BBQ!The ribs are tender with a nice smoke ring, but I'm sure you can find others in Chicago with similar taste. If you want what they're good at, stick with the brisket.Also, the sides are tasty as well. The baked beans actually have brisket trimmings in them. The peach cobbler is a sweet and crunchy treat as well.Last time I went, I bought the meat by the pound and am savoring pieces in my fridge like gold. Ha."
"Best Brisket In Chicago!!!!!I learned about smoked brisket when living in Oklahoma, and haven't had one since that was as good as Mahylon's in Muskogee.  Now I've found it.  The fries are also fantastic, and the slaw is top notch.  Fiancee likes the Mac & Cheese, and it's BYOB, which is always nice.Loses one star for ambiance.  The space is about as interesting as a McDonald's, and it's always crowded.  They could have used twice the space.  They also tend to run out of brisket pretty early on busy nights, which is a bummer when you have a craving."
"This is easily the best BBQ that I've ever had.  The St. Louis style ribs here will spoil any enjoyment that you ever would have eating ribs elsewhere.  The cole slaw, peach cobbler, and baked bean sides were all perfect.  The mac and cheese side could be improved upon, it ends up having too many of the crumbs from the top on it for my liking.  I'm going to start bringing out of towners here to show off how amazing our BBQ is."
"I'm from Kansas City and I didn't even really like BBQ until I ate at Smoque and my neighbor, Bob's. Really, my neighbor, not a restaurant."
"Really, really good BBQ - probably some of the best if not the best I've had.  Flavorful and wonderful combo of moist yet smokey, sweet, and crisp on the edges - BBQ perfection is what I'd call this.  And their coleslaw is the best anywhere - crispy with a wonderfully sweet vinegar taste - yum!  I would have given them 5 stars but there is only so far you can go with BBQ food - that and the communal tables were a bit of a turn-off, but for BBQ this good - I'll be back for sure and I'll bring more friends next time !  If you are a fan of good traditional BBQ - you must try Smoque BBQ !"
"I saw a review of them on Check Please. It exceeded my expectations. Some of the best BBQ I ever had. I tried everything... I know, I'm fatty. But it was sooooo good. I wonder why they have no other locations? And the one they have, is so tiny"
"Waited in line, place was packed, order full rack of st. louis and baby back ribs mac n cheese cole slaw, corn bread, pulled pork, and fries. Shared all this with two friends. The bbq was good, but I will begin my review by saying I am more of a wet bbq than dry bbq fan when it comes to ribs meaning I like my ribs covered in bbq sauce while still being cooked. These ribs had an extremely smokey flavor which if you like is good. The dry rub left me so parched that I was chugging water well into the night. Mac n cheese was ok, but wouldn't say it was out of this world. Corn bread was okay but I like my corn bread sweeter. Fries were good but pretty plain. Pulled pork was good but a touch dry. Cole slaw was interesting and vinegar-y. BBQ sauce was good but i like having a choice of different sauces. Smoque is good but I wont wait in line for it again and fight the crowds to get a table. I think there are other better options in Chicago."
"awesome pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and love the vinaigrette cole slaw"
Geeze am I a total curmudgeon? I'm really not that excited by this place.  First of all the lines are annoying.  You have to serve some pretty fanfuckingtastic  BBQ for me to stand in a line around the corner.The sides suck. They really do.  The salad sucks.  The BBQ is good but not great.  That's about all I can say for this place.
"I'm sure Smoque is a meat lovers heaven - all I saw were huge piles of meat. Everywhere. Meat up to the gills!I however, am a vegetarian.We went here when celebrating a co-workers birthday. Naturally, I'm the only vegetarian so I was left with very, very few options. I ordered sides (which are the size of a baby food jar), so I had all these little tin foil containers in front of me. I got the slaw, mac N cheese and cornbread.Not bad, not bad at all. I also nibbled at a co-workers fries. Yes, the sides were good, but it was a strange experience eating my meal out of 5 tiny tin foil containers. I wish they could have just put them on a plate or something. My co-workers seemed to enjoy themselves . . . they ate until they couldn't anymore. I'm giving it 4 stars to represent their satisfaction, basically. I'm a fish eating vegetarian (a pescatarian?), so clearly this isn't the place for me."
"Great BBQ (disclaimer I have only had the brisket and always get the spicy BBQ sauce).   I also love their sides, the BBQ beans, cornbread and cobbler are great.Perhaps the best endorsement was the next table over, two guys who come very week and order nothing but two pounds of brisket to go with their twelve pack of beer.  :0)"
"So let me tell you, watching the food network before bed is a bad idea.  Catching an episode that involves BBQ is probably the worst you can do for yourself and to top it off they cover a place in Chicago.  All day I dream about BBQ!  I had BBQ on the brain all day at work and when the time finally came to head to SMOQUE I was so excited.  We get there and just manage to beat the rush and ordered our dinners.  Immediately I recognized the guy that was on TV telling the host how they do their beans, brisket rub, ribs etc and things were smelling wonderfully.  I was greeted by the nice lady at the counter who took my order of chopped brisket, mac and cheese, slaw, beans and a taste of the pulled pork.  The taste option is pretty cool, I should have gotten a taste of everything but I didn't want to over stuff myself and ruin my experience at Smoque.The brisket was very tender and the BBQ sauce was kind of lacking.  I guess I'm not a fan of vinegar based BBQ sauce  but aside from that the tenderness and texture of the meat was amazing.  The meat really made up for the BBQ sauce.  I'd recommend the chopped brisket but you can't really go wrong with any of the meats there.  The mac and cheese was pretty good and the beans were pretty good too.  The peach cobbler was very tasty.  My only gripe was the price, I thought you'd get a little bit more for what you pay for.  One thing I thought was pretty nice was the host type guy who walked around and made sure everything was going OK.  I thought that was a nice touch for a BBQ joint.Ah well, no biggie.  Maybe next time I'll try the ribs"
"My boss had a taste for BBQ so when that happens, I head to Smoque.  Plus I had a $25 gift card from them because they forgot a couple of coleslaws on a $100 order!  How's that for customer service/appreciation!!  Anyway, I got my usual half and half platter of pulled pork and slice brisket.  5 incredibly thick, tender slices of brisket and a huge pile of pulled pork with sides of beans and slaw.  Outstanding!!  My boss and another coworker had half slab of baby back rib dinners and I didn't hear any complaints coming from the conference room so I'll take that they enjoyed their lunch!  Good job Smoque!  See you soon!!!"
"I like the half and half sandwich meal.  Brisket chopped.The baby back ribs are good as well but price at about $22.My girlfriend loves their mac and cheese, I like the fries and beans.  The beans are great because of the bacon? and bbq beef in them.We always get carry out.  It is best to show up early or inbetween lunch and dinner."
"The Brisket Sandwich was so good that I ate the meat first, then the bread!  Highly recommend Smoque BBQ, it is by far my favorite BBQ joint."
"We went there on my birthday (April 18) because I read great reviews.  It's a small joint, and you have to bring your own alcohol.But, the baby back ribs and brisket sandwich were incredible.  My wife prides herself on making great ribs (she put them on the grill and then into an oven for hours over low heat).I couldn't believe that she loved the ribs here.  It's replaced our favorite rib joint (previously held by Twin Anchors).This is a joint.  the atmosphere is pure neighborhood with no fancy waiters.But the line was out the door before we left, and I understand why."
The price is right and the food is amazing.  We had Smoque cater a party last Summer and it was delicious.  Not a bite was left behind.  I LOOOOVE this place.  Don't let the long lines on the week-ends scare you away.  They move quickly and are very organized inside to move people in and out.
"ok SERIOUSLY this place is NOT that great.  HONEY 1 is STILL Hands down the best BBQ joint in the chicagoland area.  There lines here at smoque are horrible, they don't even have a combo of tips and links so they're makin at least $15 a pop per person. (If it was good I wouldn't mind that) They now have they're new texas sausage which is just alright tasted pretty dry. Ribs were ok. Da sauce ok.  Not crazy about there mac and cheese at all. Their fries though are GREAT!I dunno if I could cheat on my Honey 1 again with this place. Didn't do it 4 me. Sorry."
"Now, one may be wondering what a personal trainer is doing at Smoque - right?  I'm also HUMAN!  Plus, the hubby makes some kick-butt ribs so I took him with me to see if we could find a suitable alternative for when he is tired or out of town...So, let me first say, the only thing remotely ""healthy"" on the menu is the coleslaw.  Thank the good Lord they make it with more vinegar than mayo (yuck -mayo?)  I gotta say, all was good.  Had the briquet (sp?) chilli which was fab, didn't dare touch the mac-n-cheese, the corn bread was perfect since it didn't have a ton of corn kernels in it (I hate it when it's like that!!), all the meat seemed to fall of the bone and into the mouth.Now, I didn't LOVE the bbq sauce but I didn't hate it.  I just think that it coulda been better given it's a bbq place.Overall?  Not worth the wait in those hideously long lines we see when we drive by (unless you're getting take out) and they seem to be creating some order out of the chaos of staying in to eat, but it was a very decent meal.Gotta go now...have to get my butt on a treadmill @ 6.9 mph minimum for 45 minutes.  PLUS the gauntlet stairmaster, level 10 for 20 min. PLUS, I will be tired as I have maxed out my caloric intake for at least 2 days...."
"i've had a lot of friends tell me that i have to try this place. specifically, i've had a few rave to me about their chili, because i'm a chili junkie. they went on and on about the brisket chili. so, i decided i'd ride shotgun one day to check it out. first off i have to say that the chili totally underwhelmed me to the point that i thought it was just ok. i had expected so much more from all the raves. that being said, i sampled some of the saint louis style ribs (fantastic), went on to the brisket sandwich (damn good), and had the mac  cheese (just about as good as my wife's and that is saying a lot) and fries (tasty) on the side. is it the best bbq i've had in my life? far from it. though, it is a solid joint  with good bbq. just stay away from the chili and stick to the ribs."
"From where I live Smoque might as well be in Wisconsin.   However, as far as Smoque seems to be from my house in the West Loop, it really doesn't take that long because its right off 90/94 at Lawrence.   Well, that is if there isn't traffic.  Luckily both times we went the highway was wide open.On both of our visits to Smoque we were greeted by a line that made it almost out the door. They do a good job and getting peoples order taken and getting them seated so it's never been an issue.  Plus you gotta think if people are willing stand in line to get some BBQ it either must be really good or the people standing in line must be really stupid.  I don't think they're stupid. I'm a creature of habit and both times I had the pulled pork sandwich platter w/ slaw and two sides.  The pulled pork is very tender and there vinegar based sauce really compliments the pork well.  The fries are solid and the pork & beans are also very good.  Fellow diners have tried the brisket and ribs which were also well received. The decor at Smoque is clean and for once I use clean as negative descriptor.  When it comes to BBQ I feel like the space should be dark, dirty, and loud.  I want to see a country western band playing behind chicken wire getting pelted with Old Style bottles.  I want some old dude telling customers to go to hell when they try tell him how good the BBQ they make at home is.  I want to see a sign that says ""Vegetarians Suck"" (I don't think vegetarians suck, but I want my pit master to think that).  Unfortunately, the service at Smoque is as good as the restaurant is clean.  The staff wears branded Smoque t-shirts and they all just look too damn nice and clean!Despite the spic and span interior, both of my experiences were very good and I will be going back at some point.  However, Smoque definitely lacks something.  I guess I want a ""BBQ Joint"" and Smoque comes off as a ""Barbecue Restaurant"".   I'm afraid to say that Chicago will most likely never be able to compete with Kansas City, Texas, and the Carolinas for the best BBQ joints.  But if you are looking for some good Chicago BBQ Smoque will get you close.1 Pulled Pork Platter w/ slaw and two sides--------------------------------------------------­-----------$10.00"
Very good BBQ and amazing side dishes. I want to bathe in their BBQ sauces. There ...I said it!
"Mmm...Mmmm...MMMM!! It should be illegal for anything to be this darn good! Let's state the facts. 1). I really enjoy BBQ 2). I really enjoy good BBQ 3). I really enjoy Texas Style BBQ 4). Smoque is the best place in Chicago for really amazing Texas style BBQ. I was expecting some fancy joint with pretty good BBQ. Well, that isn't what I got. Smoque is all about the BBQ, it isn't about the décor or being fancy. Smoque is BBQ all the way. I ordered the  1/2 slab of St. Louis Ribs with baked beans and mac & cheese, my boyfriend ordered the sliced brisket French fries and cornbread. Let's start with the ribs, they were perfectly cooked. When I say perfectly cooked, that is exactly what I mean. Perfectly cooked ribs DO NOT fall off the bone. Instead they are tender and easy to bite off the bone. I don't like it when I get a rib and the meat falls off, I also don't want to hurt myself trying to eat tough ribs. Smoque's ribs were perfect. The brisket was equally tasty. Fork tender, plastic fork tender!! What? And the bark is amazing. The Mac & Cheese is fantastic, I wish the portions were bigger, it reminded me of my grandmothers Mac & Cheese (and hers is FANTASTIC), so to compare them is a real compliment. The BBQ baked beans were so good! They don't sell that goodness in a can that is for sure. The Fries were fresh cut and cooked to perfection and the cornbread was also fantastic. Next time I will try the pulled pork and the baby back ribs. Heck I might just order one of everything so I don't miss out! Yup, that good"
"Not sure what else to say that the previous 200+ reviewers have not already said.  I love good BBQ and it is not easy to find good BBQ in the Chicagoland area.  I saw Smoque on Food TV and thought I would stop in to give it a try.While this is not the best BBQ I have ever had, it is some of the best I have found in the Chicagoland area.  I tried a bit of just about everything and thought it was all good quality.  The St. Louis ribs were a bit dry, but tasted good, the pulled pork was good as well and the sliced beef brisket was fantastic and will be my choice next time I stop back in.  Notables are the fantastic sides that are available.  The baked beans, corn break, mac and cheese and peach cobbler are all great.  My only complaint on the sides is that they were rather small so if you really like any of them, you might want to pick up a couple.  One last thing is....be careful where you park.  There is clearly a parking issue for this place as it is located along a residential neighborhood and there are lots of parking restrictions.  There is a lot available behind Smoque bot also be careful there as it only available at certain times.  Lots of signs are posted so just read the signs and follow the directions and you should be fine.Worth the trip......good food at a reasonable price.  From my 1 visit, I suggest the beef brisket, mac and cheese and peach cobbler."
"Best beef brisket I've had. The crust and rub they have for that is second to none, and they really have the technique down. Same with the chicken--such a tangy and tasteful flavor without being salty. Even the white meat is fantastic and just as desirable as the dark meat.I'm not as big of a fan of the pulled pork though, as it fits the reasons why I don't like pulled pork in the first place--rather dry and tasteless, like eating twine rope. Try Honky Tonk in the south side for pulled pork...I've only ever had carryout from here, and during peak meal times I definitely recommend planning ahead and phoning in your order for pickup. They'll take your order up to an hour ahead of your pickup time. The ordering line gets very very long, and seating then becomes even more of a problem."
What can I say that 849 other reviews haven't said already?  Smoque has set the bar for BBQ in Chicago!
"I should start by saying that I'm a bbq enthusiast and smoke my own baby backs, spares, butts, and briskets.  I wanted to try Smoque because of all the raves it's been receiving.  Let's face it, Chicago is not the place for good q, but hopefully that's changing.  I tried everything they had and, for the most part, liked it (and it didn't cost as much as I thought it would).  It's nice that they actually smoke the meat, on the prem, in their big ol' Southern Pride Smoker.Out of everything, the pulled pork was the best.  I found the brisket a bit dry, but pretty good (although no smoke ring).  Overall,  I was a bit disappointed in the lack of smoke flavor in the food.  I also felt that there could be more of a bite to their rubs.  However, the sauce (especially the vinegar-based) made up for that.  The slaw rocked!I would go back, but I have to say (in a completely biased way), that I much prefer the home version of low and slow."
Tasty BBQ.  What's not to love about all of the fixins.  Very relaxed environment with good home cooking.  A little bit of a trek west but will be returning for some BBQ soon.
"I'm usually pretty wary of barbecue served by people as pasty as I am, but Smoque went a long way towards assuaging my doubt.I was greeted by a line out the door, which I bypassed since I ordered ahead for takeout (recommended). The line looked like it was moving quickly; I'd guess people were waiting about 20 minutes to order at 7pm on a Friday, and there were a few tables open for people to sit down. The cafeteria-style seating looked serviceable, but Smoque clearly isn't a destination for its atmosphere.I sampled the pulled pork, links, and brisket. They were out of St. Louis-style ribs. A sign over the register indicated that they had been having quality control issues. The pulled pork was excellent. Not as juicy as I would've liked, but very good nonetheless, with a deep, flavorful bark. The meat was slightly sweet, with a good amount of smoke. Not the best pulled pork I've had in the city, but definitely up there.I usually shy away from BBQ beef in Chicago; we're a pork town. However, the links and brisket were both outstanding. Honestly, the first BBQ beef I've had in Chicago that I would order again.The links had a great snap to the casing, with a spicy, peppery, floral top-note over the sweet beef. Just outstanding quality meat, very juicy. The brisket was the first I've had outside of Austin that I enjoyed. Very, very tender and juicy, with a healthy amount of smoke throughout. Not too fatty, but not nearly as mealy as some of the leaner briskets I've had before. Great bark, as well.The only real let-down was the sauce. A cloying, citrusy mess. Like a mix between OJ concentrate and molasses. The meat was good enough that I enjoyed all of it without sauce, but I was surprised by the sauce. Seemed like they were trying to do something unique instead of just making a quality complement to the meat.Summary: Not my favorite BBQ joint in the city (around 71st Street is still the standard), but definitely one of the better options out there. Outstanding beef options in a pork-obsessed town.Ate my food with a good rauchbier. Smoky goodness."
good ribs when i really want to have it fast. sometimes the meat its dry ... the quality isn't that great.
"While I may not have tried every BBQ place in Chicago, I have tried a lot of them. Smoque is by far my favorite. The only knock is that their success has bred a long line (sometimes). The owners and managers are very friendly; they actually want to hear your views (good and bad). The brisket is to die for, as is the chicken, ribs and sides. I highly recommend it to those who care about their BBQ!"
"My first experience with Smoque involved cold, leftover pulled pork.  Honestly, after that, I was sold. M'lady and I went in on Saturday for lunch to try it hot and fresh...I wish there was a sixth star.  Not only is the food delicious, but you get SO MUCH for your money.For around $20, we got the brisket plate with two sides (the day's special of brisket chili as well as baked beans), the pulled pork plate with two sides (double mac and cheese), two drinks, and a side of cornbread...WITH PIECES OF REAL CORN INSIDE!!! HOLY COWS!!!!!And, if I may say so, I think they're cooking with holy cows because it was allllllllllllllll delicious (and yes, I know pork is not cow...I was just making an animal pun. Woot!)Hooray for Smoque.Oh, um, super friendly staff, too."
"i was dying for some ribs, my boyfriend & i ordered take out and we got the baby back ribs, mac & cheese, smoked beans, cole slaw, and corn bread.the sauce on the ribs was a little too tangy for me, so i mixed the saucewith a bit of sweet baby ray's.. perfect combo!the mac and cheese was good but a little too much bread crumbs ontop for me..the smoked beans were amazing.. the seasoning, the onion, the sauce..the cole slaw was refreshing, not like anything i've ever eaten.. could havehad a little mayo to balance the vinegar taste.the corn bread could have been a little more tastier, sweeter.. boston market cornbread is unbeatable.all in all, good food."
"Best BBQ I've ever eaten!  The Brisket was tender and lean, the pulled pork melted in my mouth, the Texas-style sauce was tangy and thin, the best mac and cheese i've ever eaten as well (covered in buttery breadcrumbs).  There's a bit of a wait now that the place has appeared on several local and national television shows, but its well worth it.  Very Decent prices for BBQ, much less awesome BBQ.  The pulled pork and brisket were each $10 and included coleslaw and two other sides, which amounted to a decent portion of food."
"Pardon me if I don't give in to the hype about this place.  I'll say this: their meat is good.  Yummy pulled pork, chicken, brisket, etc.  And their baked beans are terrific.  But beyond that, there's some downright bad food here.  Like the cringe-inducing, vinegary cole slaw.  Or the corn bread that's sweet when you first bite into it, but follows with a bizarre, chemically after taste.  Even the peach cobbler has something funky going on in it.  And would it kill them to put down a proper floor?  Or clean the restrooms?  Folksy's good, but it's carried too far here.Do this: call in a carry out order and do the baked beans.  Skip the rest.  And if you're waiting for and hour to get a table, you have too much free time."
Heard amazing reviews so we tried it out! Lots of options--REALLY good food! Only one weird thing: the bones in the ribs were actually snapping and breaking apart when trying to eat the ribs. It ended up turning the ribs into a sloppy chunky mess because the bones weren't staying intact. Not sure if its because they cook the ribs so long it weakens the bone--but i've never had this happen before and it made it REALLY hard to eat! Not something that would keep me from coming here but it is curious!
"Much like the strip club, you will drive home from this place smelling your fingers.  Top notch.  Top notch.Had the 1/2 sliced brisket, 1/2 pulled pork sandwich.  Excellent!  Also tried the bbq beans, mac&cheese and st. louis style ribs.  All were wonderful.  Also, if you love the fries from Twisted Spoke then you will love Smoque's.  Virtually identical.  As other reviewers stated, this place is loaded with cops.  So if you're looking to pull an armed robbery you might want to skip Smoque.  Chances are you'll end up on the spit.Went on a Tuesday night around 7:30.  The place was about 90% full with a small line to order.  We got to the order counter quick enough.  After you place your order a host will take your table requirements and promptly seat you at the first available.  Food was up within 10-15 minutes of ordering...damn that was quick.  Smoque is definitely worth the drive.  It's everything I hoped for from (the much closer to me and slightly disappointing) Honey 1 bbq.  It wouldn't surprise me to see Smoque expand or even open another location in a more happening area.  The quality of their food almost demands it.Also, don't forget to BYOB."
Just 2 quick blocks from the Irvington Park train stop which makes walking very possible. Be ready to wait around an hour to get seated but the food is great and well worth the wait. The allow you to take it to go or work to find your party a table to grab a seat. All the food is great. Worth it!
"their ribs and beans are good!  the sauce for some reason is a little bit acidic for my stomach (my girlfriend's stomach also agrees with me on this though)!!they place is always crowded, i recommend you call in and have it to go!"
"Hands down the best BBQ this side of the Mississippi!! My mouth is watering right now just thinkin about it. The ribs just fall off the bone, and the brisket melts in your mouth. Nothing beats that smoky flavor drenched with their home-made vinegar based BBQ sauce. Im gonna have to go get me some ASAP!"
"Love the pulled pork and DH loves the ribs.  SS26 loves the brisket.  FRIES ARE AWESOME as are the mac & cheese & the beans.  Cole slaw is ok; SS26 likes it b/c it's not creamy, but vinegar based.Steve V I hope you try it again b/c it really is good.  I'm sad for your experiences b/c they are really nice there and delicious.  For everyone else, it's picnic style seating so don't be afraid to buddy up."
"How do you get to be thought of as being the best around here? 1) Get a good publicist 2) Buy a top of the line rotisserie smoker 3) Differentiate yourself with very limited mix of regional sauces and BBQ. Hey man, what about the rub man? Well, every credible place by osmosis has some kind of rub. People that BBQ put a lot of love into what they do and I'll say it, pretty much use the same stuff. Going out on a loin, I've never had a dry rub that I didn't like. It really comes down to preference, sweet, hot, salty, mild or some kind of combination. What is your quest or shall I say, Smoque's quest for a distinct rub? Salt-n-Pepa, that wouldn't be interesting enough to market. They are heavy on the pepper and must be laying down more than a ten spot of ingredients. Beyond the Dr., the additional flavors are subtle and become indistinguishable even for the light FM dippity doer. They could reduce the amount of ingredients by half and the majority wouldn't taste the difference and please, don't give me that intentional blending of flavors between the rub and a sauce. Depending on the thickness of the meat, either the pepper or the smoke dominates over the subtleties in seeking the Holy Grail, I mean Smoque's interpretation of the perfect rub. Btw, was that an African or European swallow? The Seuss on sauces, I could find at least a dozen either vinegar, molasses or tomato based bottles in the grocery condiment aisle that you'd be going lady gaga over. They offer two, neither has a real kicker that will score a goal unless you're buying off the yelp ref. Interesting, making such a big deal about the Texas style brisket without any traditional sauce. It is closer to being pastrami than having anything to do with Texas. Remind you, this is an extremely subjective area, others will praise the sauces like some fricken fine bottle of wine. They will elaborate on how extraordinary the ordinary is. Oh, I'm sorry, one from each region, how intercontinental insensitive Sam I am. Anyway, I've labeled them thick and thin as opposed to the formally known as Thing 1 and Thing 2. The thicker adds upon the already peppery rub with its own peppy glow while the thinner doesn't stray far, however mildly masked, from tasting just like vinegar. Ironic, the thicker is hiding the vinegar with pepper and then you taste more vinegar than molasses for the thinner.  Will the real vinegar sauce please stand up? Yep, heavy on the vinegar is more of an acquired taste in this region unless for the few of you that grew up on Russell's and some, not all, will be enlightened on how well it compliments select BBQ. Certainly no HFCS in these babies, good thing since your cholesterol is already shooting off the charts and you wouldn't want to add anything else that is negative. So, you really enjoy going back to places where practically everything on the menu is well over 20% in fat, 50% plus in fanny pack calories. Thumbs up, dirty sticky finger nails and all. Certainly not a fancy highfalutin steak place that has ribs, only possibly pretentious staff and owners behind the counter placing your POS on scrap yard friendly cafeteria trays. Anyway, you can at least sit down wearing your filthy grubs instead of rushing home or gobbling it up in the car. The prices are on par with the take out places, the supposed standard when getting sincere Q. Northsider, well maybe there's one in Evanston that's barely worth avoiding the southern comfort road trip. Don't be suckered into the allure of the take out being more authentic, unless you are more into the soulful Zen of white bread and fries soaking in the sauce routine. Instead of wasting your time and depleting your gas tank, take a load off and taste a couple of Popeye sized sides with your smoked protein. BYOB, maybe you might prefer that 40 oz. bottle without the brown paper bag you've grown accustomed to. I can't object to anything that they serve. Yet, nothing that I've eaten at this place has ever wowed me. A little something of this or that in the rub or sauce is not going to give me a woody. The meat and the right amount of fat from that meat put into the smoker makes it all happen, everything else is just icing on the cake. I'd tell you straight out if the BBQ is off or bad, not here. Give a lot and I mean a lot of credit to the commercial smoker, the real secret in providing practically effortless and consistent smoked flavor that is not dried out. Imagine the possibilities if every Jewel or Dominick's had a Southern Pride. Alright, the ribs are a tad on the skinny side and I can live without their sauce. As for the pulled stuff, it demands whatever sauce that is laying around to add flavor, contrast and moisture. Brisket, bring on the heat. A hodgepodge crossbreed of this and that for such a small menu, don't get me started. W-H-A-T, a mishpocha proprietor dishing out some top notch goyish BBQ. I was wondering why they had such an affinity with the brisket."
"I love the casual atmosphere, communal seating, and great food at Smoque.  This is really a community place that attracts people from all over.  The BBQ is solid, and corn bread DELICIOUS.If you're a BBQ junkie, this is a must-try on your list."
"Awesome BBQ!  I have only been for takeout, but while picking up the place seemed nice.  Call ahead as the waits are ridiculous."
"WHAT HAPPENED ??!!! you know.. I think when Time Out Chicago had one of Smoques Mouth Watering Briskett Sandwhiches on their front page, maybe then Smoque was pulling out all of the stops.. after they got the exposure, they have gone down hill. Now I'm from KC.. the BBQ Place and although I didn't expect it to be Gates or some other place, I wanted this to be decent. The beef sandwhich was OK but everytime i took a bite, there was a huge clump of soggy FAT on it. Like they  forgot to Trim the FAT before they began to cook the meat. I know that they can't reach all of it but DAYUM!!! .. Their beans were just ok. and their fries were just ok as well. nothing to scream about and certainly not worth me paying $24 for 2 kids meals and an adult meal.. ohh and what GALLS do they have making sure that there is a TIP Jar by the Cashier.. WHAT are we Tipping for again ?"
"My hubby saw this joint on Guy Fieri's show on Food Network and told me we were going - oh joy. I only eat red meat every couple of months so I guess this will be a red meat meal! So, we went last Thurs around 1:30 thinking we could beat the ""lunch rush"" - ha, nope, we were wrong - we got the last available table! I had the half sliced brisket plate with coleslaw and baked beans - everyting was seriously great! The brisket wasn't doused with BBQ it was just enough to flavor it and not drip down your arm like some places. Hubbie had brisket platter with fries and beans and added on ribs. He loved the brisket but, is still raving about the ribs - he will be geting just ribs next time we go!Smoque had a line out the door by the time we were done with our lunch! Call ahead or go at non-meal times. Smoque is worth the trip!"
This is the best BBQ in Chicago! If you have a problem with this meet me at the corner of State and Madison any day at high noon where I will promptly bitch slap you.
"I love the beef brisket, too bad I only got to have 4 bites!  Greedy Boys!!  Four friends  got together for wine and BBQ on Friday-The boys picked up the food. It was a Friday after all, and that means some time to mellow, chill, and enjoy laughter with friends. After splitting a few bottles of wine, i was not feeling too hungry yet, I still needed some liquid hydration both with and without alcohol.  BAD CHOICE!! I should have eaten the second it arrived!!  By the time I got done indulging, and got around to eating, my portion was gone!!!   I do not mind sharing my food, especially when I am drinking.  But, for Christs sake! don't eat it all!!!!  For 4 of us, we had pulled pork, baby back ribs, st. louis style ribs and brisket. Sounds like it should be enough food, but not for my friends!! I only wanted brisket, and maybe a bite of corn bread to soak up some of the alcohol....  Good thing I did not want to try everything, it would not have been possible!  But, everyone smiled when accused of being pigs , and then raved about how great it was!"
"Over the course of this past weekend, I've been there twice already.  Its only Tuesday night and I'm thinking I should stop by before the weekend hits.  Due to always just seeing the restaurant in passing, I always thought it was a traditional sit down.  Its not!  Its just a joint.  Where can you find an awesome pulled pork sandwich for only $7.95.  You can also do a brisket, sliced or chopped.  OR try their 1/2 & 1/2, any two, how kick ass is that.  I've had both the St. Louis ribs and the Baby backs.  Can't decide...  you have to see which cut of meat you love best.  Get this.. you can add a side of say.. 1/4 portion of St. Louis ribs.. or a portion of brisket  or pulled pork for just $3 bucks.  Now onto the sides.  Baked macaroni and cheese is DAMN good.  its baked!.. its got this crunchy coating on top.. and oh so moist.  You can't share a side of it.  You have to have your own.  It sucks that their ""large"" order is just two smalls.  Whoopdedoo.Cole slaw is just alright.  Its topped with a bit of red onion.  Their fries are fuckin awesome.  And whats kick ass is that they reheat very well.  The beans are also yum.  Sweet with a bit of its own tang.Their sauce is smokey.  For those of you that don't particularly take to smokey.. let me say.. I agree with you.  I don't usually go for that flavor. This sauce however.. is smokey and a little spicy.  Its got a lil' kick on it, you may grow to love.I wish they would offer a homemade lemonade..  I think that would seal the deal on this great eat.BYOB."
"Me and a friend of mine went there last Saturday night night after hearing about the joint in a couple of papers and online. We drove up to the place and we could tell by the fine smells in the parking lot that it was going to be good. The line was out the door but moved surprisingly fast. We didn't realize until we got halfway through the line that it was BYOB, but luckily some nice dudes in front of us had an extra cold, six-pack of fat tires in their car they gave us.... i was sad to say they were out of most everything-- pork, st. louis ribs, and others-- they were kind enough to let us know before we got in line, but we stayed anyways. I got the chopped brisket platter and my buddy got the full slab of baby back ribs. the food comes to you on unpretentious trays and everything is nice and tidily packaged up for you. that is, until you eat. for me, my typical method of attack is to save the main entree for last and hover around the sides for a bit to warm things up. I got baked beans, mac n cheese and cole slaw... and it was good! baked beans probably some of the best I've had... they were sweet and tangy with huge chunks of meat and a great texture. I could have had a tub of those and been satisfied.  the mac was pretty decent and the cole slaw was exactly the way it should be: fresh ingredients with a nice vinegary kick. on to the meat: my brisket was good. I wouldn't say amazing. It had a really good smoked flavor, even without the sauce. The meat was cooked well... but the sauce really added to the flavor. I believe they had a north carolina sauce for the brisket which had a great balance of sweetness but wasn't too tart, and didn't overwhelm the flavor of the brisket. I'd say for me it was more than above average for sure, but no grand slam however.but my buddy's baby back ribs and sauce: muy rico!!!! the lady said they used a Memphis-style sauce that had just a hint of spices that really hit spot and the meat was fantastic. I like the fact that the ribs had simultaneously a slight crispy outside and fall-off-the-bone quality  inside. it was wonderful, even without the sauce.we feasted quite heartily and after knocking down a few beers left Smoque completely satisfied and hopefully I'll be back for a second visit sometime soon.a word on the service: it was really busy and since you order, get a number and wait for it to get called to go up to the counter to get your food, it had the potential to get really crazy and disorganized. But the few fellas that were helping guide traffic not only did a good job, but they were really friendly and genuinely wanted to make ur dining experience better. one of the guys got a bottle opener for our beers and opened the bottles himself... even though we would have done it ourselves.anyways, I'm not prepared to say just yet that smoque lives up to the hype, but so far so good. Its definitely worth checking out!"
This is Barbeque perfection!!!  I stopped by here because I was in Chicago and it had been featured on Food Network.  I hopped on the L  and rode out.  Well worth the the 15 min ride from downtown.   The brisket was fork tender & moist.  The ribs melted in your mouth.  I was also impressed with the sides.  The Baked beans have real chunks of brisket in them.   The fries are crisp and hot and served in paper bag.  Also the price is right I got out for under $20 bucks and I won't have to eat for the rest of the day.  REVISED:I went back a week later.  Had the pulled pork and St. Louis Ribs.  They let me down compared to the Brisket and the baby back ribs.  So I knocked off a star to 4 instead of 5My one complaint is that the place isn't very green friendly.  I ordered in and yet my food was all in to go containers except the meat.  They should work on this!
"Say yes to pulled pork! They also have this combo where you can get half brisket half something else, and it's delicious! It was a ton of food, but I took it home and enjoyed my leftovers for days!The line was a bit long, but totally worth the wait!"
"Well I finally went to see what all the hype was and just like I expected, it was hype. The food is very good here for sure, I wasn't disappointed at all with anything they serve, but to claim to be the best is such an exaggeration. The ribs were not as ""smoked"" as could be,it tasted burnt and there was minimal meat on my slab. Without that sauce not much to mouth water on. I read reviews on all the amazing sides that come with the ribs but isn't it about the ribs? Chicago sucks when it comes to ribs so when a place pops up claiming best ribs everyone flocks there like wolves. Look around and see that other places do taste better, try moving to a southern state."
"This is probably the best BBQ I've had in the city. The meats are tender, the sauce is great, and the selection is amazing (even sidedishes). The only downside is how little seating there is, but you can just take yours to go. If I didn't live so far away, I would frequent Smoque more often. I would recommend trying their combinations to experience their various meats."
"This is some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Service was acceptable, food was ready promptly and taste was amazing. We had brisket- soooo tender, baby back ribs- fall-off-the-bone good and charred just right, pulled pork- good but not as amazing as the other two meats, Mac & cheese- perfect!, beans- flavorful and smoky good, fries-1 order is enough for 2 people and cornbread- very good. Cole slaw is served with everything and it was just okay (it's more of a vinegar based and we prefer creamy type). You cannot go wrong at this place!"
"this is the place if you're in a mood for good ol southern ribs, smoked for a looong time in some pitbit of a way from downtown, but it's worth the tripps: ohh yeah, i never actually ate in the restaurant, only take out"
"Delicious!Every single thing i have tried, i have loved. So far i have had both kinds of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich. I am not someone who just craves a  BBQ joint, but i do crave Smoque. The sides are also awesome. My personal favorites are the Cobbler and the Mac & Cheese bake. Famous Dave even gives their BBQ sauce a thumbs up!"
"I went to Kansas City on business last year and the one thing I took away from this city is my deep affection for KC barbecue. I had it both days that I was there, and I dreamt about it for months after. My gosh, I crave that barbecue like a crazy person. The delicious smoked flavor of the meat has lingered with me and refuses to let go. So I've bitten my nails, chewed gum, chugged water, and have pretty much done anything to stop myself from jumping on a plane just to have dinner there.Last night, though, I felt like I had returned to the Kansas City mothership when I ordered carry-out from Smoque. The sliced brisket is truly amazing, and both types of ribs are great. It really is smoked BBQ heaven. Also, the mac and cheese (piping hot) rocks and the peach cobbler is the perfect perfect way to finish off the meal.I'd have given Smoque 5 stars-- but I took off a star since I didn't find the restaurant, as a whole, to be perfect (though the food may very well be)."
"The food was great. I had the 1/2 chicken platter and it was some of the best bbq chicken I've had in Chicago. Super fast service and ample seating. I do have two complaints though which held back a 5-star rating. They lost one star for being out of pulled-pork by the time I went to eat dinner (around 8:45pm on a Friday). This is understandable as pulled-pork is delicious and in high demand, but they should really plan to have more cooked on a busy Friday night so they don't run out. They lost another star because of the price. The place is run like an upscale Boston Market, where you place your order, hang out for a while until your order number is called before you go get your tray of food and a couple of plastic utensils. I have no problem for this if I'm dropping $7 at a fast food restaurant, but if it's a BYOB self-serve joint I shouldn't have to pay $15+ for a meal. For these prices they should really have wait service and some real knives and forks."
"The greatest BBQ in all the land.  Also, great service.  I like how they seat you where it works out the best for all patrons.  It gets around one of my all-time pet peeves - people who 'save' seat s while their friends are in line for food.  People!  In the time that it takes your friend to order and get food, an entire other party could have eaten at the table you're saving.  You're messing up the flow!  The folks at Smoque seem to have figured this out - kudos to them!  Try the St. Louis ribs - they're like no others, and you don't even need to add BBQ sauce."
"I just can't love this place. I've tried. I  was here the first week they opened I wanted to love this place so much. I thought maybe it was due to newness but now it has been long enough that  I'm finally certain that Smoque just doesn't do it for me the way Fat Willy's or Honky Tonk BBQ does. To be fair, I've never had the brisket, and from reading reviews maybe that's my problem. The ribs I've had have been just ok and all of the sides I've tried here were nothing to remember. At this point I just don't see myself coming back. I'm not a fan of the layout of this place, it's kind of uncomfortable and that wouldn't bother me if the food was good enough to distract me from it but it hasn't been"
Best BBQ I've had outside of Texas.  I want to go there now just writing about it.  There's no excuse to eat anywhere else.    Love love love their brisket and the mac & cheese.
Great BBQ in Chicago!
"5 stars for the food, 4 for the atmosphere,had the brisket sandwichsauce could have been spicier but thats my complaint at most rib places.Very good peach cobbler. Give yourself a little time to park."
"Smoque BBQ is a good place for BBQ.  I've tried the St. Louis style ribs, baby-back ribs, pulled pork sandwich, and sliced brisket sandwich.  Of those, the sliced brisket sandwich is the one I favor as it is soft, moist, and has a nice smokey taste.  Ribs are so-so, sides are okay, nothing to be desired, which they serve little stingy amounts in these small foil containers...must be a cost cutting strategy.  Cole slaw has a vinegar based dressing which I don't care for.  BBQ sauce is eh, okay as well.  Definitely try their sliced brisket sandwich...a must!Overall, okay prices, okay service, okay food."
"This place serves some awesome BBQ.  I ordered the chopped brisket sandwich with baked beans, which was really excellent.  I remember leaving the place already planning my next trip.The reason Smoque doesn't get 5 stars:1. It is always really busy.2. They frequently run out of everything.We tried to go there on Saturday at 7pm and saw a sign on the door that said ""Sorry we are out of everything"".  Thinking this was a joke we went in to find out they only had sides left and a rack of ribs....guess everything should not be taken literally.  We left disappointed and tried again on Sunday.  We got there at 1pm, 2 hours after they opened, and the line was out the door and they were already out of pulled pork and St. Louis style ribs.  After waiting in line and finishing our meal we walked out the door to see them put up another...""Sorry we are out of everything sign"".  Keep in mind this was 3 hours after they opened!!!"
"This place may be the best BBQ in the city.  I've tried most nearly everything on their menu and my 2 favorites are their sliced beef brisket and pulled pork.  Both are very tender and flavorful.  What really makes this place though is their side dishes.  You can pick from BBQ beans, Mac N Cheese, Peach Cobbler, French Fries and now Beef Brisket Chili.  The fries are awesome, and you get a ton of them.  The Mac N Cheese and Brisket Chili are really good as well.  When ordering a platter you get a choice of two, and I usually go with the fries and cobbler so I get something sweet to finish off the meal with.Overall Smoque is a filling and fair priced meal.  Their BBQ sauce is very good, and you everything here really is homemade.  Its a very informal setting and the only small issue is that the place can get VERY crowded around peak meal times, but that's usually the case with any good food establishment.  They don't have a ton of parking, but it's not hard to find a decent spot around the restaurant."
Delicious BBQ. The beef brisket is so tender although I wish it had some more flavor. The mac and cheese is to die for. I love the crust on top. Have been there twice so far and is definitely coming back.
"It's been at least 7 weeks or so since the husband and I have had our favorite BBQ in Austin.  That's a really long time for us and while making dinner at home and watching DDD, we saved what we were making and headed over there.Unlike TX BBQ places, this one has baked beans, mac' n cheese, french fries, cornbread AND peach cobbler.  A place that finally has sides I like, hooray!I ordered the chicken, mac' n cheese, french fries and a corbread muffin.  Holy lord it was amazing.  The rub on the chicken paired with the sauce was perfect and tender.  The mac was a great flavor.  A huge bag of hand-cut french fries were awesome.  And, then the cornbread muffin, mmmmmmmmm, my god.The husband had their brisket and was loving every minute.  He cleaned his plate, and mine. All this for only $25 in the city of Chicago, hell yeah, we're all up in that!  Thank god it's not within walking distance of us, we'd be gaining in no time!We both agree it's better than anything we had while living in Texas.  One of my best meals yet in the city."
Someone buy me Smoque! So far I've been generally dissatisfied with chicago barbecue and it would be nice to be proven otherwise.
"YUMMMYYY!!!!!! Smoque is my new favorite place. I can't believe it took me so long to eat here. I always heard there was long lines to get in, so we decided to stop by around 3pm on Sunday and try our luck. There was only a few people in line, but all tables were full. Took us about 3 minutes to get a table, and I was glad we came when we did. Almost immediately after being seated the placed got packed and the line was to the door. It stayed that way until we left. The brisket is fantastic- tender smokey goodness. The sausage was also pretty damn good. The platter seams to be the better deal, as they come with 2 sides, and the sandwiches I saw looked a little puny. The got the brisket platter with mac n cheese and french fries. I have to say these are the best fries I have had in years, and they give you ALOT of them.... The mac was absolutely delicious!!!!!!! The coleslaw was not to bad, but nothing spectacular. God I love this place..."
"You all should be jealous, I work a block away from Smoque and get to smell the wonderful aroma as it drifts through the neighborhood.  Now, I am not a bbq expert, but this food is consistently top notch.  The fact that there are lines is a testament to the fact that the Exec. Chef. knows what he is doing.  Add to that on many occasions he is walking around the dining room chatting with the customers.  As for those lines, I am not sure what these people do but they have a system that works.  The lines move fast and they are excellent at getting you seated right as your food is ready.  The food is simply amazing.  I have had just about everything on the menu and it always tastes amazing and fresh!  It is no surprise that this place has gained national acclaim considering the quality of the food.  The pulled pork is delish as well as the ribs and brisket.  Do yourself a favor, head to this out of the way establishment, wait in line, and then have a food-gasm as you enjoy your meal!"
"Amazing food. Terrible wait in line.It's a shame Smoque BBQ isn't bigger. The whole line process almost takes away from how good their food is. What was going to be a quick lunch turned into a 2-hour adventure. Also, dress warm because the line leaves you waiting outside.I ordered the chopped brisket sandwich with mac and cheese. The sandwich is filling as well as incredibly tasty. I was really hungry and my watch read 4:20 but it was very high quality meat. The mac and cheese is even better. I want to fill up a tub with their mac and cheese and bathe in it.The girl who works behind the counter is attractive, although I think she might be under 18. Chris Hanson better not see this."
"It's a little pricey, but I've never tasted brisket as good as they make here.  The Texas sausage is incredible as is the peach cobbler.  This is one of my favorite places for lunch.  I come here at least once a month.  My challenge is to branch out and try some of the other specialties - the chicken looks really good as does the pulled pork.  Maybe someday..."
"If it was up to me Barbecue would be a part of the food pyramid or food groups. Because while it isn't vital for your body to have, it brings a great deal of joy. Because nothing is tastier than smoked meat falling apart due to the breaking down of connective tissue. I dare you to think of something, and guess what you can't. That's why America won the Cold War.And Smoque can give me those tasty smoked meats. Their St. Louis ribs and pulled pork are what stands out here. Sometimes there ribs are tough and shitty, but that's only happened once. The brisket, chicken, baby back ribs, and sides are all delicious as well. They just don't shine like the pulled pork does. If you get a take out order I would suggest asking for extra barbecue sauce, just because it's always good to have extra.Out of all the barbecue places that I've ate at in Chicago I would say that Smoque has the most consistent quality of smoked meats. And they have the best balance of delicious sauce and delicious meat. The only time they've let me down with the very tough St. Louis ribs. But that only happened once, so it's not a huge concern."
"Pulled pork is good, brisket tasty and the mac & cheese is delic! But sadly the ribs just aren't there.  And what's we all these posts about st. louis ribs?  You're in the midwest folks, especially eatting at a northwest side spot - get over it.  They are far better rib places out there, but this is a good place on a weekend day to grab a sandwich and a side for under ten bucks."
"Okay this is yelp review number 667, but I still wanted to say I love this place.  Today was my third trip and the ribs were great.   The only recommendation I have for the owner is to instruct his employees not throw the ribs down on plates, the ribs are tender enough without their help."
"When I came here on a Sunday, the front door malfunctioned and managed to lock me out! The place obviously wasn't closed, but no one was interested in coming to the door.Luckily, I had YELP in my phone and was able to call the owner to have him let me in. I guess the 50 or so people inside were too busy slamming down ribs, brisket, and pulled pork to notice me at the door.I can understand why. Friendly people and great food awaits inside."
"oh em gee.can we say carnivore heaven??.. the brisket,,, the ribs... omg this made me loveeeeee non-babyback ribs... and then the pulled pork... the peach cobbler... OMGOMGOMGOGOMG, I can't even write a normal review about this, it's just delicious, plain delicious.... and so cheap for so much food.... I'm even a fan of their coleslaw (I never eat coleslaw, but I ate theirs... I hate mayo so I was so happy it was sans mayo)Did I mention the peach cobbler? LOVE.The cornbread is delicious...BUT WAIT, did I MENTION the PEACH COBBLER?!?!?!.. they just need to add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to take it beyond perfection!!!"
best bbq in the city when it comes to ribs and brisket.  no contest.
best bbq brisket around.
Man I had to go to Chicago to find the best BBQ!  I ordered a little of everything and it was smoking!  I did not mind the line.  I would definitely go back.
"I know that I'm not an expert on BBQ, but I think I know a good rack of ribs when I taste one.  I ordered the baby back ribs, the beans, fries, and a side of the pulled pork.  The ribs were slightly overdone on one side, and were not easy to pull apart...I don't know if this is supposed to be good or bad.  However when I bit into a few of the overdone side ribs, the meat was tough, chewy, and had a chalky taste.  I'm going to give this place another try, but mark one down for the ribs.  The pulled pork was delicious...so a thumbs up on that!!!The sides were so-so.  I guess I don't like vinegar in my beans.  Maybe that is a traditional thing that got watered down here in the midwest...but I don't like the vinegar taste in the beans.  Sorry...another thumbs down on this place for that.  Fries...thumbs up.So I'm stuck on a three star rating.  I always try to hit up a place at least twice before making a review...so I'll update this once I go back here."
"mmmm mmmmm mmmmmmm.  Expect a line when you come to eat at Smoque, but it goes fast and it is worth it!"
"Smoque is a great neighborhood BBQ joint. It has some very nice smoked food and a BYOB policy so you can leave without spending much at all. I would recommend the ribs and sausages. They are very nice. My wife really enjoyed their mac and cheese as well. Overall, this is a nice neighborhood joint and if you don't have access to your own BBQ grill or smoker a nice place to go."
Stop reading reviews and go eat at Smoque. Now!
"FINALLY...I made it to Smoque. I've been trying to get here for months! Well folks, it was worth the wait and I've got the heartburn to prove it.Now, being my first visit, I only tried a couple things. I ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich with pulled pork and sliced brisket (in case you're wondering, it's a whole sandwich bun sliced in half; each half contains your choice of meat). I chose the fries as my side item and, might I add, they were some of the best hand-cut fries I've eaten. And no, I'm not exaggerating. The pulled pork ROCKED! It was very lean and flavorful and had a nice crust. The brisket was really good, but just a tad fatty for my taste. Sauce was tangy and a bit on the thin side (not a criticism, just a fact). I happen to love the 'slaw here. It's not the traditional creamy version, but has more of a vinaigrette dressing. I'm already planning my next visit, once this awful heartburn subsides...it's not because of the food being too something...except fricken' delicious which caused me to scarf it down way too fast thereby producing this painful side effect. Chew slowly please, if you can :)"
"So, after having Fat Willy's and Calvin's, a friend recommended Smoque as a great BBQ spot that's still young enough to put the needed care into their food to produce a great meal.  Smoque was definitely one of the better BBQ joints I've been to in a while and I'll be heading back, as long as they don't run out of food.As someone else said, call ahead.  The conversation usually goes like this:Caller: I'm going to be there in about an hour - what do you think you'll have left?Smoque Employee: Well, we're running a little low on _____, but we should be fine with everything else.I had the pulled pork with fries and cornbread and I split the St Louis ribs taste with my girlfriend.  I think we could have split the pork platter as well and just bought an extra bun.  The pulled pork wasn't very warm and a little more fatty than I would have liked - I think they might have been scraping the bottom of the barrel.  The ribs were fantastic and I would love to try a half slab of each next time.  The sides were all great, especially the Jiffy cornbread that reminded me of eating BBQ chicken at my grandparent's.  My girlfriend picked up the mac and cheese and loved it.  I really wanted to try the peach cobbler but I probably would have exploded.So next time, I think we'll split a platter, buy 2 buns, maybe a taste of the brisket, and hopefully we'll have room for some cobbler."
"When a restaurant has 202 reviews, is it even worth reviewing?  I worked from home yesterday and decided to take a field trip over to Smoque with my manfriend.  I made a huge mistake by not taking the expressway.  We drove through God's country to get there...45 minutes later we finally arrived.  The wonderful aroma of, well, smoke, hit me as we walked in the door.  I went with the pulled pork, and B had the St. Louis ribs.  Both of us had mac and cheese on the side and B also got fries.  Everything was delicious, but the real winners were the pulled pork and the mac and cheese.The pork was incredible.  So soft, but with some crunch, almost caramelized bits.  I loved every second of it. I had to take one star off for the inconvenient location, although I do have to say that it only took 10 minutes to get home.  I guess I should have taken the expressway both ways."
"THIS is more my favorite BBQ in the world, so far. I really love theribs. In fact I was almost regretting I got the brisquit instead ofthe ribs after I had one of my boyfriends. They give you different BBQdipping sauces to try out which are all pretty good (some are betterthan others but it all depends on your tastes). I love the taste ofeverything though. We got a little bit of pulled pork, which waswayyyyyyyyyyy amazing. I wish I had gotten that on a sandwich. Theonly ultra crazy thing about all the food is that it's smokey. And I'mtalking ULTRA smokey, to the point there's almost too much smoke init. But that's also what makes it amazing. Their mac n cheese btw?AWESOME! I wish they had bigger portions."
"I stopped by for the first time on Friday. I tried the St. Louis ribs and the sliced brisket. I thought both were good but I didn't like the sauce on the brisket as much as the one on the ribs. Both needed a little more sweetness, somehow.. I know I must sound crazy to the loyal customers. I thought the fries were delicious but I wasn't into the mac and cheese so much. The cheese was good.. I didn't like the crumbs on top. Even though it wasn't spectacular, it was definitely the best stuff I've had in the city, in regards to BBQ. I returned on Saturday only to find an extremely long line outside the door. For this reason, I walked away. It was snowing, it was cold and I wasn't about to get sick for a sandwich. I hope they can one day accomodate the demand as they were also out of brisket (another reason I didn't wait in line)."
"Well, we had a serious craving for BBQ so we checked in with all of you fine people. Smoque delivered the goods with gusto! I'm pretty picky about BBQ (OK not that picky) and Smoque treats their ingredients right! We tried: Baby Back Ribs (very good), Pulled Pork (very good), Fresh Cut Fries (Great), Mac & Cheese (just ok) and BBQ Beans (GREAT!).We brought a bottle of Bonny Doons which was great (even in a paper cup!) until we got our food. I don't know what we were thinking but next time we'll have a couple of Blue Moons;)For a place that doesn't have servers, we got a lot of positive attention while we were eating. Smoque knows what they're doing and if my second trip is as good as the first I'll add a star to my rating."
"Love me some Southern Style hilbilly food, the tips here are a lot of work as all places that even sell them, but let me tell you if you never had tips you're missing out on the best cut of meat, it's a lot of work but so tender, the BBQ sauce was good as well, no full of sugar and had some kick, this is fun food that always makes it in our rib rotation, Smoque bbq has it down pretty good, can't wait to go back."
"Brisket = so good.  I want to try everything but I don't know if I can get something else now!  I've never had brisket so tender, and the BBQ sauce on the side is incredible.  Need to get extra next time.  The portions and price are also fantastic.  As far as the sides, the mac n cheese which people seem to be raving about here is worth all the attention.  I also had cornbread and cole slaw, neither of which really blew me away, but it was certainly still an excellent meal."
"We don't love BBQ in our house, but when we're in the mood, this is the only place we'll go. The place is a bit disorganized, but it contributes to the very casual atmosphere. Wish they had a dedicated take-out lane for newcomers (you can just cut to the front, which not everyone is comfortable with), but it's hard to do everything with so little space. Overall, Smoque is a must in NW Chicago!"
"This is the best BBQ shop in Chicago. The pulled pork sandwich is perfectly delicious. The sauce is so good I get a quart to take home every time I go. The mac and cheese and cornbread are amazing additions to an already incredible sandwich. The sliced brisket is also a standard at this eatery; you must at least try it. When you go always be sure to ""add a taste"" of whatever you didn't order as your main meal--you won't be sorry!"
"Ok, simply delicious! I have actually went there twice in the same weekend I discovered it cause its that good. I'm actually craving it right now as I am typing this review. Just when I thought I got it out of my head! GO AND GET SOME!"
"I really tried to love this place but you can't have a bbq place and serve sweet tea from a soda fountain.  The ribs were pretty tasty, but the chicken came out dry.  The service was nice and prices were resonable."
"at smoque the menu is simple, so its easy to try all the things offered. the baby back ribs and brisket is our usual choice (platters of course), the meat is tender and juicy, but the bbq sauce is super vinegary for my taste. i would prefer if it was sweeter..  the half chicken looks juicy, the texas sausage is a bit boring compared to the other meats. as for sides: if i had my way the mac and cheese would be 3x as big, because its just that good, the sauce is creamy and the crispy crust.. oh yea. the baked beans are sweet with great chunks of tender pork, the corn bread is a nice side for the meats..cole slaw comes with all the platters, the dressing is light and acidic and has a nice crunch, but i hate the celery seeds (! personal issue). the fries have their moments, some stronger than others.. but i feel a bit too greasy after eating all the meat and fries. peach cobbler is a nice way to finish it all off, but really i just want more mac and cheese :)"
"Let me begin my review by lambasting that fat ass Food Network host Guy Fieri.  That guy sucks (seriously, who gives their own show a nickname?), and his show is disgusting, I hope its short lived.  With that said, kudos for Smoque being highlighted on ""Triple D"" (....and now I hate myself for just using that nickname).To date, I have not had anything but great experiences at Smoque.  The brisket is excellent, as is the pulled pork, and they don't put up a stink or charge you extra if you ask for extra sauce.  Sides are equally excellent, the beans are hearty, the fries crispy, and the coleslaw is defiantly simple, almost to the point of being an afterthought (although that doesn't mean it isn't tasty).  I find it remarkable that the service doesn't collapse during the dinner rush, if I had to guess I would attribute that composure to the leadership of the owner who you will typically find standing guard sporting some nifty Zuba-esque chef pants, and ushering patrons to tables.  The small dining room, BYOB, and counter service seems to be a disaster waiting to happen, but even with the line out the door, we have typically been seated at a table with our food within 15 minutes of arrival. Now that is now you do BBQ, Chicago!"
This is the best BBQ joint I have come across north of 35th Street.  The St. Louis Ribs have an excellent dry rub that blend a number of spices well.  The brisket is awesome with the right amount of moisture and flavor.  I haven't had a chance to try the other selections but  I have made it my personal mission to try every menu item at least once.  The sides are well prepared and compliment the meat.  The only downside is that during lunch or dinner seating can be difficult.
"Looooove the way the meat comes right off the bone, also appreciate that it's a BYOB!"
"As good as it gets north of the Mason-Dixon line.  The pulled pork and brisket are fabulous.  Their sides leave a little to be desired; their cornbread is nothing to write home about.  The BBQ meats, however, are delicious."
"I will not go anywhere else for pulled pork! This place a a distance for me, but I will make the drive! Cute place with straight-forward chalk board menu! Friendly staff, and damn good BBQ!I ordered 8 pounds for a party and everyone raved!Go get some ""smoque"" now!!!"
"We love this place!  The Brisket is the best!!!  We travel all around the world and love to eat.  It's crazy to say, but Chicago has the best BBQ place around.The only complaints:ParkingLines"
"Smoque is happiness. Every time my boyfriend and I decide to travel north to have BBQ at Smoque, I can't help but feel excitement. I've had the BBQ chicken and the baby back ribs-both are wonderful. The chicken is surprisingly very moist. My boyfriend always gets the half and half sandwich, with pulled pork and sliced brisket. He ususally scarfs the whole thing down before I can get a bite. Although the meat is delicious, the sides are where it is at. The BBQ beans change lives! Seriously! I know that they have changed mine on several occasions. Even the fries are incredible. Yum!"
Still great fooooood!!!!!
"I drive a good distance to just come get this BBQ. Not big on their ribs but love everything else. I'm more of a portillos fall off the bone guy than the chew off style they do. Love all the sides. Peach cobbler, mac cheese, and beans :)"
"Well I first saw this place on DDD, then met the very nice owner Barry at the NRA Show and my wife and I went that night...NOT a let down in ANY way. It is SO hard to find good BBQ outside of my backyard...(I just don't have the money fo rmy own building) His spices are his deal, and I love that. I use Birch Beer in my sauce, he uses Coke, his beans are THE BEST in the business. The ONLY small problem is the size of his dining room, and I think his ribs are a little flat compared to what I like. So trying to review BBQ for me is hard, cause I like mine so much. I won't review any others except a local over rated establishment in Michigan. Barry does it SO right, cobbler is the best surprise and the Mac n Chee is a model all should try to replicate!"
"We went to Chicago for the weekend and was hoping to try some good food. All weekend time after time we were disappointed. We were actually going to Hot Doug""s but they were closed and ended up at Smoque's which was a pleasant surprise. We came right before the rush. The staff was very professional. It was our first time there and they clearly answered all our questions about the menu. The plate sizes are very generous. Everything tasted great. We had leftovers which we ate 4 hours later cold at the airport and it was still good. The only complaint: they should give different flavor of bbq sauce."
"Look the BBQ is pretty average but  better than most if you are in Chicago.  Nobody here seems capable of good sauce or smoky meat texture.  This was pretty decent but a little fatty in most cuts, brisket should not be so moist, its like a sponge but tastes ok.  The sauce is woefully lacking with the sweetness of candy.  But on the plus side the fries are  really really good.  But above all the Peach cobbler IS THE TRUTH,  it is insanely good, crunchy with a good glaze on the outside with perfect solid peach baked in to perfection.  I would pay 12 bucks for that thing, 2 dollars is the deal of the century.  I cannot overstate how amazing it is.The staff is also very friendly and the restaurant itself is very comfortable. A good stop if your in the mood for BBQ."
"Best far the class of BBQ in Chicago.  I haven't seen anybody else come close to getting the Carolina sauce this delicious.Tips:- Get the brisket sandwich.  There is a reason all the magazines fawn over it.  - Corn bread is pretty spectacular.- Get there right as they open to avoid the line and crowded dining room.- The Texas Sausage has that perfect snap to it.- If you are with somebody else, you might try splitting an order of fries.  They are abundant.  And nobody really needs that much sodium."
"Was looking forward to trying out this place.  Parking was very easy and accessible off the street.  We ordered our food ahead of time after hearing that it gets quite crowded.  Our food was ready upon arrival but we were not allowed to sit down at a table because other people were waiting even though we had already ordered our food.  There really isn't a lot of seating.  They are a BYOB which is a plus if you can get a seat.  We took our food to a park nearby and sat outside.  I had the ribs, Saint Louis style.  They were okay but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce.  I do not think that we will return to this restaurant but I would recommend it if you're in the neighborhood/want to try new BBQ."
"By far not the best ribs I've had, but some of the best I've had on the northside of Chicago.They have both ""St. Louis Style"" and baby back ribs. I really like that you can order 1/2 slab of each as part of a meal (or you can order 1/2 or whole slab ala carte).  I ordered 1/2 of each.  The babyback ribs were a little drier than I sometimes like, but still good.  I much preferred them over the St. Louis style ribs, but honestly I think I just kind of got a bad cut.  At least 2 of the ribs were just covered in solid gelatenous fat, which was kind of nasty.  The other half wasn't like that at all.  (we had ordered it to go, I might've taken them back up to the counter had I been there).  I like that the ribs are mostly just dry rub and they provide you the sauce on the side.  I sometimes hate places that douse them with sauce (though I can think of some places that do it this way and it's really good...).  They give you two different kinds of sauce, I don't really remember the difference but one I liked and one I didn't like at all.The sides were great.  The mac and cheese was AMAZING.  The peach cobbler had a hint of almond--delicious.  Baked beans were better than most others.  Cole slaw I could do without.  Cornbread was good.  Didn't try the fries but they looked good too.The place is efficiently ran and seemed to be very well managed.  There was a manager walking around and chatting with everyone to make sure they were happy.  The cashier rang up our order wrong but we got it straightened out (and the manager happened to notice we went back and approached us to help her help us).  The line was a good 10 people long with a single cashier.  It took over 30 minutes to wait through the line and wait for our food... From my experience, this is pretty typical of any rib place I've been to, and it seemed like they were really organized about it, so I'm not complaining.The parking situation was a little iffy... They do have a parking lot behind them (only during the off hours of another business, so after 5:30).  We found a spot, but the lot was nearly full.  There was a guy outside in an orange vest that they had hired to deal with helping people park in the right areas.  The street had some street parking but other places were zoned, and I overheard him telling someone else they had hired him because some crazy old woman was taking pictures of all the cars that parked in the wrong place.  It's nice of them to hire someone, I know most places would just not worry about it and let the customer worry about being towed.I don't know who rated this 1 $, I don't think it's possible to eat for under $10.  The rib meals are $18-19.  If you order the cheapest thing, which is probably one of the sandwiches, it would still be more than $10 once you add drink and tax.We went with ribs in mind, but it did seem like the brisket and pulled pork sandwichers were a lot more popular (by far).  They looked really delicious, I want to go back and try the brisket."
"I used to love ribs, but I'm not a pork eater anymore (bad food poisoning experience- plus all the stuff you hear about parasites..).Anyway, I loved the beef brisket, I wanted to try the bbq chicken, but they were all out. I guess that happens a lot there- running out of things.The flavor was excellent. It tasted smokey to me (glad my taste buds aren't burned out). The meat was tender and juicy. I too loved the mac and cheese, had the flavor and feel of a good homemade comfort food. Didn't like the coleslaw, just because it wasn't creamy-but it did taste fresh.What I didn't like, was the size and design of the place. It was like a jammed in picnic area with a bunch of people you don't know. Also, I don't know if I missed it, or I was too focused on thinking about how the food would taste-what the price on the chalkboard said for the brisket and what the cashier (and flyer) told me were two different things.So I hold back one star, not for the taste of the food, but other little annoying things.I can't wait to get back there and try the cornbread, fries,cobbler...and maybe I can even get there before the chicken runs out.---Update: tried the chicken, it was tender, juicy with a non-rubbery skin (the best part, for me). Unfortunatly, also noticed again, why would anyone want to eat the food inside there? I personally, don't like the experience of having impatient drooling people crowding my space and standing over me while I eat, but hey maybe that's just me..."
"Man was I dissapointed. Not only were the ribs dry (I tried their St Louis style dry rub or whatever) their service was disorganized. I had to go up to the counter and wait after we got our food since they gave me the wrong side dish.Some old man in a Smoques shirt came up to me and asked me ""Can I help you with something???"" but his tone was more like I was causing a problem and not because he wanted to ""help me"" and all I was doing was standing up at the counter waiting for my side dish. (hmm do I look like a troublemaker?...ok dont answer that hehe)The regular style ribs are a bit better but completely average.Ribs should come off the bone with ease me thinks, dont you? I had to gnaw the meat off. Im never going to come back here. NEVAR!!!"
"We like Smoque better as a take out joint then eat in. The place always feels a little...sticky. But the food is good, filling, and the price is right. The brisket just falls apart in your mouth. I always get the sliced brisket sandwich these days. I like their slaw, but my husband hates it.  It is too vinegary for his tastes. To be honest, the BBQ is just a bit too vinegary for my tastes (thus 4 stars instead of 5), but it is still pretty awesome."
Wow!! Sliced beef brisket is to die for and the BBQ chicken is also outstanding. I highly reccomend the baked beans and cornbread for your side choices. Also if u have Any room for desert the peach cobler is a must. But again the the beef brisket and chicken are great and the cool thing is if your torn between the two you can order the chicken and add a (taste) of brisket which is a nice size portion or any other menu item on the side for a decent price. I've been there three times and never been dissapointed so I'd say there very consistent and if I didn't live almost 20 miles away I'd probably be there every weeken. If ur tryin to decide if it will be worth the trip if ur far away trust me it is.
"Northside/Southside...the BBQ DifferenceTonight I drove from River North all the way to Pulaski and Irving and home to Edgewater to suit a craving for GOOD ribs.  I've heard amazing, glorious rave reviews about Smoque and had to give it a try.Over the years it's become apparent to me that there are two kinds of BBQ ribs in Chicago - Southside ribs and Northside ribs.  You could also say that there are juicy, perfectly smoked, saucy, meaty, succulent, GOOD ribs (Southside) and ribs that make me weep that a pig was slaughtered for nothing (Northside).  But I keep hanging onto the dream that somewhere on the Northside is some miraculous place that actually knows something about seasoning, smoking and saucing ribs.  So when I hear rave reviews about a BBQ rib restaurant on the Northside, I eventually cross my fingers, dive in and try it out.So tonight I dove into Smoque......and into a disappointing, hot mess.  I knew I was in trouble from the beginning when I ordered a half slab and requested the large end.  Not only did the order taker not know what the large end was, but when asked she informed me that customers usually do not specify which end of the slab they want (note taken about the customers).  I was also certain at this point that the fries would not be served nestled beneath the ribs or that 2 pieces of white bread would be found atop my ribs, but that is all forgivable.  I also ordered the pulled pork taste and brisket taste.  Getting home with my bag'o'meat I hoped for the best and prepared for the average.  Below average is what I got.  I don't recall ever seeing such a skinny, scrawny bunch of ribs.  The pig was obviously an anorexic with self image issues.  The chewiness of the meat though was ideal - I don't believe that meat is supposed to 'fall of the bone,' I like something that fights back a bit.  The seasoning was only on the surface, not throughout the meat.  The smoky flavor tho was throughout the meat, and was quite nice.  But then there was the sauce.  It's cute how the sauce was served on the side as if it may ruin the majesty of the rub that was used.  Perhaps the reason is that the sauce was so...bad.  It was definitely better than Open Pit, but not as good as Sweet Baby Ray's, which is available on the shelf at Dominick's.   Still I was certain the brisket would save me.  Wrong!  Since when is brisket dry?  This is actually the worse brisket I've had.  I gave it to my cat but she wouldn't eat it.  However, if you like Smoque's brisket, know that the $3 taste portion is a generous amount.  The fries were excellent!  I haven't tried the pulled pork yet, but fear it may end up in the trash to keep the scrawny ribs company.  Sadly, Smoque was just another place in a long disappointing line that proves that Northside restaurateurs should just put away the sauce, turn off the smoker and travel a few miles to the South side to learn something about the food they are mocking with their below par efforts.  If they don't want to go to the South side, then maybe a weekend trip to Jim and Nicks in Birmingham, Dinosaur in New York, Gates in Kansas or the guy with the BBQ grill in the post office parking lot in Waterloo, Iowa may help out.  These ribs are all different, but they are all good.  Just please, I beg of you...go learn something so I can get good ribs close to home!!!Still there is one meaty reason for Smoque and their ilk to ignore my review and my advice... they have great reviews and tons of customers.  This leads me to acknowledge that there is an entirely different way of preparing BBQ ribs which a whoooooole lot of people love and appreciate...the Northside way.  To everyone who enjoys Smoque and their buddies - enjoy!  Eat it up!  Sop it up!  Love it!  I truly envy you in your bliss.  Whatever you do, do NOT go to the Southside and eat real BBQ, such as at Lem's on 75th, as you will find yourself in my position...forced to drive 18 miles for enjoyable BBQ ribs. If anyone reading this knows what I'm talking about and knows a Northside place that proves me wrong...PLEASE tell me."
"yum yum yum. it is everything that everyone says it is and more. at first i was a little weirded out at the spices b/c those are completely baked on top and it looks like it's burned, but it grew on me and was really good. the mac and cheese is great, and i also got to try the cobbler and the cornbread. i love how it comes in just the right serving size. i also got two kinds of the brisket - both were delicious. one part is supposed to be juicier b/c it's more fatty. but if you're worried that the leaner meat isn't as good, no worries."
"Took the wife for lunch here yesterday.We came back for dinner with the kids tonight.I can't rule out a return visit within the next seven days. This place smells GREAT from the street. Even better than San Soo Gab San if that means anything to you.Story time. . .we joined the line out the door at 6:27pm on Memorial Day weekend and stood in light rain for about 10 minutes waiting to get in.While we waited outside the owner appeared and taped an apology on the door for running out of brisket. Ten minutes later he replaced that sign with an out of pulled pork/out of brisket sign. None of this looked good, and some other peeps in line began to scuttle away to their safe little plan B Thai places. Fail.Knowing what was at stake we decided to stick it out. We made it inside and felt the panic and longing as we tried to avoid leering at the other diners gnawing their ribs and stuffing those fat delicious fries down their gullets.The wife noticed plenty of pork sandwiches were still making it out of the prep area. Hmm. . .where did this magical bonus pork appear from? The smoker only holds so much meat, and it bestows its gifts but once a day, and lo it runneth out from time to time, but we decided they post the ""gone fishin"" signs when the line threatens to test the patience of the neighbors. Or maybe someone in the kitchen is about to stab someone.Anyway long story short we were all sitting down to delicious pulled pork sandwiches by 6:56. So let's do the math. . .even at their most slammed, this teeny L train sized shack can deliver you from literally out at the curb to pulled pork heaven inside of 30 minutes. Just keep your cool like the staff does and you'll be fine.ok let's talk portion control. I can overeat with the best of you slobs. . .Smoque's sandwiches are plenty big, even if you're one of those carb haters that scrapes the meat off. It comes with a ""small"" fry that has about 2 potatoes' worth in a grease lovin mini grocery bag and a fistful of slaw. I am not into slaw; I ate this slaw. It's crispy and fresh and has no mayo. Nice celery seed flavor to it though. The owner told me they add fresh dressing to the cabbage every 20 minutes. So kimche it's not. Thank god.Wow you're still here. . .ok for your first visit I'd suggest the half and half, just to validate your suspicion that the pulled pork is ever so slightly better than the brisket. Why do you think they make bacon out of pork? I rest my case. Still you need to try everything here, let's try that brisket. It's mighty good.2nd trip reconnect with the pork. mmmm pork.My next visit I'll get St. Louis style ribs. I'm told they are fattier, meatier and have mo' flav than the baby back ribs. Ribs are pricey and I'm cheap so I'll prob. get the half slab.Staff, presentation, ambience. . .in that order. The prep guys all look pretty tough, kinda like that. Actually I am totally grateful they didn't put up retarded ""authentic"" roadhouse memorabilia or weathered barnwood. I admit if it were grimy and old and on the south side and you got lost trying to find it it would seem like more of an adventure. Just saying.Check out the smoker when you go back to wash your hands. It's like 8 times bigger than those rotisseries they have at Dominick's.Prices are fair. We got out of there for around $10 a head. Not bad at all.Minor point, they do a lot of little things to keep it all running smoothly. Too boring to write about but I noticed them all. More restaurants should sweat the details like Smoque does.BYOB. We didn't. Pathetic really. Next time."
"Went here yesterday with a friend who says the beef brisket was terrific.  I respect my friends judgment in part  because he has eaten bbq pretty much all over the US.  I was excited to say the least.  The place is pretty minimal, which is good when it comes to bbq, you don't want to look around and see a pair of snowshoes or fake deer head with Mardi Gras beads on it (bad sign your in tgi Friday's).  The Brisket was great, it was moist, tender and had that ever important smoke ring all around the top.  The smoke ring is evidence that the meat has been slow cooked throughout the day/night and that the beef will retain alot of the flavor.  I also though the ribs were pretty decent as well, very tender off the bone.  The sides cornbread, fries, baked beans were good as well.  I would recommend getting the brisket sandwich and mix and match some sides or maybe another meat dish.  Price was reasonable $10-$14 per person but you expect to pay that for bbq that is done well. Very good place, they get the food to you quick and the sauce is mighty tasty."
"...and I was back for the brisket, and it ROCKS.  I felt as though I owed them an update after they catered my wedding in September.  I just wanted to say that they were awesome.  They were right on time and everything was just as we imagined it would be.  Tons of rave reviews about the food.  If you're looking for something a little more fun and much more delicious for your event I would definitely recommend Smoque.  The only thing I would say is that they somewhat overestimated the amount of food we needed.  Not that I'm complaining... we froze bags of meat and macaroni and sauce and will be eating Smoque for the rest of the year.  :)  Thanks guys!!"
Love it.  Worth the long line and inconvenient location.
"Quite possibly the best bbq I've ever had, this far north of Georgia. GREAT delivery on all of the food. The beans are incredible. The sliced brisket is mouth watering. The ribs are so tender, you'll think the bones were stirred in for good measure. The place gets PACKED and the neighbors seem to hate the place but go! Park on Pulaski and be mindful of the parking signs. Bring beer, an IPA would go well. Go, be hungry, let the chef pick for you but DO get cornbread and extra sauce."
Good BBQ and is consistent. Have them cater to you and your guests will be happy.
"My benchmark for all things bbq is the Salt Lick just outside of Austin, TX. so I have pretty high standards when it comes to my grilled/smoked meats.  I try to judge Chicago bbq by a different standard as it is a different beast and my personal opinion is that you can't really call it bbq if it's made north of the Mason Dixon line.  Then I ate at Smoque...Smoque can hold their own with the best of them, and I'm not talking Chicago bbq standards.  These people are making bbq RIGHT, Mason Dixon line be damned.  The very best ribs I've ever had in Chicago and, in fact, some of the best I've had anywhere, period.  I got the combo baby back/St. Louis and, although both were excellent, definitely favor the St. Louis style. The brisket...oh...perfect pink smoke ring, gorgeous bark, tender juicy meat.  There isn't a brisket in town that can top it.  The Texas Link IS a Texas Link.  Holy moly, I thought I was at some German smokehouse in Texas when I ate that thing - beautifully marbled with fat, smokey, juicy, and a natural casing that gives it a fantastic snap. I'm a happy girl.Sides are also good, I particularly recommend the baked beans which are studded with chunks of porky goodness.  My husband hated the mac and cheese, I loved it.  In fact, I loved it even more on the 2nd day, it's good stuff.  The coleslaw is of the vinegar/pepper based school, not my fave, but has very finely shaved bits of red onion in it that really makes it shine.  In fact, the only thing I've had here that could even be qualified as a disappointment is the pulled pork.  Delicious, but not nearly as good as the rest of their menu.  That fantastic smokey flavor you find in all of their other offerings is lost on this dish.  It's still tender and good, just lacking a bit of oomph/flavor.  It is the one item here that I actually needed to put sauce on. The sauce, btw, is fantastic, but I definitely prefer the lighter Carolina based one.  My one quibble is the lack of white bread - god intended us to eat white bread with our BBQ, dammit, could you just dole out a couple of slices of wonder bread with the cue, please?Pricey, but 1 rib dinner, 1 brisket dinner and a side of pulled pork and a Texas link fed myself and my husband for nearly 3 days, so overall a very good value.  Compared to my beloved Salt Lick, this is a four star joint. That being said, this is Chicago and if you love bbq, you need Smoque in your life, ASAP.  It surpasses the hype and truly raises Chicago bbq to a whole new level."
"Yelp reviews are screwing with my head. OK, now that I got that out the way. We are (wannabe) serious BBQ freaks that find just about any reason in the world to throw ribs on the grill. Although my country style ribs, tenderly loved and slow cooked, are the talk of family, friends and neighbors (straight southerners - which is a compliment), I have yet to get all into the ""BBQing every part of a cow and pig"" . I promise to do so this summer .... No, you are not invited. At work that morning I was going through reviews on Cuban food when for some odd reason, I ended up looking at a bunch of BBq reviews. I get home and tell my wife to pack up the lil hunie and we headed off to Smoque. I have to admit that the first reviews were given to us by my in-laws about 1 year ago. When we first walked in, I finally understood why people are always touching on the space issue. Yes, it is fairly small and thinly furnished, which is fine with me. Luckily we went around 4pm and it was pretty empty....Goood! The crew was all smiles and seemed upbeat, which is a plus when we visit a new place. Smiles make reviews like this, go up that half a star. The food - Places that get this much attention, usually worry me because they quickly forget about the quality and go for the profits. That was not the case with smoque. We ordered the full slab of baby back ribs, (sides-included) mac and cheese (of course), BBQ beans, cornbread and fries. First off , the mac and cheese is yummy. I rate my mac and cheese on crust only, which this one - had the best. The beans were good but my wife (the bean lover) did not have much of a reaction from them, so I will leave them as OK. The ribs were very tasty and cooked with just the right amount of burn to them. The ribs get a thumbs up from me. I ordered some brisket but in the rib eating frenzy, it got cold, I will leave that rating out. I asked my wife if she wanted to try the pulled pork and she gave a ""I am about to explode"" yes. The pulled pork sandwich is the best!!!! GO PULLED PORK SANDWICH! The pork melts in you mouth and the sauce (with a touch of Tabasco added by me) is killer! The only negative I have about this joint, is the serving sizes. I know what you are thinking ""he is a big guy"", but my wife is petite and thought the same thing. I can pop the serving of mac and cheese or the cornbread, into my mouth like a tic tac. I would (and will) go back only for the Pulled Pork sandwich and leave the rest to another BBQ joint or my back yard grill! I give it 3 1/2 stars"
"My favorite BBQ joint.  Well I guess at least until I try some down South.  Bonus that Smoque is close to my neighborhood. Half and half sandwich (pulled pork/brisket), baked beans and peach cobbler is my regular order.  With bites of ribs off my husband's plate.Minus one eensy weensy star for running out of stuff.  Apparently their smoker capacity can't keep up with demand.  Hopefully they will get more room for more meat asap.Most of the 4-5 star reviews have summed up my feelings about the place, so I'll just share some tips from my experiences:Mid afternoon here is the best time to dine in.  They will likely have short lines and all menu items available.  Call in for carry-out if you want the stuff at peak times.  Don't eat in if you don't like eating next to a stranger.  But you know, a stranger here is a BBQ loving friend you haven't met yet.  There has always been an owner there in my experience.  If you have any problem, look around to find one/ask if you need to. They will do whatever it takes to help you out.  Writing this review has reminded me it's been too long since I was there last and lunch is just around the corner..."
"Gave it another shot tonight. The ribs were fantastic! Still think the brisket platter serving is quite underwhelming in size. Loved the beans, mac n cheese just OK. Phone in and carry out is the way to go."
"Great BBQ!  The mac and cheese is an absolute must have.  I greatly enjoy the chicken as well.  Cornbread is outrageously good, and you won't want to share.  This is a must go 5 star place!  There are usually long lines and waits, so be prepared.  They will clear you plate when you are done in attempt to move you out quickly, but not necessarily rush you.  I understand.  Great place!"
"Went there around 2pm on a Saturday - barely any wait. Two friends and I ordered the pulled pork platter (coleslaw, peach cobbler, and mac&cheese) and the brisket. The brisket is amazing! Tender, full of flavor, slightly charred, and a little bit of fat on the edging. Pulled pork was good but not the best I've had. Cole slaw was vinegar based - lightly marinated, not to strong, a great accompaniment to the brisket and pork. Mac & cheese (baked) was typical. The cobbler was a comfort dessert - pretty sure they were made with canned peaches, however still really tasty. Their ribs were out of commission (issues with quality from the source) so I'll be interested in trying those next time."
"This place is similar to Hot Doug's.  Get there right when it opens or be prepared to wait (although the wait is much shorter at Smoque).  I'm from Chicago, so my BBQ palate isn't quite as nuanced as someone from say, Texas. That being said, I came here with a coworker who grew up in Texas.  He got the beef brisket and proclaimed this place to be just as good as anything in Texas!!!  I've never been disappointed with Smoque. The ribs, the brisket, the pulled pork, it's all delicious."
"Jeff L and I stopped by smokey the other day to get some takeout. It was CRAZY busy. Good thing we got in when we did because the line quickly went out of the door and there was no where to sit for anyone. We eventually got our order. The manager (I assume) was very nice and thanked us for moving to another table so a boy could sit with his parents. When we got home we ripped open the food. Everything smelled really good. The brisket was orgasmic! They didn't give you enough it was so so good. I've never had better! The Saint Louis ribs were great too. The meat came off the bones. The baby back ribs were terrible, I couldn't even eat them. They weren't cooked enough so instead of the meat falling off the bone it was more like eating a overcooked breakfast steak and a diner! boo! After all was said and done we got a ton of food for $60! It was pretty good. I'll go back but I won't order the baby back ribs again!Update: Went back and got gross tough ribs that were inedible =( Come ON BBQ places!!! Cook your food."
"Best BBQ in Chicago I've had.  Sauce isn't my style.  Nothing spicy at all.  The woman explained this because its ""Carolina"" Style.  I've never been to a Carolina BBQ joint that didn't have a spicy bbq sauce so not really a reason.  Great for Chicago though."
"Smoque was on my list of places to visit for at least 3 years.I must say the food was excellent.We went in the middle of the afternoon at 3pm on a weekday, thinking that it would not be packed, after a driveby of a packed Kuma's corner not too far away.We tried the ribs, which I wasn't too impressed with.  It had a dry rub with sauce on the side, but I felt like I had better ribs at Famous Dave's and Portillos.  Nonetheless, it was still good but not memorable.The beef brisket was probably the best brisket I've ever had, very tender, falling apart easily, just enough fat with a sweet sauce on the side.  The brisket is a must have."
"We ordered the baby back ribs with beans and mac and cheese and the taste portion of sausage. The rib portion was generous and came with plenty of BBQ sauce to cover them with. They were smoky and the rub was tasty. The beans were also smoky with lots of onions and the mac and cheese was creamy and covered with bread crumbs that gave it a nice texture. Absolutely loved the sausage; we plan to order more next time. I ordered carry out on a Friday and was told there was a 1 1/2 hour wait for pick up, which was fine. However, the woman who took the phone order told me about the wait as if she was hoping I would change my mind and not place an order. She was very rude and short with me when I asked her a question. But I would risk the rudeness again because the food was fantastic."
"Kinda  ok. I hate waiting in line to eat. and they need more space. Pulled pork was good. Mac and cheese was too salty, beans were alright at best. . BUT! The staff was great and the service was good."
"Now this is what I'm talking about!  Finally found some respectable BBQ in Chicago.  All the meat items received a satisfactory score in my grade books.  I usually like my baby back ribs to just fall off the bone, but I'm quite happy with Smoque's offerings.  Even sweeter, I got to use my Chicago a la card too!"
My FAVORITE BBQ joint around!! Delicious pulled pork and chopped brisket!! Ask for a side of rib sauce with your brisket tastes great that way!! And when ordering a brisket meal or any for that matter... Be sure to order a large sized mac and cheese!!!(which is pretty much a double order.)  Soooooooo YUMMY!
"BYOB. What did I do before living in a city that has BYOB?I have no idea.If they run out of pulled pork, or brisket? Don't have a tantrum. Just keep coming back until you can order it & put it in your face.Best bbq in the city. In conclusion, I dream about their macaroni and cheese."
"If you are going to Smoque at dinner time, be prepared to wait. The line snakes out the door and the seating is in short supply during rush. Bring along a sixer (this place is BYOB) and hunker down for a wait if your order does not include brisket. Fries here are great - as good as any I've had in Chicago. I'm a non-four legged animal eater, so it was chicken all-around. The dark meat was moist, and the breast was, as expected, a bit dry. The smoke flavor was mild, the skin was golden. Beans were good - again, good smoke flavor, good sauce, delicious. The slaw was nothing special, although thankfully mayo-free.I'd go back...but not too soon."
"I'm not going to even bother writing a review - the 500+ reviewers who have already raved about Smoque have said it all. Service was good - the order line moved fast last Saturday around 12:30 pm. Seating was plentiful at that time. I had the brisket and yes it was the best brisket I've ever had. A signature Chicago experience, not to be missed."
"I like that they give you many options for combining food - 1/2 brisket and 1/2 pulled pork on a sandwich, the option to add small tasting portions of things to your meal.  The brisket sandwich was spectacular, the fries were hot and crispy, the mac & cheese was a little cupcake of cheesy heaven - now  I want to go back and try the pulled pork and the peach cobbler.  We got an order of the chicken to go for eating the next day, and when I popped it in the microwave cats and roommates came out of their lairs to see what was cooking."
"I don't see what the big deal is about this place.  It's a friendly neighborhoody BBQ restaurant, but they seem to have ramped up the hype machine to get themselves noticed everywhere from the Reader to The Hungry Hound.Food is very homemade-tasting, which is good, and prices are reasonable.  The mac & cheese side and the coleslaw are both tasty, and feel like you could be eating them at a family reunion.I also had the brisket which was decent, but not mind-blowing.Smoque is good comfort food, but really - what's up with all the hype around it?"
Not that great. All I tasted was lemon as the BBQ sauce. Baby Back Blues in Plainfield Il. is sooooo much better. It is worth the drive.
"I don't get it. This place has great reviews and I wouldn't classify it as anything more than meh. Not a lot of taste in the brisket or pork. Bad fries, but very good Mac and Cheese. Bit overpriced. Won't be going back and I'm not really sure why others do too."
"I grew up in Texas and am accustomed to top-notch BBQ. Smoque tastes like home. I love the ""Add a Taste"" option, which lets you add a small portion of any of various meats to your meal. Order take-out, and this gives you enough food for two or three meals. The chicken is good, (Texas) sausage is pretty great, and brisket is perfect. Unbelievably tender, moist, and perfectly blackened on the outside, this brisket tops 75% of the brisket I've had in the South. The peach cobbler is amazing, too.I can't wait to try the pulled pork and ribs."
"Having previously been to Smoque, I decided it was a good choice for my niece.  As a 9-year old, she is an admitted, ""ribs snob"" so I figured she would like Smoque.  The minute she opened the door and got a whiff of what was cookin' her eyes got huge and she got a big smile on her face.  She loved the baby back ribs but she didn't care for Smoque's BBQ sauce.  For her, it was too spicy (she doesn't care for anything spicy).  I once again ordered the pulled brisket and it was as delicious as always.  I've never been a fan of their vinegar-based cole slaw or their macaroni and cheese (kinda bland) but LOVE their french fries.  My niece gave the fries 2 thumbs up as well.  I like the no-frills attitude of Smoque but I have to ding them on not having any ice in the ice machine!"
"So although I have only had carry out from Smoque, the fact that ever since that day I have been daydreaming about the beef brisket renders it possible for me to give them a 5.  Even the side dishes were phenomenal.  We had some left overs and I tried my best to wait until lunch the next day to eat them, but i only made it to 10:30 A.M.  The bbq sauce was no over powering and had a sweet vinegar taste, without tasting like sloppy joe (how bbq brisket often tastes).  I can't wait to go back!!!"
My god I love pulled pork.And this is why I love Smoque (their brisket isn't too shabby either)!The boxed meal comes with slaw and your choice of side- I would highly recommend the mac & cheese!  The place has a great look to it as well- industrial meets BBQ.  I can't wait to go back!
"i have been seriously slacking on my reviews. how long ago did i even eat here? i think it might have been warm out. yikes.anyhoo... this is what i remember1. i had a pulled pork sammich that was DELISH2. i had some microscopic mac and cheese. you tryin to tell me somethin?3. the cornbread was a little sweet, which i love!4. i ordered the chopped brisket for my mans, but apparently i was supposed to order the sliced. whoops.tasty late night bbq goodness. why have i not been back?"
"Whoa Mamma how I love Smoque. The smoky goodness starts the moment you walk in the door and smell the meat.  My god, the meat. Growing up in the South, brisket wasn't really a menu option.  Boy, did we miss out.  The brisket here is delicous, with a wonderful ratio of crunchy bits to juicy ones.  The St Louis ribs are chewy (which is a good thing), a little fatty (also a good thing) and spiced just right.  Everyone raves about the macancheese but honestly, I wasn't that impressed.  Now the cornbread, on the other hand, is impressive. Sweet, with real corn and a slightly crunchy top, it goes well with the spiced meat. And they have real sweet tea. And though I may not be a foodie by any stretch of the imagination, I am a teaie. Well,  an iced sweet teaie, anyway.  And it's so freakin' good here. What are you waiting for? Also, if you love a man in uniform, then you have another reason to try it. Every time I've visited there have been at least 4 of Chicago's Finest feasting on the smoked meats."
"I admit, I am not a BBQ expert, or even fanatic. But this food is yum-yum-YUMMY. The price seems just a smidge high by typical BBQ food standards. But you leave feeling so full and satisfied, it's worth it once in a while. The order at the cash register then go find a seat system might make some first-timers feel a bit lost or apprehensive. The place is too small for its own good. It's so popular, there's usually a long line anytime, anyday. The rib portions are very small for the price. But the chicken is a pretty healthy size. The side dishes are perhaps what push this place over the top for me. The mac and cheese and peach cobbler are to die for! This may not be a good place for kids if you're carting a bulky stroller or have a picky eater. That means more mac n cheese for me! I suggest this place find a bigger place to serve more fans of their eats."
The meat is still a bit bland.  It could do with having a more pronounced smoky taste.  The smoky taste is there -- I can make it out -- but it's too subtle.  Might it be that the choice of wood isn't producing a terribly pronounced smoky taste?The owner/manager and staff continue to impress.
"Finally-Brisket I can LOVE. So far, the best brisket I have liked has been home crafted by true BBQ  lovers or a couple of joints in Texas, but the brisket here is actually the best I have ever had. Pulled pork was surprisingly sub-par. With all the place had going for it, it was a bit dry and tasted only like sauce (which is tasty) but not the porky goodness that I love. Served on a giant bun of Hawaiian bread that added a nice sweetness but was too fluffy and should have probably been a bit denser. The ribs (the larger St. Louis style) I love were great. Perfectly tender. There is this disgusting love for 'fall off the bone' ribs that makes people boil ribs to cook them then throw them in a smoker or on a grill. Boiled meat, people? What, are we English? no dude, it's gotta be smoked and thiers are amazingly tender but not sodden. really good and served with the Memphis style BBQ sauce.They have 2 sauces - Memphis style: sweet, molasses-y, thick and the South Carolina: thinner and vinegar-y. I usually prefer the tangier S Carolina, but theirs is tangy, but not much smoke or spice - The fell I was with said it was good on whatever he was eating. I found it to be 'meh' I actually really enjoyed the Memphis style - well balanced, smoky and not too sweet. Good texture too; stuck to my meat but not gooey.The baked beans...that was an odd story. My first bite was heaven. They were amazing. But I couldn't take more than 2 or 3 bites at a time before I was bored with them. It's an interesting taste, but they were almost too sock it to me and didn't have much of a 'beany' flavor.  So it was nibble something, take a bite of beans. leave them alone for a while, go back to them, have a couple of bites etc. Weird, huh?mac and cheese had a delicious buttery crumb topping, but otherwise only a bit above mediocre. What most BBQ places do is make a couple of sauces and then douse everything int he sauce: all the meats, the beans, the sausages. Great if you love the sauce! This place had very unique tastes to all the food. The brisket, ribs, pork, beans, all were unique and that is a new thing to me in the BBQ world. Unfortunately some of them missed the mark - but not by enough  not to come back.  The biggest thing is that everything is a bit too much, except the noble simple coleslaw which is simple and palate cleansing. You already heard it's crazy crowded with a few tiny tables.It's BYOB, but too busy to kick back and enjoy a brew. Eat and run style.Staff is friendly and helpful.Delicious brisket, seriously the best I have ever had, great ribs, and one very good sauce with sides that are passable."
"YUM!  Smoque was just as we expected....but better.  The service was fast and very friendly.  They do a great job of keeping the place clean during the rush. The sink/soap set up in the bathroom was no nonsense so you could get in there and wash all the tasties off your hands. Back to the food....couldn't get enough of it! Pulled pork was so tender and flavorful. Cornbread wasn't too dry.  Beans, slaw, mac'n'cheese, ribs, chicken....all delicious!  Next time, I might ride my bike there just to balance it all out."
"I can see why folks who live in Irving/Portage Park might give Smoque 4 or 5 stars, it's a nice place in an area which doesn't have a whole lot going on in terms of interesting or exciting eats.  The spartan decor of the dining room does not bother me (though so far all my visits have been take-out).Their menu is pretty simple as BBQ places go, here's my evaulation of what I've sampled so far:St. Louis Ribs & Pulled Pork - pretty goodBaby Back ribs & Brisket - so-soSide items - very modest portions, but the mac & cheese and beans are greatI also like that they put the sauces on the side, sometimes I prefer that my meat not be swimming in BBQ sauce.One thing that has recently annoyed me about Smoque is apparent issues with ""running out"" of food later on weekend evenings.  One Sunday I called in for carryout, the person on the phone advised that they were out of brisket & pulled pork - no big deal, since I really wanted ribs, but they sounded like they would have preferred that I give up and order some other day.  On a more recent Saturday, I tried three times to call in an order about an hour or so before their closing time, but no one was picking up the phone.  The money I was going to spend at Smoque that night ended up going to Smokin' Woody's. Maybe this is just a new business ""growing pains"" thing that will eventually be resolved?  In summary, I'd go back to Smoque if I was in the area, but probably would not go too far out of my way to visit again."
"Brisket:  Meh, no taste.Ribs:  YumPulled Pork: OrgasmicYou know you're at a good eatin' place when you're surrounded by ""professionals.""  Be sure to get the bbq sauce on your sandwich that's used for the ribs, it's thicker and has a more smokey flavor.  Found a new favorite spot!"
"The 5 star review parade marches on!  The northside Chicago BBQ scene has always been so sad- at other places I'd learned to dose up my meat with tons of sauce to get my flavor and have been left wondering, what did the meat even taste like?  Smoque fixes that by doing it right!  Long/slow smoking of the meat infuses wonderful taste, plus a nice spice rub and all I need is a little of their homemade sauce to finish what is by far the best BBQ I've had in the city.  I seriously burp smokey goodness for a couple hours after pigging out here!  And I end up with extra/unused sauce!?!Their sides have all been super tasty too!  My favorite is that peach cobbler counts as a side with your rib order.  Oh yeah, they welcome BYOB too!Parking is a little bit of a challenge, and the place has been reasonably crowded too.  But totally worth getting here...a reasonable walk from my house, and eating here I'm gonna need the exercise!"
This is the best bbq in the city.  I cannot describe in words which means just go and find out what everybody else knows about this place.
"Serves one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had north of the Mason-Dixon line. A visit to Mississippi back in 2006 introduced me to the heavenly pleasures of Memphis' Leonard's Pit Barbecue and Clarksdale's Abe's Barbecue. I lamented that while Chicago offers plenty of fantastic BBQ (Honey One BBQ, for instance), I'd probably never get a good southern BBQ place in my immediate area. Hooray for Smoque! Besides the fantabulous pulled pork sandwich, the sides are filling and fulfilling. Get the beans and mac and cheese, and end with the cobbler. One tip: order ahead to avoid the long lines on the weekend. Eating at the actual restaurant is fine, but bringing it all back home to enjoy at your peaceful leisure is better."
"Unfortunately, I must deviate from some of the high praise offered for Smoque. There are many fine things about Smoque. The service was fun and friendly, and the sauce is outstanding. The pulled pork was also excellent, which is saying something because I prefer North Carolina style pulled pork with a vinegar based sauce.The reason I have to ding Smoque is that our ribs were undercooked. We got both baby back and spare ribs, and both needed more time in the smoker. It was a Sunday evening and it was very busy, so I suspect they were pulling the ribs off early in order to feed the crowd. Nonetheless, I was disheartened because I had heard so many rave reviews.Smoque has clearly become a top BBQ destination in the city and you should check it out. I plan to return and give it another try. But if you're a rib fanatic, you should consider the timing of your visit to avoid ending up with undercooked ribs that were pulled off the smoker prematurely."
"I can't say I have much to add that hasn't been aptly chronicled by other Yelpers.* Overview: This is indeed some of the best BBQ you will find in Chicago.  And at a very reasonable price, if you ask me.  (Not cheap per se, but inexpensive for BBQ -- you can get a sandwich and side for like $7-$8 and they sell sides and small portions of everything for like $4 if you want to sample it all.)* Details: Their sauce is a little runny but pretty good -- I'm picky in this regard and I liked it enough to use most of it.  Pulled pork was excellent; I liked the fattiness and moisture and the roll was a nice sweet compliment to the pork.  Could use a pickle.  The St Louis ribs were okay by me; I didn't think they were far and away better than Carsons, but likely better than Robinsons, Twin Anchors, and most chains.  French fries were very, very good -- lots of flavor and very crispy.  Baked beans were also very good -- a couple different types of beans, plenty of porky goodness.  The corn bread comes in a funny little tin.  The tin is actually a pain in the ass and the corn bread isn't anything special.* Yes, it is a little bit of zoo and they might run out of what you want to eat.  Either call ahead or be ready to play it by ear.  I wouldn't want to eat in on a crowded night.  It's too bad they don't deliver, although it would likely take forever.  Not terribly difficult to get to but there's not much else to do in that neighborhood except get back on the El or in a cab if you can find one.  * Easy directions. Take Blue Line to Irving Pk Road, exit at the south end of platform, right on Pulaski under the highway and down two blocks on your right.  Or Red Line to Sheridan and then switch to an Irving Park Road bus.  Trust me, it'll take forever, especially if you're bringing the goodies back to your apartment."
"I have to say thank you to my friend Eric for introducing us to this place. You really can't go wrong with anything here. The brisket is my favorite, so tender and juicy and with the sauce just pushes it over the top. Thanks to the owner Al too. He was so cool and gave our friend a free shirt cause he's moving to Baltimore. The sides are ssooo good too. I'm not a big fan of beans, mac n' cheese, fries, or cole slaw, but there I will have one of each thank you. The only downside might be that the line to get in can be long and the place is usually crowded, but isnt that a sign of a place with great food? And it's definitely worth the wait."
"I went to Smoque a few years ago and was underwhelmed, but upon my latest visit (about a week ago), I was blown away.  We waited about half an hour in line before getting our food and were tempted to go somewhere else.  I am so glad we didn't because the food was amazing.  My husband and I ordered a lot -- the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches, fries, colewslaw, cornbread and peach cobbler.  Each and every dish was absolutely amazing.  There's really nothing more to say.  This is the only place that rivals Fat Willy's, in my opinion, and I've been to most of the BBQ joints on the North Side."
"Hooray for a new restaurant in my ever-so-slowly gentrifying neighborhood!  All of that aside, however; this place is GREAT.  Seriously some of the best barbecue I have ever had.  The meat was incredibly lean but somehow still incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned.  I love love love the pulled pork sandwich (which is really so big it should be considered two sandwiches).  And oh my god the brisket!  And the macaroni and cheese is so creamy and cheesy and delicious and good!  My boyfriend and I went for dinner, left stuffed even though we couldn't finish our sandwiches, and spent less than $20.  And it's BYOB, which makes it even more of a bargain.My only complaint is the ambiance/decor.  The room is kind of cold and the chairs aren't comfortable at all.  Still, a small thing to overlook for barbecue this good!3/12/07 EDIT:My last three attempts to eat here have been thwarted.  Apparently business has been TOO good, as I have been greeted on the aformentioned three occasions by signs on the door saying 'sold out'.  How can a restaurant located in a major city in the Midwest be completely sold out of meat on a Thursday?  Is the owner not paying his bills?  If you don't live in the neighborhood and you're making a special trip to check this place out, I'd recommend calling first so you're not disappointed."
"This very well could be my number one choice for BBQ in the city.  Went there for the first time this weekend after reading a review in the Redeye.  The slow cooked chopped brisket sandwich was one of the best I have ever had.  Almost as good was the pulled pork!  The BBQ is the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.   The cole slaw with red onions was excellent.  The baked mac n cheese met every expectation.  The fries were perfect.  My brother in law had the St. Louis Ribs and said ""If I lived above Twin Anchors and [Smoque] was 10 blocks away, I would make the walk without a doubt"".  I really can't tell you how much I liked this place and how excited I am to return!------------------------------------------HOURS---­-------------------------------Closed MondayTues, Wed, Thurs and Sun 11am-9pmFri & Sat 11am-10pm~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
"We walked into Smoque's around 2pm on a Saturday and it was very crowded. No available seats. A guy asked us how  many and said he would help us find a table. The line moved quickly to place our order. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. My friend ordered the brisket.We had to stand around awhile aimlessly because there were no available seats. People were sitting around post-meal, which I understand but this is not the type of place to do so because seats are so limited. When I took the first bite of pulled pork sandwich, I was amazed! It was so good. The bread melts in your mouth and the meat is so tender and flavorful. The macaroni was AMAZING. Not a cole slaw fan--wish I would have substituted the macaroni for cole slaw. My date LOVED the brisket as well. He got cornbread which HE LOVED which is to say  lot because his mother is a baker. The beans were wonderful as well.It seems you can do no wrong at Smoque's"
"Food earns the 3-stars. Pulled-pork was great, mac and cheese was cheesy, fries were too greasy, slaw was crunchy - the way I like it. BUT it turns out this ""kind"" of bbq isn't my fave. It didn't wow me.Ambience gets a big fat zero. I don't mean to be ass, I know this place isn't TRYING to be known for its atmosphere, but, well ... the lighting was very harsh, too bright. Concrete floors and walls (easy to clean?). Surprisingly it wasn't loud, despite all the people.Fast, efficent and good. I'll go back but this isn't my #1 choice for barbeque."
"Smoque's food is delicious and huge portions.  I really like the thin barbeque sauce.  Yum.  The fries are also outstanding.  If you don't like waiting in long lines, or the lack of personal space while eating in the restaurant, go for take-out."
"OMG, killer mac and cheese, killer pulled pork...totally worth the wait, though if you call ahead for carry-out, you can bypass the line.  If you actually want to eat in the restaurant, it can be kind of a pain, but if you plan ahead it's manageable.  Before I went there, I figured it can't be *that* great if every likes it so much, but it really was, and the authentic smokey (or shall I say smoquey) bbq flavor is tough to beat.   Plus, their sauce is completely amazing.  Definitely check it out!"
"I would live here if they let me. Best brisket ever. Fabulous mac and cheese with bread crumbs. Perfect fries in a tiny paper bag. And I can order a half sandwich when I want,  to make room for their sides. happy. happy. happy tummy."
"I suppose I fancy myself a BBQ connoisseur. Having grown up in the Chicago area, I have a fondness and affinity for that sticky-sweet-tomatoey-Carson's-type of sauce (not that I would complain about L. Woods either). However, having lived in the deep south for many years, I also appreciate that pit-wet-and-dry-smokey-vinegary thing as well. So I was very excited when a new BBQ place had opened in the neighborhood.Smoque is a little place on a well-traveled corner. It is very clean and brightly lit (almost too brightly lit) and there are about 20 simple wooden tables with chairs, all of which were filled when we arrived. There is an open kitchen with a counter with friendly people, where you place and pick up your order. The nice-sized brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and platters have a terrific depth of flavor, with that smoky tang that takes you to the Carolinas, or Memphis, or someplace down there. Individual ramekins of cornbread and mac and cheese are noteworthy complements, and the BBQ beans should not be missed. They do a nice salad that you can add chicken to, and they serve it with a creamy ranch dressing that makes it very rich. I think I would add a few drops of sauce to that dressing for a bit more piquancy. All in all a lovely experience, comforting and reasonably priced. Get in there!"
"In addition to all the great points made in the other 5000 reviews of this place, I want to make this one:The CHICKEN is phenomenal.  So, if you're looking at the menu and want something ever-so-slightly healthier than the pulled pork, brisket, or ribs, then you can order the chicken with confidence.  it was probably the most flavorful, delicious chicken I've had.  the salad - not so great.  I also had the pulled pork, St. Louis Ribs, and beans - all awesome."
"I think just the sheer fact that Smoque has been reviewed over 400 times speaks for it self.  You don't get this much attention for being bad or even mediocre.I always have my favorite, the Chopped Brisket Sandwich.  I prefer this over the sliced because I feel I get a little more and better distribution of the charred rub....MMMMMMMMMMMM!I am not a big fan of their style of cole slaw...bygones!  I just happen to like my slaw on the creamier side.  BUT their decadent and rich Macaroni & Cheese more than makes up for it....OUTSTANDING!On this occasion, my friend and I shared a half rack of the St. Louis Ribs and were not disappointed.  I love my Baby Backs, but there's enough of me to go around.  Very flavorful and tender.  And don't forget to incorporate the semi-sweet BBQ Sauce.  It is not the same as the vinegar-based brisket BBQ sauce.In reality, their space is functional and simple.  No flash in this place; down to exposed ceiling and no nonsense paper-covered aluminum trays.  But, it doesn't bother me.  The hypnotic affect of heavenly BBQ aromas perhaps blinds my visual senses. It has gotten a little run down due to such heavy traffic, especially during football season.  During the football season, I call in my order and run in to pick up, much to the chagrin of the newbies standing outside in line exposed to Chicago winters.The hardworking staff is always friendly and the owners/management are approachable.  Heck, their office is the 2-top against the wall under the big chalkboard menu.My only complaint, they are not in walking distance to me!  I can really use the exercise after devouring their fare.  Can't wait for a second location.  Maybe I'll get lucky....O'Hare area PLEASE!!!"
"For a place known for their BBQ, I enjoyed the Peach Cobbler and the Mac N' Cheese the most.  The Mac as the best I have ever had and the Peach Cobbler was the perfect desert.  I was very excited to come to Smoque, I have been trying to get here for a while.  However, I have to say I was a bit let down.  The sauce was good, but not as good as some of the more famous places in Chicago and the 'burbs.  The chopped brisket was good, but I wish I had noticed the 1/2 and 1/2 (meaning combining any of their sandwiches to get a 1/2 of one and 1/2 of another).  I love both brisket and BBQ pork, so I would liked to have tried both. My wife loved her baby backs and the cornbread, I loved that the Cole slaw wasn't creamy and the beans were just average.  I love that its a locally owned place from new restaurateurs.  I will definitely be back to try some other dishes and really want them to succeed."
"There really isn't much to say that hasn't been said. Simply put, this is the best BBQ place in the city. I had the pulled pork sandwich, the brisket sampler and a side of mac n' cheese. All were top notchOnly drawback, like most great places, this place has a bit of a wait. I go weekdays after lunch and my wait is still usually 20 minutes to a half hour. Weekend nights...forget about it.However, great BBQ is worth the wait for some and this place is the best."
Best ribs in all of Illinois the ribs are the best I've ever tasted and for some reason believe it or not their macaroni is too One star is missing for the long wait and I personally don't like the indoor set up
I have not found a smoked barbecue place in the city that's better than Smoque. I live less than a mile from this place and I can almost smell the aroma from my house.
"I had the brisket platter with slaw, mac & cheese, and bbq beans and a drink all for $12.  I thought that was pretty decent for a bbq joint.  The brisket was tender and the sauce wasn't bad.  Good lunch spot."
"I've been craving bbq for a while and Smoque was the perfect remedy when I went there this past Saturday. I had a chopped brisket sandwich with a side of mac 'n cheese. The brisket was divine--tender, juicy, and oh-so full of flavor. And it was BIG, which I'm grateful for because that day I felt like a pregnant woman in July, craving a side of beef.The mac 'n cheese was excellent. I do, however, wish they offered a little bit larger size than the dixie cup-size that accompanied my meal.I do have two *teensy-weensy* complaints, though...if you would even call them ""complaints""....more like ""future suggestions"".When I go to a bbq joint, I expect it to be a true ""meat & threes"" place. At Smoque, you can only pick one side and then you have to choke down the free celery salt-induced coleslaw (grody for me because i hate celery). You don't even get free cornbread or johnny cakes! Give a girl her cornbread, fer chrissakes!  BUT, their are sides are cheap, so paying an additional buck-nineteen or whatever isn't bad at all.Also, it gets rather crowded after 6 and then it seems like the staff kind of loses control and everything suffers. It takes longer to order, it takes longer to receive your food, and some of those elderly yuppy customers living along Pulaski can get BITCH-AY standing in line when they don't get their food right away!It might even help if they add another desserts to their menu. But who knows, maybe the peach cobbler is so spectacular, they don't need another sweet."
"UPDATE: Are we seriously judging this place on the dining environment, the lighting, and the color of the walls?  Good grief.  IT IS A BBQ PLACE without table service... what do you expect?  Not that I care in ANY way, but for a BBQ place, it looks pretty damn good: clean walls, clean tables, clean floors, clean kitchen upon which anyone can look, and clean restrooms.  And because people seem to care, I think the walls are a non-harsh red with a slight brownish hue and I do not find the lighting to be harsh and I did not need a blanket wrapped around me while I sat near the door in January (in case wall-color and fluorescent lights matter to you when you buy a ton of meat at a BYOB cop haven in Avondale).  Judge cheap take-out places on food, not on friggin ambiance or your normative perception of a lack thereof.... ugh.Original review: Outstanding.  Absolutely delectable.  I have never tasted better pulled pork in my life.   I would go WAY out of my way for this place... luckily I live about 6 blocks away.  Without a doubt one of the biggest gems in Avondale or Irving Park.During the 15 minutes I waited for my takeout order to finish, No less than 3 CPD cruisers pulled up entirely separate of each other, EACH cop picking up separate orders (for at least 6 people).  The cops didn't even know each other... If this place is good for 3x6=18 cops on a late Saturday afternoon, you know it's something special.  And there were about 20-25 other diners there at the time, so it's not by any stretch just a CPD haven.  Destined to become one of my favorites in the city.  Can't wait to try the ribs... OUTSTANDING, OUTSTANDING, OUTSTANDING."
"GREAT food! Not being from Chicago, I make it a point to try and visit whenever I'm in town. The BBQ pulled pork and mac-and-cheese (baked) is d-lish. One of the best BBQ joints I've been to!"
"I *finally* made it to Smoque after how long?  I will say this - it is the best BBQ that I've had in Chicago, so I will definitely be going back.  I'm happy to finally find a place that makes me want to say that.  Three stars just because I have my BBQ favorites, all of which aren't in Chicago, but Smoque will do the trick when I have a hankering.  Their sauce is a little bit more vinegar based that I'd like (I'm a sweet fan), but that didn't stop me from eating as much of my pulled pork sandwich as I could.  The mac and cheese and cornbread (and my friend's fries) were really good as well.  We go there around 6 on a Wednesday, which happened to be perfect timing - we got a table immediately, but by the time we were leaving, the place was really starting to fill up.  Is it work an hour+ wait on the weekend, maybe not, but you can call in your order for pick-up!"
"The service here was great.  Very friendly staff.  We ordered ribs with cornbread and mac and cheese.  The sides were great - best cornbread, outstanding mac and cheese.  The ribs were really surprisingly bad.  Dry, overcooked, tough.  The pulled pork looked good, I might try it next time....."
"To sum it up...this is the best BBQ I've had in Chicago.  I've had their brisket, pulled pork, texas sausage and every side they have to offer and have not been disappointed yet.  I highly recommend this place for anyone who has been searching for good BBQ in the city of Chicago."
Most definitely the best BBQ I have had in the city. Try the pulled pork and the mac and cheese. You won't regret it.
"I'd been wanting to try this place for a LOOONG time.  I don't know if my expectations were too high or what, but this was a very disappointing meal.I had  the sliced brisket platter with black beans, mac & cheese, and fries.  The black beans were OK.  I found the mac & cheese to be fairly ordinary (didn't like the crumb topping, though).  The fries were good, but I can get better fries at Susie's about a mile away.  Cole slaw was underdressed, which I liked.  Cornbread was forgettable.But I came here for the brisket.  When I sat down, I was pissed that I forgot a knife.  Turned out I didn't need one.  The brisket was cooked to the point where it was almost disintegrating.  I doubt if it was sliced to order; if it was, whoever cut it has great knife skills.  The slices were barely holding together.  I was expecting great, and I got mediocre.  I'm no longer interested in trying out more of the menu.I'd return if I were with others who wanted to go, but I wouldn't suggest this as an option myself.  A massive disappointment."
"Smoque sits somewhere up with Maurice's and Gate's and far above Hecky's, Robinson's, and Smokin' Woody's/Calvins. The only Chicago rival has been Honey 1. The word is out though as the line was nearly outside at 5:30 PM on Friday.Smoque is one of the few BBQ joints north of KC that doesn't hide its meat in liters of sauce. The Baby Backs were very good, but the prize is the St. Louis Rack. The ribs are rubbed well and perfectly cooked. The brisket was buttery and tender.The sides are very good. I recommend the beans and the mac and cheese.Additionally, it is BYO. So bring a little Shiner."
Have been there twice and have gotten the ribs both times. The first time I got a 1/2 slab of st louis & 1/2 baby back. Both are excellent but I preferred the less fatty baby back ribs. It has a great crust! My 18 month old son also LOVES the ribs. Just pull the meat off the bone for him and he goes to town almost jumping out of the high chair because he was sooooo excited!My wife had the chicken and liked it very much.Second trip back I ordered only baby back ribs and they were excellent once again. They are not fall off the bone ribs. That is a good thing as fall off the bone ribs are boiled prior to smoking and then they lose flavor and actually become somewhat mushy....GROSS.reason for 4 stars is they are a bit pricey.
Good southern BBQ but I have had better. The chicken is dry and the ribs were just a meh. Their saving grace is the vinegary BBQ sauce and the Cole slaw.
"I was riding bikes around the northwest side the other day and a man at a bike store recommended Smoque, although I had heard about it before.  The line was out of the door on a Sunday afternoon around 2:30 and stayed that way until we left.  Don't be discouraged though, the line moves pretty quickly.  The mean was awesome-  smoked all day you could tell.  Mac N Cheese side was great and so was the cornbread.  The sweet tea was a lot better than what they try to serve at Wishbone.  Why not 5 stars? They only use the Western North Carolin BBQ sauce for the pulled pork.  I think they should have choices, although I did like the sauce.  I prefer more vinegar based but it was great BBQ and I will go back!"
"Me and a group went here today for my second go around at a great Chicago establishment. And I have to say, Smoque has still got it. Tender, moist meat, delicious sides, and a staff that knows how to keep the customers happy. If I lived closer they would definitely get more of my business."
"Absolutely Amazing.  My boyfriend, his father, and I went here last night after hearing that the one and only Guy Fieri had gone here on his show, DDD.  Every single thing we had was good.  My favorites were the mac-n-cheese, fries, and Brisket.  I am such a big fan of the carmelization of BBQed foods, and this place has it down to a science.  Truly a great BBQ spot.  Do not be scared of a long line it goes really fast, and they work really hard to find you a seat!"
"I read all the reviews and was expecting nothing short of Robert Johnson's devil-owned soul to come slap me in the face when I took a bite.Nonetheless, I was relatively unfazed.  My biggest issue was with the uncomfortable dining environment.  This struck me as a lunch place: cavernous, very harshly lit, bare floors, cafeteria seating, the food counter, all the way down to the self-serve pop machine.  Not like I'm any huge dining snob, I was just expecting something a little more laid-back and condusive to dining.Onto the food.  I had the Pulled Pork Platter w/2 sides, comes with slaw.  The pulled pork was good, but not excellent.  The sauce wasn't what I was expecting.  Slaw was eh... it was like a few sprouts.  The Mac & Cheese would have been great, if they gave you more than a tiny cup of it.  And the fries were really good, the best part of the meal.I do admire their BBQ Manifesto, I'm glad to see a place take a stand on food that, as they say, inspires much debate.  It's also a good addition to the neighborhood.  I'll probably come back to check out another dish, but only because the options are more limited on this side of town.Fat Willy's is still my number-one, hands-down favorite in the city.  They beat out Smoque on flavor, options, portions, taste, and ambience (by a long shot).  I may be spoiled, but other places raised the bar for me and I think Smoque is only going to do well because of its relative isolation."
"Hands Down the best BBQ and brisket place.  The atmosphere is lively and bustling, the staff are friendly, and the food is tasty and not expensive.  They have great hand-cut fries too! That's really hard to come by in Chicagoland."
"The place can't be beat for BBQ in Chicago. Most of the bad reviews seem to come from people who thought it was some nicer sit-down restaurant or people who base it off of their personal idiosyncratic tastes. The brisket is amazing, with the pulled pork not too far behind. The real gem is the Peach Cobbler, I'd eat it every day if I lived nearby."
"Before Smoque I really never went out for BBQ. Now it's the only place I always go back to. I have tried all of the others from wicker park,west loop,and north side. Smoque is still the best."
"i don't think i have ever seen this place with out a line...but to be scared by the line it moves quickly, seating seems to usually be sorta easy too, but i have never eaten there i always take mine to go but buy the time i get home its just as good as eating there im sure...Im from st. louis originally and this is deffinantly in the same vein, apply you own sauce, slightly spicy, not to sweet, goodness...people say the brisket is the best but i just love ribs, so im gonna say the ribs then brisket, haven't had the pulled pork but friends have they said its good, and the new texas sausage is great, just really good flavor all around...remember friends its byob, and nothing goes with bbq better than a nice micro brew stout porter, and/or an ale...Last note is the sides, personally not a big fan of the slaw but the mac n cheese is so good i will make up a word just for...scrumtalasint..."
"This place is O.K. The ribs sure taste great, but the sauce is a little too acid for me. It's good, but not up to my expectations. The BBQ beans are pretty tasty, but because of the sauce they're a little harsh to the stomach as well. Just don't eat here too often and you should be fine. The place is always packed it's ridiculous. Where there's meat there's people I guess."
"Wow, the food here is unbelievable.  If you like Texas beef brisket, you will probably love Smoque BBQ.  The baked beans are insanely good, the cole slaw great as well.  Recently picked up two pounds of brisket, a quart of baked beans, a pint of slaw, and on the way home a loaf of white bread (yeah, good ol' American white bread, the kind that's not good for you, but is a necessity for Texas BBQ!).  The food is so close to what you'd find in Texas, that during dinner I found myself saying 'dang' a lot, and afterwards had this ridiculous urge to go buy a pick-up truck.  Uh, huh.  Y'all gonna like this place."
"Pretty much lives up to the hype. Spare ribs are well-smoked yet still nice and juicy. Best brisket in town bar none. Barbecue chicken is at the top of my wife's list, and she's picky about her chicken. Links are fine ground meat without the fillers found in many versions (which barbecue tradition considers acceptable but Smoque chooses not to go that route anyway). Some of the best fries in town and the rest of the sides are generally delicious. The only knock I can think of is that the side portions other than the fries are small. People complaining about the lack of ambiance apparently don't ""get"" that bare-bones decor is part of the ""barbecue shack"" tradition. You're there to eat great food, not look at pretty walls and curtains and crap."
"Very good BBQ, very good service, great ownership, could use an expansion in restaurant size. Only reason I did not give 5 stars is probably just the size of the place, so SMOQUE really deserves 4.5 stars. I have had pretty much everything off the menu at this point and my favorite so far is the chopped brisket. As for a side, don't miss the Mac'n'Cheese, amazing. Get there early to avoid super long line. Also, BYOB so remember your beer."
"Half Sliced brisket and Half Pulled Pork with coleslaw and fries (sometimes the beans).  The slaw isn't for everyone, I'll give you that, but I like it and I'm writing the review.  The beans are also different than you might expect, but again, that's why I like 'em.My wife is a vegetarian and is always willing to go to Smoque for the salad.  Yes, it's a fairly plain salad, but their vinaigrette dressing is excellent.  She also gets the Mac & Cheese, which is great.  We both love the fries.It's probably not the best BBQ in Chicago, and I'll admit I haven't tried all the places you should probably go first.  But if you're in the 'hood, this is easily one of the best places to go for a meal."
"Where to begin? (To be fair, I love me some Neely's, some Fat Willy's and Memphis BBQ in general; not a huge fan of BBQ from the southeast...unless it is REALLY special).Bad night on the logistical front (computer/register down) so I will not hold that against them. Bus service kept pushing past me to go back and forth (this happens when the line runs thru the center of the room and there is only one set of trash cans...so that was a bit aggravating).I love BBQ...I'm not what you might call an aficionado, but I have eaten a LOT of it in a great many places. I will start with the positive...I have never had better quality in terms of cooking/texture/preparations. 5-star performance on that front.What I will hold against them is their utter inability to BBQ some meat! I had St. Louis and Baby Back ribs; both bland meat. Rub nothing special (too much of something...clove?) on taste but created a nice (carmelized?) crust. Wife had the chicken; exact same opinion.  Mac & cheese could not have set better in the mouth; if only it had tasted as good as it felt.  Slaw vinegar-y, sauce vinegar-y, cornbread an utter diappointment (and I do consider myself a bit of a cornbread expert).  Baked beans...yep, you guessed it...vinegar-y. Onions cooked to a beautiful texture and translucence, but apparently added to the beans because they certainly did nothing to help the flavor; beans were not tender enough. Sauce and everything was beautiful to look at; and I am sure a quite-qualified individual established the recipes/operations. But this is a case of a restauranteur trying to BBQ and not of a BBQ man trying to run a restaurant. I classed it as ""white men can't BBQ,"" no SOUL in this comfort food.The peach cobbler was in a different league altogether, however. My wife is a big cobbler person, and she was ga-ga. I thought the crust, while not your typical cobbler crust, was better than anything I have ever put in my mouth as part of a cobbler, and the peach stuff tasted like fresh peaches (a little tart, not too mushy); cannot ask for much more in this arena (unless it would be to make it cherry cobbler - if they had cherry cobbler to compare to the peach, I would move in...).Overall, a disappointment. I waited for years to get  in there and am pretty well aggravated that I did not instead go to my stand-by, Fat Willy's. While Willy's cornbread is only slightly better than this cornbread, everything else they do is LIGHTYEARS ahead of this feeble  attempt at BBQ."
"Really I don't see what all they hype is about. I've given this place two tries and really not that impressed. I myself dabble in back yard culinary arts but do not consider myself a BBQ wizard. But when I tried Smoque I was not impressed one bit. I can find many other BBQ establishments (since they seem to be sprouting up like a bad case of herpes) that taste way better without the ridiculous line. The brisket is way to dry and tough, the ribs are not bad, but not once again find them to be a little dry. The sauce is nothing impressive. So, 2 stars for Smoque. Not worth the hype and the line."
"The best no nonsense bbq joint in town.  No frills, just great food.  I don't know what else to say."
"It's high time I do a review for this restaurant.  I had only tried brisket one time before ever stepping foot in Smoque and I didn't think too highly of it and didn't understand why anyone liked brisket.  Then one day, I stepped into Smoque and decided to tempt fate and try the brisket that I heard was so good on D.D.D.  After one bite, it was like the heavens opened up and the angels were singing.  The brisket just melted in my mouth and I knew I had a rare find on my hands.  As for the rest of the food, my mother said the beans were the best she had ever had and being a southern cook, that was high praise from mom (they are quite good).  The peach cobbler is fantastic, fries are good, cole slaw was an acquired taste but I have grown to love it.  The only thing I didn't care for was the mac & cheese.Don't believe me ... ask my friends and co-workers.  I introduced some co-workers and it now has a cult following in the office.  It's a special treat!  We will send 2 people out to retrieve the orders as it takes about 20 mins. each way.  We had to limit how many people we ask otherwise we are bringing boxes of food back. One of the managers brings it in as a special thank you for teams working on special projects.  I take my out of town guest here and every time they return, they insist that we go to Smoque.  I'm starting to think they come for Smoque more so than to visit me.  The staff is wonderful!  The parking situation isn't the greatest but if you are anywhere near the L, take the blue line, the Irving Park stop is very close.  A short walk about a block away.  Yes, the lines can be long at times but I have never been disappointed.  It is definitely worth the wait!! My favorite BBQ place ever!"
"Great dry rub!! Definitely great bar-b-que, the flavors are deep in the juicy and tender meat. The beans are also tasty. It is on the smaller side, but we have take it to go and it just as good in the car."
"We drive one hour to get to Smoque and it is so worth it!The brisket is the best I have ever had - including Memphis and Kansas City.  The brisket is smokey flavored and very tender.  Portions are generous, so plan on taking some leftovers home.Small place and sometimes you will wait in line, but it is worth it.  Mac & Cheese is awesome and the fries are the best in the city.  They have even run out of brisket at times.  Plan on arriving between lunch and dinner to avoid the crowds.The owners were passionate about grilling at home, quit their corporate jobs and opened Smoque.  Now, if they would just open another location!"
"If you like mesquite type of rib.. u'll love this place.. the st. louis is better than the babyback.. the mac and cheese is special.. great coleslaw and not to mention.. peach cobbler..but get ready, no pain no gain.. there'll be  a wait.. not recommended when u are hungry!"
"My dad had raved about this place after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives...so off we went on a random Tuesday afternoon.  I was immediately impressed when, upon walking in, the uncle of the owner was right by the cash register to help us decide what to order (since my dad apparently wanted one of everything on the menu, ha!)  I ordered half of a pulled pork with mac and cheese (SO good!) and cornbread, and my dad ordered ribs and a taste of brisket along with some fries and baked beans.  What really sold me, however, was not the delicious food (which is every bit as amazing as everyone says) but the fact that the owner's uncle checked in on us, asked my dad how his ribs and brisket were, and gave him a free new 1/4 slab of ribs when my dad remarked that his were a little dry!  The ""new"" ribs that he was given were much better and we left with full bellies and a smile on our faces.   I rarely even eat meat, and honestly loved this place.  I'll definitely be coming back!"
"Great Barbecue.  Good Sides.The brisket is unlike anything that we are able to get in Milwaukee.  We decided we wanted to go to Smoque, so we made plans to go to the Shedd Aquarium as an excuse to make the drive.Long after we forgot about the fish at the Shedd, we still remember the tasty beef at Smoque.This was totally worth the drive."
"I gave this place 5 stars because 6 or higher isn't an option :) If you love bbq and are in the area, you gotta try it! I live in Texas and grew up in north Alabama so I've had some of the best bbq in the country and the guys at Smoque really do these regional meats right! I had a little of almost all the meats and loved them all! Great job guys!! :)"
"traveling through the midwest and south, i've had a lot of BBQ, but had just about given up finding anything decent in the city. until smoque. TO. DIE. FOR. every single one of their meats was tender, juicy and with their specially-developed sauces, absolutely delicious. the brisket is my personal fave, but i'd slog through the coldest, most blustery chicago winter night for their ribs or pulled pork too. don't miss the mac & cheese or the peach cobbler. my only complaint is you gotta get there early to make sure they don't run out!"
"Last weekend we decided to go to Smoque. Great reviews and all the fuss around it we decided to check it out. Well, parking was a little tough and we were greeted by a very long line outside but when we finally got there we decided it was worth the wait. I had the pulled pork and my other half had ribs he usually likes them a little less chewy but overall the experience was very positive. Next time we'll go during the week to avoid the crowds and for weekends there is always take out."
My Mom was in town for her birthday.  We went to Smoque.  She had the chicken and said it was the BEST that she has ever had.  She spent the rest of the afternoon trying to figure out how to take dinner for 8 on the plane back to Tucson.  We'll have to figure it out in time for her next visit.By far the best BBQ I have ever had.  The brisket is INSANE.  I love the sauce.  The sides are great too.  No wonder they've been selling out of food lately!
"Nice, casual atmosphere.  Order and pay up front then a server delivers your dish--you serve your own drink.  Great ribs, sides were ok.  I prefer Fat Willys"
"Amazing quality, for an amazing price!I love the brisket, cole slaw, and the beans. I could eat the beans alone and be happy!You know how you know when the food is awesome? When you go with your boyfriend and you don't talk for about 15 minutes because you're too engrossed in the deliciousness that is SMOQUE!"
"I love BBQ. Loved Smoque. Knew it was a treat when we saw the 20+ folk line out the door.  The service was fast provided the number of guests, the food was fresh and piping hot, the portion generous.We've sampled the pulled pork, brisket, and St. Louis + baby back ribs; and I would rate them best to good in just that order.The pulled pork was heavenly, brisket was tender, ribs smoky and meaty - but beware, they are a little more fatty then most we've tried in Chicago. The sides were nice, mac and cheese was down home style. Good things: nothing was over-salted or dripping with grease. The tables are very closed to each other, so if you are claustrophobic, get a take-out. It's BYOB with no cork fee, so take advantage! I wish we did. The area is pretty safe though appears a little sketchy, which made for great people watching (we sat by the window and were entertained by a scene of 2 cops arguing with 2 very bizarre looking individuals across the street for 15 mins or so). There is also parking on Sat afternoons! We were lucky to get a spot, but do not fear, street parking plentiful. Prices are very, very reasonable.I'd give the place 5 star if the ribs were less fatty and the brisket/pork was less charred (hello, carcinogens ;) But it was yummy. Great occasional treat."
"I've never eaten here in person, but whenever one of my friends hosts a party, Smoque is the place of choice for informal get-togethers. They have been pretty consistent with the taste and quality, which is alot to say when you have to feed 10-20 people. I am a fan of their dry rub ribs, no so much of their pulled pork, which tastes overcooked. The brisket is nicely done and juicy, and the mac-n-cheese puts the store variety to shame. One of these days I will get around to going there in person, but for now, my ribs come in a pan. Yes, I fight for the left-overs."
Brisket and Pulled Pork very good. Prices not bad.  Service friendly and quick.  I just have a few suggestions.  1. Put ketchup bottles on the tables for your delicious french fries (some of the best in Chicago).2. Improve the coleslaw - could be much better.3. Offer a choice of 2 sauces to cater to different tastes.
"The brisket is the best! And the chili mmmmmmm! long lines though, but worth it ! tried HONKY TONK  in Pilsen and there is a reason why they have a third place trophy!  Smoque BBQ definitely rocks !!! try it you like it!!"
"Pros: Excellent BBQ and side dishes (esp. french fries). Friendly staff, food comes out fast. You order at the counter, and then they call your number. Sodas are self-serve unlimited refills.Cons: Parking sucks during lunchtime--all the neighboring streets except one have NO PARKING between the hours of 8-5. Odd, huh? Parking during evening hours must be much better, though. There's a parking lot behind the restaurant that's free after 5 p.m. Also, there's only one BBQ, and it's a bit strong on the vinegar side."
"Of all the rib joints I've tried, Smoque is far and away the best.  The space is kind of tight, but that's to be expected as they've had a full house every time I've visited.  Now, I just call ahead and do take out.  The service is always fast and the employees friendly."
"Given any day of the week, you can always count on a good line of patrons at Smoque.  Sit in it and wait.  Trust me, it's worth it.The Chicken and sliced brisket are always a fail safe choice.  In fact, you can't say you've truly had smoque bbq without even trying them.  It is rare to see smoked chicken served so juicy and tender at other bbq joints.  Smoque has it down to the science.  I can honestly say that I enjoyed the chicken more than the ribs, sausage and both briskets.One shouldn't under estimate the sliced brisket though.  The passion for real smoked barbecue shines with the sliced brisket.  It will basically melt in your mouth.  The sausage is pretty good, as are the ribs.  They stay to the chicago roots and offer the baby back, as well as the fattier St. Louis style.  Both are great decisions.The side dishes are simply alright.  A little bit small if you ask me.  They are all served in little tinfoil cups, except for the beans and cole slaw, which are served in the classy styro containers. The beans are made with chunks of chopped brisket and are definitely the best option of the few.  For dessert, Smoque offers a peach cobbler served in the same tinfoil cup.  Not bad, just tossed up there on the menu.Obviously with all the amazing reviews, their barbecue will surely make up for any lack of side dishes"
The ribs are the best I've ever had....no BBQ sauce needed although theirs is delicious. I had Mac and cheese and fries as my sides and was not disappointed in either! My boyfriend got the brisket chili as it was a special that day and it was amazing. The line gets long but they move through it pretty fast. I recommend getting take out if you're in a hurry. I can't wait to go back!
"i feel slightly guilty only giving three stars because the food was melt-in-your mouth delicious. here are the reasons i cannot give more stars: 1. the secret is out, waiting in a line out the door on a cold day in chicago is not fun (even if the food is worth it). 2. they did not have any pulled chicken (i felt discriminated for not being a true meat lover) 3. parking was up the street and around the corner (which means i had to drive to get there). 4. the food was extremely rich (almost too much to take)i'm not going to lie, my meal was crazy good... i had a quarter chicken with mac+cheese and i was stoked to see that the coleslaw was made with vinegar. the staff was amazingly friendly.the end."
"I am not a BBQ connoisseur by any means and in fact I rarely crave it, but Smoque has converted me.  Their brisket and pull pork is so delicious...and usually I don't eat either, but don't shy away from the chicken either.  I ordered the chicken last time and I had to pry it away from my husband.  The rub they use is delish and it's perfectly cooked.  The mac and cheese is to die for, but honestly what I really love is their corn bread.  You really can't go wrong with a meal here.  A plate can feed you for 2 meals, in fact it has in my case."
"One of the ""BEST"" BBQ in Chitown!!"
"Call a friend, grab a six pack and hop in line for 20 minutes (it's worth it)."
"Sliced Brisket is the only thing I ever order here, there's no reason to mess with perfection.  The beans are amazing! The cole slaw is delicious.  It gets busy but they do a great job of keeping it organized when they seat you.  If it's nice weather the outdoor seating gets you away from the hub bub inside."
"600+ positive reviews...enough saidThe brisket here was so good for me the first time...I ended up ordering a 5lb tray for the party I went to the following week.  Everything that I've had here has not disappointed.  I don't have any ""southern"" bbq places to compare Smoque's too but in Chicago...this place is number 1.+Byob+Peach Cobbler+Reasonable Prices"
"Went to Smoque again, and keep waiting for it to suck since it's so popular. It does not suck. My hubby got the full slab, 1/2 St. Louis, 1/2 baby back. I always get the pulled pork. Just really good. Simple, nice and smoky. Good balance on the ribs of not TOO falling off the bone, but a nice chew. I like the fries. Some reviewers have called 'em mushy, I really enjoy them, and there's a hint of black pepper on them. Really yum. It still seems like a better system should have been worked out by now as far as the whole place your order/ some guy writes down if you're dining in/ huge line/ yelling a number thing. And we were asked to move down one table mid-bite to accommodate a larger party, which was fine, but still...weird? They gave us free cobbler which was not necessary, but delicious! I would go to this place all the time if not for the monster line. But a Sunday lunch? Worth the wait."
"We ordered the rib sampler (baby back and st louis) and they were both very good.  All the sides were very good as well.  Maybe not the best BBQ i've tasted in my life, but top 5 for sure. The BYO feature is fun, brought a 6pk of goose island to enjoy. The only thing prohibiting this place from getting a 5 is the atmosphere.  I figure a place with food this good could afford to spend a little more on the atmosphere?"
"If you're a fan of simple, no fuss food, and can appreciate pork shoulder or a brisket that has been smoked all day, then this place is DEFINITELY for you. Smoque is a no frills kind of place, and you can tell the moment you walk up (I'd say walk in, but chances of not standing in a line out the door are slim to none). Everything I had there was delicious, including the fries, which I usually try to avoid at places, but standing in line and watching people eat them convinced me otherwise. Smoque is earnest, straightforward Texas BBQ. My only REAL gripe about this place is the wait, but I suppose there is nothing that can be done about it. The product is amazing, and people will wait in line to experience it. I'd like to see outdoor seating maybe? But I guess it would steal from the line space?"
"I am on the fence about this place....on one side I love their bbq sauce! Better than anything I've had so far......But on the other I was disappointed by the mac n cheese and by their menu. Its a very simple menu...Ribs, Chicken, Brisket, and some sides/salads.  The cole slaw was fantastic, didn't seem to have any mayo at all. The cornbread was great, but I wasn't fond of their baked beans. Overall it was an OK experience. Prices are good. Location is not so good."
"Best barbecue I've had in Chicago.  The brisket is transcendental.  Fries are amazing, and the other sides are really really tasty.  I could eat this two or three times a week if I lived closer (and had arteries that could handle it).  I highly recommend Smoque."
So I've been dying to try this place forever and last night I finally got my wish! I had the sliced brisket sandwich with mac n' cheese.....my friend got the ribs with mac n' cheese & fries. Overall....yummy for my tummy.....but was a little disappointed that the brisket wasn't really juicy....I am a sauce fan and while I don't want the meat to be swimming in it.....I did have to use all of my extra sauce and then steal my friends to use as well....boo :(  Mac n' Cheese was awesome creamy and deeee-lish! Fries got the thumbs up as well......I will be back!!
"this place seems to be really busy. i get it. it looks really really good online. when my boyfriend and i got there, being the noobs we were to the place, we were a little confused to how the place works. it was a little more pricey than i wanted for the food that i actually received. it looks SO much bigger on their website. my plating seemed smaller than expected. they food was pretty good though. my cornbread took longer than the rest of the food and by the time i had gotten it, i was almost done with my plate. the mac and cheese was decent and my brisket could have been more moist. there could be a possibility that i'll be back, but only if i have the dying urge to have bbq or just have a craving."
Smoque was very good.  BYOB. But great food.
Ok...I'll give it to them...they have a great pulled pork sammy but I have one problem. You get this amazing sandwich with a side for about one million dollars. It's the size of a White Castle slidder.
Walking distance from my house and you can BYOB.  Great BBQ.
"As a Native of Austin, Texas, and granddaughter of a Texas Cattle Rancher, I shed a tear following the my first bite into a Smoque BBQ sandwich.  It was love at first bite.  The love fest continued with the mac & cheese, fries, cole slaw, chili and cobbler.  Going here always reminds me of home."
best pulled pork in chicago
"Brisket, yummy.  Ribs, yummy.  Mac n cheese, pulled pork, cole slaw...everything I've tried was yummy yummy yummy!  And byob...yippee!  Regarding bang for your buck, Smoque is fantastic."
Best BBQ in town!!!!I love this place and hate that everyone now knows about it.
Has been a favorite of ours ever since it opened.  The very best brisqet sand around.
Awesome sides at this place!  Fantastic cole slaw and probably the best mac & cheese in Chicago.  My only complaint was I wish the sides were bigger!  The meat was just perfect.  Great sauce and the meat itself was nice & moist.  They also have really great trays to put your food on !  Love that !
"I think Smoque is the best BBQ in Chicago.  We tried the Ribs (Baby Back and St. Louis) Pulled Pork, Briskett, Beans, Fries, and Cole Slaw.  Loved the Baby Back Ribs, didn't care for the St. Louis Style.  Loved the briskett, fries were good, beans were good, and the cole slaw was not good.  Great sauce and amazing flavor on the meat.  Went between meals around 2:30 and only had a few in front of us in line."
"Rib fan here. Give me a bib and let me work! This place is in my hood and it is quite the find. Off the recommendation of my sister I gave it a shot. Ever seen the episode of Seinfeld with the Soup Nazi? Well this place is nothing like that but you will feel the pressure of the line of people behind you antsy to order, so when it is your turn to order make sure your ready. Great eating experience though I am not a fan of cafeteria style dining so for that I cannot give it a  star. but let me tell you the food is not to found elsewhere in Chicago. Dry rub smoked bbq is hard to find in the city. It has much more tang and zip than traditional wet ribs and it is not sweet and sticky either. The sides are also great. Beans and fries compliment the smoked pork like butter to toast. Me and wifey have been here numerous times and it has not yet disappointed. Look to the St. Louis cut over the baby back for a healthier slab. Trust the food will not disappoint."
"Every time I order from there, I'm very satisfied. The ribs are some of the best I've had. The beef brisket is heavenly. The fries are cut fresh and the cole slaw very fresh. I also recommend the corn bread and to top it off, try the peach cobbler. Its delicious!  I'm lucky this place is one mile from my place."
this is probably the sexiest tasting b-b-q i've tasted.  i haven't gotten my panties in a bunch over food in such a long time.  the pulled pork was amazing.  the mac-n-cheese made my mouth explode.  i bragged to my friends through the day of my feat of smoque.  i would be a happy fattie if i could come here at least once a week.
"I think I would be an idiot if I said their BBQ wasn't that good. It's good, we all know this. Could the experience be better? Hell yes....if I rated this place 3 stars, I would be adminiting that their BBQ is just OK, which it isnt. It's better than OK. 4 stars means I'm a fan... but is waiting in a long-ass line, lining up with the other sardines for your food, grabbing your prison platter of BBQ and sqautting at a small table all worth it? Some people may say yes, depending on the 'Que. Personally, I don't think it's worth all of the fuss. Next time I visit, I will be ordering to go!"
"This place will probably always have a line.  I'm not sure where else you can get this Texas style bbq in the city.  We ordered the 1/2 baby back ribs and 1/2 St. Louis ribs with the cole slaw and 2 sides in which we chose the baked beans and the mac and cheese.  We also ordered a snack size of the chopped pork.  The meat is tender, but it didn't fall off the bone.  There are 2 sauce options one that is vinegar based and one that is ketchup based.  Both had a good tang, but disappointingly no spicy!  I love how the baked beans had some chopped up meat in there as well.  I don't usually care for mac and cheese, but I liked it here.  The cole slaw emphasized the vinegar flavor in the sauce and was hoping it would be more different.  It felt more like a salad than cole slaw.  The prices are average from other rib joints.  I may just come here to order the ribs again and just get sauce elsewhere...."
"Awesome BBQ!  Ribs are amazing, fries are great, good slaw/chili.  The line out the door says it all.  Definitely the best BBQ in Chicago."
"The pulled pork is great. So is the sausage. Tender and tasty. The platters win over the sammies, because you get TWO sides instead of one. The sides are great. Mac and cheese and peach cobbler are at the top of the list. You get a ton of fries if you pick that one, so maybe plan to share that side. The cole slaw is really good- sweet and tangy but not creamy. Don't forget to BYOB if that's your thang. And don't forget to come at an off time, before the dinner rush. But even if you find yourself in a crowd - this place is run quite efficiently."
Picked up a couple brisket sandwiches for dinner last night...wow...amazing!!...took only 20 min from order to pick up and they people are just great...which makes the whole experience that much better
"The line was longer than the number of idiots who follow Kim Kardashian on Twitter.  However, the food at Smoque is very damn good.  I must start with a major disclaimer.  The baby back ribs were an epic FAIL!!  They did not fall off the bone.  The meat was tough and difficult to pull off. Also, the ribs were very boney.  The meat was limited.  I have had better ribs at Portillo's and Fridays.  I was not a big fan of the BBQ sauce.  I prefer something tangy and sweet.  The sauce is flat and spicy.  It does not make you want to lick your fingers.  NOW lets talk about what is excellent.  The chopped brisket sandwich is beyond belief.  The meat is very tender and flavorful.  The sandwich is huge and the bread is very soft and melts in your mouth.  You must must must try the fries.  These are one of the best in Chicago.  I fully understand why the lines were so long.  Also, the mac and cheese is average.  I did not hate it but I also did not love it."
"This is how barbecue should be.  A great rub, a great sauce, great meat, and great sides.  I think the St. Louis style is their best one.  Very meaty.  They don't fall off the bone, but to me, they're not supposed to fall off the bone.  That's a loser in the cookoffs to have the ribs fall off the bone.  The standout sides to me are the fries and the cobbler.  I always get corn bread instead of coleslaw, but I never seem to get to it.  I always find it more important to eat the other stuff.  One of my friends said they hit the baked beans out of the park, also.  There can be a wait during prime hours, so I either go a little early or a little late."
"After my girlfriend saw Smoque on DDD, we basically craved ribs for the whole of last week. We eventually made it to Smoque on Friday, and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. We ended up getting the St. Louis ribs and also a separate order of brisket. Maybe it's what I like about ribs, but I found the ribs to be slightly dry, and the brisket a bit too tough. Maybe I'm just being harsh, but I like my ribs to fall off the bone. The sides were similarly disappointing. The mac n' cheese and slaw was blah and the cornbread similarly dry. The only good thing was probably the beans which were quite delicious. I also tasted some of the fries which I loved but only wish I ordered. The service was quick and friendly, it's only too bad that there are so many people I feel like I have to leave right after eating. Overall, it was a good experience, but nothing to brag about."
"overall, ive had better, this place is a bit overrated, its overly hyped, its popular because one man from food network decides to stop by and make the name big. overall its not that great. if you want good bbq, go to smokin woodys on lincoln."
"This place was awesome!!  After reading all the reviews, we took the kids and had a great meal.  The Mac and Cheese is wonderful, the brisket was great both shredded and sliced.   It was crowded on a Saturday night but only had to wait a few minutes!  Would recommend this place anyday!"
"I was out shopping on the 18th in the 1987 Sprint, and I had to go to a grocery store to get a majority of the items. To minimize the possibility of impulse buying, I decided to eat something before then. I was motoring east on Irving Park Rd. and decided to give this venue a shot.The word here is that five barbeque-loving guys decided to pool their resources and open a 'southern-style' B-B-Q restaurant in an under-served neighborhood. I believe most of you already know about my preference to avoid pork, which generally significantly reduces my options at B-B-Q joints. But I was able to order Smoque's chopped brisket sandwich with cole slaw and brisket chili (Wednesday's special side dish) [$8.95]. Soft drinks (Coca-Cola products) are $1.25. I was here at 3:10 pm. There was no queue out the door, and lots of seating choices inside.The brisket was good. It needed the additional B-B-Q sauce (a sweet sauce - provided) to enhance it. I also thought that it seemed to get cold around the edges of the bun. The cole slaw is the vinegar-based kind, which is not my favorite, but it was fresh, and I finished it all anyway. The brisket chili was quite good. It had a meaty flavor, even before I scooped up the shredded beef which had fallen out of my sandwich and tossed that into it. Every day, there is one custom side dish. If this is available when you visit here, you should opt for it.I am giving Smoque a four-star rating because the food is quality, its prices are average, and it successfully conveys the atmosphere of a communal dining room, which is something you infrequently glimpse in metropolitan Chicago.Transit options: This is an intermodal venue. There are many ways to get here. I'll change it up this time by telling you something significant if you decide to drive here. Because Smoque is so close to the Union Pacific Northwest line, the Irving Park Blue Line ""L"" station, and the Kennedy Expressway; but is in a residential neighborhood; there are parking restrictions on Grace St. [one way westbound], and Keystone Ave. [one way northbound] Smoque's own parking lot is only six spaces. You want to approach Smoque from the northwest; either on Irving Park Rd., or off the Kennedy at Keeler. The avenue you want to wind up on is _Avondale Ave._ It is the diagonal street on the south side of the U.P. railroad tracks. _It is one way southeastbound._ After 8:00 am, there are no parking restrictions on Avondale. Cram your vehicle into any spot you can find. Then, you'll face a one-to-two block walk. Lest you perceive I am making a fuss about this; Smoque's own pamphlet illustrates the parking situation.Lucidly, transit is overwhelmingly available. The route #53 Pulaski bus stops in front of the venue. The Irving Park Blue Line ""L"" station has an auxiliary exit at Pulaski. (A 1 1/2 block walk.) Route #80 and #X80 Irving Park buses are two blocks north. The terminus of the route #54A North Cicero bus [pm rush hours only] is three blocks northwest. Even the U.P. has a train station here {for you reverse commuters entering the city on the Metra $5.00 Weekend Pass}. But make sure you don't visit here on Monday. (It is closed.)"
"I certainly wish there were half-stars. I took an adventure and went to Smoque, which is walking distance from the Blue line station (Irving Park). I saw the reviews for this place on Cheque Please! and they raved about this place being the best BBQ in the midwest.What impressed me most was the smell and the size of the place - not recommended for large groups during peak hours and very difficult, but doable for families with kids. The limited choices on the menu also told me that they took time into preparing these few things.We ordered the St. Louis ribs with 2 sides and the Half-Half Sandwich. Perhaps it was when we went (late afternoon), but the brisket (chopped only) was dry and the ribs was not as tender. The sides (fries, BBQ beans and Mac and Cheese) was good, but I can't distinguish between gourmet Mac and Cheese and Kraft's.I'm giving it a 3 star because of the potential and because of the home-style cooking (as opposed to pre-processed stuff). I'm hoping on my second visit, the food will be better. The pulled pork was good though."
"After several visits to Smoque, I've decided that a review needed to be concocted.  Am I going to tell you to not believe the hype?  To stop wasting your time waiting in line for an hour to get a big pile of brisket?  I'm afraid not.  However, I do have some fundamental issues to address in terms of Smoque's food, identity, authenticity and ambiance.  Let's get down to brass tacks.  I mean, after several visits, i've tried a large variety of things on the menu.  Brisket, links, pulled pork, ribs, and coleslaw.  I wouldn't dare say that any of these items are horrendous or poorly prepared.  Actually, the brisket is quite tasty, albeit incredulously rich.  The ribs and links were also pretty tasty.  Nonetheless, I really have failed to have my mind blown as many reviewers on yelp have.  Like I said, I would consider all of their smoked meats good, but nothing special.  As for the sides, I will say the mac is delicious.  So identity and authenticity?  Yeah, i've got a major bone to pick (no pun intended) with Smoque's whole business plan.  I don't know about yourself, but Barbecue to me is the embodiment of cultural identities throughout America.  It is localized and unique to each state, town, neighborhood and family.  It is something that tells a story and encapsulates a particular history and identity of many people(s).  Call me crazy, but i'm just not getting that sort of atmosphere out of Smoque.  To me, it is a truly Anglicized version of ""barbecue.""  I mean, I really feel like the place and the food is very much contrived.  From the perfect little macaroni tins to the campy metal plate that you're served on, this place is on it's way to becoming Famous Dave's and propped up in every strip mall in Schaumberg.  It's not that the food is bad, but it's the homogenizing of barbecue into one spot.  Don't get me wrong, you can get Carolina style in Chicago.  Except that the owner was originally born in South Carolina, they moved to Chicago and brought all of their recipes and traditions with them.  You see where i'm going?  Texas, St. Louis, Chicago, and Carolina styles all under one roof?  It's just not right like it should be.  The atmosphere is also very much contrived.  It's something between a poorly planned lunch room cafeteria and a Chili's.  The wanna-be 'down-home' charm of rickety tables and too-close for comfort rib sucking is lost on me in a sea of table Nazi's demanding where you sit, excruciatingly blaring audibility and an overall frenzied environment.  It always seems like nobody really knows what's going on and it's not uncommon for someone to be moving tables back and forth throughout the restaurant while you're eating.  As well, it's nice that the owner walks around checking on his customers, but I am left to wonder: Is he strolling the restaurant to check on customers or is he just hoping someone still recognizes him from chillin' with TGIF-Friday's-Sling' Guy Fieri from the Food Network?  Burn.  What can I say?  I'm a bbq purist.  With that being said, i've had better food, authenticity, atmosphere both here in Chicago and elsewhere throughout this Barbecue-laden country."
I have hesitated to review these guys because they are already impossible to get into. We tend to order carry out ribs for consumption at home. Been a fan since the opened. What made me write this review is that I think they are actually getting better with age. No small feat. Keep up the good work!
"Best. Period. Even if you're calling for take out, on summer weekends plan to call 2 hours ahead."
"So in the year+ since my original review, I've been back at least once a month.  I was never a big fan of brisket, but it's one of my favorite things here.  Moist, tender, and the right amount of smoke.  The beans are awesome, too."
"I agree with all the high reviews of Smoque's meats, mac&cheese and slaw...but, come on! Isn't anybody eating their baked beans? They are absolutely the BEST beans anywhere. Yes, all the food is incredible, but their beans are off-the-chart! Be sure to order some. I guarantee you'll be thanking me. Enjoy!"
Best BBQ I have had in the city.  Great chopped brisket and pulled pork.  I like that it is BYOB.  Ribs and sides are decent.
"OMG! This place is AWESOME!!! I actually don't like BBQ or Ribs but this place makes me love it all. They have the best texas brisket I've ever had, pulled pork is tasty, and the ribs...just about the best thing I've ever had. The sides are great...actually you'll get upset that you can't eat more of it. Corn Bread..yes, Mac and Cheese...yes, and my all time favorite...peach cobbler. The line is long but totally worth it. And the staff is so nice...very friendly."
"Love this place!  Great pulled pork, awesome brisket...and make sure you get a side of mac & cheese and cornbread.  Downsides - long wait and closed on mondays.  We usually call ahead and get it to go.  So good..."
I followed Guy Fieri to this place. He had raved about the brisket. And I wasn't that impressed with it. But the ribs and pulled pork were delicious. And the mac and cheese was really good.We went at an off time (2 pm on a Saturday) and still had to wait a bit for a table. So plan to wait to sit and eat.
"Very impressive.  I think that the sauce just may be the best I've ever had.   I've been around the chicago bbq circuit and have to say that Smoque is the best yet.  I ordered a half slab of baby back's, mac and cheese, and fries.  I like the fact that the coleslaw is made without mayo as well.  They were pretty busy when we went in so I can't blame the staff for being a little rushed and not as personable as they could be.  I'll definitely be back."
"My boyfriend had to try the place before we left. I thought the food was pretty good. I loved the peach cobbler. The meat was pretty good off the ribs. We had two kinds and it came off pretty easy. The tri-tip wasn't that great to me. It needed sauce. I'm not a big BBQ fan, but saw tasted it so at least I've had it. The owner seemed cool. There was a line for food and we decided to get just samples so we could try as much as we could."
"5/5 brisket - try the sauce with added sweet jalepenos!  5/5 French fries, 4/5 Mac and cheese, 5/5 cole slaw.  sadly no Dr. Pepper...   Big time BBQ in a smallish setting.   Worth it!!"
"We came after hearing about Smoque for months. I had the smoked brisket and ribs.  The brisket was very good and the ribs were well flavored but did not fall off the bone, which is the way I prefer them. Overall of Smoque is a good value and worth trying but it didn't live up to all the high praise I had heard about it."
This place is ridiculously good.  The brisket is the best I've ever had.  Everyone I've ever taken here (about 10 people) have loved this place to death.  I had some family from out of state come in and they loved the place so much that after we had finished eating they ordered another meal to take home!
"Their food is very good, parking is typically tough around there during meal times, and it's pretty expensive, probably over $20-30 for 2 people to eat depending what you order. Definitely worth a try though (don't miss the mac and cheese, it's the best I've ever had)."
"Go on a weekday around 2 and you won't have to wait long. The vibe is tremendous, the brisket is to die for, the duo BBQ sauces are yin and yang and the baked beans are magical. Even as a lifelong slaw hater, I discovered they make it with care and emphasize all the right flavors. This place is a Chicago goldmine for those feeling deprived of lip-smacking southern BBQ."
"I'm not going to say that I'm a bbq expert, but I do feel that I've had my fair share....we did have a hog roasting at my high school graduation party after all! Anywho, smoque impressed me quite a bit! I enjoyed the ribs and they were deeelicious! Fall off the bone and melt in your mouth delicious! Not a lot of money for a whole lot of food"
"This place... well, this is why I'm making a profile on Yelp.  When I was growing up in southern California, my dad, after leaving Tennessee, took it as a sacred mission to introduce me and my little brother to proper barbeque.  When we'd go back during the summers, we got barbeque there, but it took years of searching to find good barbeque nearer home.  He finally found a really good barbeque place eventually, about thirty miles from our neighborhood, but it's unfortunately now closed.  So anyway, I take barbeque seriously.  Smoque is probably the best barbeque joint I have ever been to.  Now, the atmosphere isn't absolutely perfect, but it works, and wow, is that food incredible!  Their menu is the basics of barbeque.  So far I've had the brisket and the St. Louis ribs.  Both are spectacular.  I have never had ribs with better texture, they're just cooked perfectly.  The meat is excellently flavored, but it's almost a side act to the sauce.  This rib sauce is the best I've ever tasted, it is absolutely amazing.  The brisket sauce is less striking, but it's busy taking a backseat to the meat.  The brisket is almost falling apart, and can actually take a little work to eat with a fork, but is somehow not overcooked.  It's got a wonderfully slow flavor, and my girlfriend will testify that I sat there just staring off into space as each bite worked its way on through to a perfect smoky aftertaste.  Now, there's the matter of the sides.  They're all incredible.  I'd like it if the place had potato salad, but I would be forced to take another couple minutes to decide on my sides each time if it did.  The owner, who is constantly circulating, making sure everyone's doing well, stops to talk to customers constantly, and when he stopped by our table mentioned that they're working on a potato salad.  With as much work as they've clearly put into the other sides, I'm very much looking forward to it, since I'll be going back regularly.  The coleslaw is pitch perfect, tangy rather than sweet, and very simple.  It cuts the flavor of the meat just right.  Every so often I'd swing over to the coleslaw for a moment, and going back to the meat was like taking a first bite all over again, and that's something you'll probably appreciate as much as I did.  The mac and cheese is great, crusted with bread crumbs and dense cheese sauce, the cornbread is excellent, and the fries are simple quality, but if you pass up the ridiculously wonderful cobbler for them you'll regret it.  Get the cobbler.  The baked beans are unusual, with an almost apple flavor and chunks of onion, but definitely good.  They're probably not for everyone, but I liked them a lot.  Oh, and get a sausage on the side.  They ship it in from Texas, and it's worth it.  The location is a little inconvenient, but it's well worth it.  The place could use a better sign for anyone coming from the north.  Even if you don't see it, just make a right on the first little street that isn't right up against the freeway embankment.  Still, the place is only a couple years old, the prices are reasonable, the service is good, and I'm looking forward to filling in any gaps when I go back yet again."
"This place is so good, I've had the brisket sandwich before but wanted something healthier when I went there today. Instead, I got the small salad (which was huge) with chicken in it. It was really good, and had lots of chicken, sunflower seeds, sun dried tomato, and cucumber. I got BBQ sauce for the chicken and used a teeny bit of the ranch, and it was perfect! I had to hold myself back from ordering cornbread, it's probably awesome though. I've had the mac n' cheese before, and it's really good as well. They were super quick and everyone was smiling and friendly."
"On Valentine's day at 3, this place is packed.    I like the concept of forcing people to place their order before they choose their seat as it cuts down on potential issues.    I thought the ribs were ok, I found the sauce to be a little too peppery and not my thing.    The brisket on the other hand was moist, tasty, unbelievable good.    Brisket is a hard thing to master but they have.    The sides were good.   The peach cobbler was terrific but as far as bbq joints go, this is not a destination place for me.    I hate to say it but Kenny makes a better rib"
"Not impressed.. heard rave reviews from co-workers and even saw a blurb about it on TV. But honestly didn't have anything that was ""great"" just kinda OK... not a fan of the runny BBQ sauce. Tried the pulled pork and the brisket.. brisket was mushy and fatty.. pork was stringy and tough.. The Brisket Chili was decent, although it was near boiling when we got it, couldn't eat it until almost the end of our meal.. Also the ""shot glass"" size Mac n Cheese was tasty, but seems like they could have had served a slightly larger portion.  Maybe it was a bad night for Smoque, but I've definitely had better BBQ elsewhere.."
"These are the type of ribs, you just don't fuck with!"
"Best BBQ in Chicago. Not even a question. LIGHT YEARS ahead of the competition. Pulled pork is insanely good. So is the beef brisket. Even the cole slaw is good and I usually hate cole slaw. Theirs is not creamy cole slaw, it's more of a fresh/vinaigrette type slaw and it is delicious. The cornbread is good too, and it's BYOB. There is almost always a line out the door, but it's well worth the wait. Closed on Mondays."
"Had the St. Louis Ribs.  Awesome.  Meat, smoky and tasty.   I wish we had a place like this in Toronto.  The mac and cheese was pretty good too!"
"I can't believe how many times I have been to Smoque but I haven't yet written a review.  Normally this is the type of place I would write-up.  I think this is the best pulled pork in the city.  It's the best I've had so far.  My favorite order is the pulled pork meal with sides of corn bread and peach cobbler.   The price is as good as the taste.  For the same price, you get more food with this meal than with Smoque's competitors.  The only downside to Smoque is the wait.  The line is almost always to the door.  Because of this, I call in my order and pick it up.  You can go to the front of the line to pick up and pay for carry out.  It's much easier that way.  If you want some good pulled pork, Smoque should definitely be on your list."
"best bbq in chicago. great ribs, brisket, and sides. The baked beans with brisket are incredible. Closets thing to KC bbq in chitown. Usually busy, very busy, and it's BYOB. highly recommended."
"I give the chopped brisket at Smoque - Five Stars. I usually go for pulled pork when it comes to BBQ, even chicken, but the Chopped Brisket at Smoque is nicely seasoned, charred, and lean. The sauce is thin and vinegary and adds to the flavor. The brisket is so good they put it in their baked beans, which are smokey and delicious.This place can get busy, so get it to go. It's worth the wait."
"No Bbq place in all of Chicago can stand up to this place! The Ribs here are the best I ever had.Im serious! I had Bbq in Memphis,And Texarkana,ak.And they dont even come close to Smoque.The rub that they use is the best! You dont even need Bbq sauce.They are that good without it! The brisket is super tender,and cooked to perfection! The mac and cheese is really good.The beans are great! And my god,The slaw is the best around.For like 8 to 13 bucks each,You can eat like a king! you get half a slab of ribs,and two sides,and slaw for like ten bucks.I usually add a side of brisket for like an extra 3 bucks.And you get your moneys worth! I can talk forever about this place.The usually have a long line.But if you go later in the evening,you can get lucky and get a table without having a ton of people around you.But I usually just call it in and take it home.    This place is worth a long drive,worth a long line.Im telling you,THE BEST IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO.If you dont believe me,ASK JESUS! LOL"
"AWESOME.  The best BBQ I've ever had, hands down.  I'll admit I was frustrated after leaving here empty handed (and stomached) the first two times I tried to eat here, as the line was either too long or they ran out of beef brisket.  To be fair, Smoque had just been featured on the Food Network so there was a lot of built up hype.  I gave it one more shot, and wow was it worth it!  I usually go with the chopped brisket (smoky, moist, and tender, with those great little bits of blackened beef evenly dispersed throughout).  The BBQ sauce (Memphis style I believe) has great flavor and a nice acidic kick from the higher vinegar content.  Wanna get your hands dirty?  Go with the St. Louis ribs.  They're, moist, tender and meaty.  Solid mac & cheese and fresh cut fries.  Top that all off with BYOB and you can't go wrong."
"AWESOME! AWESOME! Just go! Order one of everything and you won't be disappointed. If you see the owner, who is a taller thinner guy say hello and ask any questions you have about the menu, he's a wealth of knowledge and very friendly."
"Winner of the 2007 EAT OUT Award. Moist, pink meat in abundance. Tastes and smells here are positively sensual. As their logo says, ""low and slow."""
Best BBQ spot in Irving Park. The pulled pork sandwich was awesome. Plenty of seating but if you get there late that won't make a difference. I've been there a few times and the place is so busy the line is almost out the door. You know it's a good place when cops eat there :)
"my friend and i found our way to smoque one night and we were both greeted with about 10lbs of meat. so juicy, so good. sauce is just right."
Smoque is awesome. One of the best bbq restaurants in the city. It is usually a long line out the door when they are busy. The brisket is out of this world.
"I've only had the brisket, and honestly, I have no interested in trying anything else.  It is DIVINE.  I do recommend going on weeknights, and, while BYOB is great, the dining area is a shame.    What reviewer mentioned prison cafeteria?  I second that emotion.  Congrats to the owners!"
"We ordered carry-out and I thought it was definitely worth the trip to Pulaski. Chicago has some great bbq spots and this is definitely one of the good ones. Actually, the fries were delicious too and the mac and cheese. We all had the pulled pork and although the bbq sauce they gave us was good with it--the pork itself is good on its own too! I would recommend trying it for sure."
"It's all about the briskets, slaw, beans AND PEACH COBBLER! Crazy lines though sometimes. It's worth it."
Fantastic and inexpensive.
little out of the way but well worth the drive and wait.  Hands down the best brisket and ribs in the city....the sides leave a little to be desired but why to to a BBQ place for sides?
Okay. Not a big fan of BBQ but a buddy of mine is. He was raving about this joint and we finally went a couple weeks ago. This place is a bit of a hike from the downtown northside area but worth it. I recommend driving there. Public transportation will take you forever. The place itself is not very big and there was already a line out the door at 6pm but the line does move pretty quick. I do like you order and pay first at the counter then they seat you. It is not fast food style but not a traditional sit down where they come to your table and take your order. I think this turns the tables over faster. I got the half and half which is a half pulled pork and half brisket. The brisket you have a choice of chopped or sliced. I wish I would have gotten the whole sandwich chopped brisket because it was really good. The pulled pork was good too but not as impressive as the brisket. I also go the recommended BBQ baked beans and they were really good. The slaw was good too. Next time I think I will get the platter which is not a sandwich so I can make room for the peach cobbler or corn bread. Reasonably priced too. Will definitely go again. Oh this place is BYOB so in case you want to bring your own beer or wine.
"I had my hopes up very high I guess after seeing this joint on Triple D. And I love bbq. My fiance hit this dive up yesterday around 7ish pm & there was a small line one the door, but it moved pretty quickly. The place is pretty snug & is like a cafeteria style with the arrangement. It really looks like a dive.The smell was driving me insane, it smelled amazing. I scanned the menu quickly & decided upon a chopped brisket sandiwch & a half slab of st. louis ribs, my fiance (who didn't know the sandwich was going to be an acutal whole sandwich) did the half and half w/sliced brisket sandwich & pulled pork. We ordered for the sides, 2 drinks, a large macaroni and cheese, a large fry, and a large cole slaw. Total price: $46 dollars. We got seated by one the guys. It was packed inside.  We didn't wait too long for the food which was a good thing. I quickly poured the sauce over the brisket sandwich and took a bite. The brisket itself was alright, I didn't get too much flavor from it, which I was surpised because I thought the guy put like a million spices on it. I did not like the sauce at all. I know this is because I am more partial to sweet sauces more than vinegar based ones. The fries were out of this world I loved them, I think my fiance only had a handful and I had the paperbag (which by the way is a great idea because the bag soaks up the grease). The macaroni and cheese was cheesy and I love the crust on top, it just needed a little bit more salt though. The cole slaw was deliciously tangy and refreshing. The ribs were amazingly juicy, tender, full of flavor, and literally fell off the bone. Pulled pork was alright, wish it had a better kick to it and the Texas sausauge tasted like a polish sausage! The drive for us and the price was not worth it for us unfortunately. in addition, the bus boys made me feel very rushed, they kept eyeing us and asking about taking our trays, it pissed me off & made me uncomfortable, it's not my damn fault the place is small & there's a big line, WTF you want me to do!!! I couldnt enjoy my food because of it even if it did taste ok. Better keep looking for a better bbq place."
"When you have a bite of Smoque brisket in your mouth, it's impossible to imagine that better-tasting food exists anywhere in the world.  The perfect order is: brisket platter with large mac n' cheese (large = 2) and peach cobbler."
Read my lips: SMOKED BRISKET. To die for. Everything is exceptional as well. Look no where else in this city for smoked meats!
"In a word, awesome!  I am a firm believer that a BBQ place should be known equally for its meats and its sides, and both I can assure you were wonderful!  The ribs were fall off the bone, the brisket melted in your mouth, all accompanied by a tangy, sweet BBQ sauce.  For sides we tried the mac & cheese, creamy yet with a delightful crunchy bread crumb topping; baked beans, smokey with bits of bacon; french fries, absolutely to die for; and of course cole slaw that helped break up all that grease in my belly.  Oh, and don't forget the peach cobbler for dessert... almost better than Mom's.  At first I thought that perhaps the mac & cheese side was too small, but after eating everything else it turned out to be just the right size.  Definitely an affordable outing, plus you get enough food to put you in a coma for the rest of the afternoon."
"I love this place.  My wife and I eat here all the time.  This last time I had the chopped brisket sandwich, mac & cheese, and bbq beans.  Everything was great as usual and the mac & cheese is probably the best I have ever had.  The only complaint for me would be the seating and the small portion size on the sides.  Although it is not like I ever leave hungry so I don't know what I am whining about."
"First time visiting. Between the 3 of us we tried ribs, brisket sandwich, and most of the sides. We all enjoyed each part of the meal. Brisket was amazing. Ribs were unreal. Very very crowded but we all agreed to return ( and that includes our 4 yr old who is definitely a ribs kinda girl). I believe it's byob and parking is limited. Hands down a BBQ joint favorite. love that they have small add-ons too.Try the peach cobbler!!!  Best part of the evening is coming home smelling all smokey!!!"
"Went here for the first time and tried the ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  They were all good but I think I like BBQ sauce less tangy and more on the sweet side.  The brisket and pulled pork BBQ sauce had an orange flavor to it which was okay, but again, not my favorite.  The baked beans had the same tangy flavor and the Mac and Cheese was good but not the best I ever had.  The corn bread was really good.  Worth going to for the atmosphere and good food but only once in awhile for me."
"Man-O-Man this place has good BBQ. When you go, please do me a favor and get the ""taste"" portion of as much as you can (its perfectly legal to get brisket, ribs, and pulled pork all on one plate), with the cornbread. Now, do YOURSELF a favor and drink water! the BYOB is nice if you're there to drink, but beer fills me up too much and i couldnt finish all my food. This Place is real cheap- you can get alot more food here so the bang for your buck is fantastic. My only cons: Virtually NO seating and NO decor. the place is made of stacked concrete bricks. Seriously, it looks like (from the outside AND inside) a bathroom you would find at the 9-hole turn of a public golf course that they spray down with a hose. Maybe its on purpose... but the place would make a  KILLING with some investment in nice real estate closer to the city and some decor, or at least a mural on the wall."
"I have definitely had better pulled pork, which is what I ordered. The fries were good, but prices seemed high for basically fast food. I like that it is BYOB, but if you bring a big group, it will probably be hard to get seats. It is also noisy. I'd have to say that this place is average, overall."
"It was fate that brought me here. I saw the place on the food network just a few days ago. Last night I was talking to my professor about it who highly recommended Smoque. She tried to go there this past weekend but the line out the door was crazy and they ran out of brisket!  Now it was cold last Saturday in Chi-town but she talked about it passionately---it being the brisket. Today I was planning on going to Chinatown for dim sum. It ended up that I didn't feel like going through all the traffic and my own mother suggested to get off the next exit and head towards here. Guess what? That was my highlight for today! I had the sliced beef brisket sandwich, french fries, corn bread, and the cole slaw! Needless to say, I will definitely head back!!!! Just thinking about the whole experience is making my mouth water."
This place has some of the best barbecue. Everything that we ordered was really good except for the peach cobbler. Good prices. The weekend is busy and you may have to stand in line for a while but once you're in it will be well worth the wait. Try everything.....
"I came here yesterday, in the mood for barbecue. I read reviews about it and thought since I was nearby it would be a good place to stop by. I picked up a friend and even with the weather the place was really busy-I think there was a large party so it threw off the usual tuesday night place. Anyways, my friend and I ordered-she had already eaten but humored me and ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich (pulled pork and brisket) and I got the platter with 1/2 chopped brisket and 1/2 sliced brisket mac and cheese and corn bread. I have to say I wasn't too impressed with the place. The meat was good enough but I thought it weak sauce-literally. The extra they provided wasn't enough. I thought the portion size was pretty small too-we sat next to a small Asian woman who had two plates in front of her and she almost finished both. Not only was I still hungry but still in the mood for barbecue so I asked my friend if she wanted to go to Smoke daddy. Which we did, flip over to Smoke Daddy's page for a continuation of my adventures in Barbecue"
My gf and i werein Chicago for 3 days this week and Smoque's was a major high light. I had the brisket which was good. She had the ribs which tasted unlike any i had ever had before. You get to taste the meat and how it was cooked with hard wood. It was real BBQ and the best we either had. She wanted to come back the next night but we decided not to. The ribs weren't the whole story i personally loved the brisket chilli the corn bread and would love to have the recipe for the coleslaw. My gf could not stop raving about the mac and cheese. Said it was the best has ever tasted from a restaurant or anyone else. The reason i don't give 5 stars is portion size. They could have been bigger esp the sides. But great BBQ and we will be back and tell everyone to go there.
"The best Texas BBQ outside of Texas. My husband is from Dallas and he LOVES this place. It even got the seal of approval from my mother-in-law....one of the best Texan cooks ever. So go eat there, whether you have had Texas BBQ before or not!"
"Finally got to try the fantastic Smoque and it did not disappoint.  I tried the beef brisket and the Texas sausage and they were both great - not overpowering, just pleasant and tasty.  And the sides, oh man, the sides.  The mac and cheese is excellent - next to Kuma's and Handlebar on my favorites list.  The peach cobbler, slaw and corn muffins are also wonderful.  I doubt you can really get anything bad on the menu.  What's funny is that this place is actually kind of high-end, but it is modeled after more earthy and grubby places with the trays and paper place mats (no plates) and tins of sides.  The only problem is, like most above-average spots, this place gets really busy after 4pm most of the time, especially on the weekends.  I'd recommend going at off times if you can."
"This place is great!  I heard about it on the food channel and had to go check it out for myself.  The people working are extremely friendly and the owner was even walking around making sure everyone was doing good.  I like the fact that they seat you, so you're not fighting for a table because the place is on the small side.  It's definitely not a place to chill and hang out, you pretty much order, sit, eat and done, but it's so worth it!  I had the half of a pulled pork sandwich (perfect size if you don't have a huge appetite), a bag of fries (fresh cut - huge portion and great seasoning), and the cornbread (substituted instead of coleslaw - also cooked to perfection).  I was with several other people who had the brisket, ribs and chicken, and there were no complaints."
"Best way to sum up Smoque for me is that it was a religious experience. Not sure I've ever had BBQ that was so amazing. The Brisket and Pulled Pork are unbelievable. I tried the sauce, but preferred it without any sauce. It's that good. Generally speaking, meat is not a huge part of my diet. But when I do indulge, I always appreciate high quality. This meal was perfection Their smoke flavor and seasoning are incredible. The meat is tender and moist. The Mac and Cheese is wonderful, too. More souffle-like as opposed to creamy. Beans are a bit spicy, but delicious. The Peach Cobbler is to die for. I could have made a meal out of that. What I found kind of cool is that if you look at the menu photography on their website, the food actually looks exactly like that in real life!  Smoque was worth the wait. Can't wait to go back and try the Ribs and Sausage, although I'm not sure I ever want anything but their Pulled Pork. Crowded as hell, but they manage it well.   Highly recommended."
"The best bbq brisket I have ever had, I always get the take-out and my mouth waters on the way home from the intoxicating aroma, I cant get enough of this stuff......."
"I'm not a big BBQ eater but after trying Smoque I'm going to try as many BBQ restaurants in the city that I can.  I got the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich plate which consisted of a pulled pork  and a brisket sandwich.  Both were phenomenal.  The meat was melt in your mouth goodness.  The cornbread was fantastic as well as the baked beans.Overall, very good for the price.  I will definitely be back soon."
"I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.  This is a great place for lunch.  Not so vegetarian friendly but for the carnivores out there this place is heaven.  Delicious BBQ and the best fries in the neighborhood.  I will be back and often.  I recommend the pulled pork sandwich.  Slaw is good too, it's oil based not creamy.  From what I hear everything is great here.   There was no line when I went but I hear sometimes it's out the door.  If only they were BYOB, I'd give em' five stars."
"Probably one of the best lunches I have had in awhile.  I ordered the half & half sandwhich with a side of beans.  This was a perfect menu option for a guy who wants to order one of each.  The brisket and pulled pork were awesome.  They weren't topped off with coleslaw like I have seen in the south but it was offered on the side.  The bread was also a little nicer than I have seen at more traditional places butt I tried not to compare Smoque to the South because as other yelpers seem to have neglected I realized this is a Texas BBQ, not a soul food based place.  We waited in line about 10 minutes to order and once we were near finished eating they weren't the least bit shy about moving us out of our seats.  I enjoyed how they had fountain soda with free refills and didn't appreciate how small the portion sizes were for the majority of their sides like the mac n cheese.  Overall, some great food and cool atmosphere with reasonable prices."
"I have been to Smoque three times, and each time I leave there satisfied, full, and knowing that I'll be back. Hopefully soon, very soon.*sniff* -- Pardon me, that was me smelling my shirt to take in one last smell of the delicious smoky BBQ. The St. Louis ribs are some of the best I've had and I'm pretty sure I could drink the BBQ sauce by the gallon. Do not leave here without ordering a peach cobbler. Let me say that again: Do not leave here without ordering a peach cobbler. Enough said.Its unfortunate that this place gets such good reviews and even such favorable media coverage, because even at 5:30pm the line is out the door. The line moves fast and the table seating is usually pretty quick.Do yourself a favor and go here when you're craving some BBQ but not at the same time I'll be going. Getting in the way of me and my meal at Smoque is serious business. Got it?"
"If you dig vinegar-based BBQ sauce (which I do), then this is the place for you.  Brisket sandwich (widely and positively reviewed) deserves the recognition.  To me, though, you shouldn't skip the ribs, especially the spare ribs.  They have two sauces, and one is technically tomato-based, but even that has a pretty strong hit of vinegar.  I love both sauces.  My only wish is a spicy sauce option, which they don't have.  As an added bonus, they have the best sides of any BBQ joint we've been to.  The coleslaw has no mayo, the mac and cheese is delicious and plenty crusty on top, and the fries are fresh-cut and seasoned well.  Everything is super well executed.  We will be back for sure!"
"Had the chopped brisket sandwhich, cole slaw and baked beans. It was even better than I thought it would be."
"I can't believe anyone would give this place less than five stars. I'm from southern BBQ country and this place has the best pulled pork, Mac n cheese, and coleslaw of any place I've ever been. We carry out at least once a month and have never been disappointed! The peach cobbler is amazing!"
"OK how long has this place been open???I came tonight at 6PM and they were out of brisket already and the ribs were not going to be ready until 8PM. There is no way I am going to wait 2 hours for some food.It seems like they run out of food alot, who manages this place??Sorry that this happened but I will never be back!"
"So , what's not to like?1. The sides aren't as good as the BBQ. So they should work on that."
"I have heard so much good about Smoque from my family & friends.  I tried it the other day & was quite disappointed.  I had the brisket which was dry & burned.  I then sampled my son's pork sandwich & that was much better & moister.  The cole slaw was not very tasty either. The french fries were pretty good, but very greasy.  I had the worst indigestion that day & into the next day.  Okay service & ready when promised, but afraid I won't be going back here."
"Super, great, awesome, that is how I describe it.  I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich.  The BBQ sauce included was great!  Plus a $4 add on of St. Louis Style Ribs.  The ribs were smoked perfectly, and included another BBQ sauce...mmmm....good stuff!  The cornbread wasn't anything to write home about, but everything else was.Parking during the day is a pain.  The place is busy, even when I went at 11:30 on a Saturday morning.  The sign isn't very visible either."
"Hands down the best BBQ on the north side.  The brisket, pulled pork, grilled chicken, ribs, chili, and cole slaw are all excellent.  It's a little more expensive than you may expect to pay for BBQ (expect to pay $10-14 for a man-sized meal), but it's freaking worth it."
"For what they are, I give them mad props. It's pretty good Memphis style que and gets better each time I go. I've not had the ribs yet, as I always go for the brisket (chopped more so than the sliced). The sauce is awesome, but it's all about the meat. Perfectly slow-and-lowed to melt in your mouth satisfaction. Which isn't easy. Especially with a sinewy brisket. The BYOB factor is key as well, that way you can have a couple beers while waiting in the super friendly line. Very nice. And don't go in a big group or you'll never get seated."
"This place is really good. The meat is very high quality, the sides are excellent, the service was really friendly as well. As far as sides and overall quality, I would say its the best BBQ I've had in Chicago. My one major complaint was the sauce. I wasn't a huge fan, I would have liked to see a couple of varieties, maybe a spicier version."
This place is fantastic and Barry(owner) is a pleasure to talk to.  My wife and I have driven from Plymouth Michigan just to have lunch and then drive home and the trip is worth it!  Brisket is my favorite but everything on the menu is good. Try the mac n cheese.
"consistent and price-conscious meat-oriented barbecue:+ meat is good enough to stand on its own+ friendly and attentive staff and owner+ conveniently located off blue line+ still relatively inexpensive as barbecue goes- closed monday- sometimes suffers from its own success through food shortageswith all this corn going to subsidized ethanol initiatives, it's getting harder to get good beef at a reasonable price.  nevertheless, and despite a few recent forgivable inconsistencies*, smoque has managed to deliver a quality product while still maintaining value to the customer.  the store keeps no inventory, and hence, their capacity for the day is their smokers' capacity.  fresh food at a reasonable price means long lines and when the food's out, it's out--this used to be a major issue, but has become more reasonable in recent months.i'm one of these morons that eschews barbecue sauce. i was so pleased to learn that smoque not only offered their meat without sauce, but that their meaty offering was actually good enough to stand on its own legs without sauce (contrast with tango sur or gibson's). the pork and the brisket are doubtless the items of interest here.  quite frankly, they're the only items of interest at any good barbecue joint.  back ribs are also quite tasty, but aren't as good a value for your money as the boneless meats.  * i've had food from smoque about 20 times since it's opened, which has been consistently good.  the few times it's fallen off i can treat as anomalies and hopefully not a sign of things going south."
"This is BBQ, real BBQ. Go right for the pulled pork; it'll make you weep with joy. This place stands up to anything I've had in the South, and my standards for BBQ are HIGH. I know this is old news, but if you're just hearing about Smoque, don't wait, just go."
I'm now a vegetarian so I will no longer enjoy their absolutely yummylicious pulled pork sandwich.. really go try it because it is soooooooooooooooo good! I need to think of new words for delicious .. anywho their mac and cheese is also good. Expect to wait for a table if you go at night though. They also have good desserts.
"This is a neighborhood gem. Best pulled pork and tender beef brisket. The mac and cheese, I wish the little round cup it comes in was bigger as it's deliciously cheesy. The platter is the best choice since you get beans, slaw, mac 'n cheese and choice of meat and very full by the time you're done."
"After seeing this place featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, was interested to see what kind of 'que this place served up. The disgusting pigs we are, we went here to check it out after already eating dinner (we were in the area!). The line to order was a mile-long and I almost wanted to leave, but the tantilizing aroma of smokiness clung to me. After a 20minute wait, we went with the sliced brisket and half rack of baby back/half rack of St Louis ribs with fries and beans. It was a tough ride home given how delish everything smelled despite a full stomach. When we finally got back, the food was fantastic. The brisket was awesomely tender and the ribs were soft and juicy. The bbq sauce was also very tasty. I ain't no southern gal but this place done BBQ right. A must try."
"We LOVE Smoque.  Cheap, casual and delicious - what's not to love?  Hard to decide what to choose because everything is good and that goes for meats and sides!  And they have sweet tea!  A great little place that you should try, but keep it to yourself - I hated waiting in line outside!!!"
"I'm rather shocked at how overrated this place is. Tried it one Saturday before it got crowded and was not pleased. The pulled pork was good. The BBQ-sauce (the one made with Coca-Cola) was just not there. Briscuit was tough and not much flavor. Mac and cheese was a joke and the cole-slaw was bad. Why people wait outside in line to eat here is beyond me. Does anyone know a good, reasonably priced bbq place is in the city? And yes I will drive to the South Side."
"Their catering service is a mess.  We used to call the day before to order takeout ribs for small family parties. Now they make you go through catering. I called on Thursday morning for a Saturday family dinner and they said they were at capacity.  That's not good business.  Will never return nor recommend Smoque in the future.  Too bad. Their ribs are pretty good.  BTW, called Lillie's Q right after. Very accomondating and their ribs are right up there.  Sorry Smoque. You got too big for your britches!"
"Finally tried Smoque because of the all the hype. I got here early so while it was crowded, the line wasn't astronomical yet. While the seating arrangement was a little too cozy for my taste, they are very nice and have an efficient process of getting you seated when eating in. Didn't want to spend more than $10 so I went with the pulled pork sandwich. The pork literally melts in your mouth. The coleslaw is obviously homemade and very tasty, so I slapped some on the sandwich. As far as the meat itself, these guys know their stuff. As far as the sauce, it 's vinegar based and thin, not really my style. Don't get me wrong it was good, but it didn't exactly have my taste buds dancing. Ever since tasting Sandy's sauce at Hog Wild, nothing compares. The fresh cut fries are good, salty, and plentiful. My main beef with this place is that if you want to have anything rib -like, it'll hit you up for close to $20. Considering the fact this seems to have become a staple of Chicago BBQ, in my opinion the menu should be a little more extensive. Would love to see pork tenderloin or rib tips on the menu as I'm sure they would be excellent. Can't give them four or five stars yet because I wasn't wowed, but I will definitely update when I try the ribs."
"I have gone to Smoque since the week it opened and have tried everything on this menu several times (well, except the salad).  Smoque serves both baby back and St Louis style ribs, but, they are on a mission to convert Chicagoans to St Louis style.  I've got to say, they're doing a good job.  Also, I can't say enough good things about the brisket and pulled pork.  The sides are delicious and despite consistently eating too much of the bbq, I always save room for the tiny peach cobbler.  The only bad thing is that sometimes they do run out of menu items-- if that happens, just try something else, it's all great!"
"One of the best in Chicago. If you like ribs Q has better. 4.5 stars. They actually cook ribs the proper way by smoking it.  It's the only legit way of making ribs and meats tender and juicy.  You'll know what I mean when you try the boiled ribs that are so prevalent around town. Yes, Im talking to you Twin Anchors."
"Oh my god.  Everything we had here was outstanding.  We had the pulled pork, which was moist and tender and served on a perfect roll, as well as a taste of ribs, cornbread, fries and beans - all delicious.  There was a line out the door and we waited about 30 mins to order our food but it was well worth it.  Staff was friendly and accommodating."
the hype doesn't do justice. a perfect meal!
I've been wanting to check out this BBQ joint for awhile and finally went last week.  Being a backyard BBQ smoker and former Texan I had doubts whether they could pull-off similar luscious brisket compared to Rudy's of Austin.  I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly and expedient service.  I ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of mac-n-cheese and absolutely loved the combination of flavors and smoke.  The brisket I ordered sliced and it came tender and juicy with a tangy side of their house BBQ sauce.  The crusted mac-n-cheese was also delicious and I could have definitely used more.  Smoque is by far the best BBQ place I've been to in the city of Chicago.  I can't wait to go back and try the ribs and pulled pork.  I also noticed they now have hot links which are imported from Rudy's in Texas.  Woo Hoo those are tasty spicy sausages!
"You wont' find better smoked brisket in Chicago.  In fact, you won't find better smoked brisket in Illinois, in the USA, or in the whole world.  This place absolutely rocks!  The pulled pork is also as good as it gets.  As for the sides:  Their baked beans are also the bomb.  The mac & cheese is awesome.  The corn bread is not my style and neither is the peach cobbler.  The sweet tea is great.  I love this place, stop by whenever I'm in town, and also make special trips just to dine there."
DEE-LEE-CIOUS!!!!!I had no idea I can consume so much brisket. And I already had a pretty good idea I can consume a lot of brisket.Go. Fear no line. Eat lots of meat. Leave happy.
Holy COW. It's got to be since the brisket sandwiches are heavenly. Full of flavor and juicy enough that you don't need a drink to wash it down with. Juicy enough that you don't need any extra sauce. The sauce is vinegar based. I personally think it would be a little bit better if it had less vinegar but I think I will live. With a big smile on my face. The Mac & Cheese is awesome. Mind blowing. It's also tasty. I don't live too far from this joint and I have had it only a couple times. But I will be a regular at this establishment for a long time coming.
"Best BBQ in the city.  Very small place so be prepared to wait....also for a party more than 2, will be very difficult to find a table that will fit all of you together.  The mac and cheese is excellent."
"Good BBQ here, but ""Mike"" and the team don't pick up the phone.  Since the line to order is usually stupid silly, I tried to phone in my order, but no one would pick up for 30 minutes.  I tried and I tried, and then I tried to leave Mike a message just to complain, but even then I just get dropped from the phone enroute to Smoque.  Here's the rub (no pun intended), when I finally got here the restaurant was half full and the line was not that long.  What the faaaaaaah?  I know the ribs are good, but do I need to kiss your ass to get food in my belly ?  I think NOT.  PLEASE GET A BETTER PHONE SYSTEM IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS."
"This weekend I was fortunate enough to experience the greatness that is Smoque. Prior to going, I had heard nothing, but positive feedback about this BBQ joint. Obviously, stakes were placed pretty high and in the end Smoque did deliver. I was absolutely blown away by how great this food tastes. While eating there I found myself in a trance and before I knew it my 1/2 pulled pork 1/2 chopped brisket sandwich with side  of coleslaw and beans was consumed. Long story short, if you are a BBQ lover it's essential you check this place out."
"Baby backs, beans, mac and cheese and corn bread dinner. All were excellent. Rare to not have one item that fails to live up to expectations. Smoque hit them all out of the park. Easy parking, quick-moving line on a Saturday  night, and lively atmosphere. Will become a regular."
"I'd give five stars, except that I didn't get to try the baby backs, and that's gotta be my test.  But everything else we tried--the St. Louis ribs, the sliced brisket, and the pulled pork sandwich--was great.  The barbecue sauces are awesome.  Both have a very zingy vinegar taste, and I love that.  The sides were incredible as well:  mayonnaise-less slaw, baked beans, mac and cheese, and cornbread.  None of it was bad.  In fact, I liked far better than our other Chicago BBQ foray a year or so ago.  I can say without hesitation that we'll go back to Smoque, and I had no idea I liked BBQ this much."
"its byob, if that makes the dryness of the meat any more tolerable....it was decent in a bbq-less part of town"
"Finally got a chance to try this place. I ordered the half-baby back ribs, the pulled pork and a sampling of the sliced brisket. Thought the ribs were ok. I don't like my ribs charred nearly black at the top, so it wasn't for me. The two sauces were excellent though. Loved the thinner, more vinegary-one, though the thicker one was excellent, too. Pulled pork - FUHMAZING. Loved that. Still tasted great the following day as leftovers. Threw it on some toast and wah-lah! Breakfast, so good!The brisket I wasn't impressed with, but I've never tried it before, so maybe that's the best it can be? I thought it was dry with strips of redeeming fat on its sides to moisten and flavor it up.Coleslaw - so fresh, nice and tangy and just perfect with all that pork grease. One of the best ever. Cornbread - eh. Thought it was too greasy - it's cornbread! Why is it so greasy?!?!?! Wasn't thrilled with the mac and cheese, but the fries were right on.All in all, will go again! It's not the best BBQ I've eaten, but it's solid and definitely one of them. Don't go during the lunch and dinner rush. Way too overwhelming and you feel just a bit claustrophobic."
"Believe the hype. Absolutely, finger-lickin' delicious."
pulled pork + mac and cheese = heaven.
"Smoque has the Best tasting bbq meat I've ever tasted. The only thing holding me back from giving it the coveted fifth star is the fact that I'm not really into the sauce. It's not a bad sauce , but I'm a smokey flavored sweet thick Kansas city style sauce. The sauce at Smoque is more of a vinegar based heavily spiced sauce, pretty thin. I have tried the baby back ribs (fantastic) and the pulled pork (equally fantastic). The baked beans are the best I've had and the cole slaw is very good. I even love the hand cut fries , great. The prices are lowish average , and the dining room is nothing to shake a stick at , but clean. This is my new official favorite bbq joint , if I pick up a jar of Heckys in Evanston's sauce and caramelize it a bit , I'll probably have a plate full of 5 star ribs....Had the brisket , I was not a fan of it until I had it here , I really like the brisket here. The peach cobbler was just alright , did the job. This time I got 2 different sauces , one with the brisket and pulled pork , thin and vinegary-y. The other sauce came with the ribs and was much better suited for it , way thicker , sweeter and enough to bag the elusive fifth star."
"mmm...mmm...barbeque!!! the first time i had some smoque bbq was dinner at a friend's grandparent's place.  the spread included brisket, cornbread, chicken, and ribs.  everything i put in my mouth melted like butter and tasted just as good.  the next day, i couldn't stop thinking about the tender, juicy brisket.  i just had to have it!  i phoned it in on a friday night for carry out.  this was a good move because when i went to pick my food up the place was packed.  there was a long line of people wanting their bbq. as i was approaching the door, the manager put up a sign that they were out of brisket!! thank god i already ordered mine!  haha!  suckas!"
"I just went to Smoque for the first time tonight and I have to say that I look forward to many more yummy returns!  I went with a group of 4 and all of our food was A+.  We were already talking about the next time we visit before we even left the first one!I'm not much of a meat eater .. so you might be asking what I was doing at a BBQ joint.  Well, my dad saw them on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins ad Dives.  My family loves BBQ and I live for mac and cheese.  Seeing that they had mac and cheese on the menu, I couldn't pass up a trip to try it out.  I also ordered the 1/2 chicken and fresh cut fries.  I'm picky about my chicken and theirs was just awesome - very flavorful and cooked just right.  And the mac and cheese was to die for!!  They serve it up in small foil cups with a crunchy breadcrumb top.   Yum!  I shared the fries with my group and we all kept reaching for more.  Even though I am not much of a meat eater, my family is and they all loved their dishes (ribs, brisket and all the sides).  Like I said, we started talking about our next visit before leaving our first and we continued to talk about it the whole way home.We went on a Saturday at 6:30.  There was a short line out the door.  The line was full the entire time we were there.  One of the men that works there said it had been that crazy since 11:30 am!  They do a good job moving you through the line and they help coordinate seating after you've ordered.  And if you have any left, they're happy to provide to-go boxes.  If you enjoy a cold one with your BBQ, it's BYOB."
"if you like barbeque, and are in chicago, come here thats it.....its that good....... thank me later."
Very good BBQ. This place is very good. They have two kinds of ribs. Everything is probably terrible for you which makes it all the better. It's very busy but the time I went we where able to get a seat right away. They won't let you sit down until you order so it keeps people from hogging all the tables and is first come first serve. It's not too expensive and everything I had I liked. Great place.
"Although the food is good, I don't think it is great.  The service is good, not great.  The seating is okay.  Parking is not so hot.  I feel the prices are on the high side.  Actually, I think they are really high.  But the Mac and Cheese is great.I must admit, I wish I could give more stars because my husband LOVES it, but he will just have to write his own review."
"I wish there was such thing as 6 stars!!!   Oh my goodness this place is so good.  If you haven't been there, shut the computer off right now, grab your car keys, and go.  It's so good.  A buddy and I went up there for lunch.  It was pretty busy, but went really quickly.  I ordered the half and half.  It's half a pulled pork and half a sliced brisquet.  When they called my number, I noticed they only gave me a half brisquet and forgot the pulled pork.  I must have looked puzzled or something because from behind me a manager or something came up to me and said, ""did we forget something?"" I said, ""yes I thought I ordered a half and half but looks like maybe I only ordered a half"".  He said, ""oh my gosh I'm sorry about that, no problem, go ahead and sit down and I'll bring you the other half"".  WOW!  That's awesome.  Within a minute here he comes with my pulled pork.  Both were so good.  The cole slaw is a great oil based one and the mac n cheese was the bomb!!!!  My buddy got some fresh cut french fries which I tried and I would also recommend.  I'm going again as soon as possible."
"Let me start by saying, I have hit the southern bbq trail in my travels.  I have eaten at many of  the legendary spots from North Carolina- Texas.  I have also been to the popular ""authentic"" bbq joints in Chicago.  FYI- Smoke Daddy sucks.  If you think Smoke Daddy is good bbq, you must think Pizza Hut is good pizza.  If we are talking about the food, and only the food, Smoque is the best in the Chicago area.  Sure, there are lines, sure, they may run out of food.  There is a reason why there is a line out the door on Wednesday night.  THE FOOD.  The ribs are awesome, don't bother with the baby backs though, the St. Louis are cheaper and better.   The brisket is great, the chicken is to die for...The only thing that I think is just okay is the pulled pork, but I don't order that when I get bbq much anyway.  The sides are all very good.   I will admit, Fat Willy's has better Mac-N-Cheese, but that's about it.  Somebody went off about the peach cobbler being peach crumble, who the fuck cares what they call it, eat it, it tastes good.  If you agree with me about the greatness of this place, you're right.  If you don't you're a pussy."
"I have been to Smoque a number of times, and have always enjoyed the food. I think the Brisket is great.  Really the only place in Chicago that comes close to the brisket I would get when I travelled to Texas for work.  I also like the fact they have St. Louis style ribs.  One thing of note is the cole slaw. I hate creamy style slaw due to my aversion of all things mayo.  If you like a vinegar based slaw give it a try (though the slaw at White Fence Farms is better)."
"Quite possibly the best restaurant in the USA. I guess for meat lovers like myself, anyway. Yes they will get your order wrong 90% of the time and yes bc they were on tv a while ago the line still snakes out the door, but it is so worth it, my friend. Try the brisket. Dreams, fantasies, voyages, treks were made based on this brisket."
My bf swears by this place...he LOVES the brisket (sliced).  We probably go here every other week.  I haven't tried the chicken but I can basically say everything else is absolutely mouth watering!!!! A definite MUST for BBQ in chicago.
"this place is great. i've only ridden by their restaurant location--haven't gone there yet, but we get it catered at work on fridays occasionally and it's always a popular choice. i'm imagining the restaurant has a church like quality to its aroma as it always does here--must be the smoke. the chicken is great. i'd highly recommend that. good mac and cheese and delicious beans. the brisket was decent--not so much my thing--but i think that's one area that smoke daddys does better."
"This place serves food so delicious it could make me lapse into cheezy double entendres: holy smoque! for example.  I love this food, but I've never actually gone inside, making this a half-assed review, having only picked up to-go orders. But I sat in the car while my friend ran in, and even THAT was great!  Anyway, we enjoyed delicious pork-n-beans, cornbread muffin, and pulled pork sammy with uber delicious slaw. You will love it, I guarantee. It makes me embrace my inner redneck, after all these years. Need more joints like this in my neighborhood. Be prepared to consume massive amounts, you barbeskue loving carnivores."
"Sooooo Good! I used to think that BBQ was eaten only during the 4th of Juiy  outside on the grass before I realized the are great BBQ restaurants hidden in the city!!  My sister wanted to try Smoque, she had heard it was good so we went for dinner.  You order before you are seated, the staff is really helpful and nice, never mind this was our first time and we were asking the cashier a million questions and there was a long line behind us, she was really patient.  We ordered the combo rib platter, pulled pork sandwich and texas sausage.  Ribs were juicy, tender and falling off the bone, the St Louis Style had a nice flavor to it, they offer BBQ sauce on the side , slightly sweet and not too vinigar-y. Don't miss the texas sausage, lots of flavor and well worth it, the sides are good too! Mac and Cheese, and beans were the favorites, all dinners come with slaw.  Only dessert  offered is peach cobbler which has large chunks of peaches with a crumble/granola top served warm!"
"Ohhhh gawd.... Still drooling... Still full... and still wanting more of that delicious pulled pork sandwich in MA BELLAY!!I finally convinced the husband to brave Saturday afternoon traffic so we could head over to Smoque and have us a BBQ lunch.  We showed up around 1pm to a full house--plenty of folks getting their Q to go, plenty of others sitting at tables with their BYOB drinks in hand, saucy smiles on their faces.  We waited in line for a few minutes, not a big deal at all, and enjoyed the smoky goodness in the air.  I scored a table while Justin ordered for us and a few minutes later, I was in hog heaven.  I had the 1/2 sandwich of pulled pork, a pile of flavorful, tender meat with a bit of sauce on top, all on a very nice bun (we're not talking Wonder Bread buns here, kids).  The sandwich was great, but even better when I piled my side of coleslaw on top.  I love the slaw--it's not the mayo-laden kind, but a super crisp, fresh slaw with a bite--a perfect companion to the pork.  I got a side of BBQ beans (oh man, these were good) and some peach cobbler so I could get the full Smoque experience, which of course wouldn't be complete if I hadn't stolen some of Justin's mac n' cheese.    He said it was the best mac n' cheese he'd ever had and even though it hurts my ego to agree (I DO make a mean homemade M&C myself), it's true--I've never had such creamy, rich, flavorful mac n' cheese... By the time it was peach cobbler time, my tummy was already full--nothing a little ""pattin' it down"" couldn't help, though.   The cobbler was very good and even though my stomach was way full, I was glad I didn't have to share with Justin--his enormous brisket sandwich was more than enough for him.  We stuffed ourselves silly for under $20.  A delicious deal!Smoque is a hoppin' place, unpretentious (I mean, come on, it IS a BBQ joint after all), comfortable and lively.  If you come during the rush, be prepared to wait a few minutes and to vie for a table.  You'll probably get to meet one of the owners if you choose to eat in--one of them was making the rounds, chatting up his customers and making sure everyone was happy.  Go now before it's even more packed, thanks to its mention in this month's issue of Gourmet...  I can't wait to head back for some St. Louis-style ribs.  And more cobbler. :)"
"I ordered the ribs and approximately 30 minutes later they yelled my name. I got up and retrieved my order from the counter and right away I could tell something wasn't quite right. The ribs were so dry, I thought I had mistakenly ordered beef jerky. All the mediocre BBQ sauce in the restaurant could not have helped me choke those ribs down. I am a big fan of smoke flavored BBQ, but this place took it to an entirely new level. The meat tasted like someone dropped a napalm bomb into a pig pen. The staff behind the counter was so aloof you'd have better luck carrying a conversation with your scorched meal. Very disappointing."
"Hands down the best BBQ I've had.  Everything is great.  Beats Smoke Daddy by a wide margin.  And since I'm just a dopey Chicagoan that doesn't know his BBQ, I'll note that I took a friend from Alabama, of the Dreamland ribs upbringing, here and he was extremely impressed."
UNREAL BRISKET SANDWICH!! Ribs were unimpressive...my wife loved her juicy pulled pork with sauce on the side....
"Stopped for a quick lunch and had the sliced brisket sandwich -- very soft and flavorful. I'm no BBQ expert but I prefer mustard-based sauce, which is Smoque's feature. It was busy but the owner came by and asked if everything was ok, which I always appreciate. Only thing I thought was missing was a sausage sandwich (as opposed to platter). Hope to be back soon."
"i hadn't thought about a pulled pork sandwich in YEARS.  enter: smoque.  now i can't stop thinking about pulled pork.  i have been known to frequently profess to ""not consuming PIG.""  i now see the light.you have made a new woman of me, smoque.  i came to you begrudgingly with a group that i could not persude; i left with a newfound love."
Best barbeque I've had in Chicago.  The ribs are awesome and so is the mac and cheese.  But the pulled pork is the best I've ever had.  This place will definitely hit the spot.  BYOB option is always nice too.
"any place that offers peach cobbler as a free side is way ahead of the game. and if that cobbler is better than any i've had elsewhere, with a crunchy topping and just right, not too sweet peach filled center, well, that's five stars right there. it's just so good.luckily, the bbq was really fine as well. the sauce isn't the typical sweet molasses variety, but a blend of sweet and vinegary tanginess that is a welcome departure from my usual. the chicken had a nice spicy rub on the skin which added to the overall flavor. cole slaw here isn't held together with a mess of mayonnaise, and its fresher crunch of cabbage w/a touch of red onion offset the bbq nicely. the fries were how i like em, not too thick, well browned and crunchy. the rest of the group had the meat offerings of brisket and ribs and pork, and while i'm not a red meat eater, i had to take it on faith and their slurping and accolades that the meat is delish as well. oh, and everyone from the cashier to the busboys wore smiles."
"I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. I am a huge fan of their brisket. Don't leave without trying the cobbler. Normally, I am not fond of coleslaw, but theirs has changed my opinion with it's balance of crispness, light dressing and tanginess. The portions are perfect enough to leave full, but not having to take anything home."
"If you enjoy Texas style BBQ then this is the place for you. I'm a fan of Memphis & KC style BBQ. I like the Brisket sandwiches and they're baked beans are great. Service is very good and there's usually a line but it's moving, so don't let the line scare you away. It's a clean place, BYOB and right off the Irving park & Pulaski Blue line exit (1/4 block south of the exit). Give it a go."
"an antiseptic bbq for Northsiders (ie, white folks). no rib tips. no hot links. after ordering, i saw a diehard foodie bud who advised me to not bother with the ribs. we promptly changed our order from full slab to briskets/pulled pork and never looked back.the ribs were tinted with smoke tho lacked spices and the good ol porkiness of other ribs from the side south. yes, the fries are good, but if i wanted good fries, i'd just move back to LA and eat in-n-out everyday. go for a cheap beef brisket sandwich and avoid the rest of the menu. A slightly sweet, slighty tangy, barely spicy, not-to-thick/not-to-think sauce was the saving grace. Alas, the sauce is not the boss.Barbara Ann's, Lem's, Mack's, George's (on Sibley) even Honey1, all have better offerings."
I have had BBQ from all over the US & while this place isn't the best I've ever had it definitely is AWESOME & is probably the best in Chicago. There isn't one bad item on the menu.
"I eat at Smoque every Friday night.  Ok, not every Friday night but when I'm training for a marathon, I eat there every Friday night.  My fellow runners out there will understand why I stick with this plan, when you find a good thing and it works, stick with it.  Well, I found out 2 years ago that Smoque before a long run works for me!  I absolutely adore that their ribs are dry rubbed and the sauce is served on the side, I'm not a fan of drippy messy ribs.  The fries are incredible as well as the mac and cheese (and both offer some carb loading opportunities.)  They serve my husband's all time favorite pulled pork sandwich and I happen to love the brisket!  You don't have to fight for a table either because the wonderful gentlemen there help you out with finding a seat.  I live close by (a 5 minute walk) so I'm lucky that I can get there before the rush and get my fill before it gets too crowded.  But watch out after Cubs games, the place is crazy busy with Cubs fans.  My husband and I have tried many many other BBQ places and Smoque always wins for us....love the food and love the staff.  And I love that when we walk in, the guys always ask ""how far you running tomorrow?!"""
"We went to this place last weekend after hearing the great reviews about it.  I've got to tell you -  I was not at all impressed.I ordered the 1/2 pulled pork sandwich w/fries.  Had I known the sandwich was going to be so small, I would have ordered the full size.  I couldn't stand the BBQ sauce - thought it was WAY too watery, and not very flavorful either.  My husband ordered the 1/2 pulled pork 1/2 brisket sandwich and said it was dried out.  My son ordered the mac & cheese.  While the mac & cheese was good, it was not served as I had heard it was - with a crispy breadcrumb topping.  I've heard the topping is the best part of the mac & cheese.  The coleslaw was edible at best - nothing spectacular.  While we were waiting for them to call our number, I overheard what was going on at the counter.  Two people returned to the counter with their trays of food, complaining about one thing or another.  Another man was trying to order the BBQ chicken, but was informed it wasn't ready yet, and was still in the smoker.  Hello???  The place opened at 11:00 AM, and this was just past noon.  How can any good restaurant not have menu items available when the place opens?  Oh - and the dining area. It leaves MUCH to be desired.  Super bright sunlight coming in and bouncing off the huge metal ductwork on the ceiling; concrete floors, plain Jane tables.  Not that I would expect Architectural Digest style decor, but this was just pitiful.My husband was born & raised in central Texas, and while I'm a Chicago girl through & through, I lived in Austin, TX for 5 years.  After living down there and being able to taste REAL BBQ, nothing will ever compare, and Smoque didn't even come close (The Salt Lick it isn't!!!).  Unless I'm in that neighborhood and desperate for something to eat, I won't be going back."
Great food.  Haven't had bbq like that ever before.  Check them out!
Been here a few times ... No flavor ... Average BBQ...Always out of product... Too long of a wait. Honestly I don't understand the great reviews... It's just BBQ & not all that great. Sorry but I give up after 3 tries.
"hot damn, that is one good ol' brisket!  I'm not a huge fan of the location being in the South Loop and all, but the food was well worth the trip!  I feel like its hard to find good bar b q spots in the city and this place definately lived up to it's hype!  Clean, minimal, and sort of corporate looking in my opinion but dang good food.  I wish they gave you more of the sides, but thats just the fat kid in me talking."
"I don't know what ya'll are Smoque-in, but Smoque is a joke for BBQ. I went with a Texan and we both agreed the best thing we had was the sixpack of beer we brought in. He tried the brisket and I had the pulled pork... The pork was dry and flavorless. I tried their ""BBQ sauce""... Well I actually mean their taco bell sauce. Seriously it really tastes like Taco Bell sauce. The owner could see I didn't like the sauce and brought me two other sauces. Still no better. Really runny and really bad flavor. The corn bread was dry and flavorless. The cole slaw was vinegary and soggy, but not a good soggy. The actual best part of the food we had was the BBQ beans. Was the only thing I cared to finish... All in all a bust. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone for any reason. Go to Fat Willy's. Even Twin Anchors is better, Even carson's....   How there is always a line there, I don't know, but I guess you fans have never had truly good BBQ!"
Don't believe the hype.  I was expecting excellence but got average to good.  Only tried the brisket which had no smoke taste at all.  Somewhat juicy but I've definately had better.
"This place is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! The line is well welllll worth the wait. I'm super picky when it comes to BBQ and this place has it down to a science. The sauce, the meat..... So so good."
"I went first thing on a Sunday (11ish) and there was not a line at all. I got the chopped brisket platter w/coleslaw & got the baked beans & cobbler. My friend got ribs & a large mac n cheese (we split all the sides). My friend said her ribs were quite good. I thought my brisket was good, a little charred but that was ok. Good sauce. The portions for the meat were very generous but my friend and I both thought the portion on the sides was on the small side. We both agreed that the mac n cheese was great. The coleslaw is OK (it's a vinegar based dressing). I liked the baked beans & thought they had a nice smokey flavor....my friend thought they were just OK. We both agreed the cobbler was very good.  Overall I'd say the bbq was pretty good but I'm not sure it was the best bbq I've ever had. I think I expected a little more since seeing Smoque featured on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives. I will say that they gave me a side of mac n cheese instead of baked beans the gal behind the counter just gave me a side of beans & let me keep the mac n cheese - which me and my friend were both thankful for because we really dug that mac n cheese. I'd give Smoque an extra 1/2 star based on that but sadly I can't. Pretty good bbq, it's worth a try."
"The atmosphere is very informal, rows of community tables and chairs.  The meal is served on baking trays topped with parchment paper.  The brisket is so tender, you don't need a knife.  The pulled pork is also excellent.  The mac & cheese is especially good and try the brisket chili if is available as a side.  The BBQ sauce is thin and tangy so it doesn't drown the flavor of the meat.   The food definitely makes up for the lack of atmosphere."
"Went here for dinner and surprisingly did not have too much trouble finding a parking spot. We went in and ordered and had our food in less than 10 minutes. Just enough time to get our soft drinks and sit down. I had the sliced brisket platter with the mac and cheese, cornbread and slaw, i added the ""taste"" of the texas sausage. The brisket was juicy and flavorful with just the right amount of smoke, the cornbread was firm but not dry and the mac and cheese was made with real cheese. It was the best BBQ I have had in the Chicago area, save my own. I have to say it was better than the BBQ i had in Texas several weeks ago when I was there. We all enjoyed the peach cobbler for dessert. We even got an additional pound of brisket to take home. I must commend the gentleman runing the front of the house, he kept people moving without really seeming to and helped handle orders to keep line length down. A definite addition to our restaurant list when we are in the city."
the best  brisketchicken  taste like porkthe place is nice i wish seating was different   not like your school lunch room  but i hav to give them credit  they are trying    they should put some music in there  i am going back  once a week
"oh hell yesfinally, some delicious fucking cornbread in this city...went here with the lady...we split a few types of pig and some sides...everything was solid...brisket...awesome...tender, dry rub was tasty, and not covered in sauce which i don't like...they give you that shit on the side, and even though it's quite tasty (memphis stlye, lots of vinegar), i don't need my perfectly cooked swine to take a bbq shower...st louis ribs...very meaty and again, the dry rub they use is excellent...perfectly cooked, and the meat fell of the bone...sides...i'm a big sides person...you can't call it a perfect bbq without good sides, so the same best hold true for a bbq joint...and the sides here didn't disappoint...mac and cheese, delicious...baked in a tin with bread crumbs on top...simple, elegant, yum...baked beans, a little sweet but still good...and i already sang the praises of the cornbread...hand cut fries were also good...best bbq in chicago i've had...although gale st ribs are still the perfect ribs and will never be topped..."
"born and raised on a cattle ranch in kansas...i think i know a bit about bbq, and really haven't found much that compares up here in the chi.but.that all changed last friday when i sampled the offerings from smoque.chicken, brisket, baby-back ribs, st. louis style ribs - all were wonderful. these are fork and knife ribs - you'll be sawing them off the bone with your knife/fork and then can opt to use your hands.  the sauce(s) had an original flavor and tang to them that still makes my mouth water. do they bottle this stuff?baked beans were very tasty as well but i didnt care for the slaw..ill make this a bi-weekly tradition."
"I have to admit, from the sound of things I expected a sort of quick sling, four-white-walled bbq diner.  On my first vist I would say that this place is pretty good.  I consider myself knowledgable in the bbq arts and believe that this place is worth frequenting.  I am very happy that this place has opened up so close to me.  The dining room was clean and had some color to it (definitely wasn't as harsh as I was expecting).  The macaroni was awesome, I definitely could've gone for a larger portion but then again it was just a side; the slaw was more salad like than slawish... but was good to me.  The bread they used for the sandwiches was pretty delicious.  Plus there is the choice of fountain drink or canned soda so you're set for either take out or dine-in.  The bathroom was very clean, germaphobes would appreciate it in there.Here are my flaws with it: 1. When I eat b-b-que I expect large heaping portions.  While the sandwich I ate was reasonable, at 6.95 for just a sandwich I would've expected a bit more.2. The meat verged on being delicious... maybe once they get their technique and recipie down better they'll achieve greatness, but right now i'd say it was good.3.  It was a bit chilly in the dining area... won't be a problem during the summer months, but I bet it will be nice and cool with the central heating and air.I look forward to coming back here and trying other things so that I can get a more well-rounded opinion.  As of right now I'm coming back and looking forward to chowing down."
Best BBQ on the North Side.  Pulled pork and brisket sandwich are the best.  The ribs could use some work.  I went the first week they opened and I wasn't expecting so many people to be there.  The Mack and cheese is straight from Alton Brown!  Even down to the Panko Breadcrumbs on top.The french fries are just like Little Louie's from way back in the day!I am so happy that I live within walking distance!  Hail to Smoque.  I will be a frequent customer.  I am bringing my in-laws there tonight!
"I live in downtown Chicago.  What could possibly convince me to ride the blue line for 40 minutes, almost all the way to O'Hare when I am starving?  Only the best BBQ in Chicago.  I'm talking good barbecue, the kind where the meat on the bone from your ribs has so much flavor that you don't even need to put the sauce on it.  The Mac & Cheese has that nice crispiness that true good southern style M&C should have.  The pecan pie is to die for!  Definitely get the sides.  As for the pulled pork, it wasn't too dry, nor did it taste like it was sitting in water for hours waiting for me, it was just right.  Despite being far out in the suburbs, the place was packed.  I went here on the recommendation of a friend who's from KC, and I have to admit this place rocks!"
"I used to work in the restaurant business for 9 years and I have eaten here at least a dozen times, and have never had less than a five star food experience. It makes me irritated to read reviews where people are searching for something to criticize in this place. I understand BBQ is a very subjective experience, but nothing these guys do is mediocre. If their biggest sin is long lines, I can live with that. This place uses quality ingredients in everything they make. All of their sides a truly homemade from scratch-no food service prepared product here. Real mac-n-cheese (crusty on top), homemade cornbread, beans from heaven, crisp vinaigrette coleslaw,  peach cobbler is amazing.  In my opinion, their prices are too low for what they do with food.  Let's hope they can keep up these high standards of food production. These guys could have sold out long ago, but have stayed true to their high standards of quality! Keep up the great work!!!"
Food is delicious!  Everything is so good its hard to decide what to get.  My husband and I go back at least once a month to get our fix.
"The sliced brisket is tender and flavorfull, as are the ribs.  If you go later at night they may be out of some items as they employee the ""make it and sell it until we run out then go home"" BBQ model.  BYOB is a huge plus and offsets the price as well."
"Is it really necessary to even review this place? Just give Smoque five stars and lock it from ever being reviewed again. If you've never been, just go. Best Bbq, sauce, mac n' cheese, fries, beans etc. Flipping amazing."
"decently priced, overwhelmingly good indulgement of ribs.  the sides are also yummy! the wait is worth it."
"I went here a while ago so maybe things have changed.  We were quite disappointed.  The food had a great taste but the brisket was dry and everything was cold by the time we got it back to our table.  I think the reason may be because the place is very basic in terms of decor w/cement floors, etc. and we went during winter.  The door kept opening and closing and I think the place was a little cold and barbecue doesn't always hold its heat.  I think the trick is that if you go here in winter, to get your food ""to go"" so that you can heat it up when you get home.  When we were there, the food did not survive the trip from the counter to our table."
"Smoque gets 5 stars because it is in IL, I would give it 4 if we were further south but as I look outside I am reminded we are NOT.  For BBQ in IL this place it absolutely Delicious.  It is perfect to rid yourself of that craving for you most favorite BBQ place, mine would be in Kansas City.  Everything I had was wonderful, and the single serve tins for sides and dessert are brilliant.  As well this is not the place you take your dream person on a perfect romantic place.  But if you want damn good BBQ this is you place.  The first time I walked into Smoque on one Sunday night a little after 7pm, the place was packed and the line from counter to the door, I knew I had found my favorite BBQ place in Chicago.  Then I tasted the food and nearly fell of my chair because I had found a place to stop my mouth from watering for BBQ for months.  Go forth and drench your face in BBQ sauce don't be shy, just don't wear a white shirt!!"
"We decided to hit Smoque on our last day in Chicago.  After seeing it featured on Diners, Dives, and Drive Ins my family had very high expectations (and hopes).  Parking was a problem but we found a spot on a side street and walked right up and in- no long lines at 11:45am!   We are from Texas and my husband is a barbecue snob.  We tried the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs. We were not disappointed.  The meats and the sides were delicious!  A place well worth going ""out of the way"" for!"
"Smoque is incredible.  That sums up my feelings for their BBQ.  I am a huge BBQ afficionado and Smoque ranks near the top of my list.  Their ribs, pulled pork and Brisket were all damn good.  Sides are a little small, but not necessary when you have BBQ as tasty as this."
OH yummy!  I was there last night for a party with the chicago reader group. i have been wanting to try this place for some time. I am so glad I did. the Sandwhiches melt in your mouth! literally I am not kidding. the sauce is just amazing. I only wish we could have tried the cobbler. I forced myself to eat the entire plate and my best friends left overs. I did and I can say I am proud! ha ha. Dont miss this.
"I heard good things about Smoque so I had to give it a shot while in Chicago and staying close to O'Hare.  Extremely easy to get to by train using the Blue line and Irving Park stop.  They are only 1 1/2 blocks from the station.  This is a BYOB hole in the wall place where you order and pay, then give the number in your party and your order number to the ""table guy"" who will find a place for you at the lineup of tables when someone finishes and leaves.  Very low keyed place; get your own soft drink or ice tea (sweet and unsweetened) and wait for the table guy to seat you.  Remember - it's BYOB.  Your number will be called and you will need to go get your trays from the kitchen area.  You will eat elbow to elbow so don't expect a romantic atmosphere.  The sweet tea was just OK although they do it much better down south.  I LOVE smoked meats and have a smoker at home which I have worked hard to perfect my recipes so I am discriminating when it comes to smoked BBQ.  Here's my review:  The chicken is off the charts - best damn smoked chicken I have ever tasted.  Rich smoky flavor, moist, tender, nice crispy skin and good flavor.  Pulled Pork, brisket, and St. Louis ribs were a disapointment.  The meats were tender but the smoke flavor was not there.  I would go back for chicken but not for the pork or beef.  Baked beans are spicy, contain meat, onions, and are tasty.  They could use some nice smoke flavor and tone down the spice.  The spicyness overrides this dish.  Slaw is very basic - sliced cabbage in a non-creamy sauce, i.e. no mayo in it.  It's on the sweet side which I like but the large slices of cabbage made it a bit messy to eat.  The peach cobbler comes in individual portions the size of a cupcake.  The top crust was harder than it should have been but was tasty.  Overall it's OK - not terrific.  The fries are home cut and fried, and are served in a small brown paper bag to soak up the grease.  They were very good.They have a clean up crew that will take your tray and trash when you have finished and will wipe the table down.  It would be nice to have wet naps  so you could clean your hands at the table.  When it's crowded it's a struggle to get to the restrooms to hose off.  Prices were OK but they don't offer a half and half platter so you can sample two different meats.  Instead you need to order one (like pulled pork) then do the ""add a side"" for $3.00.  If you love smoked meats, you need to try their chicken."
This place is great. Brisket is excellent and the sides are a good portion. Well worth the money!
"Great food, good price.  Very casual environment."
"ring a ling...it's doctor brisket calling...here to fix your need to feed.so i came back after 1 bad outing, next five have been meat-alicious... luckty for me my maker gave me the tools to enjoy four legged dinners and i am taking full advantage of the my carnivore tool set at smoque.  pigs must oink their way merrily into the smoker, where their ribs and shoulders rest happily, under a coat of spicy goodness, until they are plattered up for ME to eat.  even better is the cow, who's brisket is spared the irish torture of corning and instead properly seasoned,  put away for most of the day in a warm bath of wood smoke and sliced into mouth watering, glistening morsels of food joy.  eat the sides if you must, they only displace meat, leaving more for ME.  I'm in love. wait, i think they are out of food again, so don't go until i've eaten."
"I visited Smoque after seeing a good review in the Reader, and really liked the barbecue. We had a little bit of everything - St Louis style ribs, briskly, pulled pork , mac & cheese, and BBQ beans. The ribs, brisket and sides were great. Pulled pork, not so much. St louis ribs were meaty, not fatty but not too dry. The BBQ beans were really good, too. A vinegary sauce with just enough spice. The line to order snakes into the middle of the room, and seating is basically family- style. I'll definitely be back."
"Sorry to disappoint you Joel, but that is not Rudy's Country Store BBQ Chain sausage at Smoque.  It's Rudy Mikeska's from Taylor Texas.  Best sausage I have found anywhere.   I think it's custom made for Smoque and shipped weekly here from Texas.   I am addicted to those spicy links."
"Amazing BBQ.  I'm not much of a ribs guy, but the brisket is fantastic.  FANTASTIC!  Can't go wrong with any of the sides either.  Peach cobbler's my favorite.  If you haven't been here yet, find some free time today.  You're missing out."
"Tony was craving for ribs but I didn't want to go all the way to downtown just for Carsons. So I went on yelp and found Smoque BBQ, read the reviews and was sold on coming here. First of all, I can't believe how close this place is to our house! Just 10 mins away. Second of all it's easy to miss this place when you're driving because it's at the corner and there isn't any bold sign illuminating out in front. Third, you will not regret eating here!When you come in, you're suppose to go to the counter, place your order, pay and find a table to sit at and eat. Everything is made to order and they will shout your number out when it's done. I had the pulled pork sandwich with an add on of ribs and their mac and cheese. Tamia had their ribs. Tony had their chopped beef brisket an add on of ribs and a side of peach cobbler. Goodness, my sandwich was just piled high with pulled pork. I took some of my cole slaw and add it on to my sandwich and spread their delicious bbq sauce on the bun. It was wonderful. Pure delicious! Their mac and cheese was perfect! Moist, cheesy and addicting. Tamia was loving her ribs and the bbq sauce so much that she asked her father for his! Tony enjoyed his food. He was very amazed of their peach cobbler that he decided to share it with Tamia and I. Bad news, Tamia and I devoured it without asking him if he wanted a second helping. =)The price is reasonable and the service is awesome. Also, this Tuesday we had order take out from them. We had their sliced beef brisket sandwich, ribs, texas sausage, peach cobbler (and order of 3 of course), and their side of fries. Again, everything was great..actually their sliced beef brisket sandwich is way better than their chopped version. The texas sausage was so good, smokey and peppery. Obviously, Tamia claimed her ribs and a side of peach cobbler. Everything was made right and nothing was soggy not even the fries when we took it home. Ah, now if only they would make bigger portion size of their peach cobbler or at least topped it with a scoop of vanilla icecream. *wishful thinking*"
Most important bit of advice I could give anyone is to call ahead to this place....At 6pm on a Sunday they were out of  brisket and ribs...and almost out of chicken.  I thought the pork was great but was there for the brisket.  My friend went at 5 pm on a saturday and they were out of brisket...so call ahead and see if they are running out of stuff...
"the best brisket. juicy, tender, what else do you need?"
"Like many, we saw this on Food TV and decided that we had to come.  As a disclaimer, my husband and my extended family are from the south, so North Carolina-style (vinegar-based) BBQ and slaw without a lot of mayo - which is mostly what Smoque serves - is right up our alley.Food was great - loved the brisket and pulled pork as well as the sides we ordered from the regular menu (beans, slaw and mac & cheese, which came out in its own little dish rather than just a scoop from a big pan of it), but the special side of brisket chili just didn't do anything for me.Service was friendly and as fast as could be for the line that was there at 2 on a Sat afternoon.  I like that they request you order before snatching a table since it helps make sure the flow of tables works.  Also, we overheard one of the workers advising someone on the phone to call ahead if coming late at night to make sure they still have what you want.  Keep in mind, brisket and pulled pork take a long time to make (as in overnight), so its not just something that they can whip up more of."
"Love the brisket sandwhich, mac&cheese, and slaw.  Kids enjoy the peach cobbler.  The baby-back ribs also rock.  Plan ahead since parking and waits can get long and you don't want to feel rushed when enjoying slow-cooked BBQ.  It's delicious!  Note - BYOB, they have church keys you can borrow."
