Casa Yari
This place is amazing. All there food is amazing. They have Honduran and Puerto Rican food. I literally tried a little of everything and everything I tried was great. My tastebuds are in shock with all the flavor..They have a separate menu on Sunday's. It's a breakfast / lunch menu. I will definitely come back for there food.
"Had a great experience here and hope to be back soon!  Yelp did not steer me wrong on this one.First of all, we were very warmly welcomed by our server - service overall was perfect.After we placed our order, our server brought us some Honduran chips with salsa on top - I'd never had Honduran food so I wasn't sure what to expect.  The salsa was not spicy - it was more like a delicious marinara.  Pretty good.We had the garnachas as an appetizer, which were pretty good as well.  My friend ordered a burrito bowl (she said she liked it, but was unable to finish it due to its big size) and I ordered the Vegan Jibarito sandwich.  I was really craving tostones and saw that a jibarito had fried plantain (as the ""bread"" of the sandwich), so I ordered that with seitan.  I asked the server which was better - the tofu option or the seitan (I usually like both), and I'm glad he suggested the seitan.  IT. WAS. AMAZING.  Sooooo delicious!  I spread out some of the garlic/oil that was on top and oh my gosh as I'm typing this I want another one.  To be honest, after the chips and appetizer, I was pretty much full after eating half the sandwich - but it was so dang good I couldn't help myself.Forgot that it was a BYOB place, so I ended up getting a lemonade (they brought out a can of Minute Maid and a straw) instead.Being vegetarian, what drew me to Casa Yari (besides its high Yelp rating) were the numerous veggie/vegan options available!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this.  Can't wait to go back."
"I had been here once before with some friends and had a fabulous dinner... and since it was BYOB, the girls and I had a great dinner. Ever since then, I've been wanting to bring the hubby here.So here we are for brunch... and boy, can I tell you that it was the best decision for brunch we have ever made.The inside of the restaurant is very simply decorated and the music streaming is very relaxing.The service was great... and the food was amazing! I ordered the Boricua Breakfast which consists of two eggs (anyway you want them), imported straight from Puerto Rico Spam cut into slices, sweet plantains, seasoned fries and avocado.My husband ordered the eggs and mofongo and was covered in a yummy red sauce.For our daughter, off their very excellent kids menu, we ordered the Lares Breakfast which consisted of arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas), scrambled eggs and seasoned fries. Our daughter is picky about eggs and she ate the eggs with no problem.The rice was seasoned well and not dry, like other places that we have been to.For dessert, Casa Yari is known for their flan, and after our server mentioned so many yummy flans that currently had for the day... we suggested that she she bring us her favorite, which turned out to be the plantano rum raisin. That surprise decision made my husband very happy since he's a huge rum raisin fan.If you are in search of a great place for brunch, this is the place to come to. I will be back soon... you can count on it!"
"Excellent! I moved to Chicago a year ago, I have tried many places here since then and I have paid for way overpriced meals in places you are supposed to get fresh and quality food but you don't really. So, in Chicago my new strategy is to stick to authentic and delicious normal / decent priced cuisine using fresh ingredients surrounded by servers, cooks etc who know what they serve. Casa Yari is one of those places where food is delicious, great quality ingredients, tasty simple dishes and healthy. It's one of those places I can't understand why isn't packed for brunch but then I realize this is Chicago and so it makes sense (they don't offer greasy burgers and/ or frozen fake fries). Anyway, we tried the seitan jibarito, the regular baleada with avocado and the cachatro breakfast. Everything top top! As well as the service. We will be back!"
Wow. Amazing food and all housemade. Veggie options on most things and flan is delicious. Very friendly and attentive staff.
"This local spot is a hidden gem. The place is very simple, which gives it a nice relaxed atmosphere  for dinning. This is a no rush type of place. Take a seat have some of their cafe con leche, which was great. The menu is just like the setting. Simple and to the point. The focus here is flavor and that's what we got. I had their Mofongo and eggs. First off, this was a huge serving. It is basically mashed plantains and with two eggs topped with chopped bacon and salsa. The combination was on point. My wife had the Boricua breakfast. The plate consisted of two eggs, seasoned fries, sliced avocado, and an imported ""Spam"" style luncheon meat that was fried just right. A very good dish. We finished all up with some flan that is made in house. We let our server pick her favorite and she brought us back a Rum Raisin Flan. It's was very good. My wife found it a bit strong, but if you like rum. This one will hit the spot. At the end of it all. It's a great dining experience if your new to Puerto Rican cuisine. This place will point you in the right direction. Another good point about this restaurant is that they have vegetarian options for most of their dishes. So drop the lettuce wraps and try some great Caribbean food."
"Complete gem! So happy I found this place, my friend and I enjoyed it so much. Good atmosphere, very clean and homey. Food is amazing! Can definitely tell it's all hand made and it's all seasoned to perfection! Not too expensive especially for the quality and presentation of the food, see my pictures. Walking in you're seated right away by friendly staff :) and great selection of salsa music. Try their Pernil encebollado if you like pork and their desserts are a must. Portions are perfect size, you will get full but it's not overbearing. No alcohol here it's BYOB. I suggest this place to anyone"
"GREAT first time experience. Waitress (Yazmari) provided GREAT service and helped me decide what to choose from by providing GREAT food recommendations. Ambiance was warm and inviting.     This place is truly a must try!  I can promise you that you will not be disappointed. I am in love with the ""Flan de Gandules"" in English Pigeon pea Flan. It melted in my mouth and screamed rich flavor without being drenched in sugar. The shrimp Mofongo left me breathless! I had a moment! The plantains had just the right amount of garlic, shrimp was oh so fresh and the sauce was heavenly! Reminds me of Abuela's cooking. I went for dinner and I will definitely go back for Brunch!"
"Really cute little spot, good for a sit-down yet still pretty casual dinner. Super friendly service! Tons of vegetarian options.  The tortilla salad was delicious - really good charred corn, black beans, red pepper, greens, yummy fresh avocado, tortilla strips, and a smoky/spicy/sweet dressing. I would've liked a little bit more of that dressing because it was seriously so good. I had the vegan jibarito with seitan and chimichurri sauce on top. Very yummy but maybe a tad dry. Boyfriend had the pastillon with veggies which was also really good. We will be back."
Fantastic food!!!!Chicken Mofongo is delicious!!!The plantain lasagna is out of this world!!!The service is superb!!!Very friendly and comfortable environment!!!I love it here :-)
"I grew up on Sawyer and Fullerton and still live in the neighborhood. This is authentic Puerto Rican food, and I am a vegan. They make their own seitan, in-house, are very accommodating to vegans and non alike, and everything is fresh. We went in at 3:20 on a Sunday, after a long day of moving. Although they close at 3:30 on Sunday's, they welcomed us with open arms, and we ate another great meal. Check them out! You won't be disappointed! I also went there on my anniversary. My husband loved it. This is our new neighborhood hang out. Thank you!"
I love the food at this place. My Puerto Rican friends introduced me to this place and when ever I want to eat Puerto Rican food I come straight to this spot. I love to travel and this is my trip to Puerto Rico.
"Still 5 stars, but just wanted to update that I brought a friend here and we both had a great experience. Kind, welcoming service, delicious jibaritos (and for you fellow vegetarians out there, they have a Vegetarian Jibarito!! Praise the lord), and FLAN to die for. This time I had the coconut flan, which was just as delicious as their pumpkin flan! Must. Try. Flan. Will. Be. Back. Again."
"Had a small group dinner here and it was great. I was in contact with the owner beforehand to try and work out a prix fixe menu. The options she supplied were great but after talking to my group we just had too many specific restrictions so we decided to let everyone just order from the menu. Service was swift and friendly and we were provided with tools ( glasses, ice, etc.) for our BYOB treats promptly. I had the pleasure of enjoying the Caribbean nachos, the ceviche and one of their signature dishes, the crema poblano; all were simply fantastic. Between our group I think we had a bit of everything on the menu and no complaints and empty plates all around. Casa Yari is new-ish and worth checking out for sure!"
Relaxing environment and excellent food.  Waitress very welcoming and friendly.  Pillows and seating was very comfortable after a long days work.  I recommend to all.
"So, so good.  The restaurant itself is a nice, quiet, cozy space with 30-40 seats and nice decor and music inside.  But I don't really care one way or another about that stuff, I care about the food.  And the food delivered.I was given a Honduran appetizer for free to start (I guess that's the Honduran way).  It was chips and a salsa that was almost like a marinara sauce on pasta.  Lots of flavor, very little spice.My meal was the mofongo, a Puerto Rican staple.  The shredded beef was cooked and flavored perfectly, the cornmeal base was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, and the sauce and vegetables mixed in were delightful.  It also came with lightly flavored rice pilaf and some coleslaw with a vinegar base.  All awesome.Dessert was a mango flan that was sweet and creamy, but the additions that made it were thin slices of mango on top and a dusting of chili powder that provided great contrast.Highly recommend this place for groups of 2-4."
"I saw good reviews on FB and thought I'd try it out.  I'm so I glad I did, I now have a new favorite.  I like the layout of the tables and decore  The pillows are a nice comfy touch to settle in for an extravaganza of flavor for your taste buds.  The stuffed plantains were rather good, the empanadas were amazing with sauce you can choose how spicey you'd like.  The skirt steak served with potatoes and onions were divine, cooked to perfection!  I even tried the ceviche which was a smash!  Slam Dunk Casa Yari!  Think I'm going to have you again today!"
"On a whim I stopped in for lunch and am extremely glad this was the place I was near. The menu is comprised of a well focused mix of Latin foods that really diverge from Mexican restaurants. My server, Alyson, was so knowledgeable of the foods, their origin, and made great suggestions. I ended up ordering more food than I could eat just so I could take some home. This place is a fantastic choice."
"Hard to carry on a conversation over dinner because the music was too, too loud. Food OK. Won't be back."
"Surprised I didn't go to this place sooner. Kind of hidden and you might walk past it without even knowing it's a legit restaurant. I went for lunch and got the Wednesday special, the jibarito for only $5. I only had a jibarito once before and didn't like it for whatever reason. That was a while back so I was ready to give it another shot. And boy am I glad I did. Steak was cooked perfectly, loved the sauce inside and outside (got the garlic one). I do think they skimp on the sauce and even when I asked for me, they gave me a very very tiny amount. Oh well. The fries on the side were great. Hector was very friendly and I will make sure I come back very soon."
"This restaurant is so bomb, food is so so great! I love the comfortable chairs too. I live in Hyde Park and it was well worth the trip. I'll definitely be back."
"Came for brunch on a Sunday. Service was great and the food was amazing! My husband had the steak jibarito with the garlic sauce and loved it (make sure you order a side with it). I had the French toast which was out of this world. It was dipped in coconut milk and drizzled with all sorts of yummy flavors & had a side of sweet plantains. My son had the egg and rice bowl-  white rice cooked with peas and pork, topped with an egg and avocado chile sauce.... He ate every last grain! Lol. Took some flan home- a Mango w/chile & Avocado w/ lime. The Mango flan was great but I felt the Avocado flan lacked a little flavor. We would definitely come back. Also, from what I have been told, the Tues-Sat menu is entirely different from the Sunday menu. Give this place a try! Oh, Its also vegetarian friendly!"
Fantastic food and service! A family owned restaurant that pours their heritage and passion for excellent food into every dish on their menu!
"Lasagna, Caribbean Lasagna. Get it. I don't know if anything else on the menu is going to make you happy, but that lasagna with plantains is very very unique and worth experiencing.Pastelon $12 - Caribbean lasagna made with layers of sweet plantains, ground meat, and layers of cheese served with arroz con grandules."
Really enjoyed this place last night. I thought that it would be nice to try something different and I was right. It is a small place maybe 15 tables with the most comfortable chairs ever. We had all of the specials and thought Hector the waiter was fantastic. It is a BYOB and I think you should give it a try.
"Pretty fine gem of a place in this less traversed area of Logan Square. The staff is always friendly and remember me when I stop in. Right around the corner from me, I look forward to every Wednesday when I go in for their $5 jibarito special (plantain and steak sandwich) which when paired with one of their rotating soups is a meal that satisfies me every time. I went there with my family for a Christmas Eve brunch buffet. They had sweet potato waffles, plantain, eggs, ham and a chilaquiles station. Not to mention the fresh fruit and pumpkin muffins which were great. My family enjoyed it, but they deserved a better turn out since we were the only ones there besides the staff and their family. I hope they continue to branch out like that and do more to get people in the door. This place is very clean and polished looking with an inviting atmosphere. It would be a great option to go to if you want to please a vegetarian audience. It's also BYOB so bring a bottle of whatever and settle in for a good meal."
"AN UNEXPECTED FIND....The sleek understated lines and large glass windows with a very simple interior make dining here a wonderful, fain experience with all the emphasis on delectable Puerto Rican cuisine. I didn't have any expectations, but was impressed and pleasantly surprised at the unexpected find we stumbled upon. For starters, we all ordered the Mofongo de Camaron. We also tried their homemade croquetas de yuca which were filled with bits of Jalapeños and queso (cheese). The shrimp inside the Mofongo was wonderful and fresh. The broth was very hearty, rich, and delicate. We were super ebullient to try the Mofongo. We all agreed it is worthy of 5-stars. The homemade croquetas had a crispy exterior with a tender interior, but was a bit too salsuginous for my palate. The majority vote was 4-stars for the croquetas. The quality of fresh ingredients are exceptional with evocative dishes that were superbly presented. Wow, BYOB, is a huge plus! We took advantage of this and came well prepared with our bottles of wine. We enjoyed wines from Argentina, France, Italy and Spain. We had an international array of wines, which complemented our food beautifully, and reset our palate for the next dish. The coconut rice with beans was definitely well balanced with bright flavors. We enjoyed this very much. We also tried their famous Pastelon. Pastelon is NOT lasagna. In fact, there is no comparison. It is a Puerto Rican version of a layered Quiche. It is a layered meat dish, reminiscent of lasagna, but instead of pasta, the starch used here is ripe plantains (also known as platanos dulce or platanos maduro). It contains meat, eggs, cheese and sweet plantains. The amalgamation of the sweet and savory of the Pastelon makes for the perfect comfort food! We ordered several of these dishes, so everyone in our group had an opportunity to taste the Pastelon. Some thought it was 5-star worthy while others went with 4-stars. There was a back and forth debate about this rating. I thought it was worthy of 4-stars. I ordered the paper-thin steak smothered in grilled onions and served with arroz con gandules and sweet plantains. This dish was exceptional. I was super fain with my dish. It was very satisfying, well balanced, and seasoned nicely. It was truly delectable and ethereal. This dish receives 5-stars. The service was effusive and friendly. We appreciated their quaint philoxenia. This restaurant is not pretentious and is understated. You are not coming here for the decor. Our dining experience was intimate, and punctuated by the Caribbean fragrances of various herbs and spices. We went here with a small group of individuals from the Chicago Foodie Meet-Up Group. Once a month we try a different restaurant, and this was an excellent choice. The price-point at Casa Yari is reasonable. The portions are satisfying, but not overly huge. They offer seasonal desserts. They are known for their different Flan flavors. Someone in our group ordered the coconut Flan, and said it was ""heavenly!"" Several people ordered dessert and many thought the desserts were either 4-star or 5-star worthy. The two vegetarians in our group easily found items on the menu that they could have, so this is definitely a huge plus. Our final rating is 4-stars, because they are not open beyond 8:30 pm. Although service was effusive, which we appreciated, it was a bit lackadaisical. We had to ask for water refills several times. We arrived at 6:15 pm. By the time we ordered, got our food, started grubbing and drinking wine, having conversation, laughter and a good time, it was time to leave! We all agreed that we will return again and bring along our spouses, significant other, partner or BF and GF. Casa Yari has been in business since 2013, so they have had ample time to work out the kinks.In the end, we had a fun time and were super fain! The food is worthy of 4 or 5 stars, but the service could be improved. The good news is they are open until 10:30 pm on Friday and Saturday only. I tried placing an on-line order for carry-out, but received a message, ""Sorry, this business is not taking online orders right now."" Why have this as an option if people cannot use this feature? Not cool."
"I've lived in Logan Square for almost 3 years and I JUST found out about this place.  How??  It happened to be 2 blocks from my apartment.  We had a party of 6 and were seated right away on a Friday night (I chalk to this up to the fact that apparently no one knows this place exists).  The service is perfect.  The food is incredible.  I got the plantain lasagna, and it is delicious, and unlike anything I've ever tasted.  The atmosphere is very pleasant and the staff is friendly.  P.S. This is a great place to bring vegetarians, as they have lots of veg options on the menu."
Yari handling the biz and Hector with that million dollar smile. This place is sure to hold down the PR cuisine representation in Logan Square for years to come... And it's BYOB too!
Extremely Delicious. I can't decide my favorite dish but I often order the eggplant jibarito. You can tell the chef/owner makes the food with love!
"We decided to avoid the brunch rush that usually is prevalent in the square and opted to try Casa Yari just down Fullerton!We are fans of Cafe Con Leche and thought that this might be a good replacement. The restaurant itself is very cozy and we sat ourselves at two plush leather seats. The waiter was very kind and provided us with recommendations. We ended up deciding on the Churrasco & Eggs and the Pastelon Omelette. Churasco & Eggs: A decent sized skirt steak - maybe 4-6 ozes. It was cooked and seasoned well with chimichurri sauce. The fried sweet plantains were also a good touch.Pastelon Omelette: I've never had pastelon before, but I'm definitely a fan. People compare it to Puerto Rican lasagna and it holds up well to that comparison. It tastes like a slightly lighter version of lasagna with hints of sweetness from the chunks of plantain. We had a very pleasant experience here and enjoyed the food. Casa Yari will definitely join our rotation of favorite brunch places!"
"What a gem of a restaurant!!  Went here on a date-night and we left feeling as if it was one of the most charming places, with absolutely fantastic food, in the city. We started with the Caribbean Nachos.  I could eat those every day for the rest of my life!  They are basically tostones covered with your choice of chicken or pork, smothered in cheese and then matched perfectly with a side of refreshing mango salsa.  For dinner we had the Adobo and Tostones and the Pastelon.  We were smiling at each other over each bite.  There was only one server. and we noticed food coming out slowly for other people ahead of us, so there must have been a small chef staff as well.  This made for a bit of a wait for our food.  Normally that would at least halfway cancel out my rating, but for some reason the restaurant felt so warm and cozy, and the server was so genuine that we didn't mind at all.  And when the food came we realized why it was a bit of a wait: everything was hot, homemade and ""made with love."" This is a place to go to have a leisurely night out.  Bring a bottle of wine, or two, and settle in for a wonderful dining experience."
I've eaten at and raved about this restaurant a few times now. But now in addition to their usual great meals Yari has a fabulous new summer menu! I tried the POLLO CON TAJADAS yesterday for lunch(see pics and description of it on her Facebook page) and I had a major complaint!!!! The serving was so large I didn't have room for my usual sweet indulgence of flan!!!  Saturday I will try another new item and maybe this time I can also order a flan too. And of course the newest Sunday brunch items are always great. Check out their new summer hours and those new items!! See ya there!!!
"Came here for lunch as it has high praise from other reviewers. They didn't steer me wrong. The service is excellent. The waitress is so helpful as everything on the menu sounds amazing. The jibarito is the best I've had in Chicago. The plantain was pressed to the perfect thickness, thin enough to bite into and not overpower the sandwich contents which were also perfectly prepared. I will be back for more!!!Avocado Flan is a must! So different from all other flan flavors. Very creamy and simple avocado flavor that let's all the flan flavors have a turn on you taste buds. If this flan is this good I can't wait to try the other flan choices."
"My fiancé and I just moved around the corner from here, but have been in Logan for years. Finally decided to check this place out. We were leery at first, as no one was in there at 7pm on a Saturday. We were thrown by how great the food is! Added bonus, it's BYOB.I have a wheat allergy, so it's always great to have more options for tasty food within walking distance. We will definitely be going back!"
"Have truly say great restaurant great look outside and inside and truly is the place to definitely eat!!!! For Latin/ Puerto Rican food! Nice atmosphere, clean! Straight chill place and to top the food is great place!!!"
This place is a must go flans are delicious Jubaritos are the best .You guys may visit Casa Yari !!!!
amazing flan and jibaritos! + byob and amazing customer service!! (:  nice quiet and peaceful. Perfect vibe when you walk in. And parking. Will DEFINATELY come back.
"I'm a big fan of Casa Yari, especially considering that I live right across the street.  But Casa Yari offers much more than just convenience for yours truly, but also genuinely unique and tasty dishes to boot.  We typically always get their Relleno De Avocate to start, which is a half-stuffed avocado topped with shredded pork.  Always hits the spot.  On the entree side, we have tried the Pastelon (plantain lasagna), Mofongo (garlicky mashed mound of plantains), Parilla De Pollo (marinated chicken with tangy sauce), and Bistek Empanizado (breaded steak), all of which were very good.  They also have numerous other latin-fusion options to offer as well, but the aforementioned entrees are those that we have tried to date.  I'm pretty confident you will be satisfied or impressed with practically anything that arrives at your table from the kitchen.Another plus of this restaurant is the service (very nice waiter) and the laid-back vibe of the restaurant.  We always bring our 1 year old daughter and we feel right at home (especially considering it's usually not crowded yet around 6:00, but nonetheless).  Did I mention it's BYOB too?  Because it is, so yet another plus for Casa Yari.  Although I am partial to Rinconcito Cubano, it's hard to argue that Casa Yari isn't the best restaurant on that blossoming stretch of Fullerton between Kedzie and Kimball.  Check it out, you'll be happy you did."
"They were open but unapologetically turned us away while they had open tables--on account of a few large parties. They should have had a sign on the door explaining the situation, or done more than just shrug when we asked if they were open. This was disappointing, especially since we drove quite a way just to eat there."
