Big & Little’s Restaurant
"I used to work here. The only reason I do not, is because I took another job offer out of convenience. When I came back, I remembered why this place is so good. The employees are always very laid back and chill despite how fast they're working, and they'll even strike up a conversation just to see how you've doing (they even remembered me). It was busy at the time I went, but the line is fast moving and I only waited 10-15 minutes for my order. The food is perfect. I ordered the Chorizo Burrito and the Mac Diddy (I love places that have Big Mac variations that aren't McDonalds). You really start to realize why this place is so genius. All the ingredients are quick to prepare and go so well together. I asked my burger to be medium-rare and it was spot on. It wasn't more like medium which is still good I would eat it anyway. It was a definite medium-rare, no more, no less. They even put an egg and bacon on my burger which was a bonus. I didn't know if they did it just cause they thought I was cool. The prices could be a little lower. $7.00 burgers and burritos and $3.00 tacos. I'll come back here whenever I'm in the area."
"Worst ""delivery"" experience ever. After 3 hours of waiting, 3 phone calls and no fewer than 4 lies from staff at this restaurant, my order is a no show. I was initially told my order was out for delivery despite being an hour late, then the second phone call revealed that somehow my order had been cancelled, then magically by the third phone call my order had been out for delivery all along. Except, not. No taco is worth this headache. Chipotle it is from here on out. Terrible customer service. Boo hiss.Update: The restaurant called me after seeing this review to apologize and offered up a free meal. Nice gesture, but still not likely to order again given the hassle of last night. Pro tip: go in person, don't order delivery."
"This was a bit of a disappointment. We had high expectations given the food network appearances. That being said, the food was served very quickly. Each taco was good on its own, however the sauces were very heavy handed. Each taco tasted like the next and were a bit too sweet. The Hawaiian pork, spicy beef short ribs, and pork belly tacos were indistinguishable after the sauce. The foie and fries were nice and sweet and a great introduction to those who have never tried foie gras before, however the fries were not the best pairing. We would have preferred fries by themselves and the foie with a more traditional/acidic pairing. Overall a decent showing, but not up to the hype."
"I love this place. Talk about quality, hole in the wall, and DELICIOUS!!! Be ready to leave smelling like deliciousness because the kitchen is open :)Poke taco - always delicious. I love how crispy the taco is too. Great texture contrast.spicy Beef - Tasty but you have to add the spicy sauce from the table on itBanh Mi Whitefish - YUM!!! Great big chunk of fish, really well cooked.Pork Banh Mi burrito - this thing is HUGE!!!! and it is YUMMMMMDefinitely worth a visit if you are in the neighborhood."
"I've been here twice before and enjoyed (most) everything I sampled.First off, the people working here are very friendly and helpful. Both times I've asked for suggestions, the cashiers gave their honest favorites and recommendations and it was all great!Raw Ahi Tuna Taco - Disappointingly tiny, but it's one of my favorites. All the components work well together and it tastes very fresh.Samurai Taco - very unique tasting and deliciousMahi Taco - tasted pretty good, not as good as the samurai, though.Fish & Chips - tasted pretty good, but can't help but feel that the tartar sauce is a bit weak.Softshell crab po boy - I wanted to like this, but the bread was very hard/dry and it was very messy to eat.  The crab was pretty good though. I was very tempted to just eat it by itself.Foie Dog - May have been a bit too rich for my liking. I personally prefer Hot Doug's/Hot G Dog's version better.Overall, a pretty good place to eat. Food isn't too pricey and tastes pretty good."
"It's poppin but there actually is enough seating due to the decent turnover. The menu is huge, and I'd heard it was a seafood place but there are tons of other options, although no chicken I don't think. There's beef and lamb, as well as veggie. They have various fry topping options, too. The drink options are lacking--fountain soda and coffee pretty much, although it's byob, so that pretty makes the world your oyster if you think ahead, which we didn't because we came after exercising and coming here at all was a game time decision. The prices are okay, the meat is nicer than in a $1 or $2 taco, and I only needed a few tacos. I tried two of the short rib and the lamb tacos, and shared kimchi fries. The fries were great. I liked one of the short rib tacos a lot more than the other, I think it was the original one I didn't live, and the Japanese short rib I quite liked. The lamb was obviously good, it's not a taco but a tiny gyro with two strips of lamb. My friend really enjoyed the fish tacos, and the impressive thing is that you don't just order ""fish tacos,"" they have like 8 different kinds with different fish combos and fixins. There's actually a decent amount of actual bike rack bike parking nearby on Belmont which is nice, although there are plenty of street signs, too."
"This place is excellent. I always get the Zeus burger which is a burger topped with gyros, a fried egg and tzatziki sauce - incredible!Prices are affordable, place is clean and the people are nice. Definitely check this restaurant out. I'm excited to go back and try out other menu items."
"If you want healthy this is definitely not the place for you. Well, I guess there are salad options but the rest of the unique food items in the menu really does overpower that salad section. I debated giving this place between 3 or 4 but I decided I will give it a 4 because there were specific dishes that I really liked where I would come back just to eat them again. I ordered:Truffle fries (Recommend-loved it!)Soft Shell Crab Po' boy (Disappointment. This was actually the main dish I came here to eat because I really wanted s.s.crab in a sandwich but the crab was too small for the size of the bread and the breading was too much.)Blue Crab Taco (Recommend-awesome!)Grill Mahi Taco (good portion!)Japanese short rib taco & Hawaiian Pork (the meats were flavorful but the portions were small).Spicy Pork Banh Mi Burrito (I love the idea of a vietnamese sandwich concept wrapped in tortilla. The burrito was definitely bursting with flavors of many different ingredients. The size portion was large as well. I recommend this one!)"
"Wazzzuuuppp Honkey!!!! One of the best sandwiches I have  ever had The Honkey served as a burrito filled with Fried Pork belly, Fries, Cabbage, Pickle, Special Sauce* and BBQ Sauce the layers of flavors are just outstanding. It's big enough to split but when it taste so good and cost only $5.99 why would ya. We also had the Pork Belly Po' Boy Fried Pork belly, Lettuce, Pickle, Louisiana Hot Sauce, Special Sauce* and Maple Syrup on french bread. I have to say The Honkey had it beat (plus it's fun to say honkey) but the Po' Boy tasted pretty damn good also. Third sandwich we had was the Gyro Burrito also good but overshadowed by the previous 2 sandwiches we had. Now sit yourself down!!!! Go ahead sit yourself down. Foie Gras fries, crispy awesome fries with 3 big slices of seared foie on top oh my god. I kept looking over my shoulder wondering if somehow this was my last meal and the grim reaper was gonna take me out. Seriously they are that good, last meal worthy and for 10 bucks a steal. Truffles fries $2.99 a deal and also awesome. First time I went I liked but did not love B&L'a now its love,lust and respect all rolled up in a tidy little burrito named The Honkey."
"I think what makes Big & Littles so good is they make very basic food into great dishes.  Simple things like a shrimp taco or a po-boy that will make you want to come back and back again.  Add in some dope customer service and it's easy to see why this is a favorite by so many.My most recent experience I tried the shrimp tacos.  When I first got them, it didn't look like much but they were delicious.  Im not sure what seasoning or sauce they put on them but it was excellent.   The guy next to me was eating a soft shell crab po-boy that looked amazing.  Next time, Kevin.  Next time.What I didn't know was this place was BYOB.  Or at least they don't mind you bringing in outside liquor (which I guess that makes it BYOB).  Saw a few people in there drinking beer and wine with their meals.  Any place that's BYOB is great in my book."
"Delicious Tacos place on Belmont avenue. I was there one evening for a light diner, and ordered several of their Tacos, all were delicious. I don't remember the names of the ones I ordered, but I took both fish and meat tacos, every single of these were very good, so you can trust this place and order whatever you want, I am sure it will not disappoint."
"Big & Littles!! Great tacos. Great sound track. Nothing better than housing some tacos while ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"" plays in the background. They have a great selection of seafood and meat tacos. I had the grilled shrimp, Big & Littles, al pastor and the Japanese short rib. Each taco had their own individual flavor and crunch. The grilled shrimp was my fave - limey and perfectly cooked. Japanese short rib was a little on the sweeter side but the tableside hot sauce helped balance it out a bit. Let's talk about that hot sauce for a minute. I want to swim in it. Mixed it with ketchup for my fries. Delicious. Service was fast and friendly. I got there within minutes of opening and there was a line out the door. Can't blame em!!"
"I love Big & Littles.I love how genuinely friendly everyone here is. I love how their long lines move quickly. I love how fast the food comes out of the kitchen.And I of course love everything that I've tried on their menu. I'm a big fan of their burgers, Ahi Tuna Taco, and their soft shell crab po'boy. Sure, there isn't much that's healthy on their menu, but itThe only disappointment is that the fish and chips here is a much smaller and less impressive dish than at the Orleans location. If you haven't gone here, you should."
"This place is great, but there is room for improvement.  The burgers are top notch.  Always add some Merks cheddar.  The tacos, as good as they are, are small and usually leave something to be desired.  I've had mixed experiences with the fries.  Sometimes underseasoned, sometimes over.  Sometimes hot and crispy, sometimes soggy.  My biggest complaints though is the wait time.  This is not a quick meal, as you might expect from counter service.  The line is usually out the door, which is fine, but it takes forever for them to make your meal.  I think I waited 30 minutes during an off time when we were the only ones in line to order.  If we weren't anxious because we were missing the beginning of our movie, I would have had a better experience.  You can see them cooking and clearly no sense of urgency.  So just know what you are getting yourself into.  Its BYOB so make sure to bring a 6 pack while you wait, then its no big deal.  Prices are good for the quality, especially the burger which did I mention is amazing."
"Overall: Great spot for a quality bite to eat. Try all of the different tacos and small goodies. Especially the fish! The good: All of the food was delicious. The 3 fish tacos I got (Ahi Tuna, Soft Shell, Mahi) were delicious and great. TONS of different options. BYOB. They play great music too.The bad: The line was long and took forever, and then waiting for the food took forever as well. Had to wait 30-40 minutes for a walk-up menu kind of place. Pretty expensive for the amount of food you get, even if it is delicious. Place was hot.Atmosphere: 7/10Service: 8/10Food: 8/10"
"But biased because I frequented this place ever since they opened on Orleans.  I really enjoyed the fish and chips and the Orleans location serves bigger portions, but this new site has smaller which is great since I can get a sample of everything.There is street parking and the line inside can take quite long during peak hours.  I always order the fish and chips with truffle fries. Soooo delicious and super greasyful, just the way I like it. I started ordering the ahi poke taco which is basically American sashimi. I am glad that they have this location because it is always fun to have friends come and BYOB."
"Delisioso! Big & littles is super famous now thanks to Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, and for good reason. They have an interesting variety of food including non-traditional tacos, burgers, and po-boys. Hey also have awesome fries including foie gras fries, kimchi fries, and truffle fries. I had the samurai taco, the grilled shrimp taco, and kimchi fries. The food was fantastic. Please note, this is not a spot for large groups. It's really a hole in the wall with a handful of tables inside and the same on the patio. If you go during lunch time on a weekend be prepared for a little bit of a wait because everything is made to order so it's hot and delicious. It's super casual, but I wouldn't call it a dive. I would definitely say that it's worth the trip."
"Pretty good po'boys but a tweak or two would help them live up to the hype.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the food, but not enough to wait 45 minutes or so from the order line to table side. The pork belly po'boy would be improved with a different sauce and better bread but adding hot sauce helped. The pork was fried properly though, not too chewy or hard so that was nice. The soft shell crab po'boy was good but the crab to bread ratio was lacking for $13. I'd prefer the crab be coated in cornmeal as well.The long wait and limited dining room makes this a 3.5 star affair."
"The tacos here at this restaurant are so delicious. If you like raw fish, do not miss out on the Ahi Tuna Poke taco. Every bite was extraordinary and I was so bummed when I was finished it. I'm knocking off a star though because I had the food because I placed an order for two tacos, one Tuna poke and one Mango Chutney and they didn't give me a mango one, in fact I have no idea what it was. Tasted fine but not what I ordered. Overall awesome place though. Definitely recommend."
"Experience: 5/5Came here on a Sunday afternoon. This place was hoppin'. Line out the door and around the corner. They had outdoor seating, but it was all taken. We were lucky to find a table inside. It isn't the quietest or coziest place. Expect a lot of hustle and bustle. Pretty extensive list of menu items. It takes a while once you place your order, but for the price, you get good food for what you pay for. Food: 5/5They had a special of Kimchi French Fries (see photo). They were realllly good. I've had a million different types of fries, but these were really unique and definitely worth trying. We ordered the Soft-Shell Crab Po'Boy (see photo) and the Banh Mi Po'Boy (see photo). Both were really good. The crab was more bread than crab, but the crab that was there was good. Overall, both were good, but it was the Kimchi fries that made the meal.Service: 4/5Great customer service. Long line, but worth the wait.Price: $Good cookin' for a good price.Overall: 5/5This place had great reviews. I would recommend the Po'Boys, but they have such a long list of tacos, I think those will be my next choice. Try to avoid dinner time if you are in a huge rush."
"Very good lunch spot, especially when you get to sit outside on a nice, sunny day. The menu is very reasonable when it comes to pricing. Portions are a little inconsistent with tacos, for example, beef short rib came with next to nothing in it whereas the raw ahi tuna taco was stacked!A lot of really interesting flavors going on with these dishes. I really want to come back to try out the softshell crab po'boy. Truffle fries are a must!Staff is always friendly, very nice group of people."
"The friers here sure get a workout!-Softshell crab po boy was just okay.-The fish in the samurai taco was overfried.-Burger was great, definitely the winner.-Foie dog (didn't have any) but my husband said it was just alright.Overall pretty mediocre fried food.Line was out the door this afternoon at 2:30 for lunch. Something tells me this place is the new Hot Dougs."
"""Foodie on foot"" Rosa J. is DOWN!!!  I had a pleasant experience at the N. Orleans location last time.  Hence, I purchased another Groupon and intended to try out the Belmont location with Daddy J. However, the ventilation problem inside the restaurant gave me an extremely nauseous feeling.  Ya'll, I'm laying on my bed writing this review so that I can fulfill my responsibility as a Yelp elite.  First and foremost, we are going to discuss on how the food tasted.  Overall, I wasn't, at all, impressed.  Here was the food that we ordered: 1) Samurai Taco: the flavor of the fish was ultra bland.  The spiciness from the jalapeño and the special sauce were extremely off-balance.  I thought it was an epic failure.2) Mahi Taco: this was much more palatable than the Samurai taco.  Nevertheless, it was really sweet, so sweet that the fish was lost in translation.  3) Fried Shrimp Taco: They did a pretty decent job on fried seafood, like the white fish po'boy I had last time.  Well, I wouldn't consider this dish as amazing though, in my foodie opinion.  4) Spicy Pork Taco: I think the God of sweet has blindsided my tastebuds.  The entire dish was a plain hot mess.  5) Al Pastor Taco: I give them some credit for taking on the challenge of fusion between Hawaiian and Mexican.  But the hot and sweet sensation did not do it for me.  6) Japanese Beef Short Rib Taco: ""the Big & little"" duo must have some kind of affair with Mrs. Sweet.  I guess I need to stay of their business because Mrs. Sweet is really something else.  7) Kimchi Fries: If you like layers and layers of ""sweet,"" then this dish is really for you...Thank you for the Groupon I wisely purchased.  All the food we ordered above was under $20.  I have a difficult time wrapping my head around why this place has received so many accolades.  From now on, I will stick with their po'boys and sandwiches."
"""My, what an adorable little fried crab they just served me! It's almost too cute to eat... wait.. what am I thinking?!?..."" ::NOM NOM NOM NOM:: I laughed maniacally as I pulled apart the adorable little crab, eating its adorable little claws first until I couldn't contain myself and dove right in. It was probably as delicious as it was pleasing to look at. The outside was perfectly crispy and had the most delicious batter. It was sandwiched between two fluffy buns and paired with aioli and veggies. We also ordered the beer battered burger (my first reaction being ""holy sh*t, this chef is an evil genius"") and the fries with the fried egg on top. The burger had the same delicious battered crust and most definitely did not disappoint. Overall, it was awesome. The food was fast, cheap, and delicious. Couldn't ask for anything more"
My oh my... First time but definitely NOT the last... DDD rated YES!!! Today's special Kimchi Fish Sandwich. Amazing... Phil's Fries OMG!!! Truffle fries with a fried egg... Where have you been ALL my life?????Many more things to try.. Summer of 2015 is gonna be a good!!!
"I loved it.  The people who work there were so nice and friendly.  I had the soft-shell crab po boy and, oh man, was that delicious.  Supposedly they are known for their raw ahi tuna taco but I can't imagine not ordering this po boy when I go back.  The heat in the sauce was just enough; it was perfect.  My friend had a burger and said it was great.  We shared the fries and agreed they were some of the best fries we'd ever had.  Go to this place!!!!"
"I can't believe I haven't put in a review for Big & Little's yet!  If you live in Lakeview, this is a place you seriously need to go to if you have a craving for tacos.  I'm a big fan of the beef rib tacos, I'm not a big seafood person but I know the seafood ones are popular as well.  The burgers are OK, I would stick with the tacos or burritos.  The amount of food that you get for the $ investment is a great deal for the quality ingredients and flavors they put into their food.  If you come around dinnertime, expect to wait a bit, but the line moves fast.  When you walk into the restaurant, you order right at the counter and they will call your name when your food is ready.  They also have TVs with different sports games on.  You have the option to sit inside, outside (they have tables set up), or take it to-go.  To be honest I was a little bit disappointed with the fries, I ordered the cajun fries and they came out cold, but they were tasty and cheap."
"I keep coming back to this place. Despite the long line to order, average of 20 minutes every time I've been there, the gourmet ""fast-food"" is deeply satisfying. I get the feeling that the owner recruits student chefs from the Le Cordon Bleu school next door because half the menu is avant-garde, and it works!Every-time I'm there:Japanese Short Rib TacoBahn Mi White Fish Taco (the pickled onions... the pickled onions!)Kimchi Fries (about a 7/10 compared to Del Seoul's 9/10)Next-time I'm there:I want to try the Softshell crab Po Boy and the Foie Gras fries."
"Never heard of a Softshell Crab Po'boy til today. A definite must try. Great flavor in the crab and the special sauce adds a nice slightly spicy touch. The food took a while to cook, but it was fried to order. Maybe 15 mins since ordering. Music was a bit too loud that we had to scream at each other across the table. Some of tables were set up too close to each other that people were bumping elbows or had to get up from their seats to let others in and out from all around them."
"I really enjoyed this place. Went here with my husband over the weekend. I got the fish and chips, which was basic but very delicious! The fish was cooked perfectly. My husband had some tacos (carnitas and some others) and a hamburger with bacon that he thoroughly enjoyed. We'll definitely be back!  I'm looking forward to trying something more adventurous during my next visit."
"Went here to grab a snack around 3 pm on a Saturday. All the tables were full, but luckily my friends and I managed to swoop a table pretty quickly. I ordered the samurai taco and the foie gras hot dog. The samurai taco was on point - fish was fresh and the sauce was delish. The tacos are on the smaller side (my friends' tacos were small, too) but it was perfect for me since I only wanted a snack. The foie gras hot dog is money - they don't skimp on the foie gras. It's a really fun, laid back environment. The staff is super friendly, which gives it even more of a home-y environment. The place is BYOB, so don't forget to bring some dranks to enjoy with your food!"
"Saw this place on TV once upon a time and somehow remembered to visit when on our way to a Cubs game one night.  We ordered a bunch of different items:Ahi Tuna - Perfect amount of spice, crunch, and fresh tuna flavor.Shrimp Banh Mi - Shrimp cooked perfectly, but a little too much bread.Kimchi Fries - Good spice and tang, fries not really soggy despite everything on top of them.Spicy Beef Short Rib Taco - Spiciest item I ordered - delicious!Hawaiian Pork Taco - tons of flavor, queso fresco fit nicely in this one.Samurai Seafood Taco - great combination of fried whitefish, lime, sesame seeds, jalepenos, and sweet sauce.  Heartiest of the tacos I tried.Great, unique flavors at Big & Little's - interesting combinations and sauces you probably won't find anywhere else.  I would go here all the time if I lived in the area."
"It took us 45 mins to wait in line, order, and get our food. They need to be a bit more organized. They need two lines one for ordering and one for phone orders. This poor guy behind us had to wait a ridiculously long time to pick up his pre ordered food. The food: 1-shrimp po'boy I hear it was super tasty. $6.951-shrimp bahn mi. It was super yummy! The special sauce was finger lickin' good. The sandwich was filled with so much yummy goodness I could barely bite into the whole thing. All the flavors went really well. I'd order this one again. $6.951-Mexican short rib taco. The meat is soooo tender!! It basically melted in your mouth. This taco was lacking in the flavor department. It needed a lil kick or something to put it over the edge. I wouldn't order this one again. $2.65 1-Japanese short rib taco. Now this was super flavorful, slightly salty, but definitely the winner of the two tacos. I would probably go just for this one. $2.65 1-Cajun fry. The flavor was subtle. They were good, but they were basically the end of the bag small prices that were overly fried. They were not worth the extra money. I probably wouldn't order these again. $2.35The boy and I each had our own shrimp sandwiches and split everything else. We left  feeling satisfied and not overly stuffed. Always a good way to leave an establishment in my opinion. The tacos were on the smaller side, but we're good. If probably come back again if I had another groupon like last night. Our total came out to $1.69 since we had the groupon. Can't really complain about that! If you're in the area its worth checking out."
"I had really high expectations for this place because I heard my roommate and friends rave about it. The service was nice, we didn't have to wait in line too long, and the food came out relatively quickly. But I wasn't very impressed with the food. The tacos were pretty good, not amazing. I didn't like the kimchi fries with the sweet sauce. I told my roommate about all this later and she said my mistake was not ordering the foie gras fries and soft shell crab po-boy."
"I honestly don't understand the hype. We waited in line for over an hour to experience mediocre tacos. With that said, I'm not sure one should have such high expectations for a place that a guy with spiky, bleached hair and an affinity for flame shirts endorses.The guy that seemed to be running the Lakeview location was extremely nice though, so I couldn't help but feel happy for his success. It's pretty impressive what a spot on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives can do for a restaurant's reputation. We fell for the buzz. You live and you learn."
"We ordered the soft shell crab po' boy and the pork belly po'boy with truffle fries. Both sandwiches were pretty tasty, but I like the soft shell crab the most. The special sauce was delicious. I think any sandwich with that sauce will taste good. I can't wait to come back to Chicago and try the tacos and burgers. I wonder what is the next specials when I come to visit. They had foie dog and kimchi fries this time. When finding the restaurant, look for a yellow mural on the side of the building. You can't miss it."
This is a great Groupon find for me!! The place is packed with great food. I bought a group in few months back and visited sometime last week. We ordered few tacos and everything was absolutely delicious. Oh and I would highly recommend a side of truffle fries- yum yum ;) Definitely going back sometime soon :)
"What the heck just happened in my mouth.!?!?! Seriously this place is amazing.  Ordered the kimchee fries and the al pastor burger.  The fries were pretty salty but defiantly worth all the sodium!!.  Usually kimchee is salty so can't blame em.  There was some cheese, Asian seasonings and a bunch of different sauces and of course topped with kimchee.  -damn legit! The burger which the girl in the front recommended was really good too...fried pork belly, American Swiss, jalapeños, pineapple and chili aioli.  Of course I asked for extra jalapeños, cooked medium and it was perfect!! They also have different sauces on the table which are all great!  Think I found my new go to spot. Definitely need to try the tacos!  Chill atmosphere, nice people and service! Keep up the good work!"
"Cheap and delicious! We first saw this on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and made it a point to visit on a recent trip to Chicago. The menu is huge, which made it difficult to decide on the things worthy of filling our stomachs. We managed to settle on 3:1. Pork belly po' boy - stuffed with abundant pork belly2. Soft shell crab po' boy - smaller, but tasty with the spicy mayo 3. Foie gras fries - the most decadent fries I've ever had. Huge amount of foie gras for $10, but became overwhelmingly rich after a few bites.The two of us were stuffed with $27 worth of food. I only wish we had more room to try everything else on the menu."
Can't say enough about this place. I've had almost everything on the menu and it's all good. If I had to pick though I would say get the tacos. You say they have a lot of tacos though so what should you get? All of them. At those price points you'd be doing yourself a disservice not to try them all.
"Big and Littles is easily one of my favorite taco places in the city, and there are a lot to choose from! The ingredients are always extremely fresh and each one brings its own unique flavors. They do have two locations and for some unknown reason, the Belmont location (which in my opinion is the better of the two) is pretty significantly cheaper. The line is always long and the wait is pretty crazy too. Sometimes it gets to the point where it may as well be a sit down restaurant which is annoying when you just want fast food. A side note, they have groupons for both locations all the time so keep a look out!My favorites are the ahi tuna taco (raw), shrimp, and any of the pulled pork ones are delicious (there is one with mango that I love. If you want something other than a taco than go for their famous soft shell crab po'boy, it's unreal. The small one is pretty big. Also, the fries are soooo good- every time I go I say I can't get them and every time I go I accidentally get them. The truffle are my favorite and if I'm feeling it I get the Phil's fries which is just the truffle fries with a fried egg on top."
"Came here for the first time during lunch today after the Blackhawks parade(Wooooooooooh!) and tried a Double Al Pastor Burger(pork belly, 2 natural all beef patties on swiss, & a pineapple slice). They should change the name to F'N GREAT BURGER! Also had the soft shell crab po' boy, ahi tuna poke taco & reg fries(pass on all 3). We actually ordered truffle fries but noticed we received regular when we got home(lame). Will definitely be back to try the Pork Belly Po' Boy & other delicious burgers."
"Who doesn't love a place with quality tacos for ~$2.95/each?!When I came with a friend, I ordered 3 tacos and truffle fries:1) BIG & Little's (fried white fish) $2.652) Spicy Beef Short Rib $2.653) Raw Ahi Tuna $4.954) Truffle Fries $2.25If I must compare... I'd say this place beats Del Seoul. BIG & little's offers a fusion of southern cooking, Korean flavors and Mexican tacos done right. At other fusion taco joints I sometimes feel like they're overpriced and only worth trying once.However at BIG & little's, there are so many things on the menu that you KNOW you will want to come back and try them all, happily and willingly. Not just for the novelty, but for quality food, if you know what I mean. This place is solid.The dining space is fairly small but on a Friday night for an early-ish dinner (7pm) a party of two was able to grab a table in five minutes. The turn around is pretty quick.I would love to try their deep fried soft shell crab taco, their foie gras dog (brings to mind Hot Doug's) and kimchi fries... The latter two which are specials and won't be on the menu all the time.Three tacos and fries to share was the perfect amount. My fave of the three was the raw ahi tuna because of its simplicity. The fried white fish not so much because it was a jumble of too many things- breading lettuce, sauce and not so much tasting the fish.The spicy short rib was average, but next time I come I will stick to tacos with seafood (crab and poke tacos) as those seem to be their specialty. I like the hustle of the staff here and they are all very friendly. It's a casual place to grab unique po' boys, dawgs, tacos and burgers."
"This was a place me and my friend were trying to get to try for a long time. When we went at night we weren't disappointed. The menu is so inexpensive and so tasty. Their menu is different from most fast food places we've been to because they have different types of seafood fried tacos, kimchi is also on the menu, and their special sauce that goes over the po boys is good too. The only reason why I gave them 4/5 stars is because it was a little bit greasy especially the pork belly po boy (my friend didn't mind it). We also took a recommendation from one of the cashiers who said to get the Phil fries which comes with an egg on top of the fries :P."
"Went to Big and Little's today, one of the places I've been meaning to try after watching Triple D. I thought it was okay, I've definitely had better but it wasn't the worst either. The service was a 5 star but the food fell short. Fish and Chips - Fish batter was pretty oily (we got the white fish and not the mahi mahi). It was good but just oily. Shrimp and Chip - Shrimp was not de-veined and tasted overcooked (chewy and tough). Soft Shell Crab Po Boy - This was good but the soft shell crab was a bit small for the bread that they serve like someone else wrote in their review. The crab had good flavor though so I can't really complain too much. Pork Belly Po Boy - This was the one thing that everyone has told me I ""had to try"". But it fell short, real short. I was not a fan of the sweet maple syrup flavor with the lightly spicy hot sauce that was added. It was too much sweet and not enough savory/salty. I wouldn't order this again if I come back. Samurai Taco, Big and Little's Taco, Al Pastor Taco - These were all very good, I definitely think you have to order the tacos when you come here. Kimchi Fries - The kimchi wasn't truly ""authentic"" (coming from a Korean) but it was pretty close. Personally I didn't like the sweet sauce that was added, I would definitely omit that next time around. The kimchi wasn't also spicy enough but that may just be me being picky.  I know it seems like I'm being picky but I swear I wanted to love it, I really did. I do have to say though for the amount of people that were in the place, the bathrooms were very clean and well maintained and the service was great (we sat outside and a worker came out and made sure we were doing alright - twice!)"
This review is going to be short and simple. Excellent food at an awesome price. Make sure to visit more than once so you can try everything! The soft shell crab poboy is a must when visiting. So stop reading this review and go now! Your taste buds will thank me later.
The only place in Chicago that I ate thrice.
"Delicious food! They were packed the whole time we were there, and still managed to bring out the food in a timely manner. Will definitely go back again. Here's what we had:Grilled shrimp tacoJapanese Beef short rib tacoMexican beef short rib tacoLamb gyro burritoAll delicious!"
"I came here on a Friday right before the lunch rush. I got the softshell crab po'boy, which did not exactly live up to my expectations. There was not enough softshell crab to fill up the sandwich so I was mostly just eating bread. The Ahi tuna taco was delectable but the taco was a lot smaller than I expected. My boyfriend got a fish sandwich, which he enjoyed but did not like how it was overflowing with sauce. The workers are super friendly. One of them even remembered our names after we finished eating and asked us how we enjoyed the food."
"If I lived here, I'd eat here all the damn time.After a hiatus from reviewing (I blame it on the exceptional summer weather we had in here in Seattle) I wanted to re-kindle my love for Chicago.I didn't even know that BIG & little's was famous, really. But I guess they've been on TV. They can't make up their mind on what they serve up best here, so they seem to offer everything: tacos, burritos, hamburgers, po' boys, and even hot dogs. You'll notice most of the menu has a lot of seafood (!) I stood at the counter staring at the menu for an excruciatingly long time because I couldn't decide what would be light enough for my 2nd lunch--since my 3rd lunch was in an hour and a half. I landed on two tacos: Maryland Blue Crab and the Ahi Tuna (poke-style). I sat down and waited at a table, noticing a lot of families and singles. The tacos were brought to me and I think my I put my hand on my chest and went, 'Aaaaaaw' because they were so tiny and cute. These hard little tacos were made with a thick cornmeal crust, and had the flat bottom so they could fit the enormous amount of fish in each--like a double-stuffed ice cream sandwiches. And they both tasted GREAT. The tuna was chopped small like a tartare and the blue crab was lightly dressed, which coupled with the thick crunch of the taco shell, was akin to the satisfaction of scoring the last tickets to your favorite show.I'll be back in the area soon and will definitely try their other creative taco flavors."
"We saw this place on tv, and must've earmarked it somewhere in the back of my brain. I remembered really wanting to try the raw ahi taco, the soft shell crab po boy & the  pork belly po boy. Well, when I finally got my chance to eat here, I TRIED ALL THREE!!! And I ate, and I saw that it was good!!!One criticism only: GET A LIQUOR LICENSE, please!!!!"
"I have been wanting to visit and went out my way to sneak a bite... the scene is ""all me"", the music is perfect (can I buy a CD?) And the menu had me drooling long before I arrived.If you go to their website you'll find there's two locations with two different menus... I ordered the Shrimp Banh Mi with kimchi fries and the young one grabbed a burger cooked medium with egg and bacon on top with truffle fries.... INCREDIBLE! !!!!   Very much pleased and looking fwd to returning."
"A friend told me about B & L a few years ago, she saw it on TV (she lives out of state). I finally made it in one day after running errands nearby, and I am kicking myself for not going in sooner.The guy working the counter was SO friendly and apologetic for the wait (which wash only 5 mins around 11:30am on a Sat). I ordered 3 different tacos all of which were excellent. The fries were delicious too. This is pretty much the perfect Saturday lunch or a super casual weeknight dinner. the pride and care going into the food is very evident."
"First things first, Omar is dope. Right when you walk in the greeting you receive from him takes you straight to Hawaii. Makes you feel like you're his good friend and the only thing on his mind is making you enjoy your food. Now to the food, ahi taco was bomb dot com. I find it difficult to find good seafood in Chicago but the ahi here was on point. The samurai taco (fried fish) was pretty good too. On to the not so good. Surprisingly, the one thing that I didn't like here was the al pastor taco. Al pastor is my all time favorite Mexican marinade and I just didn't find this one satisfying. Meat wasn't tender and it was charred to the point where the flavor profile was cooked out of it. Soft shell crab po boy was good but like Omar told me, the crab to bread ratio was like 1:2, maybe 1:3.All in all I still rate 4 stars because the customer service was so good and the environment just spewed happiness."
"I ordered the fish and chips (substituted fries for truffle fries) and my friend ordered the bbq bacon burger.  One of my fish pieces was pure amazing, perfectly crunchy and hot right out of the fryer.  The other two pieces were a little mushy, but still had great flavor.  The truffle fries substitute was nothing special.  It was just drizzled with some of the oil.  The bbq bacon burger was surprisingly good and was incredibly flavorful.  It seems like it should come with fries at least.  I would come back to try their tacos, which looked amazing."
This one is going to be short and sweet. Here are the highlights:Get In My Belly:-Double Al Pastor Burger with porkbelly (how can you go wrong with pork belly?!?!) -Ahi Poke Tuna Taco (Hubby didn't like it but I thought it was yummy but on the tiny side)Pass on this:-The soft shell po'boy was a disappointment. Wasn't worth all the hype. I was expecting a larger and more flavorful crab. Womp Womp!-Regular fries. We actually ordered the truffle fries and ended up with regular fries that weren't all that great to begin with.
"I'm visiting from out of town and decided each day I'm going to take the L to a new neighborhood and try a different restaurant. Today I stopped in Belmont and walked by Big and Little. After reading the menu outside, I had to go in. There was a bit of a line, but it moved quickly. The guy running the register was super friendly too. I ordered the pork belly po boy and a samurai fish taco for around $10.When the food arrived around, I dived into the pork belly first and forgot where I was for a solid 10 minutes. I'm not sure if it's because I skipped breakfast or because the sandwich was blowing my mind, but it was a positive experience. I almost didn't have room for the fish taco but rest assured, it got eaten as well. If I lived in Chicago, I would definitely come back to Big and Little."
"This place was packed on a Saturday afternoon at 5 pm. Smells good from outside. Waited in line for about 10 min, placed our order, and luckily a table opened up right after. Food came out in about 5 minutes. Tacos are a little on the small side, but very tasty. I had the ahi tuna poke and mango chutney pork. Perfect amount of food for a mid afternoon snack. Had a bite of my friend's foie gras hotdog--one bite was all I needed but it was dank. Other items the table enjoyed were the al pastor and the lamb gyro tacos. The restaurant is BYOB, the atmosphere is casual, and the staff are extremely nice. Not really a great place to bring bigger groups because the restaurant is tiny and the biggest table is a 4 top although you could probably push a couple together for 6. Overall great food and chill place just a stones throw from the Belmont stop."
"I came to this place because I saw them on diners drive ins and dives! I ordered the pork belly poboy and the truffle fries! The pork belly was crispy salty goodness! BOMBDOTCOM. Cooked very well. The truffle fries were crispy on the side with a pinch of sea salt and truffle. Pretty good, I will definitely get the Phil's fries next time (truffle fries with egg on top)The workers are very nice. One of workers I think his name was Hugo? I'm not sure.. Asked us how our meal was and my friend didn't really like what he ordered (soft shell crab poboy) so Hugo was nice enough to bring these samurai tacos for free to try. Pretty good.Overall the place is nice, There's a lot of seating inside the restaurant and an outside seating area! Service was quick and easy. I will be back to try other items on the menu! Highly recommended."
"I came here for the first time a few days after moving to Chicago, with a friend and her Mom who offered to pay for everything.  At first, like the nice, responsible young man I am, I ordered the cheapest tacos on the menu (which is saying a lot, the place is not expensive at all).  Everything was phenomenal.The fried fish on the Big and Little signature taco was perfectly crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside.  I also had the samurai taco, and a side of the truffle fries.  The restaurant offers po boys, burgers, and other odd assortments as well, and while they are all very tasty options, the tacos are definitely the focal point.  After finishing my cheap food, my friend's mom - a very lovely lady - gave me her ahi tuna taco because she was full.  The experience that followed was life changing.  The tuna was high grade and absolutely delicious; it blended perfectly with that sauce used in the taco, and was/is/forever will be one of my favorite things in Chicago.  Afterwards, the lovely lady of a mom offered to get us seconds, and I became somewhat of an opportunistic ass and let her buy me four more ahi tuna tacos.  Oh well.  I'm poor and paralyzed under a pile of crippling student loan debt.  It was worth it.The restaurant is cute, but can get busy and is loud.  I'd recommend coming during non ""rush"" hours to avoid the crowds.  The place is also BYOB, which adds a fun lil spin to your meal.  It's counter-style ordering, so interactions with the staff are limited to ordering your food and picking it up from the kitchen staff after they call out your name.  However, it is very obvious that the staff all enjoy their job.  The order guy even calls me buddy, which I usually find patronizing and condescending, but I'm all about it.  The only downside is that Guy Fieri ate there once :("
"I never thought I could say this to another cuisine other than food from My country, but after Eating here, i told my husband that taco should be the best food. We randomly ordered 3 tacos and they all tastes amazingly good. The crab burger was the bomb. Next time i'll get 2 of them just to get the extra crab! During lunch, it was very crowded and the wait is long, like 30 minutes. And the problem is they dont tell you how long. I guess that's something they can improve."
Foie gra dog yummy . Brings back memories of Avondale Hot Dougs. Hot dog was good charcoals foie gra was amazing the bun would have been good toasted with garlic butter.
"Big & Littles was definitely a great surprise! Location and Ambiance:The location is average at best, but the ambiance is everything you would expect!!Food:Cheap, delicious, and unique! Really great food, highly recommend asking for recommendations depending on what kind of food you want. Staff:The staff was fantastic, and helped us pick some delicious food. In summary, definitely give this a shot!Thanks,Connor Brady"
"Business trips to world-class foodie cities require frequent excursions to the cool eating places (which are almost always outside of convention center boundaries and accessible only by gritty subway route).So for me on this trip to the Windy City, that meant a visit to an upstart hipsterized burger and taco joint, Big and Little's. The two-restaurant mini-chain got its start from two guys (cue ""Big"" and ""Little"") who got the itch to open a place of their own.Big and Little's does all styles of tacos, burgers, po-boys, sandwiches, burritos, fries and fountain drinks. The Belmont location is industrial-chic, complete with blackboard overhead menus, knotty wood, brick and day-glo paint with silhouettes of the place's namesakes. It's a couple of blocks west of the CTA Red Line (only gritty during the rush and Cubs games, I'll bet).So enough of the trademark-Jay setup and on to the food! I went for three tacos (most styles $2.65). They're babies ... 3-4 bites at best ... but they pack major flavor punch and are bloody as hell (read: ""messy"" and ""requiring the roll of paper towels provided on each table""). I did up the Samurai, Grilled Shrimp and Mango Chutney styles. The Samurai featured fried whitefish, jalapeños and all kinds of nuclear sauces underneath a spread of sesame seeds. The whitefish was golden-fried and a substantial protein to stand up to all the sauce-age. The Grilled Shrimp got a touch of cocktail sauce to sass things up. The shrimps were standards (no jumbos here) but deliciously seasoned. The Mango Chutney featured seared pork, cilantro, pickled red onion (they figured prominently on top) and the chutney, which I wish had played a more leading role. Nevertheless, the shredded pork was a delight, with some burnt ends for character.The Truffle Fries ($2.25) got a nice, not overpowering, dash of truffle oil and salt. They may not be as crisp and long as some places' signature truffle fries, but they fearlessly faced up to my appetite and didn't blink.Big and Little's was well worth my bumpy, rush-hour cattle call on the Red Line from the Loop. While I wish the tacos were bigger, that doesn't in any sense diminish my wonderful experience and desire to return soon.Rock on, y'all. This Florida boy's happy."
"Deep fried heaven at last!! I had been waiting to try this place since I saw Guy Fieri take his first bite into the deep fried foie gras on The Food Network, and I will probably make it a regular stop whenever I'm in the Chicago area.  We came by on a Friday around 2pm so the place was not busy at all. Our food came so quickly it was ready before our friend was back with the cold beer from the liquor store up the street (it's BYOB here!) We ordered fish, softshell crab, fried shrimp, pork belly, kimchee and foie gras fries which were all great. I would highly recommend this place to the lover of the fryolated food varieties. They do have some non fried options as well which are also great. The service is quick and very friendly and the prices are very reasonable, especially for the quality. Don't miss out on this local gem!"
"Our order wasn't wrong, the food was just bad (and small). I'm surprised they have such high stars when their tacos were not at all good. The sauce overloaded the taste, no pineapple on the Hawaiian or Pastor...I couldn't even finish the shrimp taco - I only took 1 bite it was so bad. We were giving them a second chance, our first time they DID screw up the order and were late, which they made up for...but I feel the quality of food went down and I'm bothered I paid $30 for such small quantity and low quality. $3 tacos = no bueno."
"So pumped we came by BIG & little's on a Friday for lunch! The Belmont location has a homey feel and we encountered no wait when we came by. Immediately, the gentleman manning the register realized that we were a little lost. He was incredibly helpful in showing us how the menu is organized and recommending a few fan favorites. After debating and a little compromise, we approached the counter ready to order. For lunch, we went with a multitude of items including the shrimp taco, spicy pork taco, Japanese beef short rib, and Zeus burger. While everything was fresh and tasty, I have to say there were a few standouts. First, the Japanese beef short rib, which we weren't even going to order! Luckily, that helpful man at the counter pointed us to his favorite when we have one more taco to choose. The beef is so flavorful and tender, paired with jalapenos, this was by far our favorite taco. The Zeus burger is also fantastic. Burger WITH gyro, plus feta and egg? Not sure how this could be bad in the first place, but it's very well executed. The burger is cooked perfectly and all of the flavors go very well together. Overall, definitely recommend coming by BIG & little's! They have a unique menu with a ton of different options. Additionally, it's incredibly affordable and has a pretty awesome outdoor space. Easy to grab a table during lunch hours."
"I just had a remarkable meal @ Big & Littles.  I first heard about this restaurant on an episode of Mystery Diners.  My wife and I went to the location on Orleans.  Tonight we went to the location @ 1034 W Belmont.  We had a Groupon for a $20 dollar meal for $12 dollars.  We went a little over the $20 limit, but every item was a taste treat sensation.  If you have never eaten @ Big & Littles you need to go.  They have an incredibly creative  menu and they make tacos in an incredible variety of tastes, textures and ingredients.  We ordered all tacos tonight some seafood & some meat.  We ordered the following itemsSamurai Taco - Fried Whitefish, Jalapeño, lettuce, special sauce, samurai sauce, lime juice and sesame seeds Spicy Thai - Fried Whitefish, lettuce, tomato, spicy Thai sauce, lime Juice and sesame seedsShrimp - Fried or grilled Shrimp, lettuce tomato, special sauce, cocktail sauce & lime juiceAl Pastor - Seared Pork Belly, pineapple juice, red pickled onion, Queso Fresco & Special SauceMango Chutney - Seared Shredded Pork, pickled red onions, cilantro & Mango ChutneyJapanese Beef Short Ribs - Shredded beef short rib, Queso Fresco, Jalapeno, onion & Samurai SauceAND THE BEST FOR LASTRAW AHI TUNA TACO - Sashimi grade tuna, hard shelled Tortilla, ginger, chili paste, sesame seed oil, special sauce, samurai sauce & sesame seedsEvery item that we ordered was delicious.  Big & Littles has a huge menu and so much variety.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu."
"Great, friendly service.Quick.Inexpensive.Fresh and delicious.Need I say more?"
"Came here by default but it was the best thing that happened to us in CHICAGO!We wanted to try hot doug's since they were closing but the line was ridiculous. I don't know who would wait 2 hours for a hot dog. We yelped food places around the area and came across Big and Little's. I AM SO GLAD we came here!What we ordered: Fish and chips with truffle fry substitute Shrimp Banh MiSoftshell Crab Po BoyHot DogPhil's Fries (truffle fries with an egg on top)Raw Ahi Tuna Poke tacoEverything was amazing. There was not one thing that I didn't like. We had a large group of 15 girls for a bachelorette party. We met the owners and they were SO nice and accommodating. They even took a picture with us outside. If you're ever in the area, this spot is definitely worth checking out. Definitely try the truffle fries~!"
"I was excited to finally try this place and use my Groupon. I heard a lot of great things about it and did see it on Food Network. However, I found it to be a big letdown tonight after trying it. We ordered the Ahi Poke tacos, Samurai taco, Short Rib taco, hamburger and a hot dog for the kiddo. All the tacos were bland in flavor, especially the Poke. I was most disappointed in that because I heard such rave reviews about it. It was like eating a taco shell with a pile of plain, raw tuna in it. No flavor. If there was a sauce in it then there wasn't much in there, nor did it have any flavor. I've had authentic Poke from Hawaii and I think it's a LONG shot to call this Poke. Didn't even come close!The short ribs sauce was too sweet for my liking. Hubs and I both thought it was just ""eh"". The Samurai had the most flavor out of all the tacos but it still wasn't anything to go back for. The hot dog was wrinkly and shriveled up. Tasted like it was sitting out all day. They messed up our order and put cheese on the hamburger I ordered. I never said I wanted cheese. Thankfully the taste made up for it though. Out of everything we ordered, the hamburger was the best. But if I want a good burger I'm not going to Big & Littles. Tons of better places in the city to buy a burger. I don't understand the great reviews about this place. We thought it was mediocre food. Not worth it and won't return."
"Delicious tacos and BYOB. However, it gets SO loud in most evenings that it becomes impossible to have a conversation. They can improve the vibe of the place a little more, but the food is too good to pass."
"Holy shit why are you still reading this review? Go to Big and Little's NOW.It's a tiny little storefront on the corner of Belmont and Kenmore. You'd never know from the outside but it contains some of the tastiest goddamn food in the world and you're doing yourself a disservice every time you've gone past and not stopped in.Let's start with the staff. They're awesome. The place is constantly packed so the potential for grumpy staff is high, yet they're incredibly friendly and have no problem taking a moment to help you figure out what to order. They're knowledgable, funny, and most of all totally good at customer service. This place hires and trains well and it shows. The food takes forever and a day to come up but again, they're usually swamped with both in-house and delivery orders so I give them plenty of wiggle room there. And the food is worth it.So speaking of the food, it's plain outstanding. They lean toward fusion Asian/Mexican fare with playful combinations like their Spicy Pork Banh Mi Burrito and a wealth of Asian-inspired tacos, the Mango Chutney Pork taco being my favorite. They also have some Hawaiian fare like Poke but tuna's not really my thing so I can't speak to it personally. Still, I have yet to try anything on their menu that wasn't great so order a variety and you can't go wrong.You're not still reading this, are you? What the hell. GO."
This place sucked. I felt like I was in a food eating competition. Cheese in a cup? For my cheese fries?!? No thanks I'd rather have it on top. The tacos sucked too. Better places down the street if your drunk and hungry.
"I was really excited to try this place after reading the reviews & based on a friend's suggestion. Ordered the al pastor taco, mexican beef short rib and the truffle fries. The fries were pretty standard, truffle seasoning was fine, but our small basket seemed to contain way too many ""fry ends"" - a sure sign we got the last of the bag. Strike 1.  The mexican beef short rib taco was well seasoned, but a bit on the small side. The al pastor taco - my friend's favorite - was the real let down though. There were two HUGE chunks of 100% fat on my taco (Strike 2 and 3). I knew what I was getting into with the pork belly, but this was just disgusting. I pushed the chunks aside, scanned the taco for more fat, and ate the taco, but the damage was done. Fat aside, it just wasn't that great & I'm not sure I'll be back."
"Such a good place for tacos. There's so much variety and my friend and I struggled to decide what we each wanted to get. I ended up getting the ahi tuna, al pastor and the short rib. The tacos were really good, especially for the price. If you've been to Big Star, the tacos here are a different good and you'll most likely enjoy these tacos as well. I definitely want to make it back here (and I really have no excuse since I live pretty close) but there's so many more options on the menu that I'd probably spend another day deciding what I wanted to order for my next visit."
Since I love tacos I decided to buy a Groupon for this place and it was completely worth it. A lot of food options. I was definitely in taco heaven. So many choices that I am pretty sure I will be coming back again soon. Had three tacos that included the raw ahi tuna taco which was very tasty. Meat was a little dry on one of the other tacos so I was a little disappointed. Great service at the register!
"Overdue review, since I've visited this location enough times throughout 2014. And since it finally was the location which allowed me to plow through almost all of B&L's menu, for the most part. Even to the point where the main person working the counter(Omar), started to recognize me. Go figure!I can't really think of any minor reasons to ding this place any slight star, including the fact there will infrequently be some hip hop song or 2 I don't care for on their iPod(or whatever they use for the music here), so I'll go with 5 here. And it even eliminates 2 disadvantages of the original Orleans location, which is not opening on Sunday, and not taking cards. And only created one new one(lack of parking that isn't paid, and not much non-permit parking), but that doesn't surprise me as most of Lake View has always had that issue.On to the food. Really just about anything you try here, is going to be enjoyable. My personal favorite items on their menu are the fish tacos(who says you can't find a good fish taco in town?), and the meat tacos are also just as good. (and don't worry Taco and Burrito House by Fullerton/Ashland, which was my first fish taco love. I still think you're great, all these years later) The burgers, po boys, and burritos I've tried were also decent. To get more specific, the Samurai, Banh Mi, and Hawaiian Pork tacos were my favs, and the Zeus and Al Pastor burgers were both great. And my fav items from the Orleans location can still be ordered here, such as the Soft Shell Crab Po'Boy.I hope they do eventually take cards and open on Sundays at the original Orleans location, but that's a rant for another time. I just hope the quality at here and Orleans continues to hold up, when they open their 3rd location on Milwaukee Ave. in late spring/early summer 2015. Crossing fingers they never go the franchise route, and keep up the high standards."
"Be prepared to wait in line, but it goes pretty fast. Service is great and everyone who works there is super friendly! Soft shell crab po boy is really good! I think most people look at the pictures and are surprised to see that it's smaller than they expected, but it's a pretty good size regardless. Lightly battered soft shell crab...so yummy! Instead of fries, I shared half a foie gras hot dog  with a friend. Yes, doesn't look that appetizing when you see it, but tastes yummy! You have to like foie though...it's fatty/buttery gooodness."
"When I first saw Big & little's I didn't know it was a restaurant but while eating at a Mexican Restaurant across the street my friend and I decided to Yelp it and we saw all the great reviews.We decided that we would go over and check it out.  I'm so glad we did the moment we walked in the cashier was welcoming and asked if we had ever been there before and gave us some suggestions when we told him we just came from across street.We decided to taste the ahi tuna taco although we were not very hungry but it was small enough that both of us were able to get two bites a piece and we know that this is a place we would like to come back to for sure and explore more of their food items.I can't wait to sink my teeth into the soft shell crab po' boy, truffle fries, pork belly tacos and so much more.If you are in the area I say check them out..I know I'm going back and I can't wait!Enjoy!!"
"I took Wayne H'a recommendation to eat here before a show at the Vic. My man & I loved it! Max took our order and was phenomenal. He helped us through our first-time-here-what-should-we-order stress AND told us it was BYO and that a liquor store was just down the block. (directly east, btw) We came back with coronas and a lime - and he didn't blink when we asked for a knife - he just had the kitchen cut it! And lent us a bottle opener.Anyway onto the food:ahi tuna taco - awesome (esp if you love sushi)carnitas - awesome. this slight crispness to the pork was a phenomenal texture shrimp taco was just alright - too much sauce for my liking.my man loved the hawaiian poke, too.yum!! we 'll be back, and we'll high five Max if he's there."
"I really like this place, I usually only go when they have a groupon but it's pretty great. The only complaint I have is their burgers are too thin for the buns to be that huge. They're tasty but I end up eating the burger and tossing the bun to the side. The tacos I've had are all pretty good. And the fries are okay, just a little on the greasy side. The po-boys are delicious too!I recommend this place if you like tacos and seafood!"
"This place was short walk from the condo we rented in Wrigleyville/Lakeview.  It sits right next to Giordano's (on the corner).  We popped in here for lunch and sampled several things from the menu.  I went with a variety of tacos while the hubby tried a double cheese burger with cajun fries and the stepson tried just a plain cheeseburger and fries.  I loved the tacos I tried (spicy pork, mango and short rib).  They all had a great variety of flavors going on, but the mango chutney was by far the best flavor.  The burgers had hand formed patties and looked huge!  I really liked the food.  My only complaint is they brought the food out as it was ready, so I got 1 taco at a time, then one of the burgers came out, then the next then the fries.  That was totally bizarre to me!  I would recommend.  It is a low key place with good food at a good price!"
"hands down, best tacos in chicago"
"I try not to review a place after one stop but I will guarantee my return to this Lakeview gem.Big and Little's is what I'd call new American cuisine, a fusion of Chicago street food, Mexican, Asian, and Southern favorites. The menu consists of: tacos, burgers, po' boys, burritos, fried seafood, sandwiches, dogs, and fries. The restaurant boasts high ceilings to support the acoustics of annoying young adults and their meaningless conversations trying to talk over the searing sounds of the open kitchen. A large pastel yellow wall adorning the ""Big & Little"" contour with hints of Chicago flag creates a nice contrast to the old style ceiling. Painted brick, exposed metal, and disco jams create a comfortable ambiance for noshing on quality grub.For this trip I decided to do what any sane person would do with a menu so large - order tacos! Very fairly priced at under $3 a piece I opted for the Japanese Beef Short Rib, Tilapia (fried), and Al Pastor along with fries; of course. This was not enough food for my 6'2"" 190 lb appetite but a great introduction to a place I've wanted to try for a long time. The Al Pastor was on point. The special sauce added an unfamiliar flavor which was a nice divergence from the staple pineapple flavor. The samurai sauce on the short rib did a great job of unifying the meat with the jalapeno. I was not impressed with the Tilapia. I chose the fried option which I had to peel back some of the breading, overwhelmed by carb attack I'm trying to avoid (with little luck). The fish was a little fishier than I'm accustomed too, though it was not bad. The cabbage, special sauce and lime really rounded out the fishiness quite well. Next time, I'll likely get two tilapia (fried and grilled) to see if this was a one-time occurrence or a trend with their procurer. Regardless I suspect the grilled would be the better choice but my gluttony won this time. The fries were a smaller portion than I expected but for under $2 it was well worth it. They use a coarse type sea salt which emphasizes the real potato flavor rather than hiding poor quality ingredients like many other places will. On my next trip (which will likely be soon) I intend to explore some more tacos, a burger and the Cajun fries. Despite the almost mediocre Tilapia I'm still giving them a 5 in hopes this was a fluke - no pun intended."
"I've ordered delivery from Big & Little's several times and have a couple of go-to items: the Raw Ahi Tuna Tacos and the Samurai Tacos are so delicious!  I've been less impressed with the Al Pastor taco as well as the truffle fries, which were soggy (not sure if this was due to them being delivered versus freshly cooked so will need to try them again).  Delivery is unpredictable in terms of timing.  The first couple of times I received my orders in less than 30 minutes but last week, I was waiting over 90 minutes, and my order wasn't quite right when I finally received it  This may have been a Grub Hub issue more than Big & Little's."
"On a recent visit to Chicago, not long after getting picked up from the airport, the suggestion was thrown out to get some tacos.  Now I don't really ever think there's a time that's NOT good for tacos, but somewhere in the back of my mind, I kind of wanted to be a tourist and go get some Italian beef or a deep dish pizza, or some other touristy crap that Chicago is synonymous for, but I also don't care that much, so tacos sounded like a fine idea, and I didn't really set my hopes up too high for something that was really out of the ordinary.Funny how things work out, because Big & Little's absolutely killed it.  Knocked it completely out of the park, and even over the shrewd ballhawks' heads.When we were walking our way down Belmont, I snickered because I thought I saw a sign that said ""BIG (mammary glands)"" because of some convenient obscuring of the sign by a lamp post.  That's when my friend had pointed out that BIG (mammary glands) was actually where we were going.  I blamed poor eyesight for the Fruedian mirage, and tried to contain my excitement at going to BIG (mammary glands).Entering Big & Little's, it's a pretty straight-forward place that doesn't even bother trying to put up a pretense that they're anything other than a place to eat, which I appreciate.  There are a few tables and even fewer small booths, and the place probably seats like 20-25 people tops.  But from what I can surmise, they make a good bit of business on the delivery/takeout aspect, which seems awesome, because if I lived near here, I'd probably capitalize on both, regularly.The menu has a wide variety of tacos, as well as non-tacos, but since I was told we going to get tacos, I was going to get some tacos.  I ended up getting a grilled mahi mahi as well as Hawaiian pork, along with some fries.  And just because, the guy that apparently was in charge, who was wearing the shirt that said BIG hooked us up with some extras, on account of me being such a touristy noob from out of town.  None of the tacos were remotely considerable as overpriced; I've certainly paid more for inferior tacos in the past, and have nothing to complain about with these.I mean, everything about the dining experience was pretty perfect.  I'm so used to tasteless flour tortillas, that it's always somewhat of a pleasant surprise when I get served on corn tortillas, and I was pleased to see that Big & Little's seems to default with corn.  Needless to say, everything I ate was kind of perfect.  The Hawaiian pork was super flavorful and delicious, and the grilled mahi mahi was also excellent, and was not drowned out by slaws or sauces.Not to go ignored, I really, really appreciate the fact that they put each taco in their own little basket; far too often, I've been served multiple tacos in one plate/tray, and their stuff gets mixed up, or juices from one drip onto another, and so forth.  Big & Little's seems to know what's up, and doesn't even let that become a possibility.  Also free fountain drink refills; that should never go unnoticed.Overall, Big & Little's was pretty much perfect.  A no-nonsense atmosphere, awesome and friendly workers, excellent food, and most definitely not at all expensive.  I wouldn't just come back here, I'm pretty sure I'd demand to come back here the next time I'm up in Chicago again."
"The tacos are awesome, But I just got delivery and none of them were labeled and we didn't get all the food we ordered. :/ So I probably won't go the delivery route again."
"This is the reason why I visited Chicago, and it will be the reason why I go back.Pork belly po boy - Omg, the crisp of the pork belly, mounting in this po' boy.  I don't usually like pickles, but it totally works in this sandwich.  They are thick and crunchy.Foie gras on fries - Divine, simply divine.  And the fries with foie gras grease--amazing!!Soft shell crab po boy - da bomb!!!  This was the most memorable thing I ate here.  Deep-fried crab goodness!  The first bite was like angels singing from above."
"OH. MY. GOODNESS.Quite arguably one of the best joints I've been to since moving here.  I just HAD to get the dogs (recommended from a friend in the city), and having done so, the dance of tantalized tastebuds occurred, and it was an extended remix!!!The food was just right, and the music (80-90's NYC & East coast hip-hop) was on the speakers, and it was good to hear it once again.It's a great location just past the Belmont L stop RIGHT past Sheffield.  I highly HIGHLY recommend these guys!!"
"Creative variety of tacos, burritos, burgers and all things fast food in an upscale twist. The owner Mr. Big and little's was there engaging with customers and cracking jokes. I got the Honky burrito. It's got deep fried pork belly, fries, red cabbage, pickles and 2 kinds of sauce. It's good and crispy on the first few bites, love food when it's hot out the kitchen. Pork belly is way too tough that finishing the last few bites was getting to become a workout. I prefer my pork belly soft and fatty cooked for hours, deep fried pork belly chunk, yeah, not for me, but I'll keep trying. When there is a line, it is quite a wait for both ordering and receiving."
"Yes! So happy this little joint is in my neighborhood. Perfect for lunch or a casual dinner and oh, so delicious! I've tried many of the tacos and here are a few of my faves: gyro taco, banh mi taco, grilled shrimp taco, truffle fries w/egg on top, oh AND EVERYTHING ELSE. They're also BYOB- so grab a 6 pack/bottle of wine and head on over."
"Delicious food that won't break the bank. I am a big fan of their tacos, the samurai and the Japanese short rib are definite stand outs. The place is especially great if you can get in at an off time and have the restaurant to yourself."
"My bf and I have been here several times and we love it. We would like to try out the whole menu! The Pork belly Po boy was just OK but their tacos are great.  Shrimp Po boy was good.We have tried almost all the tacos, never disappoint us. Must go!"
"Warning: its near Wrigleyville and it can get crazy crowded at good spots at night.  We came on a Saturday night and the line was out the door.  Always a good sign for me! Plus the they had a stream of good music playing the whole time.  TIP: we popped into the 1000 liquors to grab a 6pack of beer. Ordered the Poke (Ahi) Tacos and the Fish & Chips.  The food came out relatively quickly, I think they had like 6 people jammed in that tiny little kitchen.  The Poke Tacos were great!  I was concerned for the price, $5 that it would not be worth the price.  I was wrong on the value, the taco was stuffed with ahi and was great!  The fish & chips was a solid meal as well.  However, the show stopper was my roommate's pork belly sandwich.  That thing was straight umami with each bite.  I am even planning on my next visit so I get that!  I am happy I came by and worried about how often I will go back."
"Ahi Poke taco, kimchi fries and a friggin' RIDICULOUS cheese burger. This place is awesome - did I mention the beauty of  BYOB???? Drop that bs subway sandwich or potbelly joke in trash and get you butt over to this spot to get your snack on"
"I'm shocked this place isn't 5 stars all around. BOMB tacos. BOMB staff. Need I say more? I come here at least once a month and I've genuinely liked everything I've tried from my usual ""Little's"" taco to Kimchi fries to the pinto bean taco. While the food is impeccable, major shout out to the cashier. That guy remembers everyone's name and order and even when it seems like the line is out the door, he makes conversation with everyone and never seems flustered. Two thumbs up."
"a restaurant is not always just about the food, service sets the mood before the food is ready. with that said, this location has the best service in addition to great food! thanks again omar!"
"Went to Big & Little's with a friend for lunch at noon on a Sunday. We didn't have to wait long to order at all but about 10 mins later there was a big rush and then another one 10-15 mins after that. This place gets busy a lot I take it but they do a good job handling it!I ordered the Hawaii Five-O burger and the Mahi taco. My friend got the soft shell crab poboy. We split a truffle fry. My food was really good! All of the meat was well cooked and the food was hot. I enjoyed the pineapple on the burger. The mahi taco was a great choice, I would recommend it. The crab poboy was good too my friend said. The truffle fry was okay, nothing special.Best thing about Big & Little's is the price. My burger and taco was only around $10 which is an awesome deal. Great place to grab food and go or sit outside when it's nice out. I'll definitely go back when I'm in the area!"
I can't stress how awesome this place is. The tacos are typical size but with tons of flavor! Each have their own delicious taste. Def try the Mango Chutney.
"Big and little's has some of the best tacos I've had in a long time! I've come a couple of times and tried a variety of items but I have to sing praise to the Al pastor, the Hawaiian pork, and the Spicy beef short rib. The Al pastor is awesome mainly because come on, pork belly in tacos? Win. All of their sauces are flat out amazing and compliment the meat very well. They have plenty of seafood tacos on the menu too but they drench the taco with an exorbitant amount of lettuce so it's difficult to eat. + Phil's fries - These are some of my favorite fries ever! The truffle flavor is right on and the fried egg on top is like a Christmas surprise. Solid solid solid. + Lovely staff - Omar who's sometimes at the counter taking orders is really friendly and fun to chat with. The other guys I've spoken with are all really nice and personable people too. After all that, why the 4 stars not 5? Okay, so the tacos are pretty darn small. At about $2.75 per, it really adds up especially when I'm hungry x100 and unfortunately, that's when I usually crave Big & little's. Bottom line: Superb food, great location, awesome staff, don't come when extra extra extra hungry."
"Who can resist the lure of hand-held food? Tacos, Po Boys, Burgers but done up in unique and impressive ways. If there is seafood tacos on the menu, I will always check it out--I blame my SoCal brother for that. If there is short-rib anything on the menu, I will always check it out--I blame trendy food trends for elevating the interest in short-ribs. If there is truffle fries on the menu, I will always check it out. I blame Yelp because I've never had truffle anything until I joined Yelp and started hanging out with new Yelp friends.Big & Little's does all of the above deliciously. My favorites are the Samaurai taco (Fried Whitefish, Jalapeño, Lettuce, Special Sauce,Samurai Sauce,Lime Juice, Sesame Seeds), the Shrimp Taco (Fried/Grilled Shrimp, Lettuce, Tomato, Special Sauce, Cocktail, Lime Juice), The Spicy Beef Short Rib taco (Seared Shredded Short Rib, Onion, Cilantro, Spicy Thai Sauce). And of course the truffle fries--upgrade it to the Phil's fries and they put a fried egg on it. Everything is made to order with fresh ingredients and at a very reasonable price (cheap!) Service is super friendly and I am a huge fan. They gave me a free taco on my birthday when Angela P mentioned we were out enjoying my birthday-- of course, I'm crushing on the counter guys now. Now you know the way to my heart--short rib tacos!"
"A lot of hype, but not that impressive. I've been here twice and I don't feel the need to give it a third chance because it's not that great. The first time I had the fried shrimp to go. Inside it was loud, slow, smoky, and the shrimp was the same quality as what you could find in a grocery store's frozen food aisle. The second time I dined in and decided to try the tacos that many people talk about.  Ehh, not so great and tiny portions. Raw Ahi Tuna Poke Taco- a hard shell taco filled will raw ahi tuna. The tuna is good with a few sesame seeds. A shell full of only raw tuna is a bit much, it needed another flavor or texture. Mahi- I got it grilled. The flavor was nice, but there was way too much sauce that was dropping out of the taco as I ate it. Shrimp- The first shrimp taco I've met that I didn't like. There was only one tortilla so it fell apart as soon as I picked it up. There were only like 3 small shrimp in the taco. It was mostly lettuce and cocktail sauce. Yuck."
"I've lived in Lakeview about 3 years now and when I found out Big and Littles was opening on my block, I was instantly much happier w my housing decision.I used to go to Big and Littles when it was just a small cabby joint in River North that served the best burgers and seafood in a few mile radius. In Lakeview they expanded the menu to include a wider selection of tacos (meat, seafood, veggie), po boys, and burritos all at very affordable prices for the quality. The food is fresh, well thought out, and made to order.Everything is a real great value (Ahi Tuna burger for under $10? hell ya) and now they serve a delicious, affordable breakfast menu all day. I rarely say this about food, but the Ahi Tuna Bahn Mi Po Boy changed my lifeTony, Omar, and the whole team really do a fantastic job pushing great quality and providing some of the friendliest service, especially in the fast paced quick service restaurant space. These guys get hospitality. This place is a true Chicago gem, you will not be disappointed"
So. Damn. Good.  Personal favorites are the Ahi Tuna and the Hawaiian Pork.
"I was a little skeptical when my husband suggested this for his birthday lunch because he has been known to choose some questionable establishments. This, however, was a total win. They weren't busy when we arrived (although it was packed by the time we left), so I was able to ask the girl taking orders for some recommendations. I decided to step a little outside of my comfort zone and go with the Zeus (burger, lamb, feta cheese, onion, tomato, and that Greek gyro sauce, all topped with a fried egg). It was amazing. I think I went through about 12 napkins though! That, along with some Cajun fries, made for one of the best lunches ever. The service was fast and friendly, and the prices were totally reasonable. Two burgers, two fries and two drinks for about $20. We will definitely be back."
"Stopped here on a Saturday at 615p and boy were we lucky to beat the crowd! By 630p the line was out the door and to the sidewalk! The cashier told us it would be like that through the rest of the night, and for the 40ish minutes we were there, it was. It was another good sign at how great the tacos might be.Ordered the following and listed them in order of greatness:Mahi (with Asian sauce)Steamed Blue CrabBig & Little's (whitefish standard with tartar sauce)Samurai (whitefish with jalapenos)Spicy Thai(My husband also tried the Lamb and the Hawaiian pork, he liked the Hawaiian pork best.)Only problem with the Samurai and Spicy Thai is they definitely had a ""fish"" taste to me that made it hard to just enjoy the tacos.These are semi-small tacos, about 5 bites each, so the price is great. For 7 tacos, as well as the Cajun fries and truffle fries, it cost us $24 for a Saturday night dinner together, great value."
"I've returned within the week and brought a large group and everyone loved everything, esp the peeps here! The owner recommended a selection of items to try for my second trip and I now like this place even more.Spicy pork taco - so flavorful! *Special rising sun samurai - the egg on top of the white fish worked so well. This is a bigger taco that's definitely more filling.Steam crab poke - very light and refreshing. It's completely packed with crab meat!"
"On my drive across the country I wanted to hit up at least one place I'd seen on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Big & Little's was it because I wanted to check out Chicago.For those with dietary restrictions, there ARE options (I'm dairy-free, gluten-free), though you'll probably have to modify your burger or taco as I did.  However, there's gonna be some cross-contamination because, as far as I saw, they just throw everything on the same griddle.  I had very minor digestive distress afterward. :D  That's good for eating out anywhere, let alone a dive joint.Food was great!  The burger was cooked perfectly.  The fried pork belly was slightly dry but beneath the burger, pineapple, and jalapenos, it was masked well.  Atmosphere is casual, guy at the counter was friendly.  Overall great experience!"
Excellent cheap food that doesn't sacrifice quality. Awesome atmosphere and they play great music. Spicy pork anything is worth getting!
"My friend and I came in to BIG & little's on a day when Chicago was being typical Chicago, i.e. cold and windy (and interspersed with rain and hail). Thankfully, the restaurant was cozy and warm. We'd spent a good deal of time earlier that day reading through the menu and having a hard time deciding what tacos to get (since there are about 20 kinds and they all look amazing), but we were prepared by the time we walked through the door.The person taking our orders at the counter was neither BIG nor little (he was wearing a shirt with the word ""HUGE"" embroidered over the pocket, though), but was very friendly and helpful. I decided to go with the Japanese beef short rib, the al pastor, and the shrimp tacos. For the shrimp, you have an option of getting it either fried or grilled - honestly, I can't even remember which I got, but it was amazing (and after my experience I trust that whichever the other option was would also be great). Also, pro tip: the tacos usually have two layers of tortilla as a shell, but they are pretty overstuffed with filling, so you can take one of the layers of tortilla and move some of the filling into it. Boom, two tacos that you can eat without spilling all over the place, for the price of one.We were wondering how the tacos would compare to Big Star - another favorite taco joint of ours - and the verdict was that while the food was on par (i.e. awesome), it was very different. Even if it was the same taco (I've tried the al pastor at both locations), the taste was distinct. What this basically means is that you need to go to both. BIG & little's has the edge over Big Star for me because it's both closer to me location-wise and less expensive, but both are great. I have no beef with more restaurants on my list of favorite restaurants. More good food = everyone wins. Yes?Swing by BIG & little's for your taco craving (and really, your burger, banh mi, sandwich, and various other foodstuffs craving)! Come hungry and try everything - I know I'll be back, maybe for the Phil's fries or the pork belly po' boy next time."
"LAMB BURRITO IS THE BEST, with great seasoned potatoes. That is all!"
"What a fabulous gem! Love that there's a location on the north side. The food is delicious, that's a given. The thing that impresses me most is the upbeat, team atmosphere between the staff. Even when they are busy as hell, which is usually, they are friendly, welcoming and respectful....not only to their customers but to one another. Aaannnddd there's someone always sweeping the floor and wiping tables between customers. The US needs more establishments like this. And did I mention the food? Great tacos!!!"
Some of the best tacos around here. Loved the samurai taco and the Hawaiian 5-0 burger. The price is just as good.
"I don't think there is anything bad I can say about BIG & little's.  I've been wanting to check it out for YEARS now, and had no idea they opened a second location.After a debacle of a meal the week prior (WAY too pricy for what it was at another place,) we were once again headed into the city for a night out.  My man knows I love Food Network and The Cooking Channel (he does not,) but occasionally Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives or Unique Eats will catch his eye.  He said to me ""why can't we ever go to one of THOSE type places.""So... knowing BIG & little's has been on DDD and that I'd been wanting to check it out, I tasked him with finding someplace, hoping he would stumble upon BIG & little's, and by the grace of the Food Gods, he did.We entered at just the right time and walked up to the counter with no wait.  Ordered a burger, soft shell crab po'boy, two al pastor tacos, and an order of truffle fries.Food came out quickly and was MEGA delicious.  The al pastor is not traditional, but the menu clearly tells you that.  The po'boy was fantastic, the crab was a little small and the roll was a little large, but hey, this isn't New Orleans, and we don't pull soft shell crabs outta the lake.My man devoured his burger and taco, and we gladly shared the fries.The best part?  Aaaaaand the part that the BF raved about for the next three days?  The two of us ate a delicious, filling, made-to-order meal, for $26.  Can't be beat!"
I had the fish & chips with the whitefish. Really good. Not too greasy at all. My friend had the classic shrimp poboy. It was really good. Their homemade sauce is good too. The place in general is really good & they have a wide variety of tacos & burritos & poboys. We noticed a lot of people eating the tacos. So we also tried the Mexican braised beef tacos. Really good! I will definitely be back to try more!
"Tonight I am enjoying an amazing dinner delivered from BIG & little's Restaurant.  Appetizer - Japanese beef short rib taco with all the fixings and pickled onions. Entrée - I went with a simple cheeseburger with everything and Merkt's cheddar cheese, an integral part of my childhood on the North Shore of Chicago. A perfectly simple dinner done incredibly well. ~Jonathan"
"The girl at the counter who took our order could not have been nicer or more helpful.  It was all downhill from there.Resist the urge to try the soft shell crab po'boy.  In fact, avoid all po'boys at this location.  They are nothing more than bread and sauce.  We got the crab po'boy and the shrimp bahn mi po'boy and you could barely taste the meat.  When were done, we had 3/4 of the bread left and the shrimp and crab were gone.  We filled up on bread.  The tacos tasted okay but were very small and loaded with lettuce and sauce.  Therefore, even though we order three different ones, they all tasted the same.We also got the truffle fries.  Neither my wife nor I were familiar with truffle oil and she did not notice any difference.  I could taste the flavor when eating the fries separately, but if you eat your fries and sandwich at the same time, you'll hardly notice the truffle factor.  Another item to avoid.Our total was almost $30 for three tacos, two po'boys and an order of fries, also very small.  I would not have gone here if I didn't have a Groupon and we won't be back.I have no clue what all the people raving about this place were eating here.  As we were diving into the soft shell crab po'boy I asked my wife what she thought.  She responded, 'it doesn't taste like anything'.  I could not have said it better myself.I guess hype has a very powerful effect on the human mind."
"I went here for the first time today. I've heard a few friends talk about this place and knew it had been featured in some food shows. Bought the groupon and decided to try it with a friend. The Hawaiian burger was delicious. So messy that you can't put it down, but so tasty you won't want to.Truffle fries- amazing. What's not to like?My friend had a spicy beef short rib and Big & Little tacos. She said they were both really good.Shrimp taco- 3 sauces w/ grilled shrimp was delicious. Taco was served with too much lettuce making it too full for the tortilla and messy, which I guess really isn't a problem at a place like this.Japanese Beef short rib- the meat was really good and perfectly tender. The taco was a little dry and not very saucy. After our meal the manager came by asking if it was our first time and what we thought. I told him everything was delicious but the Japanese short rib taco seemed a little dry. He said it wasn't supposed to be like that; it should have plenty of sauce. Next thing we know he appears with another taco. And this one had the right amount of sauce and flavor. Superb. He also brought a Spicy Pork taco for us. I'm not a huge pork fan but this was a delicious taco.  I would personally prefer if the spicy Thai sauce were spicier, but it's clearly to appeal to a wider variety of palettes. I believe if something is labeled spicy it should be nose-runningly spicy. Overall delicious American-fusion food, wonderful and unique menu with amazing service and staff. Definitely will be back here!"
"We were excited to go check out the place after seeing all the yelp reviews and saw that the place was on DDD. The staff was nice but we were a little disappointed with the food. Our favorite was tuna poke taco and that was the only thing we liked! We tried Spicy thai, lamb, carnitas, and big & littles. they were all just ok, nothing memorable. The staff recommended us to try pork belly poboy. it was probably the worst thing we had there. Pork belly was deep fried. Though it was crispy, it was way too dry in my opinion, with bread and some lettuce. It simply didn't cut it for us. We were disappointed."
"It is not the first time that I have written about my love of fish tacos and my search in chicago for the ultimate one.  In some ways I found it in the Poke taco.  A hard shell filled to the brim with raw ahi tuna and a creamy sesame sauce.  Holy moly!  That is the taco I will keep coming back for.  The other tacos are above average.  I love the selection of fish tacos with a banh mi and a spicy thai option.  It is fun to experiment . The classic big and little's is the type of battered fish that I crave in my fish tacos.  The breading was a little soggy, and I like it super crisp, so while the texture misses the mark for my personal ideal fish taco, the flavor was there.  Go during the day for lunch when it is peaceful.  Weekend nights, you'll find a line to the door.  Speaking of Hey customers....this is for you!  If you look around and notice there is a line to the door and people are standing holding food and you are done eating and drinking and are just sitting there for 30 extra minutes talking....it would be very civil of you to pick up and move on to another location to continue your conversation.  It doesn't take long to eat 3 tacos and some fries...make room for the rest of us who want to enjoy the experience as well."
"After going to the other Big & Littles near the loop, I had hopes that this experience would be the same or better. Unfortunately this location really couldn't compare. While it seems like prices and portions are less at this location, the flavor and quality is also sacrificed. I had the shrimp and chips. There were just a few shrimp, and they forgot to include our truffle fries. I also got two tacos which were poorly put together and lacking in flavor and actual toppings. Our food was about room temperature by the time we got it.Overall, go downtown for the real deal. That location does it right."
"So my fiance and I went here with a Groupon with high expectations from all the good reviews but left unimpressed. We sampled a variety of the tacos but couldn't really tell any of the fish ones apart. They were fried with a bunch of sauce and some veggies. One of the fried fish tacos was soggy and the fish inside was kind of wet and mushy. I passed that one on to my fiance who will eat almost anything :p The grilled Mahi was overcooked or something because it was super tough and chewy (passed that one along too).  I actually enjoyed the beef and pork tacos more because there weren't just a soggy pile of stuff. We tried the fries and they were soggy as well and the serving size was rather small for the price. The one good thing was the service though. The lady taking our order was super friendly and even though there was a line, made us feel welcome."
"Visiting from Los Angeles and my sister's roommates said that I HAD to come here. Long story short, i was not disappointed!"
"I have been going to the Big & Little's at the River North location and I happened to be around the area. I figured since I have the Groupon and I am here, might as well just try this location. Parking was pretty easy to find on a Tuesday night. The lines were long, but the guy working in cashier in the front was extremely friendly. We noticed right away that the prices at this location is much much cheaper than the River North location. When the food came, everything tasted just as good as the River North location. I think I will come back here in the future as everything here is priced much lower for the same quality."
"Wow! Go here. I can't believe how tasty and fresh everything is. My wife ordered three tacos and I got four. We were told they are kind of small, but they are actually a good size. Everything we got was amazing. Shrimp, ribs, crab, mahi mahi, lamb gyros, porkNot only were the ingredients great on their own, but the sauce they added were fantastic."
"If it were possible, I'd give this place 6 stars. It's absolutely my favorite place to eat in Chicago.Simply put, they just know how to do it right. Their food is freshly cooked to your specific preference, and I have yet to try one dish that I won't crave for the next week after. They have such a large menu, with options for every type of eater. Not to mention, for the amazing quality and flavor of their food, they could easily charge way more than they do. The prices are seriously fantastic, which shows a lot about their ownership. You can tell they're in this industry not only because they really believe in their product, but because they value honorable service and want to make their customers happy. Omar, or ""Huge"" as you might know him, might genuinely be the nicest person I've ever met. You can tell he really cares about every person that walks through the door, and he will go out of his way to make sure that you have a great experience. He's clearly a hard worker, and very dedicated to making this business successful.All in all- amazing food, fantastic service and employees, and prices you can't beat. I love this place! Just go- you won't regret it."
"I just placed my order for 7 different seafood tacos from their menu, and the owner that rang me up was such a personable guy. Talk about making your customers feel welcome! As for the food, excellent quality as this is the second time coming here. I used a Groupon, and it was definitely worth it! The line was long on a Friday evening, but for good reason since the food is great! Everyone should try this place."
Lunch for five. We found the food tasty but unnecessarily greasy and not as warm as we'd like. Very busy. Priced OK. We didn't hate it.
"God I love this placeI don't know what I love more, the food or the customer service.Omar (Huge) has gotta be the coolest dude in lakeview. I go back regularly just for the customer service he brings.Awesome spot, can't wait to see this expand to further locations, Tony and Gary know what they are doing!!"
"This place is always consistent with food and service.Huge is amazing and could run the front of the house in any four star upscale restaurant but brings that experience to Big & Little's .Great place, try it if you haven't."
"Must go back to try everything on their menu.Had the soft shell crab po boy, Japanese beef short rib taco, raw ahi tuna taco, and the carnitas pork taco. They were all very delicious. The crab could have been bigger, but nonetheless, had great flavor and was very satisfying. While some of their components are fried and certainly not the healthiest, nothing was overly greasy or too heavy. All ingredients were very fresh and vibrant. Also, while everything was flavorful, nothing was too salty, which is a common hindrance of many other places. Each taco (and I assume the other items) seems to be very well thought out, cohesive and well balanced.What I loved even more than their food was their service. My food was ready to be picked up at the counter and the guy saw that I was struggling and he apologized that he should have just brought the food to my table in the first place. The guys there were genuinely very happy and excited and helpful.Extremely tasty elevated diner/street food and one of the best services I've ever experienced (others, take note)! Can't wait to come back!"
"Yesterday was my first time here and it was a great experience. One of the guys working there (I think the owner) was very accommodating and even fixed my order of fries that I ORDERED wrong. I offered him more money and he wouldn't take it. I ordered truffle fries when in fact I wanted the Phil's truffle fries that come with the sunnyside egg. Everything we ordered was pure perfection except the foie dog. Maybe my hopes were set too high? The bun was cold and horrible and they jammed so much cold foie on top of the dog that I was just eating cold foie on a cold/dry hot dog bun. Heat my buns! Heat the foie! And maybe take some out? I LOVE FOIE, but it was overwhelming, especially with that bun. Everything else was DELICIOUS! My pork belly po'boy was super tasty and the truffle fries I never wanted to end. My friend got the shrimp banh mi which he devoured in 2 seconds and the foie dog, which he let me have a bite of. At the end that was the only thing that was left to eat and we couldn't finish it all due to the make up of the whole thing. If they tweak it a little, it could be perfection. I need the steamed bun!!!I will return to tackle the tacos on the menu with my boyfriend. The people around us ordered the ahi and the soft shell crab tacos and I wish I had a bottomless pit so I could have sampled all of their food yesterday! So happy to come back to try more deliciousness and also really looking forward to it!"
"Pretty solid. The blue crab taco was my favorite. I just wished the truffle fries had a bit more flavor to them.....but, I'LL BE BACK!"
"I like this new location better for so many reasons. It's more convenient; near the Belmont stop. It's more affordable. They accept credit cards. And the space has a better, connected vibe. All that and you still get the same two super nice guys who are foodies at heart and love to talk Chicago food with you. I think their tacos excel over their sandwiches. The breads on the sandwiches never ""feel"" quite right. Too puffy, too big, not enough crunch. Etc. Goldilocks would not be pleased. But their tacos - mmm, I haven't had a bad one yet and I'd fight Goldilocks for the Ahi tuna taco! It's brilliant in its simplicity and I could eat 20 of them. My goal is to eat my way through the taco menu. Stay tuned for taco updates."
"This is such a cool taco joint! I love this place! Everything is amazing here: the food, the service and the sauces. Don't be intimidated by the long line, and the packed tables. You will find a place to enjoy your meal by the time you get your food. This is a BYOB joint, so don't forget to grab some drinks before you stop by here. Order the Samurai, Big and Little and the Soft Shell Crab Tacos and you will fall in love."
Amazing Tacos with some creative ingredient combinations..A star off for the cramped up place . 45 mins for pickup as well ! Can get pretty crowded during the weekends
"A 3-star-sorry with a promise for a chance to follow up.I traveled here with a few friends hungry and excited.  As lovers of everything soft shell crab we have had BIG & little's on our radar for some time.It was earlyish on Saturday and there was a line.  We were in the way of everyone, but the wait wasn't unbearable.  The staff was definitely working hard to move things along.  We lucked out and nabbed a booth just before we put our order in.  The space is pretty crowded and though we were boothed it was probably too small for 4 dudes.  The person at the table behind me kept opening their bag which would inevitably fall on my back / etc making for awkward apologies, but it must have been weird for them to have my back right above their plate.  I guess what I'm trying to say is to be prepared to get ""cozy"" if you are eating in.We had a pretty decent order overall, but I was very excited about the soft shell crab po' boy, ahi tuna taco, spicy Thai taco, Hawaiian taco, and Phil's fries that made up my portion.  When it came to eating though, my lustful eyes fell to slight disappointment.I started with the raw ahi tuna taco.  As a huge sushi lover and a gigantic fan of Poke when available I was really excited here.  I'm not sure why this is under a Poke section, as traditionally this is more than just a cut of fish (IE - a meat salad of sorts).  All I tasted was tuna in a cheap hard taco.  A really nice lightly fried flour shell or something else to add anything (some small amount of oil and avocado or something to make this Poke) to what was going on would be really nice here.  Simplicity is great, but I'd rather just have the tuna than have it in the taco, and in that situation I'd just rather not.  Moving on to the spicy Thai taco which looked gorgeous with its sesame seeds on a simple preparation... but all I could taste was the Thai sauce (similar to Mae Ploy).  It was hard to tell with the lettuce on top, but I think this taco had drowned in itself.  Moving on to the Hawaiian left another pretty, but underwhelming taco that didn't taste like much, and didn't have much in it either.On to the shrimp po' boy which, once again, looked absolutely beautiful but left me wishing for more flavor.  I don't know at this point if I was on the flavor disappointment train or what, because the crab was tasty but in sandwich form all I really tasted was lettuce.  Finally I moved on to the Phil's fries that I was super excited about after reading that it was truffle fries with a fried egg - a nearly perfect sounding combination.  I also love everything truffle and make truffle fries / popcorn / mac 'n cheese at home.  Once again these fries and their egg looked beautiful, but the egg was a bit too firm (the yolk was only a bit creamy, and to be fair it may have cooked itself slightly as we ate for ~5 minutes) and didn't do much when we tried to pop the yolk.  There wasn't a hint of truffle flavor with or without an attempt at the little bit of yolk to go around.  Bummer.Big ups for the cashier not ripping me off when I accidentally handed him 2 x $20s instead of 2 x $10 bills.  The menu is pretty comprehensive for foodie treats, so I feel like B&l needs another chance.  The beautiful way everything was presented and the general review of other Yelper's has me convinced I must have gotten a bad rap, so I'll go back and try a burger and a couple of other options when I have a chance."
"Little being the operative word.  I had the Shrimp Po Boy, and while the sauce was tasty, the sandwich was very small.  The fries were little scraps of potatoes.  They should have been ashamed to serve them."
"I usually don't write reviews after one visit to a place, but I couldn't wait to talk about this place. The food was so good!!!Per Guy's DDD review, we had to stop in on our way downtown with my hubby & our BAD Boyz. Since the original River North location is closed on Sundays, we opted for this 2nd location. Nice surprise, this location accepts credit cards!The pretty cashier greated us with a big smile and she explained the day's specials and ingredients of the burgers or tacos that were popular. There were plenty of tables available inside & out, since we were there just before 4pm yesterday. Maybe because the Roscoe Village Fest was going on down the street, the place was pretty empty.B ordered the Al Pastor Burger(fried pork belly), which was ""VERY good"", he said. A ordered the Big & Little's(fried whitefish burger) which he ""really liked a lot"", and D ordered the Cheeseburger that was ""pretty good"". D usually never finishes anything, so it was a good sign when he didn't leave anything in his basket. The BAD Boys shared orders of Truffle Fries and Cajun Fries. We voted the seasoned Cajun Fries to be better than the Truffle Fries.I ordered the Softshell Crab Po'Boy, of course, and my hubby the day's special, Ahi Tuna Steak Po'Boy and a Ahi Tuna Taco(he loves his fish raw if fresh). We shared and they were all very, very tasty.However, we felt the portions were too small. It was more like a big snack than a decent meal. (After just two hours at the Lake, the BAD Boys wanted dinner.) Next time, we'll have to order some more fries and tacos to go along with our burgers and po'boys.The burgers($5.95) were a little larger than sliders(I don't think even 1/4 pound). We didn't see ""make any burger a double +$1.95"" until after the meal. The Softshell Crab(baby crab) Po'Boy is $7.95(worth the money, tho) and Raw Ahi Tuna Steak Burger was also $7.95. The snack-sized tacos are $2.65 each, but Raw Ahi Tuna Poke we had was $4.95(two bites). Fries are $2.25 per order and fountain drinks $1.89 including refills, self service.Next time(yes, we will definitely return), we'll bring some beers, since BYOB.Prices are good considering the quality of the food(not quantity), the taste is amazing, and very friendly employees. However, the portions we thought were too small and street parking only, so therefore, 4.5 stars.I wish this place wasn't so far away from the burbs. I want to try the rest of Big & Little's menu~ all of it!"
This is one of the better taco joints in Chicago. Prices are ok but the seating is subpar. One caveat is that there is no waitstaff but the cashier gave me a dirty look when I didn't give him any tip. I don't tip at McDonalds so why would I pay you to take my order?
"Lets face it we all have an inner fat girl that overindulges and squeals in delight when we experience a delicious treat  That was me at Big & little'sThe food is so good that  I go by myself, wear a baseball cap and sit in the back.  I'll be damned if anyone I know learns about this place.  I ordered Shrimp Banh Mi Po'boy, Truffle Fries and a Diet Coke.  Diet Coke - Found it to be very refreshing, with a bit of bite on the endTruffle Fries - Good amount of tuffle oil, nice serving size, fried to perfectionShrimp Banh Mi - Sweet baby Jesus - pickled onion & jalapeno, crispy shrimp, special sauceTotal was around  $11-12I have seen others enjoying the burgers and tacos but I always order the same thing. Staff is friendly and I see a lot of families dining in.    Argh, now I want one."
Great food and awesome service. Fish and chips were amazingBurger was fresh and cooked perfectKimchi fries were different but very good. And omg the crab taco..... I could live on
"I am totally in love with the Zeus burger. I've also tried the Hawaiian burger, which is a little more spicy, but will always love the Zeus! It has gyro meat on top of a burger, feta cheese, and a fried egg on top (which I usually don't like). I can't get enough of it. It's definitely messy though, so once you dive in, be prepared!The service here is consistently nice, friendly, and super awesome. They're always cleaning, chatting with customers, and making the entire experience very enjoyable. The big guy I've seen there twice (don't know his name, but he is super sweet, always sweeping the floor, bringing out food, taking orders...man of many talents!) reminds me SO MUCH of my brother, so even just for that, I'll keep coming back! It's like a slice of friendly home :)The truffle fries are defintely awesome. The flavor is not overwhelming (which I sometimes prefer) but the truffle flavor sneaks up on you after the first few fries. Worth a try!"
"Definitely going back! My friends and I shared a Samurai Taco-def getting again, Carnitas Taco-it was okay, and a Pork Belly Po'boy-def getting that again as well. Everyone there was so kind and friendly. They offered to heat up our food when I asked to cut it in half later on, and ended up heating it and adding more pork! Free refill on fountain drinks, and It's also byob. We brought our own drinks and had a great time."
"I've come here countless times since my friend graciously introduced me to it and I was hooked.  I always try to get something different when I go because their expansive menu is chock-full of absolute deliciousness.  I'd recommend the Al Pastor burger or Spicy Pork Banh Mi burrito as personal favorites of mine, but I have yet to find anything that just wasn't good.  Bottom line:  You should eat here."
"I love the Belmont and Gold Coast location.  If you get anything else, get the soft shell crab po-boy.  It is amazing!"
"This place is BUSY.  Be WARNED!  There was a line almost out the door when we went on a recent Sunday afternoon.  And it will take a bit of time to get your food.Now, the food.  I had the pork belly po boy.  I loved the pork belly.  I would have eaten just a plate of that if I could.  It was melt in your mouth exquisite.  The sandwich itself was exquisite.  The sauces, the toppings were a perfect complement.The problem.  Not enough meat.  Too much bread.  I ate about a 1/3 of the sandwich, and all I could taste was the bread.  I just started eating the sandwich filling out of the bread with a knife and fork.  In the end, I had almost an entire bread shell on my plate and I was still hungry because I wanted more pork belly.I also ordered truffle fries.  Not bad, but not ""truffle-y"" enough for me.  The verdict? I would go back and ask for double meat on the po boy and just pay the extra money."
"After waiting in line for over 45 minutes, I ordered a Banh Mi burrito which was OUTSTANDING!  I would have it again.  It had flavors I have never experienced before.However, the only reason I gave it 4 starts is because they can do better at the cash register.  They need 2 registers, one for customers waiting in line and 1 for customers who ordered on-line.  It took a long time to get up to the counter because the people who ordered on-line got in right up front and paid before the rest of us.Maybe it keeps the orders coming out at a good rate.  Maybe it would still be a long wait for the food, but unless you have 45 minutes to wait in line, you should come back at a time when it's not so busy like the middle of the week.I would go back so long as I had 1 1/2 hours to spare for a burrito."
Had the Zues gyro burger with a fried egg and Phil's fries with a fried egg. Needless to say I love fried eggs. Amazing burgers and great joint for a quick casual lunch!
Omg. The ahi tuna taco. Amazing. Coupled with the truffle fries and your own Byob beer... Recipe for success. The staff is attentive and super friendly. Great late night spot of you can snag a table.
"Wow. I guess I just don't get it.  Picked up a bunch of different tacos one afternoon and honestly, they all tasted the same. And given the selection I had (ranging from al pastor to carne to shrimp) that is pretty odd.Tortillas were rubbery and were just OK. Filling quantity was decent for the price as each taco will only set you back a few bucks. So as far as value for price paid, I'll give them 4 stars. But as far as taste goes, I'm thinking 2 stars since as mentioned, they all were pretty much the same thing with different names.Also had the truffle fries and yes, as advertised, they were fried in truffle oil. Thing is, they were very greasy to the point they were almost dark brown from all the oil in them. Were they tasty? Sort of. The truffle oil flavor was there but they were cold and soggy. Not my two favorite qualities in a french fry.Overall - 3 stars as service was very good, prices were fair but food was meh. Probably a good place to go when you're all banged up after a night in Wrigleyville or if you look in your wallet and you've only got a few bucks. If you want a better taco, head to Pilsen. You can get any number of tacos for the same price with better quality than here."
"Tried this place after a friend told me about her experience there.  Wanted a quick bite before a show that was not super heavy.  Tried the Grilled Mahi taco which was overloaded with the cabbage slaw and hardly tasted the Mahi.  The Mango Chutney were very good and tasty.  The Samurai was tasty as well, but the jalapenos really give it the spicy kick.  My friend had the Steamed Blue Crab taco and said it was good, but not worth the price and thought the spicy pork taco was very tasty.  order taker was cheerful, friendly and helpful with menu suggestions.  It was quite loud between the music and the patrons."
"Just go. Now........ no, no, no don't read more. The guy below me agrees, so the girl above. Just do it. You will not need condoms for this sexual experience. It is joyful, it is pure, it is honest, it is Jesus."
"The burger was great but the service not so much. I had this place once and I ordered the Zeus burger with truffle fries. Both were delicious. However, the man behind the counter gave me and my friend some lip when we wanted the bill separate. He needs an attitude adjustment."
Well - a gem in the neighborhood. Went there without planning it.The tacos are very different to usual tacos and i have tried 7 of them the first time i went there.The Samurai and Ahi Tuna are the best. Just the right spicesReally not much to say as from the service to quality of food - It is a 5 star. Friendly staff and fresh foodTry the truffle fries too - but i would recommend just the TacosThey also have burgers and so - didn't try themOne other thing - they deliver (with a charge) in the area around their locationGo and try it and let me know what your thoughts are
OMG!  My food was so good! I had 4 tacos they were all great!  Lamb gyro had freshly made Tzatziki sauce on it.Mango Chutney pork was sweet & spicy.Grilled shrimp had a delicious tangy sauce drizzled over the top.Spicy Beef short rib was garnished was pickled onions. Really enjoyed  my meal.
"All sorts of tacos and they are all delicious. Normally you have to wait In line for a while but it moves quickly. It is not so big of a restaurant and a party more than 6 people would be pushing it.  Not so much if a dating spot, good for quick bites with friends! Try the kimchi fries! You won't regret it :)"
"Fried seafood done right! I'm a fan of their soft shell crab po'boy and raw tuna taco. The fish n chips are good too and reasonably priced. On top of the tasty food, it's BYOB and the service is excellent and courteous."
"So I've been to Big & Little's a handful of times in the past month or so and keep expecting it to get old and it never does.  The burgers are always cooked just right.  The bacon is thick, like someone cut a slab off the side of the pig itself.  The Truffle fries are delicious and the tacos are very yum as well.  Can't really say enough about this location.  Whether you eat in or order delivery, it's never a disappointment."
"Had delivery- food was delivered intact and pretty quick. What left me disappointed was the fact that the delicious Fish and Chips were portion sized for a child. Imagine a couple of lonely hunks of fish in a fantastic puffy golden batter on top of the pacific ocean of fries. I literally wasn't sure if it was intended that I make my meal on the 'chips or just go hungry.  Based on some of the pictures that other Yelpers have posted of the dish, my order was pretty standard.I licked the tartar sauce cup clean for extra sustenance.  Tried my partner's kimchi fries. In general, a meh concept no matter who does it (and believe me, a lot of people do it). Korean poutine, har har har- we get it. Softshell crab was well received by partner just for existing on a delivery menu in Chicago and not having been priced at 20.00."
"If the staff wasn't so nice I would have gone 2 stars. Shrimp PoBoy - forget it. It's 5, yes only FIVE overly breaded small shrimp on good bread, good sauce, good lettuce. But it's not a bread, sauce, lettuce Po Boy...its a SHRIMP...The fries are good but it's hard to F up fried potatoes sprinkled w sea salt or tossed in truffle oil. Hopefully other menu items aren't quite such a disappointment."
I am convinced that the tuna poke tacos at Big and Little's can make everything right with the world.Here's my formula for stress maintenance and sanity preservation:Good day = 1 poke tacoBad day = 2 poke tacosAmazing day = 2 poke tacosReally terrible day = 2 poke tacos + 1 Tollhouse icecream cookie sandwich
Best tacos in the city... PERIOD.And they deliver....by bike sometimes :)
"My friends had some friends who were in town visiting from San Francisco, so we decided to meet and grab dinner Sunday evening. None of us had ever been to BIG & little's (only one of us had been to the other location), so we didn't know what to expect. When we arrived, we were surprised to find that it's a quick-service establishment rather than full-service since you order at the counter, grab a table, and pick-up your food when it's ready.Per the owner's recommendation, I got (2) Samurai tacos ($2.65 ea.), (2) Spicy Pork tacos ($2.65 ea.), and Phil's Fries ($3.45). My favorite taco of the two was definitely the Samurai: fried whitefish and lettuce sprinkled with sesame seeds and drenched in a special samurai sauce. So delicious. The Spicy Pork, on the other hand, was just okay to me. The seared shredded pork, cilantro, and spicy thai sauce didn't really do anything for me and wasn't as flavorful nor textural as the Samurai. Phil's fries were basically truffle fries served with a fried egg on top. I've had better truffle fries but these were decent and I could've done without the egg just fine.Service is fantastic. The three of us were waiting for the other three to arrive before ordering, so we grabbed a large table and waited without ordering first. We sat there for about an hour before my friend's friends showed up, and I'm surprised the staff never shot death glares our way or kicked us out. While my friends ordered their food, the owner saw me trying to find an outlet to charge my dying phone and enthusiastically told me I could use an outlet behind the counter -- and that I could just walk on behind and plug it in myself. I was surprised by his hospitality and friendliness, and he alone deserves an extra star.P.S. Restroom is tiiiiiiny but well-kept and very clean. And BIG & little's is BYOB!"
Delicious food-Truffle fries a must Fish and chips good. Soft shell crab po boys the best- my favoritePork belly po boy... Eh not my favorite. Maybe it was just really overcooked. But it was really hard and I couldn't taste the maple at allI got take out... Was kind of messy that they lost the order and then just re put it in. Oh well. Not a big deal for good food.
"I went here this past Friday and it was good!It's a very casual fast food type restaurant, but the quality of food is high. Menu is pretty diverse - Cajun inspiration with a Mexican twist. They offer Poboy's, tacos, burritos, burgers and fries. I also noticed they have a delivery option.I went with the Ahi Tuna and Crab Taco. My boyfriend tried the Shrimp PoBoy. We split the Cajun fries.All items were delicious, but a little small (I guess that's where they get the name). Come prepared to spend a decent amount of money, because everything is a' la carte and you'll need to order multiple things. I ended up going back up to order Fish N' Chips that we both spilt (was also tasty) That is the only reason I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5.Would I go back? Absolutely."
"My boyfriend and I have been here countless times and can't stay away, from this location or the River North one. Omar, the manager, is a great guy and has yet to forget my boyfriend and I's names. Everything we've had here has been mouth-watering good, but I'd have to rank the fish tacos above all else. My boyfriend compares them to fish tacos he has in Mexico, to give you some perspective. In short: order a fish taco."
"It sounds like hyperbole but this is my favorite place in Chicago. Since first coming about a month ago, I've been back three times. The people are friendly, the food is fantastic, and its very affordable, and BYOB.Highly recommend the po boys, especially the softshell crab and shrimp po boys. Fish tacos are great, highly recommend the samurai and the crab poke."
Not sure what happened but I went here and felt like the food wasn't as good. The burgers were bland and so was the tacos. The samurai was good and so was the ahi taco but everything else? Blah. It was either too oily or too bland. Maybe it was an off day? Nope! Went there again a week later and it was the same. Won't be coming back again!
"I tried the double cheeseburger here, slathered with tons of toppings. The meat was excellent and seemed to be ground beef - you could tell because it fell apart in chunks and I ended up having to eat it with a knife and fork. That might have been my fault since I had 2 patties and a bunch of stuff on it. I didn't mind, tho, because it tasted excellent.I also got the cajun fries, which had a great flavor.The one thing I didn't like here is that we had 3 people and food for 3 people and they brought each item out as it was ready. The tacos my wife ordered came out one at a time, then my burger came out, then my kid's burger, then my fries, then his fries. It made it awkward as we all ate and finished eating at different times.But no one complained about their food and the service was excellent!"
"Love, love, love this place!!!We've never eaten there so I can't speak to dining in but have never had a bad experience carrying out or delivery. We highly reccomend the pastor tacos and the Hawaiian burger - I don't know what they're secret is with their meat but it is just delicious. My husband is part Mexican and we've had our share of real Mexican food and we both love their pastor (and served non-gringo with onion & cilantro!)If carry out especially during dinner rush: order ahead using grubhib and skip the big line when you pick up.....everyone in line will hate you but it's awesome to just get handed your bag and walk out!"
"I've been talked into going here twice and it's a decent enough place, though I'm not sure it's really all it's hyped up to be.Pros:Very friendly staff - I love Omar!Delicious tacosPatio seating if you can get a tableCons:Always SUPER packed with a pretty long wait and very loud environmentRather small venue, so I always feel like a sardine jammed in a can dining hereTacos are super tiny, by the time I really appreciate the flavor, it's gone!Deceptively ""cheap"" - meaning, everything looks really affordable, but the portion sizes (at least when it comes to the tacos) are so small, you end up paying $10 and still being hungryWhen I return, I'm going to be sure I go during an off-peak time when ""everybody and they mama"" isn't there."
BYOB - this location does take CCThe line is long but gives you time to harp on the entire menu. What makes this location beyond the fresh ingredients and bumping club music is Omar they guy taking everyone's orders. He treated every guest like his first and patiently answered questions. While everything was tasty it was sauced too heavily. I would ask for all the sauces on the side and for food to be less salted because it masked the taste of the main ingredients.Big and Little's Ahi Tuna Poke Soft Shell Crab Po' Boy
"Easily one of the most overrated restaurants in the city.  The food was too salty and cold.  I'll give the place another shot, but only after I eat at every other place in the city.It is pretty cheap to eat here, but personally wasn't worth it."
"The food here is incredible. The service is even better.I placed a delivery order on a snowy night that took longer than expected. When it arrived, it was someone else's order. I called to try to rectify the issue, which B&L's were quick to do. They comped my entire order, and sent another one out right away. I was completely satisfied with that solution, but that was before I got a call from the manager, Omar. Omar was profusely apologetic (he even went so far as to say he was embarrassed) and thankful for my patience. I've never had an experience where a business has reached out to me and expressed such a sincere apology for a mishap and such gratitude for my business. I never thought screwing up my order would make me love a restaurant more, but Big & Little's pulled that off. Great food, great people."
"This place is FANTASTIC! The location can't be beat, food is amazing, the price is right, and the staff is incredibly friendly. I ordered two tacos while my husband ordered a burrito. When he was asked if he wanted that burrito deep fried, I think he almost wet his pants from excitement. We also split an order of truffle fries, which were delicious.We ordered our food to go, so as the super friendly cashier bagged it up for us, he also included some ""special sauce"" in our bag. The sauce really complemented the tacos. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago and I encourage YOU to go as well!"
"The thing that is so great about Big & Little's is that you get cheap, good quality food for any appetite from a great staff of people. I have never been disappointed here, and it's BYOB which is a plus! I have never had something here that I did not like. The most noteworthy for me are the spicy beef short rib taco and the pork belly po boy. I love that taco. I always have to restrain myself from ordering 10 of them at once. I also can never go without a side of truffle fries.The menu is so diverse which makes it the perfect spot no matter what you have a taste for. It's definitely worth the wait in line, and they deliver which I have also had a great experience with! Personally, I like going in for the true Big & Little's experience."
"First off I'm giving this joint 5 stars. The girl in front taking our order was extremely nice and very cheery. Definitely makes a good impression. Customers knew her by first name. Anyway, was recommended the pork taco. I only got one and it was a perfect 3 bites (tiny.) for a meal portion I would recommend 4. I work at Chicago apartment finders down the street. I'll definitely be back for more."
I have frequented fairly often for the last few years and at both of their locations and have enjoyed mostly everything about their food. Great food in unpretentious atmosphere. It doesn't get much better than this.
SawThis themOn driver done-in and dives and had to have the soft shell crab sandwich Ding ding ding winnerIt's a must eat when in chicago
"I wanted to love this place I really did but after coming here I was a little let down. The place isn't all that big of you're coming here with a big group but as long as two people aren't hogging a big table it should be ok. The guy working the register was super nice and helpful which was great. Onto the food now, I ordered the spicy beef short rib taco, the Japanese short rib taco, the grilled tilapia taco, and the foie dog. The tacos themselves were a bit small for my liking and the sauce drowned out delicate flavors it had underneath. The sauce was also a little too sweet for my taste. The fish taco was probably the best one with a very light flavor and the slaw and the sauce working well with the grilled fish. The foie dog... I was so hopeful to find a replacement for hot Dougs foie dog but this one just wasn't it. The ""foie"" tasted just like ordinary pâté and it wasn't anything special in my opinion. Also the bun was way to thick for such a thin hot dog. All in all it was a good place to try but I don't know if I'm in a rush to go back."
"If you enjoy tacos and good service this is your place. Great food and great staff, including the owners. It's always crowded but they still get your food out very quickly."
"BIG & Little's!!! Oh man, this place is freaking great. Can we just all talk a second to admire how great the service is here? We were greeted immediately, I was able to have a full blown witty and charming conversation with tOmar, and the food gets brought out to you if they're not slammed. Me=Happy Camper. Now, the food is out of this world. It's simple, it's not anything you're going to see in Food & Wine, but it's so damn good. How many times have you paid for a sandwich and it sucked? That will never, ever, happen here. Big & little's, you and I are going to write some amazing food romance novels."
"Man this place rocks. That sums it up. Went in not knowing what to expect and then we ended up with a pork belly po'boy, Japanese beef short rib and ahi tuna tacos with an order of Cajun fries. Whoa. Did I mention the po'boy is big and amazingly delicious and only like $7. Tacos were $2.65 and I think they were even better than the tacos at big star. I love big star so that's saying something.Oh, and I went up for a second round of food and ""Big"" gave me a fist bump. Sweet. Go to this place."
My SO and I went one day to try it out. They definitely had constant business but waiting in the line was well worth it. I ordered the shrimp po boy and the SO ordered the fish and chips. The flavors of the shrimp po boy just meshed so well. I crave this sandwich all the time. My SO is very picky on his beloved fish and chips and loved these. The atmosphere is great and the guys are hilarious.
"LOVE their ahi raw tuna taco here. It's a little expensive for its size, but that little taco shell is packed with all tuna. Perfect as a snack or to pair with a hot dog or something."
"Mind. Blown. Came here for late lunch with my sister because she's been raving about this place. Her buddy, Omar, helped us out and he was super awesome. What we ate:- Samurai Taco: When all our food came out, I thought ""This looks run of the mill"". BUT when I took my first bite into this taco, holy sh*t. Amazing flavor. Sauce was amazing and they don't over dress it. - Grilled Shrimp taco: Very simple. Wasn't bad, but didn't blow my mind. I think I would order it fried next time. The shrimp was very fresh and bouncy though.- Japanese braised short rib: HOLY YUM! The beef was soooo tender and juicy. Full of that awesome beefy flavor.- Poke Tuna taco: Don't let the bland look of the taco fool you. This was one of my top favs. There is this amazing sweet soy sauce at the bottom of the taco that balances the ahi tuna poke so well along with the lemon. The crunch is a great play on textures with the soft tuna. - SPECIAL po boy: My sis and I couldn't decide between the soft shell crab and pork belly po boy, so our boy Omar made a special one for us with BOTH! I think it was a little too over the top though. Next time I will order just the soft shell carb. I loved the sweet pickles in the po boy. I also dipped my fries in the special sauce and stuck it in my sandwich. Amazing.- Truffle fries: I feel like at most other places, you really have to try hard to taste the truffles in your mouth. However, the truffle fries at B and L's burst with truffle flavor. Great on its own or dipped in the special sauce."
"I went for the first time this week and was very happy with everything.  When I walked in,  I was greeted by a friendly face.  He gave me a menu and answered all of my 100 questions about the menu and their popular items.  In the end, I ordered a Mexican beef taco, ahi tuna taco and a grilled tilapia taco.   My favorite was the ahi tuna.  Ahhhh-mazing!!!  Coming in at second place was the Mexican beef taco.  The grilled tilapia taco was good but not great.  I want to try the fried tilapia taco.  I actually want to try them all!  With 3 tacos, I was very full and satisfied.  They have a tin of other things on the menu to on. There is outdoor seating and they are BYOB."
"Big price, little flavor.The grilled shrimp taco featured four tiny grilled shrimp, buried under a bed of lettuce and smothered in a nondescript sauce.  The bahn mi taco featured decent whitefish, but the lack of carrots and cilantro, the HUGE slathering of mayo, and the inclusion of pickled jalapeños instead of fresh made this a huge disappointment.  My son's two carnitas tacos were, reportedly, equally marginal.  These four tacos, plus two fries and two drinks ran just under $29.  Completely unacceptable for what we received (the fries WERE pretty good though)."
"BIG & little's - what can be said that hasn't been already...Food was delicious. I had a mahi taco, softshell crab po' boy, and fries and they were excellent. I'm always a little worried ordering a softshell crab anything this far from the coast, but it was delicious and my GI tract suffered no ill-consequences. The taco was great too. This place is an excellent value - I think the group of 3 I was with ate A LOT and it clocked in at less than $50 total. Not bad for as much good seafood as we ate.The highlight of this place was easily the employees. They were incredibly friendly and accommodating, especially given the large volume of customers.I will definitely be back on my next trip to Chicago."
"When I noticed they were opening a location in Lakeview I was excited to finally try Big & Littles. We wandered in for a quick bite before going out for drinks and the place was pretty empty, staff was friendly helpful and quick..what more could you ask for?They have an awesome menu but I settled on the soft shell crab po boy. So glad I did. The guy at the counter warned me that I'd be eating the entire crab (apparently this weirds some people out?) but that did not deter me from this delicious sandwich. Simple bread, lettuce, crab, and sauce done just right. I would definitely return to try some of the other things on the menu. Or just come back for the sandwich. Mmmm"
"Everything said before is true. BIG & little's is a gem and Omar is a very gracious host. There are SO many items on the menu, we had to ask for direction and Omar took his time describing his favorites, best sellers and recommendations.We ended up with two Samurai tacos, one mahi, one Hawaiian, one ahi tuna and one spicy pork. All of that for just under $20. They were all delicious, but the spicy pork, which Omar explained is not spicy, was extraordinary. Delectably sweet and savory, next time I would order three or four of these for a meal.Attention to detail abounds and the service is top notch. Outdoor seating is a fantastic plus. It's a shame the glass front windows don't open. That would make eating indoors on a spring day like yesterday particularly enjoyable.One last note. Omar delivered food to the table next to us and apologized profusely for having dropped two of their tacos. Replacements were brought quickly, plus an extra one free of charge for their trouble. Now that's service!"
"If you like high quality ingredients without the pomp and circumstance of a fancy restaurant you must go directly to Big & Little's.Pork Belly...That's it.  Order the pork belly po' boy.  Very few places know how to properly cook pork belly - especially when its chopped up to properly fit into a sandwich.  B&L's does.What else?  The tacos are fantastic.  The samurai in particular is worth everyone's time.  What's that?  You say you don't like fish taco's?The cheeseburgers are killer here as well - get the Merkt's.  Oh, how about the deep fried grilled cheese?  Yumm-o!The foie gras fries are uh-mazing.  But, there is a chance that the lobe of foie gras you get could be not as good as another.  It's the nature of the beast (and its liver).  But, the pan drippings from the foie are drizzled over the fries.  Can you imagine the goodness waiting for you at the bottom of those fries?  Be prepared to share though.  It's a tad rich.Truffle fries?  Meh.  I am not a fan of truffle oil.  in case you didn't know, there is no truffle in truffle oil.  It's grapeseed or olive oil with stuff in it that smells like truffles.  How it is still called truffle oil is a mystery to me.  So, enough about that.To summarize:Pork belly po' boySamurai tacoFoie gras fries"
"This place is the best! I had the lamb burrito, truffle fries and soft shell crab poboy. Everything was excellent."
"If you don't love this place, then there's something wrong with you. These guys do it right! Literally everything they serve is awesome! And cheap too, which is even better.Can't recommend 1 particular thing because it's ALL good. Give them a try, you will not be disappointed!"
"I'm so disappointed, I was really hoping that this would be an awesome place... Our food got delivered by someone who literally had the dirtiest hands I've ever seen, the boxes were all crunched and our food was toppled over every where.Shrimp Banh Mi Po'Boy - excellent flavor, but where were the shrimp? Five tiny little shrimp in a sea of bread. The sauce really was delicious though, I'll give them that.Fish and Chips - more like BITS and chips.. mahi mahi are HUGE fish, where did these 3 tiny little filets come from? I thought for sure I would get two nice filets. The fries were soggy... honestly the whole thing just looked like there wasn't much thought or care put into cooking my food.It came cold and I had to heat it all up in the oven, I'm just disappointed because with all the great reviews, I thought for sure I'd found a good spot."
"I just had a soft shell crab po'boy and it was amazing! The sauce, the bread, the fried crab! Yum! I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"
"If you get the Big and Little's bug, it's game over. Don't even think about going home and eating your leftovers from last night's cooking. I've tried, and it's never worked. Order for takeout or order ahead though. It takes a little while -with good reason. Everything is delicious. I've stuck to the tacos - the seafood tastes very fresh, their meat tacos all have an interesting medley of flavors.Also, Kimchi fries are the bomb. The ambiance is very lively and fun too."
Had the poke tacos and the truffle fries. All I can say is awesome!! Ordered through grub hub so I can't comment on the service inside. I will certainly order again and explore more of the menu like the pork belly po'boy as shows on divers drive ins and dives.
"Hip atmosphere, passionate workers, good food. I'm not sure you can go wrong with anything on the menu.Highlights: Ahi Poke, Softshell Crab Po' Boy, Phil's Fries, anything with 'Special Sauce.'"
Food was really good.... Fish and chips and shrimp poor boy is what we had.... Cajun fries were really good very fair prices.... Will be back
"My favorite casual restaurant in Lakeview. I don't know the guys name who usually works behind the counter but I've never run across a happier guy in my life.My favorite thing about Big & Little's is no matter what I'm in the mood for, their food delivers be it tacos (fish or non), burgers, burritos, etc.You throw some avocado on that tuna poke taco and then I'd have no complaints."
"Food was awesome, staff was friendly and patient while it took me awhile to look over all their delicious entrees. Loved the theme!"
"Amazing food for a great price, food was up quick and atmosphere was pleasant. Definitely worth making another trip from up the lake. We spent about thirty just me and my husband because we wanted to try so much, all we ordered was completely finished!"
"My sister and me shared a baked chicken meal on last special Tuesday. The tenderness of chicken is really my dishes. Amazing! Sweet potatoes, the mac and cheese shows its power. Sweet potatoes are really on point. The portions are also generous. This is one of two place that will make me like to live in Chicago. At the brief conversation that I had met a young lady at the order window. It forced me to entice the owner to come out and enjoy a conversation with us. She was  the second most amazing business owner I met in this city.The connotation of the owner is so beautiful inside & out. It makes that her enthusiasm resonated. Nothing has changed but more wonderful than to hear the successful goals  of  a great business owner due to hard work & determination. When we return we look forward to watching this business grow into a successful and permanent ""brick and mortar"" establishment."
"I wish I could give a 1/2 star more - heard so much about the place and got a group-on to try out - first they were totally cool we had a group-on (lots of places act jerky when you have one)Tacos - so good, especially the fish and GreekFries - cooked perfect, crispy outside, soft insidePo Boy - somehow I was able to get this down after all the tacos, worth going back just for thatgreat place - fresh made to order - excellent food - nice service"
"Big and Little's is hands down my favorite restaurant in the city. Trust me when I say, that there entire menu is incredible. There fish is probably the best one can get outside of England, and there taco's are to die for. But the real amazing thing is the burger. Like many other Chicagoans (and people who watch How I Met Your Mother), I am endlessly looking for the best burger in the city. I've been to nearly every top rated burger joint, (Kuma's, Au Cheval, Trencherman, Owen and Engine etc etc). Big and Little's Al Pastor burger, in my opinion, is the best burger in the city. Man, is it good. And um, you can get an entire soft shell crab po boy for $8 and an Sashimi grade Ahi Tuna taco filled to the brim. Yea......Run. Don't walk. :)"
"Here's the thing about BIG & little's: whenever you have a serious craving for something scrumptious, no matter what, they'll satisfy you. Whether it's the tacos, burgers, po'boys, or hot dogs, prepare to enjoy a meal for once. I've been personally going for the classic shrimp or BBQ pork belly po'boys lately, but who knows what I'll be macking on next week. Also grab a cup of their iced coffee; free refills and fresh brewed."
"I'll talk about the food in a minute, but my main complaint with this place is the ever-present long line. If we're getting down to things I guess the real complaint is the small size of the place. I'm not sure why the great majority of people give it a complete pass on that front (I'm assuming, with all the 5-star reviews).Sure, any decent place will be busy at dinnertime, especially on the weekend. But this place? Come by at 3:30pm on a TUESDAY and there will be a line out the door. There's almost no such thing as ""off hours"" here...I live nearby so I walk by the place almost every day, this is how I know. The line often does not move quickly at all. Last time I went, I waited about 20 minutes in line, then after ordering waited about 25 more minutes for my food. The food is pretty good, but I'm sorry, not THAT good.In the winter, the place was relatively calm during the week about 30-45 minutes before closing. But now that weather is nice again...nope, super long line.The food? Yes, it's good. I've had the majority of their burger and taco options, plus a few other sandwiches and po' boys. All tasty. The regular burgers/cheeseburgers, though, are pretty much what you'd find at any backyard cookout. Standard grocery store buns, smallish patty -- nothing special at all. But the ""gourmet"" burger options make up for this, mostly. The fries are pretty good, but I'm not sure a dusting of cajun seasoning or shredded truffle makes them worth $3. I also wish they had some kind of entree/fries/drink combo which, bafflingly, they don't. Because the burgers are on the small side I will often get a taco (sometimes 2) along with the burger and fries. That ends up being a pricey meal ($15-20).That's about it. Pretty good food, but horrendously busy almost always. Unfortunately that means I almost never go there. When I do go, I have a double realization: Ah yes, a huge line I feel it's not worth waiting through; Ah yes, this is why people like it here, the food's pretty good..."
Cheap and delicious food!!! Their tacos are AMAZING especially their pork belly andal pastor taco. The po'boys are HUGE. So visit there with a big appetite. The customer service was not what I expected.  The gentleman behind the counter was more than willing to help me and my partner because it was our first time there. Let's just say we went back and order more food.
"Deliciousness! I've only been once, but my soft shell crab po'boy and truffle fries were fantastic. My only qualm is that my crab was pretty tiny, but also pretty pricey. Where's the crab?"
I've been waiting to try this place since I saw it on the news one random morning. it was absolutely delicious. the ahi tuna taco and blue crab taco are both so fresh and tasty! the grilled shrimp taco was ok. I'm not a big fan of tar tar sauce and that was very strong in that taco. the Japanese short rib taco was sweet savory and yummy. but the kimchi fries were AMAZING!! definitely something to eat when you come here.
"This place is amazing! I love how creative they get with the food. I'd order from here any day. Dining in is a different story though. The line can get very long (out the door) and the room itself can become cacophonous with screaming children, loud music and people waiting like hawks to swoop in and take your table the moment you finish. Just have them deliver - you'll be happy you did."
"Go for the tacos and nothing else. The gyro taco, mexican short rib taco, and Japanese short rib taco were all AMAZING! The mango chutney taco was also pretty good. Unfortunately the chorizo burrito was pretty bland and was so unevenly distributed that there was a ""hot"" end and a ""cold"" end (and you could feel the difference by touching the outside). The truffle fries were limp and basically flavorless. That said, the service was fast and friendly, and those tacos really were delicious. We'll likely be back for a quick taco run - but don't expect us to try anything else!"
"This is one of my new favorite places in Chicago.  It's one of those places that, at least for me, cuts right to the chase in terms of what I'm craving.  Like a crab or tuna taco with, well, just lots and lots of real crab or sashimi-grade tuna, fresh and full of flavor, stuffed in a crispy shell.  And with unusual but satisfying items like a crab po boy (and it's a real whole fried crab) or kimchi burritos, how could anyone say no to coming here?? (Maybe vegetarians...tho it looks like they have salad mixin' options.)The atmosphere in the restaurant is quick, casual, clean, and comfortable.  The staff is friendly, knowledgable, helpful, and efficient.  I have loved every taco I've tried here - when I think of Big and Little's I think of flavor + juiciness + not-skimped-on-fillings + fresh meat + well-paired crisp, tangy, crunchy vegetables and zingy sauces.  At $2.65/taco, things can add up quickly, but I think it's well worth it."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Food and customer service were both really good! Came here for the first time and Omar was helping us, the nicest and most helpful employee I've ever encountered. He explained the menu to us, recommend amazing things and even checked up on us afterwards. I ordered the samurai taco, spicy beef short rib taco, Mexican beef short rib taco, the Japanese beef short rib taco, their regular fries, and their Cajun fries. I won't even began to describe any of them, everyone should order everything I ordered, because I  could eat all of that every single day of my life. I didn't have a favorite either, because they were all equally amazing. I've heard everything here is good, even the sandwiches, po-boys, etc. I think this will be my new weekly hangout, too bad they aren't closer to where I live, or else I could literally go every single day."
Great food and awesome staff! Played a very cool mix of hip hop.  Prices are extremely reasonable. Truffle fries are terrific. This is a great place to grab a quick and yummy bite.
I've been to the original location and remember it fondly. When I saw the opening soon sign at this location I was anxiously awaiting the open date!!I went to order pick up and they were busy but the line moved quickly!The owners seemed to both be there and were happily greeting everyone and were very kind and welcoming to every patron.I got the pork belly po boy and truffle fries that I remember loving from the original location.Portion sizes are smaller on the sandwich but the prices are as well!I am enjoying the most delicious pork belly sandwich ever and I had to immediately write a positive review!
"Great place-- exemplifying everything that Chicago's food scene could be but isn't, in large part. My first two times in here were just decent but really affordable food. I got a banh mi taco, which wasn't illustrious but it was okay, and I think we also got beef short rib tacos and something else quasi-Asiatic.Third time in, I said, what the heck, I'll get an Al Pastor burger. ""How do you want it cooked?"" Wait, so, let me get this straight-- you're giving me not only cheap and exotic food, you're also giving me options on how it's going to come out? Are we still in Chicago? I get the burger and it's 1) medium rare beef with 2) al pastor pork, 3) pineapple slices, and 4) a fried egg on a pretzel bun. Mind = Blown. ARE YOU QUITE SERIOUS. Also, kimchi fries? For real. Wow.Like other places in Chicago, expect a line out the door, but unlike those places, this place will not break the bank, and the staff are awesome. BYOB, and don't worry-- you'll have time to walk eight blocks back to your apartment on a really busy night to pick up the bottle of wine you forgot. :)"
"Yummy place for some small bites of comforting food! I went at 3pm on a week day and it was pretty dead. This was my first time so I asked the super friendly guy at the register for suggestions. He recommended 3 tacos- The raw tuna taco, the Samurai and a shredded pork taco. Overall I LOVED the Samurai and the raw tuna! Next time i go I'll check out the rest of the menu but I'm sure I'll always get at least 1 Samurai- it melts in your mouth- great combo of flavors.Personally, I don't think the food is worth a 30 + min wait so go on off hours for some yummy food and very friendly service! Welcome to the neighborhood Big & Little's!"
I love you Big & LITTLES!  I love your food..I love your staff.. And I think you're officially one of my new favorite spots.Me and my fiancé can't wait to try the rest of the menu. So much love and success to your business.You guys were awesome!
"Food is amazing. But have to knock off a star for the constant wait. Always takes about 15 min to place an order, and another 15-20 to get the food. What really should be a quick visit inevitably becomes a long ordeal. Recommend ordering ahead."
"I must say, still very impressed with this place.  I increased my star because I knew going on the day we did and so close to opening, any restaurant has to work out the kinks.  During this experience, the kinks were worked out.I am very glad to see a resto go here where the owners are friendly, know you by name, produce amazing food, suggest what they think you should try, and go above and beyond to make your dining experience a memorable one.Everything I've tried was fantastic.I can't wait to go back!!I highly recommend eating here!!"
"This place was amazing!  I came in on a lazy Sunday afternoon with my girlfriend thinking it would be a very good quick burger or taco, but then I saw the soft shell crab po'boy.  A must try for anyone that stops in!We showed up around 2ish thinking there may be a small crowd, but I guess everyone thought the same thing.  The line was almost to the door, and I said to my gf that maybe we should try somewhere else, but I was immediately told no!  While we waited one of the cashiers was coming down the waiting line letting everyone very politely that it may be a half hour wait, and sincerely was apologetic.  We ordered the soft shell crab po' boy and the al pastor burger per his rec. and both were absolutely mouth watering.  While we waited I went up to the local 1000 Liquors and grabbed a beer because they encourage BYOB!"
"3.5 stars, really. The mahi taco was great, truffle and kim chi fries were both amazing, but the al pastor was so deeply fried that my jaw hurt the rest of the night from chewing just one little taco. Al pastor is supposed to be juicy and tender as it is at most decent taquerias-but this was a chore to eat. Everything else here was great and I would return and try other things."
"GOD himself put his hand on this establishment. Those brilliantly delish short rib tacos, crisp, succulent truffle fries and melt-in -your-mouth flavor-filled fish tacos, and the oh-mi-gawsh service! ~sigh...my only regret was that I could not move in and roll outta bed every morning to eat this food with coffee...or with water at lunch...or for dinner before they tucked me into bed at night. This is way beyond my mother's comfort food. I'm ashamed to say that I'd rather go to BIG & little's than to grandma's house for Sunday dinners. (shhhhh...don't tell Granny Lady, ok?) This was my GOLD STAR place for both wonderful food and amazingly best-friend kind of service!!!"
"I understand why people like this place.  It has a great vibe, the food is good, and it's reasonably priced.  However, at the new location they definitely have a few kinks to work out. I went on a Friday afternoon, around 2pm.  It was busy, as I expected it to be.  They only have one register, and they line was long.  Being a new restaurant in the area, I realize they want to give good service.  However, the register guy was seriously spending around 5-10 minutes with each customer, explaining the menu and helping customers pick out what to order.  While he was helping one group of guys, the line literally quadrupled in size, yet he continued to talk and talk with these guys.  He could have asked these guys to step aside and take orders from customers who knew what they wanted, but instead the line kept growing and growing. I ordered the fish and chips which were good and they came out in a timely manner.  However, my friends ordered a variety of tacos which came out at different times, sometimes more than five minutes apart.  I will definitely be back because the food was very good and the price was right.  Once they work out some of their kinks I will have no problem giving them more stars."
"Despite the 20 min wait for food, I like the environment of the place but still wasn't entirely impressed by the food. I had the Hawaiian burger. I was disappointed they only put a tiny sliver of pineapple on it and dosed it so heavily with sauce it was all I could taste and it ended up everywhere. My boyfriend got the foie dog- wasn't impressed- and tacos that had barely any filling in it. There are too many other good burger, taco and hot dog joints in chicago, I probably won't be back."
"This is one of our new favorite spots!  Prices can't be beat.This location is very close to our children's school so I love that we can stop by for a quick bite on the way home. First off, let me just tell you that Omar, the Manager, is solid.  He truly seems like he enjoys his job and loves interacting with the customers.  He was super helpful in telling us how big the portions are, what items are good for the kids and which items we definitely needed to try.We ended up trying a few Mahi tacos, a Samurai taco and my husband had 2 Raw Ahi Tuna tacos. My kids had a grilled cheese and a cheeseburger.  We split the truffle and cajun fries. We were not disappointed with anything.  Everything was delicioso!  We can't wait to go back and try some more menu items."
"Ahi tuna taco - don't share with anyoneSoft shell crab po'boy - savor the momentsJapanese style ribs taco White fish tacoCajun FriesThese are officially a few of my favorite things. Ever.BYOBSuper friendly staffFRESH, REASONABLY PRICED, TASTYYYBIG & LITTLES, thank you for being so goodlove you, seriously.want to get married ? :)~"
"Had high expectations for this place.  Good area, nice restaurant on the inside. But there was a major problem. Portions.  I understand the original location is a bit more expensive but the portions can be huge. Why isnt this the same?  Im down with shelling out a few bucks to get some substantial grub.  Food was good. Ill have to try the other locationBummer."
"These were probably the weirdest tacos I've ever eaten. The sauce that they put on just does not taste right. The staff were very nice, but the tacos were awful."
"This was two days ago. First timer. Food was awesome! Place was packed! The great flavor of tacos definitely over shadowed the stress of lack of tables . Place is very small and it was raining outside so everyone was not in a hurry to leave. There was a wait but worth it! I had the Little taco , shrimp taco and Mexico short rib taco( aka barbacoa) and they were small but packed with flavor! Kimchi fries had a surprising twist to it! Very creative! Loved it! Totally recommend !"
"I don't really know why people give  four stars to this place, when this food is awful and totally OILY!!!"
"BIG & little's, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.I live about 2 blocks away from here.  Just moved from the suburbs about a month ago and always walked by BIG and little's but never made a move until last night.  My god, how had I not visited before then?The line was long.  Quite long, in fact.  But I was 2 strong drinks in from a work event and decided my patience was at its best at that moment.  Waited for roughly 25 minutes but again, didn't care.Their selection of tacos was fantastic.  They had something for everyone!  I ordered the Hawaiian Pork and Mango Chutney tacos along with the truffle fries.Before I say how awesome those were, the gentleman who was at the cash register was LOVELY.  Okay back to the tacos.  My god.  Amazing!  I practically inhaled my food.  The mango chutney was cooked perfecty. The hawaiian pork was a smidge spicy, but the good kind of smidge spicy.  Do I even need to remark on the truffle fries?  They were to die for.Now that I live so close to this place, I plan on stuffing my face with every other taco they serve there as well as the cheeseburgers. Thank god winter is coming (teehee) so I'll be able to hide my taco belly."
"Arguably the best place to get fish tacos in Chicago. I like that it's an unassuming place and you can get in and out in a hurry. And, most importantly, it won't cost you much. You can really get a ton of food for under $10 (3 tacos at $2.65 each...!) All of the fish tacos are tasty (I didn't try any of the meat ones) including the raw ahi ""poke taco"" which is an upgrade ($4.95), but totally worth it. The fish and chips are also fantastic here, and I'm a fan of the truffle fries as well. I can't speak to the burgers, po'boys, or burriots, but if you're craving fish tacos... you should definitely check it out. You won't be disappointed."
"I went here on a Monday afternoon a couple weeks ago. I was very overwhelmed by the menu since they offer a lot of different things and most of them sound amazing. I ended up going with the pork belly po boy since the cashier told me that's what Guy Fieri ordered when he visited. The sandwich was definitely delicious, but I think you need to be in the mood to eat something that's mostly fried. I'm excited to head back to try another one of their delicious offerings."
"The food is really great for the price. I especially recommend the tacos or the pulled pork sandwich. The real reason for five stars, though, is the amazing level of customer service. Everyone is SO friendly - especially the manager, Omar. It almost feels like you're being punked because they're so nice (kinda sad that it's that hard to find such an outstanding level of service!) I would definitely recommend stopping by B&L's if you're on Belmont. Yummmm."
"Came here in February (yeah, late review...) with my best homies at the suggestion of one of my friends who know the place was BYOB.  So we walk in with several adult bevs and snag a table for 6.  While the men were in line for food, the girls reminisced and drank fruity juice boxes.The atmosphere is most definitely divey and can be difficult to find from the street.  Driving down Belmont, just look for a small parking lot.  That parking lot probably contains a tiny little awning and the door leading into BIG & little's.  Once you get in you'll most likely be greeted by a long single-file line.  Make your way around the line and find a table.  They've got 2 seating areas.  One area that shares the room with the cashier, kitchen, and expo area.  The second is through a door and leads to another room that is for seating only.Among the 6 of us we ordered the (MASSIVE) fish & chips, softshell crab tacos, pork belly po' boy, and a messload of fries.  Seriously.  We got cajun fries, cheese fries, and of course... foie gras fries.  Now, at $11 the foie gras fries are definitely more of a novelty.  I live in California now and the state recently banned the raising and sale of geese for this purpose so my boyfriend finally wanted to a have a taste.  They were... meh.  Basically just delicious fries with a moderate amount of livers sprinkled on top.  Get it if you want to try foie gras (although I'm pretty sure it's all good in IL) but the other fries are just as tasty and have a better value.All in all, love the food.  Cheap AND gourmet?  Sign me up!  Love the BYOB!  Love the atmosphere!  Just be sure you bring enough cash money and be prepared to search for parking!  I'll definitely be back!"
"I am a big fan of the original location and now I am an even bigger fan of B&L's #2. They managed to duplicate the great tasting food and friendly staff and installed it in a more convenient and accessible location.What's different and better than the original? 1. They are no longer cash only, they now take cards. (big plus) 2. The truffle fries at #2 are better! Not sure what's different about them, but they are super delish. Thanks B&L's, for putting a location closer to your fans. Now I can come visit more often. YUM!"
"The place smells delicious - I'll give them that. But how about more deliciousness in the actual food? The shrimp po boy was so bland. I was hungry and in the end food is food - yes, I said it - but nothing to rave about. I've had better shrimp at the local Red Hot Ranch. Soooo yeah. Go elsewhere I say!"
"Can't wait to come back to Chicago to eat here again! We went to the new location. The place is coooool and the tacos are bomb. The guy at the counter was super friendly and answered all the silly questions I had about his favorite tacos. I was blown away by the taste/quality-to-price ratio of the tacos. My sister and I split the banh mi (fresh!), big and little's (dat special sauce), al pastor (pork belly goodness) and spicy beef short rib (sooo succulent). My boyfriend got the hawaiian burger which was also very tasty, but the tacos are where the money's at IMHO. They had a special of kimchi fries which were so GD good. I don't know what sauce they poured over the fries but I would pour that over ANYTHING and eat it with my hands. I digress. Next time I'm going to order all the other tacos and maybe a po'boy for dessert and have a party all by myself."
"Big & Little's is way better than I thought it would be. I was so surprised after tasting their food and getting my bill. Cheap burgers, po boys, fish tacos, and even truffle fries? The atmosphere inside is a little overwhelming, though. Music is blasting, but it feels like a take out place (cheap chairs, not super clean, bright lights). The food does take awhile to cook, but it's all made to order and delicious. It's worth it, especially if you can grab it to go and eat somewhere less hectic and packed."
"Really good little bites and definitely worth a try when it's not busy. I would give 5 stars but unfortunately this place doesn't know how to handle their huge crowds yet. A long line can easily mean an hour wait or more for some tacos which is just not worth it. However, on a regular day with a regular wait, their ahi tacos and every one of their seafood bites is delicious."
"I had a fantastic shrimp po'boy. .. with Banh Mi ingredients: cucumber, red pickled onion, cilantro, black sesame seeds, pickled jalapeños,  carrot, and special sauce (chili aioli). It was so good, I had to get a second one! I will be back!"
"Friendly service from Huge was a great welcome. The food kept things good.Zeus burger was terrific. Light pink burger, topped with seasoned gyro meat, feta cheese, a fried egg, and tzatziki sauce. Delicious. Messy, but delicious.Phil's fries, aka truffle fries with a fried egg, were also tasty.All in all, definitely worth eating here."
"I had heard about Big & LIttle's some time ago and JUST recently got a chance to visit their Belmont location. We got there at Noon on a Saturday and luckily walked in and sat right down at a vacant booth. My husband stood in line for over 15 minutes but the meal was worth the wait. We got a shrimp taco, a pork belly poboy, fish and chips as well as truffle fries. Everything was awesome. I tried to save some of my poboy for later that afternoon but i couldnt stop eating it. I admit i did tear of some of the fat but aside from that.. i cant stop thinking about it. Counting down the minutes until i can return for another one. Pictures on Instagram at LDANOVIA."
"After a very unsatisfying delivery experience, the manager and owner both reached out to me immediately to resolve the situation. Very impressed with their customer service and very excited to try their food at the Belmont location in Chicago. Cannot comment on the actual food yet, but from previous reviews and the outstanding customer service I received, I am sure it will be a very positive experience."
"been here numerous times and their pork is consistently terrible - like a gamey  taste. Had the ban mi burrito twice and both times I tossed half out.   on the other hand, thier various fish tacos are awesome, just wish they were larger."
"I love tacos.....i really do.....so when I first saw BIG and little's menu i was a bit concerned with the uniqueness of each taco. Even as an asian guy, the Samurai Taco seemed suspect....So i decided to order a standard noahs ark for my girlfriend and myself (2 of all the specialty tacos that sounded particularly good). Needless to say, the fish tacos were outstanding. But the true champion of the bunch (and the taco with the most replay value) was definitely the Lamb Taco.... Imagine if you will a mini gyro....take out all of the sloppiness usually associated with a gyro and keep all of the choice flavors of delicious lamb, tzatziki and delicately sliced tomatoes. next time i am ordering 3 lamb tacos and some of them truffle fries......game over."
"I had B&L burger for lunch and some fish, fried shrimp & mahi tacos for dinner from Big and Little's this Thursday the 5th. Had stomach issues both times. Too much of a coincidence given that I didn't have any other food that day and generally have no food allergies or other related issues like that. Otherwise, the place has a good vibe to it and so I kinda wish my experience was different.PS went to this place once previously with no issues and was generally satisfied that time."
"This place is great lots of options to choose from. They got the meat, fish and vegetarian down. Great atmosphere and music while you eat some awesome grub!! Will return to this place. The other thing is the restroom are nice and clean."
"EGG BURGER. Done. My co-workers and I treat ourselves here (tacos are a bit pricey, but so what? TREAT YO' SELF! Or get a burger?) The staff here is super sweet and generous and patient. Given their eclectic menu, I have seen some people spend approx 5 minutes deciding on their order, and the cashiers take it like a champ! Some of their specials are a hit or miss (kimchi fries = ehhhh, samurai taco [chipotle spicy tuna with a fried egg] = yessssss).If you give this place 4 stars, you're nuts and high-maintenance... you DO know this is a burger joint that also sells random, delicious tacos, right? I don't think ""CHANGING THE WORLD"" is high on their priority list... although they HAVE changed my world... Even less than 4 stars? You probably don't have a tongue."
"Fresh from a 2 week trip around Italy I came back to Chicago wanting some delicious American food and I couldn't have picked a better place. The attitude and decor of the place is very 90's which is a super cool vibe for the 20 something generation. The staff is super friendly and forthcoming with suggestions. The guy who took our order made me feel like a regular even though it was my first time. The menu has some great reworking of American classics. Also an extensive list of both fish and meat tacos. Complete with fresh tuna and crab options. I got the BBQ burger, a Samurai taco, and an order of truffle fries. The burger was cooked perfectly topped with crispy bacon, grilled onion, and a little bit of BBQ sauce that didnt over power the other flavors. I'd definitely recommend the samurai taco to anyone who comes by. I don't have enough experience with Asian fusion food to comment too much on all the different flavors that it contained but trust me and try it. The truffle fries were honestly the only part of the meal I felt weren't super special. They didn't have enough truffle flavor for me and I honestly wouldn't have known the difference if you told me they were regular old fries. With that said they were still good for french fries. All in all I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Chicago to try out some other options for the extensive menu."
Take recommendations seriously. Every fish taco I tried was awesome. It seems to always be busy so patience is key.
"FEEEEELS LIKE THE FIIIIIIIIIIIIRST TIIIIIME!!! FEEEELS LIKE THE VERRY FIRST TIME!!!! See my prev review, def deserve 5 stars, go here. Dude behind the counter is legit my favorite person in the world. His recco's are on point, today it was the Bahn Mi Pork burrito, for $6?!?! Great deal, just needed to come in one more 'gain."
"We came here on yelp's recommendation and damn are we happy we did!  The tacos were super yummy, my friend's burger (Al Pastor) was apparently life changing as she proclaimed after ""all other burgers are ruined for me now,"" and the people working we're suuuuper nice (especially the big dude behind the register)!! We will 100% come back here again next time we're in Chicago! Thanks for the delish lunch!"
"We've been waiting forever for this location to open! Ordered the fish and chips with truffle fries and they're freaking amazing! I'm not a big fan of malt vinegar, but their's is actually pretty good. Please be patient when you order since they are still working out some kinks. We didn't have to wait that long though, probably 5 mins or so.Oh and lastly, the prices are lower than their other location. Can't argue with that!"
"I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS PLACEfries fried in truffle oil for god's sake.........what can be better than that. I had three tacos, don't remember which ones but they were fantastic.I didn't think I'd ever have good fish tacos again after leaving CA but boy was I wrong. love love love big & little's!"
Great friendly staff. I had the lamb burrito. It was cooked to perfection. The greek sauce and feta were an excellent addition to the lamb. Prices are very reasonable.
It's definitely good. I have never dined in but have taken food to go. Shrimp banh mi poboy is good. BUT so much special sauce. Which is mayo based. The guy at the counter is awesome and should get a raise. Always busy. Check it out.
"As good as it gets and then some. This place deserves every penny you give them. I have been going there weekly for about six months. The food is inexpensive and stellar. You will not find this quality food for the price anywhere else in the city. I suggest the Mahi Tacos grilled (if fish tacos are your thing), but everything is high quality and delicious (and in many cases healthy). To top it all off, the service is impeccable. While the peak meal times do find this place packed (and for good reason), they handle the crowds with grace and patience. The kitchen staff is quick and the customer service is also the best I have found in the city. Don't let the crowds scare you off at peak time either - you can always call ahead and get takeout (and jump the line to pay). Everything I have had on the menu has been perfect every time, and I like giving my money to good people who are good at their jobs."
"I think this place is amazing. Super nice staff, affordable prices, and good vibes. I will most definitely be coming back and highly recommend for any one to try this place."
"I've been here twice now and really enjoyed it each time.  The selection is great and the food is really delicious.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  A very casual, fun place to get great food."
"I got a bad case of Yelp Hype-related disappointment. Kudos to BIG & Little's for trying some creative and weird things. The two of us got a fried white fish taco, ahi tuna poke taco, pork belly po-boy, and 2 fountain drinks. The total order (with tax, before tip) was $20 and some change. I wouldn't say it was overpriced, but the portions are somewhat small. which wouldn't be bad if the meal had been a little better. Then again, ahi tuna isn't cheap. The ahi tuna taco was DELICIOUS. After that, it goes somewhat downhill. The pork belly po-boy was upsetting because the actual pork belly, the part of it you want, is bastardized. The pork belly was cubed and fried (it looked very similar to fried breakfast potatos). It didn't taste terrible, but it wasn't very flavorful. Very sad. The white fish taco was okay flavor wise, but the piece of fish was kind of weird of shriveled. The sauce they used on it was very good though. Finally, I appreciate that there was fountain Cherry Coke. But...the syrup was starting to run out. So I had a slightly carbonated and sweetened caramel colored beverage.3 stars because this score needs to be evened out. Del Seoul in Lincoln Park is BIG & Little's with a smaller menu but better taste and presentation. The staff was very pleasant. Don't change that! I will be back for the ahi tuna taco and to try the truffle fries. And maybe when I'm drunk it'll taste better."
Amazing food! Amazing staff! Amazing service!!
"Unbelievable. Myself and a few buddies came here after a long, long weekend of drinking,. I must say, our Sunday was not complete without this. I had the hickory burger and the other half of us has the cheddar burger. Single of course. You seriously do not need the double unless you are looking to go into food coma. The burger came to us within a few minutes, perfectly cooked unlike the burger we had previously gotten at Merkels the day before. I could still hear the cow screaming it was so fresh and medium rare. I also got the plain fries, but my buddy got the truffle fries. I high recommend using that other red container on the table instead of ketchup. Its a mix of bbq and hot sauce. Crazy! Everything was out of this world. All for a measly 10 bucks too. I will for sure be coming back when i visit my buddies in IL."
"Wow!  After yesterday's Cubs game, I decided I had to try B&L.  Menu is a little overwhelming, so being the smartass that I am told I am, I had to ask for a special order.  Crispy pork belly al pastor poboy.  They went with it and produced  a very memorable sandwich.  Great French fries on the side.  Phenomenal staff really seem to want to make things right.Funky interior; patio seating.This was a memorable experience and I will return whenever in the area.Amazing how many orders were sent out by bike delivery folks.."
"Fish Tacos, Meat Tacos, Poke Tacos, Po' Boys, Fish & Chips and OMG those truffle fries.Haven't had a bad thing yet, and that goes for both of their locations. A lot of their tacos are spicy, which is always a plus for me. Incredibly unique menu, uber casual atmosphere, and I am so glad this location takes credit cards!Word on the street is they have a killer burger, so be on the lookout for an updated review."
Great little casual place with lots of flavor - lots of character.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Gotta try the tacos.  Love the raw Ahi but the more traditional choices are great too.
"Everything I had here was average. Very disappointed.  Nothing was bad but nothing was great. Tried three diff tacos, pork belly po boy, and truffle fries. The stand out was def the fries but they were very salty made it hard to eat. The pork belly was so not seasoned and the po boy itself was not good, Cole slaw just didnt fit in with the sandwich. What made the experience not so bad I had a groupon which payed for my entire meal. I would not return. Many better options in the area."
"Good people, good vibes and most importantly, good food. The Crab Po Boy and truffle fries are on point. The Kimchi french fries are pretty good, but also really salty. Wouldn't get those again. Regardless, I am sold. This place is awesome."
"Did not find this place to be any special as others that talk so highly about it. The tacos are sooo tiny definitely not worth paying that much for them.  Had 3 different ones but only liked the Japanese. Fish and chips, the fish was too mushy and not great tasting at all. Tried both their cajun fries and truffle fries. The cajun fries were pretty good but the truffle fries were nothing special.  Its a loud and small place with just street parking.  Would not come back here again."
"Perhaps 3 years of built up expectations left me with an unobtainable vision of Big and Little's,  but the soft shell crab po boy was a huge disappointment.  The bread, spicy mayo and pickles were great, even the iceberg lettuce added to the sandwich, but the soft shell crab was quite small and still contained some shell or skin under the fried batter, I'm not exactly sure but it wasn't pleasant to eat. I enjoyed the bites with out the crab the most... which luckily was at least half the sandwich. Cashier suggested the Samuri taco, it was fried something, doesn't say on the menu, really good, loaded with a sweet teryaki type sauce and lots of iceberg lettuce. Nice steady service at noon during the week and only half the seats were full. They said they are still working on their hours but for now open at 11am-10pm during the week and later on weekends. They have a large menu, so I will be back to try a burger or some more tacos, but no more shellie crab po-boys for me!"
"This place NAILED it. Fresh hot tasty & nice helpful employees with great attitudes. It doesn't get any better only different at other places. I had the Samurai taco, short rib taco & Kim chi fries. All were great. Especially the samurai."
"I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt. The atmosphere is awesome and the people there all treated me really well and I felt really at home in their cozy dining room with the windows open listening to some dope hip hop (Common, the roots, Talib Kweli), I really do. From the moment I walked in the door I really liked this place.Ultimately, I can't get over the fact that the food I ordered was not good. The cajun fries were fine. Definitely worth what I paid for them (Prices are VERY reasonable.) but the pork banh mi burrito was... Very bad. It was advertised as spicy, which is why I ordered it, but I only had one bite of spice the whole sandwich (when I bit into a jalepeno. Om nom nom) and the whole thing was cloyingly, overwhelmingly sweet. It tasted as if the pickled veggies were actually candied and the ""spicy sauce"" actually just tasted like simple syrup. I couldn't finish it. It was not edible. I almost never leave food on the table when I go out to eat, but this was just that bad. I'll probably go back and give them another try (with a different menu item) because like I said I liked everything else about the place, but man was this a disappointing first experience."
This place is the shit! The food is fresh and amazing! Have questions on the menu? Ask Omar (Huge) he knows every dish through and through.  With charisma to kill and an undeniably great brand he's the perfect concierge to top off your experience.  Congrats on the 2nd restaurant guys!  Rec: raw ahi taco (sushi grade). Samurai is also very popular.
"Fairly large menus of a bunch of what seems like great drunk foods (tacos, burritos, po boys, and other stuff).  We only got the tacos, and in general they were very good.  An unusal one that is apparently very popular here is the Ahi taco, which I would recommend anyone that likes raw tuna to get at least once.  Prices are middle of the road for what you get.  BYOB!"
"The 3 stars is for the food itself. I would give it 4 for the service. Oscar was welcoming and super friendly, and food came out pretty fast. Food on the otherhand was a bit disappointing.NOTE: I've been to the original B&L's and loved it. I got a poboy and burger my very first visit downtown and it was good. but lakeview, we were notified the servings are smaller and prices are lower (not a bad thing).At the lakeview location I got some tacos and fries:- Poke soft shell crab taco - the best out of the 3 I got. Hardshell and light/fresh. Comes with a lemon- Japanese short rib taco - the most disappointing. presentation fell short and was given very little filling to split between two tortillas. It would've been better had it included a fresh ingredient like slaw- fried tilapia taco - not too much flavor, nothing great- phil's fries - a fried egg on top of truffle fries. Pretty decent, nothing great. Note: fries are bigger at this locationMaybe I need to try one of the burgers, burritos or poboys to give this place an accurate review. Or maybe I just got the weaker tacos. Regardless, I would still come back to try more."
"Happened to walk by at 10:30 AM on a Wednesday and noticed it was open. Walked in and was the only customer-sweet!   Figured I'd be in and out in no time- Wrong. They took my order right away, but they were so busy processing delivery orders, it took 20 minutes for a very simple order to go. Surprised that a live customer has to wait while dozens of delivery orders are processed. Minus one star for this. If Omar were on the register, this wouldn't have happened."
"Big and Little's is worth the trip. With a wide variety of choices in the menu and exceptional service I'll be returning to try other tasty items. I had the suggested soft shell crab po'boy, and it did not disappoint. 'Huge' took my order and also enlightened me about another off menu ahi tuna po'boy sandwich that I will try next time. Service, great food, and at an affordable cost makes Big and Little's a nice place to bring friends who want something aside from the bland bar food."
"Love the new location, as it is much more convenient for me and is not cash only.  The food here is amazing! I've been twice now and have gotten 5 tacos between the visits and can't decide what I like best because it is all so good. Last night I had the spicy Thai fish, Mexican beef, and the mango chutney. The pork on the mango chutney was perfect and had some crispy edges. The prices, the variety, and the service are what draws me in. My boyfriend and I each had 3 tacos last night and some fries, and it was about $20 total. It's BYOB too, and there's patio seating on Kenmore. The guys at this counter are always friendly and cheerful, which just adds to the greatness of this place because I feel like that's something you're seeing less and less of these days with the busy restaurants like this."
I had the Bahn Mi burrito. ...it was amazing in every aspect. Can't wait to go back and try something different. Or maybe I'll get the burrito again!
It's been 5 months since B&L open. Update: my favorite place to go to! Omar is the bomb and Brendan is friggin awesome! Omar runs the front desk and is so personable and passionate in what he does. He also remembers names after a few times of going there. Brendan is the head cook and so diligent and passionate as well. I do not know the rest of the staffs name but they are all great and friendly. Besides all that the food is awesome. I have tried a few of their hamburgers on the menu and all their tacos. Can't go wrong the owners know what they are doing. When they have special I try them too and am never disappointed. Currently my fav is the raw ahi tuna hamburger!
"With all the hype over this place I thought I give it a go.  Well, I wasn't impressed.  The food was greasy, bland, and uninspired. The portion sizes where on the small side and the prices were a little expensive. The whole place smelled like grease, and the floors where slick with grease.  On the upside the staff was very friendly and helpful."
"Quick Review: Love it.If you go here, you will  not be disappointed!I went to BIG and little's before a Cubs game. I am not from Chicago (only here for 5 weeks), so take this with a grain of salt, but I would eat here every single day if I could. I ordered the Samurai Taco and the Zeus Burger. Lord help me.Let's start with the burger. Well seasoned beef with slices of gyro meat blended beautifully with amazing tzatziki  sauce and fresh feta. Oh, and the crown glory, a perfectly cooked fried egg. Honestly, I could have used more gyro meat and less burger, but holy moly I loved this burger.The taco was easily the best taco I've ever had in my life. Keep in mind, I haven't had many tacos, but even if I had, this would still be #1. Breaded white fish, jalapeños, and a special sauce... try this taco. TRY THIS TACO. My review can't do this delectable meal justice. Also, location, location, location. This couldn't be easier to get to. Just hop on the red line and take it to Belmont. It's about a block away.And did I mention it's cheap? And the employees look like they actually care about their job?"
Love this place!  Just awesome food with a decent variety of choices for each style. Highly recommend short rib tacos and Zeus burger. I  usually see this one big guy behind the counter I think he's the manager (wanna say Omar? Sorry if it's not) maybe the friendliest dude ever. Really awesome customer service everytime.  Oh and its BYOB to boot!
Two words Truffle Fries.
"The ahi tuna poke and samurai tacos were superb. The al pastor burger, pork belly Po boy, and mexican beef and carnitas tacos were all just mediocre at best. The atmosphere didn't score any points with me and sad to say really effects my decision on returning"
"I was passing through town and wanted some lunch, so I asked Yelp where I ought to go and was directed here, and I'm so glad!  I was in a bit of a mood when I arrived after some traffic annoyances, and for such a supposedly popular place it was deserted when I entered, which is never encouraging, although to be fair they'd only been open ten minutes.  Also, the floor was...I don't know, greasy?  I almost slipped.  But once I ordered my food and got it, all was forgiven.  I had the ahi tuna taco, which was basically a crispy shell filled with sushi tuna and it was delicious.  I also had the spicy thai taco and the spicy beef short rib taco.  The fries were good, not spectacular.  But the tacos were super delicious.  I'd like to return and try the rest of them!  By the time I left, the place was hopping."
"Went here yesterday and ordered a bunch of food. It was a humid day, and I'm not sure if they have AC, but the inside was warm. They do have tables outside, so I opted to sit outside which was nice, and they even came out and brought some of our food to us. (they call your name when the food is ready) I got the Crab po'boy, big & little taco, shrimp taco, pork taco, a cheee burger,  the tuna poke taco, truffle fries and kimchi fries.  The place is BYOB so that's also a plus.The truffle fries were really good and I actually had two orders. However the portions very greatly, and was significantly less than the other. Kimchi fries were delicious, but not as good as the ones at Del Seul. I love the seafood/fusion concept. The Crab po-boy looked exactly how it does in the pictures. It was visually appealing, and good, but it was a small portion. The tacos are small portions, but were very good. My one complaint was that the pork taco was drier than I would like, but overall the food was delicious. I will be back."
"One of my favorite joints in the entire city. Their River North location is fantastic, too.I've honestly never eaten anything I didn't like here. The food is simply excellent. They have a lot of variety and they can personalize it, too. You usually have about a 15 minute wait on the grill, but it's BYOB, so you pop open a beer and your food arrives before you can finish a bottle.The staff here is incredible, also. My parents have been going to the other location for a little over a year and the staff remembers them, greets them, and really appreciated their business. I wish nothing but the best for this establishment!"
I was enticed by Groupon to try BIG & little's and it was a treat!  The samurai and ahi tuna tacos were terrific.  I also tried to softshell crab po boy which was quite good.  I could instantly tell that the man at the counter was quite friendly and in charge and the 6 person crew in the kitchen appear to work quite well as a team.
"YUM. If you like seafood or tacos, do yourself a favor and come here for the seafood tacos.Also, their special sauce or signature sauce (whatever they call that addicting orange stuff) is amazing.I recommend the softshell crab and fried shrimp tacos if you're a newbie.The only complaint I have is that the fries are not the best, I found them oversalted and soggy. But the star is really the tacos, so go get some of those!"
Tried the zeus burger: it was actually pretty good. My boyfriend had the samurai taco & the lamb taco & he liked it too. Pretty good for the price too.
"great variety, fun for the whole family!"
"I was walking through the neighborhood and was instantly woo'd by the menu and the very warm host. My date and I got two Raw Tuna Poke Tacos, the Mango Chutney Pork Taco, a Samurai Taco (grilled fish), a Grilled Shrimp Taco, and a Crab Taco. With soda, it was close to thirty dollars and wasn't that much food: the portion of (tasty) pork in the Mango Chutney Taco was extremely stingy compared to the delicious Tuna Poke, which was mouth-watering and filled the shell to the brim. The Samurai Taco, a fried Whitefish taco with an aioli and spare dressings, tasted like most fish tacos I've had in trendy neighborhoods. Good, but very average.The grilled shrimp taco, however, was inedible. It was basically a shrimp cocktail with a bit of greens. Yes, cocktail sauce on a taco. Gross. We didn't finish it.So the best tacos seem to be the $5 ones, and the rest were okay / mediocre. But the $5 tacos were soooo good that I'm going to have to give this place another try. There's also a decent selection of po'boys I'd love to nosh on. It's too bad their bread-and-butter tacos were so disappointing."
"Super yummy, really affordable. Try the truffle fries, the Hawaiian burger and the Japanese Beef Short Rib Taco. Skip the lamb taco."
"Everything is excellent here - from the delicious menu to the fabulous staff! I've tried just about everything, and here are my 3 faves: HAWAIIAN PORK TACO - seriously, this taco rules in every aspect, and I could eat several of them daily; shimp taco - delish!; fried shrimp po' boy - best one I've had outside of N'Awlins. OK, so while those are my favorites, everything is great, so get one of everything and pick your own faves - the daily specials are also amazing (as is the blue crab taco, and the truffle fries, and the...).So glad they opened this location so I can walk to this place and pre-burn the calories! ;)"
"The pork belly PoBoy was outstanding. Their truffle fries were excellent as well. Friendly service to match. I had some of my friend's tacos - al pastor, Japanese short ribs, and Mexican short ribs. They were very good too."
"My husband and I, on an impromptu trip to Chicago, decided to try this place out after reading that it was on diners, drive ins and dives. The place lived up to the hype and more. We went on a Saturday around 12:15. There was a small lineup that went pretty quickly. ""Big"" took our order, and was so friendly. Really nice guy. The food... I ordered the cheeseburger, cooked medium rare (hard to find that in Canada). My husband got the soft shell crab sandwich. Both were amazing. The burger was perfectly cooked. We also shared a side of fries, which were great. If we were here longer we would totally go back. The tacos look amazing. Tried some of the hot sauce on the table, and it was delicious. Definitely worth a visit!"
"Coming from Southern California, this place has some big shoes to fill.  While nothing will compare to Mexican seafood as does on the west coast, this place comes in a very close second.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  I even had a chance to speak with the owner at the other location.  This food is really good and does the job in satisfying my cravings when I get homesick.  I always get the big and little's and shrimp tacos.  I will always be coming back to this place as its a little reminder of home for me!"
"Just as good as the original, but closer to home and takes credit cards. This is a huge plus considering I always forget to pull out cash before visiting their other location. My favorites are the many different tacos, including the non-traditional poke taco. This place is also a great, quick, pre-dinner spot before catching a show at the Vic."
"Huge is probably one of my favorite people to ever walk this planet. He's got the warmest heart and a golden memory. Tacos are excellent all the time, but I'm all about that Hawaiian burger life with truffle fries. Omg. I dig this place so much."
"OMG I can't seem to decide on a favorite anything. I've been wowed by everything I've eaten here. I guess I do particularly enjoy the Ahi Poke taco. Oh and there is a SPECIAL taco you will see on a hand written sign by the register that is THE BEST thy take their samurai fish taco and make it a ""rising sun"" by adding a whole fried egg. HOT DAMN. Also the staff here is on point, so give Omar at the register a fist bump and enjoy some good eats."
"I went to Big N Littles for the first time last week to meet some friends for a quick dinner. After reading over the menu and Yelp extensively, The staff was very friendly and offere suggestions, I settled on the Shrimp Bahn Mi Po Boy and Truffle Fries. I was disappointed with the sandwich, it was dry and lacked a lot of garnish I've had on other Bahn Mi sandwiches-- (also I am spoiled and live across from Del Seoul, and i LOVE their shrimp everything), the truffle fries were soggy but tasty. My friend had the Japanese Short Rib tacos and those were GREAT, i ended up throwing out the rest of my po boy and getting just one taco for myself. I will come back and give their tacos another try but take my shrimp cravings elsewhere."
"I was very excited to try this place out after seeing it featured on a couple programs. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. The food was decent, nothing extraordinary. The tacos are so small you can finish an entire one in two bites. My biggest complaint is how salty/over seasoned the fries were (both cajun and truffle flavors)."
"Excellent burger al pastor... medium rare with pork belly, jalapenos, yummy sauce and pineapple... wow!!  Awesome bang for the buck at $5.95, too!  Hubby got the soft shell crab po boy and enjoyed it although pretty bready since the crab itself was smaller than the bun.  We also tried the Japanese short rib taco (sweet and spicy... yummm!!) and the ahi taco.  All this for about $21 is a solid deal.  Will be back!"
"Yes, please.This place seemed pretty happening on a Sunday night, so I stopped by.  I got three tacos, the grilled mahi, the samurai, which was recommended, and another one, which I don't remember.  The mahi was just okay, but that samurai was fantastic.  I finished my meal feeling like a big ol fatty.I also got the cajun fries.  They weren't bad, but nothing to write home about; I'd pass on them.  I'll try the truffle ones next time."
"AMAZING. Seriously one of my favorite spots in the city. Great tacos, great quality great price. A must if you like tacos."
"Overpriced, but other than that, pretty good.  The tacos are TINY and very pricey.  The restaurant has great atmosphere, though, and was kept clean by employees and the manager constantly walking around.  They also made great recommendations, and checked in at least three times to make sure I liked everything.As far as the food goes, I thought the hawaiian pork taco was just okay.  I know everyone else seems to love it, but I wasn't that impressed.  The lamb taco is basically a mini gyro.  Nothing special, but everything was perfect on it.  The gyro was a little crispy on the outside but still juicy (read-greasy) overall, just the way a perfect Chicago gyro would be.  The tzatziki was flavorful and the perfect consistency.  Not solid, but not running all over the place either.  The real star of the show, though, was the al pastor taco.  Perfect mixture of spicy (not really hot, but definitely flavorful spices), sweet, and savory.  Pickled onion was just tangy enough, but not overwhelming.Overall, nothing wowed me enough to convince me that it was worth the price to go back, but I also wasn't disappointed.  If they had specials or lowered their prices, I'd probably go back again."
"Tacos were INCREDIBLE.  Po' Boy was the best I have had in the city.  Actually, the only good one I have had in the city.  The service was great and I found the guy behind the counter, HUGE, to be very helpful, knowledgeable and pleasant.The wait was a little long but it was Saturday so I expected it.  If you like tacos and fried food do not skip this place.  It's legit."
"Stopped in here for the first time today and really enjoyed it! Have walked by many times and thought that it would be more of a greasy diner type place but was pleasantly surprised today. Staff was nice and very helpful. Gave us great recommendations and even suggested modifications to accommodate my friend who has Celiac (gluten free). Yes, the servings are pretty small but I like that because it allows me to try several things. And the prices are appropriate to the serving size.Will definitely make this a regular for take out/delivery!"
"This place was a happy accident.  We were looking for a place to eat and happened to find ourselves at the front door.  So naturally we went in.  I looked up and was surprised to see The Food Network logo with Guy Fiere's face spray painted above the door.  In a way it's kind of like a seal of approval...Anyhow, I was overwhelmed by the menu, so my friend and I just decided to pick from the taco menu and taste the rainbow.  When we got to the cashier, I asked what the most popular items were, (which included the Ahi Taco...DO IT!) And which were her favorites.  In total we ordered 10 tacos to split (keep in mind there were only 2 of us...) Most were hits, but I'm not gonna lie, there were a few misses-  which is just a matter of taste really.  But for about $3 a taco, how can you really go wrong?I can't wait to go back and dig into the burritos."
"This over the counter gem is an absolute welcome addition to the Lakeview Belmont neighborhood.  I live a block away and try my best not to eat here more than once a week.Try the Hawaiian taco and/or the Thai Bahn Mi Burrito.  You can't lose as I've tried almost every taco.Living so close, I see Omar, the manager there, on my way to work every day.  Not only did he recognize my girlfriend and I, but he made it a point to learn our names and say hello (even when we're walking back with Chipotle).  Great and genuine dude with a kind and hospitable attitude to all customers.Stop in and try it!"
"Wow.These tacos are insane.  I know they have other food on the menu but I've never bothered to try it because, well, the tacos.  The lamb tacos are amazing.  The al pastor taco is fantastic.  And the Japanese beef short rib taco: Jesus Christ.  It's good.  Yeah, sure, it was weird when I ordered some for delivery and they had the word ""jap"" written on them.  World War II was a long time ago, fellas.  And, for what it's worth each time since they've gone with the letter ""J.""It's a fun vibe here.  Wait in line (which can be long), order food, wait a not long period of time at all for food (how they cram that many dudes into that little kitchen I'll never know), and experience bliss.Ignore the delivery labels.  Get the tacos."
"Great food, excellent service.....always amazing grub at B&L's.  Samurai, Short Rib Tacos and Soft Shell Crab Po Boys are a MUST HAVE!"
"The only way this place could be any better is if it served breakfast tacos (which this city is lacking, but that's a different topic) My go to order, always tacos, the Hawaiian pork, spicy pork, Mexican beef, spicy beef! I can't choose a favorite out of those 4. My husband loves th el pastor. If I had to be overly critical, the tacos are on the small side for the price, but totally worth it."
"This place is AWESOME. Great food. Check other reviews for favorites, but anything is delicious. Burritos, Po boys, you name it.Only thing is if you are going on a Friday/Saturday night, don't go on a rush. It might take a little while for you to get your food. But it'll be worth it.1 star off cause when they're busy, you wait a while. Just go with good friends and you won't have to worry bout the wait."
I love everything I've tried here! The classic shrimp po boy is mind blowing! Better than the ones I've had in New Orleans! The poke taco is amazing! The burgers are juicy! The staff is super friendly !
"Rarely do i feel the need to write a review so badly before I even eat my food -- but wow does this place rub me the RIGHT way.Right from the start things went well, from the cutie behind the counter, to the attentive service on a To-Go order.I asked ""Big"" if I could get some hot sauce to go (at least i think he was ""big"" i guess they could be an ironic duo and he was ""little"" but who knows really)Rather than just pointing to the corner and saying its right over there, he walked me over, grabbed me a to-go cup for sauce, and told me to make myself at home, take all and as much as I like.We need more places like this in Chicago, places that have owners that LOVE what they do, that love pleasing every person that comes in there (although...lakeview, doubt that's possible...even if you get the order right you are wrong).If you want to know how the food is -- read the other reviews, its amazing. Theres nothing I can add that ""Adam K."" hasn't already said in his review thats right next to this box as I type, its ""BOMB BOMB BOMB"" and someone needs to ""Call the bomb squad"""
I wish the tacos were bigger but I will say they ate very creative. They also have a great variations on types of food.  The mix of flavors in my white fish tacos was great
"YUM!  This place completely exceeded our expectations. The samurai taco has tender whitefish that melts in your mouth.  The mango chutney pork taco comes together beautifully. And the poke ahi tuna taco just works and is bursting with flavor! The shrimp po'boy was perfect with good balance of bread & shrimp & topping. I loved the Cajun fries!  The cherries on top are the super friendly staff (little kids know the cashier by first name), speedy service, cleanliness, and good music.  A place like this is needed in the loop!  Just awesome."
"This place is phenomenal. Omar is amazing and he is ALWAYS there (not complaining)! My daddy had seen this place on Food Network and had been telling me for months to go! I told him I wanted to wait until he could visit me in Chicago and come with me! He was planning to visit when I have my baby girl (due at the end of May).. But he suddenly passed away just 5 weeks before.. Upon returning to Chicago from his funeral, I went to Big and Little's the first day back in the city. I cried only a little when I told Omar the story. I tried the Pork Belly Po' Boy and the truffle fries. Both AMAZING. I have been back 4 more times (in 4 weeks lol) and it's nice that Omar remembers me and my story... And I've tried the Japanese tacos and the Honky Burrito (truffle fries all day).. Seriously epic. Prices are great (the tacos could add up, but it's worth it!).. I'm moving back to Kansas soon, but this is DEFINITELY a place I will visit probably weekly until we leave. Definitely recommend."
Beat tacos ever love the pork belly and hot dogs. Very easy to find parking on weekdays. Affordable and tasty!!
"What more could you want than a fresh, flaky fried fish taco for $2.65 with a side of upbeat 90's throwback reggae? Great food, atmosphere for all ages, and customer service."
"Great tacos with some really interesting flavors.  I personally love the gyro taco and the samurai taco.  The kimchi fries are also really good, but need to be shared!  The only reason it's 4 and not 5 stars is that they don't package things very well for delivery, so it's always quite messy, particularly for a place to charge $5 for delivery fee alone (pre-tip)."
"This place is so wonderful. The food is 5 stars, and the service is 5 stars. Everyone should come here, y'all will love it! The samurai taco is amazing. YUM. the truffle fries are super tasty, but small. I wouldn't recommend sharing them. (I may have just gotten 2 orders, for myself.) Big is usually at the counter, and he is so nice! Very friendly and great at giving recommendations. Awesome place.Edit: it's Omar. Not big. My bad. He's still great :)"
"This is going to be a condensed review because I only have a little bit of time today. With that disclaimer out of the way, I'm going to tell you about this new place on Belmont Avenue, BIG & little's. Before this place came around, there was a big void on the north side when it came to quality, greasy food. Yeah there were spots like the Weiner Circle (a place that I think is a big mess. I like a little hospitality with my fried food.) Nowhere around could you dine with even a little bit of confidence. Nowadays that problem is solved. They have a big menu but every item tastes like a little slice of heaven and is presented with extensive effort.  Especially tasty were the Ahi tuna (although be warned the portion is not big) and the Merkts Cheddar Bacon burger (big slice of deliciously crisped bacon). I have to applaud them on offering Merkts cheese - just a nice little touch that more places should take heed of. They are also open on Sundays which is big"
"Great food an Service. We went a little early to beat the crowd, and ordered quickly. The food came within 5 minutes and looked amazing. I ordered the Al Pastor burger and Cajun fries. Damn was it good. I loved it an will be definitely be going back soon. All my friends loved what they got."
"I had the BBQ Po'boy, cajun fries, truffle fries, and a spicy pork beef taco. Everything was okay. By far the most attractive part of this place is that their patio (a collection of 6 tables with plastic chairs) is BYOB and in a prime location. Think about it...there aren't a ton of quick service food options with a BYOB patio. Perfect for an inexpensive dinner on a nice night."
My new favorite place for tacos! I'm glad I finally made it in. So many great choices. Excellent food & service!
"The people working when I've been there are totally rad and upbeat.  It didn't take long at all for our food to come and we easily found seating.  The burger was so juicy and delicious without being overly greasy.  The tacos are inventive and flavorful ! The pork belly poboy was just ok, but the sauce was good-just too much bread.  I enjoy going to this place and trying a new item each time."
Everything that was delivered was mighty tasty.... like more than 5 stars...best food I've had in WEEKS.....but they shouldn't have a guy on a bike delivering food when it's 4 degrees out there with a wind chill of -20.... food was lukewarm at best. Temperature of food was the ONLY issue
"They made me a special spicy pork and kimchi ramen that wasn't even on the menu and it was DELICIOUS! Nice people, and at least the ramen was delicious. My guy liked his cheeseburger and fries. I'm sure we'll be back!"
"4.5 stars. Party of 4 got here around 1145 on a Friday and were the only one's there. Our food came out quickly, and everything was really good. The prices were extremely reasonable for the quality and taste. The samurai and Japanese beef short rib taco were both delicious. The soft shell crab 'po boy was really good, but the roll it was on was too big (I thought at least). I took off the top half and that's when you could really taste all of the flavors. I'll definitely be coming back"
"I have had big and littles a few times and every time the food is delicious. The last time I ordered delivery my order was messed up due to the 3rd party service they use. When I called to ask what happens they completed refunded my order, sent out the right food shortly after and then provided us with a free meal the next time we ordered. When I called the management insisted I try a little bit of everything and through in a few more free samples to ensure I would return. They repeatedly thanked me for coming back after their error. They not only know how to make amazing food but they have unparalleled customer service which is very important to me."
"So I have seen this place in the past on Check Please, Guy F's show, etc.  Always hearing great things about it so it was on my list to go hit a couple of years.  I lived in LP but never managed to go to Orleans to hit this place. See another place over there called Bad Happy for poutine that I want to try as well.  Anyway.... they opened a place on Belmont about a 15 minute walk from my house.  Needless to say I thought Oh Snap now I can try it without any effort.  Hit the place on a late Saturday afternoon for a late lunch with a buddy.  Man it was rock solid, love the tacos, saw the burger and it looked darn good, the fries were tasty.  Want to try the burger and the Po' Boy after seeing those while there.  Staff is friendly and helpful about the food and the food is just outstanding nom nom stuff.   Hit the Asian pork tacos and the Hawaiian as well.   The Little taco with whitefish is darn good as well.  I will try the grilled shrimp next visit.  I prefer my fish and shrimp grilled to enjoy the best flavor although the fried one I got was very tasty and not overly breaded.  All the sauces are excellent as well... bit sweet some with heat some without...so be prepared for that a bit.It's BYOB by the way so that makes it a plus in my book."
This is a must go to place. The food is amazing! The fish and chips is ridiculous! I can't say enough positive things about them! Both Big and Little are great folks. The prices vs the size of the portions are unbelievable!
"BY FAR the best tacos I've ever had. Amazing. They are relatively inexpensive, so try a bunch of the tacos on their menu. I recommend the pork and fish ones."
"This place has really got it all.  The food is delicious, prices are so reasonable, and customer service is wonderful. Omar is a jolly and hilarious dude, and I appreciate the fact that he's on the floor making sure everyone is happy.  The best part? I live a block away, so I have easy access to all this yummy stuff. The first time I went I ordered out and got fish and chips. It was a greasy, hot, and delightful experience. They were busy but they were still fairly quick.The second time I came here with my parents and the experience was even better.  I got the soft shell crab po' boy, my dad got the shrimp bahn mi, and my mom got the grilled tilapia sandwich (see, there ARE some healthy options among the grease!) My mom and I split a salad (SO cheap, only $3.50!), and we all split some cajun fries.  The fries were came a little later than everything else, but Omar came around and  brought them to us himself.  Then he cracked a joke, made my parents laugh, and all was well in the world.  Everything was great, and we finished it all.  The only thing is it would be difficult to take my vegetarian friends here, as there are not a whole lot of options for them. However, I will most certainly be back, with or without them!"
"When this place first opened up, I was skeptical because I had heard it was a seafood place, and I'm not a fan of seafood. Also, they replaced Indie Burger in this location, and I liked that place. I was easily won over on my first visit, and found plenty to eat that wasn't fished out of salt water.The staff here are extremely friendly, even when the place is packed and the pace behind the counter is frantic. The dining area does get full in the evenings, especially weekends, but in the summer, there's nice outdoor seating as well.The tacos are absolutely packed with flavor, but they're really tiny. Order a few of them if you're trying to get full. Burgers and fries are excellent too, and the burgers are plenty big and well-dressed.BIG & little's is a more than worthy replacement for Indie Burger, but I really miss the former's milkshakes. If this place starts serving milkshakes, they'll be perfect."
Just as good as the original location. Fried egg cheeseburger is the best and you must try the shrimp tacos. Everything on the menu is great!
"Absolutely love the food. The service was great as well. The cashier looked like he had a lot going on with food orders and transmitting the orders to the cooks, but still managed to greet us so friendly! The location is extremely convenient and the place itself is cute. Def going back!"
"I absolutely loved this place. First of all, the nicest people work here. NICEST PEOPLE EVER. When we went there, we could not believe how kind the workers were and they're not even working for tips since you just order at the counter. On top of that, every menu item is exceptional. There was nothing we ate that was average. Everything was rich in flavor and completely different than the next menu item. The space inside isn't too small but they're sooo busy(rightfully so) that its not always easy to grab a seat. I would avoid lunch hour though because you may have to wait a bit."
Tasty tacos and extremely convenient if you live in the neighborhood. Some of their more non-conventional tacos are their best. Big is an awesome dude. Their tacos can be pricey but definitely worthy to check out from time to time.
"Stumbled across this place yesterday with a serious hunger rumbling in my stomach.  5 tacos later I was a complete fanboy.  Brandon at the counter suggested we start with the ""Holy Trinity"" their Samurai, Spicy Pork, and Ahi Poke.  The Samurai was a slightly different take on a baja style fish taco with lightly fried whitefish and awesome sauce to tie it all together.  Next up the pork was so tender but with crisp edges.  Tuna, amazing quality and its texture goes perfectly with the crispy taco they serve it it(and the secret sauce is bomb).I went back for the Hawaiian pork and the Japanese short rib. Both had the same amazing tenderness with crispy edges that reminded me of a perfect hashbrown.  killer stuff, keep up the great work."
Food is good - have been to the original location on Orleans.  But the best part about the Belmont place is Omar at the counter.  So welcoming and pleasant - Omar rocks BIG & little's!!
"Living nearby, I've been here a half dozen times since it opened. Sometimes its crowded, other times its not been so bad. I don't blame the restaurant for the crowds or the layout of the location. Finding good real estate in the restaurant business is a difficult thing. I'm happy to have them in the neighborhood and am willing to make the tradeoff of dealing with a busy, crowded place that actually sticks around in that location and serves good food.Some menu items are stellar. Spicy Pork Banh Mi Burrito--Incredible.  Shrimp and Chips--Incredible.Other items left me not so satisfied. Soft shell crab po-boy seemed a little dry to me. Lots of bread. Perhaps just not my thing.  Sometimes the fries are a bit soggy...other times they've been nice and crispy.Overall many good experiences at this location. Looking forward to more."
"Awesome tacos, any seafood choice is good. One of our guests had the portobello burger and it was great! Loved the atmosphere & the staff is great. So glad we found a place that has an Ahi Tuna taco that was meaty and good! Sesame sprinkled on them, like a sushi mouthful of heavenly goodness"
"It's good in concept, not so great in execution. Both times I've had pork belly it has been overcooked and tasted funny."
"My BFF has been raving about Big & Little's for months, and despite it's close proximity to my apartment, I kept forgetting I needed to try it out! We finally went for dinner this weekend and it was such a great experience! First of all, the cashier, Huge, was a pure delight. He made us all giggle and feel welcome and excited to order some delish tacos. I had the mahi, shrimp, and the japanese beef tacos. All were excellent - the mahi was the best. The sauces were all so good, not too spicy. My only complaint was that the truffle fries were a little too cripsy/greasy, but overall they were truffly goodness. Also, it's BYOB so that's always an added plus. Can't wait to go back!!"
"I live right down the street so I was really excited to see a new spot open up that had some hype. Even with huge expectations, Big & Little's has been a fantastic addition to our neighborhood.We have enjoyed every taco that we've had with our go to's of: al pastor, spicy pork, samurai, and mahi. You can't go wrong with the po boys either especially the pork belly which is crispy and tender goodness.The line can be long so it can take awhile to get food but Omar and the gang pull through every time to make you feel taken care of. It's BYOB as well and it makes for a great place to take friends for a casual meal packed with serious flavor!"
"My husband and I eat here at least twice a month, and have never had a bad meall! Shrimp Thai tacos are amazing as well as fried shrimp tacos, Maui tacos, all the tacos!Po boys are great too. Everything is always fresh and delicious, made to order. Big is always around and makes you feel like family...welcoming, funny, and friendly! It is the kind of place you can always be in the mood for...can't say enough good about this restaurant!"
"BYOB and amazing tacos and burgers? Do I really need to say anything else in my review? The samurai tacos are amazing, but there is a huge downside... they are cash only. I guess it helps keep the prices down but come on how are you still cash only in 2015?"
"overrated.  There really isn't anything special about the food here (except poke crab taco) and I leave hungry every time.  The taco shells are dry and there is always too much sauce on the tacos.  The truffle fries are ok, but I'd recommend asking to be extra crispy.  Plenty of other hamburgers in the area that are worth trying before theirs."
"First of all... One word: OMAR!!!  I stumbled onto this place when it 1st opened on Belmont (my neighborhood).. Omar is one of the most Welcoming employees I've ever met at any establishment, others should Model after him... He is one of the reason I'm a Repeat Customer and the food is delish: my recommendation is big & little burger w/truffle fries but last time I was there they had kimchi fries-which was Delish!!  They have a wide variety on their menu!!  Most of the time do get B&L delivered but can't wait to visit again soon to see Omar & make my tummy happy!!!"
"This place is a great addition my favorites list.  I have eaten at the Belmont location multiple times and they have never let me down.  During a recent visit, I tried to redeem a Groupon.  Given how busy the place was that evening, the Groupon was redeemed but somehow the value was not deducted from my bill.  I actually didn't notice it until after I left the restaurant.  I went back a couple of days later during lunch and mentioned this mishap to ""Big"".  He was very apologetic and gracious.  The thing that impressed me even more and was totally unexpected, came after I ordered a bunch of food and drinks (there were 3 in my party during this trip).  Big insisted on ""comp-ing"" the whole tab.  i pushed back and said I wasn't looking for a free meal and would pay the amount less the Groupon portion but he was very insistent.  All I can say is WOW, great food, great staff and outstanding management/leadership."
It was an alright experience.  The staff was very nice and the place was chill.  I really enjoyed the truffle fries as well.  I got the egg burger and it was alright.  I did ask for no tomatoes and onions and they did put it on.  My wife asked for no mayo on her burger and that was put on as well.  Was busy so wasn't really worth it to get it changed.
"Finally got to try this place & it is great. We tried the fish taco and the Hawaiian burger ...both were solid.  ""Big"" was presiding when we visited and he is extremely friendly...by the end of the night we were exchanging Hawaiian burger recipes with him. Already plotting to come back to try more of the menu"
"Everything is exceptional; Everything. The food was only topped by the service. The host Omar is friendly, inviting, and more than willing to take his time describing anything and answering any questions. My favorite is the Tuna Poke Taco. Just amazingly fresh, high quality sashimi grade tuna in a crispy shell.. 3-4 of these is all you need.My friends each had po' boys: one the pork belly and the other the soft shell crab. Both looked great and were confirmed to be as good as they looked.All the fish taco's are excellent, and there's something for everyone.. You definitely must check this place out!"
"Fast and delicious. Crispy fried fresh. And the variety of unique items to die for. I had the softshell poboy...that sandwich may be the messiest thing I've ever eaten, but I'll be doing it again and again."
We come here on the regular and it has never disappointed! The food is great and the people who work here are even better. Even with the long lines everyone always has a smile on their face and super friendly. We always try to bring our family and friends here for lunch when they are visiting. Definitely a favorite!!
"I've been to this place many of times and it's never a disappointment. Great food and great customer service everytime I've been here. Sometimes it takes a little bit to get your food, but it's definitely worth the wait because it's always packed. The food is always consistent which is a plus! Kudos to the joint! I will come back!!"
"Found this place on Yelp today in search of a casual lunch spot for a friend and I. Then I remembered seeing this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, so I was in. Was surprised to see how small it was, but was glad to see there was ample street parking around 1pm on a Thursday. Upon walking in, the counter guy was extremely welcoming and insisted we come up to the counter to he could explain the popular items on the menu. Great personality and the perfect face for this spot - made us feel really welcome, sorry I didn't get his name. We both selected something he suggested - the Hawaiian Burger and the Pork Belly Po Boy. Both were out of this world delicious and just the right portion. Be sure to order fries separtely, as they don't come with - and as cheap as this place is, you ain't mad about it either. We went with the truffle fries which were great, if you're a little more adventurous, go with the kimchi fries. Lunch for 2 under $20, food came quickly and the place was great. Will be back very soon! Highly recommended."
DELISH.There really is nothing more to say.
"In Order of ImportanceFinal Word: Do it.The Deets:* Food: Simple, but nuanced. Ridiculously well executed tacos.  Twoin five of their tacos are above average.  The other three are spectacular.* Service: Friendly and nice.  We had a miscommunication once and accidentally got Ahi instead of Mahi tacos and they brought out replacement tacos even though we were fine with our mistake.* Atmosphere: There's a nice outdoor side patio.  It might be BYO.  A little fast foody feel with their interior finishes, but they don't need to roll out the red carpet for this concept.* When: Three times.  All for lunch."
Great little place. Love the friendly vibe. This isn't your typical fast food place. These people make delicious food! We loved the fried mahi mahi fish and the soft shell crab po boy. Tacos are fresh and delicious too.
"Currently sitting here enjoying an awesome Hawaiian Pork taco & some excellent Cajun fries, they have the World Cup on the flat screen, & Sinatra blaring through the speakers, I might have to move in here.Great tacos, even better fries. First time here, can't wait to come back!"
"I have been stalking this location since I knew Big and little's was moving here. I went in on the second day it was open and was surprised how packed it was (especially at a kind of off time--3:00). Their reputation probably had more than just me stalking this new location.Already, it's pretty obvious that enough seating is going to be an issue. I think in time (it's only been two days) they might figure a better way to get people through the line. It might be that this location turns into more of a takeout place for a lot of people due to the seating issues and how getting through the line works.The positive energy flowing through this place is just as it is in the River North location. It's what keeps people coming back and will definitely have my roommates and I coming back in many times. The food tastes just as good as the River North location, but the portions and prices are less. There are a couple of items, like the tacos and burgers, which are pretty much the same size but for less money, which is awesome.My boyfriend went to get his favorite, the soft shell crab po'boy and saw that the price was nearly half. In River North, this costs you $13, in Lakeview $7.95. However, this was a sandwich that was definitely cut in half. So, you get half of what is served in River North for not quite half the price. We sort of wish the size would have stayed the same because it was definitely a favorite. He was able to get a side of fries (also much smaller than that River North location, about half the fries) that had his total meal coming to what he would have paid just for the sandwich in River North. So, it ends up pretty equal in that respect.Also, this location is not cash only! Loving it! I think this will be regular place for me for a quick snack to tide me over while I'm out running errands or shopping around. The seafood tacos here are the most flavor you will get for your buck anywhere."
"I was excited to try this new neighborhood spot and decided to go for dinner last night. It was hard to choose what tacos to get because so many sounded awesome. I went with a grilled shrimp taco, a carnitas taco, and cheese fries. And what kind of cheese do they have? Merkts. Super bonus points. There are two kinds of people in this world: people who know Merkts is the sh*t, and people who I don't want to associate with. The food was delicious and I can't wait to try lots of other items on the menu.A big part of this 5 star rating also goes to the service we received. It's always disappointing (and sometimes infuriating) to see how little customer service means at some places. The gentleman at the register was beyond friendly and made sure we knew that our business meant a lot to them. He had something positive to say about everything we ordered which was cute. The guy who handed me our food was also very friendly and courteous. We waited in line to order a bit long (and I imagine the weekend would be quite a long wait) but I don't really care because the food and friendliness was worth it. So glad Big & Littles has joined the neighborhood, I'll definitely be back!"
"Maybe the best restaurant in Chicago. It's that good. Everything on the menu is spectacular and inexpensive. I could eat here every day and not get tired of all of the assortment and deliciousness that Big & little's has to offer!If you go to Chicago, eat here, if it's the one thing you do!"
"I came here with high expectations however, they were only partially met. As a vegetarian, the menu is extremely limited: it's mostly fish and meat. So I ordered the portobello sandwich with truffle fries and it was about $7. They were both solid but nothing special. The sauce was the only thing that stood out.I would go again happily but it's not my first choice."
"B&Ls is pretty much a required stop when I'm in the city. I'm a huge fan of the Pork Belly Po Boy (I mean, fried pork belly? Maple Mayo? Fabulous bread roll? Come on). The foie gras and fries are fantastic, and I've been known to eat them while driving 70mph down the Eisenhower Expressway. Deep fried grilled cheese? Yes fucking please.Altogether an amazing place. A must-visit."
"The pork belly po boy sandwich was crazy good! I was picking at the fried pork belly bits since it was falling out all over the place. Honestly, I wouldn't mind ordering a bucket of just the fried pork belly without adding the unnecessary carbs from the sandwich buns. Gotta stay health conscious..."
"First visit, just stop by for a quick burger and fries.  I got the Al pastor burger, which had fried pork belly mixed with the ground beef, pineapple, fried jalapeños and some special sauce.  It was awesome!  I also tried the truffle fries, not do good.  Soggy and the truffle oil tasted stale.  I want to go back, as I want to try the soft shell crab poor boy."
"They have delicious everything.  Loved the burgers, the burritos & looking forward to next time."
"I really like this place. The staff is very nice and helpful. Food is made quick. Restaurant is bright and cheery, with great decor. Food is exactly what I wanted- I had the fried tilapia taco and the Mexican short rib taco- both very tasty and delicious. Truffle fries are awesome and full of flavor. I want to go back again and try more items off of the menu before I give them 5 stars.**I updated my rating to 5 stars today 10/3/14. The food is amazing. The service is awesome. Today I had a grilled shrimp taco, spicy short rib taco, & mango chutney pork taco, with truffle fries. Try the malt vinegar and hot sauce with the truffle fries, it's very tasty. I can't think of even 1 complaint. LOVE THIS PLACE!!"
"Delicious food and great service. I loved the vibe they had going on on there. Everything I ate was a much have, I can't narrow it down to one thing. Soft shell crab is as tasty as the ones in Maryland. I will definitely be back and tell everyone I know to go too. It doesn't hurt that it's reasonably priced as well! Such a bonus!!!"
"We had wanted to visit Big & Little's since seeing it featured on DDD, where we were taken in by all the mouth-watering goodies featured, including the (gigantic) fish and chips.  The order of fish and chips we received, however, did not quite live up to what we expected, but was good nonetheless.  It came as several smaller chunks of fish, instead of the one big piece of fried deliciousness that we expected.  We also ordered several tacos, all of which were great, even though we couldn't really tell apart which ones we were eating.  It sort of felt like they could have given us any tacos, and I would not know if they were the right ones I ordered or not.  The food was all delicious though, and I will definitely be back."
"Absolutely delicious! This place is one of the best food spots in the city. We tried the pork belly tacos, shrimp tacos, fish poboy, burger and blue crab tacos. The blue crab tacos were OUT OF CONTROL. I highly recommend. Also, the pork belly tacos and fish poboy was delicious too. We'll definitely be back and I love that there are two locations to choose from!Omar is great! He was super helpful, friendly, and overall the best!"
"They have some creative burgers and tacos on the menu. Nothing's really spectacular, but points to creativity. I enjoyed eating a burger al pastor with fried pork belly and spicy Thai taco."
"Soft shell crab po boy! That's all I have to say about this place. Delicious. Cash only! Don't forget, and the seating could use some updating but I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area."
"Great variety of food. Had issues over the last couple months with food taking upwards of 30 minutes when busy and 15-25 minutes when slow. It seems strange as it is kind of a grab and go type place. I have also been ignored as someone who isnt ""in"" with staff or management. However, I started going there because it was good food and people. I brought up my complaints to staff and over stepped using some foul language I typically never use. To my surprise, the manager (Huge A.K.A. Omar) came over and confronted me. I could tell he was upset but he kept cool and was compassionate and tried to understand what happened. He comped my meal without me asking snd gave me a gift card and told me to come back. Regardless of my poor experience these last 4 times or so, Omar made it his duty to resolve the situation and was incredibly professional. He has redeemed himself and so has his staff. We'll see what happens next time but I should note that their food is great and there are decent people managing the place which there has to be something said for. It could have been terrible timing on my part, but I think if there is an issue, just be polite and mention it and they will make it right."
"Ever had love at first bite? NO? Then you haven't ate here! We've tried:The mahi taco (grilled)The al pastor tacoThe hawaiian taco (my personal favorite, without chipotle peppers) The japanese beef short rib tacoThe zeus burgerThe shrimp po' boycajun friesregular friesWe've been here 5 times so far...and we take everyone here! It is a great atmosphere, friendly and I get all warm inside just thinking about going here!Might make it a Tuesday night tradition...Who's with me??DONT MISS OUT--SO GOOD. Oh yeah, its BYOB, too!"
"Pure awesomeness, the people here are so chill and relaxed and treat you like a friend. Food is also awesome, cant say anything bad about this place."
"This place is amazing! Good food, good prices, BYOB. What more can you ask for. I could eat here every day. Love the ahi tuna tacos and the truffle fries, but burgers are great too and all the tacos are good!"
"Came here after seeing there was an abundance of 5 star reviews for a 'Hot New Business on Yelp.' The guy and service was really friendly. The atmosphere was really cool because they play old school hip-hop, reminds me of 'Empire Liqours' in Wicker Park before it closed. On to the food.Food - Ordered the Japanese taco, Al Pastor taco, Shrimp (grilled, not fried) taco Truffle Fries w/egg (It's actually called a Phil's [if it comes with an egg] which confused the hell outta me but they gave me an egg free of charge so I'm happy) and a Po Boy Banh Mi. All were good. No complaints, but if I were to compare it to other competing places, I think they come second. Al Pastor taco comes second to Big Star's Al Pastor. Shrimp taco loses to Del Seoul Asian taco. Those are the only 2 I can compare. The fries were ok. Can't taste the truffle seasoning but I love eggs so I guess that makes up for it. Po Boy sandwich was ok too.Service/Atmosphere/Etc - Service was amazing and it's a nice clean place. Love the old school hip hop they play too so don't change that.Overall - 4 Stars for the food they serve as they are all good. 5 star for service and atmosphere.  I think all the food was good although the portions are small. I THINK it's BYOB too. Heard their original location is better so I'll def have to check it out."
"Had to try the fried crab sandwich.  All I can say is ""wow""!  I can't believe I ate that.  I was really nervous.  I never thought you could eat that entire crab.  But I did it!  Must say it was good and different.  The mayo/chili sauce they put on the sandwich, makes it.  At first you can't really taste the crab.  All you can taste is the fried batter but as you get towards the middle of the crab, you can finally taste it.  I'm glad I tried it but it freaked me out afterwards and I don't think I would do it again.  My mind won!!  But give it a shot, it's worth talking about it when it's over!"
"Being from Southern California, I sure do miss the plethora of fish tacos we have back home- Rubio's, Wahoo's, etc. I haven't been to the original Big & little's location & was stoked to see this new one in Lakeview open. I certainly enjoy Big Star, but was blown away by Big & little's variety/quality/prices of tacos & other menu options. On top of that, homeboy at the front register is so sweet & friendly. They were also playing some Common & other classic hip hop (my kind of jams). I will be coming back frequently & hope to try everything on their menu.Here's what I tried so far. I would recommend all of them lol-Raw ahi tuna taco: great contrast in textures, just like ordering a poke/fried wonton appetizer at a sushi place-Mahi taco: had the grilled version & this was prob my #1 fav-Big & little's taco: tasty traditional fish taco-Spicy thai taco: great flavors, but a little too much sauce-Hawaiian pork taco: sweet take on your typical al pastor taco-Fries: similar to five guy's, will def try the phil's style next time"
Great place!  I frequent the locations on Orleans and Belmont.  Service is really good especially on Belmont where Omar works.
"This is my favorite place in Chicago. I'm a huge foodie and I've eaten all over the city. This place takes the number one spot. Omar is the best always on top of his game. Never forgets a face. The whole menu is delicious, but the tacos, simple but full of flavor. Love living a block from here!"
"No doubt about it this location just doesn't have it yet. My experience here last week was plain awful. They only redeeming quality of my visit was the friendly guy taking orders.First off, it is incredibly awkward inside. There are WAY too many tables and no where to really stand while you wait to order and pickup. The soda fountain is also strangely to the left of where you order and it just plain doesn't work. It should be by the pickup window/bathrooms in back...Also, the register is just sort of there. I had no idea what I was doing and the friendly and obviously flustered guy taking orders had to come over and basically tell every person coming in where to order. THEY NEED TO FIX THIS. GET A SIGN OR SOMETHING.I don't know who designed this place but they seriously need to go back to school. The whole flow is terrible compared to the original Orleans location.Next I had the pleasure of waiting nearly thirty minutes for a burger and regular order of fries. I get you are busy but thirty minutes! Triple the amount of time the guy I ordered from quoted me. Come on. I was standing right by the pickup window and could see the action going on the grill. There was basically two-three items on it the entire time. TWO-THREE! I didn't order anything complicated or anything, they could have easily thrown my burger on in the corner and let it cook. I get filling orders as they come in, in order, but maybe a little multitasking and expediting of order flow needs to happen instead of the grill guys fretting over how many fries to put in take out bags. The guys working seriously had an argument for a few minutes about it in front of me while nothing was on the grill...I get my burger and leave. Get home. They messed it up... Surprise surprise... There was no merks cheese on it, that I paid an extra dollar for..., an excessive amount of ketchup, and the burger patty had been mutilated while cooking so it fell apart into this basically sloppy joe mess.All around really disappointed. I was so pumped for a B&L's in Lakeview but it looks like I will have to stick to the original location."
"Crazy delicious, perfectly casual. Great variety of food options, especially for seafood tacos. Fantastic value for the price. Both times I've been there's a line, so be prepared to wait a bit, but it's well worth it! I especially recommend the Kimchi Fries. Also, BYOB if you want."
"I drive by this place all the time.  A friend mentioned it to us so my wife and went for me tacos.  WOW,  Amazing, We enjoyed so much.  Cheap and quality food.  Love it"
Most favorite place in the city of Chicago.  Friendly staff and fast service. The food there is to die for and every time I bring a friend they are always asking to go again. Only wish it was closer to me down belmont because then I would go there everyday.
"Lived pretty close to this place for a year before trying it. Now I hate myself for waiting that long. Everyone who works here is beyond nice, food is amazing and portions are pretty big for the low prices. My wife and I go to this place probably once ever other week or so and it continues to amaze us. SO AWESOME!"
Ate here for the first time on my birthday. I never had a burger with gyros meat...it was freaking awesome! We both ordered the Zeus burger and Truffle fries...Fabulous!!! I highly recommend it! Great service! The guy even came from behind the counter to ask about how we liked our food. Will definitely return here again!
Delicious little tacos that I wish were bigger!flavors and texture are great. Service is fun. Definitely coming back !
"Unbeatable. Unreal quality and taste to cost ratio. Takes about 20 minutes after placing order :) highly recommend: al pastor, ahi, and cucumber tacos."
I do not recommend ordering delivery from B&L (through GrubHub). We submitted our order at 7:15 and it got delivered at 9:25. Food quality was good but not worth the wait.
"Heard good things about this place and knew that it had been on the Food Network, so I guess my expectations were pretty high. I ordered the fish and chips and they were okay. They were nothing special, nothing Food Network worthy. Guess I'll need to keep exploring the menu because all this hype has to be about something!"
"Really glad BIG & little's has joined our neighborhood! Omar is a great manager and seems to enjoy getting to know the customers. It's a fast/casual type place and the tacos are street style, so they're small - I order at least 2 and my husband orders anywhere from 3-5. I haven't tried any of the sandwiches yet, but the price points seem good. The fries are pretty good - I wish they had chips/salsa/guac since they have so many tacos. My husband has tried a po'boy and a burger and liked both - it's nice that they have a large enough menu to switch things up.  If they aren't going to have real dishes/cups, I wish they would switch to paper cups instead of styrofoam."
If you haven't been to Big & Little's you need to go. This place has the best tacos in the city! The food is inexpensive and the staff is super friendly. Sometimes the wait can be a little long but the tacos are definitely worth it!
"Amazing food, cool vibe, and the owners (big and little) are cool as hell!  What else could you ask for?  Easy 5 stars.It always seems to be crowded.  I think this place could do really well on Clark street close to wrigley also."
Omar is the man and the food is terrific! If you don't know Omar or any of the tacos you should go soon! The Japanese short rib taco is unreal and so is the el pastor and even the samurai. The truffle fries are great and if you go Phil's way you won't be disappointed.I will definitely be going back for years to come. Thank you for the great meals and awesome hospitality. Cheers
these are great little tacos. been to the one in River North.  Had many different tacos and never been disappointed.
"I've heard about this place from my buddies and thought to give this place a try. I had a large order (about $100+ worth of tacos and Poy Boys) from GrubHub, I gotta say that they make their food fast! I got a GrubHub notification that the order was ready in 15 min. It was a rainy day and I tried to get to the place as fast as I can however due to traffic I ended up coming there 20 min later. Funny thing when I arrived, one of the manager (big guy with hat and glasses -- Omar?) yelled at me for being late and the quality of the food deteriorate because I picked it up 20 min late. Is this a new thing for restaurants now? To yell at their customers for picking up the food late?Soo just a warning for you guys, if you order for pickup and come late! Omar will getcha! Wanted to give this place a 3, but because the food is really good and speediness of the staff getting your order out..."
Amazing. My new go to spot. If you close your eyes and put your finger down on the menu - 100% of the time you will land on something great! Great food. Great service. BYOBWhat more could you ask for?
"This review isn't really about the food at BIG and little's, which by the way amazing. I've literally tried everything at least once on the menu and I've loved all of it. In particular, they have had some kimchi fries that are the fries that I've enjoyed most in my life, and I'm a connoisseur when it comes to that. The short of it, the food is absolutely delicious.However, it's the service and customer relationship that this place has which makes it my favorite place to eat in the entire city. Anyone who has eaten here during a busy time knows that BIG and little's gets avalanched by customers because of how great the food is. There have been a couple of times where I ate here with family and our order got messed up somehow. When I brought it to the attention of the staff, the big, friendly dude Omar was absolutely beside himself and completely refused to let us pay for our meal. He literally would not even let us throw in a tip. He was more concerned that we enjoyed our meal and got exactly what we had ordered, rather than take our money.Even if the food wasn't as wonderful as it is here, Big and little's would be my top choice for quick eating in the city just because of how they treat their patrons. Thankfully, it's also the place that I enjoy most, and the prices are so good that I can more than get my fill for a ridiculously small price.You don't feel like just a customer in this place, and that's the best thing I can say about any service establishment."
"BnLs has great food! I am never disappointed when I come in here. I love LovE LOVE the Mexican Short Rib Tacos and the TRUFFLE FRIES. Omar is the best guy in the world, too! He's super sweet and always takes care of his customers."
This place is always amazing; Super fast Delivery and food is spectacular !!!
"The food is good! I had the soft shell crab po boy and the bah mi burrito. The burrito deserved an encore. Staff is really friendly too. Byob also, which I really love. And will not break the bank."
"There's a reason BIG & little's has such a strong reputation - it's because the food and customer service is awesome. I haven't been to the original downtown, but was really excited they opened another location in Lakeview. Definitely dangerous.We had the spicy pork, maui, big and little, and spicy short rib taco...each one was really good, but the big and little and spicy short rib stood out. The sweet chile special sauce made each taco. We ordered a shrimp po boy and they gave us a shrimp bahn mi by mistake, so quickly (2 minutes later) gave us the shrimp po boy and then also gave us the shrimp bahn mi for free..this was appreciated for sure...we also got the truffle fries..just get themOne last note about the customer service...Omar is the man...the guy is incredibly passionate about the restaurant and making sure the customer is satisfied..they were expectedly behind (only open 2 weeks), and he made it clear right from the start that they were backed up, but he appreciated our business and it was clear and genuine. I'll be back for the food, but I'd also go back just to talk to this guy.Overall, it's an awesome addition to the neighborhood and I'm sure they'll do just fine.Helps to be BYO also.."
"The truffle fries - as other reviewers have noted - were delicious. Highly recommend them. The fish tacos were pretty delish as well. This is not a Michelin starred restaurant, but for a cafe place like this? Five big ones."
"Burgers and other food are great. However, if you order the Crab Po Boy be prepared to have an entire fried crab stuck between two pieces of dry bread. It does not come in the form of lump crab so I was very shocked when I received a legit crab in my bread."
"Came in here at St. Patty's and it was PACKED, but that didn't stop the chefs from making an amazing burger. It was extremely juicy & flavorful and dripped down my neck and arms, there was no way to prevent that, and thats why theres paper towels at every table. It was an amazing burger! SERIOUSLY, well done. It's a very loud place and orders are said through an intercom so don't expect for a quiet meal here, but maybe it's different on a regular day but I didn't mind either way, i was lucky enough to get a booth to eat with my guests. They should seriously expand this place, because after I got seated the line stretched all the way to outside and there was no more seating left for anyone else. The regular and cajun fries were sup bar because I personally found them to be too crispy, but my guests enjoyed them. The food was at a good price, no complaints there. I'll definitely come in here again to try the more advertised risqué food like the crab sandwich."
"the soft shell crab is to die for! This food was just heaven sent. The fries are delicious, and melt in your mouth."
"I don't understand the almost 5 five rating for this place. The food is just mediocre. The average age here is early 20s, professional and live in the area. When this is all you know you do not know what is good food. The only good thing about this place is the owner. He has a great personality and I hate to give a bad review. The cheeseburger was so small I almost asked for my money back. Very disappointed."
"Love this place! Quick, casual restaurant with unusual and high quality food. Had the pork belly po' boy. It was delicious!  Husband enjoyed a variety of fish tacos, especially one with  a'hi tuna. They also had less adventurous food like burgers and hot dogs."
"Lots of personality kinda feels like the place you want to bring your little league team to after a game. The ambiance is casual, and the staff is very attentive. They're menu comprises of burgers, tacos and other handhelds. There is one large TV but not the place you'd like to sit and watch a game. It is self -seating and first come first serve, and they do have outside seating. Being a vegetarian I had the mushroom burger and veggie taco and both were very tasty. The Mushroom burger was grilled although I was offered to have it fried, but the cashier told me that it tasted better grilled and I agree. This is a BYOB establishment so feel free to bring your own booze and enjoy it in this laid back joint."
I live minutes away and every time I visit Big and Littles I am never disappointed. The people are helpful and vivacious. Everything on the menu is spectacular. Spicy pork bahn mi burrito is awesome! A must have are the truffle fries!
This is a destination spot. The type of place you travel to for the fried fish tacos.
"4 words: Soft Shell Crab Poboy!!! WOW I was thoroughly impressed with Big & Little's.  We ordered truffle fries on the side, they seemed to be yesterdays re-fried fries, but the poboys were all I cared about lol.  Parking lot is small, can't remember if there was street parking? We got there right when they opened, the line began to build fast.  It is an order at the counter and seat your self establishment.  Be patient while in line and waiting for your order, its worth it. Would recommend to all!!"
"all i can say: yes forever, and ever, and ever.this place is my favorite. i heard about it on DDD (lame, i know) and i made it my mission to come here! i really like this location versus their original for some reason. i think the original has a bad location for the most part and never seems packed. in short: it feels very empty.either way, i love this place and how awesome they are. staff are super friendly and give great suggestions. they also have groupons available and aren't jerks when you present it (yay for that)! their fodo is amazing and they make pretty decent tacos."
"There is nothing but superlatives that I have for Big and LittLes. It is close to a perfect spot- delicious and innovative food, cheap prices, INCREDIBLE FRIENDLY STAFF, and of course,  BYOB.  My wife and I come here at least once a week."
"Awesome tacos. Had the Big and Little, the crab poboy, and the shrimp taco. All amazing!"
"I was really excited to go here.  Been meaning to go for awhile.  Finally did and I got a pork belly poboy. Pork Belly tasted good but it left this really fatty feeling afterwards.  I've had porkbelly before but this poboy seemed ""po"".  Maybe needed more sauce or more meat or a crispier pork belly less fatty taste to it..  I felt like I was eating just bread and a few hints of porkbelly.  The staff was great and the ambiance is very relaxing."
My new favorite place! Tacos are perfect and I loved the flavors. So many options. The prices are reasonable and I cannot wait to come back.
"I love Big & Little's, and especially this location! It's a lot more lively than the Orleans location, but every bit as delicious. This is exactly what ""fast food"" should be like. The menu is the right kind of eclectic. I haven't had any misses here, but my favorite order is 3 tacos. Especially the Japanese short rib!I've never been to either location when the owners (Big and/or Little) were not taking orders or floating around the establishment. That's always a good sign. Even when the line is long, somehow there are always enough tables for everyone. Service is friendly and accommodating.Grab a tall boy and enjoy the BYOB. This place definitely fills a void in this stretch of Lakeview. No wonder it's so popular."
"Big & Little's was on my list of places to go to before I moved to Milwaukee, but I never made it. Then alas they opened one right across from my friend's apartment on Belmont. I'm visiting her this weekend so we just went (we left literally five minutes ago) and it was amazing.I ordered the shrimp po'boy (which is odd because I don't like seafood) and it was so delicious. We shared Phil's fries which were seasoned very well and the egg on top was a great touch. My friend goes a lot and has loved everything she has had. This time she had carnitas and bahn mi tacos and loved both of them.Omar, the manager, is exactly who you want representing your restaurant. He remembers everyone's names and personally delivers food to tables. He seems to genuinely care about his customers. My experience was fantastic and I will definitely be back!"
"Big and Little's a pretty good little neighborhood joint. I was really excited to see they opened this location in Lakeview, since it's right by my apartment. The service is amazing and the guys behind the counter are phenomenal, but the food itself tends to be a lot greasier than I would like, usually with very small amounts of fish. But it's still always tasty, and they have a nice little outdoor seating area, so I keep coming back. I usually stick with the fish tacos, and they're all equally good...the samurai sticks out because if its sauce, but the grilled mahi and grilled shrimp tacos are also pretty yummy. I wasn't wild about the Thai fish taco because of the sauce they put on it.  The truffle fries are also pretty good.  All in all, if you live in the area, I definitely recommend trying Big and Littles...they're great people and it's a local business worth supporting, but honestly, there's better tacos in this town."
"Girlfriend and I got a burger and the pork belly sandwich.  Brutally dry on both counts.    Inedible, regardless of how affordable this place is."
"My favorite restaurant in the whole city. So fresh and so fast - amazing quality meats and seafoods. Everything made to order. Tacos, burritos, burgers, fish and chips, sandwiches, fries... You must try the TRUFFLE FRIES!!! I come back a time or 2 per week for the great food, but I applaud the amazing customer service. The entire team works their butts off!!"
"This place is seriously promising! The food is fresh, the recipes creative (pork belly tacos...my god), and the staff is VERY friendly (especially Omar!). I'd do five stars, but their wait times were a little high when I went in, and for $3 apiece they could put more meat on the tacos. That said...the ingredients are VERY high quality. and they're pretty generous with their burgers and po'boys. Looking forward to coming in more!UPDATE: Every kink has been ironed out. These guys are as close to perfect as they can get. I stop there at least once a week."
"I've only had take out twice, need to try this place in person but I'm beyond impressed in a tough taco market.  I say without hesitation these are the best tacos in the city. I prefer the fish tacos to anything else, especially the spicy thai which is an unreal 3 bites of good. Mahi tacos are all good. The pork tacos are good, not great, I'd actually prefer Big Star pork tacos to these. The fries, chili and truffle are both so so, they can skipped. Get some awesome fish tacos in 3-4 ways and have a great night."
"I had been to the original and was blown away.The new location offers lower prices, but much smaller portions. I went with the pork belly PoBoy and shrimp Bahn Mi Po Boy. The sandwiches are so much smaller and lack the robust flavor of the originals. This location does not offer the famous Foie Gras fries!!  I would rather spend the extra money and go back to the original."
"The new location doesn't come close to the original.  Very excited that they had opened a new location, went to get the Samurai Taco and Truffle Fries, tasted nothing like they do at their original location, portion sizes were weak and the truffle fries had no truffle oil on them.  Extremely disappointed unfortunately.  Will continue to go to the original location only."
"The truffle fries were unbelievably good, nice reasonably priced food - I definitely recommend them!"
"The first time I ate here, I ate twice.  I had a soft shell crab po boy & Japanese Short Rib Taco first then chased it with a Burger Al Pastor & Mexican Short rib taco.  On my 2nd visit, I ate The Honkey & a soft shell crab Po Boy.  I normally don't eat volume like this but damn- I just can't help myself when I'm here! ITS SO F*CKING GREAT!!"
"I love this place! Every taco I've tried is great! My boyfriend is picky about his tacos and he loves this place! The prices are very fair and the staff is always amazing to us! I love the fish taco and pork belly taco!! I would recommend this place to anyone, especially if you are visiting from out of town, a great staple to try!"
Soft shell crab sandwich is one of the best things I've ever had! And the guys who work there are hilarious. Absolutely loved it
"I have been to Big & Littles a number of times and although the samuria taco is terrific, my favorite dish hands down in the fish and chips (half order).  Under $10, it is a huge amount of food and it is the first time I can really say that fried cod is better than friend tilapia or anything else.  The fry is light and not too greasy.  The cod separates perfectly into these well cooked chunks - flaking off perfectly.  The fries are great and generous portions - definitely the best bang for your buck of anything on the menu.  I have had other tacos that I have liked but like I said - if you go, someone should get the fish and chips!"
"So good! One of my moms favorite spots so I had to try, and I was sooo impressed! I had the Hawaiian pork taco and the spicy beef short rib taco and this is officially my new favorite taco place... And that's a huge compliment! But i want to try all the other fun stuff on the menu too, so I will definitely be back!"
"I gave Big & Littles 3 stars because I just didn't experience the 5 stars that people are writing on here. The portions are small, the price is high, and the wait is long. I tried to appreciate it for my boyfriends sake, but I refuse to give anything higher than a 3 star."
All of the Tacos are delicious.  The Japanese beef short rib taco is my favorite.  The burgers are some of the best in Chicago.  Al Pastor burger (beef patty with pork belly on top) is top-notch.  Call ahead. They are always busy and it may take 10-15 min to prepare your food.
This place was absolutely awesome! Omar was by far the most friendly person we came across while in Chicago! He actually brought out extra tacos for my husband at no cost! My burger was awesome and my husbands tacos were exceptional! And the cost cannot be beat!
This place is the bomb! They are super fast friendly and play great music! Better than big star!!!
So freaking delicious. I had the Portobello Sandwich and Cajun Fries. Eat it - you'll be glad.
excellent. fish tacos $2.75. sushi grade raw tuna poke taco $4.95 high quality fresh food. cool relaxed atmosphere. you can buy like 5 excellent things and it's under $20one of my favorite places in chicago.
I prefer the original location but this is very convenient in Lakeview. I think the quality of their fish and chips has gone downhill a bit but they're still pretty tasty. The shrimp tacos are excellent. Expect a long line!
"Walked in and told the person at the cash register, Omar, that I had never eaten here before. He literally hook like 5 min to explain the whole menu. That was so nice him. I finally decided on one his suggestions and it was very good. I am going back for the raw tuna taco soon."
"I love this place! It can get kinda crazy at times, especially late on weekends. But the food is completely worth it. Their soft shell crab po boy is amazing and so are their tacos. I'm obsessed with the Big & Littles taco and the mexican beef short rib. Phil's fries are also a must."
"We decided to have a light lunch and stopped at Big and Little's. Our soft shell crab po'boys were light, delicious and fulfilling. As we look back, we wish we had gone Bigger at Big and Little's by ordering the truffle french fries. There's always next time and we definitely plan to return."
"yess!!the best tacos, burgers everything is so damn good!bravo!"
They definitely don't skimp. Tacos are full and super tasty. I wanna eat like 20 of these into sickness. That combined with insanely friendly service will keep me coming back!
"Clean dining room and bathrooms and wet friendly staff. Had the pork belly po' boy, ahi tuna taco, and samurai taco. Wish I could do it all over again."
"Best tacos ever! I would seriously eat here ever day if I could. I came here randomly with a co-worker and we couldn't believe how good everything was!We ordered: Tilapia, Mahi, Spicy Pork, Hawaiian Pork & the Mexican. They were all fresh and delicious. They are smaller in size, so I would suggest 3-4 at a time.Go here. It's awesome."
LOVE Big & Little's.  I have only eaten their tacos because I'm still trying to get through each kind.  My favorites are the Big & Little and the Al Pastor so far.  I can't wait to try Phil's Fries and I hear the burgers are great too.  Manager is Omar is the best.  He makes the experience at Big & Little's that much more special.  He makes it a point to remember your name.  Can't wait to go back.
"I love this place so much...it is my new Hot Doug's. I've tried a good portion of the menu and everything has been delicious. The truffle fries are amazing and the ahi taco and spicy Hawaiian are simple but full of flavor. The staff is always super friendly and the food is affordable, too. Love love love!"
"Burgers and Tacos are excellent.  The po'boys are what they are known for, but I would only call them good."
"If you're looking for authentic Mexican street tacos, L'Patron over in Logan Square is more the place for you. But if tacos that are just about as fresh and as creative as they come without being over the top obnoxious is what you're after, then BIG & little's is where you should be.  Every time I'm there I get the Ahi Tuna, even if I've already got 4-5 tacos on my order. It's hands down one of the best, no frills taste combinations that I've ever experienced. Even if you aren't a sushi lover, TRY THIS. It will blow your mind.  The rest of the menu is packed with favorites...the shrimp tacos (I get them fried), the gyro taco, the samurai, THE TRUFFLE FRIES! Holy *&$% the truffle fries...And I've heard the po'boys are quite delicious as well, though I can never settle on just one menu item when I'm there. It's a lakeview gem and though I'm lucky to live just down the street, I would drive across town on a regular basis for some of their tasty bites if it came down to it. Try and you will enjoy!!!"
"Went today (Thursday evening) arrived a few minutes after 7pm. There was a line inside from the door to the counter. No vacant tables. Kinda smokey from the grill. Ordered the soft shell crab po-boy. My friends ordered a chorizo burrito and a couple tacos. The line to order might have taken about 10-12 mins. Luckily, a table freed up right as we ordered. Otherwise, we might have made it an order to go. My order came out in a reasonable amount of time and their food took a little longer.  I'm not a complainer but my friend was a little irritated about the wait. The owner came over to our table and apologized and made up for the mistake. I guess he knew we didn't get our meals at the same time. I was really impressed. This guy wants you to have a good experience. We did! It's still a new restaurant and I think some of the crowd will level off once the new factor wears off.  The food was terrific. I'm a southerner and have spent a lot of time in New Orleans. My po-boy was great. The bread, sauce, mmm, so good.  A little bit on the small size but I'm American and need a reminder that it's quality over quantity. This place is quality food. The ambiance is fast food basic. If you walked by, you'd assume this was some average fast food joint.  The chorizo burrito was big. The fish tacos looked beautiful. My friends enjoyed them. By the time we left (8pm-ish) there was no line. And, the tables were almost all available."
Food was amazing. Had four different tacos and all of them were excellent.  Staff was extremely nice.  I have to say that the fish tacos were the best I've had outside California.  Cajun fries could use a little more seasoning otherwise I would give this place a total five.  Definitely try the samurai taco and the shirt rib tacos were amazing.  Friend said that burger was excellent.  Laid back atmosphere with plenty of available street parking at lunch time.  Definitely look forward to trying the original location.
My band played the Vic theater around the corner and just stumbled upon this gem.  Great stuff here.  I hate the mango chutney pork taco and the white fish taco.  Bomb.  The fried crab po boy was pretty great as well.  Staff is very friendly.  Homeboy hooked me up with a drink since we were waiting for so long.  Tite.
Delicious food and crazy friendly service. The problem is they are way too popular and have a tough time keeping things moving. But you can't really blame them for that. Nice work fellas!
"i took ecstasy on saturday and the happiest part of my weekend was still trying big & littles on sunday. the food's unreal and the staff's unreal. we're all lucky to welcome this establishment to our neighborhood. chicago needs more joints like this. i tried a lot of different things. ahi tuna taco and soft shell crab poboy sandwich were my favorite, but everything's excellent."
"So. Good. We tried six different tacos- carnitas, tilapia, Japanese short rib, bahn mi, mango chutney pork, and one more fish one that I can't remember the name of. Either way, they were all sooooo good. I was so impressed with it all. I thjnk my favorites were either the Japanese short rib or the bahn mi. I could have ate like ten more. Also got the truffle fries!! Any place with truffle fries is awesome in my book. As other reviews have mentioned, the service was very friendly. It was pretty busy but we only waited about 10 minutes, maybe less for our food. Pretty inexpensive as well for the great quality of the food. I'm glad I discovered this place since it's about a block from my apartment and I definitely will be back when I want a delicious an inexpensive lunch or dinner!"
"Another update: love love their 'Hawaii 5-0' burger. Perfect balance of savory, spicy, & sweet with the grilled pineapple, their special sauce and the spicy peppers. And don't forget of course their Ahi Tuna taco!"
"Holy smokes. This place. So. Good. We just got some late night tacos (spicy pork, grilled Mahi, Samuri, the Big and Little) and a shrimp po' boy. All was delicious and the delivery guy and the guy who took our order were nice and funny. We will be back for sure!"
Love this place.  Omar who took our order at the Belmont location was very friendly and courteous.  We had the soft shell carb po-boy and it was very tasty.  However I prefer the shrimp po-boy.  We also had the cajon fries which were  very good.  Tacos are also great.  Stop in and say hi to Omar.
"I was really between 3 and 4 stars.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and overall the food is really good.  I highly recommend the fried Mahi Mahi and the limited time only kimchi fries.  So yummy. The portions are generous too.  Note to management: Please serve freshly cooked fries rather than fries that have been sitting around along time.  I might come back another time soon to try something else on the eclectic menu."
"Fantastic tacos, cajun fries, and cheese burger. Very friendly and helpful. Good prices too. Well worth checking out."
"Wide selection, cheap prices, and yummy food :) I had the classic shrimp po boy and spicy beef taco - both were amazing! Will be back soon!"
"I take every visitor I have here, so awesome, absolutely ahhhmazing"
"I will sooooooo be back. I actually wasn't expecting much from this place just because the place has been so many different restaurants while I've lived in the area. But I decided to go in today and everyone there was amazingly helpful and so nice and patient (it takes me awhile to make a decision and they patiently went through the menu with me). I tried the pulled pork (I think?) with cilantro, pickled red onions, and mango chutney. It was FLAWLESS and mouthwatering (I got up midway through my first one to order a second). I plan on going back to try other things on their menu! So happy to have a place with great customer service (it really does make a difference) and even greater food! Can I give it six stars?"
"DELICIOUS! Very low key and mellow. AMAZING service... the guy at the counter was so patient with us in helping to narrow down our choices. I went with one of the burgers and it was, simply put, amazing. One of the better burgers I've had in Chicago. And the prices! SUPER CHEAP!!"
So delicious ! Loved the food. Nothing you order here could be short of amazing! The service is great. Shout out to Omar who is super nice and helpful!
"I've been here a few times and everything has been great. The ahi tuna taco and mahi mahi taco are probably my favorite and the service is out of this world. The line can be close to out the door but the guys up front are happy to answer questions. I hear the burgers are great but everytime I go back, I'm drawn to the tacos."
