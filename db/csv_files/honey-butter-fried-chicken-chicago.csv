Honey Butter Fried Chicken
"My friends are faithful and regular patrons of this northside establishment and everytime they visit it, my mouth drools.  So, on a recent trip to Chicago and a visit with those friends, we asked them to take us there for dinner.  This is now another notch on my trip I can scratch.The ""honey butter"" doesn't really refer to the chicken but to the honey butter served with the chicken that you can apply to it.  It's the same kind of honey butter you grew up spreading on graham crackers but it's SOOO much better on fried chicken.  And this fried chicken comes from the boneless chicken ranch of Larson cartoon fame because they have deboned the thighs and breasts to make it easier to dig into.  There is not ONE ounce of grease on this fried chicken, making it (at least in my book!) the healthiest fried chicken on earth.  I'm not kidding when I say this.  As hot as it was, you could tell it had only come out of a fryer minutes before and even after sitting through our meal, there wasn't any grease dripping.We got a couple of side dishes with our chicken, choosing the mac and cheese.  Rotini pasta in a great cheddar cheese that was light enough to prevent it sticking and a bacon topping over it, it was delish.  We also got a cole slaw that had kale and cabbage in it that was a refreshing twist and gave it new taste.  The last side was their roasted garlic grits.  They had a nice garlic taste but I thought was made a little on the mild side.  And they were too runny for this southerner and should be thicker but it's difficult to thicken them up and keep them in a consistency to wait for customers to order them so I understand how and why they are the way they are.  The dinners are also served with tasty little cornbreads that are some of the best I've ever eaten.There is a full bar to choose from to serve your drinks.  We saw a bloody mary circulating for it's orderer that is served with a fried chicken wing in it.  We almost ordered one just for that.  Instead, I had a couple of Oberon (?) draft beers while my companions had a couple bottles of a white wine they really adored.  The staff is the most friendly and outgoing you can find and our friends told us that all the employees are share owners of the restaurant so I imagine that is the reason.  They really love their business and it shows throughout your dining experience.If you visit one you will return again and again!"
"What can I say about this place. The chicken, the atmosphere, the kid friendly patio, the staff, and yes the pimiento Mac & Cheese. Yep, that pretty much sums all the things I can start off with, but I have to step back and think of how to give a non biased review. The place is bright and you get a sense of community when you first walk in. There's always a friendly smile at the front ready to take your order. Once you place your order its off to find a place to be seated. We chose the outside patio because of our 5 year old. She let her creative juices out on their huge magnetic wall that allowed for her to pretty much let loose while her food came. We been here a few times in the past year and have come to find ourselves judging others by the quality that we find here. With that being said... here's my review. The pros and cons:Pros: - Great chicken. They butcher in house and only use organic free range chickens, which at first bite. You will understand why they are as good as they are. The chicken is lightly dusted with flour from what I can tell and then fried. The chicken was moist inside and had a beautiful crunch on the outside. Our server made sure to remind us to put some of the homemade honey butter on it and it was an even better adventure. - Will never stop talking about their Pimiento Mac & Cheese. I don't know how to describe it properly, but I can only get it as close as having a homemade southern meal. I truly enjoy ordering it when we go. - Prices are bit higher than most fried chicken restaurants, but it makes up for it in quality. - Staff is super friendly- Their iced teas are brewed in house and you can sweeten them up with simple syrup or agave.. Sweet!Now onto the bad parts.Cons:- Prices are a bit higher than most. I spent $48 on meals for three and we only had 3 drinks, small Man & Cheese, small mashed potatoes, and I think a total of 6 pieces of chicken. This makes it a bit difficult to be an regular with a family. Though its a great place for every other weekend. - Location could be better, but I guess it's just me wanting this place to be closer to me. I live in Logan Square. That's pretty much it. The place is solid with their offerings and its shows every time we go and see a full house. Definitely a place to check out."
"What an AMAZING discovery we made during our visit in Chicago! We (luckily) were staying just a few doors down from HBFC when visiting the city and thought the place looked promising. So happy we tried it because now I have bragging rights over a fun little gem to recommend friends going to visit Chi-Town.I have never had butter more delicious than the honey butter here. DO take their recommendation and slather on some butter on the fried chicken because it tastes amazing! Their fried chicken is tender, but still crunchy on the outside and has great flavor with or without the butter. I also tried their pimento mac and cheese, which, while it is definitely a favorite, is a VERY strong cheese. Think cheddar x5! So if you are averse to strong cheese flavors, this might not be for you. It is a little ""watery"" for those who are die hard no liquid mac n cheesers, but I personally enjoyed the flavors quite a bit. I also tried the kale coleslaw, which is also a bit saucy but tastes great. I ended up finishing the entire side and wishing I had more, since it offers a really nice balance to the fried chicken. Love their corn muffins, especially with that delicious butter.There is a really great patio out back to catch some sunshine, as well as a few indoor seating areas. If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend!"
"I am a fan, but I was annoyed with a few aspects of this place. Came here to check this off my Chicago bucket list, maybe I would have had a better experience if this place wasn't overly hyped?Walking up on a Saturday night at around 7, I called ahead of time and the hostess told me that we would have to wait at minimum 15 minutes to be seated. That's not bad for a Saturday at all. What she didn't mention, and what I didn't know until we got there, was that you have to wait in line to order your food first before being seated. That means, despite countless open tables surrounding us, we had to wait in line standing for 20 minutes to place our order before being seated. There was one guy working the register, and about 20 people standing before us. Why we couldn't be seated first and then order is beyond me.Placed our order, I got the two piece fried honey butter chicken with cornbread, kale slaw, sweet potato salad, and a rhubarb cocktail. Boyfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwich with pimento mac and cheese, and a beer.Great patio seating outside, very friendly wait staff, and the food came out in about 5 minutes after being seated. The fried chicken was some of the best I've ever had, they tell you to spread the honey butter on it, which I'd never done before, but it makes or breaks the experience if you don't. Boyfriend's sandwich was amazing, but with a leftover pool of buffalo sauce on the platter, way too much sauce. Mac and cheese was excellent, but kale slaw was beyond bland. Just basically shaved kale with a plain white sauce of some kind (not sure if mayonnaise or greek yogurt?). Sweet potatoes were excellent, but served cold, so it was a little strange. It was a sweet potato salad, so I get that potato salad is usually served cold, but even a guy we were sitting next to chirped up and agreed that it would taste better served hot.All in all good food, but not worth waiting in line for. I would come back, but after spending around 30$ on just myself for fried chicken and mediocre sides, I would order ahead and get takeout instead. Definitely extreme hit or miss with what you decide to order, I would suggest sticking to the fried chicken individual pieces or sandwiches, mac and cheese, and the creamed corn which looked good but we didn't get to try."
"Dudes. This shizz is amazing. I've been gettin' down on fried chicken for 30-something years now, and I've had some ridiculously good chicken (my favorite is from a place called Chickens, appropriately... that is the stuff of my childhood dreams!), but I digress...People in Chicago do not make the fried chicken up to my So-Ill par. I said it. I mean it. But holy crap does Honey Butter Fried Chicken take a killer stab at it. I've only picked up for carryout a few times, but every single time it is piping hot, crispy, golden, perfect. These aren't mutant KFC chickens. This is legit, delicious, amazing fried chicken. And then you put what on it? Honey butter? I mean give me a freaking break. Order online, it is ready for pick-up in 15 minutes. FIFTEEN MINUTES, I SAID! That's shorter than it takes for me to drive my happy butt over here, shorter than the amount of time it takes for some angsty broad to give you the Popeye's you ordered in the drive-thru, shorter than running to Jewel to pick up beers to go with your chicken. You get the picture.Sides are delicious, cornbread is great, chicken is just ridiculous. Go."
"The actual honey butter is delicious. They corn bread muffins were also pretty damn good. Together they were heavenly. The chicken itself was so so. I don't like paying that much for just dark meat, I prefer to choose what pieces I get but that's how they roll. If you are a fried chicken fanatic you need to try it.  Better than Parsons, but Harold's is still my #1."
"I ordered the 4 piece chicken, and had the sides of Mac and cheese and sweet potato salad. The chicken was great! The honey butter was delicious. I literally want to stock pile on that itself and just add it to everything. The Mac & cheese was also very good. I liked the sweet potato salad, and I know it's a salad and salads are not warm. But it just was so strange eating it cold. I wanted it to be warm so bad, I think it would have went from good, to outstanding. The service is friendly and attentive! Overall I will be back!"
"Fried chicken is one of my four major food groups.  The others being chili, bananas, and string cheese.  Fried chicken is probably the most exciting.I'm a Parson's fan and have been known to visit more than once a week, but I'm open to all forms of fried yard bird and needed to cross HBFC off my bucket (beak-et?) list.  The teaser I had with Piece's HBFC pizza was just not enough.  I wasn't disappointed with our visit.  I tried a two piece order of chicken and my companion got the fried onion string sandwich and we split a pimento cheese mac.  A little of that thing goes a long way, but was quite good.  I liked that the chicken was very crisp on the outside but moist on the inside and the paprika is a great touch.  Obviously that honey butter is delish as well.  The space isn't huge, but if you don't go at prime time, or now that it's warm, hit the patio, you should be ok.  We're both totally all about going back.  Someday I'll hit all the chicken hot-spots in one massive chicken crawl and then promptly die on the sidewalk."
"Put the honey butter on the chicken!  PUT IT ON THE CHICKEN, I SAID!Delicious, greasy, and decadent. Beware lines out the door that are near reminiscent of Hot Dogs."
"Tasty buffalo wings! Definitely will come back. Wished the corn muffins were warm but that's a minor detail. Service was great and the food came out quickly and piping hot. The honey butter is not too sweet and gives the chicken that ""chicken and waffle"" taste that folks are into. Chicken moist and crunchy. The Mac and cheese was ok. Everyone enjoyed the food. Eating out on the patio is a nice touch too."
"I don't have the words! Perfectly crispy, seasoned, juicy fried chicken with no bones! (Except for the drumstick). But I was amazed by how tender and meaty each piece of chicken is. You get a lot of chicken without all the fat, tendons, and other undesirable parts. Just juicy, crispy, yummy chicken. I could talk about their chicken all day. Don't forget to put the honey butter on it! The corn muffins feel like an afterthought, but they are still yummy. We tried the pimento mac and cheese and the smashed potatoes. They are perfect complements to the fried chicken, but I wouldn't say they stand on their own as spectacular. The chicken is definitely the star. We sat outside and enjoyed some refreshing iced tea (free refills) and a Damned Good Sweet Iced Tea made with Death Door's white whiskey. Perfect for a summer day. I can't wait to go back and try their chicken sandwiches. We went around 3 pm and they were still pretty hopping but not packed. They don't take reservations because they just have counter service, so heads up that they are very busy for brunch. With many options for how many pieces of chicken you want and a lot of delicious flavor for the price, I can only recommend that you make sure you get enough chicken! A four and two piece with two sides was a good amount for two hungry people. But be prepared to want more! (Soon, real soon)"
"Disclaimer * I'm a vegetarian going to a chicken restaurant so I cannot comment on the primary food item.I came here for brunch with my husband and some friends after seeing it on check please. I was expecting it to be line out the door crazy busy. However, while it was bustling, it wasn't ridiculously busy. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was delicious! It was spicy and had quite a kick which I liked. It came with a chicken wing garnish which I thought was cute. They had a pretty good beer collection too. I ordered the Mac n cheese and biscuits. I also tried my husband's grits. All the food was good, but the star was the honey butter. Omg. I could eat tubs of that. My husband said that the chicken was good, but there is better chicken to be had.One comment about the clientele- lots of babies. So if you're not a baby person, don't come here on a Saturday morning."
"This place is everything. I took some convincing to get me through the door, I just didn't understand what could be so special about fried chicken. And then, my world changed. After many nudges, my guy got me in the door. We ordered some honey butter fried chicken, wings, and pimento mac and cheese. We also enjoyed the natural sodas. Within a bite, my body now began to crave HBFC. My mouth is watering just writing this review. The chicken is tender and juicy- the breading is to die for. The pimento mac and cheese is basically what my dreams are made of. I order it for holidays now and it makes the family especially happy. The wings were cooked to perfection and just excellent. On top of an amazing food experience, I have had nothing but pleasant, sincere, and kind interactions with the people working and the owners (who are generally always there). What a cool little family owned joint. I have become and will remain a loyal regular here."
"Came up for brunch on a Sunday; place wasn't crowded, food was served quickly. Really enjoyed the root beer made with pure can sugar. I had the brunch portion of chicken and grits and a side of sweet chili Thai wings. My companions shared a 4 piece of chicken and a side of mac and cheese, and a couple other things I don't remember.I get where the appeal is putting the honey butter on the chicken, that's fine. We'll get to that.The chicken and grits came with a fried egg on top, and it was a decent sized potion and very good. The Thai wings were just all right. The mac and cheese had pimento cheese, which certainly wasn't what I was expecting. I don't know if pimento cheese works, especially in a town where milder cheeses are the norm for the old standby.Now, the fried chicken. Was it awesome? No. Was it good? Yes, and I definitely like the decadence of putting a very good honey butter concoction on your chicken, but the chicken has to be hot so it melts, and doesn't look like you're putting frosting on your drumstick. Ours was not. So, would I go back? Sure. Would I go back at a time where people are waiting for hours to get this? Hell no. I'm glad to have gotten it while I could."
"Really good fried chicken.  Guys, stop going to Parson's.  It's not that good.  HBFC is way better.  Perfectly seasoned, very moist, very delicious.  It's a little expensive, but you will forget about that once you bite into this chicken.  I also had sides of the mashed potatoes and the collard greens.  The potatoes were amazing although there could have been a bit more gravy.  The collard greens were interesting... I have only had them one other time so I don't really have much to compare them with.  They seemed fine, though.  The point is.....  you need to get this chicken in your life."
"Been here before, but since I'm a yelper now im yelping. Ordered the brunch special Biscuits and gravy with a piece of chicken and an egg. Was pretty good. Though being a classic bisquit and gravy guy I was expecting more of a white gravy. The gravy was a chicken gravy, still pretty good. The only problem with the bisquit is that it was one. Could have been more. Im fat, i need busquits. The piece of fried chicken was boneless thigh. Really only like breast meat. But good fried chicken can even make the parts you dont like taste good, Honey Butter does that. The egg was sunny side up. Havent had that in a long time. It was really good and went well with everything else. Overall, very impressive. Highly recommend this place. If you do come here expect more from the food. The staff could be friendlier, friendliest was one of the lady servers. Pretty also. Also, tried my nieces pimento mac n cheese since shes picky and no way should get near it.  It was great. Just wish they had smoked ham. Would be a killer combo, maybe one day and Im in Chicago when that happens."
"Go here for brunch and order the following: Chicken and Grits- creamy roasted garlic grits topped with tender roast chicken, chicken cracklings, buffalo honey sauce, and a fried egg. Biscuits and Gravy- open faced biscuit topped with fried chicken, gravy, and a fried egg. Pimento Mac & Cheese- Wisconsin cheddar, garlic bread crumbs.Shared these items today, and both of us thought the food was exceptional. The flavors and execution were on point. We arrived right when they opened at 11am. The room was filled before noon. You have to be patient. This isn't a fast food joint so the food takes a while to arrive, but once you begin eating, you'll realize it's worth the wait. I've had other items here like the individual pieces of fried chicken, fried chicken sandwich, dump cake, etc. These are all good, but the above three are phenomenal. Highly recommend!"
"Kudos to the creativity with the entrées. Like someone said before me. The staff is very friendly & welcoming. The have goose island root beer, That gets an A+ from me. The patio is  a great place to sit and enjoy your food while catching some rays and hanging with your buds / family / significant other. But the only reason I am giving them three stars is because I can not say that I was wowed by their Mac & cheese as others have been. Was pleased with The Original Fried Chicken Sandwich but did not seem to be fresh as if the just had made it. Had a cool feel to it. But don't get me wrong. It was cooked all the way through. The Kale & Cabbage Slaw was delicious."
"Honestly...I'm a bit disappointed. I've been excited to go here for a while. The chicken just didn't meet my expectations. It wasn't bad..it simply wasn't worth the hype. It was just a little too dry for my tastes.. The honey butter was delicious, but it didn't make up for the subpar chicken. I feel like the chicken should have been of a higher quality because of how much we paid (a 4 piece fried chicken with honey butter and 3 mini corn muffins was $15). With all that said, I did love the corn muffins. The patio in the back was pretty awesome as well.I probably won't go back to HBFC. I want their honey butter recipe though!"
"Butter on fried chicken? Enough said. The chicken is super crispy on the outside and really juicy inside. It's a perfect combo. When you add the butter on top and some cornbread, it is perfection. The cocktails are solid too and chilling on the back patio on a cool Chicago night is great. They have some pretty solid vegetarian options as well. Other menu favorites of mine are the Kale and Cabbage slaw and fired onion & hummus sandwich."
"""Dude, Cormac, wanna go try this really good place for chicken on Thursday?""""I dunno, Theo, I'm getting fitted for my bespoke suit that day.""""The line's only like an hour long, Cormac!""""Where's it located?! That's like nothing compared to other popular spots we hit up on our $600, 38 year-old bikes""""Up in Avondale, on Elston Ave.""""Oh man, I'm there. Just lemme look up where Elston Ave. is.""(30 minutes later)""Oh sh*t, Cormac. Look at all the fried chicken I get for $15. Four pieces! Nice!""""Dude, I just ordered some mac and cheese AND mash and some cornbread. Totally worth half of our electric bill payment!""""Theo! Dude, so many cans of beer that I pretend to know to choose from. They don't even give you a glass so you can show off to all the other scenesters what you're drinking!""""Totally gonna ride the Puch here for the back patio...hope it dosen't get stolen in this sketchy hood, though.""""Naw, Cormac. Just use Uber.""2nd star for the patio.Otherwise, you just paid $45 to eat a fried chicken dinner.On old Elston Ave. After waiting 45 minutes in line."
I like the interior design and their music. The chicken tastes good. And the people there are very friendly.
"I've been wanting to visit this place for MONTHS and when I finally did, IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT! Everything my friend and I ordered was beyond our expectations. Of course the main attraction is the chicken but the sides were just as phenomenal. The sides weren't simply traditional and had their own twist of flavor and freshness. I have nothing bad to say about HBFC. Location is PERFECT because parking is free (for now). It's like a hidden gem because it's never a long wait to order or and you seat yourself. The outdoor space is lively and I can only imagine what it's like at night because of the lighting and atmosphere. So far, I've been twice but I wish I could go back every weekend. Unfortunately, the distance from my house and waistline won't allow it."
"Very cute,  quaint neighborhood eatery. Saw it on Check Please and brought my family of 4 out to sample. The fried chicken was really well seasoned and my drumstick was definitely kicked up a notch with the honey butter. It was weird to me to lather the chicken with the butter but I appreciated the taste. My husband was not so convinced it was the right thing to do having the sweet versus savory argument. He did enjoy the fried chicken sandwich though. Our cornbread was tasty. The pimento mac and cheese was good,  the creamy grits even better. The collard greens were average, a little undercooked and not much to talk about. The coleslaw was just too extra and not in a good way. It seems that the recipe is so far away from traditional cole slaw that you would have to acquire the taste for it which none of the 4 of us did. The food is well prepared and fresh but make no mistake in thinking you are having traditional southern cuisine. It was a cool ecletic revamp. We also really enjoyed the sofa fountain offering black cherry, ginger ale and mandarin orange beverages. We drove an hour plus from home to dine here and it was worth the experience dining out on the patio during an awesome weather Saturday listening to jazz music. I do feel that for the price of $65 for 2 adults,  a teenager and an 8 year old to eat fried chicken and sides was a bit pricey for what we received in value.  It was nice but no one was blown away. If I was in the neighborhood again I would stop in."
"Must have- the classic chicken sandwich, pickle of the dayIn the vein of modern twists on soul classics, Honey Butter Fried Chicken infuses traditional southern home cooking with contemporary flavor profiles and modern twists. The service was good, but even in an off hour, the limited seating is packed, especially when the patio is closed.The fried chicken had got a great crisp crust with some zing that really shines when slathered in honey butter. The chicken pieces are smaller, but my basis of comparison are those huge, juicy, and pumped full of chemicals southern fried chicken.The sides are good compliments. The Mac and cheese has a sharp cheddar and strong pimento flavor and is complimented nicely by the excellent kale slaw. The cobbler of the day had good flavors, but was all mush and texturally unappealing.The sandwiches are really standouts- they combine the good chicken with complimentary flavors and textures in a joy between bread slices. Always worth trying the new featured sandwich."
"As a southerner, finding the best damn fried chicken in Chicago was a pleasant surprise! Well worth the wait, as they cook each order fresh. Don't miss the sweet potato salad, grits, collard greens or creamed corn either. Pure cane sugar sodas from the fountain, a great selection of local craft beers, and homemade desserts round out the experience. This place is as much a must as pizza and hot dogs!"
"I woke up this morning to my wife talking about fried chicken. This is notable because, in general, she's not a fan of fried chicken. She won't eat meat on the bone, and the notion of consuming skin is something she's just not interested in. So yeah, I had to jump on this opportunity. She did a bit of research and confirmed honey butter had some boneless options, so we hopped in the car and headed up to Avondale. Thankfully it was a bit cold and rainy out, so the brunch line wasn't too bad. I can only imagine how crazy it gets when it's warm and the patio is open. They've got a pretty efficient system in place, and the wait for food really wasn't terrible, but still... the place gets packed. We sat in the back, against the wall and were promptly served our drinks. My wife got the traditional HBFC bloody mary, which had a chicken wing floating on top that I immediately gobbled up. Delicious and salty! I ordered the threesome (Michelada with tequila) which was quite nice. I actually preferred it to my wife's bloody, which felt a little under seasoned and under boozed. Good regardless.As for the chicken? Was it the best I've had in Chicago? No... but it was good. The seasoning was great. While I'm happy my wife was able to enjoy a boneless breast (which she really did!) I found the bone in leg to be much more moist and delicious.Smearing some of the honey butter on the chicken was certainly decedent. Such a wonderful combination of savory and sweet. As for spicy, the honey buffalo dipping sauce was delicious, though I question the $1.50 charge for what really should have been free. Same for the delicious garlic aioli. Delicious but seriously? $1.50 for an ounce of sauce. Kind of ridiculous, but still, yes... delicious. I'm not actually complaining here. We loved the sides by the way. The Thai green curry creamed corn was served up ridiculously hot, but we gladly burned our mouths. The pimento mac & cheese could have used both more pimento and cheese, but was great. The kale and cabbage slaw with cumin felt out of place, but was awesome. I could have easily eaten an entire bowl if I wasn't eating anything else. Oh and yes... The cornbread biscuits were terrific, with of course that luscious honey butter. Goddamn. So nice.While the chicken wasn't unbelievable, it was the combination of all of the textures and flavors on one plate that made it. We really enjoyed our meal, and there is no question we'll be back.*diabetics, take way more insulin than you think you need. there is honey in everything!"
"For all the hype this place gets, I was a little disappointed. The batter on the chicken has great flavor, but it wasn't super crispy. I also found the honey butter to be too sweet, so I didn't enjoy that on my chicken. It is also very expensive...for an 8 pc with some very small sides, we paid 40 bucks. I'm more of a Harold's kind of girl, I think."
"The butter was tasty, but that's it. The chicken was overcooked and tasted fishy. Either the oil wasn't the right temp and they cooked it too long or the oil was old and needed to be switched out. At that point it didn't really matter. At $15 for a 4 piece and your sign reads FRIED CHICKEN, then you better know how to do it right every single time.The smashed potatoes were overcooked and the mac & cheese tasted like the jabañero cheetos. I started to wonder if the noodles were just tossed in the Tostitos salsa con queso dip. This place is nothing to brag about, but again to each their own. Sometimes you either love something or you hate it. I personally don't care for establishments that don't take pride in their name. Is all about the money? Best wishes!"
"Honey butter... Atop fried chicken with just the right amount of kick. Simply put it is amazing.  My girlfriend and I have been wanting to go to HBFC for some time now, and finally made it for the first time last night 7/24/15.  We ordered a two piece chicken (which comes with corn bread) an order of wings, and the mac n cheese.  It all lived up to the hype.  The chicken was so tender with a kick of spice and the honey butter set it off.  The Mac was thick, creamy, and delicious.  The honey butter is amazing on anything you order.It was no surprise to us the food was amazing, but it was not the best part of our visit.  From the moment we ordered our food, to the moment we got up to leave we experienced the absolute best customer service we'd ever seen.  Every single person was extremely kind, helping, prompt, and very personal when having a conversation.  We will be back! Often.  We also signed up for the email list with a little hope to get invited to the secret dinners up stairs!  Thank you HBFC, and this is a must try for everyone."
"This space is amazing (outdoor patio!), the drinks are delicious, and the honey butter is heavenly.  The fried chicken was fried very well; moist inside and crispy on the outside.  The honey butter was so good and it added the perfect amount of sweetness to our chicken.  We had the original honey butter fried chicken sandwich and the LA LOUISIANNE.  I enjoyed the honey butter fried sandwich much more than the Louisianne (it had too much mustard for my taste). We ordered the mac and cheese and kale cole slaw as our sides.  The cole slaw had a nice crunch to it and the mac and cheese was very cheesy.  We tried the damn good sweet tea and it was delicious.  I wish the glasses were bigger because I wanted more. Overall I think this place was ok.  It's competing with other BBQ and fried chicken places on the Northside and while the chicken was delicious the sides were only ok."
"I'm not a connoisseur of fried chicken, but I think I can safely say this is the best you'll get in Chicago.  I really enjoyed my food experience here and I'd go back again.  They seem to know what they're doing with the table-waiting situation, but if you find yourself waiting after you've ordered, there's a small bar in back where you can sit and have a drink.  I tested that space out since I arrived early and was waiting for friends.  Prices are reasonable and they have a couple of in-house cocktails that seem good (like spiked tea and lemonade).  I think this are of the restaurant would be great once it's warm and their patio is open - definitely a place I'd consider for a summer night out.  The food is reasonably priced and the menu is big enough that you don't have to feel like a piece of fried chicken is your only food option.  I got the fried chicken sandwich which was EXCELLENT with the spicy mayo and some kind of giardinara on top.  The bread didn't get too soggy and the chicken stayed super crispy.  The sides all come separate but it's worth ordering a few and sharing with the table.  The grits were delish, as was the cornbread (order extra) but the greens were too bitter for my tastes.  I'd say go with the grits, cornbread, and mac and cheese - all sides that are always good, no matter what.  Speaking of cornbread - that honey butter on the cornbread is DELICIOUS.  You have to get it and eat it with the honey butter.  The honey butter is clearly their specialty and it's amazing.  It's just the right amount of sweet added to really yummy whipped butter.  Comes out tasting like excellence.  I'll be back, which is not a thing I say of many places.  Usually I'll only go back if the occasion arises (meaning someone invites me) but I'll definitely go out of my way to eat here again."
"Slow your roll. The prices are too high to make a mistake with something like the Pimento Mac'N Cheese.It looks like the hype has calmed; we hardly waited in line and there were plenty of seats. I ordered the 2-Piece Fried Chicken, the side of Pimento Mac'N Cheese, and a can of Vander Mill cider. I didn't find it to be outrageously priced, but I felt bad shelling out that much cash when the show stopper was the Corn Muffins. They say to ""put the butter on the bird."" I tried that, and it was tasty, but I felt the drumstick was great all on its own and their signature honey butter went much better with the bread. I also thought the paprika on the chicken was a nice touch but someone sprinkled it with too heavy a hand.The Vander Mill cider was familiar and reliable. No complaints there. I feel macaroni and cheese should be the same. So, I was terribly let down to find that, despite the Velveeta-like yellow hue and consistency throughout, I couldn't detect the Wisconsin cheddar from the item description. Instead, I was assaulted by pimiento flavoring in every bite. A bold, peppery noodle dish it was. Mac & Cheese, IMO, it was not. My dining companion apologized for not warning me and said he'd tried it once before and has never ordered it again."
"Very good service and very good food, BUT for the price I would like more chicken. I ordered the French toast and Chicken. I had two big pieces of French toast but one small fried chicken breast. My parents ordered the Chicken & Grits and ended up ordering an extra piece of chicken. But I will definitely be back. The food was very good. I love Louisiana inspired restaurants because Cajun/Creole are one of my favorite cuisines. All is good, just give us a little more chicken."
I wish I could give this place 6 stars. Came here before a revolution brewery tour and it was hands down one of the best lunches I have ever had. I had the original honey butter fried chicken sandwich. The jalapeño mayo was delicious!! Also tried the pimento Mac and cheese as well as the Thai curry creamed corn. Not to mention Daisy Cutter tall boys.. Does it get better? Can't wait to come back when it's warm to check out the outdoor patio!
"Lotta reviews for this place, and I pass it by going to work so I made sure to try it out. Came on a hot afternoon, the patio here is pretty nice. I got the 2 piece for $8, pretty small pieces :( The server reminded me to put the ""honey butter"" on the chicken as he brought my food. Infact there are signs which say the same thing in this place. After eating the chicken I know why. The chicken wasn't as crispy as I would like, and also didn't have much flavor at all, lacked seasoning. The honey butter just gave the chicken a more sweet taste. Corn muffins were pretty good, but for me the pimento mac n cheese was the best, very rich with a small kick. Wish the menu had more options as well, maybe chicken n waffles. Dissapointed that the star attraction of this place is really  sweet butter I guess that's what's supposed to make this place unique. For the price I feel this spots overrated!"
"Fried chicken, cole slaw, mashed potatoes and thai curry cream corn. I really enjoyed this modern take on soul food. Kind of a fusion type feel with asian influences. I think that most of the food was just okay. It didnt really blow my socks off or leave a very long lasting impression. The best part of the meal was actually the the corn muffin in my opinion. I could have happily eaten a dozen of those. Chicken was moist and flavorful but the batter was kind of soggy and not crisp enough to my liking. Chicken fat mashed potatoes definitely and the unctuous chicken flavor but slowly made me feel sick and heavy. Pretty good food for a fair price. Would probably go somewhere else for some better friend chicken though."
"This place I must say is pretty damn good! I must admit, it is a little overpriced but it will not disappoint you. Like most people, we got the honey butter fried chicken. What exactly does that entail? You are given the chicken and some honey butter to slap it on top of your chicken. What amazed me the most is how quickly the butter melted and when I took that first bite, it was the best buttered chicken I ever ate! Another thing I really liked was that there wasn't as much grease. Usually when I'm eating friend chicken, it's really greasy and oily but this chicken opt that problem out which was perfect. We also had the mashed potatoes and it was pretty average. If anything, i would only come back for the fried chicken because with that and the butter, it's the best duo."
"Ok - I was hesitant to try and go at the last minute on unofficial Chicago St. Patrick's day, but I did it anyway and I am glad that I did.We lucked out and didn't have a ton of folks ahead of us in line (I can't say the same thing about when we left!).  I tried the buffalo chicken sandwich and also had a bite of the honey butter fried chicken 'regular' chicken sandwich.  Both were AMAZING.  OMG - I want to eat this every day.The space is night and they have a great back patio.  I assume it's packed almost always.  Prices are reasonable and they also had some fun drink specials, though we didn't try them out.  All in all, a great spot, perfect for lunch, dinner or take-out.  Really friendly staff and amazing and delicious food!"
"4pcs + 3 sides + 2 lemonades = $37. Eep. It's a little stiff for two people, but you can't argue the quality, service and flavor that comes pouring out of this place with love. I have been once for bruch: fried chicken over french toast with honey butter and a maple bourbon glaze (till my favorite thing here so far). The two times I came for dinner, I had friend chicken with a variety of sides. The lime/chili sweet potatoes were excellent - but a weird flavor combo with the honey butter chicken. I wouldn't recommend 'em. Pimento mac n cheese is solid. The classics of cabbage/kale slaw and mashed taters in gravy are the way to go!*I don't know who does the hiring here, but they have an eye for having overall handsome guys on staff. Just a word to the ladies. ;)"
"I LOOOOOVE this place. Amazing fried chicken close to home? Yes please.I am mystified by the amount of people on here complaining about the prices here;1) Don't tell me you don't look at menus online before you go?? Surely you were aware of how much it's going to cost?2)   It's about quality ingredients folks - humanely raised, antibiotic free chickens from Miller Amish Farms in Indiana, butchered in house. And sustainable practices - all their packaging (cups, straws etc) is compostable and biodegradable, which isn't cheap.If you want battery-raised, antibiotic chicken that's been prepped in some factory then go to KFC and pay KFC prices. Rant over, back to the chicken:I love the chicken here, crispy, tasty coating and sooo succulent inside. Slathering the delicious honey butter on the outside seems very, very wrong but tastes very, very right!Sides are pretty good, especially the kale slaw and the sweet potato salad.I also recommend their buffalo wings as an add-on if you're feeling hungry, they are very good (I liken them to a more korean style of wing, like you get at Crisp)Great drink selection, especially the craft cocktails - i recommend the Avondale Mule. Also their lemonade here is good. Even better when pared with one of their locally-sourced bourbons!I love the patio here too. Great place to eat outside.Be warned this place is popular and gets pretty busy but don't be put off by a line out the door - it moved pretty quickly."
"Fried chicken is having a moment in Chicago, and this Avondale option has a lot to offer. I appreciated the cute patio, the friendly service, and the restaurant's commitment to humanely raised poultry. Even local and cane sugar-based sodas! All of that is a big thumbs up for me.But if your chicken is just okay, it doesn't matter that it was the happiest bird that ever clucked. I want the humanely raised, antiobiotic-free, farm-fresh etc. etc. etc. chicken that makes me drool into my plate. I want to have fever-dreams about that chicken. The meat here was of good quality but not juicy and the breading arrived a little cold. The honey butter was delicious, but it should be a nice addition, not a necessary one. There is better chicken to be had.My friend and I liked the sides. The grits were the standout; they were creamy but not loaded down in cheese, so you actually tasted the sweetness of the corn. The chicken schmatz in the mashed potatoes made them rich and no-gravy-necessary. My friend liked the kale, but it was a miss for me; I had a large blob of the yogurt sauce and it made for an unappetizing bite.If I hear about any improvements to the chicken itself, I'd come back. But for this price, I'll look elsewhere for my fried chicken fix."
Two of the three stars are just for the honey butter.  The chicken can be overly salty sometimes and the Mac and cheese is terrible.  They use a pimento cheese which tastes awful and is a complete disappointment.  Service is always good but food is not good enough  to keep me coming back.
"I would give this place 3.5 stars, but it's not an option.We got there at 530 on a Sunday, place was not busy at not. Not really a line, a few people seated inside, so my husband + I sit down with our sleeping baby who is in her stroller while we wait for friends. We are there a whole 2 minutes when a guy with menus comes up to us and says, you can't sit there. It's first come first serve. My husband tells him we are waiting for friends, they are parking. The guy goes, you can sit at the bar. Seriously? The place is not packed at all, I can understand if there were people waiting for tables, but that was not the case. My husband was ticked. We had to navigate our way through the tables, through the bar and to the patio area with the stroller, thank goodness we had used our smaller stroller and our baby stayed asleep. The guy didn't have to be so rude. It's our first time there, again, the place is not crowded. Why would we sit at the bar? There aren't any tables there, it's all high tops. We get outside, there are a lot of tables available, my husband orders our food while I stay with the baby. Our friends came a few minutes after.So my husband + I get a 4 piece meal (dark meat), mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, iced tea and a beer. They give you a number and bring the food out to the table. It took about 20 minutes or so for our food to get to us, which is fine. The chicken was really good. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The honey butter was good, but I don't really know why you would need extra? They give you a good amount and I didn't even use half of it. I don't think you need that much. My husband didn't like the honey butter at all, it was too sweet for him. Mashed potatoes were good, mac and cheese, I nearly spit that out. Gross. Didn't like that at all. It tasted like it came out of a box. Also didn't really like the corn bread, was okay, kind of stale, so maybe we didn't get a fresh batch? So 4 pieces of chicken, 2 sides, one drink and a beer was $40. It was good, I would go back, but I would tell my husband to skip the beer and skip the mac and cheese and hopefully we don't run into the rude guy again. Seriously. Most restaurants we've been too that are nice sit down places and more formal have been more accommodating when we have our daughter with us. This place is more casual, you think they wouldn't be so anal about tables when the place isn't even half full."
The line was out the door on a Saturday night. We wanted to grab some to go so call in a order ahead of time to cut down on wait time.  The chicken is Amazing! It was well worth the wait!
"Came here and had the four piece (which comes with corn bread) and the pimento mac n' cheese. To be honest, I was a little underwhelmed. The chicken itself was pretty good but it didn't wow me. It wasn't super crunchy and that's what I like so it was a little disappointing. I like the spices and butter on the chicken and can definitely appreciate that the chicken is locally raised. The corn bread and mac n' cheese were meh. Their cocktails sounded pretty good and they also have a nice array of craft beers.I'd would come back here to try the chicken sandwiches but was a little sad this place wasn't as good as I was expecting."
"Overall, this place is pretty delicious. Their honey butter is obviously the star item of this place and literally goes well with basically anything. I went with a few people last night and they loved the place as well. The outside decor is very cute and cozy. We ordered the creamy corn, sweet potato, mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese side dishes. Creamy corn is definitely my favorite side from here. The drumsticks are moist and pack a lot of flavor, esp with the honey butter. If you have a craving for fried chicken, this is the place to go."
"This place is pretty great.  Step up to the counter, make your order and it will come out to your table in a flash.  Seriously, I was impressed by how quickly the food arrived.It's got a very chill vibe.  I felt very relaxed here.  There's no pretension.The fried chicken ($8 for a breast and leg) is very good.  While the skin could use some better seasoning, the chicken meat is very moist and tender.  YES, you are supposed to put the honey butter on the chicken.  And it's gooood.The biscuits were nice, but perhaps a little underwhelming.Sides were generous for the price.I very much enjoyed the pimento mac 'n' cheese ($3.75).  Velvety cheese and nice firm noodles.The shmaltz smashed potatoes ($2.75) were sinfully delicious.  Thank you, chicken fat gravy!The honey buffalo wings (5 for $5) were more tangy than hot.  They tasted like something you'd get in an Asian restaurant.  Pretty good, but better as a side than a main dish.I'd pass on the Avondale Ginger Mule ($8) - Molasses, Ginger, Death's Door Gin, Lime, Mint.  I think the molasses is a mistake.  It took away from the refreshing feel you normally get from a mule.  Oh, well...For food this good, I would expect to pay much more.  Props to Honey Butter for delivering quality food without a painful price!"
"Came here for the first time before I left on vacay....My friends couldn't have picked a better place to meet up. First off, it's a quaint spot, awesome environment, staff, decor- yata yata. But the food!!!  I had the two piece chicken boobies, with a side of fries and cornbread. Sighs, I'm thinking of making that trip. The Nugget had chicken and waffles, and he emptied his plate. My girls ate well too. If you're in need of a great foodgasm..., go here!!!!"
"possibly the best fried chicken that i've ever had.we were in town for the weekend, checked out this joint on a recommendation. ended up eating it two nights in a row. the chicken is moist, the breading is crispy, and you put the honey butter directly on the chicken! how amazing. also, the breasts and thighs are boneless, so you don't waste any time with that pesky bone.the drinks are awesome too. i'm not a drinker, but i had a few there and i was impressed. sodas are tits too.all in all, we'll be back next time we're in chicago."
"We had to check this place out after seeing it on Check Please. We went at about 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon. The place was packed with a line to the door throughout our entire experience. Service : Meh. Counter service was short and rude. Table service is nonexistent other than your food being run out,  which is confusing since they have drink menus on the table. Food: Perfectly cooked chicken with a great,  crispy skin. There is a bit of spice but nothing major. The star of the show is that honey butter. The chicken needs it for flavor. We shared three sides and none of them were good. Pimento Mac and cheese was just gross. The potato salad was made with sweet potatoes and was just ok. The grits were the best side. Use the hot sauce on the table for them. Drinks: Nothing spectacular. Actually,  the pop was gross too. I get it. It's a hipster chicken shack and they're trying to fill that niche, especially on the beverage side. Their NA beverages need some work."
"Their pricing hasn't changed!  We spent $40.00 on food for 2 persons.  We left hungry.  It wasn't bad, but well, I know this place is not a family style restaurant serving food enough to feed an army here, but I was hoping for more.  Taste wise, it was good, but not good enough for me to want to re-visit it."
"First time coming here & unfortunately I can't say I was blown away. I ordered The Original Fried Chicken Sandwich with no sides (I scanned the menu & realized payday is Friday). The cabbage was a pleasant surprise as I've never had it on a chicken sandwich. Whatever sauce they use is also phenomenal BUT I felt some type of way about paying almost $9 for a sandwich of that size. Sorry I didn't snap a photo but at that price, I want my side(s) included. Not counting this one out by any means, though. The corner location, the outdoor patio, & the friendliness I encountered has inclined me to give this place a second chance."
"I had first heard of honey butter fried chicken from the RedEye review. They mentioned you put butter on fried chicken and then eat it. I was in! I first had this place last year and I loved loved loved their fried chicken! It's juicy, slightly spicy and so crunchy! The butter you put on top makes it extra! Don't really care for the sides but I would stay for the chicken! And the cute corn bread!"
"I was so impressed with hbfc! We ordered and picked a seat outside, our food came out in under 5 minutes, I'd say we were in and out in 30 minutes. I got the classic chicken sandwich and the hill pop to drink, my bf got the chicken Reuben and a dark horse beer, both were incredibly tasty.  The pimento mac and cheese was a nice change from basic mac n cheese as well. The chicken was moist and tender while still maintaining that crunchy, fried element. The patio is beautiful. Well definitely be back soon"
"The first time we are there, the chicken was served hot and the sides were tasty. This time, the chicken was cold and the sides were overly salty. Maybe it was the sides we had but the whole experience was sub par. For the price (over $40 for three of us), we didn't see value at all. Quite disappointing in many levels."
A delightful addition to the community. Great people and Joe is the best. Try the Gio - Joe! It  is delicious. I Love HBFC
"My roommate and I went here with our suburban dads who were visiting the city for the weekend. We had just done the brewery tour at Revolution and were pretty full on beer, but we made the quick walk to Honey Butter anyway.For the four of us, we ordered the four-piece fried chicken, an original chicken sandwich to split, an order of wings, the mac n cheese, the sweet potato salad, and the mashed potatoes. For drinks, my roommate and I both got the ginger mule (excellent - not too sweet, but still a great summer drink). Our dads got beers (really nice selection of craft beer) and iced tea. We ordered all of this at the counter (with super friendly service by the employee working), and paid about $70 for all of it.The fried chicken was perfect, had some kick to it and a really nice crisp from the breading. We spread the honey butter on it (per recommendations from fellow Yelpers), which was amazing. The best thing we had was the chicken sandwich. My dad almost went to get another before realizing he was super full. He didn't shut up about it the rest of the night, and I'm convinced he might make frequent pilgrimages from the burbs just to have it again. But rightfully so. The sandwich is oozing with butter, but somehow still has a great crunch and the bun holds together without being soggy. The wings were good, but not as memorable as the sandwich or chicken.As for the sides, the mac and cheese was great. The sweet potato salad had an interesting flavor profile - good, but not sure I would get it again. The mashed potatoes were good as well, and the little corn bread muffins you get are the perfect complement to the meal. I will definitely dine here again. We were a little lucky as it was pretty empty when we got there, so we got ordered our food immediately and got it shortly thereafter. We snagged a great patio seat. This will definitely become a go-to spot."
"I've had more fried chicken from this place this year than I have had fried chicken ever in the last 3 years. I just keep going back. It's easy to get to on the Belmont bus (get off at Sacramento and walk up to Elston) and their patio is pretty rad. I haven't been to any of the other newly established fried chicken places (Parsons, The Roost, Leghorn...) so I can't compare it to those. But I like this place so I may just stick with what I like (creature of habit). :-)Chicken has a great flavor. I personally like that they de-bone the breasts which makes it a lot easier to eat. The thought of putting butter on my chicken weirded me out the first time but it works. It's so good. I've gotten the 2 piece as well as the sandwich and I'd say go for the 2 piece because it comes with the little cornbread muffins that are just delightful. I wish the 2 piece came with a side because it's a little pricey without. However I'm not big on sides in general so I normally don't order them. I've had the mac & cheese and I just thought it was ok. As far as beverages go, I love the fountain sodas! They're cane sugar sodas and one of the reasons I love coming here. I like to mix the black cherry (yes, black cherry!) with the cola. They also have a nice selection of beers.One time when I was there they had samples of their brownie. It's good and has a kick at the end. It's rich though so I'd probably suggest sharing with a friend.If you're going with a group, a might suggest sharing the 8 piece chicken and getting some sides and just smorgasbord-ing it. Friendly staff (they offer to take your trash for you!) and good service. Order at the counter and they bring it out to you."
"This place is overpriced. Plain and simple. The portions are far too small for what you get. I love efforts for""experimenting"" with different takes on southern cooking but being from Kentucky maybe I'm just a bit biased on what I consider ""good"" chicken.Brunch items were a little better but again...not for the price. If you want to be around ""trendy"" peeps who think they know good food... Do it!I would be happier with a Popeye's or even a Harold's run any day..."
"This is our current favorite restaurant in the city for Southern comfort food that's family-friendly with a beautiful outdoor eating area. The location has easy parking, and usually not a long wait  if it's nice out. The chicken is crispy, and the honey butter just adds this great dimension. We love the roasted garlic grits, and mac n cheese and kale slaw are delicious too. The chicken and french toast for brunch is always a great option, but we typically stick with the 4-piece to share because eating it on it's own is so good. The kids meal is a great value and my 2yo loves it. Love the ginger ale."
"Overpriced, small portion, not memorable.My friend made a big deal about this place, coming from the South, I was dying to find a good soul food place. This is no different than the Real Urban Barbeque place by me in Vernon Hills. Except it's chicken and not pork. Ordered the chicken with grits brunch and I DID NOT know it was all going to come smashed up in one bowl. There were no chicken but small cut up pieces that were all diced up. The grits had hot sauce on it, which ruined it all. The only good part was the scallion and egg. The grits were not creamy and did not taste right. All that for $10.99, very small portion, did not feel satisfied. I had one of my friend's corn bread muffin, the muffin on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best, is 5 without the honey butter, with the honey butter, it became an 8.2 pieces of chicken for $5.99. DanggggMac and cheese side $3.99. Mashed potato around that same price.You order and then you sit down, they bring out your food. There is no server. Tip is optional. You go get your own water.When we were placing our order at the register, a guy told another coworker, once the line clears out, someone else walks in. True.The best part about this place is the ambiance. Pretty urban and clean. Nothing special. I am about to give up on my soul food search in the Windy city."
"I've heard great things about Honey Butter Fried Chicken so I decided to make the trek from downtown to check this place out with my friend. We went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was pretty packed, but the line to order your food went pretty fast. When I went to order my food I was informed that they were out of the chicken sandwich so I had to pick a new dish on the spot (which caused a mild panic attack since I had a line of hungry chicken lovers behind me waiting). Overall, I thought the food was good (I sampled my friend's meal), but it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Also, I found it a little weird that when paying (via an iPad which is pretty nice), that I was asked how much tip I wanted to give. Seeing how I was only ordering my food I didn't understand why I was being asked to give a tip or what tip to give for service I had yet to receive.Food:I had the Reuben Melt (Fried Chicken, Cheddar Cheese, Sauerkraut, Caramelized Onions, Thousand Island Dressing, Pumpernickel Bun) - this sandwich was good and messy. The sandwich was good, but didn't have my mouth dancing for joy.My friend got the friend chicken and French Toast (Challah French Toast, Fried Chicken, Bourbon Maple Syrup and Honey Butter) - which again was good, but didn't knock my socks off."
"I ordered chicken to go and when I got home, no honey butter. I called and told the girl who answered the phone that they forgot to include the honey butter in my to go order and her response ""What do you want me to do?"" Just include the honey butter....duh. She also promised a gift certificate, but too cheap to keep her promise. With the price they charge on their average fried chicken, I couldn't believe it."
Very nice atmosphere. The food selection was great! The staff was very friendly and polite. I'm a fan of the grits but the chicken is extremely tasty as well. The chicken was not greasy at all. Try it!
"Everything was great about this place except the seating area.....I didn't find it too cozy and was a little loud to even converse with a  friend.  The staff is really nice, their muffins with honey butter will have you begging for more, the chicken is good....you can really taste freshness and the quality of the chicken will separate it from the rest....i also really enjoyed their beverage variety. Great parking. Good food. Would come back for more, but maybe take out this time."
"We took our family from out of town to HBFC for the 4th of July. They were really confused why were coming all the way from Oak Park, first on a train then on a bus, then a quarter mile to have chicken. We told them it would be worth the effort!And it was! This is the perfect place for summer meal! I personally love the Original Chicken Sandwich, and the smashed schmaltz potatoes are A MAZE ING! My Mom especially loved the bees and honeycombs on the cornbread. Everyone (all 11 of us) at everything! My brother took advantage of the $1.50 shot add-on to his beer.The staff is friendly, the place is clean, it doesn't take long to get your order, AND they have an awesome outside patio.We are going to make this a 4th of July tradition, but I also might go every week this summer too ;)"
"There is a lot of buzz about this place and deservedly so.  The food and chicken is fantastic.  Mac and cheese so good.  They also have multiple varieites of chicken sandwiches and you cant go wrong with any of them..They have cocktails, and cocktail specials all ive tried have been great. They serve em in clear plastic cups. And to be honest i dig that. Its not too uppity. They also have green river on tap. Awesome.Outdoor patio is sick. Especially on a nice summer day/evening. You cant go wrong.  Why four stars?  Because its pretty expensive for a mac and cheese and chicken sandwich with some sodas.  For two people be ready to spend about 30 bucks or more.  Also, i went right when it opened and the chicken didnt seem as moist and fresh as previous visitsCheck this place out."
"Finally made it to honey butter for lunch while my oldest daughter was on a short break from school.  We had planned on visiting another chicken joint by wrigley but decided to try Honey butter and it was really good.  She got the HB sandwich and I had the 4 piece and we split the shmashed potatoes and Mac N Cheese.  The shmashed potatoes were really really good along with the mac n cheese.  I would definitely do the shmashed again of the mac though.  The 4 piece includes 3 boneless chicken breasts on the small side and a drumstick.  The chicken was cooked perfectly along with the chicken sandwich.  We liked the biscuits but they seemed a little bit crunchy.  We had lemonade which was really sour.  I would of given it 5 stars but it was $40.  That's really expensive for 4 pieces of chicken, a chicken sandwich, 2 sides and 2 lemonades.  The patio is great"
"Terrific service. Really thoughtful. We were very impressed that they are a nut-free facility (apparently bc of some allergies among the staff) so it was easy to accommodate our child with allergies. But more importantly, the food was terrific. Kids loved the chicken w butter. They were less crazy about Mac n cheese w pimentos but loved the mashed potatoes and slaw. Adults loved the food and cocktails. Really charming and community oriented place with a great vibe. I can't stress enough the quality of the food and the kindness of the service. Really great experience."
Everything is a la carte.  Very good and fantastic seating area outside.
"I put honey butter on everything, feeling like an Asian male Paula Deen. The chicken, the corn bread, everything. I looked around for something else to put honey butter on and stopped at the HFCS-free soda-pop. I loved almost everything about this place, granted we got there ""at the perfect time"" before the long brunch lines started forming. It's a friendly environment, and also good for kids. The chicken and waffles were amazing. There's nothing more I can say that hasn't already been said. One of the highlights of this place I have to say is that almost every ounce of every ingredient can be traced back to the source. They even mapped their local suppliers on a poster on the wall. The chicken is ethically raised, free range, which takes away a lot of the guilt of eating fried chicken for breakfast."
Awesome !!! The food here was great - the atmosphere was also great and the menus was fantastic . Make sure to put the butter on the chicken  and eat or at least try ALL the sides . I did notice a lot of SOLD OUT signs next to many items on the menu. BTW- the wings are also amazing !!!! Enjoy!
"I don't understand why everybody thinks you should spread butter, or even honey butter, on fried chicken.  Fried chicken is already delicious and bad for you, to such an extent that even butter can't improve it.  I think we have a new figure of speech to replace gilding gold and painting the lily.Also, the fact that your name is Honey Butter Fried Chicken should not operate as a license to make all the food to sweet.  The corn muffin, the honey butter, and the disturbingly sweet and creamy kale/cabbage slaw, no thank you. The fried chicken itself is really delicious, some of the other sides were good too.  But as I said, fried chicken is an inherently delicious food.  So I'm not sure why this place is supposed to be the revelatory temple of fried chicken.  I'm not saying it's bad; it's really quite good; it's just that given the menu and the hype, I would expect them to be able to do more."
"So you fry chicken and then you slather it in butter, but not just any butter.  Butter kissed with the sweetest of honey.  Sign me up.  Popped by for a two piece and grabbed some pimento mac and cheese to go with it.  The chicken was perfectly cooked crisp and didn't wilt under the butter.  If you want veggies, they had some greens, but I am an adult and I don't need to eat my vegetables with every meal.  More room for chicken and cornbread.  They also have a good list of cans and bottles if you want to make it even more adult.  Not everyone will be able to handle hot fried chicken mania sweeping the nation.  For those that can't handle the spice, maybe you can handle this sugar."
"As of now, Honey Butter Fried Chicken tops my list of places to come for a good fried chicken dinner, and that's saying something.I started my meal with the Avondale Ginger Mule- it was tasty and had a good kick to it (due to the Death's Door Gin, I'm told).Seriously though- this chicken was awesome. I bought a four piece with a side of roasted garlic grits. The chicken breading was flavorful without being salty, it had a good crunch to it, and they fry their white meat perfectly- some places overcook it and it ends up dry, but it was as juicy and flavorful as I've ever experienced. The corn muffins were good and had a nice crunch that reminds me of a Belgian waffle. The roasted garlic grits were creamy and had a nice taste, but they reminded me more of a ""cream of"" soup- there wasn't enough of the grainy consistency that I've become accustomed to when eating grits, but to each his own.The friendly servers and the backyard patio only solidify the fact that I'll be returning throughout the summer."
"Yo this place is 100% legit. All these weirdos leaving non 5-star reviews are morons. Honey Butter Fried Chicken uses great ingredients, has delicious (and I mean DELICIOUS food), and the staff is great. Go check it out for your self--you'll be happy you did."
"So I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken so when my brother suggested we go here I kept offering up other places to go and offering to pay for his dinner, pretty much promising him the world so we didn't have to get fried chicken for dinner.... It didn't work and he was adamant so I just sucked it up and went with him to try it out.It was a Saturday night and we only waited about 15 min in line so that wasn't too bad. Our bill for 3 came to $60 which is a bit steep for fried chicken. They had spicy ginger goose island in their soda machine which is one of my favorites so I was excited about that. After about 10 min our chicken comes. The person who delivers our food tells us to make sure to put the butter on the fried chicken and so I did and took a bite not expecting much. OMG the chicken was delicious. I dropped it on my plate and yelled out ""holy sh!t this is good!"" It was juicy and moist and the flavor was amazing. I mean it's definitely not the healthiest thing in the world but it's one of those fatty things that is sooo worth it. The sides were decent didn't really stand up next to the chicken. Anyhow I've changed my mind and now enjoy fried chicken... But only if it's from here :)"
Came here Wednesday evening for dinner. Had the buffalo chicken sandwich - it was amazing! Every bite was delish. We also had the kids Mac and cheese and the 2 piece chicken combo. Surprised that for a week day it was busy.
"Late night craving for fried chicken at the spur of the moment brought my fiancé and I to Honey Butter and we're glad it did! Being jerks, we strolled in 20 minutes before closing but we were greeted so nicely that we returned the favor and opted for take out although they were more than happy to allow us to dine in.  We ordered the 4 piece meal with pimento mac and cheese and corn muffins also an order or wings honey spiced.    The chicken even so late In the evening was perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly, juicy and had great fresh flavor.  The corn muffins were headed to the stale side but I think that was only because it was close to closing time so that's our fault.  The namesake honey butter was fantastic! So many other thing I want to try and we will definitely be back again soon!"
"After reading the reviews I was totally underwhelmed after eating here.I must admit the fried chicken is very crispy and tasty but seriously over-priced. $15 dollars for 4 tiny pieces of chicken and 3 miniature cornbread that were a bit on the dry side. Since the dinner was not filling, I decided to order some chicken wings. BAD MISTAKE! How can a chicken joint serve day old chicken wings that were dry and unfresh. Their fried chicken was so fresh! I only tried one side dish, the creamed corn and it was just okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."
"People have to be crazy to give just 3.5 stars on average to this wonderful place. Arguably the best fried chicken place in the country -in my opinion the runner-up is also in Chicago, crisp.So, when you come here, you can have 2 or 4 (up to 6) pieces of fried chicken with delicious corn bread and the wonderfully gooey honey butter. (I generally prefer to have 3 boneless pieces, which are everything but the wings which i absolutely can not tolerate.) They also give you sauces which are so delicious. It requires an additional charge though and makes the hole thing questionably pricey, i wish the sauces were more reasonably priced.The sides, especially the greens and the mac and cheese are wonderful. You may opt for the potatoes if you want something in the middle.Honey Butter Fried chicken has some tuesday events as well, which is the fried chicken and fried rice combo. That was overrated in my opinion and the fried rice seemed more like a steamed one and it was absolutely insipid -probably making it healthier but still, who cares about that as long as it tastes like rubber.On the weekends -especially sunday, for brunch you can opt for the chicken and grits which is again a hearth dish and delicious.The place also offers good beer and has a wonderful patio."
"The Mac n cheese is to die for. Ironically, my fiancé FELT like he was going to die from the terrible food poisoning he got from his chicken sandwich topped with sour blue cheese. My sandwich was just okay and we didn't care for the weird gravy on the mashed potatoes or the too sweet to drink sugar cane soda. Save your money: go to Popeyes."
I went at an off peak hour for lunch and had two piece chicken with two sides... Kale and cabbage slaw and pimento Mac n cheese.. Loved everything! The mix of flavors was awesome and the honey butter made my chicken! My only small grip was that is was pricey with the sides being a la carte but would totally go back!
"HBFC is my favorite fried chicken in all of Chicago and perhaps the universe. The breading is like beautiful, edible wrapping paper, and the moist, perfectly-seasoned chicken tastes like the best Christmas gift you ever received. I even ordered their catering over the holidays so that I could give the gift of HBFC to my entire family. I saved Christmas that year.They have awesome wings and pimento Mac n cheese. Their corn bread rocks. Brunch? Only been once, but it ruled and I will be back soon. They even have a fountain machine pouring a variety of Goose Island craft sodas, with free refills. Plus, the employees are super-friendly and helpful. Slather some honey butter on your bird, wash it down with a handcrafted michelada and pat yourself on the back for supporting a local business that takes pride in sourcing all of their food from local, sustainable distributors. Honey Butter Fried Chicken has earned a spot on my permanent short list of go-to food joints in Chicago."
"First time there today, and honesty I couldn't be any happier with the food. Just phenomenal. I might just go back for dinner. Super flavorful, you can tell the ingredients are true to their word. I will def be coming back more often, of course with a nice gym session following right after. Scared to ask for the calories  Try the simple honey butter chicken sandwich with a side of honey buffalo sauce, sinful."
"I would give this place 10 stars if I could.  The chicken is so crispy  and crunchy on the outside, fresh and tender on the inside. Probably the best I've ever had.Chicken and Grits, Mac and cheese and the corn muffins are my go to's .Service is ALWAYS consistent and friendlyMy only gripe is that they are closed on my days off."
Guilty pleasure. This is my go-to place when I'm hungover and I'm not feeling a greasy pizza. Slathering as much honey butter I can on their amazing chicken is the best.-1 star for price. It can get pretty pricey. Can't wait until it warms up to try out their patio.
"Honey Butter Fried Chicken was a decent restaurant. The atmosphere was great, I thought the lighting in the back could be a little brighter. Very cozy. Also, the service extremely friendly and I enjoyed it. The honey butter fried chicken was excellent. Although we ordered 3 sides, creamed corn, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes and gravy, all were good, but thought they could be better. Overall great experience."
"This place is amazing. After just moving to the city, this cozy little restaurant is a short 5 minute walk which will be dangerous. I got the honey butter chicken sandwich and it was to die for. Tons of honey butter on the chicken with a bun to help soak it up. I also got a side of mashed potatoes and a corn bread biscuit and a diet coke can. It was only 12$ for all of it. People complain that it's expensive but it's reasonable to me. The chicken was so tasty and mashed potatoes were amazing. My friends also had other things and loved them. We will be back!"
Damned good chicken. Perfectly brined. Crispy. And topped with honey butter!!!!!!!!Genius Real sugar soda fountain. I ALWAYS enjoy the food and atmosphere here!
"The motto, at least until October 4th, for HBFC should be, ""Come enjoy some food while your friends wait at Hot Doug's!""After a recent visit to Hot Doug's and about four hours or so into waiting amid the notorious line, we started to get hungry. Not that hungry where you're driving and think you may need something, but that hunger where if you don't eat now, someone may get hurt. Not wishing to harm fellow patrons, my wife and I headed down for Honey Butter Fried Chicken after the group in front of us procured some while the rest of our family waited in line. Offering a substantially shorted line -- about 15 minutes or so instead of the 8 hours we eventually waited at Hot Doug's -- we were able to get inside and get a lay of the land. While it's a bit on the smaller side, it does have an area out back with benches for those who like a bit of sunshine and fresh air to go with their good ol' home cooking.And that's exactly what Honey Butter Fried Chicken is all about.It's contemporary home cooking the likes of which we'd never seen. Comfort food that mom, grandma or great-grandma would struggle to match, but would be welcome to try. We ordered a four-piece meal, complete with corn rolls to match along with a serving of the daily pickle. Trekking back in the temperate air, the smell of chicken reached up and tugged at my nose repeatedly like an infant demanding my attention. The smell was heavenly, downright intoxicating. Perhaps it was the hunger of waiting in line, yet I'd like to think it was going to be just that good. When we finally got back, divvying up the pieces among the four of us, that first bite dipped in the honey butter was the kind of thing people should write poems about. The sweet buttery delight of it all was unmatched by any of the garbage I'd had yet at the likes of KFC or any other chicken place that saw fit to call itself an eatery -- this is how chicken should be served. The corn muffins broke apart under the sheer stress of being moved through the thick butter. Smearing it haplessly seemed to be the only viable means. It didn't matter though, we were famished and those corn muffins falling to pieces with each satisfying bite in the wake of the chicken was just great. I couldn't help but be a bit overjoyed, if not slightly greedy, when my wife offered half of her corn muffin to me. No...please...well, okay. I guess I'll eat it.Would I go back to HBFC? In a heartbeat, though that heartbeat may suffer a bit from all the fat, the honey butter will keep my veins appropriately greased up for a few more bites of chicken. If this is what I've been missing, I can't imagine going back to a chain chicken place and ever having the same level of enjoyment again. Safe to say, I've been spoiled and there's no going back."
Read some reviews and wanted to give it a try. Did not have a lot of time on my visit - so it was lunch only.I had the honey buffalo chicken sandwich - very tasty with a bit of a buffalo kick to it and the blue cheese is a nice compliment to round everything out. The creamed corn with green Thai curry was actually very good.There plenty of good craft beers available as well.I will certainly visit again the next time I am in the area so I may explore more of the menu - all in all pretty good.
"I've been to Honey Butter Fried Chicken a few times now and they just keep me coming back. I tried them way back when before they had a store at Dose Market and fell in love instantly. They have some pretty darn good chicken but when you dip it in their butter, that's what pushes this joint up a notch.Every time I've gone in, the service has just been impeccable. You order your food up at the cash register with a friendly worker and they then bring it to your table when it's ready. My favorite time to go is lunch because I love a bargain! From 11am-2pm each day they serve lunch specials - $10 will get you 2 pieces of chicken or a chicken sandwich, a drink and a side of your choice. Important to note that they close from 2-5! I always forget and get burned while they're closed and the craving hits me. Memory of a goldfish is what I got.I personally am not big on their side dishes. I've tried the pimento mac & cheese and I love me some mac & cheese, but not so much pimentos. Others seem to love their mac & cheese though so give it a go if you think you'll be into it. Also had a couple of other sides I wasn't in love with. The corn muffins are friggin delish though! I still have a few more sides to try so jury is still out. Really though, it's all about the kluck here. I usually get the 2 piece meal which comes with their signature honey butter & a corn muffin for $8. I don't know why the chicken has no bones but I hate eating bone-in meat with a passion so I'm down with it. The leg still has bones but 1 for 2 ain't bad. The chicken is always moist and their skin is full of seasonings, nicely deep fried. What makes the chicken is the honey butter. What's better than a deep fried meal? Dipping it in a huge gob of fermented cream, of course! Seriously this stuff is addicting and will leave you looking for spare change to pony up the $1 for an additional tub of honey butter.Also really good is their grits & chicken....Love their chicken nuggets...nomz!  To top it all off, they have sweet local pop choices on fountain tap that aren't the norm like green river, non-Fanta orange, black cherry & ginger pop. Free refills!I can't deny, I love Honey Butter Fried Chicken! Here's hoping they add some new side dishes and then I think they will be money! Even if they don't though, that sure as heck won't stop me from coming here on the regular."
"Hands down, one of the best meals I've had since moving to Chicago. I'm from the south, so I know when I'm eating good comfort food, and this place is right up my alley. I came for brunch (weekends, 11-2) and tried the honey butter fried chicken sandwich on biscuit instead. Paired with the garlic grits, kale and cabbage slaw, sweet potato salad, and pimento Mac n cheese. Amazing meal. Absolutely amazing! The grits, corn muffins, and fried chicken were some of my favorites, but literally everything I tasted was excellent. Wonderful ambience, and incredibly helpful staff. I absolutely cannot wait to come back to try some more! I highly highly recommend this place!"
I absolutely love the chicken here!  And when you apply the honey butter onto the chicken or dip your chicken into the honey butter....words can not explain the happiness!!!!!  The mac and cheese side dish my favorite too.Honey Butter Fried Chicken is a must try for fried chicken lovers!!
"On Saturday it was seventy degrees for the first time since the beginning of October. That's almost a full six months. The energy in the city was wild. The next day a low pressure system brought the temperature back down. On a rainy Sunday, my girlfriend and I went to the late afternoon showtime for Noah, directed by Darren Aronofsky. I had listened to the podcast On Point with Tom Ashbrook about the meaning of the Great Flood, and hadn't stopped thinking about it since. I can stop thinking about it now: we should of gone to see the Grand Hotel Budapest per the recommendation of my aunt.After the movie, girlfriend recommended we pick up Honey Butter Fried Chicken: we had both heard good things. It's funny, the Chicago food critics who decry the saturation of new chicken restaurants. Newsflash: people like to eat chicken. And I don't mind paying more, say high twenties for 8 pieces, because I know Honey Butter Fried Chicken is getting well-treated chickens. I want my chickens happy alive, delicious after death, and Honey Butter does that. I thought the drumstick would be the main event, but the juicy thigh stole the show with its bonelessness.The sides were good too. I really like the spicy mac and cheese (spiral noodles). The schmaltzy (chicken fat) mashed potatoes were sickeningly schmaltzy, in a good way. The kale slaw cut the schmaltz back. Still, I could handle at most 2 chicken pieces in a serving. I also ate Honey Butter's salty cookie and brownie: I love the salt with the sweet, so I was a big fan. That night they were out of dump cake. This is rich food, even before the honey butter goes on. And it goes on."
"(2.5 Stars)Eating here could have been a much better experience for us were it not for a few missteps by HBFC, most of which were unrelated to its food, which was by and large very good.The chicken was succulent and flavorful though somewhat lacking in crispiness. Putting it over the top was the restaurant's namesake honey butter. It was so good that I forgot how much I was actually putting on the chicken. The biscuits were good but slightly dry. But hey, that's not something a little more of that honey butter can't fix!As for the sides, I highly recommend the Creamed Corn with Thai Green Curry, which my girlfriend wisely ordered. You get a really nice combination of the sweet corn with the aromatic green curry. We also ordered the Pimento Mac and Cheese and the gumbo as part of the ""choose any three sides"" order (which will net you two free corn muffins, but the online menu now says only one). The mac and cheese was good but did not stand out; the gumbo was certainly better. Finally, we ordered the Chicken and Grits, which was really good in the first few bites but got somewhat overwhelmed by the Tabasco as you progressed through the dish. Overall, though, it was still a solid offering by HBFC. Unfortunately, I have to echo what some reviewers have posted about the odd tip prompt when you place your order. Yes, it is absolutely vital to tip your server well, but does that apply when there are no servers? I understand that it might be similar to ordering at a self-serve counter and getting a credit card receipt which includes a tip line. However, the crucial difference at HBFC is that there is a large visual prompt. Couple that with the line getting longer behind you, and you could easily get pressured into leaving a tip (especially if it's your first time seeing the prompt) without ever having received any food service, which you will later find to be non-existent anyways.  (However, in case you forget to leave a tip, HBFC gives you an additional opportunity to drop one in its tip jar.)The limited service we received, which again is because this is largely a self-serve restaurant, was not poor, but it was also inconsistent and a little impersonal. The cashier did not seem happy to be taking orders that day. I also requested a takeout box from one of the runners, who told me that he'd be back. He never came back. It took us a while to track down a more engaged runner who was able to get us what we needed. This place is also pricey. I understand that it's in the ballpark of what's to be expected given the location, but objectively, it's a bit much for fried chicken, even when it's elevated.  HBFC is definitely worth a trip, but I'm afraid it's overhyped.  Hopefully we'll have a better experience the next time we visit."
"Came here during brunch and had one of tastiest pieces of chicken I've had in a while. Fried chicken with honey butter was a little on the sweet side but juicy, tender, and packs great flavor. I ordered the chicken and French toast and beware that portions are on the smaller side. But the taste was on point. The reason I don't give it 4 stars are because I was craving more food and think you should get more chicken in the meal. I had one piece of chicken and 3 pieces of toast. It's a tiny place and seating is very crowded. Don't plan on coming if you have more than 3 in your group. It took 15-20 minutes to seat 2 people. Parking isn't bad for street parking and the menu looks pretty appetizing.  The ambiance is sheik and trendy but uncomfortable to sit and eat. Definitely coming back here to sample the menu but will need to order a lot more food."
"Great fried chicken, love their heavy use of pepper (on everything).Now for the buts....1. Paprika brownie .... Horrible, tasted like a smokey ash tray ( I love spicy & smoke meats every weekend ) ... But take a giant pass on this thing. 2. Mac n cheese . Was reeeeeally creamy and I believe a hint of jalapeño .  Too cheesy for the kids , but I liked it ( still not enough to top Chuck's Kerry Simeon's though).3. A bit pricey,   $28 for 8 smallish pieces, I get it, all natural organic chicken that is fed beer and massaged blah blah blah..   It is really good but don't need to rush back. If someone I am with wants to go there I would go back , but definitely won't seek it out and go out of my way. Don't get me wrong it's good and would have given more stars had I not dropped $50 on take out  meal for me and my wife."
"I appreciate a place that uses local vendors and farms to produce their product. I especially like that they have a map of several Midwestern states on the wall that provide their ingredients. OK, food time. I ordered the 4-piece with a side of sweet potato salad. I got three boneless breasts and a drumstick. As the server advised, I spread the honey butter on the chicken. I added a little bit of their hot sauce (I have no idea what it was, the bottle was unlabeled) and the sauce is what took the chicken over the top. The meat was pretty juice, the skin was crispy, and I liked that it had a little sprinkling of spicy rub on top. Really good fried chicken.The sweet potato was chopped into small squares, served cold, and topped with a cilantro-lime vinaigrette. Pretty good side dish. I'm a huge corn muffin fan, but they are at their best when served warm. These were room temperature and even the honey butter wasn't going to help that. Decent, but could be better. The cinnamon-apple dump cake with French vanilla whipped cream was really good. Hot and it had a nice streusel. They had two iced teas and I went with the lemon berry. I was a little confused when I didn't see sugar. Instead, they had tap bottles of simple syrup and blue agave. I appreciate the bottomless refills as well as the water pitchers.$28 for the whole thing is a decent buy, especially with no tip. The guy at the counter was incredibly friendly too. Not perfect, but a very good place to visit and worth returning to."
"I heard amazing things about this place and was expecting nothing short of greatness. It was my birthday, I had the day off, so the hubby and I decided to finally give this place a try. We decided to go at lunch, in the hopes of a shorter line.The short wait time was achieved, but at the expense of being unable to have all the sides we wanted. We were told there were no mashed potatoes. Did we just get there too early?We ordered the 4 piece chicken, the mac and cheese, the grits, and the slaw to go. When we opened up our box, we saw we received 5 pieces of chicken. Score!I had a rough time with the concept. Take some extremely fried chicken and then smear honey butter all over to eat it. Holy cholesterol, Batman! I have no doubt that the sheer amount of oil and butter is why I felt sick later in the day, but perhaps my stomach just isn't used to it.The chicken did taste good, and I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of chicken bones. I ate one piece of chicken quickly, then turned to the sides. The mac and cheese was worth it. I enjoyed the kick. The grits were rather bland, in my opinion, but still OK. The slaw fell flat to me though. I think the pomegranate was just a bit too bitter and there was a tad too much dressing. As for the corn muffins, while adorably cute with their honeycomb and bee shape, they were not anything special. They did taste a lot better with the addition of, you guessed it, more honey butter.I fear this place was over-hyped, and that's why I felt a little let down. Don't get me wrong, the chicken is good, and I really liked the mac and cheese, but overall, I felt like the food isn't as great as I expected. At $15 for 4 pieces of chicken, I did expect more."
"Oh my god....this place is AMAZING. I haven't been this impressed with a restaurant in a long time. I'm HOOKED. The chicken is.....You know what, just go. I don't want to ruin the surprise. Fantastic. Btw real sugar fountain sodas. =O"
"Honey Butter Fried Chicken could inspire world peace. The chicken, the honey butter - all of it. Amazing. We went on a rainy cold day, that involved two trains, a 10 minute walk, and fried chicken that I will never forget. The trip was worth it. We were nervous at first because the line was almost out the door- however they have a good system to keep tables open (and crack down on people who tried to save tables who had not ordered), however when you're eating - you don't feel rushed. We wound up eating at the back bar and the bartenders were a delight, they were knowledgable about the foods and the products and made recommendations to us about adding hot sauce, using the honey butter. When I got to the register to order the gentleman who took my order saw me having a crisis in deciding which sides to order (it's really hard)- I was torn between the kale cole slaw and the creamed corn- in addition to my mac n cheese. I ended up ordering the corn and when he slid my card he said he'd added the kale in ""on him"". If that's not amazing I'm not sure what is. There is something on the menu for everyone. The main draw however the chicken. Use every last drop of that honey butter. IT IS WORTH THE TRIP FOLKS."
"I love food. More than that I LOVE fried chicken. I got the 4 piece and it came with a drumstick, a thigh and 2 boneless breasts. Before coming to HBFC I was apprehensive because I didn't want the chicken to be very crispy on the outside and underdone inside. It was just that. The boneless breasts were perfect but it's really hard to mess up white meat. The leg and thigh were kind of wet on the inside and some may mistake that for juicy. Juicy means I can bite clean through but it's not dry. They just need to perfect the art of cooking dark meat longer. The saving grace were the sides - I had the schmaltz mashed potatoes (SO GOOD!) and my friend had the pimento mac n' cheese and the greens. The greens were a little tough and under seasoned though. Oh and the sodas! I couldn't get enough of them. The honey butter and bread were divine. I'm salivating just thinking about it. I think I will go back and get a chicken sandwich (cuz it's breast meat) and sides and pop. But for my first time there expecting epic and perfectly fried chicken I was underwhelmed."
"So let me just say I REALLY wanted to love this place. Sadly for both my friend & I we left feeling just 'Meh' about it. Now being a Southerner I take my fried chicken (really any fried food) seriously. To me great fried chicken needs to be juicy with a great crispy skin. I came here after reading reviews thinking maybe I'd find my Chicago haven for some good fried chicken. Nope - that wasn't today. We got the 4 piece and 3 sides: smashed potatoes, pimento Mac & cheese and the kale slaw. As for the sides the potatoes were fine just kinda boring. The pimento Mac & cheese had a little kick to it but was a bit dry. Maybe it could stand to go without the crumbs on top. The slaw was decent. The pomegranate seeds were a unique twist. Now for the main attraction...the chicken. While it was juicy it's the coating/crust that failed to deliver. The flour was definitely seasoned and a little heavy handed for my taste. We thought it might have some garlic in it while we eating it. Hours later I'm even more convinced as I can taste the garlic when I burp. Really attractive....I know! But it was the fact that the skin just wasn't as crispy as I wanted. The coating could have been a little heaver to give it a really great crunch after it'd been fried. So my quest to find good fried chicken in the city continues. Until then I just have the fond memories of grandma's chicken to keep my fried chicken love alive!"
"Ok so it's so-so. The first bite I thought OVERPRICED KFC crispy. Not a place I would rave about.  I think it would be great after a long nite of bar hopping. You can taste the butter, I just wanted it to be so much more. I will not be lazy anymore. I'll be cooking my own!"
"The chicken they are cooking up here is really something worth writing about. Their blend for the batter I believe includes paprika but that is not the important part. The important part is the honey butter. Unlike other places, which may focus on the spice of the chicken, the honey butter really brings all the flavors together and makes a unique experience.The corn muffins are also a great alternative to the typical biscuit. I haven't had any of the sides otherwise.Prices here are fine. I think they are about on par with The Roost but it certainly will not be as cheap as a Harold's.Make sure to get some great beer or great wine! The wine here is especially good."
"Such good, tasty food. The pimento mac and cheese was amazing. The portions are small compared to usual American portions. But because they are ""small"" you can try many of the items. The bar has some great cocktails and my beer drinking friends love the choices of beer."
"Either this place was really, really good when it first opened and just fell off.  Or I'm not getting the hype surrounding this place.  The honey butter sauce is great.  So I definitely get the hype behind the sauce.  But I wasn't impressed with anything else there.  I ordered the 4 piece chicken dinner and 3 of my pieces were overcooked and one was undercooked.  It was clear that they didn't come out the same batch.  The 3 overcooked pieces DESPERATELY needed the honey butter sauce.  And I couldn't even eat the undercooked one (I also didn't notice it was that badly undercooked until I got home).  The mashed potatoes and corn muffin were okay but again, nothing spectacular.  Never a good thing when the sides are better than the meal especially basic sides like mashed potatoes and corn muffins.It's ridiculously overpriced.  $20 bucks for 4 pc chicken, mashed potatoes and corn muffin?  Gimme a break.   I've seen some fellow Yelpers who I respect give this place positive ratings so I'm more inclined to give it another chance and just hope this was a bad experience.  But as things stand right now, this may have ranked as one of the most disappointing dinner experiences I've had."
"The food is tasty. I'd rather go here than any other chicken shack. I always feel a bit guilty afterwards though because its definitely indulging a bit in greasy ""junk food"". It's weird that this place is always crowded and with a lot of families and young kids. I have a theory that people feel healthier eating junk food here just because its more thoughtfully sourced.The staff are nice, and the atmosphere chill."
"Came here on Saturday and luckily there was no line. Was in town visiting family and my cousin suggested I watch a couple episodes of Check Please before I arrived. Honey Butter Fried Chicken was definitely #1 on my list after watching.I got the honey butter fried chicken sandwich and absolutely loved it. The buns were perfect and the chicken was lovely. For a side, I got pimento mac n cheese. The pimento flavor was mouthwatering and I could've easily had another order of it. My only small issue, is that the chicken could've been spicy, although there was a bottle of hot sauce on the table, (which I probably should've used, my mistake).I will definitely come back the next time I am in town."
"What a great overall first experience we had at Honey Butter Fried Chicken! I was hesitant to visit on a Saturday night, but going early at 6pm, we did not have a wait for a table, and everything was great. Get ready to order at the registers, and then take your seats. We sat in the main area, which was pleasant, save for a toddler who thought it was funny to yell loudly and test his parents every few seconds. (His parents failed at adjusting this behavior, sadly). There is also a small bar area for seating, and a small but nice patio. I look forward to return visits to enjoy my meal in both of the other areas. Since it was our first visit, the register guy politely explained the ordering process and a few special menu highlights. After ordering, our craft beers were quickly delivered, along with the table setting and a hearty ""welcome y'all"". We ordered:- 2-Piece Fried Chicken - Original Fried Chicken Sandwich (with jalapeno mayo, making it nice and ""warm"").- Sweet Potato Salad w/cilantro and lime vinaigretteThe fried chicken was served crispy, yet tender on the inside. The pieces were slightly small, so if you have a big appetite, bump it up to four. The chicken sandwich was really good, and had a little kick to it. I could definitely see making that a delivery order, because it could travel well. The sweet potato salad was served cold, and was really unique! It was a nice change up in between chicken bites. I got the fried chicken with the honey butter, and that stuff was really good! My dining partner almost ate up all the butter with her sandwich, but good news- they'll allow you to order extra honey butter. What puts Honey Butter Fried Chicken head and shoulders above so many local trendy chicken places (that rhyme with Parson's - oh yes I did!) is the impeccable friendly and respectful service, that is appreciated by a diverse clientele. It's so nice and relaxing to be in a friendly, welcoming environment with excellent food and drink. Honey Butter for the win."
"My girlfriend and I had lunch at Honey Butter this afternoon, and they lived up to the hype.We arrived at about 1:30 this afternoon, and got a little lucky because there was literally no line (a small line formed behind us as we were ordering). We ordered a 4 piece fried chicken (which comes with their signature honey butter and corn bread), the kale and cabbage slaw, and an order of mac and cheese.  Our food was brought out to us in under ten minutes and everything was great from start to finish.  The chicken was of course the star of our lunch, fried so it was crispy but not greasy.  The addition of the honey butter was also a nice variation, and it even worked in symphony with their signature hot sauce as well.  I would definitely come here again, they had a nice drink selection that I would love to try with dinner (or possibly with lunch, had this been a warm spring or summer day).Don't change a thing Honey Butter, you're perfect just the way you are."
"Bottom line: Nice atmosphere and great sides.Time: Late lunch on a beautiful Friday afternoonService: Chill- We were greeted with menus right away.- For first timers: order first, get a number, and then you can pick your seats.Food - Load up on the sides- The chicken wasn't terrible, but they weren't like mouthwatering or amazing either. Its the sides! That is where it's at! - We ordered a 2 piece chicken and a honey buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of Thai curry creamed corn and roasted sweet potato salad. With my chicken order, it came with 2 corn muffins with a side of whipped crack, I mean honey butter. - For me, it was the flavor in the sides that made a lasting impression. The twist on the creamed corn was genius. It wasn't too overpowering or heavy. The salad was light and really balanced out the meal quite nicely. - Ultimately, I would have been just happy coming here just to eat the corn muffin with that honey butter. I think at one point I dunked my chicken into the butter.Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere this place created. The patio seating was perfect for that day. Although I had such a fried chicken craving, this place really didn't hit the spot for it, but I was able to stumble upon other amazing foods."
"The positives: I would give the chicken 4 stars. The breading is delicious, flavorful, crispy, and not overwhelmingly greasy. Also, the pieces are deboned, except for the legs, and the meat is good quality. And the butter... Mmmmm!The negatives: The sides are not much to speak of. The pimento Mac and cheese is good and very unique, but not much to remember. The smashed potatoes and slaw are just so so. The corn bread is tiny and only tasty due to the butter. You order and then sit and the place is small. We waited 5 minutes for a table, but others were waiting longer to even order. Then I felt rushed to leave when we finished. The price is OK. No really great way to get here on public transit. I don't think I'd make the trek again."
"The best way to describe how good this place is? Let's just say it definitely made up for not getting any Hot Doug's thanks to the 7 hour wait line, and then some. Friendly, fast service; chill atmosphere; bottomless make your own iced teas; and unique dishes that go beyond hitting the spot. Love that chicken from Honey Butter!"
"I have tried many times to come to HBFC, they were always closed or the wait was too long. Finally, I went on a relatively slow day and had the fried chicken, kale salad, and cornbread everything was really good! Well worth the wait! The place has a really cool vibe to it, and I like the decorations they had at the time (winter decor in the windows). The only downside is that it was kinda pricey, not like break your wallet pricey, but not come-here-everyday-for-lunch-affordable either. Definitely a must have experience though, dipping your chicken into that honey butter---yummy!!!"
"This is an incredible new restaurant that was born into this world with a cult following. I love the inception story (you should ask one of their employees about it).It's in an unexpected neighborhood. I'd expect such an alternative, trendy hot-spot to be in Logan Square or Andersonville. But whatever. Maybe even Lincoln Park. Not Avondale. Nothing wrong with that neighborhood but it's not trendy. Or close to a train. And who knows. Maybe it's up-and-coming. Since HBFC sets the curve maybe I should trust them that their location choice makes sense.You order at the counter, pay on an iPad, and then wait at a table with a number. There are two dining rooms and an outside seating area. A lot of the seating is communal; however, I've been fortunate enough to snag seats that didn't involve rubbing elbows and making new friends.The service is really very, very good. I'm not sure if my experience was the norm or not. The manager came over and talked to my table each time and gave us free sides to try. I bought cocktails and helped myself to their carbonated beverages.The fried chicken is not normal. Like, there's a certain standard for normal fried chicken and sometimes restaurants try new interpretations of it. Sometimes it's a hit and sometimes it's not. In this case, it's pretty gosh darn good. The chicken is unusually moist and the breading is thick, crispy, and flavorful - even without the honey butter.Now let's discuss that honey butter. You're supposed to slather it on with a butter knife. It definitely adds a welcome dimension to the fried chicken but is also kinda messy. The concept reminds me of dipping Papa John's pizza in their butter garlic sauce: the pizza is enhanced by the sauce.Some of the sides are phenomenal: the corn and the sweet potatoes. Other sides need some work: mac'n'cheese and grits. They also have more than just sides and chicken. I tried the chicken fried rice (okay) and the chicken pot pie (not a fan. I do not call condensed soup with croutons on top a ""pie"").The prices are really kinda crazy. It's obvious that Honey Butter Fried Chicken can get away with their price structure (reference earlier mentioned cult following) but I can get yummy fried chicken for less from other places.In summary, I like Honey Butter Fried Chicken. I think it's a fun spot for an adventure. You know - one of those restaurants you want (and should) try out, but probably won't frequent regularly (unless you live in the neighborhood and don't mind paying an arm and a leg for fried chicken)."
"There's just something that seems so wrong about the concept of slathering honey butter on a piece of crispy fried chicken. Definitely had that little angel on one shoulder saying, 'What are you thinking?? Can you imagine how hard you're going to have to work out if you do this??' Then there was that little devil saying, 'Go ahead, take a bite. You know you want to. Do it!!!!'One bite and I kicked that bitchy little angel out of there! Seriously you could slather that honey butter on a mud pie and proclaim it delightful. On this tasty fried chicken it is ridiculous. Our family just pulled out the stops and devoured! Is it the best fried chicken I've ever had? No, but it's really good and the honey butter certainly elevates it. I was surprised that they serve boneless chicken breasts & thighs. Certainly makes it easier to eat out on the patio, which is a very nice space on a warm Chicago night. The kale and cabbage slaw was really well done and the collard greens were also yummy. We had a lot of leftovers having ordered 4 orders of the 4 piece chicken. Two people could easily be full on a 4 & a 2 piece order. The leftover chicken & honey butter didn't go to waste, though. It was awesome cold and dipped into warmed honey butter. If I have one complaint, it's a bit pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of chicken. Will we do this again? Quite likely, but first we have have to work out a few more times!!"
My mommy makes better Fried Chicken. Sorry Honey butter fried chicken.The flavor was lacking and the price did not match the quality. But the venue was very nice. It is a great place to do brunch. If you are ever in the area you should check it Out!
"Came here tonight after being recommended by a friend. To cut to the chase, here's what I took away from this tucked away bird joint: The chicken with the honey butter on top did not disappoint! The skin is perfection and both breast and wings were extremely savory and moist. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I loved the Pimiento Mac N Cheese. It has a kick to it which I really enjoyed and thought the combo of flavors were dynamite. The kale and cabbage slaw was okay for my taste buds, only because I felt the spices used were a bit much for the wee little dish it comes in. The green chile chicken (the special of the day) was super yummy and filled your soul just right. I wanted to try the cream corn but it was sold out. I'd say that was a bummer, considering how perfect of a match that is to soul type food...I need them to have secret stashes so that this doesn't occur regularly! For those looking to order some fresh lemonade, make sure you are a fan of quenching your thirst with an extra tart beverage as their lemonade was just that. It was still refreshing though. All in all, the food is super tasty and the chicken is awesomeness. It's a super casual place with not a lot of frills. The ambience is perfect for the type of food that is sold and the vibe of a local business they want to promote. I'd say the only downside is that the portions of the sides are quite small for what they charge. I think that if you're looking to fulfill your appetite with variety, the smaller portions might work to your benefit as you could easily order a couple. If you're just trying to have s meal with a side, then just be aware that they're itty bitty compared to most places and the price tag is about the same. When all is said and done, would I come back? You know it! ...the chicken with butter is just comfort food all around, and at the end of the day, we all can use some of that in our lives!"
"First off, I see a lot of people complaining about the price. Maybe these people are used to food from Olive Garden or some other shitty restaurant that sources their food from the lowest bidding factory farm. The fact of the matter is that quality food costs more and the quality of all the food here is nothing short of amazing. And you really have to hand it to them for locally sourcing as much as they possibly can.ANYWAYS, this is hands down the best fried chicken I ever had. Its pretty crunchy and moist at the same time, a hard combination to achieve. The sides are pretty amazing. My favorite is the kale and cabbage slaw. An awesome blend of flavors and it makes you think you're eating something semi healthy. The pimento mac and cheese is awesome, has a nice but moderate bite to it."
"Came here for dinner and the line was out the door! I was worried we wouldn't have a place to sit, but after we ordered the host quickly found us a place to sit. We ordered the fried chicken which made it to my top list of best fried chicken ever. It was perfectly fried and crunchy on the outside, seasoned to perfection, while the inside was juicy and tender. YUM.The corn bread was also so good and I loved the presentation. The honey butter is so delicious that while I tend to not use too much butter, I smeared it on liberally.For sides, we got the pimento mac n cheese which tasted like your normal mac n cheese. Good but nothing exceptional.The kale and cabbage slaw was delicious though! The dressing was tasty.My favorite was the creamed corn. I have never thought of mixing it with thai green curry, but wow! The flavor was amazing!I will be back soon!"
"Finally woke up in time to try this place during brunch! Ordering was fast and the guy was helpful. The food came out at a speedy rate. We barely settled in the patio w/ heaters and the food was out.Chicken and Grit - grit was perfect w pieces of crunchy garlic and buffalo chicken (not fried) topped with green onions. Not super heavy at all.4 piece chicken - I've heard people saying that the chicken meat itself is not seasoned and etc... We had no problem with it. The pieces are not ultra abnormally big so the seasoned skin and honey butter makes it just right. Liked how the pieces are boneless, besides the drumstick of course.Biscuit - great! Moist and a little crunchy because it's just a two bite sizeMac n cheese - cooked perfectly, liked the extra cheese sauce. Don't worry about the Olive if you're not an olive person. I didn't tats it at allBloody Mary - my BF got it and didn't know it was made with tequila and didn't like it much. It was nice experience for us and it looks like summer time they'll even have more seatings in the back. I'll def bring visitors here next time."
"I'm hovering more towards the 3.5 or 3.75 star side but thought I'd round up.Rock star:  chicken, corn muffins, honey butter.  Only reasons to go. Not so rock star:  the sides.  There were three of us and we thought we'd split the sides of mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes with the gravy on the side, assuming by the pricing that they were splittable.  That was a mistake.  The sides are very small and it was tough to split three ways.  Without the gravy (as I'm not a gravy fan) the potatoes were a bit gluey and under seasoned.  The mac -- not so much mac and cheese as pepper pasta.  None of us liked it.Corn muffins were outstanding but five little bite size buggers with the 8 piece chicken order were a horrible tease.  They're so miniscule.  Speaking of the 8 pieces, it was a bit of a frustrating challenge to figure out the breast from the thigh since they were deboned.  Unless there were no thighs in the order, it was confusing and I was not the menu reader/decider.The honey butter, I will dream about that for a long time, it was so good.I'm not sure we'll be back though.  8 piece chicken, two sides, one bottle of wine, one can of cider, one iced tea:  $100.  No joke.  Jaw, floor.  While I get all the ingredients are fancy schmancy and local and whoo-ha and whatever, I'm still confused as to why.  Since it was my birthday dinner, I was hoping to get a piece of cake or pie or something sweet but there were far fewer dessert options available than what was shown on their website.  None appealed to the group so we took off.The bottle of wine was not finished and unfortunately they didn't have the to-go bags so the guy at the front refunded us $10 which was a nice gesture and much appreciated.In the end, and don't get me wrong, the initially mentioned three items were fantastic but value-wise, splitting everything three ways, it didn't feel entirely worth it for us and we didn't leave full."
"Fried chicken, cornbread, and honey butter? Yes please! All and all this place is pretty darn tasty. Great chicken, a variety of unique and yummy sides, homemade sodas (try the green one - it's amazeballs), great beer selection, rustic ambiance, and finally very friendly and prompt service. Best part is the chicken breast bits are deboned! Idky but I didn't expect that and it was a welcome treat in enjoying their chicken! I would suggest ordering a plethora of sides and extra honey butter for the table - they wil be eaten! We ordered one of every side pretty much and loved them all for different reasons. (We were a big group, don't judge our gluttony!)Final Verdict:As our friendly neighborhood Terminator once said: I'll be back!"
"Our friends and us have been craving GREAT fried chicken, ever since our visit to Praline Connection in New Orleans a few years ago. Having seen the ""raving reviews"" about Honey Butter Fried Chicken, we thought we'd give it a try. How disappointing....while the chicken was crispy, it tasted bland. Our server said we should slather the chicken in the included honey butter, which we did.....but it didn't add much, except sweetness. I guess I would think if fried chicken was properly seasoned prior to cooking, it should be able to stand on its own. I will say that some of the sides - especially the corn with green curry was excellent. The Mac and Cheese was nothing special either - good, but not great. Bummer, as we were anticipating more after all the articles and raves by others. Oh well, the quest continues......"
Had the chicken sandwich mashed potatoes and homemade lemonade. Tasty everything was great! Chicken had flavor was crispy yet not over cooked. The bun it was served on was heavenly! The mashed potatoes had chicken gravy which was the only time I have ever eaten gravy from not my mother God rest her soul and was good enough to continue to do so. The lemonade was fresh and not super sweet. The only grip I have is the small portions but I will return to sample the rest of the menu.
"Here's my advice: SKIP the fried chicken.After visits to Smalls, The Roost, and Leghorn over the last few weeks, HBFC doesn't really compete at the level of fried chicken quality that you can find at the alternatives.  The chicken at HBFC is very average, it's served on a pretty average bun, and even my wife called out that the chicken wasn't really that hot or right-out-of-the-fryer fresh when I visited for lunch yesterday just before noon.  And the muffins served on the side were pretty bland also.  (The honey butter, though, was tasty.)What made our visit special?  Every other item I tried.  The mac-and-cheese is worthy, the creamed corn was fantastic, the dump cake yesterday was awesome and the soda fountain flavors were all incredible (tried the black cherry, spicy ginger ale and the grape).  Add in a great patio that isn't crowded at lunch time, and you have something special......until you factor in the prices.  Our order of an original fried chicken sandwich, a two-piece order of chicken (an astounding/ridiculous $8 on its own!!!), and the two sides, dessert and a fountain soda came out to almost $32.  After our A La Card discount, we spent ""only"" $22.  As a friend of mine joked about places like HBFC, this is ""date night fried chicken"" when you factor in these prices.  At The Roost, we got two chicken sandwiches, with fresher chicken, on a fresher biscuit, with four sides and a soda for $20 BEFORE any discounts.  HBFC has better seating, but if I'm just trolling for a good sammich, it's going to be The Roost over HBFC every time.Now that the smoke has cleared, I think the ~350 reviews here are just right, that HBFC is cool but serves average chicken at bloated prices.  Let the Chicago fried chicken frenzy continue!!"
"Omg What a wonderful place to be! The chicken is to die for, sides like garlic gritsHeavenly! Really cool atmosphere and Gavin the bartender is da bomb!!! He's a true craftsmen!!!  4 out of 5 chicken review"
"The chicken is hot That's the best thing I can say about it.  The chicken is expensive 28 dollars for a 8 piece meal with a few buns.  My big problem with the place is the chicken had very little taste to it.   I really expected something special, but when KFC tastes much better is not saying much.  I would never waste the time coming here go to Smoque or kumas or even KFC."
"The pimento Mac and cheese is life altering, earth shatteringly good. And the fried chicken dipped in honey butter, if I could have this in my life it's not worth living at all."
"It puts the butter ON the chicken. ON the chicken?!?! After smearing the delicious creamy honey butter all over the chicken I don't think I can ever go back to non buttered chicken, or bread, or pizza.The chicken here is damned good, and it stays juicy despite most of the cuts having the bones removed. It became phenomenally good when it gets slathered in honey butter.The sides were less exciting. Both the collards and sweet potato salad were not very good. The lemon in the collards made them far too acidic and the sweet potatoes were not roasted nearly enough to make them appetizing. The mac and cheese however was a creamy, tangy, stick to your ribs, cup of heaven.The reason this place doesn't get 4 stars is because of the price. Yes the chicken and other ingredients are local and fresh. But that doesn't justify an over $40 lunch for 2 with 2 beers for a counter service restaurant that nickles and dimes people for a little extra honey butter. At those prices I can't justify the experience or the leftover room in my stomach."
"I really didn't like this place. I got the French toast and fried chicken. The chicken was too dry for my taste. I don't mind a little ""burntness"" to my toast, but I mean my toast came out rock hard. The only part I was able to enjoy was a little small center that wasn't burnt to rocks. Although the bourbon maple syrup they drizzle over them was SO good I just wish I had more French toast to enjoy with it."
"2 thumbs up for Honey Butter Fried Chicken! Here's what we had:AVONDALE GINGER MULE-Molasses, Ginger, Death's Door Gin, Lime, Mint: Delicious drink, will be perfect when their patio opens!2-PIECE CHICKEN with Honey Butter, Corn Muffin: Make sure you put the Honey Butter ON the Fried Chicken! Super tasty, juicy chicken with no bones (except the legs)...delicious!THE ORIGINAL FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH-Fried Chicken, Candied Jalapeño Mayo, Crunchy Slaw, Buttery Bun: LOVE this sandwich! Same juicy fried chicken with a great spicy kick!CHICKEN & GRITS-Roasted Chicken Tenders, Buttery Hot Sauce, Roasted Garlic Grits and Chicken Crust Crunchies: Lots of hot sauce on this dish so if you like hot sauce, you'll love it!PIMENTO MAC'N CHEESE with Garlicky Bread Crumbs, SCHMALTZ SMASHED POTATOES with Chicken Fat Gravy, CREAMED CORN with Thai Green Curry: All 3 of these sides are top notch, but the creamed corn was definitely my favorite! The addition of the green curry was a nice surprise and a great spin on a classic!ROASTED SWEET POTATO SALAD with Cilantro and Lime Vinaigrette: The only thing on the menu I wouldn't order again. The vinaigrette was just off-too much vinegar and not very well balanced."
"After dropping my boyfriend off next door for a gaming tournament at Ignition Gaming, I was excited to finally try HBFC after hearing so many good things.  I ordered a two piece and garlic grits, and went out to the patio to grab a seat.  Food arrived quickly and looking tasty.  Unfortunately, this was about to be the high-point of the visit. Apologies in advance, but by the time I get around to reviewing the grits this review is going HAM.The chicken - it was very bland.  They top it with the salt, pepper, paprika as a finishing touch but the breading doesn't seem to have it mixed in strongly at all.  The initial taste is the dry seasoning, followed by nothingness.  The texture is crispy, not greasy, but it's flavorless.  The chicken itself is juicy but again, no flavor.  Portion-wise, they remove the bone and tender from the breast piece which means not much  chicken for the price.The corn muffins & honey butter - the trademark muffins with bees were the best part of the meal but were also lacking a good corn flavor.  The honey butter tasted a bit margarine-y.  I don't doubt they are using real butter but maybe they are adding in some canola oil to make it more spreadable?  I could taste a non-honey/non-butter element in the mix.  I just had delicious honey butter at Snappy's earlier in the week so the difference in quality felt more obvious than it may have any other time.The garlic grits - whooo boy.  May I just say, don't put grits on your menu unless you can do them properly.  Everyone time I meet someone who wrinkles their nose at grits, it's inevitably because they're only had bad grits.  Shame on putting grits on the menu to play dress up with Southern cooking.  To quote from Patton Oswalt, these grits are a ""failure pile in a sadness bowl"".  Grits should not congeal in the cup as they cool off and crack along the surface.  They should remain smooth, velvety, and creamy from start to finish.  They should not be garnished with fried crispies that become soggy and are bland to boot.  They should not be peppered to the point of not being able to taste anything else after 2 bites.Because the restaurant provides fair wages, employee benefits, uses ethically sourced & sustainable ingredients, etc, I am bumping up to two stars because I feel their business practices should warrant praise.  But seriously, this is some bland chicken being heralded as the second for no reason I can understand and the grits are really bad."
I really was wowed by the quality of the food. My order was specific. I ordered a club chicken sandwich with NO Bread. The 'sandwich had all the ingredients on a tray with the condiments on the side. PERFECT! The attention to detail made my dining experience. The honey butter was very good. I also liked the kale-cabbage slaw. I Will be back!
"great food and great service ! the honey butter chicken burger is a MUST if you visit the restaurant. the honey butter is out of this world. the staff is very friendly ( sarah, gabin, kelly and the other bartender, that i sadly forgot his name, specially) and attentive. highly recommend this restaurant."
"Came here after getting impatient waiting for Hot Doug's. It was a relief from the craziness. It was tasty, but not ALL that. And I love fried chicken!I got the chicken on challah french toast. The chicken was delicious and the butter is worth it for the biscuits!!! But my dish was DRENCHED in syrup. I wish they had served it on the side so I can use as desired. French toast was also on the thin side so the dish got pretty wet.Also as a fried chicken fanatic I didn't like that all the chicken was boned. To me, the meat on the bone is part of the fried chicken experience! Non hard-core fried chicken people may like that aspect :)It's a good place but not worth going out of the way. Also beware the beer list. While they have great options - it is pricey!"
"Ordered an 8 piece fried chicken with a side of mac-n-cheese and kale coleslaw. Everything was great. The chicken. As they say, you have to ""put the butter on the bird"" and it was so good I could cry thinking about now. So sweet and buttery...Slathering butter on your fried chicken...Why didn't I think of that? The coleslaw was good. Mac-n-cheese was sOo good. The drink menu is really appealing. Lots of unique flavors & ingredients that you wouldn't think would blend together. The helpful bartender with a handlebar beard suggested this warm apple cider drink; I don't even know if it's on the menu. It was great. The bar area is a small intimate area that you and a close friend would really enjoy. Come here, eat chicken & mac-n-cheese, and let Mr. Handlebartender make you great drinks.We also had a nice time with the people sitting next to us. We even let them try our coleslaw. Warm, smart, eccentric staff. Don't miss out on this place."
"Good chicken, but way overpriced. A leg and a thigh, plus 2 tiny little biscuits cost me over $10. No side, no beverage."
"Oh man, I waited for a really long time to visit HBFC but now that I've been there, I want to go back all the time. I'm usually not a fried chicken lover. I know that's crazy. I don't really like watermelon, fried chicken, or corn on the cob. It's like I hate summer or something! But really I just hate making a mess with my food. I think it stems back to my braces years. But for my father's birthday last month, I thought it would be really fun to take my parents to HBFC for brunch because they really DO like fried chicken. And I had heard so many good things about the place that I decided there had to be something I'd like. Now, I am a believer. HBFC's chicken was so tender and my chicken and french toast dish was boneless so it made it so much easier to eat! I snarfed up every bite of my brunch and probably could have had a second helping. I also tried my parents' meals. They ordered like an 8-piece or something and the sides were OUT OF THIS WORLD. The creamed corn was probably my favorite with the thai green curry. It was such a cool fusion of traditional and new flavors that I had never thought to pair together before. Even my parents, who don't typically like anything curry, loved the corn. We also had the mashed potatoes which were excellent. The alcoholic beverages were really good as well. I had The Threesome which was like a bloody mary with tequila. It was really spicy but played off well with the sweetness of my meal. The whiskey sour and ginger mule were delicious as well. Can't wait to go back!"
"I'm not even mad that I just spent $32 on lunch. It was that delicious. My guy had the 2-piece fried chicken (with cornbread and honey butter) and I had the original chicken sandwich. We both had strawberry lemonade, which was a-mazing.I got to reading while we were sitting outside, and this place just made me feel even more satisfied. Bottom line, this is a  good company with happy employees, and super awesome food. Yay local businesses!"
"I had been wanting to try this place for quite a while and finally did. Now, despite waiting for a long time, I (smartly? stupidly?) went against the grain and ordered one of their specials - the fried chicken lettuce wrap. It came with their house-made kimchi and one other topping that eludes me now. I had thought it would be the normal fried chicken, but it was their fried chicken cut up and covered with a sweet Asian BBQ sauce. (Kind of like Crisp, in Lakeview.) The flavor was great and I really enjoyed it. Everyone else liked their (regular fried chicken) and the honey butter spread on top made it even better!We shared a bunch of sides: mac and cheese (winner!!), roasted sweet potato salad (very good), creamed corn, garlic grits and schmaltz mashed potatoes. Everything was very tasty. Can't wait to go back and try some of the regular fried chicken myself."
"Same story as many - look forward to trying it and walk away with just a giant MEH :/Definitely overpriced, not terrible but not great either. Typical Chicago overhyped one-timer that probably tastes amazing when supper hung over."
"While visiting my brother in Chicago we wanted to finally try this place after hearing so many good reviews about it.  Well, we were not disappointed with the the food one bit.  The fried chicken is delicious and the sides are good too.  It is pricey for fried chicken but just tell yourself your being trendy it will be alright.  My parents and brother shared an order of 8-PIECE FRIED CHICKEN with Honey Butter, 5 Corn Muffins for $28 (see what I mean by pricey).  I had the BRUNCH SANDWICH Fried Farm Egg, Fried Chicken, Braised Greens with Bacon, Garlic Aioli, Buttery Bunfor $10.  Throw in some drinks and lunch will run you about $60.00 bucks.  If you're on vacation, do it."
"Finally hit this place for lunch. Very, very good fried chicken and sides. My brother and I shared a four-piece meal, the fried chicken sandwich, and a coupla sides. Notes:- Chicken Sandwich: This might've been the star for me. The chicken was perfect, the candied jalapeno mayo was DELICIOUS, and the slaw added a nice crunch (and I'm usually viciously anti-slaw/pro-lettuce, but it really worked here). Just stellar.- Fried Chicken: What can you say? They've got a great recipe, and it was a pleasure to eat. We had a drumstick, two breasts, and a thigh, both the white and dark meat were excellent with a great batter that wasn't coated on too thick (I do not like the gobs of thick fried batter some places go with). Couldn't bring myself to actually butter the chicken, though.- Pimento Mac'n'Cheese: My brother liked this well enough but we both thought it was pretty bog standard mac'n'cheese. I personally don't like pimento at all so I just had a bite and moved on.- Grits'n'cheese: Another pleasant surprise. I don't think I've ever _had_ grits but if this is what they can be, I'll take more. Crumbled cracklins of chicken skin on top gave this a necessary texture.- Mashed Potatoes: Skin-in, with chicken fat gravy. Smooth and tasty.- Butter Crumble Dessert Thingy: So good. Wonderful blend of textures from crunchy cinnamon to warm cake to delicious sauce... a great finish.Bonus Notes:- the little cornbread muffins that come with the orders are out of this world. I _love_ a sweat cornbread, and this is a great recipe. Slather that honey butter on and go to town.- they have a bunch of homemade fountain sodas which are also very tasty. I rarely drink sugared pop but couldn't resist the siren song of some Black Cherry fountain pop and I am glad I gave in.Bonus Bonus Note:- They serve booze; we were just taking a lunch break during work so I passed.They lose one star just because, even though it's very good, it still _is_ just a bit pricey, I think. I've had comparable lunches for less in the city. And the food is juuuust a bit less good than Smalls, which is my current all-around fave chicken lunch with sides.That said, parking was a breeze right on Elston, getting a seat wasn't a problem, service was a bit on the slow side but it's made to order so I get it... can't go wrong for lunch here."
"My husband and I had to check out Honey Butter Fried Chicken to see if it lived up to the hype. And it was ok. Here it goes...The atmosphere and service is great...I loved it! I even love the hand wash sink that is in the sitting area! :) It's a nice touch. Now on to the food...the chicken was good, but nothing special! Although, I did like that the chicken was boneless...a nice surprise. The honey butter is yummy! I tried a bite of the chicken w/o the butter and it didn't do a whole lot for me. Yes, it's moist...but, I was expecting a bit more. I definitely needed the butter to make the chicken taste really good. Maybe the batter for the chicken wasn't mixed properly that day? Or maybe they could just add a little something to it. I guess the point is to smother the chicken w/ the honey butter. The sides were decent. I tried the pimento mac n cheese...it was ok. My husband tried the kale slaw and I think he liked it. They also offer a good amount of beers. Considering the price we paid...I wasn't too thrilled with my food. It was good, but I wasn't wowed. And I want to be wowed when I'm spending $35 on 4 pieces of fried chicken, two small sides, and a beer.  Will I return? I think I'd give it another shot...hopefully something will wow me!"
"I've already reviewed Honey Butter but 4 stars is an injustice. This place is the bomb. I crave it. All the time. If I'm not cooking, I want Honey Butter. Always. The chicken is flavorful and tender and that butter- puh-leeze. It would be good on cardboard."
"This place is WAY TOO PRICEY for the amount of food you actually get. $10.00 sandwiches, that is 65% bun AND doesn't even come with a side. The flavor of the food is good, but not great."
"This place was recommended by some friends and then I read yelp reviews and decided we definitely wanted to dry it. We were not disappointed! Tried the 3 piece chicken and it was delicious especially after adding the butter as recommended. The pimento mac & cheese and cream corn were on point & unique. We will definitely come back for more. We called ahead a take out order & it was still hot & delicious by the time we made it home (only 10 minutes away). My husband said the dining area was small & packed of people (on a Sunday evening) so he was glad we did take out. They gave us some extra biscuits for waiting about 10min longer than quoted. It was def worth the wait. Also for those who care, they use Eco friendly to go containers and natural ingredients so its a little more expensive but to me its worth it!"
I just moved into the Aveondale/Irving neighborhood. I live only 5 min away from this place so one night I decided to indulge. Being a fitness freak I don't often eat fried chicken. However being a foodie I have eaten my fair share of fried goodness. It was nice inside even though I got my order to go. The fried chicken was just awesome the corn bread was out of this world. The mac and cheese defiantly has a kick too it that overwhelmed my taste buds. Not the best mac and cheese don't even wanna know the amount of sodium in it either. In defense of the mac and cheese my gf couldn't get enough of it. To each their own. I will defiantly be back some time soon. O and they work odd hours they are sometimes closed during the week. Check online make sure they are open before you go.
"Hubs and I both had the day off yesterday and decided to venture out for lunch. I wanted to try a new (for me) place and he'd already vouched for the chicken, so Honey Butter it was. It was really nice out, so we sat on the patio in back. I ordered the 2 piece, hubs got the chicken sandwich and we both pecked at the Mac & cheese. My 2-piece came with a breast and a drumstick. Confession: I really hate anything with bones. I did know what I was getting into, but it still creeped me out. The meat on both pieces was moist, but the drumstick seemed a little too moist, if that makes any sense. Or maybe slippery. Who knows, I haven't eaten meat on a bone in probably 30 years, so maybe that's how it's supposed to be. Anywhoo, I enjoyed the breast piece better. The honey butter to slather made me feel a bit like committing a crime on my arteries, but a delicious crime at that. The Mac & cheese was really good, but I could only handle a nibble or two because this girl's greaseometer had hit Full. All in all, while I liked my chicken breast, it wasn't very crispy, which I had hoped for and our bill seemed quite expensive for what we got. No hard feelings, but now that I've tried it, I can cross it off my list."
Yum.  The food is tastey and the staff is super friendly.  And the outdoor patio is a nice touch.  Make sure to get the Chocolate Chip & toffee cookie.
This place is amazing!! Awesome food Great staff!! Tried the Honey Butter Fried Chicken Sandwich and the mashed potatoes with chicken fat gravy!!

OMG I LOVE THEIR CHICKEN AND FRENCH TOAST!!!! And their bourbon syrup so good!!! Love the atmosphere. They offer wine and beer for dinner love the design
"As one of the most eagerly anticipated restaurant openings in recent memory, is it any wonder that lines are already forming down the block? This place is sure to become the Hot Doug's of fried chicken.I can't imagine anyone was more anxious than I, for Honey Butter Fried Chicken to open its doors. Really. If there was someone more excited, then I want to meet you and shake your hand.I live nearby, and for the past six months I'd drive past the storefront at least once a week, trying to gauge progress. I would get out of my car and press my nose up against the glass to get a glimpse of the interior. I would stalk them on Facebook. Ah, the things I do in the pursuit of one of my most favorite gustatory delights on the planet: fried chicken.Legend has it that the recipe was an accident; apparently a tray of honey-buttered corn cakes tipped over onto a plate of fried chicken. And on that fateful day, history was made.We stood in line and waited for about forty minutes before we were able to place our order. The time passed quickly since we sipped cocktails while waiting in line (prepared by vest-wearing, handlebar-mustache-sporting mixologists); a Hamm's beer for my intrepid companion, and an Avondale Ginger Mule for me.Finally we got to the front of line and ordered the eight-piece dinner, a side of the pimento mac 'n cheese, and a side of heirloom tomato salad with fresh corn and dill. The eight-piece comes with four corn muffins (sadly we were inexplicably shorted one). The chicken is locally-sourced Amish, Montessori-schooled, buttoned-up-and-not zippered, brined, double-battered and fried, and finally, it's sprinkled with smoked paprika salt and served with sweet, salty honey butter on the side. Glorious.I thought is was interesting that no wings are offered in any of the chicken dinner options. It makes me wonder if Amish chickens are born without wings. I like wings, and missed having them. I suppose they're not included because wings cook faster than other chicken pieces and it would probably throw off the whole frying process. Also of note: there's no salt or pepper on the tables. That's how confident these folks are that their chicken is seasoned properly. It didn't really need salt, but as I tend to salt everything, I wished I could have had some, especially for the side dishes.The chicken is many things: juicy, crispy, succulent, mouth-watering, flavorful, and the pieces are huge! Amish chickens must be on 'roids.There's about fifty seats inside and a huge outside patio. If it's this crowded already, I am fearful about cold weather fast approaching, leaving well over 50% of their seating unavailable. Guess I'll be doing lots of carry out. There's only one cashier, so with any luck, they'll add a second, which would help the line move more quickly. This place is already a well-oiled machine. Tables are bussed quickly, menus are passed out while you're in line, and the staff is super friendly.Shot through the heart, and HBFC's to blame. Is there any doubt I will be back?"
The chicken was good. The location isn't convenient for me. If I was in the area I will return. The mac and cheese was a let down. Was glad to have tried it out.
"KNOWN FOR- Fried Chicken (8/10)BUZZ- Pimento Mac & Cheese (2/10)I ALSO TRIED- Roasted Sweet Potato Salad (2/10)- Schmaltz Smashed Potatoes (5/10)- Creamed Corn (5/10)- Chicken & Grits (8/10)- Honey Buffalo Wings (3/10)- Gumbo (2/10)I was checking my feed one day and saw this absolutely gorgeous picture of their fried chicken, and I could almost feel the crackle and crisp of the chicken in my teeth. I could even almost taste the buttery peppery seasoning of the skin too! (Photo credit: Sarah S.) I knew I had to try this place!Well, I did what I always do when I go to a new hyped up place...I order too much! I'm just so curious as to what everything tastes like, that I have to order everything that either sounds good or I've heard mentioned before. And that, my friends, is how you get to a $70 meal! It's a really small place. There're only like 5-6 tables in the front (that seat 6-8) and another one in the back, and there's some wall seating too, but that's it. I guess in the summer there's a patio, but we went during winter, so we couldn't use that. Once you get in, if you're with a party, while people wait in line to order, you should have another go scouting for a table. You'll preferably want someone intimidating and with hand to hand combat experience for this job. FRIED CHICKENSurprisingly, even though the pictures didn't look it, all the pieces are boneless. When they deliver it, they recommend that you put the honey butter on top of the chicken. Well, though it may seem like this would simply soggify the crispy skin, it really still preserved its crispiness well. The skin is crispier, and maybe thicker, than KFC's Original Recipe, but not anywhere near their Extra Crispy. I'm also happy to report that neither of my chicken pieces were dry. They were KFC moist. The honey butter didn't really overturn any flavors, but there was just a lacing of sweetness because of it, and the butter certainly made the skin more buttery. The flavor and seasoning are closer to KFC's Extra Crispy than Original; however, it has enough seasoning for me to really like it!I should now mention to you that I'm no expert at fried chicken, or at least I'm not like most. When I think of delicious fried chicken, as you could probably tell, I think of KFC. I don't hate Brown's, Popeye's, or Harold's, but I don't really get excited about them as I do KFC. I would rate Honey Butter somewhere between KFC and the rest. CHICKEN & GRITSI love grits. Little bit of butter and a sprinkle of salt, and I'm a happy guy! I didn't even read the description, I just saw ""grits"" and I ordered it. Lo and behold, there're small nuggets of buffalo chicken tenders! Whoa! Buffalo Chicken Grits?! YES PLEASE! The chicken is a traditional buffalo sauce. What blew me away even further was that the grits were Roasted Garlic Grits! This was really good, maybe on par or even better than the fried chicken itself; however, in some way, the roasted garlic and buffalo flavors weren't all that harmonious. The complimented each other in some aspects, but I almost felt like they clashed more. The grits on their own were delicious, and the chicken...well, how can you not like buffalo chicken tenders? But together, it was like 1 + 1 = 1.2. I will add that the chicken was a bit salty though.PIMENTO MAC & CHEESEI like pimento in olives, and that's about it. The mac & cheese isn't creamy, but more chunky. Tasted almost like a cheddar mac. The pimento was subtle, but the mac definitely had an onion-y persuasion to it. Thick, salty, and a weird flavor. For me, it was already a culinary mess, and adding ""garilcky breadcrumbs"" to the top was just exasperating it further. I took 2 bites and never touched it again.RAPID FIRE (Running outta room)Roasted Sweet Potato Salad - Sweet potatoes weren't that good. Plus lime and cilantro? Ugh! Who came up with this concoction?Schmaltz Smashed Potatoes - Average mashed potatoes and gravy, although real mashed, not the flake mix. I'd prefer KFC.Creamed Corn - I love creamed corn! WHY add Thai Green curry? Even though you could hardly tell it was curry, the flavor became a bit weirder. I ate it anyway.Gumbo - Looked disgusting. Took a sip, tasted bland and boring. Pass!Honey Buffalo Wings - The garlic aioli dipping sauce is nice. Flavor was weird, and wasn't what you'd expect ""Honey Buffalo"" to taste like. Way too salty. This was barely edible.EAT MOR CHIKIN!Reviews like this make me want to change my star rating formula. I take an average of all my scores, and this became 2 stars, but it's all the sides that really brought it down. When really, I think you should try this place for their chicken! The chicken was good, but I probably wouldn't make a trip out of it. If we were in the area and someone said we should go, I wouldn't mind. I'd get the chicken and maybe suffer through the creamed corn."
"First time going to Honey Butter Fried Chicken, I have to say for the most part it was a great experience. It's pretty small, free parking you pay for your food first then they seat you and bring it out. There is an option to leave a tip although you don't have an actual waiter. The food was great we had the fried chicken, macaroni, mash potatoes and collard greens. They have the best fried chicken and macaroni from a restaurant that Iv ever had!!! The only complaints I have is about the Collard greens they were tough and under seasoned, your food is on a paper plate and  the seating. Around this time of the year it's pretty cold out still so the seating is right by the door, the door opens letting cold air in making hour food cold. The cashier was very polite, met our demands. They acknowledged us as soon as we walked in letting us view the menu. I think if the place was expanded and they gave you real plates instead of paper plates this place would be five stars in my book. Over all great experience would visit again look forward to trying their brunch and sandwiches."
"I love the Chicken here!!!  It's a little on the sweet side so if you're not into that then you may not like it but I think the food is great.  I love the Mac and Cheese as well, which is a side dish that I am very picky about.  The other sides aren't that great to me (I really hated the Kale Coleslaw/salad).  I've tried the grits, mac and cheese and kale crap and the Mac and cheese is the only thing worth getting.  The grits would be better if they were a little thinner with a little more flavor and kick to them.  The cornbread is okay.  It's a cross between real cornbread and a biscuit.  I don't like cornbread so I'm okay with that.  Try the chicken and waffles during brunch.  The portion is a little on the small side so definitely get a side and enjoy!"
"So hubby's friend went to this place and recommended for us to check it out.  My weakness is fried chicken, any fried chicken!  So of course we had to go...c'mon now Honey Butter Fried Chicken, what tha..?!?As we walked in at 7pm on a Friday night, it was getting busy.  There was already a line near the entrance of the door.  The place was modern and it looked small in the dining area near the register and then when you walked in further, there was the bar area, again small...however, if you wanted to eat outside there was plenty of room.  It's set up like community tables and they had heated lamps as well.  It was kind of windy so we ended up eating indoors by the bar area.  But I would definitely go here again when the weather gets warmer in the evenings.Now keep in mind, you will be paying a pretty penny for your cluck, cluck...it's a lot of buck, bucks!  It's because their chicken is fresh, hormone and antibiotic free, locally sourced Amish chicken and brine with yummy goodness.  Now really, do you brine your chicken and fried it up at home...I sure don't.  The only in boned chicken pieces they serve is drumsticks, the rest is boneless thighs and breast.  So don't expect chicken wings here as well...it's not Hooters chicken!    When we sat down we didn't wait long for our food.  It was presented to us on aluminum trays like the ones you use for your oven.I have to say the chicken was REALLY tasty.  Crispy and well-seasoned on the outside and juicy in the inside.  We went all out for this place and bought the 8 piece of chicken...you didn't have a choice of chicken meats with 4 corn muffins...they were more poppers so small and it was a bit dry.  I did really like the soft fluffy sweet honey butter on both the chicken and muffin.Now the sides were ok, didn't agree on the taste to pay so much for it.  I mean $3.50 for what it looked like a 1/2 a cup serving of a side.  If you want to try 3 sides, I'd recommend to get the three sides as you get another corn muffin with it with the same price if you bought 3 separate sides...they won't tell you that.Pimento Mac n Cheese was good, I wanted more.  Roasted Sweet Potato Salad was a bit al dente for my taste; I like Kale so the Kale and cabbage Slaw was good.  But I'd order more of the mac n cheese from the three.The soda/teas are fountain drinks that you would help yourself.   It's a busy place perhaps because it's still ""new""?  Overall experience, was ok, again pricey we dropped $50 bucks for two people for a chicken dinner a drinks...we didn't even get ""sweets and treats"".  Winner, winner, chicken dinner, eh...Maybe if they have chicken specials or coupons then I'll come back.  I don't think I would go out of my way to come back for this place even though I enjoyed the chicken."
"Yum! Yum! Yum! The fried chicken and corn muffins are just delicious. Also treat yourself to the cane soda fountain. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars were the sides - believe it or not, skip the mac-n-cheese, unless you really like pimento. The slaw is really good, but needs more celery seed or something. The thai curry corn is wonderful."
I enjoyed the chicken very much. Liked how the breast was boneless. The chicken didn't seem to have a lot of flavor but just enough. [I may have had too many beers prior though?] Also with my breast and drumstick i ordered the pimento mac and cheese and cornbread with honey butter. The cornbread was on point especially paired with the honey butter. While the mac and cheese was filling it was nothing more than box macaroni pimento style. Next time i go i will eat there so i can enjoy the great beer selection they have. Would definitely go back!
"I'll pretty much copy half of what I said about Parson's: ""Good food, not breath-taking chicken, but I don't know what breath taking chicken is..  It's crispy, juicy, has a fried chicken flavor and is at a reasonable enough price (a little high for what it is).  From reviews I'd expect something sensational, but I know from too many times in the past that I will probably never be blown away by some fried chicken.  I love fried chicken, and most quality fried bird seems to fill the void very well.""Space is a bit of a cluster-foodge when you step in.  And service is a little weird.  There's a lot of young families (read that as little kids and babies around).  Pretty alright spot.  Probably most notable was the bottomless cup of sugary drinks I bought.  Fun trying out flavors, but none of them were especially tasty... I just enjoyed trying them.. ha.  Good enough fried chicken, but not notable enough to come back."
"Here is my rating:5 Stars for the chicken. Not as good as Parsons, but still pretty amazing.  It was quite delicious with the honey butter. We got the 8-piece and it was just enough for two.  Crispy and delicious.3 stars for the sides. We got the grits and the collard greens. I would say they were mediocre at best. The grits were weirdly sweet, and the collard greens had a strange mint taste.1 star, however, because we chose to sit at a very nice table on the patio, only to find that there were not one, not two, but THREE RATS roaming around under our table. When we told our server, he made some strange excuse about 'city rats' who come from 'the alley over'. We moved inside to finish our food, then let the cashier know, who told us it was an ongoing problem, and referred us to the manager. The manager, however (some overweight guy in a ditka jersey), informed that they'd just found out about the rats tonight, which was obviously a complete and total lie.  We received no free food, no apologies, no refunds.  Only a terrible dining experience and the uncomfortable feeling that we were almost bitten by rats.Despite the delicious chicken, I will not be back. The place is clearly unsanitary and I'm amazed they haven't been shut down yet.I'm mostly offended because I paid AND tipped upfront, which was clearly why no one gave a shit about our complaints. I wanted to pick my $5 out of the tip jar."
"I had a great time at Honey Butter Fried Chicken with my husband and two friends.  I was concerned that we wouldn't be able to get a seat because the restaurant was full and the patio wasn't open due to rain, but we waited in line to order for about ten minutes and then waited for another ten minutes to get a table.  Shortly after, our (exceptionally) delicious chicken and side dishes came over.I thought the chicken was the furthest thing from bland.  The meat was nice and tender and had lots of flavor on its own.  The breading was great and had a nice spice.  I also used the honey butter on the chicken, and that was probably overkill but was totally delicious.  One of my tablemates is gluten free and had the wings (both kinds) and devoured them.I thought the corn biscuits with honey butter, the creamed corn, and the kale and cabbage slaw were absolutely fantastic.  The grits, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese were just fine -- good on their own but not really noteworthy.  (My husband will kill me for saying that about the mac and cheese -- he thought it was out-of-this-world delicious.)  The Hill Pop, made with housemade lemonade and Bulleit bourbon, got good reviews from our table.  I really liked the different housemade iced teas.  They have a nice selection of tasty cane-sugar colas, too.  We split a brownie which was moist and very chocolately -- and then turned a bit spicy at the end, which wasn't for me but maybe you'd like it.I took off a star because this place is pretty pricey, even considering that you're in the city and that the food is really good.  I'll still come back, though, because that fried chicken is so very gooooooooooooooood."
"So good!!! Mmmmm! I had a two piece meal and was given a breast, a drumstick, and two corn muffins. I also ordered side of pimento Mac N cheese. I would recommend asking for an extra side of honey butter. I wish I would have asked for a breast and a wing, I don't do dark meat so I have my drumstick to my husband and just finished his corn muffins :)"
"I finally ventured into Honey Butter Fried Chicken on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm and I'm so happy I did. Just an fyi they are closed from 2:00pm to 5:00pm everyday and aren't open Mondays or Tuesdays so if you are craving their chicken during that time, you are SOL. The place was packed, the line wasn't out the door, but close to it, so you definitely may have to wait a little in order to place your order and may or may not get a seat since the place isn't huge. The atmosphere reminds me of Smoque BBQ where you wait in line, then get a table, except here they bring you your food by the number they give you. I had to wait like seven minutes to place my order and my hubby and I decided to share the original fried chicken Sammy Sandwich as well as try the two piece fried chicken set with their mini cornbread and their honey butter. Once we took our seat, I couldn't wait anymore to get our food since chicken was everyone and people were really going to town on it. The smell was incredible which is always a good sign. Finally, it came and I was in Fried Chicken heaven. The original fried chicken sandwich was amazing, mouthwatering and I'm craving it again as I type this. For $8 you get a decent sized portion of the freshest fried chicken, a jalapeño mayo and a slaw in between a pretty big sized brioche bun. My only suggestion is that the bread should be served warm like the rest of the sandwich but maybe they don't want the mayo to completely melt. Anyways, this sandwich was truly tasty, full of flavor, a little sweet and a little spicy from the jalapeño, and the chewy chicken and crunchy slaw, wow, if you try anything here, I would try this. Well we also split the actual chicken pieces and they were probably the best fried chicken I've ever had, the skin was crunchy and cooked to perfection and the chicken was super moist and tender. Oh and it was served hot! Once you put that honey butter on, it takes it to another level, I could eat 3 of those little honey butter portions because they are that good, so definitely don't count your calories and get that butter and then whip it all over the chicken. The corn bread was small and a okay, kinda not sure what it's purpose is being so small, maybe just for decoration. Overall, an awesome concept with some great food, especially the chicken. The guy taking your order was friendly so that's always a good thing. The sides honestly don't look so appetizing so I wasn't going to waste my calories on them, I'd rather get more chicken and honey butter. My only complaint is that I think that for 2 pieces of chicken $8 is kind of a lot since you can get a whole chicken at whole foods for that amount, because it is, chicken after all. But despite being a little pricey for what you're getting, it won't stop me from coming back and next time I'm getting extra honey butter."
"This place has their situation under control.  It gets very crowded but they still manage to stay organized.  I love the grass roots feel to it all.  But wow,  the fried chicken is obviously as good as it can get in terms of the quality of the meat.  The mac and cheese is also a must since it has such a unique taste to it.  Wings are fantastic too.  And they serve alcohol too!  Fried chicken and Miler High-life!"
This place is incredible. I go straight to the chicken and muffins. Many pieces of chicken have been masterfully re wrapped in skin leaving a delicious boneless completely crispy bite every time.
"I came here during brunch hours and the food was good, but not the best.  There was hardly any flavor in the butter and the chicken was way greasy, I tasted a lot of oil.  The sides were really good, but expensive for like a cup of it.  I still love my Popeyes!"
"So good. I get a craving for fried chicken every once in awhile and found this place. So much better than anything else I've ever had. Everything is great. Sides, Chicken, Dessert. You can't go wrong."
"If you're wondering if this place is as indulgent as it's name implies, I'm happy to say that it exceeds it! I wish I bought more cornbread, They were addicting! Our sandwiches had us questioning our existence. 10/10 would do again."
"This crap sucked.I don't mean it was average. I don't mean it was decent. I don't mean it was acceptable. This was some of the worst restaurant chicken I've ever had. It was also by far the most expensive. What a horrible combination that is.Everything was bad. The chicken was dry, hard, small and bland. The mac and cheese was bland and not very cheesy. The mashed potatoes were bland. The ""chicken fat"" gravy"" tasted like the powered shit you buy in $.50 packages at the grocery store.. The corn muffins sucked. The lemonade was $3.50 for what amounted to around 4-6 ounces of juice. Anyone who considers this good chicken should be ashamed of themselves. Even moreso than the owners of this place. After all they're genius for being able to sell small pieces of poorly executed chicken for double the market rate. 4 pieces, 3 quarter sized muffins, 2 tiny sides and a lemonade for $30? Never again.This is the LAST time I give one of these hipster comfort food places a chance. I've never left even remotely satisfied."
"I cannot get enough Honey Butter Fried Chicken.It is quite delicious. I love  the mac and cheese - it may be my favorite thing on the menu, but the classic fried chicken is pretty special as well. The only reason that I can't give if five stars is that it is pretty pricey. For what you pay, I expected at least the side orders to be a little larger. Back to the food - I already mentioned the macaroni and cheese was divine, but I also loved the mashed potatoes. I am not a huge fan of gravy on my mashed potatoes, but the gravy they have is something special and really makes the potatoes quite delish. We got the nachos on special and they were really good. The chicken and grits was so-so, but that is just my opinion. My boyfriend preferred those to the nachos. I will say that I walked in and ordered a hard cider when I arrived. The bartender in the back was very nice and offered me a taste before I committed to the bottle. He also offered me a sample of the new cider that they were going to be serving to get my opinion. The drinks are different from what I normally go for, but they are pretty good about finding something to match your taste.All in all, this is not a restaurant you can just pass by. It may be a bit on the pricey side, but, for the most part, it is worth the price."
"After all the hype and the great reviews- I hit the line at Honey Butter Fried Chicken. It was prime time, Saturday Night at 7PM. The line was to the door, and took about 15 minutes to get to the register.This was efficient enough, you place your order and a food runner brings the meal to your table.  Let's just start with the chicken- it was great, the honey butter was a nice extra touch, and I suppose made it stand out from other places- there were no bones in the chicken. Odd, but easy to eat! When asked what pieces you get with an order- I was told a combo of breast, thigh or leg. (No wings, they use the wings for a starter)  I ended up with what I think was a thigh and for sure a breast- seemed about the same without the bones..It could have even been two breasts, I have no idea- but it was great, either way.Side dishes were 3.50, but worth it- They were out of the creamed corn by 7PM on Saturday night? The place opens at 5...how do you run out so quickly?  I tried the Kale Cabbage Slaw- is this the new Cole Slaw for 2013?  It was good. Different enough. My friend had smashed potatoes, they were kind of soupy, but he liked it.  The corn muffins served with the chicken were tiny, but it was enough for me. And with a little Honey Butter on it, good.The staff was great, there to answer any questions about the menu, and once a table opened up, they had it cleared and ready for the next party in just seconds. They really have it together, and there is a nice outdoor patio too, with heat lamps that were going on a decent fall evening.I say go, if you like fried chicken, you will like this place."
"Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Tested the hype out when it came to this chicken and I'm on the bandwagon now. Wish all the chicken would have the bone in but at this point I don't even care anymore. I want more. Now. The sides are interesting as well. Unlike any other when it comes to taste profile. ""Delicious as [bleep]!""-me"
The best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had. The crew here rocks! The hippie looking guy behind the counter is awesome (you'll know when you meet him )And the honey butter is its own food group. Must try!
We came after a friend had made a recommendation.  Glad we did.  Food and service were good. The chicken was so moist it made the honey butter unnecessary.  Mac and cheese and potato salad weren't the best items on the menu.  Will probably be back in the future.
"Yes, yes, yes!  Celebrated our parents 47Th anniversary here.  Great place the food (those juicy fried boneless chicken breasts) atmosphere (light, fresh, clean, hip) cocktails (old fashion was awesome, a beer and a shot of tequila for $5 seriously). service awesome (owner checking on us, and happy anniversary treats for our parents, the guy in the hamburger sweatshirt loved, and the hostess so sweet, cool dude bartenders too) Had the chicken, wings, kale cole slaw, Mac n cheese, grits, mashed potatoes, greens, pickeled parsnips, cookie, cayenne brownie and good coffee.  HELLO some serious great stuff, with service by some great down to earth people, in a great neighborhood with lots of free parking can't get much better.  Salad tomorrow!"
Maybe it's me but I just don't get it.$15 for 4 tiny pieces of overcooked chicken with silver dollar sized cornbreads...please.To make it taste better you lather it with honey butter.I think popeye's next time.
"Had dinner there last night.  The chicken was very good.  Corn muffin buttery enough not to need the extra honey butter provided on the side.  We were welcomed by staff upon arrival and given menus to look at while we waited in a very short line that moved fast - and our food was served to us shortly after we were seated, inside, although they have a very lovely outdoor seating area.  But what really sticks out about this place is how clean and neat the entire restaurant is, from the seating area, the bathrooms, the drink station.  And I love that they have a big jar of cold water available for free that is kept full."
"As someone who loves southern food, Honey Butter Fried Chicken was good! The chicken was tasty and there were many sides to choose from. I really liked the grits and pimento mac n' cheese. Overall, a solid place to get your southern food filling in Chicago!"
"What you see is what you get. I had to try Honey Butter chicken, simply because I love fried chicken. This place was a little far from my hotel but it was worth the trip. The customer service was excellent and I had no complaints about the food. The prices are a bit high though. The chicken is extremely juicy, so have napkins near. Fried Chicken 1-5=4. Honey Butter 1-5=4. Corn Muffin 1-5=2."
this place was sooooo good the honey butter was not to sweet and the chicken was made just right I will be back
"Seriously....AMAZING..the honey, the butter, the honey butter!!!! I love this place and try hard not to go weekly. So tasty it should have a warning sign lol! (I'm a foodie and I'm not ashamed)"
The chicken here is phenomenal - the bones are removed from all but the drumstick so you can enjoy your meat like a true savage. Get the mac-and-cheese as a side and you'll be set for dinner. They also have ~20 different bottled craft brews including a few unique options from Revolution Brewery.
"The name says it all. Smothaaa that buttaaa!!!! It's a delicious heart attack. But it's sooooo good. They have extended their hours Over a year now. When in use to go, it was only open from 5-9pm and the line was always out the door. Love the outside patio in the back.Mac and cheese is good too. Their chicken, tho....:P"
"This review is hard to right because our feelings about the food that we got vary immensely.  There are some serious highs and lows here.Honey butter fried chicken-  not a fanFried chicken sandwich- Awesome!!Mac and cheese- not goodBaked beans-  terrible, seriously.  The worst baked beans I've ever eaten.  Totally undercooked and just bad.Biscuit-  small but goodMashed potatoes- decent, if you're getting a side get thisTaffy apple dump cake-  Amazing!!In summary, the fried chicken and dump cake are the real standouts here.  The mashed potatoes and biscuit are pretty good too.  Come and check this place out.  Try a bunch of things the first time and then you'll know what to order again in the future."
"Not impressed. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was good. However, it is fried chicken. IT COSTS TOO MUCH!  I really do not know why I did not listen to review after review.  I guess I was sucked in like sooo many others. I just had to taste this super bird. I now feel like I was ""had"".  One recent yelper asked a great question as to why you charge sooo much. I would like to know. I will not be going back."
"A solid 3.5 stars, so I rounded up. Let's start with the good. I had a two piece chicken and mac and cheese. Both were very good. Mind you, not slap your momma good (see Crisp review), but tasty nonetheless. The white meat tastes much better than dark, and I usually have no preference in what part of the chicken I like. Adding the honey butter to the chicken does complement it, so that was nice and surprising. Now for the not so good. The prices are a bit high. It's chicken for heaven's sake, not caviar. Also, they charge a dollar for an additional little serving of honey butter. It's butter. With honey. One buck for a tablespoon of these two items is absurd. There will be a line. Depending on when you go, possibly a long one. It will probably be a bit chaotic, and definitely crowded. Guess that's the payoff for eating at hyped trendy hot spots. Overall, worth the visit but I'm not clamoring to go back."
Very good chicken juicy full of flavor top quality ingredients.I saw several review where people like it but rated it poorly over price..... You get what you pay for a few bucks more than KFC 10x the quality.They had a nice selection of craft brews and cocktails.Sides were excellent gourmet quality!I would highly recommend.
ALWAYS a treat when I get to eat here. Everything on the menu is awesome. And whiskey sour is the way to go.
"Went here last night. Made the mistake of ordering buffalo chicken wings. They were all bone, no meat, and the sauce tasted like something you could buy at jewel. Do not get the chicken wings when ordering from here, you'll be disappointed! However, their fried chicken is where its at, obviously. Dip that in some honey butter and you'll feel the love. I found the mashed potatoes to be odd, they had a sweet taste to them and the Mac n cheese is very sharp tasting. Its with pimento cheese and be aware it comes through. The atmosphere is chill and the staff is very accomodating. However, I feel the food is overpriced for the size you get. Def not somewhere you go if you're really hungry. They also have beer, mostly ipas. The bartender has an insane mustache."
"I love this place! The food is great--local and healthy, they have daily specials, the service is incredible and it's very reasonably priced. I'd recommend this to anyone. Go go go! P.s. Try the cocktails too! AND THE LEMONADE"
"We just beat the rush. Came in on a Sunday at 6pm. There was a line out the door after we sat down. We ordered several items:1) the 8 piece chicken with corn muffins - this was excellent. Crispy and full of flavor. Corn muffins we're a little on the smaller side but very tasty. And the honey butter is a must try. 2) Pimento mac n cheese - it was fine. Nothing spectacular. No complaints either3) Mashed potatoes - standard but def hit the spot. 4) Creamed corn in Thai green curry - good but I wish it was spicier5) Kale cole slaw - if you like cole slaw, you'll like this. If you don't, then just pass. 6) Thai glazed wings - I thought it was fine but my friends hated it. Probably wouldn't order it again7) Honey glazed buffalo wings - I expected to be blown away, but wasn't. It was A-okWish I had tried some more of the unique dishes.  We did leave satisfied. Service was great too. And we left a couple of bags at the table, and a staff member chased us down the street to give it to us. Will def be back!"
"Pasted on every napkin dispenser on the tables is a little placard that spends 3 entire paragraphs spewing meaningless buzzwords and foodie platitudes: ""local sustainable, antibiotic-free WHOLE AMISH CHICKENS...non-GMO, trans-fat-free canola oil...guests who are treated like friends and family...vendors who are our allies..."" and it just goes on like this.  That tells me two things: a) this place takes itself way too seriously in serving what is ultimately a piece of poultry dunked in hot oil, b) they're probably trying to draw attention away from the quality of the actual food.There is patio seating in the backyard.  On my way, I tallied a mental checklist: waitstaff with questionable piercings and a handlebar mustache?  Check.  Rustic, wood-paneled decor?  Check.  Artisan sodas?  Checkmate.  Cosmetic details, to be sure, but as it turns out, HBFC would probably be better served by ditching the faux-Brooklyn vibe and focusing on its main product: fried chicken.  I would grumble a bit, but I wouldn't be displeased to drop $8 for a (boneless) thigh, a small drumstick, and two truly infant-sized corn muffins...if the food was any good.  Sadly, they couldn't even get that right, as the chicken was moist, but lacked any kind of seasoning or heat or depth of flavor.  Disappointing.  All the honey butter in the world can't salvage a fundamentally tasteless bird.  No point in sourcing chickens from the Amish if you're not even going to prepare them properly.  Really, if this is the best that the ""like-minded, local businesses who share our values"" can offer, then give me mass-produced, CAFO-bred Monsanto chicken anyday.  I'm going back to Popeye's."
So fell upon this lovely chicken joint because Hot Doug's was closed at 4pm down the street. The worker there directed us to HOney Butter Fried Chicken Ordered the 8 piece Fried Chicken w/1) Cream of corn2) Roasted sweet potatoes3) Pimento MacN Cheeseyelp.com/user_local_phot…Put some honey butter on those chickens and you are good to go !Chickens are also boneless so more meat and less mess.
"I'm really sad to write this review, because I was sooooo excited about this place.  I went with a group of girl friends, and despite a bunch of them living in the area, we all waited so we could experience the deliciousness together.  They have a cute little patio with great seating.  Beware: Mickey and Minnie mouse are likely to scurry by along the exterior wall of the patio, and chip and dale will likely be climbing in the ivy growing on that same wall.  They definitely have a rodent situation out there, but none of them came near the actual tables.We ordered one of everything on the menu except for the creamed corn.  The chicken was just alright.  I expected the honey butter to already be melted onto the chicken, but when it wasn't I obviously put it on there myself.  Unfortunately, the chicken wasn't hot enough for the butter to really melt...  The mac and cheese is pretty good, but I didn't care for the greens. They were tough and flavorless.  The kale had little unexpected crunchy bits inside, not sure what that was. The buffalo wings and the chili glazed wings were alright; zero flavor outside the sauce and there wasn't much of it.  We ordered the club sandwich was again just aight; the bacon was tough making it hard to eat.  Now those little corn muffins were DELICIOUS, especially with the fancy butter.  And that dump cake, cherry on the day of my visit, was to die for.  I could eat that after dinner every night.  The specialty drinks are also good.I'd probably go back for a drink and some dump cake, but my aversion to wildlife would likely force me to sit inside."
"We went to HBFC on a snowy Friday evening. Been curious about the place since I saw it on TV. I would have to say the chicken's ok but not sure if it's worth the 1 hr drive to Chicago. However the sides are definitely better and worth a try! The corn and roasted sweet potato salad are my faves.  Very different from your typical dishes. Very expensive though. For 8 pieces of chicken, it's $28!!! For 3 sides, it's $10.50! If you want extra honey butter, it's $1! 50 cents for 1 small corn muffin! Whoa! It's a little too much imho.Overall, should try. If you're in the area,  I say go for it. Go for the sides not the chicken. However personally not my go to comfort food.UPDATE:Day 2 HBFC does not taste good at all. It was so dry, it made me sad. I had to take away a star. My brother wasn't impressed as well. Not worth a second trip."
"I see from your very informative website that you remove not only the bones from your chicken breasts but also the tenders so that you can sell them separately.  So for $8 I get a small chicken leg, two small corn muffins, a half ounce of honey butter AND a breast with  the best (and most expensive) part removed so that you can sell it to someone else.  Thanks, HBFC!  You're awesome!  Let me just get back in line behind the other rubes.What manner of self-delusion did you employ to convince yourselves that your diners wouldn't have a problem with that?  This sort of cheapness on your part really mystifies me.  On the one hand your ethics seem to be in the right place: you serve only hormone-free free-range chicken, source from local farmers, pay your bearded hipsterinos a ""living wage"", but then you turn around and remove part (arguably the BEST part) of what people reasonably expect they are paying for and, like organ harvesters, sell it to someone else.Was part of your business model to sabotage yourself with underhanded pettiness like this?  Instead of your guests unreservedly raving about how great HBFC is they end nearly every review with a caveat about the pricing.  Let me help summarize what your clientele is trying to tell you:1. Your prices are prohibitively high.2. Your prices are prohibitively high.Or maybe you'd prefer to hide your head in the sand and convince yourselves that your customers are wrong.  I look forward to seeing what new restaurant will be in that spot next year when the lines of people waiting to give you their money is but a distant memory.Your food is beautifully prepared and presented and is quite tasty.  Straighten out your price point so we can all continue to enjoy it."
"Here comes Honey Butter Fried Chicken!  It's a cozy little corner restaurant near our neighborhood.  I can see how it can get crowded quick, since there's limited seating both in the front and back areas.  You order up front first before taking any available seat.Hubby and I split the 4-piece chicken and also tried the three sides for $10.5.  The chicken was a mix of boneless and bone.  It was seasoned nicely, not too salty.  The skin was crispy and had a definitive texture that set it apart from regular fried chicken.  Oh and that honey butter.  You do have to smother the chicken with it.  For the sides, we tried the pimento mac n' cheese (easily the best), the creamed corn with Thai green curry, and the Schmaltz smashed potatoes with chicken fat gravy.  The potatoes and gravy was too rich even for me.  The corn muffins were yummy, but could have been bigger.  The chocolate toffee cocoa nib cookie was nothing spectacular.  I didn't recognize the fountain drinks they offered.  They only serve unsweetened tea with the option to you sweeten yourself."
"Chicken sandwich and sides rock here at HBFC! Pimento Mac n cheese is a must. Try the Gio Joe sandwich- typically off menu as a special. Outdoor space is nice and great for groups, families too."
"HBFC is a fun little off-the-beaten-path restaurant in Chicago's Avondale neigborhood.  I've only been here once to eat, but I do intend on returning again in the future.Obviously, chicken is what is limelighted here.  I ordered the 2-Piece Chicken.  It was good.  It isn't grandma's finger-lickin'-soul-food chicken (I'm from the south side and have a very particular idea of how fried chicken should be), but I did enjoy it.  It was breaded and seasoned well.  The two-piece came with a thigh and breast and a cute little cornbread (I did really like the cornbread) and some honey butter to spread on top.  My friend and I shared a few sides:  Roasted Sweet Potato Salad, Creamed Corn with Thai Green Curry, and a Chicken Fried Rice special they had that day.  The sides were really good, and I recommend you order a few to share.They offer cocktails, beer, and wine, but I did not order any when I went.One of the managers came out and talked with us for a bit.  He was really friendly and I always like to see managers and owners taking their own personal time to make sure customers are happy.They have a really nice patio out back, so I think this place will do really well in the summer!  It will be one of my destinations for summer patio drinking and eating.The two downsides to this place are it's location (kind of out of the way in Avondale, mostly just residential and industrial nearby) and the price.  In my personal opinion, the prices seem just a bit much for the type and amount of food you receive, considering you order it at the front counter and the pieces of chicken aren't very big.  That being said, I'll still be back.  Tip:  In February 2014, HBFC is partnering with Piece Pizzeria (in Wicker Park) to serve up a Honey Butter Fried Chicken Pizza!"
"More like Honey Butter Overpriced Chicken.  I mean don't get me wrong...the chicken is good.  Crispy with some good ol honey butter for dipping and some interesting sides.  Here is the breakdown:4 stars for food-1 for overpriced chicken-.5 for waiting in line in the rain for an overrated and overpriced mealWe'll round up to 3.It was like $40 for my hubby and I with no leftovers and no fond memories.  My husband said it reminds him of KFC - which is, at least, good chicken at a good price.  I'll def give it another shot in the summer, but won't be racing back anytime soon, especially with Frontier's fried chicken deal on Sundays!"
"After all the hype, I have to admit: I actually didn't like the honey butter! The sides were great (if you're into pimento, the Mac and cheese is a treat), but I found the butter itself to mostly just taste like extra fatty butter. The club sandwich was a bland roasted chicken slathered in ranch, the honey butter sandwich was also unexciting. Better luck next time!"
"They're biscuits were delicious and with the honey butter it really gave them a nice sweet taste, the chicken was good quality.  My only problem was I usually don't eat dark meat and the guy taking my order didn't specify if you get to choose (I went with the two piece) I'll have to remember to mention that.  Besides that, I felt it was a little pricy for what you were getting , two pieces of chicken and two small biscuits for 8 bucks.....could have been a little cheaper or could have thrown in another biscuit or two.  Besides that, it has a nice atmosphere and the guys working the place were nice and friendly."
"I am BAFFLED by the negative, naggy reviews - this is easily the best fried chicken I've ever had. Incredibly tender and fresh, with just a dash of a spicier dry rub. Mind blowing even without the titular Honey Butter. Finally, a place that serves a more unique mac and cheese! Sure, it's expensive...compared to any other run-of-the-mill grease stain chicken place. For how much I loved my meal, the price (which was about $35 for two people and left us with a mountain of leftovers) was just right. Great atmosphere, attentive staff and delicious food - I'll be back ASAP. If I had to say something negative, it would be that seating is a little tight. It probably doesn't seem as bad in the summer when the patio seating can be utilized. I can see the seating arrangement working for the ""southern homespun"" vibe, but it's a little awkward to be so close to strangers when you're trying to eat and have your own conversation."
"Here's a hint...you put the Honey Butter ON the fried chicken before you eat it...hence the name of the restaurant haha.It's amazing.  Like really finger licking good.  I heard about HBFC by word of mouth, and most people would argue it's the best fried chicken in the city.  Let me jump on that band wagon and say it's pretty damn good. The sides are equally amazing.  Southern inspired...bellies are being made happy all over the city. The patio space is really cute.  It's on the medium to small side, with strung lights like most patios.  The benches are weird shapes- but all the better to jigsaw yourself a huge space for your next huge get together.  As with most places in Chicago, I can't wait to go back!"
"Pretty good. Better than Parson's. Still think a place like Harold's has as good fried chicken. This place is fun to go to and has a good vibe. Got the four piece. I pegged a star because you actually get three pieces: the breast is split up into to pieces. So for $15, that's pretty terrible value. The cornbread is really good with the butter. The hot sauce on the table is weak sauce. I liked all the sides. We tried the collared greens, the smashed potatoes, and Mac and cheese. I'll come back but there are better values out there."
You sounded like you would be sooo amazing...but I was throughly disappointed from everything from the sides to the tiny cornbread and the honey butter chicken itself. AND for those PRICES?!! Are you kidding??!! The portions are ridiculously small and you charge those kind of prices is highway robbery. THUMBS DOWN
"Just delicious. Rolled in here for lunch one day with a few other chicken lovers. Mon dieu, this stuff is good.Buttery chicken, with added honey butter on top. Moist. Juicy. Delicious. Another winner was the side dish - corn with Thai green curry. So great. The perfect amount of food for lunch, without causing a food coma. And at $10 for the lunch combo (2 pc. chicken, side dish and drink), it's somewhat of a splurge, but you can't eat this stuff every day anyway.What was REALLY great (and this might be my particular brand of nuttiness) were the fountain drinks. Not the usual array of Coke-Diet Coke-Sprite. They have GINGER SODA! This stuff is incredibly delicious. And Green River. And a couple other unusual flavors that I want to try.And cocktails!! And beer! I didn't have any cocktails on this day, had to do work-work-work, but this place would be perfect for lunch on a Saturday. Then BOOM. Out come the cocktails!I went back and had the Fried Chicken Sandwich and damn. It is even better than the Fried Chicken lunch special. Delicious cole slaw and yummy chicken on a pretzel-y bun. Good size."
"Oh. My. God. We will definitely be back. The honey butter fried chicken sandwich is highly addictive. We went for a late lunch when it wasn't crowded which would be best considering how small the place is. Knowing that they use top notch, non-gmo ingredients also makes this place exceptional."
"Place your order at the counter, get assigned a number that you take back to your table, and wait for the good eats to be delivered.  It's a nice space they have here.  Well-spaced, brightly-lit, and no unnecessary frills.  To be honest I found their chicken was a little dry and missing that crunch I look for in a good fried chicken, but they try to sneak you past that with a well-seasoned crust and the ubiquitous honeyed-butter.  The chicken is almost completely boneless so these much more resemble adult chicken strips than actual fried chicken.  We also ordered 3 side dishes; thai cream corn, mac n cheese, and coleslaw as well as the pickle side.  The best side dish was mac'n cheese.  Well seasoned and not greasy at all. The Thai creamed corn was also yummy.  Nothing special about the pickles or coleslaw but it's nice to have that sour note to accompany such heavy food.  I'd like to note that the serving of pickles was interesting, but disappointingly small.Sure, I'd go back.  They bring a flavor and a style that is uniquely their own.  But I can also rattle off a few other fried chicken places in Chicago that are easily better."
"After several failed attempts of coming to Honey Butter Fried Chicken, I finally made my way there on a Sunday morning with a party of four.  As we arrived, we found ourselves in front of a run-down corner restaurant but when we walked through the doors we found ourselves among a modern and yet cozy eatery.  To our surprise, there was ample seating and not much of a line.  We decided on an eight piece fried chicken which was accompanied with honey butter and four corn muffins.  We also decided to grab three sides: pimento mac n' cheese with garlicky bread crumbs, kale and cabbage slaw with yogurt cumin dressing and dried pomegranate, and creamed corn with Thai green curry.  I guess when you order three sides, it comes with two more corn muffins and honey butter.  The fried chicken was delicious.  It was perfectly seasoned, had the right amount of breading to give it that crunch, and still juicy and moist.  To top everything off, the honey butter.  Oh my...sweet and creamy fried chicken...such a heavenly combination.  The corn muffins were tiny but still good.  I also loved how it had the indention of a bee on one side and a honey comb on the other.  Very clever HBFC...very clever.  The mac n' cheese and the cream corn were also good.  Good flavors and good texture.  The only thing I didn't like was the slaw, but I was never a huge fan of slaw anyways.  So I guess I'm not the right person to judge. Many Yelpers here are complaining about the high price points of HBFC, but I think you get what you pay for.  The food here is delicious and the service is great.  The only thing I didn't like was how the seating area was cramped.  The tables are squished so close together that it was like sharing tables with strangers.  I don't like the idea where others can listen to my conversations.  Other than that minor issue, there is nothing wrong with this establishment.  If you are hesitant to give this place a try, don't!  It is definitely worth the hype and the wait."
"Apparently butter on chicken was a, ""WHOOPS!"" from the creators of Honey Butter Fried Chicken. How many of history's great ideas have been accidents? Corn Flakes? The microwave? Viagra? Velcro? Some of my closest friends? The point is, we can add butter and chicken to this long list of the best uh-oh's. The sides here are also on point, particularly the mac'n'cheese and collard greens. Order a hundred biscuits, because you'll chow through about 98 of them and will have 2 left over for anyone you pass on the way home who's hungry. I'm not saying HBFC will solve homelessness, I'm just saying you'll make someone's day. My only complaints: space and the homemade pickles scheme. Space: they need not put you so close to your neighbor, because your neighbor may be a small child that shouldn't have been allowed out of the house, or a very drunk patron who won't even remember the lovely meal they consumed. Both were a shame for me. Homemade pickles: it's a little cup of pickles, not a pickle. I will say the flavors and concept are ideal, but the size for the price was disappointing. I wanted more and they said I had to pay for that."
"Nothing short of amazing for a hungover lunch!! The original fired chicken sandwich is awesome- love the chipotle mayo and whatever other spicy seasoning they use. The chicken is tender and juicy on the inside but crunchy on the outside, and the slaw adds great texture. However I will say I was super excited to try the mac and cheese but to be honest I was a little disappointed...it's a little soggy for me. The homemade sodas on the other hand are delicious!Service is awesome as well. The staff is super friendly and goes above and beyond to accommodate guests!!"
"So pumped to finally make it to Honey Butter for brunch! Amy F., Halley W., and I headed over on a Sunday morning around 11:30. Street parking is plentiful in the area and the process of finding a table post-ordering works extremely well! While we waited in line to place our order, a gentleman had already arranged a table for three in the back. While HBFC's menu is pretty simple, they do have some really interesting brunch options. We all decided on different items and to share sides.For brunch, Halley went with the chicken and grits which she really enjoyed, but grew tired of due to the strong buffalo sauce flavor. I had a bite and the grits definitely had an interesting flavor, but the chicken, egg, and buffalo combo was really delicious. Amy went with the chicken and French toast, which was pretty phenomenal. The fried chicken balanced with the sweetness of the syrup and challah bread really well. I went with the traditional HBFC sandwich and declare this the best dish of all three. Made on a soft bun, the fried chicken is cooked to perfection. Add their slaw, some hot sauce, and you've got one hell of a fried chicken sandwich. It became extremely messy to eat, but totally worth it. For our sides, we went with the smashed potatoes, which were really more like soupy mashed potatoes that had a delicious chicken gravy flavor. We also had the pimento mac 'n cheese which is very unique, you don't find pimento in too many dishes! Really tasty and very rich. The kale and cabbage slaw rounded out our sides, tangy and very tasty, this was a great compliment to the other rich sides we ordered. I have to say, the chicken is clearly the star here. I think the sides were inventive and tasty, but I couldn't get enough of the chicken.Overall, Honey Butter shines not only in its chicken, but in other unique touches, such as the Rare Cellar iced tea they serve. The restaurant is warm, open and the customer service is fantastic. Additionally, you're getting quality foods that are clearly made with lots of love. Will definitely be back for more chicken!"
"First of all,I have to say that I am very pleased to see new restaurants like Honey Butter  Fried Chicken and Parachute  opening up in Avondale,very exciting.Even though I do not live in the neighborhood, I pass this place almost every day while driving to work.  Finally I decided to check it out. YAY! I I AM A FAN!Food was pretty good,not the BEST Fried Chicken I ever had,but still pretty impressive.  I tried several things so far and my absolute favorite is BRUNCH CHICKEN & GRITS! Their side dishes are pretty tasty too,I would recommend PIMENTO MAC'N CHEESE and KALE AND CABBAGE SLAW.  Definitely great neighborhood eatery with good comfort food,reasonable prices and very friendly staff!"
"This place offers solid fried chicken. Is it the best in the city...no but it's good and worth trying.I got the 2-piece meal which comes with 2 pieces of chicken and two of their cornbread muffins. I got a leg and a boneless breast. It has good flavor and you're supposed to spread the honey butter on the chicken. I tried that and didn't care for it. For the price you pay, I think a side should be included in the cost of the meal. $8 for two average size pieces of chicken seems to be a stretch. I got the mashed potatoes which were delicious and were just under $3 extra.We also split an order of wings which were fine but nothing amazing. They have a good beer selection and we didn't have to wait very long to get seated.Overall it's worth a try, but for better fried chicken I'd try The Roost, Harold's or the very best is The Chicken Shack in Evanston."
Pretty damn tasty chicken. Nicely fried and super crispy. The honey butter was a perfect accompaniment. Try the mac and cheese. :)
"I was really excited to try this place, was thinking that the fried chicken was going to blow me away. I hate to say that I didn't think it was that great, it's not bad, a little over priced but not bad. I have to say I expected it to be a lot fancier too, anyways, it's the type of restaurant that you order your food then sit and it's brought over to you.I ordered 2 pieces of chicken that come with a tiny piece of corn bread for $15 and a side of grits, which you have to pay extra for. I will say the grits were quite delicious, they were buttery and are topped with chicken crackling, very tasty. The chicken is just good, they serve it with some butter that I guess is laced with honey, that you spread on the chicken, I will say the chicken breast was surprisingly moist. Oh and the lemonade is very good, all in all its good food,  I just think it's over priced."
Love it! Food is great. Never dined in always carry out. If you like fried chicken do not miss this!
"I do love my fried chicken. I don't know if it's worth all the hype and wait tho...so I took one star away.Got the fried chicken dinner with the slaw and the pimento mac n cheese. It comes with these tiny little corn bread muffins. I think the corn bread was the best part, aside from the flavorful fried chicken. Btw, the side portions are rather small for the price.DO come to check out what the hype is about, but DON'T wait in line for too long. If you pass by and see that the line is out the door, just try for another time. It's probably not worth waiting more than 30 minutes..."
"I waited for all of the hoopla to settle before wandering over to HBFC.  The Mrs. and I took our time reading the company's site and mission statement and were enthusiastic about supporting a company that makes a concerted effort to make a difference and take care of its people.  Kudos to that.  The chicken was outstanding and I thought for sure an 8 pc wouldn't be enough for 3 of us with sides but was mistaken, we only made it about 2/3 way through the chicken but killed the sides.  Regarding those, they are smaller as everyone has stated but I'm ok with that.  Our country could use a curbing of the mixing bowl portions we're all used to.  We've been back twice and those we've brought with share the same feelings.  Other reviews have better descriptions of the food, give em a shot!"
"I'm sad to say that HBFC is just ok. I came here craving chicken and it didn't satisfy. Between our party we had fried chicken, lemonades, fountain soda and the blackened chicken salad. I absolutely agree that the honey butter MAKES the fried chicken but the salad was horrible. I could've made the same thing at home for 10 dollars less."
"I was dragged here by a skinny hipster.   What could he know about food? I was all ready to hate all over Honey Butter Fried Chicken.  I thought it would be the same let down Smalls, Smoke Shack around the corner was. Then I saw the prices.  Wtf is this pretentious hipster bullshit?Then I met the people there.  Then I knew.  This place gets all this hype because the staff are so damn nice.  They're friendly and helpful and patient.  I don't want to pay $15 for friendly staff!  I don't care.  Let's just go!But, amazingly, the chicken ended up being totally worth it.  It wasn't trendy or pseudo creative.  It didn't pander to what's popular.  It was plain, simple, and just really good.  I wish I could describe *how* it was good, but I can't.  Just picture the run of the mill, regular plain fried chicken you've had.  Then imagine it was made in heaven or something.  And you've got Honey Butter Fried Chicken.  There's nothing else to be said."
"The hype finally got to me, I had finally read too much about this place to not try it out for myself. Yesterday, I happened to be downtown with some spare time. I dragged the bf and we arrived at 4:45. One lone person was in line and the joint opens at 5 sharp. My bf doubted me, no way there was going to be a line down the street in this 25 degree weather. Sure enough, at 5:55 the line was down the block and we were in it. They opened the doors at 5:00 pm, we left at 5:30 pm and the line was still down the block. We waited in line for about 5 minutes and were able to get one of the very small tables. The staff has a policy of not sitting before you place your order and I appreciate that. All the people behind us ran for tables while a loved one waited in line and they were kindly directed back to the line. I'm sorry but I was in line before you and I expect to sit before you do, sorry it that sounds witchy. I ordered the two piece fried chicken that comes with a piece of cornbread. My bf got the fried chicken sandwich with picked jalapeño slaw on a buttered  bun. We ordered the smashed potatoes with chicken fat gravy and the apple cranberry dump cake (cobbler but with cake) for dessert. I got the special rare cellar iced tea, this week it happened to be green pomegranate ice tea. We ended up spending $30 for two including a 10% tip. The two pieces of fried chicken were $8 as was the sandwich, a bit pricey but just wait until you dig in. We took our number and sat at one of the very small and close tables. There is not a lot of room/seating in this place.About ten minutes later our order came out. My chicken came with a little cup of the honey butter which I was told to spread all over my chicken with a knife. I kind of expected it to be honey butter dipping sauce, but no worries I was willing to work. The bf's sandwich came with some sauce on it but he added some of my honey butter just to try it. The butter melted into the crinkly skin and I was in heaven. I got a leg and a thigh, the leg obviously had a bone but the thigh did not. The cornbread was very small, about half the size of a Boston Market cornbread but good with some honey butter. The batter isn't too thick and the chicken was moist and absolutely delicious with some honey butter. The bf's sandwich was good but he was lusting after my chicken. The sides were a different story. The potatoes we thought were extremely bland and tasteless. Why four stars still? THE DUMP CAKE! BUY IT!!!! It was amazing, warm and gooey, enough to share and oh so decadent and delicious. I normally don't like cobbler or warm dessert but this stuff is the bomb. In the summer they should add some vanilla ice-cream. The bf loved it as well, it definitely made up for the potatoes. We want to go back and try the grits. They also had an impressive list of mixed drinks and the bartender was lively with a handlebar mustache. The bar area is also small with some high top tables. However, the patio looked amazing, we'll be back in warmer weather to enjoy some drinks. The staff was friendly, they had two registers working and one guy with an iPad taking credit card orders. The food also came out fast and fresh. They aren't open on Tuesdays so beware. I bought into this place hook, line, and sinker."
"Great place for fried chicken, it was soft and juicy, and the skin nice and crispy, all the sides were good too, we got the mac and cheese, creamed corn, wings and grits, all of which were solid, as were the sauces, there was a honey butter one, and two others that i can't remember the name of, but they were both very tasty, the biscuits that come with the chicken are small, but good, kinda like munchies, the only downside might be the sides are kinda small, but it's not a huge deal, also a pretty good beer selection, I got one called big red coq, which was very fun to say lol"
"In my biploar eating habits, I would consider myself an absolute expert in gasto/experimental cooking and fried chicken.  For whatever reason my spidey senses always told me there was no rush to hit up HBF, and once again I was correct.  I arrived on a Saturday at 5, I was lucky to be ordered and was seated in under 15 minutes.  We ordered the 4 piece, mac and cheese, collards and the chicken sandwich.  Food arrived quickly and thankfully in the too cramped dining room.  If I were to use one word to describe my experience, it would be whelming.  Its fried chicken, its going to be edible. However, it was forgettable and not worth visiting again. EVERYTHING was under seasoned.  Its almost accomplishment worthy to under season every item, but HBF managed to do it.  The corn muffin was dry, had no flavor and totally lacked the small sweetness of a corn muffin. The collards had no pork flavor at all, it was basically soggy leaves. The mac and cheese looked and tasted like Kraft. The chicken, while I appreciated the generous portion size, tons of white meat and lack of bones, it literally had no flavor at all. I got bites of paprika, but without the honey butter it had no taste. The chicken sandwich was the best item, I'd have again but wouldn't seek out. The butter was outstanding, so at least they have that. However, I'm thinking that is so good it handicaps their other food, or they know people put it on everything so why bother making anything else taste great.So many other great fried chicken places, this place isn't worth visiting."
"5 stars for the fried chicken. I thought it was the best fried chicken I've ever had. Corn muffins delicious. Got sides: Mac, sweet potatoes and mashed potatoes those were just so so. Staff very friendly. Will definitely return."
"As it was my first visit, I went with the 2 piece meal and a side of the pimento Mac n cheese. Delicious chicken, Mac n cheese and homemade sodas/tea! The staff was super friendly and service was awesome. I'll definitely be back to try brunch and a cocktail (or two)."
The fried chicken with butter is cool and different but overpriced. I was not a fan of the of the cornbread but the mac and cheese was tasty. Now the chicken wings that they have are very tasty and would differently recommend.  Over all if I felt like balling out of control I would go back .
"I came here for an early dinner, ordered immediately, and was able to find a nice seat on their beautiful patio (seriously though, the patio is lovely). Shortly after we arrived the place started filling up until there was a considerable wait, so take that into consideration. The staff here takes your order, brings you your food and otherwise lets you be, which I majorly appreciated. My boyfriend and I split the 4-piece chicken meal, cornbread muffins included. On the side we ordered smashed potatoes, collard greens, and mac & cheese. The cornbread muffins were great with the honey-butter, but I personally found the chicken was just as good without. That being said, my boyfriend loooooved the honey butter.* The sides were pretty good, but neither of us really cared for the mac & cheese. It was good, but I wouldn't get too excited about it. The beer is cheap and the cocktails are strong. Both the Damn Good Sweet Tea and Cherry Hill Pop are delicious. The best part of the meal was the Cherry Cobbler with Limed Whipped Cream. I think they change their cobblers on a rotating basis, and I wouldn't mind trying others based on how sensational this one was. This place is a worth a try. *I've always found fried chicken tastes better with straight up honey, so maybe that's why the honey butter didn't really do it for me."
"Great twists on classics, including a great glazed, sweet chili wing dish. I love how eco-friendly this restaurant is, and their patio area is super cute with picnic tables alongside a wall decorated with fridge magnets. I recommend storing up on honey butter and biscuits which were delightful."
"Smh...why is this place so.....GOOD! OMG, so I found this place on Foursquare and I noticed its right down the street from where I work. Its a nice day today, so I decided to walk and check this place out. I love how the menus are on the trays on the wall - that was cute. The guy who took my order was super nice and helped me through the menu. You better not sit down though until you've received your number. Nice, small intimate spot and my food came out in a hurry! Time to grub! The chicken had this crunchy cajun-y spice to it which made it really good. I put the honey butter on it AND hot sauce. Made it EVEN BETTER!! I got the mac n cheese as a side and I love the bread crumbs on the top. You have to walk to the back to get a fountain beverage and even the soda had an interesting taste. It was good also.Yea, I'm a fan and I'll definitely be back...oh I read some reviews that the chicken was dry...ummm yea no. Moist and crunchy...just the way I like it!"
"FRIED CHICKEN. What more could you ask for? The fried chicken is nice and crispy,  and the meat is flavorful. The honey butter is a nice gimmick that is a bit hard on my heart, but despite that I've eaten here too many times to count in the past month that I feel a bit ashamed. The sides are really disappointing - $3.50 for a small side that won't do much isn't my idea of a fun time. The prices here I'm general are kind of crazy, as a meal for 3 people was about $60 (we ordered an 8 piece and 3 sides! No drinks).  Service is alright, I don't understand the whole ""tipping before you are even served"" thing. But we will roll with it for now.The chicken itself holds up, which is why I think it deserves high marks and I am happy that they source their food locally, but it's a bit hard on the wallet so it'll have to be reserved for splurging only."
"Loooove. Equally happy and not happy that this isn't closer to where I live (I'm sure I'd be enormous if I could make this a weekly trip.)I ordered the two-piece fried chicken, which came with a corn muffin and a side of honey butter, along with the mac and cheese. The verdict: skip the mac and cheese in favor of another corn muffin (or three), plus an extra side of honey butter. The mac and cheese was just mediocre, but the corn muffins were actually one of my favorite things on the plate.The chicken itself was delicious and super moist on the inside despite being white meat, which can easily get too dry while cooking. The honey butter was phenomenal and I'll be dreaming about it until I can make it back up to this restaurant.All in all, a very pleasant experience, and I'll be bringing friends here for months to come."
"Way overpriced.  Just ridiculous.  $30 for two chicken sandwiches and two orders of Mac n' Cheese.  Unreal.   The honey butter chicken sandwiches were average at best.  To be honest, the best part of the sandwich was the bun.  Sandwich was greasy and unexpectedly consisted of dark meat.  The pimento Mac n' Cheese however was excellent.  Very tasty and loaded with cheesy flavor.  If you do go here, I strongly recommend it. I was not impressed at all with the paper plates and cheap paper towels provided for your overpriced meal.  I can only imagine the profits this place is raking in with such a low overhead cost.  The most EXTREMELY annoying part of this experience, my first (and last) at the restaurant btw, was declaring a tip amount at the time of pre-paying for your meal, before your meal arrives or even being seated for that matter. What's that all about?   When you order and pay for your meal, the cashier asks you to declare an amount you would like to tip, which includes choices of 10%, 15% and 20% on the touch screen.  You are requested to push or touch the percentage amount at that time.  Not cool."
"Best bought fried chicken I had in years.  I was on my way to the airport from my granddaughter's volleyball game and my daughter suggested to grab something form Honey Butter instead of a JJ. Glad I listened.I picked up 4-pieces, Schmaltz smashed potatoes, pimento mac'n cheese, and kale and cabbage slaw.  Wow, the aroma took over the care, so I munched on a corn muffin and then could not help it and started on the chicken and a few spoons of the side dishes.   I had to stop myself to leave some for my husband that was arriving from Arkansas. This meal was so good that even though we were on our way home, since there was a lot of traffic at O'Hare, we switched seats so I could pass him food while he was driving.  After finishing the chicken I had another corn muffin but this time with the honey butter... yum, no dessert needed. After lunch today I had the leftover muffins with honey butter.  I will be there again we were both impress with the food.  I have my eye on the chicken & grits"
"The chicken was ok. We ordered it take out.  It was small portions for the price of the sides. But it was good. Just like the other reviewers the tipping here is so off putting, I won't come back. I placed my order and got the 15, 20, 25 percent pre-service tip prompt for my takeout order on the ipad. It's awkward. So I tipped the ipad. Then when I waited for my takeout, the girl lingered around, as if I was supposed to tip her again. Geeze. Not cool. Very uncool.I also didn't love that the chicken was boneless. It was kind of like giant chicken nuggets. Good but not great."
I don't think I can rave about this place anymore than I already do. Anytime someone comes to visit I take them here. Something about slathering some delicious butter on your chicken makes you feel so bad but it just tastes so damn good. Highly recommended and I love love the sweet potato salad.
"Went in for a quick brunch w a couple friends, ordered and decided to sit at the bar to have a cocktail as well. Bartender was pretty knowledgeable about the place in general, as well as being super friendly. Inside is not too big, could def get crowded fast. Decent size patio for warmer months w picnic tables. Chicken was top notch, and so were the two drinks I had. Also the homemade hot sauce was on point!"
This restaurant was easy to find. It had nice counter service and very attentive staff. I had me a funny buffalo chicken and peanut butter cobbler both very good. I would definitely recommend this place for anybody that wants nice chicken sandwich and a good dessert. The prices for reasonable.
"Decent crispy chicken, but the honey butter is an unnecessary accouterments to cover up the fact that the chicken is just decent flavored fried chicken. My wallet is offended by the prices."
"This is still the best chicken in town. I have tried various places and none of it offers the tenderness and flavor that HBFC offers. Other reviewers complain about the sidedish, but if you are not here for the chicken, why are you here? Seriously. Now opens for lunch, but closes on Monday and Tuesday."
"The hype! Oh lord the hype. But hell, it was my birthday and I love fried chicken, and am always willing to try something new.Luckily for the gf and I the line wasn't too long, but it was a Wednesday night. The wait wasn't long and the employees were very nice. As for our food:Bread pudding - meh, kind of mushy and dryPimento mac and cheese - pretty good. Not the greatest mac I've had recently, but a worthy sideThai creamed corn - outstanding. I love Thai curry, and putting it on corn just brings so many levels to it. Sweet, spicy, creamy; I want a bucket of this stuffThe chicken - very juicy and flavor. I'd say it was strong enough to stand on its own, but the honey butter spread puts it over the edge. I'd never thought about buttering my fried chicken before because I weigh south of 300 pounds, but maybe I've been going about this all wrong. Butter all the things!What truly holds HBFC from greatness is the price. As fried chicken has been elevated from common food to more haute cuisine, so has the price. The three side platter is pretty much worth the price. But $8 for two pieces of chicken? Yes it's good, and it's not really fair to compare HBFC to Popeye's or the Colonel, but that's still a whole lot of cash. Also, if leaving the bones in could lead to a lower price, I'm all for it (not to mention adding more flavor).Possibly the most egregious pricing on the menu comes from the Daily Pickle. Yes, the pickled veggies add a nice sour punch to the meal, much like pickled ginger when eating sushi. But for two dollars? It may not seem like much, but that $2 gets you a tiny ketchup-dip-cup-sized worth of the stuff."
"My friend and I came here late on a Thursday night for some chicken. It was ok but seriously overpriced. I had the two piece with a side and my total came up to about $14. It was also $9 for a bottle of Goose Island Sofie. Are you serious? I can get a 4 pack for $10.99... Ridiculous. Overall, pretty good but the price really drives people away. Not worth it."
"You got to love half day Fridays and daycare. Me and the misses finally had time to check this place out. Only a year behind most of our friends. And I will admit that on that day Hot Doug's was on my mind. Once we saw the line we said how about fried chicken? I don't regret our decision. The chicken was moist, the skin was crisp and flavorful with a nice crunch. And who can forget about the cornbread biscuits. I do wish they were bigger but it's easy enough to add a few extra to your order for an affordable cost. Not sure when I will be back, but I will definitely be back for sure."
Amish chickens! Had the broiled chicken and grits and the sweet biscuit. To die for! Six of us there for lunch and not one of us was dissatisfied. Nice notes on table about the business model. Small but good beer selection. Great outdoor seating!
"This place is off the beaten path which would be fine if it was amazing.Chicken WAS very tasty with the honey butter but there was no consistency with the pieces; some boneless, some not.We ordered mac & cheese, grits and dump cake (dessert). All of which left MUCH to be desired.Patio had a nice ambience AT FIRST, then we saw a mouse run out from the building directly behind the patio.Needless to say we bolted and will probably never return."
"The butter is amazing.  I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing that the thing I remember most, is the butter. But. it was amazing.The chicken was good.  Nothing SO SO special that I can't put it into words.  It was fresh and juicy.  This is a personal preference, but I do wish that the chicken was so hot, that i burned my fingers on it, or my mouth.  I couldn't tell if it was to order, or if they just let it sit after we ordered it to cool.  The cornbread was pretty yummy.  I did buy more to take home...but I admit, it was to finish off the butter that I took home with me."
"Love this place! The chicken is flavorful and tender, the honey butter is delicious without being overly sweet, and the corn muffins are the perfect touch. The Mac and cheese has a taste of jalapeño, which was very different, but appreciated. All ingredients are locally sourced and they list all of their providers on the wall. Beer, wine, whiskey available. Also has a fantastic patio! Can't wait to come back!"
"The food, staff, and drinks are very Good. The sides we never skip are the corn and the pomegranate salad. We have never been inclined to order sandwiches since we're very satisfied with the pieces of chicken. Reason I can't give it five starts is due to the prices which are very steep."
I.no.whats wrong Fried chicken with no soul = blandness 28$ of fried chicken that taste like water
"Womp, Womp. Y'all love it. I don't love it. Y'all made me run here. I'd say slooooow down, cowpoke. Y'all have funky tastebuds. I have wonky tastebuds? It must be, 'cuz something is just off.However, it was also off for my two other dining companions, because they were neither wowed, nor bowled over, nor singing the praises of honey... mixed... with butter. Revolutionary? I was expecting something more saucy, more dip friendly, but nah... it's just plain 'ol butter, mixed with honey, that you can spread with a knife onto your chicken. And that's kinda awkward. I hate to not sing the praises of this place because I've been a fan of Sunday Dinner Club for years and would love to support their small business venture... but, I just. didn't. like. it. Our 8-piece chicken 'meal' with 3 sides (and 3 sodas) came in at a staggering $55.00, yet, with nary a single piece of white meat in sight. FIFTY FIVE BUCKS and alls we gotz was legs and thighs. The cheap seats of poultry. Boo!Then there were the sides: sweet potato salad (bland), mac 'n cheese (good, not great) and roasted Chinese broccoli (so boring it looked virtually untouched at go home time). Three small sides and not a single one polished off by three hungry food enthusiasts.What happened? What did we miss? Apparently, everything. Don't take my word for it, but I think HBFC is a pass. The best thing I had was the Goose Island Spicy Ginger Soda. Out of a fountain! Yay?"
The best thing I can say about HBFC is that the chicken pieces (I had a thigh & a leg) were the largest i've had at a chain in years.That was the best thing - the chicken texture was good but rather lacking in flavor & at over $8.00 dollars for 2 pieces + 2 miniature & rather dry corn muffins was terribly over priced.I also ordered a side of PIMENTO MAC'N CHEESE which had the consistency gooey over cooked pasta covered in a garlicky cheese sauce that that reeked of artificial garlic flavor (I am a garlic lover - but this was not real garlic) & the sauce was so thick that it literally coated my tongue and teeth. Just awful.It appears that HBFC is big on marketing sizzle but lacking in delivering the real meat.
"Cute place, we happened to walk in right when they were opening.. so we didn't have to wait in line that long (7 mins) while we were waiting there was an employee walking through the line and answering any questions we had about the menu, which was nice. We ordered the chicken of course, chicken grits, mac and cheese, corn, and nachos. The butter was amazing and the best thing on the menu, I could've had just the butter and corn bread (maybe it was bread, not sure what it was) and been satisfied. The food was a bit on the oily side - go figure! Wasn't too fond of the nachos, they had a sweet sauce mixed in their maybe, so it was on the sweet side, as for the chicken grits - the mashed potato part seemed bland.. so not one of my favorite things on the menu. The corn and max and cheese were amaze! For those of you that love fried chicken you must check out this place."
"Absolutely delicious chicken, and interesting sides. A little pricey, &, because we went on a Saturday, unbelievably crowded! The food is worth the trip, however, but I recommend take out unless you really like being close up on your fellow human beings!"
I have no idea why there are only 3.5 stars on this place. I don't even want to read the other low reviews because I'm sure I'll just get frustrated with pickiness. But this place has put fried chicken in a whole new perspective for me. Bottom line: Amazing. Go here. It's well worth educating yourself on how unique this place is and the tastiness of their chicken.
"Me: ""Hey you want to check out this new chicken place by us? it looks kinda hipsterish in this neighborhood, but I like the name.""Friend: ""Sure, you think we need to call in for reservations?""Me: ""Nah, it's Sunday, don't think it'll be that busy.""WRONG. (not that you can get reservations, you can't even call ahead for carryout....)The line was out the door, but it isn't that bad, maybe 15 -20 minutes, but the buzz in this neighborhood was surprising. Joining the ranks of Hot Doug's and Kuma's, HBFC fits right in. Everyone in line was super excited to try out fried chicken- I didn't realize it was a ""thing"" after hearing about the long wait at Parson's.My thoughts - good chicken, juicy, good crisp crust, sorta what you expect if you had a gourmand making you fried chicken and wasn't greasy. The butter is a extravagant add on that makes it top notch. Pricey as it is, I would still come back again for the chicken, the 3 sides ranged from okay to  meh - next time skip it and go for dessert and drinks instead.Stringy lights, funky bench seating, heat lamps, all you can drink Boylan -  this patio is awesome!"
"The name definitely caught my eye with this place. As I walk in, I see a line all the way to the entrance. Hmm...seems promising. As I get closer to the overhead menu, I go on and figure out my choices. 8 piece chicken for $28!! If my math serves me right, that's shy of $3 a piece. My wife and I order the 8 piece, a side of their specialty Mac and Cheese for our daughter, and a couple of Half Acre IPA's. Total bill: a whopping $49. As we get ourselves situated and seated, we patiently wait. Here comes the chicken. Drumroll please....womp womp....we were totally not impressed. I mean don't get me wrong. The chicken was crispy, juicy, not greasy. Maybe it was just me having an epiphany. I'm just a Popeye's Chicken kind-of-guy. $49 would've gotten me 20 pcs and 5 large sides over there. My wife seemed to think the same. But hey, that's why she's my wifey. Lol. Although, let me note: the honey butter is definitely a must-try. Good chicken, awesome butter, just not for that price."
"I stood in line for fried chicken. And it was worth every tasty morsel. My gal Joanne W and I arrived a bit before opening and there was already a line of about 20 people in front of us. Once they opened the doors (to cheers of course) they handed out some paper menus so we could start drooling, er trying to decide what to order. The menu is pretty basic, chicken, a few sides and a couple dessert options.  But don't forget to check out the menu board for their daily specials. I was tempted to get the chicken pot pie (one of the specials) but figured I should just start with chicken first.I opted for the 4 piece, 2 sides (creamed corn and kale/cabbage slaw)  and the Avondale Ginger Mule for my drink. There were at times 2 cashiers that took orders to help the line move. I don't think we waited for more 30minutes in line before we ordered.  Once you order, you get your number and get your drink at the soda machine or at the bar where they will mix up your drink.  Then set yourself down and your food is brought out to you. If its super crowded I expect folks might have to start sharing tables. But with the patio open that day, we snagged picnic table seating easily outside. It was a bit windy but they had the portable warmers out to cut the chill. The chicken was delicious. Yes, put the honey butter on it and take a bite. I'm sure my sigh of contentment was heard on Elston. So very good. Crispy and juicy. The honey butter gives it a sweetness and richness that works well with the paprika that is sprinkled on top of the chix. The sides were quite delicious as well. They are on the small side but looking back, next time I'll go with the 3 side deal. Go big or go home. The creamed corn delicious. It's is not so creamy like my fave place in Texas (Rudys!) but topped with a bit of green curry and it gave it a very nice dimension of flavor. The slaw was also very good. Crunchy and fresh, it was a perfect side for the chicken. I got to try the dessert of the day, plum dump cake, and it was very good as well. Sweetness and tartness, again a perfect ending to a delicious meal. The chicken held up pretty well for leftovers. I missed getting some extra honey butter for it and it was still ok without it. Service was smiley and friendly throughout. Future visits are definitely in the works."
"I was really hungry so I've always wanted to try this place out. I got the 4 piece chicken w/ 3 corn muffins and the Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was not so great, I had better Mac n cheese. As for the corn muffins and chicken they were pretty good. If I'd go back here I would only recommend the chicken and corn muffins."
"I have been waiting to try this place since it opened. It did not disappoint. The folks that work there are so incredibly nice and very helpful. I ordered the two piece. In addition I ordered the mashed potatoes, kale salad and the Mac & Cheese. The chicken is outstanding. Smearing the honey butter right on the chicken before each bite is pure genius. The mashed potatoes were REAL, and out of this world. When I saw the lemon zest on the potatoes, I was not sure how it would work. Trust me, it worked! The kale salad was the biggest disappointment. I might just prefer that not as a side, but as a light meal. The pimento Mac & Cheese was good. Strong flavors in that dish. You gotta love pimento cheese in order to like it. But that chicken can not be beat. The BEST you will ever have. There are many more things on the menu I have yet to try......I will return as soon as I can!!"
Was fantastic.  Great place great people and oh my god the chicken is good.  Love the not to.greasy with spicy slaw.  Check it out for sure and will be grabbing on way back from work when.i.can
"The chicken is memorable for the wrong reasons. It's memorable for the price tag, as in ""Why did I spend this much money on dry, okay, but not amazing chicken that requires an enhancement on the side to complete the experience?"" The honey butter is delicious and we put that on our tiny little corn nibblers, I mean muffins, instead of the chicken because we weren't so fond of it on the chicken. The sides are alright. We had the mac & cheese, which has a chalky aftertaste that might remind you of what happens when you don't mix the powder in your Kraft mac & cheese enough. The slaw was very nice. But again, the portions were tiny for the price. There are places that charge top dollar for food that should seemingly have a lower price point, because what they do with the food is so different and so special that it's worth the price. Then there are places that charge top dollar for food that should have a lower price point because they want to keep a particular ambiance going and pay their high-priced rent. HBFC is the latter of the two. The space doesn't provide an environment that evokes an experience deeming the price tag. Seating is little more than Crate & Barrel/Ikea-like cafeteria style seating. It's not a full-service restaurant. There are other restaurants that provide better, more authentic, tasty food with decent portions, that are full-service and don't have the hefty price tag. I don't think I will be going over there again any time soon."
"Don't get me wrong, it was good, but then again, it was only fried chicken.  The honey butter used to spread on the fried chicken is interesting but, it's only fried chicken.  I do not understand why people are willing to wait in line for close to an hour, struggle to find a table in the limited dining area, and then pay more than double what you pay elsewhere for fried chicken.  Sides were ok and nothing really screamed at me.  We ordered out for a party of 5 so we went with:Two 8 piece chickenTwo triple combo sides1 order of grits.  Our bill was just a few dollars shy of $100.  This is fried chicken!!! Since when did it costs $20 (per person) to eat fried chicken.   It was worth the experience, but I probably can not justify paying this much to clog my arteries."
"We saw the restaurant on ""check please""and were excited to try it, but...  We were very unsatisfied with everything we ordered.  The portions were small the Chicken was dry and over priced.   The drinks were horrible. Very hectic atmosphere and not once anyone came up to us to ask if. We need it something.  We asked for a side of ketchup and they didn't have any.   I have to say I would not go back or recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Sorry"
"Really good. More dining space than I originally anticipated. The patio was great.And we went early so it was really peaceful. A completely different dining experience than Parson's, this seems a little more casual and laid back. Also, more family friendly. It was relaxing eating outside, but I'm sure it would get busy later.The chicken was good, of course the honey butter adds to it. The mac and cheese was excellent.Definitely coming back."
awesome fried chicken. We liked kale-cabbage slaw and creamed corn with thai curry too. Definitely this would be my place for fried chickens :)
"I usually never try to hit up a place when they first open as I hate waiting in lines . The homie An P kept raving about this place and even Nick M gave his stamp of approval so I had to check this joint out quick, fast and a hurry. We decided to go on a rainy day after work. A friend of ours got there before us and let us know that the line was to the door around 5:30. Once we got there, the line was still @ the door but the place wasn't that big so I didn't think we would be in line very long. We stood in line maybe 10 minutes which wasn't bad.I ordered the two piece chicken dinner (breast and leg) which came with the very popular honey butter and a corn muffin. The chicken was very good and had a nice flavor to it and the honey butter definitely gave an additional delicious touch to it. There is nothing better than spreading that honey butter over the chicken.The corn muffin was pretty damn good as well. I decided to order the ""kick ass iced tea"" which is spiked with vodka, due to a trustworthy recommendation. You could taste the alcohol but it wasn't too strong. I also ordered a tall can of Hamms beer...yumm! They move pretty quick here as my food arrived 5 mins after I sat down. It was a shame that we weren't able to sit on the patio, but the storm would not allow it. Staff was very friendly and even gave us free chicken after our meal due to my buddy complaining that his chicken wasn't as crispy as the first two times he had come. We went to a local bar afterwards because of the storm. After having a few drinks at the bar, I came back to Honey Butter Fried Chicken for another 2 piece. Yeah I liked it and it was that good."
"I'm usually a Church's Chicken kind of guy, and Honey Butter is $2 more. ($6 for 2-piece/white meal @ Church's vs $8 2-piece @ Honey Butter as of may '14) But here's what I got with that $2 extra:Better chicken. (local, farm raised, never frozen or processed, butchered in-house) Honey butter, whipped and sweet. Awesome staff, and a company that cares about its workers, the community and the environment. If you want to know why the breasts/thighs are boneless (as I did) they explain it on their website.Definitely worth $2 more than Church's, and $1 more than KFC for a 2 piece meal."
"I LOVE THIS PLACE!I love the chicken and cornbread muffins covered in honey butter! I have always been a fan of honey on my chicken and I feel like this place gets me!  I also am a fan of the schmaltz potatoes and my fiancee loves the mac n' cheese, and he is very picky about his mac n' cheese! Their strawberry lemonade is a go-to as well!It is so convenient that the chicken is boneless!The service is always great.I wish it was not as expensive."
I LOVE FRIED CHICKEN. I didn't love this place. I was dreaming about Honey Butter Fried Chicken and would look at the menu once in awhile. The chicken was eh.. The mac was eh.. The corn was probably the highlight.. And the patio is pretty cool. I don't think I'll be back but I am glad I tried it.
"HBFC, I love you so much.Went on a Wednesday night around 7:30. No wait.-Chicken is DELICIOUS, moist, crispy outside.-The three sides for $11 is great for two people. We had the mashed potatoes, creamed corn and mac & cheese. All on point.-Cute, yummy corn muffins and that butter...WHAT.-There was a blueberry something something for dessert that night and it was divine.Food came out quickly and we were given free cookies for moving over to accommodate a party of 5.I will be back. Hopefully soon."
"HONEY. BUTTER. FRIED. CHICKEN.Brought to you by the creators of Sunday Night Dinner Club, Honey Butter Fried Chicken is the newest Avondale institution.  Knowing the grand opening would be a flurry this weekend, I was more than delighted to find out they were actually open Thursday and Friday!  Given these facts, I decided to head on immediately to Honey Butter Fried Chicken after work even if it meant eating by myself (something I rarely if ever allow myself to do)!!!6pm line?  Two people stood between me and ordering some Honey Butter Fried Chicken.  They didn't know what they wanted to order so they let me order half a fried chicken and a 3 side meal consisting of mac n cheese, slaw, and sweet potato salad.   I added an iced tea which was delicious and was given direction where to get the iced tea.Much to my surprise there was a beautiful patio waiting for me in the back!! Outside in the big patio there were maybe four occupied tables with plenty of space for me to choose.  I sat myself in the middle of the patio at my very own gigantic wooden table and saw Nick M. walk by who stopped by for a seat.  Not too long after, Nikki C. came on over and we were all excited to nosh on fried chx. When my fried chicken came out I instantly had to take pictures of this momentous occasion.  Fiercely deep fried chicken was glistening in the afternoon dusk and I moved on to the iced tea.  The pimenta mac n cheese was a delight to eat while the sweet potato salad was surprisingly delicious.  I was impressed with the slaw due to its crispiness and I didn't feel like I was going to die after eating it.Now the real trick to Honey Butter Fried Chicken is that they actually give you some honey butter to apply on the fried chicken.  I somehow would have missed this point had it not been printed on a menu outside to spread honey butter on the fried chicken.  At first I felt guilty at adding more saturated fat to my already astronomical high calorie dinner, but the honey butter was NOT to be denied!!! Double sided and doused with honey butter, my fried chicken was nearing perfection.Watching the butter melt into the fried chicken, I moved on to the sides and noshed down the mac n cheese in quick order.  Shifting back over to the now truly honey butter fried chicken I held a piece up and just marveled at the fried deliciousness I was about to bite into.  ***CRUNCH***  The juices let me know this chicken was moist and cooked with care and precision.  Very few fried chickens can achieve this graceful balance of CRUNCH and WET as such qualities are diametrically opposed.  This chicken was delicious and I could not stop eating the chicken even after two MASSIVE pieces of breast and drumstick.  Being quite full my body said, ""No!"" but my mind said, ""YES!""  I ate a third piece of Honey Butter Fried Chicken and found it still to be crisp still to be moist and still to be an exciting piece of food to even just hold in your hand.  I spent three hours at Honey Butter Fried Chicken.  After Nikki C. and Nick M. bounced, I ran into a friend who said he'd meet me much later.  Hungry for his chicken he went out to the patio with me which became packed for the rest of the evening.  Tables were modular and actually could be expanded to double the seating capacity.  The green wall next to the patio reminded me of the Friendly Confines while the lines of light bulbs overhead provided a soft and ambient light.  A friend and his sister then showed up and dinner kept going on and on.  Servers came by frequently to check on everything and I was impressed with their cordiality and professionalism. Eventually the patio got full people not using their entire table were splitting with other folks.  It was polite, there was plenty of room, and people behaved.Ask me tomorrow if I am the mayor and the duke and the answer will likely be a  resounding YES!"
"The name drew me in! I've been here twice but have not enjoyed myself either time due to extreme hangovers. The atmosphere is great, especially being able to sit outside. Private bathrooms are a plus. I do not recommend the soda if you have had too much to drink the night before. Unfortunately I have not been able to keep any of the food down but I aim to keep on trying. Thanks Honey Butter Fried Chicken! P.S. Sorry about the mess I made on the way out"
"Dang this place isn't even officially open yet and my peeps are reviewing the hell out of this place!Sad that La Finca closed. Ecstatic that Honey Butter opened in it's place.  La Finca was there for 20+ years, so there's some big shoes to fill.  I'm positive the peeps from Sunday Dinner Club will do awesome things!  Congrats to them on opening this place!Ok so now let's get to the main event, the chicken.  Really, it's good.  Like stupid good.  And honey butter? I know this will sound dumb, but it reminded me of dipping Bennigan's biscuits in honey butter, just with chicken.  Oh no he didn't! Did Wayne Brady just drop a reference to Bennigan's in his Honey Butter review?! I think he did.  The chicken tinga tostada was great as well.  Get that as an app to the chicken. Some people were using a knife and fork to eat the chicken.  I checked my respectability at the door and straight up dipped the chicken in the honey butter and ate with my hands.  So gangster!Out of all the items on the menu, the Chinese Broccoli was the most delicious. I hope it makes it onto the regular menu.The soda fountain has some inspired selections such as Goose Island Spicy Ginger and Rare Teas Pomegranate Green Tea. Not your regular coke and pepsi choices. Alcohol available for the party people.   I'm gonna try the Avondale Ginger Mule next time.The staff is doing work on this chicken! I'm just gonna say that others better step up their game. (coughcoughParson'scoughcough).  We got there at 530pm five people deep in line and by the time we left the line was out the door.  Send someone to the bar to grab drinks and prepare to wait!"
"Expect to wait. Good things happen when you wait.Bring some friends. No more than 4 though any extras should be happy to sit away from you if needed.Bring cash or CC and a smile.It looks like counter service, but lots of service does happen on the backend. So do tip well up front.The chicken. Get it. with extra honey butter if you like delicious foreplay. Works well on dates too!The sides.Get those too. All of them.Not huge portions to make you fat, but good portions to make you ooooh and aaah and to tell your friends to stick that in their mouth too!The drinks. great local beer menu, not so large, but enough to wet your whistle.The cocktails are well thought and well executed. Get those too and share with your friends.Expect to wait.Lots of others are in the same situation, hungry for good food, so smile, drink your drink, talk your talk and wait.If you're sharing a check, place one person in line with the cash or cc and food order.The others can head to the bar and grab some drinks, grab a table and start the wait and communing and drinking and waiting.It's coming. and well worth the patience.Smile.you are full and happy.If not. you are in the wrong place. Check your google maps and try again.Lots of free street parking both on elston and roscoe.Not a far walk from the Belmont Blue line. In fact the perfect mile long walk you'll need to help you breathe again after inhaling your food.Or ride your bike. No divvys yet in the area;/"
"The sandwiches are excellent however slightly over priced.  The 5 star review is for the great customer service I received.  After I placed a carry out order, picked it up, and went all the way home I realized one of the sandwiches was missing.  After going back very disappointed and explaining what happened the restaurant not only made a new sandwich very quickly but also offered to reimburse me for the price of the sandwich as well due to the hassle.  That was unexpected but much appreciated."
"Figured Sunday Night Football would keep everyone at home, but nope, there was still a line when we arrived at 5:12pm. I clocked it from when we got in line, to when we got to the counter to order at 28 minutes. I'm interested to see how these waits will fare once the weather gets colder.  Also, if they are planning on covering the patio.My favorite eating buddy/boyfriend and I ordered the 4-piece meal, which came with honey butter and 2 cornbreads, 3 sides (pimento mac & cheese, kale slaw, and creamed corn w/ thai green curry), chili glazed wings, and a chocolate toffee cookie. Total was about $40.I LOVE their soda machine. None of the usual Coke/Pepsi products.  They have Green River, and also my fave soda ever, Boylan's Black Cherry.The fried chicken had us puzzled. While it was brined and fried perfectly, skin very crispy and insides moist and juicy, I can't say it blew me away. I didn't mind the thickness of the breading, however, the boyfriend did not care for it. I thought they were too heavy-handed on the paprika, to the point of me feeling like I was doing a cinnamon challenge. We asked for all dark meat pieces, and while the drumstick was very juicy, the thigh was boneless and therefore less juicy. Although impressive that they took the time to de-bone a thigh, I feel like the whole point of brining and frying chicken is to compress all that flavor from the bone. BF was incredulous about the lack of bone in the thigh. In fact, he is so adamant about keeping in the bone because of the flavor it contributes to meats that he purchased the domain bonemakeflavor.com years and years ago. True story.The breading also needed more flavor, like another reviewer stated. It was good with either the honey butter or the hot sauce slathered on, but without it, not much flavor. BTW, the honey butter is fantastic. I ate way too much of it. BF commented that I probably didn't like the cornbread that much, but that I needed something to eat the honey butter with. You'll never hear me say this again, but he was right.My favorite side was the creamed corn w/ thai green curry. The kale coleslaw was also good, a nice alternative to the usual coleslaw. The mac & cheese needed more cheese.The chile glazed wings were disappointing. I wouldn't get them again.The cookie was perfect, crispy edge, soft middle.I like the vibe here, and liked the food enough, but I feel that it could be great one day. Maybe in a few months.P.S. If you went to go check, I'm sorry to say that bonemakeflavor.com is still in the making. It will also be great one day."
"Honey. Butter. Fried. Chicken. One summer evening, I was strolling down Elston Ave and I spot the sign for Honey Butter Fried Chicken. Those are what I call ""Buzz"" words. These Buzz words made me do a double take and to my dismay, it was not open yet. I tell my Hubs that we need to try this spot when it opens up. I go about my life and still no word on HBFC, twas a lonely summer indeed. There was a social media buzz going around on Yelp and upon further investigation, HBFC was open! I read that there was a huge line on the first few opening days so I just stayed away. I told myself that I would give it about a week or so while I built the anticipation (and burn enough calories to deserve a cheat meal so heavy). Enter Tuesday, I was growing tired of looking at photos of other peoples' meals, it was time for my own. The Hubs and I were messing around in Lakeview for a bit and decided that a pit stop (totally not on our way home) was justifiable to have some Honey Butter Fried Chicken. We pull-up, found parking right in front, and then it hit me.....CLOSED ON TUESDAYS. I only disappointed myself for not looking at the times and hours on the website. Shame on me. This only fueled the fire to come here. I call up my friend and say we should meet for dinner and somehow sneak in how we should meet at HBFC. I checked the website just to make sure it was open on Wednesdays and they were, All signs clear, it was raining cats & dogs but it didn't stop me, not after everything I have been through. I get there and there meet with my friend who was patiently waiting in line for us. Waited bout 10 minutes. The smells of everyone's food was wafting through the air like a sweet perfume. We get to the front & we order 4 pieces of Honey Butter Fried Chicken. To my disappointment, we see that the Chinese Broccoli was sold out. :( We got the three sides combo Kale Salad, Pimento Mac &Cheese, Thai Green Curry Creamed Corn. The check out process was a breeze. They have a bar there that probably serves up some boss libations judging from the looks of them surfacing in the tables among us and the trendy bartender with an awesome handlebar 'stache.The seating & tables can be described as 'cozy' & bare. I like the minimalist approach they took to the indoor area. They have a roomie back patio area with tables but since it was raining, it was closed. It would probably be best to get a pew style type of seating along the walls of the dining rooms and then put those little tables & chairs in the middle to help open the place up & allow more space.1. Honey Butter Fried Chicken - The batter was golden and crispy...and glorious. They don't tell you to do this, its just implied: Spread that delicious honey butter on your chicken before you take a bite of it. The flavor cannot be plainly described as delicious but phenomenal. Perfectly cooked chicken then with honey butter spread on it, flavor amplified.2. Thai Green Curry Creamed Corn - Its not like anything I have ever tasted before. I love Thai curries. Not a fan of creamed corn but this is on a whole 'notha level. Don't pass this side up.3. Pimento Mac and cheese  - Another ingenious idea that I wish I had discovered myself. You wouldn't think that so much flavor can come from pimento cheese. It does. It doesn't give it a peppery taste but more like a ""zing"" that mac and cheese needs & overly cheesy either.4. Drinks - I prefer to stay with water but they have a specialty sodas fountain. They have Goose Island Root Beer, Spiced ginger ale, Green Mill (AKA Green Drank), Orange soda, etc. My fave was the Goose Island Root Beer, so creamy and it just hit the spot. They also have Teas - I tried the pomegranate green tea. The kind folks at HBFC have added a simple syrup on the side to sweetening your own tea. 5. Honey Butter - Whipped butter with honey. 'Nuff Said. 6. Cornbread - Soft billowy treats to eat with the chicken and sides. Minor blemishes that I can say about this spot is  that I wish the sides were a bit bigger because for the price, it really should be much bigger than just a small Styrofoam bowl. They also should have a combo type of meal where you can have chicken & sides instead of getting the them separately. The pricing was a bit high for the area. It's Avondale, not downtown. Don't get me wrong, the food is quality food with quality ingredients, I get it. I paid $15 for 4 pieces of chicken not including sides. Amish chickens are organically raised & all that mess, I know, they are delicious. . Then at least juice up the sides with more quantity. There is street parking and CTA accessible. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Spot needs a little help but  I give this place my Seal of Approval. I hope to come back in the VERY near future."
"Finally made it to Honey Butter Fried Chicken.  In all honestly it's overpriced and overrated, which is primarily why I'm only giving it 3 stars however, it is different, the food is decent and the service is pretty good, at least on the night I went.  It was steady, but the line was never out the door or anything like that.   I did go on weeknight, I'm sure it's a different story on the weekends.  I had the 2-piece chicken with a mac & cheese side.  Chicken was cooked well, juicy, good flavor.  I liked the honey butter, but didn't think it was as life changing as the hype suggests, but definitely good.  The mac and cheese was pretty good, not the best I've ever had, but definitely not the worst.  The corn biscuit thing could be a bit more moist, mine was pretty dry.  Would I eat there again?  Maybe, if I was in the area and there wasn't a long line, but I wouldn't seek it out.  Would I recommend it?  Sure.  It's something different, it's good, it's worth trying if you've never been. The service is friendly, they have a small but decent beer selection, just expect to overpay for what it is."
"The food is great. The butter is definitely where it's at. I also liked that the chicken was boneless. They have some great cocktails here and sugar cane fountain sodas. They also have some decent gluten free options, so that is a great perk. Lastly, the service was amazing. I don't often get a chance to say service is awesome, so I'm happy to say that. I obviously wasn't into the mashed potatoes and the server readily brought it up and brought me another side. She also came out to allow us to order something to go because she didn't want us to go through the ""hassle"" of getting up. Really great all around experience."
The food was good the portions are small and the prices are high . The use of the back outside area is genius the bar back there is very nice the cocktails were delicious but also expensive.  The service was very good.
Just had my first dining experience there and it was pretty good. We arrived around 445 on a Saturday and the line to get in was already forming up. Myself and my date split a 8 piece chicken and a couple side. For the sides we had the cream corn and pimento Mac and cheese. The sides were delicious and the chicken was what I'd call very good as well. The chicken was mildly seasoned and the one thing I did especially like about It is that the breast pieces were boneless. Since we were second in line at the door we were able to get our order in right away and it was a good thing since the entire time we were there(about 45 mins) the line was backed up out the door and down the street. The inside of the place has a kind of inconvenient layout since the kitchen and register areas are diagonal to each other and with a lot of people in the restaurant it bottlenecks. Not a big deal but the soda machine is on the opposite side of the restaurant so you have to battle to get your refill a little. The only 'con' I would say with this place is that the price is a little on the high side for what you get. It's more of a premium chicken place in my opinion and probably one I'd go back to again but not so much on a regular basis.
"Fried chicken done right!  Crispy, cooked right.  Honey Butter is tasty too!! The quality of the food is great - but of course, if you deep fry anything and dip it in honey butter, it certainly tastes good!  The staff here were extremely patient, seeing as it was my first time, and explained the whole menu to me.  They were very nice, helpful and knowledgeable.I think it's a tad bit on the pricier side and the portion sizes are a little small, especially considering this is Fried Chicken and biscuits. Although, since this is an occasional indulgence only, I'm willing to pay the extra for the quality and the amazing service!"
"Chicken was pretty good! Not THE best I've had.. But still really good and worth the drive out to try it. There's a little but of a kick to it. The portions aren't too big either. Perfect sizes. The biscuits/muffins are good. I thought I'd only eat one.. But I ended up eating like 4. Be careful. When we went, there was no line and no wait. Thank god. We sat out on the patio. Don't sit by the grey magnetic wall.. Smells a little funky over there. Sit toward the brick wall with all the greenery. Make sure to dip your chicken into the honeybutter. Not sure how I missed that.. But I didn't realized it until the end of my meal. Duh. I ordered the sweet tea cocktail. Not good. Don't Order it. I'm sure the other drinks are fine."
"I found a lot to like at Honey Butter - service was friendly, and though they were busy and their dining quarters a bit tight, the staff was happy to guide us to a table space.  The sides we ordered (mac & Cheese, cream corn, and schmaltz mashed potatoes) were delicious and thoroughly devoured, as were the corn muffins.  The cocktails looked delicious and I would have tried one or two had I not been driving.Surprisingly, the chicken itself ended up missing the mark a bit for me.  The meat was certainly was moist and very edible, but the coating was just a bit on the heavy and dry side, and lacked spice.  You are supposed to use the honey butter to add flavor but I liked the butter better on my cornbread than on the chicken.  I like the that the chicken is ethically raised, but they should have taken a cue from the cheap chicken places and prepared the chicken sloppy greasy and spicy - then the experience probably would have been a total home run for me."
"I had the ""Damn Good Sweet Tea"" and the Brunch sandwich with a side of garlic grits and Mac and cheese. Everything was amazing! We went on a Sunday and there was no line to order and it was pretty open for seating. I think since it was a nice day out everyone was on the patio. The only bad part did not have to do with the meal it was with the parking. It was a little hard to find street parking but we were lucky to find a good spot close by. Definitely a place I would come back too!"
"Well, to say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. Living in the Albany Park area and with few awesome restaurant options to choose from in the vicinity for pick up, we were really looking forward to Honey Butter opening for business. It took us a while to get to trying the food, so when we did, we were anticipating greatness considering how many times we had driven by to see a line out the door of the establishment. Sadly, it was ""Meh"".Here's the thing. It is JUST okay. I am not quite sure why everyone is raving about this. The chicken was not bad. It was moist and disconcertingly boneless. I did feel as though there was a very strong garlic flavor to the breading, which don't get me wrong, I love garlic... but I was burping that up 24 hours later and it was pretty gross. I think what really stuck in our craw was the fact that we thought the actual chicken would have been treated with honey butter or something in that fashion. I mean, here's a little plastic to go cup of honey flavored butter. Rub it on your chicken. That was the big deal? A side of honey flavored butter that anyone could probably make at home (do you have honey? do you have butter? Done.) and some over-garlicked chicken to smear it on? *sigh* The sides were okay. Everything was ""okay"". The reason I'm giving this 2 stars is not that the food was horrible. No, it was edible. But I don't think we should have paid that much for food that was only ""alright"". (Yeah, pretty gosh darn over-priced for what you're getting). I also think that they could cut back on the garlic salt a little in their batter. (And I LOVE garlic...) Ah well, we tried a new restaurant and were less than impressed. However, everyone's taste/palate is different so maybe we're just on the pickier side of the fence"
"Fried Chicken Nirvana exists. And this is the gateway.For all the newfangled ways to make food, it's the old school ways and methods that still work best. And they take that idea to heart.No fancy sauces. No crazy techniques. Just simple locally grown ingredients, like hormone-free chicken, brined and double battered with a touch a paprika, fried up hot and crispy. It's perfect just the way it is, but adding a dollop of honey butter somehow makes it even better.As for the sides, the pimento mac and cheese takes top honors, followed closely by the Chinese broccoli.The indoor space is small, but clean and well decorated. The outdoor patio is quite spacious and perfect for an end of summer chicken fry.If I had to nitpick, I'd say it's be the cornbread. For all the deliciousness packed in, it's only a small hexagon. A clever marketing idea (Get it? It's a honeycomb), but for the premium prices you pay, a little more cornbread would be appreciated. Another thing was the over-eager staff. I got up to freshen up my drink, only to discover they had already cleared my sides which I was still working on. Chalk it up to first day jitters.Waiting 45 minutes to order is a small price to pay to enter Fried Chicken Nirvana, but if you're impatient, I suggest ordering a nice stiff drink and get friendly with the other people in line."
"You eat the chicken, Amazing!Put some honey butter on it... What the Frock Amazing!Kinda pricey, but nothing wrong with an occasional splurge."
"Ok, heard the hype... thought I'd try it.  ""Meh"" sums it up.  I CAN say the staff was friendly and helpful.  The cane-sugar soda was excellent and when they say a spicy ginger-ale they mean it!  Ok, it should mean something to you if the first thing I complement is the soda.   :-\I went with a friend on a Thursday afternoon around 5pm.  We both ordered the 2-piece and muffins.  We shared sides.  We were served our food within 2-3 minutes which shocked me.  To me, that means my chicken wasn't freshly cooked.  Aaaand it wasn't.  Sadly, the chicken was dry and kinda tasteless, hence the reason they suggest using the honey butter or one of their sauces.  I was also shocked that it was boneless (not that I mind that fact).  In total they served us three breasts and one drumstick.  The drumstick was the only, truly hot item... everything else was luke-warm.  The sides were fairly good.  We had collard greens (which had small pieces of pork and lemon in them), roasted garlic grits (I couldn't taste ANY garlic) and the sweet-potato salad (which was surprisingly good).  Overall... I'm thinking maybe it was the time of day we went that caused the problems.  Maybe had we gone during a dinner rush or on a busy weekend the chicken would've been hot, fresh and moist.  Would I go back?  Probably not.  For a chicken place... the chicken should've been the star item, and it wasn't.  IF I went back (at the request of friends or a group) I'd probably order just sides.  Prices seemed high for portion size too."
"Amazing food, great cocktails, stellar staff!Don't miss the daily pickles and a pitcher of Hill Pop is a great pairing for an 8 piece.Pimento Mac & Cheese?! What what!!!!"
"I've been excited to hit Honey Butter Fried Chicken since I heard the name. Although I enjoyed my meal, I wouldn't write home about the eponymous chicken--crispy and juicy, but maybe a little bland? The world's best fried chicken wouldn't require honey butter on top.(Actually, the world's best fried chicken doesn't require honey butter on top. I've had the world's best fried chicken at Gus's World Famous Hot & Spicy Chicken in downtown Memphis.)The sides, though? Honey Butter Fried Chicken's side dishes definitely stand out. I loved the rich Pimento Mac and Cheese paired with the kale slaw--kale and cabbage, actually, with pomegranate seeds and a creamy cumin-tinged dressing. Love!I'd go back, especially to sit on the adorable patio with a group of friends, but I'd probably make my meal out of side dishes."
"You don't need a reason to go to Honey Butter, you need a checklist: Fried chicken - check.Honey butter - check.Mac & cheese - check. The chicken is crispy, juicy, salty, sweet, and oh, so decadent. I love that they can do without caking on a layer of breading without sacrificing the crunchiness. The mac & cheese isn't mind-blowing, but it's solid - creamy, cheesy, and oh, so satisfying. It's also worth noting that we tried the thai creamed corn on our fist visit and that was really delicious. I also overheard someone raving about their grits, so that one's next on my list!"
"Wow, this restaurant was certainly worth the hype.   The chicken was super delicious.  And it taste pretty amazing with the honey butter.  It's a unique flavor and cooked to perfection. The prices are completely reasonable. We tried two sides--the salad and the mac and cheese.  Both were very good.  The sides are small and are a perfect serving for one person.  Everything is reasonably priced--cocktails, food, dessert.  I can't wait to come again!Also, their decorations were super cool. And the outdoor patio was nice!"
"So so so so good. Fried chicken with honey butter on top, corn muffins with honey butter, cocktails and beer, and tasty sides. Really liked their fruit and cheese salad. Friendly staff, cool patio."
"I've been to HBFC twice.  Both times I haven't been wowed, as I thought I would, especially with all of the hype surrounding the place.Personally I think it was a terrible idea to eliminate the lunch specials. I spent $11 on two pieces of chicken, two tiny corn muffins, and the pickle of the day, for lunch. While the chicken is very good, it's not reflective of the price. Their profit margins on the chicken must be extremely high, that's all I can say. DO NOT ORDER the pickle of the day. Typically once would expect getting a whole pickle at the price of $2, such as what you get at the Pork Shoppe down the street. Nope, not at HBPC, it was 4 slices of a pickle and some pickled onions... $2?!Would I go here again, maybe, if I wasn't paying. There are plenty of awesome restaurants in the Avondale area, and from the lack of crowds I suspect people are catching on to the price gouging of HBPC."
"They are closed on Tuesdays. Ample street parking. Crowded dining.Review is based off of two adults, an eight year old, and an one year old dining.8 piece fried chicken: 2 drumsticks(withbones), 2 large breast pieces, 2 small pieces that were boneless and not sure what part of the chicken it came from, and 2 thigh pieces that was deboned.- The breading was crispy and the blending of spices was mild, but delicious. This opinion is based of  - The chicken itself was moist, even the breasts. I love spicy foods, however we had kids dining. They loved the crispy skin.- Honey butter enhances the flavor, but left the crispy skin soggy if not consumed immediately.Sides:Pimento mac - decent, had a bit of a kick. I think it was made with pepper jack cheese. The kids did not enjoy it.Slaw- Bitter and lemony. It was interesting as it offset the grease and butter of the chicken. A good pallet cleanser.Sweet potato salad- Not a fan. Was too vinegary for both adults and children.Corn bread, our meal came with 4 pieces and an extra one because we ordered 3 sides. The corn bread was a little dry, but nothing a little honey butter couldn't moisten up."
"Don't believe the hype.  This place is ok.  Just ok.  You have to stand in line to place your order.  Then, they give you a number.  You get a table when it becomes available, then they seat you and bring your food. One would think the chicken would be piping hot.  It wasn't. The muffins should have been hot.  They weren't.  They honey butter is good, the challenge is my first piece of chicken was lukewarm and the butter somewhat melted into the chicken.  By the time I got to the 2nd piece, the chicken was cold so the butter sat on top and didn't melt into the chicken.  The chicken isn't bad, it just isn't any better or worse than other fried chicken I've had at neighborhood restaurants.  We came from the S. Loop to this place because of the Check Please TV show.  It took us an hour to get there and it wasn't worth the trip.  Not that special.  The sides are not great.  I had the creamed corn without the Thai sauce it was really good.  The kale and cabbage wasn't good. They were out of collards.  Hubby got the sweet potato salad and barely touched it. Just wasn't good.  We spent $40 for 2 people (4 pieces of chicken with 3 sides and lemonades).  It was just ok. Nothing memorable.  And the pieces were small.  If this place was in our neighborhood, we would probably go every few weeks just to support a local business and have a decent meal, but again, it's not worth the hype.  If you don't live in the area, it's not worth the trip."
"Does what it says on the tin.Seriously, it's a good thing this place is like a half-hour away from me, because if it were closer I strongly suspect I would be spherical within a matter of months.  Crazy-good fried chicken, and even though it seems like putting whipped honey butter on it would just be too much of a muchness, it somehow transforms it into a nearly transcendent foodstuff.  And because (aside from the iconic drumstick) it's boneless, you can eat ALL of it.  And let me tell you right now, you will want to. I also love that they have beer and wine, and a fountain with gourmet locally-made sodas.  And some awesome desserts (not that you'll have room, but).  I've found the side dishes to be a little more hit-and-miss, but the cornbread muffins are well worth your time - you'll be sorry they're not bigger!And for slightly OCD people like me who hate having gunk on their hands - the best part?  They have a sink where you can wash up when you're done.I'm not sure if I'm in love, HBFC.  But I'm very, very much in like with you."
I had an overall awesome experience at Honey Butter Fried Chicken! Their service was great and the patio was a perfect option for a warm Sunday night dinner. Here's what we had and loved.- 2 piece fried chicken accompanied with honey butter (delicious on chicken) and tasty corn muffins!- Honey Buffalo Wings (very taste if you like wings)- Pimento Mac and Cheese (perfect amount of cheesiness with bread crumbs to add a little texture and flavor.- Schmaltz Smashed Potatoes with Chicken Fat Gravy (so so so tasty)Sauces to accompany the chicken. All sauces I would recommend and get again!* Candied Jalapeño Mayo* Garlic Aioli * Brunkow Blue cheese
"My wife and daughter and I first visited on a Sunday evening about a month ago when the restaurant was very crowded. A manager came down the line in front of the register and told us that they had run out of breasts. I asked whether this meant we were going to pay the same price ($28.00) for the 8 piece dinner ... for wings, drumsticks and thighs. He told us yes. We are not stupid, so we walked out, went to Pollo Campero and had some great fried chicken.My 9 year-old daughter had her heart set on Honey Butter Fried Chicken, so we returned on a very snowy Saturday night and gave it a try. BAD MISTAKE! FIRST MISTAKE: After we ordered the 8 piece dinner ($28.00) with a side ($3.50 each for tiny paper cups) of roasted sweet potato salad, a side of Schmaltz Smashed Potatoes and a side of Pimento Mac n' Cheese with Garlicky Bread Crumbs, the person at the register turned the electronic register display tablet around and had the gall to suggest we select the level of tip we would like to pay! WHAT NERVE! Pay the tip BEFORE being seated and BEFORE eating? Seriously? Then the meal came. Ungh. I ignored the signs liberally posted everywhere to spread the honey butter on the chicken and simply took a bite (SECOND MISTAKE). It was awful. The meat was tender and moist, but the breading tasted over-cooked. Kind of like oily sawdust burned in a cast iron skillet. I grabbed the honey butter, slathered it on, and then the chicken was palatable. Not good, just palatable. Like a day-old, cold Billy Goat cheeseburger when you're starving and half in the bag.Then I tasted the Schmaltz Mashed Potatoes (THIRD MISTAKE). They tasted like, well, like a mouthful of warm Crisco. Just terrible. My wife and daughter took a tiny taste and refused to eat more. FOURTH MISTAKE: I tried the Mac n' Cheese. Warm starch paste. The kind we used to eat in Kindergarten. My daughter tried it and refused to eat more. When a 9 year-old won't eat Mac n' Cheese, its a very ominous sign that something is wrong (not with the kid ... she likes spinach, jalapeños and grilled octopus).FIFTH MISTAKE: The roasted sweet potato salad. It is terrible. Overdressed, tasteless.When we finished our meal, I felt like I had been taken, defrauded and cheated. Please understand that the staff were all very friendly, helpful and efficient ... but all the hype about the chicken and the rest of the food is simply misleading. You'll get great chicken at KFC (Zagat-Rated!), Pollo Campero, Harold's, Popeyes, Churches or even Brown's, but here all you will get is fleeced. With tax, our meal was just a few cents short of $50.00.We will NEVER step foot in this restaurant again."
"Wholly mackerel! We stumbled by this place and with the amount of people in the place we walked in and ordered two pieces of chicken. We were just coming from lunch so it was to be a snack for later. Just to sample while it was hot we pinched off a bite. Amazing! Well we scarfed it right down. My friend bought it, I did not see what it cost, but after trying it, I doubt even unreasonable cost would stop me from crossing the road for that chicken."
"Exactly what fried chicken is supposed to be!! If you like a crispy outer crust that's balanced between seasonings (not too spicy or sweet) and where the chicken has been prepared by a brine bath than you need look no further cause this place delivers!! To accompany your tasty treat I'd stick with the honey butter (magical when you smother it on your crispy piece of chicken) or the honey corn biscuit (don't be intimidated by the number u get when u order them as they're almost bitesize).We ordered the Pimento Mac & Chesse as well as the Garlic Grits... Neither were bad but both tasted like they were just trying too hard to be ""different""... I'd skip the sides next time.I washed it all down with a cool glass of their Sweet Tea Cocktail where it was again a balance of sweet & punch (I'm usually a bourbon/scotch on the rocks kinda guy but this was still a win). If the weather is in your favor, it's pleasant to eat in the patio and overall if the sides were stronger I'd give this place a 5 star raiting but it falls a little short and is very deserving of 4 stars & ur time =)"
"The food is decent at best and a bit over priced. I had the original chicken sandwich and mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  Overall, It left much to be desired for the price. The specialty beer selection is nice and the staff was friendly."
"aw snap bro, you need to be here getting buttery ass chicken and slurping sugary soda drinks so you have something to work off at the gym, do you even lift bro? get: 4-piece fried chicken8-piece fried chickenla louisiannecollard greenskale and cabbage slawroasted sweet potato saladall of the sodas, free refills!!!!diabeteslove, a to the mothafuckin k"
I was expecting the best chicken ever but it was just alright. It was cooked perfectly but i didn't enjoy the honey Butter on the chicken. The flavor of the chicken wasn't that great. It was pretty basic without the honey Butter. I put hot sauce on the chicken and it was so much better! I also bought the mashed potatoes and the Mac n cheese. The Mac was too cheesy and the mash was topped with chicken gravy..  Yuck! My favorite part of the whole dish was the corn muffin. Lol. The ambiance was pretty nice though. I like the outdoor patio that is in the back of the restaurant.
"Loved it all!  It was the best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had, and the drinks were great too.  All for a very reasonable price too"
"I thought the chicken was well cooked but it cost me 40$ for a family 8piece with 2 sides of mac n cheese WTF, it seemed like the pieces they give you are random too b/c I only had 1 breast, usually you get a whole chicken if it's an 8 piece order....you only get 6 tiny cornbreads...seems OVERPRICED.  Not one free side of potatoes or slaw with family dinner...cmon guys, these prices... is robbery."
"I am mixed in my review because I really did like the chicken and sides, but felt that it was kinda over priced. The BF and I split an 4 piece chicken meal and two sides plus a root beer and it was $30.00. I don't think this would have bothered me all that much, but the chicken was kinda small and two hours later I was starving! You get one drum and 3 boneless breast pieces and YES the chicken was good and YES the honey butter is absolutely delicious, but Im not sure I would go back to spend the money again? For sure get the pimento mac n cheese - its different, but delish. We had no trouble finding a table for lunch on a Saturday..."
"This place is perfect for a warm Chicago spring day.  They have fantastic fried chicken with delectable dipping honey butter.  We ate out back in the gorgeous weather.  I recommend if you go with a group to have a variety of orders including the fried chicken, mac and cheese, and sandwiches.  Fantastic place!"
"KIND OF DISAPPOINTED...We have passed this restaurant several times in our journeys and after watching Check, Please! this afternoon, we decided to head down and pick up a meal to try.We ordered an 8 piece offering that came with honey butter and 5 corn muffins. The last time I checked, 8 pieces meant: 2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 legs and 2 wings. What we got was 7 pieces: 3 legs and 4 unintelligible pieces because there were no bones. There was only one piece that came close to being called a breast or white meat. They should mention that they are deboned. We also got 8 corn muffins, perhaps to make up for the missing piece of chicken. This cost $28.00.We also ordered 3 sides, which were described as ""generous."" They were anything but at $3.75 each. I will say that the highlight of my meal was the garlic grits. They were flavorful, creamy and a delight, which brought my original impression to 2 stars. The pimento macaroni and cheese and schmaltz smashed potatoes both had a ""funky"" aftertaste and we left half of the containers.I'm glad we had the experience, but we likely not return. Maybe if we would have eaten in the restaurant, it might have been different, but doubtful.A chicken is a chicken, not pieces parts."
"RATS! RATS! RATS! So I've heard so many great things about this place and was so excited to try it. We came ordered our food and felt lucky to grab a spot on the patio. But 20 mins into our meal we had an uninvited guest. Not just 1 but 3 different rats, scurried past and underneath our table. If that wasn't concerning enough the response from the staff after bringing this to their attention was hair raising. They treated it with such nonchalant saying things like ""oh those rats"" as to acknowledge their awareness already but still blatant disregard. And any other members of the staff responded the same until one tried to pretend like this is the first they heard of it right after another staff member admitted to being previously aware. Disgusting."
"This restaurant is one of the reasons I live in Chicago.  No, I didn't move here a few weekends ago because I heard they were opening a place called Honey Butter Fried Chicken (but if you did, kudos), but rather I couldn't picture living somewhere where I was banished to a hell of Chili's and Applebee's for the rest of eternity.  I love the amazing food Chicago has to offer and HBFC is nothing short of amazing.  Ergo, I must love HBFC.  I love HBFC.  There, I said it.I went with a friend on opening day and surprisingly only stood in line for about a half hour, and we got there right at 5 when it opened.  Once we made it inside, my friend headed off to get us some bourbon drinks at the bar for the remainder of our wait.  Someone behind me remarked how strong the bourbon lemonade was, and being 24 I thought to myself ""this guy is a lightweight"", taking a long pull from the tiny black straw.  He was right.  My friend ended up giving me the end of hers 20 minutes later because she, in fact, is a lightweight.We ordered the 4 piece (which came with 4(?) little honeycomb-shaped cornbreads), the pimento mac & cheese, and the chinese broccoli, which I'm sure is neither chinese or broccoli, but who cares?  It was all obscenely delicious, to put it in the least hyperbolic way possible.  We sat on the patio at a big round picnic table with other people, and while they seemed like great people intent on having a conversation with us, I was concentrating heavily on the chicken, leaving little room for interpersonal niceties.  I was also concentrating on not making a huge mess sitting quite close to the cute girl I'd brought with me, and I think I did alright on that front once I started using a fork like an adult.We ordered two more drinks, this time opting for a couple of tallboys (side note: How hilarious is it that they call their 12 oz cans ""lowboys""?) of IPA instead of continuing down the bourbon path.  When I went to the bar to order another drink, I noticed that the bourbon drinks were premade in large glass dispensers with Buffalo Trace, likely accounting for their potency.  Let me make this clear: I'll never complain about too much bourbon, and even if I'm not partial to Buffalo Trace, there simply isn't such a thing as too strong of a bourbon drink.The food was fantastic, the operation was running almost too smoothly for an opening, all the employees greeted and said goodbye to us, and we even got to meet one of the cooks when he came out to greet people on the patio.  There were a LOT of kids on the patio, and while I don't mind, I think my friend was a little perturbed since she hates the laughter of children along with walks on the beach, chirping birds, and too much bourbon.  I wish I could go here every day, but I'd be morbidly obese and broke.  Both would probably be worth it, now that I think about it."
"My girlfriend and I are both foodies and are always on the lookout for some good eating.  Well, we were both disappointed this time.  The chicken was served hot and was, for the most part, crispy.  However, it was just average tasting.  The prices are too high for average fried chicken. The corn muffins were okay (would have been better if served warm) and getting one buttermilk biscuit for $3 is insane. Price is no issue for us if the food is great but that was not the case here."
"Place order. Get seated. Chicken arrives instantly after we are seated. Giant sign in front of me reads: DONT FORGET TO SPREAD HONEY BUTTER ON IT! I usually dont let signs tell me what to do, but this one was on to something. So I slap on a creamy chunk of sweet savory goodness to the already deep fried chicken breast. The honey butter instantly melts, coating the crispy morsel. I tried it and was like HOT DAMN this is good. Then I took a step back, gathered my taste buds and took a bite minus the honey butter. Result? MEH. Newsflash, if you spread gobs of honey butter on a door stop it will probably taste halfway decent. All joking aside the chicken was well seasoned and came out almost instantly after we placed the order. All the breasts and thighs are boneless and the rub is just decent IMO without the honey butter smeared all over it. All the chicken here is cruelty free and cage free, so cost is marked up quite high for fried chicken. I couldn't taste the difference.  PROTIP: while in the checkout, they use an ipad and it prompts for a tip immediatly after paying, and boxes pop up for 10 15 and 20 percent. Even though this was a self order window place, seeing that there was a massive line behind me,  and from habit of dining out often, I quickly clicked for an additional 15% to be added to my already inflated bill so that we'd be seated quickly. What came next was a little annoying.  There was no service other then them dropping off the chicken basket. No refills of drinks, or asking if we'd like anything else at the table. The service stops after you pay for your order up front. I would't tip 15%-20% for this, you'd be better off leaving a couple bucks on the table for the food runners if you were feeling it."
"Okay so call me partial to Popeyes chicken, but I didn't see anything special about their fried chicken. The prices were reasonable but honestly Popeyes has better chicken for a better price.  My boyfriend and I tried their corn bread and mac and cheese for our sides, and I like to think of myself as a mac and cheese expert, and again I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't wowed.  Needless to say the 'hype' around this place is exactly just that.... 'hype'"
"HBFC is ok. It's hip and trendy, but at the end of the day it's fried chicken. Their patio is nice. Their sides are uniquely prepared and tasty.  Drink selection is good. Parking is great. Wait staff was awesome. Should make for a solid review. But my biggest beef (or chicken?) with them is their prices. Way overpriced and I probably won't go back because of that. And you know, I don't even care anymore about the tat-bearded hipsters staff in these places. Whatever. Hipsters are like mosquitos - annoying, but there must be some purpose for them in the social ecosystem. Just those prices.  $48 got me 4 pieces of chicken, three sides, a handful of biscuits, a beer and a cocktail.  I can't eat out for a month now."
"It was ok but way overpriced! Definitely would not say this is a ""top 10"" in chicago. Im ok with my popeyes or broasted chicken at some hole in the wall. no need to get all fancy with your side dishes they weren't all that anyway. The honeybutter was the best along with the tiny cornbread. The asian girl at the register was a little rude but everyone else that worked there was awesome."
I love the food at Honey Butter Fried Chicken. It's so good.
"A bit over rated and with a somewhat low, what I call ""dollar to happiness ratio"".  In other words, it was a bit pricey for what you get.Lets talk chicken:The chicken itself is good.  Tastes like it's been brinned which adds to the juiciness and their seasoning of the chicken is good as well.  The whole semi-boneless thing is kind of strange to me.  I'm not fully understanding the whole reasoning with going semi-boneless.  The breast and thighs are boneless and yet the drumstick isn't.  Not to mention the wing is not to be found.  I'm confused.Lets talk cornbread:First of all, I'll say that it's tasty.  That being said, why are they making smurf sized cornbread?  Cornbread shouldn't be a bite sized nugget, and if it is you should serve more than 1.Lets talk sides:I personally didn't think the sides were that great.  We ordered the mac, sweet potato and the slaw.  The potato and slaw were not my favorite.  I'm not a fan of chomping on pomegranate seeds.  However the mac was tasty.Tipping system:The nerve of this place.  This is what brought my rating from 3 to 2 stars just based on principle.  When you pay at the counter, the cashier turns the screen around to you asking you to tip.  What am I tipping for?1. The only thing they do is bring the food out to you.  I've never tipped for this service.2. You're asking me to tip up front.  I don't know even know what the service is like yet!  If I don't tip, will my food come out slower or cold?  Is there some secret gesture the cashier gives to the cook notifying him that I didn't tip?3. It's strange to be ASKED to tip.  I prefer to tip voluntarily.A friend of mine told me she was asked to tip when she ordered carryout.  Carryout! She tipped only because she felt pressured to.I would normally have come back for the chicken alone, but the whole tipping system kind of irks me."
"I love the food here.  I usually go for the chicken and grits but everything I have had is really good, especially the sides.  It's nice that I always have leftovers too.  I have never done brunch but, look forward to trying it."
"I was expecting fried chicken but what I got and grossly OVERPAID for was huge adult chicken nuggets.  There were no bones.  They breading was way too overpowering both in it's proportion to the chicken and it's weirdly spiced flavoring.  The chicken was moist but lacked flavor.  The potatoes were okay, the Mac and cheese had good flavor but when cooled took on a gelatinous texture.  However, the muffins and butter were amazing.  The tables are so tightly packed together - we squeezed into a two-top between the line to order the food and a woman who kept playing with her hair so much that it actually landed  in my dinner....Ugh. :(    The staff just don't seem interested  in interacting with the customer which is a turn-off especially when you a tip is requested on the screen when you checkout.  Or maybe they just don't have to care because they already have the cash in hand.  There are a number of options such as Stanley's in the city or the Village Grill in Buffalo Grove that offer REAL identifiable chicken pieces at a MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE price."
"The food is without a doubt, absolutely excellent! The staff is attentive and the food cones out fast. I sometimes see a line, but the few times I was there, there was no line. So they may affect someone else's experience. I highly recommend the original chicken  sandwich and their spicy ginger cane sugar soda. I will be here weekly for sure."
"Very good.  Everything works.  The food is real good.  I've been there twice and we liked it both times.  We had the chicken and a bunch of sides. We didn't try the sandwiches.  The chicken is interesting. It's not greasy. I don't know how they fry it, but it seems very healthy. On the sides, we had the cole slaw/kale combo, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and the muffins.  The honey butter is a nice twist, too.  Recommended."
"FUN!!!   We had the Chicken (duh),  Smashed potatoes, pimento mac & cheese, chicken sandwich special and the dump cake special.  I wasn't too keen on the pimento taste with the mac, but everything else was unique and delicious.   The seating needs some improvement.  It's one of those places that must not have realized that they were going to be a huge hit.  There was always a line so you either have people hovering over you while eating, or blasted by the open door.  BUT - we sat next to fun people and the food was good so I guess it works.    I can't wait to revisit this weekend when I am home!!!  Maybe to go..."
"I went to Honey Butter Fried Chicken with my fiance on a Friday night at 6:00 p.m. and it wasn't that packed. We got a seat right after we ordered. (No seating until you place orders). We got a two-piece fried chicken, asian glazed chicken, kale yogurt salad, and house pickles. The fried chicken was the best! I highly recommend it. The kale salad was a bit bland, but I liked it because it wasn't too sweet. The house pickles were not worth the price but the asian glazed chicken was (5 wings for $5)."
"We took the Honey Butter Fried Chicken picnic basket to Ravinia and it was amazing! It included 8 pieces of chicken, cornbread, kale slaw, pasta salad and cookies. We added some additional sides and sauces. The dipping sauces are not to be missed!"
They're okay.  I want blown away by their Chicken  and butter like most people.  I also thought it was pricey. I did like sitting in their outdoor patio.  But still. ..ehhhhhh. Chicago has better options at a better price.
Bingo on all good and fanfare! Great outdoor space!!!!! Chicken delicious and mac n cheese yum.   Sweet potato side very tasty n unique!
The chicken was just ok. Small pieces and it was a little on the dry side. I don't plan on driving that far again for it.
My husband and I were heading to another favorite spot of ours when he noticed the name of the restaurant.   I not he other hand was looking at the wood work on the awning.   We decided to turn around and check it out.  It was some of the best fired chicken I've ever had and I've had some fried chicken.  It's so crispy and juicy.  The grits and Mac & cheese were also awesome.  We were able to park right out front.  We sat at the bar ate and had a couple crafts beers!  I can't wait to return.
This place is the bomb diggity. It's as good as it sounds. The fried chicken and ginger mule are a must. The mac n cheese is not as good as their other sides.
"Oh. My. God. I could eat here at least once a week! After hating Parson's with the fire of a thousand suns [admit it, everyone, you're only going there because it's ""cool"" to go there!], I was so happy to find HBFC did not disappoint. Went with a couple of girlfriends so we all got something different (chicken sandwich, 2 piece, and pot pie) as well as a bunch of different sides. The chicken was so tasty and I wasn't aware before going in, but I'm SO happy it is boneless. I can't remember all of the sides, but I'd definitely get the mac & cheese again. A decent amount of seating inside and out, friendly service at the register and the wait staff who bring your food (very quickly!). For those unaware, they do the whole give you a number for your table and you seat yourself sort of thing."
"so many people been talking about this place.. saying how the chicken here is bomb dot com.. and im a huge huge fan of fried chicken! so me and my friends decided to come and see what is that hype all about..the place is pretty small and when we went it was busy and packed.. but one of the worker there found us seating which was cool of him..when i looked at the menu .. first thing came to mind was holy shit! that is some expensive ass chicken! so it must be as good as everyone say it is for that price right?i ordered the 4 piece with mac and cheese and mash potato as sides for myself.. took a bite into one of the chicken.. it was juicy.. but the chicken wasnt like wow! i even tried it with the butter.. ended up hating that sweet butter on my fried chicken.. to me.. it doesnt live up to the hype as most people say it is..it actually tasted a little above average.. and especially with pricing that high.. i expected a lot more..the mac and cheese was good, the mash potato was alright, and the corn muffins was decent.."
I've been to this place a few times now as I live across the street. The fried chicken is excellent and it is what they are known for. I also have tried their home buffalo wings which are excellent as well. The side dishes of sweet potato salad and creamed corn I love and I usually order as well. Every time I come in there's always a 10-15 minute wait standing in line to order. It's great that they always seem busy but they need either another cash register or some other way to speed up the line.  It can also get a bit cramped in the seating area at peak times although I do like that the seating is arranged more for socializing than getting your own table.  I do like their outside dining area as well when it's nice out.
Take out we had:Excellent chicken - loved that all but drumsticks are deboned. Super crunchy and moist inside.Excellent creamed corn - non-traditional so don't be expecting momma's OK kale and cabbage slaw - missing something hereGood gumbo - probably wouldn't have been better if we dined inBad cornbread - tasteless. Jiffy boxed mix would have been an upgrade. Bad prices - it's really pretty pricy for what amounts to fried chicken and starchy (read cheap) sidesThe mean of all of the above is 3 stars. Think some tweaking is in order but I am positive that they'll get it in short order!
"The name speaks for itself. You have to say it while pausing between words. I was there on a sunday night. Picking up a large order. I understand why they wouldn't take a phone order.  The line was out the door but it didn't take too long to get inside. Small place but it will do. Got to the register to place my order. Very courteous dude helped me. Waited another 15 for my order to come out. Got home and fed the crew. We all loved it. The biggest complaint was not having enough sides. Their Mac and cheese is to die for. I had to buy 6 sides to accommodate 12 people and since their sides are so tiny, it was barely enough for all to try. I suggest creating larger portions for take out orders. It's expensive enough for 8 pieces of chicken and well worth it but you guys have to hook it up with the sides."
"Came to this restaurant because a coworker raved about it...Pros-butter is amazing...I can eat it with anything...seriously!bread was small...but the butter made it worth whilemac-n-chz...not the best, but definitely used real cheddar...possibly the better of everything I had thereCons-Chicken wasn't fantastic (pink, had no white meat...maybe because it wasn't artificial?) The batter wasn't even that great...I'd rather eat KFC.mash potatoes had no flavor! throw some salt on that stuff!The price you pay is pretty high for semi-good food....will not go back unless it's for a side of butter!"
"Love this place. Perfect execution in the kitchen with everything from the chicken to the biscuits and especially the creative and all around great sides.Don't listen to the people complaining about prices. They and their ilk should stay home and cook for themselves. High quality meat and booze costs a lot. Go to Olive Garden and leave %13 for your server, stay away from HBFC.Which leads me to my only reason to not give 5 stars: No phone pickup orders. I'm sure there is a logistic reasoning for this, but hopefully I can grub hub it or call it in soon:)))"
"I'm not really into fried foods, but this place has the best chicken I have ever had. Their honey sauce pairs so well with the chicken. It's definitely a place you have to try."
"I love fried chicken- that's what brought me to visit HBFC today and boy was I shocked!I ordered the 4 piece with mashed potatoes...everything was cool until I started dissecting my larger pieces.What's this? boneless patties shaped like a breast and a thigh? I did have a real chicken leg however- but really? Pressed chicken?Every other new chicken place in the city offers real cuts of a whole bird, why not here? The coating was good but the meat was wet and listless. For the price I should  be getting the real deal....right? Or am I missing something here?"
the flavor on this chicken is so flame that youre immediately angry that the portions arent bigger. also they tell you to put butter on the chicken which was actually kind of a good idea even though butter is kind of gross to me. they gave me a shot of tequila with my tecate that was very nice of them
"This place is hoping!  Pretty busy, but the service is very efficient that things move along well.  This is my second visit and I'm still not loving it.  Don't get me wrong, the food is above average.  The chicken is good, better when you put the honey butter on it...but come on, what's not better when butter is smeared on it?  The pimento cheese and creamed corn were outstanding sides and so was their little biscuit.  However, if I am going to consume all these calories, I probably will head down south on Sacramento and hit up Parson's Chicken.  Although fresh, the chicken just lacks a certain kick!"
This place is incredible! The food is fantastic and a wide variety of beer. The honey butter and Mac n cheese is a must.
"Delicious fried chicken (kind of a peppery taste) with tasty mashed potatoes and a big honkin' bowl of chilaquiles (spicy). Price is reasonable too. Amazingly, the meal is not that messy! My gf and I left without greasy hands and hardly a misplaced crumb. They have beer and other drinks too. Come early because the line gets long."
Average at best.  Truth is honey butter can make everything taste good.  The chicken is above average very moist not dry.  The sides are lacking. Biggest problem is you spend a lot of money do nt get all that much and go home hungry.  No I would not go back.
It better be amazing since they aren't busy and I've been sitting & waiting for a Take out order for 20 mins. A TWO Piece order!! I'll never be back.
"This place nails it every time!  Never tasted anything less than delicious here, from the straight up boneless chicken  chunks with the honey butter to the array of chicken sandwiches.  Sides are great here too, I can't get enough of their cream corn.  Be sure to check the board for food and drink specials as well."
"I loved it. I thought their fried chicken was interesting and well spiced. The honey butter was off the chizzy (chain) and is a must for your fried chicken experience. I appreciate that the chicken breast are boneless, it made it really easy to eat. The cocktails were different and well thought out. My only complaint is that the cocktails came in plastic cups. I plan on going again for lunch and enjoying their sandwich."
"The chicken is moist and just deeelish but then add the honey butter, now you have heaven! I also had the Pimento mac n cheese and muffins and they were also scrumptious. They have a full bar with tons of crafts. I didn't know which to have so the server was more than happy to point one out for me. Everyone there was helpful and the atmosphere was light. I'm definitely coming back to try more of the menu."
It was really good until I saw a rat while seated on the patio waiting for our food. Then three more rats ran out in the middle of dinner. The staff moved us inside. Though they continued to seat customers in the rat infested patio after we relocated. We reported it to the manager and host asking how can you continue to seat people outside knowing there are rats? You pay before being seated and you pay the tip upfront. I will never go back there and neither should you. Zero stars.
I love chicken ..I have had a lot of chicken sandwiches from a lot of places and this has been by far one of the best chicken sandwiches I have had.  I must admit there is a lot of butter so something you can not eat all the time but when you bite into it it is just so good. Fresh chicken great butter and warm bread. All so good.
"Four pieces of chicken, corn fritters, and a drink - just a little under $20.  Good, but not great.  After two visits I don't think I'll go back.  It is good, it's delicious but it isn't worth the price."
"Very clean very friendly place you order before you sit. There pops selection is a little different, if you like Diet Coke don't order it here, its $2.25 for an 8 ounce bottle. The wings were very good. 2 piece honey butter chicken was outstanding. One suggestion that I would make, put moist toweletts at the table, the wings were very messy to eat.PS the music rocks."
"I want to bathe in the honey butter they serve with the chicken.  The chicken is juicy and the biscuits are moist, little hexagons.  I think about going here every day.People say the sides are better than the chicken, but I don't think that's true.   The mac and cheese tastes like pasta mixed with spreadable cheddar (like Kaukana or Merkts) - not necessarily bad, but just OK.  The sweet potato salad is refreshing and light.  Skip the organic cane sodas.Thumbs up for service and atmosphere, overall a great experience.  Don't let the long line deter you, it moves along quickly."
"Get two pieces of chicken for $8.00.  Do you know other cheap eat places would sell  half a bird for that! Ok...maybe we would call this a special occasion.Hands down, The boneless Chicken breast was my favorite.Crunchy, moist and seasoned, Chicken done right!   For my taste, the Honey Butter was best on the biscuits"
"I recently ordered chicken & grits to go. I've eaten this dish from there before and it was decent, but this time I wasn't even able to eat it. The grits were watery and flavorless, the chicken pieces were grisly and had a rubber texture. I won't be returning to Honey Butter Fried Chicken Restaurant."
"Obviously this place is hardly in need of another great review, but here it goes anyway.  We definitely played it right, showing up 10 minutes before they opened which put us far enough up in line to be in the first seating.  It was late Fall, and we managed to squeeze in under the heaters on the patio, which were actually really warm.  We had a group of 4, so we decided to go all out and pretty much order everything, including the 8-piece chicken meal and a pitcher of their tasty spiked sweet tea.  Everything was delightful, and it turned out to be more than enough food.  The prices are a little steep, but rumor has it that they serve a $10 lunch special now, so I'll be back for that soon!"
"OK, I have been here three times, and the truth is, the food is yummy, but the prices are a bit too much for what you get. I mean, a chicken sandwich, with a side of cream corn and a soda pop comes in at around seventeen bucks. the chicken is good, but every time I have had the sandwhich, the chicken on the sanwhich was always at least three pieces, and one time four pieces. It was like having a chicken nugget sandwhich. All in all, I would say give it a try, but be warned you are going to leave a couple of bucks lighter."
"Mmm mmm GOOD. I must admit, I had my doubts when I heard ""honey"" and ""butter"", since I usually only eat fried chicken plain or with hot sauce. But hot damn, this was love at first bite. *insert googly eyes*   I've only been here twice and the food was excellent both times. I had to be coaxed into trying the honey butter my first  time there, but I'm sure glad I kept an open mind! The chicken itself was very flavorful, juicy, and deliciously crispy on the outside. The honey butter only complements the chicken and makes it that much more perfect. No complaints there! I haven't tried all the sides yet, but the creamed corn, mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes are def worth getting. I've only gotten the chicken pieces so far but I hear they have awesome entree specials and a brunch menu that are equally as scrumptious! HBFC is def a neighborhood gem. It's a smaller restaurant with limited seating and can get quite crowded, though most people seem to take the food to go. Nothing fancy, really casual and relaxed setting. Staff is cool and you can even get a free pin at the counter! Yay!"
"Just ok, chicken is tasty and cooked well, however the price compared to the portion you get is woefully insufficient! I don't like this trend of ""English cut"" chicken, to me it is just a way to decrease portion size while increasing their profits. The sides are, to be frank, just not very good. Both the kale and the sweet potatoes were odd and bland. Maybe it will get better but I will save my $15 for better chicken fare elsewhere for now!"
"After hearing glowing reviews of the chicken, we had to try it. First we will say that it was the BEST chicken ever.  Now for the keepin' it real part of our experience. Very trendy in appearance, not very comfortable seats. (sat indoors) Short line when we were there. They have a sink where you can wash your hands which was nice for before and after eating, although there was nothing to dry your hands on...so....The pricing for what you get:  Our bill was $85 before tip, for 4 people. Kinda steep at about $20/person for fried chicken...although again, it was really good. Tip structure (our biggest gripe):  We placed our order at the counter, then they swivelled the monitor around to show us our options for how much we wanted to tip.  We have NO problem tipping well for great service. We DO have a problem tipping before we were even served. We base our generosity on how well the server performs, not on how well the guy wrung up our charges AT THE COUNTER. We tipped. Average type tip. Then we go sit and wait for the food.  It comes out, on paper plates with paper cups. The server drops it off and that's the last we see from her. The portions were small, but good.  The service was the pits. We tipped for this??? Kinda felt like a rip off. Steak and Shake operates like this, and the bill would have been half what it was here.  I don't think we'll be going back again."
"I'm always on the hunt for good fried chicken and Honey Butter Chicken was perfect. The chicken tasted fresh and was crispy, not wilted and mushy.  The recommended slathering of the honey butter made it really something special. Order the pimento mac and cheese and the creamed corn, they are delicious twists of classic sides.  I went during lunch on a weekday and there was no line :)"
"Was home for the holidays and had to try HBFC. Hands down, the best chicken sandwich I've ever hand in my life. Had a side of the kale slaw to offset the guilt of insanely good fried chicken. It was great too.If I didn't live in Cali, I'd be a regular."
I was really hungry.  There was no line.  The bathroom was clean.  The chicken sandwich was tasty.
"I am not sure how anyone, in their right mind, would give this place any more than 3 stars and I would only be that generous if I were measuring concept. I like the intent but like many other reviewers I think the owners spend more time focusing on the ironic design that they fell way short in execution. Let me start with the non-food related irks. 1. If you want to manage the seating DO NOT post a little sign telling people the ""rules"" of ordering. Verbally COMMUNICATE that! 2. I find it highly offensive when a place has a tip jar when you have to order yourself. Corner Bakery does not have one and they are shared service like HBFC. Get a clue. 3. The seating is horrible. I understand the financial need to put as many seats as possible but literally sitting with the people next to you is weird. 4. The woman taking orders made me and my group feel like she was doing us a favor for being there. 5. hey serve drinks, and good ones, but you have to go up and buy one if you want more than your original order. Weird.6. WAY OVER PRICED. The chicken is nothing special (i.e., farm raised, grain fed, etc...) for what you get. $41 dollars for 8 pieces of chicken, a spoonful of mac and cheese, 4 quarter sized biscuits and one beer. 7. CHICAGO'S BEST ARE THE WORST REVIEWES OF FOOD AROUND. 8. The menu is a little cumbersome. Another one of those ""I want to be cool"" aspects of the place.Food: 1. The crust on the chicken was dense and visually deceptive. I was expecting a crunch but nothing. Not to mention it fell off the skin which was then grossly soggy. 2. The mac and cheese was small and looked and tasted like the cheese came from a can. Not impressed. 3. The honey comb corn bread was tasty but way too small and a little too cool for me.4. The meat in the fried chicken breast was delicious but getting through that horrible crust made it not worth it. I did appreciate that it was boneless though. 5. That ""co-op"" hot sauce on the tables is gross and $5.00 for a bottle, really? You could get a bottle of Louisiana and Sriracha for less than that and way better (not saying either of those are the best just making a comparison). I do believe with some changes it could be a good experience and the concept is a much needed addition to the area but until all of the above is addressed I will not be back and would strongly suggest you stay away too."
"The chicken here is the best that I have ever had! The biscuits and honey butter, to die for! The pimento mac and cheese.... Awesome!!!  The atmosphere is very casual, but usually a little cramped and crowed, we order to go.  It's a little pricey, but worth it."
"This place is solid, but unspectacular. Far too expensive for the quality. I work down the street and would frequent this place far more often if it was a better value. A chicken sandwich with 1 side and a drink will run you about $18 or so. For lunch, that's nutty.They used to have combo plates that made their lunch menu more affordable but they ditched those for a more a la carte menu that's just too pricey."
"Was do excited to finally try this spot , I've heard so many mixer reviews. Well I bought a 4piece chicken with three sides $28 dollars, my first bite was such a disappointment , tasteless bland dried over cooked chicken. The sides were worst, the only tasteful part was the honey butter for the corn bread muffins. I have to say I will never go again and this place has been over rated ... I'm really disappointed  on any avid yelpers that gave it more than one star because it was a really overpriced over rated experience ."
I love this placeAtmospherr fantasticStaff super attentive and informedThey have gluten-free options which will make your mouth water for more.I highly reccomend the chicken and grits yummmie!My new breakfast blessing.
I really wanted to love HBFC. I was so impressed by their year long social media assault that had tons of people anticipating their opening. Once they did open there were long lines. I waited until the lines were gone and the hype has died down. I just wasn't impressed with the chicken. There was an undertone of garlic that seemed more like a garlic salt or powder that was off putting and added nothing to the flavor of the chicken. I also didn't like that the thigh was boneless. I really liked the creamed corn side but not enough to bring me back.
"Very disappointed. The food was good, overpriced the service was good my issue is at the end of out meal we were surrounded by ants, yes ants and the response was an apology a cookie and a brownie after we spent a combined 140$ on chicken... I haven't yelped in a while and I hate that my first one back is a negative one but come on ants in a restaurant, like that? And I still feel as though things are crawling on me."
"When boyfriend and I arrived around 7 PM on Friday night there were lots of tables open and hardly any line to order.  About 15 minutes later, the place was jammed, with the line out the door.  So we got lucky there.Service was extremely friendly and personable.  There was also helpful signage all over the place to assist in navigating the service (don't grab a table until after you order, here's the place to wait for take-out, here's the sink for customers, here's how to order more drinks, remember to put honey butter on EVERYTHING).Note that they're not yet able to split checks at the register, so plan for that.In terms of the food/value proposition, it did feel a little weird to pay over $60 for eight pieces of chicken, three sides, four wee cornbread muffins and two cocktails.  It's not that the food wasn't good, because it was.  But the ambiance didn't feel like a $60-meal-for-two kind of place, so it was incongruous.  I will say that it was more expensive because we over-ordered (all of the talk about the pieces being boneless made me think that maybe they were just chicken strips, but they're actually really substantial) and I had enough left over for a big lunch today.  So there's that.The food was tasty, although the fried chicken was actually better cold the next day, I thought.  All the sides were very good, especially the smashed potatoes done in chicken fat.  The cocktails (I had the tequila Bloody Mary with a Tecate back) were well done, too.I don't think I'm in a hurry to go back, although I might return when the lovely looking patio opens again in the summer."
"As I understand it, the creation myth of Honey Butter Fried Chicken goes as follows; fried chicken served at area private dinner parties; honey butter accidentally spilled on fried chicken; culinary euphoria ensues; a city eagerly awaits said commercialized chicken.When said chicken shack opens, we are all inundated with the refrain, put the honey butter on the chicken!  Even the server and the menu so admonishes me.  It is a bit much.  Sure, the chicken tastes fine with the honey butter on it, but honey butter makes everything taste good, even broccoli.  Sadly, without the Honey Butter, the Fried Chicken at Honey Butter Fried Chicken is pretty bland.  While it is juicy and tastes like chicken, there isn't much going on here.  The crust is lardy and flavorless; indeed, you'll get more spices at Popeye's, and for a fraction of the price.  At HBFC, two pieces of chicken will run you $8; four, $15.  Add on two drinks, two sides, and a dessert, and a dinner for two pushes $50.  That's a lot of dough for fried chicken that doesn't wow.  You'll get better flavor for a better price a hood to the south at Parson's.The other shortcoming of HBFC is the ""bar"".  It isn't a full service bar, in that they can't make you a Manhattan.  Let me just pause so you can take that in - they can't make you a Manhattan.  Instead you have a limited selection of cocktails to choose from; and while some look good - Kelly liked the variation on the Moscow Mule - what if you just want a Manhattan, or simply a gin and tonic?  Apparently, you are out of luck.Another odd bit about HBFC is that their chicken is boneless.  Except, apparently, for the drumsticks, but we didn't get one with our order.  I think this has a couple of serious downsides, and one potential upside.  The first downside is that I don't find eating boneless chicken that interesting.  I like the flavor of the bones when it is cooked, and from a texture point of view, it makes me feel like I'm eating real chicken, not ""chicken strips"" or ""chicken nuggets"".  More critically, without the bones the fried skin just doesn't stick to the chicken - in one case, half the fried skin fell right off my piece of chicken.  Bleh.The potential upside is that they use all of that excess chicken bones to make stocks and other reductions for their sides, which are excellent.  For example, the chicken fat whipped potatoes has a depth of flavor you won't find in any other whipped potatoes.  While on the topic of sides, the mac'n'cheese is wonderfully thick, with a nice bite from the pimento cheese.  Yet, while the sides here are good, but they don't quite make up for the chicken.However, in the end, HBFC is not that fun a place to hang out in (although I might feel differently if the patio were open), and given the lack of liquor options and the line, it falls short in the inevitable comparison to Parson's.  And that, along with the lackluster chicken, means I can't recommend waiting in line for the chicken, or making a trip from elsewhere in the city for the chicken.  Ask yourself this, do you want to live in world where your chicken needs honey butter on it?  If the answer is no, HBFC isn't for you."
"Everything we had here was tasty. Really good (just short of great) fried chicken. Juicy inside. Tasty breading outside. I shared an 8 piece with my wife and her cousin had one piece. Still had two leftover which heated up nicely in the toaster oven the next day. They de-bone the pieces (only the drumstick still has the bone), which I'm conflicted about. It definitely makes it easier to eat, but I feel like it takes away some of the flavor that the bones might impart during the frying process. Also, it confused me as to which was a thigh or breast. I prefer thighs, and was correct 1 of 3 times.Delicious cornbread and sides. The collard greens was smoky with plenty of bacon chunks. The smashed potatoes were tasty and perfectly chunky.Get a mixed bourbon drink. They're on the main menu board, so take your pic. Trust me. It makes the wait go by faster if you're sipping one of these tasty drinks. If not, they have Green River in the pop dispenser. We had a large party for a birthday, and the staff (manager?) was really nice about trying to find seating for all of us to sit together. Thanks so much for making it a great evening!"
"Showed up at 5pm when opened and was a line to get in. By 5:15 had food. First off drinks were good. Pimento mac n cheese awesome. Green curry creamed corn a nice twist. Got the 4 piece and chicken was moist, breading crispy, but could have seasoned inside of bird but the butter was great. Biscuits ridiculously small. Everyone in there super nice. Bottomless Green River a nice plus. Went with paprika brownies for dessert and enjoyed them. All in all, little pricy. Give me a normal sized biscuit for christ sake!! Personally, I think I prefer a greasy Harold's Chicken shack style fried bird. When I eat fried chicken I want a some grease.It's good but suffers from the Avondale syndrome of over hyped restaurants(Hot Dougs and Kumas). I should open a solid but not great restaurant down the block. Apparently I'd make a killing!!!!"
"I ordered the 4 piece chicken and it was ok. Nothing that would have me craving it. The skin texture is nice, the meat is cooked well but a little slimy. The thing that gets me is they urge you to slather on the honey butter. The honey butter is really good, but you can dunk this honey butter on anything to make it taste better. Since the chicken is already deep fried I didn't really put much butter on. I didn't get any sides, so unfortunately the corn muffins stole the show for me. The service was good, didn't need to wait as long as I expected."
"I was concerned when I saw that the venue was the size of a cracker jack box, but there's a back area near the bar that might be more comfortable if you want to engage in an actual private conversation - not possible in the main seating area due to the close family-style proximity of the tables. Plus, when it's cold that door keeps swinging open as the line grows longer and longer - that breeze isn't pleasant but you'll keep smashing your chicken anyway cuz it's tasty! Have to come back in nicer weather to enjoy my cups of honey butter and delectable bite sized corn muffins by the truck load (the muffins and butter alone are the best reason to come back IMO). A note: when side items are gone, they're gone! I got there between 4 adn 5pm on a Saturday and got the last smashed potatoes which were awesome with the chicken gravy on top - perfectly whipped and perfectly seasoned! Shortly after that greens were gone, corn...it was like a war and the sides were being hit with a constant stream of bullets! Drinks are strong, but $5 each in solo-style plastic cups.All joking aside this place IS small and it ISN'T cheap, but it's worth a visit. Lines can get long though so time your visit carefully. Parking is on the street on a random corner in NW Chicago area...REALLY long drive for me but I will still come back."
"Most overrated, overpriced place I've been to in a long time. Chicken was just okay, the cornbread muffins are tiny. Way expensive."
"The chicken was good, but not mind-blowingly good as all the hype suggested. I guess you're supposed to spread the butter on the chicken, but I preferred it to be without. A couple sides (mac and cheese and ?) were ordered and they were alright. I think the best thing I enjoyed here were the tiny cornbread rolls. Now those were amazing, especially with butter on them! Too bad they were just so tiny!"
"I love that it is boneless fried chicken! And you must get the following sides: Pimento Mac n' Cheese and  creamed corn. We also had the kale and cabbage slaw and sweet potato salad which were OK. Of course, the corn muffins with honey butter are a must. Was not a big fan of the Threesome (aka Bloody Mary), should have tried the Avondale Ginger Mule like I wanted!"
"There is no such thing as a 10 - but this place is a 10!!!I have a passion for fried chicken and I search it out all over the world and this place is #1. The deboned thigh and breast is probably the greatest thing to ever happen to a bird. My only complaint is that it is not open 7 days a week. (Hello, I get hungry on Mondays and Tuesdays!)Love you guys.  Keep up the good work.  See you this week. Phil"
"Visited this restaurant for lunch. I enjoyed the lunch combo of the chicken sandwich with mac and cheese. Excellent sandwich. Wish I had the honey butter. The mac and cheese is OK. The rare tea cellar ice tea was delish. Will try the chicken breast and other sides. Tables are set close together, but there were seats available on a weekday around noon."
"I was really hoping for awesomeness. Got the honey buffalo wings, mashed with gravy, muffins with honey butter. Only good things were those muffins and butter. The winds had a word flavor and so did the gravy. Not a fan of sweet gravy. Too complex. It's chicken fat gravy. Should be easy. Too many flavors, not enough good ones."
"HOT DIGGITY DAWG!!!!! This is some killer fried chicken. Put the honey butter on the chicken and when it melts and you've got a crunchy, sweet, and hot bite of sex in your mouth!!!! So happy this place is in my hood. The guy at the counter is a peach. Very informative and patient. The specials they run are always on point, with the paprika brownie being an unforgettable part of my food history. Also had some crazy good cheese grits on special a few trips ago...The corn bread is even better when you bring in home and heat it the next day. I have a huge tub of the honey butter I brought home. It's really not that expensive when you think a 4 piece and corn bread is only like $20 with a tip. Don't be a cheap bastard and spring for the sides, Pimento Mac n cheese with garlicky bread crumbs are really rich but perfect to split. The girl who runs the dining room is a real charmer, making sure our table is clean when we sat down and saw to it that we had everything we needed during the meal. She knew we'd been there a few times and welcomed us back. As we were leaving she said ""see ya next week"". The tall guy is really nice too. Bartenders are a little awkward but who ever met a hipster who wasn't??? The drinks are good and some nice craft tall boys are available. This place is kinda an expensive novelty but when you pick your next poison, consider Honey Butter Fried Chicken."
I don't know what the hype is about this place. It's very over priced for fried chicken and it's not even good. The place is super packed and terrible service. Will not be going back!
"I try not to make fried chicken a habit, but I'm definitely glad I made an exception and paid a visit to Honey Butter Fried Chicken. I loved everything about this place and would easily come back again and again. The menu is set up in a way that lets you try several things, so we had the confit nachos, the 2-piece fried chicken, and a couple of sides. Everything was great and the prices were totally reasonable. The service was good and even though it's a small place that gets pretty crowded, it's not obnoxiously full by any means. It's a nice casual environment that suits the menu and pricing.I definitely want to work my way through the rest of the menu. Try to get here at an off-peak time, it will fill up fast!"
"1) Chicken is amazing, that is not their issue.2) Price is amazing(ly high!), this is their issue. 7 people, 20 pieces of chicken, four drinks, six sides.... $180... I could buy a plane ticket for my aunt and fly her up north to make us chicken for that much. This Chicken was very good, but it better be for the price and the hype. If you are looking for a really neat fried chicken place, try Crisp (on Broadway).Sides were Okay, Chicken was great, line was really long, service was friendly, they ask for a tip before serving you (we tipped in cash after having been served, we were happy to tip based on receiving good service).Addressing other complaints. Chicken was very moist (I think if you ever get a dry piece you should send it back, they were happy to bring us a new side when one wasn't hot enough). It didn't need the honey butter, but the butter was enjoyed by some. They are insanely busy, if you can't handle that then you shouldn't go (I didn't like the crowd but I had prepared myself). If you need service you might need to stand up to find it, once you find someone they will be helpful (again they are busy and these people are only human). They are paid a fair wage and they get insurance... don't feel bad for making them work. Not a great place for big parties or for kids (in my opinion, it will be tough getting a bunch of seats open all once. Better seating options in nice weather because they have a nice patio. No reservations (typical for a place like this). .The chicken taste is five star. The chicken price is one star. That makes this a three star place. Everything else is simply what you would expect from a very trendy spot opened by a couple kids."
"Fried chicken sandwich is ACES.  The environment is great, the staff are awesome, the outdoor eating area is awesome, they have a bar.  Everything is awesome!"
"I've been to HBFC twice now....if I had written my review after my first vist, which incidentally was opening weekend, I would have given this review 5 stars easily. But now I have a second experience under my belt and some time to mull things over. I'm not disappointed by the lack of white meat like some are. I am perfectly happy with the boneless thighs too. I think they are still flavorful, though I will say I thought they were a bit dry upon my second visit. I love the crunch on the chicken though and the smoked paprika is a nice touch. A smear of that honey butter and a few shots of the homemade hot sauce send my taste buds into overdrive. The sides are interesting. I wish there were some mashed tatoes on the menu...or even mashed sweet potatoes. The sweet potato salad is not bad, just not particularly memorable. I think the pimento mac & cheese has great flavor, but a tad dry...the breadcrumbs don't help this. I think the sides of the day are where it's at. I've had the heirloom tomato salad; delightful. The creamed corn with cream curry; now we're talking. Desserts. The cookie can be skipped. The dumpcake of the day? Yes, this. Try it. On my visit, it was plum and it was delicious. It reminded me of rhubarb pie...sweet and tart. The Avondale Ginger Mule is great as is the Boylan's soda on fountain to wet your non-alcohlic whistle! To be honest, the fountain soda selection bumped this up to a 4 star review...and the sweet service. I know I will wind up at HBFC again, it's close and fried chicken is one of my guilty pleasures. It has a great vibe, friendly staff, cute little patio and tons of potential.  I'm hoping cooler weather brings some heartier sides. The fried chicken should be enough, but this girl needs her some sides...and gravy. Always, gravy."
"Went with 2 friends on Sat night expecting to be wowed by the chicken.  While it was good, there are definitely stronger versions throughout the city.  8 piece chicken, 4 small sides, 3 fountain drinks and confitted chicken nachos came out to $64!!  SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS and only 8 pieces of chicken to show for it!  There was a line out the door and I'm glad they seem to be doing well but at this price point, I won't be visiting too often.  I know Popeyes is a chain and it might not be fair to say this because HBFC uses Amish chickens but you can get 50 pieces for the same amount of money with more than enough left over for a mess of biscuits and sides. Are Amish chickens really worth that much more??  In my opinion, no, they are not.The chicken consisted of two drumsticks and 6 boneless thighs.  While the flavor was good, helped with the sprinkle of paprika on the crust, there's something missing when eating this boneless chicken. Maybe it's the gnawing on bones while getting your hands greasy that I miss but dinner was somewhat unsatisfying.  The sides are mostly unremarkable. The best of the bunch was the pimento mac and cheese. The schmaltz mashed potatoes were not good because of the overwhelming taste of the chicken fat. Sweet potato salad was served cold and just okay with small cubes dressed in a tangy sauce. A special of roasted vegetables was simple, not much to it.  Get the fountain drink so you can drink yourself silly on Boylan cane cola, Black Cherry, Green River, Goose Island Spicy Ginger Ale.  I would tell people to try it once at least but personally, it might be awhile until I make a return visit."
"What a delicious little chicken joint! And is nice that it's in Avondale!Love the ambience, the cool artisan cocktails, and that honey butter! Mmmm! Would never have thought to put it on fried chicken, but it's brilliant!So tasty!!"
Mmmm... Honey butter fried chicken. Honey butter + hot sauce + fried chicken is pretty delicious.  But if you are looking for a normal fried chicken meal this is not the place for you. Because a normal 4 piece with 2 sides does not cost $24.  Mac and cheese and creamed corn sides are both good choices
"i would Not recomend this place... stanleys  or marcelloes is 10x s better ... i had the 4 pc..  the only thing real was the leg.. they took boneless chicken & shaped it into a breast & thigh.. the taste was bland but crunchy...-almost $40 for  my wife & me, & she only had the 2 pc.    The mashed  potatoes were ok... save ur $$$"
"Great eats! Boneless, crispy, tender, sweet, savory and buttery chicken. Also a fan of the rotating pickled options."
"Don't get me wrong, the fried chicken here IS good...it's just not great, which is what I was expecting. Sure it's crispy and juicy but the flavor was very different than your typical fried chicken. I assume this is the goal of the chefs at Honey Butter, given their quirky side dishes: pimento mac & cheese with garlicky bread crumbs, roasted sweet potato salad, Chinese broccoli with goat cheese, etc. Overall, the food was different (in a good way, mostly) but I don't see myself craving any of the menu items except for the desserts. The chocolate toffee cookie and dump cake are delicious and shouldn't be missed."
"Don't believe the hype. HBFC is good, but not nearly good enough to merit the Hot Dougs-style wait times that have been reported. Luckily, we didn't encounter any such wait on a Wednesday at around 6:30. There was a small line inside the store, maybe 10 minutes tops, which provided time to check out the menu and daily specials. If you're dead set against waiting, you can bypass the line and walk right up to the bar and order, if there's a seat available.  The chicken was good, not great. They encourage you to slather it with their namesake honey butter, which makes it a pop a little, but again, it's nothing that will leave you speechless, the way so many react when they try their first bite of a Hot Dougs or Kuma's creation. Honestly, this chicken is in the same class as Chick-fil-A --good, but probably not the best you'll ever have.  They had wings as one of the daily specials, and they were comparable to something you might get at Crisp. The mac & cheese side was underwhelming, completely insipid, like something you'd get from a vending machine in a cafeteria.Note that HBFC has a nice patio, with lots of strategically-placed heat lamps to make dining outdoors even on a chilly evening pleasant.  That was probably the most impressive thing about the place.  It's reasonably priced, and I'd come back for a quick bite if I was in the area and there wasn't a line.  And I suspect that after word gets out, there usually won't be one."
"This place is great fun!  It was much nicer inside than I was expecting!  And bigger!  The people who work there are super friendly and don't take themselves too seriously which is good.  Its a tad hipster in there but the clientele ranges from families to dates.  All are welcome!  The line seems to go in waves about every 45 mins.  A lot of people get it to-go too.  We scored a big table so we stayed for food and a few drinks.  We all got a 2 piece which I kind of regret after seeing the sandwich on a buttered bun go by.  Next time!  I only say that b/c I'm not huge on meat anyway so eating off of a bone is not my thing.  I did it anyway and wow.  Honey butter on fried chicken!!  Its moist and has a nice flavor.  We tried almost all of the sides possible and I'm surprised to say that my favorite was the roasted veg.  Also the sweet potato salad.  I'm surprised b/c there was also mac and cheese that lives up to the hype, stuffing, soup and pickles.  They didn't have grits that day which was disappointing.  The little biscuit/muffin that comes w/ it seems like an after thought.  They need to either make it more substantial or 86 it.  Its like a little disc of bread where I was expecting a nice fluffy corn muffin.  We tried the brownie and I'm glad I only got a little bite of it b/c that's all you need!  Its very rich and very spicy.  Also the dump cake of the day which was caramel apple.  It was yummy but we all agreed that it need more cake and less dump.  The cocktails and beer selection are all great and seem to be thoughtful.  Everything went with fried chicken!Its easy to get there and park so we'll be back soon!"
"woah. there are a lot of fried chicken joints that have popped up in chicago in recent years. i must admit, when they pop up, i end up checking them out. HBFC was one that i gave some time to get settled. but, last month, when HBFC did a pizza for piece, i was hooked. essentially, the honey butter is meth-extremely addicting on first try. i chose, ""da club"" with a side of smashed potatoes. that sandwich is a double decker with chicken, bacon, and garlic aioli. all insanely amazing. the bf got the two piece chicken, the HBFC sandwich, and mac'n cheese. he hates calories.  he was, literally, dipping the chicken in the honey butter like he was a double dipping party goer, and claimed that the concept was, ""a game changer"". if that isn't convincing enough, all you need to do is pop some of those corn muffins in your mouth like cheese puffs and you're hooked. note: the restaurant does get quite busy, so make sure you got no where to be right away. and, let's be honest, based on how much face stuffing you will do, you're not going to want to see another soul for at least an hour."
"I have  only heard about this place from a friend who mentioned it briefly. So one Friday night after work and Gym we decided to meet up for dinner and after about 30 minutes of food hunting we ended up near here.  So boom!  Fried Chicken it is.   We walked in and the places looks clean and comfortable,  there is even a very large outdoor dining area.   I order the five wings for $5 and a side of grits.  So far so good.  We find our seats outside and the food runner brings one of our party his two piece dinner and like 15 minutes later they bring me and my friends wing out.  Huh? Anyway my wings and grits looked amazing!!  Like instagram that ish #hongry #winnerwinnerchickendinner but then I bit into them and whomp whomp!  On top of the wings being over cooked and dry. I ain't taste no honey, I ain't taste no butter??  The sauce was sweet but not spicy. It was all such a let down. #sadface *sigh* but the grits were good so.....Nuff said!"
"Take-out dinner was wonderful. I'm a dark-meat guy but the chicken was wonderfully moist and tender, the coating was very tasty. Sides were very interesting. Like everyone else I wish the corn muffins were bigger and/or more plentiful.The rave reviews meant I was the 12th person in line on a Wednesday evening at 7P but the line moved unexpectedly quickly. Don't be deterred by what you see from the sidewalk.I'll definitely be back."
"Not worth the cost to be honest. It's a nice space but I've had better fried chicken from a gas station. It's a great looking space, cool music, a nice big patio with ample seating and probably the best thing about the place... it's drink menu. Very tasty soft drink selections that included Goose Island Root Beer and Black Cherry. The Sides - You really don't get the bang for your buck here. The sides are small, really small for the amount you pay ($3.50). I ordered the mac and cheese since the employee raved about how amazing it was. What I received was an ice cream scoop of cheeseless pasta with breadcrumbs.The Cornbread - We received 4 tiny pieces of cornbread that wouldn't satisfy a fly. It was tiny, really tiny.The Chicken - Ordered the 8 piece ($28) Crispy, thick and tasteless coating. Breasts and thighs (w/o bone) and legs. No wings. Chicken could have used more seasoning, especially salt. You're encouraged to slather the chicken with honey butter and for good reason... it makes the chicken edible.Complete order: 8 piece, 2 sides, 2 drinks + tip = $50."
"SO SO SO good!! The curry creamed corn was absolutely amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the mac n cheese but the broccoli side was pretty good. The chicken is great. I prefer it over Parson's. Oh, and that hot sauce! I'm loyal to Frank's but their homemade sauce is really freaking good. All of the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. My biggest issue is the location, which I guess isn't a big deal. There is just nothing else there and it isn't very well served by public transit. I wish they opened up somewhere more convenient."
"There is a reason HBFC has gotten sooooo much hype in the last... well hell, at least a YEAR. It's because they put out some crazy tasting chicken!! But it's not only that, it's because Josh and Christine (plus supporting staff) have worked so hard to make this dream happen that they deserve all the praise coming to them! As An P. said they are the creators of Sunday Dinner Club (which I've had the pleasure a few times now. Amy is AWESOME!!) and if you have ever been it's pretty top notch on its own. These guys and gals are fun and playful but serious about what they do. You can see their passion for food and you sure as hell can taste it. It's neat to have seen their journey through all of this and I'm sure they were smart enough to realize that bringing all of us with, created an almost bond between them and their friends/ fans. Then out of the blue, they rewarded us SDC people with a pre-opening. Not to anyone's surprise only after an hour into it all there was a line. But the staff were rock stars, helping the line move, getting people their chicken, cleaning up, and all with a smile of their faces. Let us talk about the food...Sweet potato salad -it's not what you think, not full of mayo and junk. It's delicious.Pimento Mac n Cheese -Yes as good as it sounds.Chinese broccoli and goat cheese -Loved itChicken sandwich with slaw -I can eat a few of these.Honey Butter -Yes it needs its own line. Put this shit on everything!Chicken -Fried to perfection. This is the kind of crisp that lasts. Plus, the chicken is tender as hell inside. I might become an addict.  I like the menu set up too. They give you an assortment to order which makes sharing almost a better way to go. Then again I can eat a lot of chicken. Nikki C. and I split a meal, 2 breast, 1 leg, 1 thigh, 2 sides, and two beers + tip =$45 which seems high but these are huge pieces of chicken. You leave stuffed no doubt.Their choice of chicken, local markets for their veggies, local brewers... HBFC is doing everything right. Big Congrats!! I'll be coming around quite often.On a personal side note... I finally get to a place before 1,000 reviews (pats himself on the back for not being the last to the party) and in the very first hour of opening to boot."
"Good and novel take on fried chicken ! Nice laid back place and I'll staff. Yummy delicious cocktails. Amazing pimento Mac and cheese - could not stop eating it. But the Price!!!!!!!!! Yowsa. Come now - it's still just fried chicken!!! Makes this a once a month place rather than a once a week place, which Id like it to be :("
"Cobbler was what made the most impression on me lol sorry....it was really good, but ppl don't go there for That. I Tried the chicken sandwich and I'm guessing the Mac side.... If someone else wanted to go I would return but I'm not convincing ppl to go & try it or even mentioning it."
"Believe the hype- The fried chicken breast, with the Honey Butter, is the best piece of chicken I've ever had.  Sides were great, date said her grits were great, but whatever... you should be there for the chicken and honeybutter.Service was friendly and the atmosphere is cute,  though I went when it was cold and snowy and I didn't have to really wait in line or for seating. Had it been a clusterf@ck-which I imagine it often is- I'd probably be singing a different tune. Reasonably priced craft cocktails served out of big plastic cups? Yes. Please. When it gets warm I could imagine doing some serious boozing on their patio- the Avondale Ginger Mule is awesome."
"The name is so catchy, they could invent a dance or a song. So after drooling over pictures from my twittering and Yelp friends for a week, I finally took my envious self to the restaurant. And boy was I happy. Who cares that at 8:30 PM Thursday the line was out the door. The staff were fast, and the whole 10 minute line was nothing. So Hubs and I settled on the eight piece chicken with four for biscuits and their infamous honey butter and three sides. Seems like a lot of food, but if you're a regular reader of my reviews, we try to order enough for lunch the next day. Let's start with the chicken. I love how the batter was on the the thicker side, but not thick enough where there is a timeframe to turn soggy on the drive home from take out. I would suggest that you break off a piece of chicken and slather the butter on the chicken, similar as to how you for buttering biscuits. The crispiness remains intact, while the butter adds a next dimension of flavor. For sides we ordered the corkscrew pimento Mac and cheese. Perfectly al dente, with crunchy garlicky breadcrumb topping. The cheese wasn't too cheesy, just the right amount. We also ordered the Chinese broccoli with this chèvre cheese. As the head chef explained to me every cheese was type of goat cheese. The cheese complemented the broccoli by being on the salty savory side. Great pairing. Now my favorite of the sides was definitely a surprise. I really adored cabbage and kale salad. Perfect acidity, crunchy, and flavoring.  You definitely must order two sides of this. What I will mention that the side I tad bit it smaller, however they are very fresh and clean. When having some Soul Food, sides tend to be on the heavier side.  After having the honey butter fried chicken, the sides complement their main feature. Some takeaways from this place. While we did order take out so that we could watch the Thursday night football game at home, we did see that they had a huge patio area as well as an indoor area. The indoor area had a hand-washing station in the corner. I imagine for dining patrons to wash their hands of butter sauce after eating. Convenient and well thought out. Also, I love certain decorating items. The menu board was placed on top of large baking sheet. Very cute. One branding method that I really love, were their cute biscuits. On the bottom of each and everyone, was a honeycomb imprint. Love it!When service matches food and matches marketing, you have a combination of a great business. Welcome to the club Honey Butter Fried Chicken! You are well received!"
"Chicken not bad.  Sides were great.  Drinks a bit pricey.  Was fun eating with a group of friends!  Would I come back?  I would, but won't be rushing back..."
"Good but a little overpriced. Provided you get there right when they open, you'll be in and out in half an hour. Yes, the chicken is good (the small size of the pieces, especially the breasts, with no sides doesn't justify the price), and yes the butter is good (obviously. Who has had butter and thought it wasn't good). The collard greens left something to be desired, but the kale slaw is pretty killer. Glad that we gave it a whirl, but probably a one time visit from us."
"Just go!  I give this place 5 stars for the chicken alone... which will haunt your dreams for days.The chicken here is amazing - and you really want the honey butter on it -- that's not just a gimmick.  I honestly can't decide if it is better than Crisp! or not but it's certainly in the same league which puts it in the top three of my Chicago list for Fried Chicken.I have tried a variety of things:Breast / Drumstick / Thigh with Honey ButterPimento Mac and CheeseCreamed Corn with Thai Green CurryKale Slaw with PomegranateChicken SandwichMashed PotatoesHere are my recommendations... the chicken is very good... I especially liked the boneless thigh meat which was more juicy and richer in flavor than the breast and larger (not to mention boneless) compared to the drumstick.  The Creamed Corn with the Thai Green Curry is out of this world (easily my favorite side dish there although the Pimento Mac is also quite tasty).I would recommend the Chicken over the Chicken sandwich... it's not a bad sandwich, but the bun is big (2X more bread than Chicken) and it's significantly less satisfying than getting two pieces of Chicken for the same price.  Also, the mashed potatoes are... well mashed potatoes, nothing to write home about.That said, I will repeat the chicken, especially slathered in honey butter, is quite frankly amazing.  The light breading is crisp and the chicken is moist and flavorful.  They obviously excercise high quality control too because the last time I was there, they fried up some new thighs even though they had some ""ready"" because the chef thought they might have sat too long (we came in right as they were closing for lunch and although they could have served us the end of the lunch run prep, they made new piping hot pieces for us).The also serve small but tasty honeycomb corn bread.I've only had their non-alcoholic beverages so far.  Their soda machine is very good -- stocked with unusual but tasty sodas like a delicious Wild Cherry, a Cane Cola, and Goose Island Root Beer.  I would have preferred a more traditional iced tea (as I am a big fan of real tea both black and green)  -- the one they have is overly fruity to the point where the actual tea flavor is lost."
"Great patio seating, good southern-inspired cocktail offerings, good fried chicken."
"The fried chicken is okay -- not terrible, not the best I've ever had, but tasty. I had the two-piece meal, which is $8 and comes with two really small pieces of cornbread and some honey butter. I liked the cornbread, and while I had my doubts about putting the honey butter on the chicken (which an employee encouraged me to do), I liked it. The sides looked delicious, but since I wasn't that hungry and was also keeping an eye on prices, I didn't get any. (This place is a bit on the pricey side -- if I'd had a side, my total for the two-piece, a drink, and a side could have easily been at least $15.) I'd like to come back sometime to try the mac n cheese, and my friend's sweet potato salad tasted amazing.I'd give three stars to the food, but what bumps this place up to four stars are the kind, friendly employees and the great patio area. I loved sitting on the patio on a cool night, and I'm not a person who usually enjoys eating outside.Free, non-permit street parking is available on the nearby side streets. I had no problem finding parking at 6:30 p.m. on a Wednesday."
"The food is great and reasonably priced. The ENTIRE staff is so nice and friendly, which is often hard to find. Nice outdoor patio area, as well. Definitely a gem. Try the mac & cheese and the chili glazed wings."
"Loved it! Best fried chicken I've had. Juicy and flavorful on it's own. I liked, but didn't love the honey butter on the chicken. I actually slathered it on my corn bread instead.  Speaking of the corn bread, make it bigger please! The pricing didn't bother me as much as others but that could be because I'm not a big sides eater. I was happy with 2 pieces of chicken and the corn bread and that is probably what made it more affordable for me versus some of the other reviews I've seen.I will definitely be going back for some of that tasty chicken!"
"All chicken for all time should now be honey buttered. The ambiance and atmosphere speaks quite well to the down-home, comfort food being served. The chill and supportive staff make the transition from the check counter to the table pretty easy. The use of the space both indoor and out is everything you have come to expect from new hipster-esq places like this.Now to the food: Surprisingly this is where Honey Butter lost the star. Under no circumstances should fried chicken cost this much! My date and I ordered one entree each, and 3 appetizers. The 2 Piece is perfect size for any one person, and that Fried Chicken Sammy is on point! The sides are good, but not amazing, but we all know that sides are not why you are in Honey Butter. The cornbread is soft, tasty and buttery delicious.Get down here quick before they realize that raising the unseemly prices will not diminish the lines at all."
"Like everyone else I was really excited about trying this chicken!     I've had fried chicken all over the country.   So I was really excited about this place.   Had my friend meet me over here for dinner.     We ordered the chicken (of course), mac and cheese, and I had the Damned sweet tea.     The chicken was good and moist but pretty good by Chicago standards.Everyone was nice and seemed pretty open.   I really didn't know you were suppose to smear the butter on the chicken until I saw someone else do it lol.   I wish they did a really good biscuit.    It would be fabulous with the honey butter.     The biggest CON about this place.   The prices!!!     $15 for 4 pieces of chicken and 2 small corn muffins.      This is a little pricey.  I understand it is Amish chicken but still that is a lot of money with a family.My friends and couple next to us were talking about the food.    It is very good chicken.    However not that good enough for us to pay $15.    If it wasn't so pricey I would go back, however the price is going to let me stay away!"
"That is some darn good fried chicken!Our group arrived here with devilish plans for a late night treat and a take home for a waffle-plated morning snack.  Left with a full belly that didn't want to stop on the chicken train.The 4 of us were wonderfully gluttonous going for a double 8-piece order and a 2 x 3 side setup.  Our sides consisted of two of the fantastically tasty but not too-wild pimento mac 'n cheese, 2 sweet potato salads, one kale and cabbage slaw, and one grilled chinese broccoli.  All were really great if they are anywhere near your realm of desire.  I scarfed down a few bites of corn muffin dipped in honey butter while I tried to use it to scoop the butter onto the deceptively boneless chicken breast (which resulted in a folly of half a skin being leftover where I thought the ribs would be) and its drumstick pal so its deliciousness could melt in.  The chicken finally hit, and oh was it good.No full bar here, but there is a decent bottled selection of local and far stretched favorites.  Servers were attentive and not overly interrupting, but we did hit a bit of a snag.  The double orders of three sides were supposed to include an extra corn muffin (which they are kinda skimpy on already, but hard to complain when you leave full) and an extra honey butter each.  The guy taking the order stopped us from adding an extra honey butter (yay!) but it wasn't in the order when it arrived (boo!).  After we looked things over and agreed we were short we asked a waiter for the extra honey butter and corn muffins.  He looked down and said ""three sides?  Gotcha!  It'll be right up!"".  Then after a not-sooo-long but people's-atomically-hot-chicken-thats-supposed-to-­melt-the-butter-is-cooled amount of time he came back.... with 1 honey butter.  All 4 people looked at him kinda silly and he got it and said ""Right!  I'll be right back"" ... and came back a few minutes later with one more honey butter (and no corn muffins).  At $28 an order for the admittedly high quality chicken I feel like they'd be shoving cornbread down your gullet till you couldn't talk (if nothing else just to get you to buy more sides of honey butter).The atmosphere here was pretty cool and relaxed.  I like the semi-waited setup where you pick to sit down once your food is ready (or before if there are open tables).  The tables on the patio were diagonal cut for placing large parties, but good for sharing a table close with friends too.  There was still a bit of a fresh paint smell from the oil/stain on the wood, but everything was clean and tidy and thats a lot better than anything grimey.All-in-all I can say it was some darn good chicken.  There's some tough competition in the area, but Honey Butter Fried Chicken is a serious contender for the belt!"
"Yes, I know everybody loves this place and well I am just not sold on it. The boyfriend and  I came here for his birthday dinner. We did the 4 piece combo with 3 sides ( pimento mac n cheese, cream corn w/ green curry, and chinese broccoli) and biscuits. The chicken was a little over priced, but we had to see what all the hype was about. First, don't expect the chicken to have bones unless it is a leg. The breading and the butter were okay. I wouldn't say it was life changing or to die for.  I was expecting the butter to be sweeter, but it was a very faint touch of sweetness. For some reason the breading on the chicken tasted a bit like Doritos when I added the butter on the chicken. However, the chicken is very moist and juicy inside. The hot sauce is quite mild and very vinegary . I really wished they had a  habanero sauce to really give it some kick. The only item that stood out to me was the creamed corn with green curry. Seriously, I could eat it non stop. Otherwise, the rest of the sides were kinda lack luster."
"My first visit was carry out soon after the place opened and I loved it.  Came back again, this time with several friends.  We ate outside on the patio and had great service.  The chicken was good as usual but I loved my sides so much more this time.  The grits were so tasty and the mashed potatoes were one of the stars of the meal.  Sometimes a place opens and is fabulous and then kind of settles in to just OK.  But HBFC kept up the good work."
"Sorry to say, I really wanted this place match the average rating it was getting but honestly it does NOT.  PROS:  The staff was great, our food came out really fast, getting customers in and seated at the table or at the bar if you had to wait was done well.  Cream of corn was VERY GOOD.  The other side we had (sweet potato with cilantro and something) was also GOODCONS:  way too expensive for what you get, 4 piece Chicken with two of the smallest biscuits I have seen (really they are mini-biscuits) for $15 bucks is way to expensive for average taste.  Sorry, I really wanted good fried chicken, but one of the pieces of chicken,  the breading was sponge-y.  The taste was ok...the chicken was juicy (good thing) but the inside was NOT seasoned, just the outside.  this made me sadThe waitress and I believe the manager ask me and my wife what we thought, I told them what we thought ($$$ and small biscuits) and they appreciated the comments, and actually offered me some more biscuits which was really nice but I gave them the feedback not expecting anything."
"Fantastic. Way, way better than Parson's and several steps ahead of Bub City (last two places I ate fried chicken). The breading is a bit too dense for me, but the flavor is excellent and the frying is done so well (i.e. It's not greasy at all). The chicken is moist and delicious, for a moment you forget you're eating the blandest meat. The honey butter seems a bit outrageous on top of all that but it works really well. I didn't care for the corn muffin they give you on the side. But it works as a bit of sweet after you've eaten whatever amount of meat you found necessary. I got a side of pickles, which was good but overpriced at $2. The vegetable was also surprisingly great (it was broccoli and squash w/goat cheese). The broccoli was ... broccoli (I have yet to be convinced that it isn't a useless vegetable) bug the squash was roasted so the skin was charred and the flesh delicate. Great combo of textures and tastes. Didn't get to try their cocktails but it looks like they have a decent selection, as well as a solid lineup of beer. Highly recommended. It's got the Smoque model of seating and it was packed at 6PM on a Thursday, so ... be ready to wait if you come at a peak time. Hopefully they'll get a phone ahead system going soon!I'd say the one little thing that took away from the experience was when you pay by credit, they ask you if you want to tip. What am I tipping for? Someone taking my order? It might make sense for the stay-in orders but is kinda ridiculous for take-out."
"My boyfriend and I walked in at 10:35 on opening night and walked straight up to the counter. Everyone was super friendly and looked really excited about working that night.We ordered a two piece meal, chicken thigh sandwich, sweet potato salad and pimento mac and cheese, plus a couple of beers. Got our number and went out to the beautiful patio.Server immediately brought out the beers, and seemed really excited about us coming in for opening night, asked what we had ordered and was very excited about our choices. We got our food about five minutes later.My sandwich was AMAZING! So flavorful, really good portion, juicy and crispy. What more could you want in a sandwich?My boyfriend had the two piece meal, and as suggested, used the honey butter on his chicken. He absolutely loved it, crispy, perfectly spiced, juicy. He especially loved the boneless thigh. With the great food, good beers along with a good looking cocktail menu (didn't try any of the cocktails this time), we'll definitely be back!"
"I sincerely wish I had read the reviews on Yelp before visiting HBFC. I never would have walked into the place. My family has driven by this place every Sunday on our way to and back from church. We have been very curious and have heard really good things about it. Again, I wish I had visited Yelp. The minute I read ""$28 for 8 pieces and no sides"" any interest I had in the place would have dissipated. Fried chicken is one of those foods that should always have a low price point. Chicken pieces are inexpensive and seasonings and oil don't cost much. Their prices are ridiculous!! The chicken was pretty good on its own, without the butter, but again, with the price point, the chicken needed to be amazing!!! I don't understand the whole honey butter thing but we have heard great things and were curious so we tried it. It was pretty good, but really good fried chicken DOESN'T NEED ANYTHING!!!!!!! IT SHOULD STAND ON ITS OWN. Maybe a little hot sauce. The tip before you eat or are served is weird and extremely presumptuous. Tipping is based on your entire dining experience, food, service, atmosphere, etc. Not your experience of waiting in line and then ordering. I am glad I waited to tip until the end of our meal.  I was a little thrown by the boneless chicken thighs we received but that wasn't a big deal. I personally enjoy eating fried chicken off of the bone, just like my ribs. The flavor wasn't anything spectacular, just pretty good. The butter added sweetness to it, but I don't really like my fried chicken sweet. My wife ordered a side of the wings which were good. The sauce was really good. The Pimento mac n cheese was pretty good. A little starchy but not bad. Neither of our daughters (8 and 11) liked it though, which is not a good sign. The bread crumbs on top were soggy, almost like they had just sprinkled them on top. If you are going to put bread crumbs on mac n cheese they should be toasted. The kale/slaw salad was good. My wife really likes kale so this was a bonus for her. No surprise but the kids wouldn't touch it. The corn muffins were pretty good. Drinks were over priced. $6 for a domestic bottle and $8 for an 8oz mimosa is high. So, to recap..... $28 for 8 pieces of mediocre fried chicken, $8 for 8 wings, 2 tiny sides at $3.50 each, $5 for 2 sodas, an $8 mimosa and $6 domestic bottle and $67 later means I won't ever be returning to HBFC!  Thank God we are visiting Memphis this week and I will be going to Gus' World Famous to get some real fried chicken."
"You really can't go wrong with fried foods. The chicken was really tender and moist (ewww, I hate that word, but juicy sounds worse). I was pleasantly surprised by the honey butter and the fat kid inside of me wanted to slather it over everything! I just can't justify paying that much money for fried chicken and sides. We also tried one of the chicken sandwiches and it wasn't that great. If you go, definitely stick to the chicken and don't skimp with the honey butter. The macaroni and cheese had a little bit of a chalky after taste. I think Chicago has better fried chicken to offer (like Uncle Remus)."
"Hype was definitely realized with this place.  Everything we had was great.  Prices are reasonable.  Every single staff member was friendly and helpful.  Drinks were great.  I like the layout.  They were fast and efficient.  Did I mention the food was good?We got a 4 piece and several sides.  It caught me off guard that none of the pieces had bones except for the leg but I actually sort of liked it.  It was much simpler to eat.  It also struck me as odd that you would add butter to anything deep fried but the butter was a nice touch on some bites.  The chicken definitely stands on its own though.  Sides were great.  We got the standard offerings and the grits special.  I liked the kale and mac'n'cheese the most but they were all good.  Missed out on the Daily pickle special.  It was sold out.  Many items were actually sold out so if you want choices arrive early.I like that the bar is separate from the food order process.  I think it keeps things efficient.  I had the Michelada type drink, which was great and one with whiskey or bourbon.  I can't remember.  They were both excellent and reasonably priced at $7.  There is a decent beer and wine selection too.It will be interesting to see what happens in the winter as most of the seating is outdoors.  I'm sure it will be tented but we will see.  Definitely will be back."
"Sunday night at 9:30 and I was able to walk right up to the counter and order.  Woo hoo!Given the seemingly endless wait for HBFC to open and the breathless hype surrounding the place I was prepare to be a little let down.  For the food to be good but nothing mind blowing.Mind blown.  Giant pieces of chicken with an amazingly flavorful crust and juicy tender chicken underneath.  The Pimento Mac n Cheese was the kind of side that makes you fight with your loved ones over the last noodle.If I was going to point to a negative I would say that the sides (mac, corn bread) could be a bit bigger.  But honestly the quality is good enough to justify the cost."
"I heard about this establishment from many of my friends. All of whom said the same thing, excellent chicken and sides. Coming from a southern food background, I relished at the fact this could be a little taste of that southern cuisine in northern Chicago. How can the thought not cross my mind, with fried chicken, greens, mac and cheese, cornbread, and a side of honey butter for dipping on the menu.  After arriving with my family we were greeted promptly and with a smile. The host gave us a run down of the menu and proceeded to take our order. The first thing that turned me off was the fact they asked for a tip before the food or sevice beyond ordering occured.The presentation of the food when arrived at our table was good. It smelled good, was hot and steamy, and look good. We ordered fried chicken, buffalo wings, greens, mac and cheese, cornbread, and of course the honey butter. All this build up and my first bite was mehhh. The food was a real let down. Everything had a mediocre taste.  It was like the chef was afraid of too much seasoning, which resulted in not nearly enough. For the large price of $60 dollars, I would stay home and make my own chicken and buy my own honey butter. Not worth the money!"
"Meat was moist, even the white meat.  Great taste."
"Was not extremely slap happy about paying 45+ bucks for a dinner for two tonite. I mean, $28 for 8 pieces of chicken??!!! Was decent tasting, but pretty over-rated. I did enjoy the ""corn muffins"", as they are cute and have the mold of a bumble bee, and best eaten with their honey butter. Mac n cheese was decent. But still, 28 DOLLARS for chicken??!! I'll say this: That fried bird better have magic powers!!!!"
"This place was everything I dreamed it would be. We left, pants busting at the seams, and literally drove home being like, ""WANT. MORE. CHICKEN.""And seriously, read the sign folks: smother it in butter. SMOTHER, I tell you. You won't regret it.We had the mac 'n cheese and creamed corn. The mac 'n cheese was tasty--but nothing revolutionary. The creamed corn, however, was an absolutely delight. I realllllyyy hope they make it a permanent part of their menu, 'cause that ish is MONEY.I will return!"
"Came in for brunch.  The chicken and grits was outstanding, but the chicken and French toast was really where it's at."
"This place is amazing, and it's exactly what you'd expect: Honey butter. On fried chicken. And it's really, really good.Of course, that's not all. That's just the main draw. The corn muffins that come with the chicken are fantastic, some of the best Yankee cornbread I've had, a little sweet but not too sweet. They serve locally made hot sauce that's been aged in rum barrels  from a co-op, and it's some really good hot sauce. (Try the hot sauce with the butter on the corn muffins.)They also have some really sophisticated sides: the mashed potatoes are mixed with the rendered skin and fat (schmaltz) from each whole chicken they cut up, and it's tastier than duck fat fries. I also had the kale and cabbage salad, which is amazing. They have specials every day, too, which makes it a great place to come back to.They also have a ""pickle of the day"", which is good because I love pickles, and they have a different tea every day as well.And like any respectable hipster joint, everything is locally grown and manufactured."
"The place was extremely crowded but they seemed to be able to fly through the line which was nice.  seating was a challenge but sort of worked out in the end.  the place does seem to have a nice flow despite the crowdedness.  big downside though? the food seems to come out awkwardly.  mac and cheese before chicken.  one person is the party gets their food the rest of us wait 20 min.  i mean it isn't a fancy place or anything, but still.  just makes for an awkward dinner with friends.  the food is good but for those that wait the food doesn't seem any warmer or more fresh than the person who got their food first.  weird! if i'm going to wait, at least make it worth my while with hot, fresh food.  the sauce was pretty delightful though so maybe i'd do carry out again"
Way overrated! Very pricey! For very average chicken wasn't impressed at all. Save your money and go to other nearby places.
"I LOVE fried chicken and this was good but not amaze.  We split the fried chicken sandwich and the 2 piece meal.  Overall the sandwich was probably the best part of the meal but the bun was a little too thick so the taste of the chicken got lost and overpowered by the amazing candied jalapeno mayo.  With the 2 piece meal you get a drumstick, a breast, and a small muffin.  It was good, a little hard to split because the breast is small since it's been de-boned and I felt you NEEDED to douse everything in the butter or it would have been almost dry?  For sides we had the macaroni and cheese which was blah and the curried creamed corn side special - I would come back just for that!My husband and I didn't say one word to each other while eating, that is a sign of a good meal!  I wish I could give Honey Butter Fried Chicken 3.5 stars because it was good and I will be back to try it again."
"A fried chicken revelation!  It currently lives up to the hype!  The entire staff was patient, welcoming and informative despite being very crowded on a weekday night.  The kale salad lives up to its reputation as being a highly notable side dish and even a meal on its own!  Caveat: the biscuits are on the smaller side and I wouldn't particularly recommend the mashed potatoes.  They carry some interesting cocktails along with a good selection of Boylan sodas.Keep up the good work HBFC!"
"I love fried chicken so when passing by countless times I always said I'll stop in and today was the day. Dropped by with a friend and as soon as I walked in I had good feelings about it. Environment feels very clean with a ""Modern"" but ""Rustic"" look which is really inviting, new to how to order and seating it was easy just by asking the super friendly employees who work there. As I order I was surprised that they had a cocktail bar because how perfect that to have Chicken and Beer (Wine, Mixed Drinks)?! DOPE! I asked for a recommendation on what to order and went with the basic 2 piece Fried Chicken w/ a side Mac N Cheese, then went to sit in the back open patio which was AWESOME. Next tasting this BEAUTIFULLY looking Chicken had my taste buds going nuts, so fresh and original. The Honey Butter was WOW! I couldn't believe I've never tried this before, the Mac N Cheese was with the same level as the Chicken AMAZING. After trying out this out I knew for sure I'll be returning to try more, this place is a must try hands down."
"HBFC was delish! We typically avoid braving crowds at brand new joints- but we were drawn here like a moth to the flame...and we'll be back!The chicken is crunchrific with perfect texture & taste (to our palates).Go when it's decent weather, so you can eat on the nice patio, or else end up standing along the back walk as I did (still worth it). The bar is cool, staff is really great. Didn't get to sample the adult beverages this time, but the Ginger soda was outstanding & a perfect complement to the flavors of the chicken. We LOVE the hand washing station. Get the three-side meal. Toddlers might find the pimento mac&cheese too spicy (as mine did). Get the eight-piece to share and bring home leftovers (350F for15 min) - so yummy!"
"Awesome!  Really good fried chicken, put some delicious sweet honey butter on it, and add some corn bread I'm in heaven.  The creamed corn is delicious as well.  Highly recommended!"
"Just got home from Honey Butter Fried Chicken and it was quite tasty. I must say that I haven't tasted chicken quite like this. The skin is nice and crispy, but the secret ingredient is the smoked paprika salt - it really does give it a very unique flavor. They also serve a honey butter, which you are supposed to put onto the chicken - it's good, especially on the corn bread which is shaped like little honey combs. The cornbread is good but it is entirely too small - just order extra cornbread if you like cornbread.The only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars is because they really need to work on their side items. The macaroni and cheese was dry - it was like eating cheesy-flavored noodles - very little sauce. Stay away from the Chinese Broccoli - I was trying to be healthy and eat my vegetables, but I couldn't even eat half of this dish. They put tomato sauce in there, and I didn't enjoy the flavor at all. Too bitter and acidic for my taste buds. The creamed corn, however was very tasty.  I do plan to go back and visit, and the next time, I plan to get the fried chicken sandwich. The decor was cute - very simple restaurant, and kind of small with a nice patio in the back. It had a nice, neighborhood feel, and there were a couple of people there with their kids. (Although I thought that it was probably past their bedtime). Definitely worth a visit!"
"My boyfriend and I got there 10 minutes before 5 bc I read reviews that this place gets super busy. We decided on the 4pc with 2 sides of macaroni & cheese. We sat down & the food arrived pretty quickly, as expected since we were one of the first ones there. The corn muffins are amazing, I had to order more because they were that good.! The macaroni & cheese was okay, the first couple of bites were good but as I kept eating it started getting waaay too cheesy, as if it was drenched in cheese sauce, no bueno! Now the chicken was really good! If your not a chicken person this obviously wouldn't be the place for you. The honey butter added a lot of flavor! The only downside was that as I was eating my last piece of chicken, I noticed there was something on top of my chicken, it looked like something that came off a cleaning sponge, then again it could have flew in because one of the employees opened the patio door for quiet a long time. I told the manager and he was very kind to offer chicken to go at no charge, or some desserts. After getting home and trying the cookie and the brownie I doubt I will be back again. The brownie almost tastes like it has a hot spice in it, gross. And the cookie also had an extremely weird taste! The food is okay, but all the hype is not real"
"Some of the worse fried chicken I have ever had and expensive for what it is.  The Mac & Cheese was not good either.  The reviewer on Check Please must have been a relative of the owner.  Actually, Popeye's Chicken is much better.  Don't waste your money or time at Honey Butter Fried Chicken."
"Wow! Perfect chicken - incredibly moist & flavorful with a garlic/peppery crunchy crust. The delicious chicken pot pie side is more of a main dish than a side and sported an amazing cornbread streusel topping. The smashed potato & whipped sweet potato sides are wonderful creamy counterpoints to the crunchy chicken.Service was quick & friendly on a busy winter Friday evening. It seemed like there was always a line to order your food and yet everyone was able to find a place to sit and enjoy their meal.There is a great soundtrack, but it's not a place for intimate conversations. Lots of fun chatter in close proximity. We didn't have any drinks , but they all loked good.Slighty higher priced than your average chicken joint, but the food is well worth it! We will be back - maybe tomorrow."
"I work in the Hospitality Industry and appreciate businesses that go above and beyond...here is my exceptional experience:My parents and I went over Thanksgiving Weekend on what I assume was a very slow night as we heard the line can be out the door. We had already braced ourselves for a very long wait but, when we walked in, there were only a couple people in front of us. When we put in our order, the last table was taken (you order at the counter, get a number, and a host finds you a seat as one opens up). We were offered a seat at the bar but my parents prefer a table, so we hung out in the bar area until a table opened up.We waited only about 20 minutes for a table and the host must have checked in on us at least 4 times to apologize for the wait and kept us updated. We weren't even annoyed/upset with the wait, but he offered us a round of drinks - completely unnecessary but, took him up on the offer. Once a table opened up, our food quickly came out. We thought we had the wrong order because they gave us 4 extra sides. We were told that the extra sides were given as an apology for the wait...where do you get this kind of service?! We were so impressed and we hadn't even tried the food...speaking of the food, here are some of the highlights:-Dark Meat Fried Chicken -Chicken and Grits-Schmalz Smashed Potatoes-Pimento Macaroni and Cheese-Dump Cake of the Day (we had Cranberry Apple)-Boylan Black Cherry Soda -Green River - I didn't get this but any place that carries Green River automatically gets a 5 star review! :)Thanks again for the amazing service!"
"I have tried honey butter items at wingfest and at baconfest but this was my first visit to their restaurant.  I had high hopes.  The sides were great- definitely recommend the creamed corn, Mac and cheese and dessert cobbler.  The sauce on the chicken sandwich as amazing!  My only criticism with the meAl was that clearly the chicken had been cooked earlier and was not hot off the fryer."
"I was so excited when this place opened around the corner from my new apartment.  I was avoiding reviewing this lovely restaurant because it's been so hyped and well-reviewed that I was worried the good press would cause giant lines on the order of  Hot Doug's and Kuma's.  But you know, sometimes you just can't stop the momentum of a great new placeThere is hype for a good reason.  Yes, putting honey butter on fried chicken feels like gilding the lily but I promise you, the chicken by itself is awesome.  Crispy on the outside with a smoky flavor and tender on the inside.  We tried 3 sides and they were delicious and new.  I can't say I don't love traditional southern sides but they've been done to death.  Eating a kale salad with yogurt-cumin dressing was perfect.The least exciting part of the meal was the corn muffin, though it was oh so cute, being made in a hexagonal mold.  The honey butter adds moisture to the good corn flavor.I'll be back, waiting in whatever line occurs, checking out how the winter changes their seasonal sides and checking out their cocktails."
"Amazing chicken and great atmosphere. The corn muffins, sweet potato salad, and craft cocktails were also terrific. We will definitely be back."
"Loved this place!!I got the $10 two-piece fried chicken lunch special which comes with a corn cake and 1 side. I got the creamed corn. My husband got the same thing, but with mashed potatoes. Everything was so good!!! Price is a little on the high side for the portions, but the food was amazing. Would definitely come back as a special treat!!"
Best meal we've had in awhile. And we had carry out- was still warm after the 10 minute drive home. Tons of food for the price. Get more butter on the side. Trust me.
"The first time we tried to go to HBFC they ran out of chicken. Yep, a place that specializes in fried chicken ran out of chicken. We finally made it there today for lunch and it was def worth the trip. We split a 4 piece and got the sweet potato salad and kale slaw. The chicken came as 2 drumsticks and 2 large boneless pieces and the honey butter on top was a magical addition. The sides were light and refreshing and were just enough for two people to split. We didn't get drinks and our bill was still over $25, so while it was delish, I doubt we will pick HBFC over Parsons."
"This HBIC, like many Chicagoans, wanted a big nasty offering of HBFC. I'd read the many write-ups, enjoyed the decadent commentary, and appreciated the overall design of what this resto was putting out there. I couldn't wait to get my hands on some of that fried goodness.A group of friends and I had eagerly planned a trip to HBFC a couple weeks its opening. There was still a decent line out the door and the vibe was exactly what I was looking for on an otherwise low-key Friday night. Honey Butter Fried Chicken is like one of those good ol' joints where the charm lies in its simplicity.From the minimal, barn-like decor, communal patio seating and wooden furniture, the rustic atmosphere immediately sets the tone for some down-home comfort. That's not the only area where HBFC decided to keep things simple either. From the scaled back menu, choosing to focus more on quality versus quantity, though limited with menu items, the ones featured did have a great attention to detail like the chili glazed chicken wings, or the kale and cabbage slaw. Unfortunately, however, the actual Honey Butter Fried Chicken didn't live up to all the hype. Though the breading and deep fry had a nice thick texture and crisp to it, and the chicken juicy and tender (as chicken should always be), the chicken itself tasted under-seasoned and bland. I tasted more grease from the deep-fry rather than a nice flavor to the chicken - and that was disappointing. I suppose if I slathered the chicken with a bunch of complimentary hot sauce and honey flavored butter then I'm sure I'd be singing a different tune, but let's be honest: well-seasoned chicken should be able to stand on its own without copious amounts of condiments.At the end of the day, the chicken is just okay, and gets an extra star when topped with its signature honey flavored butter. In my humble opinion, however, really good chicken shouldn't have to be slathered in anything in order to good. It should really stand on its own."
"A read a review on this place before my visit that pointed out that fried chicken is soul food, and soul food is known for its big portions and affordability, and that HBFC doesn't get that. So when I broke down and visited this place, I found that charging 8 bucks for a tiny portion of fried chicken with a piece of cornbread the size of my big toe IS definitely strange to me.The chicken was juicy and the breading was crunchy and intact. Hey, they've got that down. But the honey butter is a gimmick - nothing special about it at all. I'm a fried chicken connoisseur, and my conclusion is that sure, the chicken is cooked well, but spending $8 without a full, happy belly? I'd do better to make it myself for a third of the cost with my Southern family's ""secret recipe."""
"It's crazy packed and tiny. There are interesting sodas in the self serve fountain, and a bar in back. The fried chicken was okay- it was obvi fried in advance in large batches because it was cool and dark. The sides were bad- they were cold and very small. The kale had a piece of dry bacon or something in it like an afterthought, and seemed to have fake smoke flavor added. The Mac and cheese was good but made with velveeta. The chicken tenders dish was vile. It was a bed of decent grits swimming in hot sauce, with a few pieces of chicken skin and gristly chicken meat in it. I couldn't believe how gross it was."
"I am not a fried chicken expert or connoisseur.  In fact, I don't even like fried chicken all that much.  But I do like an old-fashioned style fried chicken, and fell for all the hype.In their defense, it's probably better eaten there rather than carryout.  I did like the breading, and I certainly have NO opposition to slathering a mixture of honey and butter on almost anything.  But the first piece of chicken I had was more slimy fat than meat.  It was pretty gross, actually.  I guess I just had the misfortune of getting a piece of a bird that didn't enjoy exercise so much.  I did not at all like the Roasted Sweet Potato Salad, and I rarely meet a sweet potato that I don't like.  The Mac and Cheese was just ok, as were the Corn Muffins.  My favorite part of the meal was the Dump Cake of the Day, which I believe was some plum concoction.  It was delicious.Will try  Honey Butter Fried again, but maybe not carryout."
"Line was out the door at 5:30p, but turnover was reasonably quick and the wait was worth it for some quality southern comfort food."
"we came on a chilly night and gotfried chicken - ok, much better with the butterthought the fried chicken was over priced and just ok."
"Super yum. We came at about 9pm on a Saturday night and had no trouble getting a table, and our food came really quick too. That chicken...mmm...super super juicy and tender, with a perfectly crunchy and flavorful crust. It was good both without and with that honey butter on top. I loved those little corn muffins too. It's funny, at the time I really liked but didn't love the pimiento Mac n cheese and the mashed potatoes with chicken gravy, but they tasted *awesome* the next day for leftovers.I didn't know anything about this place before we came so I had no expectations, maybe that helped. The prices are high, I give you that, but so is the quality. I'm a fan, I'd go back even though I live nowhere near this place."
"The fried chicken and chicken sammys are so good! I love how they come deboned. We didn't try any sides as they weren't recommended by friends, but I've noticed that the mac n cheese was mentioned in several reviews. I'm not a fan of their corn muffins though. They're really cute, but would prefer biscuits. The honey butter is fantastic. I do agree with some previous reviews that they can ease up on the spice. It's not necessarily spicy, but has a weird taste. It reminds me of ramen seasoning."
I've been here a couple times they have great chicken not to mention the butter.  The soda doesn't have processed sugars and they have alcohol.
"Sooooo so good and the staff is all super friendly.  I went with the chicken sandwich and a side of sweet potato salad - both very good but think I should have gone straight parts with extra butter.  The breading is just the right amount of spice with a great crunch.  I did head back to the line for a round of corn muffins for the table - eat them warm!  Put the honey butter on everything, seriously EVERYTHING then maybe top it with the hot sauce. I think we hit the right night because we had almost no line.  Thanks Jordan for the tips!"
The fried chicken was delicious although I enjoyed it more without the honey butter. It was slightly salty with a nice blend of black and white pepper. I can see why people like the honey butter since it gives you the sweet/salty combo like Chicken and Waffles.I did like to slather the honey butter on the corn muffins. It would be nice if they were bigger or you get a couple more. The pimento mac and cheese was yummy but I didn't enjoy the cold sweet potato salad.A 2-piece is $8 (with no sides or drink). That's $4 for a piece of chicken with half a corn muffin! It wasn't really unique enough to justify the cost.
"By far the best fried chicken I have ever had,  ended up getting a side of Mac n cheese and had to scrape the bottom of the container because I didn't want to waste the cheese left over . Yes it was that good!!! The cornbread ( I think is cornbread) literally melted in your mouth . To say everyone was nice in there is an understatement , every worker in there was beyond polite and welcoming. Even had one worker suggest a type of soda for me ( orange mandarine ) which was kick ass. Nothing makes me want to come back more than how establishments treat their customers, and HBFC knocked that out the park . You guys are running a great business and will be here for a long long time and without a doubt I'll  be back plenty of times.Mind you I  had to pay $ 725 in unpaid parking tickets earlier ( which I didn't know about) but I sunk my sorrow into some delicious food :)"
"I'm so sad it just opened. So sad because I will be leaving for Nashville and will not have this as an option. Went on a Sunday right when it opened and there was already a 30 minute line. It was ok bc one of the people who worked came and handed menus to people waiting and welcomed everyone. For a restaurant that is brand new, they had a pretty good process going on. Everything seemed so thought out. The bar in the middle of the patio and the main dining room was smart so as not to crowd the dining area. I loved all the higher quality fountain drinks. I did not get a chance to try the cocktails, but I will make it a goal of mine to come one more time before I leave this great food city and have a pitcher of an adult beverage in their warm and inviting restaurant. We got the 4-piece and the sandwich as well as a few sides. The slaw and jalapeno mayo on the sandwich was delicious. The chicken...oh the chicken! It was juicy, steamy, crispy with a hint of spice. That batter is amazing. LIght and not too oily. Just wow. I was so surprised how the honey butter set the flavor off! We had the Chinese Broccoli. My bf loved it. I was not a huge fan. I did love the pimento mac and cheese. The heirloom tomato salad seemed like there was too much going on, but the pickled carrot and beets were delish. I will try the kale/cabbage slaw next time! The price we paid for what we got was fair and we still have another meal in leftovers. Cannot wait to come back!"
"I have a hard fast rule that I broke today by mistake. You should never go to any restaurant recommended by Brittney Payton on Chicago's Best.  Honey Butter Fried Chicken is a solid example as to why Brittney has no reason to be a food critic. ""Everything is not good!""I drove to HBFC today after the AFC Championship game. Traffic was light and when I arrived, there was no line outside. I only waited about 7 minutes to place my order.  Every seat was occupied in the front and back. I ordered the two piece with Mac and Cheese and a chicken sandwich.  I could see the other people eating and  the food was very appealing to the eye.   This is where the good part ends. Several people have already written reviews on Yelp and have stated that the chicken is tasteless and lacking in flavor. I fully agree. The coating is a great brown color and  has a great crunch.  However, it has no taste. It is as if no one explained that seasoning is required to bring flavor to chicken. I was extremely disappointed. The cornbread biscuit was the size of a quarter and would not satisfy a one year old baby's appetite.   The Mac and Cheese is a complete disaster.  Picture  noodles cooked with CheeseWiz and packed  hard before being heated in a microwave.  I have seen kids meals at Friday's with better Mac and Cheese. It was awful. Once again' Brittney Payton was the cause of $23.00 extracted from my bank account and basically thrown away."
"I am bumping my review up to 4-stars. We stopped here recently and tried their mac n cheese with a piece of chicken breast and corn bread. The mac n cheese was excellent. The pasta was not mushy and I love that they use rotini which soaks up the cheese perfectly. I could taste the quality in the cheese(s) for the mac n cheese. Yes, this place is over priced, but once in a while I don't mind dropping some bucks for freshly made food that tastes like something your mother or grandmother may prepare for Sunday dinner. The food here definitely tastes fresh and home-made! The deep flash fried of the chicken already has plenty of fat and calories, so I never smother my chicken in butter. I don't even like butter on my pancakes or waffles. I can't imagine eating this food on a regular basis, because it is not the healthiest food to consume. The food is stick-to-your ribs hearty. We enjoyed the patio on a beautiful summer day. Although the chicken here is fairly good and worthy of 4-stars, I still believe that ""My Mother's Kitchen"" has 10-star chicken. Service receives 5-stars (we had a fantastic server and appreciated the suggestions/recommendations)."
"So the food was awesome, and the lines are long -- lots of reviews will say that.I got a samme, my hubs unfortunately got a ""pot pie"" thinking that it was going to you know, be a pot pie. Nope.  It was in fact a very tasty side dish, inspired by pot pie but by no means should have been sold as such. He didn't want to wait in line to order again (because the food was to-go) and left feeling bummed about it. He got home, ate it, said it tasted great but he was still hungry even with 2 sides that we split. Bummed and hungry aren't good feelings to be left with. So there's that.I could eat curry creamed corn for breakfast though."
"Went here for dinner tonight with the family -- a change from our predicable rotation of ""established"" Chicago restaurants. For our party of four, we ordered the 8 piece chicken and the 3 side combo (because it came with an extra biscuit).Everything was delicious. I heart honey butter to begin with, but pair it with super tender chicken with a tasty breading and I'm sold. The Kale and Cabbage Slaw surprised me -- I'm typically not a slaw fan but it was a nice, refreshing choice to have alongside our other, heavier sides. The Pimento Mac 'n Cheese was an interesting twist but didn't floor me. The Whipped Sweet Potatoes (a special) came with the requisite marshmallow topping and were great. The biscuits were good but nothing special -- and also a little too small for my taste (bigger = more surface area for honey butter!).All in all though, a great meal. I'd had given it 5 stars if Sweet Cheeks Q and M3 in Boston/Somerville hadn't already set the bar oh-so-very high. (Sorry, Chicago. I love ya, but NOTHING can beat Sweet Cheek's basket o' biscuits with honey butter.)"
"Awesome friend chicken and southern cocktails. Great service, great food. Happy happy happy. Next time I will the largest fried chicken order instead of just the 2 piece!"
"Finally got to go here after months of waiting.  Since this is in our neighborhood, even better.  I am thrilled to see this group of young people go full force into the crowded and competitive Chicago restaurant scene. I am an entrepreneur myself, so happy to see it.We got here at 8PM on a Sunday-so no crowds.  The overhaul from La Finca is a awesome-that place was awful.  We got four pieces of chicken, Pimento mac and cheese and Kale and Cabbage Salad.1. The chicken.  I have never tasted fried chicken like this in my life.  I can't quite put my finger on it but the unami to it has me suspect that some manner of pork lard is involved.  You don't really need the honey butter for every single bite of it, so I suggest eat some with it and some with out.  The chicken was amazing, what you would get from a organic local farm.2. Pimento Mac and Cheese.  I fought my husband over it and he doesn't like stuff like this normally.  He ended up eating 90% of it.  And this is the man who lives off of fast food, candy and diet coke.  If you can impress him with something as ""out there"" as pimento mac and cheese, BRAVO.  We once went to Arun's for my birthday and by the end of the night the waiter said he had stumped the chef.  So again BRAVO.3. Kale and Cabbage salad. I ate this alone and I actually drank the dressing at the end.4. Corn bread thingies. Meh for me.  Husband loved em.With that said, I am not a fried chicken person per say. Husband is.  I do like spicy vs butter, but I wouldn't want to put any heat on this fried chicken and just have as is.  We both thought we should definitely take out of town guests here as a go to place.  I would go here myself maybe a couple of times a year.  Husband will probably want to go more often!"
"I enjoyed my experience here and am a generous 5 star yelper... sorry this place will NOT disappoint.  i think its a bit pricey for what it is but its really good.  the price will keep me from making it a ""regular"" stop.i was also shocked the thigh was boneless - i like the bone but it didnt hurt the flavor.  line was manageable and i liked that they were offering small samples of wine while in line - thats a class act.worth the visit and will be back in 6 months."
Placed a carry out order because I've seen the line out the door and down the block. The ease of picking up is spectacular. Thank you so much for that!!The fried chicken is delicious. It does have a soggier breading but it makes it easier to absorb the honey butter. The honey butter is so frickin fantastic. I wish I could purchase a pint of it. Corn muffins are spot on! Mac & cheese and mashed potatoes are excellent. Can't wait to try more!!!
"I was so excited this place to open last summer and when it did finally open..I took my time to go..lots of hype..lousy hours..long lines..hmmm. Well they finally extended their hours and now open for lunch. So after months, I finally get to try this famous fried chicken. ..expensive at that.... I split the 8 piece for $28? with 4 corn muffins. .and got a side of the pimento mac n cheese. .Was I impressed. .we'll not really. ..it was decent,  I've had better fried chicken. .Honey Butter spread for the chicken was nothing memorable. .will I go back? Probably. .I'll give it another chance."
"DAMNMy favorite food.  With a menu like this they have all the time in the world in my book to get the total experience up.   Great server, who was very much a fan of the place she worked and I feel it was translated in her service.   Thanks folks.   Can't wait til me next meal there."
"First time try. It was pretty good but the price is a little high for a few pieces. Drinks are good. The atmosphere and people there a are nice. Will come back but definitely not to often because of the $$$. Spent 22$ on a four piece, side and a drink. Over all a good experience."
"Loved this place. Chicken was great. Spices were spot on and once I put the butter on top.... Mmmm... I thought I died and went to fried chicken heaven. I love that the chicken is boneless. Sides were only alright, I will probably try something different next time I go back. I got the Mac and Cheese, my husband got the smashed potatoes I thought they were both too rich and could have been simplified since obviously the chicken and corn muffins are the stars here. They were definitely good just not what I wanted. I also love the cane sugar soda fountain and am obsessed with any place that has Green River. I will be back!"
"Honey Butter Fried Chicken did live up to the hype for me. Maybe I was there on a stellar night, but the chicken was remarkable without the addition of the honey butter (I saved that for the hexagon cornbread muffins)! The chicken was moist; the batter had a great crunch and a great spicy taste. The grits were the best I've ever had in a restaurant, the mac and cheese was also probably one of the best I've ever had, the greens were okay and the sweet potato salad was decent (we had creamed corn on the mind and they were sold out, poor sweet potatoes never had a chance). Pair the fare with a couple 5 Rabbits Golden Ales and it results in happiness. The price is staggering ($50 for fried chicken, sides, and drinks); therefore I can only give it four stars."
"It's hard to find restaurants in this particular area that are even decent.  When I saw that this place opened I was ecstatic! A clean, well managed deep fried chicken place! Yay!My boyfriend and I decided to do a take-home since the indoor seating was full and it was a bit too chilly to eat outside. We liked the concept of this place. Place your order first, then find a seat. More a first come, first serve idea.  No reservations.  No hosts.  The menu is short but sweet. They had a few specials, however we did not order them.  We ordered the chicken sandwich (YUM!) and a 2 piece that came with a teeny tiny corn bread, a teeny tiny half filled tub of honey butter, and two very delicious and yummy pieces of deep fried chicken.  We also got a side of mac & cheese. WOW, awesome! That's all.  Overall great concept, service is quick and friendly, and the food is amazing! However I am an American so PLEASE don't skimp out on the carbs and extra fat honey butter!"
"It's a cute place, with nice staff, but the food wasn't up to par. The chicken was super bland. It had too much breading, and the breading tasted a little burnt. The smashed potatoes had a good flavor, but they were way too runny. The grits were also too runny.  One good thing though is that everything did seem fresh."
"I've had the chicken sandwich on two occasions and both times they were FAB!!  We've tried Parson's chicken and Leghorn and Honey Butter is the best.  Parsons was a close second, but Leghorn was not even close. Leghorn was too salty and very heavy breading.  Honey Butter has the right combination of ingredients in their sandwich.  I was also surprised how tasty the kale side was and I don't like kale."
"I'm not sure when Honey Butter Fried Chicken will actually open their location, but I attended a dinner they were hosting at Half Acre Brewery last night.  Let me tell you...this was a hella good fried chicken sandwich.  The chicken itself was juicy, tender and delicious...as if they somehow got the honey butter on the inside.  It was served on a pretzel type roll with an amazing slaw on the sandwich.  Delicious.  Wait, no.  Juicy and delicious.  They told me to grab a wet wipe, so I did (because I follow directions well) although I couldn't imagine needing it for a fried chicken sandwich.  I needed it.  The juices were-a-flowin'.  Then, on the side, they had a sweet potato salad.  Man..I love a sweet potato and this salad was divine!!   I'm looking forward to stopping by once they're open and seeing their full menu.  Also,word on the streets is that this place will be open late night...like til 2am...and that's awesome.  A nice alternative to diners and burritos."
"What a simple but great concept! Yes the lines are intimidating but they move pretty fast - you can grab cocktails at the bar and bring them back to your group while you wait, then you put in your order, get a table #, grab a table on their fantastic heated outdoor patio, and a few minutes later, BAM chicken in yo face!The fried chicken is good...with a selection of white meat and drumsticks to choose from (wishing there were thighs and wings in the assortment though!).  The batter has good flavor, well seasoned with paprika and other spices.  The honey butter in my opinion is over kill to put on the chicken...its better suited to help flavor the unfortunately dry, lackluster corn bread.  The sides were a standout - we ordered one of each.  The kale salad is yogurty/cuminy and refreshing, the sweet potatoes with lime are a new take, and  the pimento mac and cheese was our favorite.  All in all, I prefer the fried chicken at other places that have a more light and crispy batter (The Southern's spicy fried chicken is pretty amazing, for example), but everything together combined for a very enjoyable experience.  Service was great.  We will be back for sure - the order of wings looked particularly delish so I will try that next time."
"I work near this place and have been waiting for it to open for some time now. It finally opened and I was excited to experience my first taste of Honey Butter Fried Chicken.I wanted to really enjoy the chicken sandwich that I received, but I feel like I was ripped off. I ordered the chicken sandwich that states there is crunchy coleslaw, jalapeno mayo, and  boneless thigh meat. The bun was nice and fresh, so that was a plus. The ""crunchy coleslaw"" consisted of just a handful of red cabbage. The chicken was the most disappointing part. I probably received about a chicken nuggets worth of meat, the rest was all breading. I was so disappointed. 2 stars for the sandwich.The extra star was for the service, they are super nice and courteous, but they food is not worth the price."
"Okay, just got on yelp to start reviewing things because I'm really bored. And I thought, ""I HAVE TO REVIEW HONEY BUTTER!!!!""!!! And I was EXTREMELY surprised to see they only had 3.5 stars. This place is one of my favorite places in all Chicago!I have had their original fried chicken sandwich,  the club and just the regular friend chicken. The original is my favorite, but all are MMMMM SOOO FRIGGIN GOOD. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. I can't wait to try everything else! And I have unfortunately never gone to brunch but their pictures on facebook always look decadent!None of the sides have really stood out to me as particularly special, but they are still good too. If you eat there a little before closing time, they might give you free brownies or cookies or something! :) Also, the owner is super super nice. I like supporting businesses of super nice people. There are three things I don't love: 1) I feel like I must have gained 10 pounds in one sitting every time I go. 2) Kinda expensive and  3) sometimes there is a long line, but it goes pretty quickly. But despite all of these, SOOO WORTH IT MMM.MMMMMMMMmmmm."
"I was really excited to visit this place and may have over-hyped it in my head, but my experience was just O.K. The chicken itself is really tender and you can tell that the breading is from scratch but you don't get much. The honey butter comes separately and I found that it took quite a bit to alter the flavor. The biscuits were awesome, but very small. The space itself was cozy, but had nothing that was particularly noteworthy; not a bad thing, just sayin.   I would consider the whole meal to be a snack at meal prices, but it's definitely worth checking out if you haven't. And if Piece pizza is still doing the honey butter fried chicken pizza, you should DEFINITELY check that out."
Super good! Fried  chicken was not too greasy and the chicken was super tender!
Went w a gf tonight & it was steady but not packed. Got the 4 piece thigh (they are boneless and it's not processed) DeLiSh and got a taste portion of the potpie was to DiE for. PUT THE HONEY BUTTER ON THE FRIED CHICKEN. It'll melt in your mouth! The ppl were v friendly and we made small talk with our closely sat diner friends. I'll be back.
"I hate to say it... But I was extremely disappointed in what I thought would be fried chicken so good that you just can't stop eating it. The chicken's texture reminded me of a rubber chicken you see comedians throwing around on tv. Both the fried chicken Sammy and the 2 piece breasts gave hubby and I the sensation of chewing on rubber bands coated in deep fried breading. Kinda gross. Very sad seeing that this is a new and exciting foodie addition to my old hood. What up 60618!? Is HBFC all hype? I'm willing to try it again only because it's within walking distance and getting there @ 5pm makes for a short wait in line. One redeeming factor for HBFC was the itty bitty scoop of pimento Mac and cheese that I gobbled down after quitting on my unsavory sandwich. Dessert was a pb&j dump cake which was once again teenie tiny...good, but nothing to write home about. All in all, this 1/2 eaten early dinner was not worth the $30 I paid for it."
"Eh, that's all I can say.  I'm sad about this.  Yes, the honey butter is the star of the show - light, sweet, amazing.  But, the chicken is just sad.  Crust is tasteless without the honey butter.  And except for the legs, it's boneless pressed meat.  The dark meat was especially nasty.  When all you're doing is chicken as a main dish, how can you not produce a product better than a chain like Popeye's?!  Sides are good, but I just can't get over the bland chicken.  Service is hipster and efficient.  Place is mobbed most of the time.  They were nice to our kid, which I appreciate."
"I was here for the Sunday Brunch, and really enjoyed it. I was afraid it would be a crazy wait time and it was not. The have a good system.You place your order  and get a number. They space it out, so a table is ready for you. We had the chicken and grits, chicken with corn muffin and Andouille sausage gravy, pimento Mac and cheese and a biscuit. All delicious and affordable.  Staff was friendly and asked numerous times, if we enjoyed our food. I did feel pressured to get up, as soon as we were done eating."
Went soon after opening. Long line - I hate no reservations and long lines. Line moved pretty fast.  Got some chicken and honey butter and sides.  Service was good and the staff was helpful. There are much much better fried chix places in Chicago and Evanston.  The food also gave us stomach issues.  Pricey for what we got. Not good value.  Will not be returning.
"Had a carry out order this evening and was left hungry and still craving delicious fried chicken. The chicken menu was very short which I thought was odd for a chicken place. No options for type, or extra pieces. Was also quite expensive for what you get.I opened my takeout box to instant sadness. If the pieces were larger, or the tiiiiny corn muffins were larger, I wouldn't feel so jipped( and still hungry)!Muffins, meh.Chicken, meh.Ate it with and without butter. Also tried the ranch... Was reeeeally bad. All in all, it left me disappointed and still craving fried chicken."
"Don't Believe The HypeThis place is great don't get me wrong, but I just wasn't impressed. I showed up on a Saturday afternoon ready to enjoy their chicken and french toast ( maybe that was a bad choice) and I found myself paying a price that for an incredible brunch experience would be fine with me, but the 40 dollars for an entree a side and a coffee x2 to be served on a paper plate and to be sat down in such close proximity to people was a little bothering. I love people, and it doesn't bother me to eat off a paper plate or to even share the same table with others. But it just didn't fit the place. They were obviously going for the southern hospitality feel that to be honest just was so half assed haha. They should have just gone all in. Put me in a picnic table, and give me a roll of paper towels, but it was just awkwardly placed tables about 6 inches away from one another and it was loud. The chicken was really good. It was hot and flaky and everything you'd want from fried chicken, but on french toast. COME ON!? ARE YOU REALLY TRYING TO BE THAT COOL THAT CHICKEN AND WAFFLES ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH!??? YOU HAVE TO BE SO DIFFERENT! BLEH! It was just too much, the flavors didn't mix well, and separate they would have been great but by no means should those be paired. The sides we went with were macaroni and cheese and a sweet potato salad. Those sides were by far the best part of the experience. THAT MAC AND CHEESE IS MERCILESS TO YOUR TASTE BUDS AND I COULD MURDER A COUPLE THINGS IN ORDER TO EAT THAT SWEET POTATO SALAD ON A NICE SUMMER'S DAY PICNIC. Now the coffee, HOLY SHIT, MY PANTS! That coffee was from a different planet! I've never felt so caffeinated in my entire life! I had two cups where a single sip would have sufficed, so no complaints on that end.In conclusion of my messy hangover of a rant:1. This place is super hyped, like ""DUDE, THIS PLACE IS THE F*CKING BEEEESSSSSSTTTT!!!!  NAH2. This place has some caring employees and an incredibly good looking red headed man that could melt anyones heart into a mush of existence (no homo) 3. The Chicken is good, and the honey butter is quite the rush.4. I didn't think i'd be bothered so much about a seat yourself place for brunch. BRUNCH IS MEANT TO BE SAT BY A HOST and to be enjoyed and to create conversation about the weather and the weekday funnies""Oh did you see that Marmaduke Cartoon HOLY SHIT IT WAS HILARIOUS!"""" GET FUZZY!?? YEAH COME ON! I WAS IN STITCHES!""""IT WAS 50 DEGREES ON FRIDAY?!"" ""YEAH! IS IT SUMMER YET?? COME ON!""things of the sortthis place is great but the hype is a bit much. Give me a patio some sweet tea and bourbon with this chicken and i'll be writing a completely different review"
"Delicious, delicious, delicious! This is the best fried chicken I've ever had, served with some really tasty sides. Don't forget to smear on the honey butter - it really makes it special. The space is beautiful, with an amazing patio. Everyone who works there is friendly, chatty, and kind. You can tell that they love what they do, which makes the space even warmer."
"Wow, officially my favorite fried chicken! Some people don't like the De-boned deal but I like it, no cheating the amount of chicken you get, the side are so different but each better than the last! Oh, and Goose island root beer!  I will definitely be back here!"
"The meh says it all.  Within one bite of our food, my friend and I both looked at each other and shook our heads.  The best part about the meal was the corn muffins with the honey butter.  The sides and the chicken, thumbs down."
"Yes, all the of the hype is true. I have never been a fan of white meat, I've always preferred dark because it's more tender and tastier. Well, that's all changed because of HBFC. Their chicken, both white and dark, is super tender, super tasty. Great sides and drinks too, although I don't remember the specific items I ordered. 100% worth the trip, although it goes without saying that it's obviously not really good for you."
"Our first and our last visit, we stopped about 1 pm. We waited 25 minutes for carry out, too long for me. The 2 pc. chicken was nothing special and very small pieces. The tenders are removed from the breast  so what you're getting is rib meat and flabby skin  Not impressed."
"omg i absolutely love this place , they have thee best chicken ive ever tasted hands down !!!!! cant wait to go back"
"We went here based on the advice of one of our friends and were told it was some of the best fried chicken they have had.  I also heard from another person who was originally from the south that this chicken was amazing (and southerners know their fried chicken).  I am originally from Alabama so this news was very exciting to me.  We arrived around 6:30 (after a twenty minute drive and pretty easy street parking) to a line out the door and proceeded to wait for about 3 minutes in the freezing cold and then made our way into the corridor before the actual entrance (where some very rude ladies thought it better for them to open the door so that they could keep themselves out of the wind and make the rest of us inside suffer since they couldn't be inside) and finally made it into the entrance to the wonderful feeling that is heat.  We then waited a little longer inside until my husband discovered you could go up to the front if you wanted to place a to go order (no clear signs labelling any of this so you have no idea why the random guy who just came in just bypassed the whole line and went to the counter).  We got our 2 eight pieces (we had another person with us and honestly thought we could polish off that much fried chicken), an order of smashed potatoes, pimento mac and cheese and the kale cabbage slaw pretty quickly.  So quickly in fact that my husband and his dad were still working on the beers they ordered to drink while they waited.  Once we got everything home the sides were a little cold and the chicken was still warm.  I don't know if the containers they give you for take out are the best at insulating heat.  None of us were that impressed by the chicken.  It's seasoned alright, has a nice crispy breading and is juicy and tender, but nothing to write home about.  I tried putting some honey butter on the chicken and still was not impressed.  Don't get me wrong-the honey butter is AMAZE-balls an di fantastic on teh corn muffins, but I don't want my chicken to taste sweet.  The kale cabbage slaw was good though maybe a bit to much cumin for my taste and the mac and cheese was ok.  The smashed potatoes were terrible. In summary, service was good and people were friendly, wait was horrendous in the cold, food was quick, but was just ok.  If I lived in the area and oucld quickly see there was not a long wait, I would probably be back, otherwise I don't think I'll be visiting again for a while."
"I went here yesterday for my ""cheat"" meal...Food was delicious...ordered over the phone and was able to pay over the phone, they said it would be ready in 15 min...it was ready and hot when I got there and the employee at the counter double checked the order so I was in and out in 5 minutes tops. The chicken was juicy not dry at all, mac and cheese had a great ""kick"" to it and the mashed potatoes and gravy were flavorful....sweet potato salad was something I'd never had before so that was a pleasant surprise as well...my only complaint was that they had run out of the ""cobbler of the day""."
Just had HBFC tonight my friends brought it over straight from the restaurant.  Well the way they bragged on it I was excepting to be blown away.  And sorry to say HBFC was no tornado but more like a light breeze off Lake Michigan.  In other words it cools you off but it does not blow you  away.  The chicken was moist I'll give them that.  But their seasoning tasted like they just took a bottle of Lawry's Seasoning Salt and sprinkled it on.  It is okay in a pinch if you willing to pay $28.00 for some average tasting chicken.  I'm not so I won't be eating it again.  By the way I know I can do better fried chicken at my own home.  In my opinion HBFC needs to improve their recipe if they want to blow me away in the Windy City.
"I beg of you to go here. Slather the chicken with butter - it's lights out. Not only is the skin good, the meat is flavorful as well. Solid whiskeys too. Outdoor patio - why not?!?"
"This was not what I expected, and I would probably not return.  You order at a counter and they bring your food out to you on a tray.  The menu was pretty limited in choices and quite expensive-$10 average per entree- for this style of food and service. The guy at the register was informative and very friendly.  My husband ordered the 4 piece dinner with smashed potatoes and schmaltz gravy and I had the chicken and grits, which was described as roasted chicken tenders with roasted garlic grits and crunchy chicken bits.  We ordered no drinks but did add a cookie and our check total was over $30.00.The 4 piece was boneless- what?  You lose so much flavor when you cook chicken off the bone, but to give them credit, it was very jjuicy.  The breading was crunch but quite heavy, and tasted heavily of garlic.  The potatoes and gravy were simply delicious and well seasoned.  The corn muffins were okay but tasted better with the honey butter that was also good on the chicken.My chicken and grits turned out to be a bowl of grits topped with chopped pieces of boneless chicken breast, Buffalo sauce, green onions and crunchy bits of chicken breading.  The whole thing was fine, but not what I was expecting from the menu description.  I did like the texture offered by the crunchy chicken bits.We went at 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon, and the place was packed.  There is additional seating at the counters in the back room by the bar."
"We went on a Thursday night with a party of 8; 4 of which were children.  We were shown to the back where they put 2 tables together and made sure we were comfortable.  Here are the highlights:Food:  Really juicy fried chicken.  It was a bit odd that only the drumstick pieces came with bones while everything else was boneless.  I would've preferred to have a choice of bone or boneless, but it wasn't a deal breaker.  The honey butter is a MUST!  If you're trying to watch your weight and skip the butter, then don't even order the chicken.  The honey butter takes the chicken to a whole other level of deliciousness!  As for sides, we basically ordered every side available.  Our favorite were the roasted sweet potato salad, mac n cheese, and the creamed corn.  The kids thought the biscuits were cute because they were shaped like little honey combs.  For kids, it was perfect. For adults, you're looking at consuming at least 2 of these biscuits.Service:  Not sure about the other reviews, but we received the most attentive service without it being overbearing.  Food and utensils were brought out very quickly.  We brought a cake for a birthday dinner and they not only served the cake with lit candles, but also took it to the back to cut it for us.  The best part, half of the staff stayed and sang happy birthday!Drinks:  Yes, there is a bar!  Nothing like ice cold craft beer to accompany the delicious food.  Kids ordered Green River soda.  Water was readily available by way of a self-serve station.Price:  Okay, don't expect KFC prices here.  They use high quality ingredients, locally sourced farm products, compostable utensils, etc, etc.  The main reason for their price point is because they provide their employees with insurance!!! I have no problem paying a bit more if it means that employers treat their workers with respect and offer them a sense of security.  Maybe this accounts for the great service - because the workers are treated well!Overall, there's no doubt we'd come back again.  A great addition to the neighborhood and one I hope stays around for a long time."
"Two words ""Honey Butter"" That is all you need to know plus this place is great! Love, Love, Love. The chicken and the sides are a home run! The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the crowded seating. Its a little tricky at times and if you are larger than a group of two during a busy time plan on sitting right on top of someone else. Other wise order extra cornbread!!!!! Enjoy"
"Fried chicken loveliness.    The chicken was incredibly moist, definitely double dipped and very well seasoned....then to put it over the top you slather honey butter and then hot sauce on top...OMG.  I also added the 3 sides and got the kale slaw, schmaltz mashed potatoes and thai creamed corn.   All were very good.   The stand out was definitely the mashed potatoes and gravy.   I thought the corn muffins were perfect.   I think I did backflips at the soda fountain - green river, Boylans and Goose Island at a soda fountain....I was jittery all night after having about 20 different refills"
"I love this place! The chicken is so tender and juicy, my mouth waters just thinking about it! The sides are great, love the pimento mac n' cheese and the smash potatoes. They are always friendly and even if it is busy the food comes out pretty fast."
"I heard great things, came in with high expectations and I was still blown away. The chicken in and of itself is the greatest thing ever, the spice and texture, and then you slather it with some honey butter, let it melt in, and you bite into that glistening wonderfulness and it's utterly orgasmic. The gumbo and sweet potato salad are good, but that mac n cheese with the house made hot sauce is to die for. Order the three sides option and make em all the mac n cheese. Excellent and unparalleled  selection of local craft beer. The cornbread could use a little work, it's not bad, I've had much worse. But yeah totally love the place."
"This place is WAY overrated. My friends & I drove past a few times & one day, we decided to finally try it. We waited about 45 minutes in the cold just to get to the register. NOT. WORTH. IT.First off, It's expensive: 2 pieces of boneless chicken, $8. (no sides or drink) By the time I got an order of Pimento Mac & Cheese, it came to about 12 bucks. I was disappointed by the mac & cheese. Essentially it was just nacho cheese covered in noodles. (BARF!) I expected the chicken to be buttery and maybe slightly sticky from the honey. In reality it was just bland fried chicken with a dollup of butter on top. What the hell?Way too expensive for chicken. It's a good idea in theory I guess, but it's really just another hipster restaurant. Think: ""White people's soul food.""I don't know why anyone in Chicago would go here; I'd rather go to Harold's or even Popeye's if I had a craving for chicken."
"OK so I have never been here. I will be honest. My boyfriend brought me home chicken from here. I probably ate it an hour after it was made, but it was still bang bang delicious.If it could be obscenely good cold, well then, that is some good fried chicken. Loved the namesake butter for coating the chicken. dirty good."
I have so many nice things to say about that fried chicken sandwich.
"Phenomenal! Incredibly tender, moist and flavor packed pieces of chicken. The honey butter is very unique and compliments the spices from the chicken very well. When paired, it's a great fusion of flavors in your mouth."
"Just have eaten here once, but will definitely be going back.  Fried chicken was very good--not what I would call ""southern-style,"" but really unique and tasty.  Very crispy skin, sprinkled with paprika, mix of bone-in and bone-less.  The honey butter is as good as it sounds and goes great with the little biscuits that accompany it.  The sides I ordered were really good--whipped sweet potatoes and mac n cheese.   Gets crowded fast, so go early if you don't want to wait.  It isn't super cheap, but hey, this isn't the $8 Jewel chicken dinner here--there's a lot of thought put into this menu and I would say it is worth checking out even if this isn't your 'hood."
"Sweet Baby Jesus! I am so glad this place took over La Finca. I remember my first visit....got out of the car and was immediately lifted and carried to the door by the amazing smell of spices and seasonings that the fried chicken emitted from the restaurant vents into the crisp (it was chilly that day) Avondale air. Got there around 7:30, walked right in, decided what to eat, and by 7:45 I was devouring the delicious foods that sat on my metal tray. Some of these people are complaining about the price. Must I remind you guys that you get what you pay for? The folks at ""Honey Butter Fried Chicken"" work hard to rebuild a succulent breast for you by filleting the meat, brining it, and reconstructing it back into a breast. You not only pay for their hard work, but you're getting (and I quote them), ""fresh, hormone- and antibiotic-free, locally sourced Amish chicken"". You hear that? Never frozen! Try going to KFC and getting that same chicken at their prices. They have Goose Island soda and GREEN RIVER (my favorite) flowing in their soda fountain. The iced tea is some of the best I've ever tasted. There's also a little convenient area next to the tea with bottles of Agave nectar and simple syrup. The day my friends and I went it was packed inside and we decided to eat outside. It was really cold and they had heating lamps, but they didn't seem to do the trick. That was ok though, we got our food fairly quick and downed it pretty fast (don't worry we still savored it!). About the biscuit. It was good, but that wasn't what was supposed to be the main highlight of the meal. The honey butter was so good!The best thing that I love about this place is that it caters to vegetarians too. My fiancé is vegetarian and I feel so bad for her when we go to meatatarian places. The three sides meal was just what she likes. Try the Apple Dump cake (I think that's the name) if it's on the menu. I sadly did not get some for myself. Wish I did!So, c'mon 3 star and bellow giving people, rethink your reviews! I'm sure you've paid way too much for crappy food at other restaurants. This place is the real deal and worth every penny."
"Some of the better fried chicken I've ever had- especially once I got over the odd sensation of spreading butter on top of fried chicken.  It was a bit weird at first, but it really works.  The corn muffins were also great, but the star here is the chicken.  Don't mess around with anything else, there's really no point.As some others have said, it is a bit expensive, but probably worth the price.  The seating arrangement works reasonably well, we came here at 6 PM on St. Patrick's Day Saturday and were able to find 2 seats pretty easily.  Probably not the best for a large group, however."
"This gets 5 stars for fried chicken and awesome sides and dump cake.  We loved all of the sides we had especially the grits!  My least favorite was the mac n cheese.  I can say that fried chicken has not been a part of my menu for maybe 15 years and even at that didn't have anything special.  I'm a ""foodie"" and love great food.  This is casual, great food.  Expect a line and wait for this great chicken.  Be sure you smother your chicken in the honey butter for the full effect of this great chicken.  Hey, it's already fried chicken how much more can honey butter add?  The PBJ dump cake was so awesome my daughter begged for more.  Thanks to the owner for bringing her more.  She's now your biggest fan.Looking forward to Sunday dinner concept.  loved the chicken and will be back for more."
"Went here last night with a friend. The decision was between here, a German place and a seafood place. After all the hype from Chicagoist and other places, we decided to try it. Lucky for me it was my b'day dinner so I didn't pay. Almost $60 for an 8 piece, 3 sides and 2 soft drinks? WTF? The place wasn't crowded so we were able to get a seat. (Side note to the parents seated next to us: discipline your little brat. The server shouldn't have to tell you that your lovely little son shouldn't climb on the ledge by the window. Don't give your son the option to climb down or face a timeout. He weighs 25 lbs. Pick his ass up and put him in his seat! And you understand that he's bored? Well, what made you think it would be a good idea to bring him there? If you MUST have the food, get it to go.) The food arrived fairly quickly, especially for fried chicken. But when that's really all you serve, I guess the wait shouldn't be that long. This whole no bones (deboned??) thing: weird, but acceptable. Call us quirky but in ordering an 8 piece we thought we would get 2 wings, 2 thighs, 2 legs and 2 breasts. There was 1 leg, no wings and I'm still not sure which was the thigh and which was the breast. We dig in. Me: is there a funny spice on this? My friend: yeah, what is that? Me: not sure. After doing some research today, I'm assuming it's the smoked paprika. Not to get all ""my mama makes better fried chicken"" (she does) but I know she uses paprika in her chicken coating. Does HBFC bathe the chicken in it? I'm no chef but I don't think one spice should overwhelm the taste of the chicken.As for the rest, I only tried the mashed potatoes. Good, but doesn't make up for the chicken. I resorted to the root beer when I saw the iced tea was pomegranate or some such thing. Seriously, can't a guy just get a regular iced tea? Sweet tea with fried chicken would be great but I will settle for just non-fruit-flavored. The root beer was good. My friend liked his cola. I would give an extra star for having non Coke/Pepsi soft drinks, but I'm still upset about the tea.We both had 2 pieces of chicken. Didn't even take the other 4 pieces with us. My friend who paid for dinner: ""Popeye's would have been better."" I agree."
"The Awesomes:Juicy, flavorful chickenCrispy, crunch, well-seasoned crustGood service; nice peopleNice decorTasty honey butter!Creative, Crunchy, sweet cream corn (for the side dish - topped with green curry!)Creative, tasty slaw (second side dish - kale with cumin and yogurt, sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.)Seating was easy to findNot so awesomes:tiny corn muffinssomewhat small side dishes for the pricelong line (it gets moving, but i think we waited 25 minutes to order)I'm just waiting for the day that the line for HBFC meets the line for Hot Doug's.Overall, I had a great experience here and left with a satisfied belly!"
"I love fried chicken.  My grandma made the best fried chicken.  This is not my grandma's fried chicken.  This one is very crispy, which means a lot of flour and a lot of crunch.  A little too much for me.  Not sure I get the honey butter angle.  Didn't do much for me.  But the Co-op hot sauce rose to the occasion.  Nice service.  Not sure about the location and space.  Good beer selection and recommended pilsners to pair with the fried chicken.  Definitely want to try to the fried chicken sammy."
"Unremarkable. Good but unremarkable. I enjoyed the chicken (not the sides), the line wasn't long, the staff was friendly and their cider apple cobbler was AMAZING. However, I have had better fried chicken elsewhere and nothing makes me want to go back here. So, unremarkable."
"This place is really great, the fried chicken is great and you have to get the honey butter sauce, their mac and cheese was great.  They also have fountain drinks made with sugar cane, which was yummy.  It's definitely a place to check out.  Be ready to wait in line but it moves pretty quickly and worth the wait."
My husband dragged me here with our toddler and baby in tow. Going to overhyped restaurants with kids is almost always a bad idea. But the staff were so sweet to us and the food was heavenly. Boneless fried chicken? Yes please!
"My husband and I have wanted to try this place for a few weeks and finally found the time tonight. We arrived a few minutes before 5 pm (it opens for dinner at 5) and there was a line of 8-10 people waiting for the doors to open. The friendly hostess opened the door promptly at 5:00  We were greeted by the host, Jordan who was welcoming and extremely pleasant as he explained the protocol involved in ordering our meal for dininig in. We ordered the fried chicken dinner that came with corn muffins and an ample dollop of sweet and creamy honey butter on the side. We also ordered 2 sides, the kale slaw and corn swimming in a creamy Thai flavored sauce. Both sides were unique and delicious. The chicken was crunchy and well seasoned on the outside and the meat was moist and flavorful. A very tasty and satisfying meal. We will definitely be back!"
"Descent food that is over priced. $50 for 8 chicken pieces, 2 sides of mac n cheese (smaller individual sized portions), 2 sides of mashed potatoes (smaller individual sized portion), and 5 silver dollar sized biscuits.  2 ladies and 2 guys finished everything except our biscuits, the largest dude is 165lbs.  The chicken is juicy and tender, but not superior to any fast food chicken restaurant, the honey butter you lather on the chicken adds a unique flair to traditional chicken.  Mac n cheese is a tender spiral noodle with descent flavor and mashed potatoes were soft and tasty."
Since I started eating a little more healthier I have tried to steer away from eating fried chicken. On my cheat days this is the place I go happily! Their chicken is to die for! I don't care much for their mac and cheese but I haven't ate any other sides but I sure will try them in the future. Just one time going here has me hooked! I will certainly be back for seconds! The whole crew is so friendly and there's a homely atmosphere feel when I walked in. I really wish they were open for more than just a few hours though. They'd probably even draw more business and less of a line. If I go there and the line is out the door; I wouldn't wait.
"Love this place!!! If you love chicken and friend chicken, their menu is amazing. Can get a little crowded at times, but worth the wait if there is one."
"this place is pretty deece, homie.  i give a 3.5.  it just didn't hold all the hype.  the name is genius, i have to say.  they could be serving an old shoe with a side of toilet seat, and i'd still come by just to give it a whirl.steph l. and i arrived just in time - everyone flocked in right after us.  i guess they just wanted to be where all the cool people were at :)  we walked up to the counter and ordered/split:2 piece chicken mealcornbreada pot piethe greensmac + cheesethe cookie2 iced teas.this all totaled to $40.  $20 a person (put away your calcs).  but everything was so small.  the sides were tiny.  like, that pot pie should have been twice its size.  i feel like i should have paid maybe $15.  maybe.  it feels like we didn't eat anything.  i mean you come to a place called honey butter fried chicken, and you expect to be rolled outta there.  not at all.  i should have left with diabetes.as for taste, the chicken was really flavorful.  the cornbread muffins were tiny but good.  i liked the pimento mac.  the pot pie didn't have a crust, since it wasn't baked in one (says captain obvi).  it was just bread crumbs on top.  the greens were deece, but we didn't finish them.  the cookie and the tea were standard.  i did LOVE the patio.  it's heated during these cool fall months.  beautiful.i'd come back.  i just hope they make their servings a bit larger.  remember, DIABETES IS KEY."
"Best fried chicken EVER and that was without the honey butter! It was super tasty and very crispy plain and orgasmic with the butter on it.  All the sides were delicious from the schmaltzy potatoes to the garlicky grits.  My friend and I both had a refreshing cocktail called the Hill Pop to wash it all down.  It quenched our thirst and I'm sure it will quench yours. Last, but not least, the staff was uber friendly.  There really is nothing bad I can say about this place.  There was a bit of a line, but it moved so quickly that we hardly noticed the wait."
"The chicken lives up to the hype. Maybe the best fried chicken I've ever had. I can't believe they remove the bones but I don't care. The flavors are on point. The Mac n cheese was pretty boring. Didn't taste any pimentos. I ordered a gin mule that was served so watered down I had to tell the waitress. She apologized profusely and brought me a proper one right away and comped it. Oh yeah, get the dumpling stew. It's crack"
"Really good. Really, really, really good."
"I liked the place. It is rather nicely remodeled inside, so you can eat right there, if you do not mind a very loud an annoying music. The sides are of a decent size, and are thoughtfully prepared. Green beens had dill on them. Corn bread was served with a lot of sweet butter on the side. Sides were delicious. Mccheese was nothing special, it has crumbs on the top, but it does not have a crust from baked in the oven, like Mcchees  at Smoque. Chicken does not have bone. So, it more like nuggets, except when you get a drumstick.  I do not care, but my hubby did not like that there are no bones. My hubby liked the sides, esp the cole slaw, or whatever they call it. Overall the place felt very yappy."
"My complaints are pretty much the same as everyone else's: WAY OVERPRICED. I wasn't shocked when my order was almost $40 for a 4 piece 2 sides, extra cornbread and two pops because the reviews on here prepared me for this. The chicken itself was nice and crispy and moist. The breading had a nice spice. Honestly though, both my wife and I preferred the chicken without the butter. $15 for 4 pieces of chicken though? Not worth it. We go the curry creamed corn and the pimento mac and cheese sides. The portions were really small for $3.50, but they were delicious. The curry in the corn is a nice touch.  I read on here that the corn bread was bite sized so we ordered the extra 5 pack. They really are bite sized, but they were pretty decent and these are what the honey butter is for. Overall, the food was actually pretty good, but just not worth the price for us to return. If the prices come down, we'd go back."
"A friend and I split the four pc chicken w/ two sides of Mac & cheese. The chicken was perfect...Crispy, juicy, & flavorful. It was good both with & without the honey butter. I loved their rum barrel hot sauce over the chicken. The corn bread & Mac & cheese was delicious. I used the chicken & corn bread to mop up the cheese sauce when it was all gone. It was very yum! I can't believe they are not open for lunch or past 9pm! They always have a line out the door."
"I have to write this review while this food is still fresh in my belly and currently going into my cat's belly.  I'm sorry, but YUCK! I This is coming from a black woman from the south whose family makes fried chicken every Sunday. I have never had a piece of fried chicken where I was not going back for more because of its delicious crust, but that was the case tonight. I couldn't even finish the chicken. There are 4 things you need for a good fried piece of chicken. 1. Crispy crust - Honey Butter has amazingly crispy crust2. Juicy - Honey Butter definitely has juicy chicken3. It has to be flavorful- Honey Butter is NOT AT ALL FLAVORFUL! That paprika on top was yuck or maybe it was another mixture of flavors they tried or lack thereof, but nasty! 4. A bone- OK, so you can take or leave a bone. I want my bone in my chicken. That's what keeps the juices flowing, but I must say the boneless breast was still juicy, I just prefer a bone. But that little nasty, dry/cold corn muffin on the side. YUCK! It was just dryness...nothing even crispy to pull off the top. I got there at 6, and received my food at 6:30. They had only opened at 5pm, so everything should have been hot. I did enjoy 2 things. Their special cream corn with green curry was pretty good. It was cold as well, but the corn was so crunchy and fresh and the curry was an interesting twist. I also like the honey butter. I liked that it was already semi-melted and ready to go. I just wish I'd had something else better to put it on. I live right in the neighborhood and have been waiting for this place to open for a while now. I wish I could give it a better review. The staff was really nice, but I just think that for the outrageous price for a a piece of nasty chicken, I won't be going back."
"Fried Chicken is the latest food fad to hit Chicago, and Honey Butter Fried Chicken is probably the hottest venue in town for the bird, whether you like the fowl, or think it's foul. Having waited for the hype and the lines to die down, I finally made my way today for the 5PM opening. There was a short line ahead of me, and before you know it, I was putting in my order. Even quicker, my food was on the table awaiting my assessment. I like to read reviews to see what other people think before I check a place out. I don't care what they think, but I like to get the general consensus and a feel for the place. When I see reviewers saying places like KFC or Popeye's are better, I immediately dismiss their reviews. If those are the places you frequent, I'm not interested in your opinion. Call me haughty if you like, but my taste goes beyond ordinary fast food establishments. If you listen to my advice about Honey Fried, you will be very happy when you visit. The fried chicken comes in two, four, and eight piece orders, along with corn muffins. The recommendation is to slather the butter on the chicken. Don't bother! If you have to put butter on the chicken for it to taste good, it's not worth ordering. Did you get that--it's not worth ordering. At $8, $15, and $28 for the above-mentioned portions, it's highway robbery. The chicken outside of the leg has no bones--therefore not that much taste. It's not bad, but it's not worth the ridiculously high tariff. Also, there is a ton of skin and a lot of waste with the four pieces. Skin and fat and no meat make Darrell an unhappy boy.Now for the good! The fried chicken sandwich is to die for! If Adam Richman did his ""Best Sandwich in America Show"" after Honey Fried opened, it would be a contender, or should I say favorite to take the crown. It's that good! In fact,, after one bite, I said to my girlfriend if it continues to taste this way, it's easily the best chicken sandwich I have ever had. Again, to go further, one of the best sandwiches I have had--ever!It comes on a buttery bun, topped with  crunchy slaw, along with a candied jalapeno mayo. The taste from that mayo should be outlawed!. It's like crack!We also had one side, the kale and cabbage slaw. It was interesting, with a weird crunch that I think came from the dried pomegranate. It's worth a try. As for the butter, it's really good. Not as good as the sandwich, which I am already fantasizing naughty things about, but it should be in the dairy case at your local supermarket. You will thank me, but Land O Lakes won't, because their sales will go down. One last thing--I loved the music. A lot of old Motown and other classics from the era. I don't know if that's the norm, but it made a good first impression for me. That is individual taste. This review isn't. Order the chicken sandwich and stay away from the chicken by the piece. You will thank me over-and-over, and you will save a lot of money. As for the restaurant, I want a cut of the money if you sell to the markets from my suggestion for the butter. It's only fair."
Nothing but good things about this place.  Food is great.  Prices are totally fair.   Nice space.  Good drink selection.  Friendly staff.     Also the food was surprisingly not greasy in a gross way.  Considering you put butter straight on the chicken this is a real accomplishment.  Must be something in the way they fry it that keeps it from feeling too heart attacky.
"Talk about overhyped. The way people have been slobbering over this place since long before it even opened would lead you to believe you'll be changing your religion after eating here. Yeah it's pretty good but the chicken has WAY too much paprika on it. And this is from someone who likes paprika and spicy food in general. BALANCE, people. Even the kid's meal food made my tongue tingle -- and I'm supposed to feed this to my little niece? And it's quite pricey too for the small portions you get. I don't mind small portions but I'd rather not pay big-portion prices for them. Which brings up a related point: they need to ditch that stupid little two-bite, pre-fab corn muffin that they don't even bother to re-heat. It's obvious the point is to list ""corn muffin"" as an included item to increase the perception of value. The net result isn't merely worthless -- it's an insult.In short, good but not transformative like the legions of fanbois/girls would have you believe. On balance I like this place and it's a fine addition to the neighborhood. And yes, I will be back -- just not very often."
"I'm between 3 & 4 stars for honey butter fried chicken. The decor is nice, and luckily I came at a time when it wasn't very crowded.The corn muffin tasted good but there was far too little of it. The fried chicken was moist and the coating was crisp. I was pleasantly surprised how good the honey butter was on the chicken.... And the special hot sauce.The pimento Mac and cheese was delicious.Over all nice experience, a bit pricey, worth going if you're in the area"
Wow!  Great food great service.  I live in the Southside and will definitely be coming back as often as possible!
"OVERRATED!!!!!! 4 pieces for 15 dollars. That comes out to 4 dollars a piece. The chicken itself was okay. Not horrible but not great either.  I also had three different sides . Creamed corn with curry, Goat cheese Grits w/ Chinese Broccoli, and a green bean salad.  I was impressed with the sides, but the chicken fell short of expectations. The space itself is nice with a spacious patio and a bar in the back.  I prefer parsons personally but to each his own."
My only complaint is that this restaurant isn't any closer. I LOVE fried chicken and this had to be the best I've ever had.  We got take out and I can't tell you how hard it was to stop eating and save some for lunch the next day.
"was fun to check out this new restaurant but between the price and the chicken being just OK, i was not as impressed as i wanted to be.  when i think of corn muffins, especially at a place called honey butter, i think of large, tasty corn muffins, these are super tiny and well done.the gumbo was excellent.too pricey for what they offer, even a glass of wine was expensive.may try it again if we are in the mood, but won't be on our top list"
"place is good got carry out. chicken was nice and moist and a bit of kick to the thick breading, mac and cheese and grits were excellent. we'll be back"
"Not what I expected at all. Will not be coming back. Just not good things going for this place. Food is expensive, chicken bland without butter on it, sides few to choose from and not good, and soda selection was very odd. Sorry really wanted to like this place but just not enthused at all."
"Had been waiting for months to try this place.  We were out of town when they did the pop up dinners at Half Acre a few months ago, so they couldn't open soon enough.  Chicago needed a great fried chicken place, and this is it.  They'd get 5 stars if their sides were a little more traditional.  I know it's not what they are trying to be, but I can't help feeling incomplete without fries or mashed potatoes.   I know they'd do them well if they had them.  The corn muffins are amazing, just need to be a little bigger.  I would say the chicken sandwich is the way to go.  It's got some heat, and is topped with slaw (I could use a little more slaw on mine, maybe I'll ask for extra next time).  It's not Bakesale Betty's, but it's very close.  We went 3 times in the first 10 days.  Keep it up HBFC."
"Great fried chicken (obvi) and fun cocktails. The sides are just OK (no Smoque sides, in my opinion.) Easy street parking."
"The guy at the register was very sweet and patient with me, while I asked (dumb?) questions. I was allowed to choose which pieces of meat I wanted for my two different orders and that kind of service is greatly appreciated AND is what makes people come back! :) Thanks! I LOVED the side options. I tried the kale salad and the pimento mac and cheese and both were awesome. My opinions on the biscuits are similar to other posters. They are certainly bite sized, but I did like them more than the typical bright-yellow muffins you would expect. As for the chicken, it was great, but I felt like a sloth buttering it!!! Portion sizes aren't huge, which is not a bad thing, but for the price...hmm."
"OMG. My mouth waters thinking about this chicken!! Sure, the line goes outside so you might have to wait in the cold for a few minutes.... But it's worth it!!"
"It was a good thing it was so loud in there that it became difficult to talk on date night because once our food arrived and we started eating, we were speechless. This is good stuff. I ordered a two piece, all white meat, and then the choice if three sides because I had heard they were amazing. They were. The three I picked were the special mashed potatoes with a rosemary gravy, the roasted autumnal vegetables with agrodolce, and the kale and cabbage cole slaw with dried pomegranate.My husband ordered a four piece and a side of sweet potato salad. He got two legs and two breasts.The plates come out with corm muffins which are cute, they have customized bee hives on the bottom. Mine were dry and kind of old tasting, but my husband's looked like they were from a different batch. We also received the namesake honeybutter which we were instructed to spread on to the fried chicken. I mean, butter on fried chicken? Yep, delicious. We ordered way too much food but wanted to try it all. We decided next time we will order a four piece with the kale slaw and the mashed potatoes if they have them again, tho that was his pick, I preferred the sweet potato salad myself.They also have a great beer selection, mixed drinks, a soda machine with Boylan's on tap and iced tea. We will most definitely be back. It's craveable. I wish I could have it for breakfast.How lucky are the people on that block of Roscoe...Honey Butter Fried Chicken at one end of the street and Hot Doug's at the other. Real Estate mark up right there!"
"I finally made it over the this very hyped restaurant on an otherwise unsuccessful corner of Roscoe.  At 6:00p on a Wednesday, there were only two people in front of me for carry out and a few spots open at the back bar.  It was the perfect level of busyness to give energy but not an unnecessarily long wait.  All the staff seemed very friendly and provided a top-notch, unrushed, guest experience.It took only minutes for my delicious chicken to arrive. Honey Butter sauce exceeded expectations!  The ""cornbread muffin"" should not even be considered as part of the menu.  This Silver Dollar-sized piece of food leaves much to be desired, especially at the price point a meal runs (see below for more on that).  I opted to get the kale cole slaw which tasted delicious and had a great consistency.  Disappointment:  As a carry out customer, the restaurant needs to provide flatware and napkins with every order.  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to ask for it...?  Taking my food elsewhere I was peeved to learn nothing, even napkins, were in my box.  If you don't want to give it to every order, you should at least pose the option to patrons. Here's the con: The prices are greatly exaggerated for the quality of food and atmosphere.  This isn't a More cupcake or Hot Doug's sausage.  Those companies provide a differentiating factor that allows them to charge a premium for a commodity.  But HBFC needs either more of a factor, or a lower price point.  Then again, the place is open less than 25 hours a week....I suppose the rent has to be paid somehow.... :-/  $3.50 + for a small side?? C'mon guys!!  Thank God they take credit cards! Haha!Working in the area, it is time for this place to accept phone orders.  Or work with one of the apps in existence to allow for some type of online ordering.  I know the owners said this was coming soon but let's speed up the process!  I always want to check out their back deck when next summer rolls around.Overall: Head her for delicious, overpriced food served promptly by a friendly staff.  I'll be returning again but my expectations will be realigned."
"This is straight up some of the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life. Talking to one of the guys who works there, it's de-boned in the morning, and then double/triple(?) battered/fried with a dousing of smoked paprika in between each drop into the oil. If you're expecting just plain fried chicken without spices this may not be your favorite, but if you have a wider pallet this is going to blow your socks off. Also, no idea how they keep it that juicy without bones, it's a chicken miracle. True, it is somewhat pricey but I over ordered going with the 4 piece and I have a pretty good appetite. The sides we were also excellent, my favorite was the green curry creamed corn while my girlfriend sided with the kale coleslaw and mac and cheese. Not to gush about everything (and my girlfriend will definitely argue with me about this), the only thing I saw a little room for improvement would be the cornbread. It was amazing slathered with the namesake honey butter, but a little light without it. However, this might just be because everything else was so damn rich that not every dish could keep up. We'll be back, that's for dang sure."
