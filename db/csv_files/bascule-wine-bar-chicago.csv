Bascule Wine Bar
"Went there for a late night drink, the bartender was awesome. Made a great cocktail, perfect for my taste. Friendly locals around, nice to chat with them. I would definitely go there again."
"I'm not much into wine, but Bascule is a great spot for a ladies evening of fun and food. There are cocktail options which I tried out. The name escapes me, but it was delicious. The servers are knowledgeable and super helpful when looking for drink recommendations. The food is wonderful here. My friends and I started with the sausage and mushroom flatbread. The ingredients are fresh and the crust is nice and crispy. For my entree I got the fish and chips with homemade tartar sauce. I love that sauce! Unlike most tartar sauces, this one has a touch of dill, a pleasant surprise. Don't forget the dessert. The brownie is divine!"
"This is a new gem in Little Italy!  You really should try especially if you are tired of all the old establishments around there.They have selected wine and beers on tap, and a pretty extensive list.  But the food and atmosphere is what won us over.  The daily special flat bread, tuna/hamachi(?) tartare, burger, scallops were all amazing!  The service is warm and easy going. And we particularly like the seats near the open glass doors near the street.  We have been there twice in the last month and would be game to go again!"
"I thought this place was very well established over the last year.  Even since Urban Union closed out with very unpleasant fashion (on themselves), this place has been empty up until I graduated.  Then the minute I took off to the East coast these two somms opened this wine bar.  Luckily I had time to come back to the Windy city a couple of time so was able to try this place.  My bottom line is that this is a perfect local joint to chill out after work with small dishes and a glass of wine.  This place also set the concept as small dish, farm to table with wine kinda thing.  We went here first time for my wife's graduation with in laws and a couple of other guests.  We ordered about 5 dishes.  I thought bone marrow was a bit too much fatty (well I guess I would not be one that enjoys bone marrow), but other dishes were great.  Rabbit dish was great, and flatbread with seasonal ingredient was great.  We went back the second time in about a month, and had similar selections (sans bm), and we were very satisfied.  Staff were very nice.  The restaurant was on a slower side (went there about 10pm on a week day both times), but still was vibrant enough to sit by the window, enjoy the food while watching Taylor street with people walking around.  I hope this place, along with other new places, becomes the ignition of revival of little italy."
"I came here as a belated birthday dinner with two friends. We all ordered a glass of wine.The wine was a nice size pour (although I wish the draft wine was chilled), maine mussels (good flavor, preferred this dish over the manila clams), manila clams (broth was a bit salty), burger (very sweet burger. I don't know if that was the intention), olive oil cake (decent), peach cobbler (very sweet). We asked for a lot of bread to mop up the clam juices. Service was solid. Overall, I liked my experience. If I lived in the area, I would probably make this my neighborhood spot since the prices and ambiance is decent. Good spot for a low-key dinner."
Not just about the wine- the cocktails are really good and creative. It's a wine bar but offers great cocktails and beer for non wine drinkers. Definitely recommend for date night.
"They don't currently have any flights on the menu (last time I came they did), however, our server offered to make us a custom flight based on our tastes in wine. We told her we prefer whites, a little sweet like Rieslings, also clean and crisp like Sauvignon Blancs. And she was spot on! She selected 3 wines that were perfect for us. As for food, the crostini with ricotta, lavender honey, and candied pistachios was the perfect palate cleanser. This place is right in my neighborhood, so I'll definitely be back!"
"I don't know what the fuss about Bascule is all about.  It's a cute spot. They were super nice, helpful and present and not intrusive or annoying. Three of us spent a long evening here, and it was all good. A few observations:The cheese and charcuterie were a near miss. All good, but totally bland and uninteresting for $25. Beginner charcuterie perhaps. The tuna entree is not an entree. It is an appetizer. 5 bite sized pieces of tuna, no matter how artfully arranged, is too little to be considered an entree. Lamb Shank:  with a squirt of purée something and one piece of veg:  again... measl or an ala carte food picks? I want to be fed for $29, not teased. Drinks are a strong point. Wine, beer and cocktails. Competent and friendly bar staff. I don't need to go again, but wouldn't complain if I was invited. I just wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Bascule. Nice but not that nice."
"Came here on a Friday after work for a girls' wine night.  It started off great: love that you can make reservations and the space is very cute!  Dimly lit and intimate, it's right on trend.From there, things went downhill.  Our server was kind of spacey, despite a rezo for 3, she brought out one glass of water, waiting til each person arrived to get some water.  She asked if we wanted to hear the specials before the third person arrived (umm, no, you'll just have to tell her them again in 2 minutes) and she only brought two menus for three people.  She gave some good recommendations, so that was nice, but overall I felt rushed, like she was trying to turn over the table.We loved the wines, the selection is great, and the gentleman at the door doubled as sommelier and made suggestions when we couldn't choose.  The cremant rose sparkler was very crisp, my friend enjoyed her French white wine flight and we all LOVED his suggestion for a dessert rose: Schlossmuhlenhof (I took a picture of the label, it was so good!)The food was a different story.  We ordered the beet salad (which was more like a goat cheese plate with 6 pieces of diced beets scattered around the edge of the plate), the truffled cavateppi (which was tasty, but had a strangely burnt tasting cheese cracker on top) and the scallops (the lemonade foam intrigued me, but it didn't taste like anything and the scallops were fine, but certainly not the best I've had).  They ended by giving us a parting gift: bags of bacon fat popcorn, but again, only gave us two for three people... It's like my friend wasn't even there!Overall, it's cute but I don't know that I'd make another trip to Little Italy just for Bascule.  We went a couple years ago when it was Urban Union and that was excellent, I wish it could have stayed the same."
"I made the bonehead move of going out to dinner with my wife and forgetting my wallet.  We live north of Wrigley and drove 25 minutes to get to Bascule so going home would've been a bummer.  I spoke to the manager Jason who totally rocked.  He allowed us to have dinner and drinks with a handshake agreement that I call him today with my credit card info, which I'm going to do as soon as I finish this review.  The food and drink rocked as well.  We had scallops, barley salad, flatbread, salmon, tuna and halibut tartar and it was all great.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was super informative and actually came up with the drink program.Nice ambience, nice tunes and super staff.Thank you all for trusting that we would call today and actually pay and trust me again when I say we will definitely be back.....with my wallet this time.."
"I had never been to its predecessor so could not speak to how similar the decor is but I really like the ambiance.  It is exactly what you expect a wine bar to be: smaller tables, open kitchen, casual atmosphere.  The front space is more of the casual bar and visual kitchen, which I love.  It is set up sort of similar to Au Cheval in that respect with the tables on the right and small bar and kitchen on the left.  There is a dividing area that has a fence where patrons can add locks (think Paris) and faux bricks with graffiti on them.  It's very original.  Then the back is set up more restaurant-like with smaller tables and a private dining area that overlooks both the front area and the back area.  It is larger on the inside than it looks from the outside.  I started with one of their cocktails.  I can't remember the name but it had grape soda (house made, of course) and jalapeno.  Grape sode and jalapeno?  Yes, and it was awesome.  Very balanced.  I had to then have a red and a white (of course).  Both of them were very good.  I had a Carignan blanc, which I didn't even know existed.  It was yummy.  Then I had a Chinon.  Another grape I wasn't familiar with.  This was outstanding.  For food we only tried the bone marrow but I am quite excited to try some of the other dishes.  I plan to frequent here often!"
"Stopped in last night for a few drinks and ending up staying and ordering food. The ambience is really great and intimate. They have wine on tap which is a pretty cool concept that I haven't seen too many other places. They also have great mixed drinks including a great jalapeño drink (so I'll definitely be coming back). We ordered the duck duck goose, flatbread and cavatappi and they were all delicious. I definitely wanna come back and try out the mussels, clams and scallops because they all looked great!Update: I did come back for the scallops, short-ribs and the shrimp. The short ribs literally melted in your mouth and were delicious! The portions are a little smaller so I would recommend ordering a few different dishes and splitting them all. The scallops were cooked great, but as a stand alone meal were not filling."
"I checked out Bascule last night during their pre-liquor license days, so it was BYO. They did a nice job with the old Urban Union spot--not a massive overhaul, but they added decorations and little touches that make the place feel warm and personal.  I like the bridge theme and, not being too knowledgable about bridges, learned that bascule is a type of bridge that's counter weighted. My favorite feature is a huge  backlit print of a view of the Chicago skyline from the 18th St. bridge with--you guessed it--a bascule bridge in the foreground. Our party of 4 ordered the mussels, bone marrow, chicken, seared yellowfin tuna, seared scallops, truffle cavatelli, and short rib dishes to share.  Prices may seem a little high, but I think the dishes are generously portioned so I felt they were reasonable. I'm pescatarian so I can't comment on the meat dishes, but I will say that the others really enjoyed them all. In particular, they were impressed with the chicken because it's the thigh, leg and breast all attached and cooked together, and both meat types were cooked perfectly. That's impressive!  The scallops and tuna were cooked perfectly also, and I thought their accompaniments complemented the fish well.  The mussels were a huge dish and tender. And small--I like that, because I don't care for massive shellfish. They definitely buy quality ingredients here.  The truffle cavatelli with cheddar crisp was their take on mac and cheese and was done very well.  The truffle oil made it decadent, but the sauce was actually pretty light in texture--this is not an ooey gooey dish. Very tasty. I do wish they would've had some more substantial, creative vegetarian dishes, but the menu is quite meat-heavy (as many seem to be these days).  I also wish they would make some of their dishes (scallops, tuna) a little less salty, but that is certainly not a complaint that's unique to them--I find that restaurant food in Chicago is often on the salty side for me, relative to food I get in other cities and countries. Guess we just like our food aggressively seasoned here. The service was very friendly, though for full disclosure I should mention that we were there with a friend who is friends with the owners. But their stated mission is to make Bascule a warm, approachable, friendly wine bar with no pretension.  I have confidence that they'll accomplish that. Though they couldn't sell any wine that night, I looked at their wine list and it is indeed very accessible--it's filled with reasonably priced bottles and interesting selections. I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of them (as well as dessert, which sounded excellent).  They'll also have 6 wines on tap.So this was a great first visit, and I highly recommend trying them out. They should have their liquor license by this coming weekend, so stop in and try them out!"
"Walked into this quaint place a Saturday evening after a Bulls game with my girlfriends. We had never heard of the place but were warmly welcomed the moment we stepped inside. The ambience was spot on--low lighting, good music playing, the guests were chattering softly.The service was just superb-- The waiter was awesome at recommending dishes and explaining thr menu.We tried oysters, the bone marrow, the lamb meatballs, and something else I can't remember. The marrow and meatballs were my ultimate favorites. I really wanted to stay and taste my way through the entire menu. Guess that'll be saved for Round 2."
"Amazing even if we only went for drinks. Our server was super nice and knowledgeable. The drink list is very unique using creative ingredients - jalapeno soda anyone? We really enjoyed our cocktails even though I can't remember the names but try the one with chocolate and another with jalapeno soda.The wine list is quite large for the size of the restaurant so that is impressive.My only complaint is the music. For such a charming and unique and somewhat exotic business, the music was cheesy. They were playing something similar to Squeeze. Bleh! How about something more exotic or classy?Can't wait to go back or dinner."
Another amazing meal. Start to finish. Seems like the kitchen is getting better. Skirt steak was a surprise in look and flavor. Smelt was like 11 out of 10. Great fresh flavor and sauces worked wonderfully. Wife had tuna and it look so good. This time I have zero reservations...not like I did before but second time is a true test to their abilities. Keep wowing me please!!
"The bartender, Ian, was great.  The wine selections are good.  Ian will provide excellent recommendations if are not wine person."
"Went to Bascule to celebrate my birthday with some friends. We had an amazing experience. The place was casual and cool with an upscale vibe.  Great spot for a night out with friends or a dressy date night! The wine list was extensive and well planned and the  speciality cocktails were outstanding, especially the jalapeño one. I think one of the best parts of the menu was that the portion sizes are small which allow you to try a few different things or get some things to share with your friends and even had room for dessert.  I would recommend the flan or if you want something totally unique, the Maple Pot de Creme was outstanding! (Who can resist candied bacon?)Would definitely recommend you give it a try!"
"My husband and I went to check this place out on one of the coldest nights of the winter, and to our surprise they still had a decent size crowd.  Great wine and cocktail list, although on the pricey side (especially for that area).  The atmosphere was cute and intimate so we'd go back to explore the food menu."
"Very cute and nice atmosphere.  Good tunes etc. The guy bringing the wine was excellent.  He knew his stuff, encouraged you to try-before-you-buy, friendly, and most importantly a generous pour.That's about it.  I always joke that I'm Mr. Cellophane but they took it to heart here.  I didn't get my own menu, and to top it off at the end when they bring you a little bag of popcorn...she only brought 2 for our table of 3.  Since it was bacon fat corn I didn't make a fuss but wow.  If you're a celebrity come here to feel invisible.The food was disappointing.  We ordered the beet salad which should be renamed onion salad because there were 4 little beet wedges.  For once there was more cheese than veg!  I found myself asking, ""Where's the beets?!""  We also tried the scallops which was well made.  There were 3 - 1 scallop for each of us.  And the cheese pasta which was fancy mac 'n cheese.  Its called truffle cavatappi, and you can taste the truffle, but the cheddar cracklin was not good.  It made me pucker from the super sharp, burnt taste.  But it clearly wasn't burnt.I wish, as a wine bar, there were more snack options.  Most of the items have meat on them, or are meat, and they do only 1 flat bread?  If I'm drinking wine and chatting then I want something that you can eat with your hands that's not heavy.  Like bread.  Or even nuts or olives.  The standards."
"We should have been warmed when we walked in and the place was completely empty when it should have been dinner rush.  We ordered a bottle of white wine that came out warmer than room temperature, surprising for a wine bar, but quickly fixed with a bucket of ice.  Our food was the worst I have ever paid over $100 for.  I was seriously a little depressed after leaving.  I would not normally send food back but if it wasn't a birthday celebrations for my best friend I would have in this case.  The bread had enough garlic to taste like gasoline.   The mussels were nothing more than bitter, uneatable.  The fries were good but the $20+ tuna plate was simply seared tuna and chic peas, no flavor.  Huge disappointment.  To top it off our server would not give us more than 90 seconds to talk without interrupting.  Seriously, she stopped by when the food was dropped (good), when we where half  way done, and when the plate was completely empty she still felt the need to ask if she could clear it.  This along with many other unnecessary interruptions were ridiculous  to the point that we were laughing about it during dinner.  The best was, ""I have finished pouring your wine sir,"" as she waved her hand across the empty bottle."
"Great place; very genuine. The location has great hospitality. The bar tender was welcoming and the owner took the time to greet us and give us a tour. A great place to relax and have a drink, especially after a long day at work. FYI- they have a great Menu and brunch on Sunday."
Nice little gem with wine on tap.
The service was spot on. The octopus was great of the bat and I just added some like to take it to the next level. Great wine selection of Spanish wines. Great atmosphere with Spanish and Latin music. Will definitely come back.
Great place to go. Has the mussels and short ribs. Everything was perfect. Definitely a must go to place.Simply this is how it should be. Looking forward to returning on my next trip to Chicago.
Had a great meal here. Charles took care of us. Awesome guy. Great food. Wine lover place but not snobby. Every employee has a very approachable and fun attitude towards wine. Killer. Love this place. Food I tried was a great addition to the wine. Get european for a moment. Check this place out and open your mind. Quit the non-stop looking for that perfect meal and just start enjoying food and wine together as one. Learn something. Make some friends. Have a laugh.
"I got the privilege of a pre-opening tryout for this place and it is going to rock the restaurant scene in Chicago!Very warm and friendly surroundings. You have many choices of seats from the bar to a community table but we were lucky to have our large party in a private area but not so private that we were isolated from the rest of the restaurant.Wont comment on any drink-related since they are still working on their liquor license. However, nobody scoffed at helping us with our wine selections and servicing our drinks.There were a few standouts on the menu. The bone marrow canoe was my favorite. Rustic serving with upscale tastes. Also, you may be tempted by mussels which are good but go for the clams. They were cooked perfectly and the sauce is very flavorful. The one dish I missed was they were out of their poached pear for dessert. Next time.Very excited to go back as they were still in opening mode and I can imagine that their operation is running very smoothly now."
"With so many incredible places to eat and imbibe in Chicago it's difficult to find establishments that elevate above others, and Bascule accomplishes that in spades.  The restaurant features a wonderful wine selection that's been thoughtfully curated by both sommelier owners who are incredibly helpful when it comes to suggested pairings with their beautifully crafted and delicious small plates.  Everything that we ordered was fantastic, but the real sleeper on the menu was their cheeseburger with bacon mayo and tomato jam - it was unbelievably good.  Check this place out!"
"Excellent. Just excellent. First time dining here I brought my family from out of town and we were all blown away. The service was incredible, wine was devine (see what I did there?), and the food was 5-stars. The oysters and lamb meatballs were my favorites. We did a few small plates so I got to try almost everything on the menu, and I was not disappointed with one thing. I will be back!"
"The food was excellent.  Our favorites were the harvest salad, bone marrow and boar shoulder.  Very unique tastes.  We also had the mussels which was a much bigger dish than expected; they were a bit overdone although the soup was good.  Duck duck goose was good for the ingredients it had; I just think I'm not a big fan of foie gras and duck egg.The main reason for the 4 and not 5 stars is the slow service.  We were there early on a Friday evening and the first ones there.  There were 2 servers available; for some reason it took almost 45 min for our second course to arrive.  We wanted to have a leisurely dinner but not one that took over 2 hrs!Overall, however, it is a very good restaurant."
"You'll feel like family as soon as you walk in the door. Cozy, friendly atmosphere with excellent food at modest prices, but the real highlight is the wine selection. Nothing pretentious. We were pleased with both the cask wines by the glass and the value priced bottles."
"Fantastic experience. Knowledgeable staff, friendly people, delicious wine, and wonderful food. Will definitely go again."
"Easy to find paid street parking and energetic ambience. Greeted upon entering by host and waitress (we had reservations) on a Friday night in the early evening. The host who greeted me initially when I first arrived was very courteous and even allowed me to charge my phone since my car charger was dead. Nice! He was really such a great gentleman, plus he had suggested an amazing sweet white wine from Germany as our dessert. For the meals, we ordered a beer and goat cheese salad, truffle pasta and scallops, all of which were phenomenal - fresh, well presented, quick to arrive, and beautifully placed on the plates; great presentation. Altogether, not bad for the price between 3 people and all the drinks and food put together (ended up totaling $40 approximately per person). It looks like a great date night or girls night with excellent wine selections, even if you're not sure what to order - they can make a great suggestion for you. I didn't try their wine cocktails but I'm sure that they are excellent. I would go back for the food and to try the wine cocktails. Lighting is dim towards back of restaurant but otherwise plenty of light in front and lower towards other seating, which would make it perfect for a date. Great service and food overall."
"I love this place. I went there once for drinks at the bar. The bartenders were really friendly and helpful. Their cocktails are also different and interesting.I went there another time for drinks and appetizers at the bar. I got the brussel sprouts and something else that comes on slices of bread (kind of like bruschetta, but rather than tomatoes, it was greens and I think goat cheese). Both were really good. I wouldn't say it's very unique, but it was still tasty.In general, it has a nice atmosphere - casual but can be more ""formal"" for dates. It's one of the few places I actually like sitting at the bar."
"Excellent wines and cocktails. Great food. Handsome, knowledgeable and friendly staff. What's not to like?"
"We had been really building up our visit to this restaurant... Ever since the rumors began swirling over the summer that two accomplished sommeliers were opening a new wine bar we were looking forward to visiting. When we finally saw that they got their liquor license we came straight in. Our waitress was honestly the biggest frustration. I hate to say that because I know that it's a very tough job and especially at a wine bar where servers are expected to really know the list, but she was really very uninformed. Given what we knew about the guys opening the restaurant we assumed they would have at least trained their servers on the opening wine list a little bit. She truly couldn't answer any of our questions. I had pretty specific criteria: we wanted full-bodied, heavy on the tannins, spicy, and not from France (we're on pause with French wines as we just got back from drinking our way through Paris). She was clearly just spouting random ""buzz words"" and not pointing out anything that fit our criteria.That being said, we lucked out because they actually were out of the wine we went with after all this, so one of the partners came over and walked us through a new decision. We did really appreciate this, and the wine he guided us to was great. If it had just been the waitress I would have stuck cleanly with a 4 because I loved the charcuterie plate, the ambience, and the wine we ended up ordering. Unfortunately our main dishes were not spectacular. We ordered the short rib and the truffle cavatappi and they were just not that good. They weren't bad but they weren't good and I didn't feel that they came close to doing as well as the charcuterie and the wine.Overall I love the concept of this place and I really hope to give it a second chance soon."
"W.O.W. What more can I say? Wine, cocktails, food and service were all excellent. We had a great night and tried charcuterie, burgers, chicken, duck duck goose, blt3, and cavatappi - all phenomenal. Just get here. And soon. You will be happy you did, and be back for more.UPDATEWe have since been back and also tried the short ribs and deserts. More WOW from these selections too."
"This place is wonderful! I went on a Friday night with a few friends and it was the perfect low-key dinner spot. We asked about wine flights and while they don't have them on the menu, they offered to make us a few based off of their recommendations and each of the wines was great! They have a large selection of unique wines and are able to knowledgeably recommend ones you may like. In addition to the wine, all of our food was delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant for a fun night out out or date night."
"It's wonderful to have a wine bar like this on Taylor Street. My husband and I had our date nite dinner here last nite. Loved the decor. To drink we had Tablas Creek GSM on tap, very delicious, although we are partial to that wine. Linda was a great server and Jason paired my scallops with a great glass of white wine (sorry I can't remember the name). We ordered the following for dinner: 1. brussel sprouts & squash (initially as a side, but my husband ended up having that for his entree) So yummy! The vegetables were evenly done and not overcooked.  2. roasted bone marrow - so rich and delicious! Big portion of marrow, (Needed more bread)3. truffle cavatappi - sauce very delicious, lots of sauce left over (Asked for bread to sop up sauce)4. seared maine scallops - favorite dish of the nite, scallops were seared wonderfully, sea urchin butter! Delicious! 5. Risotto - (my husbands initial entree) not so great, lacked in flavor and temperature wasn't even - some parts of the dish on the plate was lukewarm and some was hot? Jason was accommodating and offered another dish and took the risotto off the bill, which was very nice. 6. Dessert - I asked Jason for recommendation, and we got this tasty sweetened elephant ear pastry with icecream and pistachios. I'm not a big cocktail person, but I had the green grape jalepeno high ball with dessert. It was so good, id order it again on its own. Having it with the dessert was just darn yummy! We really enjoyed this place and look forward to trying other wines and dishes. My two complaints are 1. we were charged extra for bread, maybe we are just used to getting free bread from the other restaurants in the neighborhood and if a dish is delicious, I like cleaning my plate with bread 2. If you're in the mood for pasta or risotto, I'd get it at an Italian restaurant down the street and come back here for drinks."
This is a nice place but service was pretty ordinary and food the same. I had scallops. 3 on a plate. Didn't think that they tasted that fresh. Waited ages for drinks.
