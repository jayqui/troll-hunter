The Gage
"Came here on both trips I've made to Chicago -- great experiences both times.  Ambiance is perfect to drop in late night or for day drinking.  Service has been superb everytime I've come.  Their servers are super knowledgeable about the food but also very attentive and on top of things.Mom loved the mussels and their cocktails are perfectly balanced and fresh.  Also tried their beer-battered pickles, really crispy and and the perfect balance of salty goodness -- really big portion for 2 though.  I've never actually been here for a full meal but everything looks amazing."
"WATCH YOUR BILL!On my most recent trip to The Gage, I was alone for lunch and I sat at the bar.I used a debit card to leave a $8.11 tip on a $40.89 bill. (I like to leave tips that bring my bill to an even dollar amount for easier record keeping). However, when my card was ultimately run, my tip was changed to $12.I tried to convince myself that the error was mine, but I couldn't do it. I'd written down my tally while still seated at the bar at The Gage, and I know that my restaurant bills almost always end on an even dollar.A few days later, I called The Gage and spoke to a manager. He pulled my ticket and told me that it did in fact appear that a ""clerical error"" had been made. After questioning friends who run a restaurant about whether or not this would be an easy error to make, the consensus was that whomever ran my ticket had likely given themselves a bigger tip on purpose as $8.11 is nowhere close to $12. Had The Gage indicated at all that the wait staff would be reprimanded, I wouldn't be writing this review. However, I was not satisfied with management defending their staff and chalking  this one up to a ""clerical error.""Had I used a charge card as opposed to a debit card, I would have never noticed.The food at The Gage is superb which is why they're still getting 2 stars after my last visit."
"We came here for my mom's birthday one year and we were not disappointed.  The reservations were easy to make or 5:30 p.m. on a weekday but the weekends are probably worse.  We were seated right away, even missing a member of our party, which is always appreciated.  The menu is large and includes a lot of ""American Classics"" that are delicious.  My one friend swears by the poutine and you can order it for pick up and it's still good.  The cocktail menu is appealing, there's a full bar, and a decent beer list.  Alcohol prices are a bit high but I guess that's to be expected in the Loop.I don't often find myself in this part of town, but The Gage is a good stop for tasty food that is decently priced for this area.  Gets busy during the summer and in evenings, so beware when planning your visit."
"Visiting Chicago from Indianapolis with my wife, this place was recommended to me from a coworker.  We just stopped in to check it out, have a few drinks, and try some food.Walking in through the rotating door, this place looks nice.  We found a spot at the bar, and ordered a few drinks to get started.  Knowing we had more places we wanted to see, we just ordered an appetizer to share.  The pork poutine.  Slow braised pork shoulder, pork broth, a mire poiux, fries and cheese curds.  It was really good, next time we're in town we might try some entrées!"
"I appreciate a thoughtful menu with generous and relevant details. If you have organic, grass-fed meats, THAT, dear restaurateur, is something that is well worth boasting about on your menu. Tell me about it! Don't make me raise an eyebrow at your servers in disbelief. Bottom line, I don't mind spending more on quality grass-fed, humanely raised meats and organic foods but I'm not convinced that this is the place to do so.At The Gage, I didn't find much boasting over quality ingredients but I did find some savvy marketing on the menu. A roasted ""Amish"" chicken that has nothing to do with Amish or organic or even free-range farming? *eyebrow up* Thanks but no thanks. Grass-fed meats (according to our server although it was not written on the menu) from the butcher board? Sure...*eyebrow up* I'll take your word for it. I'm hungry and I have a train to catch.Service was excellent. After asking so many questions about menu items, I had the nerve to ask our friendly server if it would take long. What a good sport. Our meals came out reasonably quickly and our server was both attentive and knowlegable. Easy 5 stars for service.The food, however, wasn't as impressive as the service. There wasn't anything spectacular about the asparagus with poached egg. It's a rather large side and there is plenty to share between 2 people. It included a mix of green and white asparagus. The asparagus was well cooked, though maybe a tadpole (oops, foreshadowing), I mean a tad too much for my liking.Now, about that egg...I love tails on puppy dogs and piglets but I don't love tails on poached eggs. And yet, there it was. A poached egg with a long tail. A big, fat tadpole on my asparagus. I'm thinking ungrateful thoughts about this damn polliwog and I'm suddenly reminded that I walked past a hungry man with a dying cat on the sidewalk. Am I selfish to want them to be the way my mother made poached eggs: always perfectly cooked in little round egg cups with compact whites and runny yolks? Never a runny white, especially not one with a stringy tail! Oh, Gage, why can't you treat that egg with the respect it deserves instead of cooking it into a baby frog costume? Why did you put a 2 star egg on my 3 star asparagus?Anyway, the Colorado lamb chops were medium rare and deliciously seasoned. I was extremely grateful to see these perfectly cooked with a red center. Brah. Vo! They came with a Merguez sausage that was flavorful but dry and underwhelming. The mustard greens were perfectly cooked and well seasoned, and the garbanzo bean fritters were crisp and tasty. Overall, probably close to 4 stars. My hubby's 8 oz bone-in prime filet steak was delicious although it wasn't the medium rare requested. It was more of a medium-well to well done. Well seasoned, but I really missed seeing that red center. I didn't even see pink. Also, this was a butcher board item. Again, although nothing on the menu indicated it, our server told us that this was grass-fed *eyebrow up*. At $38 for 8 oz, it should at least be perfectly cooked to order even if it ate cement for dinner.The Caesar salad was generously sized and very tasty. I could have eaten this alone for my meal, especially after experiencing the polliwog. The anchovies were just as salty as an anchovy should be and the dressing was perfectly tangy. Delicious. High 4 stars.Overall, probably close to 4 stars. There is plenty of room for improvement in the food, at least in several of the items we ordered. Service and ambiance however, were both easy 5 stars."
"The Gage is a really cool restaurant across the street from the Bean.  The decor is very Chicago and reminds me of old Chicago movies.  There was a fire place right next to our booth.  It's lively and the place is packed during lunch.  The waiters are all friendly and full of recommendations.  The bar is gorgeous and looks like its made of Mahogany wood.  Well, I think it was a reddish color but then again I'm color blind.  Anyway, I'm kind of on the fence about the Gage.  The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is amazing and what I imagined Chicago to be from the old movies.  However, the food wasn't very impressive as I would have hoped.  We had the following:1) Pountine Fries - The poutine fries was topped with cider braised pork shoulder, pork gravy and cheese curd.  The cheese curd and pork gravy made the dish extremely rich in flavor on top of starch heavy fries.  The pork gravy made it very creamy but didn't overdue it in saltiness department.  It's total comfort food and it was definitely made to share.  This dish was a starter, but after eating it I was finished.  The food coma started to overwhelm my consciousness and I started to get drowsy.    2) Lobster Roll - Ok.  Here's my thing with Lobster rolls.  I know they're supposed to be served cold but I personally like my Lobster rolls to be warm.  I like the lobster warm with freshly toasted brioche.  It provides a better flavor and texture to the roll.  Guess what?  That's how the Gage serves it.  The roll comes with fried onions, a buttery toasted brioche, a grilled lemon and a side of chips. The warm buttery toasted brioche blended very well with the warm lobster.  3) Venison Burger - The burger came with smoked gouda, fried jalapenos, woodland mushroom, pickled onions, a mustard Aioli spread, fries and ketchup.  Yeah I know.  I thought Chicagoans hated ketchup but I guess it's okay when it's eaten with a burger and fries.  The burger was cooked to medium rare as I specified and a decent size burger.  The venison didn't taste as fatty or juicy as a beef patty but the texture was similar to beef.  The toppings did make the burger a little better but the burger wasn't too impressive.Overall, the Gage has one major thing going for them, which is the decor and ambiance of the restaurant.  They get 5 stars in that department.  However, I didn't think the food was too impressive and ended up giving it 3 stars.  The other major plus is that they're located in the middle of the loop and a great place to stop by for lunch between sight seeing."
Came here to with a local friend and not only did we were able to get a nice booth but we also had fabulous service. New plates for every dish and so effortless I almost didn't even notice. We got the salmon tar tar and the scallops to start. We got the mussels to share and we almost didn't finish them because there was so many. They were nice enough to split our lamp chops! I think this a nice restaurant if you're looking for something nice and fancy I definitely enjoyed it.
"Great great space for dinner, drinks with friends, or both. // LOCATION // Perfect location across the street from Millennium Park // SERVICE // Excellent. The servers are prompt and sweet without being overly pushy. You can nurse your drink all night and no one will bother you. // FOOD //      + Fish and chips: They were so sweet to split our dish without even asking. The fish was crunchy without being overly oily      + Old Fashioned: Perfectly proportioned and finished off with a nice large ice cube     + Moscow Mule: Complete with copper cup!       + Moscato wine: Fruity and sweet * Avoid the junky food carts in the park, and skip over here instead for quality food and drinks"
"I can now get over the trauma of one of my last visits when the kitchen ran out of lobster rolls when I had my heart set on it!At this brunch outing, 4/6 of us ordered the lobster roll, as we were reminded to try the Gage's version after a recent Chicago lobster roll article we saw. At $23 for the entree, the size of the portion surpassed my expectations, but the execution on the roll fell short.  Rather than serve as the star of the dish, the lobster was hidden, both physically (hidden under a bed of onion strings) and by the chives, celery, and other mix-ins.  Chips were the side to the lobster roll, and you get a heaping serving.  I would have preferred more lobster... and present in meaty chunks at that vs. the shredded kind of form.  Seems like the Gage really made out on the margin on this dish."
Loved the watercress mushroom sandwich. Fancy and filling ~ the perfect duo. The restaurant is perfect for semi-casual or fancy brunch and lunch. The presentation of the food is beautiful and simple. I am sure the dinner atmosphere and menu offers more fanciness and deliciousness as well. The servers are excellent and so polite and helpful. Several waiters came to make sure our waters were always filled and the coffee warm.
"Found this place on Yelp alone...I came in 10 minutes before the kitchen closed in the middle of the NBA championship game and still managed to get amazing service and fantastic food. Service - 5 starsDrinks - 5 starsMussels - 4.5 stars (it's a tomato based sauce)Fries - 4 starsTat tar - 5 stars - but have your sever mix itThe vibe is great and the building is gorgeous, wonderful place to grab a full meal or a late night(ish) snack."
"Flew into town this day, so I was very hungry. This was my first visit to The Gage and we had a great dining experience. Jennifer was our server. She was very good and  efficient. She enhanced our time here. Our order: Amaretto, Stieglitz Radler, House Poutine, Bison Tartare, and a regular burger. My dinner was the House Poutine. It was so good. Poutine is a Canadian dish. I ate some almost everyday while in Montreal.  Poutine is potato french-fried with meat and gravy served over them.  That is way lacking in detail & the dish deserves a better description. Sorry. V and I think it was better than the Poutine we ate before. Large serving (more than I could eat).   My Amaretto Sour was right on the money. I add just a slash of OJ when I make it at home. This was almost that good. V said the Bison Tartare was excellent. Hubby loved his Burger. We would definitely eat here again. My new discovery this trip was the Stiegl Radler. It is a low alcohol grapefruit beer! It was so refreshing and light!"
"Food overall 4Service 2House Poutine: 3. Greasy and salty like poutine is meant to be. It's definitely good for making you thirsty.PBR pickles: 4. Smoked serrano aoli complemented the tart and crispy beer-battered pickles well. Meant to be shared amongst 4. Way too filling for even 2 to split.Daily pasta: 3. Neither good nor bad. Pekin duck: 4. Pan seared with spring onion rice cake, delicious. An fusiony twist with the pickled pineapple and red miso was surprisingly on point. It was generally well cooked but the meat could have been fresher. It was not choice duck.Venison Burger: 4.5Wow. I loved it. The smoked gouda and mushrooms on the venison made it the highlight.Fish and Chips: 3Fried light and crisp, good whitefish. But the ""chips"" were unoriginal and uninspiring. They were the lamest fries I've had in a while.Service was terrible. No waiter eye-contact with me just because I'm younger? Is it too much to ask for equal eye-contact? I went with an elderly couple, why do you guys assume that I'm not the one paying?  I was VERY generous with 15% on the PRE-discounted amount."
"Location: Across the spitting fountainsExcellent: Pre-theater mealPrivate party function spaceQuick meal at the barService and beers on TapGreat first date placeSummary: Gastropub with a friendly vibe which is perfect for a first date or pre-theater crowd before a show by the loop. Casual or dressy, this place had great food which was diverse and unexpectedly not your typical bar food joint. Great cheeses and savory savory dishes. It's a place you may come for happy hour, but transition into a nice dinner. I was able to walk to the B of A theater a few blocks away in the loop."
"Yo, it started the right way with Common playin' as we sat, then Mos Def while usin' the men's room-- I even washed my mitts extra long just to see if another Rawkus alumni would grace the joint, but instead I got a Biggie remix.That's what's up, and we let the manager know.From there, though, it just sort of fizzled out quality-wise.I really get bummed when my food beats my drinks to the table, and it don't help none that the second drink can't get ordered till after I've scarfed the meal.  My girl was sweet, but just not on point. And it wasn't crowded.Shrimp n' grits is what's up, however (please read the following in stuffy, erudite voice (think Thirston Howell III + Anton Ego from Ratatouille))--Shrimp, or Farfantepenaeus brevirostris, have minor biological differences from their close, crustaceous cousins the prawn, aye-kay-aye Penaeus esculentus, namely the number of claws, gills, and body shape. While it is widely accepted that they're interchangeable whence cooking, a prawn's eyeball quite closely resembles a black bean, also found in Gage's concoction, and can too easily loosen itself when removing the prawn's head, leaving the diner wondering if that black speck in your teeth she-beaux, as she's affectionately known, points out is, in fact, the fibre-ous, anti-oxidant ""meat"" of a bean, or a tiny sea-monster's ""peeper.""Aaaand, scene.Basically, I was like, ""Eww.""Pick up the pace at the bar, please, cuz your spot across from Millennial is slammin'."
"A friend and I came here during a Chicago trip to escape the rain. We sat in the bar although we weren't dressed as fancy (and pretty wet) as others. Despite that we were treated great and the waitress was bright and super friendly. Drink menu is expansive and everything we had we enjoyed. One of the few places I've noticed in the midwest where you can get a Belgian sour beer.The food menu was kind of short, and not many options not to mention pricey. My friend and I had just eaten a few hours before so we weren't terribly hungry so we asked if we could split the Fish and Chips. The waitress was very accommodating and did not seem put off in the slightest that we wanted to split. Good thing we split, the portion was HUGE and we each got 2-3 pieces of sizable fish and plenty fries with a normal portion of cold slaw. It was way more than we could eat but it was very delicious so we did end up eating it all. Great value for $17, they didn't charge extra for sharing either.Overall I would rate the restaurant a 4.5. If it had a bigger and more appealing overall food menu (somethings just seemed a bit to fancy for casual drinks and not enough other options) I would rate it a 5!"
"As always, I am never full on the third night of the conference when the organizer has this Mixer reception- too little food and too many attendees. I did homework this time. I found this place on yelp that's only four blocks away from Hilton Chicago, where the reception is held, and decided to have a late night dinner after the reception. I came here with a couple of friends. They were not hungry so they only got drinks. I ordered the pan-seared duck breast and a couple of beer. The limited Goose Island 312 urban radler was very interesting: the beer has a subtle cucumber flavor and a hint of lime and basil- very summery and light to drink. Loved it.  The duck breast was juicy and delicious- it was complimented nicely with the rice, bok choy, and pineapple. The duck linguisa was slightly smoky and easy to eat. My friends tried my food and ordered fish&chips, but they were not happy about what they got. The fish was bland and the batter was too heavy, they said."
"This is a great go to place for after work drinks and dinner. I like to sit in the corner of the side room where you are somewhat isolated from the noise in the bar and the rather load back rooms.I've liked all the appetizers and main courses I've tried on several visits, and most dishes are very shareable, so you can try a variety. The wine list is extensive, and there are some great selections by the glass, including a terrific Madeira. Service is professional and knowledgable. And of course there's a hug and boisterous bar if you're just looking for a drink."
"This restaurant is located right across Millennium Park. We made reservations ahead of time through Open Table to dine during lunch hours on a Thursday. I'm very happy that we did make reservations since it quickly filled up. Elizabeth was our server. She was very friendly and helpful! She's worked at this location for four years, though primarily during dinner shifts. We were lucky enough to run into her during lunch. If you see her, give her a friendly hello!  We ordered house soda (Blueberry Lemon), according to my friend was a bit too acidic and lacking the CO2 that is more expected of a soda. I had a bottle of the Goose Island Root Beer, which I thought was quite tasty since it was 100% natural sugar.For our meals, we ordered: The Gage Venison Burger and the Roasted Amish Chicken. The Gage Venison Burger was delicious! It typically comes with French fries, but I'm not much of a fries and burger type of person. I typically find French Fries too heavy. Elizabeth kindly suggested greens paired with a vinaigrette dressing since I was not interested in French fries. Of course, it went very well with the Venison Burger. Since Venison is a lean meat, the burger here was actually juicy due to the 30% beef fat that was made with the Venison. I easily ate this burger with a fork and knife since it was so juicy. Overall, very pleased with this burger!The Roasted Amish Chicken was perfectly juicy in the center. My friend said that the areas of the chicken towards the edges were drier (typical though due to the preparation). However, the meal was still quite delicious! Overall, if you are visiting the the city, be sure to check this place out!"
"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try the Gage for a very long time and finally got a 7:15 reservation on a Friday night.  First of all, the place is beautiful with glossy green subway tile and exposed brick. It was very busy and very loud, and although we arrived a little bit too early for our reservations, they were able to seat us within 10 minutes.    Appetizers- we got the fondue and scallops.  We enjoyed both.  The fondue was steaming hot and the coconut curry-like sauce for the scallops was very good.Entree- I got the daily pasta, which happened to be a kale and ricotta filled tortellini in vodka.  The pasta was super delicate and melt in your mouth but I did think the portion was a little too small.  My boyfriend got the duck, which he claimed was the BEST thing he had ever tasted in his life, so I highly recommend both.Desert- We were really torn between which desert we wanted, but went with the strawberry shortcake that our waiter recommended.  The strawberry ice cream/ sherbet on top was fantastic- super tart and you could really taste the strawberries.  I didn't really care too much for the cake part which I thought was crumbly and a bit dry.Least to say, it was a wonderful dining experience with a beautiful environment and plating. The Gage will definitely be the place to go when we have people come in to Chicago out of town."
"Some of the healthiest wine pours in the city!!! Order a glass of wine and it come served in a little carafe that actually is more like 2 glasses of wine about 8 oz and at 12-14 bucks a glass thats a great deal anywhere and definitely getting it in downtown Chicago.Great atmosphere a loud bustling space full of energy with a big bar up front and tables on the side and rear it's a fun place to people watch and hang out. With friendly servers and good service you can get in and out quick or have a leisurely dinner and take your time. We have eaten here a few times before and the food has always been good, but somethings are a little better then others. The shishito peppers are awesome, good for a group to nibble on and share they are only mildly spicy  if you shy away from a little heat still give em a try they are super tasty. The house poutine  is fantastic I will order this every time I go to The Gage the whole dish comes together like a yummy symphony of gooey crispy succulent flavors, probably the best poutine I have ever had. Fries with curry sauce are also a must try golden crispy fries served with a big bowl of brown curry sauce for dipping.  The fried pickle chips where just ok pickles where to thin and I have had numerous better even here in the city. The burrata I would not order again the gazpacho has a odd smokey flavor and the burrata is not creamy and flavorful like burrata should be plus the cheese is served to cold which masks the flavor it did have. Lastly we had the fish and chips, the waiter had the kitchen split it for the two of us and it came out looking like 2 whole orders, great bang for the buck and equally great service. Each plate was served with 2 pieces of fish a healthy order of fries and all the dipping sauces and coleslaw. Some of the fish was served a little soggy not as crispy as good fried fish crust should be but the flavor was still good. I was a little disappointed in this dish as they fried everything else to perfection. Add it all together and you got a great place with a great bar area for drinks plus pretty solid food. We went here before heading to Soldiers Field and actually stopped on the way back for a night cap also. A little bit of a walk but a good option before or after seeing something there."
"I came here for lunch on one weekend afternoon around 1:30pm and it was packed, so make sure to make reservations! However, their little outdoor patio which is really nice to sit and people watch on Michigan Avenue does not take reservations. We really wanted to sit here so we had to wait an extra 20 minutes or so for a table which is fine with me. The inside has that nice, dark bistro feel to it so I definitely prefer sitting outside especially when Chicago decides to cooperate with us.Upon sitting down, our server approached us right away and offered us some of their huge beer selection which was nice. They also do provide bread and butter if you ask, it's more of a healthy multi-grain kind if that's your type. We decided to get the Vindaloo mussels for an appetizer and it took like 10 minutes or so to get those out but once they were brought out, they were scorching hot so i knew that they were just freshly out of the pot. They were delicious, definitely get these. There is definitely enough to share and for $18 I totally think they are worth it, full of spicy flavor with some indian spices to give them that extra flare, definitely one of the best in the city I would have to say. Next stop is this much talked about venison burger which is known as one of Chicago's best burgers. I must say I thought I would be disappointed because of all the hype, but I was pleasantly surprised. For $17 get the venison over their regular burger. The meat was perfection and not too chewy or dry, had tons of flavor that it almost didn't need all their extra ingredients but I can't say I didn't enjoy the caramelized onions, the gouda cheese, jalapeños on a warm brioche bun. We shared this as well and we chose their house made chips over the fries because I am most definitely a chip girl.Here's where we didn't go 100%. I hated the dessert. They have these new profitores (sp?) which are filled with cream and carmel and served with some chocolate ice cream. They were dry for me even though the presentation was spot on. For a $12 dessert, I was just hoping for more. I know they used to have tons of chocolate fudge desserts on the menu and I'm really sad that they took those away. So yes, bring back the fudge Gage!Overall, it's a great place to grab a quick lunch in the area, definitely a nice bistro, but I would work on the desserts and have at least one focus on the chocolate for all those chocolate specific lovers like me."
"I'm moving to Chicago. Done. That's it. I'm moving into this restaurant and never leaving. I could never eat another thing in my life. Scallops and Elk. Perfect. I almost dropped some on the floor and would have eaten it anyway. Well, maybe not.. but really, I can't decisively say. Towards the end I found myself taking smaller and smaller bites just to continue keeping the flavour in my mouth. Oh. My. Goodness.Service: friendly, cute, and prompt.Decor: fun and romantic yet not too much so you can still go with friends and not just a date.Price: worth it.But let's get back to that food. GET IN MY MOUTH. Wow. Most sensual food experience I've ever had. Thank you. So much. I'm coming back just for this place. And please, dress nicely. The food demands your respect."
"We came to The Gage on a beautiful Sunday morning for brunch. We sat outside and the weather was great. The service was a little slow, but our waitress was very friendly. I had a mimosa and the Bellini for drinks. The mimosa was good but the Bellini was great! My mom had a Bloody Mary which initially didn't come with the garnish, but they came by with it later. We started with the Irish scones, scotch egg, and the PBR fried pickles. All were great, but that had to have been the best scotch egg I've ever had! The scones were pretty incredible too. My mom and I shared the smoked salmon (aka bagels and lox). That is my favorite breakfast meal and it did not disappoint here. My boyfriend for the burger which he loved, and my dad enjoyed the homemade corned beef hash! Overall, brunch was excellent and I would love to go back to try dinner at The Gage!"
"Aww I am a huge fan of their Duck Poutine, I was told it is the best in Chicago and I believe it certainly! It is even better than in some places in Montreal!!I just went there to try the Poutine as friends strongly recommended it to me, and I wasn't disappointed. It goes very well with some of their Revolution pale ale. Also, we had a plate of cheese for dessert, which was fine.We went there on a Thursday evening around 8:30, without any reservation, and managed to sit down at the last available table for 2! Unfortunately, we couldn't get on the patio.Service was excellent  - always important to emphasize.The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice as well. Definitely a great place to go, ideally located in from of the AIC."
"Really charming place with creative dishes! The hype train is quite real with this one, as The Gage delivers (not literally) for all but the stingiest of critics.The menu is separated into ""Firsts"", ""Seconds"", and ""Thirds"". Do yourself a favor and read through each of these sections carefully, as there are unique gems dispersed among these sections. The Scotch Egg was a surprising hit for us (it's huge!), as was the Salmon Tartare (a must if you're a salmon fan).The flavor of the fish and chips was nice, but nothing revolutionary. However, the portions are quite large, the fries are crispy, and the fish is presented a newspaper cone! Definitely worth the $17 price tag!The real showstopper in my eyes though is the Roasted Amish Chicken. I had no idea roast chicken could be so juicy and flavorful. If I'm ever back in town and I find myself here, this will definitely be my entree of choice.Had a great experience at The Gage! Service is fantastic, no matter what attire you wear (suits and t-shirts are equally common here). If you're in the area - and you out-of-towners especially have a good reason to be in the area - give it a try!"
"It was a rainy evening in Chicago..., no it really is. The food is very good, the mgmt is pretentious and the atmosphere is as well. The food is good/ Caesar salad was very good- fish and chips were average- the peanut butter cake was really nice/ but you can do better in this town.I ate here because it was highly recommended on yelp, but I tend to disagree. Some much better offerings in the Gold Coast area- so do your homework and find something worth your time and money. And if they're full, you can sit at the bar and not worry about booking a reservation through open table. I shudder to think if I had tried to use an opentable voucher how well that might have gone. One last comment, the closeness of the tables is a bit uncomfortable- so if you like eavesdropping on others conversations, then this is your kinda place. Bon APETIT"
"Always a classic spot on Michigan, especially if you're going to the Theatre, Museum, or a CAF event. Reservations are highly recommended and you can book on Open Table. The food menu is pretty extensive, and the cocktails are creative and tasty. We opted for the burrata and oysters to start. The buratta was great, but the oysters were a bit small. For the main, we shared the bone in ribeye, which was cooked perfectly. To accompany it, we ordered the asparagus and potatoes, with the former being my favorite of the two since it had a perfectly poached egg on top. Overall, food and drinks were great, but make sure you make a reservation! PS: The hand lotion in the mens room smells fantastic. Random, but damn, it did smell good....."
"Delicious new American food, great environment and need make appointment because of popularity, the food is decent, and price is a little bit higher, but still attract a lot of people coming."
"The boyfriend and I made a pit stop here because it started to rain after we saw ""the bean"". We were seated quickly and knew exactly what we were ordering thanks to recommendations from our local friend. We ordered the P.E.I. Mussels (vindaloo and toast) and the House Poutine Fries (cider braised pork shoulder, pork gravy, and cheese curds). Both were delicious although I would have preferred the vindaloo to be a little bit thicker because it was more on the watery side (since there was toast to dip it in). This was the first time I ever had Poutine fries and didn't know what to expect. Luckily, I fell in love! I finished most of the Poutine fries leaving very little to share. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, we were surrounded by friendly staff. I would love to come back to try more of the menu!"
"Changing menus!  That's what makes this gastropub a must go every time you return here!  Beer selections with gourmet bar food that is seasonal.  What a great way to change it up, otherwise, it will get a bit boring coming here.You must get their Poutine!  Their Poutine was delightfully delicious!  It was with cider braised pork shoulder, chopped pickled red onion, with chunks of Wisconsin cheese curds, jalepenos and poured over roasted pork gravy!  YUM!Per the bartender's recommendation, do get their Daisy Cutter Pale Ale.  It complimented well with the Poutine!The ambiance is chill and it will be swell to have company to dine with here so you can try more of their other gastropub entrees.I was enGAGEed indeed!"
"I had amazing time here! We were looking for lunch during a long break at Chicago. I saw reviews of this restaurant and noticing that it is probably expensive but wanted a treat. So went there and checked the menus which wasn't that pricey. There was some wait time so we sat at the bar. The barman was amazing: we wanted to share a burger and have some extra sides. When food arrived we got two half burgers in separate plates with all the sides. What a service. Fast, thoughtful and food was amazing. Highly recommended"
"Solid. That's the word to describe The Gage. There's nothing fantastic. There's nothing wrong. Everything is just solid. But, honestly, that's how a place in the loop should be. This is my go to place for work lunches. They understand how to make you feel welcomed, while getting you on your way, without feeling rushed. Good beer selection and an even better whiskey selection. for being on Michigan Avenue, the prices are really fair. Don't get tricked into visiting Seven Lions. While they are similar, in concept, The Gage is heads and shoulders better."
"This is a great spot along Michigan Ave to grab a nice dinner.  We tried the shishito peppers, stone fruit and naan, scallops and grits, halibut, and Amish chicken.  They were all great.   The dishes pair some interesting flavors together and all were executed beautifully.  The service was prompt and friendly as well.  The Gage also has a large bar area, and I'll bet it's a good place for happy hour.  Would definitely come back if I'm in the Chicago area."
"Having just woken up from a 3day extravaganza known as the Grateful Dead @ soldier field I needed a really good meal. The concierge sent me straight to The Gage. Amazing service was met with outstanding food. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, a bit messy for my state of mind, great flavor and soft bread. I paired this with the sautéed mustard greens which really hit it out of the park for me. Solid sustenance on a shaky day. Thanks Gage. I'll be back."
"One of the best fish and chips I've had, and that's including the ones I had in London. My hubby ordered their version of steak and eggs and it was delish. Although it probably wasn't the best choice considering that we had our baby with us, I would totally go back there."
"The Gage has a great menu with much to offer. It's a gastropub in the best sense of the term. The food is quite nice. Great selections of wines, beers, and mixed drinks.  Well located. The only comment is that at least on a Friday night was packed so definitely need to make a reservation-- unless you are comfortable sitting at the bar.  Also not a place to come for a quiet conversation. Great place. I highly recommend it. I had the pasta of the day which was very fresh and flavorful. My only comment was that the fettuccine was a bit overcooked and not al dente."
Amazing food order the mussels and scotch egg for your appetizer. Awesome!The porterhouse Pork is awesome. With a side of stacked potatoes
"Very good food, but very touristy. I think they cook their meat well and their burgers are the bomb. The service is very friendly, and it's conveniently located next to Millenium Park. I like the atmosphere of the restaurant, as pretentious as that sounds, because it is  both casual, but more formal than the typical burger joint. However, I will say that the restaurant is too expensive for the food you get. I want to try their cocktails in the future!"
"Sunday night, party of 2, 8pok so we ate our faces off.  even the waitress was startled at how much we ordered and how much we ate.  Excellent service - our server was fantastic.  Great selection of draft beers and fancy cocktails*Mussels vindaloo: delicious.  enough flavor to season the mussels but not drown them either. the broth was so good, we drank it like a soup.  hope this is not a faux pas. *Bison tartar: incredible.  all raw-meat-diseases be damned.  this was awesome.  no raw egg.  fantastic meld of flavors.  *Baked brie: small pot of baked cheesy goodness that seemed bottomless.  we just kept eating it and there kept being cheese in that pot.  *Rack of elk $45: neither of us have ever had elk before, so when we saw it, we thought, eh, why not?  my friend loved it and i was so-so about it.  we ordered it with the chimichurri sauce.  i thought it tasted gamey but still edible.  it was cooked perfectly.  i may not be an elk fan.  *Curry fries: giant ass bowl of fries with a delicious red curry that you dip the fries in.  good but not my fave.  *Green beans: delicious.  great lemon-orange citrusy essence to them.  cooked well!*Chocolate toffee cream puffs: not my fave dessert.  the pastry of the cream puffs seemed thick, but the toffee inside was delicious.  chocolate gelato was meh.  great atmosphere.  it's right on michigan avenue across the street from millennium park.  plenty of seating at tables, booths and the bar.  definitely will be back to try their other menu items."
"I have no problem busting out the wallet for some good food. However, I still better be getting my money's worth.I went to The Gage for breakfast after a race and ended up getting the Irish breakfast and a few beers. Granted, it was good. I'm not sure if it was $20 good, especially for breakfast. I know what goes into sausage and eggs. The bread was really good and the wait staff was nice. Additionally, they let a bunch off stinky runners come in, so that's always a plus.In summary, I would rather come here for dinner someday, but I'm not really a meat fan and this place seems like the type of place you would check out for some exotic meats."
"One of my all time favorite places to come have lunch with friends. Whenever I have anyone visiting this is the must go for lunch! We always start here. Like today, I have a friend from Saudi Arabia and this is where we came to show him how To have lunch in Chicago looks like! The drinks are amazing specially the punch! Highly recommended"
"Ask about their pasta dishes. The place next door makes fresh pasta and they sometimes get it and make marvelous speicals out of it,  not in the menu."
"It's unfortunate that The Gage had to follow our experience at The Aviary and the Truffle Explosion. We had a reservation for the three of us for a Wednesday night and when we got there, it was PACKED.  I guess that means we were in the right place! Having come off some boozy cocktails, we were definitely ready for food. We got right down to business when looking at the menu and went with the following:Appetizer:Fried Pickles: DELICIOUS. I loved the aioli sauce that came with itMains:Trout SpecialThe Gage Venison BurgerPasta Special + Chicken Quarter: After the waiter told us about the special semolina pasta that's made next door topped with an over easy egg, with the option of adding on chicken, I was sold. The chicken was cooked absolutely perfectly, with a little bit of crispy skin and juicy meat.  The egg and the pasta combo was equally delicious, and it turned into a fairly large dish.Side: Shishito PeppersDessert: Corn and Blueberries: ABSOLUTELY DIVINE. I love cornbread and I love blueberries. This was a perfect combo that you wouldn't think to put together.  I'm so glad we did this, even if I was stuffed from my main (and on my way to getting drunk with the bottle of wine that was shared).Our waiter was SO nice and indulged us in our touristy questions about what Chicago's like.  Obviously the pricing here is a little steep, but considering that we all ate what we ordered (and had a lot of the shishito peppers left over), I'd say that it was fairly comparable to what you might find in SF. Since Chicago's got a lot of great options for restaurants, I'd like to try other places before coming back here, otherwise it was a solid dinner option for us visitors."
"My cousin took me here for Sunday brunch and the corned beef hash with poached eggs was so incredibly extraordinary.  Melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  My cousin ordered the venison burger, which I tried, and wow.  I will fly back to Chicago just to eat here again!  The service was friendly and I loved my multiple ice tea refills.  We started with the pastry special - an apple strudel - that was flaky and delicious - but actually not necessary as the portions are very generous and I left so very full.  What a great spot!  Go here!"
"If I honestly didn't feel like I stepped into a Business Week magazine rather than a Food Network magazine, I would probably have rated this place a 4.5/5. And should actually be closer to a 4.5 as my experience here was top of the line. Though I did feel that this was a nitch above casual for a lunch outing, the hosts and our waiter certainly didn't make it feel stuffy in there. Service was 5 stars all the way. My travel buddy and I went to meet with an old friend of mine who happened to move to the city the week before to attend University of Chicago. I'd read great reviews on the food here and it definitely didn't disappoint. The menu was a little small but thankfully, their specials were what wowed us. My friend and I opted for the grilled salmon special while my other friend ordered the shrimp sandwich that came with a side of red quinoa. Salmon was perfectly grilled, though a little on the salty side, everything else was delish. HOWEVER, the shining dish IMO was the shrimp sandwich. Looking like a fancy bahn mi sandwhich, the bread was perfectly crunched on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The shrimp and all the adds inside the bread was to drool for. Quinoa was also good, though just a little bland. All in all, had a great time with great company, food, and service. I'd probably suggest a dinner here for those that are locals and work in the area. But as a traveller and for a lunch, I'd check some other places out. This conveniently is located right in front of ""The Bean"" so I do appreciate a quality restaurant in such a popular, high traffic, location."
"Visiting Chicago from Florida- The Gage was appealing because it was walkable from my hotel.The menu is a bit limited but everything is fresh and prepared perfectly. Service was very professional, better than some $$$$ places I have been too.A great choice for a Chicago visitor looking for a nice dinner in the Loop."
"Stopped-in for lunch after visiting the Art Institute of Chicago earlier in the day. Needed lunch and a quick brew before heading out of town.+ Sat at the large, comfy bar and were promptly greeted and offered samples- Bar was *super* drafty and cold, but not from the front door; A/C was *cranked* despite it being 4F and windy outside. Why?- Limited tap beer list, but most taps were interesting+ Comprehensive top-shelf liquor menu (Dalmore 15? Yes, please!)+ Interesting food menu+ Venison burger was superb, and cooked to absolute perfection (medium rare)- Fries were pedestrian and nothing spectacular- Bun was far too big and very light on flavor; didn't add to the burger at all+ Excellent mushroom salad - I'd eat this every day if I could+ Reasonable lunch pricing+ Outstanding restrooms and awesome soaps/lotion- Service dropped completely off after we received food. Couldn't flag down the bartender to save my life, so I left cash in the tab glass."
"Venison burger and Johnny cakes. Remember those words and you'll be a happy diner at the gage. I hadn't been here in several years, but some friends and stopped in on Sunday after the hot chocolate 15k. We got separate meals and shared the Johnny cakes for dessert, which worked out really well. My venison burger was absolutely delicious: the waiter recommended it at medium rare because venison apparently doesn't have much fat and otherwise would dry out. The temperature was perfect as was the seasoning. That burger was gone within 10 min. The Johnny cakes were topped with a blueberry compote and were really good. Service was also excellent. I don't know how the gage fell off my radar but it's back on!!!"
"The Gage was our first meal on our recent mini-vakay to Chicago. We were staying at the Palmer House and would be getting in right around dinner time. We wanted something *good* within walking distance (we don't eat at chains and we wanted something a bit upscale without being fancy). Reviews for The Gage were outstanding so we made a reservation. I sure am glad we did because a couple who came in right after us were told they'd have a 40-minute wait -- and this was a boring old Tuesday night at 8 pm.Because so many reviewers raved about the Scotch egg, we had to order it -- even without knowing what exactly it was. For those who don't know, it's basically a hard-boiled egg encased in some kind of dough, then deep fried. I loved it; my husband was 'meh' about it. Regardless, it's a fun appetizer that I highly recommend for something a little different. We didn't want anything super-heavy so we ordered from the 'Firsts' section of the menu, rather than the 'Entree' section. My husband nearly died from ecstasy eating the Tom Kha Scallops and I thoroughly enjoyed the Ora King Salmon Tartare. The portions of these were bigger than standard 'appetizers' but smaller than entrees. After that, we felt we had just enough room in our tummies to share the Charcuterie Board, which is basically meat fondue, so we could each also order dessert. I really encourage meat-eaters to try this amazing dish. Housemade sausages and delicate salami dipped into toe-curling cheese goo. UH-mazing!For dessert, my hubby didn't hesitate to order the Chocolate Toffee Cream Puffs, but I was torn between that and the Meyer Lemon Cream Pie. I asked our wonderful waiter what he thought and he immediately suggested the pie, so that's what I went with. Let's just say my hubby was a bit jealous of my fantastically delicious dessert. :-D As for the cream puffs, he thought they were just okay. They weren't standard cream puffs, but rather small balls (presumably fried), and he says they weren't as sweet as he'd hoped they'd be. All of that could very well be personal preference so don't judge them by his ultra-sweet sweet-tooth.The restaurant is small and dark (in a good way, though my 40-something eyes did have a little trouble reading the menu), with a large, busy bar area. It was the perfect start to our vacation and one of our favorite memories!"
"Hushed but audible expletives escaped from my lips, piercing the buzz of hollow dinner-party palaver. My hands were greedily clasped on a Dagwood sandwich at The Gage. I had just taken my first bite and franky, I was unapologetic.The Gage is an Irish gastropub, parallel to the architectural masterpiece, Millennium Park. Dagwood ($16) is sorted under ""Lunch"" however, due to its monumental size, ""Lunch and Dinner"" is more appropriate. The towering sandwich is presented on an unfinished wooden cutting board, complete with a heavy-duty steak knife. Tackling a sandwich like this requires a methodical strategy.A traditional Dagwood exhibits an array of deli meats and condiments neatly stacked together, secured with a wooden skewer. The Gage utilizes high-quality ingredients for maximum flavor. In between three slices of sesame-kissed Italian Pugliese bread are tender slivers of roast beef, cured salami, and succulent turkey breast. The Pugliese bread has a fairly similar composition to ciabatta except its main ingredient, white flour, is substituted with whole wheat flour. It has a remarkable flavor and a sturdy texture. The sandwich is embellished with ribbons of sauerkraut, melted cheddar cheese, and alkaline giardiniea. Each section is liberally painted with streaks of freshly blended red pepper aioli and tart yellow mustard aioli. Sweet, crisp leaves of bibb lettuce neutralize the saltiness of the sandwich simultaneously enhancing it with a delightful crunch. Altogether, this delicious sandwich will surely inspire you to exercise vocabulary that would make Gordan Ramsay proud. A clear disparity between the restaurants in New York and Chicago is the space of the establishment. The Gage's space is capacious. The restaurant has floor to ceiling windows for optimal natural lighting. Underneath the blanket of menacing storm clouds, the establishment remained well-lit and bright. Some Pro Tips: The Gage is not shy with libations which are offered as early as 10:00 AM. 18 beers are on draft in addition to hand-crafted cocktails. Replace your ordinary cup of joe with an Irish Coffee ($12)."
"A friend and I tried The Gage out for brunch and it was a great experience. We were seated right away and drinks/food came out really quick. The Gage Bloody Mary was delicious. The cappuccino was great. I ordered the scallops and they were perfect. We sat there for a little while trying to finish our drinks after we paid and no one seemed bothered (which I appreciated). Overall, it was a great experience for BRUNCH and I would go back."
"Sides: shishito peppers, market veggies (frissee, evoo, onion, butternut,  parsnips,  pepitas, pickled raisins, green onion)Peppers were smoky and rich with so much flavor. Would definitely order again and recommend. Market veggies were delicious and perfect compliment to all the interesting and crazy flavors. They definitely held their own in flavor and freshness. Good balancer.Fish & Chips: Super fresh, good portioning. Would definitely order again. Not the star of the meal.Venison Burger: Mouth-watering good. Moist and so much flavor in every single bite.Bread Pudding: TO-DIE-FOR. So rich and creamy yet dense and just the perfect amount of texture. And not too sweet which is unusual for us and bread pudding. We were hesitant but the waitress said it was her go to and their holiday seasonal offering.Ambiance:Hip. Loud. Young.Service:Excellent.Overall:Might be one of Mo & I's favorite meals overall. Great experience."
Lively (actually noisy) restaurant with an interesting menu and reasonable prices. Our group of 8 found it good value. Definitely worth going back to if staying in the Loop.
"Wow, The Gage was a solid 4.5 meal and experience.  Located in the tourist Capitol of Chicago; The Loop, The Gage had a very authentic and familiar feel. This could be attributed to its earthy and speakeasy feel and decor. Although The Gage is a bar, it has a very upscale elegance about it. Upon entrance were pleasantly greeted upon arrival and sat at a bar side table. However they do have ample outdoor seating. Additionally, The Gage is located directly across the street from the Millennium Park near the water exhibits and fountain. The service was good, not great. It took quite a while for our server to greet us and it was well after rush hour. The Fondue appetizer was superb. I highly recommend this. They brought out two servings of bread and we couldn't have been more pleased. The Fish and Chips were phenomenal as well. I split them with my wife and it was more than enough. In fact, when it was brought to our table we stopped the server and told them there had been a mistake; we only ordered one order of Fish and Chips, to which he replied that it was indeed only one serving portioned and plated for two (a very nice touch). WOW. After the fondue, wine, and Belgian beer, we were unable to even finish our split meal. Great portion size and taste. Overall, The Gage was a wonderful experience. Every time we find ourselves near The Loop we will certainly be back."
"Went here for  brunch on Saturday.  I got the corned beef hash and my girlfriend got the mushroom sandwich and chicken orzo soup. Everything was the bomb!Upscale hash that  rivaled the hash in a can that I grew up on! Moist, flavorful,  not too salty or greasy. Hollandaise was a nice accompaniment without too much lemon flavor. Make reservations and GO!"
Very nice place to eat and get good food. I had the salmon sandwich and it was delicious.  The service was great and the atmosphere was lively. The food came out promptly. Can't say much about the bill since I didn't pay but the menu prices seemed just a tad expensive but well worth it. Will definitely be back for lunch.
"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here. Love the atmosphere, casual, but elegant. Perfect, romantic lighting without being too stuffy. The service was very attentive and the presentation was great. We started with the poutine and loved it. We both had steaks and v they were delicious. The chimichurri sauce was fantastic. My husband went for the classic bernaise and really liked it as well. We skipped dessert because we were to full!"
Exceptional serviceGreat atmosphere Crispy  new potatoes are awesome Chocolate peanut butter layer cake will have you wishing you had room for anther one. OMG!!!
"We were here for late night cocktails and the bar area is nice for that. Lots of high tables and seating right at bar side. We had two drinks off their special menu a Pisco Punch something like a blueberry whiskey smash, plus a Guinness. All great. We were west coast folks and timed it right to see the Warriors win game 5 on one of the bar TVs."
"I was excited to eat here since there are many great reviews on Yelp. Hate to say it, but I was a bit underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty good, but nothing to rave about. I do have to note that the service was excellent, and our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. He helped us veer through the menu and gave us plenty of recommendations. The draft beer list was amazing. We had the pepper appetizer, the scallops, and the venison burger. Everything was good but not omg amazing like I had hoped, especially since the menu is pretty pricey. Great location though!"
"If you are a tourist in Chicago and looking for a lunch spot after checking out millennium park or the art museum, just stop now and go to The Gage.If you are a poor student like me, order sandwiches and you will still be blown away. The ambiance makes you feel important and the service is top-notch. I ordered the buffalo chicken burger and it was phenomenal. The buffalo sauce was tangy and just spicy enough, but then cooled down by the crisp and flavorful slaw on top. The Venison burger is legendary, and much as been said about that already here on yelp.Drinks are bottomless and the soup is delicate and satisfying.Make sure you make a reservation! as we got the last one for lunch by calling the night before."
"Came here for brunch on a Saturday, it was packed and got seated as soon as we walked through the door. Try the cinnamon raisin french toast, it is hands down the best I have ever had."
"Fine-dining establishment, good for business. Top-notch service, but too stuffy and buttoned-up. Just not a place I'd seek out as a 20-something year old unless I'm treating my parents. This sentiment largely influences my 3-star review - it's only a-ok from my perspective.Serves up quality American cuisine. I ordered a scallop salad. The scallops (paired with grapefruit segments, fried onions, grilled cucumber - not too different from raw) were deliciously well-executed, but a bit overwhelmed by the heap of butter lettuce dressed in sesame vinaigrette. While intended to be a lunchtime meal, this salad was insubstantial. If you are even remotely hungry, I'd consider other options."
"The Gage is one of few places downtown that is very solid with food and beverages. Last time I came, just had beers and the ones on tap are delicious, in particular the Moody Tongue porter. Liquid dessert is what it is! Keep this place in mind when you need to take your clients out for lunch or dinner!"
"Conveniently located across the street from the Institute of Art (this is totally worth noting), The Gage is good, real good. I had the Jambalaya and it was perfect - right spice, right heat, right temperature, right (you get it). The bar was inviting but so are the booths. The bathroom is downstairs and if you visit its like walking into the 1940s - with small ceramic tiles and lots of wood.Such a cool vibe in here."
"I've been dying to try this place, so when a friend asked to meet for dinner one night I immediately suggested The Gage and made a reservation for 6:30 PM on a Wednesday night. I happened to arrive a little early and decided to request a table outside because it was SO LOUD inside the restaurant as other Yelpers have said. The hostess was nice enough to seat me right away before my friend came since she said those tables went quickly. A+ for service and I had barely walked through the door!For drinks, my friend and I decided to get beers since we were at a gastropub and when in Rome... I'm actually not a huge beer drinker, so we asked our waitress what she recommended and went with the Good Juju, which is a pale ale with ginger added. It turned out to be the perfect refreshing beer for the meal and I especially loved the ginger taste which wasn't too overpowering.It was a bit harder to decide on food since everything on the menu looked delicious. We ended up ordering the ""PBR"" battered fried pickles, scotch egg, the ""crispy, sticky, smoky lamb ribs"", and an order of the fish and chips. The 3 appetizers came out first and they were all divine. My favorite dish was the lamb ribs because crispy, sticky, and smoky they were! I normally don't order lamb at restaurants, but boy am I glad we just went for it because they were to.die.for. However, beware the portion size of the fried pickles because it was HUGE! Sharing that app with only 1 other person was a mistake because I was feeling too greased out after a couple of them to enjoy anything else...and we still had the fish and chips coming out! We decided to order a half dozen oysters on top of everything else in order to cleanse our palates, which was a great idea because they did just that and they were so good topped with pink trout roe and ponzu mignonette. Mmmm!When the fish and chips came out on 2 plates, I fervently told the waiter we only ordered 1, but was told that they split the order for us to share. Even split in half, each half order was HUGE. Unfortunately, I was only able to put down 1 piece of fish, which was crispy and moist. Overall, the Gage was a great experience because of the fantastic service, awesome food, and relaxing outdoor seating. I'm not sure how I would've felt if I had to sit inside, but I would be willing to risk it to try more dishes on the menu next time!"
"Solid place for lunch. I really like the eclectic vibe and the space is quite nice too. I can imagine it being a great place for happy hours. We ordered the poutine, which was very flavorful though I wished it had more chunky beef. The fondue was also nice too (just don't calorie count).The lobster roll was very fresh, though I wished they had more lobster. I loved how buttery the bun is and it's very lightly toasted and soft and doughy. I feel like that ratio of bun to lobster was just a tad too high, especially if I'm paying $23? Hm... I think maybe I should wait to go to Boston for my next lobster roll. I did, however, like the side salad. It's also unfortunate that they messed up our table's orders two times, although I guess that's what you get with a lunch crowd."
"I came here solely based off of reviews I'd seen on yelp, which all promised a great dining experience.I arrived later in the evening and sat at the bar. I wasn't feeling like a heavy meal, but the menu was the kind that changes that pretty quickly. Torn between the cider-braised pork poutine and the fish and chips, I ended up settling with the fish. Having grown up in London, I like to think I know about this dish pretty well. When it arrived, the visual appearance of the dish was a great mix of classic British culture (with the fish wrapped in traditional newspaper) with a real addition of class as the tartare, coleslaw and ketchup came in their own ramekins. The quality of the food did not disappoint, as the fish came out in 3 smaller pieces, giving plenty of their fresh, crispy batter. The fish inside was fresh, and fell apart in just the way you want it to.The atmosphere was classier than I was dressed, however this didn't seem to bother anyone, which was nice. The service was fast and friendly, even as the bar grew more crowded, it didn't alter.Overall, a great experience, with a lot of class and high quality food."
"I've been here twice: once for drinks and dessert and once for Sunday lunch. They were both great experiences. I made last-minute reservations for the brunch and I did not make reservations for drinks/dessert (because it was 7:45 on a weeknight). Both were great experiences! I'll share a little about each. Sunday lunch: I had just completed the Chicago triathlon and suffice it to say that I was very hungry. Energy bars and a banana were just not doing it for me. I needed real sustenance! Three of us arrived at The Gage and we were seated right away. The service was seriously on point. Everyone went out of their way to take care of us and treated is with the utmost respect even though I was wearing a triathlon tshirt and I had a huge black racing number tattoo going down the side of one arm with a black sharpie marker wave number on the other. Our waiter was actually interested in what I had competed in and asked me about it. I ordered a mushroom sandwich with fries. It was really delicious. The fries were so good that when a homeless person saw me walking outside with the leftovers and asked me for them, I said no because they were so good that I needed to covet them. My friend didn't like her cold soup (it was supposed to be prepared as such), so our lovely server brought her out a new bowl of something different. He also left the cold soup in case someone else wanted to eat it, which was cool. This was an awesome experience!Weekday drinks/dessert: There weren't many seats available without a reservation, which surprised me because it was almost 8 PM on a weeknight, but they seated us at a table near the door and brought another chair. The three of us each ordered a drink. I went with the hot cider because it was cold outside. My drink was good, but my friend's hot Irish coffee was better. Our service was really great the whole meal. We had trouble flagging down our server at one point and the hostess graciously came over and bright my friend's old fashioned to the bar because it was too strong for her. Once the bartender added some sprite, she said it was much better. Our dessert (pot de creme) was good, but I wasn't blown away. It couldn't compare to the pot de creme from Autre Monde (this is my official plug for it if you haven't been there). The candied cashews didn't seem to gel with the dish. Also, the serving size was pretty small and a little pricey. Of course, this is all to be expected at a ""$$$"" establishment. Overall, I had two great experiences here. I'm a bit torn between 4 and 5 stars. The service is really incredible, but some of the food is a little off. I expect to be back here many more times in the future, especially because I still haven't had the pleasure of trying their fish and chips (or their red snapper). I hope I'll be able to update this review to five stars when the time comes."
"YYYYYUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYY!!!!!!!Mussel Vindaloo & House Poutine!!!Every single poutine & mussel dish I eat I compare to the gage. They give you bountiful amount of food. Yes, the price is high but absolutely worth it!"
Excellent Plantation Daiquiri with pistachio. Excellent beat salad and excellent bison tartare. Nice bartenders and nice space.
"If you want someplace a little more high end than your typical Irish pub, The Gage is for you! I'm a fan of the dark, heavy, wood furniture and cozy bar atmosphere. It's nice to dress up a little and hang downtown every once in a while!The stand-outs on the menu are the scotch egg, fish & chips, and lobster roll. My one complaint is that the cocktails are a bit pricey for what they are. There are such great options for very well-crafted cocktails in Chicago that restaurants need to start stepping up their game if they want to hang with the likes of Scofflaw, Violet Hour, Bar Deville, and Barrelhouse Flat. Mixing with a higher quality booze isn't the only step. The recipes need to be just right and drinks at the Gage just taste average. Knock of a buck or two on every item on the cocktail menu, and I'd be satisfied!"
"Visited Chicago for a very short period of time and I saw this place on TV And I wanted to be sure the POUTINE was the real deal.It was EVERYTHING and more. Delicious, perfectly cooked fries with the gravy, pickled onions and cheese curd I would fly to Chicago again just for these. What a delight!!! I also tried the burgers, wow. The venison ?? Please order it when u go. Perfectly cooked burger. We also had a bottle of moscato for the table. We were seated outside and enjoyed the streets of Chicago. Will def be back, great service as well!"
"Went to gage for lunch and it was very good. Nice ambiance. Poutine was good with big pieces of pork. Ordered the venison burger since many prior tellers recommended it, and it was in fact great! Juicy and flavorful. The fries are also amazing, just right in the crispiness. The smoked salmon BLT was ok, but had a fairly strong fishy taste. Friend ordered the pork butt sandwich special and said it was very good also."
Moody Tongue porter beerScotch EggCowboy RibeyeGreen BeansFantastic serviceDelicious mealWonderful experience
"We went for lunch after our hotel concierge suggested it. They gave us a free glass of champagne as well, which was a nice touch.  We all loved our meals & the place was packed at lunch time even at 1:30 in the afternoon...def make a reservation. I ordered the lunch special and it was awesome! (see pix) It was a caprese sandwich with a pickle and this amazeballs orzo pasta salad A+.  My friend ordered the salmon sandwich and loved it. Would totally go back to this place."
"Good fries, but the location makes it better."
"So this place has been on my radar for a while. I mean look how many reviews they have! Whenever I was in the area and thought about checking it out, we always just picked another place. Now I know this place isn't all hype! We needed a last minute dinner spot right before the ballet and I was able to get a quick reservation on Yelp. We found easy street parking on Wabash a few blocks away and walked over. Parking is always kind of annoying in the loop. I usually do SpotHero but the meter was a cheaper option this time around. We walked in, checked in at the host stand where they offered to take our coats and probably waited 2 minutes before getting seated. We passed on the bread because we know ourselves and didn't want to get stuffed before our meal. Here's what we got:- Drinks- mine was a rum cocktail on their liberations menu. It tasted good and was pretty strong. Boyfriend didn't care for his cider- Scotch Egg- This looks tiny in pictures but is a pretty good portion! It comes on greens as well so is a pretty good protion. This was delicious!- Venison burger- We split it and substituted sweet potato fries instead of regular fries which was good! The burger is huge and we were STUFFED after this meal.Dessert looked and sounded so good plus there were a few other dishes we want to come back for. I was pleasantly surprised that the food was good. Portions are huge so I would say share. Our meal was around ~$50 so not too bad. One thing I didn't love was service was a little slow. She would walk right past us when we were staring at her trying to order or get her attention. I'm assuming she was busy but it was annoying to see her check on other tables and skip others."
Fellow yelpers had turned me onto this place so when I noticed it was next door to where we had dinner reservations how could I pass up the opportunity to check it out for pre-dinner/pre-theater DRAANNKSSS! This place is hopin and defiantly a hot spot. We were lucky to swoop in and get seats and the bar and experience their high-end mixology first hand. Although we personally enjoyed their great wine by the glass selection I did quite enjoy watching them do their thang at the bar. They go a step above with the fresh garnishes I saw them peeling for each and every drink. So although I can't speak for the food I would say this is a place to be for high-end cocktails. So come get you drank on. I'll have to come back to experience the food soon!
"Brunch today was a solid 4 stars overall. The food and environment were both great! We had the shrimp and grits, French toast, Irish breakfast, chilaquiles, banana bread, coffee and cappuccino. Our server Meghan was also great and the manager even stopped by to ensure everything was good. This could have been 5 stars had the greeter/hostest not made a snide remark to us about tapping the snow off our shoes on their entrance rug. I'm sorry, would you rather we track the snow through the restaurant so a patron can slip and fall? Our water refiller was a bit over ambitious. I appreciate the attentiveness but the constant reaching to top off our water glasses anytime we took a sip was a bit much over the course of brunch.We split the check on two cards yet both receipts listed a recommended gratuity based on the total of both. Thankfully we can do simple math but this may catch others off guard."
"Great affordable and sophisticated gastropub with an awesome location: affordable lunches and dinner with fair size portions....I would recommend the caramelized lobster, the creme brûlée, etc. The service is prompt and friendly. The setting is warm and relaxing.You will probably have to park your park at a private parking around here."
"Spent a very nice evening at the Gage. Staff was diligent and attentive, and the food was very good. Tried the bison tartare, very nice.  Lamb chops and duck were very well cooked. Would go again."
"I've come here for brunch and lunch and both times were great.It's a cool place across from Millennium Park on Michigan ave, great location and great lunch spot after a day of doing touristy stuff at Grant Park or Mil Park. Their prime rib sandwich is amazing for lunch. Great spot for a business lunch as well. Lots of options on the menu, and everything is very good."
"Popular gastropub located right across from Millennium Park which makes for a good spot to swing by to start or end your evening with a meal or a few beers. Full service restaurant available, but I opted to sit at the bar & have a few local draft beers. The bar is long & spacious with a nice wood finish staffed by two bartenders on a laid back Saturday night.I think the focus of the drink menu is on wine but there's a fair amount of draft beers, local & imported & an excellent whiskey selection.What really got me interested on the menu here was the house made poutine. Instead of the usual light gravy, the one at Gage uses roasted pork gravy paired with braised pork shoulder, pickled red onions & cheese curds. I think this modern or hipster take on the poutine was every bit as delicious as it sounds & is worth ordering. Deliciousness in every bite.Chill atmosphere, good alcohol selection, I'd recommend a quick visit."
"This place is the bestAmbiance, food, and location is amazing.Usually i can't finish my plate but I had to finish mine and thats how good it was.I am definitely coming again"
"Service is so good! Food is good! Venison Burger is fantastic with very soft, thick and juicy beef and spicy peppers (it's just right not too spicy)!"
"Excellent coffee, great brunch, and nice service. This is a great spot for ""not your typical"" brunch! I would highly recommend it for a Sunday morning!"
"I went to The Gage for the first time today after a visit to the Art Institute. My friend recommended we go to lunch here since she had enjoyed it once before. I am very glad we decided on this place. I really loved the decor of brick walls and white table cloths. The staff was very friendly and enthusiastic. My friend ordered the Gage Burger, and I ordered the Regular Burger. Both we quite delicious and cooked perfectly. I especially enjoyed the fact that my cheese was wonderfully melted! I also loved the fries! I will definitely come back soon and will also recommend the Gage to others."
"AMAZING!!! If I could give this place more stars, I would! Service was above and beyond. Bloody Mary's were amazing. Food was amazing. I even got a little spot on my shirt while we were waiting for the table to be ready, which came out with a little water, and the manager came and brought me a shout out. And then came by our table and even offered to have it dry cleaned if it didn't come out. Great place for brunch, we sat outside on the patio. With the amazing food and exceptional service, this place may just be a regular spot now!!!!"
"I highly recommend the duck.  They have a very nice selection of wine, beer and cocktails.  our party of five was very happy with all their selections.  They would have received five stars if not for the slow server to take orders and deliver drinks.  Once we ordered the food it came out quickly.  The place was jammed but well worth the experience.   The next time I am in town I will drop by for dinner."
"What a little gem! Great wine selection! Loved the ""Leitz Out"" riesling! The scallops over corn grits with peaches & basil was delicious! Still thinking about it!  My friend enjoyed the Amish chicken so much so that when I asked to taste, it was gone! lol Service was on point...friendly & knowledgeable! Mos def will return!"
"Had a great brunch here with a few friends. It's just steps away from the Millennium Park and Cloud Gate (the Bean). We had reservations, but the place was large enough that it seemed we didn't need them. While there were already lots of people there, we were seated quickly in a large booth. For being a solid brunch/lunch restaurant so near lots of tourist attractions, it was a plus not to have to wait in a long line (unlike places such as the bongo room, yolk, etc)Everything we ordered was great. We got the special poutine to share, and it was soooo good. My friend got the eggs benedict I believe, which was tasty but also had a side of baked sliced potatoes with brie. Yum!! A nice change from the typical homefries on the side. I got the poached egg on top of the hash, which was also really good. My other friend got the lobster roll, which I didn't try, but she really liked it. If it weren't the morning, I would've gone for the burger, but oh well, everything we ordered was great.The atmosphere was classy but casual, and our service was also on point. He was attentive and friendly. This place was definitely a pleasant surprise. The prices were also very fair"
This place is great. We really enjoyed the Lobster Roll and Fish and Chips. The burger looks good. Service was great. We ate outside which I recommend if the weather is good.
"Best Restaurant of Chicago Loop, Excellent Food and Better Service! Perfect for different Ages and for Different kinds dates!"
"We came here post museum for a late lunch. Really great atmosphere. Good masculine pub with an upscale feel. My fish and chips came in a nice présentation. Well cooked, very crispy but the meat itself could have used more seasoning. The gage venison burger was the bomb. Never had such a tender burger. Cooked with Woodland muschroom, smoked gouda, fried Jalapeño, picked onions. Simply delicious. Downside: the service felt rushed. You get a sense that all the waiters are thinking about the next people they have to serve. Must be the high turnover. Overall great lunch option if you are in that area."
"I don't think there was a single aspect of my meal which was anything less than superb. From the atmosphere the moment you walk in and sit down, to the last taste of dessert, it's delightful.I started with the Affligem Noel and a Caesar Salad. The Noel is a wonderfully flavored, strong, dark Belgian ale and not one I normally see on tap. The Caesar Salad was fairly standard but truly enormous. Easily split between myself and my gf for a hefty appetizer.She got the scallops, I got the Elk. I want to point out that it's nice that both were sufficient food for dinner while the price points were drastically different. This means the Gage can be everything from a happy hour option to a special event dinner out.The elk was absolutely heavenly, so tender, a double chop. Not the leanest of cuts but the elk flavor was superb and although it says it comes a la carte, the elk actually came with a bit of greens and both chimicurri and hollondaise sauce. Highly recommend it.As we went for a birthday, they provided the peanut butter french silk pie. I hate peanut butter but I ate nearly the whole thing. Holy cow, it was so damn good.Can't wait to go back, try some other menu items."
"Awesome food and service staff.  Recommended by our Absolutely Chicago Segway tour guide, Paul, and was worth the stop.  Food was excellent. I had the lobster roll, hubby had the Dagwood, and the rest had fish & chips.  All were excellent.  Grown kids are picky and serious about their cocktails.  Had the Pimms Cup and they think it's one of the best they've ever had.  Worth the visit."
I think I found my new favorite place.  First of all sat at the bar and the service was great.  Ordered the scallops and some sort of fish wrapped in prosciutto.  Oh lord!!! The scallops were absolutely perfect and the fish was deboned and wrapped.  Their whiskey game is on point! Old fashion probably best around! I woke up the next morning thinking about their food.. Haha. My friend told me their food game is always on point.  Never had a bad meal here.  If your around defiantly recommend stopping in for a bite and drinks!!!
"Absolutely loved both experiences I've had here.The first time I went with two friends. We managed to squeeze in a reservation before the dinner rush. We shared the poutine as an appetizer. I'm not huge on poutine but I liked it and my friends loved it. I ordered the venison burger which was amazing. I was tentative because I wasn't sure I would like venison but the burger set the standard pretty high for any future encounters with venison. The mushrooms added just the right flavor and texture to the burger. By far the best burger I've had in awhile. For dessert, my friend got the chocolate peanut butter layer cake. I usually don't like chocolate cake because the chocolate tends to be too much but this cake managed to not feel too heavy or chocolately and had the right amount of peanut butter flavor as well. The second time I went for lunch with my coworkers. I recommended the burger to them which they all raved about afterwards and I got the cup of soup/half sandwich option with a roasted mushroom sandwich and broccoli soup (soup special of the day) in order to try something different. The soup was extremely creamy but not too filling which I really liked. The sandwich definitely met my expectations and more.  Both times the restaurant was packed but wasn't too noisy. The service was also amazing in being accommodating with reservations (the second time I kept calling with changes to the number of people in the reservation, it ended up being 9) and the food always came out very quickly as well.So glad I was finally able to eat here after hearing so much about it; it definitely lives up to the hype."
Really funny server who helped me decide what to get. The burger was delicious. My friend's lox sandwich with soup was also excellent. The back room we were sitting in was cozy and quieter. I could see it being a great place to escape the Chicago winters.
"I love stopping at The Gage whenever I'm in the area. They have a wide selection of beer, which is always a plus. I have never eaten anything there that I didn't like, which includes the fish & chips, mac 'n cheese, poutine, venison burger, curry fries, and steak. I think the food is reasonably priced and tasty."
"A real classy spot. Great lighting, great mood.The menu was simple, yet I wanted to try everything on it. They managed to turn classic meals into something exotic and new. I opted for their Venison Burger and my friends split the Poutine.We all shared and were pretty blown away. We didn't mind the price because the food actually earned it--unlike a lot of places in the loop where the food is mediocre and you're just paying for the location."
"Ok...so here the thing...I'm vegan.  Not by choice, mind you, but because I have to be.  When I go to a place like The Gage and tell the waiter what I can and can't eat and he tells me ""Oh...our chef will make something great for you...trust me."", I expect something edible.  Here's what I got:- sliced zucchini- cubed beets- steamed bok choi- shoots of asparagus- some other random vegetableThere soooo many things a chef can do with vegan.  Its a sign of experience, creativity, and professionalism.The excuse I got was...it was busy.  That's just ridiculous.Some may say...you shouldnt come to a place like The Gage if you're vegan.  We'll...when you're part of a large crowd, the choice isnt always yours."
"We hosted a prenuptial dinner for 60 in the private dining area downstairs and it could not have been a bigger hit with the future bride and groom along with the guests.  Started with a one hour open bar(downstairs adjacent to the dining area), where the staff also walked around with a preselected number of appetizers, that were amazingly delicious.  A seated dinned with a choice of Halibut or Amish Chicken followed cocktail hour with a desert of Chocolate Caramel Mousse Cake.  The staff followed our timeline to the ""T"" as speeches, toasts and a short video were important parts of the evening.  The A/V set-up is perfect and we all had a blast.Special thanks to Emily Braun, the private events director for not only helping plan for the event, but for being on-site while our event was going on.  A real pro!"
"A trip to Chicago isn't complete without a meal at The Gage. Every year we visit for my birthday and for the holidays we are always treated like we are part of the family. This visit July 13th was no exception. My birthday was the day before and we had reservations, but they had a problem with a fire in the walk in, so they called us. They offered us reservations at their sister property next door. I chose to celebrate the next day for lunch. We arrived and were greeted warmly.  The manager came over and apologized for not being open the night before. Nice touch. We ordered lunch, lobster roll, cold cucumber soup and a Gage burger. Everything as always tastes amazing. They offered me a dessert, but I declined. I was full! Instead of the check, our server smiled and said lunch is on us today. Seriously! That has never happened to me before. I fell in love with the Gage even more. Thank you so much for making my birthday unforgettable. You are all a class act!"
"LOVED the Scotch egg, the Fennel salad (friend said was best salad ever) and my fish.  Will definitely be back.Lots of intimate seating options - series of smaller rooms, various sized boothsA little pricey but considering the location, service, atmosphere, and food quality... worth it."
"My wife and I live in neighborhood and have had decent experiences at this restaurant before, but on 7-27-15, a very unsatisfactory experience.  We ordered a bottle of Jordan Chardonnay, which was our waiter's recommendation as they did not carry the Cakebread Cellars Chardonnay I requested.  Following too long a wait, he returned to report they were out of Jordan priced around $52 and advised the best substitute was ""Big Table"" priced about $120.  That was fairly surprising, but I accepted the recommendation.  My wife ordered the yellow tail snapper, which again was his recommendation.  The fish was delivered to the table 3/4 raw.  No one that looked at the plated fish could have served it.  They apologized, took it back and completely overcooked and dried it out.  When the check was presented, it contained both bottles of wine.  I was irritated and told the waiter that I wasn't some tourist to take advantage of, but before I told him what the problem was, he said, ""Oh, you're probably referring to there being both bottles of wine on the bill"".  That meant it was intentional, unethical and attempted theft.  I will never return to the Gage Restaurant.  The manager, Michael did attempt to describe it as an honest mistake and offered complementary drinks if I'd return.  JMS"
Came in around lunch time. Spot is ideal as its in the middle of everything that's going on in the city. Staff was 4/5 as they are a little strange at times. The decoration of the place is really nice. It looks like a London train station. Food was pretty good and so was the price. Would go back.
"Wow, what a hot, lively and happening place towards the south end of Michigan Avenue in Chicago.  Our group hit The Gage right after spending a full day at the ASCO conference so we were ready to kick back, enjoy some wine and have a great meal.  We arrived at 5:15pm and the restaurant was already packed solid with the Saturday night crowd.  The bar area was full of friends gathering together as well as single people dining alone.  We found everyone friendly as a colleague and I started chatting it up with many of the locals.  Our party of 6 then got seated at a lovely table in the middle of the dining room.  We started with their charcuterie board which came highly recommended, that included fondue, flavorful house sausage, zucchini, toast and incredibly tangy pickles which unique taste was like nothing I've had before.  For my entree, I chose the pan-seared pekin duck breast soaked in red miso au jus, accompanied by the most original tasting rice cakes that had a pickled pineapple taste.  Sounds a little weird but it was delicious!  My colleagues all went with the Alaskan Halibut which they raved about.  I really liked this place.  Not only did I love my meal but our waiter was helpful, friendly and excellent.  Lastly, with their cool atmosphere and vibe, The Gage does ""trendy"" and ""hip"" just right."
"This is more of a 3.5 than a 3. I wanted to go to Wildberry for brunch on Sunday but I didn't feel like waiting an hour for a table. Thanks, but no thanks. So instead, I managed to squeeze in a 1:30 reservation at the Gage!We ordered the venison burger (I couldn't tell that it was venison since it was mixed with some ground pork. So instead of a gamey flavor, it tasted like a regular burger), Gage burger (huge patty!), mussels (good flavor). So why not 4 stars? The food was good, but I don't see myself coming back for more. Service was good! Food took a bit longer than I thought it should, but it was okay."
"Ultra hip and trendy situated in a fabulous location right on Michigan Avenue overlooking the beautiful and very cool Millenium Park. Both times I stopped in (the first, just to look around, and the next night for dinner, it was packed with folks meeting for drinks or having dinner (and was LOUD), but a happy kind of loud.So many things looked good - the pork porterhouse, roasted rack of elk and whole Idaho rainbow trout, but they seemed a little heavy, and pricey - $30-45. So, I opted for the Gage venison burger, topped w/ smoked Gouda, fried jalapeños, mushrooms, pickled onions and mustard aioli on a super soft bun - it was amazing - every part of it. Even the pickle spear on the side was so much better than the average pickle.For $4 more, I substituted the fries for the fire roasted mini Shishito peppers, topped w/ cilantro, toasted sesame and dynamite sauce - incredible w/ a tangy kick, and so unique! I could eat these like popcorn every day. Both were very generous portions - definitely enough to share if you're inclined. Tried the Paloma craft cocktail, and it was excellent, too - very fresh and refreshing. Don't let the crowd turn you off, it's worth it!"
"Was here last night on the evening of the St Patrick's Day parade and river dyeing so the entire place was partying. They had a guy on the bagpipes and another one just killing an Irish flute right near the front when you walk in. My uncle was in town on a layover so we decided to have some food and beers. We each had the beet salad which was amazing, but my favorite part was the bite of my boyfriends venison burger. I would like to go back and try the bison tartare... May do that today. They had some good local beers on tap and a pretty big bottle list also. They also had some special St Paddys day cocktails that looked pretty tasty. I'm not sure if I would've liked this place as much if it hadn't been st Patrick's day, but I guess I'll have to go back and see!"
Superb. Sunday brunch. You can make reservations on opentable through yelp. Irish breakfast and chilaquiles hit the spot. Happy camper here. My companion had a Bloody Mary and it was delicious!
Atmosphere was elegant. Customer service was great. We ordered mussels for appetizer. It was yummy and interesting flavor. I ordered fish and chips for dinner. It was alright. My bf ordered the original hamburger. It was good.
"Wasn't expecting to indulge my lobster roll fetish in Chicago...The Gage was a pleasant surprise. It also occupies a part of town a little short on good restaurants.Great ambience (comfortable seats, not too loud) and great service. Pretty classy place.The lobster roll was good. Not sure why there were onion strings on it...I just picked them off. Also had a side of green beans - they were actually really good."
"Love there meat dishes, totally worth it. Menu is ever changing so when business takes me to Chicago I have to stop here. Went with some seafood this time around for a change. Scallops were OK, should have went with the steak :)"
"Completely hit the spot. Had the Cinnamon Raisin bread French toast, which was killer. Really enjoyed the Spanish coffee. Stayed long enough for a beer & the 1/2 soup chorizo & half sandwich mushroom. Both also killer. That mushroom sandwich was super tasty. Great service. Very friendly/courteous staff. We had been hitting up this awful pub near our hotel that treated us like crap & served slop. The Gage saved us. Thanks for a real good time!"
"I've been here 3 times since moving to Chicago and I have been very pleased each time.  The menu is really diverse so its fun to explore.  Their burger is fabulous but the Salmon BLT tops my list and the mussels are a close second.  Great selection of wines by the glass. Worthy craft beer selections and I love that they have proper glassware for them.  Service is good.  I usually sit at the bar and the bartenders are all very friendly and attentive.  If you are visiting Chicago and going to The Art Institute, this is a great place to grab a late lunch."
"Super romantic, extremely classy, intimate restaurant located right across from Millenium Park on Michigan Ave. We went there for dinner before walking to see a show at the Bank of America Theatre, had a glass of scotch with the Scotch Egg (only makes sense right?) to start, then had the Gage Venison Burger while my boyfriend had the Peking Duck Confit. Both were seriously delicious. I was afraid my burger would be too ""gamey"" and weird after trying other restaurants' versions of deer, but this one was really just outstanding. Moist but not too moist, flavorful but not salty, and with the perfect amount of mushroom and onion with fries on the well-done side, which is my favorite kind. Definitely a must-try for that perfect date for you've been saving up for :)"
"I went in on a Sunday.  The Gage is located across the street from Millennium Park & the Cloud Gate aka Chicago Bean. The staff was beyond attentive. You would have thought I was the only person there but they were booked up. I started with the Anne's Spanish Coffee & had the bellini with nectar on the side with my Gage Venison Burger ...which was to die for. I ordered a side of their Applewood Smoked Bacon for my burger,  which it didn't need but it definitively upped the flavor profile. For dessert I tried the hot cider cocktail, equally delicious. I'd definitely eat here again."
"I had the best burger of my life here, so that alone is worth 5 stars. It's made with venison and comes with Smoked Gouda, Fried Jalapeños, Woodland Mushrooms, Pickled Onions, Mustard Aioli. The side of fries was also delicious - each one was perfectly crispy with the right amount of salt. They gave me a side of curry gravy for dipping, but the fries could stand on their own.Yum! I sent 2 of my coworkers there and they also raved about the venison burger.This spot is quite busy (even when we showed up at 5pm), seating is ""cozy"" but service is lovely and I will definitely be back."
"Those biggied-up, juicy, buttery plump scallops and tall, glass of crisp Cantina del Taburno Falanghina del Sannio were so satiating that EYE left my server a mint on top of the bill after paying... as a treat for helping me have a wonderful lunch, not a hint or anything. :oThe small, crunchy onion rings, bits of pink grapefruit were just the right touch along with excellent Boston lettuce.I was resigned to have a salad for lunch and dammit, this counts! :)At least I didn't order seconds, as I was quite tempted to do.And by the way, what is that wonderful hand soap that's dispensed in the men's room? 0_0"
"Went here for my birthday dinner this year. The manager came over, was great, and brought us 4 glasses of champagne. It was actually really good champagne, not something cheap places give out for free. You would never expect this place to be so amazing because it is in a tourist location, but my mom always finds the best places. It's good quality food but the atmosphere is casual and not stuffy. Definitely recommend this place. Super busy too when I went."
We sat at the bar & only had drinks. Very well made cocktails! Great atmosphere & décor.
The venison burger is fantastic! I had a taste of the mushroom sandwich which was equally compelling. Great atmosphere near the front of the restaurant where there's natural light and a view of the park across the street.
"This place is everything it is hyped up to be! I Recommend making reservations even for lunch...if not the you will be waiting until past lunch time. ;-) Appetizer recommendation: House Poutine...talk about some fancy fries! The soup of the day was a mushroom with brisket so I decided on the half sandwich and half soup. Good thing I did the soup was amazing! The buffalo chicken sandwich was also great. A bit small but hey it was a half sandwich. What I was really impressed was with the ""thanksgiving-type"" turkey sandwich that came with gravy on the side. Not your typical sandwiches...much better. Exactly, what I expected.Overall Service was great. Drinks were good too (yum Bloody Mary!). . Loved the bathrooms (haha)...especially the great smelling soap!"
"The most PHENOMENAL VENISON burger I've ever had in my LIFE!  We aren't talking super thing $18 pattie, this bad boy is the size of your standard burger and worth every penny! This thing is beyond flavorful all by itself. The mushrooms, onions and smoked Gouda are simply complimentary to this juicy very natural tasting burger. I'm so in love. Jennifer was an absolute delight! All of the servers including the managers were over the top friendly and extremely helpful.  The bar was a little loud as expected, but the atmosphere and the ambiance were delightful. Extremely close in proximity to the tourists traps so the prices are expected. Really appreciative of the gourmet spot amongst corporate chain garbage. MUST STOP! The melbec went brilliantly with the burger. I never thought I'd be so thankful for having missed my connection flight and wound up with An 8 hour layover in Chicago. Very easy and painless commute from the airport via train (Orange line) and walking distance from the station! Warm, happy thoughts!"
"Showed up one morning for brunch. Had a tomato soup, which was good but a little saltier than it should have been.  My friend recommended the Gage Venison Burger, but I was a fool and got the lobster roll, which was underwhelming. There was nothing particularly wrong with it, it just wasn't very good, strictly speaking. The roll wasn't cut open enough, so it was difficult to eat, like a half-filled sandwich. It was accompanied by kettle cooked chips on the side, which I didn't bother with. (I don't think that was an appropriate side.)The atmosphere was fine. I think my opinion of this place could be significantly higher (i.e. I might give four stars) if I had gotten one of the burgers instead."
Great cheeseburgers and a fun atmosphere!!
"We had lunch at The Gage last week while visiting Chicago.  We walked off of Michigan Ave wanting to get out of the chilly air and have lunch.  My wife and our friends all had sandwiches (some added soups).  I was looking forward to The Dagwood, and it was a huge sandwich, and very tasty.  My only gripe is that ALL of the ingredients were NOT listed on the menu.  So, I had to sit there and pick off the onions and olives and wound up destroying my sandwich in the process.  Overall, we enjoyed the meal!"
"Visited a couple of times over the last 6 months. Both times a fantastic experience.  One dinner, one breakfast. If you don't see something on the menu, simply ask. I enjoy visiting restaurants that don't specifically cater to VEG/GF people and seeing how creative they can be:)  The Gage is very creative and tasty.  Had two perfectly cooked over-hard eggs (thank goodness I'm not also vegan:)  and some house potatoes.  The french fries are insane and a huge miss if you don't try them.  Almost forgot that I also ordered fries with my eggs, yep, they're that good.  Bloody Mary's from beyond! I will definitely be back.  Keep the fryer on high!!!!"
"Dropped by for lunch and ordered the salmon tataki. Don't let the small size fool you; at first it looked like one of those items that was all about looks, but there was quite a bit of fish underneath all the decoration as well. The whole thing was quite the confection, with layer and layer of delicious salmon beneath the vegetables. The whole green sauce on the bottom went well with it too. My colleagues ordered the ravioli and the sandwich+soup, all of which were very recommendable as well."
"Had lunch here last week. Service was great, and the chilean sea  bass with bok choy, carrots, miso broth and rice was delicious--- but nothing new or special. We ordered the poutine as a starter, and gobbled it up, so I was pretty stuffed by the time the sea bass came. My colleague got the scallop salad, and that was decent too!I had to order dessert, so we ordered the peanut butter chocolate silk pie--- much more peanut butter than chocolate to it--- very smooth and creamy, which is always good in my mind! I think this is a great place for a business lunch. I think I just expected more from all the rave reviews."
"Went here for lunch and sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice and I never waited for anything. It has a nice beer selection!!! I had the pork poutine, it was really good but could have had more cheese curds... It was a huge portion, enough to fill up 2 people!!"
"Liked: Fried pickles were the best we ever had. Venison burger was exceptional. Fish and chips were very good. Bison tartar was wonderful. Heirloom carrots nicely done. Malbec at $16/glass was probably overpriced, but was a nice glass of red wine.Disliked: Noise level was at a fever pitch, hard to hear the person directly across the table speaking. Had to wait 30 minutes to get our table after arriving on time at 630PM and making a reservation weeks in advance.  House smoked trout just ok. No consideration for birthday celebration, not even a Happy Birthday wish.Verdict: The Gage is a hugely popular restaurant. Our experience was a mixed bag, overall positive, but in some ways disappointing. Price up there but expected in the Windy City. Hovering between 3-4 stars, will give them the higher rating based on the fried pickles."
"I came here for no particular reason - just wanted to treat myself to a nice meal and stumbled across the Gage. I wasn't too hungry for some reason, so probably didn't enjoy the meal as much as I could have. We tried:1. House poutine: meh. I feel like poutine isn't meant to be high end, and something about this poutine was off - the flavors were too ""gentle"" (for lack of a better word) and it was WAY too oily. 2. Seared Sea Scallops with Korean ""BBQ"" Short Rib and kimchi: interesting spin on the dish. Scallops are one of my all time favorite foods, and I ALWAYS get them whenever they're on the menu (read: I've tried too many scallop dishes for my own good over the past several years). This was a unique preparation - the ""korean bbq"" (I'm korean and no, this was not anything like LA galbi) was still flavorful and the kimchi added a nice flavor profile as well. The scallops had a beautiful sear and came out medium rare. 3. Fish and chips: I tried my friend's order, and it was great. The flavors of the fish really came through, which is rare since it's battered and fried. I also liked the presentation of the fish (came out in ""newspaper"" wrapping).The complimentary bread starter and the Riesling I ordered were both great as well. Service was attentive but not intrusive.The Gage isn't particularly creative with their menu, but for what it is, food definitely of quality. Solid 4 stars."
"We came here for lunch after spending some time wandering around Millennium Park. The restaurant looks quaint from the outside, but once you walk in it just keeps going and going and going. The first thing you see is the bar with a pretty impressive list of microbrews and craft beer on tap. They don't have a gluten free menu, but the servers are very knowledgeable and can help guide you in terms of modifications to the menu. They did confirm that they fry the fries in a dedicated fryer so that's a nice treat for anyone avoiding gluten. No gluten free bread though. The PBR battered fried pickles were very good, but even tasted better when you saved a few to put on your burger. The half soup half sandwich was a popular combo at our table and the servings are quite large even for lunch."
"Did you know that The Gage will let you call in orders and pick them up at the bar? Did you know that this includes that delicious poutine that they offer?Since finding this out in late December, I now have to keep myself from ordering a poutine to go (and eat back at my desk) more than once a week. I'm now that weird person that orders the exact same thing on a weekly basis. Soon, the staff will recognize me.And you know what? I don't even care. It's too delicious.The rest of their menu is fab and I sometimes wish that I could justify drinking during the workday as I stand at the bar, waiting for my order, checking out the beer list. Sigh.Before discovering this carry out option, I would have rated it four starts due to being so damned popular/busy/noisy at lunch."
"I had the absolute best piece of meat here. I ordered the 14oz prime rib steak which came with a side of truffle fries and I enjoyed every last bite. Usually when you start a meal, the food tastes great until you start reaching the point of being full. Not the case with this meal, I enjoyed it till the end. Ordered a glass of Cabernet to go with my dinner and my total with tip came out to about $80. Ouch. I've never spent that much for one meal but it was totally worth it. My brave friend ordered their elk and enjoyed that too. Would definitely come back here again when I revisit Chicago."
"5 stars all the way around! I was a little overwhelmed at all of the unfamiliar dining options in the Chicago area until I found this gem. Every upscale restaurant in the city seemed to include strange science experiments and concoctions of animal organs. I came to Chicago to see my favorite musician play, so I wanted to start the evening off with an equally exceptional meal; The Gage did not disappoint.Let me start by saying that I had what is possibly the best and most beautifully crafted cocktail of my life here. It was an old-style rum drink with lime and mint. It was incredibly simple, yet elegant, and it went down very easy. My SO and I decided to have the poutine to start, which was fabulous. They do not skimp on the cheese curds here...that's for sure. I had the chili-rubbed pork, while my date had the duck. Both dishes were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I was incredibly jealous of his corn succotash, and I kept stealing bites when he wasn't looking. For the dessert, we had this delicious corn cake with fresh blueberries and sweet corn ice cream. We finished the dessert in about 60 seconds flat, and the waiter actually came back and said he'd never seen a dessert go so fast! It was just that good.The service was fast and attentive. We were never left without full glasses of water, nor were we left sitting with plates and crumbs on the table. Kudos to The Gage for a terrific start to a night out!"
"I really liked all of the food dishes, the poutine especially was fabulous and filling--I have had it a couple times here.the mussels and fish we have had in the past also very good.I would have wished the server to stop by more often--the problem is, it is SO LOUD in this pub that getting someone's attention can be hard.It is a fun place to eat but very spendy even for a gastropub.Good drinks."
I went here with my husband and his best friend on a Saturday in the middle of the afternoon. We went because my husband best friend haven't eaten yet and he recommend it. We all share a bowl of mussels and it was so delicious with the crostini bread. The waiter was really attentive in making sure we were enjoying our food. I will come back here to try the dinner and brunch menu. This place is nice to go out on a date night or an anniversary night. It's funny with this place because I pass by it so many times and always want to try it and I am glad I did. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.
"The Gage has a lot going for it.It's near the Art Institute and is quick- making it a viable spot for lunch.The place is pretty and the service is good.They have a good beer list and the waiter knows something about the beer.The problem is the food.The food is not bad and in some senses quite good.Yet, it's kind of weird.I had a rare venison burger.It was quite good but it had too much stuff on it and that destroyed the roll.Look I don't want a dry burger but this was bit too much.I believe it came with very good fries.My wife had shrimp and grits and it's not so much that it was bad as it was ill conceived.This is  not a dish for shrimp in the shell.There were not enough grits and black beans don't belong in shrimp and grits.Food wise the problem with the Grange is they over do it .Too many things go into the dishes , too much fuss! I suspect you can get a very good meal here but you may have to know what you are doing.I liked this place and would go back but they need to chill out with the imaginative presentations and get a little more restrained- a less is more philosophy."
"This place is large with a decent outdoor seating space given the location. We had reservations and were seated promptly, outside, on a nice summer night.The food was honestly excellent. We had the Scotch egg, the mussels with a Vindaloo sauce (note: I'm indian and this was darn good), and all 3 of us ordered their famous burger. The burger is reaaaaaallllllly good. I couldn't finish it but I would've if I had the space. If you're in the area, I recommend having a meal here. I would come back for the burger. Yum!"
"Gage is a cozy brunch spot directly across from Millennium Park. Prices were reasonable considering the location, ambiance, and quality. The crab cake had a decent amount of crab with a light and tasty sauce. The corned beef hash had nice evenly distributed chunks of corned beef and it was just the right amount of saltiness. CHESAPEAKE BAY CRAB CAKE House Chorizo, Fried Egg, Saffron Beurre BlancHOUSE MADE CORNED BEEF HASH Poached Eggs, Hollandaise"
Great surprise. We went here after being unable to get into the wild berry pancake place and so glad we did. The menu options wee great and the drinks even better. We had a special for brunch sautéed spinach with pork belly and poached eggs piled high  the scotch egg was also a nice treat crispy and tasty she'll with a perfectly cooked egg inside with a little mustard that I think was infused with a little horse radish. We finished off with the creme puffs and had to waddle out. Bloody Mary was done to perfection and garnished perfectly. Oh and the staff were amazing.
"Amazing food, great service, great ambiance. This is one of Chicago's best places to go out!"
"Restaurant week dinner review. $44 fixe prix.We've only grabbed a burger and sweet potato fries here in the past, and they certainly didn't need more reviews on that. We are warning you off last night's tiny tasting plate serving of Bouillabaisse. Go for the Beef Rib.Smoked ArcticChar tartare, intg, frisee/watercress, avocado smear, ricechips.Roasted Garlic Sausage Wellington, tasty, chipotle mustard, spinach.Slow braised Beef rib, NICE size portion, not particularly flavorful no hint of how it was seasoned, very tender, way underseasoned, diced sweetpotatoes, kale.Bouillabaisse. Disappointing tasting size. 2 tiny mussels, one halved medium prawn, 1 piece 2.5 ounce firm white fish overcooked, 1/3 cup broth, 3 small fingerling potatoes halved, boiled fennel, one quartered aoli seasoned toasted crostini, Only my partner's Beef Rib shares kept me from starving.Ice cream sandwich. Cloying sweet. Impossible to taste anything but sugar and more caramelized sugar. NO idea what flavor the ice cream might have been, paralyzingly sweet. NO dipping sauce, MORE chopped caramelized sugar on top, yikes.I would recommend the Spare rib but do NOT recommend the Bouillabaisse unless you look your server in the eye and ask them if the Bouillabaisse serving is VERY small, and if it is- it is NOT that great. Not particularly rich or flavorful, mussels so tiny I would be embarrassed to serve them and the 4 whitefish bites were overcooked, and it was probably 1/4 cup of broth really, maybe the server dropped it on the way?  If you need TWO of those ice cream sandwiches as a couple, YOU like sugar. We liked both appetizers. They MAY adjust this of course as it was the first day, I would hope so. If that was monkfish, as listed, it was unrecognizable. We shouldn't be that hungry and underwhelmed after a $150 dinner with 2 glasses of wine and tip. Service was attentive as always, Loud as always. A-OK. Good luck."
"This place was on pace for a solid 4, maybe 5 stars until they changed the television from  a Blackhawks playoff game to Golden State/Houston basketball. We had asked for tables near the bar to watch the game, but whoever is in charge of the TV decided to change it mid-playoff game without regard for the patrons. As annoying as it was to have to settle our tab and go somewhere else for the remainder of the game, our server was great, the food was very good and the drink selection was above average. I recommend this place for food and drinks, but do not go here if you want to enjoy televised sports."
"Great food and great service; can't ask for more!The venison burger is AMAZING. My husband and I went there for our anniversary dinner. We started with the smoked trout appetizer, which was good [could have used another crouton or so] with great flavor. Then I had the braised rabbit salad which was wonderful with a light dressing. My husband got the venison burger and truffle fries and it was delightful. The burger is mixed with beef fat and was cooked perfectly. The patty was large too,  not too large but enough where you tasted the meat within the butter [brioche] and fried jalapenos. My husband is pretty critical of eating out and he admits that it was quite good.Service was great as well. There appear to be two GMs constantly checking on everyone. We sat outside and they were very attentive with the heat lamps and making sure that we were not cold. The waiter was wonderful also: kind, attentive, and had answers to any questions that we had.I have always enjoyed this place and suggest anyone to visit for good food and a wonderful setting."
"I adore The Gage. I have dined here many times and planned two private events for my job.  Their catering staff is top notch and private room is absolutely wonderful.Poutine?  Hello and yes!  They even have jalapenos on the poutine.  Fish and chips?  Totally legit! Chared green beans?  OMG!  Scotch egg?  Hell Yeah! If you have picky eaters trust me, they will find something they like on the menu. My hubs loves their burgers and you will too.  They have salad too but why bother!  LOLService is top notch.  You can't beat the location.And, as an event planner I appreciate their personal level of service.  They answered every question I had (and I have a lot, I'm alway paranoid about my events!)Go there and thank me later for recommending The Gage.  Looooove iiiiitttt!The Gage"
"I took my parents to the Gage before going to a show at the Bank of America theater, and we were very happy with it! The food was great, lovely ambiance and the waiter was super helpful (along with one of the managers who came over once or twice to address a room temperature water request -- long story, but suffice it to say he was extremely accommodating).My dad loves duck so he orders it whenever it's on the menu, and he reported that this was one of his favorite ducks he has ever eaten (which is, I think, a huge deal coming from him). My halibut special was delicious. My mom really enjoyed her fish and chips (although I'm not sure how you can ever really go wrong with that). We also enjoyed a few sides: mashed potatoes, green beans, carrots, which were all great for sharing. Would definitely come again, especially if I'm looking for a nicer dinner before a show."
"Overall: Delicious. The appetizer-figs and cheese dish was underwhelming. The halibut, the Amish chicken, and the sides were VERY good. They must have a great chef. Owner came by to greet our table. Very nice place for dinner and cocktails."
"Came here on St Patts day - a wee bit hungover (and not all at amused by the loads of drunk 18 years coated in green glitter I had to share a train car with on the way over).  I was meeting a girlfriend for what we jokingly referred to as an ""adult"" lunch as the masses were in the streets day drinking since 9AM.  To my initial displeasure, the bar was in full on St Patricks day mode with tons of day drinkers at the bar, green everything, and bag pipers (aren't those Scottish?) piping.  Thankfully we were seated at a table away from the bar (and good we made reservations, as it was packed).Onto the good stuff: great service.  The wait staff worked flawlessly to take care of our every need, despite the restaurant being extremely busy.  We ordered the roasted woodland mushroom sandwich and the fish and chips to split.  Both were fantastic - I especially loved the mushroom sandwich (the truffle aioli and umami from the mushrooms made all remnants of my headache go out the window and made my tastebuds sing in happiness - although the gin Martinez might have helped with that as well).For dessert (because dessert after lunch is a necessity) we split the special Irish chocolate cake they had for their St Patts menu. So so sooooo good. I will definitely be returning to the Gage again, probably for dinner next time.  Highly recommended."
"After hearing all the reviews, I finally decided to try it.  Local beer was a great start to the menu along with very unique items like Chicken Sausage.  I dived into the venson burger, which hit the spot.  They serve breakfast, lunch and Dinner but it seems a perfect place in the loop to  to hang out with friends after work or before a concert."
the drinks are fantastic. i'm from dc so i get paying top dollar for drinks but don't go here unless you're ready to spend 12-15 each on drinks. my bf thought the bartenders were hot and i think that they help out regulars. we didn't end up getting food but the drinks were totally delicious. the service was great and i would go back. i just wouldn't go there if you're not looking for craft cocktails. be prepared to wait and fight for a seat.
"Terrific gastropub in tourist-land. Somehow, it's not at all touristy.We walked right past the unobtrusive entrance. The design inside is all wood/tile/pressed tin. Which is to say: You know you're in a bar, but it's a really, really gorgeous bar. Comfortable, too, and not too noisy, with the tables set a reasonable distance apart.It goes without saying that the choices of craft beers are first-rate. The cocktail list looks fine, but I can recommend the scotch flights, if that's your thing. You won't be disappointed. I stuck with the (greaseless) fish and chips, but there are many more sophisticated menu offerings. The portions are vast.Let the professional and easy-going staff guide you, for both food and drink. Our waiter knew the answer to every question, and every recommendation was spot-on. This is not a romantic kind of place, but, boy, am I ever in love."
"Really love The Gage - the atmosphere of the restaurant is like an old American bar with leather seats and gold-frames on the mirrors. But then, there are touches of modern everywhere with tv screens at the corner showing sports.Our waiter was lovely - attentive as can be and check up on us like every 15 minutes. While some may find this annoying, I loved it because you never know when you really do need something, and the waiter doesn't come to your table for another 30 minutes (excuse the run-on sentence!)My fiancé and I were there for brunch, but they have a brunch menu and lunch menu. Our waiter let us know the most delicious items from each. We had the Scotch Egg (YUMMMM - Imagine chicken nuggets with an egg inside). I had the Tomato Salad with Chicken and we also shared a burger which came with freshly fried fries. Our waiter upsold us on a Curry Sauce and oh my goodness, best combo ever.The Gage is quite hidden and we didn't even notice it until we found out it was the closest ""pub"" to where we were. Across from The Bean, the location couldn't be more touristy, and yet, the place was perfectly busy; not bumper to bumper I cant-hear-myself-speak but neither crickets-empty.Food is American but it's perfect grub. Lots of great local beers on draft and I had one right from Chicago. Would come back here if in the area!"
"My friend was visiting from Kentucky and I wanted to show him a great Chicago restaurant. We went to the Gage and had the most wonderful time! We had George as our waiter and he was THE BEST! He was knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks. We were a little overzealous with our ordering and instead of having us over-order, he suggested we only order a few items. It was the perfect amount! The food was incredible and the drinks were spot on. We had coffee at the end of the meal and it was great too. I 100% recommend this place, you should definitely go AND ask for George!"
"Deliciously innovative and fresh eats here at the Gage, walking distance for tourists like me who had Millennium Park on their list of Chicago landmarks... this gastropub is definitely another place for the list!Known for their fish and chips I decided to skip and try their other fare:This place had some of the most delicious LAMB RIBS I have ever had. So delectable you will leave wanting to lick the sauce off the bone. Make sure you don't forget the lemon for a little extra contrast. :) The soup of the day was an innovative cucumber and watermelon soup - very refreshing and topped off with some greek yogurt and fresh herbs. It was a bit overcast that day but it was perfect to beat the humidity of the area.Service was great and for the amount of food and quality, the prices are high but reasonable. Moral of the story: get to those ribs, they are delicious."
We had the venison burger and the special veggie sandwich both were very good highly recommended also had a grapefruit beer that was very refreshing. The service was excellent.
"Holy Gastropub, Michgan Avenue! Had a double-date here before waiting in line to ice skate at the new rink for about 19876 hours, and I have to say, I'm glad we had full bellies and warm hearts going in to that experience. First off, I called originally and they didn't have any open reservations for the time we wanted, so I told them food was my thing and that they had the goods I wanted; with a little easing and boosting of my Intsagram account, they were able to fit us in. Start with the Scotch Egg, which is savory, filling, and just enough to carry you into something even more delightful, like their duck confit. Poutine is another great option. My companions also enjoyed their drinks, but you'd have to ask them for specific advice on that department because I stuck with an iced tea. The waitress was a little monotone and disinterested, but was still helpful and accommodating."
"The service at The Gage is almost always impeccable. I appreciate the owner, who walks around often and checks in on his guests. The food is always great anytime of the day. If you like bloody mary's (with Guiness), this is the place to get them!"
This place is utterly amazing! I actually think that I will leave Chicago addicted to the Duck Poutine and Venison Burger. Both were extremely filling and have to rank among the best food that I have had in recent memory. The service was also great and they had an excellent beer selection. I will make it a point to head back here the next time that I am in Chicago.
"The Gage is delicious!  However, what really made our meal fantastic was Dudie, our waiter/entertainer extraordinaire!We came to the Gage in early May when my cousin was in town celebrating her birthday.  She was extremely indecisive and Dudie made our lunch the most fun part of the whole weekend.  He surprised her with her meal and drinks and it was delicious.  The food and drinks were superb!  We loved the whole experience!"
This place is one of the most amazing places to eat and enjoy in Chicago!Since this original review we've eaten here almost every time we are in Chicago for brunch lunch or dinner and it is CONSISTENTLY fantastic!
"I've wanted to eat at the Gage forever now, but hadn't had the chance to go.  That quickly changed and now, I've been twice in a relatively short timespan.My first trip was in April on my birthday for lunch.  Our reservation was for 2:00 PM so the restaurant was fairly quiet.  I enjoyed the ambiance a lot since I was able to converse with my fiancé without having to deal with the lunch crowd.We started with the scotch egg appetizer ($8), which is a hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat and coated in bread crumbs.  The egg was cooked to perfection and the bread crumbs gave it a nice little crunch.  It was served with mustard, which gave it a nice little kick.  A side salad also accompanied the egg.  The salad was dressed well and tasted very fresh.For our entree, we split the fish & chips ($15).  I was completely blown away by how awesome they tasted.  The fish, fried to perfection, was tender, flaky and melts into your mouth once you take a bite.  They are served wrapped in newspaper atop a generous bed of fries.  Dipping the fish in the homemade tartar sauce only made it taste even better.For drinks, they have a great selection of bottled beers and beers on tap.  I tried the Dark Horse Raspberry Ale, which had just the right amount of fruity flavors without being too sweet.  My fiancé had some Japanese scotch, which he enjoyed.The service was spot on.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly, but not overly so.  We were given new silverware between our appetizer and entree.  Also, our water glasses were constantly refilled.  Ambiance wise, the dark wood seating gives the restaurant a classy vibe, but it has a nice homey casual element to it too.  You don't have to be super dressed up to dine here.For my second trip, I had a business lunch around 12:30.  Again, I had the fish & chips and they impressed me as much as they did the first time around.  Service was spot on like the first time.Oh, and I definitely recommend stopping by the bathroom before you leave (even if you don't have to go).  They offer a hand & body lotion that smells absolutely delicious.  I failed to stop by after my second visit.  I really wanted to get the brand name so I can buy some for home.  I even dreamt about the bathroom a few days after my first visit.  That's how awesome it is.  I'm not kidding.  Definitely check it out.Overall, an excellent lunch spot in the Loop.  Get the fish & chips and make sure to stop by the bathroom before you leave."
"I've been here a number of times now and most recently with my boss for a celebratory lunch.  Service was great.  He loved his meal.  I loved mine.  This is just one of those perfect Chicago restaurants that is always reliable in an always comfortable, high end setting.  It's my favorite place to recommend because it's not over the moon expensive but it still feels like you're getting a little extra special attention.Get the smoked salmon sandwich and the bone marrow."
"The Gage is definitely a solid choice by the Loop, in Chicago. Expect pub-like food or classic American food.We went for brunch and got the crabcake and the Venison burger-  both were delicious! Prices were fair and competitive for brunch in the city ($16-$20 per entree) and the service was solid - they came by many times to check on us.We made reservations and requested to be sat outside which they gladly accommodated during busy hours.I'd recommend it for brunch or lunch food. The inside also has a great bar area with high-top tables as well. Inside in the far end of the dining room sit more elegant tables with tablecloths - better ambiance for a dinner setting."
"++++- You can't leave without trying the venison burger- Save whatever else you were going to try, for your next visit- It is filling, but nonengorging+++- Fish and chips was good, but the venison is better++- Bartenders are talented- French 75 (Hennessy/Prosecco) was good and one mix that tastes better than it sounds- Lots of TVs, goo for watching games-- This place has a high turnover, we felt sort of rushed outTIPS:- Don't forget to ask for wifi password"
"My night was almost ruined after having watered down, ratchet Old Fashioneds at a work party. I know better than to ask for fancy drinks in those types of situations, but the bartenders had bitters and mixers so I can't help myself!Coworkers and I came here to mingle more afterward and you bet I ordered an Old Fashioned! This was was strong and perfectly concocted. Somone in the group ordered a bunch of apps and told us to try some. Trying the fried pickles was my second mistake of the night because I couldn't stop putting them in my mouth! Thanks to the coworker who bought them, but sorry for devouring most of it!The drink was so strong that I accidentally dipped fries in a cup of creamy tomato soup. Whoops! I mean it was 9:30pm and kind of an odd time for soup, plus no one was eating it....This place was super packed on a Thursday night, but that could have been due to numerous places having holiday after parties. The menu looks amazing so I need to come here for dinner soon! I'll order my own bowl of pickles this time. :)"
"great atmosphere, service, and of course delicious food! The Gage is one of our favorite places to eat in the city! We go there for many special occasions or to meet our out of town friends! It is the best Irish gastropub we've been to!"
Venison Burger!
"I came here for an early lunch (11:30AM) during Restaurant Week with my co-workers.Restaurant Week Food-We had two options for the first & second courses and then the dessert was the same for everyone.First - ""Winter Greens:"" salad with blood orange, pistachio, and raita dressing.  The mixture of the ingredients tasted perfect together--delicious!! The portion was just enough so you're not too full for the 2nd course.Second - ""Roasted Arctic Char:"" Fennel, Saffron, Smoked Lobster Brodo.  I enjoyed it, but one of my co-workers didn't like the texture of the Char as much because it was semi-raw (kind of like medium rare cook meat, but it was fish).  Soft and flavorful and perfect portions as well!Dessert - ""Chocolate Chip Cookie Sandwich with Espresso Ice Cream in the middle.  This is deliciously sweet, VERY SWEET!! It's good, but I definitely couldn't finish this--two giant cookies (they're not hard cookies, but not extremely soft either) and felt like 2 scoops of delcious espresso ice cream--I loved the ice cream, but that's only because I love coffee.  Overall, a great end to the meal!Customer Service - good, they waiters were attentive and fast at clearing the plates.  No complaints!Atmosphere - dim lighting, semi-roomy--good for group mealsCosts - $22 for Restaurant week 3 course meal--I think it's around $10-$15 (?) for entrees on their regular menu.Parking - it is the city so I would recommend taking public transportation--perfect location when it's warmer outside because it's right by Millennium Park!I would come here again to try some of their other menu items during a non-restaurant week."
"Best brunch I've ever had. A little strange they pack you in very tight, so get there early or expect to be a little smooshed ;) delicious, delicious eggs, and excellent mimosas."
"Before making a brunch reservation here, I read through several dozen negative reviews. Now that I'm on the other side, I can say that most of the criticisms of The Gage are laughable. High prices and small portions were what we expected. Fine, I thought. Some trendy place with over-the-top presentation and pretentious service. I can deal with it. I was willing to take the risk. (Hopefully my girlfriend will like it?)Instead, we were blown away. We split the seasonal yogurt and fruit (~$14). Huge cup of yogurt, granola, and more fruit than we could handle. It was more filling than you'd expect yogurt and fruit to be. Next, I ordered Chilaquiles ($13) while my dining partner ordered smoked salmon ($15). We were told that the smoked salmon would be a ""light"" portion (which is why I didn't order it), it ended up being a huge serving. She struggled to pile all of the smoked salmon onto the bagel, and that was after I helped myself to some of it. The Chilaquiles was, again, a massive portion. Never have I been so satisfied by a breakfast item featuring ""two eggs"".Our server was exactly what you'd hope for when you get brunch: helpful but subdued. Not in your face, not checking up on you every five minutes, but was happy to make recommendations beyond ""I like everything!"". I look forward to returning for lunch or dinner."
"Came by on a Friday evening for some post-work drinks. It was pretty crowded, but my group grabbed a few seats at the bar. Good service, great drink list (especially the beers), and my boyfriend has nothing by good things to say about their menu. The location is convenient if you work in the loop or just happen to be in the area."
"Honestly, I give reviews for places I really like or places I really hate. I was looking up places to eat dinner on yelp since it was my first time in Chicago. I usually try to go for 4 stars or more and $$. This place had $$$ but it wasn't that bad, especially for a city.If you're a tartare person, I highly recommend that you try the Bison tartar. The waitress recommended it and honestly it was one of the best tartares I've had. The combination of the flavors just complemented each other really well. It wasn't an entree but it filled me up enough. And I wanted to get dessert and tea as well. For dessert, I ordered the carrot cake donut. It comes stuffed with cream cheese frosting. I'm super picky about cream cheese frosting. It can be either too cheesey or too plain sugary. This was more of a buttery cream cheese frosting. Not my absolute favorite but it was still delicious. It also comes with a mini milk shake. Overall, I'd have to say my experience was good and the waitress was really accommodating."
We stopped in for breakfast on our way down to the Art Institute and all I can say is get the potatoes!!!So incredible.
Another great gem in Chicago.  The beet salad was a blend of salty-sweet; sweetness from the beets and a burst of salt from the pistachio nuts- fantastic!  I had a pasta with vodka sauce also very good.  Service was fantastic.
Awesom experience!  From host stand to plate up it was a great dining experience! Our server made spot on recommendations and made us feel right at home.  So now for the best part ... The most important part... The food was outstanding!  The curry sauce on the muscles appetizer ... To DIE for I actually almost asked for it in a container to go! Scallop on my salad perfectly done! Order your heart out you can't go wrong on your meal here!We will be back and next time we'll order the other side of the menu!My One Wish - I wish there were less components to the dishes. My server explained the specials beautifully but after the 6th ingredients on the dish my ADD Hungry butt tuned out. Your food is Solid no need to and then and then on good food!
My friends and I had a nice time here. The gage has a nice decor though it can be a little loud inside. For the most part it was fine but sometimes I had a hard time hearing people. The service was attentive but not overbearing which is good. I loved! My carrot ravioli. It was super yummy but I would have liked the portion to be slightly bigger. Though for the price it was reasonable. My friends enjoyed their meals and everything looked really good when it came out. No one had a complaint there. The desserts were good too. I was happy with basic ice cream. So many things sounded interesting I might go back. But this place isn't cheap. You know that going in but it's a little pretentious in my opinion.
"I'm glad I choose this as my last restaurant in Chicago. I had 12 people coming with me so I made a reservation in advance but they were very accommodating when I had to increase and later decrease the numbers. I got there early and sat at the bar. I tried their martinez cocktail, which was a perfect amount of tangy. When we sat at the table I ordered bottles of prosecco to share with a couple of the people at the table. I got the scotch egg for an appetizer, which was incredible. For dinner, I shared the lamb shank and scallops with one other person for our entree. The scallops were delicious, but like more places, if I only got the scallops, I would not be filling at all. The lamb shank was out of this world. Looking back, I should have gotten a dessert, poor choice on my part. The venison burger seemed to be a huge hit at our table. The fish and chips were decent but nothing special."
"Loved this spot!  My friend and I had been at the Art Museum for a few hours and we were starving, but on a little bit of a time crunch.  I found Gage on Yelp and booked us a table for a half an hour later.  When we got there, it was 2:30pm and the place was packed, but they were ready for us and had a table all set up! The service was excellent - we were checked on just enough to never need anything, but not so much to be annoying.  And our waiter made great conversation without it seeming like feigned interest.  My friend had the cheeseburger, which she really enjoyed (I snuck a few of her fries and they were delicious) and I had the New England Lobster Roll (delicious and satisfying) and a Revolution IPA which was fantastic.  Would definitely come back here again next time I'm in Chicago!"
"Out of all the restaurants I've ever been to, The Gage has served the best carpaccio. It was perfect (I added a picture). That's something definitely worth coming back for.Overall the food was great. I had leek ravioli and side order of cauliflower. Both excellent choices. The menu is quite limited, and different, so if you are one of those people who always orders the same thing at whatever restaurant you go to, this may not be the place for you. Go to TGI Fridays down the street.The cocktails are quite good as well. Strongly recommend trying out their bar menu ;)One complaint: The restaurant is a bit noisy and I wish that at places like that management would ask people with small children to escort them out if they are crying or screaming bloddy murder. It's not pleasant to the 99.99% other patrons who are trying to enjoy their meal.  However, I can excuse it because it was mother's day and dads in general are poor at managing these types of things. :)"
"I love that I can walk to this restaurant from either the Palmer House Hilton or the Chicago Hilton- two of my regular hotels in Chicago. I arrived 10 minutes early for my 8pm Opentable reservation. Upon checking in, I requested outdoor seating because it was a beautiful night. They said it would probably be about a 20 min wait and that they would text me. I headed to the noisy bar. By the time we got our drinks, the text came that our table was ready (less than 20 min). They had blue cheese stuffed olives which were delicious but my dirty martini was not dirty enough (not dirty at all?); I requested and immediately received a little more olive juice added. My friend's gin martini was perfect. The martinis were served in the old fashioned rounded martini glasses (not cone). Love that!!! The outdoor seating was a whole different world. It was quiet and semi private since there were high walls enclosing the outdoor dining area. I started with the Caesar salad which was amazing- very cheesy and made the way I requested. I would order this again. I ordered the special of the night which was a wild caught salmon. It was so fresh! But I thought maybe a little too done. I mentioned it to the waitress who offered to take it back but I didn't want to bother with all that. The manager also came out and made the same offer and then offered dessert which turned out to be a show stealer! Peanut butter something. I don't know and I don't want to know because I would order that next time! For his main, my friend got the elk which was incredible. I tasted it and made a mental note to order that in the future. It was perfectly done too.I will definitely return here again. The Gage is in my permanent rotation."
"Came by for a going-away dinner this past weekend.  While the venison burger was the big winner at our table, the cocktails were generally good (the bourbon old-fashioned here was incredible), the lamb shank won raves, and the fish and chips was better than average.  A bit too expensive for my taste, but actually on par or slightly below the cost of other restaurants in the Loop (and especially on Michigan!).  I was also hoping for a better bar area, but the booth and table seating farther away from the bar is pretty nice and seating for big guys like myself is quite good."
"2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 300/365300TH REVIEW OF THE 2014! WOOT WOOT!Only 65 more until I complete the 365 Challenge! :)Explored Chicago for the first time two weeks ago. My dad and I flew into O'Hare on a Friday evening, and needed some late night food after a long day of traveling. I checked out what was relatively close to our hotel, and The Gage showed up. Looked promising according to the Yelp iPhone app, so we decided to give it a try.The Gage is located right next to Millennium Park - perfect location. We arrived around 10pm and the place was hoppin'. The inside felt very bar-like and was super loud and packed on a Friday night. We asked if we could sit outside and it made our experience much more enjoyable. Much more quiet and peaceful and was basically 100% different from if we had sat inside, which I was very thankful for!As far as food goes, my dad started off with the oysters appetizer: Pink Trout Roe, and Ponzu Mignonette. I had never tried an oyster before so he persuaded me to try one of the smaller ones (3 small, 3 large). It was...interesting. I'm not a fishy person to begin with. My exact words were, ""It wasn't as bad as I was expecting...but not good either."" LOL. My dad thought they were pretty good and he especially liked the smaller ones. For entrees, I got the Pork Porterhouse with chestnuts, sweet potato, grilled apple, and natural jus. I thought that it was decent, but I felt that my pork was a little on the dry side. I enjoyed the sweet potato but I still think you could probably order a side dish to make it a more filling meal. My dad ordered the Roasted Rack Of Elk, which came with a giardiniera salad, prosciutto, and black truffle croquettas. It was his first time trying elk and he REALLY enjoyed it - probably his favorite meal out of our entire stay in Chicago. It wasn't as game-y as he thought it would be and it was very soft and delicious.Dessert was by FAR my favorite part of the evening. GET THE CORN AND BLUEBERRIES. You will not be disappointed! I was about to go for the Chocolate Pot de Creme when I realized, ""I could get this anywhere."" Our waiter, Seth, said the Corn and Blueberries was popular because corn is a very Midwestern ingredient, and since I'm from California it probably doesn't play as prevalent of a role in my life as it does in the Midwest. I decided to go for it, and I think it may be one of the best desserts I've ever had, or at least one the most unique! Corn and Blueberries is described on the menu as ""tarragon blueberry compote, corn ice cream, gooey butter cake, and crispy corn crepes ($10)"". OMG. The corn ice cream was the best part. It has that irresistible sweet corn flavor that made each bite a slice of heaven. omg...I could have eaten like a pint of that alone! I also really liked the gooey butter cake. It was really decadent and so buttery without being overly sweet. Absolutely perfect, and paired well with the blueberries. Ugh. I would come back just for dessert. I'm sad I live in California and won't be able to get it!Service was absolutely fantastic. Seth, our waiter, was super awesome. My dad told him about how I'm a Yelp Elite LOL and Seth told us about a bunch of restaurants he suggested for us to go to. I was pleased to find out that many of the places he recommended were ones my fellow Yelp Elite friends had referred to me! He was totally aware of the foodie scene in Chicago and it was awesome and he gave us so many good tips and comments. Great guy!Overall, my dad and I really enjoyed The Gage and I definitely think it was one of our favorite meals during our visit to Chicago. Highly recommend!"
"We went there with our family. The kids (ages 12 & 15) enjoyed the burgers. The location is great and the menu is diverse. I had the Ruben and it was so tasty. The check ended up being $60 for a family of 4, so it isn't cheap eats. The service was great!"
"This is great place to take Clients for a work dinner and drinks. They have an extended whiskey and scotch menu, albeit a bit pricey. Their food is delicious and reasonably priced. If you are interested in drinking something unusual and different, just ask their bartenders to make something for you. I was thoroughly impressed with my surprise drink."
Came here two days ago for brunch. All I have to is the mint tea is amazing. It's a gotta have it.
"After doing the tourist thing at the Bean, my travel companion and I were in need of a restaurant, and the closer to Millennium Park the better! I was a bit skeptical that anything of quality could be found so close to such a heavy tourist area, but fortunately The Gage proved to be a delicious destination.Our food was great, from the complimentary bread and butter to our entrees. My friend loved her farm chicken and I quickly devoured the aptly named ""Diet? What diet?"" burger. My only complaint is that the menu can get a bit pricey, but since I was on vacation I imbibed the spirit of my burger by adopting a ""Budget? What budget?"" attitude and surrendered myself over to the deliciousness that The Gage had to offer."
"Great brunch food! Crowded though so make reservations. The chilaquiles here are my favorite. Great service and such a convenient location - perfect place to take out of town visitors! Right next to millennium park, the bean and other great tourist attractions :) enjoy!"
"This claims to be an Irish gastro pub.With ex-Irish owners who sing praises about their Irish heritage.The bacon was American and not Irish.I can get Irish bacon at my butcher and I'm not a restaurant.The soda bread was fatty and not good. They only had plain soda rolls.Soda bread is very easy to do, try it.There are also many ways of doing it, whole wheat, with molasses etc.They serve Chilaquiles {mexican}Really, Mexican. I didn't know the Mexicans immigrated to Ireland and influencedthe cuisine there.The scallop salad I ordered was $17 and had 3 measly scallops.I know scallops cost $30 a pound at Eataly, but that is no reason to chargeme $17 for 3 scallops, 8 leaves of lettuce and a zucchini. I ordered a Spanish coffee, it was more like a 1980's cocktail with the sugar on the rim and tasted bad not to mention $12.None of the desserts were anything that would be offered in Ireland.So $80 for brunch for a couple.Since I have been cooking Irish recipes for the past 4 months.You can read ""the country cooking of Ireland""I feel this has nothing to do with Ireland.As a brunch place it is very expensive too.So, I won't be going back.Oh, wait they also had Scotch Egg for $8 .This is not an Irish dish and  $8 is a rip-off."
Mocktail Report: The Gage has rotating house made sodas that are always a tasty nonalcoholic option!
"While we were dining at another restaurant on a visit to Chicago, The Gage was recommended to us for a lunch after visiting the Art Institute. The menu has fish and chips, burgers and sandwiches. We had a half sandwich + fries + soup (asparagus was the soup of the day and it was fantastic) all for $12. It's a lively atmosphere with good food and fast service. It was the perfect stop off as we were tourist-ing around Michigan Avenue. I probably wouldn't have noticed it had it not been for the recommendation, which shows that it's always a good idea to ask when you're visiting a new city."
"I guess if you really want me to like your burger, salt the shit out of it.My burger was more medium rare than rare but they did attempt to get a good sear off of it.  What was interesting was that the burger had the onion and tomato in the burger but the lettuce was on the side?  Keep it from wilting?  I guess so.  As I mentioned, it was pretty super seasoned.  Initially, my reaction was ""whoa hey that's really tasty"" but then after a couple more bites it slowly went to ""meh.""13 bucks for the burger with really good chips (instead fries) is par for the course for lunch at sit down places during the lunch hour.  This experience, though, is definitely good enough to bring me back.  I'm definitely going to check out them fish'n chips."
"Probably one of my best restaurants so far in downtown Chicago!The restaurants has been divided into 2 parts and they also have bar. We were here for dinner and they have daily special dinner menu. Awesome! My friend and I both ordered a BBQ pork belly, which was pretty good even though it was a medium plate (we thought we would never be full with this course, but we finally did). I also order a mashed potato side, which was far beyond my exception!I really enjoy the atmosphere here. I will miss here when I come back to Indiana."
"Probably one of my favorite dinner spots in the city. The food is gourmet, satisfying, and predictably excellent.The decor in here is stellar. It has an upscale,Chicago-style decor. Glossy, dark-green tile is prevalent on the walls with reinforced glass partitions. It's dimly lit by candles and vintage fixtures. I love the feel of this place.Every time I've taken a date here it's been excellent. Do note: there isn't much in this area other than concert halls or the ballet. The loop is prone to that, but this place sticks out as a destination dinner spot.The food, goes without saying, is stellar. I've never been disappointed. It is artfully made, in modest portions. THE FISH AND CHIPS ARE THE BEST IN THE CITY (these are upscale f&c, not some typical platter you get at an irish pub). Check out the photos - the creative effort is apparent.It's moody, with lots of space, great for an impressive dinner with business clients, your date, or even your family. Minus one star for sometimes spotty table service - it can get VERY busy here, so I understand why.---P.S. The owner of The Gage is a great, great guy. He was walking around, talking to people, very interested in your experience and how you are doing. He even took the time to help clear tables and assist! Now that's a truly successful business owner - check out The Dawson in the West Loop... an equally impressive and excellent place to get a drink."
"I've always assumed that every restaurant in the touristy parts of town are just overpriced and underwhelming and are usually there for tourists' convenience. The Gage's location literally across the street from Millennium Park screams mediocrity. But nope, this place is legit!I would actually not recommend this as THE nice meal tourist should eat on their first visit here because there are actually many more critically acclaimed and special restaurants that I believe are more worth visiting in Chicago. Might be a great place for drinks and small plates or something if you're nearby though.I think if you are living here semi-long term or visit frequently, this is a nice place to treat yourselves to a nice meal. I don't know if it's special or unique, but it's certainly nice. The service is great, drinks are great, the atmosphere is versatile enough for casual and those who want to dress up. It gets a little loud, but the rooms are segregated and it helps. We sat toward the back in a room that had fewer tables and had no problems hearing, but I was definitely worried as we walked through the front to get to our table. Perhaps you could request the quieter rooms on Opentable when you make your reservation.As for the food, their menu seems to rotate but we ordered a ton of food and they were all mostly delicious. I don't know if you'd call all the flavors ""mindblowing,"" or ""whimsical"" or ""creative."" I don't think this is the place for that.  However, everything we ordered made sense and was a composed and balanced plate of food with a lot of thought put into how each component adds to the dish - or so it seems, because nothing seemed out of place! Execution was pretty flawless; I had no complaints and I always almost look for those when I pay this much money for my food.My favorite of our night is the venison carpaccio. Get it. Least favorite is probably the poutine, which was a bit bland and heavy for my taste.Definitely a place I'd want to come back to over and over again, despite my usual preference for more ""creative"" fine dining."
"So on my second day in Chicago, my boyfriend took me to the Gage for lunch. He had made reservations before I came so I'm not sure exactly how long lunch will take if you don't have reservations. Anyway after walking into the restaurant's revolving door we went to the front desk and checked in. Waited for a few moments and were seated.Quickly looking over the menu I narrowed my choices down to either the Crispy soft shell crab sandwich or the Gage Venison Burger. After talking it over with the boyfriend I chose the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich. WHICH WAS THE BEST CHOICE EVER! Anyway when the waiter came to take our order, he told me that there was only one Soft Shell Crab Sandwich left in the back and said he'd try and get it for me. My boyfriend chose ""the Regular Burger"" medium rare. After waiting a little bit, we got our food. I was so excited when the my plate was placed in front of me. The sandwich was superb! All the ingredients combined to make a party in my mouth. I have no other way to describe my food. The portion was JUST RIGHT as well. Just thinking about that sandwich makes me super hungry. My boyfriend's burger was great too...except he said the bottom ""bread"" portion of the burger became soggy because the burger patty was too juicy. Anyway the meal was delicious and I would totally go again. :)"
"Not the usual kind of place we like to go to. This place caters to tourists but since it is so close to the art institute we gave this place a try.Pretty happy even though much of the decor and service is like it was factory run. Venison burger is seriously one of the best burgers other the the burger at the spotted pig in new york this has to be best burger. Lobster roll was good not great but it came with house made chips. The gage mint tea was really special and worth trying if you like mint tea. This place seems to be a money making machine, they crank out the food fast but the service probably ought to be more attentive."
"Grabbed a quick bite here one night after hearing great things about The Gage. Was a bit hard to find at night considering its location and dark interior, but for a bar/gastropub, that's almost certainly a given. I can't say that I'm giving The Gage a fair review because I ordered my House Poutine to go, but what I had to eat was decent. Pork shoulder stayed tender and had the nice meaty flavor I was expecting, and the cheese curds were as good as any. I questioned the use of the carrots given the crispiness of the fries, but it wasn't a big deal. Speaking of the fries, they weren't anything special, but I guess they don't have to be when they're going to be covered in gravy, meat, and some veggies anyways. Gravy had a nice strong-but-not-overpowering flavor as well. The portion was pretty substantial so I'd say that you're getting your money's worth of food - I'm just not sure that it's the best you can do for that price. But again, this was take-out, so take my word with a grain of salt.Can't speak too much about service since I didn't actually have a waiter. Will try to come back some day for an actual sit-down meal to give a more accurate review."
"Delicious food!  We had scotch eggs, chorizo and sandwiches and everything was perfect.  Will be definitely returning on our next trip to Chicago."
"Had lunch with a girlfriend here today. We had the eggs Benedict and smoked salmon bagel. Both were delicious.The eggs Benedict came along with roasted potatoes which were also yum, but I think the dish would've been more well rounded with some spinach. Poached egg was on point.The smoked salmon was really generous IMO and the quality of the fish was top notch too. It's a little pricey but the quality is there. As written above, a little more green in the dish would've made it perfect! Will visit again"
"Wonderful wonderful place, went for lunch & the menu was superb!!! The menu is Delish, had the salmon blt-omg it was so tasty, the bread, the salmon, the bacon & all the veggies-combination made my taste buds burst into BLISS!!  My favorite & I woke craving it -The beet salad-My friend & split it & it was very filling... Share it!!! The GAGE is located right across from millennium park .... Can't wait to return to try the dinner menu!!!"
"This place was a huge surprise for me.  My concierge recommended it for a local place to meet friends for an upscale lunch.At first, I thought this was going to be a typical Irish pub, but the food offerings were excellent. Everyone in our party loved their dishes. I can vouch for the scotch egg and filet - Wonderful!A fine Guinness pour as well.bottom linePerfect for lunch before or after a trip to the Art Inst or Bean.  More upscale than a pub, but the prices are in line with the quality of food. Yum!"
This has a very unique location right on Michigan Ave across from millennium park. Food is outstanding and run by Billy Lawless who has several different very successful restaurants around the city. Had the fried pickles which were delicious and the venison burger which is absolutely dynamite. I would tell anyone going there to get that. It is nice that there can be a classy and actually good pub type restaurant in such a touristy spot in Chicago.
"Raw antelope?  Yes, invoke your inner caveman and enjoy one of the most subtle and amazing dishes I had on my last trip to Chicago.  The antelope tartar, bound with a quail egg (do it yourself), a touch of cheese, and various oils/sauces (only a touch), is awesome.  So are the fresh oysters with the ""bloody mary"" sauce.  The bone marrow with tongue was incredible.  I'm usually meh on bone marrow--it's become a bit trendy lately--but this prep was really special.  Pull a Nancy Reagan and ""just say no"" to the odd fusion seared scallops with Korean BBQ and kimchi (separate each was great, together not so much).The after-work crowd is a bit yuppie, but that's due to the location on Michigan Ave.  I dared the crowds, pushed my way to a seat at the bar, and enjoyed.  The bar staff was AWESOME, helpful, and fun.  Wine list affordable and amazing.  Basic craft cocktails, but if you enjoy mezcal, have them whip you up a nice one."
"Did not get food. Awesome beer selection! Very VERY busy for a Thursday night, but it was fun. Really nice server. I wish I could come back sooner!"
"They deserve their 4 star rating.  Located where they are, you get a good mix of tourists , locals as well as business people looking for more casual setting.  They are a gastro pub so yes you will be tempted to drink a little during your lunch hour.  I came solo and was under a time crunch so decided to go with the bar seating.  It was pretty packed around 12.30pm on Wednesday.  The bar has faster turnaround so I was lucky and was seated promptly.  Wine was very pricey, about $15 or more!  I guess they really want you to order beer.  Not a big beer person so won't comment on that.  The lunch menu is smaller than the dinner menu but very reasonably priced.  I had the truffle mushroom sandwich.  Awesome!  The bread is in between a French (crunchy) and Portuguese bread (soft inside).  The truffle oil is subtle and yet defining the dish.  The mushroom is like a sponge absorbing all the seasoning and truffle oil.  It came with a coleslaw that's also adding a good pickled flavor.  It came French fries, nothing special and the sandwich is a good lunch size anyway so I was beyond full.Service at the bar is fast.  Not super friendly but efficient.  Perfect for solo traveler.  They don't try and rush you either.  One guy beside me was just taking his time, I guess he may have all the afternoon to kill time for."
"Great service. I ordered an Original burger and my drink of choice was an Old fashion. Fries were terrific and the burger was the perfect size. The most memorable experience will be my drink, the old fashion was I of a kind with a new modern infusion of cherry and sugar along with the traditional bitter. Amazingly dangerous but the best I ever had."
"We started off on the right foot when the restaurant was able to combine two reservations for 4 into a table for 8.  They told us they could not guarantee it, but we were plesantly surprised when they were able to accomodate us.  Our waiter was great.  We had 4 kids in our party, and while this is a more upscale, trendy restaurant, he made sure to let us know that they could make the kids the standard kid fare of chicken fingers, mac and cheese, and grilled cheese if they did not want to order off of the menu.  Was he ever surprised that our kids, all under the age of 12, ordered duck, lamb, the house specialty pasta, and steak!  We have foodies-to-be on our hands!  The meal itself was wonderful-- from the sone fruits and cheese with naan appetizer to the beet salad to the entrees to the desserts.  We all tried something different and shares tastes across the table.  The halibut en croute was delicate, buttery, and light.  The lamb was perfectly rare and not gamey at all.  The steak was flavorful but not overdone with spices or sauces-- the meat stood alone and deserved its spotlight.  The duck, pasta, and chicken all got high marks, as  well.  The peanut butter cake was the perfect topper, though the other dessert looked and tasted like ice cream with extra cream on the side and homemade mint Oreos on top-- it was good, but nothing special.  The kids all had ice cream.  A perfect end to a great day!"
"New ""go to"" place in Chicago. Poutine, Scotch Egg (quail version), Pork Serato, Peanut Butter French Silk Pie. Now I can die happy. The menu is small and impossible to choose from because it all sounds really good, looks better, tastes phenomenal. Wait and bartender staff are friendly, responsive and professional. Shout out to Wes the waiter and Kevin the bartender when you go."
"I've been here many times. First off, it's one of the best Scotch Eggs (Quail) to get in Chicago. I think something comparable to this would be Owen and Engine. Also, their fish n chips are pretty awesome too. Overall, a good place for lunch and dinner. Every time I go here the service, drinks and food are outstanding.. The one thing that might be considered a notch down are the tourists around the area but hey.. it's Michigan avenue. It's a great go-to post work when you want to feel a bit ""spendy"". Trust me, the extra money is worth the drink and dining experience."
"Great menu, HUGE space, excellent wine list. To this New Yorker, cocktails & wines were well priced ($13 for a quartino, around $11-12 for cocktails). I had the vegan moroccan spiced pot pie, and it was excellent (and paired nicely with the wine my server recommended). Great vibe and friendly service, would be back."
"Have been a couple times now. I like that it's close to the Art Museum and park. The ambiance is nice enough. It's typical of a upscale y gastro pub.I can't recall all of the items we've tried.   The mussels are pretty good. and I also tried  the orzo soup last time and couldn't ""find"" the orzo.. seriously,  no orzo was in my soup.. it took me awhile to flag down my server,   they re did it and it was somewhat ""better"" with orzo in it.. but I don't recall it being stellar. I think they are just ""shy"" on the execution here. I'd likely frequent other places along Mich. Ave since there are quite a few new ones popping up to try.."
"I loved this place! It was our first day visiting Chicago and the Bean was our first stop. In mapping our itinerary before the trip, we saw that this restaurant was super nearby! It's literally right across the street from the park. It was Valentine's Day so we figured it'd be safe to make lunch reservations. We were seated right away and the hostess was extremely polite. The crowd seemed to be mostly busy people on their lunch break, wining and dining clients, it seemed like. There weren't many tourists. We had some time to look over the food and drink menu. I ordered a fruity cocktail and my bf got one of their specialty beers. The drink menu is quite extensive! For our meal, I ordered the hangar steak salad and he got a burger/soup combo with the special of the day, which was the cauliflower soup. The food wasn't exactly quick to arrive, but we didn't mind. It was our first day in Chicago after all, we were enjoying ourselves! When it did, my salad looked quite beautiful. Huge chunks of steak with a nice bed of salad and blood oranges. It tasted just as good as it looked! My bf's cauliflower soup was AMAZING. Overall, it was a great way to kick off our vacation!It's also walking distance to the Art Institute! So convenient."
"We stopped here for an afternoon drink after the museum on a Saturday, and the bartender, drinks and atmosphere was perfect for a daytime craft beer. The bartender was very helpful with the draft selections and attentive, and while we did not get the food, the fish and chips that passed by us smelled and looked amazing! I recommend for a casual beer or great lunch, and really conveniently located on Michigan ave by the park and museum."
"The Gage is best described as a restaurant with some wild and exotic plates (e.g., lamb ribs, Venison burger, Elk meat). Other than boasting these specialty items on the menu, the Gage is your middle of the road restaurant. For the extremely high price that you can expect to pay, the return on investment in terms of tasting great cuisine is low. Here's the run down: -Great bread and butter to start. -Fried Pickle is also good with perfect texture and crispiness-Smoky Lamb Ribs is perhaps the best dish we ordered, and this is from a guy who avoids ordering lamb in other restaurants.  The lamb fell off the bone; the sweet and tangy sauce was delicious. -Halibut was pan-seared to achieve the perfect crunch on the exterior while maintaining the moistness of the fish.  Sauce is light and buttery. While the dish was technically well-executed, it was one to two notes at best. -The Elk was prepared medium-rare and while there is nothing wrong with it, the flavor also fell flat. -Venison burger, juicy and satisfying, was perhaps the second best dish of the evening and definitely worth trying. -Caramelized Lemon Pond Cake and Peanut Butter French Silk Pie (Desserts) also fall into the OK category. Overall, come try the Smoky Lamb Ribs and the Venison Burger. Skip the rest."
"Loved this place. Great ambiance, fantastic service, divine food. We went for lunch and  had the award winning poutine. I highly recommend it. The open faced venison meatloaf sandwich was to die for. Go here, you won't be disappointed!"
"Ate here with my family today. Our server, Michael was extremely attentive, personable, and well educated on the food and beverage menus. The venison burger was fantastic."
"Great dining experience! Really cool vibe and great food! I had the garlic toast as an appetizer and the ""The Regular Burger"" for dinner and is was one of the best burgers I've ever had!"
Had lunch at Gage today located across from millennium park. Server was very attentive and accommodating. My daughter and i split a Caesar salad and a burger with fries. Both came pre split on two plates. The salad was very fresh. And the burger perfectly cooked and very tasty. Highly recommended! Several beers on tap
"Great atmosphere at Gage I was there with friends. The food was good and so with the drinks. I stopped in for a quick meal I got the burger and a couple craft beers. The burger was cook very well and the beer selection was perfect. The staff was exceptionally courteous polite and accommodating to our needs. sadly one of our party fell ill and had to leave shortly after getting together the staff was very understanding and very hospitable and did everything they could to help out. The only downside is after a while it got very loud in the bar I had a hard time hearing a conversation with my friends. I would expect, for earlier times and lunch, it would be quieter.Overall the experience was more than expected and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"I wanted to love this place. Based on reviews I went in with high expectations. The ambiance was great - tasteful and welcoming. The menu had some great options and the server assistant came to our table immediately and filled waters which was great. But then we waited for a good 7/8 minutes for the waiter to even approach the table to greet us and get drink orders. Drinks were delivered promptly, but even though we were ready to order the waiter dropped off the drinks and walked away too quickly for us to even say we were ready. Waited a good 12 minutes before he actually returned to take our order. The food came out fast after we ordered but the service delayed our meal. I got the smoked salmon blt which was delish. Fries were a little cold and sub-par. Payment processing was kind of a nightmare too. We asked to use the cash we gave first and to put the balance on the card. Server came back with copy to sign, full amount charged to the card and cash gone. we didn't notice right away and he came back a few minutes later to say he had made a mistake. Which was proactive and great. But it took about 15 minutes to fix. I'm a manager in the industry and know that it's a super easy fix that should've taken about 3 seconds, especially with the nice POS systems they use. Annoying.Overall: food and atmosphere on point. Service not so much."
I loved the poutine and definitely recommend that as a starter. I had a Moscato wine with the catch of the day. It was amazing. We finished of with a blood orange sorbet. One scoop is enough. Down to the last drop of Moscato I was in heaven.
"Score!Great weekend brunch, 'nuff said. EXCEPT THAT . . . great location, good service, good wine list, good beer selection . . ."
"One of the most disappointing spots considering the huge amount of great reviews. Went on a Friday night, no reservation but was seated quickly. Very loud, echoes which make it hard for any and all to hear. Ordered the Mussels Vindaloo and the tomato burrata  salad. Also a beer for me and a drink for my lady friend.The mussels were good, very tasty broth, good grilled toast points and decent quantity for the price ($18). Unfortunately I counted 7-8 dead or unopened mussels. Considering you only get about 40.....well you do the math.The tomato burrata salad was ok. But for $16 all you get is 3-4 halved cherry tomatoes and a quarter larger tomato. The basil was served in 2 full leaves hastily dropped on top of the tomatoes with a few ribbons of red onion,a few drops of balsamic and the burrata. Taste was 4 stars, presentation and quantity were lacking big time.I would likely not go back."
"I had a great time at The Gage.  The food was amazing, the service was flawless, and it was overall an excellent experience.  It was busy that night, so we enjoyed well-made cocktails while waiting for a table to open up outside.  The old-style restaurant has tile floors, a long bar, and lots of wooden furniture, making for great ambiance.  They had a great wine selection.  We also ordered champagne.For appetizers, we ordered the poutine, which was RIDICULOUS good.  Very hearty, delicious, and indulgent.  It was smothered in cheese curds and braised meat.  I could have been content with having that dish to myself.  We also ordered their ""fondue,"" which was more of a cheese dip.  It came with toasted bread that went perfectly with the thick, melted brie.  Extremely decadent.For our main courses, we got the porterhouse with truffle fries and the roasted elk.  The porterhouse was juicy and cooked perfectly.  The truffle fries were powerfully flavored and complemented the steak nicely.  The elk was to die for- it was so delicate and tender that it practically melted in your mouth.  Awesome taste.In addition, we had superior service- our waiter was very attentive, super friendly, and had a great attitude and personality.  He made strong recommendations that did not disappoint, and was overall a fun guy.Next time, I definitely want to try the venison burger- apparently everyone else was ordering it and it's all anyone ever talks about!  I will definitely be back."
"Came here with high expectations based on reviews and area. Waitress takes our order, and after we have finished eating the appetizer, she returns and asks us if we would like to order our meals. Confused, we tell her we already have ordered, and tell her we no longer want the order and she insists on taking the order and expediting it to-go. We tell her we really would prefer not to and we just want the bill. But she tells us it is covered and it will be out ASAP. Upon receiving the order 20 minutes later, the manager informs us that he has ""graciously"" taken off the cost of our DRINKS instead of the food, which was less than half the price of what the meal would have been. Waste of time and money, will not ever return."
"I don't even know where to start!  My friend and I stopped by here for lunch while visiting the city.  Let me preface this review in that I ""try"" to be health conscious when dining out.  With that said, I completely went against all consciousness and got the fish and chips PLUS a beer.  So bad yet so good!I don't think I've actually ever ordered fish and chips on my own- I will usually pick off someone else's plate.  However, on this particular occasion I had a gut feeling just to order it and I am not sorry one bit!  The fish was amazingly moist, flavorful and light.  The batter was super crispy and not greasy.  Add some lemon and malt vinegar- omg heaven!!!Bar service was attentive and friendly.  Atmosphere is busy and lively.  Next time I'm in Chicago I will definitely be back!!!"
"I really liked this place for a work dinner. I went to Chicago for business and one of my colleagues chose this place. What we had:Scotch eggCheese platterCurry pot pie- veganWineBeerEverybody loved the food, and the wait staff was fantastic. And can we talk about their wine portions? It seemed like they were larger pours than usual. They give you a glass of wine with a leftover pour in a second glass. It was really nice presentation- also seemed like more wine! That's how you make a lady happy!!I definitely would recommend this spot to a friend! Grey atmosphere too. It's good for casual dinners or probably late night drinks. They had a second bar in the basement too!!! It was a very handsome crowd, but maybe that's just Chicago?"
"Great place for brunch or lunch. Easy to find location with much more seating than you would expect from looking at the building. We have been there twice, if it weren't for us now living in the suburbs, we'd be there at least once a month for the delicious burgers! The service has always been friendly and quick. Food comes fast and is priced accurately for the amount, quality and location. If you're looking for an intimate date, be aware that the seating is a bit tight and you might be place within 2 feet of another couple. Also if I remember correctly - the waitress told us they only have the brunch menu on the weekends, so if you are browsing the website for an option before you go just be mindful it might not be available. My suggestion: burger"
"Quite popular and crowded, not many choices but the food we ordered are awesome. The burger is juicy, the bread is yummy, the scotch egg is special."
"Quality food? Definitely.Quality service? Definitely.Atmosphere? Fancy but not prissy.Value? Well...it wasn't cheap.If I wanted to take the family out for a special dinner, this would be the place."
"The venison Burger is my favorite Burger in Chicago. They have one of the longest beer lists in Chicago. It's across the street from Millennium Park. A huge upgrade from Park Tavern and you only have to walk across the street.You obviously pay a bit more due to its location, but if you're in the Loop this is one of the better options."
"The bison tartare, the venison burger with jalapeños and the fantastic wine list..AMAZING! the service was perfect! I absolutely enjoyed every minute of my experience!"
"My husband and I celebrated my birthday with a trip to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in June. The Gage was highly recommended for dinner. We stopped there after the concert and we each had a drink, appetizer, entree (fish and chips and a burger) and dessert. All were incredible! We loved the location, setting, and service. Our server Elizabeth was wonderful;  explaining each dish and offering suggestions. We definitely will be visiting here again."
"Up Michigan Avenue, across from the Art Institute, near the row of downtown hotels, the Gage is worth a special trip. Go out of your way to eat here. You will not be disappointed. A short menu with a good range of interesting dishes, but each exquisite in its own way. A good selection at the bar. A well curated set of bottles, both wine and beer. Well crafted cocktails. They served a pureed cauliflower with pork belly soup as a special the night I dined there. Rich, creamy and delicious. It was a bowl of warmth and satisfaction on a cold night. I followed with the bitter greens salad. Very interesting in flavor profile and texture. Delicious. I ordered a side of Brussels sprout, off the menu, and they were gracious about it. Perfectly cooked, still crunchy, and full of delicious umami flavor. Swanky without being pretentious.  A restaurant for adults."
"Enjoyed a great dinner last night while in town for work.  Very crowded, they do take reservations, but luckily the two of us got right in.  The cheese fondue was amazing, I had the scallop app as my entree and the kale and between the 3 it was enough.  My friend had the pork chop and loved it, it is huge Fred Flintstone style.  She also had the brussel sprouts which were ok, I prefer them roasted.  We split the apple cider donuts and it was a great ending to an awesome meal.  They have a nice wine list too.  Enjoy!"
"Tentatively bit into the loaded shishito peppers, thinking I might have made a mistake, ordering a bowl to myself. Few minutes later, pressed it on my bar mates raving about the flavor. Venison burger hit the spot but it was the old fashioned, single block of ice, right hint of sweetness, that took it over the top. Too many bars get it wrong so  these people do know their craft. Great atmosphere, terrific food. These people deserve their 5 stars and more in a day when 5 stars are so easily handed out."
"3rd time there.  Terrific experience.  Mike our professional server was exceptional.  Between the 4 of us, started with the poutine fries- yikes!!! Crazy crazy good.  Than had 2 bone in filets- WOW!!!!! Cut it with a fork .  Also had 2 fish and chips. Very good but not too memorable. Side - green beans and mashed potato .  Both very distinctive and delish.  Plenty of cool beers.  A glass of wine is really a glass and a half.  My kids had some unique home made soda's.  We will be back!"
"Everytime I'm here I think I'm more impressed than the last. Stellar location, food and atmosphere and 90% of the time great service! Wine list is great, nice beer selection, food is always something drool-worthy (although sometimes just a bit too adventurous for me!) Occasionally we'll get a host or service staff member who seems a little snippy, but that'll really happen anywhere at some point- overall really good service.Clean a sharp, great place for a cocktail, brunch, or a nice dinner with a swanky vibe. Classy joint ;-)"
The starter bread was great. But I don't like the burger.The peanut cake is worth trying
"We came to The Gage after visiting the Shedd Aquarium and The Field Museum. We were looking for something quick to eat and drink before heading over to the Art Institute.  The Gage was a great stop, right down the block from the Art Institute, with delicious food and excellent selection of beers and drinks.  A little pricey, but what do you expect, it's right across from the Bean!I got the fish and chips, which was really great and served with a ton of fries.  My boyfriend got the ""Pub Burger"" - DELICIOUS!  A savory piece of pork belly served on top of a burger with a fire roasted poblano aioli... (I am salivating while writing this).  I highly recommend this to anyone stopping in here.  They also have a really great selection of beers on tap to accompany their great pub food.  One thing I was super impressed with was how attentive our bartenders were and how fast our food came (literally less than ten minutes after we ordered it).  This was great, as we were just stopping in for something quick to eat and drink before we hit the Art Institute.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place - It's a great restaurant/bar to stop in for lunch and enjoy some delicious pub food and a beer.  Get the Pub Burger!!!!"
Very cool place. It was convenient for lunch in between my conference at the Palmer Hotel. The staff was super friendly and really knew the menu well. I ended up ordering the smoked salmon BLT and I loved it. The fries were nice and crispy and soft too. My friend orders the famous fish and chips and I had a little sample - very good. The batter was light and crispy. Very good food. Eat here.
Whiskey drinkers beware - half of the whiskeys listed under rye are bourbons and make sure you watch them pour. If you order a premium whiskey I watched them pour the cheap equivalent (Sazarac instead of Sazarac 18). Stagg Jr instead of George t Stagg.
"Great appetizer and main dish.  Duck was fantastically cooked.   Like super duper yummy.   Drinks pretty good too, would def come back"
"Oh my gosh, you have to try the venison burger. And the daiquiri. SO AMAZING. I was in heaven. Words cannot even describe how yummy the burger is. The atmosphere is really cool in this place. But I strongly recommend getting a reservation as this place gets packed. I went without one and was lucky enough to get a spot at the bar. The server was also great. She was very helpful and knowledgable on all of the beers on the menu. I highly recommend coming here!"
"Food was good, though a bit pricey for a ""gastropub."" Table service was good but hostess service was lacking.  We arrived on time for our reservation and were told it would be a few minutes.  Others seemed to walk in and immediately be seated.  After about 5 minutes, I received a text saying please return to the hostess stand (which we were standing 5 feet in front of) and we were then told our table was being set.  Five minutes later we shown to our seats.  Hubby had the fish and chips.  Fish was tasty but chips were garden variety to-thin to be called ""chips"" fries.  I had the scallops, which were delish but the portion size left a bit to be desired.  We also had the fondue starter, which was also very tasty."
This place has amazing ambience friendly staff and excellent food. The fish and chips and venison burger were exceptional. The house made seasonal sodas were delicious. Great find close to millennium park
"We went last Friday-- a pretty cold walk to the place from our Mag Mile hotel on a cold night, but that's our problem for not taking a taxi. Nice atmosphere/space, sort of a restored/reimagined fancy kind of bar from a past/lost era. Started with the Mussels Vindaloo which were simply out of this world fantastic. I went with the fish special-- a mackerel dish-- that was quite excellent, though in hindsight, I wish I would have gotten some more meaty since it seemed to be more of that kind of a place. The only downside was it was kinda loud and a bit too expensive (though hey, that's life in the big city)."
"They're always busy it seems, especially on Saturday, so be sure to make a reservation. The cowboy ribeye steak was a good size and tasted great. Mash potato was pretty normal. Sauteed mushroom went well with steak"
I could sum up this review in 3 words: Duck Fat PoutineIf you know what's good for you that should be enough to make you drop everything and head over there. But if you need more information to make up your fussy little mind here it is.Menu is Pub Fare meets American New. Food is great they've got Rack of Elk on the menu which I had to pass on as I had Elk for breakfast that day. They've got a Venison burger that is amazing. Good selection of craft beer on draft and bottle including American and Belgian Ales. Cocktail menu is also solid. The decor inside is sharp but the acoustics are bad so it can get very very loud. There is also an outdoor seating option and given this is on Michigan Ave across from the Bean that can be a pretty sweet setup if the weather is nice. The customer base is a cross between 30yrd old hipsters and 40 something not-so-hipsters. I'd come here to drink or eat or both any day.
I have been back to The Gage twice since the last review - and it's still as good as it gets - great food and service in a great location in Chicago!
"There with work colleagues and recommended by hotel.  This joint hit the spot with great service, food and ambience.  Completely hit the mark with this crew from LA. Drinks are strong and fast, waiter was excellent with the menu. We had a vegan which in this town is rarity and they'd he'd to cook him up something off the menu. Awesome. Had the fish and chips which was excellent. Way better than what I had in LA. Thanks Gage for a great night"
"The Gage is delicious! We got the oysters, scotch egg, scallops, and venison burger to share between 2 and it was perfect portion wise. The only critique would be that the burger came out more on the medium well side when we asked for medium rare/medium but I would still highly recommend all the dishes. We also got the cherry tart for dessert and it wasn't bad but nothing special."
"The location is awesome. It's right across ""the bean"" and around the corner from the ARTIC. It was a short walk from our hotel, the Palmer House, which was very convenient. We just came for drinks and a light bite before dinner. The Bloody Mary's were very good and the poutine was a good dish to share. The menu looks great so I definitely would like to come back to try it out."
"First time been The Gage. The eggs Benedict is awesome! Fresh and tasteful. Roasted potatoes with cheese is just the right, not too much strong or too light. Love the environment most."
"Monday night ... after a huge tradeshow at McCormick place; dinner at 8pm with only a 20 minute wait.  Host/ess station alerts people by text message ... hard to hear for me in the bar, but that was very minor.  Good beer selection on tap. As an 'Irish Gastropub' it seemed fitting that Guinness was on tap.  Dinner began 2 orders of oysters.  2 different oyster types (sorry - don't remember) but both were VERY fresh and the liquor was preserved in each shell; this is one measure of quality of the shucker and kitchen.  Dinner was Venison Burgers, Pork T-Bone with sides of heirloom baby carrots and shishido peppers.  I cannot speak to the Pork, but that was downed quickly and apparently perfectly cooked with a very slight pink center.Venison burgers which include 30% beef fat were spectacularly good; good char, bun was tasty and soft, but personally, I would have preferred to not have the mustard aoli.  I did not think the aoli was a good complement to the already perfectly tasty burger.  It was maybe over portioned, but I thought it took away from the essence of the venison flavor profile.Wine pairing was very good; l'Ecole syrah.  Coffee at the end was also very good.  Service was consistent and competent.  Overall, a very reliable destination on the most famous Michigan Avenue strip."
Today's Fish and Chips was amazing! They suggested a house ginger beer for my 7 month pregnant wife and she's loving it! Can't wait to come back!
The food was not inexpensive but both the food and service were fantastic.  Recommend it for either a business dinner or a date.
"amazing gin cocktail, sublime garlic soup, crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside fish and chips all coupled with spectacular service.   thank you dudey, thank you matthew cortez.  these reasons and more are why i keep coming back to the gage, over and over and over...."
"3.5menu is standard, nothing too exciting but executed well. service was spotty and being seated, even with reservations, was slow. not sure why but we weren't in a rush either.great location but service could be improved upon.poutine fries could be a meal itself. i honestly/truly encourage it. its big enough and hearty enough. so freakin good.ORDER: waitstaffJEANS: ok - i saw some in shorts but im sure its inevitable being by one of the most popular toursit attractions"
Awesome food.  Presentation was as great as the taste :) Haven't been disappointed yet by this place.  I got a Pan Roasted Sablefish.  It was perfectly cooked.Only reason why I'm giving this place a 4/5 is because the waitress was very rude for from the start. Not sure if she just wanted to get home but she was being really pushy with us ordering and just had an attitude the whole time.
"My twin sister and I celebrated our birthday together at The Gage because it was close to my sisters office.  From the moment we walked in, to the second we were seated, we were well taken care of.  Amanda, our server, was all smiles from beginning to the end.  We were taking a long lunch and we didn't feel rushed at all like she was ready to flip the table.Definitely going back and getting the Swiss cheese burger!"
"Could not believe such fast service on a busy Friday night! We were in, had drinks and dinner, and were out in an hour (though we didn't feel rushed). We came for the beer and there's a good selection of domestic beers on draft from around the country and some good imports too. We had the fish & chips - nice and flaky fish great batter and excellent fries w/ some malt vinegar - and also the pasta of the day which was a tasty and interesting autumn ravioli incorporating Harissa and mint and roasted vegetables. Overall nice traditional pub fare plus. Was pretty noisy in the front dining area near the bar, it was packed, we had to lean in over the table to talk. The historic tin ceiling and lovely subway tiles on the walls do the acoustics no favors. Welcoming staff and a good experience, would definitely go again."
"I could still dream about the Duck Fat Poutine. Everything else at the restaurant was a blur and not so memorable. I made reservations on a Wednesday night at 7:30pm the day of. My date and I got there a lot earlier than expected, I think around 6:45pm but they were able to accommodate us and seat us earlier at 7. Our waiter seemed nice and upbeat when he was introducing the specials for that day, but after he asked us if we wanted any drinks and we just wanted water, he was not happy or attentive with us the rest of the night. Honestly, I thought the bus boys were working harder for the tip than the waiter. I had the fish and chips dish because other reviews had raved about it and the other entrees didn't look appetizing; however I was very disappointed in the fish and chips. Not worth the $20 for something that I could get better and cheaper at a local pub in a beach city. It is in a great location, super close to Millenium Park and the Art Institute."
"Oh my goodness. I can't say enough good things about this place. I came here just hoping for a simple dinner and beer after my conference, not in the mood to drift too far from my hotel. This was one of the best decisions I made on my trip to Chicago! Their beer list is really fun, and I got to work my way through several Chicago-brewed beers. As for dinner, I tried the scallop appetizer... It rocked my world! Perfectly cooked scallops surrounded by a little bit of Korean bbq ... It was insanely good!! This was actually good enough to be a meal on it's own. But after a couple of hours I must admit I also tried the duck confit poutine. Now I have never really understood the appeal of poutine, but I finally get it! This was a wonderful twist, and although incredibly greasy, it was fantastic. I can't recommend this place strongly enough!!"
"We were told about this place by a friend and had to check it out....so glad we did! Bloody Mary's are divine, as are the hamburgers and the mushroom sandwich."
Venison burger is to die for! Corned need hash was also tasty. Bloody Mary was only okay. Everything else was delicious!
"Came here with a big group so we didn't get a chance to order from the big menu. Service was very good and our group had a nice time in the private room downstairs.The food just doesn't match though. The scallops were uneventful and the substitute, some cauliflower was almost a little undercooked and was just a big ol' piece of cauliflower.  Eh. The steak that was served next was all sorts of rare -- when I had asked for medium.  I'm ok with a little red, but this bordered on the too rare side in the middle.  The dessert of creme brûlée was good. No issues there.So, would I come back with a group? Sure. But was unimpressed with what they served this time around."
"Fancy, upscale. Have had better food. Ambience classy. Don't miss the scotch egg and died pickles."
My friend and I waited about 15 minutes to eat dinner here. I got the fish and chips with a strawberry blond. The fish and chips were so juicy and tender. I loved the complimentary bread. Make sure to ask the server for the wifi password. There is no service inside!
"Great food and fabulous drinks! I had a fish second course, smoked sturgeon, and soup of the day. But the Gage Old Fashioned and Cognac Alexander really made the visit memorable. I should have taken pics! We had reservations through OpenTable,  and because of a very brief wait upon arrival, received a lovely prosecco from the manager for our trouble. The service was wonderful,  without being obtrusive. Definitely a special night, but make a reservation! It is deservedly  popular!"
This place was great! I went right around six and it was packed so I stood around the bar until I could get a seat. The bartender knew his shit and recommended the peking duck two ways. Probably the best duck I've had to date. Their Moscow mule with bitters and spices walnut liquor I could drink all day long. Love the upscale pub setting. Only thing I could do without is the amount of douche bags in suits that seem to flock there.
Food was just okay. Not quite worth the price and the menu was confusing. When I asked about the set up of the menu i Duffy get a very clear answer.
"Good, unique food.  Venison burger was delish. Our server Michael was courteous, prompt, and made good suggestions. Will return."
"Found on yelp, this time the reviews lived up to it...Great locale.Slick atmosphere.Quality micro-brews on tap.Craft cocktails, our waitress (from Romania) provided excellent recommendations.I had the scallops and they were very tasty.Would definitely recommend and would do a return visit."
"Food: I ordered their southern chicken and biscuit off of their brunch menu. The portion size was pretty decent, not too big, not too small. The more important thing was that it tasted good. They have a small but decent selection of craft beer. The only bad thing I can say is that the craft beers were a bit pricey. They have plenty of other alcohol to choose from if beer is not your thing.Service: The bartender provided excellent service. He was very quick in taking my orders and attentive to my drinking and dining needs.Location: This gastropub is conveniently located on Michigan Ave, in the Loop, just across the Cloud Gate. This place is very easy to get to if you're staying in the Loop or taking the train. This might not be the best place to watch a game on TV since they only have two TV's."
"Love it. They not only let us split a venison burger, they plated both servings really nicely for us. Great service!"
"Great Gastropub- Excellent Beer selection, many ""current"" hot beers on draft. We just had a few apps and then had a private meal in the cellar- Had a steak that was not cooked. Had to send it back to the kitchen for more fire. I'd give it another try next time I am in ChiTown, then re-evaluate. In the meantime its only a ""3"" in my book. Maybe I just ordered the wrong items..."
"Great service, great food, GREAT Bellinis. 10/10 would go back."
"Finally had a chance to dine here. Was very positively impressed by friendly service, delicious food, good  local beers and general atmosphere. Definitely a place to go. Menu has interesting choices like homemade chicken sausage and shaved potato salad. They have 3 different menus: breakfast, lunch and dinner. Can't wait to try all of them!"
"Oh God, please send me a burger as tasty as the one I tried at the Gage.#NOTKIDDING"
"The Gage is an aesthetically appealing restaurant space and always has an exciting menu. I love that it has several different eating spaces, including a bar, separate rooms with glass door/window partitions, and the whole other bar and private party space in the basement. The most recent visit, I was finally reminded why it just doesn't hit 5 stars for me despite my love affair with the building and menu (and service is great too) - it is just so loud in there! It doesn't matter whether it's lunch or dinner, you are about 6 inches away from constantly-busy tables on all sides of you and you are going to have to yell to your dining companion(s).They have unique takes on classic menu items, like venison burgers, and fantastic preparations of more tried-and-true options, like cheese plates, fish and chips, and duck breast. My personal favorite is the duck breast for dinner - it was prepared to perfection. For lunch, they offer soup and sandwich combos as well as heartier entrees. I've heard great things about the sausage plate, but personally loved my chicken & orzo soup + half of the smoked salmon BLT sandwich. The smoked salmon had some sort of seasoning that made it ""pop"" more so than normal.This definitely is more of a special occasion dining option (for me, for now at least :) ) but I would highly recommend it for either lunch or dinner in the loop. It doesn't matter your companions - friends, colleagues, significant others - it's perfect for all! Just make sure to make a reservation."
"Not sure how I've missed reviewing this spot since I not only send people here when they are looking for recommendations in the area, but I've eaten here a ton of times!I always like the Gage, though it seems to be getting more popular by the minute, so it's always getting more crowded.  At lunch, it's easy enough to get in (easy as the wait isn't an hour....but not super fast).  Service is always good and the food - you can't go wrong!At dinner, things heat up - I think partly due to the suit-clad happy hour-ers who visit after work and then decide to sit down.  Recently, on a weeknight around 9pm, there were almost no spots in the bar (well, I vultured a table when someone left) and there was a wait for dinner.  So, if you are willing to get a reservation or wait a bit, definitely do so as you won't be disappointed here.The food is always good - I've had a wide variety of lunch and dinner items as well as appetizers and drinks.  Service is efficient yet friendly and it's nice to not be upsold on wine and food.  The atmosphere is great - I love the subway tile and in the summer, the outdoor space is really enjoyable if you want to sit on Michigan Ave while enjoying some food.Definitely a great restaurant.Food - 4Atmosphere - 5Value - 3Service - 5Bathrooms - 3 (attendant?! really???)"
"The Gage was really surprised me!! Originally, I just wanna booked a place to have a dinner near our hotel of Chicago, I never imaged that we can get so amazing food at all.They are located near Millennium Park, it is very convenient to get some food after your visit. The Gage has large interior seats area and some outdoor tables. Their interior decoration style is between industrial style and modern british pub style. It should be a little bit formal restaurant, but for us, we were just jeans and T-shirt causal style, it was ok. We got one glass of Riesling from Michigan to share. It was so sweet, but it was good for pair any dish. Scotch Egg as appetizer was cool, I lived in UK before, but I never saw this sort of egg in UK. Ground pork cover over the whole egg and then to be the crispy style, it was special. Scallops as the other appetizer was great. There were three big scallops which had been grilled two face become brown but middle of scallops were still so juicy. This was our favorite!!!Chicken Breast as main dish to be shared. It was ok, not too dry. But I loved its side, broccoli was grilled perfectly and some sauce around chicken breast and broccoli was also great.Overall, this was a nice experience in The Gage, it was also a great memory for us in Chicago."
"Had a delicious dinner here on a Saturday night when visiting from Ireland. Really enjoyed the busy atmosphere, great food and friendly staff. The restaurant is laid out very well. It wasn't until we were leaving we noticed the bar area, and how busy it was there. Decided to stop for a drink on the way out and ended up staying the whole night. It's rare to find somewhere that is a top restaurant and blends seamlessly with its bar area too. Nice crowd and would visit again."
"Came here for a Saturday brunch and left feeling as if it was a very uneven meal. The atmosphere was great - upscale yet casual, and the service was also good. So it was just the food that was all over the place. The food: Fried pickles - yum! My first time trying these. I'd recommend.Sausage entree - they make their own sausage in house, and while it was good I couldn't help feel as if the meal should have had something else with it. It comes with friend potatoes with melted brie - but I couldn't eat it as I found the melted brie too... funky. I love brie usually, but melting it  killed it for me.Venison burger - Meat was delicious. But one of my pet peeves is when red onion is used with anything - you can't taste anything but the red onion! My friend ended up pulling out all the onion so he could actually taste the burger. I'd say this dish is worth a try but ask for no onions. And the fries it comes with are just ""meh"""
"Great steak, service and drinks.  Definite recommend for when you are ready to eat some great food.It is a crowded and noisy dining area.  I wouldn't take a group of more than 4 or you'll never hear the people at the other end of the table."
"Great atmosphere, food was above average, service a bit slow but it was very busy. Started with the Brie fondue which was very tasty and then had the fish n chips along with a salad. Fish n chips were above average, salad was outstanding.I'll go again too see if the service gets better when they're not as busy and try some of the other great looking menu items."
"Chose the Gage for its location and good reviews but I was quite disappointed. Reservations were for dinner at 8:00 on Sunday. Inside was very cold and empty, so we sat outside. Ordered the scallops to start which were delicious - highlight of the evening. Caesar salad was big and bland. Cocktails were good but not great and very expensive. My husband ordered the venison burger but they were out of venison.I asked for a wine list to choose a selection to go with dinner. Then dinner arrived but waitress was nowhere to be seen for more than 5 minutes. No one came to the table to see what was wrong. After that point service was very poor. Waitress was standoffish and cold for the rest of the evening. We left before dessert."
A friend and I ate on the patio for a late lunch on Saturday.  Our server was great!  I had the Handcrafted Sausage with potatoes and brie.  The sausage was ok but the potatoes were great.  My friend had the corn and brisket soup and a sandwich with fries.  She raved about the soup but didn't say much about the rest.  I definitely want to go back.  I wish they had a gf menu.
"Now after having lived in the area for a few years, I can upgrade my rating: I don't come often as it is pricier, but this is perhaps the classiest bar in the Loop with a very mixed crowd of visitors and locals (more visitors at peak times), a great place to meet people for a drink/snack, and a great brunch menu.  Nice historical building, and the seating goes way back, more than you expect.  Nice for a quick special treat in the loop but I would perhaps avoid peak times when you can barely walk through the bar area at all."
"This is a fantastic location, great atmosphere, lots of seating, attentive staff and most importantly exquisitely delicious food.  We came here with a coupon and because it was a short walk from where we were.  We were immediately greeted and seated at 1:30 for lunch.  The place was quite full at this time with tables of small and large groups.  Our server was prompt and recited all the wonderful lunch specials.  It's a relatively small menu but all selections sounded delicious.  The wonderful part of a pleasantly packed establishment is, as we are walked to our table I can scope out all the food that others have already received.  I'm a total look-y-loo in restaurants and, yep, I'm the one that has pointed to your plate and told the waiter ""I'll have what she's having."" instead of figuring out what you have on my own.  No shame here when it comes to getting the deliciousness I want.  This place is a visual orgasm when it comes to looking at what others have... oh-my-goodness!!!  It all looks fabulous... so it really didn't help me decide what to order but I was excited to get served.I got the pork belly sandwich on marble rye.  It was a special.  The fries were great, the meat was cooked well and flavorful, the lettuce and tomato were fresh, pickled grilled onions delicious, egg cooked to perfection and bread toasted adding the perfect final flare to this delicious creation.  Even the ketchup seemed homemade or somehow more flavorful than other places... but that could all be in my head....We also ordered the buffalo chicken 1/2 sandwich with chips and the soup of the day which was potato asparagus.  Also all delicious, even the soup which was mild yet flavorful... made all the more delicious when I added chips for a nice crunch,Lastly we ordered the corn and blueberry dessert... actually I did but I like to say ""we"" since it sounds better for my waistline.  Not exactly what I expected but quite tasty.  The corn ice cream was very mild, the blueberries were fresh and in a sauce that wasn't too sweet and the muffin shaped cake this was served with was amazing... moist and tasty.  YUM.Prices were not bad.  Sandwich with soup and chips was $13, pork belly was like $15, dessert was $10... salads were large and cost $13-18, entrees went into the twenties.  Wait time was appropriate for meals being prepared fresh to order.  I would highly recommend this place and wouldn't hesitate to order anything off the menu.  I would even return without a coupon... and that says a lot coming from me."
We had the House Poutine to start off and the duck was so delicious it melted in your mouth.  We also had the Seared Nantucket Sea Scallops which were cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious.  I had the Fish & Chips while the others had burgers - everyone was completely satisfied with their entrees.  The service was what moved this up from 4 to 5 stars...our waiter Kevin was very knowledgeable about the food and beer and overall the staff were all very friendly.  Double Thumbs Up!
"Went there last night, as usual, it was fantastic. The poutine was delicious. I ordered the chicken breast so tasty.  My wife ordered the fish and chips. I'm pretty certain they serve the best fish and chips anywhere"
"I will first say that the smoked ham benedict was good and so were the potatoes, but the drink I had was way too sweet and the menu is confused. They have Mexican dishes at an Irish Gastropub? I've lived in England and not seen such inconsistency. The servers were really nice, but for a $70-$90 brunch for two people with one drink each, I'd rather go somewhere cheaper and quaint in Wicker Park or Bucktown."
"My team and I came here for dinner following a long day of business meetings. We ordered a handful of things from the menu: beet salad, mussels vindaloo, sea scallops, charred green beans, and the special for the day which was a fish entree. By far one of the best restaurant outings we've had to date. Our waitress was excellent at describing every item we asked about and she make excellent suggestions. The food came out timely, cooked to perfection and needless to say we have raved about everything that we ate. Also, for dessert we had the corn and blueberries compote along with the peanut butter french silk pie. Like our starters and entree, the desserts did not disappoint. This is a must for anyone visiting Chicago and looking for an upscale meal in a trendy place. Will definitely return again!"
"I keep thinking about this food: the fried pickles, the mixed greens salad (with charred romaine that was so good i couldn't believe it was green or a vegetable, let alone a green vegetable), the fish and their chips . . . Wow. I would go back just for pickles and that mixed greens salad. Ooh, and maybe dessert, since I didn't have any room this visit! Great service, yummy everything, including bread and drinks . . . the only annoying thing about the evening was that over the phone when we were on our way, the host didn't say they had valet--he gave the address for ""their garage,"" so we were looking for an entrance to a parking structure instead of the University Club."
Doesn't leave an impression... Guess 3 star is fair.
"Had an early dinner here yesterday. Upscale pub fair. Sat on the big patio and watched all of the Lolla- goers pass us by. Nice beer list- loved the Moody Tongue, Paw Paw- light fruity without being too fruity summer beer. I got the fish & chips, hubby got the venison burger and we shared- both were great. Only downside is the patio didn't get any sun in the late afternoon. The restaurant was right across from Millennium Park and not the least bit touristy. Would definitely go again."
"I'd heard good things and was not disappointed. I had my in-laws in the city. We finished off the obligatory walk to the Bean just before lunch. That made The Gauge a perfect location. The cocktails were well selected and prepared. The facility is gorgeous. I had been looking forward to trying the house made sausage. While very good, it continues to show those Germans and Eastern Europeans know a few things about sausage we haven't learned. The other food we had was excellent and we all had a good time."
Fish and chips was disappointing. I might expect too much but the fish was pretty dry and I could definately tell it was frozen fish.
"Menu was small but diverse and with a good selection of choices. As every other review on yelp in regards to this restaurant the food was OUTSTANDING and the service was good. Make rsvp ahead of time , very popular and gets PACKED so plan ahead."
Spent the evening here while wife and kids went to the One Direction concert. So onlyHad drinks...Nice tap selection with local crafts and decent bottle selection.Spirits selection was excellent with a nice rare cabinet if bourbons and scotch.Excellent service and ambiance.
This is great place to take Clients for a work dinner and drinks. Great food at great price. Would totally go back to this place!
"Update... We had our first Brunch there.  Excellent and their Brunch Punch was awesome, but potent for 2 people since it comes as a pitcher for $40.  I had the crab which had egg and great hollandaise sauce...  Darja was our server and did great for us....also love the outdoor ambience.....check it out"
"Great option for a pre-Symphony Center dinner!It seems small and narrow but don't let that fool you, this place goes on forever! Reminds me of a fancy European metro station with the green tiles and decorated ceiling. Nice bathroom setup :)FOOD:Appetizers came out ridiculously fast considering it was 6:30 on a Friday. Service in general was very good.Lamb meatballs: delicious with fantastic combination of several saucesFried pickles: hard to mess this up, but was also good - enjoyed the very minimal amount of breading.Smoked antelope tartare: Can't say antelope has a particularly unique flavor in this case, but an enjoyable dish. I think the tartare could have been chopped finer - the texture was bit chewy. Loved all the flavorings - fun presentation that you can mix to your preference (including a quail egg).Bison short ribs: fell off the bone, but in my opinion, wasn't a very exciting dish (carrots/potato puree...meh) ... however, my husband LOVED the meat.DRINKS:They make house-made sodas! Get a glass of the blood orange. Order a shot of vodka and ice on the side. Make your own drink. EnjoyAlthough I love Malbec, I was not a fan of the French Malbec they carry (by the glass) - tastes like old oak barrels."
"Came here for my 10-year anniversary. Food was pretty decent. The Market Fish had parsley root Purée, braised red cabbage, pomegranate brown butter, it was awesome. The Moroccan spiced veg pot pie was a little doughy. They didn't mention this until after we started eating it, however since it's a vegan dish they sub coco oil for butter, wasn't a big fan. Curry fries were great. Overall, the ambience and location made it such a nicer experience. I would go back and try some new plates."
great restaurant!!!I ordered the mushroom sandwich and corn soup (1/2 sandwich and soup) and my boyfriend ordered the venison burger; both delicious!!  service was fantastic.  seems like a great spot for all meals and libations!
"Brunch here is awesome! Loved it! Came here with six of us. Had to make reservations too which I recommend. Called Saturday for Sunday brunch and only 1pm was available so we took it. It was perfectly located across millenium park. So we all had the fried devil eggs which was awesome! Never had fried devil eggs and I highly recommend it. Also shared the alaskan king crab mac and cheese...so good!! For entrees, my friends ordered the lobster roll - which they said was delicious, fish and chips - also a must try, crab cake - portion was a bit small, eggs benedict - played it safe and I had the pork belly burger. Now I need to talk about my burger. I was expecting a pork belly burger, not pork belly on top of my beef burger patty. This is a lot of meat for a pub burger. I couldn't finish it but I can tell you it was freaking delicious."
"So today was ""Friends Lunch Day"" with one of my colleagues. She selected a restaurant at which neither one of us had previously dined. My colleague had the Scallops Waldorf - Three large pan seared scallops served atop a bead of varied lettuces, mostly arugula, apple butter, walnuts, celery, Fuji apple, and bacon raisin vinaigrette. She attests hat the dish was as delectable as it was eye pleasing. I delved into the Traditional Creole Gumbo due to my Louisiana heritage, and was not disappointed. It is noteworthy that every table I observed had at least on bowl in the group of dinners. It was a big star, and quite worthy of being in such demand. The Jumbo Gulf Shrimp and Andouille sausage were plentiful in the generously proportioned entrée, and the Okra (not my favorite vegetable) was not at all slimy or overpowering as is so often the case when this dish is not properly prepared. Kudos to the chef! OUTSTANDING! She selected two deserts for us to share - strawberry shortcake and chocolate peanut butter layer cake. These are not your grandma's desserts; they're better if you get my drift. What unique preparations of these truly decadent desserts. The service was perfect; not over bearing, but attentive none the less. This is an establishment that I most assuredly will return to--5 stars!"
"I love this place! My boyfriend and I have been coming here for 8 years. Its always a favorite of mine when asked for good Michigan Ave restaurants.  I love the brie fondue, the fish and chips are phenomenal, I always order a side of the curry sauce to dip the fries in. Last time we came here the server split everything for us so we could enjoy our meal even more. We also ordered the smoked sturgeon and almost fought for the last few pieces of the fish. The decor is wonderful and the service is always great."
"The food at the Gage was pretty good but nothing spectacular. I had the buffalo sandwich and my friend had the sausage plate, but nothing about our meals was particularly satisfying that makes me want to go back and eat the same thing or try something else on the menu. I will say however, the patio is really nice. The way they separate the seating from the busy sidewalk of Michigan avenue is awesome. You can totally forget you're in one of the most touristy areas of Chicago when you're there. Also, another bonus - the staff is incredibly friendly. In the end, a good place to check out at some point, but if you're a foodie, it's not an immediate need. A great option though when you're in the Loop."
"Terrific service.  Creative delicious drinks.  Had the fondue, scallops and duck.  All were perfect.  10 minute walk to the symphony."
Great friendly service for seated quick food tastes great bathrooms were awesome good drink selection for beer and wine. Had the charcuterie bias poutine fries mussels vindaloo pot pie etc very good was all of it. Nothin I didn't like. Would come back to try other stuff.
I travel to Chicago for business on occasion and always stay in the loop. The Gage is s standard for me. I love the Sunday brunch menu best. Get the burger; it's delicious. They make a tasty shepherds pie too.
We came here for the first time for our anniversary and we were treated so well! The restaurant treated us to a champagne toast. The staff was very friendly. The beer selection was great and the fish and chips were amazing. Burger was pretty good. Had a couple small problems with our order but it was resolved. Ambience had a nice city vibe to it.  Will definitely come back.
"Elk, rabbit, venison, antelope, escargot... [eyes doubletake at the menu]Don't let its touristy surroundings deter you from some serious gastropub eats across from the Bean. I for one was excited and pleasantly surprised to venture out into some of their more ""exotic"" dinner stuff.   Let me tell you that my date LOVED the bread they brought out. So much that he asked for a second loaf. Came out hot and crispy, it was a bread service dream. Their house poutine with elk ragout and curds was stick-to-your-ribs decadent. I don't recommend this dish if you're trying to make a good first impression because I was making a MESS between handling the chunky fries and the melted, cheesy curd strings. Delicious, but perhaps I hadn't quite mastered the art of silverware elegance on fries.  The scotch egg seemed like one of their signatures so we decided to try it. Great execution but not something I would order again, since I guess I'm not a fan of hardboiled eggs-- despite having it breaded and fried. Although I did like the grainy mustard accompaniment.We ended our meal with their striped bass crudo. A little too chewy for my liking, but it was light and fresh. Would definitely return to try their burgers since we wanted to try different things and didn't want to limit ourselves to the heftiness of their ""Regular"" and ""Venison"" offerings.Great for pre/post Symphony munchies, wining-n-dining clients, whispering sweet nothings on a romantic date, settling in with friends/coworkers for brews, or just for the heck of saying, ""Hey, I just had smoked antelope the other night!"""
"Really disappointed with how things went here.  I had seen the great Yelp reviews for The Gage and made a reservation before our trip to Chicago, planning for brunch here to be our last meal before heading home.These people are incredibly rude and non-accommodating, a complete contrast from literally every other great dining experience we had in Chicago.I'll spare everyone details but this place was a joke.  They were on strike #5 by the time we were seated and then no waiter comes to great us or bring us water in over 10 minutes.We could hear everyone around us complaining about their Bloody Mary's, their food, and about being neglected too.We took advantage of the time and made reservations at another restaurant up the block where we had a friendly staff, dined out doors, and enjoyed our food."
Great atmosphere... Good service... And you've got to try the Gage Burger.. Excellent
"Dined in the bar area late last night. Despite how busy it was on a Friday night, service was pretty great! We arrived around 11:30pm, and was able to grab a table, but can definitely see reservations would be the way to go if we were having dinner at a normal hour.I had some stiff vodka sodas along some of the best scallops I've ever had. I'm pretty particular when it comes to seafood, so I was ecstatic to find them perfectly cooked! Would definitely come back :)Took 1 star off due to being out of the rainbow trout salad I initially wanted, in addition to running out of the piece of short rib that was supposed to come with my scallops!"
"The gage was packed at 5:30 on Friday. Not sure if it's the location or if it's really just a popular spot. We were visiting and have it a shot. The bar took a while to get a drink but it was good when it came. We tried the poutine for an appetizer. While it was good, it's a tad heavy for a starter. I had the venison burger for dinner and a salad. It was tasty but I don't think id have the same again.  Maybe a regular burger next time."
"I was staying at the Palmer House on business and wanted to have a decent meal the night before my conference began. There aren't a lot of dining choices and I decided I might as well try sitting at the bar at the Gage even though a colleague had not been able to get a table for any hour over several days on Open Table. I walked in, was instantly and politely seated, the bartender spread a folded white napkin as my placemat and I was on my way. I had the fried pickles and venison burger, both of which were massive but excellent. (Had some help with the pickles fortunately.) A small but solid list of draft beers, including a good double IPA. Service was just what it should be at the bar... not ""I'm Tiffany I'll be your server"" intrusive but there when I needed them. Watched a game on the TV and felt like I was at the corner pub, just with better food and white tablecloths. Sweet."
"I was here at Lunchtime and as I came alone I preferred to eat at the bar.It wasn't as touristy as I expected, as it is right at the bean.Ambiance 5/5*Nice place, with cotton napkins and nice people. Not too fancy. Service 7/5*The bartender was great!!! Helpful, courteous, polite, unobtrusive, efficient and although he had a lot to do he took his time for some chats with me! 13 Degrees Cocktail 6/5!!!It was delicious and perfectly presented!Venison Burger (with Avocado instead of Jalapeños) 5/5Yummy and a lot to eat. The Burger was served in perfection, the meat as I love it! TASTE EXPLOSION! I sure will return! Already LOVE this place!!!"
"Had reservations for 6 on a Monday night. Our table was ready promptly and we were seated in booth type table, which was ideal for our group. Service was excellent. I had the regular burger and it was perfect. Very flavorful, cooked to order and the bun was delicious. The fries were also good. Everybody on the table enjoyed their dishes. We had a few desserts but none were anything special. All in all, great experience."
"I was here for a private party, so I can't really comment on the actual restaurant. I really enjoyed our salad and dessert. It was a really nice place, great location."
"This is a definite must-try if you haven't been. I had the duck breast which was excellent. My vegetarian friend raved about her pasta dish. The pork chop looked amazing. The place has a cool vibe, and it manages to be high end without feeling stuffy. Love it."
The food was amazing! Had a tomato bisque with a smoked brisket sandwich! The brisket was smoked for 24hrs and was just amazing! Also the service was great...a must if you are in the city!
"I went here for my birthday and was hoping to get to try their whiskey flight, which I heard from other reviewers of this place.  So I was very excited and was eager to try it.  As you enter the place, the ceilings were very tall and it looked opened, but it looked very packed, since it was a Friday night.  So definitely to do a reservation for the weekend.  My girlfriend has been here before and during the weekday, it is not as hectic.The bar was so cool to look at because there was so many different types of alcohols, spirits, etc.  We were sitting there for a little bit because we are waiting for our table to be ready, even though we had a reservation.  For us, we weren't that in a hurry so we had a good time sitting at the bar.  As in other reviewer's review, the bartender definitely does a great job of trying to find alternative selection of a classic or the usual cocktails that you are used to.  My gf wanted something similar to a Moscow Mule but instead of the vodka and the bartender had a recipe that included a ginger beer and made something similar to it and she was very pleased with the end product.So the food was your gastropub type of cuisine and it was very interesting of having a rack of elk.  Very tender and delicious!  So in regards to this whiskey flight, well it didn't existed :(  So I believe it was the floor manager that night, where the waiter that I was speaking to in regards about if they had a whiskey flight and apologized that there was no such thing, came by and explained to me the situation.  They used to offer whiskey flight, but they no longer had it available, but explained to me that he would create a flight for me!!! Awesome!!  So I was able to taste 4 different types of whiskey that night and they were all phenomenal!! Unfortunately, it was kind of loud, so I was unable to get the names of the whiskey and share them with the rest of the world, I apologize :(Overall, I give this place a 5 star because it is definitely a cool place to eat if you are visiting Chicago.  Definitely will recommend to people who enjoys wines, spirits, and alcohol.  Food is great and most of all, the service was very great!  I hope that this review had been enjoyable and giving you an insight of this great place!!Cheers!!"
"I had reservations on a Tuesday night for a celebratory dinner with my family. After 20 minutes we FINALLY got a table. We were treated dismissively by an extremely slow wait staff. They messed up our order and the food we got was overpriced and mediocre at best. When leaving we mentioned to the manager that we did not have a good experience. The manager proceeded to become defensive and confront us as ""rude."" I have never been treated so poorly by management and wait staff in life. If I could give negative stars, I would. And my momma raised me right, I know the difference between a table knife and a butter knife. Apparently the staff at The Gage does not. Avoid at all costs, because it will cost you plenty."
Jen the bartender is awesome.  Loved the poutine!  This still remains my top five in the downtown area.
"Good was good. Solid. Recommended: duck fries, the venison burger, curry fries. The scotch egg was good too, as were the fish and chips. This place was pretty busy for after work happy hour time. If in the area, try this place ... It's better than other tourist places in the area."
"To celebrate our wedding, my sister and brother in-law paid for my wife and I to go to this restaurant, and we couldn't have been happier they chose this place. The atmosphere was wonderful and reminded me of what a bar would've appeared like in Chicago in the 1920's/30's. We sat at the bar for a drink while waiting for our table and the bartender was very helpful and created a delicious cucumber martini for my wife. When we were called to be sat down, we asked the bartender for their advice and they shot out two different main course dishes, The Venison Burger and the Elk Chops (I will further explain their excellence shortly). Once we were sat down at our table, our waitress quickly came to the table to see if we needed any drinks. While getting them for us, the bar manager came to the table to introduce himself to us and congratulate us on our recent nuptials (something that isn't often done in the dining industry anymore). After chatting with us, the manager left and the waitress came back with our cocktails and guided us on an appetizer to have, The House Poutine. We ordered that, a dozen oysters, the burger and Elk, as well as a side of carrots served in a chimchurri sauce.First to come out was the House Poutine, and wow is the only word that can describe my reaction. My wife and I gobbled it up due to its deliciousness and were informed by our waitress afterwards that they had won with that dish two years in a row for the Chicago Poutine festival (I believe that 100%). The oysters were extremely fresh and delicious as well, but the real fun came with the main course.The Venison Burger, a first time trying this meat in burger form for my wife and I, was extremely juicy and well cooked and left a great aftertaste in your mouth, the type that makes your mouth water and yearning to have more of what you just ate. The Elk fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. The carrots, (recommendation by our waitress, were so well cooked that they too had that mouth watering effect on the both of us. We finished the meal and needless to say we were stuffed, but we could NOT forget desert :-)We decided on a Peanut Butter French Silk Pie, and one bite made us both look into each others eyes with a feeling of satisfaction. The bar manager returned to see how the meal was and let us know that the dessert was on the house and congratulated us again on our wedding.Fantastic dinner and great service and staff. I would definitely recommend anyone and everyone go to this establishment!"
"Trendy more on the high-end. One Bartender is a little friendlier than most. Setting is quite stuffy, even the patronage we re stuffy, except this one guy we were talking to. Otherwise, you're paying for location"
"This place is nice to go out on a date night or an anniversary night. It's funny with this place because I pass by it  so many times and always want to try it and I am glad I did. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.  Good food, good service.  Must try !!"
I took my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner. (Her choice).It was a very nice experience. The service was truly very nice. Our waitress was perfect.We were seated within a few minutes of our reservation but we were early so we had a drink at the bar.  Bartender didn't really offer any personal attention when GF asked what the specials menu said and walked away.   Another bartender was much more attentive and we had a nice drink. They had a moderate variety. For appetizers we had mussels and poutine which were delicious. The entrees were good but not amazing.  I had the coffee rubbed pork and she had the half chicken.The portion sizes were much larger than you'd expect. Overall 4 stars.Price was totally reasonable.
"Went hear from my boyfriend's birthday brunch. It was awesome! I had a bloody Mary and the poutine (the fries, cheese and sausage) delicious. The lobster roll was equally impressive, lots of lobster. Sat outside on the patio and enjoyed some people watching. A bit noisy because of the traffic. Needless to say, this is a perfect brunch on a perfect day."
"A girlfriend insisted that I couldn't leave Chicago without coming here. She claimed it's in her top 5 all time favorite and most memorable meals. She made me promise I would get the Scotch egg and the venison carpaccio. One of two isn't bad. They didn't have the venison carpaccio on the menu, but they did have a venison burger - holy mother of gawd....this has to be one of the best burgers I've ever had. True story. It was so full of flavor, perfectly cooked and just well, insane. The crispy fries that came with it were just as perfect. Paired with an Oregon pinot, it was blissful.My bf is obsessed with all things french, so we started with the house poutine with smoked wild boar ragoût, pickled red onion and cheese curds. omg...so amazing...so rich...and so my new last meal on earth. Stupid-good!We also had a side of brussell sprouts with pork belly. Usually I prefer my sprouts roasted and crispy, but these were soft and most likely blanched and sauteed. I still loved them. Oh, and the scotch egg. I had never had one, but it's been on my to-try list. Super delicious! Paired with greens and a simple dollop on yellow mustard. Killer wine and beer list, excellent service by a the cutest waiter with a darling mid-western accent and an all around great vibe. It was packed at 2:00 for lunch on a random Thursday and I can see why. Love. Love. Love."
"Good lunch here during our visit to Chicago. The space is quite pretty and the bar area is very nice. We ordered the Scotch Egg to start and both got burgers (I got the ""Not a Diet"" one with the pork belly) and a side of bacon. The scotch egg was unfortunately not as good as hoped. The yolk was not as runny as it should be. My burger was slightly overcooked as well, but had a nice flavor overall. The side of bacon was quite plentiful and cooked perfectly and my side salad and the husband's fries were very nice. Nice brunch though, maybe just an off day with the execution on the food."
"Stopped in late for a drink & food during the Stanley Cup.  Nice atmosphere with friendly servers.  Ordered some cocktails, nothing special, but the Venison Burger was delicious.  Cooked medium-well, this had to be one of the tastiest burgers I have ever had.  With a side of fries & roasted baby carrots, this was the perfect meal to split with my colleague for a late night snack.If I lived in the area, I would certainly return to try dinner but I am only in town this week.  Stop in to The Gage & order the Venison Burger!!!"
"Had a great meal!  Started with Poutine, had a salmon club, and finished off with champagne and dessert.  Highly recommended."
Amazing!! Must try duck confit poutine and lamb ribs.  The brewer at Moody Tongue jared Rouben recommended this place and it was a great one!! Very helpful bartender!!
"I can't begin to tell you how much I love this place. I'm a life long Chicago resident and I work close by and this is my favorite all around restaurant in the city. The food and drinks are outstanding and the menu selections will satisfy all appetites. The staff from the owner, managers, servers, bartenders to the bus boys go out of their way to make sure you are having a great experience. I recommend this place to everyone looking for a good meal or drink."
"Great place for dinner. A reservation will save you a 10-15 minute wait on an off night. Good place for a small group or date. Food is on the expensive side but well worth it. You should really start with the scallop dish- it's perfect!  I've never seen scallops paired with Korean BBQ short ribs and kim chi. I also had the venison burger and it's loaded with squash, mushrooms, jalapeño, roasted peppers and onions. Since onions are the devil, I take them off. I'd like to come back for a drink and fried pickles before I leave."
"Great service-they were great at anticipating needs and the flow of the meal was superb. Interesting menu items, great decor, good atmosphere! I would absolutely go back, and normally I don't love downtown places-this one had charm!"
"Amazing! Great location across from Millenium Park. I'm not going to bore you with my details since there are so many positive reviews. Know that we went without a reservation and were sat pretty promptly even on a Saturday...seemed odd because there were so many people and the hostess said at least 40 minutes.Food was AMAZING...EVERYTHING...here's what we got...House Poutine - YUM...literally rich in flavor.Smoke Antelope Tartare - Never had antelope but was like beef tartare. Flavorful and sweet.Braised Lamb Shank - The bone pulled right now...that's all I need to say, right?!?Okay maybe not everything...just small complaints here...the fish and chips were okay...but how good can fish and chips really get? Also, we didn't finish the escargot...don't know why but it was just okay? Also I ordered a moscow mule...and literally got lime juice with a hint a ginger? Definitely not the premium kind of ginger beer...and the vodka...either it was 10X distilled or they just didn't put a lot...*shrugs* I just ended up drinking some red."
"This place has a serious drink menu. Craft cocktails, tons of great local beers, unicorn wines... AND the food is great! What more could you want in a place?!I tried the What Diet? burger which I think is similar to the Pub Burger on their menu now, and it was just fantastic. One of the best burgers I've had. The house poutine, as everyone says, is da BOMB. I only wished I'd saved room for dessert, since they looked amazing as well... next time for sure! ;)"
"Stopped in here after a run for brunch on a Saturday, has some nice shaded outdoor seating. First, decor and setting was nice. The staff was pleasant and offered up some suggestions. Bloody mary hit the spot, and apparently the drink of the morning, Brunch Punch was a hit among our table. I had the smoked salmon on a bagel, and it was well above my expectations. I was expecting some kind of pathetic looking bagel just slapped together. I was wrong. The bagel comes with all the ingredients on the side. The salmon, cucumber, onions, tomatoes, capers, and cream cheese- all nicely presented as well. So you can make your bagel or just eat on the side.  It made for a nice relaxing brunch/lunch location, and priced accordingly. I am reserving the five star until I can visit again and try some more menu options. Definitely a good location to bring out of towners, or if you want to have a nice conversation with some good eats!"
Five Stars! I have been to The Gage a handful of times the past couple of years and have not been disappointed. The service is great and menu options are unique. Keep it up!
"4 and a half stars!!We went here for dinner after a concert at the CSO on a Fri night. We reached the restaurant at around 10:45 pm and it was still packed. It is a huge place and it was buzzing with activity even if it was that late. The food was fantastic. I have been to Henri next door, and I think I prefer the Gage better. It is a hip gastropub, but still elegant enough for a great dinner date. We ordered the Mascarpone leek ravioli with sides of grilled cauliflower and roasted heirloom carrots. The food was wonderful... delicious and lovingly prepared. I was not expecting to like the food so much, because I expected it to be more of a phenomenal drinks place, so I was pleasantly surprised. It loses half a star for the service. The service is a bit too slow and one note for such a hip place."
"This is a fun and trendy place to go if you're hanging out on Michigan Avenue! I enjoy their cocktails and the foods, though they are a bit pricey. The atmosphere is busy and fun, so go early or be ready to mingle with the crowds. My husband and I went just before Christmas and the decorations in the bar were so festive - I was definitely in the holiday spirit!"
I would say 4.5 as this place is really good and is perfect if your staying or doing business in Michigan avenue near the art institute.Works perfectly well for lunch or dinner.
"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon to celebrate the completion of an exam and man this was the right place to choose! Great beer selection and excellent food. We came during their brunch menu which really spans the full realm of breakfast and lunch items (not just the breakfast items that you find at some brunch spots).We both had the Gage Venison Burger - smoked gouda, fried jalapeno, mushrooms, pickled onion and mustard aioli - DEVINE! It was highly recommended by our waitress - which we thought was maybe due to the $17 price tag, but it lived up to her comments and to the price. On the side is even a red wine ketchup with pepper to dip the fries into. An overall palate pleasing dish. It should be noted, and we were happy we took the waitresses advice, it should be cooked rare! It's a very lean meat and the chefs definitely know how to prepare it properly. I look forward to coming back to the Gage when I'm back in Chicago.(On a side note, I did try to come a few other times for dinner during my trip, but the wait always looked quite long. On Saturday for brunch we were able to sit right away.)"
"- Ambiance (5/5)Upscale, chic vibe, with just enough of an edge.- Service (5/5)Top notch service.  Efficient.  Courteous.  Friendly.- Lyonnaise Salad, $13 (4/5)This was a very well composed salad, though it could have used just a tad more braised bacon.  Seriously now... don't skimp on the bacon!- Roasted Farm Chicken, $23 (4/5)This was a solid dish, though the lentils and root vegetables totally out-shined the chicken.  On the one hand, it means there were great sides; on the other hand, it means the chicken was just above average.  There was nothing stellar about it, and it wasn't the most juicy version I've had.  - Value (5/5)For the sophistication of the food, The Gage is actually very reasonably priced.  If the food were just slightly more memorable (a little more WOW!), this easily would have been 5 stars.  As it stands, it's still a great restaurant I wouldn't hesitate to recommend."
"I generally try to visit new restaurants each time I'm in Chicago, but The Gage has warranted return trips.  This is my absolute favorite gastropub, and possibly my favorite Chicago restaurant overall.  They have a great beer list, outstanding (not to mention filling) food, and some of the best service I've experienced.  It's a great location for just getting a drink or two, or you can really splurge and get a multi-course meal.If The Gage isn't on your restaurant hit-list for Chicago, it should be."
"While 4 stars doesn't seem enough, 5 stars doesn't seem fully right either. Can Yelp finally bring about the half and quarter star ratings please?Anyway, the Gage has been on my to do list for a good while. In fact it's one of my oldest bookmarks and I finally had the chance to take care of that. Well, the only thing I'm disappointed about is my inability to have come here sooner. I am extremely impressed with the Gage right from the start and I was only stopping in for Lunch. I had a tasting to go to in the general area, so a quick bite to eat and a beer was in order. I was slightly hesitant at first when I saw the beer prices, but you just have to roll with it. I ordered up a Weihenstephaner Vitus expecting it to come in a pilsner glass. To my happy surprise, I got a nice big ole chalice filled with German Bier goodness. Needless to say, my worries about the price went away fast when I saw that I basically got a .5L chalice filled with beer.Beer wasn't all I had though. I came here for the food really. The lunch menu had a lot of great options. It honestly took me a bit to finally decide on the fish n chips. There were maybe 4 or 5 options that I wanted, but I'm glad I settled on the fish n chips. I loved that the pieces of fish came in the classic newspaper cone. The fish was done perfectly as well. I was having a hard time not wolfing the fish down as it was that good. Their tartar sauce was perfect with this too. One can't forget to mention the chips in fish n chips. These were thicker cut steak fries, and that's how I like my fries. I have to finish things off talking about the service. It was completely spot on and you can tell these are quality bartenders. The bartender checked in on me when it was needed and it wasn't hard getting in an order. The Gage is a class establishment. I need to come here for dinner, but I am already left impressed and look forward to a return."
"Came here on a Monday night for an early dinner. While our waiter didn't appear to be very knowledgeable about the menu, the service was pleasant and quick. The atmosphere is lively and can get loud after 7pm. We ordered the pâté board, butter poached lobster, seafood chowder, the burger and farm chicken. While the waiter felt the butter poached lobster was too small for one person I felt it sufficient. It was served with roasted corn and fingerling potatoes and a curried lobster bisque. The pâté board was plentiful and perfectly balanced with pickled fennel and mustard."
"Had the crab cake brunch dish and I went to heaven. I came here on a Sunday morning and was seated in the bar area right away.  I deducted a star because the wait staff was a little rude.  Being from the Bar Area, the price for this brunch seemed reasonable and having the view of Centennial Park was great."
"I love the Gage for dinner (especially the venison burger), but now I've discovered it as my new go-to brunch spot whenever I have friends visiting from out of town.  Its prime location near Millennium Park is perfect when you have a day of tourist activities on the plate, and it takes reservations (a rarity in Chicago for brunch!).  The brunch food is reasonably priced and unique, and the place always cozy."
"I have been here for lunch a few times when I'm feeling a bit more fancy. The food has been solid. My last visit they had a trout soup that was different and delectable. I don't always spring for a lunch time beer but when I do, the Gage has a selection that fits the bill."
"The gage is one of the most overrated and overpriced restaurants in Chicago.  I""ve been here numerous times and never had a meal that impressed me.  The cheese platter appetizer is not worth getting and should be priced at $8 instead of $16.  during my last visit here, our appetizers and dinner came at the exact same time.  the burgers are ok and the fries are often times undercooked.  the drinks are extremely overpriced and filled with ice and barely any liquor.  the staff is not very friendly either.  I don't recommend going to the gage for lunch or dinner.  One of those typical places that think they are above everyone else because they have a good location."
"The best food, service, and we waited an hour and do worth it !!!The manager took special care of us, the dessert was out of this world. I would highly recommend visiting this place and wait as long and the lovely hostess tells you it is going to take !!!"
"Will be back! Great food, service, and location. The bathroom alone is worth a visit, and although the downstairs area wasn't open during my visit, I'll be back for that as well. No real downside to this place...Had a larger party (12 people) but we time it right and it worked out. Great selection of everything needed to imbibe & food was good too. Service & location were perfect."
"Such a treat. Menu has some different types of items..roasted Rack of Elk, & Venison Burger was the best burger I've ever had.  Server knew his stuff and guided us through the menu.  There were four of us everyone wanted a little of something, so we did it family style.  They brought the burger out sectioned for us.  Definitely will go back"
Solid four stars. Very nice place. Good beer and wine selection. The food was good also. Fairly pricey though.
"This place was ""On Point""!!! Location, atmosphere, and service could not have been better. Had the soup of the day, fish and chips, pasta special and sweet potato bread pudding. They were all excellent!  We will be back there before we leave town!"
"Stopped in for lunch after a great morning at the Art Institute of Chicago.  Had a half buffalo chicken sandwich, cup of cauliflower soup and an old fashioned.  Really enjoyed my entire meal.  The sandwich was one of the best buffalo chicken sandwiches I have ever eaten (if not, the best).  Warning though,  it is really messy.  If I lived closer I would want to eat here all the time.  This was actually the highlight of my Chicago dining experience."
"The atmosphere and food here was amazing!!!Great service!We ordered the New York strip, green beans, mashed potatoes, cheeseburger and fries... The appetizer was incredible: fried pickles!!!Great place to eat!"
"Every time I find myself at MIllenium Park for a concert I usually end up here.It is awesome and hits the spot. Fish and Chips while they may not be healthy are awesome. Thank God it is near a few hospitals should you chose to order seconds :)I have also brought people here for dinner..but since I dont kiss and tell, thats is all I can say about that.While it seems casual if you wore a suit while eating here after work you would not be overdressing. Leave the overalls and sombrero's to the tourists please.They have a downstairs lounge that is unused that would be good for hosting a private event. I only found out about this on a trip to the facilities because you have to walk past it :)Cheers"
Great lunch!  Had the lobster roll and loved it.  I live on west coast so getting. Good lobster roll is tough.  It was excellent and loved the outdoor seat in and just people watching on a great afternoon.  Good outdoor seating...a tad pricey however was a nice meal so great for a weekend adventure in chi town!  Walked by it a couple of times over the weekend and remember thinking outside area was great but thought it was a French place.  Was thrilled to discover it was just good fancy pub- like food!
"Lots of suits during the lunch hour, hit or miss as to whether they make for good eye candy. The proximity of this eatery to tourist attractions like millennium park, the art institute, the cultural center, etc. makes it a perfect spot for dining. With that said, don't be shocked at the number of tourists and strollers that roll through the doors (boo).I had the lunch special of an open face roast beef sandwich. It was light, which was perfect. Anytime I can avoid being tipped over and rolled out of a restaurant is a win. My girlfriend had the venison burger which made me the best tour guide in the city since she absolutely loved it. We ordered a side of the mashed potatoes which were solid, and reminded me exactly of thanksgiving. They definitely had a real taste to them, not like a manufactured, machine-mashed, high fructose corn syrup type of mashed potatoes that you can sometimes get at even the best restaurants (I'm thinking steakhouses are usually the culprit of these types).My other girlfriend ordered the regular burger and also enjoyed it very much.Overall, we were all pretty satisfied with the food. The service was good, and I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area and looking for somewhere to refuel."
"Two words.  Venison Burger.  I HATE gamey meat.  I grew up in the country, so venison was everywhere.  Luckily for me I had read and article about game hunting and butchering recently, and was willing to give it a try (apparently, meat is gamey because of how it is butchered and the time of the butchering).  Based on the reviews I took a chance and figured that this would NOT be a gamey burger.  Man am I glad I did!!  This burger could have been one of the best burgers I have EVER tasted!  I ordered it medium rare (which is how all red meat should be prepared), and it came perfectly cooked.  I paired it with a delicious IPA, and had an amazing lunch.  It was so amazing that I ate every last bite, and skipped dinner later - I was still so full.Loved this restaurant!  There are also plenty of televisions to watch a sporting event on, and it seemed like during the summer they may have some outdoor seating, but don't quote me on that."
"Mediocre food, 2.5 stars. Interesting looking menu but the food just didn't live up to the expectations. Avoid the escargot dish (very bland), my friends enjoyed the burger here. Scallop was so-so. Bison tartare was chewy and could use more capers."
"I went here on a Tuesday night and received the best service. The host, Kane, was awesome, and our waiter, Johnny, was exceptional. He knew everything about every drink on the menu and every food item. He also had a great personality. Everything was delicious, from the Genesis Growers Salad with grilled fruits to the rainbow trout. I had been here for lunch about a year ago, and enjoyed it then as well. I highly recommend this place."
"Great food. Started with the scotch egg. It was amazing. Then ordered the eggs Benedict.  Really good also, generous portion of ham, tasted high quality."
"Best Chicago restaurant experience so far!  And that is saying something because we have had some outstanding food but this was an incredible dinner.  We had reservations at 9pm on a Saturday and we showed up 2 hours early and they worked us in with no wait even though they were busy. Loved the feel of the restaurant. Upscale but comfortable. Wonderful wine list and beverage pairings. Menu is difficult to choose from because everything sounded good, and both specials sounded awesome too. Ordered mussels vindaloo for the starter and they were incredible!  Tons of mussels, plenty to share. Broth was so yummy and spicy but not too spicy. Couldn't get enough of it.  I had the mascarpone leek ravioli...SO good. Not too heavy or creamy. Very balanced and delicate. However my husband had the venison burger and after a bite of that, my ravioli tasted almost bland. This isn't a criticism about the ravioli. More of a compliment to the venison burger. It was ridiculous!  My husband is still thinking about it. So much better than a beef burger and didn't have the gamey taste you might expect. Followed up with apple cider donuts with maple ice cream...perfect ending along with nice glass of bourbon and the signature 13 degrees cocktail. Didn't want this meal to end. I think we were lucky with our table placement because some tables seemed very close to one another. A little noisy but didn't bother us. Just the sounds of people enjoying their meal and company. Great way to end our Chicago trip!"
Excellent venison burger! Best burger ever had! Chilaquellas good too! Good beer choices!
"My girlfriends and I were looking for a nice bar to have a drink after a show. We came across this unique tavern.  This place was very busy on a Thursday night. We were not sure if we were going to get a table but we were lucky as one opened up for us 5 gals!  Service was good. We ordered appetizers with our drinks. We had the PBR battered fried pickles, Gage n-17 fondue, mussels vindaloo and chips (fries) with curry gravy. Oh my!  Food was delicious!  That curry gravy was fantastic."
Ate brunch here after skating with friends at Maggie Daley ribbon on Sunday. Food was delicious and I learned that The Gage is named after The Gage Group from a time of past.... A not so fun fact for you all! Our server was attentive and definitely on point with my much needed coffee refills! The decor was fun and location was awesome!
"Went there for lunch one day, and the buffalo chicken sandwich was spectacular. The wait staff was super helpful despite how busy they were. Great restaurant if you're willing to pay for it. It is worth it."
"The gage has a great menu with a little mix of everything. Very creative dishes, brunch is a must!"
"My friend and I were looking for a good lunch spot before we headed out of town. We came in and they told us it was a 20 minute wait but we luckily found a spot at the crowded bar. The bartender, mike, was prompt and very friendly. They were pretty busy but he managed to still make us feel very welcomed. He kept our attention throughout the meal by mixing up some great cocktails for their service well. I got the scallops and my friend got the chilaquiles, both were outstanding. Both of us work in a restaurant so we can be a bit on the judgemental side but other than a manager who didn't seem to be doing anything  but standing in the way rather than helping the busy staff, it was wonderful.  I would definitely return."
"I went to The Gage for Restaurant Week and had an amazing dinner! It was my first time visiting and I must say the crowd was truly eclectic. The bar was lined with the downtown business crowd and most of seats were occupied by couples on a date and/or tourists, so a little bit of everybody. The atmosphere is sort of an upscale bar. It's the kind of place you could take an out of town business client or a date. I would wait until at least the third date to take someone here, while the food is delicious, The Gage is pricey and who wants to spend money on a bad date? Fortunately, you get what you pay for. Here's a quick run down of my 3 course meal.Course 1: Coal Fired Langoustines- There like shrimp on steroids. Cooked to perfection and the Dill and Sour cream sauce made an amazing dish that much more amazing.  Course 2: Roasted Branzino- Just the right amount of sauce to give a slight fish taste, but not overwhelm the dish. Another great dish. Course 3: Chocolate Chip Cookie Sandwich- The espresso Ice Cream was a little overwhelming, but still a solid desert overall.The waiter was wearing some sort of urban cowboy outfit, which was cool....I think. Overall, the service was excellent though. My level of satisfaction probably isn't difficult to ""Gage"" , 5 stars!"
"Had the venison burger which was like magic in my mouth. Asked for it medium rare and it came out phenomenal. Considered the lobster roll, but after seeing it at another table I was afraid it wouldn't exactly fill me up. Will definitely come back next time I'm in the area."
"This is a fine spot for lunch in the loop.  The service is friendly, speedy and the food is well prepared; the salmon blt is grand.  The beer choices are good and the desserts can be rather divine.  The fish n chips wasn't as good the last couple of times as I want it to be.  A higher quality fish and a lighter more flavorful breading, please."
They made the extra effort of seating our party of 14 prior to our reservation. Our food was prompt and very good......thank you!
"This is always my first recommendation for good spots in the Loop.I have been here plenty of times and will continue to come back. Great trendy atmosphere while not seeming too stuffy. The location is great for business lunches, date nights, and everything in between.The menu has something for everyone with choices of fish, steaks, poultry, pork, and upscale bar fare that could satisfy anyones tastes.I am a big fan of the house made sausages and the venison burger is an amazing option for those with a hearty appetite."
"Visited for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, grabbed the two seats left at the bar.  Bar staff was very knowledgeable about the types of beer they offer, and were able to provide information such as brewery of origin and comparable beverage types.  They were busy making a ton of specialty cocktails as well, they are good with those shakers!  We ordered the venison burger and fish n chips, both were excellent.  Overall a really good bar to waste a few hours in.  More refined dining available as well, with a private event space in the downstairs area."
"Went here late night Saturday to get some food and watch the game. Even if you are a late eater, I'm talking 9pm onward for dinner, it still is advisable to get a reservation. The place was packed so lucky we thought ahead.We ordered a whole bunch of appetizers and entrees and everything was delicious. The only thing I could have done without was the curry fries which lacked flavor (too watery a base). The drink menu is also very good.Why not 5 stars? This place boasts an awesome view of the park, but when you get there you're expecting this grand view and you realize the restaurant is on the ground floor. The ambiance is also very dichotomous. The bar scene and tables by the window are very lively but the other half of the restaurant is very dimly lit and gives the aura of a formal restaurant (pick one theme for the entire place). The drink prices are also on the higher end (but it's not a huge gripe because you expect that going in). Will I go back?? Already have and loved it."
"I love this place.  Yes it's almost always packed to the gills with people, but isn't that a good sign?!  I work on the block and if someone asks me for my number one Michigan Avenue recommendation for food, it is always The Gage, hands down.I've been numerous times - on dates, family gatherings, business lunches - The Gage nails it every time.  Great food, impeccable service.  Super friendly and knowledgeable bartenders if you happen to sit at the bar.I have also been told that their banquet facilities are great, though I have not experienced them myself."
"This is a great spot in downtown Chicago. The only reason why it is 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is really, very loud inside. Conversation even between two people was difficult (and this was a Tuesday night) so I can imagine that with a large group it would be near impossible. Food was really great -- the poutine was rich and delicious, venison burger very good and chicken delicious. I noted in my online reservation that we were going for my husband's birthday and our waiter brought a slice of their peanut butter pie with a candle at the end of the meal -- on the house! A great experience."
"Definitely one of the better brunch places I've had in a while. It's a huge place right by Millenium Park, which was quite convenient for us visitors. And we were able to score a table for 10. Everything on the menu looked amazing and we were already drooling looking at the huge entrees at the table next of us, that they devoured pretty quickly.Some of the entrees we ordered include:Eggs benedict with pastrami pork bellyQuiche capreseVenison BurgerOpen faced meatloaf sandwichEveryone loved their entree's and were completely stuffed in the end."
I went here thanks to Check Please and must say I was NOT disappointed.  The food was really good and I loved the atmosphere.  We were seated pretty quickly which was nice for Valentine's day and a Friday night! Definitely going back.
"After two days of Lollapalooza where I lived on nothing but soup and combos, I jumped at the chance to have brunch with a friend before the final day. My spicy bloody mary woke me up and hit the spot to get me pumped for a third day of drinking. I also had the venison burger, which was perfectly cooked and thrilled my taste buds. The fries were excellent as well.Our service was probably one of the better things about our dining experience as well. Super cute waiter who was going to join us at The Cure, but then never did. Hah, as if we could have found him in a crowd of thousands. But still! *shakes fist in the air* Anyway, I've also been here for dinner, which was excellent, and drinks- and they do pour a good Guinness. For a fancy downtown Irish pub, this one is worth going to."
"Found this place thru yelp.  Had a reservation for 8 pm, ended up there around 7 pm and sat at the bar instead.It's a nice environment, I may or may come come back or recommend it only because there wasn't much on the menu I care to try.I had the mussels (see pic) for dinner and my colleague had fish.  I like the mussels, it was a good portion for $16.  She enjoyed the fish a lot but I don't think it's $30 worth.We both had dessert, it's beignets and ice cream but I forgot the name (see pic) and it was delicious.The bartender didn't wasn't really on his game.  He did not look happy, didn't want to engage and didn't want to be there.  I get it, we all have issues at work and at home,  but for those in retail and the food industry, you need to put up a happy face."
"Oooooooo, this was the best lunner I've had in a while. Over the weekend, I went to the Art Institute with my mom, starting to get delirious with hunger we knew we needed to get somewhere fast for food, but didn't want to hang around the AI for lunch due to museum fatigue (it's a thing).So, The Gage, being a hop, skip, and a step away from the Art Institute was a great choice. We got in, sat ourselves at the bar, and were able to order and get some drinks quickly. I liked the setup of the bar area, because not only were the stools by the bar up for grabs, but you could seat yourself at any of the bar tables, too. The cocktail menu is pretty small (I think 10 drinks tops). There are a few beers, too, but not as many to choose from as most bars. The wine list is extensive, and so are the scotch and whiskey lists. My mom ended up with a blood orange soda--tasty as well as pretty. Since we decided on curry fries for an appetizer, I felt I had to go with a Guinness. It was a good pour and a good price ($6) so I was happy.The curry fries came in a HUGE bowl. Really, this was a massive serving of fries, and the curry sauce came on the side. My mom and I decided to dip the fries into the sauce, but I think it would have been better if we had poured it over the top of the fries because I wasn't getting as much curry flavor as I would like and as I've had at other bars I've ordered this at.After the fries, my mom feasted on a mushroom and greens warm sandwich with the chicken orzo soup and I got the buffalo chicken sandwich. These were so good. I got all the buffalo flavor I wanted from my sandwich and my mom's would be a meal I'd order on a day I wanted something light, but also comforting. These were slam dunks and I ate past the point when I should have stopped because I wanted to be able to fit it all!At the end of the meal, the bill didn't end up being as expensive as I anticipated. The restaurant is probably more expensive for dinner than lunch but I spent no more money here on lunch than I would at, say, DMK (to give an idea, the buffalo chicken sandwich which comes with chips cost $12--at DMK I would get a burger and add on fries for the same price). As a result, I wouldn't hesitate to come back here after a weekend excursion to the Art Institute, or even shopping on State, for a late lunch or lunner."
What a busy noon hour! Great service and wonderful flavorful food.  The Shepard pie special today was great and the banMi was yuMmmi
Second trip back and top notch service by Ryan! Food delicious and very comfortable vibe. Very busy so we learned from last year to make a reservation but well worth it and trying new things on the menu. Both visits great! Bloody Mary and mimosas don't forget!
"Long time been a favorite spot of mine. Across from Milineum Park on Michigan Avenue, whether sitting outside, in a private room in back or at the bar (as I prefer) it's always a lively and great looking place to be. The staff is always extremely pleasant and food is a can't miss. I also always like there is a mix of tourists with those who work in the loop and those of us who live there. It's always a blend.Stop wasting your time if you haven't been, get there as soon as you can."
"My best girl and I adore the Gage. Others have gone into long detail about their offerings so I'll rave about my single favorite aspect of the place: Their versatility.You can drop in for a bite as you happen by, sit at the bar, order an excellent meal and a drink or two and not go broke.You can impress a date there.If you're feeling spendy, you can go long and nothing you order will be less than excellent, bar or kitchen. Dress up. Get a table in the back room.You can reserve a big table for a party and everybody will have a challenge narrowing down their choices on the menu, be they dainty veg or farm boy carnivore.That date you married will be happy to go back after a rough day, sit at a table in the dim aisle up and opposite the bar and have a slow sip and feed to wind down. (I can attest.)We once went before a show, had to hurry through supper (they nodded and got us there on time), and what the hell, decided to come back afterward for dessert and drinks to finish off. Smiles.The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and well versed in the menu, never snobbish. Waiters seem like the kind of people who make restaurant work a career, not a stop on the way to something else.Excellent, excellent place. I'm stingy with five-star ratings, but there is nothing I can find to complain about at the Gage. Even the men's room is tops."
"We came her for dinner before seeing Book of Mormon. The food was excellent, and it was great to try some things we don't typically get to eat. Our waitress was great as well, very good service.We began our meal with a Scotch Egg which was really tasty. It was a little bigger than I expected from looking at the photos. Definitely large enough to share. The sausage had a nice flavor.Next, we had the Bison Tartar. I've been wanting to get my girlfriend to try Tartar for awhile now but was worried that she wasn't going to like it. This was actually the favorite dish for both of us. I would highly recommend trying this. My girlfriend also ordered the Lyonnaise Salad, but wouldn't recommend it.For our main course, I had the Grilled Elk and she had the Roasted Duck. The Elk was good, and the combination of flavors worked really well. However, I don't think I would order it again. My girlfriend liked the Elk a little more than I did, but we both felt pretty much the same way about the Duck as well. If you really like Duck, or want to try Elk then get it. You can't go wrong with either, but neither were great enough to order again if we return.Finally, the Apple Cider Doughnut for dessert was a fantastic way to finish off our meal."
"I think this is a perfect place to bring work colleagues for a casual conversation. it combines the informal atmospheric feel with a formal dining experience. I felt like I was placed on a  table for 2 that was forcefully squeezed in between 2 other tables. I almost felt like I could have a conversation with the guests seated on either sides. Except for that, overall, the food was amazing and the service was spectacular."
"Very impressed with the Gage - I ate at the bar tables, had the scotch eggs which started off a great meal - I then had the ravioli special and the halibut. My desert was an old fashion. Each plate tasted like a work of art - meticulously crafted to compliment  the different flavors of the veg, the sauce, and the main.   The staff was great and just the right level of attentiveness to the customers!"
"We stopped here for lunch this past Friday.   Ordered corned beef and cabbage, fennel and orange salad, and fish and chips.    Corned beef was delicious.   The salad was very refreshing.   The lightly breaded fish tasted great.   Excellent service.   Great place for lunch. Thanks for the delicious birthday chocolate layer cake!"
Very nice atmosphere and a good menu selection. Somewhat upscale. I have been there for a business lunch before and the restaurant seemed quite welcoming. I went for the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and the Chicken Orzo soup and both were delicious.
"1st time here and I think I will certainly be returning. I thought it was a just regular nicer bar with overpriced American food. Well it is not a regular bar and the menu is certainly more upscale/trendy European-American. It a nice place to go for a date or a business lunch/dinner. We had the scotch egg, lamb ragout (some new place), and the duck breast. all were very good. the duck was tasty. i heard the menu changes all the time so i will certainly be returning."
"Went to the GAGE with a large group of colleagues. The atmosphere was great. Reminded me of Europe as did many items on the menu. The menu was interesting and fun. We tried various apps including fondue, fried pickles, vindaloo mussels, scotch eggs. All were very tasty and interesting. The fried pickles were amazing, going to make these. For dinner I had the duck confit. Was very nicely prepared but did need salt. Definitely will go back to this place next time I'm in Chicago and highly recommend for a fun large conference group. Service was also fantastic."
"My overall experience at The Gage was certainly TOPS!!  Made reservations via Yelp's Open Table widget about an hour and a half in advance, made our way to the location, and were seated promptly.I had to start off with a micro-brew so I got one of the local flavors - the Anti-Hero IPA from Chicago's Revolution Brewing Co.  For a first course I chose the corn elote and my guy chose the house marinated olives.  The olives were certainly good with an interesting flavor but the corn elote was fantastic, one great sweet ear of corn perfectly offset by the spiciness of the chili-lime aioli, cilantro and lime. The server brought a knife for me to slice the kernels off the cob, which was thoughtful though that can be harder than it sounds!We skipped on ahead to fourth course - where I chose the elk tenderloin (medium) with demi glace, blueberry preserve and crispy kale salad. The elk was absolutely wonderful, tender with a bit of crunchy sear on the edges, and a hearty steak which paired nicely with the blueberry preserve in particular. The boyfriend got the coffee rubbed pork tenderloin which was absolutely devine, tender and flavorful with the most delicious grits imaginable - I was almost jealous it was so good!  (almost)  I would definitely recommend The Gage to anyone in Chicago seeking a fine dining option.  This place is gastro-pub at heart but I think anyone, even without an adventurous palate could have a great meal and experience here with excellent, excellent service."
Walking & shopping - great place for a drink & a really good burger! We had fondue too but I thought it was bland & not that tasty but the burger was great! And the service was good too
"Excellent service, location, food and ambiance!!"
"Food is really upscale.  Prices are too.  But, service is great, and the food is very good.  Fish and chips are excellent, so are the soups, and the chicken.  Sausages very good.  Family owned and operated, so it has that touch."
"I don't normally venture to restaurants so close to Millennium Park (I assume touristy), but The Gage is fantastic. The interior is beautiful and classic, the service was great, and the menu is concise but varied. I ended up ordering a halibut dish served in a bacon emulsion with asparagus, though I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the emulsion (not the hugest fan of bacon - I know, I know). Turns out, the emulsion was subtle and delicious. Highly recommended."
"""Bar and grill"" does not do this place justice. Part upper scale sports bar and part fine dining establishment, it offers the best of both. A little loud if you're looking for a quiet spot, but food offerings and drink selection are impressive. The mussels, scallops and halibut were excellent. Our waiter, Johnny, was a true professional with an impressive familiarity with the chef's workings and wine pairings. For us tourists, he also gave some helpful touring hints, and his availability throughout our 2+ hour experience was just right - a difficult balance for most wait staff. The manager checked in on us several times and after discussing dessert drink pairings gave us a complimentary 10 year Glenmorangie Scotch sampler to compare with our choices. Great meal and service Thank you!"
"The Gage remains a crucial location on Michigan Ave.  It's Chicago classic,  but I the Gage refuses to rely on its reputation alone and continues to provide excellent service and fabulous food.  We went here on a business lunch and it did not disappoint.  The ambiance is beautiful, and the food was quite tasty.  We ordered the Scotch Egg, the Poutine and the Burrata as appetizers.  (That in itself is an amazing trio right there.) The Burrata was plentiful and the Scotch Egg was great.  But the Poutine stole the show.  So delicious.  Several in our  group had never had poutine before and I think The Gage now has them hooked.  Then for lunch I had the salmon sandwich which came open faced.  It was delicious.  The salmon was cooked exceptionally well and every bite was flavorful.  And while the sandwich filled me up, it wasn't huge either (which I appreciate at for a lunch time meal).  With Seven Lions opened down the street, there are now other good lunch options on that stretch of the Mag Mile.  But The Gage shouldn't worry about losing it's #1 spot any time soon."
"Late night, last minute reservation on a Friday night, 4/19/15, after the theater, table for 3.  Excellent service, and excellent food. Vindaloo mussels!!  Who knew such a combination was even possible? Best fish and chips I've had since since Dublin. Asparagus with DUCK (!) bacon was fabulous.  Outstanding cocktails.  This recommend is from a group of three that have been in 14 different countries in the last 15 months with LOTs of dining out in major metro areas around the world."
Wow!  Had lunch here and it's marvelous.  Venison burger with Gouda and jalapeños was a treat!
"Solid upscale pub fare, great cocktails and beer selection. Pricey because of location.Had: Venison burger, poutin fries, fried pickles, local craft beersFriends had: fish and chips, beet salad, soup de jour"
"The menu choices were varied and terrific. my client and i shared a hot squash soup with some goat cheese in it that was smooth and wonderful.  I had scallops in a greeny light sauce with varied fresh veggies; flavorful scallops and not overcooked at all. perfect and fluffy. presentation was very appealing to the eye. My date had a smoked duck dish that was awesome as well.    Most notable here? Service and attention. absolutely superb. The waitress/server? yep. BUT, 2 managers suited up made it a point to ask about things very specifically. one manager:  """"""hi sir. i hope your scallops are cooked properly and your not tasting too much of the bacon renderings. we like to balance it. How did we do?"""" Then another seemingly senior manager made the rounds as well. Excellent.Only a minor observation. The curtain between bar and diners should be shut; the noise pouring over us was borderline unbearable. Some holiday decorations prohibited this, otherwise we would have begged to have them closed so we didn't have to yell at one another from 2 feet away. What a great approach to an area that gets such a wide variety of tourists, businesspeople, and occasionally families that stroll in while walking near the Art Institute. Very professionally managed and DELICIOUS dining."
Way too pricey. Had one drink and left. $17 for one glass of wine is ridiculous. Too loud!
"Love this place! Not only is the energy great, but when the weather is nice they open up the outside area and you get an excellent view of Millennium Park.  As for the food, it is class gastropub faire: chicken, steak, and fish; but the real winner is the Roasted Rack of Elk. It is perfectly dressed and accompanied with prosciutto (who doesn't love that!) I recommend The Gage for any occasion, but it is great if you have theater tickets or just got done at the Art Institute."
"This place is a superb gastropub and lives up to its reputation.  We came in for brunch and our party had molasses french toast ($13), corned beef hash ($14), and I had the braised beef brisket sandwich with arugula ($15) and a Stone IPA ($6).  The food preparation and taste were excellent.  They have a great drink selection and a vibrant atmosphere.  The dining space is not very large, so I would suggest a reservation.  The prices there are also reasonable for the quality and location.  The biggest drawback to dining here might be the cost of parking - even nearby metered street parking is $6.50 per hour, otherwise it's probably about $20 for lot parking or valet.  I'll be back someday anyway!"
"The Gage is among the most solid options in the Michigan Ave. area.  Very comfortable, very satisfying, very good service, just refined enough.  They've also managed to pull off the bar-in-front, fine-dining-in-back duet very well.  That sounds like a restaurant mullet, but at The Gage, it's a seamless blend.  On my most recent visit, I returned to an option I'd enjoyed before: the Amish chicken.  In spite of my reluctance to patronize the Amish in any way (puppy mills!) I have to say, this chicken is excellent.  The description includes the magic words: ""goat cheese"" and word to the wise, it's melted and so yummy.  I know people who wouldn't order chicken because they eat it at home often, but this is worth eating anywhere.  This time we also ordered the Brussels sprouts, which are a favorite - yes, children - of my husband's and mine.  Luckily these could be ordered with the bacon on the side, if you, like me, don't believe in bacon.  The brie was inoffensive to both of us and while good, isn't a necessity.      Otherwise, I've also enjoyed the chips (fries), bread with sea salt butter, and to my surprise, the fried pickles.  I tend not to dabble in pickles, but as an American, I will try things when fried that I will not try when au natural.  In small doses, and with some lingering hesitation, I do hereby endorse these pickles as edible.   Pre-dinner I had a delicious blood orange green tea at the bar, and post-dinner I shared the chocolate pudding cake with Nutella and ice cream.  Both were extra-credit versions of things you've had before.  For whatever reason, I haven't done much drinking at The Gage but I will rectify that next time since their wine and spirits are a vast but carefully curated collection.   The service is always gracious, both at the bar and tableside.  The staff is polished but unpretentious, and I've seen the owner check in on tables more than once.  I like the decor choices but I will say the booths near the bar can be a little dim - do with that what you will, you romantics.  The framed old adverts lining the walls in the stairway are cute and add a little uniqueness.   The Gage is on our short list for downtown destinations.  It has fit the bill for special occasions, drop-ins and a post-theater dinner twice.  I hereby endorse The Gage with no hesitation whatsoever."
"Me and my aunt came here for brunch and got to sit out on the patio. We were greeted by our friendly server, Amanda I think her name was. And we ordered our food. I had Poutine and the soup of the day which was orzo/pea/carrot. The soup was okay, it came in a small bowl. I'd barely consider it an appetizer. But the poutine was really good. For dessert I had sorbet and it was perfect and refeshing . The artisan soda was refreshing too, although I've had better, more delicate tasting artisan sodas before. Still, it was a lovely day filled with good food and service."
"Very classy place! The food was out of this world good! With Elk on the menu, we had to try it... Melt in your mouth good. It's quite pricey, but was well worth it! The baby sweet potatoes were delicious too! Our server was probably one of the best I've ever had."
Very cute spot. We were doing the tourist thing at Millennium Park and stopped by for a few drinks. Decent selection of tequila and beer.
"Wes, our waiter, made the dining experience most gratifying. The food didn't surprise or disappoint. The other patrons were dripping with money, and ""class"" while my boyfriend and I were eyed suspiciously for our backpacks (we're students) and our calm demeanor. If you don't mind weaving through the packs of suits, amongst the charms of the staff then grab the Venison Burger and have Wes make you a Shirley Temple."
"We enjoyed this place. It's a little expensive, and I was worried that it would be a bit of a tourist trap based on location, but the food was very good and our waiter was great.They have some good beers on tap too."
"I have to admit...I'm a little disappointed with my experience at The Gage, especially in light of all the fabulous reviews.Pros: the fish and chips tasted fabulous!  While the chips weren't anything terribly special, the fish was moist, appropriately breaded, and very filling.  Also, the atmosphere is great; the bottles behind the bar are lit and change colors every few minutes.  The whole restaurant just feels warm and welcoming.Cons: my server acted as if I was an inconvenience to him.  I sat for almost 10 minutes before being greeted and when he did come over, I felt as if he was annoyed with my question about lunch specials.  Additionally, the lunch menu was rather limited (although the selections were all strong).My verdict?  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but if I was in the neighborhood, I'd stop by.  Take it or leave it, if you will."
"Chose  The Gage before symphony. Pretty good. First the bad news: Scotch Egg was overcooked, the egg at pleasant house is FAR superior to Gage's even the sausage shell. Caesar salad was too cold, served with one not-so-good anchovy, and trout salad was over salty. Then the OK news: tuna steak was well prepared and served with a deconstructed Niçoise salad, scallops were good and sorbet was tasty. If I am headed to symphony and need a place near the Center then I would probably go back but I certainly wouldn't make the trip there without reason. Cheers"
Great pub by Millennium park. Wish the tv's were better. Diverse crowd. The curry Fries are soooo good.very expensive wines by the glass but excellent. Really fun cocktail and a great burger. Can't ask for more!
"Solid 4.0  Consistently good.Great for lunch, also a good dinner spot for events in the Loop.  Nice pre-Bears, post-Bears meal."
Came here for brunch after watching the marathon. It was so cute and the food was delicious. It isn't light if that's what you're looking for but I think most Chicagoans would appreciate the meat and potatoes heavy menu here. Would def go back again :)
"Phenomenal service.  Great atmosphere -- we were in the glassed in room in the back and it was quiet enough to hold a conversation.  The tables in the open bar area were more ""animated"".  Food was excellent.  Bison tartar, pekin duck and elk were outstanding.  Wine/spirits options very good -- and not the usual.  Overall, if you want some great food and libations that are a bit off from the norm, The Gage is the best.  Only downside -- no valet parking was offered on MON night.  Don't know about weekends."
"Solid food, decent cocktails, great people watching. Good for a business lunch or happy hour :)"
"Overall, I enjoyed my trip to the Gage.The food was great.  The prices were pretty good when considering the quality of the food.  I really especially loved their barbeque wings.  What I didn't like is the attitude the waiter showed us when my group wanted to split the checks in three.  As if it were a major inconvenience to him and that it wasn't his job.  Everything else, though, was amazing!"
Came here because I knew the ownership was the same as Henri (rip). Loved the food fun pub/ bistro style food that tastes great. Got 2 rounds of cocktails that were also very good. Our server was attentive and even checked to see what kind of glassware a drink came in! We were there late after lunch and the owner Billy came over to check on us which is cool since a lot of restaurant owners don't put in Facetime. He asked about our day and got to talking and eventually even sent us a round of bourbon that the gage helped make! We will definitely return and tell our friends.
"Came upon this place while visiting chicago for the first time with family. Really cool gastropub with great food and drinks. It was very busy but we got two seats at the bar. My mom and I shared 3 different things - all delicious and perfectly flavored. We had the cheese dip appetizer which, well, need I say more? CHEESE. DIP. Ok then we had the burger, perfectly cooked and the fries we're great too. We shared one more thing but I can't remember what it was. Scallops I think? Anyways, it was all good!"
"We loved, loved, loved everything about The Gage. We looked up ""The 38 Essential Chicago Restaurants,"" and whallah.  We did make a reservation for an early evening dinner for two. A gastro pub in the loop with such high ratings, a must.  We arrived on time and were anxious to sit outside and people-gaze, however, it started sprinkling. The hand-off from outdoor waiter to indoor waitress was seamless and quick.My husband, into beer snobbery, was definitely in the right place. He placed an order for a beer, the waitress came back and advised they were out. He placed an order for another beer, the waitress came back and advised they were out. The general manager then came to talk beer snobbery smack with my husband for the next 10 minutes.  We don't frown on the lack of inventory--any beer snob knows the types of beers available at The Gage are so limited and so rare, it's amazing they can even get a case from some of these distributors--no issues here on going down the list.We always get way ahead of ourselves with a menu of such. We want it all, apps, dinner, shares, whatever.  Unfortunately, eyes bigger than our bellies.  For our ""First,"" I started with the fried pickles.  Beyond delicious. My husband had some french-fry, gravy, cheese concoction, and it was to die for.  We skipped the ""Second"" and ""Third"" and went straight for the ""Fourth.""  My husband had mussels that were plentiful and perfectly presented with enough bread for sauce dippings, and I had the fish and chips.  All as expected and tasty.The dining room ambiance was a little too stuffy for our liking, so we skipped it and stayed within the bar area.  Definitely a solid five stars and a Chicago gem.  We'd go again in a millasecond."
"Came here for lunch on a weekday on a cold fall day.  Place was packed.  Lucky to grab a seat at near the front.  Started off with the mussels vindaloo.  Fantastic.  Wife and I love mussels and these were the best we have ever had.  It was cooked in a curry sauce and the hard bread that came with it compliments the sauce very well.  For our entres, wife had salmon blt which she liked and I had the fish and chips which was decent.  Will definitely come back and order two mussels vindaloos as my meal.  It was that good."
"Excellent food in a bustling bistro type setting.  They were able to accommodate 3 on a saturday night on short notice.  Had the venison burger.  It was yummy even thought the jalapenos were not really hot or batter fried like I expected, more like pan fried.  Dessert was fantastic.  Do not miss the BOURBON Milkshake!!!!  So good."
"I must be on a roll ---another outstanding dinner on my 2nd night in Chicago.  I opted for a fairly light dinner and went with the sea scallops.  I was honestly a bit confused how it was described on the menu, but it was an interesting combination of flavors.  and it was absolutely delicious.  Paired it with the a nice glass of cab and topped it with chocolate pot de creme.  amazing meal.  impeccable service.  i'm tempted to return tomorrow for lunch."
"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago when we went. Since we stayed by Museum Park, the location of this restaurant is extremely convenient. Also if you are planning on going to any shows (we went to see Book of Mormon at the Bank of America Theater), this is a good restaurant to go before.They check in with you to see what time is your show, and make it a priority to get you in and out in time.The service as I mentioned above was phenomenal. Our waiter was polite, friendly, and helpful.Libations are aplenty. They have a good list of drafts, wines, etc...Food was also really great. We got the following:- Mussels Appetizer - Ok, but my date loved it- Roasted Scallops - Good- Duck Breast - This was really juicy and good"
"In a word -  amazing.  We went to the gage to celebrate my husband's citizenship ceremony.  We chose this place at random and was so happy we did.  We were immediately greeted by our hostesses who were so friendly.  Seated immediately our waiter les was beyond hospitable.  We went with my four year old and I honestly could not believe how nice they were to her.  I live in Chicago and usually think of these downtown places as pretentious and I was hesitant to bring her here.  Not the case at all. We had the venison burger, fondue, scotch egg and a salad.  Honestly all were amazing and beyond what I expected.  Amy stopped by our table as well and was so pleasant.  They even made a little celebration dessert that really made our day.  Thank you so much. I will definitely be going back.  I can't wait!"
"The Gage was a bit more upscale than I'd expected from the reviews, definitely on the nicer end of gastropub. Service was efficient and friendly. Food was excellent, though some of the ""snacks"" are more substantial in size than one might guess from reading the menu. The excellent poutine appetizer, for instance, probably could have served the two of us for a meal if we'd also split a salad. It was addictively good, with the red onion pickles adding contrast to the creamy gravy and the slightly squeaky cheese curds. The dessert menu was more creative than usual, including a sweet potato creme brulee with rum-infused creme fraiche and an apple cider donut with maple ice cream, but unfortunately we were too full to try the desserts. We'll have to come back."
"The beer selection, particularly Gossamer on tap makes me smile a little larger than the average downtown gastropub.  Despite the on again off again meh crowd, this place does what's quickly becoming an over-saturated genre really well.Try the poutine, it's no Bad Happy but the curry angle gives it that heart warming feel on a cold day."
"The name of this restaurant comes from the building it's situated in - the Gage building. If you look at it from the outside, it may not seem as anything to admire but at one time this building and it's neighbors were occupied by women hat makers. Due to the large amount of detail that went into hats in the past, the rooms required large amount of sunlight, giving rise to the bay windows you can see on this building.The restaurant itself has a great vibe and it would be a great place to hang out after work. The location is unbeatable with the ""bean"" situated right across the street. The interior is very well decorated with enough seating for everyone who enters.The food on the other hand could be better. I got the poutine and I wish I hadn't. The gravy had almost no flavor and the toppings could be bigger. It was minced carrots and bell pepper on top which just threw off the taste for me. Maybe some of you will enjoy that.Considering its location, this place is aptly priced but will be expensive in other areas. My glass of wine cost $14 and the total for a cocktail, glass of wine and cocktails came up to $44.I would go here again but it is overhyped based on my experience."
"Overall, classic Chicago experience. Upscale feel, with friendly Midwest vibe. We enjoyed the twist on classical meals (ie corn ice cream), and traditional, prohibition-based drinks."
"This place was perfect for a night with a buddy.   Amazing burgers, beer selection, and all around atmosphere."
"We ate here last weekend in Chicago and it was pretty good. Wine we had was amazing (L'Oliveto Chardonnay I believe), soup was amazing, overall our table of 6 enjoyed their meals. We were unimpressed with the beet salad, other than that my lobster roll was delicious and my friend's salad was really good as well. I overheard the rest of the party say that the heirloom tomato salad was ok and that the crab cakes were a little flavorless. Ambience is really nice though and the service was very good. You can't really go wrong at this place. I would try it again because I do think they probably have a lot tastier items on the menu and the atmosphere in this place is just wonderful."
"Agree with the reviewer that said ""if you're at Millenium Park [or anything south of the River] just go to Gage"".  It's so easy, so good and guaranteed to please!  Bartender Devon (sp?) makes sitting at the bar wonderful!  The management is so lucky to have an employee like her.  Love the fondue, venison burger-- why name it? It's all good!,"
Really awesome desserts!
"The atmosphere here was great, as were the cocktails. Although, I must say the food was wayyy too salty and a tad overpriced considering the taste."
"This place is stellar in that its right across from Millennium Park downtown, and yet somehow able to seat us almost right away during prime dinner hour on a packed holiday weekend. So if you're doing the standard tourist drag up Michigan Ave this is a good, quick, tasty option. We had fish and chips, burger, ravioli. The ravioli was bad, very tasteless, but everything else was good if standard. Would like to try some other things. Service was also a tad slow. But they had a pretty good beer list, and again the availability in such a busy location makes it worth remembering."
"I went there for beer n some bar food, then found these item, Fries with gravy and fried chillies.. Must try tgese"
"I was in Chicago for a conference, and a good friend who's a Chicago native highly recommended The Gage. The Pamplemousse grapefruit drink was delicious and refreshing. I ordered the poutine and was seriously disappointed; the French fries were stale and soggy, and the dish was over-salted to the point that I had to send it back after 2 bites. I also ordered the poached lobster, which was good, but the accompanying bisque was also over-salted and couldn't be consumed in its entirety. I came in with 2 colleagues, neither of whom ordered any food or drink because of religious dietary restrictions. The Gage doesn't have anything for people who need to avoid alcohol, pork, shellfish, or dishes that don't combine meat and dairy. The noise level in the restaurant was deafening, even in the back dining area, away from the bar. The terrible noise made one of my colleagues cranky and hostile, and he's normally a nice guy. Our server, a friendly brunette, took the inedible poutine off the bill, and I felt bad that my friends didn't order anything, so I ended up tipping her 50%.Less salt, please!"
"Very good drink, the server made good suggestions. Ordered the Scottish egg: it was my first time trying it. I really enjoyed it, but the garnish was lacking.Fried Pickles: I loved them!!Overall, this place had a great vibe, great drinks, and good food."
"We had a reservation for 11:45 before a 2:00 performance of the Book of Mormon and we were seated right away in a very nice booth way in the back in a very uncrowded restaurant.  I enjoyed seeing the kitchen at work and being a bit away from the main part of the restaurant.  It was a special day so we started with a mimosa for me and a Bellini for my wife, both of which added a special bubbly start to the day.  We were there on the last day of restaurant week so we got that special menu which was extremely budget friendly at twenty two dollars.  I was able to substitute the Potato and Leek soup of the day for the soup on that menu and it was outstanding.  Really different with some heat.  For my entree I had the special chicken thigh that had been in a confit, it was probably the best chicken I had ever had in my life.  For dessert there was only a white mousse cake option so we had that and it came with some carrot cake which was even better.  Excellent coffee rounded out a great meal.  The service was as good as the meal - solicitous without hovering, crumbed the table, manager stopped by and it all added up to a very thoughtful and high level experience.  This is surprising that you have this fine dining experience right in the middle of the most touristy area of Chicago.  As we left we noticed that the restaurant had gotten very crowded but out part was much more quiet and manageable.I am looking forward to a return visit to this very satisfying restaurant.  Well done!"
"Same owner as Henri. I am a fan of both places. You see the owner walking around really talking to the customers.... you know, not just a drive by to say ""how is everything"" then moving on. He stops, listens, engages. Billy Lawless cares!Hubby and I came here after a day at C2E2. I would have talked the Hubs into Henri, but, well, you know what we must have looked like after a day at Comic Book Heaven...The only complaint I have about The Gage is the noise level. Hubby and I walked in to eat at the bar, but we couldn't hear ourselves talk. We opted for an outside table. After this horrible spring, it was actually nice enough to sit outside! Go figure!What a pleasant evening. Our waiter was attentive, but not overly so. He let us enjoy our drinks. Mine was a rum based negroni. OMG! Slurp!We shared fried pickles. Hubs and I have had them many places. They can be too salty; too greasy; too much breading... but these were ""just right"". Crispy little chips of heaven with a yummy sauce we saved to put on other things that came later.Hubby had the burger. Looked juicy. I didn't try it, but he looked like he enjoyed it.I had mussels. They came in a curry sauce. They were very delicious. I also ordered a pate plate. Hmm-mmm... my eyes were bigger than my tummy, so we took it home. I just ate it for lunch. EXCELLENT! It had some sweet jam and vinegar onions to go with it. Yum.I did have dessert because the butter cake just couldn't be passed up. I am so glad I ordered it. I also took it home and have been savoring it by having two bites a night. It is so moist and buttery that I would go back to The Gage and just order that! I think I may ask Henri to go get me one for dessert next time I eat there!The only reason I made this 4 stars, not 5 is because of the noise level... but on a nice evening... just go outside!"
"My group of 7 came here for Saturday brunch and it was unbelievably amazing! We started with the PBR fried pickles (which came with a perfectly creamy spicy dipping sauce) and morning drinks. I wasn't a huge fan of the Bloody Mary, which wasn't very flavorful, but it was strong. I ordered the fish and chips and they were phenomenal. Crispy, flaky, great tartar sauce, generous sized portion. Others had the chilequiles with chorizo and the smoked salmon. All the food was fresh and delicious. We sat outside, which was nicely private from the street due to the shrubs, but I would've enjoyed the indoor ambiance for lunch or dinner. It would be great for an intimate but semi-casual dinner. Although it is right on Michigan Ave across from the park, it did not feel touristy one bit."
"When I think of how cool Chicago is (I love this city), I think that The Gage is a good representation of what Chicago is. I was at The Gage on a Wednesday night and the crowd was lively; the atmosphere was dark, subdued but playful; and the food and drinks were wonderful. I was in Chicago for about 20 hours and wanted to make sure that I had at least one good meal. The mussels appetizer was delicious; fresh, plump P.E.I. mussels in a delicious, heavenly broth that was neither too light nor too heavy. The strange-looking crostini (the largest one I've ever seen at about eight inches in length!) was cooked perfectly to soak up the deliciousness of the broth. The helpful server (even though the restaurant was really busy) asked if I'd like another piece but I politely refused so I could remember how good the first piece was.I don't like getting chicken breast at many restaurants since it usually comes out dry but I was in a chicken mood and ordered the Amish-style chicken. It was cooked evenly and was very juicy and moist. The goat cheese sauce proved to be a unique touch to the chicken. I wish it came with a side but since I'm not a big fan of diced potatoes but nonetheless, what a fulfilling dish. The cocktails were expertly crafted and paired wonderfully with the food. Dessert? Way too stuffed to even nibble on a morsel.If you want a casual elegant but fun, inviting atmosphere that is devoid of drunk college kids but is full of good drinks and food, The Gage is your place. Even dining alone, it was truly wonderful."
"Great apps and mixed drinks. Love the sliders, mussels, mini crab cakes and Old Cuban."
"Fantastic experience - service, food and atmosphere were exceptional - will def return in the near future - highly recommend to all."
"Had lunch here today.  The service was great.  The wait staff is very knowledgable.  We were seated immediately upon arrival.  The poutine was amazing, try it!  Lunch for 2 (reuben sanwiches) with appetizer came out to be just under $50 with tip.  A little pricey for an everyday lunch but a good value for the quality and portion size.  All in all a good experience.  I'd like to come back and try some different menu items."
"Goddamn yes. Yes. YES.Allsimgonnasay ""Venison burger with a goose island root beer"" Forget your job, just cmon out and get that one winters afternoon, and all shall be  forgotten, you will think you are one of those weirdos from Game of Thrones who eats entire turkeys or whatever they do on that show. I miss Boardwalk. And Borat.This is a downtown fancy pants place, so set your wallets accordingly. Worth it."
"The fish and chips were some of the best I've ever had, especially considering I thought this was going to be a tourist trap. EOS (end of story)."
"The menu was a little limited, but the place was gorgeous!Our server, Tony was AH-MAH-ZING at accommodating my OCD order.  My scallops came out perfect and my husband took a risk by ordering an Elk Steak for the first time--it wasn't 'gamey' like he feared.  (I took a bite and was impressed.)Although the restaurant was busy, our server was ON our drinks and the order did not take long at all.  I was kinda shocked-- because it was Restaurant Week and we have only heard horror stories about service during this time!The restaurant was loud, but we sat in the back (near the kitchen) and it was just fine there.I loved the fact that the kitchen is open until two a.m. Seriously?!  I feel bad for the cooks...but a bonus if you have a late night craving for an upscale place!I would eat there again--but PLEASE Gage people--come up with some entree sized salads that are lower calorie!!! I would also like to see them add more seafood selections."
Perfectly located across from the bean. Beautiful decor. Get the mushroom sandwich for sure! Pulled pork sandwich on daily special is a delight.
"Great after work spot! Awesome ambiance! Drinks were great and the waiting staff was excellent. Sat in the bar high tops, could still get full menu there! Pretty tight when crowded but they can handle their crowds. Will definitely come back again!"
"After a great Friday night at the Chi Symphony Orchestra, my date and I headed to the Gage where we were immediately seated around 10:15pm. The crowd was lively, beautiful, and sophisticated, as was the vibe throughout the night.For drinks, we went with red wine, followed by 13 Degrees Cocktails (3 rounds- Yes, it's incredibly good with equally great presentation). For starters, we selected the mussels, oysters, and beet salad. All were superb. The oysters were juicy, and fantastic; the mussels were hearty; the beet salad was crunchy with walnuts, while sweetly paired with sliced apples. We went with the suggested rack of elk, roasted sablefish, and Market Fish of the day, which was Black Cod. My favorite of our entrees is easily the Sablefish. Wow- it was so thick, tender, flavorful, and plentiful. The mushrooms, and greens that accompanied it truly complemented the dish, as well. The rack of elk was very good, and cooked med/rare as preferred. The elk was dense, and satisfying. The Black cod was good, but I wouldn't order it again. I'd recommend trying it for those whom enjoy cod; if you don't prefer white fish, skip it altogether. Lastly, we finished our meals with coffee and lattes (which were decent: neither great or terrible), apple cider doughnuts, and the cranberry spice cake. The doughnuts were my favorite part, sitting beside a melting scoop of maple ice-cream (similar taste to that of butter-pecan-flavored ice-cream). YUM! The doughnuts were the perfect texture, and ranged in size: several munchkin-sized, and a couple regular doughnut sized.This is a great spot for a group get-together, a date night, or a business-casual setting."
"The food's good. The atmosphere is loud. I don't know...there's just something about The Gage that I don't love. I've been here 3 times, and each time I leave wondering why I came.  I really enjoy their homemade sodas and the venison burger but besides those two things, nothing else is spectacular about it.  They have a tiny draft list and once when I came for dinner, the server was a dick. He looked at me and assumed I was a Blue Moon drinker- ugh, as if. I don't come here unless someone I'm with decides on it."
The food at the Gage was amazing. I had the chicken and portion size was just right. I also shared the steak and it was divine.Everything was reasonably priced and I truly believe that I got what I paid for.
"M has been hankering to try The Gage since she saw it on Check Please, so when the opportunity arose for us to have a late lunch (more like dinner) outing on Saturday we went. The Gage doesn't look very large from the foyer; however, the journey to our table revealed a few connected rooms, all crammed to the max with tables and chairs. The decor is rich, dark, and manly - a space you'd expect to see classy 1920 mobster kings smoking cigars.Our experience at The Gage was all about indulgence. We were greeted first by the chef, who discussed their Check Please appearance and also made recommendations of his favorite dishes. We took him very seriously and ordered them all. That made the job of  Augustus (our server) pretty simple; however, he still shone with poise and kind attention to our every chance eye-contact. In fact, when we asked for more dipping bread for our mussels, we were presented with four more large pieces - far more than we wanted. Augustus accidentally treated us to an extra cocktail for ""the table"" and did not charge us. See? Indulgence.In all, we ordered the following:Basil Escargot - Not your typical escargot. The Gage took those little snails out of their buttery homes and sandwiched them between hazelnut cookies with goat cheese for a dish that completely reconstructed my understanding of escargot. It was a little difficult to share (see my picture) as cutting the presentation in two caused an unsightly mess on the plate.Mussels - M loved them. She said that she caught hints of salty sea water in the savory little bits. I liked the soft texture of the meats and the broth. For the price and quality, we got a HUGE portion. The two of us could not finish all of them.Crisp Rabbit Salad - This was our mutual favorite dish of the evening. It was simple arugula with a light mustard dressing over a bed of shredded rabbit. The greens were topped with crisp, pure white, puffed rice pearls that added a perfect amount of delicate crunch to the salad. We had the chef divide the salad onto two plates for us, which ended up being perfect portions.Maple Leaf Farms Duck Roasted Breast and Confit - This was a surprising comfort-food dish. The clove flavor shone through the pudding and lent a nice spiciness to the richness of the duck. There were actually two types of duck meat: breast and leg. The breast was served in seven thick slices on top and the leg was shredded underneath. M thought that the shredded meat was rabbit at first (after enjoying the Crisp Rabbit Salad), but Augustus kindly explained that it was all duck. I must say that we were both distended by the time we got to this final dish and did not have the hunger to properly enjoy it.We also had wine, the Old Fashioned no. 24, and Irish Coffee. The Old Fashioned no. 24 tasted watery from the generous pour of ginger ale but was still good. I liked the dried cherries at the bottom. The Irish Coffee wasn't sweet enough for me, but I enjoyed the presentation of a thick layer of cream on top of dark coffee. When drinking it, the cream bumped my lip and mixed with the hot coffee on it's path to my mouth.Our entire bill came to about $130 (if I remember correctly). M commented that it wasn't nearly as expensive as she expected it to be, especially considering all of our alcohol. We think our sharing all of our dishes had a lot to do with the final price.The single most reason why neither Melinda nor I would give a full five stars to The Gage is because it was so incredibly crowded. We were there at 5:00 PM and the place became completely full soon afterward. Other tables were very close to us and the physical space was difficult to navigate when entering or exiting or table (when using the loo for example). Even Augustus admitted that weekends get ""crazy.""Now ""Cheers!"" Both the owner and several servers would say that when leaving a table. So I say ""Cheers"" to The Gage. Thanks for a nice, indulgent evening!"
"Pork Belly Eggs Benedict anyone?!  Insane!!!  Thank the good Lake almighty that The Gage was so close to our hotel!With other joints in the area (old school vibes and fishy menus) I found the Gage  to be upscale, but casual, with amazing service and incredibly diverse menu choices. The night before we had brunch, we went with a Venison burger which was perfect, (smoked Gouda was an awesome touch), a beautiful beet salad, a sautéed kale salad and a braised veal shoulder. Incredible!  Beer and wine selection was plentiful and if you're looking for even more casual, pony up to the communal table in the front and order up and share away. Did I mention my brunch the next day???  The Pork Belly Benedict was rich and paired with perfected potatoes....One more thing, I received a complimentary dessert after admitting to eating 2 meals in a row there, now that's classy!"
"Nice upscale, yet casual place for lunch and dinner. The tomato burrata salad was divine."
"Came here for dinner our first night in town and even though we were a little late for our reservation, we were seated promptly. Bread and butter were decent (bread crust a little hard but the butter is really good). We ordered the mussels (clean, yummy, wish there was more broth), baby gem lettuce as it was very highly recommended on yelp (crisp, clean, cold, refreshing with a brilliant warm touch of capers), and the coffee rubbed pork (grits are of buttery goodness, the pork smells of coffee but I don't really taste it, and the lima beans gave the dish a very hearty touch).The wine we ordered was also great -domaine guiberteau chenin blanc saumur- a white from the loire - super versatile and changed with every dish- it definitely made my meal very surprising and enjoyable. Ordered the rhubarb shortcake but the star of that dessert was the lychee sorbet with pistachios - legit natural lychee taste which is hard to find!!!! shortcake is yummy with the vanilla sauce but could have done with less rhubarb.  I would've given this place 4 stars but the service (and maybe some influence from the wine) tipped this up to a 5. We had ordered these dishes to share between the two of us, but they were thoughtful enough to have split it and brought it out in 2 individual plates.Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Chicago!! =]"
"I've been wanting and trying to eat at The Gage for a while.  The first attempt turned into just drinks in the bar and I had to escape an awkward situation.  The second attempt turned into dinner somewhere else after a comedy of errors surrounding a forgotten cell phone.  Third times a charm! My first try at dinner here I was really disappointed with the service.  My date had arrived first, had a reservation, and was already seated.  I had forgotten my cell phone at home, inquired at the host stand about the reservation and was told there wasn't one in that name.  There was a reservation in his name, there was even him seated at a table waiting for me for 45 minutes, but the hostess didn't connect the dots.  The service at lunch didn't really make up for the hostesses prior mess.  We spent plenty of time waiting for our drinks to be refilled, and the service just felt rushed.The food and drinks were good.  The old fashions I had my first try at the Gage were all very good.  I had the salmon salad for lunch and it was good.  I wasn't floored by it though, and it was a lot better when I stole some kind of salsa-like side from my lunch date's dish.  I like the decor at the Gage.  It has a warm and inviting feel to it without being too small.  They have a private room downstairs, but it's not quite as attractive as the upstairs.  Hopefully my next trip to the Gage will be better than the last three.  I have high hopes , but until they are realized the Gage is merely ""A-OK"" in my book."
"Went here with 5 of my co-workers for a team building event while in town. Service was top notch. Menu is varied and not outrageously priced for the location. Good selection of craft beers, wines by the glass and cocktails. The place is large and bustling! Food? Pretty good but not fantastic. The poutine was good but didn't live up to my expectations. My buddy and I both had the heirloom tomato salad. Very good. I ordered the Mahi special of the day. Dry and overcooked and the zucchini was also not great. Judging from the reviews, I should have the burger. Next time!"
"Gage earns another star from me thanks to my trip there yesterday! The Gage was insanely busy, as was every place around Millennium Park. They weren't even allowing people into the restaurant and we had to wait about 10 minutes to enter with a couple of big bouncer types outside. Luckily, smart psycho planner Sarah had made a reservation for our party of 4 at 130. When we checked in at 110, they were able to seat us instantly on the patio. I was so happy because I feared a longggg wait even with a reservation. Our waiter was very nice, nothing extraordinarily nice but not bad in any size, shape or form. This really doesn't deserve a mention but my biggest Yelp fan commented I also write about service. =P Although, he asked us if we wanted a different side instead of fries because one guy had already ordered fries. Three of us decided we'd prefer greens to the fries, which was then brought out in addition to our meals & fries, running us $7 a pop additional each! Eek!I got a special fizzy, whiskey St. Patrick's Day liquor beverage. It was delicious! For lunch I had the woodland mushrooms on ciabatta bread sandwich for $12. They put a ton of delciousness in that sandwich which made it amazing. It came with a large portion of fries and a huge salad of greens on the side. I really enjoyed the food on this visit, much better than my first couple of times around. The Gage can never seem to get it all right on one visit for me, which is disappointing...but for the way they handled traffic & the tasty eats yesterday, they've earned the extra star from me."
"Apparently this place is super trendy, but I've never heard of it. Not that that means anything. And remember, I usually don't stray more than a block or two from my office, which is next to the Sears Tower, so this is definitely out of my neighborhood.My dining companion was surprised to get in as easily as we did, but it was a frigid MLK day, so I doubt the city was out in force. Good thing it wasn't because it meant I got to enjoy an epic sandwich. Delicious, juicy, salty pulled pork, lightly roasted, crisp hot peppers,  fried black kale, three massive crispy onion rings drizzled in sweet chili sauce, and yellow mustard, all on a pretzel roll? Have mercy. Absolutely delicious. Loved the roasted peppers with the pork, the crunch of the onion rings, and the mustard + chili sauce was magical. Plus, you had me at pretzel roll. Slight downside, it was an expensive sandwich, but I don't care. IT HAD A PRETZEL ROLL.My dining companion had a shepherd's pie special, served in its own little cute cast iron pot. This was also very good, with nice browned mashed potatoes, and delicious tender lamb inside. Thanks to those insulating taters and the cast iron pot, this came out hot enough to emit its own light, diner beware.But now, as with the Firkin, I'm in a rut. I know what menu item is a guaranteed win. Will I ever branch out on future visits? Remains to be seen. I wish I was closer to this place, because it blows the doors off every other similarly priced sit down lunch spot in the loop."
"We went on Friday night - a super busy St. Patrick's crowd. We had a big stroller and three small kids. But the manager - or who seemed to be the manager- opened the door for us, had a table right away, and was beyond helpful. I know we weren't the desired after work table but the service was excellent. The bread was great. The kids' grilled cheese and Mac and cheese were really good, and the sweet potatoes - definitely get those. Then we got our fish and chips (a stellar review of those brought us in ) and unfortunately, they just fell flat. Definitely lacked flavor or depth of any kind. Presentation was fun but could have done without the non-traditional side of tartar and catsup. Super fun place, great vibe, and uber helpful especially for a large family during happy hour. But could have had better fish."
"Seriously the best mussels I've ever had! I wanted to drink the sauce, but had to settle with sopping it up with whatever bread I could find. =) It's in a great location too! After a day of wandering Millennium Park and the Art Institute, I just walked barely a block to get here. Make sure to get reservations though! It's not that big and was packed even on the weeknight we went."
"Food was very very good, but I took one star off for service.  Waiter left us sitting for a long time before he came to the table, didn't bring bread that other tables had, didn't do a great job of explaining the menu.  Tables were fairly close, so hard to have a private conversation."
I had the special porchetta. It was the best pork meal i I've ever had.
"I had the pleasure of having an amazing dinner and brunch here and would revisit as soon as possible. Their venison burger is out of this world and the buttermilk mashed potatoes are divine. The house poutine with wild boar ragout is amazing; the ragout is deep and rich but not too gamey. They have a great selection of beer, polite staff and beautiful decor. My only complaint is that I found their corned beef hash at brunch extra salty."
"I've been here numerous times and always have loved what I get. The food is wonderful (both dinner and lunch/brunch), the drink lists are solid, and the wait staff has always been superb. Need I also say that this is the only slightly ""fancier"" restaurant my curmudgeony father is willing to go to? If that's not a stamp of approval I don't know what is."
"I must upgrade the rating after having the seared scallops, braised rabbit salad, and after being treated like royalty on several occasional now.  Pate board is more than respectable, and the cheeses are wonderful.  However, I don't recommend both in the same seating, as the combination is artery-injuring.I must know what is in the dressing over the arugula.Good bartending.  Excellent whiskey selection.  I found a whiskey for which I now have a mixture of fear and respect.  I'm looking at you, Ardbeg Day.  Fall Old Fashioned was bitter and lovely."
"A great experience.  The atmosphere, the food, and the service were all top notch.  And some great housemade sodas in the mix as well.  Will definitely go back."
"I ordered the Nicoise Salad, Lentil Aricinis and  a French 75. Neither of the dishes matched what their titles implied -  the salad had no tuna, tomatoes or potatoes; the arincini had no cheese. With more appropriate titles (say... frisee salad with braised slab bacon and poached egg, and lentil balls on butternut puree) I would have given both of these dishes a B-. As it were, I give them C's. The French75 was sweeter than I prefer, and was made with cheap bubbly. Also a B-. Conclusion: The Gage is okay, but is not living up to what it aspires to be. I would not return."
Going for the Gage burger... got to do some minor changes but from what I see I'll enjoy it either way.
"We went to The Gage after getting married to my partner of 18.5 years June 2nd.  YAY marriage equality!  When I reserved a table for 6, I told them the reason we were going to dine there.  When we arrived, the host and staff greeted us with warm congratulations and heartfelt well-to-dos.  The server was AMAZING!  She had a great since of humor and really made our dining experience one to remember.  She started us off with a round of champagne to toast the occasion.  The food:  All I can say is, ""Shut the front door, it was good!""  I ordered the roasted carrot ravioli with morels and peas in a broth so good I wanted to shove my face in it and drink it from the bowl.  My spouce, Tom, ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich and also loved it.  My ""work wife"" ordered the special (salmon on a bed of greens), she too loved her dish.  The other members of the party ordered the lobster roll.  So freakin' good.  They gave me a bite. :)The owner (awesome Irishman with the best sense of humor), brought us another round of bubbly before we ordered dessert,  came to congratulate us, gave us a hysterical Irish toast (so funny),  a little history about the restaurant and totally made the time spent there even more enjoyable.  We will go back time and time again.  I highly recommend going to The Cage after your civil ceremony to make the day more special than it already is.  And don't forget to order the strawberry rhubarb donuts with vanilla ice cream.  AAAHHH!!!!  TASTY!!!   Sláinte chuig na fir, agus go mairfidh na mná go deo."
"Went here on a date and was so glad to finally get a chance to check it out.  After reading fellow yelper reviews I heard great things and couldn't wait to try the place.I had my heart set on trying the thirteen degree.  This was the perfect way to wet my pallet and warm up to getting to know my date.  The drink had the perfect note of pear, not to strong and left me sipping slowly.  The next drink I tried was a traditional Moscow mule.  Now I know it is winter and this is typically a summer beverage but I couldn't resist.  And I was right on the mark.  Made just right I couldn't complain.For bites to eat unfortunately my date decided to order for the both of us since he had been there before and left me with no chance to even look at the menu...no fault of the place but not going for a second date with that fool!  We had the cheese plate, tuna tartar and the fried pickles.  All great plates and could stand on their own.  The service was great and the vibe is just right for a casual first meeting.  I will have to come back to take a gander at the menu on my own though...hopefully a great summer stop from the park!"
Delicious food - especially the bread! - and great service and drinks.  A little pricey for the value but would go back for sure.
"Excellent food, good atmosphere and very professional staff. If you're coming in the evening or mid day .. get a reservation. We were one of the first people at the restaurant and by the time we left there was a long waiting line. I could understand why!"
"Meh. Not sure what the deal is.  Had a reservation for lunch and still had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  Tried the poutine.  Mushy fries with salty gravy and melted cheese.  One bite was more than enough. The people at my table seemed to like it tho - maybe it's a Midwest thing?    Ordered the mushroom sandwich. No flavor whatsoever.    Ordered a side of sautéed sun choke with nuts, raisins and grapes.  Conceptually it should have worked but the sun choke bites were too big and the dish lacked seasoning.   When I was finished the busboy could not wait to grab my plate away from me despite guests in my party still eating.  Not a place I would try again."
"I haven't eaten here so I can't speak to the food though the menu looks great and I saw quite a bit of food served in the bar when I went in for a glass of wine pre-Art Institute. I ended up staying for a couple hours as the Art Institute has bizarre bankers hours--10:30 to 5 except Thursday when it stays open till 8. I met a lovely young DePaul graduate in between jobs--a week between only--and had the best timeA gorgeous place to drink with beautiful, unusual, sophisticated floral display in the middle of the bar. This is my first time as an adult in Chicago and I would definitely return to Gage on future visits. Service is great. The bartenders are cool and I had a great time. (This is the kind of bar I prefer: I like drinking in elegant settings. A few seats down was a many from NYC , where I live 3 months a year, and we had a great talk about his friend's new play, Cougar, which is about to start touring nationally. Nice talk about NYC vs Chicago.)***Last minute went in for soup and sandwich at the bar. Outstanding: half and half is 13. Most in the mid-teens and low 20s even at lunch. Great turkey with horseradish spread plus a special curry/carrot soup AND fries. I don't generally eat fries but, ya know, I'm on vacation and they were just THERE so I could not hardly pass. A great restaurant."
"Celebrated my 50th birthday here with a group of 10 on a Saturday night.  We had requested to sit near the back where it was quieter and this helped a lot for our big group in being able to hear cause the place is loud.Some other friends had a bottle of champagne sent to me for the night, which was really special.Everyone enjoyed their food and desserts.  I had the scallops/short ribs.  Was a weird combo, but tasted great.  Also tried the lobster and grits and that was excellent.  The warm butter cake for dessert was amazing.  I had it without the pears.Service was excellent, attentive but not overly so.  All in all it was a night to remember.  I highly recommend The Gage!"
"Nice little joint.  I ordered a side of green beans (trying to be healthy) and sipped on a decent glass of wine.  It is a little noisy, but it wasn't overwhelming.  I just wished they stayed open later."
"I was in Chicago for business and stayed an extra night to see a firiend from college whose coworkers recommended this place. It was wonderful. The hostess staff was polite and olffered to take my coat and Nieman's bag for me. I enjoyed upscale pub environment and the service was great. We split a brie fondue and I had the steak (amazing) while my friend had the venison burger. For dessert we split the pear bake which was not so good in my opinion but it also wasn't my first choice so no fault to the gage. I really enjoyed the cocktails being severed in copper mugs. The tab was $100 for the food and one cocktail, being from the south I was expecting sky high prices but was pleased to find pricing on par with Memphis. I'd happily recommend this place to anyone traveling to Chicago."
"Trendy place.  My feeling is it's a sort of place to be seen. I had the pontine and it was OK.  The individual ingredients sounded great but I probably should of ordered something more standard.    Others in our party had the burger and fish n chips and rated each high.  A bit pricey.  Not bad at all, but with the variety available, I'd try something new next time."
Good food and great space! It is not the cheapest... but good for a change in pace or a date :)
"I found this gem on Yelp and the reviews were great; it's time to pay it forward! I've taken my girlfriend to this place twice and we have not been upset! The ambiance of The Gage is fantastic. It's quiet enough to have a great conversation but also has the social feel to it. The waiters on both occasions were very helpful and also VERY knowledgable of the menu (cannot be grateful enough for this). The menu is simple. You don't get a plethora of options, which is actually refreshing. The Elk was delicious; it was my first time trying elk and I highly recommend it. The desert was fantastic also. Whether you are going on a first date or want to make it 'the spot', The Gage will not disappoint."
"We are so glad we ended up at Gage for dinner. The atmosphere here is perfect for a higher end but still casual spot. We saw people in full ball gowns coming in for dinner, to others in jeans. The bar has some creative drinks that are not too over the top and has a great welcoming feel. I would recommend grabbing a drink here to get your night started if you don't end up eating here. I loved everything we ordered, but the stand out was the mussels vindaloo appetizer. THey are not your typical mussels in white wine sauce - these are in a curry sauce and are phenomenal. My husband still talks about them, they were that amazing. I had the venison burger, and that was also a meal dreams are made of. If you are in town and trying to figure out where to eat, you should definitely stop here."
"Meh.  I love the idea of The Gage, a beautiful space overlooking the park, but I just wasn't wowed.The pluses are the food -  I got the upgrade Gage burger with camembert and onion marmalade.  I guess I was expecting more of an onion jam, but this was exactly as read: onion+marmalade, so I wasn't a fan (my fault, to be fair).  It was cooked to order and an absolute monster to eat, you definitely won't go hungry here.  The fries were alright.  The scotch egg is amazing!  I basically came here because I'd tried the scotch egg at an event and needed to have some more.The service was sub-par.  I made a reservation, but we seemed to get the worst seat in the house.  I somehow always get seated beside the kitchen, the bussing station or the bathroom.  We managed to score both kitchen noise and bussing station frenzy in one shot.  We could barely hear each other over the noise.  Our server was rather inattentive, she never came back to make sure our orders were ok and how the food was.  I'm not a fan of overattentive service, but one check-in would be nice.  I just kept thinking she's acting as if she thinks we're not going to tip her well...not what I expected from a restaurant with a good reputation.I work near here, so I may be back at some point, but I'm pretty ambivalent it.  Then again, that scotch egg...mmmm"
"Great restaurant and bar. I came in for a drink and they had a solid cocktail list with an eclectic selection of beer and wine. The menu looked amazing but I had dinner reservations elsewhere. Happy I stopped by for a drink, I would definitely return for a meal next time I am in town."
Stopped by for late lunch after a caf boat tour. The waitress was a little snooty and aloofThe venison burger was delicious as were the beet salad and poutine. Generous delicious food. The gentleman with the water pitcher had the best smile and kept our glasses full. He also brought me a menu since she was elsewhere
"Delicious. It was hard to share anything, even with my own family. Very fine food and well presented. Much thought in the presentation of the room, the food and the drinks. You do get what you pay for here, and you pay a healthy amount, but well worth it."
"The food was good,the server was well informed and very friendly. The restaurant is very busy so can be noisy"
Great food. I had the venison burger. Get there early or make a reservation because it is busy at lunch and worth the wait.
Tailgating in style!  Ate here before the bears game.  We had a reservation and I'm glad we did. The place was packed.  Service was great and I thought the brunch menu looked awesome.  We had the lobsta roll and fish and chips.  Both were pretty darn good although the the lobster roll was dressed a bit too much and had a lot of tarragon in it which overpowered the lobster.Beer and drink selections were awesome.  Had a great bloody mary..spicey and strong.  Tables a bit cramed but the inside is nice.  A solid experience at city prices.
"Entering upon this establishment, me and my group had hoped that this was a place for the entire family, on the outside it looks like an all adult place to eat. My group and I were skeptical upon entering, since we had about 4 children and a baby, and I am sure glad that we had decided to stay. This amazing restaurant's accommodation to us individually was amazing. They not only served us with poise and perfection, but made it a place for even the children to enjoy. I believe if you come here and are looking for an amazing server, who will accommodate to your every need or are just having a bad day, ask for Kisong, amazing guy who treated us like his own family.The food was good, a bit filling if I do say myself, but even when I was full I found room for the beautifully plated dishes. Though the food was a bit salty. I most definitely would recommend the fondu as a snack, and enjoyed the light, crunchy, fluffy; fish and chips. P.s. don't worry about the kids, *pst* there is a secret hidden kids menu, with on par food"
"Went here about 6 weeks ago, and it was excellent!  The food was amazing (I had the pub burger, which doesn't seem to be on their menu anymore).  The fries it came with were amazing...so amazing I didn't have room for bread (or dessert, for that matter).  The wine was good and the server was attentive; our food also came out quickly.  It's a somewhat loud atmosphere, but other than that, it was awesmome."
Was here for dinner with a colleague on a cold chicago night. The place warmed me right up with their amazing food and drinks. Highly recommend sitting at the bar and just asking them to bring you a bunch of appetizers. I popped my dutch egg cherry here and havent found one quite like it
The service was excellent and the food was served promptly.  I had heard about the venison burger and it did not disappoint.  The roasted sweet corn ice cream was outstanding and shows a chef who is not afraid to not only step out of the box but put it on the shelf.
"My fiancé and I had a great lunch here today.  I had the fish and chips, amazing chips (fries) with amazing tarter sauce. My fiancé had the The Gage Venison Burger, it was exquisite! An amazing smokey flavor. It was a good choice for a nice Saturday afternoon downtown."
Wonderful dinner at the Gage. Lamb ribs were excellent as was the halibut dish. My husband had the best fish and chips ever. Even for a fancy restaurant they still served the fish wrapped in a piece of the Tribune. Service was great and the outdoor seating was very nice. They have a nice barrier from the pedestrian traffic on the sidewalk. It was a little spendy but worth a splurge.
"See Gastropub in the dictionary, then check out The Gage.I take clients here.  I stop in whenever I get the chance.  It's good - really good.  Great selection of relevant hip brews - be sure to ask your server for food/beer pairings.  I'm a bourbon fan, again - solid choices.  Food is rustic and there's a lot of it.  Simply cannot go wrong here."
"Right across from Millenium park, we went here on Friday night on a (foodie) friend's recommendation. Though it was packed and we didn't have a reservation, we were able to get a drink at the bar and then get a table in under 30 minutes. The menu was impressive and service was great. I enjoyed the roasted carrot ravioli, which was light, fresh and flavorful (and one of the most beautiful presentations I've seen in recent memory). Similarly high marks from my group on the rubbed pork T-bone and free range chicken."
"The duck poutine was really good but kind of over hyped from the reviews. But still something to try. Had ""the regular burger"" and the gage venison burger both were really delicious. The meat had tons of flavor."
"Went to pop a bottle with my baby mama. The servers & bust boys are on point with service. Food?... I got the tenderness of the ribeye, my baby boo got the sexy seared sablefish. Both entrees... Like Marvin Gaye, sexually healing my taste buds. Service & food amazing. Fancy dinner for 2... $180.00 plus tip. Thanks guys."
Great spot for cocktails and food. Food is sourced locally and the menu is unique. The waitress explained that the menu changes often.
The burger was delicious and for being in the loop the price was not bad (about $14 for the burger I believe). Casual yet elegant setting. Every ingredient on the burger seemed homemade from the guacamole to the Pico de gallo. Good place for lunch or dinner
"Fun atmosphere and good location. We split multiple starters and sides to make our meal, which worked out perfectly. 8oz pours for wine by the glass served in a small carafe, so it felt like 2 glasses of wine and lasted the entire meal. Lemon tart for dessert was my favorite dish!FYI, it's definitely loud inside, so keep in mind it might not be the right choice for every occasion. My friend and I definitely struggled to hear each other sometimes."
"We stopped here for dinner after a day in the city and were fortunate to score seats at the bar. Even at 4:30 p.m., the place was packed and there was already an hour wait for tables for people without reservations.The beer selection was fantastic. Great crafts on tap, including the hard-to-find Deschutes (Bend, OR) Red Chair NWPA. They also boast some Chicago beers like Half Ace Gossamer. The can/bottle selection is more extensive, but our draughts were excellent.We started with the lamb meatballs. They were seasoned much like falafel and served with sauce similar to tzatziki. They were moist and served in a spiced sauce that played foil to the cool cucumber flavor. I had the fish and chips after reading other reviews and wasn't disappointed. The fish, in fact, may have spoiled me for future fish and chip endeavors. The coating was crisp and salty and the fish itself was hot and flaky. The homemade tartar sauce was a nice addition. The chips (fries) were nothing special and seemed disappointing in contrast to everything else that was so great. My husband ordered the venison burger, which comes topped with mushrooms, fried jalapenos, and cheese. He raved about it.We passed on dessert because we were meeting friends in Andersonville allegedly for dessert. When those plans didn't pan out, I regretted not ordering the warm butter cake featured on the menu when we had the chance.Service was excellent. We were sitting at the end of the bar with the hustle and bustle of wait staff picking up drinks and putting in orders so it got a little crazy, but the bartenders were attentive, which isn't always the case when ordering food sitting at the bar in other restaurants."
"Hot British hostess... CheckStiff gin drinks... CheckAttentive, knowledgeable waiter... CheckPoutine was exquisite.Daily fish was yummy.Sausage was pretty damn good. They gave me free beignets for my birthday!Great place."
"Great pub right across Millenium park. House cured salmon, hand cut hash and eggs, great ambiance...all good."
"One of my favorite comfort food places ever!  I've never had a bad dish here.  Brunch and lunch are best, but after a show is good, too.  Love, love LOVE the poutine!"
"Came here for lunch one day with a friend, and this place was packed. We had to make a reservation or else I don't think we would've gotten in. The food was decent, and the energy was high. I had half a sandwich and soup. The soup was yummy and hearty, and although the sandwich was also good, the way they make it and toast it makes it kind of hard to eat...The portions are generous and the service was prompt. My only grip is that the tables are so close together that  I'm almost elbow to elbow with the person sitting at the table next to me. When we got up to leave, I had to be extra careful as a squeezed out between the tables, trying not to klutz out and make a mess. And I'm a very skinny girl. So yea, good food, but a very crowded room"
"omggg so good so good!! 1. ambiance- really nice.. not at all too hoity toity2. service- great3. price- not bad! 4. now the food... oh the food! antelope tartar.. omggg the pear, horesradish truffle sauce, quail egg- it was sooo deliciousvenison burger- pretty good, but a little too rich for my taste. the fries were good though with the red wine ketchup was awesome! now.. the reason why this is a 5 rating- the duck..OMG so good. bacon dashi, red onion jam, the duck was just perfectly cooked, the sugar snap peas and carrots were just so perfect. this whole dish totally turned my whole day around.. if not the whole week. SO AMAZING."
"Still one of my favorite places in the city, and very close to my heart for obvious reasons. Want to know? Scroll down)I guess this is dessert week for me 'cause after Gilt Bar's killer pie, I probably just had the best end of the meal of the summer (the year?) at lunch today.Let me introduce to you: A Corny Homage to the Midwest.Crispy, tiny corn beignets;Melted Chocolate fritters;Grilled plums;Salted caramel sauce;Sweet corn gelato.Nothing more to say."
Bison tartare is awesome....!!! Stumbled into this place because everywhere else within vicinity is closed! Been eating here reguarly. Love coming here in the summer as well because the patio/sidewalk seating is open.
"The Gage never disappoints.We weren't able to have a full meal this time around but were able to enjoy the bar.  On a previous visit, I had The Gage Burger which is on my top 10 list of burgers ever.  In retrospect, yes I crave it and somewhat regret not having it.  We weren't all that hungry so went for liquor drinks with some fries and the scotch egg.  The service was fantastic, the food was high quality and the drinks were wonderful.  I wasn't a fan of the scotch egg but that's my preference, not the restaurant.  I do highly recommend The Gage for burgers, charcuterie, desserts and more."
"Every time I visit Chicago I go straight to The Gage. On January 30 I had dinner with work colleagues and we all experienced the best drinks, food, and service ever. You simply must have the Moscow Mule when you go there -- may be the best cocktail I have had in 10 years!  And the stuffed trout wrapped in pancetta was heavenly, not a single bone! I just love The Gage."
"I loved this place. The hustle and bustle creates an awesome atmosphere. You feel like you are in the middle of everything yet somehow in your own little island booth at the same time. The food was AMAZING. Every dish had layers of flavor resulting in mmmm and aaaaamazing repeated like a skipping record. Don't even think about leaving without trying the Poutin. I was not sure, but so glad I did. It was extravagant tasting - delicious roasted duck and some sort of gravy sauce that should be illegal. Our server was gracious and accommodating. Please go here if you have the chance."
"Good food. Busy night and in between bartenders so 'slow service'. Each bartender has a different pour, trust me - experiment to find your right 'pour'. Great times!"
It was my first time in Chicago and I went to Gage. The food was so good and so fast. The ambiance was also good. I prefer the buffalo chicken sandwich.
"Came here for lunch and was surprised by how bustling it was. Make reservations or expect a wait - luckily we did. Food was delicious - had the crimini mushroom soup and mushroom sandwich but heard raves about the burger, too. I really liked the decor - modern and clean, dark wood, nice tiles - and will definitely be back to check out the bar if I find myself in the area."
"I was invited to dine here for a work dinner and it was wonderful. As soon as we walked in the place had a great vibe with young professionals enjoying happy hour. They have a coat check downstairs and we were seated quickly. The service was great, and the market fish I ordered was phenomenal. They boast a pretty good beer menu as well. Kinda pricey to go on a regular basis, but fully recommended for a nice dinner."
"This place works well for anyone looking for dinner near the art museum.  I had the bison tartare for an appetizer and it was great.  I am disappointed that I ordered the fish and chips, I probably should have went for something more exciting.  The only thing lacking is their craft beer selection which was very limited.  A nicer selection would go really well with their menu."
"This was my second or third time at The Gage.  As a lone woman traveling for my work, it's sometimes odd how I'm treated at restaurants.  Here, I am treated respectfully and with a friendly professionalism that complements the excellent food and wine options.  I felt like a princess.  I sampled the fondue appetizer, then had the lemon-pepper salad (amazing flavors), mashed potatoes, and for dessert, the special ice cream sandwich (which sounds plain but isn't!).  It was perfect on the night of the Chicago blizzard (February 2015)!"
"The food has gone seriously downhill. I hate to downgrade one of my favorites but the last few times I've visited the food has been severely below average. The fish in my fish and chips was clearly frozen and not at all fresh. It tasted stale and made me sick after eating it. A brunch visit ended with me being so disgusted with my order that I sent it back and ordered the burger instead. Not only was the brunch special (some sort of meatloaf-looking thing with an egg on it) not good, but they also brought me a burnt and dried-out burger that was inedible. And to add insult to injury, instead of apologizing and offering to bring me something else, the waiter tried to persuade me that the disgusting meatloaf plate was supposed to taste and look like uncooked ground beef and that I didn't understand or appreciate what it was. Excuse me?! Food quality and service has dropped significantly. Time to say goodbye to an old favorite. If I do return, it will be for drinks only."
"I'm addicted to the mussels vindaloo here. Seriously. I can't force myself to order anything else even though there are tons of other delicious things on the menu. And because the BF and I are little fatties at heart, we always ask for extra grilled bread for dipping. Heavenly."
"Quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants downtown.  Menu is concise and unique.  A good twist on new-age american food - awesome salads, seafood options, burgers, unique pub food.  The mussels vindaloo are my favorite with a fantastic curry sauce: a little spicy, but not overpowering.  I also love the Gage for brunch.  They do a mean bloody mary, the crabcakes are a favorite, as is their perfect bagel and lox plate.The ambiance is ideal, fun, happening bar area, and tons of booths and tables, with a very up-scale, hip feeling.  There's also a nice patio on Michigan ave - great for people watching."
Cute lunch spot right next to the Loop's biggest fame - el BEAN.- quiche- monkey bread- some other stuff i cant even remember.
"Pretty mediocre and overpriced--just fine if you are stuck around the art museum or the Palmer House, but for gastropubs, there are far better in the city."
I love this place. Good happy vibe and scrumptious food. Perfect stop if you are going to museums. I hit this spot several times to avoid the hotel food at a conference I was attending and was pleased with the service and quality of food and drink at each visit.
"One of those experiences that will always be salient in mind when recommending the perfect place for quality of staff, product, and ambiance. We had the duck confit poutine to start: incredible! a very different take than any I've previously experienced. For entrees, we had a perfectly prepared venison burger and the creole gumbo that both had us in culinary ecstasy. Our server, Les, then insisted that we try a dessert and he brought us his personal recommendation: peanut butter french silk pie. 'I'm salivating as I type' is all that needs to be said about that.Lastly, Les, our server, provided what you hope for in every dining experience. Thank you, Gage!"
"We stopped by the Gage recently after an afternoon at the Art Institute. Its location on Michigan can't be beat. We were initially put off by the three dollar sign rating ($$$), particularly when looking for a lunch spot, but we found that the lunch menu was actually extremely reasonable.We tried the poutine, which was extremely decadent as expected, but probably something you only want to eat once or twice a year.We both had the Gage burgers, which were AWESOME. Hands down, one of the best burgers I've had in Chicago (I had tried 2 other burgers that same week, all coming up short compared to the Gage's!). I didn't realize initially that the burger would come with fries, which is an awesome offer (I'm looking at you, other places *cough* Au Cheval).Overall, a really great experience. The decor was super cute and the service was good. If you're looking for a phenomenal burger at a great value, try the Gage for lunch!"
"Wasn't sure what to give The Gage, but the 'A-Ok' description helped me decide. It was good, but not awesome. There were a good amount of beers and cocktails to choose from on the menu but a limited food selection. I went with a group before an event at the Art Institute and were left with a small amount of options for sharable apps. That being said, we did find two things to share and they were both pretty good. The place seems busy right around dinner time, but we were able to find a few spots to sit and stand at the bar. I would go here again only if I had an event close by. It won't be a destination for a drink or meal."
"The Gage was recommended to us for dinner by our hotel concierge, and it was definitely a good pick. We were seated quickly without a reservation. The food was delicious - my husband is still raving about his burger, and my chicken was excellent. One downside: I ordered a drink from their cocktail menu and it was literally awful. It tasted like cough medicine - it was so sweet that I couldn't have more then one sip. I told the waiter and he took it off our bill, which was greatly appreciated. But seriously, one of the worst cocktails I've ever had."
"Fun and interesting food and great service!  The poutine was amazing (but very filling); we kept it light after that, and even just had the cheese sampler for a final course. The wait staff were helpful and attentive, but not intrusive.  A memorable evening."
"It was a semi-rainy day when a friend and I had ventured to Millennium Park for a quick walk.  We found ourselves hungry and thirsty and found The Gage to be a close option and were not disappointed.  This spot does fill up with the after-work crowd, so if you are planning on stopping by in the afternoon, I would recommend trying to arrive on the early side.  The ambience is great for this place.  All the tables lining the bar area are fairly small and close together, so get ready to get cozy with your neighbors.  They do have a large bar if you are interested in being close to the drink-making action.  The service is also great.  They are very attentive and have their system down for making sure you get the right bill in a very timely basis.They have an extensive menu of drinks whether you want to try a glass of wine, a taste of whiskey or one of their handcrafted cocktails.  There really is something for everyone.  I tried a Thirteen Degrees, one of their seasonal cocktails, which was not too sweet and very delicious.  If you are looking for a small bite, I definitely recommend their Wild Boar Poutine (although maybe not a great option if you are looking for lighter fare).  It is probably the best I have had and that includes versions I have had while in Canada.  The gravy was delicious, the wild boar was flavorful and the cheese was to die for.A perfect stop as part of a tour of the Millennium Park area!"
"I got a crabcake as a starter and it was absolutely delicious. The service was pretty decent the whole time too. My entree - the fish and chips were all right. Found the fish a little too bland, though the dipping sauce with it was pretty good. I'll probably go back and get the burger next time. That's what I got the last time. Pretty darn good."
"Great experience here last week, our server was amazing, I would say one of the top servers I've ever had. We ordered the mussels and Bison Tartare and both were amazing. You get a huge bowl of mussels in a great broth with some rustic bread for dipping. I was actually quite surprised as to how good the mussels were. The Bison Tartare was excellent. It had a nice kick to it and the meat was super flavorful. I loved it!I will definitely be returning after last weeks experience. Start to finish everything was great!"
"Seated rather quickly. This very fine restaurant wasn't pretentious.  Initial service was a bit slow but once the wine arrived it was smooth. Not a bread and butter person, they have good both. Beet salad and chewy Stick Lamb Ribs are worth going there separately. GREAT! Chicken wasn't overly impressive but I was shocked by how perfect the steak was. Pricey but if you like good food, wine an location. It's worth the price of admission. Great job"
"This was one of the best meals I had in Chicago. Came here for brunch and considered coming back for dinner. The brunch punch (which changes daily) was fantastic and if you plan on having more than one drink at brunch worth the $28 for the pitcher....it was quite strong. The eggs in purgatory are phenomenal. I can't exactly tell you what the sauce was made of but it was great. Just dip some bread in that sauce and go to town. Pork belly, soft cooked eggs, cracklins and a perfectly slightly spicy savory sauce. Plus the patio doesn't hurt when the weather is nice. Make it an early brunch (11) or prepare to wait. I loved this place and would gladly return."
The best meal we've has thus far this trip- and we've eaten well. I had the duck; my husband the trout. Both exquisite. The wine prices initially threw me: $16 for a glass but it's an 8 ounce pour so it's like one and a half to two glasses depending on where you are.  Good food; good service. All good!
"We went to Gage with high hopes based on the great reviews, but we were really disappointed.First the good...Service was excellent and friendly. The atmosphere is warm, woody, and very nice. The menu is interesting and varied.The salads we ordered, yellow beets and a mixed green, were fresh and delicious, and prices on all dishes were fair for the portions and interesting menu.The not so good...The house Poutine blended all the flavors into one gloppy overly heavy dish.The Mussels Vindaloo was average at best. Although the sauce was very tasty on its own, it had little to do with vindaloo and did not compliment the mussels at all.The brussel sprouts were bitter and overpowered by cheese and pork.Overall, it's an ambitious interesting menu, but most of the food lacks subtlety and balance. Lots of better choices."
"Our last meal in Chicago... *sniffles*It took us a while to figure out where we should have our last meal, but I'm so happy we decided to go here!  The service was wonderful and I loved that our server took the time to explain the specialties of the house as well as his personal recommendations.  We ended up ordering the poutine to share and I got the venison burger.The food was pretty darn phenomenal.  The venison burger was perfectly seasoned and just melt in your mouth AWESOME.  The poutine... OMG.  We have to get this out in CA!  We also decided to split a chocolate mousse for dessert, because well... everything is better with dessert :)I cannot say enough about the wonderful service and food.  I will be back The Gage!"
"My friends and I had a pretty wild time in Chicago. We ended up at The Gage for Sunday brunch. I thought the name was pretty dumb. The tile work inside is impressive and classy. I loved the old vintage sinks in the basement bathroom. The burger was excellent. The applewood smoked bacon was a nice side. A guy came over to our table and explained the process of how they make butter. My friend couldn't finish her fish and chips so I ate the fish and it was good. The poutine was alright. For a name that sounds so sexual, I was not too blown away by the poutine. The service was great. They were able to accommodate our party of 7 with short notice on the reservation."
"I was in town on business, and wanted to meet up with a friend for some drinks and some light bites.  Neither of us were overly familliar with the neighborhood, but after yelping 'good food and beer' we ended up at the Gage.  The atmosphere seems to be dictated by the area- lots of people in suits (on a Thursday night when the Bears were playing...) but this did not deter me and my Toms.  We had a reservation, but found a place at the bar faster- so we went with that.  The blonde bartender was the sweetest person ever!  She was prompt, friendly, and had great suggestions!  We tried all sorts of different beers.  Being from Philadelphia, I didn't expect that Chicago would be able to compete, but we were surprised by the awesome micro-brews at the The Gage.  I forget the names of the brews we tried, but they were all awesome- and not familliar- which in my book is awesome.To compete with the high ABV's of the beer, we ordered some light bites.  I'm a vegetarian so I'm a bit of a pain- i must warn you.  We got the cheese fondu, the chickpea fritters, and then we split the risoto of the day which had some root vegetables.  Each and every dish was a treat in its own right.  The 3 dishes together were all we needed for the night.  Everything was delicious, soul-satisfying comfort food.Chicago does it right!  Props to the Gage.  Next time i'm in town on business, I'll be back!  And to boot- its across the street from the Bean in Millenium Park!!!"
Had a friend who worked here for awhile when they first opened so we used to frequent every so often.  Food was good from what I remembered and the ambiance was definitely lively!  Drinks were also good but pricey.  I've tried the venison burger and a few of the appetizers and the food was good but not overwhelming for the price. Great location though and proximal if you're walking around near Millenium Park.
"Excellent service and ambience.The food was exceptionally tasty. Scallops, beets, venison burger, and lobster roll all stood out as far and above the call of duty in quality. The cocktails I had were also brilliant. I especially loved the refreshing What's the Word. Also enjoyed the Vieux Carre.Excited to come back here on our next visit to Chicago."
"Great little place on Michigan across from Millennium/Grant Parks.   On a nice day, the sidewalk is wonderful and they have a nice partition to block it off for a more private atmosphere. We had Sunday lunch.  My Caprice Quiche was terrific and the Bloody Mary was perfectly spicy.  My husband had a burger that was on a really puffed up shiny bun that looked amazing.  Almost regretted my order when I saw his, but mine was delicious too!Every meal that came out of the kitchen looked great!  Lobster rolls, fish and chips...but the burgers looked most impressive.    Will definitely be back."
"This spot is down the street from my company's Chicago office and whenever I am in town I go here. The food is incredible and interesting, the wine is quality and the cocktails are artisan. Atmosphere is very suits and mahogany meets french bistro. It;s busy but I can always get in. What's not to love?SO GOOD!"
"The drink mixology is unique, but the food menu is small and overpriced. Since the location is ideal if you're visiting Millennium Park, I'd recommend stopping in for a drink and eating somewhere else."
"Is it possible to be ""under the radar"" when you're located on Michigan Ave. across from Millennium Park?Apparently, it is if you're The Gage.Don't get me wrong, this is a popular spot that is packed with cheerful patrons. But let's face it, this isn't mentioned among foodies or hipster circles the way Girl & the Goat, Au Cheval, Purple Pig, Publican, Avec, & Belly Q often are.The menu is Aussie inspired which means it's a bit eclectic and borderline weird, but the service and food are actually solid. What else might you expect from a country that loves vegemite the way Americans love ketchup-? No Bloomin' Onion here.Our server was very cool; you could tell he was passionate about the food and that he enjoyed serving patrons. He was very helpful assisting my wife navigate her way through the menu descriptions for recommendations and he also provided guidance on ordering the right quantity of food even discouraging us from ordering too much food. The food was very well-executed Gastro-Pub cuisine with a little Aussie twist here and there, but nothing too forced. Overall, this place is underrated and would be a welcome addition in almost any neighborhood."
Had a reservation and were accommodated when we arrived early. CourteousAnd friendly service. Burgers arrived hot with tasty.
"Not new, but new to me!Staying at The Palmer House used to mean limited options for a reliably good, bring my mother to, meal nearby... not no more!Great selection of draft beers, the food was outstanding, and the service tops!"
Conveniently located right across from the park yet seated immediately during lunch hours (just before noon). After confirming portion sizes I decided to have the poutine apetizer as my meal and I was not disappointed.  What a fun twist to the traditional dish and definitely enough for a lunch. The jalapeños added a delightful kick and the cheese curds were perfectly melty. Others at my table tried the burger and the soup and turkey sandwich and no one was disappointed!
"831 reviews, does The Gage really need my review?  Damn straight it does!  Because you can never give enough praise when a restaurant gets it right.My daughter and I came here after the Lichtenstein exhibit at the Art Institute.  How do you follow a WHAM display of art like that?  With a WHAM meal here.  We had a reservation and were immediately seated at a great table.  The server was extremely patient while we read and debated what to get/share.  We decided on splitting the fried pickles and summer squash appetizer which was delightful.  We then ordered the Turkey and the Vegetable sandwiches, each of us partaking of a half.  I adored the Turkey and she adored the Vegetable so neither sammie felt neglected.  The fries were superb and my Mother would have so approved of the tiny ketchup dishes!What really impressed me was the service and care.  Not only were we treated royally by our server but had two different managers come by and seem to really care if we were liking our experience.  We were too full to try dessert but I did have a great cup of coffee before we strolled across the street to bask in the sunlight at Millennium Park.  What a glorious day in a magnificent city with a delicious meal.Well done, Gage, review 832 (the most important, duh!) approves!"
"I really just love The Gage.  If I worked or lived over here it would likely be trouble-for my liver and my waistline.  They've got a great line-up of beer (great craft brew options), wine, and cocktails and a menu that can do no wrong.  My stand-by for a quick snack is the Scotch Egg...if you're a fan of hard-boiled eggs just trust me on this one!  The space itself is also great-open, simple, and just so darn good-looking...they had me at hello!"
"Cool spot, nice bar and menu that has something for everyone."
"Great atmosphere, decadent poutine, solid mussels, disappointing ceviche & escargot and perfect braised rabbit salad. The Bass was a tossup b/c I don't know if was poorly executed or I just don't like Bass.Worth putting on your list. I would come back and explore more of the menu."
"I've been to The Gage three times and each time it has been pretty fantastic.The food has been consistently awesome.  The poutine fries are one of the best things I have ever eaten - love the addition of the wild boar and the cheese is super gooey and awesome.  On this last visit, I had one of the specials, which was a BLT made with some special, apparently non-US bacon.  It was kind of a bizarre bacon - kind of gamey as one of my dining companions said after I decided he needed to try it - but good nonetheless.  We tried two of the desserts and both were really quite outstanding, even though I wanted to mix the two plates together because everything seems like it would have matched well.  Great ice cream on the cream cheese mousse and great everything on the peaches.  Portions vary in size.  Some of the sandwiches are quite enormous and the mussels appetizer looks rather daunting as it comes out in a huge bowl, though it is mostly the shells.  It's all appropriate for the price point, in my opinion.The beverage menu is not enormous but there is a fair number of beers and mixed drinks to choose from.  Something for everyone.  And Fentiman's ginger beer - love that stuff so it's nice to see it in a restaurant!  The service has always been excellent - the most recent visit, we had a very awesome server that fit our table so well and who did a great job of playing to the crowd.  We were a bit crazy so he did a nice job of giving it back, which I always like - personality is important.  Plus, he did a great job of giving drink recs and also giving us the rundown on the specials.  If I knew his name, I'd share it because he is on top of my list of fantastic serving folk. The food came out rather quickly for a lunchtime where we saw the place fill up fast.  We also got out drinks in a timely fashion and plenty of water refills, which was nice.So, yes, this location is in a pretty touristy area, because the park and museum are right across the street, but it doesn't feel touristy to me.  It's loud but not obnoxiously so, and the interior is very inviting.  It's the kind of place, as we decided during lunch today, that you *want* to find as you're wandering in an unfamiliar city, that could be the food high point of your trip.  That is a good thing in my book.  Well worth a visit!"
Came here for lunch and it was packed! The food was delicious and you will not be disappointed. It's near the museum and Millennium park. It's also within walking distance of Union and Ogilvy Station. I had their half sandwich and cup of soup. For my sandwich I had the mushroom sandwich and had the soup of the day which was a chilled watermelon soup with peaches and mint leaves. It was unique and refreshing for a hot summer day. The fries were delicious too! Everything was great!
"Delicious meal and excellent service.  It was a bit too loud for quiet conversation, but in fairness the US was playing in the World Cup that night and the bar was packed with fans."
"This was a super cool place that we stopped in while we were visiting Chicago. The atmosphere was fun and vibrant. Along with the cool vibes, the bar staff was quick to make drinks and very friendly. We had a decent wait as we were there during the rugby game. However we were able to grab drinks at the bar and wait. Once we were seated our eyes were bigger than our stomaches and we only got to finish the poutine. Then we had french toast, and eggs benedict which were also great."
"Stumbled into the Gage for an early dinner after sightseeing in Millenium Park. Place was empty around 5p when we walked in. I've always wanted to try this place and it did not disappoint. Started the shrimp appetizer, which was TO-DIE-FOR! Shrimp was cooked to perfection and the sauce had a slight kick to it that really brightens the dish. Friend did a rabbit arugula salad which was equally well-done, rabbit was melt-in-your-mouth tender and flavorful. For entrees I had the salmon, which was again cooked to just the right temperature. My only complaint was that the corn relish on top tasted a bit too sweet, almost like canned corn. The other two entrees were elk (!!) and the lamb tenderloin, both were also excellent. All-in-all, a very satisfactory meal. Can't wait to go back!"
"Burger was delicious and juicy, curry fries also divine.  But the snapper was TEENY-TINY and meh!  For $35!   Whyyyyyy?  I call shenanigans.  TOTAL rip-off, and so disappointing, the fish is why we went.  And the soup, presented with much fanfare, tasted like water.  What does this joint want to be?  They suck at fancy food. It should just be burgers and beer, that's what they know how to do....don't go for anything else."
"Excellent service, excellent food. Had a scotch egg app and gumbo for lunch, both were amazing."
"The Gage was suggested to me by the concierge at the Trump Towers. And I'd have to say, it was mighty good. We came for Sunday Brunch and it was super tasty. I had the ""Eggs in Purgatory"" Roasted Tomato Salsa, House Smoked Pork Belly, Queso Fresco, Chicharrons. Ok, not the most healthy item on the menu, but SO good! My other gang members chose Southern Chicken and Biscuits Egg Over Easy, Fried Chicken Liver and Potato Hash, Smoked Tasso Ham Gravy (The Tiny gang member needed more gravy and actually ate the whole thing!) And the last order was, House Made Corned Beef Hash Poached Eggs, Hollandaise. Kid seemed to like the nicely cut potatoes in this hash. Best part, it's right across the street from Millennium Park. Super convenient for a gang of goofy tourists."
"To get in on a Friday, I had to make a reservation on the Monday before. The food did not disappoint. We had the lobster risotto, the bison tartare, the halibut, coffee rubbed pork, and a side of mashed potatoes.  Everything had a great flavor, and our waiter, despite getting hassled by the couple at the next table who complained about the ""stale bread"", was great for us. When I was curious about the buttermilk ice cream, he got us a scoop to see if we'd like it. (We didn't.) BUT they had root beer gelato, which made my day. We then had a Scotch flight, which was great.I will definitely be back. Had a great time, the atmosphere was busy, but not overwhelming."
"'Gastropub' does not really do this place justice.  Superior food (the carpaccio and the rack of Elk are not to be missed), and an excellent wine list that has better value than you might expect on Michigan Ave combine to make this one of my absolute favorite places in Chicago to eat, and that covers some territory.   The bar can get crowded and loud, but that is just part of the atmosphere - this is a casual place, and ideal for people who love great food and alcohol without the pretense.  I cannot recommend highly enough."
"Okay.... okay.....before you read any further you must realize that this review was written by ME.... not some wild boar or venison, or even scotch egg eating kind of person.  I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches off of paper towels at lunchtime and macaroni and cheese right out of the pot with a spoon while I watch the 6 o'clock news.  I'm just not a fancy-schmancy person.That said, I was very comfortable here.  The place is warm and inviting without being stuffy.  And, the lunch menu is quite complete. Even a simple eater like me could find a few things to choose from.  I decided on the Soup of the Day: chilled watermelon, which when I asked for the shrimp carpacio to be left off the waiter didn't even bat an eye.  That soup was the PERFECT anecdote for a hot Chicago afternoon!  Then I had the Mixed Greens Salad which was topped with cashews, smoked cheddar, apples, dried cherries, and ginger vinaigrette.  It was AMAZING!  Flavorful, yet light.The dessert selection was fantastic, but I must say that I was more than a little disappointed with my brown butter cake with caramel ice cream.  Silly me, I was expecting CAKE.  Instead I got a glass filled with burnt tasting croutons, and layered with ice cream and an overly chocolaty goo and cherries.  Too many strong flavors.... and none of them all that good."
"Sticky lamb ribs, scotch egg, and Irish breakfast are current favorites. Great service, fun brunch spot, and cool atmosphere(the building was a hat factory a century ago; there are photos in the restaurant of the workers and machines). I would recommend this place to anyone who asked."
"Service was extremely slow, they had just a vegetarian soup on the menu for lunch, nothing else."
An overpriced disappointment that failed to deliver in all but one way. A restaurant should serve food at a reasonable speed. Great job! You did one thing right. There use it sucked. Our entrees were like a bad tasting better looking version of you Gould find at any run of the mill restaurant.
"I live in Atlanta, but visit Chicago often, so when some friends suggested the Gage, I thought why not? I have had the pleasure and dining and drinking at some of the great Atlanta gastropubs - Leon's, the Porter, the Publik - so I figured the Gage would be more of the same. Well it was. The Gage is basically a hipster bar with very good food. We went on a particularly busy night - conference crowd plus Bears pre-season game - so it was good we made reservations. The bar area is pretty well laid out, but I felt the dining room in the front was cramped. The food had a lot of standard items I have seen at similar restaurants - bone marrow, jelly, scotch egg, bacon, olives, pub frites, house-made sausages, kale salads - and some things that were unique. Overall the food was good, but expensive; the beer and alcohol list extensive; and the service just okay."
"This place is awesome!!! The food is amazing, the selection of drinks/beers is good, and the service is amazing!!! I almost took off a star because they definitely try to pack them in and the tables are entirely too close, but I think it's not too bad... If you want something intimate where you have a lot of personal space, this is not the place for you. While the quarters are tight, it's loud enough that you can't overhear the people next to you without concentrating on it... Anyways, again the food is amazing! The desert is even better!!! This place is a must, but make sure you make reservations on the weekends! The bar area is first come first serve so this is also an option..."
"Coupla things: 1. It's a 300-seater. Should be able to handle you and your closest friends. 2. They take reservations, including brunch. And they weren't snooty when we were late. 3. Bread and butter, on the table. But they ask you first. So you have the option to NOT gluten yourself to death before your meal arrives. 4. It's super convenient to the Book of Mormon. If you've got the golden tickets, you can't really leave a three block perimeter of the theater. Because anything could happen. All that aside, THEY PUT BRUSSEL SPROUTS IN BRIE. Party people. This is EPIC.My friend had the lobstah roll, it was awesome. I had the cheeseburger, it was a cheeseburger (the fries were exceedingly meh). THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS THOUGH, THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS PRACTICALLY ASKED ME ON A DATE....but I already had plans with a bunch of Mormons."
"Great location, trendy atmosphere, great service and food. They have a nice terrace on Michigan Avenue."
"Girlfriend and I recently came here last month. Being from So. Cal I'm familiar with the gastropub scene. I thought this spot was great. We heard  We had to make reservations which we did. I got a great local craft beer, my gf got wine. We started with the lobster seafood bisque which was one of the best I've ever had. I could of had 3 bowls. Main course we had the venison burger and I had the fish. cant remember what fish but it was amazing from what I remember. Little pricey for a gastropub but based on the food, $$$ three of these seems about right. Would return"
"Excellent lunch spot. You can beat the wait by heading to the bar area where there's lots of seating. I tried the short rib banh mi one day and then the spring lettuce salad and duck poutine another day, and it was all outstanding."
"Atmosphere is wonderful, food was great, but service was a little lacking.  Not that we had any sort of real negative experience, just when you factor in everything for what you pay, it could have been a little better."
"Sooo good! I had the brisket pot pie and my other half had the fish and chips! We had the fried pickles as well. Everything was delicious. It was busy at around 2pm so service was a little slow but we got a table right away. Everyone was very pleasant and nice. The pot pie crust was golden brown and flakey, the horseradish creme  friache, and the brisket hit the spot. Fried pickles and the fish had a delicious batter. Will definitely come here again! Cheers!"
"Uh-MAZINGbison tartare = 5 starsmussels in vindaloo broth = 5 starslobster risotto = 3 stars (only because I thought it was too sweet, I prefer savory)venison burger = 5 starsAnd they make a great old fashioned :)"
"3 1/2 stars.  We had a nice early dinner here after a day at the Art Institute.The Scotch egg was pretty good.  It paired nicely with the mustard, though I still would have liked something with a little more acidity or crunch on the plate.  We weren't huge fans of the scallops with Chinese broccoli, Korean shortribs and kimchi.  The scallops were cooked nicely, but the flavor profile didn't feel quite balanced to us.The pork chop was fantastic.  It was cooked perfectly, nice char on the outside, tender, juicy and flavorful in the middle."
"Great brunch here - had the ""regular"" burger, which was cooked as requested, and tasted fresh. The corned beef hash was delicious as well. Prices were fair.Bloody Mary was maybe the best I've ever had. Even had a little baby pickle in it along with the usual suspects (olives and celery).Minus one star because getting the check/paying took longer than necessary!Still, I'd come back."
"The Gage is one of my 'go to' places. They put together an evening that isn't pretentious, yet the kitchen and staff combine excellent ingredients into flavors that I keep thinking about for days. Everything that I have tried has been equally as good, although the pork chop is my favorite. The mixology is also excellent as is the beer program. The space is a dark wood, linens, candles sort of thing that works nicely for conversations. All of this is wrapped up with a staff who will 'foodie' it up with you to talk about the dishes, drinks, where the ingredients came from and such."
"I was pleasantly surprised by The Gage.  I sat on the patio around 9pm on Tue Aug 19.  The service was excellent.  The food was very good, especially the basic burger with grilled onions.  The prices were a bit on the high side, but you have to expect that being on Michigan Avenue across from Millennium Park."
"In a prime spot right next to millenium park, we came here after seeing all the rave reviews. Let me just give you a brief rundown:service: great! waiter was knowledgeable and attentiveambience: like an upscale pubfood: fish and chips were excellent, lunch specials here are a great value (half sandwich of your choice, a soup and side of fries), portions are decent size and very tasty. My bf had the pork belly banh mi and it was especially good. highly suggest trying any of the chef specials of the moment, but if new isnt your thing the old classic fish and chips wont steer you wrong. lots of beer on tap too, next time I'm gonna check out if they have a happy hour"
"Stopped in for lunch on a Friday. It's a nice restaurant bar with decent food.The Southern Tier & 312 were both good beers (although I liked the Southern Tier better - more hoppy).Appetizer:House PoutineWildBoar,StewedVegetables,CurdCheese,Fries- The meat was good. It reminded me of fries & gravy. Entrees:1) Seared Sea ScallopsButterLettuce,GrilledRedOnion,LemonVinaigr­ette - pretty good2) ""The Regular"" Burger - a little salty according to my sister, but overall wasn't bad3) Roasted Woodland Mushrooms (with watercress, radicchio, pecorino, truffle aioli, filone) - loved this sandwich. It came with some good slaw as well. 4) 16oz. Natural Aged American RibeyeParsley,Garlic,Tomato,SartoriReserve - it's not at the level of a steakhouse, but is okay for this kind of establishment.The server was attentive and the food came out within a reasonable time."
"The staff and workers were excellent and polite.The tables were a little small and tight ...[I don't like having food passed over my head].the Menu was limited but there was something for every taste. I came because I knew they had oysters and they knew what Mignonette sauce was, Boy do they know what Mignonette sauce is .It was the best I have had.Oysters and the burger I saw would have been enough and a Bar seat.I'll be Back for at least that."
Great experience and great food. Had a great bartender who was very personable and made the experience enjoyable. I was also lucky enough to strike up a great conversation with another customer. All in all a classy and fun environment. I had the roasted chicken vegetables and mashed potatoes. Every bite was extremely flavorful. I really wanted dessert but I was too full...I did get the cappuccino and that was lovely on the walk back to the hotel. Highly recommend this place!
Great loop bar with delicious pub food.  Very popular so get there early or make reservations.
"LOD 11Walked into the place on the fly and glad I did.  The mussels are so *amn good we used the spoon to drink the broth, okay we used the same spoon, HA!Bison Tartare is delicous, oysters yummy, and the burgers were good too.If I lived in the neighborhood I would def be a regular especially to get my mussels on!"
"Friday lunch @ 11:30am, we were given the choice of either waiting for a table (90 minutes) or sit at the bar.  Bar it was.We were provided menus and ordered whatever was on tap. and then the food.i ordered a seared sea scallop salad with butter lettuce, grapefruit, and i cant remember what else. was craving something light (considering this was like a gastropub). amazing. order it as is, dont do dressing on the side. it was amazing.my bf ordered the fish n chips. equally amazing. so yummy. perfectly crisp, fried batter, flakey fish, and crisp fries.Food win!minus 1 star on the price, plus 1 star on the food. hey, you get what you pay for.then we had a pleasantly buzzed walk (i know, weaksauce right?) around millenium park (across the street) and the chicago museum of art (across from millenium park) for the rest of the afternoon. =)"
"Great place for everyone to grab dinner or drinks.  Perfect balance between fancy and casual / bar and restaurant.  Think business dinner to first date to friends gathering to family dinner.  Can't go wrong.  Main - I had the ribeye.  Appies - scallops, venison carpaccio, sausage plate, scotch egg.  Awesome stuff."
"Classy place.  Seems like a great place to get drinks; I was pleased that they had a semi decent selection of scotch/whiskey (But I'm spoiled by NYC so I'll have to see).  Great location by the park so I would def. stop by here.  I was not able to try the food, but some of it seemed really appealing.  I will have to stop by again and give it a shot."
Came for the first time to eat by myself (avoiding colleagues on a business trip). Solid food and wine. Friendly service. I recommend because prices are descent for what they are offering. Had the Amish chicken and beet salad.
"As a disclaimer, I typically don't like American food.  My girlfriend persuaded me to come here because she likes good beer and to spend time in the Loop.We started off with bread and good butter.  I have to admit, both were excellent.  I know it's just an appetizer, but the bread tasted freshly baked and the butter melted on the knife.My girlfriend ordered the cheese fondue, which came with a decent amount of bread.  I tried a little but had no real opinion; she seemed to like it.I ordered the cheapest item on the menu, the $11 burger.  I haven't eaten a burger in a year or two, but this one was well-cooked and just the right blend of juicy and dry (I don't like when the juices run everywhere).The beer selection was good.  We ordered a porter and a stout.My major complaint is that the bathroom only had cold water.  I say cold, but it was really freezing.  Maybe this was due to the recent polar vortex, so I don't know whether to blame the management.  Overall, I wouldn't return because of the hard-to-park location, but I might get a burger or beer from time to time if I lived closer."
"Another fantastic meal here. If all they served was the wild boar poutine the place would still be packed, but they offer all kinds of rarely-seen delectables: scotch eggs and fried pickles and duck breast and venison. The poutine, though...I sort of just want to bury my face in it and never come out. That's cool, right?For a place sooo popular and trendy, the staff was unfailingly warm. It's also one of the few restaurants that functions equally well for drinks, sharing a casual app, special occasions and even large events. Price-wise I find it well in line with neighboring spots, and between the atmosphere and the food, I'm quite happy to spend money here.Pro tip: if you want to have a real conversation with your companion(s) and weather is at all permitting, ask for a table outside. High foliage blocks the view of Michigan Avenue but the noise level is significantly lower than inside."
"Had a lovely lunch here over the weekend.  Our party of four was sat outside, in their front patio area on the sidewalk across from Millennium Park.  This is a high-traffic, tourist-heavy area, but we were camouflaged by thick green plants that, while seated, reached well above head-level.  It was a nice setup.   We all ordered sandwiches, that were well-received by all.  I opted for the 1/2 sandwich + 1/2 soup : Chicken sandwich with peppers, queso, pineapple slices + cheese on soft bread + tomato soup with creamed goat cheese and avocado.  Both were really good.  There was a little mix-up with our table's soup.  It didn't come out first as it should have, and we had to remind our server that we ordered it after the sandwiches were served - but otherwise, service was decent. From what I saw of the interior, there's a nice, classy feel to the dining space.  A solid dining / drinking option in the heart of the loop."
Food good. Service excellent. Recommend venison burger if you know what's good for you.
"Definite winner.  With two others for lunch.  Oddly, all had the same thing; the Mushroom sandwich.  Side of roasted cauliflower.  Service was crisp and professional.  Would definitely go here again.  Want to try sister restaurant, Henri, after having such a positive experience at the Gage."
"I went here with a very large group, last minute. The Gage handled our group very well! We had an amazing male server who take care of all of our needs and answered all questions!I ordered the caesar salad and fish&chips. The caesar was good, but very fishy. The fish and chips were alright, but like another reviewer said - they are lacking in spices and flavor. I thought the Guinness batter would give them a good flavor but I did not taste it at all.Other friends that ordered the duck seemed to like it more than I liked my meal. We left and decided that about 50% of our group liked their meal.+1 star for good service and +2 stars for my friends liking their meals."
Poutine. 'nuff said.
"Hands down, one of my top three favorite places to eat in Chicago.  And, hands down my favorite mussels dish.  I've ordered a variety of things from the Gage and it's all been stellar (but the mussels are absolutely to die for). Do it. Trust me and do it."
"Service was great, our waiter was perfect. Venison burger was really good as well as the roasted chicken breast.  We would definitely go back."
Interesting menu. Try the venison burger or the Bison tar tar. Good place to go for late dinner- atmosphere is energetic and the food is crazy good!
"Went to dinner here this past Saturday and this place was packed! We had reservations and were seated promptly. To start, we ordered a couple dozen oysters, beet salad and caesar salad. All were delicious. Our table got a side of the brussel sprouts which I highly recommend. Everyone loved them. For my entree, I ordered the basil steamed halibut. It was perfectly cooked but I did find a hair in the fish. Not pleasant. Our server handled it very well and notified the kitchen and brought another piece of fish. We also received complimentary dessert and a apology from management which we appreciated. Overall the food and service were very good."
"This was my first visit here - a perfect Sunday brunch spot downtown.  Well, I don't really go downtown for brunch now that I think of it.  I didn't pick the place.  That being said however... the food was excellent, the service good, and the experience overall excellent.  At our table, we had (for a group of 6) a wide variety, from breakfast (eggs benedict) to lunch (venison burgers).  I had the salad with seared scallops, so I can definitely recommend that.  I'd like to think that I'll come back here later, and have another good experience.  If I do, I'm guessing this place will get a 5 star rating"
Met an old friend here for dinner.  The reviews are accurate.  Great food in a lively atmosphere in the shadows of Millenium park.  We went on a weeknight.  They had our reservation table available on time.   I heard about the scotch egg (ground pork sausage wrapped around hard boiled egg and deep fried). Waiter recommended antelope tartar.  Both were delicious appetizers.I had the venison burger and my pal had the fish.  Thoroughly impressed with everything. Great craft beers to choose from.  Expect some background noise and tables in close quarters.
"Stopped by for lunch and was seated out on the patio after the hostess sized me up.  I've never had a hostess look me up and down so obviously before seating me.  I didn't  know what to do with that.  Maybe I just looked particularly nice that day :-) I had the chicken sandwich which was good although when ever I took a bite all of the toppings slid out and the bun got really soggy.  They have a good wine and beer selection and my water glass was always full which was great because it was a scorcher.  Waitress wasn't warm and fuzzy but she wasn't rude either.  Fine with me.  I'm not sure I would go back though. I really wasn't wowed.  It was all just ""fine""."
Stopped by for a refreshment between visiting the Art Institute and running off to our boat tour... Very swanky and lounge-like feel as we sat down at the bar and ordered our drinks. A great variety of cocktails and alcohol and the bartenders were very polite and attentive.Would love to return and have a meal here. Great time and very close to the art institute and the park.
"Great meal here. Ribeye was superb, just melted on your taste buds. Restaurant was a bit packed and loud, but still really enjoyed the experience."
"loved the atmosphere! Very nostalgic decor/design. I had the scallop salad, which was fantastic, once you get past the idea of what a salad typically looks like :) Ordered the brussel sprouts for an app- eh- i have had way better. Although if they had just grilled them, and had a char and crunch, it would have worked better with the brie / bacon. BF ordered the half sandwich/salad, he said it was pretty good. NOW- the highlight of the meal- the chocolate ganache tart thing- OH MY GOODNESS! The egg shaped item on top is actually malt ice cream, which was divine! Once you broke through the choclate tart shell, caramel starting oozing out- uhmmm, yes, delicous!!! I posted a picture, but did even want to pause to take it, b/c this thing looked so good. A bar grill that has a pastry chef - slam dunk!"
"Despite the great decor and absolutely stylish basement bathroom and hipster choice of music in said bathroom, all the food we ordered was bland, and had to be salted/peppered (and I am usually not a huge fan of salt). The chef must have been having a bad day."
So this is a limited review based on drinks. I came here after watching a movie in Millennium park with some good friends. They highly recommended The Gage and I could see why. The place is well kept and designed. The staff is  very  friendly and attentive. The drinks were mixed perfectly and strong (mixed so well they can creep up on you).  Next time I come back to Chicago I will have to try their food.
"Came here during lunch on a Friday and it was packed! The host wasn't too friendly either, to the point that I almost regretted coming in given that I was in a time crunch..However, after an hour wait, I was able to find a spot at the bar and the waitress was able to turn things around with her superb service.. I went for basic food, fish and chips and a side salad, the server offered me the option of half portions, which was great cause it would have been a lot! Food and drinks came super fast! Prices are high but reasonable given the quality of the food and the location..In general, I was able to get out in time, didn't feel rushed and had excellent food and service, I'll definitely come back, but not without a reservation ;)"
We went here after visiting the art institute. It is right by it. We both for drinks. Cocktails are about $12 and beer is $6. Great service and fun environment.
"Get the pate board. That's really all you need to know.I went during their 5th anniversary celebration. They had specials from the original menu and $5 drinks- two local beers and a 9 year bourbon, plus a ginger cocktail with the bourbon. Ridiculous deal considering the regular price of their drinks!"
"In looking for a place that was centrally located, then this is your place!!  Initially, I was looking for a place to have a belated bday party al fresco.  From a website, this seemed to be a good place for it.  However, after calling to inquire about their outdoor seating, it would not work for my group as the area is far too small.However, the coordinator suggested a private room downstairs that would accommodate my 20 people. In the event of bad weather, too much noise (from my group), distractions on the street and space this worked out better.The room fit all of my guests perfectly.  When people arrived, they were directed downstairs where their coats were taken and they could begin enjoying their afternoon beverage.  After about 30 min of drinking and all of my guests arrived and settled down, we were seated for lunch.From everyone's reaction, the food was delicious.  The menu contained a lot options.  It was just your typical Irish fare which is one of the reasons why I chose this place along with location.The staff were amazing.  Location you cannot beat.  Food was delicious.  Most importantly, my company made it a day that will never be forgotten.  I would recommend this place for groups, for sure.  I will have to go back on a non special occasion to get what the restaurant is like upstairs (main floor)."
"The food in the Gage is a hit-or-miss. For this summer, the sesame beet in the lunch menu and the beet and cheese salad in the dinner menu are executed quite well. The former is quite refreshing, since the sesame salad balances out the creaminess of the beet and cheese tartar. The latter is the most beautiful beet salad I have ever seen. It is almost like a piece of artwork, but it is slightly too sweet. In terms of the winter menu, I enjoyed eating the hazelnut carrots, which were crunchy and sweet. The Gage is the only place I know thus far that provides hazelnut carrots in Chicago, besides Henri, which is its sister restaurant. However, most of the food in the Gage is too salty. According to my friends, the steak is over-marinated and the soup has been added too much salt. While I like the Brussels sprouts, I sometimes find it over-cooked.As a bar and a restaurant, the Gage is also extremely loud. Although it is a not a place for a date or a dinner with a close friend, it is a great place to have drinks with colleagues.Food: 3Decor: 3Service: 4"
Going to an Irish bar on St. Patricks day can either be wonderful or awful. This was a great experience. I was in the area for awhile and decided to attempt a solo dinner. From the hostess station I could see an upscale restaurant area and a bar area. Being by myself I asked after the bar. The hostess let me know the bar was open seating. She also gave me a wonderful tip: there is also a basement bar! I found a seat and ordered off the St. Patricks day menu. The food was excellent! I'm glad I braved it. I will be back! My only complaint is that the (wonderful) live traditional music made it very loud upstairs.
"Some of the food is great, for example best poutine I have had. I am not as thrilled about other options. But the location and service make it a good spot."
Loved this place. My wife and I came here based on its stellar reviews and weren't disappointed. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff is very friendly. Great selection of local and regional beers which I liked as I'm not from the area and like to try things I can't get in Virginia. Cocktails were also on point. For starters we had bone marrow and also the fries pickles. Both were delicious. If I ever came back I'd order the fried pickles every time and that's coming from a guy who doesn't like pickles. Coffee rubbed pork as my entree was solid. Nice and tender and the coffee made it super savory. It came with a prosciutto salad which was maybe a bit too salty for my liking but still pretty tasty and frankly k was pretty filled up on the fried pickles so maybe on a hungrier day I would have enjoyed it more. Actually came back the next afternoon for a quick drink after visiting the art institute. Great spot for a drink too. At least on Sunday afternoon it was pretty empty. Lots of space to relax and have a conversation. Wait staff was attentive and the cocktails continued to impress.
"Great Irish themed pub with some classy food. I ordered the Irish breakfast and was treated to black pudding, sausages, baked beans and eggs. My wife ordered a whiskey sour from the bar and they were on the ball enough to ask if she wanted it with or without egg whites. My only complaint was service was slow, consequently they don't receive the full 5 stars"
"My boyfriend and I had a Sunday evening dinner here before going to the Chicago Theater for a show.  We made our reservations on OpenTable and were seated immediately upon arrival.  It was a beautifuly day outside and we were offered an outdoor table if we were willing to wait for 15 minutes, but since we were on a timeline to get to the show we offered for immediate seating inside.  The atmosphere is trendy and comfortable and the place was crowded but not packed.We started with old fashioneds - my boyfriend got a standard old fashioned while I tried the house old fashioned with an apricot infused whiskey.  Both were different in taste and both were delicious.Our waiter was very helpful as we went through the menu and was very honest with his opinions - steering us away from some items based on our tastes and recommending others.  We started with the spicy chickpea fritters and then shared the seared sea scallops and caramelized lobster.  The chickpea fritters came with a great spicy and sweet sauce, but were a little more deep fried than I was expecting.  I've had various types of chickpea fritters in restaurants and these reminded me more of hushpuppies than the lightly fried fritters you can get in other places.  That said, it was still pretty tasty.The sea scallops were cooked to perfection, just seared enough but not overdone.  The dish comes with crispy chicken skin, which I don't eat, but it was a very separate piece of skin that did not blend with the rest of the dish and was easy to remove (if you only eat fish, like me).  My boyfriend tried the chicken skin and said it wasn't great, so I would recommend ordering without it.The caramelized lobster was perfection and delicious.  The quinoa was perfectly blended with the lemon rice and the pieces of lobster were mixed in.  The dish made my boyfriend a quinoa fan, and I'm happy that I can substitute it more when cooking knowing that he likes it just fine.We are not big eaters, so the one appetizer and two smaller plates were perfect to fill us up without feeling overstuffed.  If you have a bigger appetite, you may want to get a third plate, or venture into their entree sized items, but the beauty of their menu is that it offers something for every type of appetite.With all the amazing restaurants in Chicago, it's hard to say if we will make it back here, but it was definitely an enjoyable experience, a delicious meal, and the proximity to the Chicago theater makes it great for a pre-show dinner."
"I typically love gastropubs, but the food here didn't wow me.The french onion soup was pretty good.The salmon sandwich was decent, but I didn't even finish it.The fried egg appetizer made me realize I just don't really like hard boiled eggs.Next time I'm getting a sandwich, I'll head over to good ol' Jimmy Johns."
"We tried a wide variety of dishes while here.  5 or 6 appetizers, a couple entrees, etc.The good: Atmosphere is great.  The owner stopped to talk and was a personable, concerned businessman.  Huge positive for him.  The duck was awesome, and the tar tar was really good.  The scallops were odd in conception, but tasty.  I love Scotch Eggs, so that one is pretty hard to mess up.  Mussels Vindaloo were a nice change of pace.The bad: Our server was a little over the top, and basically arrogant.  He did his job, but it was too much show, not enough go.  I never got asked for another drink even though my glass was collected.  Poor showing.  Left 20% against my better judgement, but I hold faith for my fellow man.  I am counting on him not being the guy who makes his service career off of personality and gimmick and not off of skill and production.  Also bad, the fried pickles.  This is not an item that should even be on this menu, and they were basically no better than a frozen, pre-battered option.  We ordered thinking there MUST be something about these to warrant their existence, and the servers keen insight into the menu.  Bad decision making on our part.A few other items on menu just OK.  Not worth the keystrokes, frankly.The days of James Beard nominations are gone until they get someone in there that is inspired to create a dining experience worthy of such an award.  Right now, this is a nice looking gastropubby(?) type place with a good reputation and great opportunity to live up to it, which they are having trouble doing, in my opinion.Nice beer list.  Too bad I never got offered another.To respond to other posts: Yes, it was noisy.  When you enter a place with the bar by the front door, expect noisy.  We all had great conversation without yelling.  Non-issue."
"I went here on a date.  A great place for a date.  Although the tables are a little close together.  A very unique place that's great for foodies.  Had a custom, house-made sausages.  One duck sausage, and one pork sausage.  Don't give it a thought.  Go."
"Get the badness out of the way - too NOISY. We were fortunate to sit off to the side of the restaurant, but it was still annoying to have to yell at your tablemates, when they weren't really that far away. I know it's the cool thing to be in such a place, but to me, noise does not equal cool. SO the goodies - goat, bison appetizers, and a pretty good seared tuna. Peanut. Butter. Beignets. Yes, to die for. Perhaps just a bit more powdered sugary goodness, but the creamy gooey peanut butter was an excellent complement to the fried donut.The halibut looked pretty good. It's really easy to destroy fish. These dishes were just about perfectly done."
"We stopped into the Gage for drinks and appetizers over the weekend.  The bar and restaurant itself are very well done marked by a large bar with a fantastic beer and whiskey/scotch selection.  When the weather is a bit better the outside seating (and people watching) will be a nice option.The appetizers here were delicious - we tried the fried pickles (excellent - especially the dipping sauce), the lamb meatballs (very flavorful bordering on spicy) and the curry fries (mix the curry sauce with ketchup and enjoy!).  We tried a variety of beers from the beer list and thoroughly enjoyed them - we also can't wait to go back and work our way through the beer list even further!Also, big kudos to the manager who gave us our first round of drinks on the house since we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes for them after we ordered.  This was a great gesture that we all very much appreciated.  You've won our business in the future!"
Oh the poutine!
Great fish and chips - best British food I've had in the city
"By far one of my favorite spots in Chicago. I have only been for lunch but it's also busy, delicious and just a fun place. The service is great, food is perfect and they have an incredible beer and wine list."
"Solid 4 stars for The Gage.  Great location along Michigan and across from the park, there is a lot of chances for people watching if you sit outside.  Luckily there are some mid-range height bushes to give you some sense of privacy as you stuff your face with the deliciousness that is served to you.Our server was a bit quirky, she would lean in and really tell you about the food and dishes...  It got funny after a while, but at least she was pretty attentive and alert.  The other servers kept our waters refilled and crumbs swept off after every course!Tried the fish special of the day, which was pretty tasty.  Big fan of the bread fondue appetizer... I could probably just order the cheese as my drink next time.  We even stayed for dessert, even though we didn't have that much room.  I hit the Irish coffee pretty hard (paid the price later) and we tried the gelatto and cream cheese dessert.... YUM.Get ready to spend some money here, but if you would like a nice dinner/lunch... this is definitely the spot."
"I've been here about twenty times and every time my experience has been top notch. Great bar, great dining area. The place is always pretty packed, but I never feel overwhelmed while it's packed - so that's good. The food is ridiculous. I have tried a bunch of different menu items and they have all been fantastic. At this point I am convinced that anything I order there will be good. However, their best dish is their Mussel appetizer. It is cooked in this curry sauce which is incredible. - I highly recommend trying it out. Helpful tip - even if you are done with the mussels, keep the bowl with the sauce in it....if your entree comes with french fries, it tastes amazing to let your fries soak in the sauce. One thing I wish they did have though was a larger selection of beers on tap - but that is definitely not something I would dock off a star for. This place is awesome."
"So good!  The hotel I was staying out recommended The Gage, so I had to try it.  I definitely wasn't disappointed.The vibe was great, the place was busy and everyone was enGAGEd in conversation.We were lucky enough to get a table without a wait and began the experience...I started with a fantastic Belgian beer - Tripel Karmeliet, which came with its own specially designed logo glass (you can see my picture).  If you haven't had this beer, you need to try it.There were so many choices for lunch, and reading the descriptions made my mouth water.  We settled on Fish and Chips (served in an old school style newspaper cone - see my picture), and a monstrous burger.  Both were amazing.  I spend my time devouring the Fish and Chips and crispy fries.  The beer was a perfect pairing.If you are in Chicago, near Millennium Park, you have to try The Gage...Oh so good."
"Stopped in for a quick bite and bevy. Poutine was EXCELLENT. Music, Vibe, Drinks and Service (Jennifer) were also great. Definitely recommend."
"Dined here on Monday, one of those last nice days, Chicago is famous for, decided to eat outside for lunch....We had the Squash Soup and split the Lobster Roll Sandwich and Fries....YUM,  sun moved and became a lttle chilly, they lit the heaters and the afternoon was saved."
"My trip to The Gage started on a bit of a bad note- but recovered nicely enough to rate it at 4 stars. My boyfriend and I had reservations for 9 pm on a Friday night at the restaurant- we arrive about 15 minutes early and the restaruant was super crowded (a good sign in my opinion). However, we were not seated until 25 minutes after our reservation with pretty much no communication from the hostesses (definitely the worst part of the restaurant). However, when we got to our seats, the restaurant recovered nicely. We were brought two glasses of champagne and an apology from the manager for our wait, and the food was absolutely delicious. My favorite was the bison tartare, and my bf loved the Duck entree (I forget the entire name). I'd definitely come back... but maybe on a weekday!Final Note- It was VERY LOUD on the Friday when we were there... so if you are looking for a place to chat, this might not be the place!"
"Mediocre lunch experience.  The waiter gave wrong information about the food..twice.  We specifically asked if our lunch came with any side dishes, like fries, and were told it did not.  Because of this, we ordered the brussel sprouts.  Turns out, our lunch came with french fries.  Annoying. I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich.  Before ordering, I asked if the smoked salmon was lox or a piece of actual salmon grilled and smoked.  The waiter told me it was the latter.  Turns out, this was a lox sandwich.  Bummer.The food itself was ok.  The sandwich had a lot of mayo on it.  The brussel sprouts were not grilled enough.  Just lukewarm.Also, if you're going to have white table cloths, make sure they are clean.  Our looked like someone had wiped their ketchup hands on it recently.  Gross."
The best part about my personal experience was that I didn't have to pay because it was a company dinner. That sort of makes my input invalid in any truly substantive discussion because there's no cost-benefit weighing. (There's nothing quite like eating somewhere that's out of your price range because it's on someone else's dime.)I can say that the food was delicious and beautiful. I had raw beef and that just doesn't happen everywhere.
"So The Gage has been my moms go to restaurant when we meet my little sister downtown for dinner. I have been their a couple times and have yet to be disappointed with their dinner menu. On our last trip we actually went their for brunch which I was initially a little upset about because I was hoping for a nice steak or something meaty. Much to my surprise we had a great meal! We started off with muscles cooked in a coconut curry sauce which were awesome and the waiter brought us some extra bread for all the extra sauce. Then I tried a bowl of the chicken orzo soup which was light and delicious and loaded with chunks of chicken and veggies. I ordered the ""What Diet"" burger and not came topped with cheddar, smoked pork belly (basically bacon lol), a slaw made with iceberg lettuce and a spicy aioli. It was amazing! It came with fries which were fantastic as well. After all that we looked at he desert menu and I had to try the peanut butter French silk pie... It was probably the beat piece of pie I have ever had. I haven't had a bad experience at this place yet and I would recommend it to anyone."
"We went here before seeing ""The Book of Mormon.""  Hilariously enough, so did both tables on either side of us.  Anyway, the meal we had here was quite good.  I had the special, which was a red fish from the Gulf.  The price was a little high for the portion size, which is probably the greatest flaw of this restaurant.  It seems to occupy a realm where it'd be nice if the prices were a little lower or if the food was little more expertly prepared.  The beet salad we shared was good (I liked the use of golden beets) but not great, and at $12, it was priced about 20% too high.The draft selection is also a little bit small, but the choices are solid.  Same with the bottles offered, but again, the prices are a little off the mark.  A bottle of Left Hand Milk Stout should not be $9 anywhere, not even the loop.We split the chocolate ganache tart for dessert and that was a really fantastic finish to a good meal.  The ice cream balanced well with the almost too rich chocolate.Overall, we had a great time at The Gage and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a meal in the loop."
Best mohitos in town! I love their small appetizers:)
WOW. I went here because I purchased the 'A La Card Chicago' deck and the Gage is one of the participating restaurants (one of the only restaurants that participates in the Loop actually...go Gage!).It's ideally located after a day of touristy attractions in Millennium Park or the Art Institute. Everything we ordered was AmAzInG!I ordered the balsamic marinade sandwich -- I can honestly say this was one of the best sandwich I have ever had!!Side Note: I don't think the menu says this but the sandwich all come with a side of french fries. We didnt' know this so ordered a side of fries but thank goodness the waiter forgot about this since apparently the side order for fries is massive.
"I read  great many previous reviews of the Gage so was well prepared. Had no problem getting a table for one at 7:15 on a Friday though on arrival the place was packed on a Friday.  This is a very well run place. The service was quick, attentive, and sympathetic.  A supervisor kept an eagle eye and made sure all was well.  I had already made up my mind from YELP! reviews to order the mussels and the venison burger and they did not at all disappoint.  Pricey perhaps, but the quality warrants it. The whole meal, including. A Goose Island red IPA,came to $47 with tax, a bargain for sure by my Washington standards. I feel very well served, and impressed by the management behind all this."
"I visited The Gage on a referral.  The menu was appealing but the prices a bit high.  The scotch egg sounded good but at $8 for a single egg, I decided my hungry would be too expensive to quell at that rate.  I opted for the poutine (gravy and cheese curds on fries, oh my) and the fish and chips.  The poutine was tasty but I have to say the poutine that I saw the following night at Goose Island Brewery looked a lot better.  The fish and chips was decent but certainly not the best I've had (but then again, what is a New Englander like me doing ordering fish and chips in Chicago... can't argue with a craving, oh well).  Lastly, the wines initially seemed exorbitantly overpriced until it arrived, at which point it became clear I was receiving more than an ordinary glass of wine (what some would call a quartino, approximately 1.5-2 glasses of wine), phew.Overall, I enjoyed the place but it's not in my top tier."
"This was my third visit to the Gage, my most recent for Chicago Restaurant Week 2012. I was absolutely blown away by their 3-course Restaurant Week menu. Where many restaurants simply take the event for granted and some actually seem to increase their prices to take advantage of unsuspecting diners, The Gage has simply done the opposite. The $22 lunch menu was superb. I started with a celery root puree served with a light, bite sized biscuit, horseradish gougere, and garnished with pork confit. First off, the serving was surprisingly large. I expected a cup of soup, they served me a large bowl. Often restaurants will prepare this type of soup too densely and attempt to thicken the base with cream, not so here it was a beautifully light with a texture that reminded you of the fresh coarseness of celery. A superb start to our meal.I ordered the whitefish for my entree. The whitefish was pan fried with the skin left on and lightly seasoned with sea salt.  The fish was served with rye gnocchi, on a bed of whole leave spinach and topped with seaweed with smoked onion cream sauce and garnished with pousse-pied (sea green bean seaweed). I don't think anyone is capable of doing whitefish better, the fish was incredibly fresh and cooked perfectly; tender, but retaining the firmness of the filet. The gnocchi was homemade with a soft texture and added a welcome contrast to the dish. The pousse-pied on top was just a spectacular and creative touch that added a salty, crunchy dimension that, combined with the oils in the crispy fish skin, created a beautiful juxtaposition reminiscent of fine dining, not a urban gastropub. And did I mention this meal was only $22?We finished the meal off with panettone crips with anise caramel sauce and what tasted like cream cheese ice cream. The dessert was simply delicous the panettone crips were displayed a nutty and moderately dense texture and were complimented well with the more caramel than anise sauce. The ice cream was dense with a smooth, richness that lingered after each panettone bite. For lack of a better term, this dessert was like eating cake and ice cream on steroids!On top of that the service was flawless, and we were in and out in a perfect amount of time for a work lunch. Overall, I thought there wasn't a single thing that they could have done better. A fabulous lunch, that combined quality ingredients with creative details that exemplify what a good gastropub should strive to be. I'm sold and can't wait for my next visit to The Gage!"
This place is amazing. Try the Venison Burger. It is life changing.
"We had lunch (fish and chips, turkey sandwich) on the patio out front and it was good food, well-presented and excellent service, even if a little pricey. There was no cool Pinot Grigio on hand so the owner himself came to offer something similar - nice public relations! We went back another night for a glass of champagne inside with the after- work crowd and it was a fun atmosphere. I would definitely go back for a drink at least and probably lunch. Great location across from Millenium Park and the Art institute."
"I went here with some colleagues while at a conference in Chicago. We were seated, but at a roundtable that was up against a door that kind of blocked you in. I took this seat, and it was a good thing I didn't have to use the restroom because I would have had to move two people at my table to get out. It was crowded so this is maybe an issue of space, but it was still uncomfortable. Our waiter seemed a bit rushed, but overall was very helpful. I am gluten free and he was knowledgable about the menu and able to tell me what was suitable for me. I shared the escargot appetizer with a friend, and it was very good but very different. It was in a carrot puree which was fantastic. I would definitely recommend it. For my appetizer I had the smoked duck. It was fantastic! Excellent smoked flavor and so tender. I would highly recommend it. I ordered a side of brussels sprouts which my server forgot to give me, however, another woman at my table ordered them so I was able to try them. They were incredibly underwhelming, and I was glad my order didn't go through. They were mushy and had very little flavor (I do like crisp brussels sprouts just as a caveat), the lack of flavor was pretty killer. Overall I had good food and the atmosphere was great. I would definitely come back again (and probably order the duck)!"
"The broad variety of food served here is amazing.  I love their beet salad and ""chips"" fries.  But they also offer boar, scotch eggs. buffalo and the like.  Carnivorous friends tell me the meats are all good.  Location is convenient, close to the Art Institute and Chicago Symphony."
Service is impeccable! Server knew every aspect of menu. Red snapper is extraordinarily prepared.
"Decent. Location is convenient for millennium park and museum goers. However, no duck poutine when I went this summer - the main reason for coming here, and reason for 3 stars. The venison burger though was solid. Scallops were perfectly cooked."
"Another trip to Chicago, another trip to The Gage. Food was wonderful, as always, but the indifferent service was disappointing. We had a lot of trouble catching our server's eye and ordering more drinks. He also wasn't terribly helpful with suggestions--a shrug and ""well, what do you like?"" He was helpful regarding my allergies and the cucumber salada was divine; the hanger steak over grilled romaine was also wonderful but more medium-rare than medium. Our group of five was at a round table to it was easier to talk than my last review (5/17/12) but it is still awfully loud. Disappointed that the duck fat nuts are gone from the menu and please get rid of the God-awful lotion in the bathroom. The smell is so strong that I couldn't smell my food over it. I won't make that mistake again."
Fooled by yelp again. Food is good but not 5 star. Got unattended for entire lunch and almost no service at all.
"I will start by saying, I highly recommend this place and I hold this place in high regard.  Visiting Chicago from New York for my birthday, I really wanted to have a great meal.  Reservations were easy to make and with such high remarks on Yelp, I decided to give this place a shot, and I definitely do not regret it!!!  We were running late for our 7:45 reservations and made a quick call to them, the hostess was so nice to hold our reservation without any problem.  Upon arriving, service was extremely attentive, but I will get into the amazing service in a little bit.  My friend and I decided to ordered a bottle of wine with our shared courses. We ordered the ""Domaine Guiberteau Chenin Blanc Saunur"", a French wine with hints of peach and cider.  If you are eating here, please order this wine, it was utterly amazing.  For our shared course, we ordered mussels, the gem salad, and the coffee infused pork.  I can't say that every dish was a home run but there was something delicious and unforgettable in each dish.  The sauce and cleanliness of the mussels, the refreshing capers in the cold salad, and the buttery grits in the main course was delicious and unforgettable.  Every bite was unique, delicious, and rich in flavor.  What made the dishes so amazing was the wine.  The matre d complimented on out selection of wine and it was because with each dish, the wine was accented and tasted different and refreshing, expanding or palette of food.  For dessert we ordered the apple rhubarb and lychee sorbet, has to be the best sorbet I ever tasted.  Flavorful and refreshing.  Perhaps it was the wine and being slightly intoxicating, but the meal was so enjoyable.  And perhaps it was my birthday and I didn't have to pay either, why thank you, but I will definitely come back here when I visit Chicago again.  Now for the service, I can't say how amazing this was.  After telling our waiter, we were sharing our dishes, he said fantastic and seemed excited.  When the salad came, we receive two plates of salad. I thought it was a mistake.  When the pork came, we receive two plates of pork.  It dawned on me, they gave each one of us our own portion of food instead of having a plate in the middle and letting us chow our food like a puppy chow commercial, we had our own dish and no one knew better.  Perhaps they do this in much more high caliber restaurants, but that was a first for us, and I can not say thank you enough for being so classy.  When the check arrived, we gave a generous tip without hesitation.  One of the finer meals I had.  Thank you wine, good food, great service, and amazing company.  I won't forget that experience."
"At nearly 950 reviews, I'm sure that anything I add will probably have been covered somewhere else.That said, I do want to touch on a couple of things from last night's dinner:The noise level, while high, somehow is not overpowering. I was able to have a conversation with my lovely wife without having to strain to hear or be heard.The food was superb - the poutine, my venison burger, my wife's caramelized lobster, the pumpkin mousse dessert - all were cooked to a T, and delicious!The waitstaff is very, very nice - our waiter even offered to substitute a Caesar salad for the fries that came with my burger, since we were already having the poutine.My only gripe is that the bussers / dining room  staff are ever-present to the point of hovering - it's just TOO much: no sooner did I take 2 sips of water than my glass was  being topped off. While I appreciate attentive service, this was overkill.That small beef (and it IS a small one) aside, I recommend The Gage oh so very highly."
Absolutely wonderful serviceI came in right before closing on a Sunday night after a 13 hour shift and my server Megan could not have been sweeter. The bartender Thomas personally came up to me to talk to me about alternatives to sulfite based drinks (i have an allergy). Food was phenomenal.
"Despite it being super crowded and the noise level made it hard to think, this place was worth the stop.  The elk and seasonal veggies were excellent all washed down with a goose island red IPA.  Yum."
"The service seemed to be a bit slow throughout our stay - though maybe I rush too much. The seasonal fruit platter was well-sized and well-priced, though none of the fruit served was in-season - still tasted goo though with a yogurt/granola addition. Bloody Mary's were good. My partner's food was served piping hot and delicious, my egg's benedict were cold and the hollandaise sauce had formed that ""skin"" when sauces cool. The taste was good, but would've been better served hot."
"The location is both a blessing and a curse.  It's a gastropub in the Loop which is very convenient to slaves like myself who work and sometimes play in the Loop.  It's a curse because it's crowded most of the time and the food is a bit overpriced by 15% to 20%.I've been here many times and the food is really solid.  Don't think I've ever eaten anything that wasn't good from the burger to the fish & chips to the poutine.  It deserves special credit for dishes like poutine and game before anybody in town figured out that Montreal cuisine was not represented in Chicago.  It's good but not exceptional.One gripe is the menu doesn't change much so if you've been here more than a few times, boredom sets in.  For worse, the Gage seems set in its ways.  If they're doing great business, I can see why they don't want to change.  My other gripe is the service.  How can any restaurant worth its salt serve the main course without first serving the drink ordered???  Yes, I ordered tea but is it my fault that you don't carry enough teapots???  Inexcusable, really.  And inexplicably, had to probe the waitress as to what the issue was with the tea.  So, if I'm in the area and it's not too busy, I'll drop in.  Otherwise, I'm not in a hurry to go back."
Solid 4 stars.Service can improve although it wasn't bad at all. I had the beet salad which was good but the blue cheese was super mild and the beets were kind of plain.The side of mushrooms was pretty good.The highlight was in the desert. A chocolate tart with malt ice cream and crumbles. Delish.Downstairs there's a bar that looks super cool.Cheers
"I have been here for both business lunches and pre-Bears game and have walked out of the place each time thinking that The Gage really has it figured out in terms of delivering gourmet food in a bar environment.  Last time I went was pre-Bears/Packers game in 12/29/2013 (:-(....) and had the shrimp and grits breakfast option with the egg on top.  . . . Six stars.  Also had a couple bloodies with the stella chaser - at their recommendation.  Thank you! My only beef is that the beer and wine are a little on the pricey side, but really not too bad."
Decent food. Good atmosphere. It's a great place to drop in for food and drink right next to millennium park.
"Awesome Venison Burger.Awesome Waitstaff.CRISPY fries.We were visiting from out of town and happened upon this place after an event, and were seated at a table in the back right away.  We were not expecting such great food from a place that, upon first impression, was 'just an average bar.'  Others enjoyed the fish and chips and salads.  The venison was not over cooked which was great, but the toppings and the special ketchup are what really made the sandwich awesome."
"Quite a nice experience!  I'm looking forward to coming back and upping that 4 to a 5 (it's just hard to know if a place is a 5 star after a single experience unless it's like zomg this is the most amazing furniture store ever compared to all other furniture stores).  We came here on a Wednesday night for an early dinner before the 7:30 Book of Mormon show; it's super convenient for that.I like the atmosphere: the tables are intimate in a dark setting, though oddly close to each other- probably you get about as much space along the walls as you would if you were sitting at a communal table with your neighbors.  In that we were chatting and very easily started talking to the man next to us without changing the volume of our voices at all.  The standalone tables look a little less squished.  It's sort of a weird mix of fine dining (the waiters use those awesome crumb things on your white tablecloths) and relaxed gastropub (people were all crammed in the front sipping cocktails and snacking when we left), but it works.  Feels like Chicago, despite being in the Loop.Beer list is carefully designed, which I appreciated a lot, and is divided into categories like 'in your backyard' and 'monks' or something like that.  We had some lovely beers- Unibrou Ephemere with apples and a Saison Dupont- recommended by our knowledgeable server Jason.  The cocktails looked charming as well, but we stuck to beer and wine.  The wines by the glass is a shorter list, and we had some red that Jason suggested, which was fine.  Drinkable, tasted like a house wine.Now the preliminaries are over, let's get down to business: FOOD:starters:-ANTELOPE TARTARE: this dish blew my mind and I highly highly recommend it.  Comes with some nice toast/crostini and a perfect little raw quail egg quivering atop a mass of seasoned raw meat and some stuff on the plate.  My favorite preparation of antelope I've had: it really highlighted the deep game flavor of the meat without being too heavy, and there was lots of mustard and fun sauces to liven it up.  My fav dish of the night.-Tuna tartare: well done, but not as imaginative as the other dishes.  Comes with a little rice cracker, some good wasabi/horseradish/mustard sauce, and seaweed salad and crunchy rice that adds some texture variety.  The taste profile is what you're used to though, so I probably won't order it again.-SEA SCALLOPS: boy's favorite dish of the night.  Incredibly imaginative.  Big, meaty scallops seared in whatever, topped with a delicate kimchi and served with korean-style 'shortrib' meat and some spinach.  Loved the big hearty flavors of the meat with the delicate creaminess of scallop and spicy bright touches of kimchi.  Great dish.-Vinegar beets: boy liked this more than I did.  Came with this awesome goat cheese or creme fraiche mousse, the nice beets, and frisee and onions.  Wish it had a few more orange slices.  Like the tuna, a taste profile you've had before and not a surprise, but it is well done.-nightly special: Snapper served on a crab cake with a New Zealand mussel.  This is a nicely seasoned slab of snapper on top of a good crab cake and some lentil puree, with a citrus-y confit on the side.  It's a good dish and a good choice.  Confession time: I consider myself a bit of a foodie (despite my love of fruit snacks and fried chicken), but I've never understood mussels.  Apparently this single giant mussel is the king of mussels and is only available seasonally.  Tastes like a mussel to me.  Meh.  When we're dropping $50+ per person on a meal (this was more than that, more like 80), I like to have an adventure and experience out of it.  Gage seems to have several dishes that offer adventure, as well as more comforting dishes that are well executed but aren't as inventive."
"If you're in the area you must stop in for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or dinner.  I had Eggs Benedict that nearly made me weep over their velvety perfection.  A just right spicy generously apportioned Bloody Mary put my Sunday brunch over the top.  My friend had Buckwheat Pancakes with a berry topping that were to die for.   Service with a smile made everything just right."
"Antelope and sea scallops ftw!This place is a solid 4. They do some things remarkably well and with a very unique twist. We loved the antelope tartar and the sea scallaps with kimchi and short ribs. They were just divine. The tuna tartar and the vinegar beets with cheese mousse were very good, but not exceptional. I take some issue with the price given the mixed food results. As a fairly expensive place, I can't pop this up to a 5 unless everything is superb; 4 seems a compromise as I'd definitely go here again and would try other things on the menu. I feel confident I'd leave happy with any subsequent visits. We went here en route to the theater, and that worked out superbly. The service was excellent and timely, especially given our time constraints. The beer list is interesting and full of fun, and there were many available wines, though we didn't do much work there.This place is worth going to, and it's a nice option in the loop given the relative dearth of options."
"Went here specifically for Moscow Mules (based on glowing Yelp reviews) in a frosted copper mug only to find out they were out of copper mugs at 7pm on New Years Day. Okay, okay, I'll have my mule in a glass I guess. I'd rate their mule as average. Crushed ice. It had a lime tang flavor. I didn't order a second drink. We stayed for dinner and ordered the scotch egg (boiled egg wrapped in pork, breaded, and fried), scallops, butternut squash soup, monk fish, brussel sprouts, and didn't have any room left for the peanut butter beignets. My hat is off to the chef. The food was impressive. My hat is also off to the folks who designed this place. I love the black and white tile floor near the bar, the lanterns hanging over the bar, the tin ceiling, the green subway tile on the pillars. A masculine touch, for sure. Well done sir or madam."
Always a consistently good choice in this area.We stopped by the other night after an event at the Harris theater.  We were seated immediately and our server was quick to bring us our drinks.I had the Fish and Chips and my friend had the burger.  Both were excellent . . .and when more friends came to join us- we moved our larger group to the main bar area and everyone accommodated us by moving our food and drinks.Service is always spot on and I just love the ambiance of the place.  Know that if you want valet parking- you have to go around the corner to the University Club on Monroe.  Or just park under Millennium Park and come up from the underground garage right in front of the place.The Gage gets my business again and again!
"The Gage is a unique spot in Chicago.  When you walk in, look around and receive flawless service you expect this place to be extremely pricey, but it is NOT!I went to lunch and it was quite busy so I highly suggest making reservations.  The service was great. I never waited on anything and the server didn't even think twice when explaining the menu or the specials. The table shared the mussels, which were huge.  I suggest ordering the mussels if you are in a big group because they are not lying when they say 1 Pound.  The Scotch Egg is the highlight.  It is a unique dish I've never had before but I will come back just to try it!  It's hard to explain the Scotch Egg so just try it! The Roasted Turkey Sandwich came on a delicious pumpernickel baguette that made me want to order a second.  The brie and potatoes were also great. Think a classy version of cheese fries.   This place is trendy, roomy, and loud.  I suggest going with a large group of people, not for a quiet date night.  I am going to be a happy returning customer!"
"This place has a lot of small plates that you share with friends. They were tasty. I was a little tipsy, so I don't remember everything my boss and I had. But there was red meat involved, japanese peppers, some kind of seafood, too.I did remember having the lamb as my main plate, and it was so tender it just fell off the bone and melted in my mouth. You can't go wrong with that."
"The Gage has a very dark setting. To our surprise, it was very easy to get a table for two on a Saturday night. We were on weekend in Chicago and scoured Yelp for good eats--I guess the real wait is for brunch? Anyhow, we ordered a bottle of Riesling and settled in with the menu. A has a penchant for scotch eggs, so we got that. Compared with the one we'd had before, where the egg was runny, this one's yolk was solid. Mussels Vindaloo, Toast 16 - good! very interesting with a flavored broth--we'd been on a mussels binge around that time, so lots of garlicky, milder broths, but this one was spiced!Gage N-17 ""Fondue"" Butter Kaase, Brie, Spinach, Toast 11- not too memorable..I think i prefer my cheese in chunks so i can spread or slice as I pleaseBison Tartare Apple, Pear, L'Amuse Gouda, Egg, Giardiniera Emulsion 16 - Pretty good--on the smaller side, but most tartares come that way..Beet Salad Goat Cheese, Honey Comb 12- this was yummy and pretty, too! All different colored/spiraled(heirloom) beets and cheese and chunks of honey comb--yum!Great date spot, be ready to pay up."
"Unfortunately, I forgot my hipster shades this evening. We were staying at the Palmer House for a few days and I had read the Yelp raves about 'The Gage' over and over. The menu wasn't tremendously appealing to me, but I saw a few things that caught my eye. Looking for a late-night meal with very few options available, we decided to give it a try. A slight annoyance...I checked their hours online and found a heap of conflicting information. One closing time from Yelp, another from Google, another from their own website. I would generally trust the hours on the restaurant's own website, but the current time was right at their listed closing time. In hopes that perhaps one of the other sources were accurate, I called and found out that none of the sites listing a closing time were correct. Thankfully, that meant we were still able to hop a couple of blocks over for a meal.I worried that we were slightly underdressed (jeans, untucked button-up shirt), but quickly found out that the full spectrum of clientele was being served. Some were in suits and sports coats, others in mangled t-shirts and skinny jeans. We were seated in the main dining area where we might as well have joined another party. The tables were so close together that you could hardly squeeze into the booth side without getting pretty fresh with the folks beside you. The ambience was that of a typical dark, loud, upscale bar in the city. The folks beside us were talking about their Am-Ex Black cards...how exciting! *rolls eyes*From the draft beer menu, I ordered a Blue Moon to drink, but was disappointed a few minutes later when the waitress came back and said they didn't have it. No biggie, I wasn't really feeling like trying something new, so I decided to stick to water. I ordered the Fish and Chips and hubs, who was only in the mood for dessert, ordered the chocolate mousse. The waitress was decent but had a difficult personality to read. It sometimes came across as pretentious, sometimes personable, mostly awkward and sometimes bothered. I'll take the blame and chalk it up to me not feeling super comfortable in with the rich, hipster crowd.My fish and chips came rather quickly (about 10 minutes) in a cute presentation with the fish wrapped in a newspaper cone. The fries were quite good, but the fish wasn't anything spectacular. The fish was moist and flaky and the batter was crispy, but had little flavor. Oddly enough, the cold dessert that hubs ordered at the same time as my entree took considerably longer to come out than my hot entree...they volunteered that the fish and dessert were prepared at different stations (I'd hope so) when they brought the fish out. When it did come out, the chocolate mousse looked great and was served in a mason jar with cookie crumbs layered throughout. Unfortunately, the mousse was very flat and had the consistency of a dense pudding rather than a light and airy mousse. The flavor was that of a brownie batter....you know, when you lick the mixer blades. The ratio of cookie crumbs to mousse was unbalanced, resulting in a very dry dessert.Thankfully, the tables around us started to clear out and we could enjoy a normal conversation. The waitress was very kind to not charge the Am-Ex Black folks beside us for their desserts, making sure they were aware of it before they left their tip. While certainly none of our business, it's hard to ignore in such close proximity...I'm sure they appreciated the favor. When our check came, they tried to charge me for my beer that they did not have. I mentioned it when she took my card and it was removed from the check (no biggie). We quickly shuffled out and made our way back to the hotel. We love the Palmer House and will always stay there, however we will most likely not be returning to The Gage during our future visits."
"Great atmosphere and service! I came here late on a Friday night and was seated right away. Their wine selection is amazing (though they were out of the vino I wanted to try), and their menu is innovative...a perfect mixture of new ideas and comfort food. I had a crunchy, fresh caesar salad that was delicious. I would definitely come here again. I felt very well taken care of by our waitress."
"Fabulous food as usual. Try the duck, if you're a duck fan. Hell, try the duck even if you aren't a duck fan, and you might be by the end of your meal.My only minor complaint was I thought that we waited a while before the waiter showed up, but they were clearly busy."
"Awesome burgers, starter soup was ok. Great service. Dessert was amazing."
"Friday night, packed house , the svc was excellent and all the food was very tasty. Loved the text message when my table was ready.."
"Pastrami Pork Belly Eggs Benedict. Amazing! The rest of the experience was about what you'd expect from a gastropub in this area, and not cheap, but that's OK. I thought the bloody mary needed work, even though the bartender kept raving about how good their bloody's are.  I just found them to be a little flat, no real spice or flavor to kick up the tomato.  They do have a great and interesting beer selection on tap and it wasn't a problem getting a seat at the bar for Brunch at 11 on a Sunday. I'd go back in a second for that Benedict."
"A bagpipest playing traditional Irish music, tacky shimmery beads (that probably indicate things happened that didn't as I am wearing them in honor of St. Paddy's day), and a French infused set of chilaquiles later, I'm happy.Of course, one of the wait staff was digging for gold, but I figure that's in honor of the whole leprechauns and pot of gold thing? Hey, I didn't see him touch any food or plates or people, so it's all good I spose. Like I say, as long as nobody's eating them. Anyhow, the chilaquiles came with creme fraiche (which is crema in Spanish), mildly crunchy chips (the ones at the bottom were soggy unfortunately), queso fresco (mmm mmm like goat cheese in Spanish!) and some chili peppers (the sweet kind).My friend had the corned beef hash because she's an Asian leprechaun! Anyhow, she cleaned her plate and was even licking the last remnants from the ceramic orb.Overall, nice low key contemporary establishment close to the Art Institute, Millenium Park, and all of the wonder of the Loop."
"My friend and I had originally wanted to try Frontera Fresca for dinner one night but ended up at The Gage instead. Seated immediately in the beautiful but modest dining room, I knew we were in for a treat. Our server--recently over form Ireland, suggested I have their seasonal New Holland Mad Hatter India Pale Ale. He even brought over a tasting (which was a good 4-5 ounces) for me to try to be sure I would like it. And oh--I SURE did! That definitely boosted his credibility in my book :)As for food, my buddy and I split the Gage N-17 Fondue---which was more like a cheese dip with extra long crostinis than your traditional fondue-pot experience. Yummy, nonetheless. I had The Gage USDA Prime Burger with Camembert, Onion Marmalade, and the regular fixins'. YUMMY! Super juicy, well flavored, and cooked perfectly. Quality meat does make a difference folks. :)  My pal ordered the Fish and Chips--which every other person in the restaurant seemed to be ordering as well. REALLY yummy--crispy, great batter, and not the least bit oily.Overall, a really pleasant experience. I wouldn't mind coming back on St.Paddy's Day if I was in town. I'm sure it would be an authentic experience but not as chaotic as my usual St. Paddy's Day haunts :)And as their menu boastes ""Refined Rusticity"" is right on the money. :)"
"For a spot in the loop, it's surprisingly good.  They have an above average drink selection and the food is above average as well.  It's conveniently located on Mich Ave, and is a great starting point for a night out, especially if you are entertaining guests from out of town etc.  Get the Mussels, a scotch, a bourbon, a beer and enjoy.  They have a great private event space downstairs if you're into that.  Cheers!"
"The Gage was an impromptu choice for celebrating our friends' wedding anniversary, and its proximity to the Art Institute made it an ideal spot. We made last-minute reservations, and our party of four was seated toward the front of the restaurant, adjacent to the bar area. The food was quite good. From the colorful and delectably dressed beet salad, to the fish and chips, the house crafted sausages, roasted farm chicken, and burger, all were well-prepared and delicious. The service here was a standout: prompt and efficient, without being rushed. And our server, Katie, was most knowledgeable in helping one of our party who is gluten intolerant to navigate the menu choices.So why only three stars? Noise. The sound level where we were seated was truly deafening, and destroyed any hope of civilized conversation. And civilized conversation should be one of the joys of dining out, and we had plenty to talk about after the visit to the Art Institute. But we couldn't hear each other speak without first raising our own voices to a near yell. Toward the end of our evening, when I made my way back and down to the restroom, I discovered that the tables toward the back seemed to enjoy a slightly more comfortable noise level. If I return, I'll be sure to ask to be seated toward the back.I recommend The Gage for the food and the service, but if you are seeking a nice chat over your dinner, find another restaurant."
"I headed here as part of a friend's alumni event for their college. We were in the rented out space on the lower level. We had a great time.We were drawn there by the alumni association's whiskey tasting. They set up 4 stations around the room and the bartenders were very knowledgeable about the drinks they poured. During the tasting, appetizers were served. The food was really tasty. I think there were fish and chips, a mushroom souffle, some sort of goat cheese puff, and mini sliders. Our tasting fee paid for the tasting, the food, and a drink ticket. I used my ticket on a classic rum and diet. My friend got a whiskey and diet. Both were generously poured by a friendly bartender.The atmosphere itself is nice. The place was pretty busy, but I never felt too crowded. Overall, a great place to catch up with friends."
If I only eat Scotch eggs for the rest of my life I would be a happy man. Try their poutine also. Delicious. For a treat try their home made bangers and potatoes. So good!
"After walking by this place several time I was finally able to make it in. The place is quite cozy and gets very busy. The atmosphere is still upscale, but still casual. One thing I did like is that the noise level is not terribly loud like other places I have been. Sorry but screaming over people just isn't my idea of a great night....so yay Gage!What did this gal order? Manhattans and desserts! They have a great selections of bourbons, whiskeys, and scotches. The food looked wonderful, but being late as it was and well the idea of desserts and drinks hit the nail on the head. The beignets with ginger ice cream was amazing! It was hot, sweet, but not too sweet. The ginger ice cream was delish and had a great texture. There was a hint of something else in the ice cream, but couldn't put my finger on it. The Manhattans were stellar! The waitress did accidentally bring me a Woodford and Coke, but I am assuming probably because she didn't think a small lady could down two or three Manhattans with no issue. Overall verdict, will come back again! Next time I will try the poutine and the whiskey flights."
"Escargot.Get it. One of the most delicious dishes I've had in a while. The atmosphere is really nice and the staff is friendly as well. Try to not sit in the back by the kitchen because it gets REALLY hot. I also dined on the curried lobster which was good... but nothing compared to the escargot. The chef special salmon was delicious as was the soup of the day (can't remember what it was).The place is pricey, but overall I'd say it's worth it. Nice night for a fancy girls night or a date. DON'T BRING YOUR KIDS! It is inconsiderate to others that are paying 50 bucks for a bottle of wine."
"Great food, great location, great drinks. Grilled cauliflower with burnt lemon, herb salad and pumpkin seeds is a must.  The veal carpaccio with gouda, heart of palm and smoked truffle aioli was also very tasty .  I would definitely go back and try their venison burger too."
"I came to here on my trip to Chicago based on the Yelp reviews. I really enjoyed the food here. My wife and I split the Pate board, Duck, and Scallops.  While the pate was good but not.great, the scallops and duck were amazing. For desert we had the donuts and creme brûlée. I loved the doughnuts but my wife liked the creme brûlée better. We did appreciate that they comped one of the deserts for my birthday."
"Showed up at The Gage after confirming that the fb game we wanted to watch was on....only to find out once we got that there, that they didn't carry it. After searching for parking, paying for parking and then walking 3 blocks  we were more than disappointed.  What started out bad ended very positive. The hostesses were extremely apologetic and the manager Pat was also very gracious. He asked us to wait while he found other places nearby that were carrying the game. He came back to us with some options (of course, none were as good as The Gage, lol). He also reimbursed us for parking. He obviously went well above and beyond what he could have done or what would have been ""acceptable"" customer service.  This was not our first time at The Gage, but we were not ""regulars"" either.  We had always had a great time and great meals there and we will for sure go back."
"This was probably my best high end meal while visiting Chicago on business.  I liked it better overall than The Girl and the Goat, and Fontina Grill.  The venison burger was the best burger I ever had.  I also got some Belgium beer that was excellent.  The fries were great too.  What set it apart from those other high end places was that the price was not super ridiculous for the taste and portions."
"My mom and I came here when visiting Chicago to see a show. We didn't make a reservation but they were able to squeeze us in between others. We both ordered the Riesling and it was wonderful! They are served in 8 oz carafes so you could split if you wanted but I wouldn't recommend it. You'll want it all for yourself! I ordered the fish and chips and it was the best I ever had. My mom ordered the beet salad and was raving about it. The burgers looked delicious though we didn't try them. Overall, it was delicious and a great experience. I would definitely come back."
"The venison burger, like Devin Hester, is ridiculous. Order it rare, unlike Devin's kick returns for touchdowns this year (we hope). Wash down with an Atom Smasher."
"Great Friday night at the Gage!!  I had been here before for lunch and for drinks but it had been quite a while.  A girlfriend and I planned to meet for drinks and ended up staying for over two hours and having a really good meal. It was really crowded when we got there sans reservation hoping to snag a spot in the bar. I was immediately worried that we'd have to wonder for a new drink destination.  After about 10 minutes hovering around the bar area, a server approached us and offered to bring us drinks.  She also said that she had reserved us a table where she had just dropped a check.  As if we weren't already impressed, she gave us periodic updates as the people paid and were getting ready to leave. We settled into our much sought after table and spent the next 30-45 min just catching up.  Our server was so patient with us.  We didn't feel rushed to make decisions but our glasses were never empty.  We ordered some light bites: chickpea fritters, rabbit salad with arugula and curried lobster with quinoa.  Everything was great, especially the lobster.  For dessert, we shared a heavenly chocolate pudding/mousse with caramel and cinnamon ice cream.  Total bill with two glasses of pinot noir and two beers: $98.  Not bad."
"Stopped in here before a CSO performance for drinks. Loved:1. The decor (old classy chicago)2. The bartender (not sure how to spell, pronounced ""shy"") he was a really really great bartender. 3. The menu - we didn't eat, but they have Duck. And any place that has duck is awesome.4. The basement. Downstairs is where the bathrooms reside, and there's a really cool looking banquet room down there too. Didn't like:1. The sinks in the bathroom. Sounds petty - but I felt like I was in my old Catholic grade school. 2. The layout. They can't help it. It's in a really old building. They made good use of the space but it seemed a little cramped to me.3. I guess these could all be combined. I didn't like having to walk downstairs to use the bathroom.Will re-update with a proper review when I eat there. But as far as stopping in for a few drinks on the weekend -- was a great place to go."
"Dissapointong menu, no personalized service. Stick to fish and chips and a guiness or harp. --server is barely civil for some reason. He keeps stumbling over his specials delivery speech. (I've heard it four times; I and three tables next to me were all sat at the same time.)--bread not made in house. Unable to determine ingredients (check for corn to which I'm allergic)--lively bar keeps the excitement going... It is an ""Irish"" pub after all !Restaurant week 2010 dinner prix fix. Starter: lentil soup with lobster and creme fresh. --lobster overdone and rubber--presentation a total flop; runner poured a lumpy gunk over the two pieces of lobster and the result is a disaster--plate was cold so the soup is now barely lukewarm--creme fresh is probably in there somewhereWhat a waste.Second try: organic lettuces. Boo! --roasted hazlenuts bland (and old?)--lettuces had no spark, not fresh--dressing just weak and slimy--gorgonzola was the only interesting thing. Too bad I couldn't just have some lavosh.   Main:whitefish--greasy, flaky and bland--atop overfired greens and some sort of beef slosh. Was it kale? Ugh. Dessert: apple pastry with spooned ice cream--again with the room temp plate, this felt like something from a cafeteria buffet. This place is huge. There seems to be no end of nook and cranny spots where there are 5 more tables placed.Service reflects the quantity. Buser goes right down the line filling water glasses in a cadence.And they're packing em in, too. Am I missing something?"
"My husband & I took my mom & dad here as a thank you for helping with our wedding. Man, oh man. Everything we ordered was amazing- drinks, apps, dinner, deserts & after dinner drinks. We pretty much licked everything clean. It is a little expensive, but totally worth it. The atmosphere is so rad. It is super dark with candles everywhere, while still seeming dive like (in the best possible way). This is a stop for us every time we are visiting from Texas. I can not recommend this place enough."
This place is great for work or social lunches but the dinner here is great as well.Nice bar that's upscale while being casual and has a wide range of customers. Burgers are really good and the fish and chips are highly recommended.
"Took my wife to the Gage for a nice dinner.  We had reservations made over a week in advance, but got seated at at table that was so close to the tables next to it the hostess had to physically move the table to let me get into the booth.  So we have neighbors so close to us that we could easily listen to their conversation.  Not what I wanted given the price point for this restaurant.The restaurant is clean and nice looking.The Scotch Egg was amazing.  The Fish and Chips were a 3.75 star.  Nothing was super different about the fish.  The french fries were 5 star.  The brussel sprouts were a 4 star.  The bread was also really good.This brings us to the chicken, which the waiter told us was awesome.  IT WAS TERRIBLE.  We took two bites of it and left it.  Thank God for the fish and chips being large size, because we would have not been full when we left otherwise.  The chicken is why this place gets a two star.  It was the most expensive item we purchased and HORRIFIC.Finally, we were going to get dessert.  They brought out the menu and three of the four desserts had nuts in them.  Honestly, there are a lot of people with nut allergies, so you would think that they would have more non-nut options.  The loan dessert without nuts was some sort of plain cake and ice cream.  Huge disappointment.Honestly, at this price-point, you are better off going to other establishments (like MK) for dinner.  Maybe for lunch this is a good spot.I had such high expectations of this place.  But we left definitely let down."
"Very cool Gastropub on Michigan. Beautiful long bar at the entrance with many top shelf whiskeys and scotch to choose from. On draft they also have about a dozen craft brews. This place is your ideal happy hour/after work pub when your thirst calls for something other than your run-of-the-mill domestic beer.Ordered the venison burger cooked medium. Perfectly done - just the slightest bit of pink and warm all the way through. Topped with a generous portion of sautéed mushrooms, red onion, and either spicy bell pepper or a very mild jalapeño, I couldn't tell. The spicy was balanced out with a slightly sweet dressing/sauce -- all on a brioche bun. One of the most tender, tasty burgers I've ever had! The next time I am in Chicago, I will come out of my way to eat here. The service was very attentive and friendly but they also left you alone. The only reason I have it 4 stars instead of 5 was the 30-minute wait for my burger. Although well worth the wait, I felt it was on the long side for a burger to be prepared.Give this place a try, especially if you're in the mood for a tasty beer and burger!"
A crowded restaurant with a bad experience. The food and drinks here were decent but if you're a vegetarian or vegan this place is not very accommodating at all. The waiter I had turned my asking for vegetarian options into a joke and openly mocked it throughout the whole night. It started off as a little joke and turned awkward and rude. Would not come here again or recommend it to anyone.
"Great venue (check out the bar and private dining rooms downstairs), with a nice patio facing Millennium Park.  Everything was super tasty, even on the lunch menu.  The owner came around and had a real conversation with each table, which was a nice touch."
"Fantastic food. The elk loin was amazing. The duck was crispy and tender and seemed endless. Scallops and short rib scallops were great. The poutine was so good. Excellent wine selection. Our waiter, Jarrod, was great and gave us some great recommendations on other places to check out."
"Moscow Mule, smoked salmon BLT, and chips (fries) with curry gravy.  Super friendly service, sizable booths, and lively lunch crowd.  I just don't know how I feel about a $40 lunch.  My tummy was happy, but my wallet wasn't.  I am not sure I would choose to come back or recommend this restaurant since there wasn't anything THAT special about it, especially for the price tag."
"I've been wanting to eat here for a while now. I've heard great things about it and was thrilled I finally got to go. I recommend a reservation since it's a popular place among the theater crowd.We ordered the Mussels to start. They were incredibly tasty. The sauce is well bodied with a little bit of spice. We asked for more bread for dipping! The mussels themselves were perfect. Only one had not opened during cooking & they had a creamy consistency. I've had some places serve them a little overdone & they become chewy. That is not the case at The Gage.The next round, I ordered the beet salad. The blend of orange & creamy texture from the goat cheese were the perfect pairing for the semisweet beets. Hands down one of the best salads I've had. My boyfriend ordered the eggplant ravioli. The ravioli was fresh & pillowy. The eggplant filling was by far the richest & creamiest I've ever tasted. Our waiter was incredibly attentive, knowledgable & witty. He made our experience that much more exciting & lovable. I can't wait to go back!"
It's Chicago and its a gastropub. You'll find these kinds of places everywhere in that city but I do have a fondness for Gage. They make delicious martini's and their fries with vinegar all over them are kind of perfect after wandering around in 32 degree weather for over 2 hours. All in all a great place to try while in the windy city.
"We had a fantastic meal here on our last night in town on a vacation.  The location is perfect, right across from the glass tower sculptures/fountains in Millenium Park at Michigan Ave.The place was packed as it was before a big concert.  We had a bit of trouble getting our table and the bar was a bit slow, but the staff was apologetic and comped part of our bill.We shared the kim chi scallops, which were mind-bending.  I had the sausages for an entree and my wife had the duck breast.  For dessert, we share something amazing with chocolate.The atmosphere was perfect, the kitchen was bustling, and everyone was having a great time.  What's not to like?!"
"I guess this place doesn't really need another 5 star review, but good god, the chillaquiles here are phenomenal! The service is also awesome. I was a part of a table of 8, and our waiter handled the table with ease :)"
I loved the whole experience of dining here... cocktails were great! Food was really top notch.. loved their presentation too! Great service and nice decor too! Will def go back.
"Wanted to put in a quick review for the event space in the downstairs at The Gage.  We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here in August, and everything was perfect.   We met with McKensie after Billy referred us to her about 5 months prior to the wedding.  She was great at getting our price estimates to us, and securing the space for us.  A month before the wedding she helped coordinate the final menu and staffing for the event.We had perfect service the whole night.  Everyone had an option of the steak or fish, and everyone was LOVING the food.  They also had a projector and sound system, which we were able to play a slideshow on.  After dinner we were able to keep the bar open downstairs for any other out of town guests that arrived.  It really worked well for us."
"This place is great.  I've eaten here about 15 times, and there were only a few times I didn't feel like they knocked it out of the park.  What is great about this place is that they have the freshest, highest quality ingredients.  If you get a salad, a side vegetable, bread, etc. you can be confident that it is going to be fresh and delicious.  This place doesn't cut corners in their product, and this is more than apparent after just a couple visits."
"We popped in here for lunch while in Chicago for vacation.  VERY good, though I wish we had saved it for a nice dinner...I felt a little under dressed, and being that it was lunch time, I didn't want to order a huge entree.The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  I loved the green subway tiles and the huge bar.  Bathrooms downstairs were very clean and there was a huge other room down there for large parties.The food was amazing.  Service was impeccable.  Next time we are in town, we will stay for dinner and make an event of it."
"I had two very different experiences at the Gage. But the second was so great, I have a positive feeling about the Gage now.First time was just two of us, and the service was painfully slow. They were slammed, and the server was nice. But I felt almost ignored, she was so busy. (she comped a drink for us because she knew it was ridiculously slow) It didn't help that there was a traaaaaaashed women sobbing in to her boyfriend's chest for most of the two hours we were there. That made every minute feel like five. After much debate, I went with fish and chips, since it's got a great reputation. I would say it's filling. I wouldn't call it special or unique or even that tasty. I'm not sure why the heck it's so popular.let's fast forward to the second visit. It was a work dinner, and a large group. Our server was incredibly attentive and answered our thousands of questions with enthusiasm. He basically took over and ordered tons of small plates for us all, since my boss kind of gave him the go-ahead. It's nice to sample most of the menu at a place like the Gage, where I wouldn't pay for all that myself!Mussels- cooked to perfection. We finished all three orders of these succulent little babies.Scotch egg- very unique, mustard was incredible. I kept stealing spoonfuls of this grainy mustard when no one was looking.Carmelized lobster- who doesn't love quinoa? and lemon? so bright and satisfyingBurgers- our Japanese clients always order burgers when they're in the US. They loved the burgers, and they always tell us the truth. I think they actually cleaned their plates.I ordered the market fish special that night, which I think was halibut. Yes, after all this food, I ordered fish. But it was juicy and delicate and lemony. To top off the feast, I had a delicious raspberry dessert that isn't on the menu now. I think they change their desserts frequently. I would bet they're all executed beautifully, though. The bathrooms are far away. If your server is like ours, and suggests many rounds of their strongest beer, you might want to think about skipping the loo. Those stairs were ominous after my last beer."
"Great place for lunch.  Service was professional and friendly and the food was upscale-comfort. It was freezing cold outside so I was thrilled to score the day's special lamb shepherd's pie with rich broth and mashed potatoes in a cast iron casserole.  There was also crusty whole grain bread and butter, and for an appetizer we munched on pickles, olives and a bit of good feta served simply in a preserve jar.  Loved the green and white subway-tiled walls and comfortable atmosphere."
We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. I had the scallops and my husband had the duck (done 2 ways). They were both excellent. We had drinks at the bar and they were good and reasonably priced. Large beer selection and many cocktail choices. Brother in law was also with us and there were a few vegan options for him.   The highlight of the evening was the desserts. One was complimentary for the birthday boy :)  Both the creme brulee and the doughnuts were amazing!!! Will definitely come back.
"I do not frequent pubs.  I do not normally eat pub food.  The term gastropub actually kind of grosses me out.  But The Gage is a whole 'nother animal.My experience here on a hopping October Thursday night was simply spectacular.  I love the 8 oz. pours of wine, for, as the menu observes, ""sharing or indulging."" (n.b., you can opt for a half-pour, too)I started with a draught seasonal Dogfish punkin ale paired with brie fondue.  It was simple comfort food at its best.  Not too runny, not too thick and did not cool off too much so it could be dolloped, spread on the long thin bruschetta and enjoyed to the finish.Next came crispy rabbit and avocado salad with a perfectly selected (by my dear bartender) white wine--  Tres Olmos Verdejo.  If you can get over the idea of eating little bunny-foo-foo, you will find the rabbit incredible.  It was quite like a hare-version of pulled pork eastern North Carolina barbecue.  Crispy skin and shreds of moist meat.  It was unlike any other prep of rabbit I have ever had and was amazing.    I finished with vindaloo mussels paired with an exquisite Sangiovese (again chosen by my bartender).  I exhibited no shame in sopping up the just-right-amount-of-zing sauce on my bruschetta (even slurping a spoonful or two with my spoon).  It was that freaking good. The bar area was a bit raucous but everyone was in good spirits and having a grand time.  The entire venue was slammed but the staff exhibited nothing but pleasant grace.  I would come back here in a heartbeat.  This was my best meal and all around experience in three consecutive days of gorging myself Chicago style."
"Went here for dinner friday night  right before we saw a play so we expected the place to be busy.Ambiance - It's nice.  I wasn't exactly ""WOWed"" or anything but it has a nice feel to it.  It must be a good place for happy hour because the bar area was packed.  The tables are a bit too tight and we were by the stairs to there's constant traffic with people coming in and out.  It's a little loud but not too bad that you can still hear and have a good conversation.The Good - hmmm... where to start... i'll break it down this way since we had a LOT to eat. - So we shared      - The Mussels - DELISH! It was cooked just right even though the sauce is a little too watery for my taste.     -  Tuna - I thought this was good. I liked the way it was put together. It was flavorful without tasting too fishy.     - Gage N-17 Fondue - YUMM! This was REALLY good. The bread that it came with was definitely complimentary to the cheese.     - Bison - This too, was great. It was tender, flavored just rightI had the fish and chips.  I haven't really had a lot of these so I don't have anything to compare it to.  I liked that the breading wasn't heavy and the fish was so meaty and didn't have that ""fishy"" taste. You can tell it was fresh and their tartar sauce was SUPER good.  The fries was mediocre.I tried their Loin special and it was good too. It came with meat ravioli and though it looked like it's not much, my friend said it was filling.  (But it was probably from all the dishes we shared).  I also tried the Short rib and oh-emm-gee! It was super tender, super juicy and it just melted in my mouth.We told our server that we have a play to catch and he got us in and out of there within the time that we wanted to leave.The Bad - It's not that bad, but it was tight.  Again, because we had a party of 9, our table was towards the end and the high traffic was a little distracting.The Bottom Line - great place to check out if you'rein the theatre district. I think a lot of its customers are either going to see a play or work in the area.  Definitely call ahead and make reservation or expect to wait.  If you're up to it, try differet dishes and share.  You'll be glad you did because a lot of their dishes are really good."
Going crazy with the 5 star!Mussels vindaloo yesScotch egg yesEscargot yessssssDinner greatChimay and great beers.Good scene on a Saturday night.I'll take it!
"Great service and a nice buzz in this place!  Lots of people watching - you have everyone from older couples to the 20 somethings dining/drinking here.  The drinks are awesome - I had a moscow mule! The food is great, just don't eat the beef tartar.  I tried it last time I was there and realized it is a 1st world food. No one in 3rd world countries actually eats uncooked meat if they can avoid it. I now know why..."
"Was really looking forward to eating here, however the fact that it was just as cold inside the bar than it was outside...eating was just keeping us content during our experience. Server was chatty, perhaps too shary shary and felt like we were an afterthought.  Asked to have the heat turned up..was bizarre to see people around us with jackets n scarves still on. Ehhhh...not planning on going back unless its just for drinks and then prolly in the summertime since i know there A.C. works. A candle was placed after our check was brought and then when asked to have it lit, waitress sighed ""if i light it, i'll have to put a new one out after it goes dead."" We huddled around that tiny little flame like liam neissen huddled around his bondfire in The Grey."
"If I go back, it will probably be for drinks, not dinner.  The drink menu was the highlight.   The food...   tries way to hard to be different.  Crunchy rabbit salad?  Whatever.  And be forewarned if you are a vegetarian or going to dinner with a vegetarian. There is virtually nothing without meat.    We are on the verge of 2013 and the ONLY thing to offer a vegetarian was an uninspired bowl of overpriced Risotto?   Perhaps for Christmas I should get the Chef a book on how to plan a meal with vegetables.  It was also really really really loud.  There was no way to have a conversation with anyone at the table but the person right next to me."
"Atmosphere was excellent.  Outdoor and indoor seating. Location is prime.  Service was super.  Fondue appetizer was perfect!  Good wine.  Burger was perfect.  My husband had the duck and it was good, but pre-made and heated.  Everything else was wonderful.  Would definitely go again."
"Full review w/ pics in blog.Explaining to our waiter that we'd be attending the conference and made a note telling us ""no problem.""Browsing the room I have to say I quite liked the dark woods and heavy feel of the room - the back of the restaurant actually quite attractive and mostly well isolated from the deafening noise of the bar area.  Service was friendly, hip, pleasant, and vastly better than any ""bar"" I've ever been to.Shortly after placing our orders the server returned with a warm loaf of ""Soda Bread"" with salted butter on a wooden serving board - having never tasted soda bread in the past I was somewhat excited.  Tearing off an end piece and topping it with butter I took a bite and was instantly impressed by the crispy crust and soft/airy insides with obvious notes of buttermilk.Braised Rabbit Salad with Crisp Rice, Langhe Robiola and Horseradish Vinaigrette the salad arrived appearing to be a big pile of Robiola with some sesame seeds and light dressing.  What the dish lacked in presentation, however, it more than recovered for in terms of taste, contrast, and variety of flavors.  Large in portion the savory rabbit meat was very well prepared and not one bit gamey while the crispy rice lent a nice contrast to the soft flesh.The Scotch Egg with spicy mustard - ""bar food"" at its best.  Tasting the mix of crispy (not oily) breading, smooth and mild egg, and spicy savory sausage together was like the best sausage and egg biscuit you can imagine - sure it isn't healthy, but damn is it good.Poached Swan Creek Duck Egg on Mushroom Toast with Shaved Grana Padano and it was actually better than the first egg.  First of all, if you've never had a duck egg you owe it to yourself to do-so (assuming you like eggs.)  Richer, creamier, and smoother than a hen egg this average sized specimen was perfectly poached with a creamy and rich yolk pouring forth when poked and lathering the combination of smooth shaved cheese and mélange of woodsy mushrooms with an intense flavor.  House Poutine with Elk Ragout, Curd Cheese, Chips.  First of all, the parts I was familiar with - the fries were great - large and cooked through with a good ratio of crunchy outside to smooth potato interior while the cheddar cheese curd was obviously quite fresh with a lot of squeak and only a mild bit of brine.  Anchoring the creamy cheese and crispy potatoes was a delectably rich and savory gravy of elk - a beast I'd never tasted - and hints of carrots, celery, and smoke.  Salty and delicious.I've had chicken nuggets.  I've had popcorn shrimp.  I've had deep fried sweetbreads.  I'd never had deepfried chicken livers.  Creamy, smooth, flavorful, perfectly coated and well done - but a belly bomb to say the least.  When it was all said and done our bill at The Gage was less per person than that at Blackbird and I enjoyed it nearly as much - a great surprise as I went in with skeptical expectations at best.  As I've said before, I'm not a bar guy - but if bar food at home were half this good I could become one."
"I'm actually pretty surprised this place was as good as it was.  Given its proximity to Anish Kapoor's Cloud Gate (what the hoi polloi call The Bean), I was expecting it to be overpriced and bland, as restaurants next to tourist attractions generally are.  But I had a lovely time - the food, service, and cocktails hit the spot.Though we made reservations at OpenTable, we sat at the bar (I love sitting at the bar to eat when there's two people; I think the service is better - it was here - and you get to sit next to your buddy, which is the best).  They serve local brews - you can get Goose Island just about anywhere (thanks for making it generic Anheuser Busch!), but try any of the Half Acres or New Holland Dragon Milk Stout (holy hell this is an amazing beer; might just trump Ten-Fidy).  They also have a pretty broad whiskey, bourbon (Willet!), and scotch selection if that's your thing (it is mine) and they do pretty sweet whiskey flights for about $30 (I didn't indulge, but I will next time I want to get messed up and see how many of my reflections I can find in Cloud Gate's omphalos, which, now that I think about it, sounds like a fabulous way to spend a Saturday).My companion had the Duck Confit Hash and Eggs ($15) and it was, for real, off the hook.  It comes with black pudding (please don't tell me what's in black pudding; let me bask in the glory of ignorance) and pumpernickel hash.  And if you think this sounds like good hangover food, you're absolutely right.  I had the Plancha Salmon ($14, essentially a salad kicked up a notch with orange, asparagus, peppers, and an excellent tarragon vinaigrette) and it was exactly what I needed.  In general the food is kind of like haute Irish cuisine (is that a thing?  It is now) - it's rich and hearty and bold and often innovative, with a dash of refinement.  I love the atmosphere too - soaring ceilings, a long mahogany bar, lively crowd (generally a good idea to make a reservation).  And though I was a tourist, dining near one of the city's top attractions, I felt like a local.  Sweet."
"The Gage is a great option if you are going to the theater - there aren't a lot of choices in the loop.   The vibe is very much upscale pub.  I would definitely recommend the fluke (white fish), though it was a special the night we went so not sure how often they have it.  It was fabulous.  We didn't love the mussel appetizer (the mussels were mushy), but our friends had the tuna and liked that.  We would definitely come back if we had something going on in the loop.  Service was great.  We had a great time here and they were good about getting us out in time to get to our show. We used an a la card for $10 off.44/365"
"I came here for a work lunch on a Monday around 12:30 and was surprised at how busy and bustling the restaurant was upon arrival. Luckily I had made a reservation so we were promptly seated at one of the few remaining tables.The service was spot on, as we were seated our water glasses were filled and menus were presented. The waiter ran through their three specials (a soup, sandwich, and entree) and gave us plenty of time to go review the menu. After we put in our orders they told us that bread service was optional, and we opted out of it. I liked the fact that bread was presented as an option, as many restaurants seem to generate a lot of wasted food due to patrons not wanting the bread.Anyhow, I decided to go with the Lamb Vindaloo Stew considering it was a cold and rainy fall day, and I was intrigued to see an Indian style stew. The dish came out swimming in a thick orange sauce and the Indian spices hit me right away. The lamb pieces were large, which made it a bit awkward to hack up the meat myself. Also, it seems as though whoever butchered the meat did a sloppy job as many of the bites of lamb were very fatty. The lamb itself had a great smoky flavor to it that was accentuated by the Indian spices in the sauce. There were only a few scant julienned carrots which was also disappointing, and the dish was overpowered by potatoes. The rice itself was nothing special--I was hoping for some true basmati rice but the rice looked and tasted like minute white rice.All in all I probably won't be back to the Gage anytime soon, but their sandwiches looked fantastic so I'd recommend those over the entrees.Food: 3Service: 4Atmosphere: 4"
"Had a nice late summer lunch on the patio with my son, who works nearby.  The service was attentive and professional and there were lots of different and fun menu choices.  I like that you can go crazy and extravagant or opt to keep it simple.  My son got the pulled pork sandwich and I went for the 1/2 sandwich and soup combo.  The soup ( a kind of creamy onion ) was fantastic, and my half chicken sandwich was HUGE!  And Yummy!   This was a nice find, and I'll definitely go back."
"The Gage makes me happy. It's a beautiful restaurant with an energetic crowd enjoying great food that lives up to its slightly higher price point given the location. It seems that Chicagoans like to drink at lunch, which made me feel better about having a gin martini at 11 a.m. Though I prefer my martinis served up, the ladies to my right at the bar ordered theirs on the rocks ""so it doesn't look like we're total lushes."" Ha!! I had already decided on having the soup du jour when the waiter said ""roasted tomato,"" but when he finished with ""topped with braised rabbit,"" I was beside myself with elation. I frickin' love rabbit. Bunnies is yummies. The soup made me very happy. I also love a good turkey sandwich, and here it was rescued from the mundane with soft Brie, shaved apple and crisp pickled onions.My mouth waters at the thought of it."
"There doesn't seem to be a lot of restaurants that truly change their menu according to the season. The Gage changes their menu often depending on the season, on what's fresh and local. This may turn some people away, but I find it refreshing.It is truly a gastropub with all of it's high-end beers, and ability to create a multi course meal. They also offer game such as rabbit, elk, & bison. I have always enjoyed my meal and always get 3 courses, which I don't usually do at most restaurants (does that make me weird?). If you live or are visiting Chicago, I would put it on your bucket list of restaurants."
Food was pretty good but definitely not worth the price.  Ambiance was fun but other places with better food and drinks.
"An Irish gastropub that serves top notch cocktails and fabulous food? You had me at hello. The Gage is my first choice for a great meal in Chicago. It seems burdensomely popular in general, but we had a reservation and arrived early and had no problem grabbing drinks at the bar. The menu is just perfect - Scotch egg, fish and chips, elk (ohhhh the elk) and other dressed-up pub-ey favorites. Part gastropub, part fancy restaurant, it oozes a trendy ambiance that will please any palate. The place is pricey for sure, and it's more on the ""modern restaurant"" side of the scale rather than the ""gastropub"" - but it's a place I'd recommend checking out on a date or with a group of friends. Beautiful, stylish, loud and well-played."
"In the sea of reviews for the swanky gem that is The Gage- hopefully mine gets a read.... In my not so humble opinion, a good bartender can make or break your experience. I don't do tables unless I'm with a group so despite our reserved spot we opted to chill with Thomas at the beautiful bar. He truly MADE our night! Thirteen Degrees was the cocktail I became immediately addicted to- the recipe is in my email box now, courtesy of Thomas the creator. Sage and gin- a combo made in lush heaven. Corn Elote? Not sure how they elevated corn to this level but trust- order it now. Roasted golden beet salad with an orange vin, goat cheese, spiced nuts and gorgeous candy striped beets sliced impossibly thin... Ahhhh maze. This isn't a fancy restaurant and we were glad. Henri next door bored us despite the incredible food. If you want some more action while indulging in some killer eats- come here ASAP!"
"I like the Gage. A lot. The food is top notch, and there is a very hip gastro-pub vibe to it. The tap selection is good, but not stellar, and the bottle list had some interesting items.It can get pretty crowded in there and loud as well. But I dig the atmosphere and the food has never disappointed."
"The Gage is a good spot to grab a meal and have drinks with the work crowd. I love this place in the summer especially because the location is great. I went recently and had a good meal. I've had the Mussels as well as ""The Regular Burger"" and both are delicious. The wait here can be kind of long but nothing unexpected. Overall a great spot to grab a meal and drink in a pretty cool area."
"Just went for lunch, had a great experience!  They were busy but we were able to be seated quickly which was nice, everything we had was flavorful and the cocktails were delish!!  Glad we stopped in!!"
"The Gage really gets it right: food, service, atmosphere. Last night, we arrived for a 7:45 reservation for 6 but actually had 8 people. (One of us goofed.) They were able to accommodate us in a short amount of time. Our server was excellent - taking care of drink orders, laughing with us, making sure we had what we needed without hovering. We lucked out and got to sit back by the kitchen on a cold Chicago night. Will definitely be back."
"Were in Chicago two weeks ago and craved Gelato in the evening.   All gelato places nearby already closed (after 8 PM), so trusted Yelp to try out ""The Gage"" which came up.   Stopped in and they indicated they did have some blueberry gelato and made up a two scoop to go cup.   We were happy!   Thanks Gage for meeting our needs."
"Although Gage is not recommended for kids, the staff did an amazing job of accommodating for ours. Thanks to a thunderstorm our family got stranded in Chicago overnight on our way home from Boston. In the 10 days we were away, Gage was by far the best meal we had during that time. In fact it was one of the best casual meals we've ever had.  We started by ordering the poutine for our table since our kids love French fries and they devoured them. My husband said that the venison burger was probably the best burger he'd ever had, and the man loves burgers so you can be sure he's had many a variety. I had the Moroccan chicken sandwich and needed but to close my eyes to take me straight to Morocco. The flavor profile was delicious and spot on. It also came with a cup of chicken soup with orzo and English peas which was to die for. The peas, my oh my, amplified the dish to an insanely fresh level. I need to find a way to recreate this soup.We decided to order because after everything else had blown our minds we'd be stupid not to. We ordered a nectarine tart (it wasn't technically a tart, but close enough) with a honey lavender ice cream. Perfection. The ice cream was a home run. I am picky with ice creams, having discovered Smitten in San Francisco. This was at the same level. We also had a creme brulee. The kids loved it as much as we did and all but licked the dish clean like a dog would. The crunchy delicate sugar crust on top was flawless. If ever we return to Chicago, you can be sure we will stop by Gage."
"My bantam boxer friend Eric, who is from Chicago, recommended The Gage on my query, ""I eat breakfast there every time I'm in town.""So in between tourist destinations, and on a time crunch near Millennium Park, this place promised something more local than Pot Belly or Bennigan's. ""What's good?""""The special is a Pastrami Sandwich"" answered the solicitous pretty waitress.   And yes, it was a good pastrami sandwich, but when the bill came, $15.50 it seemed a bit steep, but after all, I was on Michigan Avenue in the thick of it all.A hotel restaurant with business people all around you.  Decent lunch.Food is better than average but there was a faint whiff of BS going around."
"The best brisket in town? Possibly. They hide it under a little too much greens, but they did go well with the brisket as did the green apples. The brioche on the bottom is awesome. Their drinks are great and their beer selection is spot on. The specials are always great which poses a problem as it usually messes up my original order idea. Even though I dislike the current fad of ""gastropubs"" popping up everywhere, the Gage actually does it right..."
"We had a late dinner here on their front ""patio"" Monday 6/21/2014 around 7 pm. Inside was very cool and quite loud. Our server Kevin was friendly and very knowledgeable about the entire menu. We had drinks that were all expertly prepared and shared some ""starters"" mussels, fondue and a Caesar salad. We spent several hours slowly savoring the delicious food, strong drinks and of course each other company. Food and service both are what I would consider upscale, we had such a great time there I don't think we could go back to Chicago without going back the The Gage at least once"
"First time here and i wasn't expecting much, but their poutine was AMAZE- balls. No joke- I think it's turned me into a fan. We ordered their fried egg, beet salad, spare rib beef with kimchi and overall, wasn't that great. Sad to say, but only their poutine was amazing. Everything else was mediocre."
We stopped here for lunch after visiting the Art Institute in the morning. It's a very close walk to the Gage from there so I recommend it if you're in the area. My date ordered the lobster roll and it was pretty good. I had the turkey club with house made potato chips. I'm a big sandwich fan and the turkey club was a good and safe choice. I wouldn't mind coming here again and trying their other items on the menu.
"Went for lunch on Saturday afternoon, got there about 12:30 and had about a 30 minute wait.  Service was prompt, attentive, and friendly, and the food was good.  The tables are all very close to each other, and the noise level was a little above what I'm really comfortable with.  Everything is a hard surface, so it just echoes around in there.I had heard this was a gastropub with a good beer selection.  The beer selection was eclectic, but underwhelming.  I had expected something like the Muddy Pig from the Twin Cities in terms of beer selection, so partly I overexpected.  They have about 20 beers on tap from what I recall of the menu, and maybe equal the number in bottles.I had the slow roasted pork sandwich, a bit dry but tasty.  My table also ordered the brussels sprouts with brie which was fabulous, and the wild mushroom sandwich - also very good.  The prices we paid for our food was reasonable for the kind of restaurant this is.  I would go back if I'm in Chicago, but hopefully at a less noisy time."
"Went for brunch, and was a bit disappointed after hearing good things about The Gage. My nephew and I like to check out different brunch spots on the weekend, and we had not been there before, so I was looking forward to something new and different.  They had a fairly limited brunch menu, so I went with the Eggs Benedict. I liked the Irish Rashers they used versus Canadian bacon...but the ""spicy"" hollandaise was bland and left something to be desired.  Also, the side item was ""Crisp Brie Potatoes"" which sounded yummy on the menu, but fell flat in presentation.  My nephew got the Traditional Irish Breakfast, which was definitely the winner of the two dishes.  The White Pudding was excellent.Kudos for the service from the busboys.  Definitely attentive without being overbearing.Not so many kudos for our waitress.  She was fine during the meal, but committed my number one restaurant service faux pas by coming by to pick up the signed credit card receipt while my nephew and I were still chatting at the table.  Never acceptable to me at any time...but especially so when I'm sure she wasn't finished with her shift, since the restaurant had just opened when we arrived.Ah well.  It might be worth a try for dinner some other night, to see what all the fuss is about.  As for brunch...there are many, many better options in the neighborhood.  I won't be back."
This is a classic restaurant in Chicago and I can't believe today was the first time I ate here.  I ate the corned beef hash... which was gluten and dairy free.  It was AMAZING.    We also ordered the ribs and baby Brussels sprouts to share with the table.  Highly recommend.  I would say this the best restaurant in the loop.
"Spending a lot of time in Chicago now due to changes in my work, and of course now working thru the local restaurants.  Went to Gage with a friend on his recommendation.  Place was far too noisy.  We couldn't have much of a conversation, and this was despite asking for a table in the back where  it was away from the bar.  An outdoor table might have been an option, but who likes the buses roaring by?  It's obvious that they're working hard in the kitchen to create new an tasty dishes.  I had two of the new, but found them pedestrian and tasteless.  The cold melon soup was a good idea, but was missing something.  And the ravioli was as bland as a cantonese dumpling.  Meh.Servers were friendly and attentive.  We passed on ordering a bottle of wine, deciding that we didn't want to sit in the cacophony any longer than necessary.I'm sure some would enjoy this dining experience.  Those that follow my reviews can easily see why I didn't."
i have a love hate relationship with this place.  It just seems really out of place.  I personally think its totally overpriced for what you actually get. The staff is really nice but it feels almost to stuffy at times.  I wish the bar area was bigger as it seems like every stool is filled 100% of the time ( which is good for them ).  The tables near the bar are tiny and you are sitting on top of the people next to you.  The back of the restaurant is nice and very well decorated.  You end up walking out of here spending more than $100 and never really thinking you are full or it was fully worth it.  I have been at least 5-10 times for work functions or a quick pinch to get something to eat and Ill probably still go back at some point so I guess my rating should be a 3.5 :)
"This city hot spot came highly recommended, and it did not disappoint! I used to find it sad to sit alone at a restaurant, but this spot was anything but lonely for solo chick. I parked it at the bar and ordered a beer (their list was rather intimidating). The grilled octopus on a bed of arugula with watermelon and goat cheese was to-die-for, as was their sweet corn and lobster soup. I was nowhere near hungry after those and a couple of beers, but was told that I ""simply cannot leave without dessert"". I'm not one for sweets, but the waitress said that the baklava, fig and Greek yogurt drizzled with honey and almonds basically made the other deserts look like a scoop of vanilla ice cream, so I tried it. For someone who doesn't like sweets, I finished every bite. I made new friends at the bar, just for ordering that dish- everyone wanted a bite!This was one of my favorite meals in Chicago."
"Gah! I am sad to have to drop The Gage a star. After a wonderful experience last year, I came back for Restaurant Week and I can't say that the menu was its best effort, nor did it impress my out-of-town guest. All the things that wow'ed me the first time came short. The service was rushed and harried. Our server forgot about half the table and brought out food before some had even ordered. I am sure that he was slammed for Restaurant Week, but opportunities like that are ones that get people into your restaurant to become fans. It's not gracious to appear disinterested and bored throughout the meal. I get it. I have a job where I am called to smile and engage even when I am tired or preoccupied. You know what I do? Smile and engage.The Restaurant Week Menu was rather weak. The options were uninspired and definitely not a representation of the best the menu has to offer. I was disappointed to see none of my favorites on the RW menu. The lobster bisque was runny and bland. My fish was 'petitely' portioned... and bland. My dessert was... dessert but entirely unexciting. I found myself wishing I'd just ordered from the regular menu. The thing is, why participate in RW if you're not going to give a d@mn? Offer your good stuff. Impress my guests! Make me look good. As it was, I looked like an idjit for suggesting we come here. I can say that after the service and food at The Gage during RW, there are a few Philadelphians and New Yorkers who will be in no hurry to rush back nor to tell their friends to try it when they come to Chicago. And, that's really too bad because such should not have been the end result.Points to the bus boys, though, for staying the course and being busy bees. Thing is, if the best thing I have to say about my dining experience is that the bus boys were hard working... what does that tell you? C'mon, The Gage. You're better than this."
"Had a quick dinner here after our daughters piano recital: - Wonderful service (we had a 7 year old and were in a hurry), very attentive - even splitting the third and fourth (salad and  entree) that my wife and I shared. - Great food. We started with the fondue, very rich and plenty of bread. Shared the crispy-rabbit salad (perfect) and the tuna something or-other (also perfect).We'll be back for sure."
"Something that I always look forward in a restaurant is the ambiance, and the gage has got it right! Really unique place with table and bar sitting. It feels trendy yet very casual. The music is great and the bartenders/servers always very friendly. Food was really good. I must make a comment about their cocktails: Never had I had such good cocktails in any other restaurant/bar. Tried the La Pamplemousse and 13 degrees, both a must if you are into cocktails and going to the gage. Not from Chicago, but definitely wanna go to this restaurant every time I visit. Loved it. Always add to the fun with good company. ;)"
"Was at the Gage last night with friends. I ordered a $45.00 stem very rare. When it finally arrived, one hour twenty minutes later, my steak had been cooked to death. Not one drop of moisture left in it. I sent it back with instructions on how to cook a rare steak. When the server returned with a replacement, twenty minutes later, it too was extremely over cooked and all of my friends had finished their meals. I left hungry, unfed and very disappointed in the overall lack of attention to detail. not only to me but our entire party. I will say this, the restaurant was not very busy and they were probably not a custom to actually having to cook."
"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in the world. I have ordered most things off of their brunch and dinner menu and it has all been amazing. Get the soup of the day, even if it doesn't sound like you'd like it, you will. Oh yeah and they have amazing cocktails and waitstaff. Go!!!"
"This place is great, the food, service and ambiance are all 5 star!We had the Fondue, Butternut Squash soup to start, then the Cobia fillet and the Risotto. All of the dishes looked beautiful and tasted great. My favorite dish was this little poached pear dessert that came with mini funnel cakes."
"Everything we had hear was delicious... except for the duck fat peanuts. I didn't see what the hype was, couldn't tell the difference between them and regular nuts. In any case, really enjoyed that they have small, medium, and large plates so you can share. We split the buffalo caprese, which was fresh and delicious. The gazpacho, which had a lump of delicious, fresh crab. The poutine, which is essentially cheese fries and really, really heavy. The venison burger was also huge and on a delicious toasted brioche bun.In summary: Huge portions, fun to share, everything was tasty."
"Went for brunch on a Saturday and had the traditional Irish breakfast. I was a big fan, although it certainly won't be for everyone. The black and white puddings were not something some of the people I was there with were expecting (pudding in this case meaning sausage, essentially), but their lunch items are available too which should satisfy even picky eaters.Service was exceptional. Staff was attentive and extremely pleasant for 10am (bit too early for me, but I wasn't paying, and life is give and take). The space is beautiful dark woods and tile, although the tables in the front room are rather tightly packed.This place gets a ton of hype, and while for my first time here I wasn't blown away, it was very, very good. Definitely will return to try dinner."
"We stumbled upon The Gage one Friday evening after Summer Dance.  Since we had no reservations, we waited about 40 min, but it was all worth it.Most restaurants located right on Michigan Ave, aka tourist central, aren't representative of Chicago, but I've heard of this place and encouraged everyone to make a stop here (after vetoing other places along the way).So here's the lowdown on the food.  We ordered Mussels, Seared Sea Scallops, Caramelized Lobster ""salad"" (only $16!!!!), Brie Potatoes and Woodland Mushrooms.  All great, but the Lobster salad, man oh man was it good!  I dream of it.  And really, for $16, there was a generous amount of lobster.  You can't get hat much lobster in a salad in the suburbs, let alone in the city.  In terms of drinks, I got some raspberry or strawberry beer, which was very blah.  And someone else ordered some cocktail (don't remember the name), which was ok.  Next time, we'll just pick better.  Another plus, our the bill ended up being about $35 per person with tip.The bottom line is, I'd go back just for the Lobster salad (or two)."
"This is an amazing place for dinner and drinks, no matter what night it is. Tucked up next to Millennium Park, this place has the best apps and dishes found in the area. It's more of an adult style atmosphere and experience, but I'm sure the kids will fit right in."
"If you are a beer drinker the bar here is great.  Good beer selection and prices are not any higher than other places in the loop (most micros are $6/pint).  Pro tip: If you are here for happy hour order the Brie Fondue.  It comes with a half a baguette of garlic bread for dipping, and if you run out they will give you another half loaf for nothing."
"This place is simply great!Had drinks at the bar before being seated - the bartenders were friendly and the bourbon was excellent, try the Blanton's. We had the fondu, which was unbelievable. Salads - beat salad and Caesar salad respectively. Followed by the duck course and the steak w potatoes course. Unreal, cooked perfectly. I will recommend strongly to anyone"
"What did I miss?  That's all I keep asking myself as I reread all of the stellar reviews.  My friend and I decided to check out the Gage for dinner on Friday night.  It took a very long time to decide as everything looked amazing.  I was really excited to try so many things, mostly because of the combination of flavors, especially in the first course section.We decided to start with the house poutine and the fried chicken livers.  Both were pretty good but nothing tremendous.  They were very generous portions, however.  For my entree I chose the bone in monkfish and my friend had the mussels.  The monkfish was really disappointing.  It was overcooked, rubbery and bland.  I was hoping to at least enjoy the white beans, as they were supposed to be flavored with chicory and oven dried tomatoes, but they were just run of the mill white beans.  My friend felt that her mussels were pretty bland as well.Our server was nice and the ambiance is good.  Perhaps we ordered wrong?  I don't know but my friend is still talking about how disappointed she is.  And I kind of agree."
"Great experience! It was empty when we walked in for 11:15am reservations, but by noon there wasn't a single table open. I had the lobster roll, and my friend had the seared scallop salad. Loved every bite - tons of lobster on delicious roll. Service was great, too!"
"Liked it. Good service. Assorted, and different bar food. Scottish eggs and Pontine surprisingly good. A bit noisy. Bustling bar."
"The food and service is extraordinary. Try their carrot soup (one of the soup of the day), its delicious. Also try their hot chocolate after a heavy meal, its orgasmic."
"The Gage is a quality dining experience - you can expect sophisticated menu offerings and very nicely prepared food. I've had the pleasure of both dinner and brunch here, and would recommend either.For dinner, you can't go wrong with the seared sea scallops or roasted Amish chicken. The portions are a decent size, and the food is very well prepared. I wasn't keen on the vindaloo mussels - an interesting concept, but it didn't quite the mark. The wine selection is quite nice and the staff is happy to make recommendations.When it comes to brunch, I thoroughly enjoyed the French toast and my partner was excited by the traditional Irish breakfast. The brunch offerings weren't stellar, but certainly left a good impression.My main complaint about The Gage is the way noise carries throughout the restaurant - I could hear every word of the conversation from the table next to us, and there was a woman two tables away that sounded like she was screaming in my ear. And this was at the back of the restaurant - I can only imagine what the noise levels must be like near the bar!"
"Billy Lawless's Michigan Avenue sister to Henri is a great pub-style space to go for lunch, happy hour or dinner and won't disappoint on any level. i went there this week for lunch and tried the venison burger with spicy peppers which was succulent and delicious. Wow. Right across from the Bean sculpture on Michigan Avenue this Millennium Park spot has great food, drinks and service so if you are undernourished or under-watered head in for a respite."
"Really, it's 4 1/2 except it can get very loud and very cramped in the main dining areas. The bar is always comfortable and even when busy, most of the bartenders will take time to help you sort through your food and drink choices. The lunch special deal of 1/2 sandwich with cup of soup (and usually fries) is great!  I've never put anything in my mouth here (liquid or solid) that wasn't just delicious. It's easy to get to before or after any ""downtown"" events and if you reserve for a group, they'll get you some dedicated staff to make sure you're well taken care of. Like a cruise ship, it seems there are 3 staff for every patron so the place is crowded.  And quite a walk down the stairs to the bathroom (where there is private area for functions).  While many might consider this a ""tourist"" place because of its location, go check it out for yourself and see how it feels to you. Personally, I love the Gage and make excuses to meet up there whenever possible!"
"Came here for lunch around 2pm; we had reservation, but it still was really really crowded. Um, all I have to say is that the burgers here and fries are AMAZING! Atmosphere is really really nice, and it is really really conveniently located. Nothing to complain, and I would say it is comparable to Kuma's corner, a really good burger restaurant."
"I always enjoy a good trip to The Gage. This past weekend I went for lunch - ordered the half sandwich {wild mushrooms} and soup {tomato bisque}. the soup came out cold though the fries were delish and piping hot. The waiter was attentive and brought us new hot soup very quickly before we really dug into our sandwiches.Good ambiance, fun location, food is always good."
"My Husband and I usually avoid Mich bc of all the tourist but it was too cold to go much further.  We sat at the bar for lunch.  Service was great.  Awesome beer selection.  I had scallop salad, three huge scallops cooked perfectly.  My Husband got the venison burger medium well and it was cooked perfectly.  Started to get crowded but the vibe was nice.  We will be back."
"Been back to the Gage a 1/2 dozen times since the original review and it has become one of my favorite places in Chicago.  Great food and atmosphere, do yourself a favor and order the Venison burger, you won't regret it.  The poutine is top notch as well, the antelope tartar is not my favorite but the wife enjoys it greatly."
I would say that the only reason I did not do 5 stars was because of the noise level. I could barely hear my wife when she was talking to me. In fact the manager was walking around and came to us to ask us we were doing and I had to ask him to repeat himself. He apologized for the volume of music (live band) but did nothing about it.The food was great. My wife and I had zero complaints and the service was good despite it being St. Patrick's day.
"Went in at 12 o'clock noon with a friend and a couple with a 10 month old baby.  It was already bustling with the lunch crowd and we definitely thought it would be a while before getting a table, but the staff worked with us and gave us a table which had enough room for a high-chair.  They were extremely accommodating, bringing us extra cups and hot water; whatever the baby needed, she got.  The food was awesome, we got the Gage fondue and poutines to start.  The fondue tasted better than the stuff you can get at the Melting Pot.  It was an awesome cheesy dip we all couldn't get enough of.  We ordered more toast!My friend from Spain and I both had the venison burger.  During his trip here, he tried four burgers and he said this one was the best one.  There was no gaminess to the meat and it was cooked perfectly medium-rare; juicy and tasty.  The girls had the roasted chicken and seared scallops and let me tell you the scallops are gigantic.  I've been to quite a few restaurants in my day and these were way up there in terms of size! I could tell they were perfectly sear-cooked, charred on top and bottom and slightly translucent in the middle.  As a final note, they actually had my heart the moment I stepped into the place.  They have a wonderful collection of rare scotch!"
Decent price for tapa style dishes! Great place for catching up with friends or having a romantic dinner.
"I stopped here for lunch with my buddy Ed before an excursion to the Art Institute.  The Gage is right across the street, you can't beat that.   It was a whopping 98 degrees outside so walking into this wonderfully air conditioned restaurant and were supplied with beer and water immediately was a plus.  They knew what they were doing.  Our waiter was very nice and explained the beers on tap and the specials.  They had a brisket sandwich special that sounded amazing and Ed, elected for that.  I chose the Smoked Salmon BLT.  Which was just amazing.  Served on a toasted rye with a caper aioli, cucumbers, and ground mustard.  It was a little messy, huge, and delicious!  The smoked salmon was just perfect with the bacon.  I had this with the Southen Tier Oak-Aged Unearthly on tap it was a match made in heaven.  The service there was spot on from the hostess, to the waiter, to the busboy they were all professional.  The manager came by to check on our meal and dig on the beers we got.  I really would like to come back for dinner and I will soon!"
Two words:  Venison burger... it was probably the best burger I have ever had in my entire life.
"Great food, friendly service. So much better than that corporate place Bennigens just a block south. Highly recommended.Within moments of entering we were greeted and seated. Our waitress was friendly and fast. She even poured my beer! Twice! Woohoo!The food is a little pricey but it's worth every penny."
"The Gage was the perfect place to meet with friends before a show at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The menu is full of incredibly intriguing dishes, which made deciding incredibly difficult! We finally chose the fondue and the poutine for the table (both incredibly delicious, and perfectly portioned for sharing between 4 people). Our entrees were the venison burger and the asparagus & leek ravioli. I would especially return for the ravioli, it was light & fresh, and the flavors were amazing. It is sometimes hard to find a unique place to dine in the Loop, so if you are looking for someplace special, this is it!"
"This is definitely a place to be seen..  It's echoes loudly with chatty people looking to impress and be impressed..  Definitely a cool place..The food:Most of it was good.  Pickle & olive starter - BEST DAMN PICKLE i've had in a while...  kekeFish & Chips - Both super crunchy..  Large Portion..  Can't go wrong...Burger - Husband wolfed it down.  Said it was decent..Steak - decent portion and cooked medium rare.  It was flavorful and IMHO, better than David Burke steak house...  Caesar Salad - WAY too fishy for my.  But my mother in law and husband loved it...  They actually asked for more anchovies...  So yes, if you like fishy food, this is a must get...Aside from the food, this place is great for grabbing a drink and people watch..."
"When you dine at the Gage, definitely try and do so when the weather is nice and snag a table outside. Also, be prepared to spend a lot of green. The food is unique, high quality, and tasty, but it is not cheap. In terms of drinks, our table stuck to the beer list (which is pretty expansive and impressive) and the prices were okay. The only thing that was a complete rip was $9 for a pint of Goose Island's Green Line. My uncle developed that beer and I don't even think it should cost that much! $4 or $5 would be a much more reasonable price. I know we're on Mich Ave, but whatever. In terms of food, we all split the vindaloo mussels, which were ridiculously yummy. Would definitely order those again as my meal! I ordered the scallops and Amish chicken. Scallops were good, but not $16-for-2-scallops-good. The Amish chicken was very flavorful, tender, and more appropriately priced. Others in our group ordered the salmon and sea bass special, both of which were excellent."
"Many dishes were had on my recent trip here.  I definitely ordered more then my stomach could handle.  The best thing I ordered:  Goat Cheese Grits.  Om nom nom.  Creamy goat cheese swirled in with hot grits.  Tip: It's hiding as a side dish on their brunch menu.  Just order it.  I also ordered the House Poutine:  elk ragout, curd cheese, & gravy over fries.  It was a super rich concoction, maybe a bit too rich for me.  It was good but I probably wouldn't order it again.  By the time my ""The Gage"" burger came out, my stomach was already at 80% capacity.  Argh, thanks a lot poutine and delicious grits.  The burger was beefy goodness and the melted onion marmalade/local camembert cheese toppings were delicious.  To top it all off, a freshly baked roll holding it all together.  I think this is the first time I couldn't finish a burger, but I'm glad I didn't.  It made for an awesome meal the next day.The service was great, with a friendly server and drinks promptly refilled.  Our table on the other hand was a bit small and a fork or spoon went over board a couple times.  Haha, our neighbors were having the same issue.  There's also a nice bar area with dogfish beer on tap. Me likey.  I'll be back for sure, for the goat cheese grits and maybe some brunch."
"Anniversary dinner before The Last Ship opening. We were running late, missed our reservation. We called ahead to let them know and they said they would do their best to accommodate. This usually translates into, ""No chance of getting served!"" Lauren, the hostess, got us a table. Johnny, our server, knew we were pressed for time and made sure we wouldn't miss a thing.  Is it possible to have a quick dinner, but it not feel rushed? That is what we needed and The Gage nailed it with time to spare! Awesome food, very generous portions and impeccable service. This place ""gets it"" and we will be back. Venison burger with side of baby carrots was crazy good. Their Fish and Chips ranks among the best I've ever had. Cannot recommend more highly!!!"
"Great meal! Went for dinner prior to  Show at Chicago Theatre ( 5 minute walk). Hostess and bar staff super friendly and welcoming. Sat down for dinner in front part of restaurant,  tables are close but not oppressive.  Split the smokey lamb chops as an app, excellent flavor and cooked perfectly. I chose the halibut entrée which was 5 star without question, served with a mild curry sauce over asparagus. Again cooked to perfection chefs here know their craft. Will be back soon."
"My boyfriend goes here a few times a month as he works a couple doors down, and he even had his work party in their subterranean party room.  I finally got my chance the other evening!AMBIANCE-- This place is really cozy- and it seems to go back forever.  It's really quite large.  It's dark, romantic.  We sat in the very back room just across from the open kitchen.  It gives the back room a feeling of being close to the magic happening.  It's also a little noisy.  So if you have something special going on, or are trying to do business, stay away from that room.  SERVICE- Our waiter was phenomenal.  The room was noisy and he spoke up for us so we didn't have to completely not hear the chef's specials.  He explained the specials well, had some awesome recommendations for us, both in the way of food and wine.  FOOD- You come to the Gage, you have to get a Scotch Egg. It's a ""Gage thing.""  It's delicious.  If I had any idea how to make this thing- it would be y new comfort food!  For entrees, I had the house made and local sausages.  YUM!  So delicious.  The potatoes that come with it were fairly tasteless, but who cares- the rest was sausage-riffic!!!  I can't remember what my boyfriend got, but he loved it. We were so impressed by the meal, we thought we'd be fools not to press our great luck and try a dessert too.  We did split a dessert- amazing.  It was a a fig, fresh vanilla dessert.  Just convinced us more- place is unique and really does not cut corners on quality!Keep in mind- each dish here has an intensely thoughtful and intriguing mix of ingredients.  It's pretty inspired cooking, and I was surprised by this.  It's quite upscale techniques, and makes for a very sophisticated experience."
"Pre-anniversary drink? You've got it. Nothing like a dark, sexy, warm and wooded bar to ply you with some cocktails before you celebrate 365 of (usually) wedded bliss.And, I'm just gonna declare this: The Gage makes the best Moscow Mule in the city. FACT. The key components: copper mug (check), crushed ice (check), bitingly crisp ginger beer (check), a healthy squeeze of lime (check). My grandma and grandpa would approve, and face it, that's how I know what a real Moscow Mule should be. OBVIOUSLY, there was vodka in there too, but really...a Moscow Mule in a non-copper mug just isn't.My husband enjoyed the old fashioned. (I might've enjoyed a taste or two as well.) YOU HAVE TO SHARE WITH YOUR SPOUSE. (And this is considered marital wisdom because I am officially not a newlywed. You should listen to me.)Service was stellar. The bartenders were very sweet and hasty on the drinks. It was my favorite combination. (I can't hate on two separate gals that paid me separate compliments either. I was feeling the love.)We decided we will have to return for a real meal. But for cocktails to kick off our fantastic anniversary celebration? It was perfect."
"I'm not sure what a gastropub is but The Gage seems like an Irish pub's rich older sister.  Polished enough to enjoy brunch on a Sunday before spending the afternoon looking at art.  The bloody Mary was bloody good and a perfect lazy Sunday accompaniment to my chorizo, spinach, and swiss omelette with a side of Brie potatoes, buttered whole grain toast, and a watermelon slice.   More than I could finish!  My friend had the eggs Benedict with a bellini, both of which she enjoyed.  Table bread was crusty, rustic, and delightful.Atmosphere was lively, and service was awesome.  Food came out very quickly.  Would love to go back!"
The Scotch egg is awesome and they have a variety of creative drinksService the last time I was there was less than thrilling but I would go back
"Great place to warm ourselves after a chilly walk around Millenium Park across the street(the Bean)  and the Art Institute of Chicago.  My Bloody Mary hit the spot and made the perfect appetizer to our meal.  Our ""real"" appetizer was a Scotch Egg which I've never tried before anywhere else but this was pretty dang yummy.  The yolk was also perfectly cooked, not runny but not cooked all the way through...juuuuuust perfect.My friend's smoked salmon sandwich was a tad big salty.  She thought it would be hot smoked salmon (cooked) but it turned out to be the cold smoked kind.  Combined with the bacon, the sandwich was a little salt-heavy but still good.  Their fries were bomb-diggity.I ordered the Duck Confit with grits which have been...awesome...if it had more salt to it.  But I appreciated the spirit of the dish and enjoy every bite.I also got a side of their brie and bacon brussel sprouts which was quite possibly my favorite part of the meal.  Just when I'd forgotten there was supposed to be brie in the dish, I hit upon a ooey gooey pocket of melted cheese and it just imparted the best quality to this unassuming side dish.Service was somewhat efficient.  Our server seemed a little scared to come near my voiceless dining companion (my friend lost her voice due to a cold) but was otherwise quite pleasant.I would have liked more space, especially since we were all carrying around an extra 50 lbs of winter clothing but alas, what are we going to do about it, you know?"
"Sat afternoon in sunny Chicago....what do you do?  BOOZE thats what!!!At a place that is hip with an outside eating area and great people watching.Where???  Here that's where.They have a great drink selection.  We tried all of them....whoops.  Anyway, my favorite one by far was the Capone....I think I have become a fan of gin in my older years.  It was crisp, light and refreshing...PERFECTO.  The other ones were great too, but this one took the cake.Also, we had the mussels.  BY FAR THE BEST MUSSELS in the CITY!  Man, it was tasty.  My other favorites include HB, but Gage blew them away.On to the scene...GREAT people watching.  You have a mix of city-ians, tourists, trash, professionals, wedding go-ers...you name it, its here.  The mix=a great Saturday and you have a view of Michigan Ave and Millennium Park :)"
"1)  Seated us precisely at our reservation time.2)  Nice, warm ambience.  We sat in a cozy booth.3)  Wait staff was impeccable.4)  Eclectic menu.5)  Food was very good.6)  Did not break the bank.7)  Will be back."
"Olives and PickleS. They give you 1 large pickle that's cut in half. I don't think that constitutes as plural. Definitely not worth it since every sandwich or burger comes with a half a pickle anyway. The green olives weren't pitted. Thumbs down.Fried chicken liver, pretty awesome. Get it.House poutine, it was okay. Just fried drenched in some sauce. Very cheesy. Can get kinda messy.Tried the Gage burger, medium. Overall, not bad.Expresso was strong, just how I like it. Although one my co-worker got a bad one and a dirty spoon. Tsk tsk tsk.Probably around $30 per person without drinks."
Great meal. We ordered a few of the early courses to share while splitting a bottle of wine. The asparagus with morels was perfection. I returned a weeks later for lunch and ordered the chicken salad. The serving was huge and the flavors spot on for Spring. I can't wait to dine there again.I took away a star because I think the dress code is mislabeled. We were dressed casual clothes and felt very out of place on a Saturday night. It may be casual during the week but is smart/business casual on the weekend.
Great place for St Patrick day. Great irish food. It is also good for the happy hours. Try burgers.
"Went here today for lunch with my girlfriend. It's a great location, so wasn't surprised to see a good mix of tourists and business people. I'd been once before and had the burger, which was pretty good.Today, we had the brisket and turkey sandwiches. Both were OK. The brisket was the better of the 2, but somewhat greasy. The turkey had a lot of brie and this walnut heavy spread, so the 2 together didn't work very well. Was a good size sandwich though.Good beer selection."
"Tips for brunch at The Gage:1.  You will not need a reservation at 11 on a Saturday, even the weekend before Christmas.  You may, however, need one at 12.2.  Request a table near the front so that you can enjoy the space brightened by natural light.  I've always been fond of their aesthetic, but sunlight brings an unexpectedly freshening and comforting quality.3.  The brunch menu is modest, even a little boring; but the lunch menu looks much like the dinner menu only with more sandwiches.  Order from the lunch menu.4.  If you insist upon a brunch item, get the biscuits and gravy.  Oh yes, do.5.  Want a healthy starter?  How about the enormous plate of fresh fruit.  Even in December you will find watermelon, strawberries, and blueberries at summer quality, not to mention honeydew cubes, raspberries, peeled orange slices, and something akin to a dark pink, non-tart grapefruit.  Oh, there's yogurt and granola on that plate too, but the fruit is by far the visual and gustatory star of that scene.6.  The omelette might be a little blasé, but the handsome cast-iron dish of delicious crispy, garlicky potatoes redeems it considerably.  7.  If you like the lunch menu, start with some soup; with luck they'll offer the parsnip puree that you had never realized was the perfect December afternoon soup.8.  Pair that soup with a scotch egg for one of the best first courses you can imagine.  It may almost sadden you to move on to the main dish, but chances are strong that you've made another fine choice and will not be disappointed.9.  Open your visit with a Guinness.  If you're brunching during the holiday season, close it with an Affligem Noël.  If you happen to miss the Noël, I'm sure that they will have another excellent beer to tie a perfect bow on your marvelous brunch."
"Meh/garbageWhen we were first reading our menus I overheard someone complaining about their meal at a table near us.  At the time, I was embarrassed for them.  Turns out, we should have listened and left. We were really looking forward to eating at the Gage... Up until this point, our meals had been fabulous (publican, purple pig, bandera, Lou malnottis, etc).  Sadly, this choice turned out to be a colossal disappointment.  When we left, it felt as though we'd lost $150.00 in Vegas.  We had the escargot, the asparagus and morels, the fluke (appropriately named), and the tofu.  All were underwhelming, to put it nicely.  The food lacked flavor and was bland and boring. We both found ourselves to try to compensate by adding salt and pepper.  No luck though.  At the end of the meal we were laughing at how remarkably bad it all was.  The wine was delicious.  The server was fine except she was the person who recommended the fluke dish. Perhaps their meat dishes are better?  With all the great restaurants in Chicago, it sucked that we managed to pick a bad one."
When i tried around 12  to make a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday it was booked so we walked in at 5:15 and got a table. The staff treated us very well and when our starter was late they apologized and compensated us very generously. The food was delicious and creative and the drinks were very well crafted. Great experience.
Quality bar facing the park that somehows manages to avoid the tourist crowd.  The Gage is a great option for suit-and-tie happy hour or for pre/post theater apps and drinks.
"My husband and I were in town for a conference and checked out Yelp for recommendations. We were not disappointed with Gage! We were seated immediately and service was wonderful. We enjoyed the scotch egg, the beet salad, fish and chips, and venison burger. Everything was fresh and delicious. And the price was very reasonable compared to what I would expect in downtown Chicago."
I brought a friend who lives and Japan and had a wonderful meal - both service and the food was superb!  Highly recommend.
"A friend told me I HAD to come here upon my arrival in Chicago. So, I went for dinner on Monday and it was delightful. So, I went back for lunch on Tuesday. Oh, yeah, it's that good. And somehow, even though it's kind of swanky, I find it charming, affordable and delicious. TIPS: Ask for their soup of the day! I've had it three times now, and each time it's innovative and delicious (i.e. venison chili,pureed cauliflower with crab, etc.) Also, be sure to inquire about their sandwich of the day at lunch time---I once heard of a porkbelly with soft shell crab....yep, that's real. If you're into mushrooms, try the wild mushroom sandwich...soo good. For Dessert, try a sampler of their sorbet--recently, they had whiskey sorbet and it rocked my world. The only thing here that I warn everyone against are the chicken livers. They just need to take it off the menu. Really.  Overall, The Gage is why I look for any reason to visit Chicago (it's not really hard); the service is excellent, the food delicious and intriguing, and the soap in the bathroom (I'm not kidding) is wonderful. I regularly use the restroom multiple times just so I can use it."
"Thanks Yelp...you helped me find a good dinner spot in ""The Loop.""  Based on many of the reviews, I wish I'd be able to check this place out for brunch/lunch...sounds awesome, and very affordable.I'm a gastro-pub whore.  I mean that in a good way, but it means I put out (my money) any time I'm near one.  There are a bunch of things on the menu I'd like to try, but I've had a rough few weekends wallet-wise, so I eased up tonight and only tried a few things; that being said...I went for the Vindaloo mussels followed by chicken livers.  Weird, right?  I agree.  The mussels...to quote a teenage girl, omfg, they're good.  Get them.  Immediately.  Best mussels, flavor-wise, I've had...ever.  To be fair though, you could have dunked chunks of cardboard in that sauce and I would have eaten it like a fat kid on a cupcake.  Regarding the chicken livers; turns out I just don't really care for 'em all that much.  Flavor-wise & execution they were good, just too ""liver-y"" for my liking..but that's not their fault.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars...service at the bar wasn't amazing, and sliiightly pricy.  Not bad service, but, I've become pickier about the service in my old age, and I'd like to see prices ~15% less expensive then they are.  Would I go back? Hell's yeah."
"This place is amazing. We had the mussels vindaloo, which were enormous and excellent, the venison carpaccio, the venison burger, and the peanut butter pie. We loved all of it!  They even split the burger in half for us and gave us each our own portion of fries.  Our waiter Wes was very knowledgeable and friendly and answered all of our questions, of which there were many.  We will definitely be back to try the Elk!"
"This place is less conducive to sharing than some of the other gastropubs, but I really enjoyed it. I got the highly recommended venison burger, which was delicious. Even the chicken (what makes a chicken Amish?) was very well done. Their mashed potatoes are creamy goodness. The seasonal Noel beer they have on the menu right now is perfection and I suggest you go soon to try it!"
"Had the peppered hanger steak, smoked salmon blt, and a side of Brussels sprouts with smoked pork belly...everything was delicious and the sandwich was huge! The capers were a great touch on the smoked salmon blt and the peppered hanger steak was fantastic. Also, great beer selection and cute atmosphere! great experience over all"
"For the most part, the food was good. Stay away from the brussel sprouts--very bitter."
"Despite my first attempt to try the Gage, which was a failure, I've been a handful of times since. The food has always been great and I've enjoyed exploring their beer list."
"Love this place! If you live in the city or are a visiting tourist, I absolutely suggest checking it out - ask for the server named Stephen, he is awesome! We were a table of three girls and he tailored his drink and food suggestions to exactly what we were each looking for.The atmosphere is great - it's full of people and has a great decor, but isn't jam packed so that it's uncomfortable. It's like an upscale version of a great Chicago pub with great food. Come for drinks after work or a great meal. The scallops are amazing!"
"Food: 2Decor: 2Service: 3I came here with three friends for dinner around 8pm after walking around Grant Park. We made a reservation on Opentable a few earlier beforehand.1. Octopus  yelp.com/biz_photos/vvhf…Disappointing. Octopus was too tough, chewy, and bland, greens were yellow, and the entire dish just failed to come together.2. Duck yelp.com/biz_photos/vvhf…Not bad. Duck was cooked well, especially the piece of leg confit. However, the apricot sauce was way too sweet, and it didn't complement the dish well at all. Greens were overly bitter.Service was mediocre. Server didn't get our orders after bringing drinks, and he just disappeared.Total was about $65 after tax/tip. Needless to say, it wasn't worth it at all."
"Some things in life are a treat. -getting a weekend pass to the South Asian Film Festival -getting to go with arguably the handsomest man in all of Chicago -having lunch at The Gage Because we were out and about in the loop for the whole weekend, watching Indian films, we knew we'd have to fuel our engines well. My uber attractive partner in crime for the weekend casually suggested The Gage. I'd never heard of it before. When I found out it was on Michigan Avenue, I cringed a little. I was imagining hoards of hungry tourists a la Applebees. Boy was I wrong. I ordered something simple. A burger and fries. I was delighted when I sat down that the waiter brought out a wine/beer menu and a basket of freshly baked bread and home made butter. I ordered a pumpkin flavored seasonal beer - it was fall after all. Then the food arrived. A fresh baked bun for the burger?? WOW! A huge dill pickle spear, and hand cut fries. My dining companion had a duck sausage - which was served like a hot dog on a freshly baked long roll. We splurged and also got the goat cheese grits. For real. They were just as delish and decadent as they sound. All of this was served in a restaurant with such ambiance that even I was impressed. White cloth napkins, silver ware with a nice heft, and heavy wooden tables. Despite the fact that the table behind us was a cougar birthday party...it was wonderful. The funny part was when the waiter brought out a bottle of wine for the cougars. The people dining next to us said ""Oh Great. They are going to get louder!"" and we all had a good laugh. Definitely a great place to have lunch - or bring out of town guests. The menu was unexpected - and I was pleased to have eaten there. Check it out! Its a great experience."
"I absolutely love this place! I haven't had a dish that I didn't like. Their fondue is delish :-), and the pea soup is yummy. Lastly the atmosphere is just so inviting & cozy. I would recommend the Gage for  lunch, dinner, and even a date."
"All about the Venison Burger! It's one of the best burgers I've ever had, AND it's one of the few reasonably affordable items on the menu ($17). The service here is very very good (as it should be) and the atmosphere is classy and romantic, if that's what you're looking for."
"An ultrachic gastropub a few short steps from Chicago's famous Art Institute.  I had the fish n chips that were deep fried to perfection.  I am anxious to go back.  The service was very friendly and helpful.  It is hard for me to say more since I only had one dish here.  I do know that it is the type of clean, and modern pub that I like to visit.  Chicago baby!"
"The Gage is ok, but let's say this...during Happy Hour it's a madhouse of the seen-and-be seen kinda crowd.  The drink list is good and the beer I had was cold, but the 20 minute wait to get to the bar and place my order was less than stellar.I've been to dinner here and had food at the bar as well and while it was fairly tasty...I think the menu tries way too hard to be different and misses the mark.  The one thing I did absolutely love was the bathroom soap and lotion...I even went back to find out what it was and buy it.  I know...that's kinda strange, but it smells amazing!  The bar is pretty and the place is clean and nice, and I probably would go there again, but it wouldn't be my first choice at all!"
"We loved the food. The waiter was  a bit domineering but we decided to place ourselves under his wing and it turned out to be a good decision--he clearly understood the food and made great suggestions.  I agree that the Mussels Vindaloo alone were worth the trip!  Duck was amazing. No room for dessert so cannot report on that.Five stars for food and service (very accommodating about changing our reservation and party size).  Four stars because of the noise level, but I guess that is par for the course in modern restaurants. Wish some restaurants could figure out how to address this.  Would love to go back whenever I get back to Chicago."
"The verdict is: I'll still attest to the greatness that is the Gage. Last night, I had the opportunity to cover more culinary ground than on my last three visits combined. We had:Scotch egg: A-. Well done, big and beautiful! I especially liked the coarse mustard as a compliment to the yolk. And pork? Bravo. Chips: A. Classic Irish fries with curry gravy. The fries are perfectly golden with a nice crispy yet chewy inside. And the curry was a standout. Caramelized lobster. C+. Surprisingly, my least favorite of our appetizers. There just wasn't a whole lot of flavor to this particular dish... guess I was expecting more.Goat: A. I'm a huge fan. It's not listed on their website menu, but you'll see it under first or second courses on the printed menu when in the restaurant. The meat has a really rich taste despite being low fat. Who knew? And The Gage sources their goat from a very well-respected farmer (wish I remembered the name).Also, I should mention I was really set on trying the glorious poutine but our server had other plans for us. Though our service was top notch and very involved, I was a bit turned off by the pushiness (i.e. we don't want a bottle of wine, so please don't go ahead and order it for us, okay?). What I did want to drink, however, was two different pints of pumpkin beer (both on draught). One was by Dogfish and the other was so new it hadn't made the menu yet.For my main course, I had 'The Gage' burger. Though the Gage has a plethora of beautiful offerings (Elk! Locally crafted sausages! Gunthorp Farms pork chop!), I had a huge craving for beef and knew I wouldn't be disappointed. I ordered it medium rare which I hardly ever do, but knew I could here. It was cooked to my exact specifications (extra, extra juicy) and topped with local Camembert and melted onion marmalade. Brilliant combination! In fact, I liked my burger so much that I ate the whole thing (which, isn't easy). The only regrettable part of my meal was stuffing myself beyond pain!We finished with a trio of their most popular desserts: lemon creme brulee, the fried cherry pie and the chocolate terrine. Though admittedly not a 'chocolate person', this one shined and wowed all around.You can always count on the Gage for an elegant, spirited experience in a more 'corporate' area of downtown. Good to have you here!"
"Have been to The Gage twice now - once for lunch and once for a company-wide dinner - and both instances were fantastic.Last night's meal consisted of many appetizers (the plump and juicy mussels, spicy scotch egg, melt-in-your-mouth caramelized lobster with quinoa, seared fair haven scallops, and Michigan-farmed braised goat) and a smattering of entrees - from the lamb to the tuna to the fish and chips to the halibut. Wine (a cabernet sauv from Napa) paired nicely with our various mains; Green Line pale ale won over the Brits; and dessert - beignets, beignets, beignets - capped off a lovely meal. Will be back - and maybe next time we'll finish our Gage tour with brunch."
"John and I had a wonderful late lunch al fresco. The chicken noddle soup is highly recommended- and the fresh bread is the best!I had a really well made chicken salad- cashew nut, blueberry, strawberry- very fresh greens.I have never had a dessert like their yogurt/pineapple  dessert-  there is a real chef working here who knows about taste and presentation.We were totally surprised that this place right on Michigan Ave (tourist alert!) had such food.And a shout out to our very nice waitress, Michelle, who only added to our enjoyment of our meal."
"Definitely a cool space with good food, but not sure if I would call the Gage a ""gastropub.""  The space is enormous (Seats 300), and the long bar is a great place to hang out and nosh.  The menu does have some more refined dishes such as a sea bass special and elk, but also some pub favorites like scotch eggs, fish and chips, steak, and a delicious burger (definitely splurge on the Prime version).  They even have poutine, in a nod to Canada's contribution to the culinary world, although I would have liked to see more cheese in the gravy mix.  As for drinks, there is definitely an expanded selection of beers and cocktail, although only 6-8 on draft.  They did have Stone IPA in bottles, but my fave was the Brown Ale by Bell's.   The dining area is a bit more quiet but I really liked the energy of the bar. The Gage is sort of in a category of its own, and does very well there!"
"This place had an interesting menu... different than a ton of other pubs and burger places within the city.  I got the Venison burger, just know that it was savory and really juicy.  They also have other ""game-y"" items on the menu, so be prepared to have  a potentially different entree that will fulfill your tastebuds.Also, the venue is really cool, a bunch of TVs and a long bar, but still trendy enough to be a really cool place.Just be prepared, because the prices are not cheap!"
"Recently ate lunch at Gage.The decor and ambiance was fantastic. Beer list was good. Very unique beers available on draft. The food was really good. Very interesting take on the beef brisket ""sandwich"". Wasn't much like a sandwich but the food was still enjoyable. I would recommend Gage if in the Loop or are near the Art Institute."
Yummy....get the brussel sprouts with brie and the golden beet salad with goat cheese!
Awesome food! Great atmosphere. Right across from millennium park. Nice place to go after seeing a show or if you're on a date. Pretty expensive though.
"Atmosphere:   5 starsSevice:  3 starsFood:  3.5 starsNice modern gastro-pub with a great atmosphere.  Great for happy hour, meeting friends for drinks, a group outing, or even an informal date.The service however was sub-par.  Either the server we had was new or just lacked confidence.  Know the menu or go work somewhere you can keep track of what it is the restaurant specializes in.They've got a good selection of beers and scotch too...big plus!Would come again just to kick it...not necessarily for the food."
"I've been here a few times in the past month for both lunch and brunch and I'm a huge fan. It has a great location across from Millenium Park and their service is really on top of things.Mussels are some of the best mussels I've had. Really meaty and hearty curry sauce.Burgers are very solid. Duck Confit with Grits and Eggs - yes please. Ordered with a size of organic greens (I got watercress) with Duck and it was a great sideNice bar area for happy hour, too!"
"I came here on Saturday for lunch with friends. The service was great! Our waitress was so helpful and friendly. I had the mushroom/truffle sandwich which was delicious but very messy (maybe they shouldn't slice the bread all the way through). My husband had the poutine and the special of the day  (pork belly open face sandwich). Everyone loved their food and the beer selection was great. This is a great spot to stop by if you're walking around millenium park. Although my mushroom sandwich was very tasty, I think the best mushroom sandwich I have had so far was probably the mushroom sandwich at Xoco!"
"The Gage is a perfect place in Chicago - perfect for location to bring out of town guests and clients and perfect to meet friends for happy hour or a fun week night dinner.  My last meal here was so fabulous.  It was a deconstructed steak salad with watermelon, nuts and greens.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the watermelon complemented it perfectly.  We started with the stuffed peppers.  They were mini sweet peppers in red sauce ... so fab!"
"When we walked in, we had just came from the park and Museum from across the street so we weren't exactly dressed to impressed when we strolled in. The crowd was to our liking although we felt under-dressed. It gets very loud and crowded around 5-7pm on Saturdays but the ambiance is great. Just went there for some drinks and an app. Had the fried pickles which were good, not too greasy. overall we had a good experience there. I would come back when I visit Chicago again."
"Craving the best burger in Chicago, my friend and I hoofed it over to the Gage for dinner. The vibe here is trendy cool with dim lighting and comfy seats. It looks like a pretty popular place to get a drink after work, but I could not be deterred. I was here for a burger!Since my friend is Canadian, we split the poutine fries. They were so delicious, we scraped the bottom of the plate for more of the vegetable stew gravy and wild boar. We both ordered the Gage burger which may have been the best burger I've ever eaten. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly! Try it. You won't be disappointed!"
I LOVE this place.  My wife and I cant get enough of the Vindaloo curry mussels and Bison (or antelope) Tartare.  Our server Nicole was amazing and made sure our anniversary was special.  Looking forward to my next visit.
"A little bit overrated for its food.  No doubt it's a fancy dancy nice decor resto, good vibe and ambience w/ its long bar and all, but here's what we ordered:Fish and Chips, recommended by server.  Good, but not great compared to some of the stuff back home on the pier. A bit dry, and served wrapped in a cone, but w/ newspaper--the ink! yuck...Fries were nothing special.But the roasted duck was nice and tender, with tasty cranberry gravy mixed sauce.  And the grapefruit soda also recommended for its freshness.But for the value, $75 including tip, nah....guess one's paying for the location."
"Great food is a given at a restaurant of this caliber. The duck breast was perfectly cooked and o-so-juicy, and the scallops so sweet, and everything seasoned so perfectly, not too overpowering, but just enough to complement each ingredient. But no...as delightful as each dish was, the food wasn't the highlight of the night...it was the attentive service and the desire to please perfectly, that added that sixth flavor to each dish.Each dish was served in an orchestrated manner reminescent of a michelin rated establishment....but one dish was missing...the server offered to remove the delicious duck breast from the bill. The manager, Tim, stopped by to apologize personally and offered a variety of desserts, on the house. It's easy to do this as a formality, but I felt genuinely cared for.I don't live in Chicago, but I'd wholeheartedly recommend the Gage to anyone who visits. If this were the only restaurant I visited while in Chicago, I would have been more than satisfied."
"The Gage probably had one of the most extensively boring menus I've seen in a long time, for the prices they were charging. None of the higher priced menu items seemed very interesting, and it didn't seem worth the money. I finally settled on Today's Fish and Chips.Deemed ""today's"", because the Fish and Chips are wrapped in ""today's"" newspaper, these strips of fluffy fried fish were pretty well done.  I don't think Guiness in the batter comes out very well, and the fries were pretty standard.I get it, the Gage is convenient for tourists staying at the Hard Rock Hotel, or visiting Millenium Park. However, I don't see the draw for locals to go to Gage. There are a lot of places that charge similar or cheaper prices for food that are much more inventive. With the exception of the pretty well stocked bar, I don't see a reason to visit the Gage."
good burger
"I think anything taste good when you are STARVING! But the food here did more than satisfy deep hunger!Kinda trendy, kinda old fashion this joint is cute either way :)I got the hanger steak salad which was delicous; steak was cooked the way  I like it and the salad was perfectly dressed. Not too much not too little. I tried my friend's scallop dish and it was like BUTTER..... actually better than butter. Scallops perfectly tender and juicy which were cut by pickeled onions! mmmhhhh !!!Unfortately I was so focused on the meal, I complete forgot about pictures! :(    .... STILL, come to gage, eat with friends and get some drinks; garaunteed you'll have a good time :)"
"I wish this place were just a little closer to my work so I could go more often. After hearing people talk about it forever I finally went for lunch. We started with fried pickles and squash with came with a great chipotle sauce. Probably the best tasting fried pickles I've ever had. Then I had the fish special for the day which was sea bass over a bed of barley and morel mushrooms with a venison broth. Um, heaven!!!!! I scavenge Chicago for morels this time of the year, and combined with sea bass they were great. The sea bass also came with perfect crispy skin. Such a treat! I like The Gage better than Henri (owned by the same chef) simply because I do not feel wealthy or snooty enough for Henri! The Gage is much more relaxed and I would love to go back."
"The Gage is a ""go to"" place when seeking out a dinner location following a day at the Chicago Art Institute. A hip, somewhat loud venue, The Gage offers unique cuisine within the small plates genre. Service was solid yet somewhat aloof. Here was the evening:StarterBasil Escargot Goat Cheese Fonduta, Hazelnut Crunch. A fairly uneventful dish, but not terrible. The hazelnut crunch was mild and I didn't taste the basil. The escargot was cooked perfectly.MainMaple Leaf Farms Duck Roasted Breast and Confit Black Pudding Hash, Black Pepper Reduction A boring dish with the duck being slightly on the tougher side. Nothing offensive, but a bit lackluster. Flavors were mild.SideCauliflower GratineeNot sure I needed this side, but the server did say the plates were somewhat ""small"". The dish contained a few different types of cauliflower, which made it interesting. A basic dish.With prices being reasonable, service being decent and flavors being average this is a restaurant that is A-OK in my books. Something worth trying!Good luck."
Fish & chips
"I visited here with a very large group and when you are in a large group, it sometimes is hard for the service staff to provide a great experience, so I'm giving the place 3 stars based on the experience.  Perhaps a smaller party would rate it up a bit, but calling it based on what I saw.The place itself is NOT that big and when people say it has a lot of energy, that is code for it's LOUD and you can hardly hear anything anyone is saying, unless you are sitting right next to them.  If you are into that scene - you'll be right at home.  I think energy can come from something other than everyone screaming to be heard, but that's just me.Let's talk a little about the food - Big group - someone else is paying, means let's order ALL the appetizers!  Yeah!  Well they have some odd little items on the menu like Scotch Eggs - never heard of that, but think hard boiled egg with some type of crust on the outside and a mustard dipping sauce - works for me.  Deep Fried pickle slices.  These were my favorite...just those little pickles, but what can't you deep fry anymore? Pate Board - ehh - not a fan.  Cheese was tasty.Salad - I had the beet salad - several color beets (not just red!) and this was really nice switch to typical greens for a starter.  Served with Goat Cheese and Honey Comb?  Not sure what that was, but it was good whatever it was.Entree - The place is kind of ""pub"" style restaurant with Burgers but these are Venison burgers ($17) and instead of steak you can get ""Saddle of Elk"" - I tried a bite if this, really well prepared - like a steak, but with a twist of game taste, not much, but enough to make it interesting.I had the Fish and Chips - served in a little cone type cup - 3 really big pieces - could not eat them all - but they were decent.  I'm from the Pacific Northwest and I know my Fish and Chips, so these are good - not great.Dessert - I had a single scoop of the Salted Caramel Ice Cream - nice - they also had some funky time of the season desserts with caramel corn and popcorn flavored ice cream that certainly sounded maybe a little more creative than it actually looked on arrival.  If you don't mind the noise - and have a hankering to burn through some high-end Pub fare - give it a go."
"Great atmosphere. One of the best halibut dishes I have had. Compliments to the chef!  Chill, hip scene with some Irish decor influence.  Needless to say, the Guinness draft was poured and served to perfection. It was just the right temperature, which you don't get very often.  The color changing lights every 20 seconds at the bar was a bit of a distraction.  Hopefully, they can slow it down to a 10 minute rotation.  If you are visiting downtown Chicago downtown, you must put this place on your to do list."
This is a must visit for tourists and a good go to place for the locals.  I normally don't go for exotic sounding food but have fallen in love with the Bambi Burger. OK - they call it a reindeer burger.  Totally delicious! The poutine is pretty good too and neither are common menu items in Chicago.
"I have been here three times for dinner.  I have always found the food to be perfectly prepared and very tasty.  The reason why I can't give it four stars is due to the waiter we had when we sat on the patio.  I would really like to describe him so management can train him better.  However, I am not sure how to do so without seeming like a total beotch.The waiters we have had on the other two occasions were wonderful.  Attentive, unobtrusive, knowledgeable and friendly.  This guy we just had had an off-hand, almost insulting manner and did not know his menu at all.  He didn't know the provenance of the cheese and had to read them off a paper (after sighing audibly when I asked what they were).  He also didn't offer bread or a dessert menu. He was rude.  He reached across my face-- literally right under my nose-- as I was taking a bite so that he could clear the table.  He was slow and was so busy flirting with the men at the next table he really made it obvious whom he assumed would leave the better tip. Too bad for him.  He was right about that tip in the end."
"I don't eat a lot of fried foods, but there's a special place in my heart for good Fish and Chips.  At Gage you will find that it is about as good as it gets!  They use vodka in the batter so it evaporates faster when cooked locking in the juices and giving your the crispiest coated, moistest and tenderest cod fish ever.  Fries are crispy and yummy.  I also tried the Gage Fondue which was really good.  If I didn't know it was a gazillion calories I would have eaten the whole thing.  Finally, the service and management of the restaurant is excellent.  At least 3 times a manager came to me during the meal to say hello and ask how I was doing.  My waitress was always there when I needed her."
"Came here for brunch after the Shamrock Shuffle with my friends. Although in sweaty clothes, I didn't feel out of place at brunch - but later in the day I would probably want to change clothes.Excellent strong coffee! Great unique beer menu. Corned Beef Hash = yum. You must get the scotched egg - it was so delicious, especially with the coarse ground mustard! Roasted potatoes were the highlight of my meal. Everything had wonderful flavor and I was happy to taste that they aren't afraid of spices and seasonings.Waitress was a little absent minded but it was busy so I can see that she was a bit forgetful. I'll definitely be back for brunch and try out their dinner!"
"Awesome!Sums it up, one of the best pubs in the city. Right across from the Park, great service and stellar food"
"Why doesn't Yelp allow for half stars?  The Gage deserves 3.5 stars but that wasn't an option so I decided to be generous and round up to four  The Gage's selling point is that it's one of the only decent dining options in this part of downtown.  It has a diverse, upscale pub menu with a great beer selection.  The fondue appetizer is spectacular - definitely five stars - but then again when isn't cheese 5 stars?  Unfortunately, I've eaten here numerous times and all of the entrees, except for the 4-star buffalo chicken sandwich, are just so-so.  The pork belly sandwich sounds enticing but in reality was too thick to eat eloquently over a business lunch - and was way too salty (and the refills too slow).  The steak on the steak salad was excellent, but the rest of the salad was too bitter and quite bland. If you stick the fondue appetizer and chicken sandwich, you could walk away like I did on my first visit, raving about a 4.5 star experience in a 1 star part of town.  Unfortunately, visits 2 and 3 have left me questioning whether the restaurant really lives up to its hype or just benefits from being surrounded by mediocrity."
"So, everything in Downtown Chicago closes really early? My husband and I were visiting Chicago from LA and did not realize that if we waited to eat dinner until 9:30 pm, we'd be in major trouble. THE GAGE TO THE RESCUE. Stumbled upon it because it seemed to be the only thing still open, have never been happier with an accidental discovery. The food was amazing, the vibe is great - but I'm writing this review because we had, hands down, the best waiter I have ever had in my life. This guy was the pro to end all pros. Dear waiter who served me & my husband two venison burgers at 10 pm a week ago, please never leave your job. You made our experience fantastic. You are a diamond in an industry of coal."
"Great ambiance, lively bar, local gathering place. But eclectic menu is more form than substance. Go there for the atmosphere but not the food."
"I should start out by saying that I love gastropubs, and this is definitely that. Decided to stop in and ordered Fish & Chips as well as the Brisket sandwich dish. Both were solid. The Fish & Chips were amazing. They are battered in Guinness and the fish isn't TOO fried, which was perfect. SOme of the other things on the menu looked good, but i think it's safe to say that most regulars agree that the Fish & Chips cannot be beat."
"Great restaurant, and just two blocks from Symphony Center if you are going down for a performance!  We went on a Saturday around 6:00, and the service was fantastic. Our waitress was prompt, helpful, and brought us our check as soon as our meals came so that we could get to the 8:00 show on time. As far as atmosphere, it's clearly party in the front, business in the back. The bar was lively and full of people, dressed casually or formally, and the dinner crowd was in the back where it was more subdued but not by any means quiet. We started with a couple cocktails which were fantastic, as well as the fondue starter. It was great, but our complimentary bread came at the same time as the fondue, which was a little disappointing...by the time the bread came, we didn't really want it because we already had the fondue. Still, the fondue was delicious, and I ordered the cream of cauliflower soup while my boyfriend got the cesar salad. Speaking for the soup, it was fantastic, with chucks of delicious bacon and crispy, garlicky croutons. For an entree I ordered the chicken, which is actually two pieces of chicken sausage and then a couple legs surrounded by dumplings and gravy. I really enjoyed the chicken sausages--they were delicious and a nice twist to your usual ""amish chicken"" listing on a menu. The dumplings were a little dry, but the sauce complimented them well. Overall, great experience!"
"Still going downhill.  So went there yesterday with two coworker, all three of us have frequented often.  We got there around 5:15 and one person was meeting us so we were getting a drink at the bar while we waited.  So I went up to the hostess stand and said we'd like a table once the third arrived and they asked about how long and I said about 20 minutes and they said that should be fine.  They had plenty of tables available.  She got there at 5:40 so I went back up and she said now it's an hour wait.  So in 20 minutes it had suddenly been an hour wait?  She was very rude about it too.  So I asked what she had done when I came up 20 minutes ago (obviously the entire point was so that we can sit right away when she arrived) and she said well then we weren't taking names but now we are...WTF?  All three of us were regular patrons that will not likely return any time soon."
"I had been here a few times for business lunches and once or twice for dinners.  This review for for last week when I took my dad and step mom here.  For me I think its reasonably priced for what you get.  My dad looked a little nervous :-)  We were at a booth in the bar area which in hindsight I should have asked to be moved to the back.  The bar area is super noisy.  So talking to my dad who's in his 70's was impossible.  At first glance my dad commented that if I don't get the tofu (he pronounces it too-foo and I correct him every time) then I'm not eating but really there are options for non-meat eaters.  I had the special pasta which was made with peas and carrots.  Super yummy.  I also had a Moscow Mule which was good.  My boyfriend had the rabbit salad.  It seemed to be 99.9% arugula with just a whisper of rabbit.  Not worth it.  We got the chocolate dessert which made up for any downfalls.  It was so rich and chocolatey and good!!!!  Do not miss.  Also we got coffees since we were headed to the CSO.  My dad was crazy for the coffee.  That's a high accolade since he usually says that coffee is ""too acidic"" from sitting around too long.I will be back and if Dad is with us we will be sitting in the back."
Have the Venison Burger!!  This is a lunch must have!  I've had many attempts at burgers but this can only be described as an experience!!
"This was an email that I sent to The Gage and never heard a response:  I was contemplating either sending an email, calling or posting on Yelp about my experience last night at your restaurant.  I chose to email as I am still in shock and disgust over my ruined birthday dinner.  Today is my birthday, so last night a friend from the suburbs happened to be in the city for business meetings so she took me out to dinner to a place I have been wanting to try for ages, The Gage.  We had reservations and everything was going well until....a man came over to our table looked at us, didn't speak and left.  Then a female friend of his came over and spoke to us, prefacing what she was about to ask, by saying ""you are going to think I am rude, but...."".  Looking back, I should have just stopped her there, but I was taken aback.  She then went on to explain that they were a large party and just waiting for our table to clear so they could sit, ""how much longer do you think you will be?"".    My friend and I were shocked.  I am 46 years old today and have worked in restaurants (age 20 - 24) and eaten in restaurants all over the world - NEVER has something like that happened in a ""decent"" restaurant.  I understand at bars when you see someone leaving a table, you stand around it until they leave because there aren't reservations and they are first come.  The host and manager came over to apologize but still my friend and I were very uncomfortable finishing our wine and conversing as the offending party was standing about 5 feet away from us - looking at us, etc...The final kicker - when we did finish up, pay and leave - they had the audacity to applaud.  I left feeling awful after my birthday ""celebration"".  I wanted to go back and say something but really there was nothing to say except some people are just horrible.  I will have to say that this absolutely overshadowed any enjoyment from the food and drink of The Gage and for that I am sorry because as I said in the beginning, I had wanted to try The Gage for ages.  I am fortunate enough to be going to a few more birthday celebrations which will hopefully be far better experiences and leave me feeling as good as I can about turning 46. Best Regards, Holly"
"I went for lunch with high expectations and left disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, the meals everyone had (a variety across the menu with a big group) were all solid but not great. Still solid but not 4 stars good at all."
"This is a wonderful place to enjoy a leisurely meal after visiting the Art Institute down the street.  The first museum visit, we all just had cocktails, and I am now addicted to the Capone.  Great selection of beers too.  The decor is warm, all dark wood, subway tiles, sleek but in a cosy way, and it was really comfy up at the bar.  They're also very courteous to everyone regardless of whether they're in tourist-wear or business suit.  I was so impressed I vowed to return soon.Fast forward one week and 3 other bars later, all serving a similar ""cucumber"" drink.  NOT the same, cucumber juice is just not the same as mashed cucumber.  Best at the Gage!  So, dying for another Capone, I raced back today with my girlfriend in tow after another day at the museum.Picked outdoor seating, very pleasant, very friendly service.  Very good food.  We both started with the soup, a chilled bosc pear soup - heavenly.  Just heavenly.  I got the special - a corned beef sandwich on pumpernickel, which was excellent.  My girlfriend got the brisket, which was a big open-faced sandwich piled with arugula.  I didn't love it, but I think it was personal preference - I'm not hot on braised brisket to begin with.  Girlfriend loved it, so there ya go.The clouds were starting to roll in, and a few drops were falling, so we skipped dessert, which I will absolutely remedy the next time I go.  Very soon.  One cocktail, soup, main and tip was $45 each.  There's a great $13 value of cup of soup and half sandwich if cost is a factor.Highly recommended."
"Went here for lunch and had a very good meal.The venison burger was good, steak sandwhich was better, and the roasted corn side was the best.  It is a little pricey for lunch as two entrees, two beers, and a side of corn was $72 with tip and tax but you are downtown on Michigan Ave, so can't really complain.  I recommened the Gage and looking to come back and try dinner sometime."
Loved their rendition of corned beef hash.  A little on the pricey side but ok for the occasional splurge!
"I'm clearly reiterating the comments of my fellow yelpers - but this is one of my Go-To spots in the area.  There's always a good crowd (particularly on Thursdays after work), the staff is always friendly and accommodating, a wonderful respite to eat outdoors on Michigan Avenue -- and, across every visit, the food was fantastic - for the carnivore and the vegetarian (Spring pea agnolotti...) - WOW.Go to the Gage."
"This review is long overdue. The venison burger is fantastic. Everything about it is delicious and every time, I am sad when it is over. The atmosphere is great for an after work dinner or happy hour and I've always had great service. I am looking forward to my next visit and dreaming of that burger."
"Conveniently located a few blocks from our hotel and millenium park, we decided to dine here for lunch because we missed our brunch reservation that Sunday. Very nice restaurant with very pleasant staff; our server was far beyond sweet (Indian young woman, I think). Not sure how I felt about the paper sheet covering our tablecloth (somewhat tacky I thought, but hey, I'm just knit picking at this point).Not much to say other than the food and service was superb (coffee and water always filled to the brim without ever noticing); everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My group and I were extremely satisfied with our choices which consisted of scallops, lamb curry over rice, fish and chips and the hanger steak salad. All worth ordering. The scallops (my favorite thing to order) was nicely charred and delicious, a must get!Worth coming for lunch! Can't speak for brunch or dinner, but if I was still in the area I would most definitely venture back."
"Well, what can I say I was highly impressed by my experience at the Gage.We had an early dinner reservation via open table so the dining area was still quiet during our meal time which probably augmented the experience.The service was impeccable from beginning to end: attentionate, prompt, patient waiter taking the time to answer all our questions, providing recommendations. The highlight of the night was absolutely the food and I enjoyed every bite of my meal.The toughest part was actually choosing what to order since there were so many unusual dishes on the menu we were dying to try.After placing our orders, we literally sit back and enjoyed the experience and it truly felt we were on a 5 stars food safari without leaving Chicago. Everything was exquisite and the flavors were so delicate. The highlights: 1) Bone in fillet: flavorful, melting in the mouth, succulent; 2) smoked antelope tartare: really interesting combination of flavors and texture, a must try; 3) eye of tuna: top quality with a perfect blend of vegetables and chimichurri, a delight; 4) no dinner is perfect without a chocolate oriented dessert, again perfect way to end the meal, perfectly sized chocolate mousse cake with an extraordinary smoked flavor sorbet.Basically I can't wait to go back and let my palate be surprised by the other concoctions the Gage's chef is executing.The Gage is a must stop when in Chicago."
"I was here for brunch this weekend. I tried the pear french toast, it was good. I was impressed, again, by the service and atmosphere. Such a relaxing brunch, as opposed to other rather loud brunch places."
Burgers are the best!
"One of the best places to meet up with friends from out of town for a drink or a meal.  You can't go wrong with the selections on the menu, and the big leather booths are so comfy you want to stay and chat for hours.  The sandwiches are knife and fork style with delectable ingredients that are inventive and tasty.The ambiance has a historic, yet kind of trendy feel to it that lends well to an add'on visit to the art institute or stroll through the park."
"I feel pretty comfortable claiming The Gage as pretty pretentious. These servers need to learn how to smile or even grunt to communicate without the empty eyes expressions. And no, not only when the bill comes out and the tip salvaging measures are in effect. Then again, I might be a little dead inside too if my normal crowd was corporate warriors in khaki trying to erase the workday while simultaneously catch the eye of another wage slave cub or cougar. From the work desk to the dating den, the clientel in here is young (in some cases), professional and lookin' for love. Read the body language, believe me.The owner walks around in a suit checking on things. It's very obvious he's the owner and it's very obvious he's living well. He stopped by our table out of about twenty to comment on the traditional German beers we ordered and mentioned that we'd both be singing songs later. Everyone else just got a little head nod or a smile. I get the impression he's German. There's a private room downstairs where the restrooms are. Dinner waits are long so you can leave your name at the front and go hit the bar. If and when your table comes up (if you haven't already ordered in the bar) one of the long legged hostesses will come find you to ask if you're still interested in your table. No buzzers to be found, just old fashioned memory. Kind of cool.I had the burger and it was pretty awesome. Of course the beer was good as well."
"I typically avoid all areas ""tourist"" in this fine city, and I consider The Gage to be located at the Mecca of tourism, so one would think I'd hate it. But, one would be wrong. First, I have to say I'm really, really impressed with the decor of The Gage... it's classy & clean, yet it still has that great pub feel. Any place that has such beautiful bathrooms is high on my list. If the potties are that pretty, you know you're good to go.The food is excellent, and I'm very partial to the fish & chips here. It feels wrong to order anything else. A top-notch beer selection is also a good thing, and OH the desserts. Get one of each. You won't be disappointed. For the location, I find the prices to be spot-on, and you definitely get your dollar's worth."
"I went here for my friend's birthday the other night and had a GREAT time sitting in the bar area with our big group. I was a bit hungry after ice skating so I got the butternut squash soup, which was the soup du jour. It was phenomenal. Had just the right hint of curry, some chicken, and a bunch of other teeny additions on the top which kicked it up a notch! I also had a pour of the Yamazaki 12 year Japanese whiskey for the first time. Now I know it will be hard for me to order any other type. The bartender chatted with me for a bit about the whiskey and he said it was his favorite drink in the entire bar. I have to agree with him. The service was super attentive so we stayed for like 3 hours. I can't wait to go back to the Gage when I am near Millennium Park. It was such a treat!"
"I've been to The Gage three times now but have neglected to write a review. Tsk. Shame on me. But let me make amends now.Both the indoor and outdoor seating areas feel special. Last night I dined outdoors. The plants that surround the exterior dining area provide some privacy from the throngs of tourists on Michigan Ave. The interior is fairly simple and attractive.Service is always friendly from the hostesses right down to the bus boys. The waiters always have a recommendation for drinks or food. They are knowledgeable and efficient.The food is pretty darn good too. Last night I came here with a friend and we had the house cured salmon, which has smoked salmon (obviously), crème fraîche, cucumber, capers, caviar, and is served with caraway crackers. Yum. A fine choice for a hot Memorial Day Weekend outing. We also shared the mixed green salad with  cashews, smoked cheddar, apple, dried cherries and ginger vinaigrette. I want to eat this salad every single day! Further, we shared a burger. It was a smidge overcooked--we asked for med rare but got medium--but it was very good. Overall this was the perfect amount of food for two people. Add three glasses of prosecco plus two Moscow Mules and we were at about $108. I didn't have this last night (it felt too hot out for this item--but I highly recommend the Mussels Vindaloo. It may sound rather off-putting but I assure you this is pure deliciousness. I will order it again when the temperature is under 95 degrees.So overall, you can't lose by dining at The Gage. I'll definitely be back!"
"To be fair, I am not a connoisseur of fine dining."
"We recently went there for some apps and cocktails to njoy the nice weather. We order the 2 smallest and most expensive app ever.. nasty too... of course the beer and drinks are overpriced, why would they not right? please- rip off-I will say, i went there before and ordered a tuna melt, that was good.. service was OK. don't think i'd go back, it's prob better for meat lovers- not my game.. oh, and way $$$ for their food..."
"Everything was delicious.  Poutine & Cauliflower are great appetizers.  I was a little nervous to try the Venison burger because I'm not usually a fan of Venison, but it did not disappoint.  We had to zip out for a show, but next time will definitely stay for dessert & also maybe try to sit on their patio."
"It was pretty good , had to wait  a while for a table, but that was just how it was, just kind of noisy inside,"
"I hate to do this...I really do. There are so many good reviews. Mine just won't be part of the club....Following Yelp advice (don't worry, I won't hold it against ya, fellow Yelpers) which is almost NEVER wrong, we tried The Gage while in Chicago. I am gonna give it a big ""Meh""...that's all I can come up with. It's OK, but certainly not great. First of all, you feel like cattle in this place. We were literally having dinner with the people on either side of us! Nice people though :)As for the food, I was just left wanting more. I guess I consider myself a ""foodie"" or whatever, so I thought this was gonna be perfect for me. I had a burger, which was good, but on the whole it just wasn't anything special. Sorry Gage, you won't be getting a 2nd date...."
A staple for me. Such a great atmosphere & friendly service. Their food is always above par and their Scotch selection is quite expansive.
I've been here a few times and have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I think its a great lunch spot if you work in the south loop/loop area. You can get immediate seating at the bar or table hightops. Poutine is excellent. I love their fish and chips. Lobster roll isn't bad either. Need to spend more time their after work as they have a wide variety of craft beers (not the usual Green Line or Revolution crafts only - actual other selections).
"Totally underwhelmed by this place. I decided to take my mom out to lunch here based on the decent reviews. The interior decor was charming with celadon subway tiles, dark wood, and art deco-esque stylized fonts and logos. The waitstaff was unusually pretensious. Having just moved from NY after many years I have an unusually high tolerance for snootiness. I read the warnings in other reviews and didn't think too much about it. However, this restaurant topped the list of pretension I've experienced and undeserved - their food is NOT stellar. The food was greasy and so-so. We had the Gage burger, pastrami special, and pot o' tea. From the cold greeting at the door, to the awkward owner who struck up conversation with every guest except notably two separate tables of Asians. Wow!! He half-heartedly mumbled something to my mom and myself as if we would not be able to understand.The restaurant was not yet busy yet we were rushed. Our check was placed on the table mid meal and our waitress was cold as we got up. My mom is the sweetest woman, and I felt terrible taking her to such a charmless place where they define a hierarchy of customers. Imagine if the waitstaff genuinely smiled vs. being too cool for school."
"Just stopped in for a quick meal, but this place was super awesome and delicious. The burger is no joke, it's delicious! Great fries too. I had the scallops, they came with some perfect broccoli rabe and FRIED CHICKEN SKIN. Are you kidding me?? Amazing. Great beer selection, can't wait to come back for a full meal!!"
"Had dinner at The Gage last weekend while in Chicago for a weekend trip with my boyfriend. The food was average at best-- we had the poutine (average) and the peppers (average) to start followed by the venison burger (bland) and the duck (tough). But we were trying to enjoy ourselves, so after dinner we ordered some port.By the second to last sip of the port I had to spit it back out---there was SO much sediment in it. It wasn't just a tiny bit (normal) it was like there was a tablespoon of dirt at the bottom. Clearly, I had been served the bottom of the bottle (not acceptable).Here's the kicker- when I went to tell the waitress that they had poured me the bottom of the bottle SHE TRIED TO CONVINCE ME THAT IT WAS NORMAL. I understand that a little sediment is normal and to be expected sometimes...but this was actually like a tablespoon of sand in my drink. Maybe this is my pet peeve, but when a freaking adult makes a mistake at their job, all they need to do is APOLOGIZE and acknowledge the mistake. The waitress instead was like ""well i mean i could take it off your bill""--like that would be such an inconvenience for her. Overall, the food could have been MUCH better and then to be served a drink like that with such attitude is pretty much unacceptable. Do better."
"My sister and I stumbled onto this super-yummy restaurant on our first weekend trip to Chicago! We were making all the touristy rounds and had just finished touring the Art Institute when we found this place for bunch. It's definitely a tourist's delight! We had the duck confit cash and vegeterian eggs benedict which were both to die for! Not to mention the goat cheese grits were heaven in my mouth!If I ever go back to Chicago again, I want to go back for dinner."
"5 stars for the food...Please remember that the Gage is not a fine dining place. Its a noisy gastropub that serves yum food. Prompt and quick service. Loved every single item on the restaurant week menu. The bitter lettuce frisee salad, the risotto and the best part of the meal, the pecan fritters with vanilla ice cream on charred sugar, all tasted exquisite. The cocktails were refreshing and delicious. Definitely a place worth coming back to..."
"Fabulous Brunch! Went with the family last Sunday. Had the following:Scottish egg - The sausage was phenomenal. Soo juicy and garlicky. Perfectly fried. Totally rejuvenated by fascination with Scotish eggs.Irish Bacon - Duh..so good. I think they dry-age their bacon, or something like that. It tasted a little more cured than usual - a little saltier - in a good way.Bangers - Remarkably juicy, yet light. House-made, apparently. These people know their sh*t.Dutch Pancake w/bananas - I could eat this everyday and die happy. Soft, cinnamony  baked pancake. Dense, yet light. Basically, they took the perfect Dutch pancake and poured bananas foster on top. Twas a thing of beauty.Please open a pub in SF. Thanks!"
Excellent restaurant with prompt and friendly service.  Upscale decor without any pretension.  Mussels vindaloo are the best I have ever had.  House-made sausage plate is worth coming back for.
"Great location; it's right across from Millenium Park.  We met friends here for lunch on a Friday, after flying into O'Hare.  Lunch menu was reasonable with a variety of choices.  The balsamic vinegar chicken sandwich was very good.  Service was excellent.  Would recommend, especially for a relaxing lunch."
Had a great dinner this summer with a friend. The fish and chips was tasty.  Service was great.  Wine selection by the glass was good.
"The baby gem lettuces is so fresh, crisp and a perfect way to end a week-end full of eating heavy.  A tasty vegetarian option. The Jean Francios a fabulous sauvignon blanc to go with."
"This place is just perfect.The shrimp sandwich was awesome. The fish and chips were worth a ""wow!!"" We also ordered a mixed green salad and it was super yum yum.Maybe it was because of the sunny shiny weather on that Saturday morning. Everything just looked so delicious. The service was great. We were originally sitting directly under the sun. And then we asked to switch seats to this table in shade that just became available. And it was all taken care of within the next 5 minutes. And oh, this place serves Bloody Mary at brunch. Isn't it crazy awesome?"
Crowded and full of tourists!  If you want to sit outside you are forced to purchase food with your drinks. Inside the bar is packed and there is no room to walk. There is a generally rude attitude within the clientele when it comes to trying to get through the crowd to the bathroom.
"Sometimes there is such a thing as a free lunch...and boy was it tasty. When given a choice for her birthday lunch my co-worker/friend chose The Gage. Getting invited to tag along felt like I was the one getting the birthday present! The Gage is classy, lots of dark wood, charming little rooms full of tables, tablecloths and a charming Irishman at the front of the house who can speak a little French too (he made the birthday girl swoon)! Located right across from Millennium Park and the Art Institute it's a great spot to grab a bite; it won't be a cheap meal, but in my opinion it's worth it. I ordered the grilled albacore sandwich and the rest of our table ordered mussels, potatoes with brie, fish and chips, the regular burger, mixed lettuce salad and chicken and giant noodle soup. Everyone seemed very happy with their meals and the portions are very generous. Per my co-workers the fish and chips were very light and fresh. If you order the mussels bring your appetite, they give you enough for two; my friend shared some of her mussels with us and still couldn't make a sizable dent. The mussels were large and tasty, I loved them over the spicy vindaloo sauce.My sandwich, served with fries, was seared albacore with pickled onion, horseradish aioli, lettuce and green beans on a roll. It was quite good, but also quite messy. I think it would've been a lot easier to eat if they eased up on the lettuce; I also think the lettuce distracted from some of the other flavors. Service was attentive and friendly, we never wanted for a refill and our food came quickly. Lunch gets pretty busy so I would make reservations, unless you want to risk a wait. I can't wait to come back and try some other things. Now, I just have to find a way to convince another co-worker to do a birthday lunch, invite me and have it here!"
Excellent food and service again.  We enjoyed the fried chicken livers and tuna tartare (again).  Then the whitefish main for my wife and the lamb shank for me.  My lamb was excellent.  My dessert was crème brulee with mild but tasty ginger snaps and fruit - good not great.  This should be on your short list of good places near the Art Institute.  Be sure to be seated in the back room.  And listen to the recommendations of the waitstaff - they're really good.
"I love, love, love the Gage.  Nice atmosphere, good drink options, great location, and fabulous food.Loved the shrimp sandwich, burger, and scotch egg.  We even decided to splurge and share an amazing chocolate ganache cake....yumm.The Gage is fabulous and worth a visit!!!"
"Very popular place right across from Millenium Park.  I enjoyed a great lunch with 3 coworkers this week.  The soup and sandwich combo was fantastic - the celery root soup, fries and the spicy chicken sandwich were all tasty.  Our server was friendly and efficient...maybe rushed us a little bit at the end though.  The atmosphere is very nice too.  I visited the Gage a while ago one evening and it was packed.  A late lunch was definitely a little bit calmer."
"Decent. Not the best ever. Service was great, food was alright. Not much to write home about."
"AMAZING! Went here after Rock of Ages on Sunday. We ordered the venison carpaccio to share - soooo rare and delicious. The server recommended that we squeeze the grilled lemon over it before trying and so glad we did. The flavors were outstanding!  Our table of 4 agreed to each get something different so we could taste each others. The venison burger was yummy! I wish I could figure out their marinade / seasoning! The elk was heavenly! My hubby got that and I ate more than a taste of it because it was that good. The sausages were pork and venison, also very tasty, with a great smoky flavor. I had the mascarpone-leek ravioli in mushroom broth and it was really great. For dessert, we tried three things - the peanut butter french silk pie was to die for!! The banana bread sundae in the mason jar was also very good and we had the St Patrick's special chocolate cake, tasty. It was a great experience, the service was excellent and a great location to Millenium Park and Bank of America theater. Very pricy dinner, but well worth it for a special treat. Oh, and MAKE RESERVATIONS!"
"Well I have now been to The Gage multiple times.  I have experienced both more of the ""late night"" crowd and mood, as well as a Saturday brunch.  In each case the place was either already very busy, or filling up.  And in each case we were still immediately seated, and taken great care of from that moment on.  The Gage is in a very touristy location. Yet somehow I don't feel as annoyed as I normally would in a place so close to where everyone seems to be swarming.  It feels more like a haven within the chaos.  Their service is top notch, and the food and drink are as well.  My most recent visit involved a server by the name of Kevin; a very hospitable and charming ginger haired lad, who was ready to make sure anything we wanted would be taken care of.  He went ABOVE AND BEYOND after he heard me mention to my dining partner that I could get my coffee after we had brunch.  He immediately wanted to know what was stopping me from having my espresso (which was the need for non-dairy milk).  He insisted that he would go back into the walk-in cooler & ask around to make absolutely certain there was not an option.  When he returned, he offered me an idea - which turned out to be delicious and just what I needed.  He concocted a chocolate type modification to an Americano, & I loved it.Our server also assisted me in the process of deciding on a gluten free dish, which was very much appreciated.I know I had similar experiences in my past visits to the Gage (& that was during their busy /late night time).  Once was even during Lollapallooza, so the place was completely packed.  Yet somehow we still managed to have a VERY nice, intimate booth, and enjoyed a quality meal, with good service.I think next time, we may just head to the bar, & see how that goes.  I know just from memory the menu items that myself or someone else at my table can attest to are: The Scotch Egg (late night menu), French Toast (brunch), and the House Roasted Brisket (which I got sans bread/cheese & it was STILL delicious)."
"the very best burger in a long time (the venison), burratta and local heirloom tomato salad, local craft-draft beer, and excellent service."
the service is unmatched! the atmosphere is loud and Chicago. the poutine needs work. the fries do not hold up to the gravy (they MUST be extra crispy) and what's up with the hard carrot pieces? I had the burger and left happy. my fellow diners had the fish and chips and felt the same.
"If you're into gastropubs, this is the spot.  Somehow seemingly untouched by the touristy bustle on Michigan, this restaurant / bar is an awesome place to grab a well-imagined bite and a perfectly paired brew.  Whether it's brunch, dinner, or some evening ambiance, this place is the perfect spot to relax, unwind, and let the supremely attentive staff and bartenders create a great experience for you."
"Ok, so I came here with my dad, boyfriend, and brother when aforementioned dad was in town.  I picked it because I'd been here before and it was close to the father's hotel.  I made the res on OpenTable (this detail will become relevant later).First off, the venison carpaccio is delish.  NB my boyfriend and I are carpaccio aficionados; we order it whenever its on the menu.  Partially because we love eating raw meat, and partially because my boyfriend loves to say ""carPACcio!"" in a silly Italian accent...  anyway... the carpaccio was great.Then came the main course.  I ordered the tuna, compromising my sustainable fish-eating ethics in order to do so.  Sadly, while perfectly seared on the outside and rare on the inside, this was the blandest thing ever.  Accompanying this filet-mignon of the sea was a sad little puddle of white-bean puree which was so totally lacking in seasoning, I cried a little.So, back to the OpenTable detail.  You know how when you make a rez on OpenTable, afterwards they ask you to review the place?  Well, there's also a section where you can ""say something to the restaurant.  Well, in that little box I told them that they committed a horrible crime against humanity (and all fish everywhere) by serving me bland tuna.  Actually I believe I wrote ""Dudes, that was the blandest tuna ever.  White bean puree?  Really?""Shortly after notifying the Gage of my bland tuna experience, I actually got an email from the manager!  He asked if he could send me a gift card to come back.  I said, why SURE!Hence, we returned to the Gage.  The tuna was still ostentatiously still on the menu, but avoiding it like the plague, our follow-up meal was excellent, although our waiter was super creepy.  And when asked what the seasonal berries were in the dessert, he said Strawberry and Rhubarb (it was actually strawberry and blueberry...) and proceeded to explain what Zabaglione was (accompanying the fruit) when, duh, clearly I KNOW what that is.  gosh.Anyway, as long as you DONT ORDER THE TUNA, this place is solid."
"I went here on my way down Michigan Ave after visiting the Millennial Park. Everyone recommended a burger, so I went for that. It was served in about 20 minutes, and it was just okay. The interior build out is nice. This place is more of an upscale bar, if you will, and there were a lot of people there at happy hour. I'd go back with someone if invited, but would not go out of my way to return there personally."
"Delicious from start to finish!  Yes, we had the fried chicken livers.  We could not decide what to order due to the uniqueness of several entrees so we decided to order several items and share between the two of us. The waitstaff gave us great recommendations. He was attentive and not intrusive. I had a craving for french fries and they did not disappoint.  Hot and crispy with a touch of seasonings and a curry dip.  Chicken livers were very good but there was a little too many pieces of fried breading that looked like ""chicken liver"" in the dish.  We ordered a  seasonal soup and seafood special that was cooked to perfection. My husband started his meal with a craft beer and I with a martini.  Be prepared, the dirty martini was VERY strong. We finished with the house made sorbet.Beautiful restaurant with lots of energy!"
"I am spoiled.I live in Toronto, I frequent Montreal. We have the gastro-pub thing down I suppose. The Gage was recommended to us by staff from our hotel when we were too hungry to think and were unable to get wifi access.  While beautiful, formal yet just relaxed enough, I was really not blown away by any means. Service was decent, wine overpriced. At $13 a glass or so for a mediocre malbac. Toronto averages about $10-13 a glass as well, but our liquor tax is astronomical. I purchase bottles in the US, you guys have it good. The price per glass vs per bottle cost is skewed.  The ambiance was alright. Friday night had alot of semi-comfortable looking dates, some after work buddies, some tourists like us in their best ""Out On the Town"" dress. First Course, Poutine to share. Awful poutine. Yes, I know, i am Canadian, why in God's name would we order poutine? Regardless, little frozen peas and carrots in the gravy? Blasphemous! Second. Two of the DCs got Fish and Chips which were the star of the show. I got a half chicken with poached pears and some Chard. It was alright, but not special in my opinion. The last of us ordered the homemade sausages which came with killer potatoes and brie. The sausages were good, but hard to distinguish a real difference of flavour between the three types. The bread and butter was nice. The server, forgettable.Too pricey for the overall experience."
"Located on Michigan Ave and just steps away from Millenium park, the Art Instiute of Chicago, and many other famous tourist attractions, the Gage is awesome.  It definitely has a yuppie, pretentious style vibe, but the food is magnificent.  They consider themselves a Gastropub that serves ""upscale comfort food.""  The decor is pretty vintage and I felt like I was dining with Blair Waldorf, Serena Vander Woodsen (sp), and one of their followers, just based on the decor/furnishings.  I'm sure you could find your fellow Chuck Bass, Dan Humphrey, or Nate Archibald during Happy Hour, but Gossip Girl isn't reality. Haha.Items on the lunch menu include Mussels Vindaloo, Sesame Beets, a Salmon club, and a Ribeye sandwich.  The sides looked awesome (think items such as crisp brie potatoes, fried zucchini and brussel sprouts with brie and bacon), but I wasn't too hungry and stuck with a half of the fire roasted chicken sandwich and the soup special, beans pureéd with a dallop of sour cream. The soup was super tasty and the chicken sando was bursting with spicy flavors and was covered in blue cheese.  Yum! I was in heaven whilst sipping sophisticated wine, chatting it up about nothing too important with my girlfriends and enjoying the cuisine.  The hostesses are super friendly, there's a coat check, and the waitress was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly.  I definitely plan to come back next visit.  Only downfall is that it's a bit on the pricier side."
"Bonus star to FOH for doing their best to accommodate us, when we arrived about an hour early for our lunch reservation, with a toddler and infant, plus an extra adult, amid the lunch rush and Millennium Park crowds seeking refuge from a summer downpour.The service continued to be fantastic, with our server who took the time to help us through the extensive draft beer selections.  I think Gage is really the epitome of what a gastropub ought to be.  Great food carefully created to complement the great drinks.  Standouts on the food side: the scotch egg, fried pickles, fish and chips, and the special of the day, which we had to order upon hearing our server describe it to us: bacon hash burger.Would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone making the requisite Millennium Park stop and in need of really good food."
"I like the concept of this place.  As explained by our waiter, the restaurant is dedicated to the continuation of the rustic American meal.  Your table is illuminated by small, simple candles, and artificial light is kept purposefully at a minimum to maintain the ambiance of some ""frontier pub.""  The food consists of, or is based around, wild game and fish like rabbit, duckling, elk, etc.This may all seem a little strange, given The Gage's address.  But one look at the prices and you'll be shocked back to reality.  The service was great, the beer and whiskey selection was extensive, and if you want a unique experience that belies the ultra-touristy Millennium Park locale, check out The Gage."
"The Gage is a very loud place with very good food. Surprisingly, the servers were friendly and very attentive, despite having a pretty packed restaurant. I opted for the Chef menu which included a fennel soup, lake superior trout and a some sort of baked blueberry/raspberry dessert with nuts and ice cream. The trout was phenomenal and was set on top of grits, crayfish with kale. The waiter commented on how fast I wolfed it down. I'm definitely returning to sample more from the menu."
"Fantastic. Swank. BUT WHY ARE THERE TVS EVERYWHERE?!Anyway. A glass of pink champagne makes everything better. And fuzzier. Started off with a Scotch Egg, my brother's favorite. An hardboiled egg covered with meat and deep fried, served with mustard - there may be a god 'cos this thing was delicious.I had my yearly medium-rare burger, and it was verrrrrrrry good. Our waiter was hipster-cute and attentive, full of good suggestions, like ""another glass of champagne?""Even though I spent practically the price of a pair of shoes on lunch, I loved this place. But take out the TVs, really!"
A little pricey but the food is top notch. Thankfully I have a lot of rich friends who love me. FYI my birthmonth is May.
"A great place to go for brunch, I had the fish and chips and my friends had a purchased a few other plates. Everything tasted great and the service was spectacular. The manager greeted us later on in our meal to make sure everything was upto par Fish an chips were good but not great, there soups are very good"
"I came here with for the express purpose of trying out The Gage Burger, but walked away pretty disappointed with the burger.  I got the burger medium rare, and just found the burger to be too salty.  Even with the onion marmalade in the burger, the patty was just loaded with sodium - normally I like the meat seasoned a bit, but it was just too much in this case.  Everything else about the burger was fine, but the beef patty just killed it.They serve a variety of food here, including poutine with elk meat and cheese, which was delicious.  Service here was good - they didn't cook my burger correctly the first time (well done basically) and gave me another burger immediately.  However, The Gage burger disappointed, and at $16 dollars, an expensive disappointment at that.Large variety of beers and scotches.  Good location too."
"I'm totally on board with the reviewer who said he wished there was a 2.5 stars rating.  We went here last Friday night for dinner and were just plain underwhelmed by the whole experience.  Coming in at 6:15, we were treated to the squeeze through the bar full of people happy houring - there has to be a better way to seat people than to make us do that mess.  Then we get to basically sit on top of everyone around us - at this point, just make communal tables and be done with the pretense.We settled down and ordered.  I was thrilled to be able to get both Magners and a Sophie.  I started with the oysters and the husband ordered the fried chicken livers.  He remarked that these chickens must all have been in AA because the livers were like 10 times larger than normal and just weird - way too many in the order and just mushy.  The oysters were fine, but no one explained which ones were which and there was no listing of the options on the menu.  A bit too much green roe on them as well, but the yuzu citrus was nice.For entrees, we had the BBQ lamb shank and the pork chop with a side of brie potatoes (him).  The lamb was really blah - seriously lacking flavor.  He thought the pork chop was okay, liked the potatoes.  At this point, we were ready to go, but I thought maybe dessert could salvage things.  I got the cheddar biscuit topped with peaches and olive oil ice cream.  Husband went with an aged whiskey.  Even the ice cream could not save the dessicated dryness of this biscuit - but the peaches were yummy.All this, with 4 drinks, was $170 before tip.  Not crazy prices, but not worth it when you leave totally dissatisfied.  I have to say that our service was a lot better than some who have reviewed on here - not pretentious, just sparse at times, but that was more about having too many high-maintenance tables to tend than anything she was in control of."
"Wish I could give this place 2.5 stars. 2.5 sounds better than 2. My fiance and I wanted to try something new and we stumbled upon this place. Looking at the menu, nothing really jumped out at me. To start we ordered and split a salad with lettuce, pears, cherries and cheddar cheese. Was okay, needed more dressing. Wasn't bad, but with no meat in it, wasn't really worth $10.I played it safe and ordered the pork chop, medium. My fiance ordered the same but medium rare. Was OKAY. For $33 for a porkchop, I'd expect it to be great. Porkchop came with a couple little slices of potatoes, some salad with tangerines and some bacon powder. Both our porkchops weren't tender and hard to cut. Server was great. Really friendly and knew the stuff on the menu. Menu was limited. Food was okay, won't be back. I could find a lot more other restaurants to spend $100. $100 for 2 porkchops, 2 salads and 2 beers, tip not included. Not sure why this place has such high reviews."
"We had excellent service on a busy Saturday night where the atmosphere and decor were wonderful. We had the fish and chips with a craft beer - delicious. I enjoyed the experience and would like to go back. I have two small complaints. First, they sat us at a table for two that was squeezed into a row of two tops. Sitting so close to our neighbors on both sides made us a bit self-conscious as we talked. The long row of tables for two felt a bit like a big communal style table. Second, high-priced pub food is hard to get used to as a concept: comfort food at uncomfortable prices."
"We were in Chicago for July 4th weekend and I had found some good reviews, so we decided to try this place out. I had originally picked it because it's a pub and I thought in my head that it would be a fun, casual noisy and cozy/friendly place for a meal. Well, I was a little off. The Gage is trendy and kind of upscale in ambiance. The mood they set in the restaurant is relatively formal. I was surprised to see that it was a relatively family friendly restaurant, since it's a pub. The dining area is separated from the bar area, so it has its onw space and atmosphere. The food was pretty delicious and beautifully presented. They had an amuse bouche with the appetizers we ordered (I love when they do that). We were there for lunch.  Glad because it's a little pricey for what it is, but the lunch menu is less so. The only other downside -- while we all enjoyed our meals, only one of the four of us said we would order the same thing again. That could be partially due to the fact that they have an incredibly fun menu and you want to try everything because it sounds so good. However, it also means that while our dishes were really good, they weren't amazing or addictive. Overall, had a great time and would go back."
"Always come here when I visit Chicago.  Fantastic drinks and food in a relaxed but very active setting.  The fish and chips are first rate, and the bartenders are surprisingly skilled mixologists.  You won't be disappointed!"
"Walked in at 3:45 pm for lunch and the front guy ripped up the lunch menu and told us only dinner. I thought this was boloney, and we left. It was sad that the front people turned us down for lunch at the time with do many tables empty. Would have liked to try but there are too many other inviting places that don't tear up the lunch menu in front of potential guests"
"The Gage was so unexpectedly elegant.  A few of my favorite things:The warm, inviting ambiance. Our cozy corner booth.That absolutely fantastic Gage Cocktail.Perfectly prepared skirt steak.The divine beet salad my generous dining companion shared with me.  Impressive squash tart.The hefty 8oz pours of wine.Outstanding bread!Crisp, white tablecloth and linens.Excellent service.And when I claimed my tummy was too full for dessert, I managed to devour the apple fritters.   Fried apples count as a serving of fruit, right?I highly recommend The Gage for a classy night on the town."
"Hands down one of my favorite places in Chicago!Their restaurant week 2012 offerings were memorable and I'm so glad my first taste of duck was here. Their lunch prix fixe that week had a lovely BBQ duck sandwich as the star. Delicious!I've been here several times before and since for both lunch and dinner and always try to grab a cocktail table by the bar. I love the atmosphere and it's loud enough that despite that the tables are close together you can't hear the conversation at the table next to you. I've been here twice with vegetarians, which is ironic since this place caters to carnivores but they are wonderfully accommodating of herbivores. Their presentation is interesting without being ridiculous. Don't let the portions fool you. They seem small but you'll get stuffed quick!"
"Me and my Fiancé came to check this place out, the yelp ratings and review were great, and because we were craving mussels this was our best bet. We only had 2 appetizers and some wine. 1) The steamed clams since the menu was changed, they were delicious!!! Must try if your a fan if sea food. 2) The cheese fondue appetizer was nice and rich with some toasted bread on the side which was  great as my Fiancé mentioned. I was not able to try the bread because I'm on gluten free diet. We will definitely come back to this great venue  for dinner or just some appetizers. Recommended!!!"
"The food was absolutely outstanding.  I took my wife to the city for Mother's day and we had a couple places that we had to go to.  This was one of them and we decided to go here and grab lunch.  The staff was very attentive and knew their stuff when it came to both the food and the beer.  I'm a beer snob and I told her I'd like to try something I haven't had and that I like pale ales and IPA's.  She recommend Akari Shogun (sp.) and it was spot on.  When my burger showed up it only got better.  One of the tastiest burgers I've had in a long time.  I've been to other burger spots through out the city (Lockdown, Kuma's, Cortland's Garage, Flagship etc.) and their's was ranked with the best.  I would definately go back.  Not a downside other than having to walk about the city with an extremely full belly which made it a little uncomfortable."
"Went there for the first time today based on Yelp reviews and being close to the Art Institute, a block north on Michigan.  The service was great Kira our server was very helpful in helping us select our beverages and meal selection.  My wife and I were celebrating a milestone anniversary and the manager brought over 2 glasses of campaign, nice touch.  It is a bit of a walk from the Lyric opera but we are planning on going back when we are downtown again."
"Hard to believe we had never tried The Gage before. Probably because we tend to go to the University Club if we are in that part of the Loop.  After a drink in the bar, we were seated at a table next to a fireplace. You have the details about this place from the 700 plus reviews but wanted to add that the service was outstanding.  How often can you ask the waiter about how he would recommend eating leftover mussels (the portion was huge)-cold or reheated?His suggestion-use a fry pan with some vegetable stock until the mussels are serving temp. Other staff showed a complete understanding of the menu items, preparation and made great recommendations after listening to our tastes.The owner stopped by, showed his sincere interest in how we found the experience and bought us a glass of wine just because.Please try this restaurant-it is well worth it and represents one of Chicago's better bistro restaurants."
"As a Roosevelt University Alumni I passed this restaurant several times on my way to class. I was always curious how the food was but never tried it until the other day. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, service was great and the cuisine was excellent. While I was having lunch with a friend who dines there regularly the owner came over to say hello and introduce himself. He offered us dessert on the house and presented it personally. The owner then proceeded to check on the other patrons at nearby tables. The desserts by the way were amazing! Definitely recommend."
"We made a reservation for 6 on a Friday night and as soon as we got to this crowded hotspot we were seated. Service was a little slow at the beginning while we waited on drinks, but after that things were great. A group of friends and I split the poutine, the cheese board and the fried zucchini and olives. The poutine was delicious though I think we could have passed by the average cheese plate and fried veggies. For my entree I ordered the fish and chips. Cleverly served in newspaper, these were very good. The portion was, large and the fries were very crisp and salty. They were served with tartar sauce, ketchup and malt vinegar. Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere at the Gage and thought the prices were pretty reasonable seeing as its in a pretty touristy area. I would love to try some more unique items on the menu!"
"Can't go wrong with brunch at The Gage, every Sunday after church it's our favorite place to stop and catch some food for the day. Great location, great food, and not too bad on the wallet."
"The Gage is a great place to get together with friends. It's cozy, intimate, and has great food and drink. We came with friends on a recent Sunday and sat in the bar - no problem getting a table, as most were headed to the Bears' game.They've got a lot of great choices on their menu - from game to seafood to great salads. I had an exceptionally great mussels appetizer, so large it served as my dinner. The beer broth was flavorful and delicious.My cocktail was fabulous - a gin, mint, and cucumber concoction that was refreshingly yummy.Great place for all and conveniently located across from Millenium Park!"
Recently checked out Gage on my business trip to Chicago. I love this place the atmosphere is great and  I highly recommend that you try the Poutine.
"Just steps from Millennium Park, yet unexpectedly so very untouristy, there's nary a fanny pack or I (heart) Montana t-shirt to be found in this upscale gastropub. Clearly a hit with The Loop business folks, The Gage packs a tasty wallop with the thirsty shirt and tie / pencil skirts and heels set. Very masculine in its space, The Gage is somewhere I could envision powerful men puffing on big cigars alongside the stockinged secretaries and sophisticated socialites that grace the arms of their pressed Armani suits. Lots of languid dark wood, polished walnut finishes, traditional nailhead furnishings and dreamy flickering candlelight that all fall within a balanced dichotomy of raucous bar scene in front of the house and sumptuous leather booth filled dining room in back. Take your pick and decide where you want the evening to go... Service in both areas is impeccable, expect to be well taken care of... pampered. From sharp, cheeky bartenders to the knowledgeable yet easygoing waitstaff, The Gage didn't miss a step with my group in either capacity. At the ready to offer up suggestions-a-plenty on the classic gastropub fare menu, I was thankful for assistance... SO. MANY. CHOICES. We went with a smattering of apps, entrées and wines (decanted, lovely) and were pleased with almost everything. Allow me to steer you away from the Poached Swan Creek Duck Egg on Mushroom Toast - an over cooked egg combined with thick, meaty mushrooms on utterly uninspiring Texas toast - while offering up the Swan Creek Rabbit Pâté (so lavish) and Scotch Egg (a must try) as far better executed starter options for your tasting pleasure. Fortunately, every single main dish was fawned over... it appears you can't go wrong with any selection. We know the famous Gage Burger with its melty Camembert on a Malt Roll is ooey, gooey fabulosness, but did you know the Braised Lamb Shank with Squash, Fried Artichokes and BBQ Jus is even more delicious?! True! One of the best lamb dishes I've had in some time... Loved it! The only real problem with dining at The Gage was by the end of this veritable feast there was positively no room left for dessert. Nope, not even in my second stomach... but if Beer Battered Apple Fritters and Caramelized Banana Gianduja Ice Cream Sandwiches aren't enough to lure me back in for a second visit, nothing is!"
"Literally the worst food I have eaten in over a year. I am not sure why this place gets such great reviews. I ordered a simple hamburger, medium, and it came out UNCOOKED, raw (with some searing on the outside). Ordered the fried pickles and they cam to the bar fifteen minutes after my meal was served. I should have known better that to order the fried pickles - it was probably the health food gods telling me to watch my cholesterol, they are fried pickles for pete's sake. But they were not crispy, they were drenched in oil. Will not be back."
This place is a little too pricy for what it was.  We enjoyed the food (especially the lobster risotto) but it wasn't super-special. We felt a bit rushed by the service and frankly too loud to have a conversation.  3-1/2 stars if I could.
"I think this might be a regular joint for me if I lived in Chicago but I live in DC so it's a two-times a year place for me.Great staff; classy and attentive.  They feature a great beer list (the Delaware-brewed Dogfish, etc.) and heavy pours on the glasses of wine.The have many different courses and everything I've eaten there (onion soup - interesting presentation, risotto, wild sea bass, salads, etc.) has been very good and well-prepared.  I imagine there might be better restaurants in Chicago but I like the location (walking distance from the W and other nice hotels on Adams), the staff, and the ambiance."
"While in Chicago for a conference I visited The Gage for dinner and cocktails.  I did not have a reservation, but I was able to to snag a two top at the bar.  I ordered the rabbit salad and (quasi-) poutine, plus a few cocktails.   Delicious, each and every thing I had.  I wasn't bothered by how busy the place was (6-8 on a Friday); I just enjoyed my food and drink.  If in Chicago I would visit The Gage again."
"The noise level at The Gage is extremely loud. But do not let this deter you. It's a gastropub after all. The thing that impressed me about The Gage is that the menu goes beyond a gastropub. They have food items that are unique enough that I don't see them very much at other restaurants in Chicago.My fiance and I are foodies and are delighted with their menu. The fried chicken livers were crisp and lovely. One order comes in about 4-5 pieces and it's great as a starter. We had elk tartare (I didn't see it on their menu the last time we were there so I assume they change up their menu from time to time) was amazing. I can't say no to steak tartare and I couldn't stay away from trying this. We also tried their bone marrow which was interesting. There wasn't alot of ""meat"" or ""juice"" in it and most of it were the bones but it was interesting nevertheless. I'm all for the entire experience of dining. I've also tried their seared tuna which was very tender and lovely-- lightly seared on the outside and rare in the inside.Each time we were there, we've had great service from our servers. I've said before that although this place is a gastropub, it goes beyond a gastropub. Each time, our servers were very knowledgeable and passionate about the food produced from the kitchen. They described to us the specials of the day and answered our questions about the food in a knowledgeable way that you would expect only from fancy restaurants and not at a gastropub. Plus points for that. Also, the last time we were there, my fiance asked our server some questions about the wine menu and we were extremely impressed at the wine knowledge that our server knew. Usually servers would just send over their in-house sommelier to the table to answer any wine questions.We will definitely return, whether for food and table service or just to sit at the bar for a beer."
The service here was terrific.  Our server doted on us and gave wonderful descriptions for my picky needy self.  Loved the atmosphere- comfortable and homey yet hip.Yum list:Mussels VindalooBread Basket...soooo fresh and warmEscargot_interesting but deep fried so not the traditional wayOysters - 5 out of 6 ...didn't tell them but one was not really thereBrussel SproutsMushrooms(WOW)Wine is pricey but very generous portions.  2 glasses equaled 3 elsewhereNot a cheap night by any means but an outstanding experience with perfect food.
"The chicken is also amazing, with roasted baby tomatoes and mushrooms. Be sure to order their creamy mashed potatoes to accompany it. Service is still amazing, even on a busy Friday night!"
"I hope to get back sometime soon. We arrived 10 mins after our reservation time, and had to wait less than 5 mins to be seated. It was much busier than I expected at 6, so glad we made reservation. All the staff we had contact with were quite nice, and efficient. We didn't have entrees, only apps and salad because we were headed to Symphony Center and didn't want to be stuffed. Cheese tray w/pairings was very nice. Seared scallops were boarderline undercooked, but tasty. Salad good, not memorable (but few are). Noise level not ideal, but it is a bustling place for a good meal and drinks, so pretty much what you'd expect. I'll be back, and entrees will be ordered. More to follow after next trip............"
"Just went for lunch and we had the Brie fondu and it was amazing! We had the burger, chicken sandwich and salmon sandwich which were excellent! Had brunch a few months back and it was great too"
"LOVE IT.  burger and sausage, as good as it gets."
"I travel for work.  When I travel I almost always travel alone and this I almost always eat alone.  Please keep that in mind as you read my reviews as I am sure my experience would differ if I was with someone.  I stopped into the Gage yesterday on my last day in Chicago for an early dinner / late lunch.  As to be expected the place was not busy.  I was there the night before and it was packed (which is a good sign, but I did not stay past a drink or 2).  The atmosphere is terrific.  Really a great build out.  When I went to use the restroom (which is downstairs) I noticed some small tables in a corner.  I thought what a weird horrible place to sit right by the restrooms.  on the way back up the stairs I noticed that there was actually a whole other bar down there.  I believe they serve dinner down there as well but I am unsure.As it was not packed I received excellent service.  they had a decent selection of beers and looked like the bar was well stocked.  I was not too hungry so I did not order any of the entrees.  I sat in the bar at a table along the ""bench"" wall.  I ordered the scotch egg which I was really looking forward too.  For you uncultured dummies like me a scotch egg is a hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage, breaded then fried.  It comes with a very small salad and mustard.  This dish disappointed me.  It was pretty heavy for what I was expecting as a ""snack"".  The sausage nor the egg sang in this dish.   I don't know if this is possible but I thought that if there was a way to have the egg be soft boiled with the yolk oozing out that would have made this a much better dish but what do I know  I am just a generic white business guy.  I also had the sesame beets.  This dish was magical to me.  I loved every bite of it.  It is diced beets mixed with blue cheese served with grapefruit, lettuce and oranges.  I thought it would be nice to have more of the citrus as all that was on the plate was a few small wedges.  but overall an excellent dish!  I would highly recommend this dish.For the scotch egg, the beet salad and 2 beers I believe my total was around $45.Overall The Gage would be a place I would visit again.  It was restaurant week ( I did not do the restaurant week menu) but heard a table near mine raving over the pork.  I did feel a little disappointed in their offering.  Their portions seemed pretty big but for some reason I think I was expecting more of a tapas style however there is nothing the Gage did to make me think this just what I thought."
"I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, but definitely doesn't deserve 4. It was a great scene for that part of town on a Friday night, which is usually a little dead. I had high hopes because of the Yelp reviews, but nothing won me over. We had the poutine to start with, per all the recommendations, which was yummy but not overwhelming. Good beer selection, ok food, fun atmosphere, good people watching. Pretty expensive for what you get, I don't think we'll be back."
Had not been to the Gage in awhile because of time energy money you name it and now I want to buy a stool at the bar and never leave..LISTEN TO THIS LOUD AND CLEAR the Cream Cheese Mousse desert it totally the most amazing piece of heaven.. Everyone run and get it now..Bravo to the the Chef!!!The Gage Family is now my new adoptive family!!!!! Also Sarah the Bartender what a professional wonderous woman.
"Best poutine I have ever had!  Everything else was good, but the poutine definitely stood out."
"I returned back to The Gage for a company dinner and thought it was fantastic... again. Here are my highlights.+ Great bread service. Soft and delicious sourdough + whipped butter = happy girl.+ The poutine was excellent. Not as good as The Southern, but still worth noting.+ The mixed green salad was good. Not great. + The risotto was heavenly.+ I had the duck confit + breast. It was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. I would definitely order this again.+ Dessert - We had a few going around. The pistachio cake with rhubarb ice cream was my favorite. The Gage has never disappointed me. I will be back again!"
"What an awesome place. My dad was in town and we took him here before going to see a show. Service was amazing, everyone was friendly. Food was GREAT! I had the burger (Delish) and my dad had the Fish and Chips (Yum). Highly recommend this place!"
"My husband and I couldn't stop talking about how great the food was. The service was excellent and the server knowledgeable, checking on allergy issues with the chef. We were VERY glad to have made a reservation because it was PACKED. Definately would go again!"
"A+ for Creativity and Obscure British Dishes. I had no idea what a ""Scotch Egg"" was. Turns out a Wikipedia page won't tell you that its delicious, so my yelp review will. ITS DELICIOUS! Don't think too hard about the cholesterol attack from deep frying a hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat and coated in breadcrumbs. My entree was the Hanger Steak served with apple cider soaked watermelon and a coleslaw with marcona almonds. My steak was more well-done than I prefer, but it was good quality and flavorful. I loved the whimsy the watermelon added and the light taste and juiciness complemented the steak surprisingly well. It was steak, but still managed to be a light summer dish. The Cheesecake with some sort of liquor drizzle and graham cracker crust was wonderfully sweet, creamy, and bitter all at once. Somehow The Gage managed to serve a 3-course fixed lunch menu that didn't overwhelm me for the rest of the afternoon. Bravo!The basement dining space is elegant yet casual. I thought it was a good spot for a 50-person luncheon with presenters.I'm reserving my fifth star because of the overdone steak, and what seemed like a rather loud main dining area and slightly overpriced menu. However, I don't walk into too many Gastropubs and find them to have a creative, hearty, fresh, AND traditional menu. I will be back!"
It's always nice to think back on a dining experience and then realize you love every single thing you ate.Let's start with round 1:  Poutine! I've never had it before so I don't have a lot to compare it to but I really enjoyed this dish.  MmmmmmRound 2:  Onion Soup.  The server brought us bowls with the dry ingredients and then poured in the broth at the table. This was so damn good.  The broth was rich with flavor yet still light.  Round 3:  Scallops. Cooked perfectly with lovely side greens.  Drinks: dirty martini's and wine....all good but not cheap but no surprise there.I also really enjoyed the ambiance of this place.  It is very big but still warm.  They do a great job with lighting and a pleasing comforting color scheme.
"I had a pre-show dinner here before the ballet over the Christmas holiday.  The chef was knowledgeable and accommodating for gluten free concerns.  There were significant gf options, even desert.  I highly recommend.  I can't speak for celiac, but I had no reactions, and the good was delicious."
"We went on Fri night 10/23/09.  It's the worst night to go out, but we were on vacation & near Millennium Park so ate here.It was crazy loud at the bar and the wait was suppose to be an hr or more so we took the crappy 2-top table right by the revolving door.  Blah.The separate bathrooms are pass the bar down the flight of stairs.  Evil when there's tons of ppl at the bar.We got a bunch of stuff:We didn't get FREE bread, I saw another table get some after we were almost done w/ our meal.beer $6 - B. got it, he liked it.mussels $13 - many mussels in a Thai flavored broth w/ huge crouton.  Fine.Phesant thigh $10 - dry, dry, dry w/ some lentils on the side.Romaine salad $9 - fine enough w/ some anchovies on the top.braised leeks $7 - tasty, small serving.goat cheese risotto $13 - tiny serving of it.  Stir it up, good stuff on the bottom waitress told us.roasted squash $7 - just ok w/ some butter in it.butterscotch creme brulee $9 - just ok, nothing special.Total $74 + 8.51 tax = $82.51 Before tip.Valet parking $20 available around corner @ university club 76 E. Monroe."
"I loved The Gage.Our server Jason was fabulous. He made great suggestions, and we ended up enjoying our dinner without having to worry if my food was going to kill me. This restaurant is gluten-free friendly, so they know how to take care of you.I had the pork chops with the bacon powder. That's right folks! BACON POWDER! If you love bacon, please try it.My fiance had the elk. That was delicious as well.The restaurant is pretty pricey, so save your pennies for a night on the town. I wouldn't go here all the time unless I had plenty of money to throw around."
"I made reservations for Mother's Day dinner (for five people) weeks ahead of schedule, mostly because I was nervous about making sure we had a place to eat before heading over to see Book of Mormon.  They called me the day of to confirm the reservation, agreed to move it by fifteen minutes (convenient but totally not necessary), and even seated us a little early when part of our party arrived earlier than expected.  Our hostess and waiter were both great, friendly and kind without being intrusive.  The food was incredible, and they even rushed to get us our check when we realized that we were in danger of being a little late for the show because we'd gotten distracted.  All in all, a great restaurant with amazing staff that made us feel welcome and important despite being very busy."
Fabulous from the moment we walked in.  I had made the reservation for the wrong day - no problem.  The wait staff were so great.  The waiters helped each other and the people who took care of busing and water were great too - not to hovering.  The food - AMAZING!  we shared a few plates.  the scallops were perfection!  the Arugula salad with rabbit was just as amazing. There is a mustard vinaigrette on the Arugula that was just great!  the risotto was a medley of veggies and creaminess - just YUM... will be back...
"What a fantastic place!!!  The decor and food were perfect!!  We ordered the stuffed peppers and poutine appetizers, the 16oz ribeye and amish roasted chicken for dinner, and the cinnamon creme brûlée and chocolate caramel pave for desert.  WHAT GREAT PLACE!!!"
"I asked the waitress what I should order.She says ""everything's pretty good"".I decide to call her bluff.   I find the least appetizing sounding thing on the menu.  I order it.  Ha ha ha.  Wait a second, is the joke on her or on me?  Fuck.The food arrives.   It's a beautiful amalgamation of Polenta, cheese, vegetables and spices.   It's just plain spectacular.    I am in heaven.Every time I come here it's eerily consistent.Solid times in Gastropub city."
"I had reservations for 6 at 11:45am.  Unfortunately, not all of our group had arrived on time.  Luckily, The Gage still allowed us to sit at a table of 6 without our entire group arriving.Even though it was lunch time, we were given both the brunch and the lunch menu. I thought that was great because it gave us more options to choose from.I ordered the fish and chips. Almost the BEST fish and chips I have ever had (next to the fish and chips I had in England). It was perfectly battered and fried. REALLY REALLY GOOD.The rest of the group ordered the roasted chicken and the house made corned beef hash.  We all cleared our plates off! It was that delicious!Prices are reasonable and service was good. Other than the crying baby at the next table, the ambiance here was great.  Be sure to make reservations because the restaurant was packed when we left around 1pm."
"In search of a new gastropub I tried out Gage with my partner in crime one Saturday night and was very pleased.The service was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly and prompt. I do have one question regarding the male employees.....are they required to have a mustache?The price for the food was phenomenal....comparable places would charge much more.My husband and I shared the seared scallops for an appetizer which consisted of only two scallops but they were both very big and definitely worth it. For our entrees I had the Caramelized Lobster Pumpkin, Lemon Quinoa, Basil, Chili which was as beautiful on my plate as it was to taste. The lobster was stuffed inside a miniature cooked pumpkin surrounded by the quinoa and drizzled with the chili sauce. All of the flavors complemented each other very nicely and made for an exciting array of zest. My husband ordered the Wild Striped Bass Cauliflower, Pomegranate, Pickled Shallot. The addition of the pomegranate was a wonderful accompaniment to the dish especially since it is not commonly seen within most dinners. I will be back to this favorite time and time again....."
Came here for brunch. Easily accommodated us and service wasn't bad. The food was alright but nothing extraordinary. I remember the prices being somewhat high but what do you expect on Michigan Ave.
I was weary on trying the venison burger as I'd never had venison in the past and WOW! It was so delicious. We got it served medium and the tenderness was perfect! The fries were also delicious! I would go again for the burger!
"My gf and I fell in love with this place the moment we walked in.  Everything harks back to the turn of the century, something I miss about SF.  The food was great and so were the drinks.  As much as we had our server running around for our party of 8, service didn't falter at all and we shut down the place.  Most of our party had already snacked earlier so they were just here for dessert while we were eating our actual, late-night dinner.  With that said, the food was delicious and so were the desserts.  I can't even remember what we all ordered, but suffice it to say I was absolutely stuffed.  And the drinks were just as good."
"This almost hidden centrally located ""Gastropub"" was almost just as I expected it, however I think it tries to be both a high end restaurant and gastropub. We started w/ the new bone marrow app, very tasty, however it only came w/ 3 crustinis which is definitely not enough for all that marrow. The asparagus & leek ravioli which was more like a soup but pretty tasty, portion was a bit small for the price. My boyfriend had the duck which was large portion & very tasty. The drinks were excellent! I saw that they had hibiscus soda so I asked if the bartender could make me something with that and they did and it was delicious. The revolution IPA was also wonderful! We sat outside and the tall planters were nice because it was a very busy night but we felt like we had this little intimate dinner. I would go again to try more dishes."
"I had the Scotch Egg which i loved, and the Coffee Rubbed Pork Grits, Sautéed Ramps, Fava Beans, Shaved Prosciutto Salad, Red Eye Jus which was depressing.The pork was dry, flavorless and overcooked.  My wife had a special Corn soup which she loved, and the Seared Duck Breast which i tasted and it was amazing. Complete 180 from my flavorless over cooked pork, her duck was juicy and loaded with flavor.For desert i had the Cherries Jubilee and the drink pairing which was a Whisky Ale, both were fantastic.  Beer and Ice Cream? Who would have thought.The waiter was wonderful, and the location was great.  We walked from our Segway tour to the restaurant, then back to our hotel.  I wish that i had enjoyed my entree more, but my wife's entree gave me hope."
"I can honestly say I was beyond pleasantly surprised when we dined here.  I saw some interesting concoctions on the menu, so I didn't know what to make of it.  Well I am here to tell you, GO!The first thing that attracted me was the decor.  It was very comfortable, yet eye catching with the interesting paintings.  The lighting was great because it was intimate, but yet bright enough where you can see your food and the person/people you are with.NOW!  Onto the food...we started with the pickle and olive salad.  Well, I love pickles, and I love olives, so this was like heaven on earth.  The topper on this dish was feta cheese...awesome.  Who would have thought to make this combination?  It was quite different, but worked very well...and was so yummy!We also had the Brie fondue...I could have eaten it with a spoon as soup instead of dipping it with bread.  So great.  It was nice and hot and went perfectly with the crostinis they served with it.  For an entree, we each got the Amish chicken.  I would give this a 6.  I mean, chicken is chicken.  It had a nice flavor, but didn't even come close to the appetizers.The service was great.  Our waitress was very attentive and we never had an empty drink.  The only MINUS was the noise level.  It is definitely not a place you can have an intimate quiet conversation, but it's a fun place you can go to with a group of people.I highly recommend this to anyone!"
"Before I headed to Chicago, I checked in with my friend who used to live in the Windy City for her list of favorite food haunts. Near the top of her list was The Gage. After spending the day at the Shedd, my friend and I figured we'd drop by The Gage for dinner before catching the Metra back to the suburbs.We were not disappointed. I suspected we'd be in good hands when we sat down and our server reminded us that the chef was a recent regional James Beard award nominee. We started with an order of the duck fat nuts and the famous Scotch egg. The nuts weren't anything too special. I guess I had hoped the duck fat would give them a richer flavor, but it was too subtle to really justify the price tag. I'd probably skip these next time.But that Scotch egg was great. The breading outside was light and crispy, and one cut in with my knife revealed the crumbly yolk. The combination of the sausage and the egg was like brunch for dinner. And the accompanying whole-grain mustard was a nice touch. Next, we tried the basil escargot. The snails were lightly fried with basil, giving them a light crispness and unique flavor that paired nicely with the natural earthiness of escargot and the goat cheese fonduta underneath. But the real star of the dish was the light crunch of the hazelnut crisp on top. It gave the savory dish just a hint of sweetness and a unique texture pairing.We also tried the seared scallops. These were cooked perfectly--that beautiful touch of caramelization on the outside and tender meat inside. The accompanying apple and watercress salad was nice, especially when I got a bite with the beet purée. The touch of horseradish was unexpected, but really brought all the flavors together.My friend and I split the special risotto of the day--a vegetarian mix with rapini and cheese. I think we should probably have stuck with appetizers--the risotto felt a little too safe and expected after eating such unique flavor combinations in our appetizers. Plus, the rice was a little undercooked for my tastes. After such delicious savory food, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try dessert, even though I was admittedly already a little stuffed. We ordered the chocolate ganache and caramel tartlet and the gingered beignets. The chocolate tartlet wasn't anything too special--your basic chocolate tart with sweet caramel crumbles on top--but the accompanying toasted milk ice cream was delicious! It was so rich and creamy, with such simple, yet sophisticated, flavor.The gingered beignets were easily my favorite bite of the entire dinner. The dough was light and gently fried. The ginger ice cream and peach jam made for a great pairing, just the right touch of spice and heat.Service was attentive, even with a full house. Water glasses were promptly refilled and our server was ready and eager to answer any questions we had about the menu. It's always nice to see restaurants hold on to that humble charm after they've gotten James Beard recognition.With a creative--yet classic--menu that not only looks good but tastes good too, I'll definitely be back to The Gage the next time I'm in Chicago."
Excellent food and service - very nice decor and environment as well.  The shushido peppers were very good and my burger was fantastic!  Highly recommend!
"Our 2nd visit was even better than our 1st, which was outstanding!!Billy, thank you for ""flooding our table"" with desserts."
"My boyfriend and I went to chicago for a Packers game and stayed at The Silversmith Hotel (thanks to name your own price and william shatner). The concierge, though a tad intense, got us reservations at the Gage. We were impressed. The dining room was intimate yet still had the city appeal with a visible and busy, yet cohesive, kitchen.For an appetizer, we had this fondue that was to die for. I had the roasted Amish chicken which at the time came with Cous cous and kale. He had the fish and chips and remarked that it was by far the best he'd ever had. For dessert, we had a poached pear stuffed with chocolate mousse. OMG. So good.  Drinks were fairly outrageously priced, but that's my only complaint. Service was impeccable and we would definitely return!"
"Good location, right across from Milenium Park. Food was alright, a bit pricey for what they're worth. The complimentary bread was so hard, I usually always ask for seconds since I'm a huge bread fan, but we didn't even finish our small loaf that they brought out. I read raves about their whipped butter, which turned out to taste like movie theater popcorn butter. What a disappointment. I had the carmelized lobster on top of lemon quinoa. I would give this dish 5 star for the taste, but again, not really worth the price. And for the main course, I had the duck confetti. I'm not a fan, but I see where people would like it. The duck meat was well seasoned and really moist, but I wasn't a fan of the goat cheese and garnishes. Overall, my experience at the Gage was alright, I think we hyped it up too much since we saved this pricey establishment for our last day in Chicago."
"Went for a business lunch with a group of 6 people. We ended up going during restaurant week so we were able to get a three course Prix Fixe menu for $22. Ambiance was very cool and hip, and the place was buzzing with energy. Definitely seems like a happening lunch spot:The three courses were:- Celery Root Purée soup: amazing!- BBQ Duck Confit sandwich: huge massive sandwich that was difficult to eat, but it rocked my world. Excellent!- Fritters: deep fried dough. Powdered sugar. 'Nuff said.Overall I was impressed with The Gage, and I will definitely go back in the future!"
"The Gage is one of those great staple places...one where you know you can grab a solid pint, a delicious burger and some unexpected treats.Chef Dirk Flanigan makes standard gastropub fare beyond far from standard with inventive twists, complex flavors and unexpected textures. Overall - delicious.My favorite meal at The Gage is brunch.Faves include:-Irish breakfast-Smoked salmon-Cornbeef HashBut honestly, you can't go wrong.My advice: go early, drink lots and come back time and time again for the burger. Delish."
"Great venison burger, rare. Amazing."
"Went here with my friend on our Summer Chicago trip! The restaurant is close to the Silversmith Hotel and also to Millenium Park. I was able to rsvp 2 hours ahead of time and able to get a table during dinner hours! On to food:For a college student, this place is pricey! I was fortunate enough to pick some worth while dish like the Rabbit salad. However, my main entree was a steak that was a bit overcooked (I asked for medium). Service was good, but my friend and I might have been ""ignored"" by the waitress because we look a bit young? I did received a complementary dessert because it was my birthday :)"
"The Gage and I have history. That's right, a restaurant which has been in existence for only about two years has been the backdrop to some very memorable times in my life. Let me explain... On top of being a place that my wife and I have relied on many times for a good lunch, having some after work drinks, brunch, whatever- this place is also where my wife and I celebrated our engagement, and most recently where we got together with family and friends to share a celebratory brunch after the MS Walk. The Gage made planning for this event incredibly easy and accommodated a group of 20 of us neatly, and with very little notice (and multiple changes even two days before our arrival), all with terrific service and a welcoming disposition. They didn't think twice about breaking their own seating rule by allowing my handicapped mother to sit before our party arrived, and then filled us in as our group slowly made our way in. Food has always been fantastic here, and on this beautiful Sunday I followed my usual pattern by ordering a sandwich. I have never been disappointed by their sandwiches, and this time I had their Gunthorp Farms Pork sandwich. It is massive- served on a ciabatta roll, accompanied by melted brie, cabbage slaw and mustard- it is hardy, yet the flavors come through. Everyone around me enjoyed their meal and service was terrific. Ambiance and decor are well thought out here coming across as a modern, urban pub. You get the feeling that it is still a pub without being clubbed over the head with the typical Irish-pub theme. The Gage allows the food to speak to you in that lovely Irish brogue, and I really appreciate that! Their use of subway tiles are exactly my style. Comfortable enough for a group of active walkers to sit and enjoy a great meal or drinks, and yet sophisticated enough to make it a date spot, or even a place to continue business talk after an important meeting. The Gage is exactly what the heart of the loop needs as an all-purpose dining and drinking destination."
"First went to The Gage a few years back for a birthday dinner.  Wasn't a yelper back then, but overall the memory of the place was good.  Got the scotch egg last time out of novelty, but I would recommend it more if you had a party larger than 2 so you can share it, since it is pretty filling for an appetizer.  They have a pretty good selection of beers on tap too, but it's been a bit too long for me to remember exactly what I ordered (and the beer selection rotates out with seasonal items).  Went again right before a CSO concert. I had tried to make reservations on Open Table but they didn't have times that worked (either too early or too late), so I ended up calling them and seeing if they had any other reservations available.  It worked!  Would recommend doing that if you don't see a selection of times available on Open Table, just as a last resort.It took a bit of time to figure out what to order, but with the help of our very enthusiastic waiter, we were able to finally pin down what we wanted.  Ended up sharing a carafe of red wine that paired really well with the mussels vindaloo, rabbit salad and duck breast that we ordered.  Hands down, mussels vindaloo was the best dish we ordered.  And the portion size was enormous.  Probably would have been fine to just order that and get dessert, since I was basically stuffing my face after that first dish.  It had great flavor, the broth was amazing (I probably got full from sopping up the broth with bread) and the mussels were just the right size, super tender and plump.  The rabbit salad was well portioned as a split entree, great bite to the greens and paired with a small block of brie, meshed very well with the rabbit.  Duck breast was probably the least spectacular, but still not bad.  Bit too rare for my taste, could have been cooked a bit more, but adding sultanas and marcona almonds was a nice touch to the dish.  Ordered coffee and pumpkin mousse with coconut curry ice cream for dessert.  Coffee was meh, but the coconut curry ice cream was out of this world.  Reminded me of the pineapple curry ice cream I had at the Gordon Ramsey restaurant at the W Hotel in LA, but even better. Overall a pleasant dinner experience.  Some of the dishes are larger than others and would be a good idea to always ask the server the individual portion sizes of the entrees.  Acoustics are a bit loud there, but that's to be expected for a large gastropub."
We made a reservation for this place over the weekend and showed up on a very busy time.  They gave a great table right away which was surprising given how busy they were.  We have been several times and you have to understand that The Gage will always be a louder boisterous kind of place so be prepared for that.  However the food and service are great.  Our waiters have consistently been great making excellent recommendations and providing quick service.  The Gage has great food like the Mussels and the Fish and Chips.  We are fast becoming regulars here.
"We had a great time. I read a few reviews about slow or poor service. This was not our experience. The waiter had a good sense of humor and was attentive. He made recommendations and made sure we had what we needed to make our experience pleasant.  The other comment I saw in reviews was about the noise level. If you want a quiet romantic dinner, this is not the place. I would call it more lively than noisy. The restaurant is alive with activity. People coming, going, eating, laughing and enjoying themselves. The Gage has a very inventive menu, filled with something to entice everyone."
"So excited I finally got to check out the gage. It was the perfect way to fuel up after an afternoon of ice skating across the street in Millennium Park!Even at weird lunch hours this place is still busy! So we decided to park it by the bar seating area. Love the leather couches, wooden inside and awesome music they had going. If you didn't read already, serious beer selection, so feast your eyes.My date tried the chicken noodle soup for a starter, it came out fresh, savory and in a huge bowl! As for lunch he had the gage burger and I had the pork belly sandwich. Both of us agreed the pork belly was the way to go - very tender and amazingly sauced up with some yummy fries.Would love to come back here again when in the area."
"We went here on the recommendation of someone we met and because it popped up under my PLACES app.  We were seated without a reservation very quickly but inside and not outside.  There were tables empty but the wait was an hour for one.  If you have empty tables and an hour wait you haven't balanced your waitstaff properly.The menu seemed very interesting.  Opting for a fowl meal, I chose the fried chicken livers. Awful.  Over cooked beyond consumption.  I would have asked our server to take it back and bring another but we never saw her again in a reasonable amount of time before our entrees arrived.  When I finally got the bus help to ask her over, she was defensive about this, saying ""If I'd asked her she would've brought another one"".  That's fine if you're checking your tables, but you weren't.  Thankfully the manager came over and said he'd take them off the bill.The roasted amish chicken arrived and I would imagine this should have some kind of specific flavor and it didn't.  It's just plain roasted chicken.  Even what I get at the grocery store has more flavor.  AT least it was juicy and not overcooked.The wine choices are decent but horribly overpriced considering the prices on the menu.  $67 for a bottle of California red is way too much considering the most expensive entree is $38.  The place needs to re-price it's wines or get other choices that are more in line with the entree prices.The ambiance of the establishment is very nice.  The green subway tiles on the columns are very handsome.There are lot's of places to eat in the Loop, but I wouldn't visit this place a 2nd time."
Great spot for lunch in the Loop.  A friend and I started with their tasty chicken noodle soup and then shared a burger and a salmon sandwich.  They also had a nice dessert menu and their creme brulee was solid.  Excellent service and quick for lunch so we could get back to the office.
"We stopped by the Gage a few months ago and enjoyed a round of drinks, so we decided to return and try it for dinner with a group of friends. But we won't be back. With so many other great dining options downtown, it's hard to recommend the Gage. I can't get past the schizophrenic mish-mash of sports bar, tourist magnet, fine dining prices, children yelling behind us, Irish pub wannabe. If you do go, make sure you request the server with the British accent and wild hair. He seems to be the only one who enjoys his job. And don't order the ""Chop Chop"" salad because it's a head of romain lettuce cut four times and sprinkled with a couple of tomatoes, teeny diced pepper and one sliver of cucumber."
"Went back to the Gage yesterday for a post-work drink with an old friend from NYC.  It was Cinco de Mayo, and we were concerned w/ attaining some margaritas..   I know what you're thinking.. ""Irish-type bar for Margaritas?""  The Gage did not disappoint. Their margaritas tasted fresh, and without all that acidic mix that some places overuse.  For food, we split an order of the Buffalo Frog's Legs (!) and the cheese plate.  The frog legs were suprisingly good!  Kind of tasted like a mix between chicken and the lightest seafood flavor.  The cheese plate featured 1 blue cheese, a goat cheese, a yellow sharp cheddar and one more that escapes me.  Each cheese was oriented on the cutting board across from something it was to be paired with.  The blue cheese got the cherry soda.. home made fizzy cherry juice. It was amazing!  The goat cheese got dried cherries.  The yellow got some roasted hazelnuts.  The other cheese (it was also a stinkier cheese, similar to blue) got this amazing cherry chutney stuff.The Gage is now officially 2 for 2.  One more excellent experience, and we're talking 5-star territory."
"Went here for an early pre-theatre dinner on a rainy and gloomy Sunday evening.  Well, it *was* a gloomy evening until we walked into the Gage!Instantly, my dining buddy and I loved the atmosphere.  It has a dark, rich, warm, and sexy feel.  The bar is lively, and the back room is romantic.  We were seated at one of the tables just behind the bar, which I thought was the best of both worlds.  I could watch TV out of the corner of my eye, but still got to sit at one of the lovely, formal tables.We chose not to drink, since the cocktails were very expensive and we had both been out drinking the night before.  We were starving, so we went right in for food....first, the Scotch Egg.  I'd heard a lot about this Egg, and I absolutely enjoyed it.  I think I liked it more for the creativity than the actual taste.  A Scotch Egg is a hard boiled egg, covered with a sausage mixture, coated in breadcrumbs and fried.  I loved the texture, and the aesthetic appeal, and I thought it tasted fine but the sausage mixture reminded me of breakfast sausage, of which I am not a fan.  It was, however, my boyfriend's favorite part of the meal. Next - fries with curry sauce.  Ohhhhhh so delightful.  seriously.  Curry must be served with fries at all restaurants from now on, it blows ketchup out of the water.  The fries were hot, thick, and crispy, and the sauce was perfectly spiced.  I want this to be my go-to snack for sporting events, movies, anytime anywhere.  Don't miss these.Then we split the seared New Bedford sea scallops.  They were well-prepared (in my opinion, my boyfriend is weird and likes them more rubbery).  I thought the texture was lovely, and I really enjoyed the leafy kale underneath.  I don't this dish was oozing with inspiration and creativity, but it was very tasty.We finished with the locally made sausage.  The dish came with two kinds of sausage - one short and fat, one long and thin.  Insert sexual innuendo here.  The shorter of the two sausages was absolutely outstanding....like close-your-eyes-and-savor-the-moment good.  I was a bit full by this point, so I think I'd sort of lost my taste for the brie potatoes, but normally that's something I'd be completely devouring.  When I lifted out a forkful, the melty cheese strands stretched out for inches - pretty as a picture.Service was mostly very good, with occasional weird lapses.  Usually we were well attended to, then we'd get our scallops dish and it sat there for 2-3 minutes before the waiter brought us clean forks.  Hmmm.  Still, I love any restaurant that clears silverware after each course - that's good service.All in all, great food and a great atmosphere -and the price is right (if you don't order booze).  I hope to come back here soon!"
"Delicious food from a thoughtful menu, with great drinks and service as its accompaniment."
"If you don't mind the touristy location, the Gage is a great place to stop for lunch when you're in the Loop on the weekends.  The BF & I were walking around downtown, looking to nosh on some food before heading off on our shopping excursion.  Because the Shamrock Shuffle had just ended and it was a freakishly warm 86-degree day on a Sunday, restaurants all around the area were really really busy...meaning at least an hour-long wait.  We headed to The Gage, where we were told that the wait for a table was going to be 10-15 minutes.  Jackpot!We sat at the bar and ordered drinks, deciding to just eat there instead of waiting for a table.  The house poutine was just as delicious as I remembered it to be...cheesy, meaty, saucy.  It is seriously the most delicious drunk or sober food ever.  The BF ordered the fire-roasted chicken, which had Frank's Hot Sauce all over it.  You can never go wrong with Frank's.  I had the roasted woodland mushroom sandwich with truffle aioli.  I'm usually a carnivore but this mushroom sandwich was AWESOME!  The mushrooms were nice and meaty and filling.  I definitely recommend the sandwich.No wait, delicious food at the bar with our cold beers...perfect meal at The Gage."
"Happening place at 5:30 for dinner before going to see Book of Mormon.  Pretty loud up front but seated towards the back where it was more quiet.  Waiter very experienced but gave Stepford-wife-like scripted explanation of the specials available.  Forgot alá carte side order (garlic mashed potato) until after we were finished with dinner.  Waiter gave half-hearted apology and offered nothing to correct screw-up.  Left hungry after dinner, a bottle of wine, and a $240 tab after tip."
"The set up is really nice, and the food was great. The service made the dinner though. Jane is incredibly attentive, energetic, sweet, and knew everything on the menu. Everything she recommended was fantastic. We had antelope tartar and tuna apps, and rabbit salad and duck for dinner, and everything was really tasty. I do not remember the names of the beer she recommended, but it was spectacular. Next time, I'll just have her pick out my next dinner. After my experience, I trust her blindly."
"I've been here for dinner twice. First time I got the risotto which was the color of kraft mac & cheese and sort of tasted like it -- not that great. The second time I had the restaurant week dinner, which was better. (I got the chicken thigh over the risotto, and this time the risotto was more like risotto.) Still, I think this place does drinks very well. I'd recommend going here for cocktails and maybe snacks. The dinner food is not really worth the price."
Was disappointed with the food for the price-point. The tables in the back are not fun. The beer selection was so-so. The waiter brought out a 22 oz substitute of a different kind when they were out-of-stock of the beer I wanted. I got the feeling that they emphasized quantity over quality. I couldn't stand the place enough to make it to dessert.
"Thank goodness my lunch partner was late, because it seriously took me over 10 minutes to narrow down what I wanted to order. They not only had a special Chef's Week menu, but the regular menu AND a brunch menu.  So of course I was forced* to order a Bloody Mary, just so I could calm my nerves and focus.  I ended up selecting, after much inner debate, the Traditional Irish Breakfast. Which offered Poached Eggs, Rashers, Black and White Puddings, Sausage, Tomato, Beans, and Toast. Sound like a lot? Oh yeah, it was. And thankfully I came prepared as I had been running around all morning and had only drank a single cup of coffee up to that point.  But, in a word, fantastic.  This is a meal that will set you up for the rest of the day.Darling lunch partner M had already decided to order the Chef Week menu, and everything that was presented was absolutely beautiful.  I assume delicious as well since not much was left over on her side either.  Excellent, attentive service by Kevin, a highly energetic but fun atmosphere, and a cozy, warm interior. What else do you need in life, really?*Ha, as if."
"The Gage is among my favorite places in Chicago.  I've been here alone, been here with my wife, and been here with several large groups.  Every time, I've had a good time.The menu: I've tried nearly everything on the menu and loved it all.  I will say that the Scotch Egg (bad for you, but oh so good) is one of my favorites and that's just an appetizer.  The food is only part of the story at The Gage.  The atmosphere is great.  The decor is gorgeous.  The noise level is typical for Chicago: Loud.  The service is inconsistent in a good way.  Every waiter is different, but great.  Some are very engaging and involved in the meal, while others are very unobtrusive.  All are very good at their job."
"I had been reading the reviews for this place for over a year and disappointed I did not go here sooner. Went there for lunch on the rainy Saturday of the air show. Wow! The food was unbelievable! Pork belly sandwich was probably the best sandwich I've ever had. You have to try it! Also, you must try the Gage N-17 Fondue. Can't wait to go back."
I love the Gage. I had the chilaquiles. It was delicious and just spicey enough. Paired with a delicious bloody mary I had a wonderful brunch. The service is also fantastic. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.
"The Gage is a great spot for lunch or for after-work drinks.  However, this review is being posted for one purpose only: to warn people against letting themselves be seated in the back room area!  I hate when they seat me here.  It's right by the kitchen and so you end up smelling like grease after sitting there for awhile.  I had to bring all my clothes to the dry-cleaner.  Make sure to request to NOT be back there when you make your reservation.  Actually, I shouldn't be telling you this, or I'll never get a good table again!  Ummmm you should request to be right next to the kitchen and the odor of grease wafting through the back area."
"I chose the Gage as a place to take an out-of-town friend as a representative Nice Dinner Out Downtown. I'd never been there myself but was pleased with the choice. Right within reach of the Art Institute, Millennium Park and other attractions in the Loop, the Gage occupies prime real estate on Michigan Avenue. Inside was dim, with glassed-in, separate rooms to make for quieter dining (although one diner in ours felt the need to talk at top volume). Our server, Zachary, was young but polished (though he initially startled me by lighting the tea candle for our table right in the corner of my peripheral vision) and did a fine job accomodating us and the other tables in the area with grace and balance. May I mention the food! The Gage has a whiff of the gastropub about it but isn't pretentious about the food (in other words, it doesn't arrive as a deconstruction or a tower, blasted with CO2 or in miniscule portion). I ordered the red wine roasted Amish chicken with cream-braised salsify (a root vegetable similar to parsnips), which was delicious, though the chicken came with some unnecessary, undressed baby greens on top that were either an overgrown garnish or an unfinished salad.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the salsify a surprise hit, tender and decadent with the cream. My friend had fish and chips, of which I had a bite: serviceable, not soggy, though with all the other wonderful-looking things to choose from on this menu this wouldn't have been my personal first pick.The one issue we had with dinner was the plates. Both of our meals came in oddly-shaped plates that were hard to cut in/on. Mine was an oval ramekin, several inches deep, which held the chicken and salsify; cutting down into this, especially maneuvers like slicing chicken off the bone, was awkward in this setup. My friend had a shallow rectangular dish for her fish and chips, but it had a lip that she kept hitting as she cut, which was difficult not to bump and made for slow going.For dessert we selected orange creme brulee; its sugar surface was perhaps just slightly undercaramelized (you didn't quite get the crisp crack but rather a bit of a bend to the spoon tip), but the intense orange scent and flavor were intoxicating. From the cocktail menu, I sampled the Gage Old Fashioned, which contained candied ginger and (oddly) nuts -- like, whole almonds floating in the glass. The ginger flavor intensified as I got to the bottom of the glass. Intriguing.The Gage was a good find for downtown dining. I'll be back."
"I really and truly do not understand the four star rating here. I don't know if it was the pretentious decor, light-on-the-liquor beverage or almost bland food but I thought this place was the pits. The service was fine. The waitstaff is very professional, with the exception of the bartender (more about that later). Our waitress was efficient, explained the daily special and checked in on us from time to time. And the supporting crew always kept our water glasses full and did everything by the book. But, I watched the bartender as she made my drink and she actually sniffed the shaker before she put it to my glass. Gross. And then she gave the drink such a weak-ass shake that I wondered why she even bothered. Also, the soda water was not carbonated. Therefore, it was not soda and my Jameson Ginger Fizz became a Jameson Ginger Flat. It tasted like crap but I didn't feel like complaining because my parents were footing the bill and we had just enjoyed an afternoon at The Art Institute. As for the food, ""The Gage"" burger was lackluster to say the least. The actual burger itself was tasty although it was more medium rare than medium (I chalk that up to a lazy or inexperienced chef). But the Camembert cheese is so mild that it really just lends a cheesy texture to the burger. The onion and orange marmalade kind of cancel out one another so that the whole combination is just pointless. AND, the iceberg lettuce and warm, mushy olives served with it were almost offensive. The fries were also bland. Everything was bland, bland, bland. I could, however, taste the tomato, raw onion, pickle and ketchup. Thank God for small favors. That's another thing. I feel for the dishwasher because everything came in its own separate dish. Pssst, Gage! Just because you put the fries in one dish, the ketchup in another and then put it all on a plate doesn't make it fancy. It just makes it silly. What I'm trying to say is, don't waste your money. There are way better restaurants in the city and you won't pay much more than you did at The Gauche, I mean The Gouge, I mean, well...I think you know what I mean."
Went for lunch. Had a spicy Bloody Mary and a reeeaaallllyyyyy good venison burger.
"It was a cold and rainy day.  After a long visit at the Art Institute, I was looking (a) for greater respite from the cold and wet, and (b) for a great place to eat.  This place was great for both.  Our server was really friendly and put up with my endless questions about his preferences, and even gave me one of the better recommendations I've ever gotten -- ""I usually hate mushrooms, but [this dish] was really good!""  He could have been full of it, but I ended up ordering the Roasted Woodland Mushroom Sandwich and a bowl of...I think Carrot Ginger soup, and my friend and I shared a side of cheesy potatoes (""Crisp Potatoes, Brie"").  I don't remember the soup being all that great, but the sandwich was really good -- I basically inhaled it.  And the cheesy potatoes were... mmmmmmm.  How can you go wrong with that combo?I will warn you, though, the place is a little on the fancier side.  I don't know that my wet umbrella and endless layers quite met up with their more white-tablecloth standards, but they were really nice about everything and mostly treated us well (I vaguely remember fairly long wait times...)  I'd go back :)"
"I came to The Gage again for dinner tonight and I decided I needed to give the place an extra star for good all-around food since there are so few options in the Loop.Our server was nice and very attentive, helpfully pointing out that we might have a ""french fry overload"" since we ordered the poutine with our Gage burgers (which already came with fries).  I knew that I had to have the poutine, so I switched my french fries for a side salad.The poutine was ok.  I wish they had left off the elk ragout and added more cheese curds!  The elk was a little too gamey for my taste and though I like the gravy on poutine, I don't like actual chunks of meat.Our burgers were good though, same as last time.  Very juicy and way to big to eat cohesively, so we ended up eating ours with silverware.  The side salad that came with my burger was even better, with raisins, grapes, and lots of blue cheese.Though stuffed, we decided to split the ""coffee and donuts"" dessert.  It was a good choice - little donut holes topped with cinnamon sugar mixed with little balls of fried chocolate ganache, all poured with a coffee syrup.  Delicious and great for sharing.Our waiter was really good and non-intrusive, but the busboys were sort of like vultures, hovering over our table every other minute to take dishes away or check our water glasses.  Oh well.  Anyway, I had a great time, and it's a solid choice for dinner."
Overall good food and beer selection. I stopped in while I was in town at a conference. THe service was good but not great. A bit slow. The food was good but not great as well. I was expecting much more from this place but I would go back.
"I love this place.  It's always packed, so don't go hungry.  But the food and atmosphere are both great for drinks or any meal."
"Absolutely the best Old Fashioned ever. I travel a lot and always order an Old Fashioned when I try new bars. The Gage has the best Old Fashioned of any place I've ever tried, without a doubt."
Came here for brunch on a Saturday.  Food was excellent!  Had a big group with me so we all pretty much tried each others dishes and didn't have anything bad to say.  Service was excellent and the place is nice.  Not sure if i'd ever go back but if i'm in the area i'd definitely would remember this place and go.
"""You've never been to the Gage?!? I have been hearing statement quite frequently from friends, co-workers, even my hairstylist. So when my husband and I were free last Friday - we figured, this is it. THIS is the night we're going to go to the Gage. So we did. And we elbowed our way through the masses to the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail. And we stood there for over an hour - getting bounced by waiters walking by and couples on first dates canoodling. The bar space was not fit to handle the amount of Friday night patrons waiting to get seated. I was disappointed by the tiny specialty cocktail list. The Gage Cocktail I ordered, which I assume to be the signature drink, was below average. Anyways, they were late seating us for our reservation. However, the manager did offer to comp our next round of drinks for being so patient. Thank you, Mr. Manager. At this point - we were famished. We had seen a lot of trays with mussels during our wait, so we figured that would be a good start to the meal. It was a solid choice; the mussels were awesome in a tasty broth that I almost drank out of the bowl. I ordered the Duck Confit based on the high praise from the waitress. My husband got the Fish and Chips. Both entrees were okay. I certainly I didn't think the duck was worthy of the rave recommendation. And the Fish & Chips tasted like your typical bar food. Perhaps we ordered wrong. Perhaps the Gage has been so highly talked up by people that it just couldn't meet our expectations. Either way, we left slightly bummed. Moral of the story: Order the mussels. Avoid the bar crowd masses."
"Yea, the Gage is expensive. I see a lot of chirping about that throughout these reviews. But for a business lunch in the loop... this place is perfect. It's got a unique (and rotating) beer menu, some top notch gastropub fare and some great ambiance/decor.Quick tip, you wanna present yourself well in front of your client? Order the brisket sandwich. Its not as messy as it sounds. You eat it with a knife and fork (thus keeping yourself presentable) and damn, it's a fine sandwich. The rest of your party will be jealous."
"Better bring a charge code or plan to order a cheeseburger - this place was pricey for good  but not great gastropub food. My friend and I stopped by for dinner on a Wednesday night and promptly got a table amid the corporate crowd unwinding at the bar. We split an appetizer, some fried chickpeas concoction the chef was evaluating for the menu. It was nice, but not worth the 5 bites we each got for $10. Being starving grad school students and not wanting to blow our budgets, we each ordered the modestly priced cheeseburger. It was tasty and big enough to be also be my lunch the following day. Would have loved to have tried some of the other options on the menu but being $20+ for an entree felt spendy, although as a local, I forget this is near tourist central."
"Excellent food and location for lunch.  As others have mentioned, this is a place to see and be seen.  They have a patio right on Michigan Avenue that gives you the feeling you're in a private area. I had their stawberry soup (!!) and turkey sandwich.  Both were excellent.Service was great.  I will return.  Hopefully soon."
"Great location: right across from Millenium Park and stone's throw away from The Palmer House. I went on a Sunday night, and it was pretty low key. The blonde bartender lady was super awesome, and we ended up talking about rifles for a while! This place isn't the cheapest, but the food is pretty good. I  had the venison burger, and it was delicious. Definitely try out the mashed potatoes."
"The service was great. I just had a ginger ale but my friend's cocktail was delicious. We both ordered fish and chips and the fries were very good, but the fish was just ok. A little too bland, not crispy enough, and the fish's texture was not succulent, it was a little flakey/stringy (not the good kind of flakey)."
"We had the mussels, which were definitely our favorite. The duck was delicious; it came with a crepe!  The scotch egg was my least favorite but definitely was not bad. Also throughout the night we had the oysters, caramelized lobster, sea bass special, and two desserts (chocolate mousse and some kind of pumpkin doughnut.)  The doughnuts were amazing as they came with sugared pumpkin seeds.(?)  Both of the desserts came with very surprising, yet delicious, ice cream.  One had old-fashioned flavored ice cream and the other was popcorn flavored.  The Brooklyn drink (the Gage's take on a Manhattan) was veryyyy good.  Overall, we tried many things on the menu and do not have a bad thing to say about any single one of them.  It was the best meal that I have ever had."
"""Most dates end at the Gage, but here were are starting our day here."" he said on that fateful trip. Its posh.  Its a place to be seen.  Its close to tourist attractions but doesn't have the huge sign to garner a tremendous amount of traffic.  But gets a ton of traffic.Inside is a very metropolitan bar.  It's exactly what one would expect in just about any upscale downtown bar.  Drinks are pricey.  And while they do have some old fashioned cocktails, the fact that they didn't have an aviation available was a bit disheartening.When I think about this place I envision corporate suits like my dad hobnobbing and going there to be seen by younger women that may or may not be pushing 30.  And while it was beautiful, nothing about this resonated with me enough to scream that I absolutely had to go here again."
"Used to go here after work occasionally when I lived in Chicago.  It is one of the best spots for happy hour in the loop (perhaps the BEST spot in the East Loop).  It has the best burger in Chicago, too (The Gage burger, not the $10 option they also serve).  Would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Chicago looking for ""New American"" cuisine without having to totally break their bank.  GET THE BURGER."
"A friend recommended this place and I have to say, I'm incredibly impressed.  Be careful, though, the portions are decently-sized.  We had thought that the starters would be pretty small - nope!Anyway, the poutine was ok but nothing out of the ordinary, as was the whitefish.  The clams with masala sauce were very good, especially if you got a lot of sauce on them.  The standouts to me were the sweet potato soup and duck.  The duck was among the best dishes I've ever had - amazing!"
"Hands down to probably one of the best Fish and Chips place in Chicago. Their batter is crisp and the fish nicely cooked. If you come here, that's probably what you should always go for. The rest is just ok.Must Get: Fish & Chips.Also, maybe it's cuz this place is an english pub/restaurant, but everyone's wearing a dress shirt. I guess I missed the memo when I went? :-D"
"We enjoyed a wonderful lunch here after an afternoon in the Art Institute. The fish and chips were perfect, the brisket sandwich delicious, and the beer list interesting and fairly extensive--with a number of local options. Our waiter, Gregory, also provided wonderful service, and the fireplace, tin ceilings, and exposed brick lent the whole scene a cozy atmosphere. We also loved the unpretentious, friendly tone of the menu and staff; all in all, it's a great restaurant, and we will definitely return for dinner."
"I'd return just for the elk poutine. Sorry Montréalers, you need to come see how it's done at The Gage. Amazing.Apart from that, good ambiance and service, good wine list, and the rest of the food was good quality as well."
"I went here for lunch on a weekday and sat at one of the high-tops (tables were all reserved).  The interior is nice but nothing too far removed from some of the older pub / restaurants in the loop area.I ordered the spicy black bean soup to start.  It tasted like Campbell's black bean soup with a little hot sauce... no meat or texture to it at all.  I ordered the ""Gage Burger"" as my main thinking signature dish would change my mind.  It was a regular burger with some sautéed onions on top.  The burger was boring and the fries were average.Everything from start to finish was just OK - maybe dinner is a better experience but I don't understand the hoopla.  I could go to any bar in Chicago and get an equal dish for cheaper."
"After visiting the museum, my friend and I went to get dinner at The Gage just across the street. I'd only been to The Gage once and it was just for an hour-long cocktail reception, so I was excited to give it a try. We split Vindaloo Mussels with toast, long toast, and Chips (Fries) with Curry Gravy. Oh, and we also got Duck Fat Nuts for an appetizer. I don't know exactly what this means. They just tasted like nuts. I liked the vindaloo mussels, but with the curry gravy, it was too much curry. We ended up getting ketchup for the fries."
"Had great meal before a show.  Loved the steak salad (who would think grilled lettuce so yummy).  The venison burger was great too.  One in our party wasn't feeling well and barely touched his food.  The waiter and manager noticed, made sure everything was ok with the meal and when the bill came had removed that entree.  Excellent service."
"Gage's mussels stimulated my Kegel muscles last night. Cooked to divine perfection, served in a sauce that was almost euphoric. You may want to eat these in private..."
"I love this spot for a business lunch.  I have been multiple times and have never been disappointed with the food nor the service.  It is a little on the pricier side, so I prefer to go here when it's business but I have spent my own money and not felt bad about it *wink*.The booths in the front are the most comfortable seating mainly because the tables towards the back are on the small side and smushed together pretty close.  It's hard to have a private conversation in such close quarters. Food-wise, the scotch egg for starters is to die for, even though I feel my arteries clogging with each bite of sausagey-eggy goodness.  Their soups are always a good way to go as well - I have enjoyed hot and cold soups depending on the season.  For main courses, all of the sandwiches are good but I like to try the specials.  Most recently (a couple weeks ago), I had a salmon special and it was served with the freshest asparagus and cooked very nicely - the right texture.  For dessert, I had the peanut butter Beignets (also on my most recent visit) and wow - sinful, delicious, thank you.  Overall, for lunch this is a great alternative, especially for business related gatherings."
"What a surprise! This place is a classy American diner, and it fits in so well with Michigan Ave.We started our meal with the Scotch Egg...it had incredible potential but it was fairly over-salted and un-flavorful for a sausage covered egg. The Beet Salad though was fantastic, with great colors and presentation along with the sweetness of beet and citrus.The hand roasted Brisket Sandwich is open faced and absolutely delicious! The Salmon Sandwich my girlfriend ordered was also equally great, both came with delicious fries. Overall if you focus on the sandwiches, you should really have a great meal."
"Consistently good lunches. I've only been for dinner once and probably wouldn't trek back downtown for dinner here again, but this is a go-to lunch spot for me when I want to meet friends or conduct lunch meetings with coworkers. The sandwich selection is great, the soup of the day is always unique and tasty, and the service is prompt. Definitely one of the better options in this area of the loop."
"Decent food for brunch, very good service.  I have only been here a couple of times and only for brunch.   Brunch will run you from 10-20/person and you will be able to choose from slightly fancied versions of standard breakfast/brunch dishes.   I think the food is decent, but it is nothing special.  For the value, I can only rate it 3 stars.I will note that the service and atmosphere are both worth noting positively.   Service is always quick and attentive.   The atmosphere and decor is pretty upscale."
"The Gage always delivers and the food, service, and drinks never disappoint  the menu is truly unique and innovative if not terribly approachable.  The antelope was a welcome surprise. Try it ! The duck is also a standout."
"Just the right combo of food, wine, service and good company led to a great meal.  I had my doubts with the Michigan avenue address but the amped up bar food in a classic bar environment was just what we were looking for.  Server was fully engaged and guided us through the meal; enhancing our choices with a few of his own.   Busy, loud and a bit late in seating us, but should be expected on a Saturday night."
"The food was very good, the service was even better. There is a fairly decent variety on the menu at this venu. Some of it fairly ecclectic and some of it just good ol comfort food, a nice mix. That said, I have to say my favorite was the Chopin Martini...THEY HAND STUFF THEIR OLIVES...and they don't use the super briney olives either. I came here for dinner with a fairly large group and everything was quite delightful. I would come back again. Keep in mind it does get busy, so the noise level can get a bit loud. Other than that, enjoy!"
"This is an old review I never finished but feelings are still the same:Top-notch dining experience. I shared an array of awesome first & second starters with a friend including the infamous Scotch Egg, bison tartare, rabbit salad (even better the next day!) ... honestly, we got too much. The food, drinks, service & ambience are ALL fantastic. The whole package - its location on Michigan Ave. was sort of misleading but trust me, this is not a tourist trap."
"The Gage is a very popular ""gastropub"" located across from the always-fun Millennium Park. The location is recycled from a group of buildings by the noted architecture firm Holabird & Roche, with part of its facade designed by star architect Louis Sullivan. He was known to be a fan of drink, so he may have appreciated this setting for a refined bite to eat along with a fine glass or two. The tables seem to be always crowded, so you may be relegated to the bar or to the basement area. If you are fortunate enough, dining in the packed and mirrored main dining room may put you in the mindset of being in a French Impressionist painting by Manet. The Gage seems to be the perfect place to slowly enjoy a frothy glass of Guinness. The poutine is a fancy pile of fries with cheese curds, something one might expect to consume in Quebec. The sausage platter is tasty with brie potato, though after a few bites this upscale version of bangers and mash can get a bit too meat-centric. This place ain't cheap, but your best ""budget"" bet is the ""Regular"" burger with fries."
"I met my boyfriend in the bar here after a class I was taking up the road. We had two salads, the fava bean appetizer, the gnudi, the beignets, and drinks. I was fairly impressed by the number of vegetarian selections on the menu, which you don't always expect at a place like this. Our server was Nicole and she struck us as knowledgeable, skilled, personable, and all-around charming. The salads were quite good. The fava bean dip was better than it had a right to be. The gnudi, sort of like gnocchi but not made out of potatoes, was good, but maybe not $19 good. The mushrooms, fiddleheads, and peas were very fresh though and the parmesan broth generally brought it all together.The beignets were sinful. They were served with blueberries, ice cream, white chocolate, and something involving pop rocks. Next time we're getting the fondue. We're also probably getting about six orders of beignets."
"Love the Gage.  My wife and I went here during restaurant week.  I had the fish and she had the chicken... both were great.  For appetizers I had the hot pot which was awesome.  Wife had the quinoa salad, quite fresh and tasty.  Dessert was divine. We've been to the Gage a good number of times.  Very good gastropub food, a nice mix of bar classics and slightly higher end American fare.  The chef is adventurous and creative... the beer selection and cocktail selection is to die for.  Tonight I had some Wooky Rye IPA which was great, as well as the Revolution IPA, the rotating Half Acre, and a glass of the Inniskillin Icewine to finish.  The decor is great.  Tile on the floors, tile on the walls.  The downstairs and bathroom are particularly notable.  Classic Chicago.If we had a complaint it's that service can be a little slow.  Bartenders and servers are great... it's just that the food can take a bit of time.  But that's okay because we like the place so much.Of course, we will go back."
"Having enjoyed dining at the Gage before, working at Michigan and Randolph has made the Gage a standby. A just-pretentious-enough restaurant with a diverse menu, energetic dining room and great staff, I have yet to be disappointed by any of my choices at this great Dirk Flanigan location.  The service is also great, though a few of the more haughty waiters take a few times at the Gage to warm up to you.  If you get the one garrulous Irish waiter, then you are in for a fantastic meal.The food is consistently excellent, with their best offerings honestly coming from the simple concepts that they hit out of the park.  My personal favorite on their menu is the fish and chips - the fish is always perfect and the breading crisp.  Other highlights include the waygu sirloin salad, the roasted woodland mushrooms, the fries with curry sauce, the tilapia every time they've had it on special, and their very generous pours of wine in very large glasses.Do yourself a favor and stop in."
"I'm totally coming back.I'll admit - the service was a little weird. Our waiter wasn't particularly welcoming, but he was attentive enough to let that slide.Everything on the menu looked absolutely delicious. My friend and I both decided to go a little overboard and order cheeseburgers. The burgers were flavorful and juicy, just how I like them, with the juice practically soaking through the bun, and the fries were too good to stop. The burgers also came with large (I'm talking half a cucumber) fresh pickles which were oh so good. We discovered a stylish downstairs lounge on our way to the bathroom, so we'll definitely be back for happy hour as soon as I start working."
Went with my fiance and sister for restaurant week and had a wonderful time. They had a great Prix Fixe set up.  They dealt with our changing of table well.  Service was on top of things and did very well with the coursing. Our server was very good with a odd special requests. Food at perfect timing. Had a wonderful time and I would suggest this restaurant to my friends for sure!
"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. The chef is incredibly creative. They were very accommodating of my vegetarian needs; I had the parsnip agnosttini (spelling?) which was delicious even though I had no idea what most of the ingredients were. Definitely cannot miss the fried pickles or the daily cheese selection. The staff was very friendly. Overall great experience, I will definitely be returning."
"Wonderful classy gastropub.Good wine and beer selection, I got a very good measure of whisky too!Roast Chicken was excellent, mash was very buttery...Friendly staff and reasonable $$$ make it a winner."
"If you want a romantic candlelight dinner, I assure you this is not the place - unless you believe being deaf to your loverès voice is considered an asset. When we first entered the restaurant at 9 pm, the place was at least 90 decibels. My hearing may never been the same again.The maitre d was kind enough to notice our discomfort with the noise and offered us seating further away from the ruckus which was very kind however it did not help.You know you are not in for a good evening when the best dish you can recommend is the salad. The mixed field green salad with muskat grapes and tomatoes was good. But beyond that, there was little to recommend. The bread arrived warm but with a too hard outer crust and salty. The poutine with elk gravy and cheese curd was too salty and there was not enough crispness to the fries which rendered the dish too soggy to be enjoyed. The potato and semolina dumplings which were like mini polenta gnocchi were too bland and gummy for the sauce. The duck confit and foie gras was alternatively both too salty and bland if you can believe it (yeah... they can make foie gras bland!).I really do believe that the chefs do not taste the outcome of the dishes in the kitchen.This is a place that tries very hard to elevate pub food from its origins however, it needs to focus on making the flavoring of the food edible before it can begin to meet this aspirations."
"Late night drinks and appetizers after the ballet in early February. We were quickly seated and drinks were ordered, Very good beer and wine by the glass selection. We ordered a cheese plate, the house burger with all the toppings and an order of chips. It was all very good, We loved the places atmosphere and will come back and try a full dinner. The one star deduct was for dust We were seated at the booth just past the bar on the right, and as I looked down the bar out towards Mich Ave I could see the side and back of the flat screen that hung over the corner of the bar. The back of the TV and the wires leading to it had a thick coat of built up dust, sorry, not very attractive."
"**THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BAR ONLY**Hands down, the best drinks I have ever had. The bartenders are absolutely incredible. I had a Manhattan plus two drinks off of the seasonal menu (the Porch Swing and a Pear drink). The drinks are perfectly balanced, fresh, innovative, and delicious. I would've gone for a fourth drink.. but someone would've had to carry me out ;)And yes, the drinks are pricey, but they're the same prices you'd pay at theWit or the Signature Lounge, and definitely worth it."
"This place serves the best poutine in chicago I have tried! I was craving a burger the night I came and was told by our waiter that the burger was one of the best I will ever try. He was not joking. The burger was delicious! Great ambiance, I will def come back for a burger and poutine fix."
"I've eaten at The Gage a couple times and not been dissappointed.On my latest visit, my wife and I had lunch during Restaurant Week.  I had the 3-course special and my wife had fish and chips.  She took the mixed green salad that came with the special and I had a Scotch egg.  A Scotch egg is a hard-boiled egg, surrounded by crumbled sausage, breaded, and deep fried.  I'd been wanting to try this dish for awhile, and it was delicious!  The salad with blue cheese, dried cherries, pecans, and honey balsamic vinigrette was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary.For my entree, I chose the arctic char with marble potatos, celery, fennel, and cauliflower fume.  This was a great piece of fish!  The meat was moist & flavorful while the skin was crisp and delicate.  The shaved fennel really added to the overall flavor of the fish.  My wife's fish and chips were good.  Moist pieces of cod in a light batter with very good fries, but no comparison to the arctic char.The only dessert for the special was a pistachio panna cotta.  This was perfect!  I love pistachio and if it's on the menu, I'm more than likely going to order it.  It was moist & creamy and full of pitachio flavor.  The best dessert I've had in a long time!The service was very good also.  Drinks and water were refilled quickly and the waitress was very pleasant and friendly.  The Manager even stopped by to make sure everything was going well.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Gage to anyone."
"I went back and forth on my rating for The Gage between 3 and 4 stars because I wanted to be honest and admit that Gage isn't perfect, but, you know what? I really really like this place. Admittedly it is crazy-expensive, and, truthfully the food is nothing spectacular, but, all that aside, I love the atmosphere and vibe of The Gage. There's something cozy about it, and it's a great late night spot for drinks. It's great for drinks anytime, really, but late night was my favorite time to be there. The food isn't anything spectacular, but I did love the smoked salmon appetizer and the fish & chips, and the burgers. When they first opened they had the most delicious, decadent, savory side dish on the menu: goat cheese risotto with escargot..heaven!! I'm guessing they discontinued that dish because diners were immediately rushed to the ER for a bypass after consuming.I really went there for the drinking scene and the drinks themselves. One of their signature drinks, the Maestro, was my 2nd top favorite behind a greyhound with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. The combination of mashed strawberries with maple syrup and (shock!) balsamic vinegar made for a delightful concoction.I haven't been there since our move from the area, but, it's the type of place that I think of fondly and will make a point of visiting when I'm in the area."
"You can't go wrong with The Gage because it's whatever you want to make of it. If you're looking for a nice bar with an awesome beer, whiskey and wine list? They have it. Casual bite to eat from the Starter menu? Can't go wrong. The food is always excellent and it simply has the feel of a place that is urban upscale...but relaxed enough that you're going to be more than fine in jeans. The Gage consistently puts out excellent, locally-raised food that will be flavorful enough for even the most discerning foodies...but delicious and accessible enough for anyone looking for a flat out amazing meal, special occasion or not."
"I was in Chicago for a conference and was told by another attendee about her wonderful experience at Gage, so my colleague and I decided to check it out. What a great dining experience, due in great part to our fantastic server, Will. I love when I can try a restaurant for the first time and totally trust in the recommendations of the staff. From the surprisingly refreshing Stealer's Wheel scotch cocktail (who knew I could love scotch??)  to the delicious fried pickles with spicy aioli dipping sauce, to a light and flaky halibut that melted on the tongue, I found each dish unique and wonderful. By the time we got to dessert, we just asked Will to ""surprise"" us, trusting in his expert advice, which led to our sharing a little bit of heaven known as the cream cheese mousse."
"The Gage holds a decent St. Patrick's Day party. We had some delicious Gage mini-sliders, mini fish and chips, and some other random hors d'oeurves that weren't too memorable. The bartenders were attentive and mellow, and overall, I had a great time despite the fact the space is in the basement of the building (i.e. no view).Since then I've made enough trips to warrant a real review.One of the classier joints to frequent south of Madison Avenue, the Gage keeps a good price range on their menu. You can pick a few small dishes to nibble or do a progression. Having the subtle delineation of first/second/third/fourth to indicate whether a plate is ""snack-sized"" or entrée-sized is very helpful when going in a group, especially if the sight of some $40 entrées is a bit intimidating.The Gage's wine list begins at a higher price point of around $40. And they have, on occasion, run out of the first wine my group's requested. They have mastered the $12 martini though, especially for a Michigan Ave/Millenium Park spot.There are some perks to being an upscale Elephant and Castle. For starters, they have classic fallbacks that are consistently great. The Gage Burger and Fish and Chips are always satisfying (and on the cheaper end of the entrées!)  The Elk Saddle with ricotta and rhubarb to contrast well as mild salt/sweet, is a superb dinner if you feel like shelling that much out. Unfortunately, saddle's not the only reflection of their elk preparation.Poutine: gravy, cheese curds and fries, with an elk ragout enticing me as a catalyst, disappointed as an oversalted ""snack"". Screwing up salt is always a no-no. As for sides, the brie potato is as rich as it sounds, and nice and crisp. On seconds: I was quickly disillusioned with their Smoked Haddock Cake and Peekytoe Crab. The breading was half salt, while the afterthought of lemon crème fraiche and caviar weren't the best. The mussels with vindaloo are savory and succulent though, and a better seafood pick. Rabbit was seasoned really well, as was the caramelized lobster. Both of these dishes rock this part of the menu.When it came to dessert, the peanut butter beignets immediately drew my eye. I love beignets, and the play on PB&J was charming and effective. French toast? Not so much.With the emergence of so many other gastropubs recently, the Gage has too much volatility in its menu for me to rate it well. It's not even about the unwarrantedly high price point. Their hits and misses are equally strong, and they really need to work on their salt issue; it's an elementary skill to master."
"Met a friend for lunch at 11am. Place was nearly empty, but by the time we left around 1:15 it was completely packed. So, make reservations! LOVED the brie-based fondue. It was very good, and a must-order if you go. We also split the turkey sandwich which really didn't do it for me. Like others have mentioned about the burgers, the sandwich was very messy, and the bread was extremely dry."
"Excellent atmosphere.Good service.Vegetarian Semolina = quite tasty.I was thinking about the elk, but then I remembered I don't eat meat.  And for goodness sakes it's an ELK.  But really.  It was good. :)"
Good gastropub but a bit pricey... to be expected given location. It is what it is.
The crispy potatoes with Brie is really good! They're highly addictive.
"I went here last night for dinner with a couple girlfriends that came in from out of town. I have been to the gage a many times and have always had a positive experience! I live right off of Michigan ave and the location is a great place for a girls night out! unfortunately last night I cannot say the same. The staff was stuck up and just rude. we ordered the mussels with ""toast"", marinated olives, scotch egg, and the gage burger to start the whole experience reminded us of a cheese cake factory which really didn't blow my friends away. I am sad to say I feel the quality has changed and I will probably be looking for a new go to spot. I was embarrassed because I had been raving about this restaurant to my friends."
"I have wanted to try the gage since we moved to Chicago in September. I won't say I was disappointed, but I will say it didn't meet my expectations. The food was good, our server was knowledgable, but the actual service was slow and awful. It is amazing how service can really make or break a dining experience, but when you wait for 20+ minutes to even place an order for food and drinks (not to mention how long it took to actually get or drinks or place an order for a second beverage) you know your in for an evening of pretty poor service.We came for restaurant week (maybe that's why we got such terrible service?), and the food was delicious. Don't order the bitter lettuce salad unless you're into that sort of thing - I misread it as 'butter lettuce' my mistake.Still gave it 3 stars because I enjoyed the food. Probably won't return unless I sit at the bar."
"This was my first time visiting The gage and overall it was a great experience. I must say the decor is amazing, I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant., great for meeting up with friends or even a date night.I ordered the fish and chips and good, I have had better but not in the Chicago, so it's worth ordering and trying out.One thing that didn't really care for was how over sized the menu was, I am not talking about the items on the menu but more so how the actual size of the menu was hard to place on the table before ordering. At one point I stuck my menu behind me, against the chair because it was so in the way. One other thing was maybe our waitress what having a bad night, but she wasn't the most friendly and I suppose not very excited to be there- which right off the bat I noticed . But in her defense- she made sure i was never left dry of beer. :)"
"I recommended we dine here to celebrate our friend's birthday because I've enjoyed every dining experience I've had here.  Party of 6 on a Saturday night-- 5 pastry students and my boyfriend, a culinary student.  Naturally we all love food and are very particular about what we eat.We ordered all the items on the shared appetizers (minus the foie gras, chicken livers, and scotch egg) and shared a nice bottle of white wine.  Nothing really stood out.  All I can remember was the tasty curry fries.  You must order the curry fries.  The entree I order was delicious!--that i can clearly remember.  My boyfriend and I agree that it was one of the best pork chops I've ever ordered.  It was so juicy, perfectly seared and cooked.  We ordered ALL the items on the dessert men--come on, what else can you expect from 5 pastry students?  The desserts were hit or miss.  We liked some, we hated some.  They have changed the dessert menu since my last review some 2 years ago.  Back then I fell in love with Gage after having the deconstructed root beer float.  Anyway, desserts were all comped--i'm not sure whether it was because our table was very chatty with our server or because we told her to say hello to the pastry chef for us.It was a good night.  We had a great time.  I left around 11pm but the rest of the party stayed until the bar closed around 2:30am.  This is definitely a place to go with a large party.  There is something for everyone on the menu."
"I had a magnificent meal here a few weeks ago with family and some out of town work colleagues of my father. Everyone LOVED the food, and trust me, there was a lot of it! Everything was just perfect.We were there on a week night and it was pretty crowded and loud, but the atmosphere was perfect for what we needed. Friendly, prompt service. Prices are moderate to high, but well worth it. And, considering the area, the prices are quite reasonable. Extra points for having craft beer selections on the menu. :)"
"This place is awesome! I absolutely love the decor in this old millinery, just feels super cool and cozy! The food ahhhhmazing!! Definitely try the house burger, mushroom sandwich and the poutine.  And make sure you get 50 sides of the truffle sauce, cuz its that good!!!"
Not too much more needs to be said about The Gage.It's amazing. The food is incredible. Their beer menu is wonderful. The wine menu is even more wonderful.The service is amazing and the environment is industrial chic. I love The Gage and I would eat there every night if I made enough money.
I was looking for somewhere close to my hotel that served great desserts. The concierge suggested The Gage. Wow!  We had great service and great desserts. Our waitress Katie was top flight. If you are looking for good food and great service this is the place to go.
"Had dinner here one night with friends during my recent trip to Chicago, food was good (but nothing to write home about), service was polite & friendly. But I really thought that for the ambiance & food it....was a bit overpriced."
"Please go here.  Yes, it is a little pricey, but it is well worth it.  I had the brisket and could not stop raving about it!  So many different flavors, all put together perfectly.  Oh man, I am still dreaming about this sandwich a week later!"
"One of my top 10 restaurants in the US.I went here a few years ago and was impressed, so I returned again when I was back in town.Great cocktails - we all had the Jameson and ginger beer cocktail on special.Great food - we split small plates. The brie fondue is AMAZING - ask for extra bread. The pot roast poutine far exceeded expectations, and desert was outstanding.Great ambiance and service. A server removed our fondue after we had asked for more bread, when our server realized what happened, he bought us a desert despite protests. If you're in Chicago, you must go to the Gage. If I lived here, it'd be a regular spot."
"When I lived in the old building on Randolph, once in awhile I'd see a woman out walking her teacup Yorkie when I was walking my little angel faced Schnauzer baby woof pup (rest easy, Heidi).  We'd exchange a quick hi but nothing more.After I moved and the little angel face was in dog heaven, I was at the Old St. Pat's fest when a woman in a Rolling Stones concert t-shirt asked me if I was the guy who used to walk his little dog over on Randolph in the park.  Why, yes.  It turns out she was the woman with the teacup Yorkie.  I didn't recognize her with her weight loss.  So we talked a bit and exchanged numbers.  And she would henceforth be known as ""Rolling Stones.""  Some time later, I ended up meeting Rolling Stones at The Gage for dinner.  That's when I discovered the $15 (or somewhere in that vicinity) burger.  Right.  Fifteen bucks.  I was sort of forced to go with the burger because the menu at The Gage teems with fish.  I felt silly, but I went with it.  She got the fish and chips, with the fish wrapped up in newspaper (or faux newspaper).  Anyway, I thought everything was alright but not really conducive to my picky palate.  I've also been to The Gage solely for drinking, including a recent Friday.  Wow, this place was jumping.  All of the tables and every bar seat were occupied.  The clientele kind of reminded me of Tavern on Rush, only with more class and less trash and a nice selection of eye candy.  At my latest visit, which was limited due to a party we needed to go to, I had a couple of the new Victoria beers they had on tap.  I'd read somewhere online about this new beer coming to the area.  They served it up in what I believe were 20-ounce glasses.  Tasty.  The only problem was that with no seats at the bar we felt like we were constantly in the way and being brushed against because the area between the bar and the first set of bar tables is a major thoroughfare for guests and, especially, servers and bus crew.  I can't really detract any points for this minor inconvenience though.  I'll definitely be back for a pint or two of some sort, possibly Victoria, and the good ambiance.  Four stars.P.S.  Rolling Stones was only two dates.  She was more Some Girls than Satisfaction, Honky Tonk Women or She was Hot.  But we're cool.  Good to have an S.A. on your side, if necessary."
"My boyfriend and I decided to go to the Art Institute on a Thursday evening, and after consulting Yelp, decided to try this place for dinner afterwards. There aren't a whole lot of options in the area for dinner that aren't super touristy.Making reservations couldn't have been easier for 8:15p on a Thursday. The place seemed full when we got there, but we were still seated right away. The space is huge, actually! Tons of tables. But thanks to smart room divisions, the area we were in felt cozy.The service was excellent, and we didn't feel rushed through our appetizer and drinks, which I appreciate (especially given how busy they were, and apparently usually are). No hint of snootiness here. I had some kind of sage martini, which was delicious and quite strong. My bf really liked his old fashioned, too.We got poutine for an appetizer, which was surprisingly good, and both ordered burgers (maybe not the most balanced meal). The burgers were very good and huge (we both took half home). You could get a similar burger lots of places, but for the atmosphere, location, and quality of the rest of the menu, I was happy.One other note - it was quite loud inside. We didn't have trouble hearing each other, but you definitely had to speak up."
"I will always love you Chicago (my second home) and I will always have a stomach for The Gage, I love the food...The atmosphere and the staff. Thank you for the amazing dining and social experience."
"A wide variety of different types of food on the menu.  Appetizers look more appealing than entrees.  Unfortunately, execution was lacking.4 adults, including yours truly, came here last Saturday during restaurant week.  It was packed, and it was 915pm!!We ordered:-scotch egg (2 orders)-roasted beet salad-house poutine-fried chicken livers-oyster selection-foie gras and eel terrine-tartare of bison-caramelized lobster-wagyu sirloin-3 bottles of wine (Tenuta Dell'Ornellaia) and a bottle of champagneThe good -The house poutine was the tastiest item we ordered which says a lot.  It's french fries covered with gravy (elk ragout) and melted cheese curds.The roasted beet salad was tasty, seasond well and the beets themselves were naturally sweet...but maybe that's because I love everyhting about beets.  Perhaps they could use heirloom beets rather than the standard beet next time to keep it a little more exciting.The meh -Having never had a scotch egg before I was eager to try the hard-boiled egg, covered in sausage, then rolled in batter and deep fried.  Sounded lovely!  It was indeed easy on the tongue, but it did not WOW.  Thank goodness for the stone-ground mustard, otherwise this dish would be dull. One suggestion would be soft-boil the egg rather than hard-boil it.  But perhaps that would ruin the integrity of the dish...or it would be greatly enhanced!Tartare of bison was missing some bite...maybe some mustard or a more shallot or something.  I enjoyed the texture of the lean bison but be prepared that it was a little more chewy than a regular steak or tuna tartare.The foie gras and eel terrine was delightful but the eel skin around the outside was a little ...uh-hem... slimy.The bad - Wagyu sirloin was the most disappointing of all. Perhaps they used US-raised wagyu or perhaps they substituted in a filet for the wagyu, either way, it was less than stellar and overall unimpressive.If I didn't comment on a dish, it's because it wasn't particularly memorable or even worth writing about.Overall, it had good ideas but the execution was off."
"We did not get enough food. Yes, it was a time thing and all that but after two bites of my Scotch egg (before my dining companion arrived), I knew that whatever beautiful goodness lived in there, there was no way I was going to be able to sample all that lied in wait on the rest of the menu. And we're talking LUNCH!The warm bread and salty butter. The Scotch egg with the grainy mustard. The pickles and olives. Oh the pickles and olives. The house-made apple cider. The giant, ginormous, ridiculously huge, stacked salmon club. The equally ridiculously ginormous and huge pork belly sandwich. Oh and the service! Excellent from tip to tail. They knew we were on a time schedule and they had us out without pressure or fuss. I simply cannot wait to go back to The Gage for dinner when I have time to relax and eat all that I want to. Starting with that Scotch egg..."
The wait staff is very knowledgeable of the menu and could answer any question my gluten-free friend asked. The drinks were strong and delicious. Great meal overall.
"We were immediately seated at 8pm on a Weds night.  The restaurant was pretty full.  We decided to go here because of the beer selection but the food was also excellent.  I had the scotch egg to start.  It was the first one I've had so I have nothing to compare it to, but it was good.  I had the venison burger as my entree.  This was an awesome burger.  I was worried that the venison was going to be a little gamey but not at all.  I would definitely go back again."
"Hello most amazing brunch I've had in awhile.LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. In town for Lollapalooza, the strategy for meals was ""stock up like a chipmunk in winter before the day starts and see what happens."" This place was a great start for day 2 of the festival.Located right across from Grant Park, the 3 of us were ready to eat and booze before the day. And, as they say ""when on vacation"", or I guess that's what I say, we went all out. Starter for the table: the House Putine.  I never had it before, but I will for sure order it any time I see it on a menu or within 30 feet of me. Eggs Benedict for me as my main, with goat cheese grits (YES, you read that right) on the side. Oh yea plus the bread, and 3 bellinis. Then we were sent over an Irish breakfast which we all devoured. Oh, and do you want dessert?, the waitress asked knowing very well we'd be convinced---sure! BRING ON THE BEIGNETS! Delicious. Heaven. Heaven in a bowl. All of the above.Come here for brunch if you are in the area. Order all that we did or anything else, the food is great. Try and snag a booth if you can too. Great for groups, or at least for more space for you to move after your pants start to feel tight."
I cannot stop myself from going to this place. Recent favorites are:The mussels-that's an entree in itselfthe warm and cold saladAnything with grilled pork bellyLocally crafted sausage with crisp brie potatoes
"I'll try and keep it short(er) and to the point...I think 500+ reviews probably says just about anything I have to say! My group of 4 had reservations for 7:30 on a Friday night. They get major props for seating us promptly at 7:30 - so many other busy, popular, see & be seen type places downtown are horrible at getting you sat at your reservation time. It was a nice surprise that we didn't have to wait at all.This is a very busy place. It was mostly filled with what seemed to be an after work set (lot's of guys in suits) and then sprinkled in were some diners like my group (girls night out), and some tourist looking types in baseball caps & gym shoes who clearly missed the boat on dressing accordingly (note - this is not a fancy place but it has a bit of an upscale feel to it so baseball caps are a No No). Our server was fantastic. It was Restaurant Week and we planned to all do the RW prix fixe deal.  Our server was really helpful explaining all the dishes and helping us to pick a wine. The food was good, a really interesting menu and it definitely had that gastropub spin to it. We started with the chips (fries) and they came with a curry dipping sauce. They were very well seasoned although I personally didn't care for the curry sauce. My first course was the lobster bisque which fell a little short for me. It was just kind of blah. For my entree I had the risotto of the day and it was phenomenal. It just melted in my mouth and left me wanting more, more, more! My dining companions went with the steak and whitefish and I heard no complaints from them. The atmosphere in here is just buzzing with energy. I like that they have it separated in to a bar section with tables that feels more pub like, and then the dining section which felt very white tablecloth, 5 star dining. I consider this a see & be seen place, but it really didn't have that pretentious feel to it at all. I will definitely be going back to sample some of the other menu items. Overall just a very pleseant, enjoyable dining experience."
"Very enjoyable meal. Service was excellent, serves an adequate list of Scotch's. Short list of desserts but each is unique and tasty."
"If I'd only eaten here for brunch, The Gage would have gotten three stars.  Luckily, my companion and I stopped there for a few beers and appetizers the night before, so I know I'll be back.  Everyone sings the praises of the scotch egg.  It was delicious!  Amazing!  A feat of awesomeness. (However the scotch egg we split for breakfast was about half the size of the one we had for dinner.  Weird.)  The pickles and olives were also awesome--lots of pickle, not enough olives, but my friend actually liked the olives I shared with him (he swears he hates olives. Well no more!).  The smoked salmon appetizer was really good as well.  On to brunch.  After splitting a disappointingly small scotch egg, I dove in to my bloody mary (good, but not the best I've had) and he into his latte (he couldn't stop talking about how good the coffee was).  Then he saw the chips with curry gravy, so that was ordered.  It was good, but we were both expecting a yellow curry gravy, not the red one we ended up with.  A little spicier than we'd anticipated, but we managed to finish the entire order.  For breakfast he ordered the roasted corn soup and beet salad--both delicious.  I got the irish breakfast and to be honest, I was disapopinted.  The sausage links were that really fine ground consistency I can't stand in a sausage link.  The white and red puddings were bland (the red was really dry), the bread was dry, the beans were just ok.  However, the eggs were perfectly over easy, and the rashers were salty deliciousness.  In all, it's a wonderful place, and I highly recommend it.  However, I'd say that if you have the option, get the lunch/dinner foods from The Gage, and forget about the brunch options."
"Nice place!  Welcoming and great service. The bar area was awesome and the restaurant looked up scale.   Sausage appetizer was good but I expected more of an Irish sausage recipe but it was more spicy, smoked Portugese."
"The Gage reminded me how you can tell when you have a truly good meal... you want to eat slowly and savor every moment.  The Gage delivered and reminded us to slow down a bit.  The dining room is a bit noisy but not bothersome, just energetic.  The service was amazing with extremely polite bus boys and servers.Food - All courses were delicious.  There were so many more we wanted to try and we wished we had some more friends so we could try and share some more dishes.  The only disappointing course was our dessert which was okay, but worthy of a star deduction.Not going to be long winded... I will just say we already have reservations for going back."
"Great food, excellent staff. Coffee rubbed pork entrees and lentil soup are fantastic. Dessert menu is great! Recommend the apple cider donut dessert. 4 stars because it's a really loud place...went there on a Monday for an early dinner. Not a great spot to go if you want to have much of a convo. It's the acoustics."
"Okay, I know I'm review #49089880...but I figure I'll give it a shot.Fondue app was delish, bread service kicked ass, martini...well, it's still in effect.My fish and chips, kinda dissapointing, but it's okay cuz I filled up on all the carbie goodness beforehand. My friend loved his burger and the service was a little slow but very friendly.I would definitely go back in a hearbeat and try some more adventurous things on the menu.Oh, and PS, this new little Open Table reservation application that Yelp has is kick-ass!"
"This place is a great option for lunch downtown, for business or just for fun. The atmsophere is really lively, the service is very good and the food was really outstanding. I ordered the flank steak salad and it was very uniquely presented and really delicious. I will definitely return to check it out for dinner. The bar also looks like a great place to hang out after work."
"I will go there again, love there."
"Have tried this place a couple of times. First time, I came away not impressed at all, but figured with all the great reviews that maybe I just hit it on a bad night. Tried it again a few weeks later, and still was not impressed. Nice decor, presentation, and some interesting/trendy ingredients,,,, but it didn't seem like the taste of the food benefited. #1 for a restaurant to me is the food, and I just didn't feel like they hit the mark. Good place to meet people for drinks, and perhaps chatty talk over food, but I think the food fails to make the center of attn"
"This place is popular so reservations are highly recommended, even for lunch. That said, it's worth a wait. Tasty food, good variety on the menu, friendly waitstaff. Can't wait to go back because we didn't have time for dessert and there was a lot that sounded amazing."
"Super cute vintage place. Love the subway tiles and dinning rooms. A lot of the reviews said it was a glorified pub so I didn't really know what to expect but honestly I was pleasantly surprised. The place was clean, the service was great, the food came out SO FAST, and it was pretty darn good. My husband had the sausage trio with brie potatoes (delicious) and I had the Amish Chicken - the quinoa was DELICIOUS. I would have liked a bit more of the mixed greens and fontina cheese but it was just enough food to not be over stuffed. I had half of the chicken on my plate, they give you half a chicken - definitely enough for left overs! We would of loved to try the Brie fondue appetizer and mussles but weren't in the mood to be rolled out. Definitely give it a try."
"Just stopped for a couple drinks at The Gage. Quite taken by surprise by the classy decor and the nicely dressed waiting staff. They have a nice beer selection and great cocktails. I had a Southern Unearthly Imperial, a 10% beer. Was I buzzed afterwards...and yeah you might think, ""seriously? After one beer?"" but this was an IPA that packed a punch..well not as potent as the Devil Dancer (that's another story). I am excited about going back to the Gage and this time actually trying out its food."
"Stopped in for drinks to avoid Friday night post work traffic, and to get out of the rain, and was pleased by the original mixed drink selection. Though we didn't eat, the place was packed which leads me to believe they have got to be doing something right! It appears they are still re-modeling the lower level, and once that is completed, I am sure there will be plenty of seats available. Worth a visit."
"Good beer selection and the scotch egg was awesome. How can you not like a hard boiled egg rolled in sausage, battered and deep fried, and served with a good stoneground mustard?  Healthy?  Hell no. Delicious?  Hell yeah. My buddy's lamb sandwich special was good. The fries were good ( skip the curry gravy though...it is very thin and does not go well the fries).  A roasted beet soup special was good but I could have made it at home.  My chicken and pomegranate salad was pretty good but nothing exceptional.  For $45 at lunch, a pretty good experience overall though the Scotch Egg is the only thing I will remember eating.  The next time I am in Chicago, I will go again but try something different off of the menu...the egg being the exception."
"Now this to me, was good Gastropub food!  Super cool inside, the right combo of bar area, tables and I think 2 smaller tvs.  Cozy, yet open.  Loved all the tile floor.  My husband and I got right in on a Saturday afternoon in the bar area.  Great servers.  The manager came around several times to inquire as to our food and if we needed anything.  My husband choose the house roasted brisket that came open face with a mound of green apple,  steiner smoked swiss, arugula, and mustard on brioche.  Side of fries.  He thought the sandwich was outstanding.  Fresh and flavorful.  Fries were average.  I choose the roasted woodland mushroom sandwich that came with watercress, radicchio, percorino, truffle aioli, and filone bread.  This sandwich was simply phenomenal.  There is not one thing I would change about it.  The mushrooms were devine, cooked to perfection and the truffle flavor left my mouth craving for each next bite.  I was sad when the sandwich was gone.  This bread was amazing.  It looked sort of like a cross between a french roll and a pretzel roll.  It was soft yet held up well to the contents of the sandwich.   It came with a side of delicious and fresh slaw, that had a very light sesame dressing that made it tasty yet seem incredibly healthy as it was not at all gooey.  I substituted a green salad for my fries and it was wonderful, a tangy homemade vinaigrette, with a little blue cheese.  Presto.  Perfect lunch.  I would come again and again and again and again."
Awesome loop lunch!  Pricey but so worth it!  Definitely need to come back to try all of the brews!
Great scallops and the Venison burger is delicious. Moscow mule in a frosted copper mug was a solid drink. Some of the tables in the back are a little close to the kitchen but the service was great.
"I've always enjoyed The Gage.  It's a nice gastropub with reliable lunch options and finger food.  I returned recently for a full dinner (ordering from the entree or ""Four"" section).  It was a mistake.  The food started off really well.  Bread service was nice, with a roll of warm and fragrant multi-grain and flavorful whipped butter.  Brie fondue with spinach was rich and creamy.  The only downside was that the toasted bread was a bit soggy.  Fries with curry was as perfect as usual.  What a great idea!  Portions were big, and at this point, we were already stuffed.  Should have stopped there on a high note.  But alas, we went on to have the entrees. And that's when things started falling apart.  The risotto of the day was undercooked and not creamy enough.  The duck breast was executed fine enough.  However, the three dumpling-looking things that accompanied the dish (the shape was not a tortellini or ravioli, wasn't sure what it was supposed to be) was completely undercooked.  It was rock hard and the pasta was still raw.  I took one small bite and couldn't finish - it was inedible.  The bed of sauteed greens was overcooked and dry.  The rest of the dish was fine - I liked the puree and the reduction, and I liked the other vegetables.  But as a whole, there were too many ingredients on the plate, and they didn't necessarily go together.   Service was casual and friendly.  Decor was quite interesting for a gastropub.  I don't quite know how to describe the style, but there were details such as ornate ceiling tiles, exposed brick, cottage-style kitchen wall tiles, nice old-school faucets in the restroom, etc.  I really like the interior design and the atmosphere it engenders.  It's a shame that the entrees were a mess.  Prior to the entrees, the experience was a solid 5-star.  The overly-complicated duck dish aside, there are worrisome execution issues in the kitchen, which should really be worked out if The Gage ever wants to earn a Michelin Bib Gourment designation or even a Michelin star like L&E."
"My wife and I enjoyed a very memorable experience at lunch. Service was cordial,courteous and prompt. The mussels were delicious, a little different in a curry wine broth. Delicious with a bite from the curry."
"Super yummy lunch stop before the Art Museum (which is just a block away).  I had the Grilled Wagyu Sirloin salad with tart Apple, radishes, aged cheddar, mixed greens, and smoked shallot vinaigrette...it also had some kind of savory meyer lemon jelly on the steak which I really want to recreate.  The rest of the crew ordered the half sandwich/soup combo which everyone raved about.  Also, great pickles!What I love about places like this is that you can get a really nice, beautiful meal without feeling like you're going to interrupt someone's fancy meal by having a baby with you.  There was a very diverse clientele here which was great for us!They were super nice, especially to the baby.  And yes, they do have high chairs!"
"The Gage is one of our favorite places to stop and eat when we are in the loop.  The food is always fantastic and the service is good.  Highly recommend reservations, even when you think you will not need them.  We stopped for lunch on a Tuesday at 1pm and there was an hour wait.  There is a reason it is one of the most booked places in the city on opentable.  We always splurge and get the delicious n17 fondue.  Absolute must if you are a cheese lover.  Kind of pricey, we always end up spending almost $100 for lunch with drinks and tip.  Still highly recommend."
"The Gage is my favorite place in this touristy area of Chicago, and it's a great place to bring out-of-towners for dinner or a drink. The beer selection is great, and I usually like to sit at the bar and have a few appetizers, especially the Poutine (fries with elk ragout and cheese curds)...ok, that sounds kinda gross but it's delish. Last night we also had the duck fat nuts and Wagyu steak salad....all great. Service is friendly and efficient...and the bar is usually crowded and loud, and one of the funnest spots in town. Outdoor seating is excellent for people-watching.Steer clear of the $10 burger...I have to assume the more expensive Gage Burger is better, but I've never had it. The fish and chips are very good. So check out The Gage after your touristy afternoon at Millennium Park or Art Institute for a great meal or a quick bite of quality food and a few good beers."
"Love this place.  Upscale pub grub, fancified!  Highlights: slow cooked shrimp, curry fries, caramelized lobster, lamb loin w/ lamb belly confit.Nice selection of spirits - one of the best.  Not too many places have Plymouth gin and Yamazaki whiskey.  The 18 year old Yamazaki is really delicious.Service was great.  About the only downside is the cost - pretty pricey!"
"I went here for dinner with my 12 year old son. Overview says not good for kids but there were many kids in the restaurant, and my kid loved this place.We made reservations at 7:15 on Friday night, got there about 7 and were seated right away. Don't know about walk in's but the restaurant seemed full and busy, Didn't notice people waiting around though.The service was excellent, waiter was very friendly and helpful in making our selections and offering his personal recommendations. The bus boy was also very good and never let our water glasses run dry.The food was awesome! I had the mushroom tagliatelle and I was worried that this would be just another pasta dish but this was pasta like no other!  It was handmade, tender and just unbeliveable. Spicy orange martini was different and spot on for this time of year, a delicious fall treat.My son loved his vennison burger and the fries are delicious-crispy and hot. He got root beer, a little overpriced at $6 per bottle but this root beer was so good.We also shared the fondue which came with toast for dipping. The cheese was creamy with just the right amount of brie, not too overbearing which I can find brie to be. Toast was soft inside, crispy on the outside. The atmosphere was trendy but very cozy and warm.If you are thinking about going to The Gage, just do it!"
"Disappointed. I ate here several years ago and back then it was fantastic, both in terms of service/overall experience as well as the food.  But we visited again this week and the meal was definitely not worth the prices charged. I can compliment the salads-- I had the Lyonnaise salad with poached egg and prosciutto-- well dressed, very tasty. Another diner at our table said the beet salad was good too. But the other two diners ordered the vegetarian French onion soup and said it was watery and tasteless.  For my entree, I had the coffee-rubbed pork-- most of the slices on the plate were overcooked and dry (and the dry rub on the outside made it seem worse--just an unpleasant mouthfeel).  Plus, there was a BBQ short rib tossed on the plate (which was an ingredient in another one of their entrees, not this one.  Some other diner was probably shorted their rib).    Couple of awkward service moments but nothing unforgivable. But the overall experience was quite mediocre."
"My friend suggested this place, knowing that I would love it. Smart cookie. We had the poutine and I had the salmon sandwich. The smoked salmon was like salmon pastrami, with spices on the edges and blew my mind. I was so stuff after the poutine, I just did the no carbs thing and ate all the salmon even when I was past full.Plus the location can't be beat."
"Good ambiance and top-notch service. Solid wine list, with good beers as well and the food was definitely worth coming back for."
"The house poutine was so salty, we could not finish it; that having been said, I had the antelope tartare and it was phenomenal.  I was sad that I was only in town for a bit and therefore couldn't sample more of the menu, which contained a seductive array of delicious fare ranging from hiramasa to elk prepared with attractive flavor combinations.  It was also great to sit outside, right across from the park, and lose myself in food and conversation; maybe that's making this review a bit biased, but  I definitely recommend this place."
"I had the selection of sausages, pheasant & something else (I forgot) with potato and Brie cheese. Wonderful stuff! My friend had the Gage burger with the best fries we ever tasted!!!On weekends, the tourist set comes down Green Bay, or wherever they emerge from, but weekdays are safe here on Michigan Avenue at The Gage."
"Had lunch here on a lazy Sunday and was able to get a reservation on OpenTable last minute. It definitely has a pub feel but still very upscale-y. For starters, my gf and I had the poutine, which neither of us had ever had. Let's just say it's like cheese fries but way better. There's fries/potatoes, a small amount of gravy, cheese, and some boar meat. Don't even think about it. Just get the poutine for an appetizer. For the main course, I got the Venison Burger and my gf got the soup of the day and roasted turkey sandwich. Polar opposites. Venison Burger was hearty, heavy, a great piece of meat and cooked a real Medium Rare (not Medium like most other places do it). The soup of the day was a honeydew, grape, crab mix with an apple, brie, and turkey, very light but great tasting. I'll definitely be coming back to try more items off the menu, probably for dinner."
"My favorite aspects of The Gage:a.) servers are memorable and friendlyb.) they can concoct an awesome sidecar herec.) the owner, Billy, usually walks around to check in on each table - again, very friendly vibe!d.) all-around great place for yuppie people watchingPlenty of other people can attest to the quality of the food - it's very tasty, duh! Not much I can add that hasn't already been said."
"Hmm veeeerrrrrry interesting. I have some mixed feelings about this place, but I decided the entrees were all so delicious, it can almost excuse my frustrations that occurred earlier on.  The host staff, for such a crazy busy and loud restaurant, was surprisingly friendly, calm, attentive, and accomodating. The restaurant is really loud, but ask for a quiet table, and they'll put you in the back room, which is really nice.  Our server greeted us, casually leaning up against our booth in his swarthy, rico suave attitude, as if to say, ""yes, I know I am the hotter version of crocodile dundee, welcome.""  Ahem, anyway, so he took down our beer orders, and then...disappeared.  Some other server showed up to also take our drink orders, they've already been taken.  Some other server again showed up to give us our drinks and take our food orders. The previous guy showed up and asked if we were ready to order.....WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!?! So confused, am I being punked?So we ordered the carmelized lobster appetizer and the goat w/gnocchi.  Mainly cause goat apparently is the new trendy meat fashion. And it was good!  I wish there was more gnocchi on the plate, don't be stingy with the gnocchi people! But all in all it was tasty.  The lobstery app was very meh, with a huge amount of quinoa and like some daps of lobster which honestly tasted and looked more like shrimp than lobster, oh well. Things are looking kinda ho-hum, and my head is spinning from the server merri-go-round.Thank God the entrees were crazy delicious.  I had the duck confit w/duck breast, and gotta say YUM! Delicious sauce, perfectly cooked, CRISPY skin HELLO!  Served with white asparagus, which I think is kinda gross, but who cares, The duck was amazing.Also try the whitefish, very light and simple, but flavorful and delicious. The pork chop, I also heard from my dining mate, was delicious, but it has this ""smokey malto-dextrin powder"" on it according to our server, which is supposed to give it a bbq/right off the grill flavor.   UMMM, how about you guys just put it on the grill and give it that bbq flavor, that's unsettling.  Oh well, the guy eating it loved it and loved the maltodextrin-aliciousness of it.  Go figure.All in all, I would PROBABLY come back, I mean the entrees were super good, if I was in the area, but really wouldn't take extra effort to go there specifically.  Figure out the kinks in your wait-staff.  They get thumbs up for the sustainable, local ingredients."
Came here with my Dad while visiting for the weekend.  I got a fennel soup (special) and the famous rabbit salad.  Both were nice.  Dad got a crystalized lemon creme brule for dessert that was extraordinary.  it's a good idea to come for dessert alone.  We enjoyed some great service here.  I'd come back on the weekend anytime.
"I have been here a handful of times. I think this place is really good if you want to hang with your girls after work, get hit on, or drink a few too many martinis.     The decor is lovely and the service is good.  As for the food, it's pricey.  Fifteen bucks for fish and chips?  You kidding, Gage?  I've had it and its not worth it.  Nothing I've ever eaten here stands out for me.    On a side note, I am not crazy about the fact that you have to walk downstairs to use the restrooms, but that is because I have bad knees and a bum right foot and still have not given up high heel shoes."
"My boyfriend Josh and I celebrated our 8th anniversary on January 15th at The Gage, where we had dinner reservations. We'd never eaten there before, but it has excellent reviews on Yelp, and a few of my friends highly recommended it. It was soooooo delicious.We were seated in the back next to the kitchen, so we got to witness all of the excitement of the restaurant firsthand. A couple at the table next to us were celebrating a birthday with a tasting menu prepared by Dirk Flanigan, the executive chef.We told our waiter, who was extremely eccentric (in a good way), that it was our anniversary. He promptly brought us out some delicious prosecco (my new favorite)!We started with the amazing scallops, which were served with melted onions, orange segments, crispy chicken skin, and a house-made olive tapenade. The chicken skin added an earthy, savory note to the dish, while the orange segments provided the needed acid and freshness to the dish.Following the scallops, which I am totally craving right at this moment, I ordered the duck leg confit and roasted breast, while Josh ordered the fish and chips (which were flying out of the kitchen left and right).My duck came with roasted endive, wilted grapes and a natural jus. Unbelievable. This was my first time eating a duck, and it won't be the last! The confit leg was just encredible, I don't have words to describe it, but I'll try: earthy, crispy, moist, deep (does that make sense?), tender, succulent.....I loved every bite.The roasted breast was also quite delicious, cooked perfectly (so I'm told), and provided a much-needed contrast to the confit leg. The combination of the grapes, which were sweet, with the endive, which was quite bitter, was awesome. And if you succeeded to get a bit of everything into one bite, it was utter bliss.Mr. Flanigan himself asked me how I was enjoying the duck (quite a bit!) and explained to me the balance of the grapes with the endive. It was great to get such personal service - especially at a restaurant that we'd never been to before. Guess that means we'll definitely be going back!The fish & chips - the ones that kept flying out of the kitchen - were the best I've ever had. The batter was appropriately light and crispy, but you could still taste the Guinness. The chips, which seemed to be twice-fried, could have satisfied me as a meal on their own! And even the tartar sauce was unique and delicious. Super good. I'd definitely recommend you try the fish & chips at The Gage.Then we had an amazing desert, which was a play on french toast and espresso. I don't remember the details, sadly, but I do remember it was delicious, and I would totally get it again. Yum!At long last we were finished, and it was time to go. The Gage picked up our prosecco and desert in honor of our anniversary - how nice! And every employee we passed on the way out took the time to say thanks or goodnight, even though the place was busy. Needless to say, it was an experience that I will not soon forget.Check out my delicious blog post about The Gage: breeeatschicago.wordpres…"
Great drinks!  Lobster brulee had great texture and flavors.
Excellent staff. Fantastic menu. Best burgers in town.
"I went here last night with my boyfriend and his father, that's the kind of place it is. Every time I have someone who's visiting the city for work and wants to grab dinner with me on their free night I bring them here. It's right in a great spot in the loop, across from millennium park. I recommend making a reservation just cause they fill up and people tend to stay at the bar for a while. It has a great beer selection (especially for the loop). If you are considering this as a brunch spot, I'm not as big of a fan. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't PHENOM brunch that warrants a 5th star, I wanted more from a brunch menu and for the price of brunch it needed to be phenom. Anyway, So I say: make this your loop dinner spot. I've had a few things on the menu. For starters, the Mussels are awesome. It's a large bowl so make sure you have an appetite. If you don't have as large of an appetite I like the Pate. It's a nice combination of flavors and it's lighter. For dinner I have the following faves: The Gage Burger, the big eyed tuna. If you have the appetite for it the Crisp potatoes with Brie are out of this world. As for brunch, I was just dissapointed. I guess I had this idea of what a Gage brunch would be based on the fact that I love their dinner menu and find that they with the Menu selection.  I had been coming here for dinner so I was expecting an menu for brunch that was as well thought out.   Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't the Gage I was expecting.  I'm cool with it though, now I know that the Gage and I are only on for dinner!"
"I was looking for a pub with good food.  What I found was a treasure trove of cuisine and booze.  The Gage goes well beyond ""GastroPub"".The service was attentive and helpful.The food options consisted of pub favorites and gourmet comfort foods - foi gras, elk, duck, pork belly - to name a few.Great beer list.  Great wine list.  Great scotch list.  I can't wait to get back to this place and try more of what it has to offer."
"Nope. Not a fan. I understand the appeal, but I just don't see it.At first, I thought that maybe my distaste for the place was due to Gage being a more formal restaurant then I was expecting. High prices; small portions: I get that that's how such restaurants are, but hear me out...IF a restaurant is SO fancy that it can charge $20 for three scallops and a three-inch line of sweet potatoes drawn with an icing bag, how can it justify a waiter being drunk?Yep. Drunk. All four friends in attendance will agree. Imagine a creepy James Spader character who can't quite keep his eyes open. Imagine a waiter who keeps complimenting the ladies while continuously hiccuping. DRUNK.So, does this restaurant have low standards for its employees? Does it assign the drunk waiter to the table of younger patrons? Here's the real question: regardless of WHY we had this experience, should this restaurant really have such a high opinion of itself?"
"Amazing mussels vindaloo.  Downside: only one long thin slice of bread was served with it.  Upside: when I asked for more, they brought 5 more slices (and these were big long ones too) to the table.  Checked the bill: zero charge for the extra bread.  Good food, great service.  Left a 30% tip.  Would definitely come back here to check out the rest of the menu."
"I have been here quite a few times and I was just getting ready to make a reservation for Friday when I realized that I have never given a review. The location is great, the foot is great, the staff is great. I know it's higher price point for bar type food, but the quality shows.  I will continue to go here time and time again."
"I have been here twice in two months and can say that the food and drinks are wonderful.  Had the pate board- yum.  Visited for Restaurant Week- the service was very chill, perhaps that is their style, but I would have been nice to have the server stop by when the food was served.  The gents that came to clear were quick and loud- lots of clanking plates.  So, a bit off balance, I guess."
Unique charm about this place. Great for after work drinks and dinner.I love the wine selection and the mint/cucumber martini.Desserts - perfect size.Yummy fish & chips - not too oily.
"I came here for restaurant week and when i walk in, it is the perfect place for men, lots of beers selection, dark deco, and many seats at the bar. The lunch pre-fixed  came with a black bean soup( ok), the second was Baked Semolina Dumpling Fontina, Nutmeg, Golden Raisin, Tomato Ragout. It was ok too. The best of the third which was a light pistachio panna cotta with cranberry biscotti, pink grapefruit, and a chunk of white chocolate..."
"The Gage is another must visit whenever I'm in Chicago (which unfortunately isn't enough). A must have are the scotch eggs. A hard boiled egg rolled in sausage and deep fried served with a side of grainy mustard. Simply amazing!  We split one on this visit although I wish I'd gotten my own. The mussles were recommended to me by the GM at Publican as the best in town. They did not disappoint one bit!  They come in a vindaloo sauce with a long thin slice of garlic toast. We killed the mussels and bread and ordered some extra bread for dipping. By this time I was pretty full but I had the Gage burger coming. This was the only disappointment as I didn't like the malt roll (it had a rye flavor to me and I don't like rye bread). I still enjoyed the meat but couldn't finish. Instead of fried I subbed brussle sprouts.  These were creamy, cheesy with a little bacon. Delicious!!I highly recommend The Gage. I suppose due to my burger I could give 4 stars but I should have known better on the malt roll."
"As far as I am concerned, The Gage has the best burger in all of Chicago AND its only $10.  Yes that is correct ten bucks and better than any other I have tasted.  I can't explain it but it was perfect...simple, juicy, and large!The restaurant itself is a bit of a scene and loud but I like that, this is a place where you can go have way too many drinks and laugh obnoxiously loud without the tight arses shooting you nasty looks.  It's filled with dark wood and leather which is what I would picture when I hear ""The Gage""...not sure what means but I like lol.  Service was nothing short of amazing.  Our server was the type of guy that you know is really cool with a million stories to tell...a young dos equis guy from the commercial haha.  He had accent that I couldn't pinpoint and and tattoo of a women's name peeking out from his sleeve.  He explained how the chef buys locally and talked about days special...it was some fish that I had never heard of (insert puzzled look) but he promptly explained what other fish it would be similar to.  I split a starter with  my girlfriend and without even telling the guy, he had the kitchen split the dish on two plates for us.  Very small gesture but greatly appreciated...little touches like that make you love a place!Overall The Gage is a winner...if you don't like it you probably suck jk.  If nothing else try the burger!"
"I agree with Karen C.  I am not a fan of touristy places or locations.  The only reason we went here for lunch was because Mr. Beef was closed on Sunday and we had a few hours to kill before our flight, and we had walked by it coming back from Millennium Park.  My boyfriend and I consider ourselves amateur foodies (as we do not have enough money to be real foodies), and I had a feeling the food would be overpriced and underwhelming, but we were hungry and did not know where else to go.  Plus we wanted a beer.We were so pleasantly surprised.  The food was amazing.  I recommend the Scotch Egg (WOW), the house burger (Camembert and caramelized onions...yes), and potato soup (with bacon and clams, I wish I had gotten a bigger serving and made it my whole lunch).  I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, too.  It was very good.  But not ""special"" good.   Beer selection was excellent and moderately priced.  I have to say...I will be back next time I am in Chicago to try more of their menu, and hopefully to check out the chef's new restaurant that was advertised outside."
"Very delightful place. Good food and prices are reasonable. Service is usually quite good, but have had a bat waiter twice now. Maybe he was in training. And the best is they have an outside eating area across from the park."
Excellent spot for brunch. Eggs in Purgatory is fantastic but I would really recommend the traditional Irish Breakfast. Pig-Blood sausage is mind-blowing.
Surprised to find scotch eggs on menuthat taste really good. fish and chips were delicious. Beers were expensive and small glasses.  Service was nothing special.
"I have been here a few times now. Definitely would be a place to recommend to the friendly travelers enjoying the sights and sounds of downtown Chicago, to stop in for lunch or an early dinner. It is a hop off the main drag and once you are in, you slip right into a nook of something fantastic. The ambiance is really laid back (not as stuck up as a lot of other places on Michigan ave. are) Everything on the menu is is good their from their soups to the fish n' chips, to their sandwiches. Their drink menu is extensive as well and some of the more well-priced in the area."
"The Gage knocked my socks off. My fiancée and I went to a wine tasting nearby and decided to grab dinner afterwards. We called the Gage and were able to get a table right away even though they were very busy. I was skeptical about the entire idea of The Gage given that it's on Michigan Avenue. Shouldn't a restaurant on Michigan Avenue either be geared for tourists, or overpriced, or both?! Let's just say I was happily proven to be oh so very wrong. The decor is dominated by dark wood and white and black ceramic tiles which gives it a 1920s steakhouse feel... kind of like Keen's in New York, but without the feeling that it hasn't been renovated since 1920.The drinks were fantastic. I ordered a gin gimlet, a simple drink but one that most bartenders screw up by making it simply a lime juice cocktail where you can barely taste the gin. The bartenders at The Gage would not sink to such levels, their gimlet was delicious. The service was attentive and knowledgeable and the waiter helped us navigate the menu to find dishes that he felt were special at The Gage and that would suite our tastes.So... now we get to the food. We ate WAY too much because it was so delicious. I can't remember the full menu, but our meal focused on the meats. We started with the Poutine with Elk Ragout and the Scotch Egg. I hadn't even heard of either of these dishes before this evening, but thanks to Yelp reviews that suggested both, we went for it. Thank goodness we did. I've never tasted anything like either before and have no idea where we could even get something similar.  Both were unique and incredibly delicious. If you have to choose though, I'd go with Poutine... but plan a workout for the day after to work off the cheese/gravy/meat/french fry combination. I've already written too much so I'll stop here. But, bottom line, you must go to the Gage."
"First off, some of the food was good, some was mediocre.  Our server was very pushy and sarcastic.   I generally appreciate advice when it comes to what to order, but this server pretty much had his mind made up for us.  He told us what we had to get, and he even told us what was terrible on the menu (the fondue appetizer apparently).  The dish that he thought was best was the Bison tartare.  My fiance thought it was delicious, and I was not a huge fan.  The presentation was nice, but it didn't come together very well flavor-wise.  Don't waste your time on the pickles ""snack.""  The burger was definitely the best thing we tasted.  The rib eye was not anywhere near worth the money and was very lacking in flavor, ditto the fries.  The brie potatoes were so-so.  Overall, the food was decent, the service was annoying, and the atmosphere was very loud.  I'll probably go back and have a burger at a time when I expect it to be slow there, but we won't be back for another dinner date."
"Great food, great service, great buzz.  I had an amazing burger there, and the chicken fingers and mac n cheese more than passed the kid test."
"Two stars because:1. They don't have ranch... who the hell doesn't  have ranch?!!! So BYOR if you're thinking about hitting up the gage.2. Our server Augustus was terrible. He brought out one entree with the desserts, forgot several of our items and gave us sass when we inquired about them."
"Nothing special, especially for the prices."
Fantastic restaurant right on Michigan Ave across from Millennium Park. Our service was impeccable and the eclectic menu items add to the feel. From the House Poutine and Escargot Soup to the Roast Saddle of Elk and Tuna all items were prepared and presented very well. We ordered family style and split the entree's. Dress ranged from T-Shirts and Ball Caps (out of place) to well dressed diners. With a Bar/Party room downstairs it is a great place to stop after a day in the Park or before a Concert at Grant Park. Highly Recommended.
"Great restaurant.  Amazing food, great drinks, good place to go after work.  Also, they were very accommodating for a corporate event the company I work for had.  The basement area for private parties is real legit."
"By ""gastropub"" I was expecting a bar that happened to have upscale bar food. It's more like an elegant restaurant that happens to take English bar food as its starting point. Our server, Augustus, walked us through his recommendations for vegetarian options, and was extremely helpful and honest about our proposed selections. We had the Three Rivers Greens salad that comes from a locally sourced farm and had an amazing sherry and Dijon mustard vinaigrette with bleu cheese and amazingly delicious dried cherries. My boy had a curried roasted vegetable stew  that came with lentils served in a roasted Spanish onion and repeatedly called it ""delicious"" and ""beautiful."" He also ordered the warm spiced cider cocktail that, when I sampled it, made me want to throw a winter cocktail party themed around spiced cider cocktails. Funny sidenote, while silently devouring our delicious salads we overheard what appeared to be a very awkward date, with the male half of the couple talking about different types of strip clubs. At one point he dropped the phrase ""No G-strings attached; no tassels: no hassles."" The date seemed to end around midnight with the dude offering to drive the lady to her car, so I don't think it went that well. Augustus accurately represented food portions and was perfectly attentive during the night. The server who attended the tables on either side of us was equally attentive, and made sure that we were taken care of even though he wasn't our assigned server, which shows that the staff actually cares about their patrons and is proud of their restaurant. For good reason. I had the seasonal risotto featuring mushrooms, truffles, Parmesan and watercress sprouts (I think). I went with the French by-the-glass sauvignon blanc and I was in complete food-lude (read: food-as-Quaalude) mode at the end of dinner. Hotness."
"Firstly, it is an amazing space with ingenious decors & space separation. We orderedhouse poutine - beats the poutine at southern by miles!roasted bone marrow - much better than the bristol.venison carpaccio - delicious & not gameyfish special - fishythe gage prime burger - very very goodroast gunthopr farm pork chop - okroasted amish chicken - juicy & tenderfried sea beans - too saltybanana split - excellent deconstructed elementscoffee & donuts - very goodI thought the food was superb & would love to come back, probably more for the appetizer & desserts. I think they are of better value."
"Quite possibly the best burger of my life: Venison burger with melted onion, smoked gouda, fried jalapeño, woodland mushroom, pickled onion, red wine ketchup, mustard aioli ... shook my head in wonder with every other bite.Will be back for that burger.  That, and the excellent selection of bourbons and beers.To say I loved this place would be a serious understatement."
"I'm a City of Chicago girl and when people ask me where they should go with out-of-towners, my first answer is always The Gage. Why? Location Location Location. Then comes Food Food Food. The Gage is a *good* memorable Chicago experience. Go with no expectations. Let it surprise you. But for me, it's not too expensive, not too snooty, not too pubby, not too much of anything. This is the kind of place where you can get an incredible burger and a fine piece of fresh fish all on the same check. Try the Smoked Haddock Brandade. Scotch Egg. Caramelized Lobster. Alaskan Halibut. The Gage Burger. Those are just a few things I can recommend, although everything I've had has been scrumpdiddlyumtious. The mixologists at The Gage also work very hard to please us, so don't underestimate the power of an odd sounding cocktail. Above all else, the service at The Gage is part of the experience. It's a very loud place - so be prepared for a pub-like sound to envelope you, but the waitstaff deals with it on a nightly basis so they know how to woo people into ordering without being overpowering. Think Flo from Al's dinner mixed with Sookie from True Blood. A nice blend of friendly confidence and compassionate kindness. I have always gone in the evenings and have seen a few kids, but it seems like they are happy to see any and all customers come through the door regardless of age. I can't wait to see what kind of place they're building next door (new restaurant called ""Henri"").  If it 's anything like The Gage, we are in for a treat, Chicago. Thanks."
"We took a group of our clients to the Gage for lunch and had originally anticipated continuing our meeting over lunch.  However, the restaurant had terrible acoustics, making it difficult to hear the person next to you let alone across the table.  One of the reasons we picked the restaurant was for their gluten free menu.  The restaurant was smaller than I expected.  I would highly recommend making a reservation.  In spite of the crowd the service was very quick and accommodating to the individual in our group with allergies.  The food was fantastic.  We had a group of seven and everyone within our group was more than satisfied with their meal.  I ordered the special, which was a whitefish soup and it was better than I had expected. The Gage had fantastic food and great service.  I am looking forward to trying their dinner menu."
"The Gage is a reliably good spot on an otherwise culinarily barren stretch of Michigan Ave.  I've stopped in here several times and always felt welcomed and well fed.  Perhaps it's the great glass of Guinness on draft or maybe the homey poutine appetizer.  Add the pleasant waitstaff, the hassle-free walk-in ability, the dark wood decor and the scented soap and lotions in the bathroom and you have a lovely quick escape from downtown dreariness."
The Gage burger is my fave!! I absolutely love this place!!!
"My review is based solely off the fish and chips and their beer list, because despite the fact I've been here about 5 times, that's all I ever order (foodie sin, I'm aware).  Their fish and chips are awesome.  Part of the reason that's all I ever order here is because The Gage is where I go when I'm craving fish and chips.  It's a vicious cycle, but I'm okay with that.  The fish is moist (even though I hate that word), tender, and flaky.  The breading is crispy and delicious and strikes the right ratio of fish to breading.  Total perfection.  The beer list is solid and I've been given several great recommendations by my server, though I can't seem to remember what they were.  Okay I lied.  I've also had a couple of appetizers here, which I've enjoyed too.  The fondue was pretty good, though I'm not the biggest Brie cheese fan, so I don't think I enjoyed it to its full potential.  The fried zucchini was awesome.  I would love to try the poutine (what's not to love about fries and cheese curds slathered in gravy?  Thank you Canada for this delicious invention) but I don't enjoy game meats and having never had elk, I wonder if it will ruin the dish for me.    It's a little loud unless you get sat in the back, which is more more pleasant.  Next time, I promise to try something else on the menu.  Unless of course, I decide to order the fish and chips..."
"I've walked by many times, but never went in until last night. I expected the atmosphere to be more of like an upscale bar, but the classy and elegant feel of this restaurant (which is no upscale bar) was a pleasant surprise.Our waitress was fabulous, but then again her name was Andrea, so how could she be anything, but cool.  Carb haters should throw their diets out the window because the bread is incredible...perfect soft, warm, and the salted butter was the perfect touch!   My dining companion, who some of you may know as Kevin N from Austin Yelp, begin with meal with the chicken and giant noodle soup.  Very tasty...the gage could teach the pathetic delis of Chicago a thing or two about how to make good chicken noodle soup! And they are not lying when they say that noodle is giant- ginormous!As for my main meal I ordered the seared sea scallops from their third course menu. As expected it was on the smaller side (2 scallops, some spinach, and fried sage), but after filling up on soup and bread it was absolutely perfect. Kevin ordered the fish and chips...and the fry I tasted was pretty terrific. As for dessert our waitress suggested we order the peanut butter s'mores and like I said....with a name like Andrea she could do no wrong!  She informed us that it was absolutely delicious, but a little interesting looking...and when she brought it to our table giggled that it looked like a boob. The chefs definitely had some fun in the back coming up with that dessert.All in all, I'm a fan. A little pricier than I expected, but then again this is Michigan Avenue."
"I wish this place was closer to my home.  I understand the front this place has to put on because they are right across the park on Michigan Ave, but that didn't concern me. What concerned me was the pork belly sandwich special they had.  And it was by far the best pork belly I have ever had.  Yes, ever."
"The Gage is the go to recommendation for out of town guests.  Not only is the food fantastic but the location (near Millennium Park) is perfect for a quick stopover.  The one thing you have to try is the Brussel Sprouts.  Yes.  Brussel Sprouts!  At The Gage, they are served with Brie.  I know it sounds double stinky but the taste is fantastic. The only problem is that they serve it in some very cool Staub cooking dishes that would be very nice to borrow.  Wine and beer list is great too."
Have LOVED everything we've ordered at The Gage. The Brie fondue & lobster w/ quinoa are my faves. Our favorite restaurant to frequent when we come to Chicago!
"I had dinner here last week at the bar. I ordered the Gage Burger. It was really good. A little messy but that is not a bad thing when it comes to a burger. The fries were great too. Only a couple disappointments, the mustard which is not a big deal and the bartender which is a big deal. He just seemed too cocky. A couple tourists walked up and they said they wanted a whiskey, yea it's vague if you stock a lot of different whiskeys but he could have been more helpful and suggestive. He was like come on guy you gotta be more specific. I'm not going to totally throw him under the bus, he did warm up to them as the conversation went on but I just felt his first impression was abrasive. I wouldn't expect that from a Mich. ave high end establishment. Would I go back? Maybe if I was in the area, the food was really good just the atmosphere and service wasn't my speed."
"This is an incredible drink and appetizer place!  The bloody mary was outstanding!  We all loved our appetizers, but the entree's were very forgettable.  I had a steak but it was completely overdone and the thing that turned us off the most was the fact that we went during restaurant week.  My wife and I both do very well , but once they figured out we were there for restaurant week we literally got little to no attention!PLace has potential, but needs a few fixes"
Followed yelp advice to this wonderful place where the chef takes great care on the food and the serving staff ensures a 5 star experience. Three of us ordered from each course to share. Sort of a simplified degustation menu. We sat outdoors in a garden like setting. The attentive staff changes tableware for each course.
"First time going to a gastro pub without knowing it, but was pleasantly surprised.  Service was excellent and the food was even better, hence the higher price tag.  I loved my amish chicken.  It wasn't over seasoned, and of course the chicken wasn't dry, but just right.  Good thing I was decently dressed for the occasion because this place isn't your casual pub and would of felt like a slob with the nicely dressed good lucking mofos up in that joint.  This is the spot to hit up if you want some good beers with yummy, not heart-stopping food like other joints and get some good window shopping/buying done.  Thank you, come again!"
"I generally tell everyone that Chicago is all about the diverse neighborhoods and great hidden gems within them.  The Gage proves the Loop can have its gems as well, if not so hidden.  The fact that I have went to the Gage twice each of the last two weekends I have spent in Chicago stands as a testament to the great food and beer list.  Love the extensive list of Bell's and Great Lakes bottles which I miss out on the East Coast.This place is perfect if in the Loop area.  Just across from Cloud Gate (the bean), near the Art Institute and walking distance from the Downtown Hotels like the Wit (my personal fave since giving up my residency)."
"Gage is a very popular spot, which makes for a very loud place during happy hour.  But that's ok, feel free to scream right along with the rest of the patrons.  Took a friend out for her bday and we ordered the fondue, zucchini & olives, and the signature gage cocktail (so delish we had 2 each).  The appetizers were tasty and hot, but it took a while.  The appetizer portions are not large, but they were the perfect size for us.  We walked from her place, so we didn't have the headache of trying to find a parking spot.  We arrived early, so we were seated promptly and sat at one of the high tables.  But beware, if you arrive for happy hour after 6pm, you may find yourself having to stand in the middle of the aisle way (not a sexy look).  The bathrooms are decent.  The place is a tinge pricey, so be prepared to hand over at least $100 for two people.  Gage gives one an upscale feel, but its not that upscale, just pricey.  I would give Gage 3.5 stars, if possible.  The bday girl had a nice time (which pleased me) so all and all, we had a great Friday evening.  Besides, Gage helped me get my weekend started.  Woot!  Woot!"
"Made reservations for an early dinner on Sunday before the David Gray show.  I had been here once before for a drink in the bar, but this was my first time dining here.Overall, it was just OK, especially considering the high price tag.  My SO and I split the mussels vindaloo to start and they were really tasty, as was the warm loaf of bread.  However our ""mains"" left something to be desired.  I ordered the ""carmelized"" lobster and quinoa.  Not only was the ""lobster"" quite mushy, I had a sneaking suspicion that it was really langostino, not lobster.  My SO thought that his fish and chips had too much breading.Nice wine and beer list and it's got a nice atmosphere.  I'll stick to having drinks at the bar, though."
"Great food, great drinks, great service!  It gets busy and loud so as long as you like that vibe you will enjoy this place."
"Great lunch at The Gage while in Chicago.  Very cool decor, great craft beer focus and delicious food.  Just trendy enough but still very welcoming.   The price is right at the edge of the expensive and affordable, which is perfect for a place like this right across from Millenium Park.  Looking forward to trying dinner there on my next visit.I recommend the wood grilled mushroom sandwich and soup combo.  It comes with fries and was way more food than expected.  The sandwich had truffle oil, arugula and a fresh baked ciabatta."
"Ah I can't believe I had to pay 17 dollars for TWO yes count them TWO scallops!! eek! faint!Anyway, the atmosphere here was very boisterous even on a weekday, and I found that my throat was sore after from yelling across the table to  my friend. The service is wonderful, and I loved how the waitress took the time to describe the food to us before we ordered!The wagyu beef salad was okay... the meat was a little chewy. And the scallops.. well yes there were only two... but they were cooked perfectly, but the squash side that came with them was rather plain.I had a glass of prosecco here which was absolutely perfect for an unusually warm day in Chicago's winter. And the star of the night really was the peanut butter beignets which were light fluffy brioche pillows filled with a subtle peanut butter cream served with a caramel gelato. Nom nom! This place is fairly overpriced for what it actually offers, but I did enjoy the dessert~"
"Love this place. First time I went with a group on a Friday night, it was bustling and quite loud. Not a surprise considering the shape of the space and the subway tiles that round the walls.I love the decor and ambience of the place. I love that it isn't the kitschy Irish pub that most places mimick and it is instead a modern version of the pub. And I love the bathrooms. I want to steal the sink and take it home with me.I ordered the Fish and Chips and they were quite good. Not as good as I've had in Ireland, but very good. There was so much on the menu to choose from, I really think I could have been happy with anything. Other guests found something they like--burgers, salads, seafood, and were happy as well.What I REALLY want to rec is this place for brunch. First off, you can make reservations so you are not waiting outside or for your tiny table for an hour. Second, the food was incredible. We made a reservation and were seated outside on a beautiful Chicago Fall Day. I ordered the seasonal omelette that came with the most amazing crisp brie potatoes I've ever had. Mixing brie with potatoes? GENIUS! My friends had an amazing grilled chicken salad served with cous scous and watermelon. I love an interesting salad at a restaurant. The buckwheat waffles were also delish.I must say the service on this specific day was one of the best I've had. Our waitress was prompt and helpful. And the manager came around to ask us how our dining experience was and was very present in the restaurant during the time we we were there. Our entire bill was under 50$ for 3 people with a drink and the meals, I really think that's reasonable. My entree itself was $10!To those complaining about the price, you can definitely take a jog over to D4 Irish Pub or down the way into the South Loop to Grace O'Malley's for some pub grub. This is indeed a nice step up! Its all about perception. If you go in thinking you're going to get a dollar burger and some drafts for $10, you're going to think its expensive. If you are thinking of it as a grown up version of an Irish pub or better yet a quasi fine dining experience, you won't be disappointed."
"I heart The Gage. Actually, I heart British-inspired comfort food in general, so my love for this place isn't really surprising.I'd been to The Gage before quite a while ago (with a good friend who happens to be a fellow Yelper) and this time was just as good as the last. Service was prompt and friendly - though we were left without coffee refills.  Which is a shame, because the coffee is actually pretty good.Anyway, I've been feeling under the weather so I was hoping to find something spicy enough to give my misbehaving sinuses a stern talking-to. The Fire-Roasted Chicken sandwich, fortunately, did just that.  I also tried the Chicken and Giant Noodle soup - which was delicious, and they certainly weren't lying about the giant noodle.  It was, quite literally, one huge flat pappardelle-style noodle. I like that kind of unique little twist on something as seemingly simple as chicken soup. The beer/wine/liquor list is extensive as well.  I'm not usually a beer drinker, but I'd make an exception for some of the entries on the list here as many of them sound delicious.So even though The Gage is a bit pricey, in my opinion it's worth it.  I'm looking forward to my next visit."
"I had dinner at the Gage on 12/22 for dinner with 8 of my friends. We were out celebrating the holidays. Our server, ""K"", was nice enough and even brought us three desserts ""on the house"" that we did not order. We thought this was so nice, until the bill came and we were charged for those 3 desserts! We did order a few bottles of wine, but we are not oblivious to an extra almost $40 bucks on our bill!! We pointed this out to K and he immediately said he would take it off the bill. No question asked. Hmmmm but the question is- was he trying to take advantage & pad the bill of what he thought was a table too drunk to know??? I won't be back!"
"Excellent Lamb Stew.  Excellent Fish and Chips also.  Great beer selection.  It made ""getting caught in the rain"" not so bad LOL."
"Champagne, sprouts with brie, mushrooms... so tasty. Pretty much everything, with the exception of the Buffalo tartar, has been delicious each time I've been. They had a holiday drink with ginger, craisins, a local cider, and gin that was so good that my husband got the recipe and made gallons of it for my family's Christmas party.The whole bar/restaurant has a great vibe - really cute and warm."
"went there for st. patrick's day. everything there, meal, beer, dessert says Irish and they had a bagpipe player! Awesome food, atmosphere and experience!"
"Great, casual restaurant to go in the city next to Millennium park.  Everything we had was good. Only complaint was that they put cheese on my sandwich after requesting that they don't twice.  Very unique desserts as well. We would go here again."
"My husband and I went for our anniversary dinner while visiting Chicago (at the recommendation from friends). We arrived for our reservation and sat outside to enjoy the great weather. They brought us complimentary champagne and wished us a happy anniversary. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. We started with the bison tartare, and I ended up choosing the elk tenderloin entree  and my husband had the eggplant ravioli. We finished with a cherry chocolate cake and nectarine/fig crostini. Everything was excellent in taste and presentation. The patio area was quiet enough for intimate conversation, but the interior was a bit louder."
"Un.  Believable.  This place deserves all the positive praise it receives... and more.   We had an incredible meal here tonight.  Our server was perfectly professional + personable.... the sommelier made a great recommendation, and Chef Dirk Flannigan and his team produces some of the best food that I have ever had!  Must haves:  ""gage"" fondue, Mussels vindaloo, pork belly, halibut with horseradish, goat cheese tart with escargot, doughnut with coffee + banana semifredo with banana cake.... where do I stop?  Go here.  Have fun.  Enjoy the Gage!"
"Oh, Gage, you saucy minx. You're the perfect place to bring out of towners. When someone coming into Chicago asks where they should get drinks downtown, I recommend this place. The drinks and the food are really outstanding, and there's something for everyone.It IS pricey, but it's also fancypants food/drinks on prime real estate.I've gotten the fish and chips here, which were pretty delicious. Crispy, greasy fish with tangy tarter sauce...just perfect. It's even served in folded up newspapers. The wine is expensive (~12 a glass to start), but you also get a buttload of wine. It evens out, I suppose. It gets loud in here, but after a drink (or two), it's fine. This place is one of the few non touristy places near the bean, and you will catch a lot of locals as well as out of towners at the Gage."
"My measure for restaurants is always first rooted in the food, quality/execution versus price.  If food falls right in the middle I'm happy, if the food is fan-freaking-tastic and I don't have to pay (Grandma) then 10 stars, if you're the Gage then 3.  Everything about this restaurant is just slightly overpriced, starting with the cocktails and beer.  I guess that's the Michigan Avenue syndrome.  We had oysters, the crisp potato salad (this portion was GIGANTOR, I should mention that) and the pork chops.  All good food, nothing that inspired.  I think the Gage is a good restaurant in a locale where there are very few.  I also think if I went back (which I plan to do) I'll just stick to experimenting with the great beer list and having a burger (which looked ABSOLUTELY worth its $16 price)."
"It was supposed to be one mimosa then off to go look at the steal  bean. We never saw the bean. Once parked at the bar, an opiate of cocktails, stellar service and orgasmic food washed over me, gently folding me in an embrace I just could not wriggle out of. Bar. Bartenders were top notch. Astute. Acknowledged the neglected, diluted drips in my flute before I even noticed. I adore that. They're also stunning. Not strictly in the superficial aesthetic sense either. Rather, their clean, neat presentation injected them with an air of pride which perched them atop their reign at the bar; impressively propelling them through  efficient, expedient service. Actually, I can say this for the staff in general. When I headed to the bathroom, the bussers or waiters stepped aside in a deferential gesture to let me pass; and the Manager even took his time to chat with me about The Gage's glamorous neighbor, Henri, slated to open in the Fall next door. Food. Unfortunately for mushrooms, they're just not as cool as their elitist cousin, the truffle. So a couple mimosas in, instead of opting for some of the A-list menu offerings like the House Roasted Brisket, Wood Grilled Rib-eye  or Peppered Salmon Club,  I opted for the underdog, the Roasted Woodland Mushroom sandwich.  I was so blown away by how yum it was, I actually picked it apart half way through searching for its secret. (Like I'd find Willy Wonka's culinary ticket folded in between the baguette or something, I don't know) I  was so impressed.Sidenote. If you wander downstairs, take a moment to peruse the photos on the wall. A mini museum-like gallery of  history, art and enrichment await you. Plus, there is a bar down there too if you want a much more dialed down version of the Who's Who scene upstairs."
"Wow is the food great here. We sat at the bar and service was a little slow, despite the bar not being crowded (we were there around 2:30 on a Wednesday afternoon), so if that was a tad more to my expectations I would have given it a 5 star rating.  We split the cheese fondue with wilted spinach. It's a perfect balance of cheesiness and saltiness, with the crusty bread with a nice brush of olive oil.  Yum. I could have stopped the meal here and been totally satisfied. My friend had the pickle & olive assortment, which is uncomplicated but delicious.I had the steak sandwich, and it was HUGE. I had to eat it with a fork & knife because the cheese dripping off the side would make it impossible to pick up and eat delicately. Not that I'm delicate. But still. It was cooked to my preference and tasted super good. The fries were so-so, nothing special. The husband and I split a side order of the roasted potatoes with blue cheese, and they were to die for. We practically fought for the last bite.  His beef brisket was very good, with greens and slices of apple as a counterpoint to the heaviness of the beef.The bar menu is extensive, with a good mix of local, domestic, and foreign brews, as well as some decent wines. We stuck with beer and were satisfied. I thought the prices were a little high (notably the potato side dishes), but not overly inflated. For what we ate and drank it was definitely fair.  I thought the ladies room was cute, and the sinks are really cool (I've been watching a lot of HGTV lately). A nice touch was the scented soaps and lotions they provide.  I just didn't like having to go downstairs for the bathroom after 3 beers, but they do provide an elevator for those of us who aren't particularly graceful. I will definitely be back!"
"Very good and diverse menu.  Not a typical bar pub fare.  Lamb Ragout first course was excellent!  We shared a Caesar salad which was not as traditional as expected. I had the Halibut which again was delicious.  My husband had the sausage plate which also was great.  The Doughnut dessert was like having a beignet in New Orleans.  Great service.  Just an FYI we have been there a couple of times and it is always busy at dinner on weekends and can be noisy.  In addtion, even thought we had a reservation we still waited about 15 minutes.  Food and service worth the wait."
"I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars.  I know it's going to be pricey being on Michigan Avenue but even I was a little shocked.  We wandered in for lunch and even though it was pretty empty, they told us since we had no reservations we'd have to sit in the bar area, which was totally fine.  Service was okay, nothing bad happened but kind of forgettable.  I had the brisket sandwich which is open faced and came with fries for $15.  The fries were surprisingly great, being that I'm more of a fan of skinny fries than the big honking ones.  But these were seasoned well and weren't totally potato-ey... you know what I mean?By the time we left, it seemed the bar was all tourists who didn't make reservations and the tables were all people schmoozing clients on business lunches.  Overall pretty good but nothing so special I would rush back here to spend my  money on.  Except maybe the fries."
"Ridiculously hopping bar and amazing food.  Menu is eclectic and pretty much everything works.  Only miss this time was the cheese plate.  Everything else was and is delicious!  Drinks are always well-made and a nice wine menu.The biggest negative about The Gage is that it is by far the loudest restaurant that I have ever experienced.  Mainly because there are so very many people, which is great, but it makes conversation at dinner a little difficult.  Keep in mind if it is a romantic dinner or a business meeting that brings you there."
"Four out of five stars with over 350 reviews? You don't need me to tell you this place is great. Got a babysitter and went here on a Saturday night. Had reservations for 7:15, got there about 6:50, checked in, and proceeded to the bar. At 7:16, they came and found us and led us to our table. Our server, Patrick, was probably the coolest server we've ever had at any restaurant, ever. Think Tim Roth from Pulp Fiction, that's who he reminded us of. Anyway, great service aside, the food was amazing. Started with the cheese plate, which was fabulous. Moved on to the scallops, which were amazing. Then I had the sausages and my wife had the Amish chicken, both were absolutely delicious, although I definitely preferred the sausages to the chicken (seriously, some of the best sausage, if not THE best sausage I've ever had). For desert, I had the white chocolate creme brulee and my wife had some sort of chocolate cake thing. Again, both were great. For all that, plus 5 long island iced teas and a glass of pinot gris, we escaped with a total bill of about $160 before tip but after tax. If you ask me, it was absolutely worth it. My only regret is that we didn't try this place sooner, seeing as how we've lived 2 blocks away for about 3 months now."
"I thought the atmosphere was very stuffy.  Not my favorite place to visit when downtown.  The prices are  relatively high, but I can't say the food was bad.  My husband and I had burgers and they were good.  They have a pretty good beer selection, but I can't see us coming back.  The location is what keeps this place going ( In my opinion)Overall, not a bad place, but for the price I can recommend several other places I like better."
"Rarely is dining an all-inclusive experience. Often it is excellent food or excellent service but not too often can you find both. The Gage plus Steven, a server with a strong English accent and an impeccable knowledge of food, made this one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Everything was timed perfectly, cooked to perfection and Steve's suggestions were over the top! It's real simple, book a reservation, request Steve and enjoy. You'll thank me later."
"Fancy location, fancy spot.  They have outdoor seating but as a caviat, you do have to order food to be out there.  The last time I came we wanted to sit outside, so we ordered some appetizers with our drinks, and I felt like the server was probably annoyed but I guess kept it to himself mostly.  The food is really good I have to say though.  I would come more often if I had more excuses to come!"
"Fun Gastro-pub... House Poutine w/ Elk ragout:Very very tasty... but quite large for a 1st course. Definitely should eb shared, and even then will be quite filling. The elk ragout is pretty amazing.unfortunately I drank too much wine and forgot to taste the rest of the food when I ate. From what I can remember though, the Amish chicken was good, as well as the braised rabbit salad. ]Definitely want to go back an explore the menu further."
"After having friends rave for the past few years about the food at The Gage we finally decided to use Restaurant Week as an excuse to check it out...and boy were we glad we did...The place was packed when we arrived and service was stretching to keep up. Not a huge problem as the wife and I were able to find a couple of drinks we could enjoy.  Once we ordered the dinner progressed at a normal pace. We watched as the management was furiously circulating to make sure all the guests were  happy and adequately serviced - ensuring the food and drinks were pleasing the Restaurant Week masses. We ordered the RW menu and all dishes lived up to the descriptions. We also got the poutine, which was the best poutine we have had in the city. Sitting adjacent to the kitchen also had its perks as Chef Dirk stopped by our table to make sure everything lived up to the hype. The level of professionalism while they were in the weeds impressed us both.The final review was a solid 4 stars. My only complaints were minor. The cocktail menu was a bit small and violated 2 of my rules (don't mess with an Old Fashioned while still using the OF name and use real absinthe in your sazerac.) The Gage is most certainly worth a non-RW visit."
"The ambiance was great - old, relaxed, yet buzzing. Food was a great twist on the usual, service was fast, professional, and friendly. I will definitely come back next time I am in the city."
"Fantastic place! Great food, great service and great Scottish Egg. Definitely worth trying!"
"Went to The Gage as a visitor from NY with some locals.  I couldn't have been more impressed!  Their beer/wine selection was expansive, and our waiter only added to our great experience. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and suggested some great things.  I branched out from my usual routine and had the bison tartare with quail egg.  While the plate was small (as an app), it was DELICIOUS.  Couldn't have been better.  Topping it off my friend and I shared the peanut butter beignets with caramel ice cream for dessert.  In a word?  Heavenly.  I could have ordered three more plates of it."
"Food was just awful. They served my boyfriend ""cinnamon caramelized chicken with goat cheese"" which apparently means completely undercooked, pink chicken with leather skin and no goat cheese or anything else to speak of for $22. I ordered the lobster with gravy, which was about three bites full of rubber covered in syrup. Our waiter hovered over our table atleast 8 times during the meal.Nice atmosphere but unsafe and untastely food. Not worth the traffic or $6/hour to park."
"There are precious few circumstances when staring is appropriate. If you think my friends and I are hot stuff, stare all you want. However, if you are staring down my table of gal pals to determine when we'll be done with our meal so you can seat your next group of people, well, then it's just irritating and weird. Thus my biggest gripe about The Gage. I made reservations here for my birthday dinner last night, in hopes of great adult bevs and good food. I did find great drinks (I've never SEEN a whiskey menu like theirs before...and I discovered a top five beer fave in the Pauwel Kwak) and the food was good (the cheese selection was excellent, the goat cheese tart was a bit cold, the monkfish was seriously tasty seafood - as my friend, and fellow yelper would say, ""like lobster, only cheaper"" - and the spiced apple semifreddo was an exceptional concoction of braised apples, cake, caramel and ice cream).  However, the staring issue must be addressed. Not one, but two Gage workers felt the need to stand not five feet from our table and stare at what I can only assume was our progress in getting the h-e-double-hockey-sticks out of there so they could get more paying customers into our spot. Needless to say, by the end of the night, my friends and I were pretty annoyed. I enjoyed the evening, but it was mostly because I spent it with a great group of women. The setting certainly wasn't bad - strong 4 star showing (aside from the bizarro staring issue) it was a good experience."
"Have eaten here twice and enjoyed it immensely both times.  Has a great happy hour scene and the bartenders are more than happy to serve the full menu at the bar.  Try the venison burger, delicious!"
"After work can be crazy here. I sat at the bar waiting for friends to arrive and was immediately surrounded by two huge groups on both sides and behind me. Give me some space why dontcha?!!  I guess I should've tried to fit in and get on their tab! I liked the feel of the bar, but it fills up pretty quickly.We decided to eat some light fare and were seated in a charming area in the back next to the working fireplace! Anything with meat on the menu seems fairly overpriced, that's my only complaint about the Gage. That and the being engulfed at the bar like it was feeding time in an aquarium. But I will be back, definitely."
"Gage in the South Loop is a great spot with a chic vibe to grab drinks with friends. The scallops were undercooked despite being seared, properly, on the top. The roasted farm chicken was tender and possesed a hint of summer due to the plancha stone fruit atop the poultry. Suprisingly, the roasted eggplant and black garlic ravioli dish was light, yet, comforting. Dessert arrived perfectly matched with Fall upon us...apple cider doughnuts. The presentation, unfortunately, reminded us of potty training. Luckily, it was the best dish of our evening. Served warm and fluffy."
"We stumbled in here after wandering through Millennium Park. Little did I know, I would have one of the best brunches ever! Eggs benedict, crisp brie potatoes, goat cheese grits, and a bloody mary. Amazing.Unique menu (they even have poutine...). Perfect location (right across the street from Millennium Park). Great service. One million beers on tap. I'll be back."
"We met up for brunch with a friend at The Gage and had a great experience.  The place looks small on the outside but it's actually enormous, with a spacious area in the back and more space downstairs that I assume is open in the evening.  The house eggs benedict is made with rabbit hash instead of the traditional canadian bacon, interestingly enough.  My friend Janet K. was game for it despite my fit of nostalgia over my childhood pet bunny, Thumper.  Our waiter had mine altered to eggs florentine instead, and the hubs went with the corned beef hash.  I'm happy to report all was delicious.  My entree came with a cute little cast iron pot filled with their fried potatoes- curiously mixed with brie.  They were good but the brie did kind of coagulate and the mix of flavors was a little odd.  Not bad, just very different.  I think I would've preferred gruyere or maybe a little bit of stilton with the potatoes.  The rabbit hash actually looked more like pulled meat than hash, but my dining companions both enjoyed it. The eggs were well done, but the real star of the brunch menu is one of their sides-- goat cheese grits.  I am a great lover of cheese grits and these did not disappoint.  In fact, they were delicious and I wish I could eat some right now.  I would definitely recommend this place as a brunch spot if you're in the area.  The service is spectacular and the prices are quite reasonable for the quality of the food and the location (inside one of Chicago's historical landmarks).  I'm used to restaurants in touristy spots being overpriced and underwhelming, but The Gage is neither."
"This is my go-to in the Loop.  It's usually pretty fun, even on the weekends.  Yesterday we went for lunch, because I was meeting some friends from the South Loop, and I live in Streeterville, and this was in the middle.  I had the brisket sandwich, which was really, really good.  Plenty of meat, and yummy smoked swiss.  I love their fries.  My friend sings the praises of their ""Gage"" burger every time we go, and I will agree that the camebert looks AWESOME.  I'm so happy the Gage is here for after events at the Art Institute, or other things in the area."
"Great menu, pleasant/cool environment. It was a bit loud up front in the bar area, but we were seated in the back and found the noise level to be a good level for conversation.Enjoyed my meal (amish chicken) very much. My brother & his fiance had  brought in a sample wedding cake they had just picked up to taste & the pastry chef at the restaurant was kind enough to plate it for us with no extra charge. Very cool of them to do that for us! Excellent service.... I was pleased and will be back for sure."
"My husband and I went here to celebrate his birthday before heading off to The Hubbard St performance at Harris.  I would easily give this place 4 1/2 stars if I could, as we had a terrific experience there.Our waiter was great and most of our food was excellent.  I had the fondue, a small salad of greens w/ some fruit, and the risotto.  The fondue was delicious -- as was the bread it was served with -- and my risotto was incredible.  The salad was fresh, but not exciting.  My husband had the fried zucchini and olives, which I didn't really like and the Scottish egg, which he thought was delicious.  He had the mussels, which he didn't care for, because he thought the vindaloo did not do the mussels much good and he longed for the traditional butter and garlic method of preparation after trying these.  He also had the fish and chips, which he thought was the best he'd had in the city.As you can see, we had a LOT of food.  The menu says that the first course (apps) is for tasting and we were told they weren't very big.  Wrong.  We had way too much food.  We enjoyed it, but we definitely would not have ordered so much if we had known what the portions looked like.We had an excellent experience w/ the sommelier and enjoyed her suggestion for wine.  Our bottle was $49, which I thought was quite reasonable considering how much more expensive wine usually seems to be at other pricier restaurants.NB: If you are going to the theater, as we were, you must leave yourself plenty of time here.  We were there at 5:45 for dinner and had to skip dessert (not that we had room, but I would have loved for my husband to get a piece of bday cake!) to rush over to the show at The Harris.  This was not our waiter's fault, as I had not told him about our show, since I thought that we'd have plenty of time.All-in-all an excellent experience and I would definitely go back."
"The Gage is a special place. I feel like I'm transported to a different era when I walk inside. The ambience is upscale but accessible. The seating is comfortable but not stuffy. The cocktails are reason enough to visit the Gage. It's hard for me to walk by without popping in for a martini or manhattan. The food is truly exquisite. I've dined at the Gage several times and have never been disappointed. My favorites are the fried chicken livers, the mushroom sandwich, and pretty much all of their appetizers. It can get pricey so I usually only go on special occasions. For lunch, the prices drop considerably."
I love going to the Gage for a later evening snack. My favorite is the Scotch Egg and Braised Rabbit Salad. Both have the great flavor of artisan mustard of which I am a huge fan. Drink list is very admirable standards and a few unique whiskeys to get you going for the evening.
great atmosphere w really good food!
"Went again. Sat around with 4 others forever because there was nothing on the menu that sounded good.Truly, when it all came out, I had a few bites and was good to go."
"We ate here about 2 weeks ago; it was our second dining experience at The Gage.  We were about 30 minutes late for our reservation so it was our fault, but we were seated at the worst table in the restaurant  - at the very back right by the kitchen. It was REALLY loud.  We had a great bottle of wine and great salads, but then my pork chop came and it was so raw in the center it had to be refired. Our waiter was sort of offended at this request, which bugged me.  Also, our service was REALLY slow at every stage - - - I would go back to The Gage someday because our first experience there was great, but this visit was disappointing."
"Yum.   Fantastic service, great food.   Cute place."
"Always a tremendous experience. I've been here a few times for lunch and dinner, and just had my first brunch there with my wife and infant daughter. I had the amazing Eggs Benedict w/ rabbit hash and watermelon, and my wife had an equally terrific Corned Beef Hash. Decadent and delicious.We followed the brunch with peanut butter beignets w/ bananas, caramel, and peanut butter ice cream. Needless to say, it was unbelievable. The staff was very accommodating concerning our seven-month-old daughter. They offered a high chair right away, and the manager on duty offered to park our stroller out of the way in the front of the restaurant. I love the Gage; it's simply one of the most reliable and best restaurants in Chicago."
A pleasant find!!  Wonderful combination of bar scene and excellent restaurant; we had a 7 pm Saturday reservation (which I recommend - amazing how many young and not so young professionals are in the loop on Saturday night...which is great!)...we were seated in the back / which we asked for...away from the noise / bar so my 62 year old ears could function)....very friendly / prompt service....they had Two Heart IPA on draft - so my night was complete before we began....Marty had a good white which seemed expensive until she noted is was an 8 ounce pour...great idea...they also offer half pours if you're just testing...She had the fish and chips....which were wonderful and even too much to eat...I had the risotto of the day...also very tasty with a wonderful texture...Bottom line....very good...will be back...
"I stopped in here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed! As I approached the hostess she asked if I had reservations. I didn't..who makes reservations for lunch on a Friday? Anyway..it was a 30 minute wait, but the hostess directed me to the bar where I could sit down right away. As there were no high top bar tables available I ponied up to the bar to enjoy a TGIF lunch.  The lunch menu is great - there's plenty of choices from soups, salads, sandwiches and even some bigger entrees. I went with the soup of the day (that's the soup de jour for you Dumb & Dumber fans out there) which happened to be sweet potato. You  can also get half of a sandwhich to enjoy with your cup of soup. I went with the House BBQ Roasted Turkey on a pretzel roll, which comes with fries.  Yum! The food came out quickly and it was great! The sweet potato soup was yummy and you can never go wrong with a sandwich on a pretzel roll. Some guy, who I assume was the manager even came up and asked how we were enjoying our meal. Great service and great food! A great loop lunch spot for those who work on or near Michigan Ave or those checking out the Art Institute."
"Hello fabulous.  Been going since the place since it opened and I have to say this is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Their cocktails are marvelous, the servers are knowledgeable and just a bit flamboyant (it's hard to describe a carrot puree with pizazz, but they pull it off), and an ever changing menu of dishes that sometimes sound odd but are always brilliant.  Their fondue is my go-to appetizer, their duck is perfection and always has some interesting fruit reduction to accompany it, and don't miss out on their life-changing dessert menu.  Feels classy and casual at the same time, one of the best places downtown for brunch.Best.  Corned Beef Hash.  Ever.  Go there this weekend for brunch and order it.  Great with their Gage bloody mary.  Unfortunately gets a bit noisy at their peak hours but the back sections are usually quieter and have better ambiance.  The owner, Billy, is very friendly and always stops by our table to say a few words and if you're lucky he may even tell you a dirty joke."
"We came for brunch on a Sunday (made reservations, but no need at 10 a.m.; the place was empty). Got to sit outside. I had eggs benedict; my companion had the chilaquiles. Everything was delicious and the coffee was strong."
"I think I've seen this restaurant before. Yes! It's an American version of an Irish (or British, depending on how the light catches it) gastro pub, right down to the monumental bar, deep booths, a fireplace, and sausages on the menu. And it's on Michigan Avenue of all places, across the street from Millennium Park and The Art Institute -- two of the most toured spots in this big-shouldered city. Next.No! But wait! We needed a place to eat after an afternoon at the ballet (pronounce it ""ball-ee"" and get a free appetizer!) and it seemed like it could be delicious (friends who work in the area have raved about its lunch) and not terribly expensive.After being seated in a 32-person banquette (we were but three svelte sirs) and arranging ourselves so we could hear one another from across the table, we gazed at the menu. Since we'd had brunch not too many hours before, Daniel and I split the rabbit salad and a plate of ""locally crafted sausages.""The salad, I thought, was lovely. The arugula was vibrantly green, as though it had something to prove, and sprinkled with crisp rice -- a textural nuance I very much enjoyed. The rabbit, hiding coquettishly under the bush, was warm, appropriately gamey (Daniel found it a bit too gamey), and plentiful. I was a bit put off by the wedge of cheese, which I only found a few bites away from the end of my portion; it was ostentatious and didn't play nicely with the rest of the ingredients.I don't know if you've noticed, but sausage is all the rage right now. That means that if you're going to do it, you'd better do it right. The Gage, alas, overshot. Two links of a basil-infused sausage were much too fatty -- I could barely pick up my knife again after a few bites, thanks to the onset of Food Coma -- and a ruddy meat blend of a third link was only average. What's more, the beautiful, speckled mound of mustard was a total pacifist in its approach to flavor. Next to the heavy sausages was a charming pot of roasted potatoes -- oh wait, not just potatoes, but also BRIE. Really? It was a prelude to gout on a plate, it was. Dessert made up for some of those missteps -- a rich and complex gingerbread came topped with brown sugar gelato and dried fruits. It's too bad we didn't try the peanut butter beignets, but there will be more ballets in the future, I suppose, and the beer selection would beckon me back after touring with the tourists. But with so many similar outposts direct from the Isles on the north side, I'm not sure I'd return to The Gage to get my gastro pub on."
"We stopped in thinking this was a step up from a pub/burger joint, and were pleasantly surprised.  Our server took great care of us and didn't steer us wrong.  We started off with the Scotch Egg, their specialty, followed by fresh, delicious ceviche served with amazingly flavored popcorn.  My husband had the sausage platter which included boar sausage, all made in-house.  I opted for a couple of small plates and tried the Bison Tartare (yes you want to try it) and a carmelized lobster with quinoa and curry that is easily one of the best things I've ever tasted.  Definitely pricey, but we just opted to celebrate our anniversary a little early and splurge.  Location and convenience makes it a perfect place to show off for out-of-towners.  I wish we'd gotten a table in a little more of a secluded spot, but we made the reservation a couple of hours in advance so I cant complain."
"Definitely a fan of the gage. Came here for lunch while visiting the Chi and this place definitely did not disappoint. I am intrigued by any place that (claims to) serve poutine (look it up- it's not what you think).  While their interpretation of poutine was tasty- it wasn't the classic Canadian style poutine I was so desperately hoping for. The Gage actually served theirs with chunks of pot roast in it? Miss.I also had the Gage burger, which was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. Healthy portion sizes and an overall great dining experience (although our server was a little...um....odd). I would definitely get back."
"The good - pate board and fabulous roasted fennel soup.  Wine and beer selection also.The ok - tomato risotto with cheese and asparagus.  Perfectly cooked which is tough to do in a commercial kitchen, but the taste reminded me of Campbell's tomato soup, not bad just not good.The bad - service was glacially slow, not a leisurely paced, but slow. Sloooooooooow! turtle like, ""we forgot you were here"" slow."
"Excellent food and beers. Somewhere outside planets must be aligning.  Astro Joe can you confirm that? The Gage is a swanky little refuge from the tourists of Millennium park right on South Michigan Ave. They fancy themselves a gastropub and they certainly deliver on that. Their menu is creative, although it may be a bit overwhelming for the less adventurous types. However, there should be some variation of a stock option to suit your palate. They have tweaked their menu since the last time we were in, sadly the snacks have not changed and still seem bunk to me. I took advantage of the new items and got the BBQ turkey sandwich with caramelized onions and grainy mustard on a tasty pretzel roll like you'd find in Bavaria. Pretty damn good. Other noteworthy items on the list are the Fire Roasted Chicken, Fish and chips and the Gage Burger. Please don't cook that past Medium Rare and enjoy it with some of those great chips. The brunch menu looks good too, but I have not had anything from it yet. They have an impressive selection of beers on tap. Usually a few Germans to be had and about the only place I've seen New Belgium seasonals. Why yes, I'll have another pint. The place reminds me of an old bathhouse, which seems fitting. During the busy weekends people can be stacked right on you. Service has always been great and they seem to have a bunch of managers keeping things running smoothly. They drop by every visit to see how we are doing. Very well as you are. Love the Gage, cheers."
"It's time I review The Gage. I'm giving 5 stars for the customer service alone.  I work close by and there is no better after work drinks and/or dinner loop restaurant.  I don't always want a diner and get tired of the bar food scene that seems to dominate the rest of the area.  This week alone I have gone twice and spent close to $100 on mostly drinks and some appetizers. Back to the customer service, many times when I walk in I feel like such a regular, I am always greeted warmly and within the first half hour at least one of the managers and usually the owner will stop by my table to welcome and check on us.  This really goes a long way in building my loyalty.I like that the menu has more exotic spins on traditional dishes, such as the poutine with elk ragout or the scotch egg.  I may not try everything on the menu but it is nice to know it's there.  I also enjoy the comfort food dishes like fish and chips, crisp potatoes and brie, fried zucchini and the gage burger.Specialty Drinks- OK so the 5 stars is also given because of their wide selection of seasonal specialty drinks.  Right now I am in love with the Cherry Lime Ricky and Sullivan's Elixir.  These two are made with gin and the perfect spring cocktail.I dread the day I will no longer be working within a block of The Gage.  That won't stop me from still visiting 1-2 times a week just to continue my friendship with them."
"Went here with some friends last night and it was OK. I would not rush back by any means. I am also confused why it is listed as an ""Irish pub?"" Anywho....the service was great. Very attentive and friendly and gave good recommendations on the menu. We started with the scotch eggs and the fondu. Good, but not anything spectacular. I had the Rib-eye and it was actually really fatty, but very good topped with the bleu cheese. The potatoes were just ok.One of my friends had the burger, one had the chicken, one had the duck and one had another fish dish. Everyone thought the same....""good. Not great.""Overall, that was just it...good, not great and if you want to get some pub food, I would recommend somewhere else. Overpriced for what you get."
"well, this place is growing on me... my first visit I was put off cause the  fancy food seemed intimidating, but came here again for a lunch meeting and everything on the menu sounded delish. I'm not a seafood eater but I saw at the other table the fish and chips and it looked extremely tasty. So who knows, maybe i'll cave on that next time. But this time I did get their burger and it was the most perfectly cooked burger I've ever had in this city. It really was good. I would lunch to see more sandwich varieties on the lunch menu.The experience here is pretty nice, wait staff is extremely nice and helpful. The environment is modern yet comfy. cant wait to try this place for dinner! =)"
"The Gage is a favorite for me because of the food & service. The ambiance leaves much to be desired, though, due to dim lighting and NOISE! Even in the dining area (separate from the bar area) it is very difficult for me to carry on a conversation with my dining companion. But the food rules here. Tonight, we loved a rabbit salad. My fluke entrée was perfect, light and fresh, delightfully plated, with interesting accompaniments. My companion enjoyed her special arctic char, too. A chocolate flourless cake with malted milk highlights was superb in every regard. Our server was very helpful and responsive and the bussers were polished, as well. I rate it highly, noise notwithstanding, though I have to think twice every time I return -- if only they could quiet things down..."
"Pretty expensive, and rocking that pretentious yuppie vibe (a ""gastropub""?  Really?), but all things considered, I left full and happy.Drinks: Magners cider for me, some special German beer for my boyfriend - it was poured into a fancy-looking gold-rimmed goblet, which made him look like an impressive king.  A good start!Foods: We shared a Scotch Egg, having never had one before.  It was delicious, served with some amazing mustard.  Then we ordered the scallops, which came with a buttery corn salsa and topped with crispy chicken skin.  I was totally on board with the scallops and corn, notsomuch with the chicken skin - the texture was unpleasantly jagged (I don't know what other word to use, but I felt like it cut up my throat a little, Cap'n Crunch-style), and I could have done without it.  We split the homemade sausage entree, three different sausages with that yummy mustard again (win!) and an order of elk ragout poutine.  Word up - elk meat tastes good.  I'm just saying.  And poutine is way underrated here in the States.Sufficiently stuffed, we opted to skip dessert.  Our waiter was really friendly and knowledgeable, and it was nice that he was patient with us while we figured out what to order (the menu was a little overwhelming at first).  I might dock The Gage a star for its crowded tables - we were stuffed in very close to two other two-tops, and at times I felt like all of us were on some awkward triple date.  I would definitely come back to try their fish and chips and sample the dessert menu, though!  Just have to save up some money first..."
"Well done! Sometimes I'm skeptically of this kind of joint - something about trying to hard - but the Gage delivers. I stopped in for dinner and drinks with my sweetie on a Friday night, and the whole evening was really swell. The Good-Service was quite nice. The hostess promptly reseated us after I requested a table closer to the front (back room was too cold and quiet, and we wanted a more lively atmosphere). Our server Augustus (sp?) was knowledgeable about the menu, attentive but not too pushy. -Large portions (always a pleasant surprise at a nicer place)-Great attention to detail... cauliflower soup was just right but the garnishes (green apple, celery, bacon, and blue cheese) really took it over the edge.The just OK-The butter (served with warm brown bread) was topped with kosher salt. which seemed really unnecessary. Just serve good bread and butter, no need to fuel hypertension. We were too full for dessert so I can't comment on the sweets, but I hear the donuts (not on the menu right now) are killer. I'll be back. = )"
"A-OK describes this place well.  I took my family here for lunch, since I live nearby and we were going to visit the Art Institute that day.  Service was quite nice - though they did initially make a stink about seating 6 without a reservation, and the place was pretty empty, which put me off at the beginning.Coffee was aplenty, and there were a few things on the lunch menu I wanted to try.  Note that lunch prices fare more reasonable than dinner - $12-16 will get you a sandwich with fries or a salad.  I ordered the braised beef sandwich because I like sandwiches and beef.It wasn't awesome.  Mostly, it was just waaay too cheesy, and coming from a Wisconsinite, this is saying a lot.  The beef might have been tender or juicy or tasty but all I could taste was cheese and horseradish.  Kind of a turn off.Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food, including my boyfriend who ordered the same thing, so I won't be hyper-critical... but I also won't be running back any time soon."
Great food pleasant people do not miss this one
"The Gage elevates the Irish Pub to near epicurean levels. I brunched there with a group of five today, and we were all very pleased. The atmosphere was buzzing and the staff very friendly. I enjoyed a bloody mary at the bar with the bartender who hails from Ireland. Later I had a bloody caesar, which was perfect. She showed me the extensive libations menu. In addition to an amazing selection of wines, hard liquors, beers bottled and on tap, The Gage offers some really fancy custom made cocktails and alcohol-free sodas. There were great lunch specials (smoked pork sandwich served with an egg on top), a REAL irish breakfast with black & white puddings, broiled tomato, homemade rustic bread and baked beans, and a fantastic prime burger served with carmelized onions and brie. Don't forget dessert! We enjoyed a selection of their homemade ice cream (peanut butter), gelato (malted milk), and sorbet (grapefruit) as well as a white chocolate creme brulee. Lunch prices are a good value for the location and the quality of service and food."
"They pour a good Guinness pint and have an interesting selection of draught beers, but whoever says the Fish & chips are the best in the city apparently have no palette.  Doughy undercooked breading drenched in grease with undercooked fish.  Failure to correctly do $17 F&C makes me hesitant to try anything else on the menu."
"Came here on my first trip to Chicago, to have dinner with my girlfriend's cousins.  Ordered the pan seared ahi and a seasonal IPA beer.  GF ordered the duck confit.  She's a really picky eater who ordinarily avoids dark meat on poultry, and even she loved the duck.  Good food.  Friendly waiter.  Really crowded, downtown after-work vibe on a Friday night.  Would have liked to have had the chance to get more of a taste of Chicago nightlife, but maybe that's for next time."
"I am torn between a 3 and 4 star rating for this place...so I'll give it a 3.5.Had dinner at The Gage last night. Food was good, but a bit over priced for what we ordered. The mussels can't compare to Hop Leaf's, but the Gage burger was pretty good. The curry sauce was thin, which was disappointing. The decor was cool. I really liked their selection of tiles on the walls. Unfortunately, it was REALLY loud and hard to talk with companions, esp. at a table for six. It was a nice gesture when the owner, Billy Lawless, stopped at our table when I said 'hello' and he 'seemed' to remember us from his days at the Grafton. Worth a visit to experience all the hype for yourself."
"We walked to The Gage from our hotel, mostly on a lark, and were quite hugely thrilled. Of course, neither of us looked like we had any right to be there -- we arrived in our Seattle ""finest"" during after-business hours with the well-heeled money crowd -- but it hardly mattered once the food and  wine started flowing.This is one of those restaurants where you just have to ""give in"" to the menu. Don't worry too much about your personal food preferences; go for what they point you to. I ended up with some mild citrus lobster and quinoa; she ended up with (what else) house-made sausages. Both dishes were simple, delicious, excellent. We both wrapped up our meal with the house-made doughnut desert -- insanely delicious and highly recommended.Definitely worth a visit!"
"After seeing my friend perform with her ballet company, a group of us were feeling sophisticated so we thought we'd stop in The Gage for a couple of celebratory drinks. The bar area had an older crowd (30s-40s) so we decided to move our group to a table. Little did we know how sophisticated this Gage place was. With his hands tucked behind his back, our waiter explained the specials for the evening. We looked at each other nervously because all we wanted were drinks. We ended up ordering appetizers and frustrating our waiter because no one actually wanted to order entrees. We ordered scallops and were shocked that 3 scallops would cost $16! The cheese selection, also $16, consisted of 4 small cubes of cheese, little dabs of marmalade and jam, and a few nuts. Between the 6 of us, we shared 3 scallops and 4 cubes of cheese. Feeling pressured from our waiter's disdainful looks, we ordered another round of scallops. (Keeping track? 6 scallops for $32.) By the end of the night, our drinks and appetizers came out to be $180. It was totally worth it though. They were just about the best dang scallops I'd ever eaten..."
"I came here last Friday night for my 30th birthday. It took some work to get some tables, but it was well worth it. The staff were very accomodating. Our server was amazing. She was attentive and kept a drink in my hand. It was a great location for my birthday and will be coming back again and again. Thank you to my server for making sure the night went smoothly."
My friend and I ordered:House Poutine - fries with gravy with vegetables and and pieces of pork. It tasted like a pot pie which was okay. I'm wondering if the vegetables were the frozen ones because it looked like the frozen peas and carrots you get in the freezer aisle. Caramelized Onion Soup - I was really excited because it has short ribs in it but the soup was kinda watery and not that favorable.Caramelized Lobster - the best dish. I would come back to eat this dish again. Fish and Chips - I've had better fish and chips for a lesser price. My friend ordered a local porter which smelled like Guinness and taste pretty good. I order the pinot nior which was good as well. I don't know if I'd come back here again but wouldn't mind trying the other food they have on their menu.
"I came here with a couple of girlfriends for lunch before a play at Bank of America Theatre.  The CTA was on the fritz (what else is new?) so we were all a little late.  We let our server know that we had to be out within an hour and a half to catch our play, and he was incredibly kind and kept us on schedule.The restaurant is quite big - the front of the restaurant had a lot of hi-boy tables and the bar, and the back is mostly four-tops and booths.  We sat in the back, which is where I'd recommend sitting if you're having a full meal.  Here's what we ordered:Friend #1: Mixed lettuce salad and The Gage burger.  She raved over the salad (which could've passed for an entree portion) and the burger looked amazing.  I may have to try the burger on my next visit!Friend #2: Chicken noodle soup and the turkey leg confit sandwich.  The soup was good (especially with the warm bread on the table!) and her sandwich was perfect.Me: I had the pre-fixe Chef's Week menu.  I had the rutabaga soup with braised pork shoulder as my first course.  The soup was perfect, but I wasn't crazy about the pork shoulder.  For my entree, I had a braised lamb sandwich with pesto.  This was delicious, but I ate it with a fork and knife - it was too messy to eat as a sandwich!  I chose the coffee pot de creme for dessert, and I couldn't stop eating it - it was perfect!  I would go back there just for that dessert.Our server was attentive, the food was great, and the atmosphere was good.  l would definitely go back here to try out the cocktails or for another lunch!"
"Great location, good food, and a pretty decent beer selection.  The Gage was right down the street from my hotel and offered a nice atmosphere. I even went back with some friends the day after to enjoy some drinks and a World Cup game.The food was great, I had the fish and chips and split an order of fried zucchini with my wife. It was my fault, but I had way too much fried at once, and it was about 90 degrees and muggy outside. But the quality was good and I washed it down with a nice glass of Bells Oberon and then some Goose Island Matilda. I'll be back next time I'm in Chicago."
"A place situated close to the river and right across from the park.  The Gage is a hip, cool place with a nice ambiance and chic decor.  The maitre d's were pretty good looking which is always nice.  The bar was bustling and the restaurant was relatively full.The menu is divided into four courses with the first course being more a snack that people share.  The fourth course is the entree and the second and third are appetizers.I ordered the Three River Greens salad which had too much dressing.  It was like eating dressing instead of eating a salad.  For entree, I ordered the Gage burger which is bigger than the regular burger.  The bun was nice and soft and the meat was relatively large however because they used a specific cheese which was like brie (don't think it was) that over powered the flavor of the burger.  The fries were crunchy but average.The service was good from the bus boys and the manager yet the waiter was not so great.  He was kind enough to tell me about the menu yet didn't tell me about any of the specials.  He never came by and asked if I needed more water, how my food was, and etc.  Maybe it was because I ate by myself, maybe I didn't order the pricey dishes, but the manager or who seemed to be the manager did come over and check up on me.All in all, I would give the place another try because there were other items on the menu that were enticing and from hearing other diners talk, they were happy with what they chose."
"I have heard a lot of good things about The Gage. In fact, I used to work with the Head Chef/Creator, Dirk Flannigan. He is so talented and this restaurant proves it. I went for lunch at 12:30 pm on a Thursday and the place was packed as if it was Saturday night at 7:30. The staff was excellent and very accommodating. My friend suggested the Fish and Chips and they were fantastic. I try not to eat fried foods too often but this was work the extra calories. The fish was so fresh and all white. I also really enjoy the atmosphere. It's a large space but with a lot of smaller rooms so it doesn't feel like a huge restaurant. It feels warm and inviting. The decor is clean, modern and comfortable. I would certainly suggest it to anyone. I would definitely go back to try their more sophisticated dinner menu."
"I signed up Yelp after reading the reviews for 'The Gage' then eating there....It was my girlfriends birthday and we decided to get out of the Chicago suburbs and spend a night downtown.  The hotel we were staying at was close to Michigan Ave and on the suggestion of a close friend who works downtown, we went to The Gage for dinner.We decided to eat at the bar because the place was packed.  I had a 8:30 reservation and were running early (I called at 6 and the women who answered said to come at 7 and we would sit down right away) and showed up at 7.  After we showed up she told us the wait would be an hour and a half!  After sitting at the bar and making some friends with another couple, we noticed they ordered the deep fried duck livers, they looked good, so we got them.  They were decent.  The smaller pieces were great and crispy but the larger pieces were pretty bad, very mushy both outside and in.  The spicy mustard sauce that came along with it was quite good. I also noticed the couple next to us who later ate dinner, left at least half of their food on their plates.We then ordered a few 3rd course dishes...I got the Rabbit salad and she ordered the lobster bites.  The salad was quite good but the amount of rabbit was extremely small, about 1 1/2 bites.  I love rabbit and have eaten it many many times, however this 'rabbit' didn't taste or look like rabbit at all, but rather dark meat turkey (which I love).  Her lobster had been caramelized in some sort of sauce, I tried a piece and although it was a nice hunk of lobster, the sauce made it so incredibly sweet and you couldn't taste the lobster at all.For dinner she ordered duck and I ordered the ribeye.  My steak was cooked well and tasted excellent, I really enjoyed it!  As soon as they brought her duck out the gentlemen that dropped it off poured sauce all over the duck and all over her plate.  It was quite sloppily done.  I have been to many restaurants where a complimentary sauce was poured over the dish, BUT they should ALWAYS ask you to do it first!  The sauce was terrible and the duck was cooked medium well!!!!!  Come on folks, you can't over cook duck and serve it to people!  There was zero red, it was totally brown/grey looking cooked through meat and very very very tough and chewy.  The bartender who doubled as our waiter and whom was extremely nice, noticed her distaste by the look on her face.  He took it away right away and offered her anything else on the menu.  That was kind, we both really liked him.  She then ordered the chicken, but it was pretty dry, soggy skin on the outside and totally bland. We both ate a bite or two and left it.So I have some pretty mixed reviews on this place; would I ever go back? Not if I was paying.  Dropping nearly $225 on food and 2-3 drinks for us both, it was way over priced for what we received.  What you are paying for is their Michigan Ave address.I love spending good money on great food, but this was good money on very very average food.  With 5 menu items ordered (out of probably 25-30) and only one being really good, I would say we got a good taste of what this place is really about.I give The Gage 1 star for serving 1 out of the 5 items we ate as something that I thought was quite good."
"I LOVE this place!  This is one of my favorite places ever!  The combination of the atmosphere, food and service gives this place a true 5 star rating!  I have been here 8 times in the past year and it has been fantastic each and every time!  This place is so wonderful that once I brought a potential new boy there and after being there for 5 minutes he was instantly way more appealing and attractive than his normal self.  The bottle wine selection is lovely and the wine by the glass selection is delicious.  My perfect dinner here consists of the wonderful, brie-blessed fondue and splitting the fish and chips."
"Not the kind of place I would normally go to, but the boss was taking everyone out for dinner so off we went.  The place was upscale but comfortable, would be great for a low key or first date, the staff was def fine dining trained (I used to work in that industry) but was also relaxed, pleasant, jovial and earnest.  Our waiter's name was Billy, and no joke, he was probably the best server I have had HANDS DOWN in Chicago.  A neat looking environment, plenty of seating (though it was filled to the brim) and a surprisingly secluded feeling patio considering it was right on Mich Ave."
Consistent with other ratings.  Great service with excellent atmosphere playing classic rock.  The brunch items did outshine the lunch items.
"I don't know anything about the food, but the beer selection here is one of the best you'll find in the loop. Dogfishhead, three floyds, goose island - matilda, etc. You won't find this stuff on most bars' taps around here.If you're looking for a nice place to sit and have a solid beer, you can't go wrong w/ The Gage."
"According to Crain's Chicago Business, this half bar-half bistro is categorized as a ""Gastropub,"" and does everything possible to distinguish itself from the bland South Michigan Ave. area it's in.  We arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation time and were seated immediately--a first for us in Chicago restaurants.  The lively atmosphere was a blend of financial district Gordon Gekko types sipping $20 Scotch, hip academia schmoozers, a smattering of office workers in from the snow.  The draped but separate dining area offered a slight comfort from the rest of the bar.  The Gage may be owned and managed by an Irishman, but it is culinary leaps and bounds beyond Bennigan's.The food is difficult to describe.  It's eclectic: house-made sausages ($16), Amish chicken ($15), semolina and risotto soup ($19) are a few choices from a rather complex and pricey menu.  Our waiter, charming Augustus, was efficient, cheerful and knowledgeable, and I have never seen someone fill my water glass as fast as Augustus' assistant.Though the prices may keep my friend and I away from casual dining here, we would enjoy returning again."
"Located on Michigan Avenue across from Millennium Park and down steps from the Art Institute, this place has a fantastic location for tourists...which might have deterred me, being from the area...but upon dining here, the place didn't seem to have a touristy feel to it.  By no means am I an expert of fine dining, but I'm also no stranger.  This place was sweet, classy, and elegant in a casual yet upscale way.  The staff knows their stuff, including the beer list, and the ambience was nice...on a hot summer day, we sat down in an intimate cozy booth, adorned with simple white candlelight, and clean line table settings.  Our table of four ordered fish and chips, a pork medallion salad, and a turkey sandwich, along with appetizers, and dessert.  Everything was lovely.  and the Food tasted really really good.  A little pricy, but what is to be expected for this type of dining, in this location.  I'll go back next time I'm down there."
"My food here was awesome and there is a ton of vareity on the menu. I had the celery root puree and duck confit which was so pretty it was hard to eat (not really since I ate the whole thing). I love the fireplace and green glass tiles on the walls. Our server was very friendly and didn't mind splitting the checks. If you're going for lunch on a workday, plan to be there 1.5+ hours."
"First stop off the Orange line on my weekend trip to Chicago.  The Gage is surprisingly a HUGE place that has two floors with a large amount of seating and event space. The decor was very well done with a light green tiles that winds through the restaurant.  The staff is very professional down to the very attentive bussers.Food was pretty good.  We had two of the new sandwiches and I think they need to work out a couple of the kinks.  First and fore most.....  More Protein!    Both the Pork Belly sandwich as well as the Duck sausage were really great sandwiches.  I just lacked meat on both.  Btw... I was sharing, don't judge a hungry man...My only complaints really.  The dessert was a strawberry rhubarb short cake with hints of tarragon.  Pretty good but the tarragon in NO way was evenly balanced.  In my first bite I believe I got the whole leaf leaving me shocked and also causing the rest of dessert to be dull.All in all, great first lunch which left me excited about my weekend trip to Chicago."
"We stopped in Saturday night around 10:30 for drinks.  This was my first visit, and I was pretty impressed. I thought the drinks were great, and I appreciated the homemade sodas on the menu.  It was nice to have equally appetizing offerings for those who don't feel like alcohol.  I was pleasantly surprised by two things on the visit here.  First, the noise level was such that I could hear all three of my companions, and we were seated along the bar.  Definitely a good thing!  Second, one of the waiters overheard my husband ask me if my back was okay and brought a chair (with a supportive back) over to me to swap out for my backless bar stool.  Big points were scored there!I look forward to coming back for drinks and maybe dinner in the future!"
"I was all primed to say that this was a run of the mill Loop bar, with the noted exception that they serve Half-Acre beer, when in my drunkness, I realized that they served poutine.  At that point, the Gage automatically got an extra star.  My food and drink were excellent, and, somehow, my pint glass never seemed empty ... but that could have been that I had five of them in about 2 hours.But besides that, the staff was really nice, and on their game.  The downside is that it's a little expensive."
The Gage Burger was a properly made cheeseburger.  Melted Camembert and Onion Marmalade brought it to another belly filling level.  The fried chicken livers were also winners.  I am a fan!  Had to sub out the fries for a salad.  When in the downtown Chicago area do yourselves a favor and check it out.   Was very busy when we went in the afternoon (we had a 1pm reservation) so take care of things.
"Last time I was in the bartender (can't remember name, but was tall black guy with scruffy face, has worked a lot of places) was out of this world nice and helpful. He knew the beer/wine list, made great conversation and even bought me a round as a fellow hospitality manager in the neighborhood. I have always loved this place for its food and drinks, but this is the first awesome service experience I have had at this place, and it was over the top good."
"Scottish Egg!!!  Hello, hard boiled egg, wrapped in sausage, breaded and deep fried! Need I say more!The fondue, mussels and burger were delicious, as well!Coll bar right across the street from Millennium park if down there on a nice summer day."
"I was in the basement of Gage for a private dinner party and could not have been more impressed.  Gage does Gastropub in the best possible way - they do delicious, approachable food with interesting, unexpected twists.  Cinnamon salad dressing, beet salad with tart, juicy grapefruit wedges, tuna tartar on perfectly ripe watermelon slices, and duck confit stuffing were just some of the highlights.  Moreover, the staff was fantastic - professional, friendly, and attentive.    Somehow, Gage managed to be both fabulously pretentious and wonderfully comfortable at the same time.  So basically - 5 stars!"
Mmmmmm.....The Gage....if you were only closer.....Popped in with a group after the fashion show Saturday night to grab some cocktails and bites at the bar and was not disappointed! I loved our bartender.....adorable...check....Irish accent......check.....attentive....check! Seriously....I've married men for less :)Got a nice Sauvignon Blanc.....said by the glass....def more like a glass and 1/2....and in my book.....more wine = more happy!Veggie friends just ordered the Fries w/ Curry Gravy.....fries were good....gravy was okay....I've had the traditional version in an Irish pub before....and I wish the gravy was a tad bit thicker so it clung to the fries or that they would have served it over the fries so they would get all nice and gooj-y and eatable with a fork!My friend and I split the burger....and am so glad I didn't endeavor to eat that monster by myself.....it was big and messy and everything a burger should be! We ordered it medium....and it was perfect! I was still thinking about it the next day....mmmmmm....love me a good burger. I got a side of mayo for my burger and ended up dipping most of my fries in that....so did my Dutch friend : )Our other friends ordered the Fish and Chips....I tasted.....moist flaky....crunchy....flavor of the fish intact but not over powering....and not oily.....yay to the fish n' chips!!Love this place....all dark and woody and untourist-y....with food that is actually well thought out and delicious.....I wish...I wish...I wish it was closer to my 'hood....I would be a regular!
Everything about the Gage is spot on. The service is exceptionally professional. A large bar with nearly every drink imaginable. The menu has been mastered--creative and well inspired.Well done.
"So my mother and I had a girl's day out.... Henri Matisse exhibit, which was fabulous in it's own right, at the Art Institute and brunch at The Gage..The Gage exceeded all expectations.. we made resos at opentable.com which is a must! We arrived just in time for our reservation and the place was packed!We were sat at a very nice little table for 2 in a more quiet area of the place. The volume level in the bar was rising higher and higher due to the World Cup being on TV.Our server was very pleasant... went over the menus and took a cocktail order.. an awesome glass of French Rose for me and a nice spicy Bloody Mary for my mom.My mother surprised me by ordering the Eggs Benedict that was served w/ a spicy hollandaise sauce (She never orders Eggs Benedict), a side Rashers (Roasted potatoes and Brie cheese... yum) and fresh fruit. I ordered the special sandwich of the day (Which the server described beautifully).. prosciutto, fresh mozzarella cheese, arugula & stone ground mustard served on a beautiful baguette with fresh cut fries... omg. All of my favorite things in the world!When we received our meals our table fell silent due to the fact that we were just truly loving our meals... oh was it good.The only problem that we found.. and this is way minimal.. the bathrooms were down this stairway with no proper signage... you could get lost down there ie the private party room.. which looked pretty cool (I would have an event there). So like I said the problem is ultra small!I will surely come back with my husband... and enjoy one of the many craft beers they have on tap!"
"Recommended to us by the staff at a local gallery, we enjoyed lunch here in April 2012. We thought the food was fairly priced for The Loop location, and all three of us enjoyed our sandwiches and soup -- on that day the special soup was lobster bisque. Not as creamy as some we've had, but very flavorful. We were warmly greeted by all the staff we encountered, including the owner. We arrived for lunch after the rush, which I recommend for less noise."
"Great atmosphere great beer list and excellent food, thanks!"
"Wow, what a spectacular time! Its not cheap, but boy was it a blast! I'm a pretty picky eater, but enjoyed trying new things and ate Elk and Rabbit and was pleasantly surprised at how yummy it was! Food was excellent, service was great and my friends  from Michigan thoroughly enjoyed themselves.Then again, we could have enjoyed our meal at a mcdonald's but that's not the point. Trying new foods at places like this with great friends is what makes these dinners special.HIghly recommended if you're adventurous. They do offer Steak and Salads, but experiment a bit, you might like it!"
"The Gage is a great place for groups and is very welcoming whether you are a 20-, 30-, 40, 50-, or beyond-something. I have come with friends and it is now my family's standing place for Father's Day brunch.I booked today's brunch via OpenTable.com and requested a seat towards the front, away from the kitchen. The food as always was stellar. The potatoes with brie are fantastic! I also had the day's quiche, which had zucchini, squash, tomatoes, and goat cheese. They were a bit too generous with the goat cheese and it overwhelmed the overall quiche but I wasn't wholly unsatisfied by it. It came with a really lovely side salad as well. My mom always gets the scotch egg, which she adores. She paired it with the day's watermelon soup and was extremely pleased. My dad really enjoyed the corned beef hash and had a side of goat cheese grits with it. He was incredibly happy with the meal.Millenium Park is right across the street so The Gage is a great place to go for a meal or a drink and then take a stroll around the park afterwards."
"I know reviewing a place with 300 reviews (now 301) is kind of pointless, but I was so pleased with my experience at The Gage that I thought I needed to give it props.Notable dishes from our dinner there tonight included the 'fondue' starter, and the vanilla bean cheese cake.  The latter dish, in particular, impressed me; I think it just might be the most tasty dessert I've had the pleasure of eating.  I was also happy with their very robust beer selection - brews were thoughtfully chosen and well described.The downside to this place, of course, is the price.  This is definitely a once-a-year kind of treat for our budget, but it was well worth the experience.  All of our food was prepared excellently; the staff was on the ball and extremely friendly; and the environment was just right.  If you're having a 'date night' out or need to impress some important clients, I would definitely recommend going for broke here."
"It was Chef's Week this weekend. I knew I came to Chicago for a reason. And The Gage was the best choice for a restaurant on Saturday night. We got there late, but the elegant restaurant was still full and the staff were warm and inviting.At the candle lit table, we had two big glasses of Domaine de la Solitude Côte du Rhone - c'est fantastique! Not to mention a certain waiter with a smokey voice had an extensive knowledge of the wine list AND spoke french. We purred.Be sure to ask for Justin at The Gage. He's as good as waiters get -- very attentive, charming, and knowledgable about all the drinks and dishes offered. If we needed anything or were even thinking about ordering another glass of wine, he was right at our side. We liked that.The food? Orgasm in my mouth. Not joking. I had quail (I think it was roasted) stuffed with house made sausage with thin slices of potatoes and sauerkraut. My friend had roasted chicken with a type of squash sauce and crunchy brussel sprouts with apples and goat cheese. *Salivate* Overall night -- just perfect. It was the best dining experience I've ever had."
"Great food, very knowledgable staff...very difficult to get a table"
"The Gage is a wonderful British inspired bar and eatery.  The feel and overall vibe of this place manages to be warm & cozy in a slightly upscale and aesthetically pleasing environment.  I love to come here and just curl up at the bar with a delicious drink and catch a soccer game,  Their list of libations is extensive and creative and their menu stays true to its British roots.I highly recommend the potato soup and fish & chips."
"Great spot. The roast duck was excellent as were the scallops. Twice in about 5 minutes, the food delivery guy came by my table with a meal I didn't order. It was a fast floor so I assumed he just messed up the table number or something. However, for that my glass of wine was on the house. Unrequested (and unnecessary really) but a nice touch on their part. And the cappuccino I had to close the meal was really terrific. One thing though; don't be put off by the lack of a dress code. This is the sort of place where tuxedos dine along side sleeveless t-shirts."
"The wife and I stopped in at The Gage this past Friday after the Hopper/Homer exhibit at the Art Institute. When we walked in the restaurant, which was around 5:30pm, we were told it was going to be a 2 1/2 hour wait without reservation! Luckily, we were also told that we could go downstairs where there was a bar and order food. After making our way through the crowded upstairs bar, we found the stairs to the basement bar. I was surprised at how nice it was down below. And how empty. We found a table right away and ordered food and drinks. Apparently, we got there at the right moment because by the end of our meal the downstairs bar was packed. Okay, let's talk about the food. We started off with the Gage Fondue appetizer. According to the menu, the cheese filling was made of butter kaase, brie and spinach. It's served with long strips of toast. And it was fantastic. The folks sitting next to us saw us enjoying ours and ordered one for themselves. There seems to be a lot of recommendations for the Scotch Egg. But if you're with a party where you don't know if everyone is going to be down with eating an egg for an appetizer, you might want to look into the Fondue. For dinner, the wife got the fish and chips.  Like many others I'm sure, we had seen the Metromix piece about the fish and chips and wanted to try them out. My wife, who has tired multiple fish and chips dishes around the city, ranked them up with the best. If you didn't catch the TV piece, the fish and chips are wrapped in a newspaper. Check out the photo I've added. I got the prime burger with blue cheese, and it was one of the best burgers I have had in this city. And the chips or fries were extremely tasty as well although they give you way more than you could possibly eat. My only complaint for The Gage is the price. $17 for fish and chips?!? $16 for a burger?!? Come on! Still, I knew beforehand of the extreme prices so I wasn't shocked. However, the inflated prices will certainly deter me from making The Gage a regular spot. Of course, if you live or work in the area, it might be the perfect place to meet up for drinks and enjoy an amazing appetizer. And if you in the mood to splurge, an amazing meal as well."
"The Gage, at best, is just alright.  It's riding the gastropub trend with a largely hit or miss success rate.  I've been 4 times, and the food has ranged from good to boring.  The last night I was there I had venison carpaccio which was pretty tasty, though an extra quail egg would have made the dish far better. I then had a ribeye which was overpriced and under flavored.  I was most disappointed last time by the general experience.  My date and I came in at 10:30 and were seated in the back room next to another couple. The woman from that couple threw her napkin down, made some sort of furious comment and stormed off.  Next thing I know, a waiter is convincing me why I want to be seated a few tables away. The whole thing was absurd and insulting. Before I would go here because they were open late and had passable food, but that experience sealed my original judgments of the place.  It just isn't very good."
"We were looking for a gastropub in Chicago and we were very happy from start to finish with the Gage.So many of the appetizers looked good we decided to order four appetizers instead of entrees and it was a good meal.  The pate board was really good, beef tar-tar was really good.  Beer list was good though not spectacular.The table next two ordered sandwiches that looked really good.Definitely would go back."
"I was meeting a friend and Chicago native for lunch, and he picked The Gage. Serves me right for not specifying a cheap greasy spot where I could get a famed hot dog or slice of deep dish.Instead, I was met with a lot of suits. Navy pinstripe ones. These people are serious, and at lunchtime there was a lot of power being thrown around up in here. Well there was that, and then there were the tourists. An interesting mix, but after spending several years in DC it didn't surprise me.We were seated in the very very back next to the kitchen. Whatever, I know 3 25 year olds aren't the prime clientele. I wasn't all that hungry so I ordered a caesar salad, which I fully realize is not the proper way to gauge (har) a place like this, but hey, it's what I wanted and was pretty much the only thing in my limited price range. The salad was fine, nothing incredible. One of my dining companions ordered a burger cooked medium and it arrived bloody and RED. Now, I'm not one of those paranoid folks who freaks out over how my meat is cook-- I prefer it medium rare, and I'm alright if it's a little bloody. But even I don't think I would have eaten this. So she sent it back and about 10 minutes later was met with an equally bloody burger. At this point she had to get back to work, so she scrapped the whole thing. While they didn't charge us for the burger, they certainly weren't all that apologetic. And since we were practically sitting *in* the kitchen we got to hear the manager yell at the cook for it. Quelle ambiance! So yes, it appears that my one experience here was very much out of the norm, but with all of the fantastic restaurants in Chicago and the high prices I can't see ever returning."
"I just got back from dinner at The Gage with my roommate.  The place was packed, the food was delicious, and the service was quick and cute.  He even showed us his tattoos - ""Passion"" on one forearm, and ""Humility"" on the other.You can't really buy wine by the glass - either get a bottle or a carafe, and if you only want a carafe (about 2 glasses worth), you've got a limited selection.  The menu has plenty of small dishes to choose from, as well as the main courses.  I just had an appetizer (chosen from the course 3 list) - a delicious goat cheese tart with mushrooms on top - and a side dish - winter squash with bacon.  Yum!  My roommate had a FANTASTIC risotto (she gave me a bite - good roomie!)"
"I think the place is slipping, or maybe they're just holiday tired.  The food is not a crisp as it used to be, and the service is certainly not as fresh as it used to be.  I'll see again after the holidays, but the last couple of times has been less than expected.  May be time for a shake up.Oh, and they took the donuts of the dessert menu--criminal."
"After having been here twice now for lunch (once with some cool Yelpers and Yelpers-to-be) I think I'm qualified to rate it.This place is way bigger inside than I thought it was looking at it from the outside in my many times walking past. It's narrow but deep. I feel like there's a dirty joke to be made in there somewhere, but my coffee just isn't working today, so neither is my brain. It's very nice inside. A pleasant shade of green...sort of an upscale pub with tablecloths and cloth napkins. The servers are all smartly dressed. The people at the host station are OK. Not terribly friendly but not exactly unfriendly either.The food is very good. First I had the Gage burger. At a whopping $16 for burger & fries, it's a bit spendy but it's doggone tasty. The waitress recommended it since she said it was the best burger she'd ever had. I wouldn't go that far (about me that is...it could very well be true for her) but I definitely liked it a lot. One word of warning, however: it's messy to eat. This was OK with me, but if you're there as part of a job interview or something, you might not want burger juice or fixins dribbling down your hands while you eat. You will make use of that nice white (at least to start with) cloth napkin. On my second visit I tried the fire roasted chicken sandwich, which is Gage's version of  buffalo chicken. I enjoyed that as well. It was flavorful with just the right amount of spicy kick. There was perhaps just a bit too much blue cheese. This sandwich is just as messy as the burger. I had fries both times and they were good as well. Not blow-your-mind (or something else) good, but a solid accompaniment to your meal.The service is generally good, though at one point the waitress disappeared for awhile when I needed an ice tea refill. Water glasses were kept full by the attentive bus staff. It does get busy at lunch time, and the place fills up with suits. You'd probably feel a bit under dressed in jeans, but if that doesn't bother you then you're fine. It gets quite loud in here, so it's not a good place for a quiet conversation. The prices are a bit high for lunch, but I don't think they're unjustified.This is a good place for a tasty weekday bite, but the price point (and relative lack of healthfulness of the menu options) makes this an ""occasional treat"" lunch spot rather than a weekly thing. Of course if someone else is picking up the tab, by all means suggest the Gage...just watch out for the sloppy eats during business lunches."
"A solid four, creeping towards five-dom. Nice atmosphere, with good lighting and a few pleasant Irish brogues among the waitstaff; just ever so slightly too loud for unstressed conversation. This is my first experience with a ""gastropub"" (I'm pretty sure this translates to ""English/Irish/Scottish food tweaked for American tastes"", but that's fine with me) and our food was delicious. Even the complementary bread was several steps above your typical dinner roll - some sort of sourdough thing going on there. The risotto was wonderful: lightly cheesy with onions, kale, and roasted cauliflower thrown in. EXCELLENT vegetarian option in an otherwise meaty menu. And the food came out quite quickly - always a plus when you have a rather late dinner reservation. :) My dining companion's food was not quite as tasty, though still good - while the goat cheese tart disappeared quickly, the squash with applewood bacon was taken away unfinished.I am generally pretty suspicious of more expensive places, but The Gage was impressive. It's Restaurant Week, kids! Get out there and take advantage! Can't beat the location, either, right smack across from Millenium Park. Impress your Chicago-visiting friends!"
"My friend recommended this place for late night drinks, since she lives down the street. The place was bustling with the corporate folk and tourists. It was pretty spacious on a Monday night. We grabbed a bar table towards the back and hung around for a while. I tried a ginger cocktail (too weak) and a seasonal beer on top. I didn't try any food but this place seemed pretty standard with good service."
"Head to The Gage or a wonderful dining experience. Greeters, servers, runners, bussers all are well trained in making diners feel comfortable. Our server was so helpful in guiding us to the right beers from the enormous list.They also offer four ounce pours of wine which is so nice if you want something small or just wish to sample a few. They split a salad in the kitchen for us which is always a sign of a place that knows how to please. Fresh mushroom soup was delicious. Pork chop entree was cooked to perfection. Tuna was fresh and well seasoned. Even fish and chips were spot on. The only drawback is the noise level. However, the farther you go into the restaurant, the less noise as the place is large and deep."
"I love The Gage. Every experience I've had there (so far at least) has been perfect. Service has always been prompt and friendly, and my food has always been brought to my table exactly how I wanted it prepared.For those who enjoy a sweet, creamy dessert drink, I highly recommend their Chocolate Martini."
"Had the fish and chips for lunch and it was very tasty.  A good sized portion of delicious, crispy but tender fish and the chips/fries were really good.  Good beers on draft too.  I would like to come back for dinner since there were so many appealing options on the menu."
"I went there once and it was pretty tasty.  It was for business and the other people picked up the tab so I was happy (you can easily spend over $20 on lunch if you get soup with your meal)I had some soup.  I can't remember what it was but I remember I liked it.  (basically I remember my meals so if I don't remember it probably was not worth remembering)my sandwich was an open faced brisket sandwich with some kind of cheese, fuji apples, and some micro greens (think small lettuce you buy in those bags of premixed salad).  I asked for some of the curry sauce for the fries.  That was def worth remembering.I do not live in the area, but if I'm back in that area I would stop by for lunch and possibly a beer or two.  Speaking of which the beer selection looked a little weak for a place that should be a gastropub.  At least they got the gastro part down pretty well."
"Location, atmosphere, food, and beer selection at a steep price."
"Ok, so I am learning what this term Gastropub means and I get it.  So, let's compare The Gage with State and Lake. They are both called gastro pubs and both seem to cater to the after work or downtown tourist crowds. They both are a bit cramped and can get a bit loud. And you'll likely pay about the same. HOWEVER - where State and Lake is dark and poorly organized, The Gage allows some semblance of privacy in the multiple compartments and semi-segregated rooms. The Gage is bright and airy with natural light coming in from the Michigan Avenue windows. The Gage has friendly staff, one particularly HOT bartender, a fun and fairly diverse clientele, and fantastic service from host station to meal to exit.If you're looking for a romantic night out or a quiet dinner with a good friend, stop, turn around and go West away from Michigan Ave toward Blackbird or another West Loop spot.  If you're debating where to go after the Art Museum or a Chicago Symphony performance and you like the idea of a Gastropub, say ""NO WAY"" to State and Lake and go to The Gage, about 3 blocks away.For lunch, order the Prime Rib sandwich - IT IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! They even changed it recently to give me a bit of variety even though I always order the same thing!"
"This is an Irish pub, but not your run of the mill pub, it's a little more high class than the Guinness pounding, whisky swilling, fish & chips pubs that we all know and love.  But what else do you expect from a pub on Michigan Ave.     I just stopped in for a quick bite, had a Irish coffee, and we shared a heaping bowl of mussels.  Based off the first look I'd definitely go back.  Though be warned, with the higher end fare comes higher prices."
"I only waited 10 minutes while sitting at the bar in front of all of the so very busy bartenders and even then had to ask the barback for a glass of wine. He might I add was so very nice and professional.  Then, minutes later one of the blond bartenders hands me my glass of wine with my check out and a curt thank you. Seriously, I have been treated better at McDonalds!  I really do not think I would have been the courtesy of a hello if it was not for the great bar helper whose name I did not get.  I guess must be so busy that it forgets to say hello or ask if you would like something to drink.I don't feel it is that great of place to have to wait or be treated so rudely to come back.  I told the manager, ""Nick"" of my experience and he listened as they all do and politely ask I come back(for what? poor service?) He then said, "" thank you for letting me know Hon."" Really ""HON!"" I am 41 years of age, do you thing this is respectful?  HON!  I will never go back.  River North has way better bars and lounges that do not call their fellow patrons HON!"
"The tables are VERY close together, but the food was very good. Fish and chips was excellent. Nice ambiance."
"Aside this being really delicious, the location is prime. On Michigan Avenue across from Millennium Park.  I'm noting this because you know that means that tourists or their families, fly like bullets at this location at certain times of day - particularly on the weekend.  I consider it safest after 6pm during the week, and after 7pm on the weekend.  Lunch hour can be open or slammed (so be smart and have a reservation).Personal delights: The mussels, house poutine (elk ragout covered fries), beet salad, seared scallops, wagyu sirloin, the gage burger, the brisket sandwich, fish and chips (yes wrapped in paper like they're suppose to be), turkey leg foncit, pheasant thigh appetizer, caramelized lobster, aged ribeye, deconstructed french toast dessert.There are few things I haven't enjoyed here (the lunch menu version of roasted chicken could be better - not sure if the meat is given a brine but it should be).  I once had a salmon sandwich I didn't love.  But other than just a couple of experiments gone a rye, the food and expectations are met above and beyond.A fancy pub...with fancy pub food.  That's what it is, and that's what you get.  And then it goes into an eclectic beer selection, great cocktails, impressive wine selection, and the ""champagne charlie"". TOP FIVE REASONS TO GO TO THE GAGE: 1) It's some of the best food you'll get in the loop (like it or not) 2) The The mussels, house poutine (elk ragout covered fries), beet salad, seared scallops, wagyu sirloin, the gage burger with a cold beer on the right day is perfect, the brisket sandwich, fish and chips (yes wrapped in paper like they're suppose to be), turkey leg confit, pheasant thigh appetizer, caramelized lobster, aged ribeye, deconstructed french toast dessert. 3) Great array of beers and wine 4) Great location 5) (when it's not slammed!) It's very good serviceTOP FIVE REASONS NOT TO GO TO THE GAGE: 1) It can be annoying to be there when tourist rush is invading 2) It's so good and so popular it can be really loud at certain hours 3) Certain sandwiches on the lunch menu are a miss (although the rest of the menu is outstanding and with great quality ingredients) don't let a mosquito's wing throw you off the track 4) Little to no parking 5) The half sandwich half soup menu item should have more generous portions"
"Came here last summer while visiting Chicago before training. We had been walking around all day and wanted to get a drink or snack before having a real dinner. We had heard this place was good so we walked alll the way down Michigan avenue from one end until we reached it finally. It's right next to Millenium Park so it's around a nice area. So we ended up having beer. We also got the Chips (fries) which came with this really good gravy sauce to dip it in. This was very good and probably the only reason I remember this place. I have tried to find a recipe to make the curry sauce, that's how good it was. There really wasn't anything particularly fascinating about this place. Maybe if we ate there I might say something different, but to come here for drinks, it wasn't really what I thought it would be."
"Maybe the stars just weren't in alignment, but I had a borderline rotten time here. We were having dinner with a friend and had made reservations in advance, but we ended up sitting at the worst table in the whole place. (Hello! A pregnant woman should not be seated right by the stairs, way out in the aisle, where people are constantly asking her to scoot in so they can get by.)And even though I am absolutely NOT the kind of person who says, ""I can't believe how small these portions are"" or ""I can't believe how much they charge for that,"" I was muttering these very things under my breath. The halibut was excellent, but when that teeny tiny piece of fish appeared before me, with fifteen peas and a quarter-sized dollop of whipped golden beets, I seriously laughed out loud. And then I ordered some mashed potatoes. Puzzlingly, the entrees my husband and our friend ordered were so big, they had to take them home in doggie bags.When the day comes that I can eat undercooked meat and drink imported beer again, I will definitely give The Gage another whirl. I mean, how can 300+ Yelpers be wrong?"
"A perfect day downtown.  Lunch at The Gage and a viewing of the new Modern Wing at AIC.  I was impressed by The Gage.  The service was outstanding.  I arrived a bit early and the hostess was very courteous in asking if I would like to be seated or wait for my companion.  I opted to go ahead to the table.  While waiting, I perused the drink menu.  Champagne at lunch on a Monday?  Of course, why not?  I had the Champagne Charlie which was beautiful and crisp.  But, back to the service...  Little touches like a napkin placed on the lap by the server, or listening to the server at the next table explain the notes and flavors of different wines, it just makes the experience.  I'm thinking a date night is in order, who wants to take me?For a starter we had the Scotch Egg.  A hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage and panko, then fried.  Amazing.  I had a chicken sandwich which was covered in blue cheese, hot sauce and fresh basil.  Absolutely decadent.  The decor had me swooning a bit as well.  Dark woods, light green tiles and lovely lighting.  Again, perfect for a date.  Must go back."
Fantastic!..We met for a business lunch. I had the Vindaloo and it was simply fantastic. My friend ordered the salmon sandwich and he really liked it too..The service was great and the entire experience was awesome.
"a solid 3 stars for the food. The gage is a HUGE place. Big, noisy, with a somewhat adventurous menu. Our group had a wide assortment of food, including antelope tartar, chicken livers, hanger steak, risotto, fish & chips etc. The food was all good. Not great, but certainly above average. I would say the risotto was uninspired, but all in all, the food was well executed for a restaurant of this size. Service was a bit slipshod.  The wrong food was originally brought to our table, a forgotten drink order...   ...all quickly fixed at least.  It IS very noisy, and I'm not too big on the idea of a place that spendy  which has a lot of highchairs and screaming bratty kids. Hopefully, that was an anomaly, but still... a lot of highchairs...Carry on."
"Since the office was a bit quiet, I decided to work from home today.  And by ""work from home"", I mean go to lunch and to the Art Institute with a friend.  I have been wanting to try the Gage since it opened and to my delight she agreed with my selection, so we met up around 12:30.  It was busy, but not overly so.  She started with a Champagne Charlie (made with Grand Marnier, blood orange bitters, and a rock of candied ginger in prosecco).  It was pretty good.  I had a Gage Ginger Fizz (Jameson, candied ginger, and I don't remember what else) and it was okay.  I also had an Old Fashioned, which was wonderful.  We split a Scotch Egg (hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage, coated with panko bread crumbs and fried, served with stone ground mustard) and it was surprisingly delicious.  She had a fire roasted chicken sandwich and I had the peppered salmon club sandwich.  Both were big, tasty portions which we could not finish.  I wish we had had room for dessert, but alas, we did not.  Service was very friendly and helpful with suggestions.I am eager to return and try them for dinner (and another Old Fashioned)."
"The Gage! I wanted to visit you for a friend's birthday brunch earlier this year, but plans fell through and now I seriously regret the decision. We arrived for Day 2 of (epic) Restaurant Week, and after a disappointing dinner last night I was concerned about how lunch would go. On entering, I was happy to see that there were young couples, older couples, and families all here for brunch and a good time. My boyfriend, the wannabe pediatrician, was delighted to see crayons and paper topped tables for the kiddies to scribble on. Read: do not confuse family friendly with screams and cries interrupting your meal, everyone was extremely well-behaved and it was as if the children were not present. We examined the brunch, lunch, and RW menus, as well as the drinks list. There's definitely a mark-up (we call it the Millenium Park tax), but the food we saw around us looked tasty and reasonably-portioned for price. We still opted for the RW prix fixe  menu ($22), and started with the celery root puree (soup) with pork confit and braised cabbage. Light, creamy, and very, very subtly tart, I loved the contrast of the sprout tendrils with the soft creaminess of the soup, and the rich, buttery shreds of pork that would pop up every other mouthful. For lunch, we opted for both the duck confit, fried egg, and focaccia sandwich and the whitefish with rye gnocchi. I was in love with first bite. The duck confit (purportedly barbequed) was buried in a flash of spicy, bitter greens, an over easy egg, and a pungent, spicy sauce, and I was impressed with the use of toasted focaccia instead of traditional sesame seed buns. I thought it was a better pairing with the duck, but The Boy disagreed and felt it absorbed too much of the oil from the fillings. The whitefish was EXCELLENT, and I am not amused by what much of Chicago considers well-prepared fish. It calls to mind the Chinese tradition of steaming the fish before finishing it with a hot blaze of scalding oil -- tender, flaky (while avoiding being overdone), with a delicate, seared crisp on both the skin and the surface. It laid on a bed of yummy greens that while sweet, interesting, and new, I felt were slightly too greasy to be overlooked, especially when paired with a light fish. The gnocchi was light and savory, without acheiving the chewy rubberiness that is the bane of all gnocchi consumers' existence. And finally....oh, dessert. We usually skip when we dine out, seeing as it's an extra, unnecessary push towards diabetes and we don't see desserts we're interested in anyways. They hit home with homemade fritters and a dollop of butter pecan-y ice cream. I don't think this is included on the menu available online, but if there is a reason to skip breakfast or do an extra mile on teh treadmill, this dessert may be worth it. Served warm, it's best eaten with a smearing of the ice cream and a dusting of the caramel, toffee bits served on the plate. The anticipation, as Phyllis Lapin Vance would say, is exquisite. When you go (and you MUST go), be sure to try their homemade sodas. The grapefruit soda is tart and sweet, the lime soda more obvious about the simple syrup. Be sure to check out the postings on the wall as you go down to the bathroom, as they pay homage to the Gage buildings formerly housing a millinery and what kind of advertisements were popular at the time. One word of caution: drinks are pricier here than even in the Gold Coast, so I would go elsewhere for these. Service: our server was attentive, cleared the table quickly, and knew that we needed more time to muse over the menus without being annoying. I also appreciate her noticing we had not tasted our plates yet when she came over to check on how we liked them -- too often that is a reflex question in the service industry!Score:+1/1 for service+0.5/0.5 for ambiance+3/3 for food+0.5/0.5 for valueFinal tally: 5 stars. I fully plan on returning with out of town friends and family, and am (not so sheepishly) considering a triumphant return as soon as I finish digesting lunch. Thank you for such an excellent time!"
"It is not often that I find myself dining in the Loop. I am not really the biggest fan of what the area has to offer. Alas, my girlfriend had a voucher for discounted Amtrak tickets that she had to actually go to Union Station in order to use, which is quite annoying. Oddly enough, she received the voucher due to Amtrak being pretty horrible and delaying her train by some god-awful-ridiculous length of time and her having to call and complain. Their answer, ""Sorry. Here is a voucher for a discount on a future train ticket, but in order to use it you have to come down to Union Station and stand in line forever only to be waited on by our charming staff that we have recruited from a pool of ex-postal employees."" And so we found ourselves in the Loop on a Friday evening.I did some research to try and find somewhere interesting to go for dinner. We decided upon The Gage, mostly because I love when restaurants use game meats and I am a big fan of things like house-made sausages, rillettes, and most of all foie gras. We did not make reservations and it was a Friday evening, so I did have a back-up plan just in case. We arrived and were told it would be an hour or we could try the bar, which is first come, first serve. Being it was our first time here, I opted to wait the hour and get a table in the dining area. So we went and hung out in Millennium Park for a while to waste some time.We came back to The Gage and were seated fairly quick. The food menu was a little strange in layout, but everything on it sounded delicious. The drink menu was quite nice. Tasty cocktails, good wine, and a pretty good beer list with selections from Three Floyd's, Unibroue, Dogfish Head, Two Brothers, and several more, including a couple of British beers I am unfamiliar with.Getting down to the main reason we came to The Gage, I will discuss the food. It was very good. The House Poutine, which was my first poutine, was awesome. Fries, gravy, cheese curds, elk... Heaven. The fondue was also very delicious. Next, we tried the goose, foie gras, and duck rillettes. It was the best. I have had rillete at my school. I have made rillete myself. And I had the rillette at The Bristol, which was very good, but this was the best. And the presentation was great. To finish off the night, I had the locally crafted sausages, which were very good, and my girlfriend had ""The Gage"" burger, which was also good, but too big. And actually, my only real complaint about The Gage was the portion sizes. I am sure that most people think it is wonderful and a lot of people in this country feel that if they can move after their meal then they got ripped off, but I am starting to disagree, as of late. I much prefer feeling like I could eat a little more, but shouldn't, than feel stuffed to capacity. Anyway, now I know for next time that everything on the menu, even the items listed as snacks, comes in a hearty portion.One last thing... I should say that the service was quite good. The Gage was pretty busy. Packed, even. And service, other than our server being a little weird, was very quick and attentive. A+."
"Thursday night, 2 people, after a show.Food was good.  Only a handful of people at the bar and the seated area was cleared out.  Although this place is slated to be open until 2 am, we were asked to put in our food order by 11 pm or we couldn't get anything hot.  This is kind of a quiet part of town during the week.  So if you are looking for a mellow time on a Thursday and staying close, I would try it.  If you have to walk and could find a place closer, I would skip it."
"What kind of name is this? I had no interest in coming here, until we saw the classy interier, and amazing menu for lunch/brunch options. My sushi craving was put aside for an irish breakfast. The place is next to milenium park, with patio and inside seating. The rooms are compartmentalized, so it feels cozy inside.The food was excellent. I got eggs benedict with the sauce on the side. Yummy!  The potatos were crispy (which I love), but i'm not a brie/potato fan. I wish we could come back for dinner. Next time!"
"One of the best burgers in Chicago. Really nice ""Pub"" on Michigan Ave. GREAT food! Had the fondue app and it is not to be missed!! Also, some of the best ""Fish/Chips"" anywhere! Don't expect to go here looking to spend $20 on lunch, a lil expensive.."
"I have a new motto - when in doubt, follow Reuben H.  That's right - that man knows his brunches/lunches/dinner/food!Reuben organized a group to do the MS Walk (which was a smashing success, btw). He also made post-race brunch reservations for us at The Gage - which I mistakenly thought was simply going to be yet another boring Irish Pub/Bistro. Yawn.....ZZZZZzzz.....with boring food. Au contraire! Was I in for a treat! FIND!Because I was dining with the Yelping Queens of Mussels (aka Erin and Aurore), even though it was only 11 a.m. we ordered the mussels from the lunch menu - Mussels Vindaloo served with a long baguette toast. I am no conneisseur of mussels but I am here to tell you they were great and I will most definitely order them again and again.The Eggs Benedict with rashers (thin slices of fried bacon) was served with a tasty Spicy Hollandaise which was a little skimpy on the sauce - personally I would have liked more sauce - OINK - but was delicious.  The dish also comes with a side of the brie potatoes - another must order. We also tried from the dinner menu an order of the Brussels Sprouts w/ Brie & Applewood Bacon - I would order these again!For those who are health nuts and/or need a colon cleansing, I would recommend the Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal Brûlée w/ Granola, Berries, Cream, Brown Sugar & Nuts. OH!  And they brew a fine strong cup of Julius Meinl coffee - score!I want to thank The Gage for being so accommodating to our group of 20. There was no hassle or attitude - even though we were a tad late due to the walk - and our two 10-tops were awaiting our arrival with open arms. We had perfect service - fabulous food - great company - in a warm inviting atmosphere of ""refined rusticity, steps away from Millennium Park.""  What more can you ask for?"
"The Gage is exactly the place I was looking for this weekend during a night out with two of my girlfriends.  A classy, upscale pub with a great selection of beer, unique menu and an atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.  Plus, they have a staff with a knack for recommending tasty delights, even when seated at the bar.  Bartender Sterling advised us to try the Skirt Steak, Mussels and side of squash....all were de-lish!I'm looking forward to going back for a full dining experience."
"Wow - I'm certainly impressed! We ended up here before an Art Institute event because we were dying to try somewhere new in the Loop area. Seriously, restaurants right in that area are boring. The Gage is quite the exception. We arrived about 7pm on a Friday and it was packed. There was no seating left in the dinning area for us but that was not a problem as their bar area is mammoth. There are upstairs and downstairs bars and each is bursting with table tops and small tables. The menu is great. Its sectioned up by 'courses', but it appeared that most orderd/shared food tapas style. We ordered the Duck Egg on Mushroom toast, the Fried Chicken Livers and the Mussels in Vindaloo. Everything was absolutely fantastic.  The portions are quite big. I would say the first course items (""snacks"" as they call them), are a nice sized apppetizer. The ""first course"" items are a dish in themselves. Other things: service was friendly. Our waitress was also the bar tender so it wasn't the quickest service. However, she did a nice job for being the only employee in that area. I had only ONE thing to complain about. The beer prices for Belgian beers. Okay, I know prices for imported Belgian beers like Kwak and Chimay will be pricey. I'm use to seeing the prices for about $7-10, that's common. But $14 Belgian beer? The house wine prices were also extremely pricey. The high alcohol prices probably correlates with the location of the restaurant, but still, $14?  So overall, VERY big fan of their food. But unless they have some nice drink specials I'll stay away from the beer/wine."
"Good location to go to an event at the Harris Theater or the symphony.  It's loud but if you can tolerate a consistently high noise level, the lively atmosphere is fun.We each ordered a burger.  The gage upgrade hamburger was good, if just a touch over done for medium.  The venison burger was terrific.  Ordering the two and sharing highlighted that the kaiser roll for the hamburger was just a waste of space while the pretzel roll for the venison burger was tasty and the perfect texture.  Flavor on the venison burger was great but it's a huge burger with all the toppings.  Plenty of good fries on the side and nice pickles as a garnish.  Scallop appetizer was pretty tasty.  Bread served to the table had good flavor but dry and crunchy.  Good service every time."
"Went here on a date night and it was the right call... This Irish gastro is a perfect date spot. I would go as far as to call it a ""deal sealer"" spot. The decor is really nice, lots of tile throughout, brass, dark woods, nice lighting, etc. We had a short wait at the semi packed bar, they have a number of tasty sounding house drinks but I went with old faithful and had a Jameson on the rocks. The bartender was attentive and regardless of the crowd made you feel like the only guest. The menu is expansive and typical gastro pub style with tons of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th course items. The service is outstanding, no pressure to order, very knowledgeable staff. All musts when on a date. For a starter we ordered the Scotch egg which I've never had before...thing looks like a deep fried dinosaur egg but once you cut into its amazing. Picture a tasty breakfast rolled into one egg shaped item, egg was perfect, tasty sausage inside, crust wasn't soggy, and the side of spicy mustard simply made the dish.  We also had the fries (chips) with the curry gravy, which was just awesome but the serving is so massive that its too much for two people and you feel like a fat ass eating all of that gravy.We split 2 entrees, the peppered hanger steak that comes with a feta, watermelon, basil, mint salad which is a great cool compliment to the spicy steak. This was a hit. We also split the locally bought whitefish that comes with mushrooms in a very light broth.  The fish was perfectly cooked but I just wish there was more with the plate. Overall the place has great food, great service, and a very expansive menu. Great for trying to impress that girl you like. 1.) You bring her to the loop so you look like a guy that branches out of your comfort zone 2.) Its a gastro pub so you look cool and like a guy who is in the know of what's hip and you can spend 20 minutes on what a cool guy you are and how your taste buds have ""matured over the years""3.) The menu has everything from elk to boring ass chicken so if she is lame and unadventurous she will still be OK. If you are on the cusp with a lady friend then this place will get it done."
"I enjoyed dinner with a party of six at The Gage last night and had quite a nice time overall. Arriving at 7:30 on a summer Friday evening, our first impression was how much louder it was inside than out on busy Michigan Avenue and Millennium Park. I mean, REALLY loud. The upscale, but rustic charm of the space barely outshined the acoustical challenges, but we were promptly seated at a big comfy half-circle booth near the back of the house. Our server was witty, attentive and on his game despite the fact that he was obviously waiting several busy tables. Only once did he leave me with an empty glass long enough for another gentleman (headwaiter?) to cut in and offer to refresh my empty pint glass. Nice touch. The bottle list was pretty good, but the selection of drafts was a little sparse for a gastropub. Regardless, I loved all three of my Lagunitas L'il Sumpin' Sumpin' drafts and a taste of a friend's very bright and hoppy Imperial IPA selection.I opted for the mussels in vindaloo broth and the fish and chips, both of which I had heard so many good things about. The mussels were $11 and the fish and chips were $17 so I was definitely expecting good things. The mussels were quite tasty and the vindaloo was a nice touch (and wonderful to sop up with the crusty toast provided). They didn't exactly blow my mind, but my idea of perfect mussels comes accompanied with lots of butter and either a white wine or belgian ale broth. I love Indian flavors so I had no problem finishing them.The fish and chips arrived with three chunky filets served inside a paper cone surrounded by a page of the Irish American News (nice touch!) and over a bed of tasty, if not a bit unremarkable chips/fries. The fish filets were perfectly moist and flaky, almost falling apart in perfect sections on my fork. The batter was a perfect balance of ""enough there to know it, but not so much that the fish was in any way overshadowed"". The tartar sauce was amazing and I could have gone through twice as much of that. The curry served with the chips had a wonderful light flavor, but was too runny and slid off the chips as they were dipped. I was yearning for the thicker onion-laden sauce served at our favorite Irish pubs in town.Others at our table enjoyed the prime burger (both said 'good', but no raves), the scallop dish (very good, but gone in a heartbeat at 3-4 pieces), the pork chop special (high marks from the diner and one of the best-looking chops I've ever seen). One diner also had the bacon-laden brussels sprouts side which I tried a bite of and enjoyed quite a lot.As I said above, service was very attentive. Nice touches like premium glassware, salt and pepper grinders and upscale cutlery gave this a high-end feel in a still very laid back environment.As we were finishing up, the proprietor, Billy Lawless stopped by our table and asked us about our meal. My wife and I had known him back when he was running The Grafton in Lincoln Square so it was nice to see him again.Again, overall a nice evening. The menu has selections that are approachable to most anyone with everything from a burger or fish and chips all the way to more daring selections like bison tartare and saddle of elk. The prices are indeed steep and more in-line with those you'd expect at a more formal ""special occasion"" place, but with the perfect location across from Millennium Park and near hotels and theaters, they'll keep packing them in regardless. Me, I'm going to try them for lunch at the bar next time. I bet that's going to be a little more to my liking."
"Cocktails are great! Food is so so! Atmosphere is the Winner!Spent the night out with the family, 11 of us and my 10 month old niece, we enjoyed a trip round the river looking at the great Chicago architecture. Then off to the Gage where after being seated and ordering drinks, a makers mark Manhattan for me which was perfect. We perused the menu which can be a little confusing, it's laid out in courses though the first course is a ""snacks"" course meant to be ordered with drinks, the second course is the appetizer course and the third course is a salad course; with the fourth as the entree course. My family is quite traditional when it comes to their tastes, so to no surprise the table was littered with Burgers and Fish and chips. I tried everything and thought the burgers were flavorless, as if they took the ground beef, pan fried it and served as is. The fish and chips were nice and flaky and the fires were perfect.We also tried the brie fondue which was forgettable and the mussels weren't anything special. Hits of the evening include the Caramelized Lobster which tasted absolutely decadent, Sweet and savory in a Lemon Quinoa. So yummy I could eat three orders and be happy! Also the Braised Rabbit Salad with crisp rice, spicy robiola lettuce and a very light Horseradish vinaigrette. The rabbit was cooked perfectly and the flavors were exceptional. This was a waitress recommended dish and she also recommended the Elk which I regretfully didn't get. Also tried the Duo of Sausages, the lamb and garlic was quite yummy, Baked Door County Whitefish, Roasted Amish Chicken which was very similar to other peasant style chicken dishes I've had, Duck Rillettes and Smoked Haddock Cake and all were tasty.  The restaurant is gorgeous! The green brick length tiled and black trimmed walls are stunning as well as the restroom and the downstairs cocktail room would be perfect for any party. Although our server was very good a server from a neighboring table insisted on talking to my sister while my niece slept on her shoulder. This conversation about his own child ended up waking up my niece which was inevitable since he was talking right into my nieces face. RUDE! But all in all the place is worth checking out,"
"You're going to see the same raves on my review too! I'm going to gush over the scotch egg, mashed potatoes, and their 3-sausage platter. You can always ask for a little more of their mustard seed sauce on the side if you love it as much as i do. I love the scene here - really cute guys! its a great bar scene for the after-work crowd on during the week. And its a great place to hit up on the weekends if you're going to the Art Institute or Ice Skating nearby.  I've not yet had a bad experience with service here, but the people seem so laid-back and willing to please, that if you did bring something up to management, they would be willing to remedy the situation."
"Brunch at the Gage was pretty darn close to perfect.  I expected this to become a tourist trap, since it had such fab views of the park.  Instead I felt like it was almost cozy.Great service and very good food.  I don't know if I would make this a destination, per se, but I would definitely suggest it if I am in the area or have some out of town guests.Solid four stars.  I will be back!"
Oddly enough I was her twice this week and enjoyed my time.  The atmosphere is nice and the waitstaff is fairly attentive.  They do have a wide array of specialty beers at premium prices but at least the selection was good.  I had fish and chips which were good although nothing outstanding.  My dining companion had a french toast which was also good although I think mine is better.  I would probably go back if I was in the area for a drink with friends or for some networking.  Maybe some of their more exotic dishes are better- I saw some elk and venison dishes.
"I really liked the dinner I had at The Gage recently. Very clean and smart looking bar/restaurant with very friendly and efficient staff.I had the Haddock and crab cake which was very good while my gf had their special autumn butternut squash soup with duck sausage. The soup was tasty but the duck sausage really helped it have a better flavour.The fish and chips taste great and I would say are the best in Chicago that I have eaten. The locally crafted sausages were also very good and it shows that the head chef here does put time and effort into what items go onto his menu. The server (I think his name was Jason) was exceptional. A really smart professional that always had refills of drinks before you had to ask, great wine suggestions, and was attentive at all times even though the restaurant was full and he was clearly busy. He was a person who takes pride in his work and after my experiences in Market and District bars it was a welcome change.I can't help but feel that having items on your menu like ""saddle of Elk"" and ""Bison tartare"" are there more to show that the Gage is not like eveyone else as opposed to them being great menu items. However, this is a small criticism on a very good evening with good food and great service."
"The Gage was ""Excellent"". Got a decent table, it was a little cramped but the service and food made up for it. The French Toast for brunch was delicious, and the presentation was great. Service was quick for a Sunday brunch crowd which I was very impressed with. Will definitely go back"
"I like this place a lot....in fact, I have to admit I'm sort of hooked on their burgers.  The inside is an upscale pub environment, it's right across the street from Millennium Park so you can't miss it.  The service is always good and so is the food.  Typically it's packed with the after work crowd getting a drink.I highly recommend trying this restaurant out...."
"I don't even know how to review The Gage. I usually go with my sister and my friend, who have become Gage regulars. The funny thing is, while this usually leads to good conversation and a round of drinks, I'd love The Gage even if I wasn't with regulars. The staff is the best staff I've ever encountered - our servers always act like our BFFs, even when we don't know them, the bus boys engage in conversation rather than just take away empty glasses, and the hostess actually found me in the back of the bar during Lollapalooza weekend when I'd put my name in for a table and there was a 45 minute wait because it was packed. The prices are what you'd expect for a decent restaurant on Michigan Avenue ($14 for a Grey Goose dirty martini, $9 for a Romaine Salad). I know I'll be back many, many times."
"I have been here several times for lunch. I can honestly say that this establishment has it together. The food is quite good. I have had, The Regular Burger, The Gage Burger, and the Salmon (which is a frequent daily special). All dishes were prepared really well. Even the fries are delicious. It may take a little while to get your food (especially if its crowded). Don't freak out though. I only have an hour for lunch and I always make good time. The only ""problem"" that I have with this place is the noise level. But what are you gonna do right? However, if you think you're going to escape the noise by eating in the little patio area out front, you're wrong. ESPECIALLY during the summer. Not only are there nonstop buses coming by, but there are a ton of people walking past (its tourist season after all). If you're into that, by all means sit there. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and grab a table inside. This place isn't over the top ""oh my gosh I have to eat here everyday"". But if you want good service, in a clean but not too stuffy environment, and typical American food (less a ton of grease), I highly recommend The Gage.P.S.-If you decide to go here during the week for happy hour, expect a crowd."
We've been back here 3X for dinner and lunch. The food is excellent. The service very professional and attentive. We have The Gage at the top of our downtown favorites list.
"I don't feel like I can give a totally valid review of The Gage because I was only there for their Restaurant Week menu... Which I thought would be like a taste of their regular menu... But, it wasn't; so, that was a disappointment.  The food we ordered however, was not a disappointment.  We decided to go for a bit extra and ordered a ""fondue"" that was made with brie (and...??) and served with long pieces of toast.  It was delicious, and this is more what I expected from The Gage... But, it was on their menu. The Restaurant Week menu included a black lentil soup and an ""organic lettuces"" salad.  I really wanted the black lentil soup, but it came with lobster... and Joe wouldn't let me have it because I'm allergic (same story every time!)..  But, we came to find out that it was only a scant bit of lobster anyway.  But, I was very happy with the salad.  Our main courses were also pretty delicious - the only gastro-y part of it though might have been the fried kale that came with my flat iron steak... Dessert was ok. The Gage is fairly expensive, so Joe and I probably won't go back until it's a special occasion, or if I end up there with some Overture Council people, but I'm sure it's good."
"Great atmosphere and vibe! classy place, but not too stuffy. wait staff was nice and food was great."
"My wife and I shared three dishes which were all superb. We stared off with the fried pickles. These were breaded and served temperature hot. The pickles retained their snap and flavor. Next we shared the scallops dish, which came with barbecue short ribs and vegetables. The scallops were huge and cooked perfectly. It was a nice surf and turf type dish. Finally, we had the Mussels Vindaloo. The dish was plentiful and made for sharing. The mussels were the plumpness I have ever had. The vindaloo sauce was spicy and flavorful. The dish is served with toasted bread to help sop up the sauce. There was still plenty of sauce left after we finished the mussels, so we asked for more bread to finish off the sauce. We washed it down with local craft beers. It was a noisy spot, particularly because March Madness was going on. I highly recommend this place for those looking for a high energy pub with great food."
I've eaten here at least a half a dozen times. Every lunch and/or dinner was awesome. Great service and great food.  Love their beer selection. Great place to have lunch after a visit to the Chicago Art Institute.
"We loved The Gage. We found it rather late in a 2 months trip to Chicago visiting family. We had 2 young children with us. The food was outstanding as well as the service. The menu selections allowed for a wide variety of tastes and moods. During our trip we tried to dine at as many new place (to us) as we could find. For breakfast, The Gage and Little Goat were our favorites. Highly recommend you try it.  We will return on our next trip."
"I'm gonna make this really simple. This restaurant is great! We had as our first course poutine and a scotch egg. Both were extremely delicious. The *only* thing wrong with either of these dishes was that there was too much poutine. I could have *easily* eaten the whole dish, but then I wouldn't have had room for course two.Speaking of which, we both had the Romaine salad for our second course. Wow, for a salad of just romaine lettuce, croutons, parmesan and a couple of anchovies, it was awesome! Seriously, there was just the right amount of dressing and cheese. It was great. I could have eaten two of these.Next up were our entrees. I had the tuna, he had the locally crafted sausages. The tuna was melt in my mouth yummy, but really could have used something...I don't know what, but it just needed a little something else. Maybe I'm used to sushi-grade tuna with spicy mayo and rice, but this just could have used ""something"". Don't get me wrong I ate every bite of it, it was still really good! My fiance's sausages were delicious. I had a bite of one and it might have been a spicy chicken? Service was lacking there, i.e. the menu and/or the waiter could have explained what type of sausages they were. One looked like kielbasa? One may have been chicken? The third, um, not sure. We decided to have dessert (it was Valentine's day after all!) and the french toast dessert with espresso gelato was awesome! Great location with easy parking at Millenium Park Garage and it's easy to get to via the el too! The place has a nice atmosphere, not too loud and the tables aren't too close together. I love the subway tile used everywhere! We'll be back to try the burgers and more of the good beers, too!"
"good dining option for this location.  Food not wonderful, but good.  Way too noisy.  I've been here several times and always have to raise my voice to talk to the person next to me."
I had a very nice experience the waiter (Steve) was very knowledge and had some relevant recommendation per our interests. The scottish Egg was something tasty and fun to try thanks to his expert communication skills. Service was top notch from the host to others just making sure everything was fine. We had the regular burger and it was solid
Here's the deal.I came for the Guinness on St. Patrick's Day- and I am happy I did. It was a jolly good time with all me lads. It was packed- but in a good way. There was live Irish music going while I was sipping my perfectly poured pint.I can't wait to come back for the food. It looked phenomenal. You've just been yelped in.
"Lunch at The Gage? How fancy!!The Irish flexing their culinary skills in a 3 million dollar gastropub = great success.  For those of you not in-the-know, a gastropub is basically food that you would find in some divey murky pub in the backroads of Ireland, but classier ingredients are used and the food is presented as upscale. [It's where rich people go to eat expensive comfort food, basically] You don't need to be dressed up to be a patron of this fine establishment, but you'll feel more awesome, so throw on a suit or some heels. Most of the people in here during the lunch hours are business men drinking martinis and beer - or the real housewife variety... or college kids like myself, being taken on a hot lunch ""date"" by their rich uncle. HANDS DOWN the best fish & chips you will ever eat out of a roll of newsprint this side of the Atlantic. Fantastic burgers and interesting takes on classic sandwiches [I had the olive oil poached hawaiian tuna sandwich... I was thinking tuna-steak, not tuna salad... but it was lovely. yes, lovely]. ++'s = they have scotch eggs. SCOTCH EGGS. I dare you to find a fancy restaurant with a Scotch Egg. If you're reading this review and you often visit fancy restaurants, you probably don't know what that even is! They have curry chips [fries]... traditional Irish street food.--'s = For my sandwich being 16 dollars, I wish they had done something a little more interesting. High quality ingredients, yes, but not huge on flavor. fun facts : the bar was built in Ireland and shipped overseas by the owner, who's son now runs the bar. Billy Jr will be the one walking around asking about the food... he likes to make the rounds and make sure that everything is quality. So overall, it's a fun place to spend some money on food so delicious you'd have to travel to Ireland to get it. Full Bar, cute Irish waiters and relaxed atmosphere."
"I've been here twice now, once for drinks and appetizers after hitting the museum, and more recently for brunch. Bottomline: Surprised, in a good way. I have been passing this place, writing it off as another mag mile tourist hole. While the crowd is expectedly a mix of locals, tourists, and the hotel business circuit it held its own personality (read: not Bennigans). The beer and cocktail menu is great. One of the managers (owners) stopped by and chatted briefly without shilling his own place and  commented that they try to keep the draft list interesting with lots of small or local infusion to the mix.Specifically for brunch, I was shocked to get a reservation on a Sunday morning, given how crowded it was in the afternoon last I had been there. It was pretty empty at 10:30ish, but slowly added people towards noon. So, little worries on getting a seat if you're running into long waits at Yolk a bit further South on Michigan. I had the Buckwheat Waffles + Ricotta Cheese. Oh, and a side of Irish Bacon. Simple, very good, but quite cheesy. Large portion for what you're paying. Had a Bloody Caesar which was not so great. I've been hooked on these for a long time, and while the Gage gets bonus points for bumping up the horseradish, the overall drink was thin and watery. Too much lime juice, too little tomato. Another place that makes my new 'safe' list for when you need something consistently good without blowing the doors off the hinges."
"The first thing I noticed as the revolving door deposited me inside the GAGE was the noise level and how it seemed to envelope me in side a blanket sound, and it was that exact moment that the idea I had for a romantic dinner for two was completely lost with in it. Not saying that the Gage is a bad place to be. Quite the contrary. My only real problem I had as I entered was that I was actually an hour early for my reservation, and even though I told the girl at the front of house when I checked in that I was willing to wait, since it was my fault -I hadn't expected the Art Institute to dump us out into the street exactly at 8pm, so I made my res. for 9- she was kind even enough to seat us right away. We were shown a table near the bar and what seemed to be the center of the action, I was almost hoping as we were sat and going over our menus was that if maybe we could of waited and got closer to our actual reservation time that, maybe, we could have been seated near the back where it might have been a little quieter. But what the hell, we were seated, and on a night that was looking rather busy.The menu, unfortuneatly, is a little big and slightly confusing even though it's only made up of one page. The meals were laid out in different courses and you almost got the feeling that you have to order from each course. And with their prices could be very costly indeed, and the drink menu, while smaller in size compared to the entrees, was like reading a phone book of alcohol. Not that's a bad thing, but as soon as we were sat it seemed that our waiter, whose name was Kevin (I had thought he said Brian, while my with thought he told us something completely different, that's how loud it was. But I digress) was table side. My wife and I are usually big wine drinkers, and the Gage has a most impressive list (with prices ranging from $16 to over $400), but we opted for beer instead this evening (a list that was also impressive with everything from the usual domestic and imports to a slew of micro-brews, which we went with. The Chambay to be precise).We ordered appetizers, my wife went with the Scotch Egg (how can you go wrong with a large hard boiled egg coated in ground pork and deep fried in a batter served with course mustard?), I went with the Hot Pouched Shrimp. We shared and I found both plates to be stellar. For our main courses we went with the Fish and Chips (wife) and the 16oz Rib Eye (myself), which I ordered  medium rare and to my delight was made perfectly. It's sometimes hard to get a steak that's till red and juicy in the center. I was hoping that both entrees would live up to the bar set by the appetizers and they far exceeded my expectations in excellence.Kevin brought over the dessert menu, and while everything on the front looked like it would amazing we decided to try a dessert wine from the other side. We settled on a 10 year old brandy that was so smooth that it was like drinking liquid silk.I found the Gage to an incredible dinning experience and can't wait to go back with friends this time around. Nicely situated across from Millennium Park and a half block away from the Art Institute, so if you're in that area I highly suggest that you stop in for at least an appetizer and a nice bottle of wine.(Side note: make sure you eat as much as you can of your order for the Gage does not have take out bags or doggie bags, and be prepared to spend some money if you are doing dinner. For the just the two of us we spent about $200 including tip.)"
"The Food and service at Gage were outstanding! The fish and chips were magnificent and so was the Vindaloo Mussels- yummy! We also tried the homemade sausage, which did not disappoint. Bloody Mary's are nice and spicy. Marked by a full house when we arrived, we knew we came to the right place. Overall, a fantastic find in Chicago!"
"The last stop on the Restaurant Week 2010 tour was a last-minute decision to stop at the Gage on our way back from Michigan.  The mrs. had checked them out on Tuesday and was impressed, so I figured what the hell.  She said they had fine pork, and that's enough to make me stop the car.Very efficient front of house service.  We were seated quickly and without any issues.  Very pleasant staff and a relaxed vibe in the place.  Throughout the meal the waiter kept our drinks refilled and checked in on us at appropriate intervals.For first course we both went with the Black Bean soup.  It was good, not great.  I don't know if it was due to being the last day of RW or what, but I didn't really find much if any of the duck confit mentioned on the menu in the soup.  But the soup was good enough that I wasn't particularly upset.For second course I went with the Grilled Duroc Pork Chop and she had the Baked Semolina Dumpling.  These were both very good.  The pork was tender, flavorful, with the sauce giving it just a little extra boost on the bottom end.  Her dumpling with the fontina and and nutmeg filling was light yet significant.  For dessert we had the cheesecake stuffed donuts with coffee anglaise.  A fun dessert, not too heavy so that you want to go and fall asleep right in the middle of the Millennium Park ice rink, but filling enough so you don't feel like you have just eaten a big bowl of air.  Obviously it is hard to gauge a place based on something like this unless there are either notable highs or lows in the experience.  Whereas this was just good.  I would definitely be interested in coming back here in the future when downtown, and the brunch selections seemed interesting.  Definitely worth popping into if you're back from admiring The Bean."
"My husband and I go here whenever we are in the area.  They have a great selection of beers on tap, and the wine list is fantastic.   We usually order the scottish egg to start, and sometimes the oysters, which are always fabulous!   The entrees are always delicious and the service is just short of perfect.  I love the atmosphere-clean, with dark wood, ceramic tiles, soft lighting."
"Great menu!  Great Staff!  the poutine, fantastic!   This place is pefecrt for almost all occasions.  This is truly as good as it gets."
"I had to review because I liked the Scotch egg and the mussels Vindaloo so much.  For apps my group and I ordered the chips (fries) with curry gravy and the aforementioned Scotch egg.  If you are ignorant of what qualifies as a Scotch egg then try beloved wikipedia provided here: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc…   The egg came with a side of some of the best coarse mustard I have ever tasted.  The curry gravy was quite thin and a good accompaniment to the nearly perfectly crispy-not-too-thin chips.I devoured my enormous bowl of mussels.  They were presented in a bowl full of a vindaloo sauce; which was very Indian tasting (curry again, perhaps) and an elongated slice of salamander toasted (french?) bread.  It was superb.  The sauce could be slightly too strong for some , but it was spot on for me.  I ordered a side of fire roasted mushrooms, which were the 2nd best mushrooms I have ever had-the first being at Arco de Cuchilleros tapas ristorante.  I also tasted some of the pesto goat cheese risotto, which was extremely rich.  Possibly the richest risotto I have ever had.I had some of the hangar steak, which was ordered too done for my liking to begin with.  However, it was served with some pickled veg of some sort and was quite good.I imbibed a Goose Island Matilda, and was far too full to even consider ordering another brew. The bill for everything was $87ish dollars.  Which was relatively reasonable.    I have read some complaints about the pretentious atmosphere/patrons/servers, but I did not perceive anything to be as such.  Perhaps if you are looking for something to come across as pretentious then it will.  I will go here for the $13.00 mussels and a beer again, soon, very soon."
"This place is pricey, but so close to work so I had to venture out for a few cocktails. The Gage is HOPPING for happy hour, so come early should you desire a seat. The service is always friendly and polite and the crowd is lively and fun! I will be coming back for Happy Hour"
"Loved this place!  Great atmosphere, amazing waitstaff and very unique menu.My husband loved the venison burger and my daughter enjoyed her chicken dish very muchI am a vegetarian and while I love eating out, I pretty much know I'm going to have a pasta dish or salad when we go out.  The Gage offered two great vegetarian choices, and I ended up with a very interesting cabbage roll along side an interesting fennel sauce. I know this is not a mainstream choice, but I really appreciated having such a different dish offered!  I didn't eat a lot of the cabbage (it was very good, but i was getting full after appetizers and a salad plus we had ordered their huge bowl of fries for the table.) Another waitperson (other than our fantastic waitress) came over to make sure that I was enjoying my meal since he had noticed I wasn't eating all of the cabbage.  That's an amazingly attentive staff!Dessert was great too, chocolate pot de creme with cinnamon ice cream for my daughter who loved it, and the kumquat sorbet for me which was fabulous.  We will be back soon, thanks for a great dinner!"
"This review begins a new era: The one when Matt L. attempts to not write reviews that either get flagged or personally offend anyone. God damnit, this era sucks, I can tell already. So The Gage... it was pricey, with bang up friendly service, but mixed execution on the food. It deserves a 3.5 for a creative menu.Poutine: This was the first poutine I ever tried. I'd get it again here or elsewhere. The Gage's had little bits of elk meat in the gravy, consistent with the rest of the menu's exotic offerings (antelope tartar, saddle of elk, fried bald eagle, braised baby seal, tuna net dolphin carpaccio, etc.)Mussels (in vindaloo sauce): Not bad. Not amazing. Sorry, that's all I got. Scallops: Served with something else that gave them an interesting smoky flavor. I only had a bit of one, but I'm not sure I could eat a whole lot of this dish. The smokiness was a tad overpowering. Risotto of the day: Since I've become a bit of a risotto slut in recent months, I had to ask our server about this dish. Turns out it was broccoli rabe, salsify, and radish. It sounded a bit bitter, but the server assured me it wasn't. He was right, but I'm still not sure it was a proper vegetable pairing for risotto. The plating of the dish was abysmal though, which kind of troubled me. Granted there aren't too many ways to put damp rice on a dish, but this looked like the lunch lady in the cafeteria with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth slopped a bunch of mystery food on a plate and passed it over the counter to me. There was no garnish (outside of the radish which I believe was left raw), nor any grated parmesan offered. Coffee and Doughnuts dessert: Again, a rather original idea that could have been better. Small dark chocolate profiteroles arrived in a dish. The waiter poured the ""coffee"" on top of them tableside. The coffee was a creamy, sweet, coffee-flavored sauce. It sounded excellent, but fell a little short in the flavor department. I also had a cup of real coffee, which was magnificent. I had to ask the waiter what they were brewing. Turns out it was Julius Meinl. Damn you Julius! Why won't you open up a shop in Ukie, you selfish bastard???In conclusion, I'd come back to try some more of the fun meats offered at The Gage, but it's a little pricey, so I'll probably wait until my Enron stock bounces back."
"4.5 stars!HUGE portions. Reasonably priced. De-freaking-licious. What more could you ask for?I got the fish and chips here - they were very very well prepared with the tastiest dipping sauce on the side. I came here to meet a college friend for lunch and we were certainly not disappointed. She got a sandwich which she said was pretty good but I was definitely blown away by the fish and chips!The location is also extremely convenient as a meeting spot since it is right across the street from Millennium Park. I used to think it was pretty hard to find something to eat at a reasonable price right by that wonderful little tourist trap but now I worry no more!The only thing was that it's very crowded and a little loud, but hey what the heck. :)"
"Love The Gage! We came here for my birthday dinner before seeing Billy Elliot. We had a 5:15 reservation and the bar was already packed when we got there. They took us to our table and the server was very helpful. I like that they have everything from a basic burger to some fancy specials. We had a few fun appetizers... one were pickles and olives. Another was a slice of bread layed with sauteed mushrooms and topped with a duck egg. That was was amazing! It was Chicago Chef Week when we were there so two of us had the prix fixed menu. Two had burgers, and one other had fish and chips. All of our food was great. One thing was better the other.Another fun thing was that they had some type of Italian Surprise wine. I can't remember what they really call it, but  often they feature a different type of Italian White wine which is what makes it a surprise. The one they had when I was there was really great.I can't wait to go back. In fact I'm hoping my next catchup lunch with the girls can be here. I look forward to trying the lunch menu."
"For some reason I thought I've already written a review for this place, but after some searching, figured out I didn't. Thus this review is much over due. My bf decided to take me out for a day on the town and to start he wanted me to try The Gage. It was pretty easy to get to as it's right on MI and not too far from the Red Line stop.I really didn't know what to expect as it's an ""Irish Pub."" This place definitely isn't like a ""typical"" Irish Pub. I must say I was pleasantly surprised! We didn't have a reservation, but got a table right away, although it was 1:30PM on a Saturday... The place was pretty packed and it seemed like every table as filled. Let's get to the best part.. THE FOOD. Even though it was already 1:30 in the afternoon, I decided to order off their brunch menu. I got the eggs benedict w/ rasher (Irish bacon). WOW!!! It was probably one of the best eggs benedicts I've ever had. It was overly salty and the eggs were cooked to perfect - not over done at all! The potato hash that it was served with was also cooked very nicely. I normally don't finish my entire plate, but I was ready to lick this one clean! My bf got got the famous Fish & Chips. The waiter also mentioned that their version of the Fish & Chips was voted the best in the city. I was a bit skeptical when she mentioned that, but when I took a bite I could see why it was voted ""Best Fish & Chips"" in the city! If you have been to restaurant before and didn't try the Fish & Chips, go back to get one! You are missing out! The prices were decent as well since they are on Michigan Ave after all. I thought $12 for Eggs Benedict was very reasonable for a fantastic restaurant located on MI Ave. We also ordered the desert. I can't tell you exactly what it was so needless to say I wasn't very impressed. I think I would skip the desert next time and order more drinks! :) I can't wait for the next time I go back to this restaurant and taste their delicious food! This should definitely be high on your list if you haven't tried it yet!"
"I've been here three times, and each time for dinner - never lunch like the rest of 'em (pbbbbt).Staff is excellent.  Knowledgeable, courteous and prompt.  My servers, for the most part seemed to know to leave me alone and let me and my company enjoy dinner.The first time I went with a friend and had the elk, I think?  I remember it being fantastic, but I couldn't tell you in what way.  We had so much food and it kept on coming, so I couldn't really remember anything but, ""good"" or ""kickass.""This last time, I took a special lady friend there for our first ""date.""  (I totally had this chick at ""hello"" by the way, so it wouldn't have mattered if I took her to Al's Beef either).  She loved it.  We shared appetizers in a tucked booth.The booths are great, isolated away from the bar crowd and noise, enabling me and my companion to get to know each other without interruption.  We had the mussels which were done perfect in whatever tomato-based broth they do it in.  The crostini or toast that they serve is crack on dough and they just keep bringing it to you with each dish!  Get away!  No, don't.The rabbit salad - fantastic and light.  My date is a big fan of cheese, so we ordered the fondue which was outstanding.  Very hearty for a first course, and WAY better than Little Caeser's Cheesy Bread.After that, it was just me and her, snacking and talking for a while, with no rush on the restaurant's part to get us out of there on a Friday night.  Even with her extreme PDA (I'm irresistible at this point in the date), we were comfortable in our little booth world with no interruption or staring.They should be doing more business I think, but it's a touristy area - probably hard to get local Chicagos to really believe there's something over there.Fine by me.  I'll keep going back there especially if I don't have to wait on a Friday and enjoy a nice time with a beautiful young lady!"
"We had lunch here on a recommendation from the concierge at the JW Mariott, and what a great recommendation it was. I had  the ribeye sandwich which was well prepared and very tender. My wife had the eggs over homemade hash which she enjoyed immensely. We shared a bread/pastry basket with our friends and the banana bread and apple turnover was pretty darn good. Not bad for pub food. The decor was also trendy and fun sort of Iike a clean subway station but in a good way without the piss smell. I would definitely go back when I return to Chicago in 3 years."
"Convenient location, casual cozy bar and pretty nice beer/wine selection. Kind of pricey, $14/glass and a half.  There was a really good dogfishead chicory stout that was totally delicious and strong on draft.One major booboo - they served their whiskey in a wine glass with ice...waatttttt?????Only one person ordered something to eat; the salad looked pretty weak but it was like 10 pm on a Monday evening...I did appreciate that 7 of us were able to sit together by squishing three tables in the same area and no one cared/said anything."
"First off, I had the WORST first impression of this place. I almost walked out after the reception I was served from the hostesses. Isn't a hostess' job supposed to be 1) smile, 2) say hi, 3) and seat you? Yeah, I thought so. Apparently, not these 2 ladies. I made it past them and was seated with my boyfriend in the back. I'm pretty sure we were the youngest people in there and we're 30. It was chocked full of the usual Chicago summer tourists. Our server was extremely nice and was trying his hand at jokes. I forgot his name but he had forearm tattoos. We had the carmelized lobster, the duck breast, and the rib-eye and it was all very delicious. Since we split everything, all the dishes came out split as well. I thought that was a nice touch. Even the drinks were great. I'm pretty sure even though the food and server were great, I can't get past how rude and apathetic the hostesses were and won't be returning."
"Gage, is one of our favorite restaurants - we live one mile from this magnificent  restaurant and are delighted each time we dine there.  The food has never once disappointed us...we are fans."
We heard great things about The Gage from our concierge at the Hyatt. It was a short walk from the hotel. We walked in and was seated right away. The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant had a nice feel to it. The place was full and everyone seemed to be having a great time.  Everything started to go down hill from here. The wine list was lacking in real direction and was very limited.  The menu did have some unique items on it to choose from but nothing that screamed out at you. The wait staff offered ok service at best. They were very slow to clear the table and dishes piled up. The zucchini appetizers were the best dish of the night along with the lobster soup. I had the chef special of the night Salmon. It came out very dry and almost without any sauce to speak of. We had a sample of the desserts but the best one was the lemon brulee.  It was very tasty.Hopefully this was just a off night for them. I will give them another chance my next trip to Chicago.
"Another comfortable spot to meet friends after work for drinks, apps or dinner but with the energy one expects from the city at night.  Love both the food and drinks."
"Strong choice.The room is handsome and somewhat masculine, with an old-fashioned yet modern look to it.  Whatever that means.Service was fine.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and really friendly.   The menu is quite interesting.  They offer lots of things with antlers like elk and antelope and rhinoceros (ok, maybe not rhinoceros).   And the food is generally quite flavorful.  My boyfriend had the rabbit salad, the mussels, and a side of french fries.  The salad was VERY flavorful.  The mussels were fresh and abundant, with a sweet and slighly spicy vindaloo sauce.  A winner.  And the fries were delicious.  I had a special soup - oyster mushroom puree with duck confit and figs.  Real nice flavors.  And for my entree, I had roasted black cod with mustard spaetzle and brussels sprouts.  The dish had a pronounced mustard flavor, but it somehow worked.  Good flavors all around.  Nothing bland about anything we had.Prices are a tad high but not outrageous.  With two martinis (it was a hard day) and a (big) glass of wine, our dinner for two, with tip, was $150.  Without the booze it would have been closer to $100.In an area of the city not known for innovative restaurants, this place stands out."
"...but 4 starts for a stellar cheese plate. A few ladies and I celebrated a fellow Yelper's birthday here last night. I'd previously been to the Gage for drinks, so I was pretty jazzed to try the food. I hate to say I was underwhelmed, cheese plate aside (just wish our cheese portions were bigger!). I split the monkfish with one of the ladies, and the kitchen was kind enough to do the splitting for us. It certainly would have been a little awkward to handle that at the table. One other gripe I had was that our plates weren't quite warm, which is maybe why the sauce around the monkfish was a little on the cool side. Our side of crispy potatoes with brie was super-small, and skimpy on the brie. Boo. The dessert - a spiced apple semifreddo - was tasty, but some bites had a hint of onion to it. You know when you get a dozen bagels, and the everything bagel touches another bagel, leaving its ""essence"" on your non-everything bagel? Yeah, it was kinda like that. Drinks were topnotch; three of the ladies tried cocktails and later switched to one of the many unique beer offerings. Small selection of wines by the glass, but the Secret Italy selection I ordered was a palette-pleaser and paired well with the food. All that aside, the Gage was a great spot to celebrate a fab woman's birthday!"
"Fantastic food. I ordered the chicken w/ candied pear & goat cheese & my boyfriend ordered the gage supreme burger (I might be a little bit off on the name). We got the Brie cheese fondue & both thought it was pretty good. They have a wide variety of good beers & an incredibly knowledgable & pleasant wait staff. The food was great, the bill was pretty high for 2 ppl but i guess that is to be expected from any good restaurants right downtown on Michigan ave.. We probably will only go there for special occasions in the future bcs it is a little over priced"
"I had a lovely dinner at the Gage last summer. Oh sure I was wearing five inch heels and I tripped and rolled half way there - which worked up quite an appetite for yours truly... But as I remember it , it was a delicious dinner complete with marrow bones which for a former vegetarian oddly strikes me as FOOD FOR THE GODS. I don't know why I haven't gone there again other than its sidewalks are dangerous. OK that's not at all true. I don't know why, it just fell off the list. So a person I know came into town and suggested that we have dinner and pondering the equidistant between his hotel and my home, I thought the Gage would be a great choice. and it was, more or less....Good things are; * I did not trip on my way there. * My companion chose a romantic table in the back of the restaurant that was below freezing - which the Manager quickly corrected, bless you Manager * Smart sexy waiter who really, really knew the menu + and - and how to guide our choices - MUCH appreciated! * I had a delicious cocktail * The pork belly and squid appetizer was far too small but oh my so delicious * I had a spectacular glass of wine ( a Gamay Beaujolais and if i didn't spell that correctly too bad) * The Tuna dish was AMAZING Bad things are: * My companion chose a romantic table at The back of the restaurant errrr, not quite right * the scotch egg was old - well lets say it was dry and not good * I ordered the Saddle of Elk and would have preferred a Saddled Elk that I could ride into the sunset. I love Elk and this one was not the tender medium rare that I had requested. Oh no - it was a bloody cold hunk of flesh, seared and still making whatever noises Elk make. * Handsome sexy waiter lost interest in us as soon as our food came - sigh- I sure would have liked another glass of wine - because that's how I roll In conclusion. I gage The Gage to be good not great. Too Bad..."
"we were in town for 24 hours for the chicago marathon.  after my fiancee ran a personal record, we went back to our hotel to shower and change before making our afternoon flight.  we asked the concierge at the JW Marriott, what they recommended and they said well chicago is known for pizza and steaks.  we were not in the mood for either, so they suggested the gage.  WHAT A FABULOUS SUGGESTION!  even though it was marathon day, we were able to get in without a wait for 2 within our 10 minute walk from the hotel to the restaurant.  the hostesses were accommodating and sat us immediately.  we got TREMENDOUSLY lucky that we were seated in Megan's section.  she was a ridiculous waitress!we had no idea what we were in the mood for but 100% wanted to splurge and have a celebratory post-marathon meal.  we started with the  Gage N-17 ""Fondue - which was DELISH!!! I MEAN DELISH!!  i wanted to use my finger to wipe the pot clean...yum-o melted brie!!  how could you go wrong?!megan was super knowledgeable about beer choices.  i had a good bloody mary to start.  after doing some beer tastings, we decided on a Affligem and a beer from their seasonal libation menu that was comparable to an anchor steam.after our brie app, we had a ""The Gage"" USDA Prime Burger and a Roasted Woodland Mushrooms sandwich.had a great meal in chicago and truly a wonderful experience at the restaurant.  will highly recommend to friends traveling through."
"Scotch egg was decent, nothing to write home about.  Vension burger was a huge dissappointment.  It sounded incredible, but somehow it turned out to be dry and well overcooked."
"Lovely place... we had brunch/lunch here this weekend and it was ace! there were 8 of us and everyone loved it..The decor is lovely...very chic..The service was attentive, knowledgeable and personal and the food was amazing....will defo be back here soon!"
"I was in Chicago on business and found this restaurant on Yelp.  The reviews led me to it and I can say that even the best of reviews did not do this olace justice.  Never have I been to a restaurant where everything we tried was just as good if not better than the previous dish. My coworkers raved about how phenomenal their rabbit salad and venison dishes were. My mussels were amazing with a delightful yet not overpowering curry broth.  Dessert was an absolute treat, the Greek yogurt custard melted in your mouth and the honey on the baklava was fantastic.  And not only was the food amazing, but the service was absolutely grand.  Our waiter was knowledgable and polite.  The house manager was equally great.  I would recommend this place to anyone in Chicago and looking for a great overall dining experience."
"Went for lunch. completely over-indulged. we ordered the burger, the pork belly sandwich, and a salmon sandwich. all good, but rather greasy. I ordered a side of Mashed potatoes, not knowing that the sandwiches come with fries (doesn't say on the menu) but it would have been nice if the waitress would have mentioned this, especially after we ordered the confit fries. I totally get that we didn't order salads, but too greasy is just too greasy."
"Went here while in town for St. Patrick's Day weekend. Great location right by the parks. Nice atmosphere. More upscale, but still comfortable. Lunch options were delicious - I had the salmon sandwich. Draught beer selections were great - always a must in my book. Would definitely go back again."
"Fantastic.  I must have walked by this place a hundred times and never noticed it.  I'm glad a friend finally got me to try it.We were able to walk in on a Wednesday around 7pm with a group of five, but I don't think that would happen again.  Make a reservation.For appetizers had: Venison carpaccio (excellent), a scotch egg (amazing), mussels vindaloo (everyone loved them, I'm not big on mussels), rabbit salad (delicious).For my entree, I decided to try the Elk, and I was NOT disappointed.  Cooked a perfect medium rare, it was lean, juicy and tender.  I loved it.Mashed potatoes were quite a treat, although they could probably give you a heart attack.Oh, did I mention an excellent, reasonably priced, wine list?  The Gage is definitely one of my favorite places in Chicago now."
"Semolina dumplings with fiddleheads.  They are yummy in my tummy and probably the #1 reason why I will continue to return to The Gage.  Also, this is the place that taught me all about the deliciousness that is a perfectly roasted baby beet.The menu at the Gage changes throughout the season along with the selection at the local farmer's market.  Yes, this place is pricey, and it does attract a seriously yuppie after-work crowd.  But, for those who want to experience a well-prepared and flavorful meal paired with the perfect wine, then you should overlook the shoulder to shoulder crowd and make a reservation.I have come here with friends before and after concerts at the Symphony and Buddy Guys; have sat in the outdoor sidewalk area, the private party room in the back, as well as at a bar table on the edge of the bar area.  Each time, I have enjoyed myself, my conversations with the wait staff, bartenders, and sommeliers, and delighted in the food.Great date place for those willing to splurge a little.  The average price of dinner for two with a bottle of wine or a couple of cocktails per person comes to around $100.00 to $150.00"
"I wish I could rate the savory and sweet dishes separately, well, I guess I can:1 star - savory4 stars - sweetIt saddens me when good ingredients are underestimated, leaving the chef to cheat by adding fat to everything. Seeing that most items on the menu would contribute to a heart attack, I ordered two sides, winter squash and brussel sprouts. I was amazed at the amount of butter, bacon, cheese, and salt that were coating the mistreated vegetables. Gage needs to gain some confidence in its savory dishes and embrace fresh and healthy seasoning.Dessert wise, enjoy! What a surprise to find that this upscale Irish pub is hiding some of the best desserts in Chicago. Well done!jamieott.wordpress.com"
"POUTINE!I have found poutine in Chicago. This is important. I was born and raised in Canada, very close to the quebec border. 3 Years ago, upon my arrival in the USA, I realized a sad fact: the states lack poutine. Not any more. the gage make a wonderfully prepared, authentic, french-canadian poutine. It stands far above typical canadian ""fast food"" poutine, and would make a run for a contending position in the better quebec poutine eateries. Not to mention, their wait staff is  wonderful, the environment is comfortable and elegant, and their prime rib steak was wonderfully prepared. I will be heading back to this location within days."
"The Gage is awesome!Nice, clean and trendy! Love it, love it, love it!Went there for lunch the other day and in spite of having a small menu for lunch they accommodated a couple of option for vegetarians. I had a mushroom sandwich that was to die for!the service was good and the owner came by to see how we were doing. The guy is nice but don't expect him to pickup the bill for you! :-)Looking forward to go back for dinner and drinks!"
Roasted pork sandwich and poutin sour cherry crustini plus one of their many draft beers!
"A lot more upscale than I thought. Pretty expensive. RIGHT across Millenium Park (should've brought my ice skates w/me) !! Superb service. Got the ""chips""(fries) with curry gravy. A HUGE bowl of fries(couldn't finish it, I am weaksauce) with curry gravy. It was pretty okay, just wanted to try it. My friend liked it.The goat cheese risotto with basil puree and crisp esgarot?! Yummm.. SO rich that I almost couldn't finish. Comes in this cute little black pot. Basil puree + crisp escargot under the goat cheese risotto. My friend got the potato and semolina dumplings. Almost gnocchi-like, but not as chewy. My friend loved it, I thought it would've tasted better if it were chewier."
"Solid, a place that I just can't seem to quit (sorry, brokeback mountain fans). Have been here twice for dinners (once during February restaurant week and once in the summer) and more times than I can count for a drink at the bar. The food is always very inventive and it is great that there's an in-house sommelier who's willing to help- and not just trying to push the most expensive bottles. The last time I was there, the chef kept popping by asking how things were. This happened not once, not twice, but three times. It is good that he's attentive, but maybe not so good near the end of the meal when I could barely keep my head up with the two bottles of wine that I consumed. This is the kind of place that I can easily run into the ground, so will probably take a break before returning."
"I'm shocked at myself for not writing a review sooner considering that I've been a loyal patron to The Gage for over a year now.  The Gage is my Chicago,  I've recently moved back to NYC after a year-long stint in Chicago, it wasn't my city and quite frankly I wasn't a huge fan.  However, I truly do miss the Roasted Woodland Mushroom Sandwich on the lunch menu at this place.  It is a great vegetarian option (although I am not) because it's hardy and filling.  The staff is great, 9/10 times I sit and have lunch at the bar and I am always greeted by Kevin, James, Sarah, or Amy who are all rockstars (the bartenders).  I come for the food, and I stay for the company, these are some of the most genuine bartenders I've had the pleasure of meeting during my stay in Chicago.  If they don't know my name, which I'm sure they do, they at least recognize that a menu is not needed and put my order in upon sitting down.  I highly recommend The Gage to anyone and everyone!  The service is great.  The food is phenomenal.  The value is incredible.  I have flown to Chicago for only a few hours only to lunch here and see my favorite bartenders, and I intend on continuing my day trips when I have the chance, although it is definitely a pain in the ass to pick up and fly to Chicago on a whim, and although I'm secretly hoping they bring The Gage to NYC... I know it wouldn't be the same."
Gastropub done right.  Lobster and quinoa salad was incredible.  Excellent palm frites with dipping sauce.  Wide beer selection.   I dig it.
"I frequent The Gage on a weekly basis for lunch.  There are several fall-backs if you are not impressed with the daily specials.  I recommend the Fireside chicken sandwich, fish and chips or the curried mussels.  Desserts are ever-changing, but if you are there in the Fall - definitely go with the pumpkin pie ice cream sandwich!The staff is amazingly friendly and never appear to be ""at work""  If you enjoy beer, spirits, good food and great service, this is a must.  Lunchtime could get quite busy, i would recommend reservations, but seating is prompt if you do not have reservations.  The outside seating area is ornately decorated with beautiful flowers and shrubbery, but could be quite noisy, as it is located on Michigan Ave.A definite must for all who pass by!"
"Gage seems like its for the movers and shakers... dark decor.. business men... and the tourist....lots and lots of tourist. After assessing the joint our waitress comes to the table and proceeds to take our order. My pet peeve is when a waitress says...""well which one do you want"" instead of allowing the person to make up there mind. I know its the lunch rush but...Damn!!!! I ordered the Baked Potato Soup with Clams... it was YUMMY....but where was the potatoes and clams. I got all potluck no potato and clams...ok Oh wait two clams and five fingernail size pieces of potatoes... later...I am really kind of on the fence about this place. Maybe if I am in the area again I will give it another try."
"Yep, we had our Holiday lunch here again and it was very good this time as well.They have tweaked the menu just a bit ,but still have most of the old favorites.Service was great, as it has been the other times I have been here. Our server was very attentive and informative. Wish it had not been so very noisy so I could have heard his name.I had a glass of a very nice and crisp Savignion Blanc. I love their mini decanters-just a bit  off center and unique!I had the fish and chips(I know...I SHOULD have had a Guinness-but I am not an ale gal). The fish was Cod, nicely breaded and served in a newspaper cone, as was meant to be. Very good and a nice malt vinegar to compliment it just right!Had to get that French Toast dessert again, we shared that and the Coffee and Doughnuts dessert. I am still full,no need for dinner.I enjoy the food and service at The Gage.If you are in the area and looking for a casual ,but more upscale bite, drop in."
"Great fish and chips, good menu and they know how to pour a Guinness! I like this spot and would recommend to anyone in the area for lunch or dinner."
had roasted chicken and fried green tomatoes. both were tasty but the tomatoes were a lil too salty by bite three. good food!
"Went to this place for my 18th birthday and will be returning for my 21st because of the expansive, seasonal menu. This place is my first experience with a menu that changes with the seasons which is both a blessing and a curse (curse because I dont know when i will be able to get the salmon with latkas and capers again). The crowd is very trendy, the bar is huge and the regular items on the menu feature great American/Anglo-Saxon flavors such as their creative use of brie and their legendary fish and chips. This place is expensive, no joke. So if you're going to do the whole bar then aps then dinner thing, be prepared to spend over 70 a person, but like most things in this world, you get what you pay for."
As always excellent
Awesome gastropub with great scotch! I like the Oban 14 yr. Went here before seeing Book of Mormon and was a great start to the night. The scotch egg is a must.
"Great ambiance, great food, great staff, great, great, great!  They have a private room to rent out with a separate bar downstairs. Would be ideal for a family gathering or small intimate reception.  Just wish it wasn't so full of tourists in the summer months :("
"Nice little place with some character, tucked away in the midst of the tourist hell that is Michigan Ave.  Here are some points of interest.* old world art deco ambiance, without being old world falling apart* accommodating server had the kitchen prepare an heirloom tomato salad for wife just because she likes heirloom tomatoes (item was not on menu)* split the fish and chips, and the large portion came out on two perfectly sized plates without asking* potato soup was a bit salty (too much bacon), but flavorful* refills were a plenty and we never had to ask* a little spendy for lunch fare (though exotic), but typical of the area"
We love this place-- especially for a pre-theater date night.  The food is always good.  The front of the house is a nice combo of upscale bar and classy pub.  Staff service is mixed-- sometimes slow; sometimes very polished.  The atmosphere and the menu are worth it.
"Went here with a group of 8 on a Saturday night and they were able to accommodate us with very little advanced warning. The Gage is best described as an upscale gastro pub. Decent beer selection and a trendy cocktail menu accompany a menu that ranges from burgers to elk to steaks. I tried the pork chop and it was perfect at medium, nice and juicy. The mash potatoes are definitely a pass--certainly not worth the $4 for such a small portion of really average mash. Get the fries instead, they were delicious. The burgers all looked very good and at the price they're charging for they better be. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly and was able to handle our large party with no problems. The Gage may be a little expensive for what it is, but you are paying for that prime time Michigan Avenue real estate. I would definitely recommend The Gage for eaters in the downtown/touristy area, or as a spot for after work drinks with some coworkers."
"My last meal in Chicago.  Warning: the drinks are STRONG!! I got about halfway thru my martini before I switched to water. I ordered the burger, which was excellent. The thing that most stands out in my mind was the steak knife I was using; it had a really cool shape and a little castle embossed on the handle. Fortress brand? Where can I get one of these?"
"Brunched and watched the air show from the outdoor patio. The pat is where it's at, since the indoor area is pretty dark and uninviting. I had the shrimp bahn mi and a few Jameson Ginger Fizzes. Both were delightful. The bahn was served cold and the sauce had a nice bite to it. $13-ish, I think? The Jamies were $8. So not cheap eats but sometimes you just want to get your day drink on whilst hashing out relationship problems with your best dude friend at a hip, urban oasis. Check and mate."
"This place is so great. I've been here for work functions, social things, and have even hosted a party here in the downstairs bar. Never had a bad experience, and the food is excellent."
"The food here is very good pub food.  Their hamburger is one of the best I have tasted. So are their fish and chips.  Only problem is you cannot usually just drop in for lunch because it is very busy, and it is somewhat noisy if you want to hold a serious conversation."
"Pricey!Not a bad upscale gastropub with an enormous array of choices and exceptional service-- but unfortunately, the quality seemed to vary as much as the selection.  Great location across from Millenium Park, and although you can't tell from first impressions by the relatively small outside seating and bar area, the restaurant stretches waaaay inside and fits the middle ground where you could be comfortable either in casual or more dressy digs.I sampled the Smoked Haddock Cake and Peekytoe Crab, which was seriously good and had me excited for my next dish.  Unfortunately, the Fish & Chips majorly disappointed, being more batter and grease than actual fish.  Clearly not worth the $17 they're asking for it.I like the fact that you have the choice to eat on the reasonable side here, with options in the $10-20 range, but it seems like most of the good stuff is in the $30-40 end, so consider this fair warning.  Be ready to spend over $50-70 per person with drink and maybe dessert.  Worth it?  Not quite, in my opinion."
"I had the antelope tartare, speck salad, and carmelized lobster with quinoa because this is the sort of place in which to be adventurous.  The royal HE had a hamburger, chicken noodle soup, and  for his starter-pickles and olives.  HE wasn't too adventurous.Our server, Melissa, had the perfect waitpersonality...not snooty or perky or overly friendly or underly friendly.  We walked in at 4pm  on a Saturday and by the time we left it was packed."
"I went here for dinner and was not impressed.  It seems like they try to be too upscale, it turned me off.Maybe the lunch will be better.Good location and outdoor seating."
* I had the rocksolid $16 10-ounce Gage burger for dinner + 2 Stellas. The burger was loaded with onion marmalade and camembert cheese. Delicious! Comes with french fries and pickle. Go gaga!
"My opinion on The Gage is very much in line with the overarching positive reviews already listed. While it would not be in my ""Top 10 Restaurants in the U.S."", The Gage certainly lives up to the praise.  Located write across from Millennium Park, the restaurant has a comfortably formal vibe with big red booths and a nice long bar upfront. We started with the Hot Pouched Shrimp and The Gage Fondue. The shrimp might have been my least favorite thing I had. It wasn't bad but it didn't seem fresh and was a little too spicy for my liking. The Fondue on the other hand was amazing. Served with toasted French bread I found it hard to stop digging in! Definitely order this for a starter. For our main we had the Caramelized Lobster and the Fish and Chips. The Lobster was good and the Fish and Chips were AMAZING. If you've read other reviews you know that this is a ""famous"" dish here. For dessert we had the best Chocolate Carmel Pave I've ever had. It was amazing. At that point I was stuffed but managed to pair it all with a big glass of Pinot Noir. I'm looking forward to returning and trying some more items off of this fantastic menu!"
"My husband & I were in town for the Chicago marathon.  We decided to come here for some good food and drinks.  We got the mussels to start, which came in a dlicious curry broth.  My husband got the gage burger and I got the roasted chicken with quinoa.  It was probably one of our best meals the whole weekend!"
"This meal made my top 5 ever.  What more can I say?  The food and wine were so exquisite that we had the executive chef, Dirk, come out so we could personally thank him.  Not only did he come out, he sat at the table and had a few beers with us after the kitchen closed.  I can't say enough about this place.  AS far as suggestions - order anything and everything on the menu - it's all incredible."
"We went to the Gage for easter--thought i would have been more crowded but i seemed to be an avg day for any resturant on a sunday at 2:30...9 in our group--2 kids one 7yrs and one 2 1/2 yrs--no kids menu online--none given at the resturant--verbal of 3 things--mac n cheese, chickne fingers and something else that i didnt hear(noise level was loud in the resturant)--kids orderd mac n cheese--may i say this--OUTSTANDING--best mac n cheese--no box stuff here--the real deal cheese sauce--the whole table shared it--waitress said the portion was huge and 1 order would be eonoug for the 2 kids--the resturant split it for us--no need to ask for a seprate bowl--nice!2 of us odered starters--the frys with gravy(not the officail name of course)--have to say i wanted them to be better--they were ok--def only had one small serving before the taset grated on me..cheese fondu--huge HIT--everyone loved it--including my picky 7yr old--trust me this says ALOT--would love to have eaten the entire thing by myself and ot share :)--mmmmmm2 onion soups--looked good--smelld wonderfull--didnt get to taste, but they said it was great..i had the lamb stew--it was ehhh--ok--not the flavor i was expecting--it was flavorfull--kinda like a curry--tased ok, just not what i expected or wanted--nice portion though..a few had fish and chips--looked and tasted like your avg fish and chips(tasted hubbys) nothing special there..turkey saldad samich--huge! 3 people could have easily eaten this--even my SIL boyfriend said it was alot--he said it was very good--didnt taste it so i'll go by his word..pork shoulder samich--HUGE as well--SIL said it was awesome--looked good--wished i could have tased it--SIL was at the oppisite end of the table i was at...service was good--not great and NOT bad--a real ""good"" rating..why my 3 stars--i expected more out of the yelp 4 star--didnt cut the mustard for a 4 star..could have been just a tiny bit more welcoming to kids seeing s they are directly across from mileniumn park...i would go again--3 stars in my book means i would go again..."
"My favorite gastropub in the Millennium Park area. Great place to grab a drink or a bite to eat. The bar area is roomy in size, the dining room seating areas are classy"
"Great food, great cocktails, and a great location right by where I live - the Gage rocks!  Although many of the dishes are classic pub food, they are done to perfection - why have boring french fries when you could have chips with curry gravy?It is an ideal spot to have post-work drinks if you live or work in the Loop."
"Great food, expensive, and sometimes your table can get lost by the waiter. But probably one of the better restaurants within striking distance of the park."
"I've been here multiple times and each time I experience friendly, knowledgable service. In my experience, this has become a rarity in most dining establishments. I am not a seafood fan and I feel like a lot of their menu highlights seafood-based options, however, there are adequare alternatives that have all been satisfactory. It's a plesant environment - nothing fancy, but far better than your average bar n' grill."
"First of all, I think the price index for this place is wrong. You can easily eat here for less than $30. And lunch is way cheaper than that. Maybe my expectations for what ""pricey"" is are off. I'm not sure. Second, I might give Gage 3.5 if I could. I'm on the fence about that. I've been here twice now, both times for lunch. I think my second experience (which was today with my coworkers) was better than the first back in Feb 2008. Today I had the slow roasted beef brisket sandwich. The beef was very tender and kept falling off my fork. The sandwich is huge and open face, so you have to eat it with a knife and fork. The greens on top balanced out what I thought was possibly over kill on some of the other flavors. Here were the issues:1. You couldn't even taste the bread because it was so hidden under everything else. I think good bread makes a sandwich and adds texture. 2. The mustard, while good (I LOVE mustard) was overpowering and not evenly distributed, so every other bite I got a mouth full of it. 3. There was almost too much cheese (and I didn't think that was possible) but it and the mustard make the bread soggy. It was enjoyable for the most part, and I'm not terribly picky about food, but I'm trying to be more refined with my reviews, so that's my two cents. My boss got the Peppered hanger steak salad and it came with AWESOME presentation and look like it was a little more balanced than my pile of sandwich, so maybe I just picked the wrong thing. The two people who had the fish and chips said it was great. In my previous visit I had the Gage burger, and that was yummy as far as I remember, but suffered from some of the same textural/soggy bread issues as my sandwich did today. That said: OMG have dessert! We got a couple things and shared. The peanut butter beignets were amazing. I was skeptical of the blueberry jam and strawberry ice cream that came with, but it was all awesome together. The pound cake was also good and so is the gelato. The atmosphere, I really like. The green tiles on the walls are cool, and they have adequate space to accommodate large parties. The only thing was that even at lunch it was really loud in there. A busy dinner night may be deafening. The service was good this time around. We had a reservation and were dressed for work, and I honestly think that got us better service. When I was there with a younger friend on a Sunday afternoon I felt a little rushed and treated like I didn't know how to act in a restaurant. I'm hyper-sensitive about being treated like an adult because, duh, I am one. So yeah, it's a good lunch place. I like the way it looks and I would totally recommend it for drinks and dessert because the dessert was my favorite part!"
"The docent at the Art Institute recommended The Gage when we asked about nearby lunch places.  Her description was great and we decided to try it out.We were there mid-afternoon so the restaurant wasn't crowded.  The front area is bar-style eating and a bit noisier.  We sat in the dining area in the back and it was a lot quieter there.  The decor is really great...updated pub style.  The seating was comfortable, cozy, with good spacing between the tables.  Hubby ordered the hamburger.  It was a nice large burger on a delicious bun with crisp, fresh toppings.  Really a great burger.  I had the Fire Roasted Chicken sandwich.  YUM!!  It was a large grilled chicken breast with blue cheese and Frank's Red Hot sauce and basil on a cuban bun.  My only problem with the sandwich was that the basil was a bit tough.  No big deal...I took it off and the sandwich was absolutely delicious without it.  We both had the fries and they were quite good...golden, crispy, not limp or soggy, perfect seasoning.  The service was perfect...attentive but not intrusive.  We would definitely eat here again."
"Let's just say that I've been here twice in the past week.  Once for a dinner on Tue and the other for Lunch on Mon.  Both times I left happy and stuffed.  I've been prolly 4 times so far this year.  Everything is so good, its hard to hold back and not eat it all.Here is what I've had so far and recommend:Chips (Fries) Curry GravyMussels Vindaloo, Toast (ask for extra bread as the sauce is good enough you may be temped to drink it instead)Seared New Bedford Sea Scallops Sweet Potato, Vanilla, Chorizo Vinaigrette - good although I wish the chorizo was a bit thicker and less wafer thin as you couldn't taste it""The Gage"" USDA Prime Burger Local Camembert, Melted Onion Marmalade, Toasted Malt Roll - great burger, though a little hard.  Onions and cheese made the burger.Today's Fish and Chips Guinness Batter, Malt Tartar Sauce, Lemon - signature dish...so good.  I think I've had this 2/4 times I've been here.Potato Soup Smoked Bacon, Clams - very tastey...though I got it a while ago and cannot remember the particulars.Sandwich of the Day (a samo with pork and an awesome chese)Slow Roasted Beef Brisket Steiner Swiss, Melted Onion, Mustard, Brioche - best brisket samo I've had in a long time.  It also was huge!!S&JNov08S&PNov08"
"Since my first visit, I've been back once for dinner and once for lunch.Dinner is fantastic, but the Gage also has an excellent lunch menu.  I had the roasted woodland mushroom sandwich, which was absolutely delicious - it was a heaping portion of mushrooms, and I couldn't keep it all in the bun!  All of the sandwiches are served with fries, but you can substitute a delicious side salad (served with gorgonzola).  They are quite accommodating.Our service was a bit slow during lunch, but the manager and hostess were nice enough to come around to give us our refills and make sure we were okay for our party of 8.OH - and I met Dirk Flanigan at Gourmet Taste of Chicago, and he's awesome!  He told me how to make the brie crisp potatoes because I was raving about them!  I also suggested that he bring the Kona Kompachi back!  :)Now I just need to go back for brunch..."
"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, right across from Grant Park on Michigan.  Awesome gastro pub.  Classy, old Chicago speakeasy style.  Great service.  Awesome food and food choices.  Great beer and cocktail selection.  Try the house ""Gage"" drink, it's sweet, but delicious and strong.  The pork shoulder sandwich is aaaaaawesome!"
"Amazing experience.  I'm not one easily impressed, but loved everything about the place.  Great ambiance, great service, and amazing food.  First time I came in, it was rather late.  Server made us feel great even though I'm sure we did not look like the average clientele.   We came in dressed very casually and she took our order and had the drinks coming at a reasonable time.  Great view of the city from the outdoor patio.  Then the food came and we were in culinary heaven.  I ordered the Venison burger and forgot I was with friends.  The Gouda Cheese just melted in your mouth.  The chef put just the right amount of Jalapeno peppers, not too much too make it spicy, but enough that you can enjoy the tasted.  The burger itself, melted just right in your mouth.  Fries were great, but the real side to try is the mashed potatoes.  My friends took a bite and they enjoyed it more than their fries.  Add to the fact that they have a wide variety of imported beers outside of the usual and micro brew as well as an extensive wine list, it is definitely a place a beer or wine connoisseur will enjoy.  Stopped by lunch a couple weeks later and even though I just ordered a salad, it was still a great experience.  I assumed there would be a drop off due to it being lunch instead of dinner.  I was wrong.  I recommend this place to anybody who enjoys good food and does not mind shelling out a little money for it.  Try it for lunch, I'm sure you will come back for dinner."
"I have been to The Gage twice. My first experience was four star, and yesterday's was two. So I am averaging things out.The first time I went to The Gage was over a year ago. I had just helped my friend Mike pick out an engagement ring for his now wife, and after the fact he needed a strong drink. We wandered over to The Gage, having no idea what it was, and bellied up to the bar. It was a Tuesday or Wednesday night around 6:30 and the place was empty. The bartender was friendly, we took a bunch of shots of Jameson, and ordered some appetizers. I had the fondue, he had the infamous egg. The fondue was great--the egg scared me so I did not try it because I thought I would have a heart attack on the spot if I did. I noted that this was a place to definitely come back to for a low key happy hour. But after last night, I am thinking that our experience back last September was because the place was still new and perhaps a bit unknown...Last night (a Friday) two friends and I headed to The Gage, right at 5:00. We walked in and couldn't believe how crowded the place was. The bar area was packed, so much so that we had to slither through one at a time to get to the back area, which was slightly more clear. It took forever to get our drinks ($8 Absolut & sodas that seemed not to have a drop of alcohol in them). The bartender was the kind of asshole you expect at John Barleycorn--did not utter a word, looked at me like my drink order was annoying to him, and did not crack a smile or even make an attempt at making me feel as though I mattered. Last time I checked, YOU are the one serving ME...get off your high horse, dude.Eventually we were able to score a small bar table at the front of the room. Our waitress was nice enough but didn't say much. We commented to her on how weak the drinks were and she stated, ""I hear that a lot."" Hm. Long story short, we decided to leave because our table was directly in the path of the huge crowd at the bar and all of us kept getting knocked into. It was also so loud that we literally had to shout to hear each other.Usually I have a great time at crowded bars, but this particular crowd, coupled with the service and poor excuses for drinks guaranteed that I will not be going there on a Friday again."
"Chips (fries) Curry gravy. It's the thing you know. It's my new thing. I love it. Ever since visiting a fry stand in Portland, it's been my new obsession. I get it every time it's listed on a menu. Gotta have it. The Gage's rendition is pretty good. Then of course I love battered up food so I had to get the fish and chips. My second choice was the duck leg confit but the Guinness batter was calling my name.  The food here is comforting and tasty. Good lunch spot."
"A civilized pub experience for the suit and tie crowd.  Solid beer selection and an interesting menu wins points.  Other than drinks, we only tried the roasted beet starter, which was quite simply, lame.  Still, I'd look forward to returning  to try their other offerings, or at least for drinks as I did like the atmosphere very much."
I've eaten at The Gage several times and go in for drinks fairly often and always have a great experience.  They have a nice wine selection and wonderful cocktail and I love the poutine!  I've takeng friends from out of town and they've always enjoyed the food and drinks.
"Good beer selection.  I had the venison cheese burger...BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD!! The food here was amazing, portions were generous.  My only complaint is the place is a bit noisy (we sat in the back so it wasn't too bad)"
"I went to the Gage for lunch with some colleagues, and will definitely go back; especially when I can have a beer.When we went, they had the battered Tilapia as a sandwich special for lunch.  I was torn between that and a burger so a coworker and I split them.  Is it wrong?I could eat that battered tilapia sandwich every day for a year and not get tired of it.  It was exquisite.  The fish was light and the breading was perfect.  It was on pumpernickel and whatever they put with it just made it dance.The burger was great but not unlike anything I've had before.  The iced tea was great (a rarity) and the atrmosphere was likewise.  Very classy."
"I came here a while ago for a quick meal before a concert at Charter One. I remember liking the burger I had, but not being blown away by it. Recently my boyfriend and I went here for a meal during bourbon week. The cocktails we had were really good. Our waiter was extremely nice and helpful. He gave great recommendations and seemed to be really knowledgeable. We definitely had a nice time, but none of the food was that spectacular. It was all just OK."
"Went there the other night before a performance at the Symphony, while on a business trip. The place was PACKED, but we were lucky to find a small table in the bar section. The waitress was super friendly (and good looking dare I say), and very professional. We told her we were in a hurry because of the symphony (you can't be late), and she made it happen. We had gorgeous dishes (try to warm salad with duck confit, or the seared scallops), and good beer. Prices were also really affordable for the quality and ambiance. The place reminds me a lot of the great Parisian brasseries (Boffinger, Coupole etc..), albeit in a smaller scale. I would definitely come back next time I'm in Chicago."
We were here a few months ago to take in concerts at Symphony Hall and we sort of happened to walk by this place and made a dinner reservation.  We shared a seafood entree which was excellent and dessert.  We elected to sit at a table outside since the weather was pleasant. Our server was very helpful also.  The only complaint I have about this restaurant is that it's noisy inside.  I would like to try it again on another visit!
"Very good, but very expensive. The oyster appetizer is amazingly good, and the gage burger is equally good, as is the rest of the food, I assume."
Excellent food and a very good beer selection. Cool modern and very well managed with a great vibe.....A MUST go if in the Loop....
"The Gage was my second and last stop during this year's Restaurant Week. Branch 27, my first stop, was great and I was hoping to continue the streak here. I was at the Gage once before a few years ago. I had a variety of homemade sausages and a Scotch egg, and I remember enjoying it. This time, however, not so much.We made reservations for 7PM and got in with no problem. We sat more towards the back of the restaurant this time. This place is much longer than I thought it was. The first time we ate here, we sat in the front bar area, which is small, cramped and dark. This time we walked past the bar and into a devoted dining area that is much brighter and better laid out.We were seated and ordered some beers. The Gage has a pretty decent beer list, which is always nice. We were also given a few menus, but we were only interested in what they were offering for Restaurant Week. That menu was surpringly light on options--only 2 choices per course. We both ordered the lobster bisque for the first course. I wasn't a huge fan. It was very bitter. It did have a very prominent lobster flavor and there was a dab of shredded lobster in the bowl, but something wasn't quite right about it. For the entree, I ordered the hanger steak and my friend ordered the white fish. The steak was a surprisingly small portion and again the flavor was lacking. It seemed suprisingly dry for a medium-cooked piece of meat and overall it was very dull. The small splash of sauce and salty greens didn't add much either. For dessert we both had some sort of chocolate/peanut butter mousse that I enjoyed well enough.Overall, the Gage is a nice place, but the food just didn't measure up to everything else it had to offer--an incredibly disappointing realization."
"Okay.  For $33, the pork chop should knock your socks off.  Just didn't do it here.  Decent piece of meat, but seems like the chef tried too hard with the preparation and fell short, particularly for the price.  Brie potatoes just okay.  Caesar salad just okay.  So there, everything okay, just not great.  And seven dollars for a Guiness?"
"Cool, contemporary place right on Millennium Park and Michigan Avenue.  Plus, they pour a mean gin & tonic (which I guess isn't that hard to do).  Anyway, I really enjoy grabbing a table at the Gage for drinks after work. It's a great place to unwind.Also, the chips and curry gravy is crazy good.  I have to go back for a full meal sometime, but I'm a little worried that evenings/weekends will mean it's full of tourists."
"4 1/2 starsI wanted to save my 100th review for someplace special and this is it.The Gage.I can't help myself. I can't stop going to The Gage.Is it me, or is just getting better day after day? This place is more than a pub, the owners call it a gastropub and if you've read anything outside of yelp on this place you'll know that the chef is constantly working to create unique and delicious dishes, and not just in the name of science. The dishes are accessible and they taste amazing.Go luxe and start with the NC 17 Fondue or Goose Rillettes with whiskey cherries, don't pass on the peppered hanger steak ""salad"" and indulge in caramelized lobster. The tuna tartare just about the best I've ever had, and their ""local"" sausages are simply incredible. Their burger is one of Chicago's best, to be sure, but don't too quick to choose; consider the seasonal slow-roasted halibut with white asparagus and morels. Art, on a plate. For dessert I like to move back up the menu to the Second course and order the daily cheese selection.Please sir, may I have some more?The service is as detailed as the dishes. Waitstaff is überfriendly and efficient. The room is quite cool too, even being street level, which can be problem for some restaurants. Who wants to sit in traffic [don't answer; I know a lot of you love dining on the sidewalk, it's just not my cup of tea].The bar at The Gage has some very creative mixologists who can pull a Guinness just as adeptly as they can shake a mojito.Get thee to The Gage. I'll see you there."
"Picture this: me, in calf-high black socks, in white Reeboks and shorts, with a slightly worn out shirt asking for a table at the gage during lunch hour. The woman at the front desk gave me a funny look, which I did not notice until my co-worker mentioned it to me when we sat down. Our waiter, Joey, however, was friendly and courteous, so he either did not care that we didn't fit the attire of the usual lunch crowd or was laughing his ass off inside his mind.My co-worker had the fish and chips, while I had the regular burger. My co-worker thought the fries were awesome, and I thought the burger was pretty darn good. The seasoned fries were a great complement to the meal.For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse and the french toast. My co-worker thought the mousse was alright. I found The gage's interpretation of french toast for dessert quite interesting (they breaded the outside with something crunchy), while it reminded my co-worker of Cracker Jacks.Aside from the attitude, we had a pleasant experience here. Sadly, upscale restaurants are not my thing, but I wouldn't mind coming back here a few times (in approved attire)."
"Third or fourth visit here.  Have never had a bad meal.  I have to comment on the wait staff here.  I brought my son, who was in a wheel chair, and the entire staff was so helpful getting us a table on the first floor (during a very busy time) and helping us get back out.  Will most definately be back."
"This gastropub has some very delicious beers on offer and the food was very good. I had the rabbit hash eggs benedict, along with brie potatoes, and goat cheese grits. This is the type of food you will find here. Normal burger fans need not apply. I ended up choosing the above but I was so tempted by the fish and chips. I'd go back again."
"The service was great.  From the hostess to the server to the busser and the manager.  Everyone was friendly and transitions between them were seamless.  My friend and I sat down for a couple of drinks on the patio (and were told we had to order food to sit out there) to enjoy maybe the last nice day this year.  The menu was surprisingly nice (I hadn't checked it out before hand). four course setup.  We settled in for a couple apps and a few drinks.The Scottish egg was good, a bit dry, but adding the coarse mustard helped a lot.  The Antelope tartar was great, lots of fixings to help yourself to and create your own master piece.  The last thing we had was the fried chicken liver.  It was good, but also dry and the texture was off, very mushy on the inside, not as firm as I'd hoped.  Oh, I almost forgot the bread was hot, fresh and delicious.  I'm looking forward to going back for a full dinner experience."
"Gage...how can I put this in plain english our group of 15 paying customers is reprimanded by the manger Pat in a Chicago establishment for cheering for the Bulls on a 52 in flat screen tv at the bar...his exact words, ""if you want to cheer on the Bulls go to a sports bar down the street"" place is stuffier then your nose during flu season...had one round of overpriced drinks and the service is lackluster at best...any Chicago fan of any team shouldn't float this place a penny."
"We were visiting from out of town and went here based on recommendation. We started the evening off with a long, very opinionated dissertation of our waiter's  favorites on the menu. I don't know what it was, but it all went downhill from there. He gave the same long-winded spiel to the parties of two on either side of us ad nauseum.  The food was good, but the lackluster service (he abandoned us for another table of 6 business colleagues and rarely saw him again) we received diminished our experience considerably. We had cocktails before dinner and tried to flag him down to order wine with our food, but to no avail."
"I go here for one thing, and one thing only: the Bison Tartare.  Oh.  My.  God.  I have never eaten anything so delicious in my life.  At first, I was really hesitant, and kinda grossed out..but all that needed to happen was for me to take a bite.  I've been a believer since!  I had the mussels too, which I wasn't THAT impressed with.  I've had better.  But seriously?  The bison tartare....I could eat 2 orders all on my own.  Yum."
"My cousin owns a firm right next to this place and has a tab there, so while I was in town I got treated so I can't comment on the price here. We had some lunch and I enjoyed the vibe. I also met the owner who was a super Irish fella.All I know is, they have a good selection of beers and literally the best Fish & Chips I've ever had in my life.My cousin told me to put curry on the fish & chips and before I could respond (cuz apparently I gave him a crazy look) he said ""trust me"". I did, wow."
"I like this place.  My husband finds the yuppy clientele annoying, but when someplace is penned as a ""gastopub"", what do you expect?  The food is lovely, the drinks are nice as well, though overpriced, and I've always had really nice service when I've been.  Regardless of my seating arrangements.  The bar, if you can find a seat, is comfortable and quick.  The dining room is casual, yet you could easily take a business peer or a date here and have a first rate, quality dining experience.  I also like the fact that they try to find local/regional ingredients for their dishes."
"Solid and consistent.  The food does tend to be a bit on the heavy side so I like to eat here in the winter.  Last night, on a scorching evening, they had a lovely cold potato and leek soup which was perfect for the day.  The Gage is very popular and very loud.  A reservation is an excellent idea.  If you don't have one, their great beer offering will keep you occupied."
"I have eaten here a few times, and the last visit convinced me The food just isn't that good, especially for the price. I had scallops  were pretty good, but served over unseasoned, bitter greens. The mixed salad was not very tasty, and needed more dressing. My husband's burger was fair. Escargot were not the delectable morsel that we were expecting. Other guests at our table were similarly unimpressed. The worst part was the wait. Granted it was crowded, and a Saturday night, but service was painfully slow."
While I only had a couple apps and a round of drinks with friends my overall impression is overpriced mediocrity. The food is ok and worth half to two thirds the price. I know you pay for the real estate and all but they should try and make the food worth the price.
Great elk burger and beet salad.
"i rather like gage. in the sea of bad restaurants that is the loop area it is a bit of an oasis. the service is good. the decor is lovely. the drinks are strong! the prices are great considering where you are and what you get.on my last visit i had the soup and sandwich combo. the sandwich was wild mushrooms with radicchio and truffle oil, a yellow watermelon soup with micro greens and tuna tartar and a small side of fries. a great deal at something like $13.always an excellent choice when my husband and i are out shopping."
Best Fish and Chips outside of Dublin!!!!
"The Gage bills itself as a Gastropub, which is probably a good way to describe it. In other words, it's a traditional Irish Pub catering to the foodie crowd.I give them kudos for being a little more adventorous with their menu than most places. In addition to traditional chicken & steak dishes, you can also find entrees that feature antelope, rabbit & elk. The fried chicken livers were recomended, but were a big dissappointment for everyone. The House Poutine was quite tasty though.I ordered the sausages, which were a bit too greasy for my taste. A couple of the folks in our party really were a bit particualr in their dining choices, so they had difficult picking something they would enjoy.The service was friendly & helpful. We had a larger group, so we were kind of crammed in the back which was literally outside of the kitchen.The menu changes regularly, so be sure to check their website to see what's currently being offered.The beer selection was excellent, and I'm not much a beer drinker, so that's quite something for me to say.Right now I need to stick to giving this place a three, but I think it has potential to become a solid four. I plan on going back, perhaps with a smaller group and trying some other dishes to see if my experience is any different."
"Stylish, great food and mix of people. Classic but not stuffy. 3rd time here and food is top notch. Waitress Nicole was friendly, cool and very helpful. Music was excellent. Close to home.  We will be back again and again."
"This may have become my new favorite restaurant in the city.I've gone twice now and both times blew me away. For being located on Michigan Ave, just across from Millennium Park, and having to deal with all those tourists, this place handles the crowds well and move diners in and out at a great pace.The decor is nice with large booths and tables for any sized parties and a great downstairs area for private events. The servers are very knowledgeable and friendly. The wine list is amazing with many selections to pick from. The food is of a quality that reaches the top in my book from the amazing poutine, to the halibut, the great brussell sprouts side, and finishing off with an amazing dessert.If you're coming to Chicago and want a great dining night out, come to The Gage."
"We went here for brunch on a recent trip to Chicago. The eggs benedict were poorly done and definitely overcooked, but the brie potatoes were good and the basket of freshly baked scones and muffins was terrific, which made up for the eggs benedict.The location is, of course, terrific right in the middle of the Loop and across from Millennium Park, which will keep people coming. Prices and service are fine. The decor is tasteful, a kind of chic-gritty with dully-colored but shiny subway tiles on the walls and a nice cast iron/wood juxtaposition. They somehow manage to keep the restaurant dim but well-lit with a combination of dim lighting and gigantic windows in the front.Bottom line: nothing (good or bad) unexpected."
"With so many reviews I doubt I can write anything new and insightful. The only thing I can say is JUST GO! I considered this place the best dinner location in Chicago when I was there. Things I recommend..... Antelope tar-tare, Fish & Chips, and the burger. I only went once but wish I could have spend more evenings and meals there. The only disclaimer to add...the place is not cheap so bring your money!"
"Simply the best pub in the city. The interior decor is a perfect setting for any occasion whether it be a drink after work, a romantic meal or just a meal amongst friends. The buildings interior features subway tiles, exposed brick, lantern style light fixtures, and a wood top bar. The service in The Gage is exceptional with knowledge wait and bar staff that know the menu and are more than willing to suggest pairings for your meal. The menu features several traditional pub foods including The Gage Burger which in my opinion is the best burger in Chicago to more exquisite dishes such as pork belly, steaks, fish, and salads. The drink selection is great including many different import beers and wines to suit anyones taste. All together The Gage blends the atmosphere of an old world pub with the charm of fine dining to create a truly unique and enjoyable experience."
"Stopped by here during Restaurant Week to try out the food. I was pleasantly surprised at the fish and chips, they were the most flavorful and least greasy I've had in quite some time. The wine is good but definitely on the pricey side and we all paid upwards of 16 bucks a glass. Yikes. The scene is fun and lively, and looks like it would be a fun place to stop for Happy Hour cocktails and apps. It is crazy loud in there though, so if you're looking for  quiet conversation with your dining patron, I might think twice about stopping here! Otherwise, good food, fun atmosphere. Worth a try!"
"I thought the food was good but not for the price. Its loud and cramped. Unique decor but hard to enjoy with the dim lights. I see why it scores high, but wouldnt rate it on my MUST DO in Chicago list. If you want to impress clients, id take them/ send them here."
"I came here for lunch on a friend's recommendation during my recent trip to Chicago. My bf and I shared the elk poutine for an appetizer, which cannot be even compared to the Québec poutine. Fries were from frozen and there were not enough cheese curds nor meat. Skip it and save your appetite. The soup and sandwich combos we both ordered however were fantastic. Soup was pea soup, which I would never normally order except it sounded heavenly with bacon, crab and crème fraiche. Delish! My sandwich was the Roasted Turkey Salad filled a creative combination of walnuts, grapes, red onion, thyme, mayo, avocado, iceburg lettuce and tomato on ciabatta. Probably one of the tastiest sandwiches I had ever eaten. Unfortunately I ended up in a serious food coma later that afternoon. Definitely one of the restaurants I'll be returning to when I take another trip to the city."
"Stopped in for lunch on Sunday.  I love the bar area, and the fact that you can just grab a seat for a quick bite without having to wait for a table.  I had the pulled pork sandwich which was tender and juicy.  I liked the combination of the stone ground mustard with the onion rings and sweet chili sauce.  My boyfriend had the lamb stew which was fork tender.  The flavors were nice and a great twist on a traditional Vindaloo.  I could have easily hung out there for a couple of hours chatting over a few beers.  I'll be back again when I have more time to kill."
I went went a friend for some cocktails after christkindlemarket and was not disappointed. It is a bit pricey but well worth it. The bartender and staff were super friendly. I ate the scallops and they were cooked perfectly. I will definitely be going back and recommend to all my friends.
For lunch I had the pork belly reuben and it was really good. There fries aren't that great. I also had a cup of the Clam Chowder which was really rich but had a lot of flavor. Tax and tip $23 for lunch.
"Walked out $100 lighter...and nothing memorable. Salad was the only good item. Is there a contest to see how many ingredients you can pile on - I couldn't believe it when waiter rattled off the special fish dish. Place was nearly empty, Sunday night, 7p...and we're seated on top of others at close -in 2 tables....when there was plenty of room throughout.Pretty place, nice lights and glass...drinks and wine prices ridiculous....will not be back."
"My out of town guest and I had great food and wine and perfect service. Highly recommend. It was very busy but the service never let up. Also, the guy who actually served our wine was a total pro. I feel like a lot of restaurants have let this aspect of service drop but not the Gage."
"I came to the Gage with a few folks for a recent workday lunch.  Our table had a variety of dishes, and I can't say that anyone was disappointed.  At the same time, no one raved, although that is hardly a detraction.  We stayed mostly with the sandwiches and salads, although the tables nearby had a set of entrees, both of which looked good.I had a vegetarian, mushroom-based sandwich.  It was tasty, although heavier than it needed to be.  The rest of the table was satisfied with its food, and the burgers looked tasty."
"Recommended by a colleague who joined me and another colleague - Gage was a hit! Cool menu of courses 1-4 + dessert. We didn't do all 4 :-)... but what we had was great - including a few appetizers mussels vindaloo, fava mousse (a surprisingly great little dish - and not one I would have picked on my own), and sausage stuffed peppers. Entrees selections Fish and Chips (Guiness and Vodka dipped - sold!:-), Risotto, and home-made sausage. Shared dessert topped off a great meal. Worth checking out  - as an alternative to DD Pizza."
"MMM - tasty and unique. I can't say I had ever eaten a Scotch egg or bacon foam before dining at The Gage but I guess there's a first for everything and these guys really nailed it. I'm not sure which cuisine genre this place falls into but whatever it is, I'm diggin' it. I had the pork chop with some lovely autumnal vegetables and a garnish of some white powdery/foamy stuff that tasted like bacon. Once I put it on the chop (which obviously needed more pork) it sort of melted in and gave the meat another dimension of deliciousness. I guess the chef likes to experiment with food and chemistry. Nice! Other good stuff: Excellent wine list and very helpful sommelier. Fantastic service.Cozy atmosphereDo it."
"had the pleasure of going back to the gage this past weekend, where i was able to sit outside with the boy, my bf, and her mom for a little birthday celebration. needless to say, i have gotten over my fear of the bathroom in the basement, and the tables were nice and spread out on the outside patio. this time around we opted for beers as our drinks, as it was in the mid-80s at 9 pm and we needed something refreshing. us girls stuck to familiar beers, where the boy strayed away and chose a new beer. for the eats we started with the cheese board, where each cheese was perfectly paired with an accompaniment (such as honeycomb, pineapple jelly, and candied walnuts). for entrees, i had the lemon tofu, while my fellow diners had the chicken, the short-rib with fusilloni, and the venison burger. being vegetarian now, i was unable to sample the others' dishes, but let's just say we were all members of the clean plate club that night. everything was absolutely delicious, where my lemon tofu was nicely balanced with a pea curry puree, mushrooms, and israeli couscous. de.vine. i also want to send a shout-out to tony, our waiter, for his great energy and recommendations throughout the night! having a great staff makes all the difference. until next time (which will come soon)..."
Great ambiance and great service.  Haven't tried the food yet.
One of my favorite places.  Billy is always around and very kind to his guests.  The food is always good and the vibe is always energetic and friendly.  I love this place and so does my girl.
"Gone many times to this happening place where the regulars mingle with the tourists, all tasting high society on Michigan Ave. If you come, come for the ambiance and a drink at the bar.  The food is delicious as well, but not quite worth the price-tag. This is one of those places you need to go to experience one of the shades of a Chicagoan."
"Noise level and a late seating over take excellent food, would have easily been 4 stars with better table management.7 of us made reservations. we were on time, they were not. We had a 25 minute wait for our table. A large round table looked inviting. Once seated, I was knocked in the back every time a server or bus person walked behind me. The noise level in this restaurant is not conversation friendly. wonderful decor.All of us enjoyed our food. The mussels and duck were a real hit. One complaint was one of the fish specials was drastically undercooked. I mentioned it to the server and was told ""that's the way it is supposed to be"". Two of us had the same dish and one was done and the other was not. I left uneaten fish on my plate.Because our table was late we were unable to enjoy desert or coffee after our meal due to other plans....and had to rush at the end of the meal. Our hour and 45 minute window would have been plenty of time, their poor table management destroyed that. We were hoping for better, but got very good and would certainly consider returning with fewer people and maybe not on a busy Saturday night."
"I haven't eaten an actual meal here, so I'll just focus on my experience at the bar.  Simply put, top-notch!  The bar has an extensive selection of scotch (my favorite libation) and a pretty formidable drink list.  I had a glass of Laphraoig Quarter Cask and the Chicken Livers...excellent paring!  The Gage is great for a quick drink or a boozy afternoon on Michigan Ave."
"Came here on a date of sorts on recommendation from Chicago magazine, which listed The Gage as one of the best new restaurants in the city.  It was certainly a fine establishment, and one you could easily dine in for $20 a person, or $60, depending on your mood.  The starters listed included some great standouts, such as the antelope tartar that we ordered which included a selection of mustards to pair with the raw game.  The meat was delicious and bare, very good!  We shared main courses of roasted chicken and whitefish with sliced truffles.  The chicken was juicy and tender and very good.  The whitefish was a real standout since whitefish is one of those things that comes in two varieties: bad/mediocre and friggin amazing.  There is no middle ground.  This fish was of the latter, cooked just right and faking into moist piece of delectable flesh punctuated by the savory earthiness of the healthy grating of rare black truffles.Service was good and swift.  Water was refilled regularly and a request for a slice of lemon was quickly filled with an entire lemon, sliced into fifths.  Our meal, with drinks, ran to about $55 a head, but I imagine that had we come and had something off of the sandwich menu, which would have been more than satisfying, we'd have come out for about half that."
"I liked everything I tried here-- the pint of shrimp was tasty, the oysters were very fresh and served on a mixture of brown sugar and salt... perfectly highlighting the sweet and briny oysters.  The fish and chips were good too-- the batter was light and the fries were perfect (although, I wish they served them with curry sauce, like they do when you get them as an appetizer).My only complaint is the cost-- those three dishes plus four drinks cost over $100!  I mean, seriously?  For fish and chips?  Granted, the beers cost $10-$15 a piece, but frankly, that didn't seem reasonable either."
"The few times I've stopped into The Gage for a drink I've been pleasantly surprised.  The green glazed subway tiles and spacious dark wood bar is a delightful place to sip a fancy beer (they have Affligem on tap) while watching tourists drool over Millennium Park.I hate to say this-- but it doesn't feel like Chicago, it feels classy and cosmopolitan, despite the TVs behind the bar."
"Trip to the Gage was great on each end and a little soft in the middle. The service bordered on terrible, yet the reason I would return is one of two words:SCOTCH EGG.Does anyone remember the SNL skit for ""Taco Town""? You know the one with the taco-Wrapped in a corn tortilla filled with cheese, then -Wrapped in a deep friend gordita shell slathered with green goo, then -Baked in a corn husk, then -Wrapped in a French style crepe filled with egg, ham, and other assorted savories, then -Wrapped in Chicago pizza, then... Ah, just forget it. Imagine all of that ridiculousness in fiction, now make it real. The Scotch Egg is a seasoned hard cooked egg encased in breakfast sausage, slathered with panko bread crumbs and deep fried. It basically is a whole breakfast made into an appetizer. It was pretty spectacular served on a salad of dandelion greens with a quenelle of spicy mustard. The soft middle was the Lamb Vindaloo. The stew had the standard vindaloo spice, but not the richness that I associate with the dish. The reason, I am guessing is the lack of bone used when making the stew. I wouldn't order it again. I'd just slap another scotch egg in the fryer and take the plunge.The other high point of the meal was the dessert. The Gage Smore was a lovely marshmallow, peanut butter puff on a chocolate graham cracker covered in chocolate with a marshmallow foam surrounding. It was incredibly rich and could have been shared.The service was abrupt and gave incorrect descriptions of the dishes ordered by my co-diner. I would expect more from a place that charges the prices on the menu."
"my friends and i paid a visit to the gage after realizing that valentine's day is a big restaurant holiday, and getting reservations at any restaurant is impossible.  so needless to say, the gage was not our top choice, but i was pleasantly surprised.i know what you're thinking...""but it's on by millennium park/it's a tourist trap.""  i thought the same thing, but from the minute we walked in, my friends and i were greeted warmly, seated at our booth promptly, and given warm bread.  warm bread is definitely the way to my heart.  i was also really surprised by their music selection---the xx, ratatat, arcade fire, and yeah yeah yeahs.  definitely not what i expected.our waitress was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions without the slightest hint of pretension or impatience, even when we were waiting for the other half of our party to arrive.  she, along with several other bussers, came by frequently to refill water and offer drinks while we waited.  i ordered the locally crafted sausages, which came with crispy potatoes with melted brie.  oh, my.  there were 3 different types of sausage, all with a really nice snap, and the potatoes.  ohhh, the potatoes.  they are prepared in a small cast iron pot, so every piece of potato that touched the sides were perfectly crispy while still soft and starchy in the middle.  the brie was a perfect complement.  i also shared bites of food off my friends plate--roasted chicken, poutine, fondue, and scallops.  all of which were yummy.  so while i'm not sure that the gage will make it on my regular rotation of restaurants, i am definitely glad that i tried it.  i'll definitely be back when the occasion calls for it."
"DAMN BOY! I love me 'dem fried chicken livers! Shoot 'dem thangs down me throat like dat der goldfish swallowin' contest at the Fayette County Fair back in '92! Hee Haw!!!okback to reality for a moment.no, i didn't try the chicken livers.but seeing them on the menu provided divine inspiration. for some reason i just imagined someone getting a plate of little slimy things and swallowing them whole. probably not the case at all. i'm sure they're wonderful.as for me. i had the $10 regular burger, 'cause I'm po' that way. and it was a mighty fine burger. added a draft beer, some fries, and yes, ok, my cosmo side dictated that i have spaghetti squash and goat cheese as another side. but F me it was good.dug the decor. dark wood. light table clothes. sorta timeless. hostesses, servers and bartenders seemed like a nice bunch of people. they showered this humble pittsburgher with love. and damn, that's all i can really ask for."
NEVER disappointed with the food or service.  It can get a bit noisey for larger business meetings if you need to hear everyone at the table. I have been hosting out-of-towners there since they opened.
"After my group was done visiting Millennium Park, we popped in here for a late lunch. The food was on the pricier side, but it was pretty tasty. I ordered the half sandwich, half soup combo which was really filling, unlike other expensive restaurants. The best part was the smoked salmon sandwich I ordered- it was to die for. Smoked salmon with mustard, tomato, lettuce and aioli sandwiched (excuse the pun) between two toasted slices of sourdough? YUM. I also ordered the corn soup, which was good, but not my favorite soup ever. The fries were like standard steakhouse fries, so they were a little greasy, pretty thick, and lightly salted. Personally, I like my fries flavorful so I ended up putting a ton of extra salt and pepper on the fries, which made them taste great. I would definitely stop by here for lunch again when I'm in the neighborhood!"
"The Gage was a highlight of our trip to Chicago. The decor, service, drinks and food were all fantastic. Being vegetarian, there were plenty of options for me. Since the restaurant is across the street from Millenium Park, it makes for a perfect setting."
"Excellent food and exceptional service. Friendly and professional staff. Was on the louder side, so ask for a quieter table if you prefer."
"The only sane place on Black Friday for lunch.Excellent service and a very nice decor.Had the Gage Burger...one of the best burgers I have ever had.Can't remember which wine I had, but the wine list was quite nice.My mom had the scallops and my dad had the soup (very cool presentation), they both enjoyed their meal and wine as well."
"I had a flawless first-time experience at The Gage last night.  I started with one of their signature cocktails, Grey Goose La Poire/Yuzu/White Grape.  Fantastic.  We started with the Gage Fondue, which came out in a small iron pot served with long crisp flatbreads.  Delicious, and very rich.  I moved on with a salad which contained Three Rivers Organic Lettuces, Muscat Grapes, Raisins, Maytag Blue, and a Champagne Vinaigrette.  I have to say this is one of my favorite salads in recent history. For dinner I had the Goat Cheese Risotto, again served in one of their tiny iron pots.  It had a layer of Basil Puree on the bottom and contained 2 crisp escargot, it was like a little treasure hunt!  Absolutely delicious.For dessert, the Chocolate Cherry Polenta Cake did not disappoint, but  it was served with a couple of sugar-covered concord grapes that nearly stole the show!Overall a truly fantastic experience.  Our server was knowledgeable and visibly passionate about the food there, which brought the experience up a notch.  I have already made a reservation to go back next month!"
"So I've been here a few times and it's alright.  Not superb but just alright.  The interior is great with it's nice long undulating bar.  The space is also divided nicely but I must say that it is unusually loud.  It was a Wednesday night and while there was a lot of people in the place it shouldn't have had been so loud that I had to yell the bartender my order, which he couldn't even hear.  After the second attempt I pointed at the drink I wanted.  I believe this to be a huge design flaw, there really should be some soft surfaces to capture some of this noise.On to the service; my bartender was attentive and nice.  When he left I had another ask if I needed anything.  I felt taken care of at the bar.  The service in the dining room could use some improvement.  We had forgotten utensils and a request to leave off a condiment which was there on the plate when the dish arrived. We had to wave down the server on more than one occasion, which is one too many.  The water boys, on the other hand were attentive, this is a nice touch.  It just showed me that while the water guys were paying attention to what was happening on our table, the server had no clue.  We had to ask for the bill about 15 minutes after we had finished eating.  The food:  the food is good but it isn't excellent.  This last time I was at Gage was January 2008.  I've been traveling so when I came here a year and a half later I expected to see some changes to the menu.  Not so.  There wasn't any marked change nor was the food any better but rather, it was just OK.  They had a good thing going when they first got started but their standard seems to have dropped.  I hope this changes."
"Food was ok but nothing to recommend.  The service was great, atmospher fun, location perfect....  I feel like maybe the head chef was off sick or something.  The food concepts sounded wonderful and the other great reviews this place has gotten makes me feel like I went on an off day because every thing my group ordered was sub par at best.  I hope other people don't experience the same thing I did because there was nothing of the five entrees ordered that I can say anything good about."
"The Gage was described to me as a really cool and unique place, with an Irish pub feel to the front, and formal dining towards the back. I was intrigued by this combination, and decided to check it out last night for Restaurant Week. Overall I had a great time, really liked the atmosphere and was very satisfied with both my food and drinks. At first I was skeptical because it is across the street from Millennium Park. But when I walked in it was crowded, which I take as a good sign, and I liked the overall vibe. We couldn't get a real table but one opened up by the bar which worked out better anyway. The Gage has a fantastic selection of draft beers - not a huge selection but quality offerings - Green Line, Paulaner, Gossamer, Stella to name a few. The taps were unique. I was happy. You also have to respect a bar that pours beer into the glasses made for the specific beer. When we sat down our waitress was very nice and had a high beer-iq, which was impressive. We decided to pass on the ""restaurant week"" deal, as I did not see anyone else indulging and it was pricey. We had a fondue appetizer, which was mediocre, but then had a ""Gage burger"", which was fantastic. Some reviews on here claim the Gage Burger was an overpriced regular pub burger, but they are very very wrong. You could tell the meat was high quality lean ground beef cooked perfectly, and it was thick. The onions were deliciously caramelized, it was topped with gourmet cheese which blended together nicely. The bread brought everything together, and was not your average hamburger bun. Far from it in toastiness, quality, and taste, however still held the burger together like a true bun should. The fun part were the garnishes that you could place on the burger if you were feeling risky. They included miniature spicy pickles, deliciously rich olives, and the standard lettuce, tomato, and red onion. The pickle that garnished the plate was not timid. It was a full-blown huge dill pickle that provided an awesome crunch to break up the greasy bites of the burger. And then the fries. They were tasty and came in their own separate bowl, as per not to disturb the greatness of the burger plate and mix two different types of greasiness. It's the little things that lead to greatness. The burger got a little sloppy towards the end, but that's probably my fault, not the burgers'. The Gage was relatively expensive. And I say relatively because most other places in Chicago are cheap. I paid prices here that I expected to pay when coming to a major city, based on what I was used to in NYC. $16 for the generous burger with fries, $9 for the fondue appetizer, and $6/beer. Well worth it for the quality service/food/beer you are receiving. Those who don't agree I would venture to call cheap. I'm very torn between 4 and 5 stars. I'll definitely stop back in during the Summer when I'm in the Millennium Park area and make the final decision. Note - as it got later the bar did not fill, it emptied. I would presume to say this is a good ""after work"" spot, but not a place to make the focus of your night on a Fri/Sat."
"Have had excellent experiences there.  With clients, family, friends, new acquaintances.  You can have a great evening just ordering appetizers or go for it for a full blown dinner.It does get crowded, and you do feel packed in, but the food makes up for it.  Billy is an incredibly nice person.  He really knows how to greet guests and make people feel welcome.  He also has a great eye for talent: the staff (wait staff, bartenders, bussers) are incredibly professional and serve as a perfect model for other establishments.have fun!"
"I just called the Gage to inquire about bringing 20-25 people in for an ""after-dinner"" casual event and the guy that I spoke with, I think his name was Dave, was incredibly rude and was not interested in the least in helping me.  I've been here for dinner, drinks and  my company has held multiple private events in the past and I never expected to be treated so rudely.  I will not be planning any events at the Gage in the future.Gage - big mistake, HUGE."
"Not much new to add. Great service, incredible food, wonderful space. If you've never had one, def. try the Scotch Egg. Also they serve a tasty version of an old fashioned made with Marker's Mark."
This place is amazing.  From the food to the services.  I came in for brunch with some friends on a Saturday.  I had the poached egg and corn beef hash and it was yummy.  Everything we order was delicious from the beet salad to their special sandwich of the day.  The decor was cozy.  Its a great place to catch up with friends.
"Tourist trap.When they first opened the staff seemed miserable. Good enough reason to avoid it, although they are supposedly good for fish and chips.A year later, the bar staff seemed normal.  Progress indeed!Sadly, the food was LACKING.  Gastro-pub blah blah, everything on the menu is way heavy.  Not a single half-light or slightly forgiving option.  Heart attacks indeed.Love - egg appetizer.  Not intended to be healthy and gosh, YUM.  I can forgive a lot just for that delight.  But.....Why was my sausage dinner so miserably heavy?  I don't know what I ate cause the sausages weren't defined.  Worse, they were FRIED for service.  Same with the mac and cheese.  Not deep fried but still seriously fried for service warm up.    Really?  Anytime I can taste the oil for prepared food someone has cheaped out or otherwise jacked up innocent local delights.  Shame on them.Two stars cause of the sausage treat and happier-appearing staff.  I'm being nice."
"our team dine here two years in the row for each time we have trade show in Chicago, food is good, wait staff all are very professional, knows what they are talking about and they took good care of us too....we will definitely return for next year."
"I went here for a weekday lunch with some coworkers and had zero wait, the staff was great (not one but two owner/manager types stopped by to ask hour our meal was), the food was delicious and the portions were huge!  I got the beef brisket on brioche, topped with swiss cheese, arugula and apples...tasty and original -- a good combo.  It's at a great location if you're near the Art Institute, Millennium Park or work downtown."
"By any measure, I dug The Gage. Carefully striking a pose between comfy and upscale, it's not hard to see why this place might become a consistent stopover for those in the know along Michigan Avenue.  Andrea W was filling me in about some of the local buzz about this place, and I can see why, upon dining here, that it's been discussed:  snappy (punctual) service, a nice selection of appetizer, dinner and dessert options and a full cadre of drink selections at the ready.  This place came to play.Maybe it was because it was a little chilly out this evening, or maybe it was something else altogether, but I couldn't help but notice how appropriate and sumptuous the chicken and giant noodle soup was.  It served me well from the inside out.   Dinner brought fish & chips, and with them a curbing of my hunger.  I had just enough in me to sample the peanut butter smores, which were energetically presented (really) and subsequently devoured.  The semi-ambient lighting was an extra nice touch.  A place to keep in my hip pocket the next time I'm on Michigan Avenue."
"I have tried a variety of items here over the last 4 years, but always go back to the regular burger. It is one of the best in the city and they have Matilda on tap. Really couldn't ask for much more. Also the service tends to always be on the fast side, but Friday night it was 5 minutes between ordering and receiving our food."
"We spent the day at the Art Institute and were looking for a decent, but not too expensive, early dinner in this (very) touristy part of the city.  I had read good things about The Gage and you can't beat the location across the street from the museum.  The weather was great so we decided to sit outside. The atmosphere was fine...a combination of tourists and locals, with dress running the gamut from shorts and t-shirts to fairly dressy.  The bar looked nice but I can't comment on the interior of the restaurant since we only passed through the bar on our way outside.They have a nice selection of beers on the menu along with a choice with a choice of seasonal ""libations"" (our waiter's word of the day).  The waiter was very nice... hovering, but very polite. When I had trouble deciding on what beer to drink, he made a suggestion based on my brief description of what type of beers I prefer and brought me a taste.  Just what I was looking for.  I wanted the food to be better than it was.  It was fine, but certainly nothing to rave about, and pricey. ($16.00 for the burger?!?!!).  I ordered the lobster bisque ($12.00) and the Gage burger.  My hubby had the Hamachi appetizer($10.00) and the mussels vindaloo starter($14.00).  The bisque was pretty good but lukewarm when it arrived.  I guess i was supposed to be impressed with the presentation.  The bowl arrived with only the pineapple and molasses garnish and then they poured the bisque from a metal cream pitcher??? over the top. Ummm, ok.  And the molasses really stuck to the bottom of the bowl so the second half of the bowl was overwhelmed by the taste.   My burger was perfectly cooked, the HUGE pickle and the fries were great.  The meat was good, but i didn't care for the flavor of the onion marmalade in combination with the Camembert cheese.  I scraped off the onions and I'm not a scrape it off kind of eater.  My husband's Hamachi appetizer was skimpy, and in his words, ""really fishy"".  And he eats a lot of raw fish. He really liked the mussels vindaloo and the toast served with it to soak up the sauce.Wine by the glass is, in my opinion, overpriced.  Total bill, including tax and tip,for 2 beers, 2 glasses of wine, 3 starters and a burger was $124.00.  Would I go back?  For  a beer and a snack probably. But dinner?  Definitely not."
"The Gage is one of my favorite places in the city and one of the only places I'm willing to go for food or drink downtown.  You have to understand: I work in the Loop.  After work, I want to get as far away from the Loop as possible.  But there are times when I have to suck it up and meet a friend from out of town for dinner, or need a place to go before a museum or show, and those are the times I go to the Gage.  The atmosphere is great and the decor impressive, I especially love the bar that goes on forever (though, as others have said, it's really noisy and gets crowded).  This is the kind of place where you might run into Da Mare (no joke, I saw him there in March) and it somehow seems less full of tourists than so many other restaurants in that area.  Or maybe they're just better dressed tourists?  Whatever, I don't get that Indiana vibe from every other person I see and that's just fine with me.The wine list is extensive and expensive but if you're up for a splurge you'll get a great glass.  Good beer list, though I've never actually had any here, and a nice selection of cocktails as well.  The food is fantastic; curry chips are amazing (huge portion though, best to share), they have good soups and salads (word to the wise: if you're a strict vegetarian or don't care for seafood stay away from the Romaine; it comes with anchovies and the dressing is much more fishy than your average Ceasar) and a nice selection of sandwiches and as for entrees?  Well, to be honest, I've only ever gotten the Daily Risotto.  Because it is just that freaking amazing; I love Grana Padano like the fat kid loves cake.I can't comment on the Brunch menu as I've never tried it and I've only ever sat at the bar (always to avoid a wait for a table) but can say that service there is great.  Seriously, writing this review has been enough to make me want to go for dinner tonight!  Love you, Gage..."
"Not that this place needs another review...but here goes..Service was good, but not outstanding.  We ordered the fried olives and zucchini for a starter.  It was good, crisp, and not oily.  I then had a salad and we ordered the mussels.  The salad was a bowl of mixed greens.  Seriously, for $9?  Pass on any of the salads.  The mussels where very good.  I recommend them.  Finally, we finished our meal with the main course - fish and chips.  Excellent! Best Fish and Chips I have ever had.  Overall, a four stars."
"I've been coming to the Gage for quite some time.  I like their selection of drinks and their appetizers.  Their scallops are delicious, but like other expensive restaurants, they charge $15 or so for 2 scallops.  The rest of the food was just ok.  My ABSOLUTE favorite items to get here are the Gage N-17 fondue and the Amalfi Dream cocktail!!! mMMMMMMm!!!They have a great location across from Millenium Park and the bar and seating areas are very spacious.  However on one occasion, a Thursday evening after night class last summer, a group of early thirty-somethings asked my friend and me if we were swingers. Yikes! Sorry, but I am not.  With the exception of that incident, I've had great times at The Gage and great drinks too! Though expensive, The Gage is a great place to stop if you're in the area.  It offers a great space to relax and enjoy a meal and drinks since most similar places are further north on Michigan.  Go here mainly for drinks and appetizers. It's definitely one of my favorites."
I like this place. I have liked it since the very beginning.  What's not to like...Michigan Ave..outside dining...generous pours of wine.  But Gage - please make some changes to the menu!  It has been the same menu for soooo long.  No one wants fondue when it is 80 degrees.  How about some seasonal fresh stuff?  Asparagus rather than the same brussel sprouts maybe?  Just a suggestion.  Still a favorite for location and people watching.
"Ya know...I dug it.  Especially if you are lunching on work's dollar.I had a burger - it was really good.But, I think the atmosphere does it for me.  Its got a lot more character than most nicer loop lunch spots.  Not sure if I'd come downtown just to eat here, unless I was entertaining out-of-towners and we were in the vicinity.  Definitely a fresh, fun option for an nicer (I wouldn't call it upscale bc its basically a bar with a great menu - gastropub? Is that what the foodies are calling these joints now?) lunch - either business related or one of those boss-taking-you-out-for-your-bday lunches."
"I'm wondering, with other reviewers here, what I missed.  Some of the food was really, really great, and other dishes just seemed completely off and poorly executed.To start off, we were really excited about our server, who was very knowledgeable about the menu, but when it came to actually serving us, he was totally lackluster.  We went forever without cocktail refills, and one member of our party had to ask 4 different staff members several times just to get another beer.  We tried several appetizers, the bison tartare, the house poutine, the scotch egg, the duck nuts, and the crispy pork belly.  The bison tartare was fantastic, the scotch egg and poutine okay, but the pork belly was served with some squid that didn't really compliment the pork.  It was just a slightly weird combination.For third course, I had the scallops, which were fantastic and perfectly cooked.  The other guests I was dining with raved about the halibut.  For fourth course, I had the gnudi, which was good, but nothing great.  Others had the Amish chicken, which they enjoyed, and a few had the pork chop special, which a few complained that the portion was huge for a course progression.Dessert was fantastic-we had the chocolate pave and the peanut butter beignets, both of which we completely cleaned the plates on.It's too bad the service wasn't better, otherwise I might have given it a few more stars."
Good bar.
"I would really go 2.5  Not a bad place, I loved the decor and the staff were wonderful. I have a really hard time spending $7 for a pint of Guinness or Fat Tire. Fortunately for me, I only had to pay for a few as I was invited to a free party downstairs.The food was wonderful and the beer was free at that point. I did not get to see how much the food was,etc...but it was very good.  I am not cheap by any means, but if you drink as many beers as I do, that would be a hefty tab at $7 a pop:)"
"I had an outstanding meal tonight at The Gage.  This was a last-minute find for me on Yelp as I'm visiting from San Francisco.  I was suppose to have dinner elsewhere with work colleagues but our timing was off.  While the burgers and fish & chips I saw on other tables looked amazing, I was trying to keep it on the lighter-side due tonight. I started with the Sliced Hamachi (w/celery/red chile/sherry gastrique) followed by a special of the day, White Gazpacho cucumber/grapes/cumin) with Crab & Cuttlefish Tobiko.  Perfect food for a warm evening. My real splurge item was the Eel & Foie Gras Terrine.  Fantastic!  This was a great and unusual pairing of two of my favorite food items.  They served this with some beautiful and unusual crackers which were tanned and glossy with some herbs embedded in them.  I actually also ate this with some of the delicious multi-grain sourdough (my guess) bread which came to my table steaming hot.My server Amanda was so pleasant and helpful.  The rest of the staff also took great care of everyone.  I hope to return to The Gage the next time I'm in town."
"Delicious gourmet food without the snooty, uncomfortable atmosphere. Great for an unsophisticated diner like me.And the waiters are hot."
"One of my favorite places in the city. The fish and chips are delicious and served wrapped in newsprint (which is apparently how you get them in England). Their burger ""the gage"" probably the best hamburger I've ever had. An upscale pub that works as a great place for a lunch with coworkers, a drink after work, or a dinner with friends."
"The Gage is a solid, go-to lunch destination for me.  The decor is very chic and the lunch specials are really reasonable.  The service is always good and every time I go, the manager comes over to the table to inquire about our experience.  The smoked salmon sandwich is excellent and a big portion too and you get a delicious roll of bread when you sit down.  Warm and inviting."
"The Gage's popularity is well deserved. The food is genuine gastro-pub but at a higher quality than you might expect given it's location near Millennium Park. The menu emphasizes fresh and local where possible (be thankful that the fish is not from Lake Michigan). In my experience, the service ranges from good to excellent. I strongly recommend the scotch egg, the beat salad, the lamb pot-roast, and the duck. The burger and fish &amp; chips are also pretty good. My ratings are relative to class: 5 out of 5 because this is the best gastro-pub in Chicago."
"This place is great;  great food, great ambiance, very friendly staff.  Also, as a 'regular' at The Gage (about once a week on average for well over two years), I can attest to the consistency of the food.  It's always great!"
"It was good but way too crowded!  Great bartenders,"
"Went here on a business lunch and was very pleased.  Everything was great.  Had the scotch egg as a starter; eggs-cellent.  Not often you find poutine this far south of the border and it was well done.  Pork belly sandwich for my main was great.  Beer selection looked very interesting, but I couldn't indulge.  Cool space.  Would definitely head back."
"Oof.A girl friend and I just wandered in after taking in two exhibits at the Institute on President's Day.  No reservation.  We sat on the bar side and had the very nicest server - Michelle, Molly?  Anyway, she was fantastic.  She steered us in the right direction with their lunch menu:  the Scotch egg, the brisket sandwich, the Gage burger, the brie potatoes and the French Toast and chocolate torte for dessert.Yeah, we had an $80 lunch.  So what?The egg was like a tiny breakfast, a whole hardboiled egg wrapped in spicy sausage, fried and served with brown mustard.  Not greasy and totally yummy.The brisket sandwich was a revelation:  tender, flavorful, piled with some salad things, and a crisp sliced green apple that was a nice counterpoint to the beefiness.  It came with ketchup on the side but that was totally extraneous.The Gage Burger was awesome and just as pricey as the RL Burger.  And worth it.  It was juicy, not bland and I was a little sad to see the portion that I put on my friend's plate still sitting there because she got full.  Do not waste the burger!The only weak spot was the brie potatoes which were only ok.  Brie isn't a very strong cheese.  If it was an english stilton, then it would have been a different story.  But the potatoes were cooked well.The desserts - oh my goodness.  At this point of the afternoon, the man sitting next to us just sat back and watched us eat with a smile on his face.  I guess two women pounding it back was entertaining.  The French Toast is not to be missed; it has little Japanese crunchy things on it!  What are they?  Where do they come from?  Why are they so good?  What's in the caramel sauce that makes it so good??  The chocolate torte is something to share, it's so rich and evil.  It was at this point that we realized that perhaps we had been overindulgent.But I believe that when you go somewhere to eat, then for god's sake - Eat.We chased everything down with a pint of Guinness for me and a cute little rum thing our server made for my friend.  Yummy.  A word about our server:  she rocked.  Personal attention, friendliness, guided us through the menu and made excellent recommendations.  We gave her a very hefty tip.  We'll be back."
"A great addition to lower Michigan Avenue which so needed a better restaurant.  I am surprised at the negative reviews.First this is a restaurant that is a first mover in this up and coming area.  The set is comfortable-- big large booths and pays homage to what feels 20s and 30s in subtle ways;  the service was very friendly and engaging and there always when needed.  Helped to hone in on a diners indecision and come up with a selection.  My table started with the Vindaloo mussels; the Vindaloo sauce did not overpower the mussels instead perfectly matched the brine in the mussel with the sweet and savory of the sauce.  This was a very generous portion--could almost be a meal; ask for more bread to enjoy the sauce.      Enjoy with a large table to not interfere with your meal.  For lunch I enjoyed the Prime Burger; expensive $16 but absolutely worth it--a reasonable price for such wondrous quality.  The burger was well done with Moroccan olive, lettuce, tomato, red onion and pickles.  The olive was such a perfect touch, unexpected but worked beautifully.  The fries kept emanating a dash of truffle oil; gorgeous fries; I had to restrain myself from eating every fry.  The Amish chicken is a beautiful presentation.  Let the wait staff undo what is in the pot; and out comes a beautiful chicken with green beans and goat cheese; the flavors work quite well and continuously play off each other.  A small but nice little wine offering; I really liked the wine presentation by the glass; I had the La Planta Tempranillo served in a very nice decanter; I really like this touch and wish more restaurants would do this.  The dessert was a chocolate mouse; deep rich and light chocolate mouse with various chocolate strips and powders mixed with ground coffee; a wonderful meal and this was just lunch.  I will return for dinner.  Buen Provecho!"
Excellent venison burger
"Amazing service was followed by some o the best bloody marys we have had. The only real problem I had was deciding which menu to choose from, the lunch or the brunch.  I went with the corned beef hash, and awesome was an understatement.  Their full bar had a number of beers that other restaurants had been sold out of.   Definitely worth stopping in."
"Great place to drop by after the Art Institute, but don't eat here if you are looking for something light & healthy. It's definitely indulgence worthy, though. The fries are among The best I've ever eaten. Lively ambience."
"Um, yum! What took me so long to check this place out? The food was really perfect. I had a special black cod and my mom had the pork chop. Loved both. Also enjoyed the Brussles Sprouts (they had me at Brie and Bacon). They had really nice wines by the glass. At first glance they seemed a bit pricey, but once they bring them out, you really get more than a glass so it seems to even out. Plus this space is really nice. Love it!"
"This review will be in respect to their burger...It was very average food for very above average prices.  I had ""The Gage"" burger, 17 bucks for an okay burger, it didn't taste any better than a burger you can get at any other standard eatery.  Also, 7 bucks for a pint of Guinness?  That's kind of dick, even if you're supposed to put forth a swankier image.Verdict: In the context of a fine beer and burger, it makes me long for Paramount Room, for 1/3rd the cost, I actually get a higher quality and yummier burger, and a delicious pint.  For what is touted as a Gastropub, their beer selection was very mainstream and standard.  (Guinness, Smithwick's, Harp, etc.)"
We sat at the bar. The menu wasn't appealing so I had the default of steak with (garlic) mash potatoes.  Both were very good. I also like their dirty martinis with the blue cheese olives. yum.
"I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Lunch: I came here yesterday with my mother and grandmother. My mom and I each had the cheeseburger, which was juicy and deeeelicious. My grandmother had the special, which was a lamb and steak sandwich. I couldn't tell if she liked it or not because she was complaining about everything that day. Service was pretty good, but not great. The price was reasonable for such a nice lunch. Dinner: I didn't really have a full dinner. Instead, my friend and I split a plethora of snacks and appetizers. All of the food was very tasty. I had the mussels, tuna tartare, and the fries with curry. All are highly recommended. This place also has an impressive selection of beer, as well as plenty of interesting martinis to choose from. Unfortunately, the prices for drinks were not exactly reasonable.There were lots of handsome professionals here for both lunch and dinner. Too bad they all had wedding rings on and/or are probably assholes. But that won't keep me from adding this to my list of regular happy hour places!"
"After a couple of internet searches for the best fish and chips, my mom and I found this place, which is about 5 blocks from my apartment. We made a reservation online about 30 minutes ahead, but didn't need it. They weren't that busy since it was the Tuesday after Memorial Day. Server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. We had a scotch egg to start, which was amazing. They make the sausage in house. The fish and chips were good, but not the best ever. In all fairness, I have a really high standard for fish and chips. I had the sea scallops, and those were the best ever! Hands down. No contest. I would go back just to eat those again. The coffee is also worth mentioning. The have their own blend roasted by La Colombe. The server wrote down the place so we could go check it out on our own. I thought the prices were a bit high for the type of food, but that is what you get on Michigan Ave across from the Art Institute. Overall, worth checking out, but no need to place on a ""must"" list."
"Excellent lunch yesterday at The Gage after a trip to the Art Institute. The service was very good - these people know what they are doing. Excellent cocktails and wine. The food was really quite superb. We had the turkey on baguette (which sounds really, really dull but was not) and the pasta of the day. So fresh and so incredibly good. Looking forward to dinner there soon."
"This review is only for lunch as I have not eaten brunch or dinner there.  The lunch was great.  The crowd was very lively and a mix of tourist and business people.  The space is great, long bar in the front and a side room.  I had the Gage Burger and it was fantastic.  Since this was the first time there for both of us we did have some questions and I felt the server was very professional and gave great suggestions.  I will certainly be back and would bring clients there as well."
I love this place.  It is one of my favorite places in all Chicago to eat. The food is uniquely simple and excellent.
"i've been meaning to update my review for a while now.   the Gage has always been one of my favorites, and they've gotten better and better over time.  the menu changes frequently, and there always seems to be something new and interesting to try.  pretty much everything on the menu is done well.   i still think this is one of the best restaurants in the area.  don't forget to try the whiskey tasting."
"This is a place I enjoy mainly because of the experience of eating at the bar. The few times I have sat at a table, the wait staff seemed rather inexperienced. The bartenders seem to know more about the food than the waiters... Only once did I feel it was up to par and I was there with a large group, so whenever I go with my wife, we opt for the bar.The bartenders seem to really be into the food there and they are extremely attentive. We have ordered almost everything on the menu. The Elk is fantastic, so is the Caramelized Lobster with quinoa, however I have ordered the Rib-Eye twice and both times it was over-cooked. The Duck Leg confit and the the oyster appetizer are also up there.Awesome selection of spirits. Parking is difficult due to the location. Great view of the Millennium Park fountains and Bean, especially if sitting outside in the summer."
"My 5 star rating is reserved for only extremely special restaurants/experiences, and therefore the Gage gets it!Came here a couple years ago for a quick lunch with a friend as I was passing through Chicago on a flight out of O'Hare.Love the pub atmosphere at this tremendously well-located place; the dark wood, whiskey bottles galore...Nice!My friend and I ordered lunch, a beer, and split dessert and coffee; I had a roast chicken salad that was fresh and well prepared.Between our entree and desert courses as our server was clearing our plates, a tiny bug appeared on the table, which I swiftly flicked away and said ""oops! get out bug!"".  My friend and I could not have cared less about it; it was small and not even close to our food.  We hadn't seen each other in years so had a lot of catching up to do, blah blah, we didn't even really pay attention to it.  At the end of the meal, the manager appeared and informed us they would be picking up the tab for our lunch, due to the ""insect inconvenience"".  I have NEVER been so surprised in my life.  The server must have seen me flick the bug away, but we never even complained because it didn't matter...Talk about paying attention to your customers!  My friend and I felt like we were royalty for a day.  Seriously?  That was not necessary at all, but as I was about to embark on a vacation and spend stupid money elsewhere, it was appreciated immensely.Well done, Gage!I hope to hit this place up for a little happy hour action the next time I make my way to the Windy City."
"We had a very nice evening at The Gage, with only a few minor problems. The food was excellent, and the waiter's recommendations were spot on. We started with braised Swan Creek goat which was incredibly rich and delicious. It was a perfect winter dish and the flavor sticks with me more than anything else we had that evening. Our second course was the tartare of bison. I am a huge tartare fan, so this is always a pleasure to see on the menu. It was among the best that I have had (although it cannot compare to the antelope tartare at East Side Showroom, in Austin Texas). The capers were a lovely addition to the dish. For out main entrées we ordered the Indiana duck leg confit and roasted breast, and the Gunthorp Farm's pork chop. The duck leg was perfect, but the breast was undercooked. The problem with duck is that it is either done right or wrong, there is no middle ground. Everything else about the dish was perfect, especially the celery root puree! The pork chop was among the best pork dishes I have ever eaten. It was cooked perfectly, and the meat quality was far above expectation. I will dream about this pork chop. The service was okay. Our waiter was very personable and knew the menu very well. The only problem is that he was so busy that we did not receive the kind of attention that one expects. We waited a long time before we were able to put in our drink order, waited even longer to order our first course, and could have taken a nap in the time it took to get out main course. It wasn't a huge problem, but it did put us off a bit. The noise level in the restaurant was high, and the tables are extremely tight. We don't mind this too much, but some people will. Overall a fantastic dinner at a very nice restaurant."
"love the atmosphere and service here. really cozy seating and dim lights, very romantic, cocktails were great. their burger is awesome!"
"The decor and location can't be beat, and the majority of their menu is small plates, so this would probably be more ideal for happy hour or a big group. I went for dinner during restaurant week and was able to sample the restaurant's version of their best foot forward. Food was just ok, portion size a little small (in comparison to other places visited during restaurant week), and overall slightly pretentious. I'll go back, but it might not be a first choice."
"While the atmosphere is pretty cool and very Irish, the menu is confusing.  I had to get our waitress to explain every single thing to me, and even when I ordered, I was still unsure... until I tasted it.  Very yummy!Really expensive, if you ask me.  I went with 4 friends and our bill cleared $250.  If you try nothing else there, try the fondue."
"NASTY!!!!!All these great reviews and our experience awful.  First, our server was ready to take our drink order even before we sat down, then he was gone for fifteen minutes and came back without our drinks.We ordered our meal and got very uneven results.We had an order of mussels that were bad.  Tasted bad and came back the next day to show us both just how bad they were.  I had fish and chips that came to our table cold to the touch and swimming in oil.    when I complained, the waited shrugged, took my plate and came back in five minutes with the same plate after microwaving it.  Same everything.  Disgusting.....My date had a burger that was very undercooked and had to be sent back.  When we complined to the manager, he gave a standard ""I'm sorry"" but did nothing about it.  More of a cold ""So what"" feel to it than anything.Was truly a horrible experience.  Save your time and money and go someplace....anyplace....else."
"Good food, just not extraordinary. For that, go next door."
"Hi - just uploaded a bunch of photos. I agree with the other reviewers that the prices are a bit high, even though the place is located on Michigan avenue. Maybe we aren't ready for the gastropub craze. I look at this place as a bar with food and not as a place to eat with a vast drink selection. I've been there twice, and both times the service was fantastic and I felt like a valued customer - so thumbs up. The food was decent and somewhat interesting, but maybe not interesting enough for the prices."
"Went to the Gage after Jazz at the Pritzker perfect location right across the street.  We had a reservation and sat outside facing the beautiful park.  The owner came over to make suggestions and was very nice as was all of the staff.  All of our meals were delicious, the service and ambiance great.  I lovely evening."
"Food has been anywhere from good to very good, and our waiter seemed to know a lot about Willamette Valley Pinot noir, our favorite. The decor is comfortable and clean, dark (comfortably so). To start we were advised against the oysters, but the mussels in vindaloo sauce is great, and the haddock cake is totally good! (unexpected by me). caveat: Walk quickly from the entrance to the back room if possible, to avoid being surrounded by the loudmouthing and clumsy macking of Michigan Avenue suits."
"I went to the Gage for dinner on Saturday night and really enjoyed it!The good:The bread was really delicious--simple, but good.  We also really enjoyed the crisp potato salad!  The cheese and potatoes went well together and the greens were really fresh.  We had the mussels vindaloo and I found them a little too sweet, though my husband enjoyed them.  For our entree, I had the slow-braised lamb, which was delicious!  My husband had the locally made sausages with the brie potatoes, which was quite tasty.  For dessert, we shared the sweet potato cheesecake, which was really quite tasty, though a bit small.The bad:The service.  Our server was not very efficient, and did not give us much information on the menu.  Once we started asking questions, he did open up more, but he was definitely not the type of server you would expect from somewhere that charges $32 for pork chops."
"They call this place a gastropub and let me tell you, it is more gastro than pub. It was a lot fancier than I expected with the nice table linens and set-up and the gourmet menu. So much of the menu looked delicious-really, more like an upscale restaurant selection. I opted for something simple and something pub-like: the fish and chips. It was a ton of fried food! 3 huge pieces of fish and a ton of fries! The fish was fresh and the fries were decent. My friend got the Gage burger which was HUGE and juicy! Really, the portions are large but when you are paying over $15 for ""pub"" food, you probably expect them to be. And, everything else on the menu was even more pricey. (Entrees more along the line of $20-$30)  I would go back to try some of the more gourmet dishes once I have a little more $ to spare!The funny thing about this place is it is right across from Millennium Park so you get a lot of tourists coming in who are dressed very casually. (Good thing, b/c we were, too!) But really, I think it is trying to be more of an upscale place with their price points and with the chef really focusing on combining interesting dishes and flavors and using high-quality ingredients. Side note: This would make a great place for a Yelp event, as there is a nice private room downstairs!"
"I suggested this restaurant for myself and a few colleagues to dine at after a conference. I was right around St Patrick's day, so I was looking for a place that was authentic, but also classy....no drunk green beer wielding frat boys here! It was just what I was looking for. Interesting selection, nice staff, and a great atmosphere."
"I've only been here for cocktails with my husband, but the swankness will bring me back for dinner soon for sure."
"I wanted to like this place. I wanted to give it four stars, but the ridiculously slow service at 3pm on a Saturday when the restaurant was barely half full definitely left a sour taste. Then there was the waitress not looking at our credit card slips and telling my group that we still owed 5 times what we actually still owed. That was the proverbial straw. Too bad, because the burger was awesome. :-/"
"I really enjoyed this restaurant, I see that many expected it to be a pub like atmosphere, Make sure you know ahead of time that you're venturing into a business casual restaurant that could very well be out of your price range, but if you go in knowing and accepting the reality of it all, you'll probably find your experience much different and better than those who did not.I've been here on two occasions, one business and another with my boyfriend on a Saturday at noon. (I enjoyed my first time so much, that I went the second time to share the experience with my boyfriend. I took care of the bill.)First thing of note, the service. Our waiter was everything you could imagine you'd want in a waiter. He was friendly, knew the menu and the dishes like the back of his hand. Offered us mimosas, although we weren't drinking that afternoon. He was attentive, made conversation without intruding or becoming annoying. He had a magnetic personality and watched him with the other tables around us, He made jokes and talked with the tourists helping to answer any questions they had about the menu, the drinks, the CTA, you name it. I am so sad I didn't get his name, But he got an amazing tip.the food is excellent. Both times I went I was incredibly pleased with my order and both times, the portions were rather large, My boyfriend ordered the Gage burger and could only eat half, came with fries. They have a beautiful bar, the interiors are very nice, dark stained wood, glass or ceramic tiles. I love the division of space, we were sitting in a rather private area. It's incredibly crowded due to its location, but the space handles sound really well, I was able to have a nice lunch that day without having to strain my voice. I recommend it to anyone that can afford it, the location is great also, there is much to see in the area before or after eating."
"I want to love the Gage. I really truly do. Its within blocks from my condo, its got a nice atmosphere, and a very inviting menu. I've gone for brunch, lunch, and dinner, and unfortunately the only thing I truly enjoy time after time is the brunch lox platter - the presentation is wonderful and the pastrami lox is always delicious. As a native NYer I'm most picky about my bagels which in Chicago are pretty bad - the Gage's bagels fit that bad bill as well but the rest of the platter makes up for it. I've switched it up and had the eggs benedict as well, which is my usual go to brunch meal, but they use British style bacon, not the traditional canadian bacon associated with EB and while I'm always open to inventive spins on classic dishes, this misses the mark. As for dinner, I remain underwhelmed. I cant even recall what I ordered the two times I have been for dinner, but I do recall leaving less than impressed. They do have a phenomenal spicy chicken sandwich which is perfect for lunch.As for the restaurant itself - I like that its never too crowded and seating is generally readily available, both inside and out for nice summer days. The service (in general) is REALLY slow - and for meals like brunch and lunch, its generally key to have an accessible server who is attentive throughout the meal and available with the bill when its time to leave. More often than not, I've sat with an empty plate in front of me for what seems like an eternity waiting to pay and leave.The other quip - and although this might seem trivial is their soda. I'm not a big soda drinker, especially with meals, but my fiance LOVES her diet coke. The Gage seems to only use soda from the bar gun which is consistently FLAT. While they do have a nice, extensive bar, the focus is the restaurant and their beverages should be ""drinkable"". It always seems to taste like what you'd get mixed with Jack Daniels at 3:45 am at a dive bar. Disgusting.I'm giving three stars for their brunch, seating availability, and proximity to where I live. I wouldnt however go out of my way to dine here and am confident they could do just about everything a bit better with minimal change."
"I've been to The Gage a few times. I live in the area and after coming here a few times with friends during the summer I popped in solo on a cold Sunday to have a drink and warm up. It quickly became a occasional Sunday tradition for me. Nice bartenders, a well made old-fashioned (although, on occasion one of the female bartenders tops off the drink with soda, and totally ruins it), and those AMAZING mussels. Bliss. A few weekends ago after attending the Prop 8 rally downtown I went to the Gage with a friend to have lunch. Our waiter seemed to really not give a crap about our table. We were left alone on many occasions for long stretches. The only time the waiter saw fit to give our table attention was when he addressed me by my last name (which he had gleaned from my credit card), asked if I was married, and then hit on me in front of my friend. It was very uncomfortable and not the kind of thing I expect from a restaurant like The Gage. I admit to being a bit conservative (socially, not politically!) but I thought it was totally out of line. But I've been called a little uptight before so I let it go. This past Saturday while shopping with my mother she suggested we go to The Gage since I'm always raving about it. I didn't think a thing of it until we got the same waiter. The waiter who proceeded to stand a little too close whenever he came over, and then again tried to hit on me by asking if he knew me from somewhere. Through the course of the meal my mother, who knew nothing of my previous experience, noticed that he would be standing near the bar, staring at the table. I could not enjoy my food and ended the meal as soon as possible. I was with my mother for chrissakes! If I rate the Gage solely on my summer and solo experiences I would give it five stars. The mussels are amazing, the fish and chips are absolutely yummy. The brisket sandwich is flavorful and tender. The caramel creme brulee with black pepper biscotti is absolutely AMAZING. I'm still dreaming about it. My friend raved about the peanut butter beignets. I probably would have enjoyed my eggs benedict (with those YUMMY mashers)  more had I not been made so uncomfortable. The bartenders are all super nice and friendly, especially to a girl dining alone on a chilly sunday. Overall I think the Gage is a quality restaurant/bar/gastropub/whatever, but I can't say I'll be returning any time soon."
"Read reviews and had concierge recommendations...wasn't impressed.  Had the braised short rib sandwich special and it was very bland.  Fries were good, service was excellent but calories are too precious to spend on bad food."
"I went here for lunch with a friend during the work week, and it was a good experience.  The staff was friendly, gave great suggestions and was quick to refill water, wrap up food and bring the check.  If it makes it seem like I was rushed, I wasn't.  I just appreciate lunch places that are aware of the fact that you have to get back to ""work"" and are quick.It's great comfort food and worth the visit."
"Love The Gage! Great for lunch, packed for dinner which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars but food was fantastic.   Pulled pork sandwich was delicious."
"We went here with a big group of friends old friends hoping to catch up.  Unfortunately they sat us at a long table, instead of one of the nice circular ones on the side, so talking was quite difficult.The interior was nice and the service was very good.Food was mixed.  I'm cheap and so I got the fish and chips.  Really, nothing to write home about.  My boyfriend got the roasted red pepper soup special (amazing!!!), and scallops (okay)."
Enjoyed lunch at the bar on a very cold day. Staff was friendly and accommodating though I arrived too early. Craft sausage and excellent beer. Excellent place to eat for a sightseer who doesn't want to eat like a tourist.
"Went for quiet lunch with friend and briefly: yummy scallops, few vegetarian options- only 1 vegetarian option for my friend! Dessert was lovely. Great ambience."
"Long overdue review for the Gage. I came with a large group some time ago. Some of us waited at the bar while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.  The drinks were perfect. The staff was friendly.  We were later seated towards the back.  Everyone enjoyed their food. I ordered the Gage burger which was delicious and perfectly cooked.  The desserts were outstanding. Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing.My only complaint is that the bathroom is downstairs and it gets a bit hairy having to use stairs after a few drinks.  The downstairs is very nice, however."
"This is a really good spot with tasty food and really good service.  I've never been disappointed in either.  I came in with a large group (10)  the other day for lunch and we were treated very well and served fairly quickly.  The place is a little bit dark, but I guess it adds to the ambiance.  The servers seem knowledgeable about the different menu items, which I appreciate.There's a private room downstairs, though we looked into having a party here and it was pretty expensive.Definitely make reservations if you're coming at a busy time of day, especially if you have more than a couple of people."
Old school drinks - yes please! Bartender knew his stuff and gave great recommendations. Even kept out water glasses full when we moved to our third round of drinks. Didn't try the food but looked pretty good. Definitely want to try this place out again.
"*********Update 11-27-07***********$6 for a Harp.  And during happy hour.  On a Monday.  Maybe they offer specials on weeknights, but I didn't see any.  And I may be willing to pay more for Guiness, but not Harp.  Stick to the wine or martini list for after work drinks--beer is not worth the price.  Even Miller Lite is expensive at $5.Still like this place, but would take off a 1/2 star if I could.**************************************Mmm, chips with curry dipping sauce!  I can still taste it.....The green tile and dark wood are comfy feeling--like a cross between a bath house and an old-school D.C. bar.  Plenty of seating--and even a separate room downstairs for private parties or busy nights.Drinks and food are pricey but the service matches them both--attentive hosts, waiters and bussers all around.  Plus, they have Bisol Jeio prosecco--my 2007 summertime fave!"
"Probably the best fish and chips I've had to date.  Started off with an heirloom tomato tart that was one tomato core away from perfection, easily over looked by a pie-crust enthusiast like myself.  My grandmother has made pies for a living for a good portion of her life and still cannot do a pie crust this good - nice work.  Also noteworthy was the scotch egg - the first I've had that actually desirable to eat, let alone delicious.  Dessert was an apple fritter with cider reduction and ale ice cream; a perfect way to spend a fall evening on Michigan Avenue."
"I've been dying to try this place and since my friend from the O.C. came in today, what better way to celebrate!?The hostesses ignored us a bit when we walked in.  It seemed like they were just chatting, while we're standing there waiting, with no one in front of us, to get a table.   But, once they acknowledged us, they couldn't be nicer.The service was great.  We were well informed about the menu and the specials. I heard fantastic things about the mussels in vindaloo sauce and it did NOT disappoint.  YUM-MEE.  We also enjoyed the caramelized  lobster, quite tasty.For our Fourths (yes, there are firsts, seconds and thirds as well) we had the char (some kind of fish) and the beef tenderloin.  Both delicious.Overall, this was a great place.  I'd go back for the starters (first, seconds and thirds) but I think the fourths were just a bit much.  I think the menu is trying too hard to be something more.  And it's more spendy than I like to spend for a local ""pub"" or ""grill"" type atmosphere.The place was pretty noisy, so I was disappointed by that.  We had to yell a bit to talk to each other.  I do apologize to my fellow diners, I'm sure I wasn't talking about anything dinner table appropriate.   The interior is absolutely gorgeous and it has a done of seating!  The downstairs bar area is fantastic for a party.  I will totally recommend for next year's holiday party!I really enjoyed the place, overall."
"Location - Right across from Millenium Park.  Nice little patio area to sit outside and people watch.Reservations - Not sure if they take or if it is needed. We came for lunch during a weekday so it was dead.Ambiance - Nice long dark bar, lots of natural light, clean, dark wood. Service - Top notch.  Our server was super friendly and helpful.  First time there so she was great at giving us recommendations. Also, since we were new in town, she helped us find some restaurants that were Chicago based and not chains. Food - Bland1. House Bread  with Unsalted Butter - Arrived warm.  Hard crust, wheat looking middle which was soft but had no taste. 2. Seared Sea Scallop Salad - Came recommended.  Very light and refreshing dish.  Simple.  Three or four scallops which was seared well and moist, on top of butter lettuce and vinegar red onions.  I love butter lettuce and these were crisp.  The vinegar took the bite out of the red onions. Lemon vinaigrette was a bit bland alone but worked well with this salad. 3. Slow Roasted Gunthorp Farms Peppered Pork Belly Sandwich-  Came recommended. Tons of pork belly meat which was super moist.  Too bad the meat wasn't caramelized to provide some flavor.  Fried egg really did nothing for the sandwich. Also, I didn't really taste the onions or the mustard aioli.   One of those dishes that was missing a key ingredient although I couldn't figure out what."
Very expensive for the quality. I paid $32 for a pork chop.  A pork chop that I cannot say was the best I ever had.  Also it gets very loud as others have noted.  Just beware of what you order. It may cost you!
"Eh, it's ok. A little crowded, a little noisy, and the food is only ok. Nothing i'd go out of my way for. Just overall kinda mediocre. /shrug"
"I had an Irish Breakfast, complete with bangers and a Guinness.  This place has great a atmosphere and the service was excellent.  Good place for lunch and to meet casual friends.   I love the dark style of the bar.  A little bit touristy though."
"I really liked this place! A few of us had dinner there last night and I was very happy with everything I tried.They were sold out of our wine but ex planed it is sold out nation wide so I will forgive them.I split the lobster salad, which is Caramelized Lobster, Lemon Quinoa and basil. It was very good! For dinner I had fish and chips. It rocked. I would really recommend it! My table also ordered the surf and turf which is Sea Bream & Oxtail, Toast and Pesto, also quite good; and the seared Tuna. Any of which would be a good choice.We also had dessert- try the chocolate cake!This place has a good energy and I appreciate the style and theme. Try it!"
"We had a terrific experience at Gage last night primarily because of fantastic service.We made a reservation at around 8pm for an 8:45 table. We arrived, the table was still occupied and was told it would be a few minutes. After a few minutes pass, the manager comes over, apologizes profusely, and asks if he can get us a round of drinks on the house while we wait. Um, sure! The wait had hardly been an issue, but his immediate offer to get us drinks was both unexpected and appreciated. As we're drinking our gratis cocktails, we look around, recognize that most people are in suits, tuxedos or nice dresses. We are dressy, but definitely in jeans - and about 20 years younger than the average midori sour sipping clientele.  This again is where the service at Gage stands out - many other places would have snubbed their nose at a group of younger, underdressed clients.  As we finish our drinks, the manager escorts us to the table, letting us know that he's already ordered appetizers for us, which should be arriving shortly.  Again - more stars in my book for making us feel appreciated.The food throughout was really terrific. The mushroom toast with a poached egg was out of this world. My quinoa lobster dish was some of the best quinoa I've ever had. Fiance was singing praises about the homemade sausages.  Our wines were terrific and interesting. All in all, a really enjoyable meal, and a great spot to return to in Millennium Park."
"I think this is a welcome addition to the Millennium Park scene.  We went for an office lunch and every one enjoyed their food.  For a cute touch, my fish and chips were served in a newspaper cone, just like the ones I got in Dublin, so at the very least it made me feel that I was authentically a tourist at a pub in Dublin.  Oh, and they were good, too.The interior decor is very nice, all dark woods and subway tile.  At lunch, there was a rumble of conversation but my table mates and I could talk and be heard comfortably.  And our server was excellent.It's pricey for lunch, but in line with what you would pay for similarly nice spots in the area, like the Park Grill.  Probably not an everyday place, but it made a nice treat."
"Perhaps I ordered badly, but my crispy rabbit salad was disappointing. A few shreds of rabbit under a pile of Arugula was pretty much the dish. My husband said his fish and chips was fine, but nothing to write home about. Maybe just not out kind of restaurant. Points for good service."
"Went there for lunch with a friend and were seated right away.  Unfortunately, it took about 15 minutes for anyone to come by to take our drink order.  Both of us had the cup of soup and 1/2 sandwich.  First time I tried chilled watermelon soup and it was delicious.  Unfortunately, the guy who dropped off the food threw it down and disappeared without a word.  We didn't get any soup spoons so I had to flag someone down to get some.  The 1/2 sandiwch was OK, nothing earth-shaking.  For dessert we split a sour cherry pie-looking thing with Sichuan peppercorn ice cream.  It was good but the ice cream tasted like vanilla.  The bill was $42 for 2 cups of soup 2 half sandwiches and one piece of cherry pie ala mode?  I don't mind spending money but I hate wasting it.  Oh, the tables are sooooo close together you can't help but to be involved in everyone else's conversations.  I didn't mind that but I did mind the open-mouthed, smacking chewer and belcher sitting next to me."
"This place has a great personality.  It's classy, has great food for dinner if that's what you are looking for.  I've only visited there as a bar stop.  Our waitress what receptive to the fact that my friend was pregnant and seeked de-caffinated hot tea, and did not scoff.  She wanted to go out to bar/restaurants because she sees that she may not have time in the near future to experience such situations!"
"I can't stop raving about this restaurant!  1. I love Dirk Flannigan's food, I have for years.  2. I thought the decor was fantastic - clean & simple yet clearly a little more upscale than your typical bar or grill type restaurant.  3. Service & the management were great.Last Saturday the plan was to head down to the Art Institute for the Edward Hopper exhibit, however, upon arrival, we realized the line was far too long (and filled with children) so we decided to have an extended lunch at The Gage.  My date had previously been and couldn't stop raving about it so I too had to try.  Immediately upon entering I liked the feel of the place - kind of like Hugo's on Rush Street or Quartino with the tile and the heavy, dark wood but newer, a foreign feel and more unique color choices.  I liked the big European bar area in the front and I really liked the open kitchen in the back.  I was not impressed with the private dining space - particularly because I hate subterranean spaces. We sat down and our large, white male server - reminiscent of the Pillsbury dough boy meets California surfer meets 2nd generation Polish kid from the near north side suburbs - greeted us with a friendly approach just barely too personal.  He was a lunch time server, so maybe not as senior as the evening servers OR perhaps he was just a little hung over on this Saturday afternoon and I was also being very friendly so he probably followed suit.      Whatever it was, we ended up liking him. I ordered a giant, fancy beer, my date ordered gin on the rocks along with The Scottish Egg and the delicious french fries and elk dish in a rich, goupy sauce.  Everything was yummy and hearty which was great on that particular rainy day.  at one point our busser was about to refill my glass of water just at the same time I was about to put my giant beer in the giant goblet down after taking a sip.  Some how, the pitcher that the busser was holding SMASHED into my beer goblet!  I was in a brief shock until I found myself soaking wet - beer was all over me.  I realized that my hand was holding the beer goblet and I fearfully looked down at my hand - IT WAS SAFE!  not a single cut.  The server, the management, everyone handled it so well.  Immediately got us a new table, a new beverage and they comped our appetizers!  The manager came and sat with us, they were fantastic at handling the calamity. Back to the food!  I had the salmon, it was a lunch special and it was awesome!  I usually don't even like salmon but our nice, over sized server convinced me to order the salmon (after some prodding).  My fearless companion ordered the rib eye sandwich, he was disappointed but I just think it was a bad choice on his part.  We also had a side of the spaghetti squash with goat cheese which we both enjoyed.  We ordered dessert, split one dessert, I cannot remember what it was but I know my date liked it more than I did. I recall they had nice wines by the glass, a great beer list and once again, I loved the open kitchen with the chef expediting.  There were so many other things on the menu I wanted to try so I will most certainly be back!!"
"""the gage"" burger & amazing selection of whiskey's make the extra $ worth spending here"
"I know this place doesn't need anymore reviews but what the hell.  Came here for after work drinks on a Friday at 5.  It was already pretty packed so we were seated in the basement.  The wine list is pretty sad, there's not a ton to choose from.  We ordered the fondue which is more like melted brie in a dish but it was still pretty tasty.  After another bottle of wine we went with the fries and vindaloo...YUM! I  would never think to pair french fries with vindaloo but I was a fan.  I'd love to go back and test out the fish and chips...I saw them go by and they looked good.  I thought this place was a great after work spot as long as you get there as close to 5 as possible."
"I think I left about $4 of my Gage cocktail (Grey Goose Poire, apple cider, Aperol) in the glass because we were rushing.  I'm very bummed about that.  It was yummy.  And $12.  Many other items on the menu (both drink and food) looked tempting...I wonder if I can convince mom to take me back there this week."
"Whenever I would come to the Gage with my girlfriend, the waiters would politely ignore us feeling each other up under the table, even long after we'd finished our food.But then I sat at the bar by myself, and the bartender ignored me, and I wasn't feeling myself up under the counter; so now I wonder if the waiters are just too busy to be bothered. Hmm.Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA on tap was a treat, and my rabbit salad today was very good; but paying $12 for pureed Brussels sprouts made me feel silly."
"Very noisy!  Bagpipe indoors, seriously?!  The food wasn't good, and the hostess was quite rude."
"Went here after the St. Pat's day parade and it was great! House burger was HUGE and delicious! Beer and drinks were high priced, and they didn't have any specials on a holiday weekend which I thought was odd. They have a ton of space and seems like a great  spot for groups! Atmosphere is nice, really an anything goes kind of feel."
"You go here for a pre-symphony dinner. And for what it is, it is pretty nice. They employ a repetition of ingredients. For example, the halibut was served  on a bed of asparagus and topped with an asparagus puree cream sauce. The halibut was light and flaky, although two servings would have made a nice meal. This place actually had a pretty thriving thirty something happy hour scene. A few fancy cocktails. I must admit the old fashioned was pretty good. I need to make it back here to chat up a few honeys."
This place was described to me as an upscale English Pub so I was expecting traditional pub fare.  I was so confused!  I was a little diappointed in my salad - for $9 I got a handful of greens and like 3 little pieces of goat cheese.  The brie baked potato was delicious though.My friend was not that impressed with her $17 fish and chips either.
"I had a great experience at The Gage.  I happened to be with my family after a work night, and the manager came by and moved us to a quiter place away from the loud after work crowd.  Of course, this should be standard policy, but I've very rarely had management notice details like that.  I honestly think our sever was tweaking out on something because he couldn't seem to focus on anything, but I'm going to ignore that because the management was so good.  The owner came by afterwards and asked us for our opinion (which is a very good idea for a new place).  I was surprised how smoothly things were going for such a new place.  It can only get better, but it was already at a very high level for a new place I had to give them 5 stars.Food was a classy version on standard and not so standard Irish bar food.  I found they put a little flare on each dish to make it stand out from the norm.  It's pricey but it's nice to have some good food inside (ok, just outside) the loop.  There are so few nice places around there for after work that you can go to in a suit.  I hope they become a mainstay in Chicago for a long long time."
"Great menu - there's a whole section for seasonal foods and drinks, but the regular menu is sparkling as well. The real appeal is the variety - you can have a delicious meal that's heavy or light, cheap or expensive, meaty or vegetarian, large or small.  Highly recommended all around.Sat at a bar table, great atmosphere, and on top of that, the wait staff is friendly, helpful and aesthetically pleasing to boot."
"A small caveat to this review is I was there on St. Patty's day.  However I still think just about everything applies.  For an area of town like the loop where decent bars are hard to come by this is one I'll definitely be back to.  Huge space with a bar upstairs and down stairs, and even on st. patty's day wasn't too crowded.  They had a rabbit sausage special with pork bellys, it was off the charts delicious.  Something very unique and really tasty.  The drinks and food were pricey, probably a little too pricey, but it's what I expected from the neighborhood.  Service was good, overall an enjoyable experience."
"So props to the Gage for bringing me back to Yelp for my newfound food adventures here in Chicago. Unfortunately for them, it's so I can spread how truly bad I thought it was.Let's dive right in. First course we went for the Fondue after seeing some positive reviews here for it. Let me say that I was, right off the bat, throughly unimpressed. Other than the cheese, the only other thing on the plate is 3 very long pieces of toast. Chef's prerogative here, but this hardly seemed like the delicate accompaniment for the brie and it left us feeling bloated and carb heavy, especially after the complimentary sourdough. As for the fondue itself, just not an impressive dish - flavor profile similar to movie theater popcorn, and that's not a good thing.Moving on to the seasonal option, a chilled corn soup. It comes out looking quite beautiful, a number of toppings on top of a mild yellow broth. Unfortunately, despite the presentation, the entire bowl had a singular bland taste with none of the multiple ingredients adding any flavor. Friend got the lobster and while it actually had taste, it was eh at best. So right around this time, despite being rather unimpressed with the kitchen's showing, we do opt to have another beverage. Unfortunately, this was around the time our waitress went MIA for the next 20 minutes of the meal. To her credit (I guess), when she did reappear, after the plate of soup has been sitting untouched for that long, she bothers to ask if I enjoyed it and when I disclose otherwise, she removes it from the bill.So..things are on the upswing...right? Cue another 15 minute waitress disappearance (with drinks still missing) interrupted by the kitchen sending out a busboy with our meal. This consisted of:Fish and Chips - jeez. just not good. ridiculously greasy and the batter's nothing special at all. Fries were an eyebrow raiser due to an alright seasoning, but not worth the price of admission.Gilt ""Get the Burger"" Burger - alright. average. maybe in a smaller city, this would be the talk of the town, but chicago's got some damn good burgers...no hate, well executed, just not nearly enough to save this place. brioche bun was good, tomatoes were nice and fresh. Tomato and Parmigiano Gratin - tastes like can of tomatoes, an indetectable reggiano and a pathetic garnish of breadcrumbs. This lackluster dish was bothersome itself, but it's particularly annoying because I asked the waitress explicitly when ordering if it was good and she insisted it was great. Either she hasn't tried it or she particularly enjoys canned tomatoes.Soon after our food arrives, MIA Waitress comes back and as she does, I think she overhears me complaining to my companion about her spotty service. She then annoyingly circles the table for a while, which, because we were the only ones in the room at this point, was quite obvious. Then, in a quite impressive feat, manages to not be around when we finish our meal and want the check.Ugh. the location may be good, the drinks might be okay (one more round might have been in the cards were the service better) but the wait staff was not and the food was downright bad, not to mention for the price."
"The Gage is a nice place, it seemed touristy though.Our waitress was nice but it sure took a LONG time for her to bring out our food!She could have at least bought over a few more baskets of rolls if it was going to take that long.I had the scallops, they were really good. The brie potato side  and french firies were good as well. The gage burger was good."
"I've only been here once, but I had the best burger of my life here.  I highly recommend The Gage Burger to everyone who doesn't want to bother eating food that people hunt for sport that pervades the menu there.  A burger with camembert cheese.  Need I say more.  The service was excellent.  Attentive but not overbearing and he was well versed on the menu and specials.  The location is great too.  Saves people in the know from eating at the crappy Bennigan's down the street.  They also have a good wine and beer selection.  I wasn't too impressed with the berry tart dessert we had, but the excellent burger more than made up for it.  I'm definitely going back!"
"Excellent!  Definitely will visit again.  The atmosphere is lively and energetic.  We sat inside, but in a very comfortable booth.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Our server provided recommendations, and they were outstanding!  I enjoyed one of their custom gin cocktails and the dining special.  My husband enjoyed the fish and chips (but, trust me, it is no ordinary fish and chips ... highly recommended!).  A foodie paradise in the heart of all the activity in the Loop."
"I ended up here on an ill fated attempt at going to the campus bookstore in pouring (January) rain and inevitably found myself at the bar. It happens a lot that way. I had class (next door) and stuck to water (sheds tear) and sat by my lonesome at the very nice, smooth bar. The architecture and decor was great, nice tiling, painted tin ceilings and not to aggressive sports shows (on mute, thank you) up in the corners. Had the basic salad, which is my one true tests of how the rest of the food will add up. Tasty bread an butter. Another weakness. Not so fond of the pricing for the portion. A $9 salad that wasn't necessarily eye appealing or significant, but good, but kind of small. I saw other portions and they also looked on the small sidebut maybe their rich gastro-pub-whathaveyou goodness would make up for that. I'll give it a shot again for drinks, or if someone wants to buy me $40 worth of Irish food."
"Had the crispy pork belly & the hubby had the brisket for lunch. So hard to choose, many tempting dishes on the menu. Asked the waiter for a red wine glass recommendation & the Lou was an excellent choice. Rolled out of there pleasantly satiated & wondering if we can make it back before we leave town for the fish & chips!"
"I owe The Gage an apology.I happened upon it in May 2007, shortly after it had opened. Had the roast  chicken, wasn't impressed, and said so. I also said I'd never go back, unless someone else was footing the bill.Well, ""never"" is a strong word, one that, once used, usually requires revision. In this case, to ""as often as is feasible.""The revised Gage review:I revisited The Gage recently with a friend who'd come to town for the weekend. We stopped in for drinks early on a Friday evening, and, intrigued by the menu and enamored of the Ginger Fizz and Belle de Brillet cocktails, decided to return the following day for lunch.I'll gloss over the niceties of interior decor: dark, shiny, well-appointed without being stuffy in the least. Now. Lunch. Repeat Belles de Brillet (me) and a nice rose (friend). Add Scotch egg for first course.  Hard boiled egg ensconced within sausage meat, breaded and deep fried? Genius. And well-executed by the Gage, served on a bed of greens, with stone-ground mustard on the side. We followed that with the seared scallop salad and a sandwich of rib eye on ciabatta with smoked cheddar and grilled red onion. My gluten-intolerant friend loved her salad. I didn't have the heart to swipe a bite from someone already so deprived, so I had to take her word for it. Now that I've had the Gage rib-eye sandwich, I'm rather inclined to abandon all other meat/bread/cheese combinations as hopelessly inferior. (Given the breadth of my hips and the dearth of my Gage-ready funds, this is undoubtedly for the best.)We finished the meal with coffee and the chocolate torte dessert--brick of insanely rich, bittersweet chocolate ganache, balanced by a salty pub pretzel in a cloud of whipped cream and an artful (translation: more, please!) smear of stout sabayon. Friend's gluten-policing did not, alas, survive this course, and I was forced to share. Our server (Cayden, I think) was wonderful, and I believe the owner was circulating and checking diners' satisfaction, so we always felt attended to, but never rushed. It was a wonderful dining experience.And so The Gage gets another star. I've since recommended it to anyone within earshot, not that they need my word-of-mouth. By now, most of Chicago has realized it's a gem. But I feel guilty for having dismissed it so readily after my first visit. I'm reserving that fifth star for my repeat bout with the Amish chicken, though.***** (Original review below)I firmly believe you can tell the quality of a cook by their mastery of roast chicken, perhaps the simplest, yet most perfect of dishes.Can you tell by the star rating how I feel about the Amish roast chicken at The Gage? (Underseasoned, uninteresting, uninspiring.)The service is friendly and good, the pub itself is rather polished and modern, and the menu indicates the joint is trying to pull off upmarket, gastropub fare, but I wasn't at all impressed with my meal or the prices. If someone else were footing the bill, I'd go to see if the cooks were just having an off night in the kitchen the day I went. Otherwise, I won't be going again."
"Perhaps I'm the odd man out in these reviews, but I have nothing but terrible things to say about my experience here.  Except for the Scotch Egg, which was the bomb.2 weeks ago my partner and I decided to visit after reading the decent review - and seeing the very appealing picture of fish and chips - in Time Out Chicago.So we get there around 3PM on a Saturday, and immediately are impressed by the decor.  The place was not very busy, but I guess that's to be expected for a late weekend afternoon downtown when it's too cold to sit outside.  Anyway, upon being seated I ordered a Guinness, which was served with way too much head, which would be forgiveable if this were a faux-Irish bar in Wrigleyville, but I guess I expected a better pour considering the reputation of the ownership and how un-rushed the bar was.When the waiter came back to get our food order, I asked where the fish and chips was on the menu.  I was told that was only on the dinner menu.  Ah, because deep frying cod is the kind of thing that you really need to have the full kitchen staff there for...?  Anyway, we were able to order another item from the TOC review that sounded pretty appealing - the previously mentioned Scotch Egg - and then I ordered a cheeseburger, medium, while my partner ordered the steak sandwich, medium, with a side of brie potatoes.Given the prices of everything on the menu, I would say it's fair to expect a very high level of quality, otherwise, why not take yourself to the Bennigans just down the street aways?The Scotch Egg lived up to its promise -  Deep fried sausage covering a hard boiled egg and served with hot mustard?  I believe these will be in the vending machines in heaven.But then the main course arrived.  Instantly I noticed my fries were ice cold.  But given our appetizer I didn't need them anyway, so when the waiter came by I made a mention of this, but told him not to worry.Unfortunately, upon biting into my cheeseburger, I realized I should have asked the waiter to stick around a bit.  Let's start with the taste.  If you like ground beef with your peppercorn and oil patty, then I guess you would enjoy the burger.  I'm quite sure I can make a better burger at home, and I'm fairly confident the Bennigans down the street can, too, for about 1/2 the price.Secondly, of course, when I am cooking food for others I do my very best to make sure the meat is actually cooked through.  The kitchen at Gage did not seem to share this concern.When it comes to steak, I like medium rare, but when you order ground beef medium and you get a cool, raw, mushy middle... I lost my appetite.My partner was not thrilled with his sandwich either, which, while cooked thoroughly, was also extremely greasy.  And the brie potatoes seemed like they had pretty much been pre-prepared, frozen, and then nuked prior to being served.Kind of like a High Class ... Bennigans!.Again, not being the kind of person who wants to let a bad meal upset my applecart, I called the waiter over, and explained the situation.  He seemed to be very understanding and called the manager over.  They did offer to bring me something else, but at this point I politely explained I was no longer hungry and if they wanted to compensate me, it would be appreciated if they took the hamburger off the bill.  They agreed to this.However, this is where I'm pretty sure the service at Bennigans exceeds Gage.... my partner, who felt bad about my bad meal, offered to pay and grabbed the check as soon as it arrived  I asked him if I could see the check to make sure the $13 patty of peppercorn and lightly seared ground beef I was served was comped, but he handed the check and credit card were handed back to the waiter on the spot and run.  The tip was left and we left quickly, a little embarassed by the whole incident (I hate confronting waiters in situations like that and almost never send anything back, but the price was just way too high to deal with poorly prepared food).  Out on the street I asked how much the check was.  I was amazed when we realized that on top of everything else, we had NOT actually been comped, and had paid $60 w/ tip for 2 poorly cooked sandwiches, a couple of sides, and one drink.Maybe it's just me, but I've spoken casually with others who have tried this place and experienced lousy service and average food as well.  All of which makes me wonder how many ""real"" reviews there are here vs. friends and acquaintances of staff (see the review about getting drink tabs picked up).Regardless, I call this one ""OFF THE LIST!""  :)"
"I really enjoyed my experience on their sidewalk patio last night. My friend and I ordered the chips (fries) and curry gravy, which was excellent. We also had the peppered hanger steak and carmelized lobster which was also excellent. I had a great peach bellini and we left satisfied after sharing all three of our dishes.Loses a star for being a bit pricey. Also, the guy at the table next to us had his phone stolen right off the table while we were sitting there. In the same hour, a guy came right into the patio and was begging for food and money and was chased away finally by a waitress ready to call the cops. Not exactly how I want to spend an expensive meal, but this is on Michigan Ave and it was during Blues Fest."
"The Gastro Pub comes to Chicago at last. I wish I had some other GP to compare the Gage against, but alas, an attempt to eat at the Spotted Pig in West Village failed.The decor is quite nice and during dinner--since they didn't have cable yet--I got to watch ""The Searchers"". I imagine the lovely flat panels now play sports exclusively.I had the duck confit--it was adequate (the leg was not very impressive in either flavor or texture) and the huckleberry reduction an inspired touch. I'm simply not sure what makes it stand out--certainly Chicago takes center stage with innovative cookery (Alinea, Schwa), so I was expecting a bit more, at least in presentation. My hostess was quite friendly and not overbearing."
"This might not have been the right place to go after day 1 of Lollapalooza, but it's where my group chose to go.  We ordered a selection of appetizers and two entrees to split among the tables.  The Good - the scallops were melt in your mouth delicious.  Also good - the fish and chips.  However, the cheese plate and oysters were just average.  The basement is cool and has a private room which would probably be good for a private party."
"I've been twice now and I really like the Gage. It is in Touristville, where I usually am not. We went the other night, pre-theatre (Yeah Animal Crackers!) and it was a great option. It happened to be Halloween night, and all the staff were in costume. I thought this was really charming and kind of personal in a weird way. Our server was a zombie, and very nice. I feel like I need to base my review on the location, because while some of the menu items and drinks have a higher price tag than I would normally pay, I think the Gage could actually get away with charging more based on location. Because we were going to the show, we didn't want to stuff ourselves, and we certainly weren't toting leftovers. Between myself, my hubby and my folks, we had two martinis and eight beers. (Ok that's kind of a lot.) My Hendricks martini was ginormous and deeeelish. Totally worth the 13 bucks. They have a thoughtful and decently priced beer list. I didn't check out the wine too much. We had the brie fondue, the mussels in vindaloo and the fried chicken livers to start. All VERY good. I could eat three baskets of those chicken livers. So yum. We split two entrees, the roasted chicken and the special, striped bass. Both were very good, juicy, not too salty, lovely sides, and a very pretty presentation considering they took it upon themselves to actually split the plates, which we did not request but really appreciated. Oh and I almost forgot! A side of roasted squash and bacon. Awesome!The noise level is high, and the tables are a little close where we sat, but again, it is touristville. If I'm in the neighborhood and need a go-to place, this is it."
"I feel like I must have missed the charm of this place, somehow.  It's so well reviewed, but at least on the night I was there, the experience was lacking.  The Gage was insanely packed on a random Monday night at 8 PM, and brutally noisy.  The waitstaff was slammed and hardly had time to glance our way, let alone provide decent service.  I also found the beer list to be ludicrously, almost insultingly overpriced.  Seven bucks for a Negra Modelo?  Really?  Sure, the food was tasty, but the atmosphere and general experience were so wearing that I didn't really enjoy my meal.  I doubt I'll be back."
Excellent food and service.  Very delightful experience!
"Although I liked The Gage, I wouldn't make a special trip to dine there.  The Gage was a convenient meeting place near my friends' office (& Mil Park & The Art Institute).  If you're in the area and looking for a moderately upscale place to lunch or dine - then, by all means check it out.  Service was outstanding, very proper and polite - almost formal.  I only had a couple apps - a pint of shrimp and the asparagus, both good although the later had a bit too much butter."
I wanted to love it - I really did - but it just didn't deliver for me. The beers are over-priced ($4.50 for a miller lite) and the bartenders cannot manage to be polite in a crowd at all.I would still go back there because the food is great - love the oysters. Recommend avoiding the post-work rush because the bartenders cannot handle it!
"Billy Lawless strikes again!  This proprietor is one of those guys that truly cares about service and quality and this is why I will follow him anywhere.  His latest creation The Gage is a fine dining restaurant, a pub, and a social hot spot for those in the loop pun intended. The menu here is extremely creative for the adventurous and full of traditional fare for those just looking to indulge in comfort.If you work in the Loop this is a must stop for lunch or after work for a snack and a few drinks.  The downstairs lounge is for me the best.  Do yourself a favor give The Gage a try, you'll love it.Great for parties, and in an awesome location!Awesome Pint of Guinness here!"
"Great food at dinner last night and excellent, friendly, well-informed service.  The chef emphasizes locally-grown, seasonal products so the menu changes regularly.  We ordered a mix of specials and staples from the menu; each was worthy of a return visit.  Try the ""Coffee and Donuts"" for dessert. Hard to explain but worth a visit in itself.It's a lively place so ask to be seated in the back if you're planning on in-depth conversation but the energy and enthusiasm of guests and staff makes for a great evening."
"I went with some friends from work 2 weeks ago on a Friday at about 5:30 and it was already standing room only in the bar area.   One of us went up to the bar to order drinks and while he was waiting the others snagged 2 small hightop tables by the elevator after a group left.  The waitress made a show of pulling them apart and gave us a dirty look when we pushed them back together.  Even worse, when she asked us if we wanted anything and we said we had already sent someone up to the bar, she rolled her eyes and huffed away!  After that she was actually very attentive, so I guess she was just having a bad night.  However, when we had already gotten the check but were still finishing our last drink, a bus boy came over and refilled our waters, and both the waitress and manager made a beeline for him to scold him for doing so, within earshot!  The manager then came over and asked us if we needed anything else, followed by an overly emphatic, ""of course take your time, we're not trying to rush you or anything.""  If you want to feel like cattle being herded out of there and gouged on $5 miller lites, then by all means, check this place out!  Seriously though, I hope the attitude we got was just part of it being relatively new and working through service issues.  The atmosphere was pretty cool and the reviews on the food seem great though, so maybe I'll check it out again.  Also, they have a separate bar area downstairs that looks like it would be nice for a private party."
"I had the pepper salmoned club and the potato soup (with bacon and cheese). Both were delicious, though the sandwich was falling apart as I ate it! So, don't order that sandwich on a first date or business meeting. Definitely moreso on the pricey side for a lunch spot though."
"One of my good friends and I came to Gage after a watching a play at the Silk Road theatre on a Sunday night. It wasn't too busy- which was expected for sunday night, so we were able to get seated immediately. We started with the Curry Fries and the Mussels in vindaloo sauce. The appetizers were HUGE and definitely enough to be a meal, and I can't forget to mention they were really yummy. The curry fries had a nice kick to them.  Mussels were great too- and way more than enough for two people to share!I had the sausage for my entree- it was alright, don't think I'd order it again. We ended our meal with the french toast. When it came out it almost looked like a fancy rice crispy treat, but it didn't taste like it. It had a nice crunchy outside and soft/moist center- like french toast. It had just the right about of sweetness to it... I'm actually thinking about picking one of these pupppies up on my way home from work ones of these days.. Mmmmmm"
"i had heard great things about this restaurant from a co-worker and later saw it highly rated in Food & Wine so when my old schoolmates were in town for the National Restaurant Show, we gave it a try.The Blush Martini tastes wonderful and comes with tons of bubbles and fresh berries. I got the ""Regular"" Burger while my friend got ""The Gage"" Burger. I tried both and both tasted great, however, when it comes to burgers I have a more simplistic taste and didn't feel ""The Gage"" was worth $6 more than the ""Regular"" which was priced very reasonably for the menu. My other friend got the Semolina Dumplings - which she raved about. So the food and drinks were great.The service, not so much.Let me start by saying that all three of us are in the service industry and have high expectations. The menu at The Gage does not have the most common plates in general. We first had a discussion about what Semolina actually is and figured it out between us. Out of curiosity, we then asked our server, sort of as a ""test"". She failed miserably. While we were visiting (we hadn't seen each other in nearly a year!) she kept on asking if she could take our plates away when we were clearly not finished. This was highly irratating.I give this restaurant 5 stars for food and drinks but they need to order staff that take an interest in their product and guests."
"Although this place has sentimental value for me I can objectively say that I have never had a bad thing to eat here.  The mussels are outstanding as well as the burgers.  The service is always good. The crowd is quite good-looking and the decor and ambience are upscale without being shee-shee.  I would suggest that ""all the single ladies"" hang out here too.  There always seems to be about 5 well-dressed men for every woman."
"My friend and I came here for brunch and we wanted outdoor seating and the wait was 20 min (this was Sunday around 11am) so it wasn't too bad.  We just went across to Millenium Park and then by the time we came back, the table was ready.  I ordered the Apple Pancake Souffle and my friend got the eggs benedict.  I really wanted to get the strawberry stuffed french toast but it had cream cheese and I don't like cream cheese.  The souffle was pretty disappointing.  I was hoping it would taste like the dutch baby from Walker Bros but it wasn't as good.   Sad.  However, it was good.  My friend liked the eggs benedict and it looked good.  There were umbrellas covering the tables and there was a big gust of wind and one of the umbrellas fell and hit out table and almost my friend.  It was scary.  I mean don't they secure those things or what?!?  So that's why I'm only giving it 3 stars.  And the manager didn't even compensate us or anything.  Ugh."
The housemade sodas were delightful. I loved the poutine!
"Wow.  Start to finish wow.  The menu was creative. Its broken down into 4 sections of gastronomic girth, light fare to full dinner.  This allowed us to try several items.  The fondue was spectacular with bread.  The fried zucchini was a nice take on veggies. The soup special-simple and elegant.  It was the Pork chop that stole the show.  Lightly breaded with bacon powder and beef cheeks with endives.  Best pork chop I've ever had.  Everything about the place had this perfect to a T finish.  The waiter was very professional and walked us through the menu very ably.  If you like to eat, this is a fantastic place.  If you just need cheap sustenance, you might not appreciate this place."
This place was fantastic! Our waitress was very attentive and helped explain everything on the menu. Their wine buyer happened to be in the restaurant that evening and our waitress got her to come over and explain the wine list to us and help us make a fantastic choice.I ordered the Elk which was AMAZING. My friend got the Lamb which was equally AMAZING. And the carmelized lobster was FANTASTIC.I can't wait to go back!
"The Gage has become one of my favorite restaurants and bars in the city. With a host of seasonal menu items, a high caliber of service, and a beautifully polished space I am always happy with my dining experience here. I love coming here for both lunch and dinner and after hearing the rave reviews my Mother gave the Belgian waffle I can't wait to come back for brunch (served Saturday & Sunday)."
We ate here for lunch one day shortly after they opened. I loved the fish and chips. The fish was crispy and flavorful without being too greasy. The lemonade was nice and refreshing.Our server was a little-over-the-top - in that friendly but fake kind of way. I also didn't like the salt & pepper containers. Seems very unsanitary to me.
"Almond crusted ribs.  Mmmmmmmm. +++++  $10.50 vodka gimlets?  Good, but $10.50 good?"
"I ended up here on an ill fated attempt at going to the campus bookstore in pouring (January) rain and inevitably found myself at the bar. It happens a lot that way.I had class (next door) and stuck to water (sheds tear) and sat by my lonesome at the very nice, smooth bar. The architecture and decor was great, nice tiling, painted tin ceilings and not to aggressive sports shows (on mute, thank you) up in the corners. Had the basic salad, which is my one true tests of how the rest of the food will add up. Tasty bread an butter. Another weakness.Not so fond of the pricing for the portion. A $9 salad that wasn't necessarily eye appealing or significant, but good, but kind of small. I saw other portions and they also looked on the small side...but maybe their rich gastro-pub-whathaveyou goodness would make up for that. I'll give it a shot again for drinks, or if someone wants to buy me $40 worth of Irish food."
"We went here on a day off during the week for mid-day cocktails and lunch.  The bloody mary was one my favorites- flavorful, but not too spicy.  The burgers and fries were also great, but everything was a bit pricey.  Great to try for food and a few drinks, but not if you're on a tight budget."
"Had lunch here, and I'm now a fan. It's too bad I live in Lincoln Park and seldom travel to the South Loop for anything and probably would not for this place. But, it comes highly recommended, at least from what I saw and ate during lunch. The beet salad was tasty, especially with the side of brie crisp potatoes. Yummo. On second thought, I would love to go back for dinner and peruse their beer list."
Lobster app was awesome. Great beers. Casual upscale bar. Great menu. Will return.
I popped in here before teh Bears game this sunday.  It was a nice place - great service and the atmosphere is good.  I had the corned beef hash and it was good - not spectacular but good.  G/f had the oatmeal brulee and thought it was good.  The place is a bit pricey and i can see how people might think it a tad pretentious.  I had a good time and left with a full belly.  They serve some excellent tea!
"Across from the fountains of MilPark in the 1898 Gage building, built back then by one Louis Sullivan.  Finally some competition for Park Grill, the Gage just opened this weekend.  Billy Lawless from Irish Oak and the Grafton was a real charmer on his hands.  Very classy interior,  long bar stocked with expected draft beer and some better belgian style bottles, lots of whisky too.  Second bar downstairs, across from big private party rooms.  The big surprise is the food, Dirk Flanigan is responsible, he of Meritage fame from years past.  If you've been wondering what all the fuss is about ""Gastropubs"", this is our fair city's finest example to date.  From the best in class scotch egg to the house cured salmon, tasty mussels and camembert topped burger, it's all fab.  come quick before it's overrun with touristas this summer"
"Stopped in 9:30ish on a Saturday evening to grab a quick bite. The host was very friendly and joked around with us for a few minutes before seating us at a table outdoors (great people watching on Michigan Ave!). They also didn't mind that we were dressed down and windblown from an evening of sailing. The boyfriend and I each had a burger. The burgers were cooked perfectly and disappeared quickly! Fries come with the burger, but I was feeling the need for a carb overload and ordered mashed potatoes as well and boy am I glad I did! I think they were seriously the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, perfect texture and seasoning. Our waitress was really funny and efficient. I'd like to go back and try some other menu items soon."
"This is my new favorite after-work haunt.  Great interior (love that green tile), solid food, good drinks.  A little pricey for dinner, but the lunch menu is decent.  Friday happy hour here is the best (sans tourists).  The low lighting and decor is instantly sexy.  I feel like I'm in a Dick Tracy comic, or Jessica Rabbit or something."
"Great service and great food. I will be back.  I recomend the burger, not the Gage burger but the regular burger."
"I was in town for the 2009 Chicago Tri and stopped in here based on a suggestion from the concierge because I couldn't access my Yelp!!!  Great choice for a lunch spot.  The atmosphere was sophisticated yet relaxed and our bartender, Chi (sp), promised us that he had been eating the mussels at least twice a week for 2 years straight.  After trying my first Fat Tire and allowing us to sample a few other new drafts we ordered the mussels, the steak salad and chicken salad.  My lunch was the steak salad which was cooked a perfect medium and was served with mint and watermelon.  This was one of the most interestingly delicious salads I have had that catered to both my sweet and salty taste buds.  When I first saw the mussels on the menu I kind of blew them off because we were in the middle of the country and I've never heard that Chicago is known for its seafood.  My girlfriend's dad said they were the best he has ever had!  I got to sample a few and they were really, really good but I'm still partial to some others.  The chicken salad was also a good lunch order but the specifics escape me because I didn't eat it but did get to sample the chicken, which was very tender and tasty.  Overall, because of the level of service we received, the free beer that someone accidentally poured wrong and the multiply samples we also were allowed to taste, this place made my day."
"Attended a recent function here and was surprised at the vast alcohol selection.  I know how to pour myself a drink, glass of wine or an imported beer, but I will seldom make myself mixed drinks; Therefore, I took advantage of the open bar to sample some of their selection.  I confess I tried some of their fruitier concoctions such as the Maestro and The Ward 8, which were decent.The Hors d'Oeuvres selection was fair, if a bit insubstantial - sampled the ""shrimp-on-a-fork,"" ceviche on a cornchip (housemade I think), portabello on a potato chip (housemade), scallop, fries & curry dip, roastbeef & horseradish puff, oysters on the half shell, toast and melted cheese as well as a petit fors type selection - scallop was the standout item.They offer dinner, and the executive chef is of some renown in Chicago.The bar scene itself is interesting - very homogenous crowd.  A few attractive people here and there, if that's important to you.  Very ""after business hours"" work crowd - a mix of ages.  Incongruous mix of techno/house music playing for an ""Irish pub"" - maybe I'm not hip to the current modern Irish pub scene.  The decor is very subdued, dark woods and leather.Service was attentive.  Only true minus was that they ""lost"" our reserved room to another party - I'm sure it was simply a matter of economics, but the substituted area we got was not great for a meeting, being right off the bar area, but was OK for checking out the rest of the bar and getting a good idea of the place."
"As busy as the were during 2 lunches during our a recent stay, the wait staff was so attentive.  The venison burger was so good my companion had it twice.  I had the beet salad which I thoroughly enjoyed and the pear soup - excellent.  On the second visit, I enjoyed the turkey sandwich, which was very good.  I wish we could have been there at dinner but we did stop in for a drink at night and again, friendly and prompt staff.  Drink prices were what we expected and what we pay in NYC."
"Went today after seeing a movie, and my friend and I really enjoyed sitting at the bar and chatting with the Irish bartender.  The place was pretty empty, which was surprising, but I guess because it was Sunday?  It was the hottest day of the year, so we were dressed ultra casual (me in a tank top and shorts, my friend had biked there in dirty cutoffs and a really old t-shirt with holes - sorry Rick!).  Add tattoos to that equation, and I was a bit worried we wouldn't be treated very well, especially when we walked up and saw the interior and the hosts wearing ties.  But, my fears were totally unfounded - if anything, we received more attention than we needed!Anyway - the Gage burger was excellent, nicely charred on the outside, cooked to order, the marmalade was a nice touch.  My friend had the fish and chips, perfectly fried and not at all greasy.  Since he's a big whiskey fan, I have plans to go back with my husband to try some Irish whiskeys and snack on Scotch Eggs.  I would recommend sitting at the bar if there's space, it seemed like the table service wasn't as fun."
"What a great irish pub and restaurant.  The drinks are fantastic with a lot of choices on the beer menu.  Billy the owner is one of those great owners who walks around and really talks to people to see what is working and what is not.  He is also a great joke teller, so be sure to ask him to share one of his favorites with you.  I love lamb and they had some great lamb dishes.  I go there every time I can when heading to downtown Chicago on business.  The decor is great too.  Not the touristy type place normally on the busy Michigan ave restaurant list.  Try it!"
"Recently returned to The Gage, for dinner this time.  What a fabulous meal.  Unfortunately,  we were in a hurry and did not get a chance to linger of the courses and try several things we had our eye on.  What we did get to try was delicious and the service was excellent, not only from our waiter from the the manager, the hostess, everyone.As a started we had the Scotch Egg, a tasty treat.  We got he spicy sausage with tomato and fig.  It was a bit game-y for my taste, but my husband enjoyed it.  I really wanted to give the special soup of hte day a try, spicy carrot puree but felt we did not have time.  The table next to us got it and it looked divine.For a main course my husband got fish and chips, he enjoyed them.  The presentation is great in the authentic newspaper wrapper.  I had the Kobe sirloin accompanied with a salad with coconut vinaigrette.  Delicious.  The menu is very diverse, the beer list is great, the wines are great too.  I look forward to returning when I can linger over the meal."
"Had a great lunch here on a beautiful spring day while killing a few hours before our flight to London. The space itself is really cool, and the lunch menu has a great variety of food options - everything from pub fare (sandwiches, burgers) to tasty sounding salads. Definitely a good stop off place if you find yourself in the Michigan Ave/Millenium Park area."
i love this place ....recently i have been hitting up the chicago symphony orchestra for performances and with the hustle and bustle of michigan avenue you look for a nice place to wine and dine. the gage is the place for such nice dishes well priced excellent quality and the waitstaff is well knowledgeable about everything . i would recommend this place and have reccomended it to everyone lol its a great place fish and chips are to die for and the mussel appetizer is divine
"Honestly my favorite place to eat. It can get pricey, but its one of the few places where I feel I always get my money's worth. The staff, all of them, from the hostesses to the owner, managers to the head chef to the bus boys are unbelievable. They remember who I am and and what I like. They offer great suggestions, and I always love what I get. I am going to miss living so close when I move next month, but fortunately I will work nearby. The food is so fun! The drinks are thoughtful and super tasty, and the beer, wine, & spirits lists are exhaustive! I've been on holidays (Valentine's Day, etc) when they have special menus and the dishes & drinks are great. I've also been to special beer & food pairings which were impressive and educational. And it is one of the only places where I always order dessert, even though I would usually have something less sweet. Their soups are always on point as well.I will continue to advise locals & out-of-towners to go to the Gage. I will also continue to take my friends, coworkers, whoever I can get a hold of to the Gage. Absolutely love it!"
"Interesting to look at, but somewhat lacking... their signature burger (I believe called ""the gage"" ?) has camembert and an onion marmalade on it.  Two of us ordered it; it sounded really scrupmtious but to me it was just too sweet and I wish I would've just gotten the $4 cheaper ""regular"" cheeseburger.  The sweetness of the burger could've been counteracted by something with a little spice or zip and it probably would've made me happier.  The fries were crispy yet had remnants of icky tasting oil, and needed salt.Service was lacking...  we went during lunch and of course it was busy... but we waited about 15 minutes before anyone even came to our table or gave us a menu, and waited a little long through every step of the process...  ESPN on every tv in the place? blah.  The atmosphere is supposed to be pub-like... I guess it is in a very corporate sense.  It's very nice inside, well decorated with very modern fixtures.  I guess I don't see the connection to it being a pub so much, it could've just as easily been called a sports bar, or not been called a pub at all.  The pub feel seems contrived, it doesn't seem any more Irish than the Bennigan's a block away.All that said, I'd say it's just as good of a choice as almost anything in the area so I'd go back for a lunch if in the area."
"I wavered between a 3 and 4 stars here, but overall, I decided to give it 4 because I think this is a good pick for a restaurant in the Loop area.  It has a great bar area right up front, and displays gorgeous dark wood furnishings.  At first, you wonder if the place is uppity, but you should find that service is friendly and thoughtful.  I've been here twice with a large group of friends (with reservations), and they did a great job of keeping us full and happy.  It gets pretty loud in here, so I'm not sure if this would be a good place to go for a date.  I've had the chicken and giant noodle soup (it is a giant noodle) - a pretty tasty soup.  I also had the seared scallops salad with a lemon vinaigrette (very good salad, perfect for an appetizer or a light appetite).  I have eaten the swiss chard with garlic, and it is OK although very oily.  Finally, I think the burger is quite divine.  The drink selection looks to be very interesting, but unfortunately I was not able to imbibe during both of my visits, since they were during the workday.My only beef, pun intended, is that I think the prices are high, but you are paying for ambiance and location.  However, the menu, while short, is creative and offers something for every palate.   I think it's right on par with Park Grille and Tavern on the Park."
I have been here twice.  Once on a date and the second time with clients for lunch.  Try the poutine and the scottish egg.  I dig this place and the location is great downtown.
"Went to The Gage last night after a work function - I was previously unfamiliar with the place and therefore had no expectations.  I was very pleasantly surprised!We didn't eat a ton of food and instead shared a bunch of starters.  We ordered the chips and curry gravy, the speck salad, the N-17 Fondue and the fried zuchini and olives - all of it was delicious.The service was great, especially considering we were a big group of rowdy coworkers and were already a little toasted.  I can't wait to go back and have a proper meal here."
"Lovely Place but with a $1400.00 bill you'd think it would be outstanding.  The service was great and attentive, but the dishes weren't that great.  Not a favorite!!!!"
"The food and the atmosphere here was fantastic.  If you enjoy mussels you must try the mussels vindaloo.  They were great.  I am from the East Coast and they were as good as anything I could get on the coast.  I originally ordered the fish and chips but the mussels portion was so large I switched to something smaller, the scallops.  These were also quite good.  There were only 3 so beware.The CON I have is the $9 beer.  Although I enjoyed it, I may not have had two had I known just how much it was."
"I love this place. The location is great for me. I've been there several times and the wait staff is attentive, and the food is delicious. I think I had the best burger I've ever had there-cooked perfectly and really flavorful."
Best burger so far in 2010! Sure it's $16 but our waiter looked like jack bauer! Classy place!
"Excellent place for lunch or dinner. Great service, though a little uppity. I had the sausage plate. It was extraordinary. I will be back for sure."
"I was first introduced to The Gage six months ago when a friend brought me there for lunch.  I ordered soup and salad, which doesn't seem like anything special-- unless you're at The Gage. The soup was rich and flavorful. I was head over heels for the decor and the different seating areas in the restaurant. After my first experience at The Gage, I told my brother Peter about it, at which he told me he'd been there several times and cannot get enough of the Scotch egg.  From the way he talked about the Scotch egg, you'd think it had cocaine sprinkled on it. This weekend I returned to The Gage for brunch and finally tried the Scotch egg as a shared appetizer.  Peter was right: you have to order the Scotch egg!  Everything else about my second visit to The Gage was spectacular.  The service was great, the food was adventurous and pleasing, and the ambiance was perfect! I highly recommend The Gage if you're visiting the downtown area or if you're a Chicagoan meeting up with visitors who are staying downtown."
"Saw mixed reviews for The Gage, but was really in the mood for a Friday dinner out immediately after work, and as The Gage is one of 2 (also, Panda Express) restaurants in the Loop open post-5 pm, and it was bookable via Open Table, I thought we would give it a whirl. I dug the old school decor; I felt comfortable in a polo, shorts and high tops; and the crowd seemed jovial enough. Items were a bit pricey, but not obnoxiously so. I got the ""Gage Fizz"" cocktail... I had mixed feelings as to whether I really liked it or if it tasted like a bad scotch and soda with a packet of 'Sugar in the Raw' at the bottom, so I quickly moved into a delightful Sommelier-recommended Grenache/Syrah blend. I'm trying to lose weight, so we had the Scotch Egg (hard boiled egg encased in deep-fried sausage) as an opener. Greasy and good. More Scotch food please!I wanted to get the chicken and giant noodle soup, because I love giant things, but we went straight to main course options: I had the Hangar Steak with Goat Cheese Grits and Cabernet Stilton-Butter. The waiter recommended medium rare, which turned out to be right on. I was wholly satisfied and found the dish mouth-watering and well presented.  My lady felt guilty ordering a $14 burger, but went ahead with The Gage USDA Prime Burger comprised of Ground Angus, Local Camembert (paradox!), Melted Onion Marmalade, on Toasted Malt Roll. An excellent burger. In spite of a few service miscues -- the poor bread guy was interrupted mid-sentence by the arrival of our Scotch Egg -- a sharp-eyed manager noticed our confusion when unadvertised fries arrived with the Gage Burger and sped to our table to inquire if anything was the matter. We told him that we had ordered the Crisp Brie Potato (a little sopping in butter for my tastes, but well-received by my buttervore lady) as a side only because we didn't think the burger came with fries. I suppose we should have assumed/asked, but he struck the Crisp Brie Potato from our tab without being asked to do so then disappeared as unobtrusively as he'd materialized. All told, I was really satisfied with our experience at The Gage, and would certainly consider going back. Sidebar -- it's my opinion that Billy Lawless is a fake name. Sort of like if I started going by ""Nat Hardcore"" or something."
"My wife and I went to The Gage during a business trip last October on the recommendation of the concierge at The Renaissance and we loved everything, repeat everything about this eatery.  The service was attentive and very personable, the menu was both diverse and eclectic, the wine list was excellent, and the atmosphere was what I hoped for and expected at a downtown Chicago gastropub on a Friday night.  My wife had a seasonal risotto and I had a regional sausage & peppers dish which were both fabulous.  If you are visiting Chicago and want a true 'taste' of current Chicago restaurant fare, treat yourself to The Gage."
"Read the reviews and Yelped before dining but I think I set my expectations too high.  We had brunch.  I love brunch but I've created a somewhat tragic dichotomy that necessitates either trashy greasy spoon coffee or Intelligentsia caliber French press coffee.  The Gage served neither but it came in a flashy white mug and saucer with fancy sugar cubes (white and raw).  I had the omelette of the day -- ham, cheddar, spinach, and truffle oil.  It was intense, way *too* intense and I could barely finish half of it (normally I eat like a monster on a Sunday morning).  The truffle oil permeated everything to the point that the ham and spinach were too rich and heavy to take more than a few bites.  I really enjoyed my potatoes (also drenched in cheese, brie) but should have thought about the truffle oil, cheddar, brie trifecta, especially in relation to the goat cheese grits my partner ordered!   We barely put a dent in the grits, deliciousness aside.  Always on the quest for the most delicious eggs benedict of all-time, I found theirs to be too spicy on the hollandaise (no lemon hint *at all* and spicy enough to overpower the delicate richness of egg yolk) and heavy on the meat.  Missing the balance of a good benedict.  Again, not bad, just not excellent and I'm not sure I would return in a hurry for brunch.  Service was good but then again, we were the only two in the place for a solid 45 minutes."
"So, seeing as how my mother is OBSESSED with this place (she knows the owner, half the servers and multiple bartenders - my mother - the Carrie Bradshaw of the over-60 jewish grandmothers) I had no choice but to try it.We went for a pre-mother's day family brunch. I had the lox and bagels (already a plus that they serve this - see e.g. my Ann Sather review), my husband had some apple pancake kinda thing, both were quite tasty. Good service, interesting decor. No complaints really, other than my mother's incessant yammering about how great it is. Oh, and last we checked I don't think they had valet."
"Excellent scallops. The beet and blue cheese salad is also very good. My office is right around the corner and love going here for lunch during the work week. Finally, the Gage makes the best vodka gimlet of all time. So yummy."
We ate here 2 lunches in 2 days.  Visiting from SF where we love the Tipsy Pig--gastropub.  The Gage rates 5 stars for well executed and tasty food served expediently and professionally.  Our server Justin was great.  On our 2nd day the owner came and introduced himself and offered to buy us beverages or dessert.Look forward to a dinner here when we return to visit.Pulled pork sandoFish n chipsCorned beef sando specialPeppered salmon slices and bacon sandoAll delicious!
"So I've been to The Gage twice now.  The first time I went with my boyfriend and we sat at the bar.Food:The scotch egg: a little underwhelming but not bad at all.  I prefer Paramount Room's.Chicken livers: delicious.  Flavorful, and a nice portion size.Potato soup: I'm a pretty big fan of potato soup no matter what, I liked the flavor a lot, could have used more chunks of tater, but that's just my preference.Service was friendly but not overbearing, accurate in recommendations and prompt.My second visit was with a group of four and we sat on the patio and had a delightful, energetic server who stuck around long enough to make a quick joke here and there, followed up on decisions made (I was grateful he convinced me to go with the Saison rather than my usual Sophie - it really hit the spot).All in all, the service is knowledgable, the food is dependably good and comes out with a quickness.  I love the style, just sleek enough without being pretentious.  A great place to stop in after a day in the Modern Wing."
"I had no idea this place was so ""fancy"" until my friend and I walked in for a casual Sunday afternoon lunch and noticed the white tableclothes, tea lights, etc. Lovely atmosphere and decor. The menu had a wide selection and they were still offering the prix-fix menu for restaurant week. The service was great, very friendly and attentive, though we annoyed our waitress by taking too long to pay our bill and she kinda let us know it. I would definitely return to The Gage for dinner. Looks like a great date place or an awesome stop for a drink. As for the food, the fish and chips was yummy but a bit too heavy...I couldn't move after eating!!"
I need to upgrade Gage after having a really tasty burger there for lunch this weekend. I'd also love to go back and order off the brunch menu sometime soon because the eggs benedict my friend ordered looked delicious.
"We have previously drank and dined at The Gage and thought the food, decor and location would work well for our wedding after party.   So far, the service has been impeccable, the rental fee the least expensive thing we have purchased for our wedding and we can't wait to have the event there.  Plus, since we are at the Art Institute for the ceremony, our guests will not have to walk very far in the cold Chicago winter."
"Great restaurant to dip into after visiting the Chicago Insitute of Art if you're looking for something a little nicer.   The wait staff was extremly attentive, friendly and very informative.  They have great daily specials, my Mom had the Alaskan Halibut which she highly recommends.  I would also suggest getting a side of mashed potates if they don't come with your meal!"
Love The Gage. Some of the best eclectic Irish fare you will find outside of Ireland. Whether you sit at the bar or in a booth your experience will be memorable. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is how crowded the bar is and the length of the wait when you don't have a reservation. Not a place you can just drop in for a drink or a quick meal. Otherwise it is awesome.
"This is what I imagine the food on Top Chef tastes like - full flavored with surprising little elements that make your taste buds go, ""damn, that's good!"" For starters, my friend and I each had the corn soup and shared a simple salad. The corn soup is ladled into your bowl right at your table, with a nice, salty strip of bacon sitting in the bottom of the bowl. We each ordered an entree, but told the waiter we were going to share so the kitchen was kind enough to bring them out already divided on two separate plates. We chose the risotto with seasonal vegetables (eggplant, squash, green beans) and striped bass. Both were simply sublime. Despite being stuffed to the gills we forged ahead and shared the chocolate churros with dark and milk chocolate dipping sauces, served alongside a chocolate mousse. The entire meal was flawless from start to finish. Good food paired with great service and a chic ambiance - it doesn't get any better."
Oh this place is the shit! And that's the first 4-letter word I've used in a review.  The pate is to die for. The Elk... totally worth the $$$.  Service is impeccable.  They split the menu into 4 courses.  My friend and I ordered one thing from each course and split it and it was plenty. Stay away from the rabbit salad though.  It was kinda lame.  I've eaten here 3 times and loved almost everything. Plus it's a great atmosphere. Perfect place to  impress out of town guests.
"I've had several meals at The Gage and have never been disappointed.  Although I generally default to the fish and chips because it's SO good, I tried their steak sandwich (w/some kind of interesting cheddar cheese) the last time I was there for lunch & it was excellent.  The servers are uniformly attentive and knowledgeable.  I also like the way they've arranged their wine list.  Finally, twice when I've been there, the manager stopped by to ask how everything was.  When my friend told him that the food was great but the coffee was terrible, he was horrified; he went back to the kitchen, came back to our table and told her that she was right.  He apologized and offered her a freshly-brewed (and better) cup. My only complaint is the noise level - not so conversation friendly unless you're there at an off hour."
"First and foremost the food here was great, filling and tasty. The service was attentive if our particular server was a little cosy (I like people but I need to get to know them before I want to hang out). One issue that should be noted: this is NOT what I would consider a gastropub. Why? Because they don't have more than 20 beers on tap. I would guess they have about 10 which is acceptable but not really on par with my expectations."
"My friend was intent on going here for the fish and chips, so I went.Cool interior, but I didn't get the sense that they were trying too hard at all. Overall, it was decent. I wasn't blown away by anything whatsoever. Our server was great - and recommended both appetizers and entrees.My friends were rocked by their fish and chips, but I had the ""local sausage plate"" - which was good, but lacking in a variety of tastes."
"Pretentious, expensive, and not that good. Even my cocktail, the Gage Old Fashioned, was so unappetizing that I didn't finish it despite it $13 price tag. This is a place to get unusual proteins like antelope and elk. I chose a meatless dish, because it was the only thing that sounded fresh and light. It was neither. The plate included  a large zucchini sliced the long way and grilled, acccompanied by a barley-chanterelle melange that included cherry tomatoes and tiny squashes with the flowers still on. The chanterelles and squashes and grilled cherry tomatoes were very tasty. The barley, well...have you ever been presented with a heap of richly-scented, dark-colored barley in the middle of summer? Paired with all those fresh vegetables, it didn't make sense, and it was way too heavy. My heirloom-tomato soup dissapointed, too. In fact, the best thing about it were the two bullets of fried cheese in the bottom of the dish. The coffee-stuffed doughnuts were weird and pretentious and lying in a sandpit of sugar and gritty ""dried coffee."" I hear the burgers are good, though."
"4.5 Stars!! Gastropub that generally fits any occasion and is somehow, mostly free of tourists (mostly). I've been here with parents for dinner, close friends, co-workers for drinks and downstairs a few times for private parties. Their brunch is phenomenal without being over-the-top. I would recommend the eggs benedict, the mussels vindaloo , fish and chips, Gage Burger and scallops as favorites!"
"I had the fish and chips, my wife had the lobster.  The food was excellent.  Very different menu from a typical gastropub.  We will go there again."
Stoppeed by with some friends on a whin after an architecture tour. Fun atmoosphere. I had some beer and the duck fried nuts which were amazing.
"Gage is full of young people, business peeps, and students from Roosevelt and nearby city universities. I enjoyed a great meal and Stella Artois beer here after my last MA -Acctg finals...Yuck I know. But the bartender and servers made the meal experience just relaxing. Loud, busseling and packed with peeps! Great sandwich with some potatoes and goat cheese!! Mmmm Nice place for after work happy hour drinks and to let some steam off!"
"The first word that comes to mind is ""Fun.""  I had a very fun lunch at the Gage because of great atmosephere, impressive food, and the perfect server. This is a hybrid of bar and fancy food. Its very busy at lunch time, I recommend reservations. Once seated, ask questions about the menu. The food can be very different and is supposed to pair up well with specific drinks, hence the term, ""gastropub.""I ate the fish n chips, which might be my favorite in the city, now.  The crispy outside was like a ""tasty bark"" that covered  huge portions of fish, more than I could eat. The tarter sauce was unique and a must-eat with both fish and the fries. I really enjoyed this meal!The service was attentive and our waiter was very well-informed of the menu and recomendations. He was passionate about the food and really seemed to care if we enjoyed everything on the table.Go to the Gage for an interesting menu and great service."
"My go-to place for taking out of towners after the obligatory Bean/Millenium Park outing.  As a matter of fact, it's probably my favorite place in the Loop-ish area.  Everything I or my companions have had here has been out of this world.  I've only been to lunch, but it seems like it would be a fun time to come for drinks any time of day/night."
"Salad and drinks 4 stars. I'm not sure which salad I had, but it had ""greens"" in the name. I ordered the risotto entree and it was not so hot (not in the literal temperature sense, in the not so great sense) but I would give them another shot. The flavor was good, but it had a sticky consistency. This would be a good spot to take visitors since its right in the downtown area between the shopping mecca and office buildings, and its a short walk from Millenium park."
"Noisy, wonderful place that is precisely located in the epicenter of the Art Institute/Financial District, which makes it convenient for just about every purpose I find downtown.  Hearty, well-constructed and creative menu...everything toothsome...varied and interesting wines and beers...a very satisfying dining experience."
"Just came for a late dinner after a longish day at the office.  Pretty good beer selection and a great looking menu. Service was great. Ended up just sitting at the bar since I was alone on the road for work. Sometimes that can mean great drink service, but horrible meal service. Not the case here. Quick, great service all around.Romaine salad (ceasar) was a great. I went with the Amish chicken.  It was well prepared and tasted great. I'll be back again."
"Interesting menu, beautiful bar, poor service. Elena seemed too busy for us although...there was no one else in there.  I won't be going back anytime soon."
"This gastro-pub is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  We always sit at the bar for a more casual experience, and we have never been disappointed.  The bartenders know the menu and are great at making recommendations.  The drinks are delicious and creative.  I highly recommend the mussels vindaloo, scallops, lobster risotto, fish and chips, and all of the desserts!  The lunch menu is also amazing and all of the sandwiches have been perfection.  I love this place and you will too!"
I'm generally satisfied with the breakfast and some of the other Irish themed dishes.
"things i enjoy: tasty little meat ball thingys on sticks with a spicy horseradish sauce, mushroom strudels, miniature fish and chips served in their own little newspaper cones to absorb the grease, cocktail hours and most of all, my job paying for all of these things.onto dinner. we had a limited menu (obviously, it was a special event). the choices were filet or stripped bass. after being informed that the rarest i could have my steak was medium, i opted for the fish. my coworker chose the steak and asked the waitress to go as rare as she could. i definitely came out on the short end of that stick. his steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, whereas my fish... my fish was fishy. i like seafood of all kinds and this fish was not what i would call a catch of the day (maybe a catch of 3 weeks ago). everything else i thought was great. great crab/caviar app, great ceasar salad, nice sides, lovely service.... just lousy fish. i'm giving the gage the benefit of the doubt and assuming the fish was a fluke (no pun intended)."
"This place has AWESOME food! Went here one Saturday for a quick lunch and a few drinks and enjoyed everything! Although the wine is SUPER pricey (try $15 for a glass of house Pinot Grigio and $13 for a glass of house Pinot Noir), the place is fun to have some drinks at. Saturday made it busy, so I am not sure how it is during the week. I got the soup and sandwich combo- half a salmon club with potato soup and fries. For $13 this was definitely worth it! The potato soup was creamy and full of flavor and the salmon club had an awesome herb mayo on it.The menu is the same for lunch and dinner and everything looked pretty tasty; expensive, but you are on Michigan Ave. FYI- not a place for kids; there is no kids menu to my knowledge and this is more of an upscale bar than a family-friendly place.Despite the expensive tab at the end of our visit- this place was really good. We just weren't expecting to drop $120 for a ""quick lunch.""  Definitely check it out for a nice dinner or an enjoyable lunch. Bring your wallet!"
"Had drinks and snacks for a happy hour the night before my friend's wedding, and was pleasantly surprised by the downstairs event room.  Very large and classic space.  Snacks were awesome and most everything was served on lollipop sticks or those tiny seafood forks.  I dont know the kitchen fit a caprese salad on a stick, but they did.  The fish and chips were served in cone shaped newspaper, which was very inventive."
"This place is fantastic. If your looking for a fun upscale restaurant -bar downtown, look no further. It's a bit loud but your can ask for a table in the rear where it's quieter. There's not a bad item on the menu and if you love mussels there's are great. I look forward to returning soon."
"The food was just... ok.  And for a sandwich the size of my palm (and I do mean the palm, not including my fingers) and a cup of soup, I paid $13.   I wouldn't have minded if I thought that it was so much better than what I could've gotten at a Panera or Corner Bakery for half the price.. but it wasn't.  It was just... average.  And lukewarm at best.  I wouldn't go back."
"Went today after getting out of work early for Thanksgiving holiday. Just wanted a drink and a late lunch. Sat down right away by the bar and service was great and attentive. I got the carrot ginger soup and turkey on a baguette. The bread was awesome, not hard as a rock where it cuts your mouth. Turkey was fresh and tasted like it was carved. The french fries are amazing. Love the wine that comes in a carafe. You buy a glass but get so much more than that good for me!"
"It's kind of cool that such a good gastropub is located in the heart of the tourist district.  Lucky for me, I work near by so I can stop by every now and then.  Particularly in good weather, you need a reservation even for lunch, but they're on open table so it's pretty easy and you can usually get one that morning.  The beer selection is good featuring typical craft beer options.  The food is gastropub classics like burgers and steak sandwiches and also nicer entrees like roasted fish and lamb stew.  I particularly like the poutine (fries, gravy, cheese curds, elk ragout) and the scotch egg.  Also the salads are really fresh and quite gourmet with lots of different vegetables and cheeses.  The prices are what you'd expect given the location, and really if it were a couple bucks cheaper I'd go more often, but I'm still happy to have them near by when I'm in the mood for a 15-20 dollar lunch."
The poutine with the elk ragout was delicious!!!
This is a pretty standard place for a business lunch. I like it even better for happy hour. Good beers on tap.
"excellent food. simple. clean. fresh and unique.  it's expensive for a pub but cheap for a nice restaurant. i started with the heirloom tomato salad with smoked gouda. when it came out it looked like a fist size pile of mult-colored tomatoes with no cheese. i asked about the cheese and they promtly brought me a new plate with twice as many tomatoes and some cheese on it.  it was stunningly beautiful, seasonal, simple and delicious. however for 15 dollars i expected a little more than the sprinkling of cheese. overall no complaints. it is bustling and load but that's kind of part of the charm."
"We've been to The Gage half-a-dozen times, before or after events at Orchestra Hall. We really enjoy the ambiance, which seems to be busy, cheerful, and full of people enjoying the food all day. It's a little noisy and a little crowded, and that's part of the appeal.This was our first visit when the brunch menu was available. The buckwheat waffle was amazing - crisp but light and with a flavor that just blew us away. The mixed-lettuce salad was big enough for two of us to split, with a nice mix of lettuces and an unassuming dressing. This was the second time I've had the Lamb Stew Vindaloo; it was every bit as good as I remembered."
"In the last year, we have been to Chicago twice and have made it to The Gage three times.  Truly great food, great location and staff."
I am a huge fan of this place. I went for lunch and was thrilled to see a beet salad on the menu. It was very good. I ordered fish and chips which I have not had in many years and it was amazing. I was able to try three different desserts and the molten chocolate cake was out of control. I loved the feel and decor of the restaurant. Highly highly recommended.
"This place was great! I would definitely eat here again if it was closer to where we live. The food was great, we started with the fondue. The bread was delicious and buttery and the fondue was soooo good. We both had the price fixe menu with the mixed greens salad and the pork. The pork was wonderful, my first bite seemed to be a tiny bit dry but it was fine after that. It was seasoned well and was so tender it fell apart.  For dessert I had the chocolate pot du creme (I believe that was the name) and my fiance had the root beer reconstructed. Even though I thought my dessert tasted the best, the root beer dessert was really fun! I had no idea they had root beer flavored pop rocks. As far as booze goes, I had a kir royale and a margarita and both were delicious. They had a good amount of beers, wines, cocktails and hard liquor on their drink menu. Our server was really friendly and helpful with food suggestions and the atmosphere was also comfortable. I loved my entire dining experience."
"We stopped in on a tip from a friend and had one of the most fabulous dinners that I have had in a long time.  Lucky for us it was restaurant week - Organic Lettuces to start (YUM!) and the grilled angus steak with goats cheese and fontina grits, fried kale (SUPER YUM!!).  My fiance had the Amish Chicken with roasted three rivers potatoes - which were amazing.  I wish I would not have ordered the poached pear for dessert - too hard to eat with a fork - but didn't not matter after our amazing dinner.  Service was impeccable - atmosphere was relaxed.  I would recommend to anyone.  We will definately be back soon."
"Went there with a large group for a birthday brunch. The staff was so accommodating -  let us bring in our own cake and didn't charge a cutting fee. The food is good, not great, but it is overall a lovely place to eat on Michigan's touristy strip by Millennium Park. I really enjoy the atmosphere, Irish touches to the menu, and waitstaff."
"Met up with some friends from out of town who wanted do to the whole ""bean and face fountain"" thing. When the topic of lunch came up I jumped at the chance to finally eat at this place and bring my craft beer loving friends along with me. It being a gorgeous Chicago day, and that it was around 1pm, the restaurant was quite busy with business people and tourists all looking for a bite. We didn't have a reservation so the wait would be 30 minutes unless we did their patio seating. Because it was so hot out no other patron was sitting outside but we didn't want to wait and decided to brave the heat. Really glad we did that. The seats were in the shade so the temperature wasn't too bad and with a slight breeze it was actually quite comfortable. Because we were the only ones out there our server was kind of awkward at first because he talked to us, took our drink orders, came back with drinks, and then just stood there at our table watching us read the menu. Stood there for a good 5 minutes. Just watching. Kind of weird but I guess he didn't have anything else to do. Their libations list, as they call it, is pretty impressive and I had fun choosing a couple craft beers I've never had before. Got the Darkhorse Raspberry Ale and the Dragon Milk Stout with the stout being the clear favorite. For food I had their House Poutine. Never had poutine before. Knew of it. Have been curious to try it some day. Today was the day. With a nice elk ragout gravy, some cheese, and tasty fries, the whole meal was filling and good. Could of used more cheese but still good. Canada is on to something. My wife had a mushroom sandwich which was decent but I was kind of dissapointed in the overall lack of vegetarian options for her. As our meal progressed our awkward at first server grew on me and turned out to be actually quite warm and helpful. Even though our table started with four people it soon went to five and then to six people as other friends joined us late. Our server, even though by now had other tables to worry about, took this in stride, got us extra chairs, put in the late arrivals' orders, answered drink questions, and was charming doing so. Overall I had a good experince here. Other items on their menu, and the ones I saw at other tables while walking to the restroom, look promising and delicious. I don't know if I will come here regularly but I do know I will certainly return if I have friends visiting. Especially friends who like craft beers and rare spirits and who aren't shy about spending a pretty penny to enjoy themselves."
We stopped in for a quick bite to eat and a drink or two. Great food and wonderful service. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a sophisticated place to go!
"In a word: overpriced.  For some reason, I was expecting a bar with good food, not a relatively upscale restaurant with prices to match.  I had the fish and chips, which were really good, but they were over $17!  I'm really not sure how this qualifies as a gastropub, seeing as reservations were practically a must.  Our waiter seemed annoyed that most of us did not order anything to drink."
"My firm had our 2008 holiday party here, and everything was perfect.  We had the basement to ourselves and the reserved dining room was beautiful.  Our menu was complete with a delicious salad, roasted filet to die for and a pear crisp for dessert.  When we first arrived, we had a pretty decent cheese tray with different selections along with cracker and things of that nature.  We came back later after a trip to the ice rink to finish the night off with a few more cocktails to celebrate our new found ice skating talent."
"Great place. Great bar. Great Food.  Took my wife there and before we left she was asking when we could go again.  Terrific fish and chips, good salads, interesting and good wine list.  First rate place.  Since I began and forgot to post this review, we've been back about 4 more times, for lunch and dinner.  All excellent.  Good lunch burgers, in ginormous and normal sizes"
"Went for brunch and it was very good.  I ordered the bloody mary, two poached eggs with hash and goat cheese grits.  the eggs and hash were very good, potatoes were crispy and the dish came with some muligrain or whole grain wheat toast sweet and perfectly toasted.  the drink was delicious and beautifully prepared.  the grits was not that great.  The service was excellent, staff friendly and attentive.  I definitely would like to go back."
"We had a group of eight on a Saturday night and they accommodated us nicely. The server was attentive but the plates always ended up in front of the wrong people. Not a big deal, just something to note. I had the watermelon and rabbit salad which was balanced perfectly and probably my favorite dish of this entire summer. I tried someone's pork chop which was perfectly grilled, but still very juicy and tender. We did something strange, at the end of the night we ordered every dessert and shared around. I tried all eight on the menu. The home made ice creams and sorbets were the best, followed closely by the french toast (although I was the only one who seemed to like this) and the chocolate and beet souffle. Can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner and try some pub food as well."
"I've only been to the gage a few times, and only during happy hour.  So my review will be solely based on my experiences at the bar, drinking the gage old fashioned and eating fries with curry gravy.  That said, I keep coming back.  It's always packed in here during rush hour.  But if you get your drink, stand around for a few minutes, and act aggressively, you'll get a small table or spot at the bar to enjoy your curry fries.  The drinks have been consistent (love the cherries in the old fashioned- I think they're brandied or something), as well as the must-have curry fries.  The only downside is that, as a 20-something who usually comes here with female friends of the same age, we often spend more time than we'd like fending off middle aged gentlemen trying to make conversation.  Which is fine, but when you're just here to catch up with a friend over a drink, can get tiresome.  I'm not sure that I'd come here for a proper meal, because I'm not in love with the ambiance or menu, but for happy hour it's a perfectly nice and convenient place to stop by."
"The Scotch egg is a revelation. What more to say? I've always enjoyed super-delightful service and though I've had a few clunkers ( a delicate but bland fish and chips, so-so strozzapreti), the winners have always been five-star champions. The mushroom soup, tomato and polenta dish, and housemade sausage: wowza."
"I came here on a busy Saturday night.  Although we had reservations for four, my two friends decided that that would be the perfect night for relationship drama, so it ended up being just my sis and I.  I loved the fact that the place had a relaxing bar atmosphere, but was done up so that it was definitely more upscale.  Our waitress was great and was the kind who didn't mind listening to our questions, and offering up some great suggestions, even though you could tell she was super busy.  She even recommended some drinks that were no longer on the menu, and they ended up being perfect.  Although we didn't venture too far into the menu, both of us ended up well fed and happy with our choices.  My sis with her fish & chips and me with their regular burger, which came w/ its own separate plate of fries.  Dammit, this is why you should not do reviews at ten in the morning - now my ass is hungry."
"the gage is a perfect after work spot. it has a large bar area so it's not too hard to get seated. you can eat at the bar if you get hungry after a drink or two. i've been trying to find a place like this. the bartenders were really friendly. it has an interesting atmosphere. there were so many interesting options that you don't see on most menus which is such a breath of fresh air. i ate the rabbit salad on a whim and it was pretty tasty. a little heavy on the horseradish or was it the garlic (?), but the rabbit was cooked well and it was a unique concept. my coworker ate the fish and chips and said they were delicious. yay for the gage!good to eat: braised rabbit salad"
"Had lunch here.  Not sure if it would be a great choice for a business lunch because it seemed really loud.  But the food was good, portions were pretty big, lots of sandwich options, service was good, easy to get in for lunch so, thumbs up."
"After a day in the office, this is a nice place to unwind.  A friend had gotten there early to get us seats out in the patio to enjoy one of the few remaining gorgeous Chicago days.  With a view of Millenium Park sipping on the Spiced Cider Martini all is well.  It was funny because the waiter said that the drink was good, and asked me how I liked it later and also said that he hadn't ever had it before.  So, I caught him in a lie and he admitted it!  It was pretty funny, but good thing I thought it was tasty!  Anyways, we started out with the cheese fondue - it's brie by the way.  It was good, but nothing special.  It seemed like the regular burgers are pretty popular, but I had the peppered steak.  It wasn't really peppery to me, but I did appreciate the combination with the pears and the blue cheese and purple cabbage.  It's pretty neat for a gastropub.  It's gonna be kind of pricey downtown, but what can you really expect?!  Definitely, no daily specials here."
"I really really wanted to like this place, you guys.  I had heard so many good things about it.  I came here with a date.  It was a spur of the moment thing, but we were seated at a table in the bar area right away despite the fact that it super crowded.  There was a good beer selection.  I ordered the pork chop.  It was dry and flavorless.  I can make a way better pork chop with a skillet, olive oil, salt & pepper and it won't cost anywhere near the $30 my date paid for it.   I really felt bad, but the restaurant was his suggestion and he insisted on paying.  We moved over to the bar after we ate and were accosted by a drunken conference attendee.  The bartender had stopped serving the guy but ignored the fact that he was bothering me and I had to ask the bartender to take care of the guy so he'd leave me and my date alone.  I'm not sure I'll ever bother going back there.  I could see potential for a really nice dinner but that's not the experience that I had."
"I was really excited to try this place after reading the reviews but I was more than a little disappointed. The evening started strong, attentive waiter, great sense of humor and right on wine recommendation. It only went downhill after our meals were served. I ordered the tuna lightly seared, which it was but the fish was warm on the inside, almost like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. I sat with an empty wine glass for 10 minutes, my friend was also left with out anything to drink and it took a concerted effort to get the waiters attention to rectify the situation. Not sure I would go again for the price."
"Delicious food! Prices are a little on the high side for just a lunch, but the quality and variety are worth it. Fish and Chips, Salmon sandwich, Brisket, and you can't go wrong with anything during brunch."
"The mussels vindaloo are UNBELIEVABLE....Go to the gage, and order those with a cold beer. We did have a few raw ones, and sent them back to get resteamed, no big dea.The waiter got a little nervous about it and sent the equally nervous manager, who insisted that they were cooked. we just wanted them cooked longer. anyway, they comped our mussels, which was nice....because we could then afford an uneccessary jameson at the bar on our way out, and drunkenly stumbled through the tiny cartier-bresson exhibit at ARTIC 2 pm. on a weekday."
"The food was very good, the service was great and the drinks were tasty too.  The onion and potato soup was to die for!  My only complaint was the bread, it overpowered the delicate flavors of the meal.  But I know that is a really picky comment.  The manager was nice enough to even discuss my comments about the bread and told us they're using a new bakery.  I'm very happy with my meal and customer service.I""d recommend it to anyone wanting a hip place for a meal in the Loop"
"A little crowded, so we only had drinks here. Friendly staff and great location. Nice sidewalk seating in the summer."
"If you are a tourist and you are going to the Art Institute or going to check out The Bean, come here for drinks/snacks/lunch. Forget about Park Grill. Its a hearty menu of risottos, burgers, chops and other upscale bar fare, but it is in such a great environment of a restaurant that is like you are in a vintage building circa Chicago 40 years ago. I also believe owned by two brothers that also have a big presence even just being there for a business lunch.  Love that. Its like a neighborhood feel, but you're still in the Loop.  Choices nearby are spotty since anything nearby is such a chain establishment or stuck in a hotel lobby.  A great wine list too."
"went here on a Saturday night, and it wasn't too crowded at all...though i guess it was around 9:00.best fish n' chips I've ever eaten in my life...good thing, b/c they were also the most expensive, coming in at $17. Chef Dirk said he spent a lot of time on the tartar sauce...and it's the only tartar sauce I've not only been able to stomach, but actually wanted to lick out of the bowl. the kale was yummy, but could have used a little more garlic, and I would highly recommend the gage ginger fizz..."
Great place for lunch across from the Bean.
"I've been there for lunch a few times, and the only thought I've had as I walked out each time was, ""I paid too much for that meal.""  I can't complain about the food, but you just don't get what you pay for."
"I went for lunch today and I am quite impressed with The Gage. I had the half sandwich half soup with the peppered salmon club and butternut squash soup. I really enjoyed my meal and struggled to finish it because although it was delicious it was also a hearty portion. My dining companion had the sandwich special- a veal sandwich with mixed greens. She assured it me was wonderful. I am looking forward to a second visit in the near future. Our waiter was attentive, my water and wine were never empty and the food was delightful."
Impossibly crowded every night after work.  Delicious food.  Good drinks.  Unfortunately I can't remember what I ate or drank since I drank so much that I had a sick day the next morning.  But I do remember it was good!  I want to go back to try lunch one day when its nicer and I feel like making the walk from the office.
"I have mixed feelings about The Gage.  I've been there about 10 times and I'm sure I'll be back, but mostly because of the location.I've always had friendly service, well except for interactions with the hostess.  I've never had a pleasant experience entering this restaurant.  The hostess has always been snotty, unaccomodating and basically rude.  I'm sure this restaurant has lost customers due to her alone!Anyways, if I ignore her I'm usually able to enjoy the rest of my visit.  I've been there a few times just for drinks (overpriced but generous), a few private parties (very nice) and a few times for dinner.  The food is tasty and the atmosphere is comfortable.  Those are the main reasons I go back.  Bottom line:  good food, good atmosphere, but there are better places to go if you want to spend that kind of money."
Best time you will ever have in Chicago... stop by the Gage for a draft.  It is amazing!
"Fun after work spot.  Food was good but a little odd....you will not find your regular happy  hour nibblers here.  Although the crowd is fun, people watching fantastic and it is right across the street from Millenium Park.  Definitely will head back here again both for a business drink spot and to check out the scenary inside."
"I went to the Gage last night to celebrate the end of the school sememster for my friend JJ.  There was about 10 of us overall.  I thought the place was well decorated and the service was phenomenal.  Very good wine selection by the glass.  It definitely has more polish and bravdo than the other ""after work"" bars in the loop.  The only downside is that it gets VERY crowded VERY quickly.  By 5:30pm on a Thursday, all the seats and tables in the bar are gone - so get there early!"
"My initial comment was it's a little pricey, but its on Michigan Ave.  Despite the price, The Gage delivered.  The burger was absolutely fantastic, the Camembert on top truly made it something special!  It was so great we had to ask the waitress where they get the cheese from, apparently some dairy farmer in Indiana!  The potato soup is wonderful!  (It better be, this place is supposed to be Irish!)  And for all you vegetarians out there, the wild mushroom sandwich is sinfully good!"
"great food at michigan avenue prices. we stopped in for dinner after seeing a concert at millenium park. great beer selection for george and a lovely glass of champagne for me. the service was friendly and attentive and i liked the atmosphere.we split the caesar salad which was really really good. then i went with the classic fish and chips (yum!) and george had the big eye tuna, which was fresh and delicious. i particularly liked that the manager was walking around to all the tables helping clear and making sure that everyone was happy. he even got me another glass of champagne when our waitress was busy with another table.we will definitely come back if we are in the area and hungry."
"Service was good, food overpriced. Ok , you pay for the location, but everything I had was below average. Even my beloved Moscato D'Asti was the worst I had so far in the city. I was not impressed and I won't go back"
"Stumbled across this place on a walk to find some store my mother wanted to go to on Monroe.  It was nice out and they had outdoor seating, so we gave it a shot.Both of us had the half sandwich and soup.  It was good, served also with fries and was plenty of food.  I don't think either one of us finished our meal but we aren't real big eaters while we are on a shopping mission!  :) Our waiter was very nice and helpful, a little slow though, as we had to walk inside for our check when it came time to leave.  It did appear that they just rotate tables versus having a section because out of the 5 tables outside there were 4 different waiters for the tables.Over all not Bad, nice location across from Mill. Park and we had the pleasure of being serenaded by some schools band across the park while dining.  Nice stop for lunch"
"Just read the other reviews, and agree with them - you may as well, since you won't find a better burger, a better wait staff, a more competent management.  I'm telling you: there's stuff happening at this place that you'll never know about, but you will love throwing a fantasy here and there as you watch exotic, beautiful women talking to men less attractive but probably employed.  Assignations?  I'd bet.  Ah... to be younger and have more teeth....  When was the last time a waiter told you to take the less expensive burger - and the reasons were cogent, thoughtful?  Oh... that Scotch egg thing - fabulous.  The dessert menu?  So good you could chant it and get donations.  Try it."
"The South Loop has been finally graced with a restaurant of the caliber that has certainly been missing in the area!  Chef Dirk Flanigan is an incredible talent, crossing cuisine influences with comfort food; the Lawless family has an absolute home run with this hot spot for both business and those who live in the neighborhood."
"A refreshing new place, great for those that work in the Loop! They have a good lunch menu, great happy hour scene and dinner menu is nice. When it first opened the service seemed top notch, but the last time I went for dinner (group of about 8, work-related), the waiter was annoyed that he couldn't get everyone's attention to read the specials and seemed to stiff us by the end of the night. Food was excellent though."
"Look, the food here is good. Go here for lunch if you are touring Chicago's better menus.  Don't waste your dinner here... there are better dinner spots."
"It's your typical touristy American food restaurant. The portions are way too big, which is always a turn off for me but the quality of the food was still pretty good.  I got  ""The Gage"" USDA Prime Burger"" which was $16.00!!!  It came with a ginormous bowl of fries, which made me full just by looking at it... But hey, you can always split the meal with a friend!"
"I've been to The Gage, just once. I interior of the place was very classy chic, yet still had a bar feel. The food on the other hand was really not so good. The menu was full of standard American fare with a bit up of upper class flair- which to me means changing cheddar to some cheese I've never heard of etc... etc... The problem though is that it doesn't work. Instead of going, ""oh that's interesting."" I ended up going, ""curry gravy on fries just makes the fries soft and taste like it has been standing under a light for a while"". The sausages were tough and small, and I ended up paying too much for the quantity and quality I received. I gave The Gage 3 stars, just for being in such a nice location (right across from Millenium Park) with a comfortable feel. It's a good hangout...maybe for a drink. I'm sure they can't screw that up."
"My fifth visit to the Gage took place tonight and all I can say is that I continue to be more impressed each time. At first glance, it looks like some kind of Irish pub-in-a-box from the street. But it would be a terrible mistake for anyone to forgo this gem based on that mistaken belief. Where to start? How about the bar? It's long, it's beautiful, it's near huge windows and it's stocked. Really stocked. With beers from around the world and around the corner, seasonal cocktails and everything in between. Even the vodka list is respectable and this would seem more of a whiskey spot. The floors are old fashioned tiles and going there somehow feels grown up- almost elegant in some strange, casual way. Also, it's huge- the front restaurant and bar area opens up into a dining room and there is yet more space downstairs, with a second bar. Anyway, onto the menu, which is divided into four sections- Firsts (starters), Seconds, Thirds and Fourths, the fourths being the largest plates. Quite frankly, anything after the Firsts easily makes a satisfying meal but what is most impressive and commendable is the uniquely delicious preparation AND I love the commitment to organic, natural meats and local ingredients. Favorites include the goast cheese tart with escargot, a scallop lunch salad with a citrus vinaigrette, and my favorite thus far, the carmelized lobster with lemon quinoa and fresh basil. Absolutely stunning!!!! I could go on and on (obviously, I already have). The only change they might consider would be to add a simple green side salad to the menu somewhere. All that richness might be better digested with a little roughage! Cheers, Gage. Keep doing what you do."
"'Expensive' is fine if you're getting good value. I just don't feel like I got a good value at The Gage.  Not often do I leave a restaurant feeling ripped off, but that's exactly how I left The Gage.  $7 for a bowl of fries?  $13 for a glass of the 'house' wine?  $6 draft beer?  Ok, the $6 beer isn't ridiculous, but it's more than I like to spend for a domestic draft.  I wanted the hangar steak (well, I wanted a filet or ribeye, but I'm not paying $38 for a steak at a pub).  Anyway, I wanted the hangar steak, but it turns out that's not  a whole portion - just an appetizer portion.  So you're supposed to pay $12 for a bowl of soup, then spend  $15 for an appetizer before spending $30+ on an entree?  Then pay too much for a beverage?  I ended up with a $10 burger.  It wasn't bad, but the bun was a bit stale.  Actually, it must  have been more than just a bit stale, as I was able to detect the stale-ness over all of the grease that was soaked up in the bottom half of the bun.  Not me.  For those prices, I expect a little more.  I'd also like a bit more of a 'formal' setting for those prices.  I don't want to be seated right off the noisy bar, crammed in a table inches from the diners on both sides of me.  We were so close, the servers bumped me every freakin' time they went to the table on either side of me.  No, sir, not for me.  Save your money.  Skip The Gage.  I suspect this place will lose the local crowd as soon as the novelty wears off, then have to rely on tourist business to stay open."
"This place was great.  I went here on a Thursday night for dinner with a coworker.  We ordered the fondue and teach had ""The Gage"" burger.  We also ordered a side of the Curry Gravy for the fries which was fantastic!  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and made excellent beer recommendations - I would definitely go back when in Chicago."
the food is awesome!
"I liked this place a lot.... was on a pub crawl with the girls,on a quest for cute men. Didn't find any here either, ( I am told by my friends the handsome man is an extinct species). But the Gage was cool. Dark with a high ceiling where you can actually have a conversation with friends.The waitress was attentive and took good care of us. Their Vodkatini was amazing, and they made it extra dirty. My friend got a mojito and plus an order of fish and chips. The tarter sauce was a tad thin.... but that's my only gripe.Mixed crowd, from professionals who work in the area to tourists having a drink..."
"It's across the street from Millennium Park. Let me repeat that, it's across the street from Millennium Park. Let me know of another place with the quality of finishes and service at this price with a similar view and I will have a visit. Until then, of the places along this stretch of Michigan Ave, this place gets my money. Beer selection is nothing short of great, though minimal when compared to other Gastropubs (which incurs a $25 cab ride to Andersonville). But that's really digging to find something.Love the downstairs as well..."
What a great place! My boyfriend and I went last night right before heading to the symphony and we both really liked it. The service was great and I was especially impressed that the owner kept checking in with us and even served us our food. He seemed very genuine and like a real host. Very cordial and friendly. My boyfriend had the lobster and quinoa dish which was amazing and I had the fish and chips which were perfectly done. There is an array of fun cocktails as well as lots of beer and wine. It can be a little noisy but that might have been because there were a ton of real Irish guys (from Ireland) by the bar.  The place sort of reminds me of something you would find in NYC. A pub but much finer.  Love the bathroom sinks downstairs too! This place is much needed for the area and I think is a great asset for Chicago.
"Scotch egg! Such a fun treat you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere.  If I returned for drinks I would order it up at the bar - delicious. It was nice to be paid a visit by a sommelier in a restaurant with a bar atmosphere.  They have quartinos -good deal for 2 to share.  Entrees are pricey, so I was glad the service was good. Friendly wait staff and host whose priority was to keep us happy.  Lively crowd at the bar, so request downstairs seating if you're looking for a quieter meal."
"I have only sat at the bar, but I have had most wonderful food and drinks while sitting at that pretty bar and the funnest most handsomest service.  (How's that for a run on sentence?)  Maybe it's because my drink tab was picked up, maybe it was because my drink tab has been picked up every time I've been there but I dig the joint.  I had the rabbit salad last time and it was perfection, tender baby greens and luscious rabbit, dreamy.  The fondue was one of those dishes you fight over who gets the last bit of cheesey goodness.  Good specialty martinis without going overboard on the sticky sweet stuff.  Nice wine list.  Great beers.  Outstanding service.  The bartenders really went out of their way to make us happy."
"I stopped in after work for a work related dinner.  It took me a while to take in all of the menu, it is quite eclectic.  Everything from duck to antelope to burgers.  The ambiance is a casual elegance.  Great for both tourists and business clients.  Of course wanting to try the unusual, tried the antelope appetizer.  It was prepared raw with a quail egg and various accompaniments.  I found the flavor very delicate and not at all what I expected, excellent!  For dinner, I had the duck confit with lentils.  Also wonderful.  Succulent without being heavy or fatty as duck can sometimes be.  The waiter helped with the wine selection and what we eneded up ordering was light and complimented everything well.  The wine was decanted and definitely opened up and brought the flavors out.  I would highly recommend The Gage for business dinners or the diner looking for the something extra along Michigan Avenue."
"I love weekend brunches and am fastidious when it comes to reviewing restaurants in this particular category. The Gage flattered to deceive. The white table cloth, gastropub may be great for power lunches/sun down socializing but didn't quite impress on the leisure brunch front. The only thing leisurely was the service - appallingly slow,except when the check was due(it helped that the guy waiting on us was rather cute so didn't mind that he needed to make multiple trips to get it right!).The menu, while sparse had some rather interesting options but about half of them, I realized were just pretty descriptions. The ""strawberry stuffed french toast"" turned out to be a bunch of cream laden slices with strawberries on the side and the giardiniera omelet was well, your average american eggs topped with tomatoes and cheese. My first mimosa went down well (at least before I looked at the price!) but the teapots looked better than the infusions inside.Granted the Gage may be quite the rave in the loop, but you may just be better served for brunch elsewhere."
"Wow, what a great lunch experience.  We stopped by for a Friday lunch, on a day off work, and checked it out.  We ate up at the bar, and the bartender was super friendly and attentive.  I had heard about the Scotch Egg appetizer, so we tried it out, and it was delicious!!  Overall, the menu was a refreshing change from your average pub food menu.  I really enjoyed my truffled ham sandwich, and my fiance loved his salmon club sandwich.  It was a great atmosphere, and if you're downtown at Millennium Park, you can't beat the location.  It's a nice alternative to the Park Grill, in my opinion.  There is a small patio out front, too, for al fresco dining."
"Eh. Visited The Gage after work a couple of weeks ago with my cousin. We sat at the bar for a minute, and then had dinner, a series of appetizers, really. Not really a summer place, given the pub food and darkness of the interior.  The location is great, considering that there has been a dearth of this type of dining experience on this particular stretch of Michigan ave. excepting the aforementioned Bennigan's. The service was pretty good. But, I was expecting something a bit more special given the reviews--something a little different or more polished would have been a treat in this tourist heavy area."
"i visit the loop at least twice a week for job related errands, and visit the usual suspects for take out: cosi's, baci's, corner bakery, and a coupla asian fast food places. i needed something special to help celebrate my co-workers birthday, so i stopped in at the gage.what a great departure from chain mediocrity and madness! great ambiance; dark wood, gorgeous bar with a great bartender. ordered beet salad with grapefruit and cheese: delish, a great open face brisket sandwich accented with apples, and a roast turkey sandwich that seemed to have actually been cut off a bird, not created in the back room of a packing company. the fries were good as well, but i really didn't like the curry sauce. maybe it's the sort of dish that doesn't translate well to take out. same goes for the french toast dessert, but the chocolate mousse cake was wonderful; light but richly flavored, though i didn't get the pretzel accompaniment. all in all, it was very tasty fare, great service, and i'm dying to go back after hours to try a martini or two. seems like the sort of place that would give a good one."
We went here for brunch. I had a really good crab and avocado omelette. And the potatoes on the side: Heavenly!!! It looks like a really cool place to hang out after work and with the recent wonderful weather: A great place to eat outside! The wait staff was also really good. I recommend it.
"I went here for a business dinner and thought it was pretty nice. Everyone I was with enjoyed their meal. The service left something to be desired though. It was not good, but the place was new and maybe they worked out some kinks. I am giving it 4 stars, but that is on a scale adjusted for restaurants in the loop. Not a whole lot of good places down here. It just may be my favorite in the loop for right now....until I get the chance to go to Everest I'm sure. lol. If you have to eat in the loop it is worth checking out."
good apps and ok beer selection
I had the fish and chips for lunch.  Man! that dish was so good that I will go back again. The service was also good.  The place seem to be a little stuffy.
