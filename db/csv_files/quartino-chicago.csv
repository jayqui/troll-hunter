Quartino
"We love this cute Italian tapas restaurant! This place is surprisingly huge! There is inside and outside seating. Although, I do recommend sitting inside since Quartino is located at a busy intersection. Their homemade bread with olive oil and vinaigrette is so good! We highly recommend ordering 2-3 dishes per person. My favorite dishes were the Soprano pizza, Veal Meatballs Napoli and Tortellini. I love how thin and crispy their pizza is. Dip the crust in the olive oil and vinaigrette, and you'll fall in love even more. The combination of the meatball with the golden raisin is quite a pleasant surprise. We loved eating the prosciutto with the tortellini. Also, you MUST get the Tiramisu. It's probably the best tiramisu I have ever had. AVOID the Angus Beef Carpaccio - it's super bland. I'm not a big fan of beets. But if you're looking for a vegetable dish, the beets are pretty good. To be honest, there is a wide variety of dishes on the menu suitable for any guest. We highly recommend it for everyone! We will definitely come back and try some more dishes!"
"As luck would have it, all the restaurants were closing on Navy Pier so I found this gem on Yelp and we took a quick bus ride into town.  From start to finish, this is one of the best meal experiences we've had, and definitely the best we had in Chicago (hailing from California and my friend from New York).The hostess was pleasant and took us to a nice table, the server was very attentive and down to earth.  We were explained that it's tapas style, however, my friend wanted a pizza and I wanted pasta w/sausage so we just ate our own, although I did steal a couple slices of the amazing Margherita pizza she had!  My pasta was ok, a bit more al dente than I'd prefer, but the sausage and light drizzle of sauce was very nice.  Either a manager, or possibly the owner came over and offered drink refills, he was very pleasant.  The server was awesome!  I wish now I had gotten his name.We topped off the meal with gelati, she had strawberry, I had chocolate.  It was soooo good!"
"Disclaimer: I may have not ordered the best items on the menu...so this is only my take on what I ordered.First time in Chicago and this place has an abundance of reviews on yelp so of course I have to stop by. My boyfriend and I split the sampler, in which we got two meats, gorgonzola+ Fontina cheese, roasted peppers, artichokes, and pickled veggies. I wasn't too impressed with anything we ordered in particular, but the pairings that our waitress brought to go with our cheeses were DELICIOUS! The Apricot puree was to die for, and I would've been perfectly fine with eating just that with our cheeses and some bread (in fact, I wish we could have just substituted that for everything else)In addition, I ordered the Soprano pizza, which came with a TON of pickled veggies on top. I think this is a love/hate sorta item and I definitely wasn't loving the pickled toppings on my veal meatball pizza. All in all, while I'm sure there are many wonderful things on their menu, I was just expecting something a little different from this place."
"Quartino is a lively neighborhood restaurant, serving Italian Tapas style. On a Thursday night, this place was packed. Every table was occupied. I really liked their outdoor dining area located at main entrance. It gave you that ""Parisian"" style atmosphere. There is also a 2nd floor where there is a private area for large groups. It is especially nice if you are dining with more than 30 guests.  I would definitely recommend ordering their Braised Pork Shank. It was so good and the meat fell off the bone. Their bar drinks here were also fantastic, smooth and strong!!If you happen to be in this neighborhood, come by and enjoy the local vibe. If you are dining for two, I'd recommend seating outdoor where you can enjoy your dinner, and feel like one of the locals!!Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"
"Quartino. We decided to dine here because it has more reviews than Elvis has sightings.  It's an Italian tapas restaurant with a good size of beer selections.  It's a couple of blocks from Mag Mile. The restaurant has two floors and the restroom is located on the 2nd floor. It baffles me why there isn't one on the first floor.  It's a very nice restaurant with a Chicago feel to it.  The service was good even though the waiter got one of our orders wrong.  However, I didn't think it was his mistake cause my friend's friend was being wishy washy on what she wanted to eat.  She didn't exactly explained what she wanted very well and I found it annoying the way she was acting when the dish came out. Plus, the trick a$$ kept calling me Steven instead Steve even after she requested to add me on FB during lunch.  Anyway, onto the cibo. That's food for people who don't speak French at an Italian restaurant. Seriously. Get a clue, folks. 1) Calamari - The batter on the Calamari was crispy and light.  The Calamari was cooked just right but my only issue was it was a bit too salty. I usually like salty food but this had me drinking my beer faster than a drunk Irish sailor. 2) Veal Sliders - This was my favorite dish out of everything we tried.  The Sliders were cooked medium rare.  It juicy, flavorful and tender.  There was a touch of marinara sauce which added a tangy zest to it and comforting taste. The bread was toasted and fluffy at the same time. 3) Beef Ribs - This was my second favorite dish.  The ribs were cooked very well and it was easy to cut.  It was really tender and full of flavor.  The meat tore apart very easily like a perfectly cooked stack of ribs where the meet falls right off the bone.  In addition, it didn't take much chewing which I like cause I don't like to put much effort into getting fat. 4) Beef Carpaccio - This was a big let down.  The Angus Beef wasn't bad but it was raw so how bad could it really be right?  I didn't think the cheese and onions went well with the Carpaccio like Kanye West at award shows. I felt it was an utter failure like people trying to get healthy every year for their new year's resolution.  Brace yourselves.  The ""New Year.  New Me"" posts are coming, folks.Overall, the food was decent but it wasn't amazing or anything unforgettable.  Would I come here again? Probably not.  We should have gone with our first choice which was the Purple Pig."
"Porcini mushroom and truffle risotto - it was so tiny! I wanted more. The truffle taste wasn't strong but I enjoyed the dish a lot; maybe because I was starving. Fungi pizza - very salty dough? I was hoping the mushrooms gave it a nice kick but it didn't. Bread with balsamic vinaigrette? This is what bread is paired with apparently..give me the butter or olive oil!! Overall, I'm not sure what's so great about this restaurant."
"Was riding solo tonight on my work trip and I decided to wander around and saw this place, looked it up on yelp and decided to come here.  This place is huge, outdoor seating, indoor seating (two floors), bar and lounge seating.  I didn't want to wait so I went to the bar.  The guy was really nice and I was able to have a decent conversation with him.  This place serves tapas and believe it or not, I was able to get half a tapa (didn't know until he said that option was available) woohoo, allowing me to try more dishes.  I had the:Polenta fries - it was fried cornmeal, the batter was a little on the heavy side but I was able to taste the flavor, not a bad dishFried calamari - was flavorful and very fresh, still thought the batter was a bit much but it was fried pretty good and crunchy.Linguine with clams - the clams were fresh and the linguine was cooked to perfection, decent portion for a tapas place.Tiramisu - very bad, there was so much powder on the tiramisu that I practically choked on the powder, it's like breathing powder up your lungs, I told the bar guy the honest truth about this (cuz he asked) and he claims to agree with me.  It is quite a vibrant place and the prices are reasonable.  If you don't mind sitting at the bar, then go for it."
"I know, I know, Chicago is the land of the deep dish pizza.  But Quartino had great reviews on Yelp and was only a block from our hotel so it kinda seemed like a no-brainer for lunch.  And it ended up being a great meal... Hubs and I started with a spinach salad w/ pears, walnuts, & ricotta salata ($7.50).  Doesn't that sound good?  I thought so - but the salad had wayyy too many walnuts and barely any slices of pear.  The dressing it was all tossed in was lovely though.  Yummy salad, despite its lack of pear.And then there was the pizza. We selected a half sausage half pepperoni and, gosh, was it good.  Chewy bubbly crust, sweet sauce, fresh melted mozzarella cheese.  So good!  And you know how sometimes you order a pizza with toppings and wonder where the toppings are.  Not at Quartino.  The entire pie was covered w/ sausage and pepperoni.  A pizza and salad are both good sizes if you wanted to share w/ your date. Everything was really good and filling, yet we didn't leave feeling heavy.  On my next visit to Chicago I'm totally going back to Quartino!A few other things of note - The place is huge!  There's tables outside on the patio, two bars, a main dining room downstairs and another upstairs. Its also beauuutiful inside.  It was one of the more authentic Italian restaurants I've been to with its open kitchen, rustic simple finishes, bread and slicer situated right in the middle of the dining room.  That bread was really good too.Restrooms are located upstairs and past the 2nd bar.  And they are just as beautiful as the rest of the place."
"Lovely outdoor seating! Order:Baby Spinach SaladTortelliniSausage Risotto******favThe food was delicious - great flavor and decent portions, especially the sausage risotto. We came here for a late lunch/quick bite and our server was very nice and sped up the order for us. All in all, if you happen to be around the area and start feeling hungry, Quartino is a solid choice. Might come back for their $25 three course menu for two."
"Quartino is Italian small plates. You get multiple dishes and share them among friends. You can also large carafes of wine (the wine we chose was $20/liter). We went to Quartino with a group of 7 girls. Our server was super friendly and greeted us quickly. He came by often so we could order multiple rounds of small plates. Service was attentive. We always had water and bread even though th restaurant was full of lots of people celebrating. Everything we ordered was very good. We had bruschetta, tortellini, wine, eggplant Parmesan, pizza, dessert, and more. Our server made great recommendations and helped pick out special things for our group. I thought that my dinner was reasonable. It was $30 including tip and alcohol and dessert (we even had house made Limoncello- very good). My only compliant is that the restaurant is very loud. It was difficult to hear the people across the table, and I like to be able to talk to my friends over dinner. I would get reservations here and get the margarita pizza! Yum!"
"I wanted to like Quartino more than I did. I'm hovering between 3 and 4 stars, but to be honest, they're more like 3.25 stars, so I gotta round down!First and foremost, if you want to come here, make a reservation, even if it's a weeknight. My sister and I visited on a weeknight and the entry area was chaotic with people wanting to get a table and the place was hoppin'. We were definitely glad to be in the minority of people who actually made reservations.Our service was friendly, but spotty. We each ordered the tomato soup to start, but they brought them out one by one, so that my sister was almost done with hers by the time mine arrived. That seemed really odd. The soup was really good with nice chunks of tomato floating in a thick tomato puree. My sister also ordered a couple of veggie dishes and I ordered the Bianca Pizza, all of which came out relatively close together. My sister like her veggie items, but the potato puree she ordered was just too rich for her to eat much of it. My Bianca Pizza was ok, but not spectacular. They overdid it on the onions which would have been much better if they had been caramelized and the other ingredients, rosemary and chilis, were too sparse. I ended up taking most of it back to my hotel for breakfast and then ended up dumping most of the leftovers in the garbage because I just couldn't stomach more of it. Our waiter took my sister's potato puree off the tab, which was nice. She hadn't actually complained about it and we would have been happy to pay for it. My sister gave me some cash to help cover her portion and I gave our waiter the cash and my credit card and he agreed to charge the difference between the bill and the cash tendered. When the credit card receipt was presented, the cash was gone and he had charged the entire amount of the bill to my card. I would like to think the best of people, but I kinda think he was hoping I wouldn't notice so he could pocket the cash. He did rerun my card, so I'm hoping it went through correctly and there are not duplicate charges. I will know in a few days. This is a restaurant that I think probably has potential to be great, but the service was off and food wasn't consistently great. Next time I visit, I definitely will not make a beeline for Quartino."
"Keeping it simple this time... Ranked in order:1. Campania pizza - founduta and house made ricotta. Enough said, amazing! I will be back to just sit at the bar and have this pizza. 2. Prosciutto San Daniele - guess why I picked it? It was so soft, thin and luxurious I couldn't stand it. 3. Steamed Clams - Pinot Grigio and red chili broth. Not too strong but strong enough and the bread for dipping is wonderful. 4. Asiago Vecchio - lovely cheese, make sure you pair it with the apricot. 5. Manzo pizza - short rib was super flavorful, pesto was amazing but a little too much fennel for my taste. 6. Polenta Fries - they are what they say, polenta. The dipping sauce is needed. I guess I wanted these badly because so many people posted on yelp but I wouldn't go back for those. Much better options on the menu! Lastly. Wine, service and atmosphere made me happy. We will return!"
"This is an extremely buzzing place! I have been here thrice and each time had to a good time. The atmosphere is hip, people are chik and food is slick!This was my first time visiting with my family. Ordered vegetarian dishes. 2 out of 3 dishes were good. The bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar never fails. Service is fast, family style dining, a must visit place!"
"This place was recommended to us by our hotel bartender. We called to make reservations but they said they didn't have any availability till after 10pm (we called shorty after 5pm).  We decided to be adventurous and chance it hoping to get two spots at the bar, we lucked out got a table! So much for an after 10pm reservation. Lol  we were glad we chanced it because it was a great meal.  Loved how they leave a whole bottle of tap water at the table! I hate waiting for water refills when I'm thirsty.  We had great service and fun lively atmosphere. Definitely a busy place upstairs and downstairs. We intended on saving room for dessert since I viewed some great pictures on yelp, but in the end we were way too stuffed from everything else.  -veal sliders 4/5-calamari 5/5-shrimp 5/5-shrimp risotto 4.5/5-spaghetti and meatballs 3.5/5 Everything was small plate style which allowed us to try a bunch of items.  Love that. Overall 4.5, would go back."
I realized that I had eaten at the top 5 yelpiest places in Chicago except for this so I had to get this as my last dinner. I was quite excited because Davanti was legit. I made reservations for a Monday night but it wasnt necessary at all since it is hugeee. I vote Davanti.1) Polenta fries- it was just a thick fried thing so I wouldnt get it. 2) Gnocchi- This was carby and filling but I didnt prefer it. 3) Veal Meatballs- I loved the meatballs at Davanti but these were just not flavorful or as good as I would hope so.4) Mushroom Pizza- this was pretty decent and what I mostly ate since I like mushrooms. 5) Cauliflower- this was just a head of cauliflower. It was actually not good or flavorful so I would definitely pass.6) Seafood pasta- You can choose between red or white sauce. We chose white but I still didnt find it very flavorful. It did have quite a few bits of seafood.
The food was amazing and our set Francesca was so awesome. Very attentive and super friendly. Would highly recommend to anyone.MUST TRY the desert ~ profiteroles ! See pic attached
"It's an ok place.  Food was decent, but not a big wower.  Atmosphere, outdoor area is good, indoors is not appealing."
"I'm extremely torn on writing anything about this place. On the one hand, our visit here was a mess. On the other hand, we received abundant apologies from one of the restaurant group's managers Alysia. In terms of post-dinner customer service, this place deserves more than two stars for their effort to change our impression. But, for the dinner-as-experienced, this place still earns a Yelp ""Meh. I've experienced better.""We ate here late, after missing the kitchen at another restaurant during our recent visit to Chicago. It wasn't our first pick and a veteran of many a late-night eat, I tend to keep expectations fairly low no-matter the star-level because, well, staff get tired, people want to go home, etc, etc and so forth. Even so, our visit here started out reasonable. They have outdoor seating and we were seated back towards what *is* an active driveway. Okay, not ideal. But, did I mention we were extremely hungry? Our server explained the menu to us - Italian tapas, communal serving, no control of the order dishes come to the table. Fine, fine, sounds good to us. But, the initial ordering was the beginning and end of consistent interaction with the staff.To start we ordered, three dishes for the table. One broccoli rabe side order, one fettucine alfredo, one stracci di grano arso. As we had never been here before and were unsure of the portion size to anticipate, we kept the initial order light. The broccoli rabe came out speedily enough. Parts of it were burnt to a crisp, not charred, while other parts were slimey. It wasn't great, it wasn't good, but, it wasn't awful either. Just inconsistent in texture in a non-pleasing way. Eh, fine, onwards. Second order: was plunked down by a woman who seemed ridiculously harried to get back to wherever she had came from. It felt like she threw it down on the table and disappeared. This was the fettucine alfredo. My grandmother always said fettucine alfredo is not a ""true italian"" dish, it's a bastard american cousin. Even so, this second dish was hardly anything American or Italian. The noodles weren't 'al dente' they were just straight undercooked and clumped together in a fashion you'd see from someone who had only today learned to cook pasta. Parts of them were hard, parts of them were soft. My dining partner said the sauce tasted ""doughy"", like in a rush they had thickened it with too much flour. And to make perhaps the most pedantic complaint of all (so pedantic I'm cringing at myself), these noodles were pappardelle. There are philosophical arguments about what is fettuccine, what is tagliatelle, what is pappardelle and what belongs in fettucine alfredo - as they're all wider-flat noodles. But, what I can tell you is a super-thick undercooked-over-floured sauce is pretty unpleasant with partially cooked thicker-than-the-average-fettucine noodles all congealed into an inedible clump. This dish wasn't pleasing at all. But, as I said before, we were hungry and it was late.Third plate: The third plate never came. An apology about the third plate never coming did come. But, by then we had pretty much formed the impression something here was broken tonight. Because of the way their ordering process works you really have no way of knowing if the kitchen is backed up and taking a long time or, as in our case, they've forgotten you completely and sent your dish to another table by mistake. Pros: -Their kitchen was open when we were visitingCons: -In the spirit of being true to yelp, we didn't have a very good meal here. Or really enough to count as a meal here. We ordered three dishes, were served two barely edible ones and a third was forgotten about by the staff and/or misdirected to another table. That said, we were abundantly compensated for our time and negative experience with apologies, comped half-dinner and a gift card to come back and try them again next time. I've only very rarely seen such active image management at anywhere other than the finest restaurant in New York. For being so attentive post-dinner they really deserve all the stars. However, the whole experience did make me wonder if they retain such high yelp rating through effective 'damage control' or if we really did catch the fluke-of a fluke-of a fluke, of an evening. We have a gift card. I can't say whether or not we'll be back next time we're in the Chicago area. Our experience was fairly disappointing."
"I met a family member here for dinner, and was surprised how packed it was.  As a tourist visiting Chicago for the first time, this wasn't the type of restaurant I thought Chicago was known for, and when my ten year old son saw the wine bottle sign, he thought it was a bar. They seated us right away (I had made a reservation) and we had a truly amazing meal.  Fantastic service, with attentiveness I have had in only a few restaurants.  Seriously, they were on all the needs of the table. The atmosphere was loud, but comfortable.  Seems to be all types, all ages, from office workers to people on a date, to families.  Tried the duck flatbread, a fantastic kale salad, and a few other things including a pasta dish that was fantastic.  Really a great experience all the way around."
"Italian food has never been anything so special to me (always just satisfying, not mind blowing) but Quartino has been a restaurant I find myself coming back to again and again: perfect for date night, ladies night, large groups, small groups. It's Italian food tapas-style, which makes it even more fun. The ambiance is adorable, not too quiet or loud, candles, and the waiters wear soccer jerseys.Some of my favorites:- Shrimp Risotto: Great portions of shrimp, good textured risotto.- Angus Carpaccio: Fresh, light, and an amazing appetizer to share. Always seem to get this.- Veal meatballs: Loved these!- Linguine and clams: Never had this but my boyfriend loves it with the white wine sauce.- Tortellini: Served with prosciutto, peas, and alfredo sauce... heavy but delicious.- Tagliatelle: Wonderful wonderful.- Profiteroles & Fondue: Fun desserts, good portions for the price!Honestly you cannot go wrong here given the variety, great service, and fun atmosphere. The prices are great for the quality of food."
My wife and I stopped in here for lunch on a weekend and it was not busy at all. Less than a year ago we went on our honeymoon to Italy and I almost felt like I was back there a bit with some of the food and décor. Overall we really enjoyed this place from the cheese plate to the amazing ravioli. Nice chunks of delicious cheese that we pretty much could have just chowed on alone. The slider was good but kind of small for what you get I suppose. That was really the only complaint though. I would definitely come back to Quartino to try more.
"Very tasty food, and excellent service.We sat at an outdoor patio on the weekend, which can get busy. Can't comment on the interior as we sat outdoors the entire time. The wine is a little pricy. Eggplant parmesan is delicious, one of the best I had in Chicago. We also tried the fettuccine alfredo, which wasn't bad either. Overall, definitely recommend trying this place out if you're in the neighborhood."
"Quartino is a high quality, tapas-style Italian place, so if you're on a budget, it is key to note that some of the dishes are available as half portions (mostly pasta and seafood plates)! This means you can try more things without sacrificing too much financially! Of course, Quartino is still by no means cheap. For my friend and I, our bill still came out to be ~$50 (with tax and tip) for 3-4 plates and a 1/2 liter of wine. But everything we ate was phenomenal! My personal favorites were the roasted baby octopus and the duck prosciutto. The baby octopus was tender, well seasoned, and served alongside some greens. Such magic. The duck prosciutto was served in tiny pieces, but each bite was so deliciously fatty and flavorful that we were able to make it last for quite awhile.Ultimately, this is worth the visit. Think you'll still be hungry? You can always stuff yourself with free bread (the college student way), or plan to come here for a pre-dinner snack."
"Really nice place, best for a doble date ir group if six, since to get to try a lot of dishes and flavors. Wine is great price, we got a montepulciano and we liked a lot, sliced salad, baby spinach salad, asparagus risotto, salmon, gnochi ( my least favorite) home made sausage, all were great and Michael the manager made us tried the zepolle and was good( not my favorite dessert since i dont care for deep fried) convinient fir us since we stayed at the embassy suites on state.A must try place... And the hostess were all great... Nice blonde smiles"
"Folks, this place must be resting on its 4 star rating because this was a well below average experience. For the record, I sat at the bar. For starters, I've had better customer service at the DMV. The only consistency was the poor attentiveness. FYI, there was hardly a soul at the bar, and for that matter, the restaurant. The caprese was pretty crummy. Mozzarella was whatever and the tomatoes looked like, and tasted, like they were a week old. I ordered the ""homemade"" the lamb sausage pizza. The crust tasted like bread stick. The rest was just tasteless. My Barbara was at least good but then that has nothing to do with the restaurant."
"I arrived at 8pm. They said it would be a 30min wait for a party of 2. Luckily we went inside and found seating at the bar. The bar isn't only the bar table, the random small tables to the right of the bar table includes the bar room. Full menus and amazing service. The bread was so delicious. Soft and moist. Be sure to ask for vinegar because they don't give it to you unless requested. The short rib was so small. It was very soft and the meat just melted in my mouth. The problem with this was that it was somewhat bland. There wasn't as much flavor as I had hoped. 6/10 on this We also ordered the linguine with clams. The clams were awesome. Get the white rather than red. This was yummy. Extremely oily and greasy but good nonetheless. I don't think I would come back because it wasn't anything spectacular that I couldn't find in Los Angeles, CA but it's a good experience."
"I had high expectations for Quartino but I'm not sure I was blown away by the food or the atmosphere. The food was just okay but nothing that other tapas bars can't replicate or execute better. We ordered some of the more popular dishes like polenta fries, veal sliders, shrimp and sausage risotto.  My favorite was probably the polenta fries since I've never had it presented that way before. It also came out piping hot which was a plus. Veal sliders were decent and my friends seem to liked them quite a bit.  I was not as impressed with the infamous pork shank. Ours came out dry and was tough overall.  It tasted a lot like leather after chewing my way through my first bite. However, as I got to the center of the shank, it got better and the meat did indeed slide off the bone. My biggest gripe though, is the seating arrangement. I get that restaurants want to utilize their real estate as much as possible, especially when they're likely paying both arms and legs for competitive spaces smack-dab in the middle of downtown.  However, this place takes it up a notch as you can probably taste the food of tables around you if you tried hard enough.  Again, I don't blame them for doing this to accommodate their large volume of customers but I had hoped for a less intimate experience with the foodies that night."
"Wanted to take my wife some place special for our Pre-anniversary dinner date and chose Quartino. We came here on time and were seated immediately. We were first given a small table which was good enough to place just glasses and glass water bottle, hence my wife requested a bigger table and we were offered one which was kind of them. The place was pretty loud and was crowded (it was Saturday night so not surprised). We ordered pizza, egg plant Parmesan, polenta fries, and the white bean and garlic dip. Of these the pizza was good, polenta fries was average and white bean dip was average. The egg plant Parmesan was not anything great, i have definitely had better. Though we were so full I wanted to get some desert to make us feel happy :PSo ordered the Torta al Cioccolato, which was like s scoop of venilla ice-cream on top of molten hot chocolate cake. That was really yummy and we both loved it. On the whole the place had great ambiance, great service, average food and great desert options."
"Our last meal in Chicago and what a great find!We went straight for the salumeria tasting for two for obvious reasons.  You can find pizzas and pastas everywhere, but rarely you encounter a place that cure their own meats on site.  And it was divine!  The duck prosciutto, truffle salame, Sicilian caponata were just superb.  All that paired with dry crisp proseco and sitting by the side walk, was just perfect.  The service was fantastic, attentive and helpful.The price was super reasonable too.  Good luck trying for find anything of that caliber in SF for that price.  I only wish I had more room in my stomach to try their tortellini..., and not having wasted my money and time w/ the deep dish pizzas.   But what a pleasant find.  Very very happy w/ them.Food: 5/5Service: 5/5Price: 5/5Ambiance: 5/5 (this place is just amazing! It has the old school charm and class but modern quality and sanitation).  Love it love it love it!"
Great pizza. Thin crispy pepperoni. The olive plate was also good. They have professional and friendly staff. They took extra measure to find us can coke. I love this place.The ambiance is very Italian. I had one of the best pizza.
I really wanted to love this but it was just ok. After returning from Italy no pizza has been able to please me and theirs also didn't rise to the occasion but their pasta dishes were pretty good. Had a shot of lemonchello that was just ok as well.
"This is a great Italian restaurant in the city. Everything is shareable and delicious. Our waiter was very nice and patient with our questions, since it was our first time visiting!While we were seated on their front patio we experience flocks of bachelorette parties. We got the following...Appetizers: ~Fried calamari- very meaty and tender, just right. Not too much batter. ~Bacon wrapped dates- nice crisp outside, tasty cheese on the inside, right amount of sweetness. Mouthgasmic combination!!!!!!Entrees:~Spaghetti & meatballs- for such a simple dish... this was AMAZING!!! The marinara sauce was full of flavor and tasted very fresh and homemade! ~Linguini & Clams~ I got the red wine sauce. It had some tomatoes, sliced peppers, sliced garlic, and yummy clams!-Shrimp Risotto- it was alright.. It's like porridge. I won't be getting this againDessert: ~Banana Ice Cream with Fried Banana & Biscotti- DELICIOUS!!! Sweet, of course, and a nice combination of textures. ~Molton Chocolate Soufflé with a scoop of vanilla ice cream- delectable creamy and velvety chocolate center that takes you to chocolate heaven. If you're a chocolate lover like myself, this is a must!"
"Quartino was definitely one of those restaurants that took my breathe away in Chicago.  There's not many places I can say that about, but everything about Quartino was absolutely perfect.  From the fact that it's an Italian *Tapas* restaurant to friendly, helpful, and beyond informative wait staff, to amazingly affordable and inexpensive prices for fabulous food - it was absolutely the best of the best.  My friend, Breanna B., and I met for lunch when we both conveniently happened to be in Chicago and Quartino seemed to be the place to go because the menu was super inviting and there was an excessively affordable deal of $25 for a 2-person 3-course lunch.  Little did we know how blown away we'd be with the food and service we were given.  From the most spectacular homemade silky, smooth ricotta with the crustiest-but-soft homemade bread to delicious polpette veal meatballs in a rich and vibrant tomato sauce (one where you could actually taste real tomatoes and not that tin-like taste you get from the can!), to a perfectly moist and succulent half-roast lemon herb chicken, everything was seasoned and cooked to the most penultimate degree. On top of that, our waiter gave us recommendations on the menu, kept our glasses full, and even told us of some menu secrets to give us a wider range of options to choose from and taste.  We even got to watch him slice the table ciabatta baguette in the most amusing auto-bread slicing machine in the back too!  It was a truly slice of pure heaven.  So I guess it probably makes sense when I say I will probably remember Quartino for as long as I live.  When you're put face-to-face with quality as good as this where not a single flaw could be found, it's something that just sticks with you.  And It's ridiculously easy to get to too since it's maybe only a block or two down from the Grand Red station!  Because of that, along with the reasons mentioned above, I will probably be making it a point to stop here on all future Chicago visits."
"I've been to Quartino 3 times now and have had a great experience each time. The staff is always attentive and kind and the food is great. I don't think there is a single dish I've had here that I didn't like. One of my favorites are their polenta fries. The first time I came was late at night with a large group of people, the second time with a smaller group, and the third time with just one other person. The level of service and attention we received each time was the same and that's one of the main reasons (the food too, of course) that I would keep returning to this restaurant in the future."
"This is one of those places I don't frequent often, but when I do I wonder why I don't come here more. We were striking out left and right on Cinco De Mayo and decided to come here. Glad we did! We were able to seat ourselves right a way in the bar area.Service was great. We decided to go for a half and half pizza. Haft with meatballs and the other half veggie. Crust is thin and crispy and the toppings were fresh and delicious!"
"Blah. Another Chicago spot that I am not sure why the reviews are so fantastic. We were packed like sardines (6 of us) into a room upstairs that had the feel of a pool hall. It was SO loud in there that the next day, some of us had lost our voices from screaming across the table the whole night. It sucked. Nothing on the menu really sounded that great to me at the time and I ordered the tomatoes caprese. It was good- but really how hard is that to make? No one in my party said their food was anything to write home about. We had a good server is about the only real positive thing I can say. Big fat bummer."
"So obsessed with this place. I live in the area and come here any chance I get. The penne alla vodka is divine, as is the selection of cheeses. They have an awesome Napa Meritage, but check out the entire wine list as they have some GREAT bottles.As others have said, this place is perfect for groups and dates alike. Interior is nice and service is excellent. Last time I was here our server gave us complementary glasses of their house-made limoncello after we finished our meal.Don't skip dessert! Especially the chocolate cake."
"Quartino!! So finally an Italian restaurant after few months of break... Quartino definitely lived up to all the reviews. Great food and a busy busy place- but considering it was a Friday night, it's a good thing. Highly recommend- Polenta Fries, ear shaped pasta with the sausage sauce (yum yum) and my fav Campania pizza!!"
"I really liked Quartino! There were a lot of options. We started off with the Salumeria Tasting - Parmigiano Reggiano Vacche Rosse (this has a very chalky, interesting texture, my sister and friend didn't like this one but I LOVED it), Fontina Val D'Aosta, Salamette, Prosciutto San Daniele, Sicilian Caponata (I really liked this dish), Roasted Beet Salad, and Artichokes Campobasso. We ordered the sausage pizza. I don't eat pizza (I'm not from Chicago so it's forgivable). I took one slice and it wasn't bad, not like amazing but still good. For the entrees, we shared the Beef Short Ribs and the Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare. The Beef Short Ribs was really tender and tasted good. The Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare is pot of various seafood (shrimp, clam, squid, octopus, and whitefish) simmering inside a thick tomato based broth. It was very, very, very salty. I love seafood so to my surprise I did not enjoy this dish as much as I thought I would. I paired everything with a glass of Malbec. For dessert, I tried the vanilla, lemon, and strawberry sorbets. My favorites were the Salumeria Tasting and the Sorbets. I know I should choose the main entree dishes not like an appetizer or dessert as my favorite, but I felt like the entrees did not stand out to me. Everything tasted good but not amazing. I really enjoyed the Salumeria Tasting though so if I ever go back to Quartino I think I would order everything on their Salumi, Formaggi, and Spuntini menu."
"Came here for a friends birthday dinner with 9 ladies, and we loved this place! It was tapas style... the Italian way! Can't say no to that. The atmosphere and vibe got us excited the minute we walked in! All the tables are really close so the restaurant is quite loud but everyone looks like they're having a blast. We had dinner at 8:30pm on a Friday, so we expected there to be a crowd. The food and drinks were fantastic. We shared 2 liters of wine: one red and one white. The toscana red wine was my favorite. As far as the food, our waiter knew there was 9 of us and 1 vegetarian so he made sure everyone got the try everything when it came out.We ordered:1) Campinia pizza (ricotta basil tomato): amazing!2) Polenta fries: a little too plain for my taste.. basically a huge grainy fry3) Eggplant Parmigiana: cheesy and delicious. not the best eggplant I've ever had, but still delicious. 4) Burrata and beets: I'm not a fan of burrata but the beets and mint were delicious. The meat dishes were Pancetta-wrapped dates and pappardelle pasta which were both devoured by the party. The service was fast and attentive, our waiter was knowledgeable about our taste and really catered to our party despite the crowd. He even suggested the best part of the night - the birthday girl's ""cake"". Usually reserved for bachelorette parties, this cake was a dose of humor and absolutely DELICIOUS. take a look at my picture for more information :) Overall, fantastic food and service for an incredibly reasonable price and we were all stuffed afterwards."
"Quartino is a tapas style restaurant where everything that you order is meant to be shared with your group. Obviously you don't have to do things that way, but that's the main gist of the place.I came here with my family, and we ended up getting the Margherita pizza, veil, prime roast rib, and tortellini. Overall, the food was good. My favorite dish was the tortellini Alfredo with prosciutto. For dessert we had the Zeppoli with Nutella. (Fried dough) The service of the food was okay. It did take a while for dishes to come out, and it didn't help that we kept filling up on bread. On the bright side, the bread was absolutely amazing. The tables had oil with sea salt. You can ask for cheese separately, in which the waiters give you your own grated cheese device. The cheese is Pana Di Grana, which is something completely new to me. (And I'm Italian!)The ambiance of the restaurant was very packed. For being a Sunday night, we were so close together, we could hear conversations from other tables. It sometimes felt a little claustrophobic to the point that I wanted some fresh air or had to distract myself with my phone from the amount of people being backed into a dining room. Our waiter, Adam, was really nice and answered all of our questions thoroughly. It was cool seeing him and the staff wearing Italian sports jerseys. Quartino's feels like the place you go to when you can't check out your local Italian grocery store for the same products. Maybe I'm just missing the bandwagon on it. While the food was good, I wouldn't come back here for the tapas style service."
"Visited with my 3 girlfriends on a Saturday night at 8:30pm. We arrived a little late but were seated promptly. I couldn't help but notice how large the restaurant was with seating upstairs, downstairs, and the outside patio. Our server was great and very attentive. We ordered penne alla vodka, cavatelli, and spaghetti pomodoro with a margarita pizza for a side. Our food was so delicious and truly authentic Italian. Prices were extremely reasonable between $9-$10 for our plates. The portions are on the smaller;however would have been great to get a few different items to split. I did take off a star because our food was brought out at different times as soon as it is ready. This is not a problem; however, my two friends were served their pasta and completely finished theirs before mine was even served. It made for a very long and drawn out dinner waiting for food to arrive and watching others eat. Overall I would return, but I will keep that factor in mind."
"Had an awesome meal here! Went on Saturday night at 6:30 and got a table without a wait.For a table of 2 we left full (with leftovers), our bill was under $60 (with a bottle of wine!), and we loved the food!We had:-Polpette al sugo di pomodoro (veal meatballs in tomato sauce with fresh ricotta on top)-Dates wrapped in pancetta-Asiago cheese and olive assortment-Gnocchi (with a different preparation)Everything was awesome...except the olives. Just don't order them. Weird, gross flavors, bad textures, etc. Don't waste your time. Everything else, A+!Server was attentive, helpful, and pleasant.Would say I wish the plates had come out together because it would have been nice to eat the dates with the meatballs, rather than just eating a bunch of dates... but everything was so good we didn't mind :)Thanks Quartino! We will be back!"
"Well, color me happy! Quartino is a refreshing change of pace from all the other high-brow and overpriced Chicago restaurants that I've been frequenting. This place is affordable, fun and most importantly, delicious! Came here with a large group for a friends birthday and we were all thrilled with our experience.The server was extremely helpful and let us know that this tapas bar was the kind of place to order and share a bunch of dishes, which we did, happily. We had a table of 9, so he was accommodating when certain dishes only had 6 servings and he let us know in advance so we could get one and half orders or whatnot. First, we got two bottles of wine - one red, one white. They came out in interesting bottles and glasses, but as long as it tasted good, then we didn't really care. There was also freshly made bread for the table (always a crowd pleaser). Here's a rundown of what we ordered and had bites of:1. Pancetta-wrapped dates: a little on the sweeter side for me but the birthday girl loved them!2. Campinia pizza (ricotta basil tomato): tasty but nothing extraordinary, great thin crust though.3. Polenta fries: really hyped up on Yelp, but, personally, it tasted kinda bland. The sauce was zesty and made the dish but the fries were kind of a  thicker, mushier version of french fries?4. Pappardelle pasta: The flavors of the braised short rib was unexpected but quite interesting-everyone was a fan of this dish!6. Eggplant Parmigiana: Let's be real, this dish is all about the cheese. I think there's eggplant somewhere underneath, but that glorious cheese just won't give it a chance to shine.7. Burrata and beets: I don't get why this dish is all the rage lately, but no matter where I order this, I just can't get on board.But the favorite of the night was the dessert. We secretly asked our waiter for a birthday surprise at the end of the night and what a surprise we got! What arrived was some creampuffs and a banana in a -ahem- phallic arrangement (oh yes, I posted a picture). The birthday girl thought it was hilarious and even better, it was delicious! The eight of us split the check (excluding the birthday girl) and were all pleasantly surprised with the total - so affordable!"
"We were told that we'd have an hour wait on a Wednesday night and it turned out to only be about 25 minutes. But I guess that's better than the other way around! I like that this place feels fun and casual, yet the food uses high-quality ingredients and is presented with class. We started with veal meatball sliders. Very tender veal and I liked the chopped giardieniera; it added just the right amount of spice. Also, the beef carpaccio was really enjoyable. Perfectly pink, sliced paper thin, and a lot of shaved reggiano cheese and some shaved celery. The linguini with clams was solid, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and the sauce had plenty of butter and garlic. Needed a little S&P to balance it out. The Artesian sausage and peppers was pretty good. I liked the red sauce as it wasn't too heavy or overwhelming. The sausage had a pretty distinctive fennel flavor; it was fine, but I've had some better. The shrimp risotto was nice and hearty and believe me, they did not skimp on the shrimp. The zucchini and sun dried tomatoes complemented the shrimp but didn't distract from it, so the dish was well-balanced. Also, the Tucan kale salad may hvae been the best surprise of the meal. Organic cherry tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and plenty of pecorino cheese made  this the best kale dish I've ever had. this is a must-get. The rigatoni wasn't too good though. It had burrata cheese and a lamb ragu, so it was a darker red sauce. I enjoyed the addition of the lamb, but the combination of flavors was a little too heavy and the dish just had a salty flavor to it. For dessert, we did zeppole. They were incredibly light and airy. And dipped in that honey, it just made eating them even more fun! Cinnamon sugar might take them over the top though!I like that you can grate your own Gran Padana cheese at the table, I've never seen this anywhere else. The servers were very friendly and helped guide us through the menu and wine list. It's also kind of cool that they wear soccer jerseys. The prices were pretty fair, it came to $130 for three of us, including a bottle of red wine. Very good overall experience and I would consider returning if I was in the area."
"This is a great group spot whether you're celebrating a friend's birthday or need a place for a work dinner. It is Italian style tapas and everything is definitely made to be shared. If you go with a group of 5-6 work with the waiter to ensure you order enough food, some things you may want to get doubles of, but remember you can always put in another order! We always accidentally order way too much food!There are lots of different options so make sure you try the salads, pasta, pizza, and definitely don't forget to try the desert!"
"While the service was good, I was not impressed with the food here.  My friend and I shared the vegetarian pizza (very bland and ""blah""), white bean dip (decent), and polenta fries (also decent, but nothing special).  None of the dishes really stood out, and nothing was particularly flavorful.The service was friendly, attentive, and prompt.I met a friend for lunch on a Monday, and the location was pretty dead.Given the positive reviews, I came expecting more and left a bit disappointed."
"This place is basically Italian tapas. All plates are small in portion and meant to be shared. That being said the 4-5 that we had were very very good. Calamari and veal meatball sliders were excellent and the homemade pasta was awesome as well.Would recommend for small or large groups, as its a great place to share plates. Would visit again!"
"I've been to Quartino a few times over the years and every time I get super excited to go but then leave a little disappointed. The good:- The restaurant is lively, loud, and fun and good for large groups. Love the old Italian style and the silly movies they play on the TVs - The concept of Italian tapas is great - Wine selection is pretty extensive with a wide variety of reds and whites in different price ranges and quantities The could-be-better:- Overpriced for quantity and quality of food- Service has always been strictly okay. Given the large size of the establishment, I'm sure the servers are running around all over the place. But it's honestly extremely difficult to catch any of them when you need something. - The pizzas are good but not the best or most authentic I've had. - White bean and garlic spread - somewhat blah. Not enough garlic, which is a tragedy.- Veal meatballs - these were good, as long as you don't mind meat paired with sweet things (golden raisins). - Ravioli Filled with Braised Pork, Speck, & Fava Beans - this was delicious, but rather pricey for the quantity of ravioli you get- Linguine with Clams: again, good but not mind blowing- Eggplant Parmigiana: really tasty, but (you guessed it) not the best I've hadOverall, Quartino's is a fun place to go with a group to share bits of everything. It won't be the best Italian food you'll eat but it's fine!"
"What can I say about Quartino's? I have been coming here since 2011 and the food still remains exceptional. The wine, phenomenal! And the services, the best in Chicago.The wine list is so extensive that I feel as though I would need an entire month of regular visitation to sample it all! And, this is a good thing!I came here for an afternoon lunch with a friend on a Thursday afternoon and my friend was sold on the place. Our waiter, who became Manager during his shift with us was amazing. He even gave us his new manager card and promised a complimentary prosecco upon our next visit. We nearly ate our way into the ER, the food was so good.I would give this gem 10 Stars if it were possible. Well done Quartino! You have outdone yourself yet again."
"Did a bachelorette dinner here with 18 gals! Great service and food as usual.  Great spot for vegetarians and the meat eaters are well taken care of as well. They have a great party package for 40 that includes house red and white wine! There was some oddities toward the end of service that decreased the 5 star rating to a 4 star rating.  The check had to be revised 3 times before it was accurate and the shrimp entree came out at the same time as the tiramisu dessert.  That was the other oddity.  Other than that, this spot has been a solid fave of ours for a decade!"
"Stopped by as this place seemed crowded and has a nice outside area. Just had profiteroles and drinks. It is really good, but the waiter is not very friendly."
"Everything is better by the quart. Why? Because.. There are three more quarts to make one. I love Quartino and their small plate concept and alcohol by the quart/half liter/liter. It is perfect for sharing and trying.I have been here a bunch of times with a bigger group and with just another person. It's definitely different experiences between the two and I had much more fun coming here with a bigger group. You can order a crapload of various plates and shared a liter of drink, or two. It ended up to be not so much at the end. When I came here with just another person, you tend to over order and the check gets to be more pricy.I was here last Saturday with family and there were six of us. We had so much fun sharing the salumi platter, the manzo pizza, a couple of pasta dishes, the calamari, etc. The calamari was to die for! Big ass and fat round of squids fried to sheer perfection in my eyes. It was one of the best ever calamaris I have ever had! The pappardelle pasta with the braised short ribs ragout was also my fave! The pizza looked like a neapolitan brick oven style, but the crust was nice and intact. There wasn't any wet part. It was pretty damn yummy. The drinks.. Mh.. I came here for the Bellini. I am not a huge drinker but I'd let my face get warmed and red for their Bellini. While waiting for my party to come, I patiently waited with a half liter of Bellini. They came and finished my half liter. Good thing, we ordered some more.For desserts, we ordered the Zeppole served with honey and dark chocolate sauce that was worthy of a Soprano episode.The service was fast and it's cool that way as you weren't afraid to order just enough as you could always order more and it wouldn't take forever. Our server was pleasant and accommodating and she was on it like white on rice about refilling our bread. I gave four stars because I'm a fan. I didn't give five stars because some of the foods I had better elsewhere. It didn't mean it's bad, but it didn't mean five stars either. Plus, I think $40 for a liter of Bellini was very pricy.We all had fun getting together, sharing some grubs and caught up on the latest in life. It was a fine Saturday lunch."
This place has amazing food and great service. I loved the Tortellini with prosciutto and my cousins favorite was the ravioli filled with braised pork and topped with speck.  The pizza was amazing as well. Our waiter Scott gave us great suggestions and we got to do half orders of some of the dishes so we got to try more of their amazing food!  Everything he suggested was perfect and he was super fun!I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and go there again myself.
Fantastic Pizza fresh ingredients.Tastes authentic too true Italian comparative to my Italian Trips to Rome.A Must Try!
"So glad I made reservations! This placed was jam packed. And I can see why after having to be rolled out of there. The food was DELIC! The tomato soup was the best out of the 7 courses we ordered. I wish I could ship some home. We ordered the sampler platter and had it hand picked by our waitress, Alessandra (which by the way is top notch! If you go here make sure to ask to sit in her section!). Next was the soup, and then shrimp risotto, gnocchi, penne vodka, broccoli rabe and margarita pizza. The pizza could use a little work; pretty crunchy on the bottom, the basil was way too strong, and there were no tomatoes. The ""If You See Kay"" wine was really tasty, as well as the Bellini. I will definitely come back here when in the area."
"Went here for a quick lunch a few weeks back. The service was nice and or food came out in good time. Everything tasted delicious, I have absolutely no complaints! I like that the dishes are intended to be shared, it's a great way to try multiple dishes. Overall a great dining experience, I will return!"
"I did not really like it here. Food was good. The portions were super small though. I understand its a tapas place but everyone at my table (6 of us) left hungry and felt like we paid so much. I wish there was a family platter option or something. I feel like they had the quality in their food but the quantity being served was not good enough, especially when compared to the price."
"I'll start off by saying if service was a bit faster I would have given five stars. I sat at the bar and the bartender was obviously busy but let me tell you, he held it down! Quite impressive due to him having to be the service bartender as well. I ventured into Quartino on a Saturday afternoon after my business trip wrapped up. I'm a transitioning vegetarian and my god it was so hard for me to find a place that sort of catered to vegetarians in Chicago! Conference food almost always sucks so I had a ravenous appetite from being stuck in Chicago for six days with hardly anything I could eat. Most places on Saturday apparently serve brunch until around 2pm. I was at sable before I came to Quartino because of the lack of options. Anyway I sat at the bar and decided on my New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Shortly thereafter, I realized the items on the menu were too cheap to be legit and I asked the bartender, ""Is this tapas?!"" Perhaps he could see my displeased grimace and said they are generally half portions. I was hungry and saw a few things I wanted to try so this response sufficed. I ordered the penne alla vodka and the garlic shrimp dish. The bartender served me my wine in a rocks glass from a carafe. I was confused for a moment because I've never drank wine out of a rocks glass.  I took a look around and saw that many people were drinking their wine this way and figured this MUST be the way to do it. I was given olive oil, cheese I had to shred myself and a plate of bread. I loved every moment of this seemingly traditional Italian establishment! My appetite still not curbed, I pondered ordering another round of the pasta and shrimp and opted for the calamari. I made a good decision. It was delicious! I also ordered more wine. I don't think I've ever eaten so much in my life. I thought for sure I'd spent around $60 in this place. I was astonished to get the check and see only a $39 tab. #winning! Quartino, see you later alligator!"
"love love quartino. italian tapas are such a great idea because usually they come in such big portions that you have leftovers that are not delicious the following day.have been to quartino on various occasions and most recently for st. patty's day to down some yummy sangria - amazing. the restaurant is always bustling no matter what time it is (especially on weekends) but its usually pretty easy to grab a seat at the bar when you have fewer than 5 in your party, which is what we ended up doing. plus - had to catch some basketball on tv! the service is fast and friendly, and everyone just seems to really enjoy being there, which i think is a great sign.on earlier occasions i've tried the seafood stew, meatballs, various pastas and pizzas, as well as their yummy tiramisu - and you can get half portion, which is key to success after a lot of carbs... cant wait to come back to chicago to eat moreee - so much deliciousness in this city."
"Excellent Italian tapas place. Came here with a few colleagues and really enjoyed it. We ordered the prosciutto wrapped dates, the wild arugula salad, the mushroom risotto, the gnocchi and a margarita pizza for 4 women. It was exactly enough for us and I thoroughly enjoyed each dish. Dishes come out when they are ready, so you aren't starving before the food arrives, portions are enough to share so that everyone gets a taste.  The gnocchi was a hit particularly, they were smaller than the customary slobs of gnocchi and the pesto was delicious. I would absolutely get that and the  prosciutto dates again. The only thing that irked me was how long it took to get the servers attention.  My party and I sat for at least 10-15 mins to get the bill.  Other than that, would love to go again when I'm back in town."
"My friend suggested this place so I decided to take a chance.Food and PricesPrices are very reasonable. Food is simply amazing.I had pizza and risotto, my companion had a pasta. All three were great.DrinksHad a half bottle of house red which was good. Recommend.StaffWe came an hour before closing time. Hostess was very friendly, we didn't have to wait for the table even consider that the place was packed. Waiter was friendly as well.AtmosphereWe were sitting outside. It's clean, has a good ambience. SummaryI'll definitely come back."
"Just another 5 star review. Does #2526 get a prize? Yelp told us to go here, so BF and I listened. Fabulous lunch! I started with a caprese salad. It was awesome. You wouldn't think it'd be hard to make, but I've had some bad caprese salads in my time. Not here. I wanted to order another for my entree! But I controlled myself. I followed it with the eggplant parmesan. Yum! Loved it. And loved that it was baked and not fried. BF got one of the pizzas, can't remember which one, but he liked it. Wine was good too. Server was nice, attentive but not annoying. Loved the soccer shirts. I hope to get back here some day!"
"From the night I arrived in Chicago and randomly stumbled in here on a Sunday night, I clearly new this would be one of my favorites in Chicago. Did Al Capone eat here at some point? Maybe, it certainly looks like he should have judging by the ambiance.The tapas style entrees are awesome. I had duck prosciutto, mortadella, caprese salad and pizza. Not all at once of course! The portions are pretty solid, so don't over order. Everything was delicious and top notch. Lots of Italian wines on the menu to pick from also. On weekdays, the place is fairly busy, so id recommend a reservation. In either case, I don't think the wait will be overwhelming. Can't comment on weekends though.By the way, this is a great date night spot. Laid back, alive and not overwhelmingly loud."
"I had a delightful agency-sponsored dinner here. Although really, when the agency is paying, what meal isn't delightful? We had what seemed like a hundred courses and pretty much every one was hoovered immediately. The salads are fantastic as is the calamari. The beignet dessert was a big hit as well. Great service, and they continued to be attentive even after the table got a little rowdy. Very convenient location."
"Yelpers really saved me with quartino! Staying at a nearby hotel, I wasn't sure where to start in terms of restaurants since there are so many in this areas. The yelp community steered me to Quartino and I am so happy they did. This is a really quaint bar with fantastic food. We had a reservation but since we were there early we ended up just sitting at the bar and ordering there. Service was spot on, and dinner was great.   We started off with polenta fries, but they were not very impressive. Since we didn't like them the bartender actually took them off the bill, which was nice if him. I started off with their tomato soup, which was vegetarian and tasty, for my main I ordered their cheese tortellini with mushrooms and peas, omg it was to die for.... Not healthy but totally worth the calories! Overall, this is a great spot for a date or dinner with friends. The food is served tapas style (but with generous portions) so it's probably better to go with a few people so you can try more."
"This place never disappoints. Been here few times already.  Classic Italian, served family style(meaning order bunch of different plates and share them with the table) because your going to want to try different stuff here! It is very loud in here so talking to each other is a challenge....don't bring anyone here on a date, you will be too busy saying 'what' half the time.  The food is good and if your a wine person, you will love their selection.The pizza is cooked in a firewood oven and the pastas will never disappoint.  Must try their dessert too....what was suppose to be 2 bites turned into 6 bites :-D (just sayin)"
The best meal I've ever had in my life! Jeffery was the most amazing server in the whole wide world! Wine list was fantastic! Food was so beyond incredible! The service was a level I didn't know could be achieved!
"This is my second time here for another friends birthday. Same experience with the food, nothing was special. Veal meatballs were Luke warm and not flavorful, goats milk ricotta was bland and other things I tasted from friends were nothing to rave about. Service was once again fabulous! I have come to the conclusion that the thing that makes this place is the desserts. Last time was the doughnuts this time was chocolate cake and omg was it amazing. I will come back again to try more things but I will always save room for dessert."
"SO GLAD that I ended up at Quartino on my recent trip to Chicago. Traveling with my fellow food(ie) lover girlfriend, we had a whole list of reservations for our trip. While planning out our dinners, we knew we needed some Italian in the mix. After researching on Yelp, we both happened to pick Quartino as our top choices. Small plates, lively atmosphere, and good prices - score! I personally chose Quartino because it didn't seem like your typical Italian restaurant and looked like something different than what you can get in San Francisco (where we're from).Entering the restaurant, I already loved the lively atmosphere. There are a bunch of tables and everything is pretty tight in terms of tables and the space at your table. Probably difficult if you come in a large group. But cozy/romantic for smaller groups or 2! We definitely had to shift things around on our table to accommodate our plates coming to the table. Service was good - our server was very friendly and attentive. The best part? Their food! Everything we ordered was delicious and on point. I love solid Italian food. Between the two of us, we ordered a Salumi sampler, Margherita Pizza, Linguine with Clams, and Eggplant Parmigiana. Along with that, we split a delicious bottle of Pinot Grigio. Four dishes was on the heavier side for two people, but we couldn't resist trying everything. Definitely a place I wish I went to with a group so I could order more dishes. Although everything was top notch, the dish that stood out for me was the Eggplant Parmigiana - it's safe to say this is the best version of it I have ever had.Overall a great experience here. I would recommend it to anyone who loves or even likes Italian food - yourself and your stomach will leave very satisfied and happy. Delicious food and fun environment. I would love to return if I am back in Chicago again!"
"Once we set foot into Quartino's, we could feel the bustle and vibe of the restaurant.  The restaurant has seating in the outside, but it was full and we were seated in the second level.  Quartino offers regional specialties from Italy including salumi, thin-crust pizza, and house-made pastas that are served in moderate portions to be served family style.  After checking out the menu, we ordered:Veal Meatball Sliders with pomodoro sauce and giardiniera.   The veal meatballs were tender and moist.Romaine Hearts with shaved grana, honey, lemon and evoo. Very fresh and crisp tasting salad.Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - Tuscan pasta ribbons with braised beef and tomato sauce.  The flavors were subtle in this pasta dish.  Wished it had strong flavors.Quattro Stagioni - artichokes, roasted peppers, grilled zucchini, Portobello mushrooms.  A tasty crispy thin crust pizza.  A good meatless option.Profiteroles - vanilla gelato, chocolate sauce and toasted almonds.  Two large profiteroles filled with vanilla gelato and topped with dark chocolate.  Wow, one of the best profiteroles that I've had.As the room where we were seated filled up which included there large parties, the atmosphere was lively and loud.  Our server was friendly and helpful.  The prices were reasonable and food came out fairly quickly.  I'll be back to Quartino's in my next trip to Chicago."
The food was delicious and the servings were amazing. Affordable authentic Italian food. Spaghetti pomodoro= amazing!
"Everything about this place was very mediocre. All the dishes we ordered were just ok and made me wish I had gone to one of the better Italian restaurants in the city. This place gets packed on the busy nights, and it doesn't seem like their service can keep up. We had someone else's dish delivered to our table and barely saw our waitress. This was easily our worst meal in Chicago."
"An absolute go-to and favorite amongst myself and friends. I often bring people here visiting from out of town and my friends and I have been to many birthday dinners here! Such great food, friendly staff, good for game-watching and the prices- you can't beat them for the area! It's great all around."
"My favorite aspect of Quartino is the location and the atmosphere. On a beautiful sunny day, both of those elements really add to the experience of eating here. The service is average. Nothing special. We went on a busy weekend night, so our waiter there did the bare minimum.The food is nothing special. We ordered fettuccine alfredo pasta, margherita pizza, and polenta fries. The amount of food we ordered was perfect for two to three people, and the quality of the food was not bad. Definitely not out-of-this-world yummy also. Very standard, plain fettuccine alfredo. The margherita pizza didn't taste like anything, but also was not disgusting. I kept hearing about the polenta fries, but they were really disappointing. Again, not bad, just disappointing. They didn't really taste like anything.I'm glad I tried this place, because the location is lovely. I would not come back because the quality of food for the price is not worth it. Again, not bad food, but not great food for the price."
"First night in Chicago, and we're looking for a restaurant that was still open. Decided on Quartino and we made it just before their kitchen closed. We had 5 minutes to order our food, so rushed into it, but I think we did pretty well.We ordered the Margherita pizza. It was very good, and reminded me of New York's Grimaldi's. We also tried the Eggplant Parmigiana, which I thought was excellent. And then we had the Zeppoles for dessert.Overall I thought the food was very good here. Service was nice too as they didn't rush us even though they were closing."
"Great pasta, cozy and casual inside, and they take reservations.The menu is pretty broad, but I stick with the pasta, which is very good.  The table bread is great, as are the small salads.Can't go wrong here.  If you like pasta, check this place out."
Absolute pleasure. Currently we are experiencing their buffet format. There are gentlemen on both sides of the table describing each plate as we serve. Stellar.The service is perfect. They are attentive and quick to educate with recommendations.All of this enjoyed on the second floor patio.
"Save your money. This place is awful.Worst cheese fondue I've ever had. It was incredibly runny and had an awful flavor.The sprosetta, dates, and carpaccio would all equally bland and flavorless.  Why this place is popular is beyond me..."
I have been here more times then I can count on two hands.I believe my friend and I have tried just about everthing on the menu.Everything is yummy. It is small plates so I would say get a bunch of dishes to try.Service is great.The only thing I haven't liked here was the house wine. Stick with a name for the wine.
"FABULOUS!!!  This was a great find!  The atmosphere and service were fantastic.  The food was wonderful and it was very reasonably priced.  Delicious pizza, homemade pasta, wine...yuuuuummm!  Seriously, what other restaurant can you get a bottle of wine for $12?!?!  Can't wait to go back!"
"I am going to give this place 2 stars, because when my family started coming here 4-5 years ago, it was way better. Quartino has really gone downhill with the quality of their food. I will also begin by saying that the service was great and the staff was very friendly and attentive, along with the managers. But the food here is just not good.We came here last night, and ordered vodka martinis to start. Very good, but at 14$ a piece, we should have gotten wine. My father ordered the minestrone, and I ordered the prosciutto wrapped dates. The dates were amazing, but the minestrone was just okay. Not bad, but again, just soup.My mother joined us and we ordered the crispy calamari, soppressata, beet salad, skirt steak, and the rigatoni with butternut squash and pancetta.1. the calamari just tasted like any other calamari you could get at an Italian restaurant, basic fried with marinara sauce. Not bad, but again, nothing special and not worth the price.2. The soppressata was extremely bland and flavorless. A very small portion came out.3. The beet salad was again very bland and flavorless. It just tasted like plain beets that had been diced, and thrown in with some walnuts and some very dry ricotta cheese.4. The skirt steak was another very small portion. Again, I understand that this is a tapas restaurant, we have been here countless times and to other tapas restaurants in the city. But when you order a meat dish, the meat should be the biggest portion of the dish. There was more plain arugala salad and roasted tomatoes on the plate than steak. Again, not bad, but not worth the price.5. Finally, we get to the rigatoni. We ordered it per the recommendation of our waitress, and this is probably one of the worst things I've ever ordered at a restaurant. I was told by the manager that it's an ""acquired taste"" and that some people either love it or hate it, but I can't see how anyone could love plain boiled noodles sprinkled with plain boiled butternut squash. There was no sauce, it was extremely dry, and I couldn't taste any seasonings, not even salt or pepper. The waitress was very kind and took it off our bill, but at a total of $100 still for all of this, we will not be returning. It is a shame because the staff are very friendly, but the food is simply not what it used to be a few years ago."
"Went here for dinner on a Sunday night w/ my sister around 6:30ish and we were seated immediately since we were okay with sitting outside. If we didn't, the wait would be around 45 min...and just before we had left our hotel we were contemplating on making a reservation but from availability, we decided to skip doing that--if it was colder, I would say it was a bad decision on our part, but since the weather was only in the low 50's in the evening, it wasn't bad at all!WHAT WE GOT:1) Salumeria Tasting: you get a choice of 2 salumis, 2 cheeses, and 3 spuntini .... we decided on mortadella and the duck prosciutto (so good!!), pecorino and taleggio, and the roasted peppers, beet salad, and artichokes campobasso. Loveeeed the assortment they give you--there was such a wide variety, plus olives and an apricot spread they give you--that we were never bored with what we had.2) Gnocchi: with green beans, potatoes, arugula pesto--this was so good! The gnocchi were nice, pillowy bites of goodness. Mmmmmm. My sister and I were looking around and admiring what all the other tables had gotten around us--we wish we weren't full or else we would have ordered more (especially the pizza!). Next time.... next time. Our server was nice and great with checking in on us and even apologized after our gnocchi came out before our tasting--we didn't mind at all!"
"Aside from the way dishes get banged down on the table, the food was expertly presented and delicious. Polenta fries were a joy as was the risotto and the octopus. Kudos for doing a half portion of the meatballs as an appetizer. Very good."
"That's Amore...My Italian Stallion! Quartino is an Italian bar & restaurant in downtown Chicago, IL that's known for its wine, pizza & tapas-style portions. It's not the new kid on the block but it warrants being my lucky review number double 5 as it's worth 5 gems times 2! I've been here many times but it's one of my very fave, go-to places in Chicago, especially when I'm feelin' bad & carby! You cannot go to Quartino & not overindulge in some serious carb-overload, ain't happenin'! Don't even try to resist, work it off tomorrow!I've never had a bad meal or tried anything I didn't like at Quartino. Whoa! I know, a rare statement comin' from this biznitch! You can customize anything on the menu at Quartino & no one bats an eye! Sub it, swap it, add it, hold it, halfzies, whole-size...you ask, they're game! Everything on the menu is designed to share & can be ordered as half or whole-order, including bottles o'wine! So you can & tote should sample a lil o'everything! First, you must get the polenta fries with red bell pepper salsa dippin' sauce. They come in a 3-teaser or an 8-ball amount. They're OMG, fried indescribable stix o'crack, my fave lil app here! Also, erbody gets a loaf o'hot, crusty, Italian bread!Any of the salads at Quartino are friggin' awesome. If you like kale, you'll luv the Tuscan Kale Salad. It's got roasted butternut squash, sweet-n-sour onion, borlotti beans & of course lotsa, gemmy kale, duh! I had this salad on my last visit & it was supa fresh, tangy & a kale of a way to start your meal! The Shaved Spring salad is another gem fave!For veggie side dishes, I heart the brussel sprouts that are roasted with EVOO & are crispy & insanely good! I also luv the roasted peppers, a mix o'multi-colored bell peppas roasted in EVVO. I'm not a big fan o'meatballs but you should get some o'these guys. My fave are the Polpette al sugo di pomodoro: veal meatballs in organic tomato sauce w/fresh basil & house-made ricotta. Um, these balls are amazeballz! You can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes here either. Stracchi di Grano Arso is a gemmy, vegetarian pasta dish: Broccoli rabe, tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, EVOO & bursting with friggin' flava! If you're feelin' clammy, you can't beat Linguine w/clams: EVOO, red chili, Pinot Grigio & red sauce. The noodles are perfectly al dente with robust sauce & nice lil clammies!For dessert, I like a scoop o'gelato. The gelato is creamy, smooth & the flavors are all gemliciously on point! I usually get lemon gelato cuz it's refreshin' after a big carby meal! If you wanna super, spesh dessert get Panino al Gelato Limone: lemon cream gelato sandwich w/lemon curd, whipped cream, & lemon chips. It's big enough to share & it's like eatin' a light, fluffy, OMG lemon cloud sent from above!Ok, I saved the best for last & the reason I always come back to Quartino for more! My weakness & fave kinda pizza is traditional, ""Neapolitan-style pizze"". I don't eat 'em that often, but when I do I wanna make it count! I eat & try 'em all over, but I still like Quartino's Neapolitan-style 'zas da best! Quartino has a variety o'yummy pizze options to choose from or ya can customize one to your liking! My fave is the Vegetarina Pizze: asparagus, cauliflower, zucchini, eggplant, wild arugula & add mushrooms. My other fave is the Quattro Staggiano. The pies are about 12"" & are big enough to feed 1-2 people. The crust in the middle is super thin & soft but the outer crust is an uneven, bubbly ring that has a perfect, chewy-crunch to it. It has just the right amount of tangy/garlicky, tomato sauce & isn't overpowered by a ton o'cheese but is packed with uber, fresh veggies on top, just the way I heart mia pizza pies! Seriously, you're gonna luv any o'the pizzes here if ya like this kinda 'za! Quartino is upbeat, lively & always packed. You can make a rez on Yelp or Open Table or just walk-in & grab a seat at the bar. Quartino is huge with dining rooms & a bar on both floors & also has an outside patio. It's casual-trendy & the ambience is rustic-sheik. The service here is accomodating, quick & to the point. I'm happy to yelp all the servers I've had at Quartino have all been informative of the menu & helpful with recs if needed. (Gem Rule#1: Know the Menu or at least fake it! Idk is NOT an acceptable answer! I hate it when I go to places that break this rule!) So if you're visitin' Chicago or it's been awhile, I highly recommend goin' to Quartino to try a lil or a lotta different, gemazin' Italian bites & ya must get one o'my fave Neapolitan pies & an order o'polenta fries! I do like tryin' other places for Neapolitan 'zas & other Italian fare, but when all other dinner plans go South, get 86'd, are a no-go or nothin' else sounds good, Quartino is my fall back cuz he's da best, knows how to treat me & knows just what I like! He's always waitin' on State Street to take me back in & show me a good time & feed me a fuggin' molto bene meal... And That's Amore!"
"Food was simple and delicious, carried in waves to and from the table as our group was caught up in conversation tucked away in our own room. Wine, too, was flowing.For our group dinner, the meal consisted of four courses, served family-style: antipasti, paste, pesce e specialita and dolci. When we sat down, plates of Roasted Beet & Walnut Salad, Assorted Bruschette and Polenta Fries were already waiting for us. The beet salad was earthy, not overly sweet, and sprinkled with walnuts and fresh ricotta salata. A trio of bruschette were topped with peppery arugula, warm Sicilian eggplant and portobello mushrooms (each separate) and, of course, cheese. These warm, crisp toasts served as a much better start to the meal than a basket of bread. By themselves, the polenta fries were a little under-salted and under-seasoned; but use them to mop up heaps of red sauce, and all is forgiven.Paste was next, and the dishes in this course were especially comforting: Gnocchi with Arugula Pesto and Spaghetti con Pomodoro. The gnocchi were soft, pillowy and just a tad chewy (as they should be) sitting in a shallow pool of pesto alongside green beans and potatoes. Spaghetti con Pomodoro isn't a complicated dish, but Quartino's Pomodoro is a light, lovely fusion of tomato and basil. The Pesce e Specialita - for us, Salmon and Chicken - fell a little flat. The fish was dry and chewy, which I've never had before in salmon. Dolci, though, made up for it.Dessert was Tiramisu - a layered, soaked cake treat that's not for the faint of appetite. An amalgamation of flavors, including coffee, cocoa and mascarpone, Quartino's Tiramisu is almost too much, but then you share with a friend (or two), and it's suddenly just the right amount of rum, ladyfingers and cocoa to cap off a meal. You'll leave feeling full, but in all the right ways."
"Came here with a group of 20. The place on a Friday night was packeddd. (And no fewer than 5 bachelorette parties were occuring)The place is loud. Really loud, I would not recommend this place for an intimate meal.Party with friends? Sure.Appetizers:Assorted bruschetta - I liked the portobello mushroom one with shaved romano, delish.Artichokes Campobasso - good.Caponata, delicious, not too salty, lovely. Pasta:Potato gnocchi with argula pesto, I mean besides the fact that every server said gnocchi funny, they were homemade and delicious.Fettuccine with fresh tomatoes and evoo. Yum. Fresh pasta makes all the difference.Meat Course:Salmon with black olives and tomato - deliciousRoasted Chicken with thyme - could have used some more salt, but better undersalted than over salted.Dessert:Dark Chocolate fonduta with pears, strawberries, pinapple, apple and biscotti. Yesss. I saw some plates of octopus go to the table next to us, they made me jealous. They looked awesome.I could see why there were so many parties going on."
"Was disappointed considering some other reviews. The staff at the front desk were nice but then downhill from there. It seemed like an upscale place but when we got in there were tables full of college/frat types with hats backwards, overly loud and swearing. Couldnt hear the others in my table, and I wasn't blown away by the food. No dish was particularly rememberable.Sorry, avoid."
"I am so shocked that I have never been here before a few weeks ago! It's everything you'd want in your friendly neighborhood Italian restaurant, and more. First of all, the prices are beyond reasonable, our check was $55 for two people and that was 4 dishes, 2 desserts, and 2 glasses of wine, I was very impressed! Secondly, the service is excellent. Our server was truly hustling with his huge section but he got everything done and was just so genuine. He took the time to help us sort through the extensive menu and choose wine, all with a smile (a real one). Thirdly, the atmosphere couldn't be better. It's crowded and just the right amount of loud where you know every one is having a great time. You really feel like you are in an authentic Italian restaurant; complete with a bread slicer in the middle of the floor, meats and cheeses hanging everywhere and Italian football jerseys covering the walls and the servers. I love the funny black and white Italian movies playing on mute with English subtitles. My friend and I were trying to figure out the plot the entire time we were waiting for our food (we never got it). Lastly, the food here is amazing. Start with the white bean garlic dip and you will end up eating all the bread and probably asking for more. The pizzas are full of flavor and really heavy on the toppings, which I think are the best parts. Save room for dessert as you won't want to miss the profiteroles or the Nutella sandwich; get both and you won't be disappointed!"
"Love the variety and the pizza is stellar!The RUCOLINO PIZZA is thin and the dough has a nice crunch then chew. Loved it. Very light cheese and sauce, with the dominant flavor being the arugula on top. Definitely needed some salt, but other than that, it was perfectly light and satisfying.The TALLEGIO cheese plate was weird. While I liked the cheese a lot, the apricot purée and cranberry walnut bread was too sweet. Fortunately, the regular bread that's served with oil and vinegar upon being seated was still there, so I used that bread instead. EGGPLANT PARMESAN was disappointing. Wayyyyy too much cheese melted on top of very thick slices of eggplant. It might be fine for many people, but I found it to be clunkyHusband also ordered the first SHRIMP dish with white wine sauce. The flavor was good but the shrimp were over cooked and tough. Service was very good and lively patio atmosphere was perfect."
"Absolutely garbage. I write this from the bar at Quartino on a Sunday. I'm so outraged by the experience that I'd prefer to sit here and write the review over actually eating my food.We ordered a couple of beers. The food came out quickly. We started with the sundried tomato soup ($3.75) which came in a very small dish but tasted tolerable. I ordered the porcini mushroom risotto ($14.75) and BF ordered the gnocchi ($10.75). The risotto came out first--a nasty mess of mushy gray slop which I finished out of extreme hunger alone--that's not much to boast of, however, because all in all, there were about nine spoonfuls--I'll liken eating them to going through each of Dante's circles of hell.Next came the gnocchi--a true nightmare of incompatible tastes. A tiny platter with gnocchi absolutely drowning in oil, pesto, and (apparently) arugula and potato, this dish tasted off immediately and also smelled foul. The bartender came by and asked if everything was alright. I explained that the gnocchi tasted awful--and tried to articulate exactly what was ""off"" about it, but I was so overwhelmed by the competing options that I just gave up and left it at ""honestly, it tastes bad."" In response, he told us to ""keep eating because there is some good garlicky stuff in there""...I mean, I don't even know where to go with that. We picked at it some more out of sheer politeness, and we really shouldn't have but my boyfriend, bless his little heart, is too damn nice. I couldn't go through with it. He came by again and asked if we wanted to get something else. After tasting those two dishes, though, I wasn't sure we could survive another go around. We politely declined and asked for the check. When he dropped it off, he told us that he'd taken the gnocchi off of the tab. Right move, but too little, too late. When someone complains about the food, you don't give them a hard time and tell them to keep eating; you apologize and offer them something else. At that point, we were visibly upset and still hungry (we ate maybe 50% of the food that came out). We paid, tipped for the bad service (out of principle alone) and left. And as a final note: there's a bit of humor to every bad situation because the whole time in my head, while this was playing out, I kept imagining Gordon Ramsey just absolutely freaking out. Gordon, on the off chance you're reading this, you may want to give this place a shot."
"Delicious! The beef stuffed ravioli was out of this world.  The ravioli wasn't traditional but really a different and very enjoyable experience. The eggplant Parmesan was traditional and still excellent. We had a pepperoni Pizza that was amazing.  It isn't chicago deep dish but it was great!!! We got the donuts with chocolate sauce and honey and tiramisu and those were amazing. No complaints. Great food, nice staff, clean place, five stars!"
"This is a real find.  Great food.  Great service. The restaurant has an expansive and reasonably priced wine list.  The menu is Italian but with a ""Spanish tapas"" angle which is fun once you get your head out of traditional Italian ordering. Definitely a recommend."
"Hands down, their food is simply amazing! I had one of the best meals in a very long time here! The dressing on their kale salad is out of this world, and their meatballs are to die for! Pasta is perfectly cooked (al dente,) and the wine is incredible. It was a tad on the pricier side, but worth every last penny! Did I mention how excellent the wine and service are? This place is a MUST!"
"My go-to Italian restaurant in River North. Over the course of many visits, items experienced include -Excellent: fried calamari, huge and perfectly crispy; shrimp risotto, just creamy enough with a healthy portion of butterflied shrimp; pappardelle ribbons which perfectly pick up the braised short rib; veal meatballs with ricotta, incredible banana coppa.Very good: duck prosciutto pizza; delicious veal meatball sliders; succulent baby octopus; braised pork ravioli, profiteroles are great(Comparatively) unremarkable: braised pork shank is well done but without any distinctive flavor; veal meatballs napoli are a bit too sweet; eggplant parmesan too oily and one-dimensional.Overall, Quartino remains a great choice, especially with cheap but good carafes of wine. Service has been consistently attentive, water glasses were rarely empty. Atmosphere is loud, lively, packed with people, and overall a lot of fun."
"I have been a long time Yelp user and this is now my first post. What can I say? Quartico met beyond my expectations that I felt the need to inform everyone (in the Yelp-universe). We came in for dinner on a Saturday evening and were able to be seated immediately. Service: A+ Upon sitting down at our table, we were graciously greeted by our server, Jeff, who took the time to go over the menu with us, as well as provide recommendations since it was our first time. The servers and staff continued going out of their way to provide us excellent service and they definitely achieved that.Food: A-The appetizers and entrees (other than the pizza) are tapas style (sharing). This does not certainly mean that the portions are big. They are definitely your average sized entree. We ordered the Veal Meatballs for the appetizers. These were very tender and were seasoned well (9/10). For the entrees, we ordered the Penne alla Vodka and the Shrimp Risotto. The Penne alla Vodka was great and the ratio between pasta to sauce was perfect, but it definitely didn't stand out (8/10). On the other hand, the Shrimp Risotto was definitely the contender that night. So good that we ordered another plate. I have never, ever had a risotto that excellent before. I honestly have no words for how amazing this dish is. You must order and see for yourself (REALLY - JUST DO IT). Lastly, we ordered the Zeppole for dessert and this was also great, but did not stand out (8/10).Booze: AFull service bar with an extensive wine collection. I had myself the mojito and this was very good."
"I've been to this place THREE times - which is a record for me because I'm all about exploring new restaurants and there are SO many in Chicago that if I'm spending big bucks on dinner, I'm looking for a new experience! Well Quartino's is so fantastic that I keep going back! The ambience is great. It's upscale but still comfortable and welcoming (not stuffy or snobby). The menu is expansive and I LOVE the shared, small plates concept so that you get to try many things. The waitstaff is attentive but not at all annoying.  The food is delicious and served at perfect temperatures. And this is gonna sound random but one of my favorite things here is the the borax powder in the restrooms - your hands have never felt cleaner!I love this place. Great for date night!"
"Been here a handful of times, and the experience is consistent everytime. Dishes are tapas style. Ask me to choose among deep dish, NY, and Neapolitan style pizza, and 100% of the time, i will pick Neapolitan. Get the fennel sausage pizza! Other must-tries are:Tagliatelle alla Bolognese pastaOrecchiette pastahomemade tiramisuWhat i realllllly love about this place is that i don't have to make a reservation and can expect to be seated within 30 minutes for a walk-in.Warning: can get loud, but the place is extremely spacious with two floors and outside seating, so it's very tolerable."
"I love Quartino's for larger groups.  The restaurant is loud, plates are shareable and there's a nice vibe to the place.  It isn't fancy -- you can walk in with jeans and be fine -- and the food and service reflect that.  There's no pretension. The food is generally tasty.  I've liked all the pizzas that I had and the polenta is a fun starter.  The only real clunker is the gnocchi, which has a somewhat gritty sauce that lacks the bite suggested by an arugula pesto."
"Quaint Quartino has a great atmosphere, wonderful service and delicious Italian fare.  It was packed with no available reservations but we walked up and a table for two, a tiny table, was available.  The veal meatballs with raisins were delicious as was the romaine hearts salad with lemon dressing. Tagliatelle bolognese was wonderful.  We also had the mixed olives red, green and black- very tasty.  We will probably go pack for the pizza and the shrimp and garlic dish.  I highly recommend Quartino!"
"I am not a 5-star reviewer. We went to Quartino with a large group and they handled it BEAUTIFULLY.  The wait staff was above and beyond for our rowdy table of 16.We drank a ton of wine, sampled 15 dishes, and tried ALL of the desserts. It was a great evening."
My favorite restaurant in the entire universe!!!!!!!The best and most affordable Italian food I've ever had. I lived in Chicago for 4 years (and would eat here many times per month) and now live in New York City and dream about going back to Chicago just to eat here. I love their arrabiata and pizzas. Whenever a friend is going to be in Chicago I tell them to go to Quartino.
"Quartino is a factory operation.  They churn large groups in and out with practiced efficiency, and so this is a place where large groups tend to congregate.  They bring out dishes as they come, a la francaise, so that you have multiple courses in front of you simultaneously, getting colder and colder unless you eat like a maniac.  The food itself - pizzas, pastas, salads - is about on par with Olive Garden, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It is inexpensive.  The best tasting dishes I've had during my 3 or so visits here were the burrata and the chocolate cake. The servers are either absent or impatient, or both, and will start setting the table for the next group while you're still finishing your meal.  If you have 15-20 people, give it a chance perhaps, but if you're craving good Italian food, there has to be better!"
"I don't go here often, and this review is pretty much for the bar area only, since I've never had a sit down dinner here . . . and likely won't.That's not to say the food is not tasty, the appetizers are quite appealing. This is a GIANT restaurant, but it's cut up into several bar areas so it doesn't seem as large as it is. Which is good.I was here in the upstairs bar for a private event. Our bartender was GREAT, really friendly, dishy and flirty - just how a buncha girls like their bartender!Nice wine list, this is all around a solid place for a drink or a snack."
"I came here with a group for dinner before heading out to celebrate my sister's birthday.  The idea of tapas kind of makes me nervous... will I like it?  Why do we have to share?  Will I still be hungry after?  Did everyone wash their hands?  Things like that.  Luckily, my worries were unwarranted as I did get plenty to eat and the food was good.  We ordered several dishes, from what I can remember we had some pasta, some bacon wrapped dates, margaherita pizza (that's probably spelt wrong) and another type of pizza I can't remember.  The pizza was my favorite (go figure) but everything else was good too.  It was definitely a type of food I've never tried before but was interesting.  They also had a nice wine list that I enjoyed.On a random note, they had a bathroom attendant that was so sweet!  Normally I don't go to places that have bathroom attendants but she had everything you could imagine in that bathroom with music playing while she was dancing around with the other guests.  I don't know she was just such a happy nice girl.  I left her $5 and I think everyone else should too!"
"Such a huge fan!!!  I would love, love, love to have this back home in Detroit.  Quartino will for sure be a new must-stop place every time I'm in Chicago.  I highly recommend the fondue- the mixture of cheeses was absolutely perfect.  Also really enjoyed the vodka penne.If you like Italian food and you like tapas, then this is the place for you."
"Well! 2600 reviews on this one!I've gone here quite a bit and this will be the one place I actively miss when I move away from Chicago.I always get the ravioli and the honey donuts, the pizza and small pasta plates are delicious too. The plates are small and priced low so you can try a bunch of different things and share with the table.Eclectic mix of tables/chairs/silverware. Old time/foreign movies playing on the TVs (muted but with subtitles)."
"Have been to Quartino a number of times.  Great for a large group - extensive menu and good food (geared for the masses).  Very active & loud, but not so much that you can't have a conversation.  Fun wine list.   EXCEPTIONAL service every time I have been there.  Most recently, Aldo was a hoot - great recommendations, VERY helpful & informative, very fun interaction. Made the evening."
"Awesome outside seating, excellent service ! We stumbled upon this place and are so glad we did !! Thin crust pizza was perfection, salad and pasta, fresh, flavorful !! Couldn't believe our bill when it arrive, very reasonable, we thought for sure they had forgotten an item, HIGHLY recommend !"
"I've come to this place twice and both visits were pleasant. The waiters/restaurant encourages you to enjoy the food ""tapas style"", but you don't have to if you don't want to. The first time I went was on an early Sunday evening and I had the tortellini. The tortellini was the perfect portion for one and it was delicious. Perfect balance of ingredients and flavor.  During my second visit I had the caponata salad. I love olives and eggplant, but if you don't love them, this wouldn't be something you would like. The flavor of the caponata was both strong and a little spicy.  I had one of the pizzas on the menu. The pizza didn't come out until my two friends were done with their main dishes,but it was worth the wait. The prices here are extremely reasonable for the quality and amount of food they serve. This is a great place for a date, family, a group of friends, or really any group of people. Location is perfect as well."
"I was very surprised at the taste of the food in relation to the price.  The pizza was extremely tasty.  The dough and sauce were excellent and unique.  The veal meatballs with ricotta and basil was incredible.  House made ricotta was mmmmmmmmmmm.  My wife had the past which was also great, but didn't blow me away.  Make a reservation.  We were supposed to be seated outside but were not.  The staff was very meh althought I imagine it's an annoying place to work.  I felt hurried while the waitress hovered over us while looking at the menu.  Another downside is the noise level.  I don't know if it was just that night, but it seemed like there were 10 bachelorette parties and 20 something birthdays.  I could barely stand it and intitialy wanted to leave.  Conversation with my wife was next to impossible and my throat was raw by the end of the night.  It also felt like it was in a weird part of town. Ultimataly it was the most inexpensive dinner of our trip so that was a good thing."
"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.   A must when I am in Chicago.  Italian small plates is what is offered.  A great way to try many items on a great menu.  Tonight I ordered the veal meatballs, cavatelli pasta, salami (cured in house) and provolone cheese.  And a Peroni for a beverage.   Just waiting for it all to arrive at the table.   The meatballs arrived with the salami and provolone.  The meatballs were tender and delicious.  The raisin sauce they where was a good pairing.  The salami was delicious.   It came with pickled cucumbers and grapes.  The amount of pickling was just right.  Provolone nice and sharp.  The cavatelli arrived.  Delicious.   I highly recommend Quartinios.  Make sure you make reservations.   Enjoy."
"This place was not at all what I was expecting. Italian tapas, what an idea! Every single dish we tried was amazing, my personal favorites were the goat's milk ricotta and the veal meatball sliders. The only downfall with this place is I felt really crammed into our table with a party of 8; not sure it's the best place for large groups. I felt like I was continually in the way of servers trying to get through our area and out to the patio, and I spent my entire meal worried that I was going to cause a disaster of falling plates of food. Other than that though, this place has the perfect location close to all of the hotels in River North, the perfect patio and open air seating for the summer, and some great fresh Italian cuisine. It would also be a great date spot! Not too fancy, but not too casual, and you can share a bunch of different dishes. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Chicago"
"I was in Chicago for a work trip and was told by a coworker and locals that I had to eat here. I met up with 7 other of my friends who are Chicago locals, and had no problem getting a table around 6:30. We ordered the featured wines, arugula pizza, margarita pizza, veal meatballs, calamari, linguine with clams, osso bucco, seafood risotto, prosciutto wrapped dates, raviolis, and polenta fries. Everything was great! I especially loved the linguine with clams and meatballs. I will definitely come back here next time I am in Chicago!!"
"This place is like a factory pushing out sub par food. The food was sooooo salty it was inedible. I actually sent it back, which I never  do. Maybe it was just a bad night?"
"I love love love this place! Great wines and cocktails, great appetizers, and delicious entrees. Bacon wrapped dates are delish. I tried octopus for the first time and it was really good! Bartenders are attentive (at least when it's not too busy) and the staff are friendly. I believe the first time I came here we had a reservation (?) and the second time we met friends at the bar and grabbed some seats right away. Parking in the area is difficult at best, but it's downtown Chicago, what do you expect? I think the atmosphere is odd, with the sports-themed attire of the waitresses and TV's all around, but a beautifully designed space that doesn't quite fit..."
"Quartino is my go to for birthdays, events, drinks with companions, the list goes on. It's one of the few places in the Rivernorth area you can walk in to without a reservation and be seated in a decent wait time. I've been with big groups of 10+ and the food comes out quick and hot. There's something for everyone including those picky eaters. On my birthday we ordered 4 carafes of wine, two pizzas and many assorted small dishes and the bill came out to be only $19 a piece. Try the Italian donuts for some sugary fun! My girlfriends ordered me a birthday cake and they responded with well we can bring you a bachelorette party cake. Two scoops of icecream with a banana sticking out of it smeared with chocolate sauce is not only hilarious but also delicious ;)"
"I would rate Quartino as a solid three stars. Good food, good service, I just wasn't really blown away with any of the dishes. We started out with the polenta fries with red bell pepper salsa. It was pretty tasty and came out very hot, so it clearly was made fresh. While the first few bites were interesting, it became a little bland and boring and my husband ended up finishing the dish. I will say that he loved these and thought they were very good. We then ordered the veal meatballs, which were served in tomato sauce with basil and topped with ricotta. This dish was quite good, but again I felt it was missing some flavor. It also became cold quite quickly. Neither me nor my husband were impressed with this dish. Next was shrimp with garlic, red chili, pinot grigio, E.V.O.O. and lemon juice. Very fresh, bright, and acidic with nice garlicky notes. Again, a solid dish but nothing special. The gnocchi with green beans and arugula pesto was my favorite of the night. It was interesting and had a nice mix of flavors and textures. We also really enjoyed the campania pizza, which had a very nice, tender and slightly chewy crust and was topped with fonduta, ricotta, roasted cherry tomatoes, and basil leaves. This was a very good pizza if you are looking for something a little different. I really liked the oven roasted tomatoes, it gave the pizza an intense tomato flavor. We finished the meal with the zeppoles, which were deep fried dough balls dusted in powdered sugar and served with a side of honey and dark chocolate sauce. These were very good, but also very rich. They were excellent with the hot, strong coffee we ordered to accompany them. Like I said, this place serves solidly good food, and you won't regret eating here. However, I think there are other restaurants that take the flavors a bit further and will create a more memorable impression."
"Another glorious find thanks to Yelp! I was in town with some friends (we were staying downtown) and they left it up to me to pick dinner for that evening.. After some searching I ran across Quartino.. Italian shared plates?? Sign me up!Quartino met and exceeded my expectations with great flair! The atmosphere is lively (maybe a little loud but totally ok!), very eclectic fun crowd, the building itself is gorgeous and historic looking, and it was bustling with energy on a Saturday night. The food.. Well, its great! We started with the meat, cheese, pickled veggie, and olive board. We let our server pick the choices, and he did a great job! We really liked everything. We ordered up the rest of our choices: brussel sprouts, beef filet, calamari, cauliflower, caprese salad, shrimp, and linguini with clams. Everything was so so good, I even ordered more brussels so I could have my own. I really wanted to try the pizzas (the table next to us had one, and it looked great!) but my friends weren't on board since it was thin crust. Next time!The service was fast and attentive, our waiter had a good personality and was very good despite being obviously very busy. All in all a great lively place to bring your friends!"
"The salumi -truffle salami, speck and duck prosciutto - were good and the pizza (thin crust wood fire style) was also good.  However, for a wine bar, the wine selection was weak and drinking wine out of traditional Italian cups/shot glasses lessened the dining experience.  Also, the restaurant is really loud inside, so it is not the place to go if you want to have a relaxing meal.  I felt like I was at a mediocre chain restaurant and I was disappointed.  I would not go back."
"Not sure what's so special. First the place is very crowed inside. You can barely walk among the tables. And the table is also small, with a huge stack plates in the middle and no place to place the tapa plates.There's just no room for dishes to sit on the table.For the food itself, hmm, not so impressive. Got a couple tapas, bacon wrapping dates are really good. And seafood linguine is ok.Not good that I bother to try again anyways. Desserts are good, the chocolate cake is sweet, and the icecream is pretty tasty and I love it."
"Very popular and can get very crowded.  Great staff always very competent and friendly.Italian small- plates menu, vintage decor.  Food never disappointing.Menu featuring Italy's regional specialties including artisanal salami, Neapolitan thin-crust pizza, house-made pasta, and seasonal dishes.Menu items, served in moderate portions and meant to be shared, are perfect for adventurous diners ready for a unique experience.Chef John Coletta has sat down with us several times and clearly takes great pride in the food he prepares."
Loved this place.  The food was great and the fact that you can get a tapa of an Italian dish is great.  You can even get half servings so you can sample even more pasta dishes.  The staff was great and we were well taken care of.   I will go back the next time I am in Chicago!
"This is Chicago, loud, vibrant, & serves late late night. In our visit to the Windy City, we came here twice. I'm not one for repeats, however, the loud vibe, Carrera marble, hexagone tile with bathroom attendant just lured me in. Pizzas are not your cornmeal over the top, but they are delicious. The $15 duck prosciutto D'Anitra pizza with the arugula is to diiiiiiie for. The loud ambiance with outdoor seating is a must if you have been hibernating a hard winter.  It's right near the Red Head Piano Bar which is a great stepping stone for a girls night out. Soak in all the cursing around you.., this is Chicago. Loud & in your face. Enjoy !I'd visit this place again & again."
Place was good nothing to rave about I had dinner place was busy! I had the meatball sliders they were really good also had a pasta could tell the quality was there. I really enjoyed the decoration the place was done up right. Service was good as well really enjoyed the place I will have to come back to it again. I recommend reservations it was really busy.
Just excellent good tasting Italian food. I had the veal meatballs with basil and ricotta cheese. Amazing enough for 2 or 3 people if sharing. I also had the Cavatelli and grand coppa desert was also great The bartenders where great and friendly. The gravy was like home made and yes I call is gravy not sauce! Sauce is for mooks! Come here have a nice meal for a great price and a few drinks or more to start your night or finish it.
"I eat a shit-ton of pasta. I usually cook an entire box, all 16 ozs and eat it with sauce in one sitting. (That's one pound for you non-mathematical fire breathing dragons)Tapas style, intimate settings and beautiful ambiance.***this was the best meal of my vacation, since this meal I've been trying to find a similar pasta dish but haven't been in luck.Tortellini AlfredoSpring saladVeal osso buco - the tender meat fell off the bone, I was eating it with a spoon.Papardelle manzo - had to do it, manzo is the middle name.. Best decision, I still have dreams of this pasta to this day no joke.Half litre of wineThe chefs at this restaurant have clearly outdone themselves. Phenomenal meal alongside some of the busy streets of Chicago. We sat elevated on the top floor outside so it wasn't congested but rather romantic. Hats off, if I'm ever in the area I'll bring everyone I'm with. Ciao!"
"I was craving cicchetti (Italian small plates), so I visited on a Sunday night. The restaurant has a romantic candle-lit, Italian ambience, fitting for date nights, but the service staff are also warm and welcoming which is perfect for family gatherings. For vegetarian-friendly items, I'd recommend the bruschetta, polenta fries, and goat cheese ricotta, and the margherita pizza! Compared to Bar Ombra in Andersonville, I'd say both price and quality of cicchetti and pizza are similar, but Bar Ombra has a more rustic ambience and is closer to the N. Shore suburbs. Still, if you're in Chicago and crave delicious cicchetti, definitely stop by! Note that the bathrooms are on the second floor, and after the meal, you redeem a $25 lunch certificate for 2 people to enjoy a 3-course menu, valid M-F before 3pm."
"A very classy environment at Quartino.Service could be better... but the food was good nonetheless.I thought the latte was amazing! The cappuccino that my bf ordered was also delicious. Very creamy and smooth.We ordered:SALUMERIA TASTING 3/5The display of this platter definitely gives you a WOW *takes pictures*But I only like a few of the selections within the 10 that were presented.The sliced meat, cheese and marinated eggplant were my pick out of the tasting platter.PAPPARDELLE AL SUGO DI MANZO 4/5The pasta ribbons were very different - It's chewy! A tasty mix between the braised beef.PORCINI & TRUFFLE RISOTTO 4/5The display wasn't really appetizing haha.. but the taste was delicious - especially the truffle.TORTELLINI 5/5The Alfredo sauce was AMAZING :) Our favourite from the pasta selections.STEAMED CLAMS - PINOT GRIGIO & RED CHILI BROTH 4/5Fresh and yummy. The bread that comes with it is also very delicious."
"I went here with my friend and boyfriend and we hadn't really planned it out, we were all just starving and picked a place to eat. My friend and I are both vegetarians and they seemed to have a lot of options for that so that was very nice, plus our server told us they can alter ingredients to fit your needs. We ended up just ordering a pizza to share and all got a plate each for ourselves.We accidently got the wrong pizza but didn't realize it and it was super salty (rucolina instead of vegetarina). They got our correct order out with no charge for either due to the mix up and late arrival of our original order. I managed a bite of my boyfriends spaghetti which tasted delicious. I ordered the gnocchi and all I could taste was SALT. I couldn't finish the plate due to the overwhelming taste of salt on my palette. When our original pizza came out I did enjoy it although it looked exactly like the first. I expected a bit more vegetables and less arugula for a vegetable pizza.I'm no fan of salty things and this was overwhelming. I feel like I need to go back to try other options.OVERALLService: 4 starsFood: 3 stars"
"I went here because it's nearby and a friend had told me that is has the ""most authentic Italian food"" in the city. I had pretty high expectations and left underwhelmed. I thought it would be a bit nicer or a restaurant, so I was surprised when I sat down at a table with those red and white picnic table covers. The pizza was pretty standard neapolitan pizza that you can get almost anywhere. The polenta fries were a complete waste of money and stomach space. I also had the penne a la vodka with Italian sausage, which was fine... But I could make the same quality pasta at home. All in all, I found that this was a pretty run of the mill Italian restaurant."
"Enjoyed Pizza  Bianco with arugula , garlic and black olives and a side  of fennel sausage. So fresh and delicious . Reminded me of Italia. Visited with Yelp recommendations and found( as usual) the rating to be accurate .Very busy, but bar seating is first come and no wait. Extensive menu and attentive staff,"
Great service. I'd got the ravioli. It was good and different. Fresh tomatoes sauce. Not too salty. Not too rich. I'd recommend the home made pasta. Linguine and clams was okay. It had to much butter.
"The food was pretty good, but we had a bizarre experience last week. We had a small group there for my mom's birthday. I noted on my reservation that we were celebrating a birthday, but not a soul there mentioned it- whatever, not a big deal. Anyways, at the end of the meal we said we wanted to see a desert menu to celebrate a birthday and have some cappuccinos. Our server eventually brings us an actual desert, no menus, and no coffee. Ok, cool, we think, they just brought us a birthday desert (that we didn't order), except they charged us for it. Someone in the party questioned the manager about it on our way out and he blew us off and was quite a jerk about it.The food was fine, very large portions for a share menu, but between our server and the manager being so rude about it I couldn't recommend it to anyone."
"This experience deserves a zero. First of all our main meal was brought out before our starters and had to send it back which they put on hold. About an hour later after we were forgotten about they brought our pasta with meat sauce and it tasted like bad bland leftovers. Once two tables of bridal shower guests arrived we were completely ignored. Will never go back, worst experience ever!"
"I came here with my girlfriend about 6 months ago and it has become a favorite date spot of ours.We have only ordered the desserts, but they are fantastic. The profiteroles are the just order. The pastries are fantastic and the chocolate sauce on them is just great. The ice cream in the center is perfectly sweet as well. Paired up with great service and quick seating, Quartino gets a perfect rating."
"My friend took me here for my last meal in Chicago while visiting, and I must say that this was a great way to end my trip. The food was awesome! We started off with the prosciutto wrapped dates stuffed with gorgonzola and topped with honey. Such a delicious dish. The sweet and salty combination with the smooth taste of the cheese made this dish great. Not too salty and not too sweet, just perfect. Linguine with clams was the star of this meal. The noodles were cooked perfectly and had a good amount of clams inside. There was a hint of spiciness which I loved. Didn't feel greasy or too heavy with the sauce they used. Definitely recommend this dish! Duck prosciutto with arugula pizza. Thin crust pizza which I love because you don't get full off of the pizza bread. I always love the taste of arugula on my pizza so I enjoyed this dish too. Nothing too special about this dish, but still very good. The restaurant is huge on the inside, but it gets busy during peak hours! Since it's tapas style, it's good to try a few plates and share with friends."
"I will preface this review by saying that although I love tapas and small plates, I am not a huge fan of Italian food in general. This means that this place is really good!I come here pretty regularly because my future mother in law loves Italian and lives downtown, so it's really convenient, and they take reservations. (This is really important- Quartino is always crowded, even at 3:00 PM on a Monday, so you need reservations or you will be in for a long wait).This place is designed for sharing, but we have pretty divergent tastes, so we aren't typically able to. The MIL enjoys the house made pastas, the fiance invariably orders some type of pizza, and I prefer one of the meet entrees paired with a salad or some roasted veggies. I do think think this would be more fun to come with someone who has similar tastes- some of the antipasti look really delicious!Two important things: the tables are really crammed in, so expect to have a difficult time navigating to your seat, and this place is SUPER loud."
"Great place for large parties. Been here about 4 times and it's always deliciously consistent. Everything is good, from the pasta dishes to the veggie dishes.  The meats are so mouthwatering as they fall off the bone and melt in your mouth.Had pizza for the first time on my most recent visit. We got the margharita...it was truly phenomenal. Great service too. Solid place and always a long wait....which tells you that there's something special going on here!"
"i love quartino! I've been coming here for years and am always pleased with my experience.  If you're looking for a quaint, quiet, romantic dinner, this is not where you will find that.  I love coming here with girlfriends and drinking wine, trying lots of different things and laughing!  It's the perfect spot to meet friends.Some of my personal favorites are: The goats milk ricotta with bread... Amazing.  I work in River North and sometimes come get this for lunch. the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese pasta, the pizzas, among others.a couple things i DIDN'T love..  The shrimp.. it wasn't bad.. just not as flavorful as i would have liked, and the chicken soup.  The soup was very carrot tasting.  nice chunks of chicken, though!  While it may not be my favorite, it could be yours!"
"Group friendly, loud, tons of tables, open late. Quartinos is an Italian tapas and wine bar that can appeal to everyone! The menu is vast with pastas, pizzas, salads...foods not to miss: polenta fries with red pepper sauce (amaaaaazingly tasty!), margherita pizza (perfect and simple) and the paparedelle with braised beef(the beef just melts in your mouth).The wine carafes are awesome in their variety but definitely can get a bit pricey. My go to late night place (when I can snag a table!)"
"I love the ambiance. I love the food.  Even for us vegetarians. It's tough for this place to ever beat Davanti, but it's as close as it can be in my eyes. I've come here a few times. For birthdays. For random summer evenings. For anniversaries. And i've enjoyed it lol. The wait in summers are a bit annoying but winters here are the best. Come on a random weeknight in the cold months and you will be rewarded with a feeling of Christmas family warmth. The food is always consistently good.  Pizza is delicious. Options for wine and sizes are diverse and perfect in so many ways."
"Walked in solo on a crisp December night, wasn't sure eating by myself was the best choice. The place is buzzing with young diners, not an empty table to be found.My fears were quickly allayed; the hostess couldn't have been nicer. Unbeknownst to me the manager, Ryan, followed me to the bar, introduced himself, and made me feel like I had been eating here for years.The food was very good, comparable to much pricier steak joints. This is a place I'll come back to as much for the people and high-energy atmosphere as for the food."
"The waiter was friendly and attentive, and he recommended the best dishes!I remember not having enough room for dessert but completely fallen for the chocolate cake, which was referred to as ""emotional"".All other dishes my girl friend and I ordered were fab! The short rib was a bit too meaty for me, but it tasted great! I loved the octopus and the pasta~"
"The server was excellent. She recommended the best Parma martini, very sweet. The dishes were excellent, including the octopus, caprese salad, and fettuccine demare di mare with clams, shrimp, octopus. Mi Encanta."
"Recently had dinner here with a couple of girlfriends. We ate so much and every thing we ordered was great. Fondue, white bean & garlic, meatballs, pizza and plenty of wine and desserts. I thought our bill was going to be pretty hefty because we ordered so much food (even more than whats listed) It was so inexpensive! Service is great here as well. I will definitely be back here.The only reason I gave this 4 and not 5 stars is that they really cram the tables in there. I really felt like everyone was on top of each other. (disclaimer: it was a Friday Night and they were packed) but I still don't want people all around me on top of me. I literally could touch everyone who was seated around me. One couple next to my friend was literally shoulder to shoulder. We actually shared appetizers with them and vice versa."
"Wasn't sure what to expect going here as it was a suggestion. Biggest concern was noise level as some reviewers mentioned it van get loud. When we arrived the noise was moderate but did increase as the tables around ua filled up. It didn't ruin our experience so just want to note that. Our server was very pleasant and helpful. Advised that it's a ""small/shared"" plates menu and pasta is made fresh so one person may get their food faster. I had the Osso Bucco with two others ordering pasta dishes and the 4th person ordering a fish soup of sorts. We did all share a margherita pizza to start. Everyone was pleased with theiw dishes. I felt the Osso Bucco was a bit over salted but it was fall off the bone tender. Oh the carafe of wine we had was quite nice too. For dessert we had the sorbet trio and chocolate molten cake. The cake was divine. I would go back here and suggest it to others."
Love the meats and cheeses. The pasta with lamb was amazing. Interested to check out more
"Quartino's is absolutely charming -- the restaurant and bar were lavishly built but still manage to feel comfortable and cozy and the service is fantastic. The food, however, is just decent. I came on a Saturday night when all the reservations were full and managed to snag a tiny table at the bar and crammed myself and three friends around it. Our waitress was super attentive (but not overly so).We had the calamari (which was fried perfectly and could have been absolutely delicious but was underseasoned), the sausage pizza, and the quattro stagioni pizza. The pizzas were generous with the toppings and the crust was done well but, again, lacking in flavor. The meal without drinks came out to $38 for four people, which was okay, but I would have been outlandishly underwhelmed if I had had to wait around for a table or restructure my plans around one of their hard-to-get reservations."
"Came here on a Sunday night and we thought there wouldn't be too bad of a wait but were given a 45 minute wait time. Hostess said we can sit outside immediately, wait for a bar which was first come/first serve, or we can wait. It was nice outside, so we decided on that rather than the wait.We ordered the Salumeria Tasting and the gnocchi, along with a 1/4 litre of Barbera D'Alba and a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand (wish we got the name of this one because it was really good!). Both the salumeria tasting and gnocchi were equally satisfying and was the perfect amount of food for us since we weren't STARVING but we weren't not hungry either. For the salumeria tasting, you must get the duck proscuitto, as many of the other reviews here recommend! It's delicious!Our server was very attentive and service was fast! Wish we could have come back here again to try other items on their menu!"
"Can I start off by saying I think Quartinos is very very over hyped? After failing to dine at several other restaurants because of their ridiculous wait times we came to Quartinos, with over 2,000 reviews I expected to have a decent dining experience upon walking in. First off, we were a group of 4 and I kid you not we had to be seated 3 different times. The first 2 times they placed us in the most absurd areas, the places where no one wants to sit, by the corner near the kitchen where employees are constantly carrying plates walking around saying excuse me. The third time was a charm and we were finally able to eat. Now onto their drinks, the cocktails we ordered by the bar were good, a little pricey but what do you expect nowadays. Once we were seated we ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table. Not impressed.....I think we were spoiled by the sangria at cafe ba-ba-reeba which comes with actual fruit pieces in the pitcher and comes super chilled with ice. Here they passed around cups with ice and shriveled up, unappetizing looking pieces of fruit in it. Sangria was very warm and the pitcher almost looked kind of old and dirty. Finally, the food. We ordered a couple of things.Calamari- their calamari was good but how do you really screw that up?Shrimp- pretty good but nothing amazingFetuccine alfredo- again your typical fettuccine alfredo pasta that I could probably make at home Soprano pizza- eh we ordered this one because my boyfriend wanted something with meat on it but I think it almost would have been better without the sausagesGnocchi- DO NOT I repeat do not order this. It was SO bland it was almost like I was just chewing on plain dough with absolutely no flavor. I kept telling myself it tasted better with Tabasco but everyone at the table said it was just because now I was tasting the Tabasco My favorite was probably the Nutella sandwich we ordered for dessert. I don't know if we were having an off night at Quartinos or ordered all the wrong things but as of right now I've tried so many better places in Chicago I will not be making my way back here."
"Me and 6 other ladies went here for a friend's birthday dinner. If you're coming on a weekend, definitely make a reservation as it was PACKED. Thankfully, we made a reservation so we didn't have to wait at all. Although we were told this is typically ""tapas"" or family-style, we opted to order our own dishes due to peoples' varied tastes. For whatever reason, the server seemed annoyed that we decided not to do family-style. From that point on, our server wasn't the nicest (1st star down for customer service). I ordered the homemade gnocchi which was very good, but not 4-star+, amazing good. The gnocchi was about $10.75, so not bad at all for the portion size and quality. That being said, I've had better Italian food elsewhere in Chicago (Briciola in Ukrainian Village for example, comes to mind). Finally, the ambiance of Quartino was not my cup of tea. It was quite LOUD and hard to have a conversation with anyone not sitting next to you. I personally prefer more intimate settings. So for the 3-star food quality and non-ideal ambiance, another star down. Maybe I'm just not a Michigan Ave kinda gal...."
"This place was recommended to me by a coworker for a nice date night spot. Me and my boyfriend went on a Tuesday night around 7:30pm and the place was packed, always a good sign! Nonetheless we were seated promptly and greater by our server, a nice young gentleman. We ordered a pizza and calamari, along with a white wine. The food came out very quickly and was super fresh and hot when we received it. The calamari was excellent. The best I've had actually, and it's one of my favorite foods so I eat it frequently. I would go back here just for the calamari one day. While the seafood was a knockout, the found the pizza to be just so-so. The pizza sauce was very bland, tasting almost like a simple tomato paste. It left a lot to be desired. My coworker mentioned the pasta is very good here, but we didn't try any pasta dishes so I can't speak to that. Overall, the ambiance was nice. There is outdoor seating on both a patio and balcony. Id recommend the balcony for more privacy or the patio if you prefer to city watch and enjoy the hussle and bustle of the city going by. We'll probably be back here but we'll skip the pizza next time!"
"Great restaurant.  Food, service, location here it is all in one.  My server was Isaac.  I will be back!!!!"
Went here last night with my girlfriend for dinner. We are from NJ and wanted some authentic Italian food. This place was amazing. The salami and cheeses are all fresh and delicious. We had a bottle of wine for $15 that was great also. It is a tapas restaurant with small dishes but they are very filling. We ordered the meatballs with red sauce and the ribbon pasta dish. Both were amazing. Highly suggested coming here and you need to call early to get a reservation. The restaurant gets very busy.
Great ambience. Quick service. Some tapas were good and some were little salty. Good place for a late night snack/dinner. Very close to Grand red station.
"All things considered, absolutely one of the best restaurants in the city.  Top-notch food at a reasonable price, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and a large space (so relatively easy to get a seat) but set up well so that you don't feel like you're in a sea of people.  Great for groups (with a reservation) and for a fun date night.  Highly recommended!!"
"Amazing atmosphere! Went here with my boyfriend on a Friday night and it was so nice! There were parties and families while still a great place for a date. We ordered a bottle of the Malbec, great choice! The Shrimp Risotto was my favorite! Definitely a new favorite and for sure going back!"
"The food here is quite good and very reasonably priced for the area. The menu is relatively ""authentic"" as far as Italian restaurants in the US go. I appreciated that they had a pizza marinara, which is pretty standard in Italy but seen as an aberration in the US. For $8 I had the delicious pizza marinara which was a very filling dinner. Il problema è che nessuno qua parla italiano!! Perché non ci sono ristoranti italiani a Chicago con persone che parlano italiano?? Non è giusto."
- Beyond expectations -Dropped in with a small appetite this place was perfect Most dishes can be split into 1/2 portions.The ravioli was excellent Service was friendly helpful and fastTiramisu was perfect and plentiful even with a 1/2 portion.Recommend Will as the bartender he will take care of you!Would definitely come back!
"Quartino Italian Tapas Restaurant in Chicago is, thus far, the best italian restaurant I have found on this planet- and it isn't expensive either! Shout out to a bartender named Holly...no BS the best bartender ive had in recent memory. She was really awesome,  and having never been there before I asked her to just bring me the three best dishes- they were all winners!"
This place. Is. Awesome.  I'm staying at a local hotel and trusted Yelp to tell me where to go. I'm glad I did. Drinks: espresso martini x3Food: tortelliniService: highlight of the night. Very approachable and social. Treated me like family while sitting at the bar.
Amazing food with great options. It's nice to get a steak from their sister restaurant across the street at Gibsons. I also love the soda options and the ability to send a postcard (they'll send it for you at no cost) for no other reason than the novelty of entire thing. The only reason this does not get five stars is the service is kind of sub-par.
"I love the smaller portion sizes which allowed us to order a pizza and another dish to try and share. It's noisy and crowded but it contributes to the ambiance. The food was really good! Rigatoni, pizza, pappardelle with beef, a seafood dish...topped with limoncello for dessert."
Wow. Been coming to Chicago multiple times a year for sixteen years. Never knew about this place until tonight. Amazing food and amazing service. I will eat here every time I'm in town.
"We ended up here because we were in the neighborhood and it was one of the few places that was open and actually still serving food! Yay. We sat outside which was fun for people watching :) Also I LOVE that they offer wine in varying quantities just like Italy and not just by the glass or bottle. And the wine was great :) The pasta here is authentic so much better than other places. I forget exactly what the portion was called, but I was able to order a smaller portion which was very much appreciated. It was the perfect size. I got linguini with clams which delicious. I forget what my friend ordered, but she liked hers as well. I'd highly recommend this place especially if you are looking for a late night spot for food."
Stopped in here for lunch for a latte and mushroom rissoto.  It was delicious and I would certainly go back! Service was great and there was a private room to rent upstairs for special events. This would be a great place to go with a group of people...I highly suggest it.
"Quartino' is in the perfect location. Shopping coma first, Italian food coma second. This was my experience:-Early dinner on a Wednesday around 530- so no wait. Patrons who arrived around 7 had about a 20-30 min wait. Restaurant was fairly packed by 630pm. -Wait staff was very helpful, responsive and quick. Didn't have to wait a long time to flag her down! Which was great. -appetizer: chicken noodle soup. Really good flavor, risotto gave great texture. Not too salty, perfectly spiced. -main: Arrabbiata spaghetti with meatball. Sauce was really good. Just a hint of heat, could have used some more. I added red pepper flakes to increase the spice. Meatball was great! -dessert: lemon sorbet. THIS was great. Very light and refreshing. Wasn't too sweet or bitter lemon. A nice clean way to end my meal and close up the palate.-wine: I did a 1/4L of the Pinot Gris and it was very good! Paired well with my chicken soup and pasta.Thanks Quartino! 4 star instead of 5 because I've had better (spicier) Arrabbiata sauce. Otherwise service and atmosphere was 5/5!"
"Best Italian in town - affordable, quality food + service. I always make sure that I make a stop here whenever I make a trip up to Chicago. Their food + service never disappoints you. The hostesses and waiters are super friendly, efficient, and consistent. All meals come with a bread basket (bottomless) and the waiters are very good about making sure your water glass is never empty. Portion sizes run just perfect - not too overwhelming, not too small. They leave you satisfied. Dishes to try: - I'm not usually a veal fan, but I highly recommend the Veal Meatballs Napoli. - Orecchiette Pasta- Linguine with Clams (Red/white sauce = both awesome)- Romaine Hearts or Wild Arugula SaladI can't wait to go back to try their pizza dishes!Tip: They have an awesome lunch special - 3 course menu, $25 for 2 people!"
"My friend and I decided on Quartino for our lunch. I have been here for dinner before a few months ago and it was super busy in the main dining room. When we arrived it was slightly dead so we opted to sit in bar area. The squid was good and seasoned ok. The veal meatballs were really good and so were the mussels we ordered. The drinks were very refreshing and made very well. Then we chose to do the Salumeria Tasting and we made some good and blah chooses. While enjoying our late lunch , all of a sudden we just notice that the whole bar and most of the dining area became full. We were there probably an hour but we were glad that we were able to come before the rush. Overall a lively atmosphere and good italian tapas style food."
"I visited Quartino's a couple of years ago with some dear friends, and again on Friday night for a bachelorette party, and I had an amazing experience both times. On my most recent trip, our table split the mushroom risotto, pancetta wrapped dates, margherita pizza, penne alla vodka, meatballs, and white bean & garlic spread. The pancetta wrapped dates especially stood out to me - as did the pasta dish and the meatballs. The fondue for dessert was fantastic. I highly recommend this restaurant, and definitely suggest you get reservations."
Delicious food every time I've been here. Last night was the tasting plate (tons of food!) and a fennel sausage pizza. Very attentive staff with great recommendations.
"A friend and I were looking for nice dinners on a really late week night. We were pleasantly surprised that Quartino opened until 2am. Their food was fantastic! We had the veal steak and a dish of seafood cooked in tomato-based soup (with squid, calamari, shrimp and clamps)! For dessert, we had cannoli which was also very very delicious (even more delicious than those sold in Eataly). I will definitely come back here for late night cravings!"
"Awful customer service. I had a reservation for my boyfriend and I for my 21st birthday and they gave us the worst seat. They then proceeded to celebrate the birthday of the girl at a table next to us, but ignored me. Food was good for some plates but awful on others. And then the bill was outrageous!"
"This place is so solid. It's amazing for groups. If you have a huge group this is where to go. I've been there with 22 people, 12 people, 8 people. They are super accommodating, and it's a huge venue so it's easy. The food is great! It's italian sharing plates so you should just get a ton of different dishes and try as much as you can. My absolute favorites are the tortellini, penne a la vodka, short rib, & Ravioli. They have great sangria too and wine."
Never in my life has a manager left the restaurant to run to the store to see if they could get us a gluten free option that wasn't on the menu. Every staff member was courteous and professional and the food was phenomenal. A must have in chicago
"One of my favorite patios in River North for a quick bite and killer sangria. If the second story patio is open,  request to be up there. The pizza with ricotta is one of my favorite, but I would skip the procuitto wrapped dates next time. Another gem in river north, not to be missed!"
"I was downtown with two friends today and we were looking for a place to eat lunch at. Unfortunately it was St. Patrick's Day so everything was super crowded... EXCEPT Quartino had tables! My roommate had recommended this place to me earlier this year so we decided to stop there for lunch.We were seated really quickly and given menus and bread (which, by the way, is freshly sliced with a cool machine and actually delicious with their olive oil and balsamic vinegar). However, it seemed that they expected us to order immediately and when we didn't, they just kind of left us and forgot to come back and take our order. I had to flag them down in order to put in our order, BUT the food did come out pretty quickly afterwards.EXCELLENT (would absolutely order again): Panino al Gelato Limone - lemon cream gelato sandwiches with lemon curd, whipped cream, and lemon chips. The scoops of lemon cream gelato were very generous and lemony and delicious, but the sandwiches were made of sponge cake (a little firmer, I think) and they were SO GOOD. They were soaked in lemon curd and topped with whipped cream... we talked about this dessert for the whole way back to campus. This is definitely a must-order dish.PRETTY GOOD (would probably order again): The pappardelle with braised beef. The beef wasn't a standout for me, but I loved the toothiness of the pappardelle strips, which were cooked perfectly. The veal meatballs in tomato/raisiny sauce were also really good because the sauce was a touch sweet and the meatballs were very tender and well-seasoned.AVERAGELY GOOD (probably would skip next time): The calamari was a little too oily and heavy and salty for our taste, but I can see why so many people on Yelp love it. Also the kale salad was good, but it seemed like something I could toss together at home if I tried hard enough.Overall our bill was 52 bucks without tip, so for three people, that was pretty good! I definitely want to come back and try more pastas and pizza."
"Food was decent and affordable. Seating is arranged to fit maximum numbers of people in the space. Noise level was very high.  Be prepared to dodge at least one person while standing or moving in this restaurant. Move 'em in, move 'em out, that's the name of the game."
"Quartino is a great spot for a date, or a group of friends interested in trying a number of Italian dishes... Went a few weeks ago, and along with some wine tried much of what is recommended in other reviews - bruschetta, veal meatballs, pancetta wrapped dates, a pizza, and the orechiette & sausage pasta dish. Give high marks to the dates, meatballs and the orechiette, for sure. This place is especially good on an afternoon / evening with nice weather if you can find a spot on their patio. Add it to the rotation!"
Went for our anniversary ...Food was fantastic ... Crowd was a little loud but cute little restaurant .. Our waitress was so quick and short with us no smile at all didn't make it anything special
"I went to Chicago for a food tour this past November. My two coworkers and I sat at the bar and sampled desserts and cocktails at Quartino. Both were incredible! We ordered the Limoncello and Espresso Martinis and the Tiramisu and the Coppa-Al Banana. The martinis were beautifully crafted, delicious, and effective. The server gave us an extra caramelized banana with our Coppa-Al Banana because she insisted that they were the best part. O man, she was right!This experience was such a treat! The perfect solution to our sugar cravings. I can only imagine that the lunch and dinner meals would be amazing as well."
"I've been to Quartino twice--once about a year ago and once last night. Both times were delicious!A heads up: the set-up is optimal for parties that want to share (since all of their plates are designed to share and come out in any order when they are ready in the kitchen).Food: All of the homemade pastas are fantastic, so I would recommend them over the imported pastas (although my dad loved the linguine with clams). The burrata salad is definitely a highlight (with beets and arugula). Oh, and the cauliflower side is very unusual but entirely delicious (it's one whole cauliflower baked with breadcrumbs and garlic and sitting on pesto, so you cut it up at the table. So good, but warning: it's huge... enough for like 5 or 6 people!)  Other: I bought a cool Italian Giro and Gratta cheese and cheese grater appliance (it comes with 1 wedge of quality grana padano cheese and rotary grater). Hard to explain, but it's really neat. Would make a nice little gift.Will be back again, hopefully soon!"
Really enjoyed dinner here - I am gluten free and they had great choices and also had gluten free crackers for salami plate. Just a wonderful atmosphere and terrific food-authentic Italian.
"I'm not sure I buy into the whole 'Italian tapas' angle, which is why the slightly lower rating. I like my pasta portions to be hearty, and this place doesn't deliver on that. The food is pretty good, although I wish there had been more of it.The location/ ambience is nice, with old movies playing in the background, but I think it's definitely a little bit too crowded. They try and fit a lot of tables and people into the area, and it left us feeling a little cramped.One last tip, I don't believe tiramisu is on the menu, but it was available upon request, which I enjoyed."
An absolutely great experience!  The staff here was very welcoming with great service.  They also had a great wine list and the food was superb at a reasonable price! To top it off the atmosphere was a lot of fun.  I would recommend sitting outside on the patio where it doesn't get quite so loud when they're real busy which appears to be most of the time.
just move here in Chicago from italy and I really wont to find the traditional taste of my country. I could say that the place was cloudy and the barman was not so friendly. I tried his pizza but was not so good. It was too thin and flabby. I have to say that the house wine was very good and it was chip. The ambient is rustic but nice.To try one time!
"Sat on the balcony with perfect weather.  This night was pretty prefect from the company, view, food and drinks.  Ordered a class of wine but it was more like 2.  The veal meatballs were extremely good and so was the eggplant pizza.  Friend ordered a dirty martini which looked really good as well.  Service was okay as well.  Defiantly somewhere you need to visit if you're around the area."
"I went here with some friends for restaurant week. The waiter we had was very knowledge about the food, is friendly and attentive. The service was great cuz the waiter always come back from time to time to see how we were doing. My friend and I share the prefixe menu which was great except my friend didn't care for her chicken soup and I didn't care for the zeppole because it wasn't good. I had way better zeppole in NYC. I sample my friends mushroom risotto and it wasn't that good because the rice didn't look right to me. Overall I will come back to this restaurant to try other dishes on the menu."
I found this restaurant when looking around the hotel and online saw they do a great lunch special. A 3-course meal for two for $25. It was awesome!! Everything we ordered was delicious and with that price tag it was just perfect! Definitely suggest their house red wine.
"I was here for a birthday dinner and I can't really comment on the food - but the bottle of riesling we ordered was delicious, and so was the bread. As it happened, I had had a very late lunch and so wasn't hungry at all when it came time for dinner, but I had the wine and several plates of bread, and the waiters weren't pushy at all about me not ordering any food. Fantastic experience."
"The ambiance and service is ordinary, but the food is actually fresh and delicious rustic Italian. I'm vegetarian, and I absolutely love the homemade minestrone soup. Also the arugula salad with orange and pine nuts is very fresh and fantastic, as well as the sauteed spinach with lots of fresh garlic and lemon. It's Italian countryside food in a casual environment. If you select the right foods, you can eat healthy here while enjoying great taste."
"This place is pretty happening. I would say It's a great spot for lunch or dinner and their prices don't break the bank. They have the classic Italian wine glasses (no stems, and look more like a small rocks glass)."
"Great place.   It only gets four stars because the tables are really crowded close together. Uncomfortably close.  It's a fusion of Italian and tapas. We had a sampler:  3 salads, 2 cheeses, 2 salami, and an olive assortment. It also came with a nut bread and apricot purée. Salad # 1:  some sort of eggplant - it was just fair. Salad #2 :  roasted beets with ricotta.  I hate beets and I really liked this oneSalad # 3:  a not very memorable artichoke dish.Salami  #1:  duck prosciutto - nice!Salami #2.   Black truffle.  Delicious. Extensive wine list sold by the carafe:  quarter, half, or full liter. There are hidden deserts not on the menu:  tiramisu that was delicious.  The canolis were great too.Overall a good experience.  Decent food. Excellent server!!!"
"The food was excellent, and the servers went above and beyond out of there way to make sure your dining experience is excellent."
"I wasn't particularly impressed with this restaurant. Seems to cater to families and dates. Vibe and environment is fun and I love the authentic Italian vibe.I began the night with polenta fries, dates, veal meatballs and short rib. The dates were definitely the highlight. Both meat dishes were pretty good too. I wanted the polenta fries to have more of a kick but it was fine to try it.Concluded the evening with tiramisu which was phenomenal. They have fondue on their menu which I would have next time. Also enjoyed wine through the evening - pretty good selection there.Recommended for family visit to Chicago - use open table to make reservations if you don't want to wait."
Luv the tapas here and what a wide selection to choose from! Their Alfredo pasta is amazing and their pizza is delish as well. It's a very busy restaurant no matter what time you go there . Make sure to make a reservation especially for the wrens and holidays. In a great location in the hub of restaurants near state street.
"Visited for the first time this week.  Our server was very nice and patient with me as I asked all of my questions.  He was very knowledgeable on the menu and helpful in helping me make my decisions which wasn't easy because of all of the selections.   In addition, they have 1/2 orders of most everything making it more like Italian tapas.Now on to the food.  First I had the homemade chicken soup with risotto.  It was tasty with all fresh ingredients but the risotto was really just rice.  The only bad thing that I had to say about it was that it was underseasoned.  There was also bread on the table along with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and a cheese similar to Parmesan, but better (can't remember the name).For the main dish, I had a half order of the Cavatelli and a half order of the Tortellini. The waiter recommended I stay with the homemade pasta so I did and I wasn't disappointed.  The pasta was very well made and cooked.  While I don't normally order tortellini, I'm glad I did as it was the best of all of the food that I ordered.  The cavatelli pasta itself was very good, however, the sauce could have been more flavorful.All in all a very good experience and I would go back."
"I have been here several times and it is always an eating experience. It is usually very busy, and I would encourage a reservation on a weekend. The atmosphere is lively, with friendly waitstaff and fun, Italian inspired decor. We have celebrated birthdays, Mother's Day, and most recently my bachelorette party here. The food is phenomenal and everyone is able to find something they will enjoy, although it is a ""small plates"" concept and sharing is encouraged.I would honestly say you can't go wrong with the food; it is all delicious and will leave you wanting more. Their house wines are also good (and cheap!). It is definitely an overall experience and I love coming back here to try new dishes each time."
"I loved this place! The steak, salad and gluten free pasta were delicious. The gelato was amazing! I would definitely go back."
"We had reservation and was seated immediately.I saw people without reservations  being turned away.The  restaurant was completely booked for the night.We had the roasted baby octopus with braised escarole.We had the beef short ribs.We had the osso  buco.We had the panino al gelato limone (lemon cream gelato sandwich with lemon curd, whipped cream and lemon chips).We also had the zeppole  with honey and chocolate. I did notlike this. Anyone who had NYC zeppole will agreed that this zeppole does not measured up. The middle collapse on touch. The dough is not good.We also had a coke and a lemonade.Everything is tapas."
"Quartino's is on my go-to list when suggesting a place to take out of town guests who want a nice, delicious meal, while staying within the professional, nice, but not too fancy atmosphere. The wine selection is particularly enticing here, because there were 4 different wine size carafes to choose, and with lot of wines on the list, there's flexibility to try a little bit of a lot of affordable wines. The small plates also offer up a diverse selection of Italian tapas, so you don't have to worry about picky eaters, because everyone can find something they like!"
"This review is for my accounting/actuary/banking friends, yes...for all of you considered high C's on the DISC scale. My overall rating is actually a 4.6 but I've rounded up to a 5.0. Yelp, please allow us to rate with quarter points! In any event, here is the final assessment and I've added commentary when necessary.-Margherita pizza - 4 stars (crust could be crispier)- Salumeria tasting - 4 stars (awesome sliced salami and spuntini - whatever that is)- Gnocchi - 3 stars (reminded me of Ming Hin's rolled noodles)- Fettuccine alfredo - 3 stars- Penne alla vodka - 3 stars (Yes, you can taste the vodka)- Sauteed Spinach - 4 stars (Yummy so we got two)- Crisp Calamari - 5 stars (This is the best of the best)- Brodetto ai frutti di mare - 4 stars (Think paella in a pot, and if you like to soak up your bread with broth, then this is for you my countryside friend). - Beef fillets - 3 stars (two small medallions)- Prosciutto san daniele - 4 stars- Reisling - 4 stars- Rioja - 4 stars- Cappucino - 4 stars- Tira Misu - 4 stars- Copa banana - 5 stars (just awesome - yes, we got two)Service was 6 stars, we were treated so well. This type of food inspires one to visit Italy or Eataly."
"Small plate Italian food??  What an amazing idea.  I always leave Italian restaurants feeling uncomfortably stuffed.  Quartino not only allows you to select different small plates to share with your group but also doesn't require you to eat a massive bowl of pasta meeting your suggested carb intake for the entire month... (don't get me wrong, there is definitely a time and a place for a huge bowl of pasta).  Since it is small plates and you don't have to commit to one entree for the entire meal, I have tried (and LOVED) many things that I would have never ordered a huge portion of.  So, the experience and setup for the restaurant is definitely a plus in my book.The food is also very tasty here and it is a great place to go if you are a vegetarian or pescatarian.  As a pescatarian, I have had no problem finding plenty to eat here.  Since I've been several times I'll list a few of my favorites that I HAVE to order each time I go:Wild arugula salad- awesome flavors and a great fresh start to a mealEggplant Parmigiana- comes out piping hot, oozing cheese and in the pan they broiled it in...Steamed clams- you get a ton of clams in this delicious brothZeppole with dark chocolate- my favorite desert at this restaurant, so good!Now my meat eater husband and friends would say that you have to try the dates wrapped in pancetta. So if meat's your thing, you know their favorite.  I personally don't think you can make a bad choice with food here.  I have tried so many different things and have been please with each choice.  As far as beverages go, you can buy wine by the liter (just like in Italy) for a very reasonable price and their cheaper bottles are decent wine.Keep in mind, as other reviewers have mentioned, this place is loud.  If noise of happy eaters doesn't bother you, then you're in for a treat!"
"Great meal! Come with a large group, as the dishes are meant to be shared as a group. The atmosphere is loud and boisterous, so it might be difficult to have conversations across the table. I came with seven of my friends and tried almost nine dishes. Everything on the dinner menu was good to excellent. Favorites include the duck prosciutto pizza, fried calamari, and shrimp risotto. The dessert menu was decent not great: Nutella Panino: 5/5 -- excellent mini Nutella sandwiches  Biscotti de Basa: 1/5 -- biscuits were too hard, completely soaked in sugar, and unappetizing for most part; not recommended Zeppole 3.5/5 -- hot mini donuts with either chocolate spread or honey spread; a bit dry; expected more flavor"
Everything is delicious from the olives and salami to the pasta and pizza. The wine is also very cheap!
Great place.  Friendly staff great food(the goat cheese ricotta was great).   Pasta delicious.  We had the pappardelle.
"I visit Chicago a lot for various work/personal trips and every time I take to yelp to pick out a few dining options, Quartino's pops up on my list!  So finally, this past trip, I remembered to make a reservation ahead of time!Since the menu is based on sharable plates, this place is great if you have a larger group.  It also looked like there were several parties being hosted there, so it looks like they are pretty accommodating as well.We were just a party of 3, but we did manage to try a good amount of food!.Veal Meatball Slider - yum!  but, it literally is just ONE slider, note there is no ""S"", so order multiples so everyone can try it...or you'll only be getting a bite!Polenta Fries - pretty good and worth a try!  I would still prefer regular fries, but this is still a good choice!  Just keep in mind that it's kind of heavy, if you want to try other dishes.Wild Arugala Salad - pretty standard salad, but just what we needed to break up all the carbs and fried stuffCalamari - the best I've had!  Not heavy or greasy at all!Tortellini - I'm not a huge fan of cream sauces, but the prosciutto was a good pairing with this pastaBroccoli Rabe - again a nice break from the carbs and fried stuffService was great and they were the perfect amount of attentiveness (not constantly interrupting, but also not MIA).  We also appreciated how extensive the wine menu was and that all the wines were categorized by Light, Medium and Full Bodied.  It made selecting a wine from their vast selection so much easier!"
"love love love.  We havee had a holiday party here for the past 5 years.  They have donated to my fundraiser.  Food for everyone, cheap.  I am not writing a huge review cause every thing you need to know is in other reviews.  Stop reading and just go."
"The food- NOT good- everything was either bland or had a fishy taste to it staff- really niceloud, Italian, cozy, family style place"
"A group of my friends planned to go to Quartino's for a birthday dinner. We had called ahead for a reservation and there none available so we decided to head up there anyway and wait. It was definitely packed but we got lucky and grabbed a table in the bar area within 5 minutes. We got a bottle of wine and each picked a pasta. All delicious and small plates to share with one another. The food does not all come out at once, but just as each plate is ready. The first two plates came out about 8 minutes before the last two.Over all, I was very happy with the service and pleased with how quick the food was served. I enjoyed the atmosphere and would love to go back!Tortellini was delicious! :)"
"Met my girlfriend for dinner last week.  Sat outside which was pleasant though noisy.  The service was great but the kitchen was definitely off that night.  The fried calamari was quite rubbery and the small shallow dish with sauce is ridiculously small for the order of calamari.  The pizza margherita was marginal.  The crust was dark brown to black leaving 1/3 of the pizza very hard to chew (and we were hungry).  That left about 2/3rds of the pizza as edible with good crust wise but it was very bland and unremarkable.  Had better often, including the last time we held a family dinner at Quartino.  The server was on top of things and very nice.  Other than that it was a disappointing dinner, particularly since I raved about the restaurant to my out of town guest.  #embarrassment"
"Great family style Italian food!  A must try while in Chicago! Friendly atmosphere and reasonable prices,"
"I come here about once a week. The pros are endless from the great food selection and quality, super friendly staff, fun atmosphere. The only con I can think of is the noise level gets high. Try it out with a group of people"
"Consistently satisfying and delicious and reasonable and wonderful service! Not enough good things to say about Quartinos. The sharing plates are great especially when it comes to pasta! Portions are generous but not overwhelming, and everything is so good, it's rare that I have any left to bring home. It's constantly bustling for dinner service and I've noticed a ton of families with small kids lately. Great for a casual but lovely date night or a nice celebratory group dinner."
"Superb!! We were in Chicago for four days and came here for two meals! The tapas seem kinda pricey - $7 to 10 for most, $15 for meats, but they are fairly large. My mom and I got three for a dinner. Arugula salad, mushroom and truffle risotto, and a seafood medley. All three were very good and the service was superb.Came back the next day for the $25/3-plate lunch special and had the gnocchi, summer shaved salad, and the pork shank. I didn't eat the pork shank but my mom said it was amazing and there were tons leftover! I think she ate if for three meals afterward.Pizzas and the antipasti selection looked great also, but we didn't have another meal to try it out!Check open table for reservations - somehow they're available while walk-ups are booked solid. Lively atmosphere, great food and service, and wonderful meal!"
Quartinos was good for a one time try. It's more of a tapas-Italian style place. The food seemed a bit pricey for what you get and it can get pretty loud inside. On the other hand service was fast and friendly.
The pappardelle was outstanding. I loved the fresh pasta and beef was excellent. Sat at the bar and the service was quick and very friendly. Highly recommended!
"Oh. my. gosh. This place was straight up chaos, but I say that lovingly. I love people watching and this place was fantastic for that. There is so much going on around you at all times. The food is delish and perfect to order throughout the evening. This was a very fun experience. Order a bottle of wine to split (in juice cups, of course), find some interesting foods, sit back, and enjoy the high paced madness around you."
"I've been here a few times now, both for late lunches and some dinners.  I always enjoy the food I've had here, the fresh pastas are tasty and although it's ""small plates"" meant for sharing, the portions are still pretty generous and the prices not overly expensive.  Their wines aren't bad either, although I've definitely gotten into trouble with friends when we thought 'ehh let's just order a liter'o'wine.. that's not THAT much right?' FALSE. A liter of wine between two people is more than you need for lunch. Whoops!  But overall my experiences are Quartino have been satisfactory.  I've had the odd 'meh' dish, but by and large the food is good and the service is decent. The tables ARE super close to each other though, so if sitting all up on some strangers at the next table isn't your gig, you may not enjoy Quartinos as much as I have in the past."
A great little place!Small plates and high prices make this a place I don't go often. But when I do go here I have a great time!
Everything is just par here. Nothing special and nothing to complain about.
"Soooo, here's the deal!! I just noticed that back in 2009 I gave this place 3 stars. What?! I've been back to Quartino at least a dozen times (if not more) since my last review, and I'm guessing it's because I love it!It's a great place for a big group, a date, to catch up with friends, or even to grab something at the bar by yourself.My favorite thing here is... drumroll please.... the red sangria!!!  It's my favorite sangria in Chicago, so BOOM! Go!"
"Stopped on a whim for lunch because I saw I could sit outside. It was the best choice for food!!! I started with the Fresh Tomato Basil Soup, with bread and Olive Oil. Delicious. As the remainder of my party arrived we ordered Cavatelli, Ravioli, and Fettuccine  Al Fredo. All were perfectly prepared, the service was impeccable. Very attentive! Realize this was an extremely busy time with the NFL DRAFT pick being in Chicago this weekend. So many more people! Yet everything went smoothly and the food and service was FANTASTIC. This was my first visit and when I get to return to Chicago I will definitely be back! Thank you for a wonderful lunch!The only thing I wish they could change is a bathroom on the first floor, I'm disabled and I was unable to climb the massive stairs to use restroom. I had a very difficult walk to Bloomingdales to use the Restroom. However, I got a souvanier Bloomingdales bag and diary. Turning lemons into lemonade!"
"Like that guy friend in college you could count on to be your last-minute plus-one to a date function, Quartino is dependable, fun, (and comes at a reasonable price) but not all that memorable or fantastic. The concept is tapas style, with an Italian flair.  So think roasted peppers, meats and cheeses, bruschetta, short ribs, etc., Neapolitan pizza.  Not a big fan of sharing?  There are pasta dishes that are a nice size for one person (or good for passing around).  The food is decently prepared and flavored, but nothing I continue to crave after I exit.   The wine and beer isn't too expensive (especially considering the River North location) and the environment is bustling and lively (but not so much that you can't enjoy the company you've arrived with).  It doesn't hurt to make reservations a day or two in advance, but you don't need to plan weeks and weeks ahead unless you have a big group (keep reading...)Note: It's a fun place to go with a group (although ordering/sharing is tricky the more people you have), and they take big reservations, but they won't seat you until your entire party is there.  I was once with 11 people, and they wouldn't seat our party of 14 until the three stragglers arrived.  C'mon, folks.  You are missing out on early food and booze orders from ELEVEN PEOPLE.  But c'est la vie."
"This place had such great reviews and having no idea what I wanted for dinner, my friend and I decided to venture here because they offered such a wide variety of tapas and great prices on drinks. I had their red sangria that was pretty good but their food was another story. We ordered their gnocchi and it was so thick and bland. The waitress was nice enough to give us a different sauce. We first tried it with argula pesto sauce but.. that was NOT happening. So we went with a red sauce instead. it was only slightly better. We also order their ""crisp"" calamari. I say ""crisp"" because it actually came out soggy. Such a disappointment. The next day, my friend and I felt so sick. I don't know what it was... but I'm not coming back."
"This is my go-to place in the city. I love the location, atmosphere, patio, decor, food, drinks, everything. It's reasonably priced, the orange cello martini is to die for and come to think of it... I've never had a bad experience their. Wait staff is always very friendly and knowledgeable. Step inside the restaurant and you don't feel like you're in the middle of Chicago. Love it."
"I really enjoyed Quartino. The food was great and I loved that you order for the table and can try lots of things. I absolutely love the pizzas. A perfect thin crust and a great balance on the toppings. They do not overwhelm. The wine selection is reasonably priced, not terribly fancy though. I would go here again as a fun out-with-the-girls place. We can try all the dishes together and the affordable price tag on the wine would be a bonus.My only real complaint about Quartino is how they seat you. Every available inch of space is consumed. Going to the ladies room was a task of weaving through tight tables. Because they seat so many people so close together, it can get pretty loud too. If you want to have a quiet conversation, this isn't the place. But if you are looking to get out with some friends, share some yummy dishes, and don't mind being shoved into a tight space, the food very good."
"FIRST things FIRST - The Tiramisu? Yes. Please. I'll take 5 to go.NEXT- The cheese plate? ya gotttta get it.ALSO- I didn't see Chicken Parm on the menu and the killer waiter, Lanny was like duhhh we will make it for you.THEN- Back to Lanny though, he was the best and genuinely seemed to like working there."
"I have been craving Quartino since going gluten free due to an intolerance 6 months ago. I found that they had a gluten free menu online, and was so excited to go. I was bummed they didn't have gfree pizza, but planned to get their gfree pasta. A manager, Alysia, stopped by to check on us and I suggested them getting gluten free crust. 20 minutes later, my favorite pizza was in front of me. Alysia ran to the nearby Trader Joe's and picked up gluten free crust so I could enjoy the pizza I had missed so much. She went above and beyond to be sure I was satisfied, and for that I am grateful. What a fantastic experience. I will surely be back soon! Thanks, Alysia and the wonderful Quartino staff. Your food is delicious and service is incredible!!"
This place is wonderful!The food and drinks are marvelous! When eating at this place I truly feel like I'm in Italy. (Yes I have been) this is the sort of place that makes Chicago what it is!Staff is terrific and service exceptional. I highly recommend to any and all.
"Quartino is a great spot to come with a large group and try a bunch of different things. The atmosphere is very lively and fun so coming with a larger group and being as gregarious as you like works perfectly at Quartino. I came in last night with six family members and we ordered a ton. I'll do my typical tapas like review...Salumeria Tasting: We tried out a bunch of different things. Everything was pretty good but they really skimp on the meat and cheese servings of this dish. Not sure if this is worth the value with that considered. D'Anitra & Sausage Pizze: This was really good. I was skeptical of the duck prosciutto but it was delicious and a great flavor combination as a whole. Not usually a fan of sausage pizza but this was very, very good. All in all I really enjoy how they cook their pizza.Pappardelle  & Tagliatelle: Both pastas were tasty but nothing special. Polenta Fries: A bit much for me. Was not a fan. White Bean & Garlic Spread: Not a fan of white beans so I probably would not order this one again. Crisp Calamari: Deliciousness in fried form. They do this right! Beef Short Rib: Five stars for this dish. I could've eaten the ENTIRE thing by myself. While I was not in love with everything we ordered I was in love with my experience at Quartino. All of the food was good and the atmosphere was great. I'd highly recommend grabbing an Open Table reservation and hitting this place up for a night of fun and good food."
"I don't usually go to a restaurant more than once because there are so many to try, but Quartino made me want to go again and again. I love the ambiance, the space, the food, and the prices.  The ambiance is dimly lit with lots of seating and multiple floors.  There are 2 floors and the place is usually filled with people so the atmosphere is loud, but in a good way if you know what I mean.  It's not too loud and definitely has that Italian noise vibe.  Moving on to the food.  The 2 most memorable dishes for me that I got both times I was there are:1) Porcini & Truffle risotto - contains prociini mushrooms and white truffles.  I can never resist truffles and absolutely love mushrooms.  The two together are heavenly!  How do I even start with this dish!  This is so delicious and just melts in your mouth.  The aromas you smell when this comes out will just take your breath away.  This stood out to me among all the appetizers and entrees my friends and I ordered.  This dish also made me a life-long risotto fan.  It's not too heavy or cheesy, but perfect.2) Gran Coppa Quartino - one of the best dessert dishes I've ever had.  3 Gelati with roasted hazelnuts and biscotti.  It's beautiful and ""mouth-wateringly"" delicious.  I still can't forget it after more than 1 year of not being in Chicago.  All the desserts are good, but this one looked the best to me.  It's not too creamy, not too big, beautiful presentation in a clear class cup and colors to all make me have a foodgasm as soon as I see it!  These 2 dishes come out to be about $30 and it was enough to fill my friend and I both when we split it.  The prices I feel are very reasonable for the quality.  The food is fresh when you go in during dinner hours.  You can get a variety of tapas dishes and share, which means you get to try everything!  The closing time of 1 am make this ideal for late night bite, but also definitely when you're really hungry.  Keep in mind you will need to wait about 30-45 minutes if you go in during peak times so I suggest trying to get there early or get a reservation (you can do this on opentable).  This is one of 2 restaurants in Chicago that I will always return to."
"Quartino screams girls night out, as long as you're loud talkers.  Food is really good, and the plates are great for sharing.  With a large group, we ordered one from each section, and everyone was pleased with the meal.  It's not the most authentic Italian meal I've ever had, but it definitely is great for a group with a variety of palettes and tastes."
"I really wanted to love this place! Italian-tapas style food, unlimited bread, cozy lighting, good service. The food was just nothing great. Everything, and I mean everything, that arrived to our table was lacking flavor. There were so many promising food options that we tried, but when when you have to fix your food, every time, it kind of kills the experience. The salt made it good, which means if it had been a bit more well seasoned from the get go, we would have had a winner."
Had a great dinner.  We started with drinks. A Martini a lemon flavor not sweet and so strong and great. Red Sangria great flavor Calamari great for sharing Duck pizza which was amazing must try Short rib pasta was amazing Dessert. -tiramisu not on menu but a must. -Italian donuts with chocolate a yummy Will come back again.
Tasty food in just the right portions. Just be sure to get there early as it can be a bit crowded.
"Good service, great authentic Italian food choices, nice location. Don't miss the house made pasta (especially cavatelli) and the Sicilian caponata! (I'm from Sicily)"
"Went here for a tasting menu of Italian delicacies and enjoyed it, but was not blown away.We started with a salumi plate (as one does) and highly enjoyed the house cured meats.  The antipasti were good, especially the giardiniera and the mint pea salad.  I am not an eggplant fan, but those who are highly enjoyed the ragout (caponata).For mains, we tried the Stracchi di Grano Arso (with broccoli rabe and lots o' garlic) which was very tasty, I could've eaten a whole plate of it myself.  The halibut baked in parchment paper is apparently a house specialty, but it didn't go over well at the table.  My fish was perfectly cooked, but it lacked flavor.  I don't think I would order it again.For dessert we had the Zeppole (italian doughnuts wich accompanying sauces) which we delicioso.  I wish we had more!Service for our large party was fantastic, the chef came out to speak to us and we admired his passion.  The general manager was very gracious and gave us his card in case we needed something upon our repeat visit.  I would go again and make different choices, hopefully it's better on the second round.The patio is great, I would love to sit there for hours enjoying a glass or two of sparkling.  Maybe on the next visit..."
"They have a wonderful lunch deal here ($25 for 3 courses for two people), this is true. Unfortunately, the food is only okay. I came here to catch up with a friend for lunch and this is what we tried:1) Fondue - melted cheese and cubed bread pretty much. We didn't realize that's what it would consist of, otherwise I don't think we would've opted for this. Also, the melted cheese was a tad grainy.2) Porcini and truffle risotto - flavors were good but it's missing something to give it a kick, a bit of meet or seafood would've been nice3) Veal milanese - pretty much two veal cutlets, breaded and fried on a bed of arugula. It seemed like it could've been hotter/fresher, and had already cooled down a bit by the time the dish arrived at our table.4) Panino al Gelato Limone - lemon gelato sandwich, this was the best part of the meal! A wonderfully creamy yet refreshing palette cleanser to end the meal.Overall, food was okay and the service was solid. Probably not worth it if it weren't for the lunch special, but I could come back to try more things for lunch in the future -- perhaps we just ordered wrong this time."
"First and foremost, the Saprano pizza me and my friend ordered was to DIE for. So good. One of the best pizzas I've had in years. It has meatballs and giardinara on it. Ugh, soooo yummy. And the pancetta-wrapped dates were obviously a hit. Other than that? The wine I had and the dessert we shared were just ok, kinda meh. Biggest complaint by far? It's so damn LOUD in there. We went on a Sunday night and it was jammed pack (how is this not a major fire hazard?). Like, we were sitting 2-3 feet apart and had to shout at each other, it was awful. I've never seen such a packed restaurant before. I will be back for that pizza, but know that this place is about the noisiest restaurants ever, and loudest I've ever been to. And oh yeah, they have tvs! Come on! How tacky. That pizza, tho."
"I can't believe this place has 2000+ reviews and it's definitely nowhere near the top restaurants of Chicago. But when you consider how this menu here is extensive enough to cater to everyone person's fancy (vegetarian, ""meatarian"", pescatarian) and the location is easy enough for tourists to locate, then I guess it makes sense why this place is ""popular"". The food is not mind blowing or phenomenally good. It does not give you a wow factor but it's decent enough.Beef carpaccio:Absolutely bland and tasteless. We've had a lot of carpaccio elsewhere and the slices of rare meat should at least have natural flavor. The slices were also all stuck together as we tried to lift some of the plate.White bean spread:Also absolutely bland. I never salt my food at restaurants but just to experiment if the spread would taste better, I sprinkled some salt and pepper over it. It was a tad bit better.Pappardelle with short rib sauce:Fresh pasta should always have the delicate chewy texture compared to the typical texture of dried pasta like spaghetti and linguine. The pappardelle definitely did not have that chewy texture and tasted more like dried pasta. While the short rib sauce was tasty, but it tasted shallow rather than having depth.Veal osso buco:The meat was extremely tender which is the only positive thing about the dish. The veal itself did not taste like it absorbed any of the sauce. Oddly, the veal had a ""sterile"" taste. It was as if they cooked the veal separately and then the sauce was poured over it.Profiteroles were pretty good but the tiramisu had too much cream.Our dinner there last right reminded us again of why Quartino will never be another Nico Osteria."
"I know this isn't going to be a popular review.....we had a very good experience at Quartino, but nothing was great.  It started when we walked in.  Even though we had a reservation, we still had to wait for our table, even though there were PLENTY of empty ones.I'll admit that I like the Italian tapas idea.  It's always fun to try multiple dishes.  But, nothing was excellent and left me wanting more.  The dishes also vastly ranged in size. I'd recommend ordering a few at a time so you know how much food you're getting.  Overall, there are far better Italian spots in the city!  I'd go back if someone was really interested, but it will never be a top pick for me!"
"This is the best spot in River North! It's a small plates type place. Which is great because you get to try so many different dishes. Honestly, order anything in the menu and it will be delicious. Can't go wrong at all. The servers are all nice and hardworking. The restaurant gets really busy but it's a great atmosphere. The wine list is superb as well. They also have a full bar. In the warmer months it's great to sit on the patio or sidewalk."
"My buddies and I were in town for a long weekend and we entered this packed place pretty late at night and there were a ton of people still getting big dinners.We ordered a couple of beers and I ordered a pizza, which was amazing. The crust was nice and fluffy and an awesome sauce.  My buddy got the white sauce pizza, which was equally as fantastic.The only thing that made me angry was that there was a bathroom attendant in there. I hate these guys. I can wash my own hands thanks you!Our service was great, super nice guy. We all really loved this place."
"One of my favorite italian eateries in Chicago, small plate tapa style with super affordable wine and great service.  Always a fan of the knife cut sausage, meatballs Napoli and the charcuterie."
The Polenta Fries were my favorite thing we tried.I could eat em all day.The Halibut was also pretty good.
"Good food at great prices, freshly made pizzas and great charcuterie selections in a great environment. Also a nice wine selection that won't put a hole in your pocket."
"Very good restaurant! Enjoyed sitting on the patio while eating and watching the street and people activity. Pizza was solid, calamari and tortellini were awesome!! For dessert, the banana with gelatti item was fabulous! The plates are smaller portions. It is ""tapas"" style italian food. One star off for prices that are a bit high for the portion. But this is a major city where everything is more expensive. Service was very good!"
"Prices were high, but the plates were large. My girlfriend and I had plans to try a few more plates, but we were stuffed after the meat & cheese platter, arugula pizza, and veal meatballs. Overall, food was good. The meat & cheese was uninspiring for being the most expensive item in our ticket ($25). The brick oven style pizza was excellent and made for some great leftovers. My favorite dish was the veal meatballs, which were flavorful and had a good consistency. For desert, we had the hot chocolate cake with vanilla gelato. I wish I had more to say, but my girlfriend enjoyed the lion's share haha.Our waiter was busy but made good time for us. He recommended an excellent digestif (sp?) to sip on after our meal. If I could give half stars, then I would give 3.5, but I aslo would go back so I can try some pasta and house specials."
We went last night and it was awesome. Great Penne Vodka and the portions are perfect for two people to share. Must eat Italian spot in Chicago! Fun atmosphere that looks old school Italian where a mob movie could have been shot. If you like authentic foods then this place is your spot to eat.Great service always adds to a good night as well.
"The ambience at Quartino is one of the most unique in the city. You feel like you will be paying $40-60 just for dinner and might have to wait a while. This is not the case at all. The apps and sides are priced around $6-7 and the mains are $11-15. With everything being shareable, you really get a sense of the whole menu. The caramelized brussel sprouts, bruschetta, osso buco, shrimp risotto, and pizza were the biggest hits at our table. Disappointing was the shrimp entree and the eggplant Parmesan. Just not enough eggplant for the cheese. The service was phenomenal all evening. We received our food within ten minutes, and they promptly refilled our water glasses every time they were empty. Just a great experience and excellent food."
"A group of us celebrated my partner's birthday last night at Quartino's and had a great experience. The host staff was very nice and professional, not flustered at all despite it being a very busy night. Our server was extremely personable and helpful, offering great suggestions and efficient service. We all enjoyed our tapas, especially the shrimp rissoto, calarmari, and osso buco. I wouldn't say it was the most amazing Italian food I've ever had, but overall the quality was better than average.I'd absolutely recommend this place to others - especially for groups or for a date night. The sharable plates made for great conversation and a satisfied stomachs."
"What? How is Quartino not averaging 5 stars? The service, food, and atmosphere are all outstanding, in addition to very reasonable prices for a downtown Chicago Italian restaurant. Will be back once a week forever, if possible."
"Group of 8 with a reservation. There are a lot of tables, but they're very close together, so don't expect a romantic setting. Waiters were friendly, funny, and swift with the food & drinks.They have a gluten-free menu, which was nice for a few in our party. Apple and bread fondue was a good starter. Favorite dishes were the beef short ribs and the skirt steak. Now for the negatives: The chicken was dry and the gluten-free pasta was horrendous. Rock solid noodles and bad flavor on that sauce. Would have been better to use the sauce from the sausage? If you're going to go gluten free, skip the pasta. Also they gave us the wrong dessert and still charged for it.Overall, would go back for the fun items and to try the pizza. Prices seem standard ($12 for the chicken or sausage plates), but are tapas portions without sides, so plan accordingly!"
"This is an authentic Italian-style restaurant with smaller plates meant to be ordered in bulk, that come out when ready (not coursed out). The quality and freshness cannot be denied. You're not going to come away having eaten an over-seasoned, excessively garlicky, ultra salty Italian meal. They let the freshness and the food do the work here. The space is energetic, and the service impeccable--about what you'd expect from the same ownership of Gibsons, Luxbar, and Hugo's. What's more: for the quality of the food and service, I always leave pleasantly surprised--the bill is reasonable, my palate is delighted, and my belly is full!Favorites: Sausage pizza, sausage risotto, shrimp risotto, veal meatballs, pappardelle, spaghetti, dates, spinach salad, short ribs, ravioli, profiteroles, chocolate fondue with strawberries and bananas."
We enjoyed a leisurely weekday lunch here in April.  They have  twenty five dollar lunch special for 2 that comes with 3 courses.  We started with the Goat's milk Ricotta appetizer that comes with this well-toasted bread.  It was wonderful.  The Porcini & Truffle Risotto was our 2nd course and we finished with the shrimp (garlic & EVOO).  Had some south Italian red from Solento to wash it all down.  Finished with some Capucchino and Canoli (shared).  Great food and service.  Loved it and would totally go back.
"My husband and I were thrilled with our choice to eat here. Walking distance from our hotel too; The Godfrey. Our server was wonderful - seeing as how we were clueless and new to this menu & style, she gave great detail of dishes. She also was very honest in telling us we were ordering too much food & recommended we get a half order of certain dishes, she saved us money this way! And we were completely full when we left! We enjoyed the veal meat ball appetizer, caprese salad, braised beef pasta & tortellini with prosciutto, & lemon curd tart & the donuts for dessert. We both had waters. Our bill was $50 - for us small town folks this was a pricier splurge meal, but absolutely worth it. The atmosphere was great too. It's louder, but we could hold conversation just fine. The building inside is gorgeous, we sat upstairs. We would recommend this place! I will say, there's a restaurant just like this place in KC, MO and they offer a happy hour with SEVERAL dishes half price and they're also fabulous. Wish there were more options like that in Chicago."
"My new favorite Chicago restaurant. Came here based on the great Yelp and Zagat reviews, and it was everything I hoped for. No tables available last minute, but managed to snag a spot at the bar. It's cozy, lively, service is super friendly, and best of all, the food (and wine) is amazing. Everything was so fresh, delicious and authentic, and SO reasonably priced, especially considering the high quality.It's a great place to come w/ a group, so you can order a bunch of plates and sample them all. But it's also a great place to come on your own, because you can order half-portions of almost anything on the menu, and they have a great selection of wine by the glass - actually, you can get it by the 1/4 liter (about 1-1/2 glass), 1/2 liter, bottle or full liter.  Tried 1/2 portion of 3 items, and they were all excellent: 1. Arugula salad, w/ orange, house-made ricotta and olive oil - light and lovely. ($3.75)2. Rigatoni w/ Tuscan kale, roasted butternut squash, house-made pancetta & ricotta -  so unique ($5.50); and 3. Bordetto ai frutti di mare - w/ shrimp, clams, calamari, octopus and whitefish, all in an incredible marzano tomato sauce ($7.75)Wine is well-priced, too; for 1/4 liter, you can get a Toscana for just $7, or I got the Montepulciano D'Abruzzo for $14, and it was amazing.But, everything that the folks sitting on either side of me ordered looked fantastic, too - pancetta-wrapped dates, crusted cauliflower, veal meatballs, beef short rib and potato purée, tortellini, gnocchi and ravioli (have to try the ravioli and meatball next time).Afterward, was curious about the house made ""Sardo"" grapefruitcello, so Rob gave me a generous taste, and it was wonderful (grapefruitcello martini looked beautiful, too); thanks, Rob! I'll be back next time I'm in Chicago!"
"I came to Chicago with my family almost 4 years ago.  On that trip, we ate at a restaurant that I have thought about ever since.  Unfortunately, I couldn't remember the name on my recent trip.  When my sister brought up her memories of Quartino, I was stoked and knew we had to go back!  It was just as great as I remember.So, Italian Tapas sounds lame.  I know it does and that is how I felt the first time I came until I ate the food.  What is really great about it is that you get to sample a bit of everything.  We had a bit of wine and quite a few of the dishes and everything was good.  My favorites were the Beef Carpaccio, the Prosciutto Wrapped Dates, and a Cream based Rotini with chicken.  All soooo good!We didn't have to wait and this meal didn't break the bank.  I have no complaints about Quartino and will go back next time I'm in Chicago!"
"Good wine, great food, and wonderful service. That is the equation of a good restaurant. Clearly, Quartino's knows what they are doing. One of my personal local favorites!"
"Quartino is a go-to if you are in the Chicago area. The food is great And the prices are reasonable. I have been here many times over the past 3 years and it has never failed to disappoint. My husband and I usually order drinks, a main dish, vegetables, and an olive/cheese tray. The portions are small, which they are upfront about, so the prices might be a little misleading on the menu e.g. $13 for pork shank. But the best part about this menu is that you can try more dishes for around the same price as ordering two entrees at another restaurant. I like that the portions are small because I usually end up taking home leftover pasta at other restaurants (no left over guilt)!The prices are fair and you leave feeling full. I will suggest a few things about the atmosphere. It can be very loud as it is family style so keep that in mind. Also if you casually drop in on a Friday or Saturday night, you probably will hear ""we don't have a table until 10 pm"". It's best to make a reservation a few days in advance."
Started with the meatballs and the Nero D'Avola. Then the Beef Short Ribs. Everything was fabulous and the service is excellent!
"The polenta fries are amazing! I also had gnocchi and the noodles could not have been better. Very interesting restaurant, very loud and fun!"
"High energy, crowded Friday night.  Perfect for dining solo at the bar where I was very fortunate to get a spot.  Service was solid - friendly and effective.  The different groups of revelers around me were clearly having fun.  Great atmosphere.The veal Osso Buco was sublime and a great great value.  I honestly can't remember having a better rendition of this classic.The veal meatballs topped with homemade ricotta were excellent.The roasted peppers with capers and garlic were very good.The olive mix and the gardeniera mix were meh.Wine selections by the glass were real crowd pleasers.The off menu dessert of Tiramisu was excellent and enough for 2 people easily.  Top notch."
"Obsessed with this restaurant. High quality, lots of variety for really reasonable prices. Great vibe too!I was very lucky when I came here with a friend of mine to have a sampling of a bunch of different menu items. We had:--Sicilian Caponata Eggplant Salad, Olives, & Capers --House Made Goat's Milk Ricotta Fresh Oregano & DOP Val di Mazara Organic E.V.O.O. --Gnocchi Potato Dumplings, Green Beans, Potatoes, Arugula Pesto, & Pork Stock--Tagliatelle alla Bolognese Traditional Meat Sauce--Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo Tuscan Pasta Ribbons with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce--Tortellini Alfredo Sauce, Peas, & Prosciutto--Roasted Baby Octopus Braised Escarole, Red Chili, & E.V.O.O. The pastas are house made and to die for. The roasted octopus was sublime. All dishes were pretty great. We had a food coma of the best kind. All very reasonably priced, I can't stress that enough.This is worth a check out for sure."
"Pretty busy for a Thursday night.Patio seatings.... which is SEPARATE from inside seating which is also the reservations. So if you want a patio seat, it's first come first serve. Italian tapas style- food doesn't come out at the same time so I'd recommend everyone to share their dishes. My friend really liked the duck prosciutto."
"My friend decided to have her bday party here and it was a food-wise decent experience. Since we were a large group, our table got a boatload of dishes to share. We started with the salumeria which maybe I don't appreciate since I haven't developed that fine a palate yet, but the meats and cheeses were just fine. However, I did enjoy the raw artichoke hearts in EVOO with carrots and onion which is something I don't get everyday.Next came the potato gnocchi which was a fine dish. The gnocchi were tender, slightly chewy and the pesto sauce was fragrant. Little bit on the small side though.Had to have a meat dish so we ordered the beef short rib. Compared to other short ribs I've had before, this one just didn't have enough flavor. The sauce was light and the meat was pretty fatty.The star of the show was the calimari which was wonderful, crunchy, and came with a tasty dipping sauce. Fried stuff usually wins!The tortellini in alfredo was also decent. I feel like I could have made something similar to it in taste just by making a trip to the grocery store.Pizza with sausage was meh. The crust was good but the pizza was pretty wet so eating it was a bit difficult with the end just flopping all over the place.Dessert was good, I don't recommend ordering the donuts though since there's nothing crazy about a plain fried donut in chocolate dipping sauce. Someone at our table really wanted it though.Food was decent, but the staff here are awesome and make sure you get everything you need asap. It was a good dining experience though I've had better food elsewhere."
"The service was phenomenal considering how crowded it was. Food was tasty, nothing extraordinary. Sampled a few things from the menu; tortellini was a favorite. When we ordered the donuts for desert people stopped by our table to 'ooh' and 'aah' at the presentation. The tables were all very close together and it seemed to be a never ending influx of people sitting and leaving but all the conversation droned out into a hum and I have to admit the close proximity to the rest added to the charm.The service really sold it for me, personally. Never waited for anything for two long and friendly faces would always stop by to make sure everything was okay!"
The service is excellent and the food is greatI recommend the veal meatballs and the spaghetti with meatballsalso the olive paring is good as wellplease note: the silverware is placed directly on the table (yuck) so ask for a glass of water to clean it!
"This was my second time dining at Quartino, and let me say I have no complaints. I had made reservations about a month in advance for a Friday night and was glad I did, since their dining room was booked all night. We got sat in a semi-private room which was perfect. The different wines we ordered were all really good and everything we ate was delicious. There were three of us, and we ate and drank quite a bit, yet our bill was very reasonable. Quartino is definitely one of my favorite Italian, small plate restaurants. I recommend it to everyone!"
"Went here with my mom for dinner. Got the margarita pizza, penne alla vodka and a bottle of toscana. Cons: house bread..Ehhh. I've had better.Pros: opentable points, service, food! Penne was perfectly al dente. Being indian, we asked for more heat. Still not super spicy but it was flavorful. We added garlic to the margarita pizza (crispy and thin, which we love) and we both thought it was tasty. 2 dishes for us was perfect. The wine was decent (toscana) and we got to take the rest back with us. 2 dishes and bottle of wine plus tax: $46.I'd come back to try more."
"After reading my fellow elite member, Joyce's review, I gave this place a try. I met up with a friend of mine who's from the city and luckily I came before my reservation was cancelled. I was running late. Thanks to the gals in the front for understanding. Anyhow, if you made a reservation and you wanted to sit outside, you might have to wait a little for that because that's a separate waiting list. So we decided to sit inside. So for starters we ordered drinks. Drinks was $10 which is pretty normal for martinis. For dinner we split the bill and I don't know what we  ate but the bill came to about $40 each. We apparently ordered a lot of tapas.1. Dates with bacon - sweet dates and bacon offered a well balanced bite2. Veal Meatballs - overly dry meat, not a fan of this3.  Creamy Polenta - nothing to rave about, just like mac and cheese4. Cavatelli - good as the one from Little Italy Cleveland5. Some stew with shrimp, mussels, scallops, more like a Bouillabaisse - this was very good. I couldn't find in this menu now but it could be what they offered as a seasonal thing.  This place is located in downtown and there are plenty of tables to sit in or out to people watch or grab your friends to go with. The wait service was very attentive and they like to share their food favorites which is very good for the out of townies."
"Wow! One of the best meals we've had in a very long time. We went with another couple and had a wonderful evening. Fantastic wine (love that you can buy it by the 1/4, 1/2, or full litre) and we had a wonderful array of dishes. Loved the Cheese fondue, the bacon dates, and the pizza was a home run too. Our service was great as well. Great place for a small group meal, I think it'd be a little trickier with larger groups."
"Was not expecting this to be an excellent meal but only a good one & was pleasantly surprised.  I was impressed with the execution of all our dishes with the exception of the olive & salami plate which were just not to our liking but more than likely good in their own right for the specific person.  Every dish was fantastic and honestly no complaints as to any part of the dish.  Well done, you should check it out if you're looking for a great experience."
"Very impressed. In town on extended business, this was a good change of pace from all the expensive upscale places around here. Was looking for something more down to earth after two weeks here...found it.Saturday night,, bustling atmosphere, seated myself in the bar area. Food and drinks were quite good, if not better than places around but half the price. Service was fast and friendly and the food came out very fast as well.Guess I just found my local for the next few weeks."
"Not my first choice (or second or third, etc) for pizza or pasta. Nonetheless, it's still a decent spot especially if you can't get a reservation anywhere else in the area. Service is great, and you can usually get a reservation for a big group at the last minute."
"Over the years I've had a love/hate relationship with Quartino. We got off to a rocky start, but either my tastes have changed or they have really upped their game...and I'm in love with them.I stopped in twice this past weekend and I loved their Salumeria Tasting with meats, cheeses, and little salads. The duck prosciutto is delish and loved the fennel and grape salads that come with the tasting. It's a lot of food for $25!Sitting at the bar is probably your best option. The dining room is always so loud and cavernous (and touristy) and the outdoor area is too close to the traffic to be enjoyable, but the bartenders are always friendly and attentive.Try the grapefruit-cello martini. Life changing!"
This was a terrific place. We had a great meal for a large party on the weekend before Christmas. Our party of 10 (including three children) was easily accommodated and the service was top notch. The wine by the large carafe was outstanding and we enjoyed many of the menu items without going too overboard. We were all surprised by how good the deserts were too.We hope to get back soon.
"Quartino is so loud! If I go back, I'm going to heed all the advice and sit outside on the patio. My friends and I couldn't hear each other unless we screamed. Our waiter misheard our orders it was so loud. Pandemonium! Most of the food we got here was really good. Be careful because it's small portions you may find yourself ordering WAY more than you can eat. That's what happened when I went with my girlfriends and we ended up with a lot left over. Service was a bit disappointing. My friend had to ask 4 times for butter, the runner brought us the shrimp risotto when we ordered the mushroom. Sadly I'm allergic to shellfish so we were left waiting about 10 minutes to get someone's attention and then another 15 for the new dish. Eek gads! Once we got the mushroom risotto it was delicious. The gnocchi was to die for.With our sangria (they have white, yay) and food, we ended up spending about $40 each, eek. Honestly, Quartino has some good food but it's not amazing enough to have me come back & not be able to hear anyone I'm with, pay a million dollars for parking and have mediocre service. There are too many amazing places in the city to keep me coming back here."
"I had done my research thoroughly before my friend and I took a trip for the weekend to Chicago, and Quartino was at the top of my list for must try's for a meal based on the menu and reviews.  We went to Quartino on a Friday night at about 9pm.  Everywhere in Chicago was packed, so I wasn't sure how it would go getting seated without reservations.  We were quoted about half an hour, which was much shorter than I anticipated, but were also advised that you could sit anywhere in the bar, first come first serve.  My friend and I got a drink in the bar while we waited, which was a little pricier (Malibu & Pineapple for $10 and glass of wine for $11), but they were very good and it's a nice restaurant so no complaints there.  Even with the crowd, we didn't wait very long, and the restaurant texts you when you're table is ready, which I thought was very cool and convenient if you wanted to leave and come back.  We were seated upstairs so went up a flight of stairs and sat down at our table.  The restaurant has a very fun and loud atmosphere.  Everyone talking boisterously and having a great time.  It is not a place (at least on a busy night) for a quiet intimate meal).  You are seated very close to other tables and it felt a little crowded, but not too terrible.  The service was wonderful and our waiter was absolutely great.  He took the time to explain the menu and help us make decisions that we would like.  I wish I had remembered his name, but he was a blonde male and very attentive throughout the night.  My friend and I were very hungry and excited to try new things so we got a pretty good variety of different plates on the menu.  They give you some warm bread that you dip in some great olive oil/balsamic when you are seated.  We started out with the burrata that is a mozzerella ball that you can tell is fresh and made in house, filled with mozzerella shreads and cream on top of some greens and beets.  I absolutely loved the burrata, but would've rather seen it on top of greens and grape tomatoes with balsamic.  The beets seemed a little strange with mozzerella.  We got caprese, which had the freshest basil we had ever tried.  It was delicious and fragrant.  We then got our sulami plate, which had proscuitto and sopressata.  Both meats were delicious and the perfect serving size for us to share.  We got the filet, which was delicious, though in my opinion quite small for the price.  It was two very small cubes of meat, so a total of about 4 small bites for $13.00.  It was very tender though, and perfectly cooked, though if you don't like your meat rare, you may want to request to have it cooked a higher temp.  For myself, though, I would not want to eat it any different than rare.  It had a wonderful flavor to it.  We got the sauteed spinach with E.V.O.O. & garlic and it was the best spinach we have ever had!  It was fresh and cooked perfectly with a delicious garlicky and aftertaste of lemon flavor.  It was a good portion and honestly I would've been happy if I had just eaten a big plate of spinach for my whole meal.  We couldn't resist dessert, and we ordered the Torta al Cioccolato, which can be described as a fluffy and delicious chocolate cake almost resembling the lava cake, with vanilla gelato on top, and the Zeppole.  The zeppole had an amazing presentation that one can't resist, coming out as hot fried donuts with powdered sugar on top and sides of honey and dark chocolate.  This was probably the only disappointing part of my meal.  They looked amazing, but inside tasted very eggy and wet, and did not seemed cooked on the inside.  I could only eat a part of one and the rest unfortunately, went to waste.  My friend and I left feeling satisfied, but not full.  I think it was the perfect amount to eat without feeling like we had to roll ourselves out of there.  It came to about $90 for the two of us, with several choices of plates and 2 alcoholic beverages included.  I definitely would love to return and try more options!"
"3.5 stars!This place was POPPIN'! We were told by others to expect loud and we got just that.We had a nice server and the pizzas, pastas and meatballs that we all ordered were excellent. Prices for food are very reasonable and drinks will run you your standard big city fare.Star was deducted because we had a reservation but had to wait in an overly crowded bar for 15 minutes, always in the way of someone passing by. Our table was for three and with a tapas place that has pizza on the menu, we didn't have nearly enough space. Felt a bit squished in but perhaps that's the style of the place.I would go back because food is yummy!"
"I came here on two ocassions for dinner with a friend..I didn't make reservations the 2nd time I came here, but was still seated immediately... nice! Food-tapas style, the dishes are on the smaller side per the staff, but I think that one can be satisfied with just one entree...portions aren't huge, but they are extremely small either...I shared 3 dishes with a friend once & we were both overly too stuffed to eat anything more. (you know the feeling where you feel like exploding...yes that feeling..).. so if you want to save some room for dessert... just get 1 entree at a time..Free Bread -the bread is tasty with the olive oil & vinegar...but don't stuff yourself to much on it...cuz then you'll miss the main menu! Linguini with Clams ($11.75) - tasty, but I wouldn't say it was amazing...I've had better..Dessert:Tiramisu (~$7-i think) - it's not on the dessert menu, but if they have it the waiter will inform you.. i thought it was delicious & huge.. enough for 2-4 ppl to share..I may be biased on this though because I love coffee...Atmosphere - if you know me ..my voice isn't extremely loud so being in this restaurant..I felt like I had to yell for my friend to be able to hear me...yes I agree with Sarah S that the restaurant is very LOUD...**there's not much room on the table for a 2 person table.. so if you order a lot of food.. g'luck finding a spot to place the plate...you might have to place it on your lap?..Customer Service: the waiters/waitresses are all very friendly and knowlegeable on the menu & good with providing recommendations.. that's always a plus!Parking - street parking.. valet...I would recommend walking.. the red line isn't too far from here...:)I would come here again just to try different items on their menu..."
"This place was incredible! I came here with my family and we sampled things all over the menu. From the salami appetizers, to pizza, to short rib, to pasta, everything was phenomenal. Everything was made in house and tasted like it was straight from Italy. I will definitely be returning!"
"I went a few times to Quartino and always love the food, and it is always fun to share dishes. The only drawback of the place is that it is very noisy so I wouldn't recommend it for a date."
"Meh... That about sums up my lackluster dining experience at Quartino.  Aside from the Chilled Zucchini small plate (which was delicious!), I was lamentably quite unimpressed by every other dish we ordered.FOOD (+ comment above): Very unauthentic Italian food.  For example, at the end of dinner we ordered assorted Bread Biscotti's to-go and tried them while waiting for the check.--They were really soft, like one of those Keebler 'soft batch choc. chip cookies'-soft.  Bread Biscotti's are supposed to be hard and crunchy, which is what makes them a popular after-dinner treat to dunk in your café.  Needless to say, the ""to-go"" box of Biscotti's my boyfriend & I ordered did not go home with us, it became a ""to-be-left-at-the-table"" box.The pasta here ALMOST nostalgically brought me back to weekly Sunday family dinners, eating the handmade gnocchi & ravioli I used to make with my grandma... Almosttt... But not really. Or even at all, for that matter.  ALTHOUGH, it did make me really miss Grandma's homemade sauce.P.S.WINE:  Wine is served in the same dinky,  ribbed plastic cups that you last drank out of as a kid in your sleepaway summer camp's dining hall...  We just ordered a bottle of Chianti & this is seriously what you're giving me to drink it from??  I totally get that they're going for the laid-back, famiglia atmosphere; however, there's gotta be a better compromise for a casual way of serving red wine, while still rendering the highest quality product... because the short, narrow mess-hall cups ain't cuttin' it in the Aerating category.  Not to mention--What does this say about Quartino's perception of its own wine menu?!?  Unfortunately, before even taking the first sip, I already had a subconscious bias opinion of the wine, which was: ""cheap.""  Esp. b/c I've been served boxed wine at football games in cups more conducive for serving wine.Over $150 (for 2) later...In short: Way too Americanized Italian restaurant.  Epitome of what you picture a ""tourist trap"" to be.  Shocked by all the + reviews on here by Chi locals, no offense!So, so sorry Quartino for the very critical write-up--you're my 1st, & only, negative Yelp review :(  But I felt the need to write this bluntly honest review to set the record straight for all you out there who, like me, are being severely misled by all these deceptive 5-star reviews!!"
"Quartino's is my standard go to for a fun italian experience in the city. IT is always loud and busy, which makes for a fun entertaining time. The food is great, but the affordable wine selection is really what makes us keep going back. The hubby is a vegetarian, so plenty of options for him as well!! Some of our favorites are the dates, mushroom risotto, all the pizzas are amazing, and the tiramisu. Also, it's one of the few places DT you don't have to wait forever for a table. I honesty prefer this place to RM italian."
"Very nice staff and nice decor. The food was hit or miss. Fondue was luke warm and tasted like nacho cheese, but brussel sprouts and shrimp were good. Ravioli was ok. Convenient location though."
"Great food: High Quality and TasteSelection: Vegan, Vegetarian, CarnivoreAmbiance: Very noisy at the bar and hard to converse with groups. Recommend open table in advance for a more intimate experience on the other side of bar as this place is quite popular.Great for singles."
"Place is nice, service is good however portions are small. At least the house salad and eggplant parm are small. Also,  I personally prefer a lot of sauce relative to cheese on my eggplant and this place does the reverse."
"We've been to Quartino dozens of times and the food has always been amazing (shout out to the short rib). And while this review won't make or break your decision to come here, let me add to the chorus of great reviews and tell you a quick story. We made a reservation for 15 people for our birthdays (my wife and I are two days apart -- Peter you are the man thank you!!) and when we came in, we found out that the Brussels sprouts are not in season and not on the menu. I asked our waiter if it would be at all possible to have them, you know, maybe you have in the fridge, etc. he got the manager, Alysia, who came over and said she would get us some. And she did. By WALKING OVER TO TRADER JOES AND BUYING TWO BAGS which they then proceeded to cook and serve us. And it was excellent. And that is why we will continue to come back here. We love Quartino. Forever."
"One of the best places I've had a meal EVER! From the atmosphere to the melt in your mouth homemade pasta to the wait staff that treated us like we were sitting in their kitchen the whole night was above and beyond our expectations. It was explained to us how to work with the small plates; how many to order, what to order and that half plates could be ordered at half price (which I thought was extremely fair). One of the managers stayed at our table so long that I almost asked her to sit but this was a good thing! The manager seemed to be truly genuine and sincere and she was spending time getting to know us, using our names, asking for feedback and making recommendations! We felt like the chef was working for us! If we wanted something a little different from what we saw on the menu  there was no problem. We felt like we were the only people in the place and yet it was packed from wall to wall. An amazing experience beyond some of the best Italian food in Chicago. I'll be back. I even used the postcard to send to my parents to tell them that I had found my new favorite restaurant in Chicago and if they were ever in the Windy City they needed to make their way here!"
"Great food. Enjoyed the Napoli (sweet with golden raisins) and Polpette (marina sauce) meatballs. Salumeria tasting and pink bubble....wow! Rob, located in the bar, is informative and can give you tips on what delicious treat will engage your palate."
"Quartino is a fun place to go for dinner. I loved the ambience, and Italian small plates is a great idea. The service is absolutely above average. Every member of the staff is super attentive and kind. As for the food: the calamari was the best I've had in a long while, the beef carpaccio was amazing, and the braised pork ravioli was melt in your mouth delicious! however, the eggplant parm was very bland and disappointing. Everything else, including the sangria, was perfect though! Four plates among two people was not too much, and maybe not enough! There is definitely more to try!"
Went here for the Chef Week lunch and got the truffle risotto as well as the duck pizza. The food was good (although a bit on the salty side) and surprisingly inexpensive ($22 for two people). The customer service was incredible from the beginning to the end. Our waiter was Lanny and he was exceptional!
"My coworkers and I were in Chicago for an event and had asked a friend of mine for some options for dinner on our first night. He came back with a list that included Quartino and we were extremely happy with his recommendation.The atmosphere, while a little loud by the end of the night, was fun and entertaining. We sat upstairs and enjoyed the decor and location and our service was spectacular.The food was amazing. We enjoyed 6 - 8 different dishes that we shared between the five of us - including a salumeria tasting (the duck prosciutto and roasted peppers were a hit), pizza (the Paparazzi was delicious - as well as their pepperoni and sausage), calamari, veal osso buco, egg plant parmesan and of course, dessert was decadent (you have to try the Coppa al Banana - it was perfection).I would highly recommend Quartino to anyone visiting Chicago."
"Our selections were all good - calamari was fresh, braised ribs were tender, the pasta bolognese was delicious. The portions were good for five to share.  The dessert fondue was yummy and if we had room we would have ordered more fruits to dip!  Service was quick and friendly.  Glad we found this gem!"
"Quartino is like that one friend everyone has that is loud and obnoxious and you kind of dread hanging out with them...but then you do and you have a great time and resolve to hang out more often.The food is solid...not amazing, but consistently good. The wine is inexpensive and easy to share since you can get a 1/4L, 1/2 L or a full bottle of almost all their wines. The atmosphere is loud, crowded, and chaotic, but if you come with a group, make reservations, and embrace the experience, you're almost guaranteed to have a satisfying evening!"
"I usually hate tapas style because I'm a big girl and usually tapas style doesn't fill me up. But quartino's portions are pretty big. Hands down the best fettuccine Alfredo I've ever had! And I've had a lot of fettuccine in my life. The calamari was the bomb too. Braised beef ribs melted in my mouth. The zeppole (Italian ""donuts"") were soooo good with honey. FYI you're supposed to tip when you use the bathroom..."
"Prosciutto San Daniele - ( Italian ham , sweet and velvety, aged at least 20 months)Here is little background of Prosciutto di San Daniele. It came from Italian pigs, it matured with sea salt and environment condition based of temperature/humidity/ventilation, dries the fresh meat, transforms it into prosciutto. The minimum maturation period is 13 months. This dish from Quartino is delish . The flavor is intense and the meat is not too dry."
"We're out-of-towners and went to Quartino after an evening of shopping - it is very convenient to the magnificent mile and many hotels nearby. I called around six in the evening before shopping and they got us in at 9. I imagine they're pretty good with last-minute reservations, considering the place was quite large! It was noisy, but the tables are so small that it is pretty easy to hear your companions. I really liked the atmosphere - bustling, but cozy. The service was fantastic. Friendly and fast. The food tasted fresh and was flavorful. I'm loving this tapas trend, and this place pulls it off well. Everything is designed to share, and it comes to your table as soon as it's ready, so I felt like we were munching on something the whole time. The house-made goat milk ricotta was deliciously creamy and came with perfectly toasted bread. The manzo pizza had such a tasty, unique flavor! I highly recommend this one. We also got the ravioli, but I wasn't very impressed. The pasta itself tasted very fresh, but I wasn't a fan of the flavor. We didn't have any mixed drinks, but we shared a half bottle of wine (for two people) which was inexpensive and tasty. The wine list is very large and they offer it by the glass, half-bottle or full bottle."
"It was good experience,  excellent service and the food good for sharingI liked the tomato soup Farmhouse chicken very good Vegi pasta not that good"
"A bit loud, but great food. I liked host they would bring out the plates as they were ready. That way the food was guaranteed to be hot and we could appreciate each plate."
I don't know why I only gave 4 stars last time. I've been here several times since and the food and service just seem to get better. Love this place.
"The best service and the food, also, its my favorite place ive ever found when i was walking in downtown i got there, to quartino its has a good ambience and service very friendly the servers and really good the food and everything the food is so tasty, id like to take classes with the chef, because he is really good on. Love quartino"
"This is a great place where you can have a large sit down meal, get reservations an hour earlier, and not over spend. The vodka sauce is so yummy. I highly recommend it for larger parties! Love the architecture. The bathroom is a must-see."
"Family-style Italian food with a great atmosphere. We had a group of 9 and everyone enjoyed everything on the table. My favorite was the brussel sprouts, and the dates were gone in a flash. Also very reasonably-priced for the portions, food and service. I would definitely go back."
Love this place!!! The food is fantastic. We've eaten multiple items from all sections of the menu and haven't had any complaints. I love the concept of Italian tapas. It allows you to get pasta and pizza and not be stuffed out of mind. It's a great place for groups or a fun lively date.
"Quartino's makes me sad. It looks so fun when I walk by during the day or evening but when I actually eat there it does not deliver. I came for dinner last week with a friend and ordered my favorite dish (pizza!) and a kale salad. I was disappointed.   I suspect the 4 basil leaves that garnished the marg pizza that I ordered was the only seasoning. Barely any sauce, stingy on the cheese, and flavorless dry crust.  I have had neapolitan style pizza elsewhere that is amazing, soft, cheesy, and wonderful. Alas that is not here. My salad was so salty I could barely eat it and I love salty foods. The italian bread they bring you as a starter is SOO bland it's like why bother? Finally, the house pinot was horrid I sent it back, and my friend's malbec was also not too good either. With so many wonderful Italian restaurants in Chicago, I will never be back here."
"I've been there twice. One time alone, one time with another 6 or 7 guys (it turns out that the place is not very good for a large group, though). The food was awesome, so was the service."
"As a first time visitor to Chicago, this was our first meal in the city. It's close to Hotel Felix, about a 5 minute walk! We got the fettuccine Alfredo, and the margarita pizza after a starter of bread and olive oil. They were both fresh, well made, and tasted great. The menu is very diverse with many different options including soups, salads, pizza, pasta, and other Italian dishes. The environment was almost the best part. It's in an old building and the inside looks vintage and clean. Definitely recommend if you are looking for reasonably priced great food."
"This places is always packed and a little cramped and it is for a reason. The food is great! An Italian restaurant with plates served family style. They bring the plates out when they are done, so food is always showing up. Going here with a party of six was a pretty good number of people. We all ordered something different and everyone had a little bit of everything. I recommend getting a vegetable pizza. The peppers were roasted before put on the pizza and it was delicious! Overall this is very nice place and pretty reasonably priced. But you do have to get a reservation far in advance. Check it out if your in Chicago!"
"Quartino is my go-to place to bring friends from out of town.Delicious, reasonably priced food in a fun setting in a good location. I love tapas and this Italian spin is a great variation.My two favorite dishes:1) Calamari. The calamari is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside served with a delicious marinara. You can tell that it's hand-breaded and the pieces of calamari are cut larger than normal which I think is great for texture.2) Braised short rib with salsa verde. This is the ultimate comfort food - tender, succulent beef swimming in a rich hearty sauce. The salsa verde (mixture of chopped Italian herbs) is the perfect complement to cut the richness of this dish.Other things to try that are pretty good: Broccolini, donuts with chocolate and caramel, pappardelle with ragu, sangria.Things that are good but not great: Shrimp with lemon, pizza.The restaurant is a tad bit loud but the patio is great in the summertime."
"I really love this place! The tapas style ordering is great. Their wine selection is also really good! This is a great place to bring friends that come to the city and want good eats and drinks. The service is also really good too! I even gave our server my number...unfortunately I didn't get a call, but oh well I still love this place!"
"Its a decent place not outstanding as others said in the reviews. Service was excellent we had reservation and our table was ready. Staff took time to explain menu and what's popular item on the menu. Food was okay nothing I can not find at any other place in Chicago. I've had much better lemon chicken elsewhere but waiter was nice enough to switch that entree for something different. I mean that chicken had no flavor at all. Atmosphere was not what I expected. It was noisy, tables were extremely cramped and placed so close to each other. Will try again once see if things are different next time. Thanks"
"This place was amazing.the food took a while to cook but it was wonderful.but when Iwas finished eating the food though I felt like a blimp , then I wanted to go to sleep. The fondue tasted like it came from heaven and so did the pizza.One of the best times ever.Tony Ramos."
"Awesome place for a Saturday night. Highly recommend sitting at the bar with William the bartender. He put together a great Salumeria tasting for us and provided great service all night. The portions on pasta, apps and even desserts can be done in 1/2 orders. Loved that! We were able to try several great dishes. A must do when visiting Chicago!"
"We needed a place to host a pre-wedding family dinner that was central to where our out-of-town family was staying and which served a cuisine that everyone could enjoy. That pretty much limited us to Italian food and since my wife had been to Quartino with friends before, we made our reservation.The good: They were accommodating regarding a serious nut allergy concern we had with one of our guests. That's always a good thing to find. Also, the food there is excellent and the prices are reasonable, a rare combination in that touristy part of town.The bad: First, there is apparently no quiet (or at least calm) space anywhere in the restaurant. We could barely hear each other talking, which wasn't great for a first meeting between families. We should have researched this better, for sure, but even if we were just there ourselves or with a couple friends, it would have been near impossible to have any kind of conversation. I understand having a party atmosphere in a restaurant, but I'd hope for something a little less roaring than a suburban-strip-mall-wings-and-sports-TV-joint level of noise.Second, the tables were a bit small and more than a bit crowded together. I had to get up several times during our meal so that wait staff and other customers could get to the tables next to us. There was barely room on our table for the dishes and I felt like I was sitting (when I got to sit) with my face in the elevated pans most of the night. I'm not certain that I will frequent Quartino too often again, if at all, unless I could order take-out. If I wanted to eat somewhere that loud and cramped where I had to stand every time someone needed the restroom, I'd get lunch on a United flight, since at least afterward I'd be somewhere else. I don't need that experience in a restaurant of Quartino's caliber. This is a shame, because the food there is indeed quite good. However, there's no dearth of good food in Chicago, and so the dining experience counts."
"Very nice manager- changed our table with no fuss.Checked on us, make sure we were satisfied.I left my phone at the table, and the manager actually came down the street to find me!"
"A bit on the pricey and noisy side, but Quartino does have it where it counts: the food.The risotto was probably my favorite item of the night. Not too rich, but plenty of flavor. And the braised short ribs were no slouch either. Perfect amount of food to share over conversation. Now if only they could do something about the noise..."
"Awesome Fettuccini Alfredo (asked for shrimp) , freshly cooked noodles and the Alfredo sauce was amazing! Place was packed! Reservations recommended! Will define back!!! Yum!"
The patio is incredible even if it's a little cramped. I could sit out here and nibble on the cheese plate all day.
"Quartino is great for 2 things: large parties and gluten free eaters. It has good house wine that can be shared for large parties at a reasonable price. Its food is also all meant to be shared. I went there last night with a party of 12 and with drinks and plenty of food it was just over $30/person!For gluten free eaters, they have gluten free pasta, but also plenty of carb-light options like salads, fish, and meat.  I liked the kale Tuscan salad, short rib, and shrimp. Many people liked the risotto but I found it to be too creamy."
Food quality super fresh but portions are small (as they noted all meant for sharing - small plates style)...which means it ended up being a pricier lunch than we expected...but the experience was worth it.Our server was attentive and informative of the menu. Hosts were friendly.  Ordered the following:Duck ProsciuttoMushroom pizzaShaved vegetablesGrilled SalmonMushroom RisottoGrilled SteakBaked EggplantPesto Gnocchi
"Best Italian in Chicago hands down. Love the decor, menu and service. I even like the bathrooms! Lol"
Amazing food! Last minute lunch spot for the wifey and I on our mini vacation. Can't go wrong here!!
this place is always packed especially on the weekend. I came and actually saw party of 20! Make sure you call and reserve first.The place is actually quite big.2 floors with family friendly environment. I guess a lot of people are coming because the price relatively cheap.make sure you order the Pappardelle with beef. everything is supposed to be shared in this restaurant so portion comes in small size.The only thing I hate is the long line and the overcrowded entrance.
"As we hungrily wandered around Chicago, my brother and I finally decided that we wanted something Italian for dinner. We pulled out our phones, checked the Yelp app, and decided to go to Quartino. Although it was getting late by Chicago standards and it was a weeknight, there were still a ton of people at Quartino. Luckily for us, we were still quickly seated. Our server was friendly and did a good job explaining the different types of cheeses to us.We decided to order the Taleggio Cheese with Apricot Puree, Wild Arugula Salad, and Gnocchi. I enjoyed the cheese and my brother liked the apricot puree. The arugula salad was delicious and my favorite part of the meal. It was flavorful and fresh, and I loved the liberal use of oranges and hazelnuts. My brother loved the gnocchi. I'm usually a big pesto eater, but I didn't love the pasta. The gnocchi was soft and well-filled and I think most people would have liked it, I just tend to prefer something chewier and with a bit more texture that I can gnash my teeth into. After eating our fill, we decide to peruse the dessert menu just to see what they are. Our eyes ended up being bigger than our stomachs and we ordered the Profiteroles, which were delicious! I loved the gelato and the toasted almonds flavor. The dessert was so richly decadent and afterwards, I was torn between wanting to pass out from a food coma and jumping around from a sugar high. The service was wonderful and all in all, we had a ton of fun getting Italian tapas."
"My friends, family and I have often called Quartino our home, or a 3rd place at the very least. If Quartino served breakfast, we would be there at dawn to enjoy even more of it. The staff at Quartino is what sets it apart. The service is exceptionally great! From friendly hosts and awesome servers, through bus persons and bar tenders all the way through managers, this restaurant is one of the friendliest restaurants around that serves delicious home made authentic Italian food and plays a great selection of old italian black and white classic movies. The food is excellent and everything can be ordered in half orders. It is meant to share, like tapas. Most things are made in house, including the most delicious home made Tiramisu! Beyond a very exciting menu and many awesome culinary treats, Quartino has house made chelos, and make some of the most delicious cocktails with them.My favorite: Grapefruit chelo martini! Delicioso!"
"Great spot for lunch and tasting different delicious Italian cuisine Food- Started off the chicken noodle soup which was obviously fresh and homemade.  We then tried the bacon wrapped dates which I can't judge since I DESPISE bacon wrapped dates (blah).  We then had the pizza which was pretty good; it had great crust but the sauce wasn't that great.  For the main course I had the bolognese which was DEEEEELICIOUS!  Pasta was cooked a perfect al dente, sauce had the perfect balance of hearty meat and vegetables.  Also tried the fettuccine Alfredo which was good but a little too rich ( as Alfredo usually is) for my taste. Another main course dish I had was the beef short rib.  It was cooked and seasoned well and had some type of pesto sauce draped over the top that was excellent.  The beginning of the meal had plenty of bread, and lots of olive oil/Parmesan mix, and balsamic and crushed red.  Service- Waiter was exceptionally informative and recommended the blood orange Italian soda (yum) and the beef short rib (yum yum)"
The best and classical Italian like being in Rome and Milano.  I would come back to have it again.   Highly recommend Marinara spaghetti and Brodetto Al Di Mare.
"Cute, casual and comfortable, Quartino was a great spot for a quick Friday night dinner.Our table of 4 arrived around 9:30pm and the restaurant was very busy. Servers all working very hard to get food & drinks out to the Tables. We ordered 2 half litre carafes, the beet salad, asparagus risotto, vegetarian pizza, and stracchi pasta. Most dishes were around $10 and tasted good. Our waitress was friendly and fantastic, making sure our special requests were made.Atmosphere is quite loud so not the best place to have a conversation but reasonable prices and tasty food would make me want to come back for more!"
"Came here for dinner with my coworkers during our visit to Chicago. The restaurant was packed on a Friday night and we were lucky we got a reservation. We ordered a few tapas to share amongst the 4 of us. --Eggplant Parmigiana Baked ($7.75)--DELICIOUS! Baked eggplant parmesan layers with tomato sauce topped with melted mozzarella cheese. Just wish they gave us a little more! Extremely flavorful and the cheese stretched across the table!--Mushroom Risotto ($11.50)--Personally I'm not a fan of risotto. This risotto was nothing special.. it was bland, mushy, and a bit heavy. All of us salted each bite!--Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare ($15)--A hearty seafood soup containing shrimp, clams, octopus, calamari, and white fish. It was a very fishy tomato based soup - which I personally love! The garlic bread went perfectly with all the hearty seafood! --Quattro Stagioni Pizza ($12)--The pizza are fairly big - 8 slices! The Quattro pizza was a thin pizza topped with artichokes, roasted peppers, grilled zucchini, and portobello mushrooms. Delicious!!!We had a great night! The food was delicious and the service was excellent! A great place to share tapas with a group! Will definitely come back next time I'm in Chicago!"
"Excellent wood fire pizzas! They have an awesome wine menu also, and it's wonderful to sit outside and linger over a bottle and people watch at an outdoor table in the summer. This place gets crowded, so if you'd like to sit in the main dining room, reservations are recommended, if not snag a seat in the bar area!"
"3.5 starsI had lunch reservation at 7pm for 8 people and we were quickly seated. We decided to eat family style so we could try as many dishes as possible. We ordered 7 different dishes.Rustica Pizza - my favorite dish of the restaurant, just tasted rightSoprano Pizza - tasted a bit odd with the chili peppersDuck Prosciutto Pizza - couldn't taste the duck at all, just tasted like a cheese pizza with arugula. definitely not worth the price.Tortellini - this was decent but there wasn't enough of itFettucini - over cooked and not enough sauceCheese Fondue - this was okay. the cheese wasn't that tasty. Duck Prosciutto - pretty good, but a bit too oily.Also ordered a bellini, which was super fruity and couldn't taste the alcohol at all. I feel like the quality of the meal definitely slipped since it was on July 4th and there were way too many orders going into the kitchen. For most of the night, it sounded like the dishes were coming out 20 minutes later than usual."
"This is such a great place to have a nice, light Italian dinner. Their butternut squash rigatoni is excellent. Like other Yelpers said, Quartino is a safe option for taking family and friends out for some Italian fare. The restaurant is pretty big and can probably accommodate large groups. Their portions are good for sharing, but also perfect as single meals as well (assuming you're not a fan of wasteful gargantuan portions like I am).The one criticism I have is they could work on concocting a more flavorful sangria. I ordered a glass of their white wine sangria and thought it was very bland. Did not try the red wine version, so I can't comment on that one."
"I have been wanting to try Quartino's for quite some time. What the heck was I waiting for?! - I don't know.I was finally able to venture in for a late lunch with my sister.  We sat in the bar area, because frankly, that's our favorite place to sit at any restaurant.  The bartender was overwhelmed, and that was apparent right away.  Poor girl had the bar and a ton of tables to attend to, and she did a great job!She came over quickly, got us some tasty wine and we started ordering away.  I think I ate my weight in food that day.  Oh the holidays, not friendly to my waistline. We started with a platter of meats, cheeses, olives, etc.  It was of course, delicious.Next we moved onto the Gnocchi - which I am still craving, and some meatballs. We spent a couple hours here, munching, and tasting wine. It was a glorious holiday afternoon with my pretty little sis.I would love to come back and try more - maybe sit in the dining room and have a looksy."
"Food was for the most part good, service was great. Ordered the calamari - which I wouldn't recommend because it didn't taste too good, a light root salad that didn't have too much flavor, but I still liked it, and a absolutely delicious tortellini! I think their pastas are likely their specialty. If I went back I would probably only order a pasta dish. We also were warned before ordering that the dishes are very small and are meant to be shared in a table and not be a meal, however the serving sizes were enough to easily be a meal for a person if needed, as well as plenty to share if using as a tapas."
Hadn't intended on dining here but ended up here on a Saturday around 530pm after quickly browsing the menu items on Yelp! We didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was sold out for the night but we were seated on the condition as long as we could have the table free by 7 they would happily seat us. (NO PROBLEM!!) Skipped the cocktails and went straight to the tapas. The veal meatballs were off the chain and we couldn't have been happier with our choice to indulge. Only downsides were that our table was a bit shaky (problem was quickly resolved) and we had to ask twice for EVOO. Prices were surprisingly modest and I look forward to my next dining experience whether it be me and my boyfriend or a larger group of friends/family.
"This is, for my money, the best Italian restaurant in the city.  From the moment you step in the door, Quartino is an authentic, fantastic dinning experience.  From the Italian newspapers on the wall to the large dining room, this place feels like Sunday Dinner.The food doesn't disappoint and the house red is very good.  Anything on the menu will please and you can even go off if you want, (my favorite off menu trek is gnocchi bolognese).  The servings, like the main dining room, are family style and for 2 people 3-4 items is more than enough.There is also a nice, smaller dining room off to the side that looks onto State St.  I celebrated my first dating anniversary with my now fiancé here and it was a wonderful, romantic experience.  As a side note, I had flowers delivered to the restaurant ahead of time and they were in the vase on the table waiting for us.  I got the flowers from an online service that sends the accompanying message on a computer generated card; the staff had transcribed it into beautiful script by hand.You really can't go wrong here, be it by taste or price.  I would just recommend making any weekend reservations well in advance as the secret on this place is out and it books up quick.If you're in a pinch you can settle for RPM but if you can plan ahead a bit and want amazing food and drink, this is where you need to be."
"Had a wonderful afternoon early dinner at Quartino. I love tapas style eating because I love sharing and trying as many new things as possible. Overall, we had an extremely enjoyable experience. The only two not amazing parts is that our server was not always around (not terrible, but not super attentive), they sat us very close to a louder table even though there were a lot of seats in the house, and that the washrooms are located only in the upstairs of the building- or at least that is where we were directed. The restaurant itself is very large- huge space upstairs, and several different spaces on the main floor. We ate numerous delicious items- caprese salad, mushroom risotto, cavatapi, and a shrimp dish. We also had the hot chocolate cake and a lemon dessert- they were my favorites of all of the dishes. Meal was reasonable priced, served quickly, and was very good."
"Loved it! Small portions to share, but so many delicious dishes! Yes it is very noisy, and I would recommend reservations for dinner because it gets packed. Food and service great!"
"Superior to Via Stato but not by much.Good price points for quality and location.Salads were fabulous as was the Cavatelli pasta. Pizza crust was thicker on edges than across the street but crispy.  Excellent bite and structure.Pizza sauce was bland.  Had to add salt. That's a no no.Otherwise, pretty solid..enjoyable lunch.  Attentive service. Bacon wrapped dates, a tapas staple, which doesn't belong here to begin with, wasn't good."
"Quartino's makes its own salumi - cured meats. From duck prosciutto to pancetta, soppressata, coppa and more, these handmade-in-house meats are all worth trying. With your order you get unlimited loaves of deliciously light and toothsome Italian bread and can order from a selection of different pickled vegetables (roasted beet salad, hand-charred peppers, giardinieria romana). Do NOT fail to try the zeppole - fried Italian donut dough drizzled with organic honey. NUM.Very friendly and efficient service. Warm wood tables and tiled pillars with mirrors create a comfortable ambiance. Eat well from a selection of dishes made from hundred-year-old family recipes."
Food is great and the carafe of wine is even better.The only draw back was the polenta fries that we got was on the warm side. They were replaced once we let the waiter know.
"Quartino was my first taste of Italian food in Chicago and it did not disappoint. It was a beautiful night so we opted to wait the 20 minutes for a table outside rather than being sat immediately inside. So we went to the bar for a quick cocktail while we were waiting on our table to be ready. I have to say that the limoncello martini is definitely worth a try, but be warned it has a little heat behind it!Now after we got sat at our table, our waiter came immediately and was very helpful when we asked him about some of the customer favorites as well as his personal favorite dishes. We ended up ordering the veal meatballs, olives, pappardelle, and veal osso buco. I think my favorite dish of the night had to be the veal meatballs. They were so tender and flavorful and the tomato sauce was very flavorful! The pappardelle was pretty good (and a little secret the meat in this pappardelle is the same meat as the beef short ribs entree so if you want to try a different meat dish and still try the spare ribs this is a good option). The flavor was ok, but it was in need of a little salt to add some more depth. The veal osso buco was also very good, but it had a starkly different flavor from the rest of our dishes so it was a little off-putting at first. However, as I continued to eat the dish, the flavors of the veal took over and I ended up really liking the dish.All in all, I had a great experience here and would definitely recommend this restaurant."
"I loooooovvvveeeed this place!  I dined here while I was in town for a bachelorette party.  The atmosphere is really loud and fun.  Our server was friendly and was very good at managing our table of 12.  We never waited long for drinks and our food came out in a timely manner.  I liked that it was tapas and I was able to try a little bit of everything.  I thought the prices were very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food.  All of the pasta seemed to be made in house.  Some of the highlights were the tagliatelle, the braised beef short ribs, the pizzas, and the ravioli.  Next time I'm in Chicago, I will definitely be dining at Quartino again."
"Sorry, had high expectations judging from the reviews but perhaps our concierge recommended a different place for good reason. Parents are well travelled and I've been to New York but this place can't even compare to our Vancouver BC quality for pizza. In my 30odd years of pizza eating never had I left a restaurant with unfinished pizza. Well my parents did the same tonight. The homemade fettuccine was just as poor. Pizza crust was the chewiest I've ever had, tomatoe sauce tasted raw and uncooked, cheese was so thin and flavourless, basil leaves (on the margarita) was also raw! A frozen pizza would have fared better. Homemade fettuccine had a rough and very chewy texture. It was also unusually thick- so much so I thought we ordered bad handmade Chinese noodles. They don't even have draft beer, maybe just good ambiance.Oh and the washroom design was unique- so I liked that. Was at Pizano's two nights ago- Very good deep dish and homemade pasta- though they're known for their thin crust I believe.   orPortillos hot dogs is just 2 blocks away and yes they're awesome. See my reviews for these two venues.Quartino:Food: 1/5Service: 3/5 Ambiance: 4/5Food most important overall: 2/5"
"We hosted a private party at Quartino's Memorial Day weekend.  We lived in Chicago for over a decade, but moved out west to San Francisco four years ago.  We were in town for a friend's wedding and wanted to introduce our 9 month old baby girl to our friends.  We had such a large party, the restaurant suggested their Naples room and provided a wonderful menu option to make it easy.  The price for family style dining and choices were fantastic.  It included their famous polenta fries!  And, they had 2 servers that were dedicated to our room. Those two gentlemen could not have been more amazing.  They even brought some pizza and simple pasta items for some of the kids in our party who weren't interested in the fancier items on our special menu.  And there was no extra charge.  I highly recommend reserving this room and going with Quartino's if you have a small party of 20-40 people.  From booking the event to paying the bill, the experience was really a treat.  We fondly remembered our time in Chicago enjoying Quartino's and the city."
"This place makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The charm in the decor is fun and authentic, the atmosphere is always lively without being obnoxious, and the food is delicious, and the wine, well, it is truly cheaper than water. My husband and I walked in this place one Saturday night and sat in the open-seating bar area. We had no idea what to expect, so when we realized it was Italian tapas style, we were more than excited. Then, when we gazed over the extensive cocktail and wine list, our jaws hit the floor with the more than reasonable prices for booze! It was love at first sight. We've been back a countless number of times. What I'd recommend: Polenta FriesCheese and Meat BoardsSkirt SteakShrimp (lemon, olive oil, chili flakes, oh my gosh...) Caprese SaladGnocchi Zeppole (the most heavenly Italian donuts you will ever eat) I suggest making a reservation for dinner because there is always a wait for the dining room, if you aren't lucky enough to snag a seat in the bar. Also, bring a few bucks because there is a bathroom attendant in the ladies' washroom. Go and be dazzled!"
"While in town this week, I ate here two nights in a row.  They have a large bar with open seating, Italian tapas menu, and a large selection of wines by the glass. I asked the bartender about portion sizes and he explained most of the items could be ordered as a half portion so even a lone diner can enjoy a three course meal without breaking their business travel per-diem limit.  First night, I ordered from salumi the duck prosciutto, fontina cheese, and grilled baby octopus.  The octopus had some chili tossed in so it had a little bit of a kick but great flavor.  On the second night, I went for the gnocchi with arugula pesto, which was a home run.  From what I saw, I don't think you could go wrong with anything on this menu and the staff is definitely well informed of all the dishes.  I will definitely be coming back very soon to try the pork shank."
"Popped in late one evening without any real plan.  There were only a few patrons at the tables, but the bar was probably 80% full.  Ordered a martini and few menu items.  Started with the braised baby octopus and sadly found it way too chewy.  Couldn't finish it.  Next I ordered the veal meatballs.  They seemed to have been sitting around for a while and were merely tepid in temperature.  Although I did finish them, I prefer my food to be out-of-the-oven hot (as I'm sure most do).  The bartender asked how I enjoyed each item, and I was honest with him.  After my meatballs the manager came over to inquire of my meal (the bartender must've told him of my reactions), and he told me he appreciated the feedback, as that's how a kitchen gets better.  I concur.Next I ordered the duck prosciutto pizza.  This was really tasty, and I would order it again.  Took home what I didn't finish.Four stars because while I did not enjoy my first two items, I also wasn't charged for them.  We all know this is what SHOULD happen but oftentimes does not (unless we pitch a fit).  I was appreciative of the restaurant's willingness to appease me, and that kind of service goes a long way in my book."
"Meh. I understand meh is not a word, but the sound you make when you say it is exactly how I felt about my dinner at quartino. I went with a group of friends on a busy night.  We were seated before our reservation  time so the night started out great. We started with the board of lots of appetizers, which I loved.  They even gave the me gf crackers!  What what. Then it slowly went down hill. Look, I'm an upper twenties girl and all about a good time. But I couldn't hear a thing in this place.  My ears were ringing for the noise and I couldn't even chat with my peeps without yelling. Then the food came out and everything  was very bland. I had to add balsamic and parm to everything that came out. Overall it was an okay meal, but I wouldn't go back."
"I've been to Quartino about 5 times now. Each encounter the food has been fresh (hoooot!) out the kitchen and tasty. Ran into Mila Kunis there... literally... ran, into, her! We were leaving, it was crowded and she bumped right into my chest (I mean, my heart), her hair was covering her face (I assume to not draw attention to her) but when she looked up, we locked eyes, we locked hearts, I fell in love and she just smiled and apologized then went on her way as our crew went star crazed. Her and her friends soon left as it drew quite a crowd around their table, as everyone was trying to get a picture. I love you Mila!Anyhow, I wouldn't recommend going with a large group unless they seat you at a the non-circular tables. I say that bc once we went w/ a party of 10 and they tried to squeeze us all into a circular table in the corner (keep in mind, there were maybe 2-4 tables seated in the ENTIRE restaurant); the chairs wouldn't even fit around the table, not to mention 10 grown adults at a small plates restaurant with waters and wine on the table. We told them to change it and they did.Only once did I go w/ a group and it was pleasant (not feeling crowded) - we were sat at tables pulled together, not the circular ones. All other times, I felt over-crowded and it was like playing table Jenga (i'm only about 150 lbs too). Aside from seating, the ambiance is upbeat, it's louder than most and a fun environment. Food is always tasty - I love the small plates, so I can try a variety of the menu items and they come out as they're cooked, so they're always fresh and piping hot. You can throttle the food based on how you feel as well (add more or less)."
"I went with my dad, sister and her 2 kids. This was an amazing meal!!! Dates for appetizer, shared pasta dishes, desserts. Wow! Great job. The pasta was all perfectly made. Service was outstanding. Great atmosphere. The kitchen worked on cooking whatever my nieces wanted with no issues. Could not have been more happy with our meal. This is a must for anyone looking for a great meal in the area."
"3.75 / 5This place is huge. You walk in and its dark, intimate, and somewhat cozy despite the large interior space. The food was okay. Nothing really special stood out; but nothing sucked either. Our group of 5 gentlemen ordered an array of tapas style entrees. Portions were slightly larger than most tapas-bar. The shrimp risotto was the dark horse that captured our attention. Creamy and full of flavor. I would recommend this place if you exhausted your list of river north eateries. Food: 3 / 5Service: 4.2 / 5Vibe: mid 20's to late 30's on a night out. Dark and crowded."
Came here coz of the 4 star rating. Unfortunately the rating was misleading. Horrible food. Pathetic bread- bad start to the dinner (they should just get some from trader joes instead). Got the stagioni pizza and is was underwhelming. Broccoli rabe was okay.Service is good but doesn't make up for lack of quality.
the tiramisu is good  very creamy but too sweet！ the pork shrank and octupus is just so so！
"Dinner was wonderful. We sat outside on the upstairs balcony. It was just my daughter and me  so we had the eggplant parmesan, penne ala vodka and vegetable pizza.  Everything we had was delicious but definitely save room for dessert. The panino al gelato limone was amazing and our waitor told us that they could serve half portions so it was the perfect size as well."
"I am sorry, but I don't get the hype. I came here for a mini birthday party with my friends. Street parking was quite easy that weekend. Ordered their pizza and other appetizers. It was just okay?? Service was not too great because there were a few other bigger birthday events going on. This place is great for a huge crowd. Very roomy with big tables. But other than that, I just think it's okay for a downtown restaurant."
"We went there for lunch on Father's Day. While the food was decent, the service was simply awful. Our server disappeared for long periods of time and ignored our attempts to flag her down. Asking another server and the maitre d' wasn't very helpful either. It was something the whole family was looking forward to, but ended up being a terrible experience."
"Great place for a group dinner. The place was wild when we got there with birthday parties and bachelorette gatherings alike. The food was standard. Traditional Italian. Nothing too special, but certainly tasty. But the wine comes in carafes of many sizes and was VERY reasonably priced."
Dishes are small. Waiters are impatient. Food is ok. We tried a little bit of everything and did not get satisfied.
"Went to Quartino on valentines day and enjoyed a good dinner and very good wine at a very reasonable price. Quartino serves small dishes, basically Italian tapas. A lot of places have moved towards small dishes and vastly overcharge, but Quartino doesn't really overcharge, I felt the prices were entirely reasonable.Went with the Cloudy Bay savignon blanc, quarter liter is only $15 and the Cloudy Bay is one of the most expensive wines on the menu! Other wines were as little as $7 for a quarter liter - incredible! Quartino will always be a good option if only for this reason.Our first dish was the veal meatballs in a tomato-basil sauce. The meatballs were certainly very good, though I would have preferred a little more seasoning to the meat. They bring parmesan for you to grate yourself and red chili flakes which added the flavor I desired though.Our next dish was maybe my favorite - the creamy polenta. It was cooked perfectly, just smooth enough but still with good texture and had a delicious cheese flavor. I added a bit of parmesan on top though this was unnecessary as the polenta had a delicious cheese flavor already.Our last savory dish was the ravioli. While the ravioli was fine, I guess I was hoping for a bit more, especially based on the menu's description and some yelp reviews. The flavors in the ravoli really just melded and I didn't get any of the unique incredients.Lastly we had dessert. She went with a cannoli which she said was excellent and the size was perfect for dessert. I had a half tiramisu which was still huge, good, but enormous. I took half of my half tiramisu home. I can't imagine what a single, full portion of the tiramisu would look like.Overall, good atmosphere, reasonable price, good food. Would definitely go back."
"Horrible food! We walked in on a monday night.  The place was packed. But the food is very tasteless and pricy.  The waitress and service was mediocre as well.   As far as  dinning here again, not a chance  If you want italian food try little italy instead."
"This place is great! It's like a very reasonable priced place in the heart of downtown Chicago. Their dish are around $10, definitely try their pizzas, it's home made and it's great. The staff here are nice. The portions are perfect and you won't feel like your stomach is going to explode. This place gets pretty full so you might need to make a reservation."
"Found this place near a show that we were planning to see in the evening. Ordered 5 plates among 3 ladies since we weren't particularly hungry, nor do we eat a lot. If you have a bigger appetite, you will need more plates because the portions are relatively small. I would definitely recommend the beef short ribs, not messy at all since the meat sits loosely on the bone, and it's very tender. Their cauliflower was different than how they are usually served. Basically one giant cauliflower with a green sauce and slightly broiled. The brussel sprouts are standard, as I liked them. Now the duck prosciutto took me by surprise, it was good, but it was tiny. There were 6 small pieces along with some vegetables, wouldn't get it for the price of the plate. The shrimp wasn't too special either, tasted more fishy than I had expected. The ambience was warm and the crowd wasn't too loud. There is plenty of space but the tables are a little close together, which made getting out a bit difficult. but overall, I would recommend it."
"House cured salumi, thin crust stone oven baked pizza, hand crafted fresh pasta..... Quartino's delcious meal was served in reasonable portions and clearly designed for sharing.  Unpretentious casual vibe made it a perfect spot for our family to indulge our last night in Chicago.I been back once since for a quick nightcap, this place has not disappointed."
"Only thing you need to know? The cold pizza the next day makes your tastebuds tingle with anticipation and excitement (almost) as much as the day of.Alright, there's a bit more to be said. But honestly I'm not sure I can add anymore to what everyone else has already gushed about. The environment, food, and service are impeccable, top-notch. Our waiter was patient, friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable not just about all aspects of the ""usual suspects"" on the food menu, but which wines/sizes would go well with our meal as well.We ordered the Campania pizza (a white pizza), the duck prosciutto, and a sort of self-devised concoction pasta that was pure perfection on a plate. Our pasta was an angel hair with vodka sauce and garlic and it was the ideal serving size for two mildly hungry people who still would like to devour a delicious thin-crust pizza. Our waiter seemed to read our mind when we couldn't find a pasta off the menu that really appealed off the bat and suggested that we invent our own to our liking.The duck prosciutto was very good, but certainly more of an amuse-bouche than a stand-alone plate, in my opinion? It had a great chewiness and mouthfeel and a good cured flavor, but wasn't too salty at all. There was also a side of pickled vegetables that I wasn't very impressed by, but this is more because I don't really care for pickled things in general.The pizza, oh mygoodness, the pizza. Ricotta cheese, soft cherry tomatoes, basil, I don't know how this could possibly go any better than it did. The pizza was so fresh and delicious that it felt like every bite I took only increased my happiness further and made me crave more! (rather than that pesky diminishing returns theory). I honestly have a slight desire to live here in Chicago forever just so I never have to be too far away from the pizza. I don't really like deep dish pizza too much (too heavy with the tomato), but I love thin-crust, and this thin-crust pizza is, without a doubt, the best I've ever had.Quartino, I will keep you in my heart and memory until we can finally be together again!! Love, your number 1 California fan."
"Just yummy goodness....amazing polenta fries, veal meatballs, pizza, salami, awesome bolognese sauce....on and on...great service too. Owned by the Gibsons folks. Gets very packed early....open very late...probably the best time to go....sample a bunch of stuff with friends."
"We just had AMAZING meal! The food and service was some of the best I've had. We started with the kale salad, on the recommendation of or server, Sinead, which was delicious- the dressing and pickled red onions were a delightful addition. We also had the calamari, cavateppi and shrimp risotto. Everything was served piping hot and delicious. We had a mishap with our wine which was spilled by a child next to us but the lovely manager, Alisia, without complaint from us, replaced the wine. To top it all off- we had tiramisu and lemon panettone with lemon curd. One of the BEST dessers we have ever had. Hands down recommending to friends and family. Keep up the great work!!"
Always full on the weekend but sooooo good! Have not tried a dish I didn't like. I recommend the dates and the tortellini. Yum!
Very authentic!! I started with the arugula salad which was fresh and a great dish to get the appetite fired up. I then had the Pappardelle with braised beef. It was the best pasta dish I ever had outside of Italy. The house made bread went wonderfully with that slow cook thick sugo!! I finished with the organic veal. Grilled perfectly and melted in my mouth. It was served with arugula which matched nicely!!
"I have always enjoyed going to Quartino. It's affordable, good Italian food, and the services is usually pretty good. I went there last weekend and got the tortellini. My friends ordered the gnocchi and penne alla vodka. We took bites of each others dishes. The tortellini was my favorite because it was rich and they gave me the perfect portion to be content. The gnocchi was awesome but extreamly hot. So beware before you bite into it. I thought the penne alla vodka was pretty mediocre and nothing to write home about. The reason I enjoyed the tortellini so much was because it had proscuitto which I thought was a really great touch. It was just perfect and I am craving it ever since I had it.  I thought the service could have been better and that is why I deducted some points."
Awesome food and wonderful ambiance!Had a great time enjoying outside dinning and cocktails!
"so glad to finally try this place as it's now one of my fav spots. My friend was running a marathon the next day so we had to make it a C A R B night (i sure dont mind). From the Terrace seating, yummy Prosecco, amazing people watching, to the delicious Pizza & Pasta...this is now on my favs list."
Love this place. Bartender Trevor always takes care of us! Tapas menu makes it fun to share the amazing dishes.Wish the Halibut was back on the menu. Trevor makes the best expresso martinis! !!!
"Fabulous Italian in a fabulous city! The menu is just the right size so every dish taste like it's being cooked in a small Italian kitchen. The pastas are fresh with a great selection of antipasto and of corse desserts. The terrace is a great summer spot after a day or evening on Michigan Ave. Fabulous food, wine fabulous Quartino!"
"Holy sh*t. Just go. I don't even know why you're still reading this. Reserve a table or just walk...now. Don't go anywhere else, go here. Please. I implore you.Now that I've gotten my lame attempt at Yelp humour out the way, here's why I'm so stoked about this place, brodie. Pasta, sauces and bread are housemade, and all that jazz. I'm no expert of Italian food, but I can assure you that in the few dozen family-owned places I've been to across the nation, none of them are touching Quartino.I had fettuccine alfredo, my friend had some kind of short ribs pasta dish and we shared a half liter of sangria and an assortment of olives. Prices are AWESOME. For the two of us, our meal was under 50 bucks and that's with the espresso closer.I don't wanna bore you with all the deets...just take your butt there pronto. And ask for John, he's a cool guy."
"We got a last minute reservation and were delighted as the food was delicious!  We ordered the meatballs, burrata salad, shrimp, roasted baby octopus, and broccoli rabe and all were tasty, with the octopus and meatballs being my favorites,  The portions are small, but they are tapas, so that was expected and great for sharing."
"Came here for dinner on our destination bachelorette party from Miami  and highly enjoyed it! We made a reservation for party of 8 and were seated immediately ! Bread was ready for us on the table and we ordered our bottles of wine before everyone took their seats! Ordered the bean and garlic dip , dates and the platter of olives , cheese and meats to start ! Everything was fantastic! As we are a foodie group we reached tried an entree and shared! There was nothing we did not enjoy ! Short ribs, ravioli , linguine with clams, sauce less pizza , meatballs... Everything was divine!! And to top it all off we ordered The Nutella dessert and the delish balls of fried dough with chocolate sauce! It was literally foodgasm galore for us! Service was quick and friendly and the food and wine was spectacular! Highly recommend !"
"Good food at a great price.. Although Tapas style, portion sizes were actually good enough to share... Not like others that I have been to. The ambience is unique in its own way.. Was fully packed even on a Wednesday even at 8:30 pm.. Great, fast service.. Only reason for 4 Stars - There isn't enough space between tables and I did get quite a few ""bumps"" by people coming in and going out..."
"One of my favorite places in Chicago. Great food, fun, busy, family style my kind of place."
"Doesn't get better than this. Great food,  little loud but worth it . From tourists to service industry, this place is excellent, consistent, and always a great time"
"My friend and I checked this place out as an option for a dinner - we ordered an assortment of olives (gaeta, green leccino, and Sicilian oil cured), a Funghi neopolitan pizze (that is made with Italian flour, San Marzano tomatoes, parmesan and housemade mozzarella), Dates wrapped in Pancetta (stuffe dwith Gorgonzola dolce and drizzled with honey), House Made Goat's Milk Ricotta (with fresh oregano and DOP Val di Mazara Organic EVOO), Penne alla Vodka (an imported pasta with vodka, tomatoes, garlic, red chili, basil, and cream), the Beef Short Ribs (with salsa verde), and for dessert, the Coppa al Banana (with caramelized banana slices, vanilla gelato, biscotti, whipped cream, chocolate sauce and shavings).  I really enjoyed the Goat's Milk Ricotta as it was very fresh, and the toasted ciabatta that it came with was great and crunchy with the soft spread.  The Beef Short Ribs was another favorite, as it was very tender and fell off the bone, and was juicy and saucy.  The penne was also good, but a little gunky.  I really enjoyed the dessert as well as it had a great banana flavor all throughout (the biscotti was a little wet, as I expected it to be nice and crunchy).  It's good to order several plates to share, as it is more of a tapas place (the prices are reasonable, considering this is in downtown Chicago); apparently, their wine selection is also good, but we opted out of that.  It kind of gets chaotic in there, and try to get a corner seating as your chair might get bumped numerous times during your dining as passerbyers and waitstaff makes their way around to deliver the dishes.  It is dimly-lit in there and an interesting vibe, and it seems as if locals as well as those after a long day of shopping make their way here for some meals.  Making a reservation is highly suggested as this place gets really packed.  It's a loud atmosphere, so if you want to have a nice quiet conversation, this isn't the place.  Parking is kind of a pain, but there are some rare metered-parking up along Erie.+Goat's Milk Ricotta+Beef Short Ribs+make reservations+some parking on Erie"
"Quartino's never disappoints. We live across the street and have been dining here about once per month since we moved to the area. As always, the pizzas and pastas are fantastic. Service is spot on. They really enjoy serving locals, which is different than many popular River North restaurants. If I had to be picky, I would only make one change. I wish they baked their own bread. This, to me, would be the icing on the cake. Keep up the good work Quartino's!"
"This seems like a fun place to go with a group.. Unfortunately I was traveling solo on business and therefore didn't get the full experience.I got seated outside right away. The hostess seemed sort of aloof and was more focused on looking pretty than being friendly and welcoming. It then took almost 20 minutes for somebody to come take my order.  The waiter was extremely friendly and sociable so that was nice, but he was slow all night due to a seemingly limited amount of staff working the crowded outdoor patio section.The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and tasted good - I got the steak carpaccio and veal meatballs with a soft cheese topping from the wine plate menu.  I probably would've given quartino a 4 out of 5 based solely upon the food but unfortunately I then sat there with nothing in front of me for another 15 minutes before I could find my waiter and ask for the check.All in all, solid food, good for groups, but definitely not the best service I've received in Chicago."
"The food was very tasty but I wasn't a fan of the ambiance. We went on a Saturday night around Christmas and were seated upstairs right next to the staircase. We felt like we were at a train station will all of the people walking up and down, in and out of the restaurant. It was seriously constant so didn't make for a relaxing night when you pair that with the ridiculous noise level. I wish I had known this before since we were celebrating a birthday with family and trying to make it special. Service was sub-par. I attribute this to the super busy Saturday night although that isn't an excuse. We were rarely checked on, food took quite awhile to come and I wouldn't say anyone working there seemed particularly happy. The lady hosts had no expression and were not welcoming when we checked in and one even yelled at the other in front of us.Overall, the food was very good, nothing amazingly great but definitely good quality and flavor. Ambiance - not a great choice for a celebration of any kind. I would definitely go back but only for a quick, casual lunch or for a drink at the bar. Also very touristy - something I don't usually mind but I know some of my fellow Chicagoans try and stay away from places like that. Just something to keep in mind."
Came here at 1 am - bar was open and pizza was available but the full menu was unavailable!  Loved the ambiance
"An attractive atmosphere with disappointing entrees.I was pretty excited for this place because all the tapas I have had in downtown Chicago so far have been nothing short of incredible. The atmosphere at Quartino projected a  fun, crowded setting, really great for small groups, so I was eager to try it out. However, the dishes you find at Quartino never break the ""average"" rank. Some dishes are a little larger than some other tapas places, and it may be a little cheaper here depending on what you order...but if you're looking for a taste explosion in your mouth, it's best to venture elsewhere (like the Purple Pig)."
"I had a great lunch here while exploring the Magnificent Mile, directed in part by Yelp reviews.  They make most of the pasta in house and the tagliatelle al sugo was truly excellent.  I never felt rushed even though I was there by myself and the waiter was very nice and explained all the specials.  I also had a very reasonably priced and delicious red wine and warm chocolate cake to top it off.  I hope to return next time I am in Chicago."
Amazing food! Tends to be loud inside but worth it for the polenta fries and pizza.  Great for small groups to share plates.
"3.5 stars if I could.Went for a large group dinner on a recent Saturday night and had mixed feelings going in.  Usually not a fan of these semi ""tourist trap"" establishments as it can produce diminished returns on quality.Nice wine list to choose from and ended up snagging a bottle of the downright awesome nero d'avola from Sicily.  That was at least worth a half star alone.  Had a gigantic variety of mixed small plates to pass amongst the table and they were mostly good.Highlight for me was probably the goat's milk ricotta with grilled bread.  Creamy and delicious, with a nice topping of fresh oregano and good olive oil.  Tried the gnocchi too (okay), the bacon wrapped dates (okay), and the baby octopus (above average).  Tried a bite of the sausage risotto which was very good.All told, for a large, downtown, touristy kind of place, it was better than I thought it would be , but probably not a place I'd revisit if it were up to me given the huge quantity of fine dining establishments available in the city.Bonus points for playing 'To Catch a Thief"" on loop during the meal.  That, along with the wine, almost allowed me to drift away and forget about the 15 degree temperatures and snow outside..."
"The word ""mediocre"" describes this place best. Everything on the menu sounds so good, but the execution just isn't there. - Margherita pizza: flavor was good, but the crust wasn't the best. I've had much better Neapolitan  pizza. 3/5- Polpette Al Sugo Di Pomodoro: these meatballs lacked flavor, my least favorite of all the dishes. 2/5-  Broccoli Rabe:  this had a nice spice to it, but the overall flavor was lacking. 3/5- Roasted Baby Octopus: once again, this didn't have much flavor. 3/5- Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare: the best dish by far, but still nothing to get excited about. 3.5/5Just like the food, the service wasn't great. The food is brought out by food runners, so our waiter was never around when we needed other things like more bread or crushed red pepper. We only saw the waiter a few times throughout the meal. Some positives about this restaurant: food is very fast and the restaurant has a nice welcoming atmosphere."
Quartino is a well earned 5 stars! Their pizza is delicious and both entrees myself and my date enjoyed were delicious! Theresa was a great server even on a busy St. Patrick's day  Saturday. Felt a little cramped at our tiny table next to a wall but given the weekend not much of an issue. Was amazing food and and even better service. I would certainly eat here again and highly recommend.
"My husband and I are moving to Chicago in August so we were going around with a wonderful apt. broker who I meant through the Booth Partners program. We all were exhausted from looking places that day and wanted some great food with wine. She suggested this place and she really hit the nail on the head. The food was divine, the service was attentive without hovering and the wine was very light which is what we wanted. This will definitely be on our list of places to visit once we move to the area to make it one of our ""go to spots""."
"A fun place to sample great food.  Kind of noisy, but worth it!Try the Tomato Soup!Various pastas and appi's are terrific.  Would be 5 star, but for the noise... Guess I'm getting older..."
"This is definitely a fun spot, but boy is it loud and busy.  We were there on a Friday night so yeah to be expected.  It would be great for a large group with all the small plates, but that night you would only be able to hear what you immediate neighbor was saying so not exactly prime if you want to talk to the rest of your party.We decided to try a neapolitan pie for an app. since they seemed to be well received.  Unfortunately, this pizza delivered little of what you expect from this style of pie.  The crust, which is often the star, was barely blistered and was limp.  The fennel sausage, onion and tomato topping was just a big yawn.  Needless to say no doggie bag needed here.The entrees fared better.  Home made pasta always makes me happy and this bowl of cavatelli with tomatoes, fresh basil and ricotta did make me smile - just a real rustic dish.  The eggplant parmigiana looked great and was enjoyed by my dining partner.  Can't recall the other dish but it was enjoyed as well.The prices here are super reasonable for the food and the wine.  It was nice to get a 1/2 carafe and not part with half of my wallet.  The menu selection was extensive and intriguing.  I might be back for a happy hour drink and snack but probably not for a main meal."
Loved this place.......great food and the service very friendly and efficient!
My partner and I have been dining at Quartino at least weekly for many years.  We feel it is a great value and the food quality is very high.  Service is always good and attentive and we are always greeted warmly.  I would highly recommend the restaurant .
Had a really sweet and romantic meal outside here on my last night in Chicago this past Sunday. Ordered the margherita pizza which was really tasty and thin crust. No frills. Also had the veal meatballs and the ravioli. I loved both except the ravioli was a bit salty. My pomegranate martini was great and the babe ordered red wine which came with a funny regular cup just like in Italy. I think it's good for a breezy date night. Our server was a helpful and pretty girl whose name I didn't catch. Recommend.
Came here based on a friend's recommendation. Veal meatballs and gnocchi are a must try. The place gets extremely crowded on weekends. Expect to a long wait. Staff service is a bit slow but the food came out quickly.
"I've always been a fan of Quartino. I'm not saying it's ever my first choice but I wouldn't be disappointed here. The menu has something to please everyone so it's a great place for groups. They always seem to handle large groups well from what I can tell. The wine list is nice and they have some awesome cocktails. I feel the prices are average given the location/quality. Overall, it's one of my top picks in the immediate area."
"I love this place!  It brings you back to that time you ventured out to a piazza in Italy.  Nice staff (love the football jerseys).  It was the perfect weather to sit outside with some sangria, say goodbye to summer and welcome fall.  We had the Stefano pizza...delicioussss.  The crust was yummy and garlicy.. I don't like crust and I devoured my slices like there was no tomorrow *not really.  The calamari was good, it wasn't the best, but it was nice and crispy.  We'll always come here for the pizza, the salumi, and the familial feel the servers and the restaurant gives.  Thanks!"
"Had dinner there last night 3/1 and have reservations again for 3/2 to continue exploring the menu. Excellent SEVICE and ambiance but the food is OUTSTANDING, if you are in Chicago please make this a MUST, you won't be disappointed."
Our must eat location every time we come to Chicago. If you can stand the noise and tight space the food is outrageous! Fresh pasta. House cured meats. And wine cheaper than water! Favorite dish: Tortellini Alfredo with prosciutto and peas
"If you enjoy amazingly delicious, small plates of Italian tapas in a large, noisy, turbulent environment, by all means indulge. I could not even finish my meal because the atmosphere was so loud and unsettling. I can only really describe it as complete chaos. Everyone was packed in tight and people and plates were flying everywhere. I have nothing but the utmost respect for people that work here. It's like the stock market but with plates breaking every ten seconds. Success at this job qualifies the employee for any combat position in the United States military. If your intention is to relax while dining out (a crazy concept), and you insist on going here, bring some strong sedatives and you will settle in for a enjoyable dining experience. I would suggest at least 2 xanax or 3 one milligram ativans before even attempting to eat here. Or, I would strongly consider having at least one bottle of wine before venturing in and requesting another upon entry immediately. Perhaps the noise factor is part of some devious wine selling stratagem? The acoustics at the restaurant do suggest it was designed and built like a hall. I don't know.  What i do know is I will try this spot again sedated because the food seemed delicious. I will post a separate review reflecting what the sedated experience was like. Thanks for reading."
Excellent short rib and octopus. The pizza was ok. Very nice service but the room was very noisy.
"Sunday night, party of 6 was seated promptly in a nice, slightly quieter corner. EVOlive oil available with house bread was delicious. Best dishes were broccoli rabe, polenta fries, and calamari. Veggies definitely done well!!"
Try the bacon wrapped dates! They're absolutely delicious! You get 8 with an order but you'll wish there were more.
"Quartino is my go to for great Italian food for very decent prices and an amazing ambiance!  I've been here over 10 times and just can't get enough.  It is perfect for a two person lunch/dinner outing or for a small to large gathering with family and friends.Quartino must haves:Polenta FriesLinguini with ClamsMushroom RisottoShrimp RisottoBurrataPotato PureePenne alla VodkaThe Shrimp and Scallops from the Seafood sectionProfiterolesZeppoleThey also have a great and affordable wine selection.If you haven't been, what are you waiting for?!  You will not be disappointed at all. This is one of Chicago's Best restaurants, in my opinion! The last time I was there, my table and I spotted Mila Kunis dining at Quartino at the same time.  Celebrity Sighting = Added Bonus!"
"The sampler for two is pretty good, but you'll do better kicking off your own adventure.Sangria is decent, and cheap!Think of the loudest restaurant you've been to. Now double it. Bring your ear plugs.For decent food at decent prices I would give Quartino 4 stars, but they had us wait 25 minutes for a reservation and the calamari tasted like they took it out of a box they bought at Jewel up the street."
"I always love Quartinos.  It's simple, small plate, Italian, but everything is quality.  ItI came here this weekend for a lunch with two others.  We had the calamari, shrimp risotto, and tortellini.  Everything came out hot and fresh.  The calamari is always my favorite bc it isn't overly breaded or fried, it's light and tasty.  The risotto was also very flavorful and not drowning in sauce.  I've also had their beef filets and scallops for something a little more filling.  I've yet to try their pizza, but I would like to, as I've heard good things!I didn't have anything to drink, but their beer and wine is decent and very affordable.  They also seal bottles for you to take home if you don't finish your's.Excellent service as well!! Love it in the summer when you can sit on the upper balcony outside.  Beautiful presentation."
"This was my first time here. I went on a lovely Saturday afternoon and sat outside. Quartino seems like a nice spot to bring a few friends. For a busy Saturday, the noise on the street was actually quite low to moderate. The staff was attentive and everything was reasonably clean.But let's be honest, we also go out to eat for the food. The caprese salad was fresh and a delicious start. Then, the seafood soup, Brodetto Ai Frutta Di Mare, was actually quite tasty. One of the tastiest I've ever had. The broth had more body and there was a lot of content in the soup. I have to keep this separate to forewarn you. Whatever you do, do not order the gnocchi. We ordered the gnocchi which was surprisingly bland and covered with oil and garlic. Whatever you do, do not order the gnocchi.  Supposedly, it was cooked with pork stock, but I did not taste it. Green beans were like a mechanical soft texture, and if there was arugula in this... I don't know man, I didn't see it in the sea of oil. Presentation was poor. It was also a bit too chewy. I would have ordered more and stayed longer had the gnocchi not ruined my palate. Overall, not bad. I would visit again. Just don't get the gnocchi."
"Quartino: utstanding food, wine, serviceDelicious dinner consisted of an excellent salumeria sampler of salads (shout out to the eggplant caponnata!), salamis, cheeses, olives, and bread. A half-liter of Termed Numantia tempranillo paired perfectly with the food. Waitress Alysia provided top-notch service and was friendly and helpful as well. Quartino offers great value for money. I highly recommend it."
"I had to alter my reservations last minute, they were more than accommodating. Walked in accidentally during restaurant week. Generally, we enjoyed most of the food, farmhouse chicken, Alfredo, short ribs to name a few.  The best ending was the caramelized banana and strawberry - it was to die for."
All very delicious foods on small plates. I can't say I left feeling incredibly full but it was a fun place to try. We made reservations for a large group which I would recommended Fri & Sat night as this is a popular place. The atmosphere was very loud since it was crowded and very open.
"Not a bad place, but definitely don't come here if you want an intimate evening. I think this place deserves 3.5 stars, but the risotto was so good that I'll bump it up to 4 stars. I came here with two friends and we ordered three dishes and an appetizer, plus some wine. We got the gnocci, margherita pizza, truffle risotto, and polenta fries. The truffle risotto was by far the best dish we had. It was absolutely delicious! The only downside was that it was pretty small for three people (I'd recommend at the most for two people). The pizza was alright; nothing super spectacular, especially in a city that's known for its pizza. The gnocci was definitely my least favorite. It had a weird taste that I couldn't place. I believe on the menu it was listed as pesto/basil or something and it didn't taste like either of those things. The polenta fries were alright. I enjoyed them, but I wish they came with more sauce. The sizes of the dishes are pretty small, which kind of was a bummer, especially for how much you're paying, so keep that in mind when ordering to share.Our server was decent. He was nice, but when it came to picking a wine, he made me feel kind of uncomfortable. We wanted to try a couple wines because we weren't sure which one we wanted, and whenever we'd ask to try a new one, he'd respond ""Oh...you want ANOTHER one?"" I might just be overreacting, but it definitely made me feel like he didn't want us to keep trying wines. He also made me feel a little uncomfortable when we were asking about the portion sizes of the food. His suggestions almost made me feel like we were fat for ordering so much food. It was...interesting, but I think he was trying to be nice for the most part. A lot of his suggestions were also questionable.The restaurant itself is EXTREMELY ""cozy"", meaning you are literally inches away from the table next to you. I had a whole lotta butts rubbing against me trying to squeeze through the tables, which would more reasonable if the butts all belonged to other patrons, but most of the butts actually were servers....Overall, it's a little pricy, but some of the dishes are worth it. I'm iffy on the servers, and the spacing between the tables. If I were to ever come back, I'd definitely order maybe one plate just for myself and another to share with a person, instead of trying to share all the plates."
"We had a delicious dinner here on Friday night. Make reservations for the weekend. The food and ambiance were both excellent. This is great for a larger group as you can all share and try everything. We had the shrimp, two pasta dishes, a pizza, and two salads - all were delicious! For being so close to the Magnificent Mile, this is reasonably priced and you don't feel so touristy. This is a great find."
"Do not understand why people love this place. Yes, the idea of italian tapas is interesting, but the execution of it downright fails at Quartino. Imagine a fancified version of Maggiano's, with a third of the plate size, and 1 1/2 times the price. Then cram yourself in among hundreds of other people with mediocre wine and hurried, uninterested service...and there you have it, a Saturday night at Quartino."
"No matter what day of the week, our experience has been stellar. Watching the entire staff orchestrate a busy Friday night with every table filled was amazing. Our server Ty added to the entertainment. The small plate meals were timed better than the airlines.  We can't say enough about the food. Delightful. If you want a quiet romantic dinner----get a room. If you want energy and experience we suggest Quartino."
"I will say that the food is pretty good. I was able to sample several things and enjoyed most of it. Having said that the portion sizes are small and the prices are ridiculous because of that. I also felt like the service was horrible. In honestly we were there on a Saturday evening with a large party sitting outside, but it was still really hard to get a refill or anything. We literally had to yell down our waitress when somebody needed something, because they weren't checking in on us or recognizing that we needed more drinks. The restrooms have attendants, which I honestly don't feel is necessary at a place like this. I will say that it was pretty cool how they appeared to be showing Italian programming on their televisions though. With service this poor and portion sizes this small I can't believe this place is calling itself an Italian restaurant. I won't be back."
"I am not a big pasta eater. I generally don't crave a big Italian dinner. One thing I do love, however, is great food with great flavor! I also love trying many different things. Quartino is my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago, and I don't go there for the pasta, eggplant parmesan, or the pizza. While those dishes are amazing as well, their seafood dishes and meat dishes are also incredible.After winning a bet over which team would score the first touchdown during the Super Bowl, Valentine's Day dinner was my choice! I knew right away that I was in the mood for Quartino, and everything that they have to offer.If you are wanting a private, romantic atmosphere, Quartino is not the place to choose. It is loud and crowded, but it somehow feels like a family gathering. I LOVE that. The lighting is dim, which does make it feel slightly more intimate.On to the food... We pretty much knew EXACTLY what we would be ordering before we even got there. We are pretty loyal to our favorite dishes, but are always trying at least one new thing each time. We started out by ordering their house red wine. The rosso. It is only $20 dollars for an entire liter, and we enjoyed it. We ordered the cheese fondue which comes with bread to dip. We added apples to the order, because apples and cheese... killer combo! The fondue is a really nice dish, because it's something to nosh on as you wait for your other dishes to arrive.The grilled octopus is really good, as well. It has a slightest of a spicy kick to it. It's really good! It is a must-order for me.The steamed clams are phenomenal! They actually give you a decent portion with grilled bread. You will need that grilled bread to soak up the delicious, brothy sauce that the clams are served in.If you are pasta lover, I highly recommend the cavatappi. It is a house-made pasta that is extremely doughy in texture, which I like. It is slathered in a marinara sauce with fresh basil. I cannot forget to mention that it is also topped with globs of ricotta. Perfect!My boyfriend always chooses the meat dish since he is more of a meat-eater than I am. Per recommendation of our fabulous server, Juan, we chose the veal skirt steak. IT. WAS. PERFECT.We finished our meal with espresso and a vanilla gelato with bananas. We savored every bite of that dessert!We will be back to Quartino many many times!"
"It's been 3 days since I ate at quartinos and I am still recovering. I spent the first night in the E.R. after eating there. The last time I've been this sick was when I had Typhoid in Mexico. I'm not exaggerating or a dramatic person. My digestive tract is seriously messed up. It started to hit me on the subway ride home from the restaurant. 3 hours later, I was still violently ill. Vomited for the next 5 hours. My god it was awful. Never eating there again."
"Wow. Just wow! Excellent customer service AND fantastic food. You can tell how invested the owners and management are in their staff, and it totally translated table side. I recommend the kale salad, the minestrone(vegetarian to boot), and the veal flank steak with wild rocket and roasted cherry tomatoes. So good and so affordable, I left a 40% tip! Thanks Sam and Ryan, one of the best meals I've had in Chicago in the 10 times I've been here in the last 3 years!!!"
"We recently hosted a party here for 32 people in one of their private rooms. The food was great, and the service blew us away! From the planning process to the actual dining experience, everything was top notch. We look forward to hosting other celebrations here in the future."
We joined a group for brunch the day after a wedding. We were on a second floor balcony that was a perfect location in the warmth with a light breeze. The gluten free menu had lots of interesting choices and two of us shared a $25 Salumaria Tasting that was excellent as were our drinks. Service was outstanding. Great spot for brunch with shared dishes.
"I went for dinner last Saturday. We had a reservation and only waited a few minutes. The place was PACKED! Our table was right near the door so every time it opened, we got a draft. Wasn't a fan of that. In terms of food, I had the dates as an appetizer and they were amazing. Wrapped in pancetta and stuffed with gorgonzola. Definitely wonderful! I also had the cheese fondue, which was ok. I wasn't TOO impressed, but it was good. I had a size of cured olives as well, which were delicious. My friend had the Caprese salad (I've had it before, nothing great) and the Penne ala Vodka. I tried a bite and it was delicious, had a bit of a kick.My main problem this visit was service. I had to ask for butter twice and our waiter forgot we ordered drinks so we waited forever. Once we asked about it, he even admitted he just totally forgot. He also charged us for an item we didn't order and when we mentioned it, he laughed. Weird. Service was very slow, but I know it's not always like that.  I will be back, but probably when it is less busy."
"Perhaps the best Italian food I've ever had. The service is top notch, the ambiance is classy, yet casual and the food was amazing. Since there are so many reviews on how great this place is, I'll only give you one tip..... They do half portions, so make sure you come here and eat Family Style.... do more than one entree and try all their pastas. The vodka sauces are to die for.I'll be back as often as I possibly can in my lifetime... it's that good."
"Quartino is one of the best restaurants in all of River North! I've been here at least 5 times and it has never disappointed. The menu is so vast the anyone (even vegetarians like me) can find several things they would like.  The service is always great (ask for Tony!) I would recommend this place for a group or just a friend date,  I wouldn't go here for a romantic date just because the atmosphere is loud and very busy.  Definitely ask the server to pair a wine with what you order as the wine menu is huge. I highly recommend the pizzas and minestrone soup.  They have a G free menu if that's your thing.  I always finish my dinner here with the house-made limoncello. Can't wait to go back to Quartino!"
"Quartino is an EXCELLENT spot for large groups of people. It is definitely on the louder side but that is a reflection of the family-style meals (where everyone is encouraged to share plates, etc.). The food is also quote good (and people should know that there is a LOT of it). I'd say that probably 2x the amount of food is served than is necessary. That said, it is all good and a fun place to eat.I also need to throw in a HUGE plug to Rodney; the bathroom attendant. A random woman spilled a red wine glass all over my khakis. When I went to the bathroom, Rodney immediately spotted it and went to work with a little stain-remover set he had in his bag. It was extremely kind of him to help out and it ended up saving my pants. That level of service goes above and beyond expectations. He's an excellent guy."
"I've been here three times in the past couple of months and for the location, price, and quality of food, this place CAN'T BE BEAT! I went twice with a large party, so I got to sample a ton of dishes like the D'Anitra (duck prosciutto) pizza, gnocchi, beef short ribs, and veal meatball sliders to name a few. My favorite dishes were the salumeria tasting platter and the tortellini. As a girl that loves her cured meat and cheeses, the salumeria tasting is a steal where you can get 2 house made salumi, 2 formaggi, 3 spuntini, and olives for only $25! Pinch me, I'm dreaming and went to salumi heaven! The tortellini was so creamy and melt-in-your-mouth and the plate came lined with prosciutto on it, so I was sold. The waiter even told us to order 2 plates when he saw that we were dining family-style and it was probably one of the best choices we made that night. Their sangria is also delicious and cheap too! Overall, a great place to bring your family and friends if you're looking for a cheap spot in River North and in the mood to share a ton of yummy Italian dishes."
"After a full day of exploring the city on foot, I was delighted to finally sit to an Italian dinner here.Like most Italian eateries, the atmosphere is loud with an energized positive ambiance.  I was glad to have outdoor patio seating on the second floor as it offered a great people watching experience above the street bustle.All the food was delicious which included scallops, ravioli and the beef fillets and our party of three ordered 2 liters of wine.The service was excellent, the waiter came by our table often checking in.For dessert, we had the Coppa al Banana mm mm mmmm...caramelized bananas, vanilla gelato, whipped cream, need I say more?"
"Worthy of an Emperor. Many ample plates. Wonderful pastas. Sufficient wines. Ah, and the desserts ... I thought I was home on the Via Appia. Take your cohort and go. Victory is yours."
Great place for lunch especially if you get a table on the outside.  Plate proportions are perfect... not too much.  Very classy and upbeat. Staff is friendly and efficient.  Never had a dish year that I was not totally impressed with.
"Came here for a girls' night out for dinner, and were going to see a show so we had to let the wait staff know and boy did they listen! Service was good but food was just alright. We got a pizza, meatballs, polenta fries, eggplant tapa, salami, and tiramisu. I also got a 1/4 L of wine, which was good. Everything was pretty pricey considering the quality. The dishes lacked the kind of flavor I was hoping, nothing was all that hot. It was okay, I've had better. Tiramisu was the best, even though it wasn't on the menu we asked and received. The bathroom attendants were annoying-- come ON people, really? I mean maybe at a rest stop, but a restaurant? The lady gave me sanitizer before I washed my hands. Just stop."
"Just fine for sharing tapas with friends, but nothing mind blowing. Had pizzas, gnocchi, app platter - everything was solid."
"The place is in a great location and has a very nice atmosphere, it opens late which is very convenient. The food is delicious, especially the organic veal with arugula and basil syrup. And the dessert was delightful, coppa al banana. One thing to keep in mind is that the plates' portions are similar to the appetizers'. All dishes are made to be shared, so if you're really hungry you might need to get more than one dish. We were two and had two dishes plus a dessert but we weren't so hungry because we had a Chicago deep dish pizza for lunch."
"Quartino is the perfect place for getting perfectly sized portions. The dining is family style. I love it because you get to try different things and I always leave not feeling over stuffed. The food is very good! The spinach is flavored well and the eggplant is good...just very cheesy! Also, the dessert is soo tasty. We've had profiterole and the hot chocolate cake with vanilla gelato. Both were so good and very big portions so it was good to share! Overall, Quartino is a nice, casual place to eat!"
"Somewhat pricey, but you get what you pay for. Also, since it's a tapas place, not everything comes out at once. We ordered 4 different things between 2 people and everything came out separately. This was ok because everything was sharing portions and everything was delicious. We also had some leftover to take home."
"Food ======Average price: $10Out of all the places I hit in Chicago, this was my favorite. The tapas were a bit pricey for tapas, but I suppose in a larger party I would be alright. For my small party, it meant that we were just ordering a dish each, kinda as if we were entrees.The pesto gnocchi was sooo good, as was the house peach mix. (like sangria, the description mentions something about cans; anyways, it was great) Defintely want to come back and try that meatball that everyone seems to be drooling over. Decor=======First thing to note is that is so very crowded, but that's atmosphere. As for the décor,  some very bachelor office vibes going; dark, heavy woods, mood lighting. Likeable. Service======While picking up drinks at the bar, noticed the manager come over and cover two patrons drinks as an apology that they had to wait on their reservation. The bar was hella crowded too, but the bartenders definitely had it covered."
"I decided to try Quartino since it was the 3rd most reviewed tapas restaurant in Chicago with over 2000 reviews. I came on a Sunday night around 9pm and it wasn't very crowded. 1) Veal Meatballs Napoli ($8.50)The veal meatballs were soooo soft!! Probably one of the best meatballs I've eaten. The meatballs were generously topped with raisins and tomatoes which complemented the lightly salted meatballs nicely. This dish was really worth it too - $8.50 for 4 large meatballs. I chose this over the other two meatball dishes (a meatball slider and polpette al sumo di pomodoro which were meatballs dressed with a tomato based sauce) because I wanted something different and less traditional. 2) Asparagus Risotto ($11.75)I saw many Yelpers raving about this dish. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this dish very much. It just felt as though I was eating creamed asparagus or thick asparagus porridge. 3) Roasted Baby Octopus ($10.50)My favorite dish of the night. The octopus was tender and you can taste a slight char on the tentacles. 4) Steamed Clams ($11.75)This was pretty ordinary. Steamed clams with white wine and served with some toast. I enjoyed it nonetheless. 5) Zeppole ($5.50)A HUGE plate of doughnuts (7 or 8 pieces). Soooo good. It's served with both a honey and dark chocolate dip. Was too full by this point for two of us to finish all though. A very hearty and satisfying dinner which I enjoyed thoroughly. Now, having tried the top 3 most reviewed tapas restaurants on Yelp, I would rank them in the order of the number of reviews each of them have ;) 1) GATG, 2) Purple Pig and 3) Quartino. It's definitely NOT that quartino is bad, it's just that I think the quality and standard of the food at GATG and purple pig are slightly better. Quartino is however the cheapest of them all."
"This is my new favorite restaurant!  The arugula pizza and roasted baby octopus reminded my wife and me of Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast.  Absolutely phenomenal!  The duck prosciutto and house made giardiniera is pretty ridiculously good too.  If limoncello is your thing, you won't be disappointed.  I highly recommend visiting, and ask for Sam to be your waiter, he's a real class act."
"I had the pleasure of visiting Quartino for the first time while visiting Chicago for work just last week. I live in Pittsburgh and have literally thought about this restaurant every day since my return a week ago. So where do I begin....My co-workers and I were looking for a great restaurant for dinner after we had spent the day traveling and working. Those of us who still had battery life on our iPhones were searching away on Yelp and Urbanspoon, trying to find a great spot for dinner. The first place that we found was small and had a 1-2 hour wait, so we decided to find another place.We were exhausted and starving when we finally stumbled into Quartino. It was a Monday night, and the restaurant was pretty deserted. We were quickly seated on the upstairs balcony. (Yes, we were lucky enough to be in Chicago when it was 68 degrees in December!) They tried to seat all five of us at a tiny table, but I asked if we could push two tables together to have more room. I think the staff anticipated that we would just order a small glass of wine and tiny appetizer to share... but they had no idea of the appetite we had worked up all day. We were ready for some serious ordering and table filling.Service was prompt and polite. The waiter presented our wine in a very formal manner, which I thought was interesting -- and a little awkward. However, once I began to eat, the food was so delicious that I entered an Italian food coma, ignoring all that was going on around me, including the fact that I didn't realize the balcony was completely filled until we left at 7:30pm.The great thing about trying new restaurants with a group is that you get to try so many different things! We tried -- Margherita Pizza, Salumeria Tasting, White Bean & Garlic Spread, Caprese Salad, Gnocchi, Cavatelli, Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, Tortellini, Penne alla Vodka, and Beef Short Ribs. All of our dishes were at least good while many dishes ranked in the excellent-and-still-dreaming-about-it-a-week-later category.I highly recommend ordering pasta here. Every pasta that came out seemed to top the previous. The Cavatelli in particular was a table favorite. As a pasta lover, my love of pasta is why I'm dreaming of returning in the future. I was disappointed in the Margherita Pizza -- it was a bit cold and bland -- but was told later by friends that the poor pizza quality is more of an exception than the rule. Apparently, they normally have fantastic pizza. I'll have to order a different type next time!Most importantly, I can't forget the wine! My table ordered a bottle of red and a carafe of white and only spent about $50 or $60 for both. And finally, the total bill... this will blow your mind......10 Dinner Items, ranging from Salad to Pasta and Meat+1 Bottle of Wine and 1 1/2 Liter of Wine=$200Wow. Not sure how that's possible... we were delightfully surprised that we walked away completely stuffed from a tapas restaurant and only spent $40 each.And all of the above is the reason why I will be dreaming of this restaurant until I return sometime in 2013."
"Really liked the vibe of this place and indeed the concept! Looking up the menu online I cannot recall much of what we ate, beyond the Eggplant Parmigiana.I do remember that it was all pretty good!Its good to see not only Italian beers on the menu but also local brews. I enjoyed a Founders Centennial IPA Came here based on the previous Yelp reviews, so thanks Yelp!"
"If tapas, and Italian food are your thing, I'd highly suggest Quartino as a spot in Chicago to come and try. What's great about tapas is that there's so much variety and the dishes are small. This offers a lot of food tasting, and is really great to socialize with.I came here with two of my other friends, and got seating right away because this spot is LARGE. There's a big first floor, and just as large second story. It's quite unbelieveable. Having such a vast menu, I would just suggest you not overly think about it, and just order what you think sounds good & have at it. That's the best way to do it!Foods don't come in any order. It's what ever is cooked and it just comes out. For example our sampler plate of meat and cheeses came last while the pasta and baked stuff came first. Odd, but not bad at all!Off our dinner adventure, I would recommend the following:1) Eggplant Parmigiana - I'm enjoy eating eggplant, and when breaded, I love it even more! Rich with flavor. Excellent!2) Steamed Clams - YES! Must get. Small clams, delicious in flavor. Rich! Save your bread and dip it in the juices. So much yum in a plate!3) Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - Pasta ribbons with braised beef in tomato sauce. As a pasta lover, this was devine. The braised beef was so soft. Very simple and well made.4) Veal Meatball Slider - Different and good. Eat this when it comes out and don't wait on it because it will get cold!Other tidbits -- if you are a Neopolitan Pizza lover, this spot may also be for you! The options for their pizza's were pretty large, so I'm going to assume that this is their bread and butter on top of tapas actually. For a couple that comes in, this may be the way to go if tapas isn't your thing.Wine options galore. Middle of the road pricing in my opinion. Not cheap, but not too expensive. We had 6-7 dishes, myself a 1/2 Sangria, and my other friend 1/2 red wine, the total came out to $130 not including tip. $35-40/head ~ can't complain when the food is great!"
"My whole division was taken out for a lunch here. There was 12 of us so there was a lot of food passed around. We sat outside, which may not have been the best idea. Since it's located on State, the traffic can get pretty loud. I really like the start out bread and the way the cheese is served for the oil/vinegar/cheese/pepper concoction is really clever. I will not even be able to tell you everything I tried but I will give a nice outline. The pizzas were my favorite part and the more toppings, the better. I like the spinach salad and the organic tomatoes. The pastas were ok and the charcuterie was not too bad. Overall, there was a lot more good than not so good. I will definitely go back, but only with large groups, so I can have a large choice again."
"Nice little pizza place and a reasonable drink selection. This place is incredibly loud. It's naturally a little noisy due to being a bar but the overly drunk people start screaming and then all hope is lost.Service is a little slow. They pack the people in here and it's challenging for anybody to simply move around. The servers will do what they can to move as quickly as they can but be prepared to sit with an empty glass or waiting for your check and be prepared for your chair to be bumped repeatedly as people try to squeeze through.Prices are fair, though, and they have decent hours. If you need a relatively quick dinner later in the evening, this is a viable candidate."
"No. This place is not good. The artichokes were disgusting... pretty sure just out of a can. I got the mushroom risotto was gritty, tasted like there was sand or something! The white bean dip was tasteless. Not sure why this place was so crowded and why there are so many good reviews!! Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing :(, the only saving grace was the sangria which was pretty ok."
"This place is amazing.  Came here on a Saturday night with my parents (glad we made reservations ahead of time, as it fills up!  Service was great, our server explained the 'family style/sharing' concept very well and answered all our questions.  It does get pretty packed in there when it fills up, but I didn't fell particularly cramped, nobody was bumping in to me, etc.  The food was amazing-we had a risotto, calamari, veal, and gnocchi and everything was good.  Dessert was the chocolate cake and the gelato trio, all very good, too.  No complaints about this place, I will definitely be going back."
"My first day in Chicago, and I've already hit up my SECOND tapas restaurant. I'm glad the windy city appreciates the act of sharing food!I checked out Quartino with two friends around 6pm and we were seated very promptly. It started getting more packed around 7pm. The interior is lovely and has a very different ambiance than what you would expect from a typical sit down restaurant. The staff are all wearing soccer jerseys and the decorations enhance the Italian atmosphere - you can even read different Italian newspapers while you wait!We started off with a complimentary serving of bread. The bread was not appetizing at all. It was cold and seemed somewhat stale, and it actually reduced my appetite. Not the best start to a meal.Our first dish was the baby spinach salad with pears, walnuts, and ricotta. The salad was nothing impressive at all. Super easy to replicate, and here you are spending $8 on it. Get another salad instead.Next was the duck prosciutto pizza. It's fairly well sized for the price, but you could hardly taste the duck that I eventually forgot I was eating duck pizza. What was more prominent was the generous topping of fresh arugula on top that added a unique peppery twist to each bite. The inside of the pizza was great, but the crust was way too hard.The last item to come out was the pappardelle (broad flat pasta) with braised beef tomato sauce. The pasta was tougher than what I'm used to, but apparently this is intentional. The beef and tomato sauce was excellent though. This is a sweet and savory dish that's easily enjoyable.On a humorous note, the bathroom utterly surprised me. I saw a gentleman who obviously worked there chatting it up with a customer while music was jamming in the background through a stereo set. He never once looked me in the eyes, but turned on the tap for me and offered me soap. Also available for use is mouthwash, lotion, and other bathroom essentials."
"I've now been here twice, each with a small group. Food is excellent! I've had their pizza, risotto, and a few other appetizers and have enjoyed all of it. Servers are upbeat and friendly, and food comes out quickly for how busy the restaurant is. The atmosphere is great, but the place can get very loud when it's crowded. Just an FYI - they bring out each dish as it's ready, so you may get yours before or after your friends."
Great Italian restaurant! Gives you a real Italian feel as well. The pizza is absolutely a bomb! Definitely try any options for that.
"Love the flavor of this restaurant. I've been coming here for years. Peter, the assistant manager is an amazing young man who makes you feel like family. The chef has told me I can give him suggestions of how I want my dishes. I just love them! And it doesn't hurt that the food is very good and the wine is excelente!! Nice median range of pricing too."
"This is a pretty good restaurant. They have a great selection of wine and we had a variety of tappas. We sat on the balcony which offered great people watching on the street. The food is good, service is good. Sorry, I was too hungry to take pictures."
"My spouse and I dined with Quartino's for the first time last night and we ABSOLUTELY loved it. I personally liked that they had a variety of price ranges to fit everybody's budget. It's rare to see a place that is accommodating to those with low budgets or high and is delicious regardless.We were given water and fresh soft bread upon sitting down and reviewing the cocktail, beer, and wine list. There were so many options! I ordered the house red wine where it was served in a very generous portion and my spouse had a Peroni beer which was excellent. My wine was $5 for 1/4 liter of the bottle. Peroni was $6 and generally is in a large beer bottle. We decided to order and share the Pasta alla vodka which was served PIPING hot and was excellent. Our only complaint is that we should've gotten our own plates because it was not enough to share as a dinner portion for two(but would be great as a sharing appetizer). It was too good, we scraped the sauce left on the plate up with the bread. So next time I am ordering that for myself.Then we ordered a sausage pizza. We didn't wait long at all and it also was served PIPIN hot and was delicious. We only ate half of it and our server happily boxed the rest up for us to take home. When we received our bill we were shocked. For two entrees and drinks (that we were beyond happy with) only came to be $34.01. Did I mention how difficult it is to find a place that serves great food until 1AM and we got there at 12:30AM? Plus they are open until 2. That's awesome. Plus, for two people drinking and ordering entrees in downtown Chicago on a Saturday night with great service and excellent food... Can't get better than Quartino's. We will be their new regulars."
"We loved this place! The atmosphere was quiet during lunch and the waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable. We tried 10 different dishes including dessert. The homemade pasta was amazing, it was a perfect texture. The sauce on the gnocchi was a little over powering but the gnocchi itself was perfect. You will easily find a dozen things on this menu that are perfect. I cannot wait to go back."
"After a long day exploring the city with my family local here to Chicago they suggested Quartinos. On arrival we were greeted by a fast valet service and then entered an old Italian hobbit home. Food flying every where lots of laughter and good company. The food was to die for and the service was simply amazing. I recommend this place to huge groups willing to share like a big family, do not come into this place with a closed mind or wanting your own plate.. It doesn't work like that. It is best to have an open mind and good attitude because by the end of the meal you will be full no matter what."
"DIdn't think the food was amazing and although they have reservations for large groups and a lot of space, didn't like the fact that they push to order more things to share. We had the pizza and I have had better pizzas. The only standout was the fried calamari."
Came here for a belated birthday dinner. It has been on my just for a while. I wasn't disappointed with the food. Service was good. We sat on the balcony on a broken tile. Every time a server walked by our whole table rattled. Very annoying. But overall a good experience. I would go back.
Came back for a large lunch reservation. Arrived here at noon on a Sunday and it was nice when it wasn't so packed and noisy. Service was very nice even though we were such a large group mixed with children. Still loved the tagliatelle bolognese! Also enjoyed the octopus very much (nice large pieces and great flavor). The four cheese pizza was good as well.
My second visit. Everything was delicious. I had the sun-dried tomato soup and pasta Bolognese. They were both hot and delicious. The service was friendly and fast but I never felt rushed. I think Quartinos is a gem and more people should try it.
The atmosphere was great. The staff is very attentive. The food is very authentic. The minestrone soup was great. The pizza was packed with toppings. The calamari was good as well. The tomato sauce with it was worth just drinking alone. I was surprised with how large the small plates were.
"People love Quartino so I'm not sure what else I can add...but I just wanted to document my own experiences so I remember what to order next time! Been here twice and both times by the time I left my tummy was very very heppy. Meatballs: I am normally a very anti-meatballs person. Mystery meat grinded and folded into a ball? No thanks! But at Quartino I've tried the veal meatballs twice and they are just amazing. Hashtag no regrets.Beef Carpaccio: Good but nothing amazingPorcini Risotto: Once again normally I'm not a risotto fan but I have to say this was pretty great. So risotto lovers, order away. Me, probably not. Parpadelle with braised short ribs: Oh dear god, what did I do to deserve this heavenly goodness? My first reaction after my first bite was ""god damn this tiny plate, I could eat a vat of this""Various other pasta dishes: amazing.Balsamic vinegar: Crack cocaine in liquid form. Our friend was eating bread, just to have more of their balsamic vinegar."
"Everything here from appetizers to drinks to dessert is nothing short of top notch. I've traveled to Italy and Sicily (and am also 100% Italian) and will say this place is pretty darn close to the authentic cuisine and culture. If you're looking for a fun place to dine with a nice atmosphere, superb food, and great service you must try this place. Continues to be one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago."
"Constrasting opinion about this restaurant: ranges from bad to very good.Veal Meatballs are original, not dry and tasty. Presented as mini-hamburgers with a crunchy bread. The pastas are absolutely a FAIL. They are swimming in a soup instead of a sauce. The taste is impossible to define: meat ? cheese ? tomato ? None is recognizable. The raviolis combine pork meat, sausage, cheese and others. Ingredients are not good, for instance the sausage is too hard. Moreover, the whole does not makes sense.Unlike, the pizza is really good. The crust is fine and crusty. The ingredients are fresh, it is not loaded with a ton of cheese. A few tomato, some basil and it rules !Prices are reasonnable. The room is big, a little bit noisy and the service moody. The waiter seems to have been choosen in the street."
"Food and service were great. When I went, they offered truffles as add-on to any dish. I opted to get gnocchi with the truffles and it was delicious. They didn't skimp on the truffles. Pizza was good too, as was the shaved salad. Ingredients were fresh. Location is great for people watching on a Saturday night."
"Taleggio cheese. That is all.(Can I really write a review that short? I feel like I would be cheating my audience. But if you do go and get the Salumeria tasting, make sure you get the proscuitto di parma, the taleggio cheese, and the giardiniera. The combination will blow your brain up. And the soprano pizza is one of the best pizzas ever (although my dough was a little undercooked) for those who like some heat. The veal meatball/sausage has great flavor and the giardiniera and peppers that accompany it pack a punch.As for the cheese, I'm pretty sure I'm just uncultured but that was the best cheese I've ever had. It's a little nutty but it's soft and milky at the same time. Thus ends my first review done almost entirely inside a parenthesis.)"
"This is probably the best Italian I have ever ever ever had in the States (and they're on Gayot's top ten Italian restaurants). House-made tagliatelle, pasta was perfectly al dente, the Italian sausage and tomato risotto and caprese salad were absolutely divine, and they have really authentic Bolognese - not just ground meat tossed in tomato sauce. Omg, I am in Italian heaven. I can't believe this didn't set me back $100 (check their menu, extremely reasonable prices, especially for this quality). I would fly back to Chicago just to eat there again."
"Hungry on a late night and demanding quality food? Come here! We needed to find a place to eat that was open late and wasn't McDonald's, and was happy to find this place. They've got a full bar, a comfortable atmosphere and great service.I'd recommend the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - it's thick and rich. And you cant go wrong with any of the pizzas."
"Really really good food. I got a salad and my friend is happy with her pasta. We split bread and had a good time. Be aware of their corporate event offerings, the food might not be that great, at least from my personal experience"
"Ambience: very cool. Loved it. Gives you a old school feel for Chicago. Food: looks much better than it tasted. Had a great menu but it was just okay for us. We had the bolognese, the veal meatballs and braised beef...they looked much more appetizing than they tasted. However, in all honesty, I've never had Chicago style Italian so maybe that's just the way it is! Overall...I'd still recommend trying it out for a great atmosphere and decent food."
"I travel to Chicago on a regular basis...this is always a requirement for me to eat here. Love the place, food is incredible and the bar/wait staff are very friendly and helpful.   While I don't live here i consider myself a regular. Have the Spare Rib...its the real deal."
"Very pleased with our first visit to Quartino.  Came here after reading several recommendations and looking for great Calamari. We were happy with our entireexperience from the bar service while waiting for our table and all through dinner.Celebrating a 9 y.o. birthday. Waiter offered several kid friendly suggestions including customizing a pasta and sauce in a half order. Yea! He went with the cavatelli with ricotta and enjoyed every bite!  We also had the salmon, minestrone soup, assorted olives, romaine hearts salad and each were excellent. Red Sangria was fairly priced and a perfect pairing.  Dark chocolate fondue with strawberries, a side of delicious vanilla ice cream and espresso to close out the meal.  Pizza's seemed to be quite popular with other dinners.  Very welcoming atmosphere and extensive outdoor dining. Looking forward to drinks and small plates on our next visit."
"Went here for date night last weekend and I'm a fan.  Word of caution, this place gets VERY busy so make reservations in advance!  We had to take the 5:30 dinner reservation because the restaurant was booked until after 9.  The restaurant serves small plates of their food which is perfect for sharing.  My wife and I tried Penne with Vodka sauce (it was perfect), ravioli filled with braised pork and Organic Veal Skirt Steak (amazing).  We stayed for dessert and had both the chocolate cake and banana with caramel and ice cream specials.  The restaurant is a bit cramped and the bathrooms are a haul upstairs which is why I had to knock out a star but otherwise, it was wonderful.  Also, the outdoor seating is first come, first serve basis."
I've only been here for the Sunday brunch buffet they have during the summer. $20 for the buffet plus various bottomless cocktails is the perfect way to spend the afternoon with girlfriends! I want to have dinner here some time so I will give it another star after that. :)
"Ugh, Quartino, why don't you deliver?  Jk, I know it's not that kind of pizza place, and Thank God.  If they delivered I would end up developing a full blown pizza addiction!  Chicago pizza at it's finest, do NOT miss this place."
"I went there with a group of business associates that had reserved a separate dining room. The food was really delicious, crispy thin pizzas and great pasta too. portions are meant to be shared. pricing seemed ok too. only downside was the size of the event room that was quite narrow so every time someone had to go to the restroom everybody had to get up. speaking of restroom: there is a dude in there that opens the faucet for you and hands you a towel....not really necessary and a little too much."
"Fantastic food, incredible service, and crazy busy, but that adds to its charm. Ordered Prusciutto, Bruschette, Shrimp, Eggplant Parm., and Fontina cheese...amazing! Coffee was equally good, rich and strong. Great wine selection as well with a variety of price ranges. The atmosphere of old Italy, was very charming."
"A really loud and popular place but we (inc. our kids) loved it.The pizza was a nice change from the Chicago deep dish ""pizza"". The brussell sprouts, pork shank, desserts and drinks were all delicious."
"Great service at the bar. Had an olive sampler, Asiago cheese, soup and a couple drinks and everything was delicious. Was hoping they would have an Italian aperitivo deal with a couple drinks with samplers but as far as I am concerned I haven't found a place that does this yet. Anyways, great place to be!"
"It can be loud when crowded but the authentic Italian cuisine is worth every bit of raising your voice a little to get heard. I have been here many times and it's delicious. The bread, the entrees, the wine. Rich and decadent dishes. Can get pricey but the servers are great and they know their menu. I would recommend the ribs or beef shank. Location is so easy to find and they are open late. Great for friends or date nights."
A gem of a restaurant in Chicago. Food and service was excellent. I had the ravioli and my wife had a custom penne pasts dish. We shared a house salad.
"I love this restaurant! Everytime, their food surprised me. This was Italian tapas place, so dishes are mean to be small and can be shared. Only pizza size is pig. We tried the claims pasta, mushroom risotto, a pork dish and a seafood platter and one dessert.The price was decent and the falvour was GREAT. There is nothing i can complain about. If you can get a patio seat on 2nd floor, you will love the expereince. It is just AWSOME!I will definately go back to this place."
Great food. They have amazing calamari although only cocktail sauce. Would be nice to have other suggestions. The orrechiette and the fettuccine are very delicious. If you like cold food the octopus is good though I'm not a fan my wife's family love.  The only reason I give this place a 4 is because it's extremely loud when it's busy and the tables are too small for the shareable foods they serve
"This was the second time I came to Quartino, the first time was just a sneak preview i tried a few of the small plates such as the dates wrapped in bacon which were pretty good.  Today my son and I had the margarita pizza, the carpaccio and caprese salad which were all equally good.  The crust on the pizza was great a slight salty taste and crispy.  will be back especially in the summer when so we can outside and people watch."
"I can't believe I went here.  IT's the most touristy place on the planet, not in a good way.  I think my boyfriend thought it'd be nice or something, so that's cute.  It's in the middle of that ed debevic's land, full of those people.  If there's an office party on the second floor where the bathrooms are, sexual assault might be an option for you.  The servers wear soccer (football) uniforms.  The food was passable, not inedible.  It's absolutely packed (packed) with families with shopping bags and bachelorette parties, and mommy's nights out with Cosmopolitans and breadsticks - you are suddenly transported to Schaumburg c. 1997 - if that feels good to you, you'll love it."
"I feel that Quartino's is good, but just a little overrated.  My wife likes it a lot.  It is a good place for chicks.  All the meals are pretty standard.  It is nice to try a bunch of different things and share tapas style."
"The sample plate and fondu were wonderful. Went as a group of 4 and shared everything, and were all super satisfied. Good service, cozy atmosphere, delicious breads!"
"We were looking for a family-friendly restaurant that took reservations so the kids wouldn't get hangry waiting 2+ hours for pizza at the usual tourist spots.  We also wanted good quality food (for foodie grownups, but stuff that the kids would still eat).  This fit the bill.  I wouldn't say it was the best food ever, but good enough.  There weren't many other kids in there, but we didn't feel too out of place.  The wine was my favorite; good, but not overpriced.  My biggest complaint and the reason I probably will never go back...the noise level was ridiculous.  I had to YELL to speak to my husband sitting right next to me.  I could not even converse with the kids across the table.  Our ears were ringing once we left.  I'm not a grumpy old codger...we can usually handle some noise and would even expect some on a busy Friday night, but it was out of control.  I was hoarse and losing my voice when we left."
"Good food. Good wine. Loud, but not TOO loud ambiance - call it lively. Good staff. Go."
Went here for a quick bite before heading to Vertigo Lounge down the street. Great place! Wine plates and Fondue were right on!! Tasty goodness.  Tables are a little too close and place can get noisy so not best for romantic evening but for a night out on town its perfect. Wait staff great.
"Saw a lot of great reviews for this place and decided to give it a go.  As mentioned in many reviews the place is very busy and very loud.  Probably a great atmosphere for a big group but for just two people we had to shout at each other to be heard.  The food was ok, nothing too great.  We had a margarita pizza, steak fillets and potato puree.  Being my first time there I asked the waiter what is good and he gave the standard, ""everything."" I asked him if he recommended anything and he just said, ""it is all great."" Not too helpful so we were on our own.  Later I had asked him about their potato puree and he described it as, ""its puree.  Not too hard to understand.""  Overall our waiter ruined the whole experience.  It was obvious they were busy and he made it clear that he wasn't going to give us much of his time.  Overall decent food but definitely be ready to not get much help from the staff.  Just my experience."
"We stopped by this place after visiting the museum of contemporary art. What a great choice for lunch! Decently priced and well-staffed, everything was amazing! I cannot rave ENOUGH about this place. Looking for italian food in the city? Forget about the tourist traps like Giordano's, come to Quartino!!!!!!!I could rave about the food but it would go on and on. The seafood stew was fantastic. So was the proscuitto wrapped dates drizzled in honey and stuffed with gorgonzola. The shrimp risotta was mouthwatering delicious.Lastly, fellow yelper Will P. was absolutely right. The tiramisu here is amazing. It's off the menu but absolutely delicious. Fluffy, soft, not too sweet, with a delicate tiramisu flavor. I love good, unpretentious food, and I felt Quartino was just that. If you're in Chicago, definitely come here! Amazing!"
"I absolutely love this place! I may be a newborn when it comes to Chicago (first restaurant I tried here), but I've had my fair share of restaurant's around the U.S. and this place gets a thumbs up from me.To get into details, the service here was very good when I came here.  The waiter and the kind lady serving the truffles were both great.  Their assortment of pizza is great and the quality of the food was definitely something to savor for days.  The establishment itself was very nice and classy, but has a sense of you can come here casually dressed with no problems.Summary: This is definitely a must-stop for tourist's visiting Chicago to try some quality pizza (not necessarily deep dish since I didn't see any in the menu).  Nonetheless, the food here is really good, the place looks nice, and the service is good.P.S.  The bathroom upstairs is kind of trippy lol. They use the old school powdered soap too and for some reason you can see into the opposite sexes bathroom too."
The meatballs were great! The service was good. Their pizza was ok. Would give it another try.
This place. I have been here at least 5 times over the last few years for many different occasions. The most recent was for a work event and we were in a private room. I could not recommend this enough to anyone that needs space for a group (we had about 30 people). The service was absolutely amazing!! They were so attentive and helpful throughout the evening! I've also been in a small group with friends and again the service was great! The food is also good too! I recommend the gnocchi! Yum! Prices are very reasonable too -- you can walk out of there spending $30-40 per person with drinks.
"Came here for a date on a Friday evening. We had to wait for our table a little, although we had made a reservation. When seated we were in the conservatory section on state, which is a pleasant area a little more secluded from the rest of the restaurant. However out table was quite small!The food was tasty and well done. I do not recall exactly what dish I had, but I do recall an excellent pasta sauce. Nothing to special in the other ingredients.To me the restaurant theme is a little confused- in places trying to be classy and in others more family style, such as the waiters wearing the colours of various Italian soccer teams, which sadly did not flatter the girth of our waiter.I certainly have to give praise for the service. Owing to the small size of the table my date left a small bag with a gift in on the floor, rather than the cramped table, which we both forgot when leaving. An hour or so after leaving I got a call on my cell. They has found the package and clearly then worked out that the table had a reservation and so looked up my phone number. They agreed to out the bag to one side for the next day. Simply fantastic!"
"This place can handle groups of any size. I once had a group of 20 people on my right and a man writing a paper on his laptop by himself to my left. However, I do recommend having a least 3 or 4 people in your party if you want to maximize the variety of dishes you get to try.Quartino is also remarkably accommodating of dietary restrictions. I once ate here with a party of 4 that included a vegetarian, and we were able to order items that left all of us satisfied. The apple chunks in the cheese fondue were a big hit. I've also gone here for a date with someone who couldn't have gluten, and they brought out a special menu to help us order. Happily, there were still enough menu items to fill one side of an 8.5"" x 11"" sheet of paper.Be sure to get some cheese and prosciutto!"
"Not sure what is up with their hostesses, but they are quite stuck up and rude - unbelievably rude. Fix that Quartino, as you surely have great food we like to enjoy!"
"Why I went: Lunch with mom in Downtown Chicago before heading back to school. Initially I wanted to go to Xoco but it was closed and when we decided on quartino it definitely hit the spotWhat I orderedBurrata with Beet Salad/Fresh Bread: I love burrata so I had to order this! It was better at Pizza Antica. I had to add more salt/pepper and olive oil to this burrata, but it still had had great texture. I also liked the difference in texture in the salad between the cubed beets and shaved beets. Half/Half Pizza: I LOVED that you could get Half and Half!I will preface this review by saying I am not an authority on pizza and maybe pizza connoisseurs might be up in arms about how this was not  traditional Neopolitan style pizza,. but I enjoyed it.The crust  was not blasted by the heat of the oven and completely charred. It was completely cooked through and had a nice crunch and slight chew. When I come back I will definitely order it again with different flavors.  Campania Fonduta, House Made Ricotta, Oven Roasted Cherry Tomatoes, & Hand Torn Basil - $12My Favorite of the two pizzas! The Housemade Ricotta had a nice luxurious texture and was delicious. I also loved the strong basil flavor. I would order this again!Prosciutto D'Anitra Onion, Duck Prosciutto, & Wild Arugula - $13I really like pizzas with Arugala. I love the flavor of Arugala and It really helps balance the inherent heaviness of pizza and lightens it up. . I however was not blown away by the duck prosciutto and there really was not enough to really get a sense of the flavor. Overall it was okay but not great and I will probably try another pizza in lieu of this one next time.Eggplant Parm: Mom ordered this and she really liked the strong basil flavor that was present all the way throughThe Good: Great Service /Solid Food/Lots of Variety on the MenuThe Bad: Far/Difficult to Park (Used 14$ Valet)/Cut to the Chase: 4 StarsUnexpected choice but Solid Italian food will definitely return if in the area"
"Reservations are a must for Quartino especially for weekends. We arrived at 6:15PM for our Friday 6:30PM reservations and the door was packed with a long line. Thank goodness for OpenTables! We were seated on the second floor by the windows overseeing the nightlights of State and Ontario. The restaurant has a very vintage touch with lights dimmed out and tables intimately aligned. The wait staff in white aprons was in and out of the dining hall bustling with orders. The food was oh-so-captivating that I fell in la-la-la-love! The three of us ordered the Neopolitan Pizze with prosciutto d'anitra onion, duck prosciutto, and wild argula. It was per our waiter's suggestion and by far, the best pizza I've ever had! The thin piece of tossed flour was spread with tomatoes, parmesan, and mozzarella. Pieces of delicately sliced duck prosciutto were scattered across and baked to perfection. If you like bacon, you would like duck prosciutto. The onions were there but barely noticeable. That's a plus for me! I usually try to avoid dishes drowned in onions. The wild arugula put the whole pizza in camouflage but they were very fresh and crisp! We also ordered the crisp calamari and linguini with clams, red chili, and red sauce. The calamari was seasoned with black pepper just the way I like it! It was superb when sprinkled in lemon juice and dipped in a side of marinara sauce. The linguini had a generous share of baby clams. The shreds of red chili were very welcoming and not a bit spicy. For three people, those entrees were more than enough and it was just shy of $45 with tax and gratuity. For a great location with authentic Italian food for a reasonable price, what more can one ask for?"
"Solid Italian tapas with a great selection of goodies. The pricing here is fair for downtown Chicago/tapas. I was pleased with the service and while the starting bread that was brought out was not the greatest, the food we ordered including: the Polenta Fries (half order, small portion), steamed clams (delicious, decent portion), and Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo (decent portion), were flavorful, served warm, and overall delightful. If you aren't terribly hunger but could go for a light meal full of flavor, this is the place to go."
"Silly us! We didn't make a reservation for a restaurant in downtown Chicago on a Saturday night, on a long weekend. So obviously, we were going to have to wait. On the recommendations of a friend (and a quick check on Yelp) we decided to try Quartino. We got in line to put our names down for a table, while our friend tried to scope out the bar area, where they do serve dinner and seating is first come first serve. The host said there would be a 45 minute wait. We put our names down and a couple of minutes later, scratched our name off because of a call we got from our friend, who had found a table in the bar area.  We settled in and ordered a pitcher of Sangria, which was very nice. After a lot of too and fro, we managed to decide on dinner. We ordered the Dates wrapped in Pancetta, the Braised Pork Shank, Duck Prosciutto, and the Spaghetti All' Arrabbiata ( spaghetti in spicy tomato sauce). I think the dates wrapped in pancetta and the braised pork shank, tied for Best Dish of the Evening; however, my husband says the braised pork shank was the out-and-out winner. The Pork shank was fall-of-the-bone tender and beautifully flavored, an absolute piece of perfection. The Dates were stuffed with Gorgonzola Dolce, wrapped in a nice salty pancetta and then drizzled with honey. They tasted like little bites of heaven. The Duck Prosciutto was accompanied by some Giardiniera (pickled vegetables) which were very tasty on their own, but completely over powered the prosciutto, in my opinion. The prosciutto was also, extremely tiny pieces, and definitely my least favorite dish of them all.  The Spaghetti was the last to come out, and a pretty big portion. It was flavored very nicely, with the perfect amount of zing to it, and the Parmesan they had on the table, complimented it well. For dessert we ordered the Zeppole, described on the menu as 'Hot Italian Doughnuts with Honey or Dark Chocolate'. When we ordered, I asked our waitress which would be better, the honey or the Dark chocolate, and she told us that she'd just bring out both. Boy! Am I glad she did. The dark chocolate was without doubt the table favorite, and got over before the last doughnut did, however, I really liked the hot doughnut with the honey as well. That said, if I had to choose, I'd go with the dark chocolate. My only complaint about Quartino was the announcements over the speakers. The hostess was using a mic to call out the names of people waiting for a table, but the announcements were so loud, that we could not hear anything else, and had to pause in our conversations every time she would announce a name and since this is a huge restaurant, with a fast turn over, the announcements were beings made every minute or so. I think Quartino should turn down the volume just a little bit, so that the announcements aren't jarring. That aside, I'd like to go back to Quartino every opportunity I get."
"My bf and I visited Chicago for our first time and this was our first meal there! I ordered the tortellini with Alfredo sauce, peas, and prosciutto. It was so good!!! The whole plate was covered with prosciutto around the outer edges. Very flavorful! I had a glass of sparkling wine along with my dinner. Service was real quick. No complaints! We were satisfied and full!"
"At a conference with hubby so eating on my own tonite. Wasn't sure where I would be comfortable. Sitting in the bar on a high top. Lots going on around me. Very relaxing. Staff very helpful.Started with half caprese salad. Delicious! Just enough for me. Lightly dressed and salty mozzarella! Shrimp risotto just right size. Sundried tomatoes, bits of zucchini and basil. Yummy bread to sop up the juices!Great relaxing place!"
"This place was recommend by my bf's good friend. We decided to give it a try and we weren't disappointed in the food and service. Ambiance was authentic, almost rusty yet romantic. I enjoyed my visit. The veal meatball sliders were delicious: tender and just the right size. The coleslaw side order tasted really unique but was good. Also, a little spicy. I ordered the bruschetta with egg plants and portobello mushrooms. Just yummy!The place was very crowded and it was a little hard to navigate. We got seated on the balcony, which had awesome views. It was chilly but they had outside heaters which really helped. Our server was very friendly and joked around. It made the experience even better.The bathroom wasn't very impressive because it was crowded and dingy and old-looking. There was a bathroom attendant who didn't do much. Girls with sparkly fancy dresses were hogging the mirrors and it was just a confusing mess.I would have given this place 5 stars if I wasn't disappointed in the bathroom.I'd definitely go back though. In fact, I decided to make a reservation to celebrate my bf's birthday, hoping to receive the same, nice service as the first time we were there."
"Italian food for people who think Olive Garden suffices ""in a pinch.""  None of the recipes taste homemade and the staff could easily double for the team at TGIF.   In a town renowned for Italian cuisine, go someplace else. I'm fairly confident the only draw here is the location.  2 stars because I didn't get sick."
Neat family style Italian restaurant for a moderate to large party. Generous portion sizes. Hard to go wrong. Recommended eatery.
"Stopped in here on a whim (and after a quick check of the Yelp rating) while walking around town looking for a place to eat while in town on business.  I was seated immediately, and the hostess was thoughtful enough to seat me a on the outside of the room, where I could people watch (again, by myself).  Service was excellent - props to the bus boys - from the get go.  I started off with the caprese salad: fresh tomatos, basil and excellent mozarella! There was plenty for 2 or even 3 people.  Next, I ordered the veal osso bucco. FYI - the other comments about this being an Italian tapas place is a great description, because none of the specialty dishes, like the osso bucco, come with sides.  But the osso bucco was so delicious that it didn't need any!! I ended with biscotti and coffee for dessert...again, way too much food for one person, but the staff is more than happy to box it up for you.  Appears that this is a popular place with locals, and I see why! There is a great atmopshere, and you could come here for a casual meet with friends or a romantic date; even by myself, I was perfectly comfortable.  I will definitely be back!"
"We had the anniversary dinner for the books at Quartino after stumbling upon it while perusing yelp. We walked in on a Saturday night to try our luck getting a table there. It was a two hour wait for a table inside but plenty of open seating on the outdoor patio. We elected for that but just as we talked to the hostess she told us there was a table upstairs on the heated balcony if we'd like that. Um hello yes please?! We sat down to drink in the delicious choices on the menu. We ended up with porcini mushroom and truffle risotto. I contemplated licking the plate if that paints a picture of how good it is. Then the pizza to end all pizzas. I cannot recommend the Soprano pizza more highly. Red chili sauce, veal meatballs, giardinera, mozzarella and basil. Beyond delightful and super adorable to boot. We will be back to Quartino."
"First off, this place has a great atmosphere. Everything felt very authentic and cozy, even though the restaurant is actually fairly large. The meals are served in a very traditional Italian way, with the twist of a tapas style family-meal. The food was great. We had the dates wrapped in Prosciutto, truffle risotto, beef medallions, and several other amazing dishes. Everything was cooked to perfection and extremely good."
"My cousin's bridal shower took place at Quartino, and they did a really beautiful job.  The decor was classy and understated, and the service was attentive.  Easy to get refills on wine!  We had a nice private space upstairs where we could mingle and open gifts, and several tables where we had our nice lunch.The meal was served family style, and I remember especially enjoying the spinach salad, the cavatelli with tomato/basil/ricotta, and the shrimp risotto.  There were lots of lovely little small/plates appetizers too.I wish I could remember more details, but I know that the food was fresh and well-prepared and served in a classy environment.  Would be great for any private dining event, and I'm sure for regular dinner too!"
"What a lively, fun place to eat! But be warned - it gets packed fast.The second time I went, I ordered take-out. The bartender, who took the order, was so incredibly kind as he walked me through the menu and shared customer favorites! While waiting for my large order, he encouraged me to have a seat, got me water, and also some bread with olive oil/sea salt to snack on while waiting. Because I was pretty hungry (I skipped breakfast - big mistake) he saw me devouring the complimentary bread and brought me more! Initially, I was afraid of being an inconvenience (and freaking him out from my bread-binge), but this guy made me feel welcomed. All while he helped others too!After sharing my love of bread with him, he even packed me a few extra helpings on the side of my takeout. Say what?! The highlights: - Prosciutto D'Anitra  (Duck Prosciutto, Onion, & Wild Arugula pizza)- Gnocchi Amazing service - highly recommend!!! When I'm in town again, I'll DEFINITELY visit!"
"Damn you Chicago! Why do you have such amazing food! I seriously wanted to continue ordering until I have tried everything on the menu. I love the way Quartino works! It's a small plates (tapas) style restaurant that serves Italian food. In the group of 4 of us who went for dinner, we order an anti-pasto platter, 6 small plates, lots of wine, and a few desserts. I feel like I needed to be wheeled out of here after our meal was done. The food was incredible and if they had something like this in Cincinnati, I would be BROKE from going so often!!I can't wait to go back to Chicago to eat there again!"
"Went to Chicago a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time! It would not have been a full trip without dining at some of the best spots in the city! We had lunch here and by the looks of all the reviews this place is very much liked! This was walking distance from the place we were staying at so no need to catch a taxi for this meal! Service was pretty good. The nice gentlemen informed us of the menu, made some great recommendations, and was very accommodating.  My favorite had to be tied between the oso bucco and the parpadelle with meat sauce. Loved it! The portions were perfect for two people. The flavor was overwhelming but I loved how it was packed in every bite I took. I surprisingly enjoyed their carpese salad. This was very refreshing. The fresh mozzarella was the star of course! I heard their pizza's here are pretty amazing. Another reason for me to take a trip back to Chicago soon!"
"Loved the veal meatball with raisins, and butternut squash and kale salad! I recommend ordering the Salumi and Cheese plates with a big group of people and trying some authentic Venetian Bellini or homemade Limoncello!"
"What a delightful place to nosh with friends! We visited for the first time last night and were beyond pleased with every aspect of our experience.  First, our server, Chris, and his trainee, Miguel, were extremely knowledgeable and personable, making our evening great fun.  The selections of food were wonderful and served in a paced fashion allowing us to enjoy each dish and ready for the next one. The ravioli was probably my favorite, but the roasted pork shank was nearly melt-in-your-mouth.  The desserts went beyond description and we all were overwhelmed by the Italian doughnuts served with honey, chocolate sauce, and at our server's recommendation, also Nutella for dipping. Unbelievable! What a great place! We will return again and again. Thank you also to the manager, Peter Norris, who personally visited our table and told us to call him before our next visit to ensure another great time to be prepared. You could eat anywhere in this great city but you will be glad once you add this to your favorites!"
"Came here with hubby and two friends during restaurant week. It was PACKED. The $33 for 4 courses shared amongst two people was an awesome deal. Wine was really reasonably priced, too, which made me happy. I always like a deal on a carafe!We had lots of food, favorites starred below:Veal Meatballs*Polenta*Burrata*GnocchiTortellini*Porcini & Truffle Risotto*Short Ribs*Profiteroles (dessert)Zeppole (dessert)One thing you must know about me is that I DIE for a good profiterole. They are my favorite and the one thing I will pass up tiramisu for. These were excellent, some of the best I have ever had.Service was prompt and polite, but our server was so busy because the restaurant was slammed that he didn't have any extra time to chat. When I was being indecisive about wine, however, he brought me three samples to try without being asked. That was a really nice touch.Overall, super awesome value and the food was great. I'm very happy with Quartino and I will definitely be back!"
"I adore tapas-style dinners. Small plates are perfect to be able to taste a variety of dishes and to share, because sharing is caring! (ha!) And you will most definitely want to share here. We had a caprese salad, the duck prosciutto, the clams and risotto and wine. Fabulous. I highly recommend it. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious.Food: 5/5Service: 5/5Location: 5/5 - We originally sat inside but it was so loud, luckily a table freed up outside and we were able to move out there."
"The best thing about Quartino are their $25 events with wine and appetizers. Registration opens a half hour before the event and they fill up quickly so get there early. Quartino is pretty reasonably priced - pizzas are big enough for two and run from $10-14, then other small plates or salads are right around $7-10 also. Reasonably priced wines too. Great for a cheaper group meal. It's centrally located in River North plus there is really nice sidewalk seating in the summer."
"This place was ok.  Nothing special, nothing really to bash - just sits right there in the middle.  Would go back if someone else really wanted to, but if I am choosing - I will pick another place I like more."
it is a must while downtown!
"I have been going to Quartino's now for YEARS. It is one of my 2 favorite restaurants in the city. So consistently great. The octopus and shrimp are so addictive- I crave them daily. Wine is priced so reasonably that I often have too much, AND the staff is phenomenal. I highly recommend it to anyone."
I wish I had ordered more stuff to try . Started with the duck prosciutto. No complaints! Ordered the linguine claim half plate with white sauce and now I'm regretting not ordering the full plate. T'was pretty goodThe dessert menu is extensive but it's really all sorts of gelato. Which is fair given this is an Italian joint but I'm disappointed that there's no tiramisu on that listI like how they have an in between area that's not quite patio but is considered indoors. So you can get seated without much wait and still get fresh air and view of the street for some people watching.
"Quartino is a very predictable italian restaurant with huge portions, friendly staff and excellent food. Great place to go with a group.  However, (there is always a drawback!) it is VERY loud as it is incredibly crowded every time I have been.  Definitely, not a place to have an intimate conversation.  Again, the staff, service and food is delicious."
Quartino 's quality and service is always consistently good!! I've been coming here for a few years.  Their calamari is the best I've had!  Eggplant paramasean is also delicious. I usually recommend it to family and friends.
"Really solid food. The spaghetti and meatballs were wonderful. Great selection and variety of dishes. Antipasto was spot on. Service was great even though it was crowded.The face that it was packed speaks to the quality of food, but if you are looking for somewhere to have a relaxing conversation this may not be the place.  Really great Italian in Spanish tapas style."
"I've been here once with my Co worker. It was a Friday night so the wait for a table was so long, fortunately there was a table by the bar. We ordered the calamari for app- best calamari I had.The Sangria was only $5 and it was sweet and fruity. It is Tapas/Small portion. Price is average. Def going back"
Only here visiting for two days and ate here twice. When you find the best why look elsewhere.
"I came here a few weeks ago on the recommendations of a few friends.   It was midday afternoon and the place was not too busy, so we were seated very quickly. The hostess and the staff were friendly, but the staff seemed to be huddled in the back of the restaurant chatting with each other, so it took some effort for the staff to notice us when we needed up. I am sure they are more attentive when they are busy, but it was a bit of a turn off during the meal. The food itself was very good. I had a nice glass of Chianti, steamed clams, veal Milanese and arugula salad. The meal was highly satisfying and I barely had enough room for the tiramisu (which was awesome). If you are in the area I highly recommend giving it a try."
"I lived in Italy for two years and love Italian food.  Food: 4 stars. Certainly passable fare, some better than others. The polenta with gorgonzola was very good.  The pasta was done al dente (rare in a restaurant) and was great stuff.  Definitely acceptable.The cheese selection was good.  I haven't eaten Taleggio cheese since I was last in Italy and they had it on the menu...it was there, and it was good stuff.  When I asked where they got it, and the manager brought me a card with an address of the distributor.  That is 5 star service.One of our dishes was ""late"" (by their standards)...we were fine.  They apologized and brought us an appetizer.  No reason for them to do that.  Again-- 5 star service.Downside?  Noisy?  It's a big restaurant. We went for lunch so it was a little quieter, and they have a great lunch special (3 plates for $25, enough for two).Anyway...I'd go there again, especially for lunch."
"Delicious organic tomato dish, authentic pizzas with the perfect dough taste, superfriendly service, affordable wine by the carafe, authentic old decor (even in the ladies restroom ) and a good ambience. Worth it!"
"Quartino is our favorite place to eat when we visit Chicago. It is a very popular restaurant and it gets loud at night, but it never feels overwhelming. The menu is diverse and affordable. Everything is designed to be shared so you can try several things over the course of one meal. Our favorites: the dates wrapped in pancetta are amazing. They have a rich, complex flavor. We get them every time. The polenta fries are great with the red pepper salsa on the side. The cavatelli is fresh and always delicious. The paparadelle al sugo di manzo is pasta with braised beef sauce. It's very rich and comforting, and the pasta is house made. Our favorite pizza is the quattro stagioni, filled with vegetables and topped with grana cheese.The desserts are all winners. Our favorite is the hot chocolate cake. WOW. The gran coppa quartino is a variety of gelato with hazelnuts, and there is also a dessert of donuts with dipping sauce. Both are incredible. You can't go wrong.If you plan to go at night, make reservations. If the weather is nice, consider dining outside along the sidewalk."
"This place is amazing! My boyfriend and I ate here 3 nights in a row during our weekend trip to the Chi. The food taste just like if you were in Italy. I love that you can do half orders, it allows you to order everything lol I wish this place was in LA"
"Went there with some of my friends and I really like the setting of the restaurant. It reminded me of some old-fashioned Italian restaurant back in the 70's. The food was amazing, we ordered 10 plates total for 5 people. The size was good enough not to get you stuffed, yet full. We also ordered two bottles of wine, the price was moderate with good quality.The waiter who served us that night was friendly and helpful, since it was my first time ever to a Italian tapas place; he was helping me with some dinning choice. Besides him, other people who brought the food over were nice and polite as well. I really have nothing to complain about this restaurant.Try the chocolate fondue for dessert, it is so good!"
"Meh, never been a Quartino fan - none of us really liked our pastas or pizzas but it's food and if we need to, we'll eat here, like on NYE when most other places are closed. The bianca pizza was too spicy, asparagus risotto really bland, my friend's pasta too cheesy. For tapas style, tables are tiny and hard to move around or share."
"Pretty close to as good as it gets.Timing is everything with this place.  I would gladly avoid going during the rush, it gets a little congested up front and they do pack you in there.  However, I am a HUGE fan of going either early-ish and sitting by the bar.  The food in phenomenal, tapas style is perfect to share over a bottle of wine or a couple beers.  Enjoyable atmosphere, couple tvs on opposite ends of the bar (these things are important to me people).  Reasonably priced.  Big fan."
"The dessert is to DIE for!!  Soo good.-it's very loud in there so be prepared for that. Although, you may not notice it as you relish over your amazing meal."
"I really wanted to like Quartino after everything I'd heard about it, but I was just really underwhelmed. I made a reservation for a Saturday lunch, and they seated us in a cramped corner near the bathroom. Starting with the ambiance - it was too loud, tables were packed too closely together, and service was just ok.Usually, if the food at a restaurant is amazing, I won't care that much about the mediocre ambiance and service. Sadly, it was not. We ordered the Bruschetta (came with 3 - 1 topped with Arugula, 1 Sicilian Eggplant, & 1 Portobello Mushroom), Fried Calamari, Mushroom Risotto, and Linguini with Clams. Of the 4 dishes, the only one that stood out was the risotto; the bruschetta and linguini were average, and the calamari was almost soggy, not crispy enough at all. Maybe my experience was average because I didn't order their ""signature"" dishes, but for a restaurant that has a consistent 4+ Yelp rating, I'd expect nothing on their menu to be less than satisfactory."
"Favorite higher-end but still family affordable Italian downtown.  Food is always fresh, with lots of handmade options, high quality, reasonably good service, and the price doesn't completely break the bank for a family of 4 or 5."
"I agree with some of the reviewers stating the food is not mind-blowing, but the food is indeed solid and the options you have here are mind-blowing.  You can go with a large group of friends and have a blast here.I was there with my daughter and we still managed to order a variety of food and manage to eat all.  We loved the fact that we could order small servings, which then allowed us to sample a variety.The server was excellent.The place is quite loud so would not be a romantic place but it is fun."
"Great food, wonderful service awesome experience. You can't go wrong."
"Was in need of a late night spot to grab some food and this was great. Friendly staff, good food, decent prices. I will definitely go back. The tiramisu was wonderful as well as the prosciutto wrapped dates."
"This place lives up to the hype. A couple of friends were in town this past weekend for a sailboat show down at Navy Pier, and they were looking for a good Saturday evening dinner spot. This place was absolutely packed to the rafters (mind you there are two floors and each floor has a lot of tables). Usually with big places, the service and food quality suffer a tad. There are just a lot of logistics involved in getting everything to line up for everyone. Quartino's apparently is as seasoned in the business management department as they are in the kitchen. Service wasn't the quickest, but it was also Saturday night and of myself and two dinner guests, none of us were ever wondering where the waiter went. I forget the server's name but he was knowledgeable on everything we asked him about (whether it be food or wine or even where some of their products come from). Having worked in the service industry for an extended minute or two, these things really make a difference. He was also friendly yet brief--he wasn't trying to schmooze us on anything and made great recommendations. Oh, yes, the food, I agree with some other reviews that the mushroom risotto was pretty average, but everything else was dynamite. Most notable was the Tuscan risotto, I believe. Italian doughnuts served with dark chocolate and honey for dessert was a great way to cap off the evening, in addition to some lemon-cello--though it may have been more bitter than the sweet I was hoping for. And last, price. Price was very reasonable for quality. We shared 5 plates, 1/2 liter good red wine, dessert and lemon-cello all for just south of $100. You couldn't ask for anything more--service, atmosphere (some may feel cramped, but it's European style!), food. I will be dining again."
Did I arrive on a bad night? This place was terrible. The service to the food.. bleh.. I don't think so. I think I came on the wrong night cause I've seen good reviews for this spot. Italian tapas. I came here late in the evening when we could only be seated at the bar. They had the menu and no one there with service being slow like a sloth. We ordered about 3 dishes just to try it out and everything came out tasting BAD! Beef tartare - Flavorless.. Why did I eat this?! Possibly the worst I've ever had.Tortellini - This was no good as well. Same with the no flavor. It had a lot of white sauce but tasted like nothing. It was disgusting. No one at the table would eat it. Beignets or donuts - Whatever this was it was cripsy on the inside.. dry as the dessert on the inside. Yuck... get me out of here..Maybe it was a bad chef that night.. who knows.. I just know it wasn't good for me.
"Quartino is a great place to meet for  dinner or drinks or just appetizers.  They have a terrific ""small plates"" menu.  I've eaten there at least three times.  The meatballs are fantastic, very moist and just the right size for small plates.  My only problem with it is there is wayyy too much bread. The bun was too thick and too big.  I propose that if one is going to serve meatballs as a ""small plate"" they should either bake or contract out a small bun where the proportions are more appropriate. The salads were wonderful.  They put the right amount of balsamic vinegar, good mozzarella, and sweet tomato.  If you go to Quartino, you must absolutely get the zeppole, the traditional Italian dessert usually on a ""St. Joseph Table"". For the heathen, Italians celebrate the Feast of St. Joseph on 19 March with great solemnity and they have a huge spread of foods, many unique to the feast, and zeppole is one of them!  They are chocolate perfection in a puff pastry.  I had my doubts they could pull it off, but Quartino did it perfectly.  The wine list is wonderfully diverse, with very affordable wines. The five of us polished off 4 bottles, along with pizza, meatballs, salad, and salmon and the bill came to only $160, not bad.  The pizzas are sincerely wonderful.  They top them with terrific ingredients like arugula which is wonderfully peppery, good olive oil, and a nice fire baked crust.Worth going, a good sturdy hang-out."
"This is one of my go-to restaurants in the city. There is something for everyone, even gluten-free folks. The food is delicious, half orders are available, and the wait staff have an extensive knowledge of cheese, meats, and alcohol pairings. always good!"
"Delicious! Quartino was our favorite eatery on our Chicago trip this past weekend. We had a reservation for 7 pm on a Saturday night and saw quite a few people waiting to be seated so a reservation is recommended. We shared the veal meatballs, shrimp risotto, and linguine with clams between the two of us.The veal meatballs lived up to the hype on Yelp. Tender, moist, flavorful... just everything that you envision in a perfect meatball. I don't know what the marinade is to create such tenderness but the meatballs just melt in your mouth!The shrimp risotto was the winner for us, however. There was such depth in its broth/sauce that rendered the dish to be both creamy but an intoxicating roasted and nutty flavor at the same time. The shrimp were furthermore cooked perfectly. Needless to say, we were talking about this dish for the next two days.We also shared a chocolate lava cake which seemed to have espresso as its base. A chocolate-lover's heaven and a perfect end to the delicious meal!"
Large plates of great food on reasonable price at nice neighborhood
"Not that Quartino needs another review . . . but just a few notes for future patrons.-- The interior of the restaurant is really cute, but it is very loud.  We were seated right in the middle, and while it gave us a chance to steal glances at all of the yummy looking food coming out, it was hard to hear each other.  There were lots of bachelorette parties on the night we came, so may be better suited to either request a certain table or come with a loud ready-to-party kind of group.-- Overwhelmed by the choices on the menu, we opted for the Salumeti platter and let the waiter choose which items to include.  I really enjoyed the meats and the eggplant, but nothing else really stood out to me.  If I go back, I would opt for other dishes besides this one.-- Definitely get the dates wrapped in prosciutto, but wouldn't recommend the beef carpaccio.  The carpaccio needed some sort of acid or something.  (The pizzas and pastas that the tables around us got looked really yummy!)-- Our server was great about explaining the concept of the restaurant and menu items.  Service in general seemed to be exceptional.  A man in a suit, who I am assuming was the manager or owner, stopped by the talk with several patrons who were obviously regulars and was even taking pictures with one man's children."
"One of the best things about visiting Chicago! The night we dined here, all the stars were in line. We got a beautiful window seat and somehow didn't have to deal with the usual long wait. Some of the best Italian food I've had.  Favorites: The Gnocchi, Beignets, meatball sliders and sampler dish of cured meats/olives and more."
"Outstanding. We had a graduation party and everything was excellent. Pizza, little plates, shared everything. Don't forget to try the grapefruit cello after."
"This place far exceeded our expectations. We enjoyed the ample outdoor seating. The wine list has a nice variety of good Italian wines. They are served in four sizes, ideal for sharing: 250ml, 500ml, 750ml (bottle), and 1000ml. The menu lists this as 1/4, 1/2, and 1 liter, and the bottle. There is no discount for the bottle, so just order what you want. They bring a carafe and small glasses. The 1/2 liter we ordered poured about 6 of those small glasses. Next time I will only order 1/4 liters--you can always repeat the same kind, but it would be fun to explore the list. Oh, they also have food!  The chef here really knows how to cook meat. The dishes are small and meant for sharing (why this place is listed in the tapas category). We tried the short rib and the veal oso bucco. Both were tender and savory. The carpaccio carpets the plate (we were actually wondering where the meat was until we realized that it WAS the pink--the plate was blanketed). The risotto was adequate. The server provided a gluten free menu. It even included one past dish (nice!). The outdoor area became quite loud, the street noise is always there, and then the tightly packed tables all raised their voices. Pretty soon we were all almost shouting. Fits the atmosphere of the waiters wearing football jerseys (that's futbol)"
Food was delicious! I loved the family style service and I think it is awesome that the food comes out as it's ready instead of waiting to be coursed. 5 star experience for sure
"This is my favorite place when I go to Chicago. Great atmosphere, really good and fun choices of food, always served by a great staff. I know most people spend a whole lot of time outlining every minute of the visit, but I have never been disappointed. And you have to try the Italian Donuts....Amazing with chocolate and honey dipping sauces and covered in powdered sugar. Be smart, get a half order for a small group..."
"On a recent trip to Chicago, my friend highly recommended this place, so we went here for dinner.  Quartino is known for its Italian small plates, so my friend and I sampled a few off the menu.We ordered the prosciutto di parma, white bean & garlic spread, fondue with bread and apples, cavatelli and some olives.Prosciutto di parma - At $7.50, this was a little overpriced.  We only got two slices of meat; however, the meat was high quality and fresh.Fondue - Although I can't say this was the absolute best fondue I've tasted, I did love the Italian Artisan Blend.  The fondue restaurants I've been to tend to not give enough cheese, but we had plenty.Cavatelli - My friend raved about this, so we ordered it.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was flavorful.  I hate when I order pasta at restaurants and the sauce is watery - not at Quartino.White bean & garlic spread - Yum!I would definitely go back here to try some of the other things on the menu.  Let me just say this place gets PACKED.  We went during the Memorial Day weekend, but my friend said this place is usually busy.  I would highly advise you to make reservations."
Fun ambiance and great prices!
"This is a great place, environment was really good. Food tasted great as well as Drinks. Very suitable for vegetarians, we have ordered lot of vegetarian dishes, eggplant parmesan was delish as well as polenta fries were superb. Highly  recommended."
"Have been to Quartino several times.  Most recently with my co-workers during a week-long training in Chicago.  Our group was looking for a lively night and good food... Quartino delivered on both.Food was excellent, great variety.  Wine selection is fantastic.  Service was top-notch."
"I came here last night in a group of 8 girls and we had a great time! Good wine and delicious food :) I loved the brodetta ai frutti de mare which was a generous size and full of seafood- clams, shrimp, octopus, and white fish. Although I think I ate enough bread for 10 people trying to get at all of the goodness in the bowl. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"
"Bomb Italian restaurant, family style & shared 5 dishes. The caprese was great & the penne al vodka was yummy. The service was great & very nice. Definitely check it out. #Bomb #chicago #delicious"
"I cannot say enough great things about this place. Between the great vibe, amazing dishes, and extremely reasonable price point, I'm not really sure what isn't to love. It has become a favorite of grabbing a couple of small plates and a bottle of wine at the bar. I typically don't sit at the bar to expect great service, but these guys a great and fun as well. Great job guys."
"To give Quartino anything less than 5 stars would be an atrocity! The ambiance and food made me feel as though I was back in Italy. We ordered the truffle salami and cheese to start, gnocchi and the shrimp with lemon and olive oil. All were amazing. This is a truly magical gem in Chicago. Must try!!"
We have been raising hands for minutes for paying the check which is not a pleasant experience
"It was our first night in Chicago and my husband and I were looking for a dinner location to kick off our first trip to the city. We had come from the Cubs game and being unsure of our plans we didn't have any reservations. They were full for reservations but we walked over to give it a try anyways and lucked out and found two seats right at the bar.Zakariah, their sommelier and bar manager, served us and was fabulous. I can be a little wine picky and he was really patient while I indulged a bit of high maintenance and tried four wines before making up my mind of what we decided to go with. Zakariah was wonderful and gave us two dishes that were sent to the bar by accident - a sausage pizza and a tortellini plate. Both were good so we felt comfortable asking him to order whatever he would recommend for us. He selected the burrata, a cured duck dish and delicious grilled octopus.Everything was delicious and when the bill came it was an unbelievable value! Honestly, I have never had a meal of this quality at this price. Huge kudos to Zakariah and Quartino all the way around!"
"Went to Quartino after reading a ton of yelp reviews and hoping that I could have a great experience (and defy the bad reviews on yelp). Sadly, my experience wasn't that great! The ambiance in the restaurant is casual and the noise level is pretty loud so be prepared to yell across the table. Our server was very amiable and attentive to our requests.However, the food here was quite a disappointment. We ordered:1.) Margherita Pizza - felt like I was eating cardboard with no flavor, the crust was somewhat undercooked, despite being thin crust!2.) Beef Short ribs - very tender, probably the best dish we had. Had a weird green puree on top of it3.) Crispy calamari - the batter used here was tasteless but the dish was served hot4.) Porcini and Truffle risotto - no presentation, was very thick and chewy (risotto)5.) Shrimp in Garlic, olive oil - came out a little cold and was slightly rubbery in textureOverall, a very subpar dining experience but good ambience and very busy on a weeknight! We went to Xoco for dessert after and thought the churros with dipping chocolate there was the highlight of our entire dinner experience!"
"Arrived at 12:45 and was still able to order from the full menu. I had a shaved Spring vegetable salad that was beautifully fresh and very gently seasoned so that the vegetables can shine.Also had a bowl of linguine with clams in white sauce, which came out very hot, with pasta still firm and an abundance of small fresh clams. Paired it with a quarter-liter of 2008 Rosso di Montalcino. Fantastic late night meal for $37."
What a lovely tapas place this is.  The mushroom risotto and roasted beets were simply wonderful.  Decibel level was high but food and service outstanding.
"My friend and I came here for dinner around 5:45 on a Friday night, and the restaurant was bustling but not packed, which was nice. I actually made our reservation on Yelp and we were seated immediately. Our server was super friendly and explained everything to us patiently. What I like about Quartino is that they do half plates on many of their main plates, so we were able to try 2 or 3 different dishes each without feeling too full or paying a lot. We split a plate of bruschette which I found to be different in taste and more artistically plated than I've seen at other places. It was good but messy (the bread was too big to be bite-size, and biting made the toppings fall off). I ordered the Crisp Calamari and the Tortellini pasta (half order). The tortellini was amazing but unfortunately I am newly lactose intolerant so I had to get the half order (my stomach still voiced its displeasure after my meal). I think my friend ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana and then tasted the Giardiniera Romana, which was actually pretty good for being pickled vegetables (our server was kind enough to get her a tiny plate of that because it was too small to begin with to make it a half plate and my friend didn't want to order it fully in case she didn't like it). Our total for the TWO of us came out to be about $25. That was a pleasant surprise. Definitely will be coming back here to try out their other dishes!"
Easily one of my favorites in the city. Quartino never disappoints and the food is DELICIOUS. They have a huge selection of both food and wine. Definitely a go to for a night out or to take guests to when visiting the city!
"Always packed so make sure you have a reservation. I've never been impressed with the wine but the food is unbelievable. The braised short rib is fantastic. Shrimp risotto, shrimp, bruschetta are all good choices. It is tapas style so you need to order many plates. It also comes out when it's ready, so just be prepared. The hot chocolate cake and fondue are also great. NOT good for kids. It's a bit loud and can be cramped. My boyfriend is 6' 3"" and they were willing to move us out of a corner to make him more comfortable. And the service is wonderful."
"I was staying in a hotel not far from Quartino's on a recent trip to Chicago when one night I got hungry. It was after midnight, I'm vegan, and the hotel I stayed at had nothing vegan on the room service menu (well, they had French Fries, but that was it).Thanks to the wonder that is Yelp, my husband and I discovered that nearby Quartino's was open until 2 AM and had a few vegan items on the menu. The person managing the restaurant that night was very kind and let me place a pick up order even though that wasn't their policy at that hour. We picked it up and had the following:Artichokes Capobasso -- this was a tiny portion of cold, vinegary artichokes. For $5 I would not get it again.Marinara Pizza -- Not bad, and pretty sizable so a good value at $8, if you don't mind a cheeseless pizza. Since we're vegan, we didn't mind at all.Scarola e Fagiol (Braised Escarole with Cannellini Beans)  -- taste wise this was just okay, but I wanted veggies, and the portion was sizable -- at $4.25 a much better value than the artichokes. In fact there was so much of it that we only ate about half.There may be better items on the Quartino's menu for all I know. The food we had was fine, but not such that I would go out of my way to eat there. I'm glad there are some vegan options available around the Magnificent Mile after midnight, though!"
"Stopped here with a few colleagues on a Friday night. It was extremely busy, which was to be expected. The wait was a little long, especially considering that we had reservations. Once we were seated, we had a great time. Our waiter was helpful and explained to us that the plates were meant to be shared, and so they would be larger than a normal main dish. We shared a bottle of wine, and didn't have to wait long at all for our food.The Margherita Pizza was good, but the best thing we had was the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo (Tuscan Pasta Ribbons with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce)! The braised beef was absolutely delicious. We were just about done with our meal when another waiter delivered an order of Polenta Fries to another table and we all watched the little beauties pass us with our mouths salivating. We asked our waiter if we could add an order of the polenta fries and he said it wouldn't be a problem. They were definitely yummy, but I'd still take the braised beef pasta over the fries! Overall, it was a fun time with friends and I would recommend this place for a casual, friendly night out."
"This is probably the best value for your money in River North. Quartino looks touristy from the outside, but it is not, even though a lot of tourists go there. It's authentic Italian food that is very very good and very reasonably priced. Atmosphere is great too. Order the house wine. It's cheap and tasty!"
"Really enjoyed a dinner here.Busy and fun crowdService is good.Italaian tapa style that are meant to share with people in your table.Loved their argula salad pizzas.Compare to NYC Italaian place, this is definately a good place to go.Yes, I am a fan of this place. Make sure you make a reservation in advance."
"This place is perfect. We got to sit in their adorable outside wrap around patio area. They have extensive gluten free options and they are all delicious. (Or those that I've had.) We got the Salumeria tasting. Perfect for two people. You get two choices of cheese and meat and three choices of salad. From there we ordered more of one of the salads and a couple more dishes. The grilled octopus is amazing. The espresso martinis are sweet and not milky like those I've been used to. They are Devine. The red Sangria is not too sweet, which I did not mind. at. all. It was not overwhelming to have along with the meats and cheeses. The service is great. They were observant without being obnoxious and constantly questioning. Siera was our wonderful server. We sat for hours drinking and eating. It was a great experience. I will most definitely come back on my next visit to Chicago."
"Loud, overpriced with a zoo-like atmosphere.  Our server was good, the majority of the food was just okay with the exception of the veal and the pork shank.  The best part was blowing the powdered sugar from the zeppoles onto my friends."
"This place is totally over hyped. I went here for dinner while visiting Chicago with my fiancé and my mom. My fiancé is from Naples, Italy and we wanted to find an authentic Italian restaurant. The reviews here looked good and the menu looked ""authentic"". We didn't order the pizza, so maybe that was better. I really don't like this style of dining where the food comes out in random order. It's not like that in Italy, why is it done here? Anyway, I had the tomato soup, it was OK. It needed some more flavor. I also had the ""stracci"" pasta with broccoli rabe and tomatoes. It was rather tasteless. My mom had the baby spinach salad, it was dressed with too much lemon. She looked her grilled shrimp and my fiancé like the seafood ""brodotto"". Dessert was not good. We ordered the zeppole and sorbet fantasia. Sorbet was tasteless and the zeppole were nothing special."
"Quartino is the go-to restaurant for my husband and me: we go here about once a month. The food is always delicious.  We recently traveled in Italy for nearly two weeks, and we felt that the food at Quartino was generally better than ""real"" Italian food. We always get a selection of meats and cheeses (parmigiano reggiano and prosciutto di parma are favorites).  The calamari is delicious. Our pasta favorites are the tagliatelle alla bolognese and the pappardelle al sugo di manzo.  Both are very flavorful and have a good mix of meat, sauce, and pasta. My husband loves the roasted baby octopus and we get it fairly often, but this dish tastes a little off to me every time. The desserts are delicious, especially the donuts with the dipping sauce.My one complaint about the food is that a very good bone marrow dish, which was on the menu after it was revamped about a year ago, was taken off a while ago and has never been back.  I wish Quartino would bring back the bone marrow, as it was very good. Maybe if people ask for it, they'll put it back. Quartino's prices are quite reasonable: we almost always spend less here than we do at other River North spots. Reservations are a must (often a week or so in advance for weekend) as the restaurant is always crazy busy. Without a reservation, you're looking at a wait of at least an hour on the weekends.  It's also very loud  (although we generally manage to hold a conversation).  Quartino seems to attract a lot of bachelorette parties, which adds to the noise level.  I normally hate noisy restaurants, but my love for the food outweighs any noise-related concerns."
Came here for restaurant week..had a reservation for 730..checked in early and sat at the bar waiting for the rest of our party..cocktails were good..rest of party arrived at 750..table was ready immediately. .glad they didn't give it away even though people were standing waiting to be seated..food was pretty amazing. .I wasn't disappointed with anything our server recommended. .from the risotto to the braised pork shank and caprese..desserts were even better.  I'll definitely be back
"I have never been disappointed with Quartino; I always leave glad that I came.  It is generally very busy in the evening, and tends to be on the louder side; lunch is quieter.    The food is unique and the menu is extensive.  I am generally wary of places with a large menu, but Quartino has figured out how to manage a wide variety of food while still producing fresh and tasty dishes.  Some of the pastas are hand made (they are indicated on the menu).  I enjoy the smaller portions and being able to sample several dishes.  We have not had anything yet that we did not enjoy.  We do particularly love the pizzas, the osso bucco, the penne a la vodka, the fettucine alfredo, and the hot chocolate cake for desert, and, of course, the wine.  The grano padano cheese grater on the table is a wonderful touch.The ambience and the décor are great.  Quartino is one of a kind, which adds to the experience."
Yum!!! Just finished having early dinner on the balcony! Perfect day for it! We started with the arugula and mandarin salad really good. Small portion. And we also got the vegetarian pizza very tasty! Good size portion! The cauliflower w salsa verde was disappointing though :( the tiramisu and cannoli were delicious!! Overall great food soooo many options and affordable! Waiter was really nice and helpful! So that's a plus!
"Amazing place! Really good value. The pizzas are very good for 12-15$, and good size. Things are to share, and they come out of the kitchen whenever they are ready, which was fun. Wine selection is ok and for a reasonable price. We had a quattro staggioni pizza, an asparagus risotto (tasted very nice to asparagus), bean spread (very big for 5$), calamari (the best ones I've had in the US), and ravioli (they tasted very good, but very small plate).The hot chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream was awesome!"
"Quartino is a great restaurant for groups and it also can be a romantic place for two.  There are many selections to choose from, and the tallegio cheese is wonderful.  The pizza also is pretty good, though pasta probably would be my first choice."
"Quartino is mediocre. The service was lackluster, but sufficient. The food was not bad nor anything to rave about. Granted the price is reasonable, but then again, you get what you pay for. Overall a good place to take a group if you don't want to break the bank, but don't expect to be wowed by the food. Except the short rib, that was actually amazing."
"Cheap wine and great sharing plates.  I think it's kind of weird that they make all of the waiters wear Italian soccer jerseys - in my opinion it doesn't really go with the fancy, Italian, tapas theme they have going on.  Regardless, we ordered the dates, truffle risotto, penne, and salmon and I have no complaints.  And they have the coveted espresso martini - a great after dinner snack!"
"Wonderful atmosphere, great food.  You can't go wrong having a romantic, slow-paced meal here."
My boyfriend and I have gone there multiple times.....It has never failed us! The food is just fantastic and so vegetarian friendly.  The staff made suggestions to us.  You can even order half pasta dishes so you can always try more.  The best pasta dish to try is the penne a la vodka.  I would not go here for a quiet dinner because it is LOUD.  We have even been here in the winter time and they have outdoor seating with heat - which still made it so comfortable.  FYI - gnocchi has some kind of meat in it or meat broth...if you are a vegetarian.
"If you ever have an issue here, the staff will absolutely take care of you. They are amazing! The manager, Adam, and our waitress, Alessandra, were amazing and truly turned our experience around. We are from Los Angeles and just happened upon Quartino. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice Italian restaurant. In addition to out of this world service, the food was incredible!"
"I love me some family style Italian tapas! After discovering the beauty of $15 gdine meals, I've invited my girlfriends twice for a Quartino endeavor.$15/person got us a 5-course feast with our choice from sputini, salumi, formaggi, pizze, and pasta/risi. The Good- substituting extra formaggi for the salumi since we weren't feeling any of the meats- the side of apricot puree that came with our sputini-n-salumi dish- half and half pizza- ravioli or the penne alla vodkaThe Bad- the sputini is a bit on the lackluster side. If you must, then get the roasted peppers  - none of the pizzas I've had (campania, veal meatball, marinara, and pear-gorgonzola) really stood out. The Ugly-The food coma which commenced shortly after the third course of our meal."
"This was a pretty cool place. When we went it was very full and LOUD. If you want a nice, quiet place to have a deep conversation, this might not be the right place (which was ironic to see two girls who were not ordering anything to just sit and talk for over an hour in such a loud place). But I digress. The food was pretty good! It was the kind of place where there were no entrees, so you were meant to order many items on the menu if you want to be full. Most of the items we got were pretty ordinary, but I did try the Duck Prosciutto and Smoke Ribs, which were awesome! I would definitely add those to your order!Service was a little bit slow, but it was very busy when we went so it's a little understandable. But there were lots of attractive people to look at while you wait. :)"
"We came here after a 6 hour bus ride from Detroit to Chicago. We had reservations for like 930 or 10. I don't think it was needed since it was so late. First thing I noticed was how freaking loud it was here. We were sitting pretty close together and I still could barely hear. The food came out quickly though: Roasted Baby Octopus - This had the potential of 5 stars but unfortunately for some parts of it I felt like I was eating cancer (char) and the veggies were too salty. Vegetarina Asparagus, Cauliflower, Zucchini, Eggplant, & Wild Arugula - $12 : It was basically a pizza with a wild arugula salad on top. More like two separate dishes in one. Gnocchi Potato Dumplings, Green Beans, Potatoes, Arugula Pesto, & Pork Stock - $10.75: I was surprised I liked it but I probably won't order this again. So we were pretty tired so we just wanted to head back to our hotel and sleep. Our waiter was chatting up with this table for 10 minutes before we were able to get his attention to get the check. Same thing when we signed our cards. Considering how Chicago has so many great restaurants I don't think I will be coming back."
"As a newly transformed carnivore to herbivore, I thought this place might have a lot to offer my new vegetarian tastebuds.  I was wrong.  Most of the food we ordered was flavorless and either under salted or over salted.  This includes the broccoli rabe, mushroom risotto, gnocchi, and the white bean garlic spread.  We were also delivered the wrong gnocchi.    The cheese plates were good - the parmigiano reggiano was nice and salty, and the acadamia barilla was also good.  Unfortunately, all of the food was delivered around the same time.  The good thing about this place is it's reasonably priced and we were able to make a reservation the night of."
great food and ambience (a little noisy though).
"Not as good as I expected based on Yelp reviews. We got the Neopolitan pizza with sausage, fennel, onions and diced tomatoies and it was just OK. We also tried the dates wrapped in pancetta, but the gorgonzola cheese inside was over the top (and not in a good way - too many flavors trying to overwhelm each other). Our final dish, the broccoli rabe, was totally bland and needed salt. On the plus side, service was quick and attentive.In summary, everything was so-so and not memorable. On to the next."
good service. You can order everything for half size and try different dishes as many as you can. The kale salad with squash is yummy. I ordered the half size prosciutto pizza and tasted good.. Grilled octopus also tasted good.
"I have to say, for the reviews, I was expecting more. Service was OK. Food was good, but not for the hype. Sad day."
"I visit Quartino whenever I get a chance and I'm never left disappointed! Never too long of a wait, even without reservations and staff is very nice. There's a cute outdoor patio and balcony seating. I usually come for late night bites or for dinner and each time I have to get the fried calamari because it is always on point. Crispy, light, tender...best calamari I've had so far! In fact, whenever the boyfriend and I are craving calamari, this is the only place we go because we know for certain that we'll love it. I also like their pastas and small meat and cheese plates. I've been meaning to try dessert but always end up too full for it. That's a must for our next visit!"
"This place might be my favorite italian place of ALL time...and I think that says a LOT. This was dinner on Day 1 in Chicago and it set the bar so incredibly high!I made a reservation here about a month and a half in advance. I'm not sure if all the lead time was necessary, but I wouldn't leave it up to chance if you're going to be in the area!!We ordered:1. The Veal Meatballs - We started with the veal meatballs that my bestie had researched. They came out all deformed and not spherical so you KNOW they were handmade :). Hehe, they came with plump raisins which were a perfect blend of the savory and sweet that i love so much. I usually don't like raisins that much, but this combination was so amazing you just have to have the raisins with the meat. It was like cranberry and turkey..but 50x better!2. Cavatelli - Handmade pasta with fresh ricotta, basil, and tomato sauce! Holy oh-my-frickin' -goodness...this was my favorite dish of the night..the favoritest of all favorites!! The tomato sauce was so fresh and flavorful, the pasta was the perfect chewy texture, the ricotta was so light and fluffy..and most importantly, the basil wasn't overpowering! eek, droooolllll...3. Braised Beef - The braised beef here was still tasty even though I was busting at the seams by this point. The beef was perfectly cooked..not dry or tough, just melt in your mouth pieces that just falls apart just a gentle jab with your fork..sigh.4. Zeppoles - And of COURSE, we had to have dessert! My bestie was alllllllllll about this dessert from the time we sat down. Want the classiest donut ever? Yeah, this is it...perfectly fried pieces of dough with a piping hot dark chocolate sauce...this was definitely a perfected dish with the artfully mastered crunch to the dough and the not-too-sweet and not-too-thick chocolate sauce...mehhhh, send me back to Chicago now!!"
"Loved this place - went their to start off a bachelorette party.  It was a perfect spot for a large group.  The restaurant was packed... but the service was fast and very attentive!Food - great variety and flavor!  The portions were perfect for sharing, too.  I've been to tapas restaurants before, and at best you could share an extremely tiny place with only 2 people.  These are large enough where several people can enjoy them.Price - amazing value!  The tapas are priced perfectly... and the wine by the liter is amazing!  You won't break the bank here.Atmosphere - It's definitely an upbeat, fun, loud place to go.  If you're looking for something quiet and romantic - this isn't your spot.  Service - fast and attentive! This place is perfect for groups!  You won't sit around long waiting for drinks or your food.  A must go!"
Yum! Went here with some friends. This place is very comfortable and reasonably priced. You must get the meat and cheese board!
"I went to Quartino recently with a few colleagues. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a more formal work lunch (it's shared plates), as a general matter I heartily recommend it.  The food was very good, and the service was excellent.We ordered the ricotta and white bean spreads, spinach and caprese salads, olives and gnocchi.  Everything was fresh and much larger than expected.  I particularly enjoyed teh gnocchi, was was in an arugla pesto with green beans.  Different, but very good."
"Eat here, you'll love it! Make reservations, or face an hour or more wait. Definitely get the Zeppole!!"
"This was not my first experience at Quartino! I took my friend here for her birthday and enjoyed a beautiful day outside while munching on Italian Tapas! We started out with the Grapefruitcello Martinis - so good! We then proceeded to devour the following: dates wrapped in pancetta (a must!); linguide with clams in red sauce (very good); crisp calamari (also very good); along with my favorite: a platter of giardiniera romana, soppressata, and taleggio! Mmm... can't wait to return soon!"
"I don't understand the hype - got a pizza, salad and calamari with a friend the other day and all were sub-par.  Maybe I just chose the wrong things, but they all seemed good on paper! Disappointed, there are significantly more delicious places in Chicago for the same price. I would chose elsewhere."
This is my go-to place downtown for cheap eats and wine for the last 10 years or so. The thin pizzas here are delicious and the wine is super affordable. It is a great cheap date place. The only problem I have is that the acoustics in here make everyone's voices seem super loud so it is very hard to carry on an inside-voice conversation. If you're looking not to spend a lot of money on some good food and not really care what your dinner or lunch companions are saying then this is the place. Five stars if it was a little more conversation friendly. Food and wine are great :)
We had an awesome experience!! Went with a group of 8 including a toddler and the server was amazing. She recommended some great dishes that we could share and she was spot on. My favorite was the pizza (I'm simple) and my husbands fave was the tortellini and prosciutto dish. The desserts were AMAZING - get the donuts!!
"I seldom give out five stars on a first visit, but the dining experience here exceeded expectations.  We had a large group (7) and this seemed to work well with the small plate menu.  Several great antipasti - get the combination of olives, salamis, and cheese to start.  The burata was amazing.  The parmesan crusted chicken was great.  So was the shrimp risotto.  The Short rib was tender enough to fall off the bone.  Remember, the plates come not at once, but as they are completed in the kitchen, so they are coming out fresh.  You also need to be able to share with those at your table.  Nice drink and wine menu.  Great desserts.  Service was first rate.  Overall, great experience and I would come back for more."
"Reasonably priced, nice hustling and bustling ambiance.I thought their mushroom risotto was excellent but aside from that I cannot say I was impressed.  The braised ribs was also nicely flavored but it came out lukewarm hence I felt the filmy feeling from the fat.  We also ordered the duck prosciutto cold cut, it was good but not spectacular.  A good place to chill and people watch.  For Chicago, it was quite tight so get ready to hear your neighbor's conversation."
"I always enjoy Quartino, but it's been so long since I've been there, that I figured I'd update my review after a recent visit. As usual, the place was hopping - even at 9pm on a Saturday. Thankfully, a reservation here does wonders, and we were immediately seated. Service was a bit slower than normal, but they were so packed, it's understandable.  We had the lamb meatball sliders (fantastic!), pancetta wrapped dates (delicious), and a margherita pizza (wonderful and fresh).Food - 5Service - 4Value - 5!!Atmosphere - 5Bathrooms - 4 (no offense to the very friendly attendant but I simply can't get my head around why this is necessary!)"
"Solid choice. I had booked a special event two years ago.... And based on that great experience returned while on town. Sampled their rose wine... With olives, fresh pasta and a pizza. Food was fresh and delicious. Service was also terrific, we were able to sit in the sunroom area... Was too cold to be outdoors. The only thing I disliked was the closeness of 6top tables to two top tables. We had some obnoxious lady in a large party next to us."
"They have really good food, drinks, desserts and their service is very fast even if they are fully booked. The pizzas are way better than their pasta dishes. If you're in the river north area and you want to eat Chicago-style pizza, you have to eat here."
"We got back from our honeymoon in Italy less than three months ago and Quartino was the first Italian meal I've had since then that really made me feel like I was back in Italy. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, delicious and satisfying. The patio seating with people scurrying on the street below really does make Quartino feel like you're back in Italy. Well, except for everyone speaking English. This was one of the best Italian meals I've ever had -- in Italy or otherwise."
"A-FREAKING-MAZING!!! everything here is delicious. a friend took me here one day for dinner and I fell in love. After taking my boyfriend less than a week later for a lunch date, it is now one of our favorite places in the city!! I can't wait until my parents come up to visit and I get to take them here! Calamari is on point. Veal is probably the most mouth-wattering delicious gift from god that has ever graced my palate.  SO GOOD. EAT ALL THE FOODS!"
"Dined here twice last week.  Great place for a group.  Italian small plates, great idea.  The sharing really gets the food conversation rolling.  Not a place for a quiet evening.Some dishes were excellent specifically the calamari, veal meatballs, oso buco, veal Milanese.  The mushroom risotto was dull and the raviolis were also a miss.The service is excellent."
"Very crowded, a reservation must, a great crowd, type of place. VERY BUSY. We made reservations for 5 a week ahead for a Saturday night 7:00 P.M. and got seated at 7:30 P.M. Bar was too crowded to catch a drink and I'm sure they serve full service on first come first serve seating there, but there was hardly any moving space. I love how we could share everything. We started with two bottles of wine at the table that were listed as specials for 20 dollars each. We were offered to taste and we all drank out of regular style drink ware sets (they did not provide wine glasses). Food, however, did come quickly! Which is always a plus and bread was served fresh and they brought in more complimentary. Here is what we had and everything was delicious:-Veal Meatball Slider (one per person) for 2.25. Veal was excellent, no sauce was on it so that's  why it was not my favorite. It did come in a huge roll (which most of us didn't eat) because that's too filling. -Romaine Hearts Salad, for 6.75, fresh, delicious, a great way to start the meal-We ordered many pasta dishes and they were all graciously served but my favorite was Cavatelli. That is what I would order If I went back.We were too full for dessert but the menu for it looked good. My girl friend is having 20 girls here for her birthday in April. I know they take large group reservations which is perfect because this would be a great way to save money on food with small dishes and for everyone's food tastes. I like RPM better. I know reservations can be a pain to get there but everything from the appetizers to pasta to the drinks are amazing."
"This place is my go-to spot when I need a large group reservation and FAST. They have an enormous space, so it's not too difficult getting a reservation the week before. The food is somewhat average, it depends what you order really. But my favorites are the gnocci, pappardelle, and cavatelli. They are usually the table's favorites, so it's a must order every time.Their seafood is actually pretty fresh and really delicious too. The best thing is that this is all tapas, so I get to try a little bit of everything each time. Also, they have a selection of 1-2 bottles of Red/White that are only $20, so everyone gets pretty ...happy... by the end of the meal!I am hosting a birthday party here next month for 20 people, so I wonder how service will be because it was a little on the slow side the last few times I came. All in all, a great place for big crowds!"
"This is a tough review! We were in and out in one hour. The food was good not great, the bread and olive oil were good not great! I feel like I've seen this type of restaurant, decor and style way to many times to still find a high level of appreciation.Great location! I'll try it again because it was good and convenient."
"Just like the restaurant description says..... ""Italian Tapas""Super chill and mellow vibe with the friendly Italian welcome!Lanny was our server and he was very helpful and friendly! He gave us suggestions and answered any and all of our questions! Always checked in with us and provided superb service! The Manager (i think) also stopped by to check on us as well...(thats always a bonus in my book!)On to the fooooood!!!Did the Lunch special (3 choices of plates for $25)- Veal Meatball Sliders: TASTY!!!!- Linguini with Clams: Buttery and tasty!- Fried Calamari: Crispy and not wimpy calamari!***The portions are very generous...so come with your appetite!!!- Also paired it with Pinot grigio/Pinot blanco blend....went perfect together!!!Our only disappointment was they did not have Bone Marrow. Our server, Lanny tried to ask, but he informed us it was seasonal. BUMMER!!!Awesome food, great service....highly recommended!"
"Great experience! Small plates are actually quite large compared to some tapas places. We got three for three people and were stuffed! Great food, good wine, and Aldo, our waiter was lovely. Will be back!"
"First off, NYE was SO fun here! Unlike your typical NYE at a downtown restaurant...this place does NOT charge you for NYE and yet they still manage to give the patrons free champagne for a midnight toast (if you care for it) and a fun/safe environment for the countdown. Don't worry if you get a late reso because the atmosphere is always vibrant no matter what time of night it is.As for the rest of my review....I guess it is a counter review to the California hater below...First off, their gnocchi is not bland at all...this restaurant is what got me into that 'potatoey' treat to begin with and I like that they serve it with the white sauce because gnocchi with red sauce is just wrong...Their beef fillets are also incredible. The cut of meat is really good for the price. I love this place because my husband and I are still regulars even though now we don't live in the city anymore...we always find a way to deal with the terrible Kennedy traffic just to get to this place for a date here and there. Service is also awesome considering how packed this place always is. I always managed to get seated even sometimes when I don't have a reso...tho I HIGHLY recommend a reso. Also if you are driving from out of the city-Valet is pretty cheap- probably $12...which is comparable to the street meter parking.One more tip- if you come here for a birthday party they will slice and serve cake for you if you bring it in."
Had reservations for 6:30pm. Got there at 6;30pm. Place was packed. Originally seated inside but very noisy and reminded me of why I don't like Maggianos or places like that. Asked to be seated outside and it turned out to be the best decision of the night. Had the white bean and garlic spread. Hubby totally cheated and had ravioli and I did salmon. Had some little puffy beignet type balls ( I forget the name) they were good. Salmon was on bed of olive tapenade. Nicely prepared. A tad salty. Beautiful night for sitting outside. Would not go back but nice.
"Went to Quartino's for dinner with a group of 6. First off, the wine selection is great and cheap- you can order a 1/2 liter of wine as cheap as 10.00! Being that places sell wine by the glass for 10.00, this is such a great deal.  The ambiance of the place great, more of a fancier casual- it draws a definite corporate after work crowd and pretty spacious. We ordered calamari, margarita pizza, dates wrapped in pancetta, and porcini & truffle risotto. I would say the definite favorite was the risotto, though it wasn't enough to happily be shared by 6 people. The least was likely the pizza- it wasn't that it was bad, but it was pretty standard. Service was pretty good. The waiter was friendly and knowledgable about the menu. For dessert i split a nutella panini with a friend and asked for vanilla ice cream with it. The dessert was a little disappointing- just some small toasted bread with nutella and some powdered sugar. It would've been completely a fail if we didn't add ice cream to it, which kept it from being too dry tasting.Without including our drinks, our total food bill came to just under 60 dollars- not bad for 6 people! i was expecting much more. I think the next time I'll try to be more adventurous with my menu selection. I would recommend this place for anyone who wants a nicer tapas dinner but doesn't want to break the bank."
"I love a place where you can order a LITER of wine to share with friends. This place was on the cheap and had some great vegetarian options like the escarole with beans, the kale salad and the campania neopolitan pizza. This place was able to accommodate a table of 6 on the fly during a weekday and was noisy enough to distract from the toddler we had with us. Good mix of tourists and Chicagoans."
"My sister just turned 16 and I thought she would love a shopping day downtown Chicago so with parents in tow off we went. She requested tapas and Italian so when I found this place, I thought I nailed it. Unfortunately, it was overall a 'meh' experience. The food was decent. We ordered a variety of dishes (I think 5 overall?) and none of them really stood out. The pizza crust was good but the toppings were all kind of blah. The asparagus risotto was cooked well but in desperate need of seasoning. The gnocchi were dense instead of pillowy. The pasta dishes were ok. The bread that they gave us at the beginning of the meal was great!The service was great but not great enough to make me want to come back."
"I haven't given 5 stars to a restaurant by heart in a while. Glad to have one of those rare times. I was stunned by how big this place is but still has great service and unique, fantastic food.This is an Italian Tapas restaurant in the heart of Chicago. All the waiters are wearing a jersey of a different Seria A soccer team that I found pretty interesting. They serve wine in a water glass, not a fancy wine glass but that adds value to the overall authentic experience. Amazing pasta selection (tried 6 and can't single out one) and even better desserts. All of these come with a super reasonable price.Only drawback I can think of is the loud noise. Definitely will be back."
"Thursday Night at 9pm and there is 30-40 minute wait with a crowd of diners awaiting tables.....you know there got to be something amazing going on here.It was my first night in Chicago and 3 hours until to my Birthday and I couldn't have been more pleased that I chose here to dine.The restaurant is gorgeous, it has an old school Italian vibe with the rustic dark wood table & chairs and hardwood floors, antique ceiling fans, Salumeria, Wine Celler, and Open Kitchen plus Frank Sinatra playing in the background.As soon as we were seated servers brought over water (served in a glass bottle) and fresh sliced bread from the electric slicer. Our waiter who was sweet and bubbly explained that everything is served tapas style/family style and comes out as soon as its ready.For drinks we started off a delicious glass of bubbly ProseccoThis was our line up of foodBaby Spinach w/ Pears, Walnuts, & Ricotta Salata Fresh ingredients, lightly dressed, perfect combo of flavoursVeal Meatball Slider w/ Pomodoro Sauce & GiardinieraTender juicy meatballs on toasted ciabatta, loved the GiardinieraTagliatelle alla Bolognese w/ Traditional Meat SaucePerfect al dente noodles, very rich chunky meat sauceLasagna al Forno w/ Bolognese Meat Ragu, Ricotta, & Tomato SauceThe winner of the night, sooo flavorful literally melted in my mouth!Chocolate GelatiSooo creamy & deliciousHousemade BiscottiAuthentic Italian biscotti, 5 in a servings so we got the pack the rest to go!We were sooo stuffed after this ginormous meal and I couldn't believe how little the bill came up to, super affordable meal! Service here is the best I've ever had! A glass of water never got the chance to go empty, servers are always buzzing around making sure everything is ok, food comes out piping hot, fast, fresh and delicious! This is definitely a go to spot!!"
"Not bad, just average. It's a large menu with a variety of options. The first carafe we ordered was old/bottle open too long. The meal we had was average at best: we had the $25 combo app and pasta and salad. Pretty overrun with tourists."
Wasn't quite sure what I was getting into when I made a reservation for valentine's day but it turned out to be a great experience. The lighting set a nice intimate tone and the dishes were sized perfectly for sharing with my date. Our waiter was very helpful with the menu and everything tasted fresh. Definetly recommend any of the cheese plates.
"For the money, this is one of the best places to eat in the city. Super reasonable prices and the portions are quite a bit larger than tapas. Don't over-order unless you want leftovers. The pastas and pizzas are all quite good. I disagree with the complaints of noise...quite normal for a large city. As the name suggests, many great wines."
Wasn't impressed at all....food was mediocre at best and the atmosphere was loud and boisterous.  Highly overrated!
"Decent experience. This place is huge and really loud so I wouldn't come here for a romantic quiet evening. It would be good for large birthday dinners, etc. We saw a couple bachelorette parties when we went on Saturday night. They cram the tables pretty tightly. Food was pretty good. Everything is designed to share so it comes out when it's ready. This is good because the food is piping hot when it arrives. As soon as we were seated, a plate of sliced bread was dropped on the table. It was cold and a bit dry. It had clearly been sliced awhile ago and was sitting around waiting for the next table. Disappointing first impression. If you read any of my reviews, you know that I like my bread to be warmed and I think poorly of restaurants that don't make that effort, since it is so easy to do.We started with the fried calamari. It was hot and crispy. I liked that it wasn't greasy and the breading didn't come off. My only complaint was how stingy they were with the marinara dipping sauce. It was a tiny amount compared to the amount of calamari. At least it was warm. Second course was linguine with white wine clam sauce. The noodles were perfectly al dente. The clams were plentiful. The sauce was well seasoned. This was our favorite dish of the night. Our last course was the braised pork shank. Our server told us it was braised for nine hours. It fell off the bone and was super tender. It came on a bed of mashed potatoes. This dish would've been better if it was better seasoned, and if there were more potatoes and sauce on the plate. I'm always surprised when restaurants are skimpy on cheap ingredients such as potatoes and grits and rice. Our server was friendly. He was training a newbie and we got the impression he was showing off for her. He kept saying how jealous he was of our meal, something he probably says to all of his tables. Given how many Italian options there are, I probably wouldn't return here."
"I have been going to Quartino for years but am only taking the time to review it now. There are so many great things to say about this place, I don't even know where to start!I guess I'll just start with my favorite thing about it.... the veal meatballs! So delicious and unlike any other meatball out there. Its an extremely moist meatball served with sun dried tomatoes and delicious plump raisins that you can't skip eating even if you tried. Best thing on the menu, get it for sure!I also love the pizzas there. My favorite are the Rucolina and the Sausage. Some other must have menu items are the Roasted Tuscan Sausage with onions and peppers and their Nutella Panino for dessert mmmmhmm. I've been here for private parties, birthday parties, dates, family outings and friend-catch up dinners and have never once been disappointed. It is certainly a great place for any kind of occasion. It's also my go-to suggestion spot for out-of-towners because you can try a lot of food for a low price. And the wine is so cheap too! The atmosphere is busy, fun and super Italian. You won't be disappointed at this place!"
"The place is crowded and right in the middle of downtown. So we got a table on the street .. Good to sit and eat there .. But the food wasnt that great as expected . We had the braised pork, tortelloni pasta with red vodka sauce and a margharitta pizza. The pork was well made but not that tasty .. Overall experience was okayish.."
"In the spirit of the Yelp 100 challenge and my friend helpfully having her 30th birthday dinner here last night, here's an updated review.Great place for groups.  House white and red wines are very drinkable and can be ordered by the half liter or liter.  Served in non-traditional wine glasses that can be used to play quarters at the table.  That was with another group, but it was quite classy, I assure you.Food!  And all of it for very reasonable prices.-Pappardelle - great pasta choice, though last night I found the noodles a bit more al dente than I'd like.-Penne ala vodka - another solid choice.  In fact, we got two orders of this.-Mushroom Risotto - we requested it with non-pork stock as a member of our group doesn't eat pork.  Still tasty.-Beef short ribs - um.. delicious delicious meat.  Tender, flavorful, can't go wrong.-Gnocchi - gnocchi really isn't my thing, but for gnocchi lovers, I'm sure this would suffice.-Polenta fries - piping hot!  No for reals, it's hot, but delicious.  So eat carefully.-Calamari - pretty standard.  Less breading than some places use so more flavor comes through.-Soprano pizza - political incorrectness on very well executed crust. -Linguine with clams - white sauce, get it with the white sauce.  Tasty broth.  Lots of clams so hopefully you like those.-Zeppole - this was courtesy of our waiter for the aforementioned birthday.  We sang happy birthday loud enough to drown out the noise of quartino.  If you've ever been, you'd know that's loud.  That's how we roll.  These were good, but I prefer beignets.  I'm a diva.I've had lots of other stuff here too and it hardly ever disappoints.  The noise level is deafening, but works well for large rowdy parties.  We used it to play telephone.Probably wouldn't take a date here.  Unless you don't want to talk to your date, then it's a good strategic move."
We love this place-fun to bring lots of family here...works for everyone!! Favorites are the pappardelle and meatballs....so so many good dishes!!
"I had many visits but only now reviewing. I know, such a Yelp cliche but whatever. There are so many reviews but here is my short (hopefully) but to the point review.+ Good for groups. I've been here for alumni functions usually held upstairs. This past summer I hosted a group of 10 ladies for a bachelorette party dinner. I looked into getting a private room for us (through private events section of website), but due to keeping costs down, ended up with reserving a table in the dining area. It actually worked out since the party attendance wasn't as big as expected. Actually, that same night, I think we saw about three or four other tables with bachelorette party people. + Even though portions are small (think tapas style), I always leave like I ate one big meal. My parents were in town for Thanksgiving. My dad liked the idea of small dishes because he thinks he's gaining a belly. Whatever, dad. He liked it so much we came back...three freakin' times in a week. In our defense, we didn't order the same dishes each time. The favorites though were the shrimp risotto, polenta fries (my personal fave), the not so spicy salami (name escapes me), and fried calamari.If you don't like loud places or sit somewhat too close to the next table, this might not be for you. Otherwise, it's not a bad option to take out-of-towners and/or need a place for a group function. You can make reservations via Open Table. I highly recommend reserving a table because it does get really crowded, even on the most random weeknight."
"This place on a Sat evening was almost deafening.  High energy,  great ambience and food was solid.  A snafu with one offering marred the meal,  but the server made it good.  Worth stopping in."
"My girlfriends and I went here for dinner on one my bachelorette party nights. We shared a bottle of red wine, two appetizers, pizza, and two pasta dishes. The food was spectacular. Very bold and flavorful. There were 5 us and we each spent $15 plus a $5 each tip, $20 total! Very reasonable and wonderful service."
"A quick lunch out with the workers I co-habitat with from 8-5 and I feel like I missed what the big deal is about this this place that earned it's popularity at the office.  We ordered a slew of pizza's, none really stood out as om-goodness.  They were all nice Neapolitan style pizzas, everything tasted fine, the atmosphere was fine, the service was fine.  I left feeling just FINE, not floored.  I think I forgot to order wine.  I will have to go again and see if a second chance is all it needs."
Great place to hang out with friends while sipping on exquisite drinks from an extensive drink menu
Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. I'll just cut to the chase and recommend some of my favorite items:1) Duck Prosciutto Pizza2) Linguini with Clams. 3) Crisp CalamariThe only complaint I had was that it did take a while for my dishes to come out.
"My boyfriend and I have been in Chicago for 4 days now, eating at a ton of different restaurants around our hotel.  We stopped in Quartino's for lunch and it is now my favorite restaurant of all that we have tried so far.   For our lunch, we shared the Organic Tomato salad and it was very fresh and delicious.  It had large chunks of tomatoes, English cucumbers, bell peppers, red onions, fresh basil and was in a delicious dressing (I'm assuming white wine vinegar?).  Then, we shared the 4 cheese pizza (called Quattro something).  It was bubbling hot when delivered and was very good.  Perfect crust and you can't go wrong with the flavors of 4 cheeses.  Then, we shared a 1/2 order of the Panino al Gelato Limone.  I was very light and delicious.  I am adding a picture of a partial list of their desserts.  I love that they will allow you to have 1/2 orders of several of their menu items.  Everything was served as a beautiful display.  Both of us were very satisfied and our tab was only $40.33 (plus tip), and that included a $14.00 pinot noir wine.  Very good prices.  Our waiter (Adam) was exceptional, answered all our questions and was very friendly and attentive to all his tables.  We will definitely be back to this restaurant the next time we visit Chicago.  Their menu was huge and our waiter told us that they will cater to any dietary restrictions and would accommodate just about any request.  There was also a very nice upstairs with a fireplace and a bar upstairs also and it looked so inviting and comfortable.  I highly recommend!!!"
"I really love this place.  I discovered it a few years ago on a touristy trip to Chicago and as business as brought me back to the city, this place still holds.  The wine selection is large and decently priced.  The pizza is GREAT.  All of the ingredients were fresh and well paired.  I LOVE the osso buco.  Fall off the bone delicious and don't forget to at least taste the bone marrow it comes with.  The home made pastas are fresh and delicious like the gnocchi and tagliatelle alla bolognese.  Of course the plates are small and meant for sharing which means you get a taste of a lot of dishes.  Nice outdoor seating is the weather is nice.  Only con to my last visit was that the AC vent in the ceiling dripped onto one of my coworkers, which was not ideal.  Food and service though?  Excellent."
"I have been to Quartino at least a half dozen times, most recently this past weekend. Service is very fast and attentive.  The food is great and there really is something for everyone which is why I recommend this place to everyone. I was there for a bachelorette party and for dessert the server brought out a ""special"" dessert with a banana.  We all laughed so hard as did the tables around us. Highly recommend this place even for picky eaters like our bride-to-be is. Coincidentally I will be back this weekend for yet another bachelorette party!"
"If you are looking for a fun special events location, consider Quartino.We attended a private function at Quartino's so we were upstairs in a special events room separate from the main dining area. Because of this, we didn't experience any of the noise problems mentioned in other reviews.The first thing that I noticed was the service - incredibly attentive staff for each table. One of our guests was allergic to spinach and the staff went out of their way to make sure she was not served anything with spinach in it. Another guest was only eating fruits and vegetables for some reason and they kept bringing her different options to enjoy.And the staff were just in a great mood...or maybe it just seemed that way since they kept the wine flowing throughout the night.The food was excellent - a preselected menu for the event and everything brought out was incredible. We really liked the meat and cheese plate - the sauces that came with the plate were almost like a chutney and they were to die for. The veal meatballs - awesome. The beef filets were perfectly cooked and the chicken was very moist. If I had one comment it was that the tables were very small, it was hard to have everything on the table at once, especially since they pile extra plates in the center of the table so no room for any of the food dishes there. The staff did a great job of clearing the plates swiftly so in the end it wasn't so bad."
"Small Italian plates, ready to share, with primi/antipasta, pizza, pasta, and a selection of in-house cured meats for a great charcuterie board. This bustling River North hot spot is packed with tourists and locals, entering hungry and leaving full. Their wine selection can be ordered by small, medium and large portions to accommodate any size party. Great for large groups. Only downside is that the noise level can get pretty high. I wouldn't recommend for a ""get to know you"" date.Dessert was also amazing. The three best are the chocolate cake with ice cream, tiramisu, and caramelized banana ice cream. (No, I didn't eat them all at one sitting). Reservations HIGHLY recommended."
My wife and I had a great dinner here tonight.  My wife loves beef carpaccio and was happy to find it on the menu.  We had a 6:00 PM reservation and were seated right away...it was already crowded.  The server was very friendly and helpful and the food was great.  We will definitely come back the next time we visit Chicago!
"the service was very nice. i had a reservation but our table wasn't ready when we came and so they comped our group a bottle of wine. waiters were very attentive and they explained each dish to us.however, the food.....pretty terrible. wish i didn't have to say so but most of the dishes need work. we ordered about 12-15 dishes and didn't feel satisfied with any of them. we left to eat again elsewhere (portillo!)"
"For the price point this place is just ok.Pros: Comfortable cozy place to hang out with friends, pretty convenient location.Cons: Food. Maybe we ordered the wrong stuff. The sausage tomato risotto made me sad. It was drenched in (nacho?) cheese/cream puddle. I understand the rice is supposed to have texture but this was way too hard in the middle and mushy on the corners, like cooking it on too high heat for too little time. Couldn't taste the meat over the sauce, although tomatoes were alright. Portion was small (like 2 cups) for the $12 we paid. Giardiniera pizza - our bad for ordering pickled vegetables on pizza. Crust was good, other pizzas looked fine.Chocolate torte with ice cream: I'll like it even if it's just raw cake dough, but this one was a little overbaked. Kind of like realizing you left your cookies in the oven for too long - it's tasty, but ehh.We might be back to try their cold plates and a different pizza."
"Rowdy, group-friendly Italian hotspot. Quartino remains insanely packed as it was back in 2005 when it first opened, continues to be a mainstay in RiNo. ""Where wine is cheaper than water,"" the restaurant offers an extensive selection of Italian wines at all price points. Pasta - quality has sadly declined. Gnocchi - while this used to be good, our recent order was terribly gummy and unappetizing. Orecchiette with fennel sausage ragu is tasty. Risottos are hit-or-miss, tends to be undercooked.Pizzas - served piping hot, good for rounding out group orders. Recommend the quattro formaggi (pecorino, mozz, fontina, parm) and quattro stagioni (artichokes, roasted peppers, grilled zucc, portobello, grana).Dessert (save room!)Gelati trio (meant for sharing 3-4) is prettily presented in a large martini glass, topped with roasted hazelnuts. Zeppole - tried the donuts (similar to beignets) for the first time - pleasantly impressed! They come paired with honey and dark chocolate - the honey goes surprisingly well.Wait times can be horrendous - be prepared. Volume is LOUD. Vibe is high energy."
"I came her for my first Mother's Day, and was disappointed to say the least. First of all we were never even told the free Mother's Day drink special. I only know because I over heard as we left. Second of all the gnocchi that I ordered was awful! It was as if they poured a whole bottle of pesto on it. Also the waiter looked bothered that I brought my baby. Hello it was Mother's Day! And lastly every mother that I could see received a flower. I felt like I was a customer they could do without! Not a feeling I have ever felt when dining out. I will never go back!!"
Great gluten free options. Staff very knowledgeable about gf options on the menu. Server was extremely attentive to our needs.
"Great food, cozy vide, excellent service. Enjoyed New Years here, the staff really took great care of us. Enjoyed the olives, tomato salad, eggplant with olives, salmon, veal steaks, rosemary chicken, beet salad, ice teas and champagne. All was wonderful. The only thing I wouldn't get again was the shrimp risotto which was salty and not as good as their other items. Ended the night with fondue of dark chocolate and fruits. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants a delicious experience without dedicating a large budget to dinner. 4.6/5 rating"
"Beautiful ambience and we lucked out with amazing weather. The four cheese pizza was absolutely decadent. We got half cheese and half veggie and they were thin and full of flavor. The spicy arrabiata was light and packed with freshness, I couldn't stop eating it. The Yukon gold potatoes were flavorful but it could have used a dipping sauce.Overall, a great culinary experience."
"Overall it was a very disappointing experience. Was expecting good quality Italian food but it was honestly fast food Italian. If you are looking for something cheap and Italian, this would be the spot."
"Possibly the WORST Italian Food I have ever had the misfortune to put in my mouth.Also, possibly the LOUDEST place I have ever had the misfortune to visit.  The person seated next to me could not hear me above the 'roar' of the overcrowded room.  Horrible experience.  There is not one thing in this establishment that ever makes me want to step in it again.  Not even an offer for a free meal.Assured by our waiter that our small plates would arrive in an staggered fashion we ordered several plates from both the appetizer and pasta options. Four of us were dining so we ordered about 8 dishes.  ALL 8 dishes arrived at the same time.  The tables at Quartino are small to begin with so you can imagine that 8 dishes quickly overwhelmed the table.  Let me just point out something that most people may be missing at this point......if you order 8 dishes and they all arrive at the same time this has got to lead you to believe that all their food is prepared way ahead of time and then slopped onto serving dishes when ordered and then rushed out to tables.  Classy? Delicious? Mouth-watering?  Think Again.  I couldn't wait to get out of this place.  I don't get the appeal.  Honestly.  Horrible food.  Olive Garden is better (and that is saying ALOT!). Just another restaurant that caters to downtown tourists.  I usually am pretty understanding but this place is not worth your time, your appetite or your wallet.  Lettuce Entertain You should be embarrassed."
"Another successful day and night of Lollapalooza, Minh and I were just downright hungry, tired, and just wanted something on the lighter side. Tapas sounded like a good choice but we did not know where to go. Walking around we stumbled upon this place. At first glance, you would think this is an upper snobby restaurant. Walking in and looking around you realize that it isn't like that at all, there are people at the bar, sitting outside on the patio and dining inside in casual clothing. As for myself I could have dressed a tiny bit better for the place (I was in full concert mode; shorts, flip flops, t-shirt with a bikini top under) and I probably looked like hell too from being in the sun and humid conditions.The hostess was nice and asked where we would like to be seated since the restaurant was only half-full at 11:30pm. We said the back booth would work for us.Our server was a little too overjoyed at serving us and knowing we just came from Lollapalooza and that we were yelpers. He went into a full conversation about how he was just starting out in his quest on being a foodie. Congrats, buddy!! Their menu has a lot to offer and we were told that everything is to be shared.We kicked things off with ordering:Caprese Salad: Mozzarella, Roma Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, & Aged Balsamic Syrup (I love caprese salads; if they are made right then they are tasty. I really liked the chucks of mozzarella they put in.  The balsamic gave it that sweet yet bitter taste.Veal Skirt Steak: Wild Arugula, Roasted Grape Tomatoes & Balsamic Syrup (This was an interesting dish for me, as I have never had much raw food before, but the bites I did have were really good, so good in fact I would order this again.Paparazzi Pizza: Chicken, Grilled Zucchini, Cheese Fonduta, & Thyme (Thin and crispy pizza, I liked the amount of chicken and zucchini they give you. The cheese is melted and perfect!And for dessert:Fantasia Coppa di Frutta: Raspberry, Orange & Lemon Sorbetti, Biscotti, & Seasonal Fruits....  (This dessert was one of the lightest I have had, it's a must try when you are here)After you are done with your meal, you have to check out their restrooms (located upstairs) not only is it art deco design (like the place is) but they also have scented powered soap too! I was a little surprised to see that it was still being made! I had to stop myself from putting more in my hand and making it into a paste. The lobby (or waiting area) has newspapers on racks and a vintage photo of Julia Childs there is even a signed apron from her."
Great!!! This place is legit Italian and so good!!!! Totally Advise or! Just reserve cause it is packed!
"I was really wanting real hearty Italian cuisine while in Chicago so I went on the yelp hunt and cross checked the restaurants with the top ten rated Italian restaurants of 2014. We got to the restaurant and was told it was family style which normally means a lot of food. Well, although very tasty, the portions are very small. Moral of the story, order a lot of variety.  The bread is not great. But the service was good and the desserts are large.  Enjoy!"
"Great location and great wine. I went here for an event, so I got to try a bunch of different appetizers. The pizza was great and the dates wrapped in bacon/prosciutto were amazing. I was a little disappointed with the polenta fries. I'll try this place again for a sit down meal."
"Delicious! We loved the vibe, the food, and the service. It was all amazing and exactly what you'd expect from a fine Italian restaurant. We had the rigatoni and tortellini pastas.  Both had the perfect amount of flavor. Also we love italian sodas (which not many italian rest. have,but they do!) In a variety of flavors. We tried Raspberry. It was the best I've had. Highly recommend coming here if you are in Chicago Downtown.Another plus is that we were surprised at how nice a restaurant and how delicious the food was AND how inexpensive it was. We are ok with paying high price for a nice meal but this was a great meal and less expensive that most italian restaurants. Only negative is they apparently do not have spaghetti (which they offered to make on the spot) but is not on the menu, nor do they have lasagna. Which was a let down. That's actually why we came, we were craving spaghetti and my husband had been wanting lasagna. Which we thought they had because there are pictures here on yelp of lasagna and spaghetti. But I guess those are in the wrong yelp. Or maybe they served these dishes in the past and no longer do. Not totally sure. But I'm glad we stayed. Because there is amazing food to be had here."
"Came here with a bunch of friends on a Saturday night. This place opens late and we came around 11p, so we were seated right away. They have a pretty nice selection of cripsy thin crust pizzas. We had the Quattro Pizza which was good, but I had the Soprano before and it was better. I had the Mushroom Risotto and I thought it was a bit bland. The portion was huge, but that's about it. My friend had the Rigatoni and I stole some to compare. It was pretty good for the most part, but it was a bit saucy. The service here was pretty good. This place was pretty loud, but I would definitely want to come back and sit outside. The price here is very reasonable for a nice place located by the heart of Downtown!"
"Great for big groups. Decent considering the surrounding area is full of chains or very pricey steakhouses. It's an Italian-American restaurant where food is good, but not quite authentic. Great dishes to share. Highlights: veal meatballs, duck pizza, and calamari."
"This an attractive restaurant with a some outside patio tables with enough foot traffic for people watching, but too much to feel overwhelmed in the crowd.  Inside there are several levels with a great environment for groups. And given the small plates menu, this is a fantastic place to meet a group for lively conversation and lots of tasting and sharing. As there were just two of us, the patio was a great spot. The staff were welcoming, knowledgable and attentive, but with a relaxed and unobtrusive manner to allow a leisurely experience. Such a pleasure.  We let our waiter select our Salumeria tasting plate and did a wonderful mix of meats, cheeses, olives and such.  The aged parmigiano reggiano was amazing, and a great apricot compote which was a delicious counter to the meats. We had the gnocchi which had a delicious arugula basil but themselves were too heavy and gummy. Might not have been house made. A bit of a shame there. We finished with a order of zeppole for desert, which were warm, fresh, and quite tasty, but a bit over done with powdered sugar.. I only wish we could have tried more main items.Alas,I can't review Quartino under the circumstances it would clearly shine; a wonderfully vibrant group dining experience. I have no doubt this would be a perfect spot for this if you are seeking one.  Still it was great food, and fantastic staff and service."
Really enjoyed the food and the best part is you have the option (w/ almost all the dishes) to order half-orders.  That's exactly what we did and we ended up trying 7 different dishes!  Our favorite were the clams.  This place is busy and can be a bit of a wait.
"I really like coming to Quartino. My friends all love coming here and I had no idea what the big fuss was until I actually ordered food from here. They are super accommodating with dietary restrictions!I've come here many times with friends in the past and my favorite dishes are polenta fries, vegetariana pizza (awesome awesome pizza), and chocolate fondue. Their chocolate fondue is one of the best I've ever had in my life. Super delicious.I just came back here earlier this week with a friend and the wild arugula salad was just okay. I was debating between getting a sangria or moscato for dessert and then ended up getting a moscato. Biggest moscato ever! I loved it. It wasn't just a bit of alcohol (like what restaurants usually give you for an after dinner / meal drink), I was actually given a lot.All I can say is, yum :)"
"So while in Chicago, we had a few folks flying in so I turned to my foodie friend and he was able to direct me to Quartino for a nice team dinner. This place was perfect in my mind because I love Tapas and Italian Food. What a great idea to have small plates for Italian food. Bravo.Our team arrives here at 6 PM on a Thursday and we were still missing two folks. They told us that they would seat us once our party arrived which I did not mind and felt was fair. Finally the last two members joined the party and we were brought into the main dining room of the bustling restaurant. It is quite packed in here and there is not a whole lot of wiggle room as a warning to folks. Since it is in fact pretty packed, the noise level is on the loud side as well. The décor of the joint was inviting and casual which was reinforced by the tables placed closely together. It made it seem like one large family at a dinner table ready to consume a delicious meal. I was a fan of the ambiance.The service was also super friendly. The waiter was very knowledgeable over all of the food including what vino to order based on what type of vino we were looking for. They were attentive throughout the meal even though each waiter seemed to be waiting on multiple tables. We ordered a ton of plates to share which included the veal meatballs, the Bolognese, penne ala vodka, the margherita pizza, and the parpadelle. Everything was delicious honestly. A solid joint and definitely hearty enough to share with folks. The penne alla vodka was one of my more favorites and the meatballs were great as well. I was worried that they would be a bit bland but they were flavorful so definitely a plus. Everyone loved the small plate experience as we were all able to try multiple different things without getting full quickly.This is definitely a great place to bring a group of folks to spend some time bonding with folks. Solid food and a relaxing atmosphere. I will definitely be back to try a few more plates during my next Chicago visit."
"Good food, great service.I went with a couple girlfriends over the summer. Would've been nice to dine al fresco, but that would've been a 30+ minute wait. Our waiter recommended we order 5 dishes to share. We had caprese salad, calarmari, popeye pizze, gnocchi, and beef short ribs. The food was decent but I wish it had more flavor, especially the gnocchi. For dessert, we shared the coppa al banana and zeppole (doughnuts) which were delicious!! The red wine sangria was great. Our waiter was really helpful when it came to the menu. He recommended a wine to my friend who is a wine noob. She ended up not liking it so he took it off the bill, sweet. I'll probably go back, but skip dinner, and go straight for sangrias and desserts."
"Roasted octopus!!! So under the radar but oh so good.  We got sausage risotto, short rib paperdelle, salumi, pizzas, tagliatelle bolognese, tiramisu, gelato, Brussels sprouts, and fried donut with choc sauce!!!  Everyone in our party of 10 were super happy and satisfied with this delicious meal.  Atmosphere is rowdy and familial.  Lots of young people as well as family with small children.  Great gathering place right in the heart of the city!  Service was good considering the traffic and overall busyness.  Hats off to the staff for getting our orders right and on time!"
"I have been coming to Quartino for over a year now. It was one of the first places I tried when I moved to Chicago and have been coming back ever since.Food: Tapas style which is great for sharing and sampling multiple items without getting too full. I love all the pizzas but my favorites are the vegetarina and the melanzane. I am also a huge fan of the veal meatballs napoli and asparagus risotto. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of their dishes!Recently I have gotten hooked on the monthly wine bash event. The last Wednesday of every month for $20 you can drink as much wine and eat as many small plates as you want from 7-9 (It is quite a steal!!). I think it has been a great way to unwind with friends and coworkers during the week. Perfect excuse to go out on a Wednesday night, even in the middle of winter!I would recommend making reservations as it always seems extremely crowded no matter the day for dinner. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone who loves Italian in the River North area."
"Awesome dinner. Loved the atmosphere and the food. A great authentic Italian meal, not a tourist trap."
"Amazing. Granted, it's not the best food I've ever had in my whole life, but it was freaking delicious. Sure, it's loud. Duh, the place is PACKED and it's packed for a reason. I recommend that you order half portions when you can (tortellini and pappardelle are wonderful) and get the tiramisu! It's off menu - and it's HUGE. The doughnuts are amazing as well and we loved the dates and the creamy goats milk ricotta appetizers. We made a reservation for a 630 wednesday night and I recommend it. Lots of groups here, great for sharing, and regular portions are huge and affordable.6 plates for $45?! And we still took something home?! Awesome. We're east coast (Philly, DC, B'more) and this is little Italy worthy. We'll be back next year."
"My friend I and I decided to check out Quartino because their sign was a wine bottle and we thought that had to be a good thing which it was!Cool European atmosphere, fantastic service! We each had a 3 course meal so we tried a variety of what they had to offer and were very pleased! The food comes to the table whenever it's finished in the kitchen which was kinda nice and made it seem more like a 6 course meal.If you get a carafe of wine they will not serve it to you in a wine glass, found that out the hard way that I only had to ask for one.They have fresh bread & olive oil on the table, would be nice if they had fresh parmesan as well!"
"This place is absolutely lovely. For being such a large restaurant, it feels very intimate. The staff is incredibly helpful, prompt, and very sweet. My water glass never ran dry, which is always one thing I take note of in a busy restaurant.My foodie companion and I could not decide what to get, so the waitress allowed us a lot of half portions of many things, which I thought was very accommodating and greatly impressed me. We tried the Spinach & Arugula salads (both good, Arugula was better), Spaghetti all' Arrabbiata (perfect amount of spice), Cavatelli (ricotta made it very rich and creamy...delicious), and Fettuccini. This is traditional Italian at its best."
"Had a reservation at 5pm on Saturday 2/15. Once again, it was an incredible experience that I cannot wait to return to. Our waiter was friendly and very helpful picking out wines for the two of us to try, and the food literally flew out of the kitchen (and nearly every seat in that place was filled!) Dishes ordered: Porcini & Truffle Risotto (very rich, perhaps could have used an acidic finish)Pancetta Wrapped Dates (hands down one of the most complex flavor journeys ever)Veal Osso Bucco (decadent and fall off the bone tender)Wild Arugula Salad (the ricotta/orange segment combo was a pleasant surprise)Prosciutto San Daniele (aged and salty and wonderful)Coppa alla Banana (the espresso/chocolate sauce was divine)Once again, the wait staff was friendly and attentive and as a 21-year old, getting that respect doesn't often happen. Cannot wait to go back!"
The worst Sangrias I have ever had- very flat and made from terrible wine. Moreover the service was extremely slow.
"Went here last night and the place was packed. When I say packed I mean, peopls stepping on you feet while waiting for a table and a serious fire hazard type of packed.I had very high expectations for this place after reading the yelp reviews and I was disappointed. It is rare that yelp lets me down, but every once in a while it happens.for starters this restaurant is rated at a $$ which I feel is not correct. everything on the menu cost between 8-15 each, which sounds pretty inexpensive. trust me it adds up. my boyfriend and I ordered 4 things off the menu and dessert. the 4 dishes which were small plates came out as two-raviolis-on -a-plate-size. so after are 4 dishes were we both hungry, and let me say that I am a light eater. For two people to make a meal you would probably need to order 6 or 7 dishes. The food was good, but honestly nothing sticks out as being good enough to be specifically mentioned. Even though the food was good we couldn't justify ordering another 2 bites of food for $15. We ended up ordering dessert which was normal size and let me tell you, it was great. We had the warm chocolate cake with vanilla gelato. It was warm, chocolaty, gooey, sweet, magnificence. If I could I would give the cake alone 5 stars, everything else about a 2. The service was fine, it was a rather busy night so I understand the want to get people fed and out as fast as can be, but the staff seemed very impersonal and like you were just another tab. For a ""nicer"" place I expect a waitress who takes a min or 2 to go over the menu or check up on you. The bill came out to be $70! I felt like we were being stolen from. I don't think one should ever spend $70 and leave a restaurant hungry. Trust me, there are MUCH better places to eat in Chicago then Quartino, not really sure what people like about it so much."
"I finally got to go to this restaurant and I am obsessed!!  I love that they do Italian food but with small plates (why has this not been done sooner?!).  The group I was with and I selected a few meats and cheeses and asked for a waiter recommendation for a few others and all of them were great.  The bruschetta(s), calamari, and meatballs were incredible - I highly recommend you order them.  We didn't get any of the flatbreads but they all looked amazing going by our table.  The restaurant was packed but it still wasn't so loud that we couldn't talk.  I will definitely be back!"
Our waitress must've forgotten about us after sticking us in the corner because it took FOREVER to place our order and to get that 2nd bottle of WATER. The food was simply OK. The best thing we ordered was the octopus.
"Quartino, I wanted to love you unabashedly, but I just can't. It all began in your entryway. What is up with that space?! At 5'2"" I tend to get lost in a crowd, but all the pushing and shoving as patrons traipsed in and out was an immediate turn off.We had reservations for 6 and were seated at 6:45. Typically, I would have been mildly annoyed, but as we were going to see ""The Book of Mormon"" at 8, being seated this late meant a rushed dinner and no dessert. Don't mess with a girl who lives for dessert.You earned some love back after this debacle because the manager greeted us and  provided is some drinks on the house; gotta say I love a restaurant (or any business for that matter) who works to keep guests happy.The service was spotty. I'm not saying it was our server's fault as she had a crowded section and a dangerously narrow gauntlet of tables to get around to, but it was s...l...o...w despite the food coming out quickly.That, and maybe at 32 I am a bit of a curmudgeon, but the place is LOUD. It was hard to hear my date across our tiny table (that as a tiny person I nevertheless felt crammed into).The food was okay. I personally tried the sausage and tagliatelle bologese. The tagliatelle was mushy and the sauce a bit sweet, but the sausage was delish. This earned another star in my book.The third star comes with the plentiful, aromatic and freshly baked bread that we enjoyed with our meal.Maybe I would come again, maybe I wouldn't. Might have to listen to ""Eye of the Tiger"" to get myself pumped up and would have to make sure I had nowhere to go immediately after."
"Wonderful place, wonderful food. Must try their pizzas!"
"You're walking around North State Street late at night. Hunger, fatigue, and sweaty from the humid late summer climate. Quartino sticks out in the corner of State and Ontario. It's dimly lit and looks classy from the outside. People just sitting outside lounging. Maybe it's a good spot for a late dinner.Walking inside, the building has a very old school feel to it. It's very spacious and there are tables everywhere. This place can accommodate large parties easily. We got seated in the back with the TV right above us. Cool air blowing down on us. Even though there are many people here, each table feels very private.They serve Italian dishes. But not giant family style plates that serve 4 people. They're smaller dishes meant to pass around and share with everyone. Almost like an Italian tapas style. They also have pizza and gluten free choices.Our dishes:Caprese - A salad dish consisting of MOZZARELLA, ROMA TOMATOES, FRESH BASIL & AGED BALSAMIC SYRUP. This dish was quite refreshing and a good starter for the night.Angus Beef Carpaccio - The raw beef was seasoned with celery and other spices. It was chilled well and tasted very flavorful. Carpaccio just the way I like it. Paparazzi Pizza - Pizza topped with CHICKEN, GRILLED ZUCCHINI & THYME. It was above average pizza. Nothing too fantastic but nothing to complain about either.Fantasia Coppa di Frutta  - Raspberry, Orange & Lemon Sorbetti, Biscotti, & Seasonal Fruits. Dessert was top notch. I loved this awesome cup of sorbetti and fruits.Service was very good. Server was maybe too attentive. Restrooms are upstairs and they use powered hand soap. Now that's old school."
"We loved this restaurant.  Our waiter was Scott, who explained the menu thoroughly and made some great recommendations.  The food was excellent...every bite of it...and the prices were very reasonable.  I can't say enough about the wonderful experience we had at this restaurant."
"Good and solid Italian place. I was in Chicago for an evening and needed something relatively quick so I sat at the bar and ordered an app and one of their pizzas. The app - pancetta-stuffed dates - was really good and enough to share with 2 folks. Then came the soprano pizza, very tasty and a good portion as well. Prices were reasonable and fair - I would definitely recommend this place for locals and tourists who want a good portion of italian fare at a cool, relatively authentic atmosphere."
"I like this place.Comfortable set-up, sort of close together in the dining room, but still comfortable.  Also not overly loud, which is something that I like.  It's a big open room more or less so there could potentially have to be some yelling to be heard but we did not have to do so.Good service - not overly aggressive but very timely and the food came out quickly, which was nice because the people we were with were on a tight schedule that night.  Good with bringing refills, too.These are small plates and you could probably get away with ordering a couple of starters and then eating your own small portion.  I like to share so this is a good place for a group and a good place to get to try a lot of different things. Standouts were the sausages on the meat and cheese platter and the octopus was a big favorite at our table, too.  I also really liked the gnocchi.  We also ordered the zeppole for dessert - these were probably my most favorite item of all.  I mean, who can resist light, airy puffs of doughnut and chocolate for drizzling?  I would be of a mind to just order that for my whole meal next time.  Awesome stuff!There's valet if you think you want to drive and don't want to have to park, too.Overall, quite lovely and I would be glad to go back!"
"Loved it here! We went on a Friday night and got in right away. The food was great - it's made for sharing so it was perfect for a date night! If you're going to try something, try the vodka sauce penne. So good! I could have had an entire plate of that to myself. We also got sangria. We each ordered a 1/4 liter and it gave us three drinks each...for $6! Great price! Food was amazing and it wasn't pricey at all compared to other places in Chicago. We left comfortably full and satisfied with the food...and the bill!"
The acoustics in this place are horrible. They also have too many tables in the main dining area which further doesn't contribute well to the atmosphere . The pizza was good with the crust crispy but the heirloom tomato salad a disappointment. The tomatoes were overripe and tasteless. Honestly I recommend to venture next door instead as the overall experience there is much better.
"Quartino is always a conveniently located guaranteed good meal. Somehow I always end up in this neighborhood every trip to Chicago and I can navigate fairly well around here. Despite the bounty of options, I still always find my way here. I love the variety of small and large plates. The outdoor seating is perfect to enjoy and check out the corner and the people walking by. I also really enjoy the indoor area as well that seems like a bustling but managed Italian market. Another plus, even the small plates are pretty hearty! My favorites are the veal meatballs and the pizza with arugula and duck prosciutto."
"The side of spicy spaghetti was deliciosa, with a spicy kick! The bread with balsamic olive oil was wonderful also. Marios chicken also good, but be sure and order the side of spaghetti for a perfect Italian meal....."
"I ordered Salumeria tasting every time I went there. It is a fun plate and you get to taste a little bit of everything! While the food was amazing, I really like this place for its ambience. Family-styled unpretentious Italian food for sharing with loved ones. I just like the place really :)"
"I've long been an advocate for Quartino as a great place for a group outing.  It's especially great if you have some picky eaters in the group.  But my most recent outing was a bit upsetting (sat night, 7pm).The reasons I love Quartino for groups - good food, cheap prices, the cheapest, drinkable wine in town and a rowdy table doesn't feel out of place, because it's so loud.  I would not go for a ""foodie"" meal, but it's great for a group.I've not been there in just over a year, but our experience was a bit disappointing. I'm hoping it's a blip on the radar and not the new typical.- 25 minute wait for our table, despite a reservation- 25 minutes is spent crammed in the first floor waiting area, they just have too many people there waiting and nowhere near enough waiting space for a restaurant that seats that many people (this place is HUGE)- Most rushed meal I've had in a long time - the small plates came out fast and furious, we were done within 50 minutes of sitting down.  Not really the sort of experience I was wanting.I'll give mgmt credit, we had a problem during the meal but it was handled to our satisfaction.I'll keep an eye on reviews and will probably go back at some point with a few friends to check it out - I really want to keep it in my arsenal."
"Armando made my evening - thank you!After being sat outside on the 2nd story patio (great spot), and seeing how incredibly busy they all were, I was not expecting phenomenal service, to be honest.  I was quite wrong, and I will happily admit it.  Every server - from the water guy, the kitchen guy who brought out a dish, and the main server - were all very kind, knowledgeable about their trade, and amiable to be around.Skip the bread they bring at the start - this is not (or was not on the evening I was there) their forte at all, and it is worth saving belly room for all of their delicious food.Fun wine list; a good list of unique Italian wines that pair very well with the food.  Armando recommended Aglianico del Vulture (Angels of the Volcano), which I very much enjoyed.  Adore that you can order wine by the  Liter,  1/2 or full, or a traditional bottle.  Fantastic!I swapped 2 of the homemade pasta dishes, after Armando mentioned this was completely normal.  Cavatelli being my favourite pasta, and I really wanted to try their Sugo, we made it happen, and it was delicious!  AND, they easily make  1/2 portions of the pasta dishes (4 oz. vs. 8 oz) - perfect! Also ordered the spinach salad which was excellent in its simplicity.Great macchiato to end the evening.  I would have loved to eat at least 4 more dishes, but there was absolutely no way I had room to do so.The silly part? Salad, homemade pasta, wine, macchiato = $33!  Fantastic!Wednesday evening and a dinner for 1, and I snagged the last table.  Plan ahead, or at least don't show up starving :-)"
"Always delicious! Romantic, fun atmosphere. Wonderful carafes of wine to start with your appetizer (yum caprese salad and cheese fondue). The portions are made for sharing (or enjoying alone) so you can try lots of delicious offerings. Make sure you save room for dessert."
"I love Quartino - we took our two boys there during a busy holiday weekend and it was fun.  The food was great, the atmosphere lively and everyone around us felt the same way.  Our waiter was MIA part of the time because they were so busy, but I will go back because we loved the rest of the staff."
"I know  that over 2,000  people before me have said this place  is great, but, it's not. This is a chuky-cheese  for adults. I didn't check the fire-code, but at any given time during dinner they can and do sets upwards of....I'm  just guessing 400-500 guests(?) this means the food is not beautiful, interesting or lovingly prepared. No matter where you sit, it's very loud. It's a volume business with fairly low-end ingredients. I'm not saying it's terrible for the money, I'm saying it's not worth the time and calories. If you consider yourself a foodie, don't go here."
"Love Quartino. This is one of my go-to restaurants when I have friends or family in town. I've been for both lunch and dinner and I personally prefer lunch as it's not as crowded.... dinner time is PACKED. The food is consistently good, it's tapas style Italian which is fun for trying lots of things and sharing. They have a great wine and cocktail menu and the staff is always on point."
"I loved the vegetarian meal I had at Quartino. We started off with the Garlic White Bean dip and loved it. The garlic flavor was powerful but not to the point of where we could not taste the great dishes to come. My favorite vegetable dish we ordered  was the Roasted Beets. They were perfectly cooked and the amount of cheese and nuts did not take away for the star itself. My dates top two dishes were the Stuffed Dates and the Stefano Pizza. Our liter of wine that we enjoyed with the meal was good but extremely over priced. Our finale however ""took the cake"" of the meal! (Pun intended...hehe) We ordered the Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream and.....LOVED IT! Perfectly cooked so that the entire cake, including the sides sitting against the ceramic bowl, were moist and rich. The only issue here was that we like an even ratio of ice cream to cake, so we asked for a second scoop, they charged us $3.50 with out telling us ahead of time. And let me tell you... anyone could get DOUBLE the amount of ice cream at a premium parlor compared to the amount we received. The staff was friendly, though we didn't see our server too often. We might have ordered more had the case been otherwise. Another thing to note is that their portions for their prices left more to be desired. The meal ended up being more expensive than expected. You have to note however, their location and atmosphere."
"This place really isn't that good, dont be fooled by the amount of yelp reviews. Booked it for table of seven a month in advance and yes, it's def a popular spot due to its proximity to Downtown... but it isn't worth the hype - you should really go to Purple Pig or Girl and the Goat if you're down for some real Chicago-food experience.The tapas were mediocre (we got the calamari, caprese, scallops, broccoli rabe, dates wrapped in Italian meat, mushroom risotto, clams with pasta) - all of which I thought was a fair evaluation because it was a good amount of food and oh, the free bread that they gave.The bread was cold and stale, butter was not flavorful but paired with balsamic vinegar it was a tad bit better. The dishes were like I said mediocre except for the scallops but the dish was also 16 dollars for three scallops so that wasn't such a great deal. The mushroom risotto tasted a little funny and the broccoli rabe was bitter that we almost threw it away.On top of that, the service was whatever. The servers in their Italian jerseys were not super attentive and pressured us multiple times to order more food and dessert and that was no bueno.Overall, I would not come back again and would not recommend anyone else to either. The only plus thing was that the host at the front helped us take a picture and he got on his knees to help us get a good picture with the sign. Thank you, kind host."
"what a great spot!  Visited from SF and this is my go to place before the show at House of Blues.  Great service, great energy, and great food.  The veal meatballs,  polenta fries, and the salumeria options were the bomb!  Cant wait for next time."
"Such a cool place! I've been here several times and it is best when you go with a group. It's super fun, you share many small platters between your group family style, so you get to try a lot of different dishes! All of the pizzas are fantastic, and the tortelline is my favorite. Only catch, you'll be waiting around an hour plus if you don't make reservations Friday - Sunday."
"The place is definitely popular. We came here at 9 on a Saturday night and there was still a line! At that point, common sense should've kicked in and we should've went elsewhere. Instead, we just waited since we were under the impression that the place was too good to pass up. The wait itself wasn't too bad and we were seated soon enough. We had a good variety of dishes going on but honestly, it was all very mediocre Italian food. Everything we ordered was passable, just not as amazing as people had made it out to be. Also, definitely stay away from the tiramisu. Out of everything we tried, I can only recommend the eggplant parm and their peach bellinis. If you're a native Chicagoan, I'm sure you'll make your rounds here every now and then. However, if you're only in town for a visit, go elsewhere and don't be fooled by the high ratings. Yes, it's not everyday you see Italian food served tapas-style at this price point, but keep in mind that these are much smaller portions (which means you'll be ordering more dishes so it all adds up in the end anyway)."
"Still a great value. Great prices for wine, solid food quality.Last week tried the ravioli with braised pork and peck, very tasty, and the veal ossobuco, perfectly done, smooth, rich. Nebbiolo wine complimented the food in another positive stop at Quartino."
"Came in for lunch & were seated immediately. Even had our choice of the bar, patio or dining room. Ordered The Dates Wrapped in Pancetta & the Gnocchi with vodka sauce. Both were excellent! I could have eaten two orders of the dates all by myself lol. They're addictive! We were given a bottle of water & bread right away with really flavorful extra virgin olive oil for dipping. Service was very prompt & friendly. Great wine list & I love the options for the Litre sizes. The manager Tony is great!"
Came here with a colleague and he knows his pasta.  The Spaghetti Bolognese was my favorite with what tasted like home made pasta!  Also had the veal meatballs - they were Ah-mazing! The Tuscan sausage risotto which I had high hopes for however was just ok.Will stick with wine next time.  My Old Fashioned and my colleague's cocktail were just meh.Great service though!  Can't wait to come back and try their other dishes!
"Been there twice, all I left with was Yum yum yum! It's a good place for two, avoiding the boredom of having only two entrees and being full. But one problem is that the two person tables are extremely small and usually in the corner - remember to ask for a better table when making the reservation.Let's see what I ordered:Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - the pasta itself is very authentic, just by chewing it you know its homemade, the sauce was just ok tho.Mushroom & white truffle risotto - a big win for truffle lovers, the truffle flavor is pretty heavy.Steamed clams - bigger portion than you would expect, fresh & clean, a little salty for my plate tho.Veal meatballs - OMG all my respect to those meatballs! I was not a huge fan of meatballs but I could eat a ton of those from Quartino. The raisins are a genius touch of the dish. Sweet smooth and juicy. Biggest yum for this!"
"This place is pretty decent. Stopped in here for a quick brunch before catching a long, international flight from O'hare.  I had the tortellini. It was pretty good, probably an 8/10. Nothing too exciting or groundbreaking. It was kind of similar to a Toyota Camry. But one with leather seats and a sunroof - nothing too exciting, but still pretty good. The one issue with this place is that all of their food comes to the table just as it is ready. That's fine if you're sharing everything. But if you are getting individual dishes get ready for unequal and often awkward timing. I finish about half of my plate of Toyota Camry pasta (see above) before my buddy got his scallops. Heaven forbid anybody in your party order order the salad and your date orders the veal parmigiana. They'll probably have to drive out to a little farm out by Rockford and slaughter the calf while the salad sits and wilts.Summary: eat here if you like Toyota Camrys, have no concept of time."
"I love this restaurant! Being Sicilian, it is hard to find a good, quality Italian restaurant that really embraces the feeling and taste of a true Italian meal. Quartino figured it out. The meals are served family style so you can order a few without worrying about a huge price at the end. Restaurant is in a good location a few blocks off of Michigan Ave. In my experiences in dining there, service has been great. Enjoy!"
"The meatballs and meatball sliders are amazing, as well as the gnocchi. Haven't had anything I didn't like. Great service! It's much quieter upstairs. We had a 730 reservation, we weren't seated until 745... No big deal ... The manager gave us a complimentary carafe of wine just for waiting!  So great!"
Very good tapas.My fiancé lives in chicago and this is where we go on date nights because you can share everything. Ambience is amazing. They have a great sparkling red wine and really good meatballs. I would recommend the prosciutto wrapped dates!
"TERRIBLE! Our flight got in late, so we searched some restaurants on Yelp and this place looked great.  We arrived at a very crowded restaurant, which we were fine with, but the noise was overwhelming.  My boyfriend and I were sitting on same side of the table and had issues hearing each other.We ordered caprice, it came with two pieces of mozzarella and a few pieces of tomato.  The mozzarella was slimy!  It took forever to get a second round of beer even though the waitress kept passing our table.  The pizza was just as bad as the appetizer.  The mushrooms tasted terrible and the overall taste of the pizza was just awful.  We were so disappointed as we were looking forward to eating in Chicago and we were severely let down."
"I've always been a fan of this place. The food was cooked to perfection, the drinks were wonderful, and the service was great. It is a little loud in the restaurant and it's often difficult to hear the person sitting next to you, but other than that, no complaints!"
"It's a little loud, but we love their food. Try caprese salad. Taste is the same as in Italy!!"
"great for our family---our kids love it, the food is solid and the atmosphere is solid.  the 'guy in the bathroom' who turns on the water and hands you a towel makes the visit for our kids!"
"Apparently this is the perfect spot to host any and every bachelorette party! Inexpensive yet tasty Italian food, great spot to take a large group for dinner.. It does get a bit crowded and loud, but that's half the fun."
"After walking 60 miles in Chicago for the Komen 3-Day, all I wanted to do was freaking EAT. The average 3-Day walker burns 6,000 calories...I'm pretty sure dessert alone accounted for my replenished caloric intake, but that's neither here nor there.When taking care of reservations for myself and my traveling entourage, I was faced with a number of challenges. First, had to find a place that was condusive to the budget of a friend who had recently lost her job...second, there was a vegan on this trip. Now, the restaurants that I had bookmarked did not exactly cater to the needs of my friends and given that I wanted them at the event for the support thought it necessary to accomodate and so I took the question to the Chicago Yelp threads where of course I was met by haters wondering why I hadn't just used the search function. On the flip side of the mild elite harrassment, one kind soul suggested Quartino and that my search could end there. So it was written and so it was done, reservation made days before our trip, and we were good to go.The restaurant itself reminded me a bit of an Italian version of Parc in Philadelphia, not over the top. Our waiter was great, explaining that the menu was tapas style and that plates were meant for sharing but could easily be ordered individually. Next you know we're ordering every type of cheese on the menu, pastas, salads, the works. The idea of budget went straight out the window when we started ordering wine. Dinner came and went, I ordered the octopus only to find that they had already sold out for the evening and so my order instead went to pancetta wrapped gorgonzola stuffed dates drizzled with honey; simply stellar. Shortly following was a pork belly and an heirloom apple compote. My meal? So well ordered that I ended up sharing with all my friends even though they had dishes of their own.Dessert was a meal of it's own. 5 desserts for 6 people all containing chocolate....that 6,000 calories I mentioned? All consumed in sweets, but it was so well worth it. The entire meal was a hit amongst my friends, definitely a great place if you're not looking to spend major coin in Chicago but will still get you a solid meal in a great downtown setting."
Great atmosphere. Good for after work drinks and dinner. Easy to share a pizza and other plates. Wine is super good and pretty inexpensive.
"I'm from Southern California and we visited Chicago, every time we walked by the restaurant had a humungous line and seemed really busy. That's always a good sign. So we came in for lunch and it was so good. The bread was so amazing and quality of the meals were soo good. The waiter was fun, informative and playful. It was all around a really good experience. The next time I come to Chicago I will definitely be back."
"I was really disappointed with this place. However I do want to give it a second chance because I think we just got unlucky.Mostly this review is to warn people to avoid our situation. I went there with a group of friends (6 people) and we were seated by the really friendly and attractive hostess. Unfortunately that's when the excitement ended. We sat outside--don't. There is nothing quite like the ambiance of trucks and motorcycles gunning it at the stoplight. Next we were informed that each plate was a little smaller than usual but that was because it was a tapas place and we were supposed to order a lot and share. We ignored that warning and each ordered a plate which all came out at separate times (awkward for our group). But even that is understandable and probably our fault. The food was incredible albeit small.The real problem I have with the place is our douchebag of a waiter. It was like he was hungover from the massive frat party the night before because he just didn't care about anything. He came up to our table seconds after we sat down, asked what we wanted, and walked away when we hesitated. He then disappeared for at least ten minutes while other, nicer, workers brought us water and bread to start with. When we ordered, I was last and still choosing between a few things. He didn't give me the chance to think any more and asked what my problem was. I asked which I should choose and he told me quickly the name of one, not a description, not a summary, the name. The dish was delicious but not anything like what I wanted. If it matters our waiter was wearing an inter Milan shirt and was a bigger guy with blonde hair.Oh one cool thing, I did notice the manager come offer free dessert drinks and comped food because the table next to us wasn't satisfied with their food so at least they have good management.Maybe I'll go back when I have money to buy a few bottles of wine and can sit for a few hours with those.tl;dr sit inside, avoid internazionale."
Simply amazing. Great portions for sharing. The ambiance is loud and fun. Must have the eggplant Parmesan its to die for. I am definitely coming back!!!
Great veal skirt steak. reasonable prices
"Tourist Italian food. Not bad.Atmosphere is nice but we sat on the patio and ordered the following:Caprese Salad (good)Shaved Vegetable salad (okay)Roasted Octopus (okay)Eggplant Parm (Awesome)House Pinot Noir (not good)In all, nothing to go back for and for the money and similar large downtown Italian restaurant style, Volare is way more on point."
"We sat out on the sidewalk patio for lunch on a lovely Chicago day.  Our server was really good - friendly, funny, quick.  We got the 3-course fixed price lunch and they were willing to go 50-50 on some of the items so we could try more dishes.  Overall a great experience!"
"Choosing a place to dine in Chicago can be a mountainous task - there are so many options everywhere that you begin to worry that you might not get to try all of its thousand or so restaurants in under two weeks.  My best advice is to start from the top and work your way in and I found that  Quartinos was definitely a place that stood up to that idea.  It was recommended by a friend with excellent taste in restaurants and boy was he spot on again.  Upon ariving, the hosts were exceptionally friendly (I thought I would have to donate a kidney to get a table). Looking at the menu - I wanted to try so many things but I settled for a few good ones.  The idea here is very similar to a small plates / tapas kind of deal but this is Chicago so beware of the massive portions.  The Veal meatball basil red chili pizza was good but nothing out of this world (then again I thought it was unfair for me to have just tried the best Pizza I've ever experienced the night before at Giordano's), the roasted lemon and herb chicken was stunning, the eggplant olive and caper salad was also nice and refreshing as was the duck prosciutto and the chicken soup, but I think the real star of this meal was the veal sliders - they were excellent and at just $2.50 each, it's almost a no-brainer to try at least one.  To wash it all down - an Italian blood orange and grapefruit soda.  And all of that rarely put a dent in my wallet - it's definitely recommended for anyone visiting Chicago.  Massive props to the exceptionally friendly and helpful waitstaff who go above and beyond even in such insanely busy nights."
The strongest points at this place during this season are the fun open porch and the wide variety of wines (fair prices!). Food (and especially the pizzas) is also not bad at all. I would give 5 stars but the portions are small for the prices...
Tapas and wine. Service is great.  First date stop for sure.  Always busy but worth it if you have time to kill.  Valet parking is totally worth the $16 (includes tip)
Great place with great food and a nice vibe
"Actual quote:Hubster: Is this the best meal you've had all year?Me: .....yes. Yes it is.We came here because of the rave reviews and also its proximity to our hotel.Learning our lesson from the night before, we got reservations. At 8pm, it was  PACKED. Hell, at 10pm, it was still pretty packed. Despite this, service was amiable, quick and super enthusiastic (but not annoyingly so) and helpful.We ordered the duck prosciutto, fried calimari, beef ragu pappardelle and sausage pizza. Duck prosciutto may be the best combination of words in the combo of English and Italian languages. After decimating the first order, I ordered another and ended up taking it to go. The fried calimari was perfectly cooked, just a bit of chewiness and fantastic. The pasta was probably the best I've ever had. I could have eaten a vat of it myself. I'm pretty sure the noodles were fresh, not dry, as they were just unbelievably tasty and perfectly cooked. The sauce was meaty, flavourfu and just the right amount. I'm still dreaming about this dish. The pizza was pretty good. I don't love pizza in general, because I can't have cheese. Pizza without cheese is sad. They were very careful about topping only half of the pizza with cheese, and did their best to cut carefully to avoid cross-contamination. The Hubster really enjoyed his cheese-laden side.After this, the Hubster and I were full to the gills and exited with leftovers, which ended up being the fanciest breakfast anyone has ever had at a picnic table by an outlet mall. The atmosphere is crowded, loud, casual and cozy. It feels more bustly than busy, like you're at a super fun dinner party.For Toronto readers, this will blow you away: All this, plus a couple of beers and a 1/2L of red wine (a good one) came to less than $100 after tax and tip. For non-Toronto readers, this quality and quantity will easily run close to $150. EASILY. Consider yourselves lucky on this front, Americans.I'm counting this as a must-go when visiting. I can't wait to go back!"
"I ate dinner at Quartino last week while traveling on business.  Our group had reservations and although th rstaurant was very busy, we were seated immedietly.  The atmosphere is very warm and cozy, and despite the loud noise level we had a wonderful dinner here.  Our group of four ordered wine, appetizers, dinner, then desserts, all of which were fantastic.  The beef short rib, as well as the stuffed pasta was especially good.  Prices were reasonable and the service was prompt and friendly.  I'll certainly go back."
"Not a bad place, but I didn't eat anything to die for. The atmosphere was loud and boisterous, with the focus primarily on Italian tapas. Expect to order 2-3 items per person. I ordered the burrata, which seemed to be mostly tasteless. The sausage pizza was good, and probably the best bang for the buck."
My sister had a birthday and  I ordered a cake to surprise her. Instead of a cake the server comes to the table with  a candle sticking out of One strawberry. Enough said.
"Had no reservations.  They sat us on the outdoor patio.  Storm hit and there was no available tables inside.  Our waiter, Adam, was quick to actually create a table in the kitchen.  This had never been done but he made sure we didn't skip a beat and had a unique and great experience.  So ultimate service.  Food was also amazing!  Be sure to try the homemade pasta."
Great food and atmosphere. Service was perfect to - great balance of making sure our table haw hat we needed and not annoying us every 3 minutes. The food was spectacular and reasonably priced. I recommend the cheese fondue plate for an app. I gave it 4 stars because it is pretty noisy in there (but not deafening) so I wouldnt plan on going here if you're expecting a quiet sit down.
"I'd like to be able to review more restaurants from my recent trip to Chicago, but I liked Quartino so much that I ate there three nights in a row. I'd first tried it on a trip to Chicago a year ago, and was happy to find the service and food just as good as I remembered. I was in town for the Chicago Marathon, and even packed with hungry carb-loading runners, the service was friendly and efficient.Their flatbread pizza is terrific - very crispy thin crust, and not too much sauce or cheese. Two of their menu items are particular standouts: the caprese salad is the best I've had. It's made with thick slices of real buffalo mozzerella, and a deliciously sweet balsamic. If you're hungry (or have a friend with you to share) try the Salumeria Tasting. It's a generous portion of meats, cheeses and ""spuntini"" (small sides such as roasted beet salad, pickled vegetables, and the like). I'm a big eater and it was too much for me to finish on my own.One of the bartenders, Rob, deserves a special shout-out. If he's working I strongly suggest you sit at the bar and ask for his advice. They have a large selection of wine, by the quarter-, half-, or full carafe. Tell him what you like, he'll let you try a taste or two and lead you to some interesting selections - and he won't try to up-sell you."
always a great place to be. great food. great value for money. great service.
"This place used to be one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city - but alas this place has gone downhill in a big way!  The star of the menu - the farmhouse chicken - was dry and flavorless.  The salmon smelled of salmon (!!) that is laid on a bed of mushy olives - eww! Love fish don't care for fish smell! The margerita pizza was OK - but still not as good as it used to be. And the shrimp polenta was just tasteless polenta with shrimp, cucumbers and other cheap ingredients thrown on top.  Whyyyy?? Where did the Quartino's that I used to love go?  It is very obvious that the restaurant had downgraded ingredients to a much cheaper quality to save on cost or a new chef has taken over the helm.  Sad - cause this place is primo location but now no longer a go-to Italian place."
The service was perfect. I went 3 times during my 3 day trip. Dinner -lunch- drinks ... My Bartender Eric was super sweet and remembered me when I came back. Very impressive considering how busy they were. He could tell I was not very happy and he listened to me and made me feel special. I wasn't expecting that in such a touristy spot.  Sam my server when I came with friends (which included a 2year old) was great. He was busy but we never felt unattended to. The food was awesome as well.lovedthe meat and cheese plate ..the pizza and the pasta... please go if you get the chance and tip well... they work hard and they deserve it!!!
Good solid choice - seating was fast everything tasted great. It wasn't top shelf though but it was a cool take on italian mixed with tapas.The service was quick and there was no wait. I would come here again.
"I had heard great things about this place from co-workers and was finally able to give it a try when my boss was in town. We came in around 6pm on a Monday night and were seated immediately; about an hour later we probably would've had a short wait. As soon as we sat down I knew I picked the right place. It has a very casual atmosphere perfect for dinner with coworkers or friends, perfect for a single girl like me who eats out with her guy friends a lot - I hate when places feel too ""datey"". But, it's not so casual you couldn't come here on a date. It's a perfect balance!The waiter asked if we had been there before and then explained the concept about how plates were normally meant to be shared among groups, and how the portion sizes would differ from your typical restaurant. We decided to just get our own ""entrees"" and so we both ordered salads, and my boss ordered a pizza and I ordered shrimp.The waiter also brought me several samples of white wine to pair with my shrimp, since I typically drink red. He was very knowledgeable about the wine without being pushy.I had the caprese salad, something I've been afraid to order since my trip to Rome back in 2009. It was just like being in Italy - the mozzarella was fresh and the balsamic was addicting! The shrimp entree was great; the only ""negative"" was my fault. I was expecting the shrimp to be over a bed of pasta but looking back the menu didn't say that. But it was still good! My boss let me try some of his pizza, it was EVOO-based rather than using marinara sauce. I was a fan.Overall not the best Italian I've ever had, but pretty damn close."
"Okay, it's about time I review this place seeing as my boyfriend and I have been eating here for the past 4 years and have made it our go-to restaurant...Quartino is an experience. It's a big space, but somehow still cozy and intimate. It's loud, but still romantic. It is a great place for so many occasions. I have been here for girls nights, my 21st birthday dinner with family (this place is Italian-grandma friendly!), with my parents, and of course with my boyfriend. Each time is an exciting experience and EVERYONE I have taken here ends up loving it and going back. I will say, for my boyfriend and I, the noisy and cozy atmosphere is a perfect date, but I could see how some people looking for a quiet, ""fancy"" evening would not want to go here on a date.The tapas Italian idea is genius. I am from a huge Italian family so during family gatherings I know the terrible pain of wanting to try everything but having eyes bigger than your stomach and getting full too quickly - the horror!! At Quartino I get to try every dish (yes, I am the annoying person who also wants to try everyone's food and will reach my fork over without asking to take a bite!). I have had almost everything on the menu over the years and I would have to say the pork shank and the pappardelle are my favorite. I will say the pork shank is a bit salty, but I love salt so not a problem for me!! Napoli style pizza is my favorite and lucky for me, Quartino serves it! I like the sausage the best.I fully admit that I LOVE bantering with the waitstaff no matter where I am. I know some people hate this, but I personally love to talk and get to know some good tips from my waiter while making witty conversation. The waitstaff at Quartino is extremely knowledgeable about the menu and very, very friendly (as an Italian restaurant should be!!). When my boyfriend and I went to Quartino over Valentine's Day weekend we had the most wonderful waiter yet - Joe! He offered awesome, honest advice on our food questions and had some great tips about the alcoholic beverages as well. He was very good to us and I am going to request him next time we go! Thanks Joe!Last but not least, the prices here are extremely reasonable considering the location of the restaurant and quality of the food. I will keep recommending Quartino to friends and family who ask for advice on where to get Italian food downtown."
Perfect date night spot. The small plates make it easy to share & try more. There aren't too many vegetarian dishes but enough to give you options. I've only been once but will definitely be back.
"What a great place for some great eats and people watching.  Sat outside facing State Street and enjoyed the view.  Oh yeah, there was great food and service as well.  What I loved was the European style seating for the patio.  Everything out front, cozy and simple.  Service was prompt without being rushed.  The small plates were just the right size of small.  Enough to share, but not so much you felt stuffed.  For something simple easy and great flavor and service, stop by and you will definitely enjoy yourselves."
"I made a reservation here 2 weeks in advance for a Saturday night. I am glad I did because the place was packed. I start off with some red wine by 1/4 liter. Not bad for $7. Their menu is pretty extensive and I wanted order everything since landing in Chicago.Here's what we ordered:The veal meatball slider are awesome. Wish I ordered more for $2/each.Bone Marrow: This was really good. The menu said horseradish gremolata. Taste more like garlic but it balanced the greasiness of the marrow really well.-baby octopus: very tender and well seasoned.-mushroom risotto: I felt that that the rice was slightly undercook and salty.-tortellini: Executed well. I love the prosuitto. -doughnut holes with chocolate dip: Perfect desert to end the evening. Holes were warm and fluffy, and chocolate was decadent.So much food at such a good price."
"Oh my goodness!    So good!   Made plans specifically to go back here  because of the outstanding homemade pasta- this is a staple go-to Chicago restaurant. Sit on the terrace, but wear sun screen for Gods sake!"
"the food here is great but the service is kinda meh. came here on a wednesday night around 9 and it took our server about 20 minutes to actually come back to our table after greeting us to order wine. it is very loud so don't come here expecting an intimate date. the tables are very close together so you can hear everyone else's conversations and pretty much yell to have your own.my suggestions are the eggplant parmigiana if you like lots of melted baked cheese, the crisp calamari is the best i have ever had- its not just a bunch of breading and the pieces are huge. the beef filets are super soft and tender, and the gnocchi is very good- i really like the pesto sauce. penne all a vodka is also a great choice if you prefer red sauce. as for the pizzas- the margherita is always a great and simple choice if you can't decide which one."
"Finally got here via a reservation: don't even try to just walk in without being given a 90 minute wait time at least.   Extremely crowded and very noisy, this is not for the romantic date or quiet evening.  Italian carb and oil heavy items, most were great, some just tasted like dough and oil.  Waiters are amazingly positive and quick given the chaos and the very little negotiating space between tables.   Best of all you aren't paying a huge amount for it all: most places with this type of popular atmosphere would make you pay for it but here it is reasonable.    I found the Cabernet Savignon, cheap version, horrible: splurge for the better wine or get something different.  Very easy to overeat after you order several small dishes for a group.  Great sorbet and fruit dessert served in a martini glass!"
Wonderful food. Crisp clam is the best. Get shrimp risotto! Beef short rib is also wonderful.
"Thank you chef John C for Quartino. As I sat there and was served the small (but quite filling) plates of Italian specialties, I forgot that I was in Chicago. I thought I was perhaps in a small place off the beaten path in the Trastevere section of Roma. Everything was prepared perfectly. Our service, the best I've ever had. Thank You, Thank You  and Thank You Chef John!!!!!!"
"Love the small plate concept...and they are quite generous with these ""small plates""Well executed.... with a crowd like they had, i thought it the service would be a bit off..but they were excellent.  The food was excellent.  Happy we tried it.  Veal meatballs, Bolegnese raghu, risotto, all excellent"
Wonderful dining experience!  Amazing staff and great food!  The pepperoni and sausage pizza was delicious!  The mint spring salad was great also.
Came here for a friend's birthday and it did not disappoint. So sad that we don't have Italian places like this in Michigan! The food was amazing! I loved that their kitchen is open late. The meat balls were incredible and the risotto was very good too. Yum! I can't wait to go back to Chicago and come back here!
"Service- Our server Aldo was very likeable, friendly, attentive and flexible (allowing us to do half orders for mixnmatch pasta/risotto combos). He was the right amount of informative and helpful by navigating us through the menu, without being pushy. Case in point- recommended four wines and provided samples to help my coworker make a decision. Awesome service.Food- GET BOTH VERSIONS OF THE VEAL MEATBALLS!!!! (You're welcome.) Homemade tagliatelle was fantastic, bolognese could have used some more salt & cracked pepper but definitely had that slow cooked flavor. Loved that nothing came out garnished with parsley on the rims of bowls/plates. Ravioli was just perfect- the pancetta was a crunchy salty delight! Risottos (shrimp, asparagus) were lovely, very fresh asparagus flavor... Maybe too strong for some tastes, but I liked it. Good god. The dessert. Zeppole! 8 of them for $5! They were gigantic and the dark chocolate was addicting! Wish I had room for the Salumi. Oh well. Bliss.Value- Exceptional."
"Great for last minute reservations for large groups. With a slew of new Italian restaurants that have opened within the last 3 months in Chicago, I would consider other: RPM, Nico Osteria, Cichetti, and even Eataly. However, if its a large group, this is the place to go."
The Alfredo sauce is heaven here. We wanted more and more. Absolutely fantastic highly recommended. We'll be back.
"Was surprised to find it was Italian and not Spanish tapas..but really enjoyed the food...especially the grilled baby octopus, salmon and gnocchi...dessert portion was huge...Will definitely go back to try out other plates"
"After hearing this place is so popular in Chi-town, my friend and I decided to come here for dinner. Warning though, you guys have to call ahead and make a reservation. Because I came here around 6 pm, it was so packed and I had to wait almost like an hour to get a table. We were so lucky (just a little) because just two of us. This place looks like a typical Italian restaurant like others around Chicago. Service was excellent and fast. They started off with biscuit for us while waiting for waiter. We ordered Fried Calamari as an appetizer. They were so good. My friend had chicken soup. She liked it either. After that we ordered pizza. The waiter told is everything every dish here is for sharing. Price and portion are reasonable. Nice and clean atmosphere. This place is kinda good with friends and family rather than for a date you know because it's always busy and packed. It's good for groups either. I might have to come back and try other menus. I love Quartino. One star off since it was so busy and kinda noisy for me."
"Came here with a group on my first night in Chicago. Awesome vibe. Casual, but very lively atmosphere. Everything is ordered in small plates for the table, and come out in no particular order. Our waiter was great (wish I caught his name!) and gave great tips on where to go out in downtown afterward. Food and drinks were both delish and prices were very reasonable. Glad we found this place!"
"Extremely friendly service. I accidentally forgot my left-overs at my table, and returned 20 minutes later to retrieve them. My waiter had already thrown away the leftovers, but insisted I wait as they placed a NEW order for the pizza AND pasta I had for dinner. Not only did I enjoy perfected Italian recipes, I also got to experience 5 star service"
"My wife and I ate here during our recent visit to Chicago and we loved it.  The food, service and value were excellent.  We are looking forward to eating here again on our next trip to Chicago!"
"The dishes were perfect for sharing, everything was fresh and well made."
"Food very flavorful and nice use of fresh herbs. Loved tapas portions to share. Service was quick and attentive. Everything we ordered had great presentation, flavor and quality.  Atmosphere was cozy yet chic. Outside dining was available too. Great vibe. Great food.  I would highly recommend."
"Food was good, not great. Service was very good, and the atmosphere was all right. Great for groups."
"The location, the food, the wait staff, the wine.When in Chicago heading here is a must do on your to do list."
The $25 sample set is about as good as it gets.  7 tapas of your choice served with olives.  Enjoy that with a $20 bottle of Italian wine with great company....  Life.  It does not get better than that...
"Came here with a big group of 14 for birthday party. They gave us a private area, which was nice, although the dining room still got very noisy as the night went on.Things were off to a good start: we order 3 pizzas, the texture was great, and the tomato sauce was very refreshing. The fried calamari was so good we had to order a second one because the first one disappeared in mere seconds.Unfortunately the entrees were all letdowns: my papardelle was so thick and bland it was like chewing beige carpet. The only saving grace was the flavorful meat sauce, but it wasn't enough to save the pasta. The risottos had good texture but came out looking gummy, like they've been sitting under a warming lamp for too long.Fortunately desserts were decent: tiramisu was light and airy, and the chocolate cake rich & decadent. I'd come back and stick with the pizzas, appetizers & desserts. The atmosphere was vibrant, but certainly NOT conversation-friendly."
"A litany of CRAP had been unloading itself upon us during a visit to Chicago and we were ready to kill each other or kill something cute, fluffy, and innocent.  No parking ANYWHERE (for less than 6.02x10^23 dollars per second, that is), I'd just discovered I left my driver's license at another restaurant the day before, and the car was starting to give off that ""hot"" smell.  You know the smell, the smell of burning money and road rage?  Yeahhhh.  Not good.We were also hungry.  Having previously driven past Quartino and relegated it to the ""Too expensive, and besides you're not dressed for it - No, YOU aren't dressed for it!""-column of restaurants in Chicago, a parking space opened up nearby and we shoved ourselves inside.  The air conditioning was like angel farts on our sweat-beaded faces and we too eagerly sighed in agreement that, though we'd try to eat frugally, we'd earned this treat.  Seated at a table near the bar, our server immediately took us in at a single glance. ""You two okay?!"" she demanded, no doubt wondering what grime the street just blew in to her surgically-clean section of tables.  It was a very comfortable arrangement, as long as we tried really hard not to look like a couple clods of Milorganite.  Thankfully, the restaurant was fairly empty, so we didn't have to try (fail) too hard (miserably).Amid the cooling farts of angels, we started to resolidify.  My lady brain kicked in and making ANY kind of decision off their menu was patently impossible, so our server suggested a staff favorite: fondue.  Shnibblets of prosciutto and bread and apples and probably some other stuff I can't remember appeared and then disappeared.  We had left Wisconsin for Illinois and what do we enjoy?  Cheese.  And it was GLORIOUS.  Still unable to choose this delicious thing or that yummy thing, our server suggested we split TWO delectable things.  We didn't see any mention on the menu of half-portions, and were very glad to take her up on her suggestion.   My partner-in-crime ordered the pappardelle -- one of the most perfect pasta dishes either of us had ever tasted -- while I *GASP* chose the asparagus risotto.  Quartino's asparagus risotto is exactly why I don't try to do risotto at home: the monumental disappointment would put me back decades in therapy.  Both dishes were the exact amount we needed and received no extra charge for the inconvenience of shrinking their size.  We lubed our withered throats and gullets with a pitcher of their house sangria (another suggestion from our genius server lady), a recipe which has ruined all other sangria recipes for me.  Damn Quartino's double-edged sword of AWESOMENESS.I do and I don't want to return to Quartino.  I do want to return because absolutely everything about the experience, from the gleaming look of their charcuterie counter to the bits of muddled fruit floating in my sangria, was spot-on fabulous.  I DON'T want to return to Quartino because I'm afraid of all the other tasty things they'll ruin for me."
"It's no secret that tapas are my favorite way to eat. You get to try a bunch of different things instead of just one, and to the people who say they're still hungry after a tapas meal, well... I don't know how. I think I end up eating MORE when I eat small plates. Anyways, this place does Italian tapas right. Highly recommended if you're in the downtown Chicago area. I had only had Spanish tapas until dining at Quartino, and it was so fun to try something new.Definitely make reservations, and if you don't like places that get really busy and pretty cramped, don't come here. I love the excitement and energy of restaurants full of people talking and laughing so it's right up my alley, but it could definitely be overwhelming for someone who prefers more of a quiet atmosphere. This place buzzes with excited diners, and waiters have to weave in and out of tables in order to get food to the right hungry table. Service was fantastic on my visit, drinks were always full, and the food came out surprisingly fast.I always feel like a giant hoss when I list out what I had at tapas places because I always order so much, but that's just the way I operate. Behold, the list of tapas I inhaled at Quartino:-Veal meatball slider, pomodoro sauce & Giardiniera-Veal meatballs napoli, sun-dried tomatoes & golden raisins-Polenta fries, red bell pepper salsa-Gnocchi potato dumplings, green Beans, potatoes, arugula pesto, & pork stock-Tuscan sausage risotto, tomatoes & fresh peas-Organic veal skirt steak, wild arugula, roasted grape tomatoes & balsamic syrupEvery single thing I had was fantastic. The risotto is a huge portion, and I'm sad that I didn't get to try the mushroom version. I don't think you can go wrong with this menu, so just close your eyes and point to something. Oh, and the sangria rocks, too.For just $28 each for three people, I'd say we got our money's worth. Put this place on your list!"
"Great location, lots of patio seating which is great on a nice day. This place is always busy at night so definitely I recommend reservations for dinner. The large selection of pasta and pizza are all delicious. The farmhouse chicken not so much. All the dishes are small for about $10 each which is cool so you can try a lot of different dishes or maybe you simply don't want leftovers. Good spot for a date or large group / family dinner."
"Excellent Italian dishes at reasonable prices with outstanding service.  Be sure you are in the Quartino restaurant side of the establishment, not the Pizza/Bar side.  Warm and Cozy, near elegant, environment with servers always keeping a keen eye, but not intrusive, on anything you might need (water, bread, refills, dishes taken etc).It's super convenient location to a hotel I frequent makes it a stop for every trip."
"Food is really good from the salads to the desserts.  Atmosphere is a little loud and a little too dark, in my opinion, but over all a great place for a casual dinner. Love the huge wine menu and being able to order different sizes.  Great service."
"It's time I write a review about this place.  I have been here many many times. Birthday parties, dinners, drinks with friends...always have had great service with a smile.  Food is great and not over priced.  Will continue to go here."
"Had great expectations based on menu, but they were partially disappointed by the food.I liked the vibe of the place and the business and chaos, but the food was a bit too much on the heavy/saucy side. The eggplant parmigiana was very nicely presented in a skillet, but it was over sauced and over cheesed. Good, but still a bit too much.I guess it is an Italo-american place more than it is Italian. Not bad, just not what I expected."
"One of my favorite tapas place in the city. Love everything here - the food, the decor and the service. The portion size is good and is priced reasonably. Its a must try place and I would definitely come back for more."
"After a long day, we didn't want to wait too long for a table at a restaurant. We called around, and Quartino said they could seat us with little to no wait, and as promised, we were lead to our table after only 5 minutes of waiting. Dishes We Demolished:+` White Bean & Garlic Spread - 4/5 - The spread tasted amazing with those thick slices of bread, but it could have used a tad more salt.+` Calamari - 4/5 - The crispy fried calamari paired with the marinara sauce was delicious!+` Sauteed Spinach - 5/5 - The best sauteed spinach... ever!+` Prosciutto D'Anitra Pizza - 4.5/5 - I actually liked the duck prosciutto paired with the peppery arugula, but the crust was too crunchy for me.  +` Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare - 5/5 - Shrimp, octopus, clams, and fish in a seafood tomato broth--this had to be the BEST dish we ordered tonight. The broth was phenomenal. Soak the bread in it! +` Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - 4/5 - The braised beef tasted amazing, but I still think the dish could have used a little more seasoning.Overall, Quartino makes amazing food and has superb service--the Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare is a must try!"
"After eating my way through the river north area, this is the first place that felt like it had both quality and a sense of heritage.  Light lunch of chicken soup, salami, and pickled veggies.  All were great."
"This place always surprises me!  it's amazing food at reasonable price.  They are authentic and genuine with their ingredients.  I believe so far i've tried almost everything on the menu here.  I absolutely love everything here but my favorites are the clams, be sure to ask for extra bread.  Their broth goes perfect for dipping.  Food: great taste always 5*Service: super friendly 5*Quality: nothing beats fresh herbs even if you ask for Oregano on the side with your pizza it's fresh cut! 5*"
"We visited Quartino in between a 2 hour wait for the Purple Pig.  While it wasn't a particularly memorable experience, it was a decent option to try out, given there was no waiting time to get a table.  Food: 3/5- The food was good, but no dish stood out.  It's a middle of the road culinary experience that you'd expect from a average Italian restaurant. Service: 4/5- Everyone from the hostess to the servers and bussers were nice.  We had a good time and were well taken care of.Environment: 4/5- This is a nice establishment, pretty much what you'd expect from a mid-tier Italian joint.  One funny thing I noticed was a semi-inappropriate old Italian movie that was playing on the tv, amidst diners of all ages, including kids. Value: 3/5- The portions were good and the price was right,Return?  Maybe.  If you're I'm mood for some drinks with food on the side, this place is a good choice."
The energy of this place is amazing! The food is mostly good for sharing and it is delicious. Only drawback is the extremely loud noise. You don't want to have a business dinner or any kind of important conversation here. Great for a celebration and hanging out with friends.
Met up with some friends while I was visiting the area.  Happy hour on the patio was great.  Went with one of the Salumeria tastings.  Food was good and service was friendly.  Almost went back for dinner - too bad they had a 2 hour wait!
"The folks that work here are sweet, but the food is just subpar. I've tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt a few times cuz it's so convenient for me, but after tasting broccoli that was beyond bitter and pasta that was undercooked tonight, that's it for me."
"Food is excellent, but the service is even better!Came here yesterday with a group of 12 people to celebrate bf's birthday and the service was unmatched.  Scott is not only great at his job, he's got a great sense of humor cause he whipped out (pun intended) a crazy surprise birthday dessert.The food was absolutely delish as always.  The only thing to know is that it gets quite loud, but that's part of the fun!"
"Oh Quartino, how I love you!I love the lay-out, the style, the food, and the ""cheaper than water"" wine! Great place to come with a group for a casual, but intimate meal. The service is great, the price are better, and the environment is flawless. There's not a bad seat in the restaurant. I love their tomato soup, my mom loves the small plates (olives, meats, cheeses, at the best prices in town), and my friends like their pasta dishes. I love the steamed clams, almost as you would get in New England, but not thaaat good! The complimentary bread is great as well! Their pizzas are perfectly thin and crispy and they have a wide range of combinations!And to the people complaining about the service, they tell you before you order that, because everything is made-to-order and does not sit under warmers, they bring everything out at different times. If you were going to be dramatic about it, get up and leave after they tell you!I have met the manager a few times and I am very pleased with every meal I have gotten there. I was lucky once to sit at a very intimate table with a friend over looking the entire restaurant and even served a complimentary dessert. I think this is my favorite spot in Chicago!"
"I had high expectations due to the high marks on yelp.  My wife and I split the 4 course meal offering for $35 at the waiter's recommendation, which made for a really inexpensive meal.  Our first dish was the veal meatballs, which were ok, but really rather bland.  We added some cheese and ground pepper, but they were still kind of flavorless.  The mushroom risotto was also bland--a large portion, but no flavor.  The best thing we had was the mixed seafood dish entrée--fresh and actually had some flavor to it.  The gelato desert was more like Neapolitan ice cream--nothing special.  We were right by the kitchen and the noise level was a bit high, but not worth complaining over, as others have.  It's an Italian restaurant, not a library."
Reviews were not wrong. Sat at bar and started with a veal slider which was outstanding. The bread and compliments were good. Did a half risotto - it was good too. The bartender was awesome - she was helpful and friendly and have great advice. Will come back!
"Italian tapas as good as it gets.  If you want to be social, come here.  Tutti a tavola a mangiare!!"
"This place is hit or miss, with none of the misses being that bad and none of the hits being that exceptional.  If you want a more tapas-style Italian experience you could do a lot worse.  Service was pretty good and atmosphere was okay.  There are certainly better Italian restaurants, but it's also way above an Olive Garden experience."
"Went here on a Wednesday night with a girlfriend. We had very attentive service and the food was great! It is Italian small plates which are great to order a few and share with a friend. A little expensive but given its location, did not surprise me at all."
"Oh my, this place was not good.What is going on here.Bland. Bad service.Loudest room in the city (might I dare say).Bland....Again.Every single bachlorette party that was in the city of Chicago that evening.Do they do special advertising:""if you are wearing a banner, high heels, a veil with penises attached, Quartino's caters to you!!""Pizza Marinara, awful.Dates with bacon and blue cheese, awful. Bone marrow, prepared liked baked clams, Why??Olives and eggplant parmesan.Not a single item that I would order again!2 stars.Would have been one star other than the friendly bus boy and the nice floor manager."
"OK, first off, I am an Italian food SNOB, having grown up with a Sicilian mother and having lived in Southern Italy for several years earlier in life. As a result, I can be a tough grader on Italian restaurants, so keep this in mind as you read further.I arrived at Quartino slightly before my 6PM reservation, and thought ""What a cool place!"". People were sitting outside, along the street, and some were on the second floor balcony overlooking State Street (that great street). There was a lot of street and subway noise (a couple subway vent grates are on the sidewalk beside the outdoor seating), so I decided to get a table inside, as I was meeting 3 business colleagues and wanted a quieter atmosphere more conducive to conversation. When I got inside I loved the decor and ambience. Very much trattoria meets Italian deli; warm and inviting. Shortly after I arrived, 2 of the remaining 3 members of my party arrived so we were shown to our small table for four in the middle of the interior space on the first floor. We were amongst the only ones there, and the ambient noise level was acceptable (hint: notice this is the second time I've mentioned noise level and I haven't even gotten to the food yet).The fourth member of our party arrived a few minutes later, and oddly enough, that seemed to be the time when a large influx of other diners occurred. Our waitress came by and got our drink orders, and I could barely hear her. She was somewhat soft-spoken, though.She explained that Quartino was a different kind of restaurant, that the portions were small and meant to be shared, and that the best way to enjoy the menu is to order a few things and they would arrive as they are ready, then order a few more, etc., etc., until you have your fill. A huge stack of plates was in the center of the table to allow for a continual flow of new tastes and food.We ordered a round of beer and started off with a Quattro Stagione pizza, and olive plate and some veal meatballs. The olives were delicious, the veal meatballs were out of this World, however the pizza was a huge disappointment. The crust was horribly soggy and wet, and the toppings all slid off the crust every time we went to take a slice. Clearly this is because they didn't drain or otherwise dry the toppings adequately (my guess is it was the artichokes that flooded the crust), and water leached out all over the crust and other toppings. Absolutely inexcusable in a place that promotes its pizza as much as they do. The only way I could eat it was to smash it all together on my plate and scoop it up with my fork.The next wave of food was a decidedly better: decent fried calamari with rather bland marinara sauce, some excellent pork dish and very good gnocchi with a cheesy spinach sauce. After working our way through our ""second round"" and a few more beers, we moved onto the dessert. The dessert seemed to be more of an individual thing. One of our party ordered a raspberry sorbet and enjoyed it; another tried some sort of banana coppa thing and he said it was delicious; I ordered a plate of zeppole with chocolate sauce, and they were divine. Perfectly fried and the sauce had just the right amount of sweetness, bitterness and chocolate flavor. Now, as for the noise. It was horrendously loud once the whole dinner crowd arrived. I gave up trying to hold a conversation with anyone not seated directly next to me and couldn't hear a single thing the waitress said after taking our initial drink order. Sure the place was crowded, and yes the tables are close together, but my ears were literally ringing when I stepped outside, and didn't stop ringing until I arrived home after a 10 minute Red Line subway ride. I think part of the issue is the hard floors and tin ceilings provide no sound absorption at all. I dunno - but I do know this almost ruined the evening for me. I don't know if it would be any better outside, but I can't imagine it being worse, even with the street noise, cars and subways rumbling past. So, all in all, not a bad place. I'll may go back; will likely try to sit outside; and I may even try the pizza again, but absolutely no pizza with any topping that needs draining or drying or that contains a lot of water."
"Amazing!  I don't think I've ever eaten in such a large restaurant that had such an intimate feel.   Great service, great food.   We had olives, cheese, bread, osso buco, spaghetti bolognese, meatballs, and wine - served in carafes with small stemless glasses.  We only stopped ordering and eating when we were certain we couldn't hold anymore.  My husband got us to this restaurant through a recommendation from work and we were so thankful.  It's the type of place that makes you feel like you can't wait to get back."
"Quartino is one of my favorite go-to places for a fun night of good wine, good food, a fun and loud atmosphere, and reasonable prices.  They manage to create an ambiance that blends family style Italian hospitality with a trendy vibe that's appropriate for its River North location.  Be prepared to yell over the table to be heard - this place is loud!My favorite thing about Quartino is the fact that they sell their wine in a variety of serving sizes - the standard 750 ml bottle, 1/2 liter, or a full liter carafe.  This is the type of place you visit to have a few glasses of wine and enjoy your evening, and somehow drinking wine from a carafe only enhances the enjoyment.  They also offer 2-3 Wine of the Month bottles that are $20 each and make great table wines for big parties.Quartino's menu is designed to be shared and they have a great variety of pizzas, salads, risottos, and other small plates.  The bigger your group, the more opportunity to try a feast of flavors.  The shrimp small plate is delightfully full of garlic and a little hint of chili pepper.  The shrimp risotto is one of my favorite options; cooked perfectly and the sun dried tomatoes add a nice texture contrast.  The asparagus risotto is a great option for asparagus fans (make sure you love asparagus before ordering this), and very tasty.  The pizzas are served Neopolitan style and while I wouldn't say the pizza is extraordinary, they always taste fresh and homemade.This is one of the few restaurants in Chicago that I have no problem going back to again and again because of the always fun atmosphere, the dependable and sharable food, and the free flowing wine.  If you're looking for a quiet night out or a mind-blowing culinary experience, Quartino is not for you.  But if you're looking for a great time with friends or family, friendly service, and yummy and hearty food, Quartino is a perfect choice."
"Seating was fast in the wine bar, and the food came out pretty quickly but it left something to be desired.We ordered several plates, salads and pizza, including: caprese, baby spinach, minestrone soup, eggplant parmesan, ravioli and a spinach, pepper and mushroom pizza. The pizza sauce was fresh tasting but a little bland. Overall it was just okay. The eggplant parmesan was overly mushy, salty and greasy for my taste. I would also pass on the baby spinach salad in the future. It's dry, with a few thin slices of raw pears (typically they are carmelized in my experience but I'm no chef), what seemed like just a drizzle of balsamic vinegar on it, and sprinkled with walnuts and grated ricotta. The plates also stacked up quickly on our table and several people came and went without taking them. We found ourselves staking them strategically under the pizza stand. Would we recommend to a friend? Probably not, unless you are going for the pizza based on our experience tonight. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great."
Nothing bad to say!  Love it!
"food is really good, not great though. But it's not expensive, especially compared to everywhere else in the area, and is quick with great service. There really isn't much to not like about this place. Definitely recommend if you haven't been. I eat there at least twice a month, if not more..."
"Quartino's is nice. It has a bunch of charm and the food is yummy. We had the gnocchi, Polpettes (veal meatballs), asparagus risotto, and the brussels sprouts. All were delicious, large portioned, shared plates. We sat upstairs on the two-top next to the bar and the fireplace. That would have been nice if the girl at the bar wasn't hitting me in the head with her butt every so often. And if the table were a bit larger. The table comes with a stack of plates on it already. We had to have it taken away and just eat out of the dishes our food came in. Which was fine with us, but thank goodness the plates come out when they are ready, rather than all together. There is no way we could have fit more than 1 1/2 plates on there... plus there is the bottle of wine, glasses, candle, breadbasket, etc. to consider. A look around made me think the other tables (because granted ours was probably a bar table) were having the same issue. This is a more casual restaurant with a couple of bars and great atmosphere. My only gripe was that it got WAY  too loud in there. We were barely 2 feet apart from each other and could hardly hear anyone. Also, heads up, they have restroom attendants. So bring a few bucks cash with you to the loo. Overall, I would go back, but definitely not at night and I would sit far away from the bar and staircase."
"Very very nice restaurant! Took a reservation on Tuesday May 20 at 8:00pm. Right on time with a table for my family. Do not hesitate to share dishes. Food is excellent, and Scott is an awesome waiter! We had a lot of fun, and will come back for sure on our next trip in chicago!"
"This is one of the only places I found by Signature Lounge that was open late on a Tuesday night- Tried Brushetta, Veg Pizza( all I could taste was salt) and the arrabiatta sauce pasta. Just the pasta was edible. Parking was hard to find. Water seemed unhygienic. Staff wasn't very atttentive.I won't be going back."
"Kind of torn between 3 and 4 stars, but it was SO LOUD in the restaurant that it honestly just was not an enjoyable experience overall. The food was perfectly fine and the service attentive and friendly, but I wasn't wowed (especially after all the hype I'd heard surrounding this place). Veal meatballs were pretty good, and I enjoyed the prosciutto di Parma and mushroom risotto. Don't come here if you want to actually be able to talk to the people you're eating with, though. For the price, you can get better food and a better atmosphere."
One word....YUM! Went here with some girlfriends before a Yelp event and it was SO YUMMY! My friend  had been here before and described it as italian tapas...and it totally is! They're great small to medium size plates to share and makes an awesome meal. The staff was very helpful and the waiter was the perfect amount of attentiveness. They came back enough to make sure we could order any time we wanted.
"Yummy pasta and pizza! Atmosphere is lively, service was excellent!"
"Awful service and mediocre food. The pasta we ordered came out pretty quickly which was great,  however,  the noodles were undercooked. The noodles were also a little dry so we asked for a side of additonal sauce. The sauce arrived about 15 minutes later and by then the noodles were cold. The sauce tasted like tomato basil soup (not what we ordered). Oh, I almost forgot to mention the chicken in the pasta. The chicken was dry, unseasoned,  and still had the fat on it. Finally,  the set up of the resturaunt made the entire situation even more awkward. The tables are facing in every direction so there's no clear path for servers to walk through.  Instead,  they weaved in and out and around every table which caused us to constantly get bumped or fear that they were going to spill something on us. Overall, I considered it an epic waste of my time and money."
"One of my favorite spots in the city!! I'm here perhaps once every-other week. On Fridays and Saturdays, IT WILL BE BUSY!! Shame on you if you expect to be seated without the rest of your party. They have two gorgeous patios, one upstairs and one down. For best service, sit at one of the full-service bars.  (Table service is still great, but a bar is able to offer expedited service!) The bartenders are terrific- if you don't know Italian wine, don't be too shy to ask one of their knowledgable staff members, who will put it into pedestrian terms for you. I find the wine a good value; it isn't sold by the glass, but rather by the ""quartino"" and other increments of a liter. I'll be honest, I don't care for the roasted tomato soup, but it's a matter of personal preference. Try the pork shank, as well as the risottos: They're unreal."
"This is a really great place to pick up a delicious, unpretentious Italian lunch, and fall asleep on the drive home after.  We shared a garganelli with lamb ragu, calamari, and linguini with clams.  The calamari was light and fresh.  The garganelli was like eating a stew with noodles strewn on top, and was a bit heavy/salty for lunch.  The linguini, on the other hand, was a bit under-seasoned.  They were both really tasty though.With places like the Olive Garden charging a twenty bucks for a bowl of shitty nuked pasta, it's nice to see an Italian restaurant charging prices that don't make me want to order unlimited breadsticks and soup and deliberately knock them on the ground for an hour and a half."
"An awesome italian pub! The best foundue, awesome italian ""tapas"", and great value for money. Also had the veal meatballs, the octopus, and the mushroom + truffle rici: all great options!"
Obviously the verdict is in on this place. It really is amazing. Deceivingly huge space that accommodates many people even on the busiest of nights. Bartenders are fast and friendly. In fact the servers we have had are all super friendly. Food is delicious and fresh.  The energy in this place is electric. This is the place we go to on a Friday night knowing most restaurants are busy.
This was my first experience with Italian tapas.  It's very similar to Spanish tapas.  Don't bother going to Quartino on the weekend if you don't have a reservation...you will wait forever.  It's a big restaurant that can get very loud and it's difficult to talk. The food is great and priced similar to spanish-style tapas restaurants.  They also have a Gluten Free tapas menu which is very helpful!  They have good Italian sodas as well.
"This place was conveniently located a few blocks away from where we were staying at and was open till 2am.  Works for me!There was a lot to choose from - too much that I found their menu to be a bit overwhelming.  We really didn't know what to choose so we asked the server to suggest what was best for us.  At the end of the night, I wasn't impressed by the food - it wasn't bad; just not noteworthy.  I don't see what the hype was with having over 1000 reviews and rated at a 4.  it was just ok to me.  Reasonably priced, nice ambiance, staff was friendly,  centrally located downtown Chicago...and food was ok...3 stars."
"It can be a little hard to navigate through the plethora of restaurants that River North has to offer, but one that always stands out to me is Quartino. I've been here a couple of times, and it's good for large groups or just to grab a few drinks at the bar. The first time I came here was a work thing. We got to sit upstairs and had excellent service all night. Food kept coming and it was all good. When another friend and co-worker was in town, we decided to have drink and I suggested Quartino. We sat at the bar and sipped on their divine lemoncello martinis. You only need a few of these to start feeling happy. Luckily, our lovely bartender gave us a pizza. Yeah, seriously...just gave us a free pizza. Maybe someone had gotten a wrong order, but we reaped the rewards of that and had a lovely half cauliflower and half prosciutto and arugula pizza, so tasty!  Definitely recommended."
"Went for an early lunch and sat at the bar. The bartender (Ivana) was incredibly friendly, knowledgable, and efficient. She recommended the polpette (1/2 order) and the steamed clams. Both excellent and more than enough). The polpette were veal with a really nice sauce and a touch of house made ricotta. The clams were in a broth of white wine (Pinot Grigio?),fennel (not overwhelming but present), red peppers, shallots, garlic, capers, and a little parsley - slamming!  I had a quarter liter of the Alexandre White Bordeaux, smooth with pleasant acidity and nice finish. Ivana bought me the wine after she found out I was there in town for my birthday. Total bill (including the wine, before tax & tip), $24.00. She also provided other great recommendations for while I was in town. The space itself is in a new building, beautifully appointed with retro (real) fixtures and finishes. Excellent choice."
"Good food - very affordable, small plates. And sangria! How can you go wrong? :)"
Went to Quartino twice for Lunch this trip!  We had the menu for 2 .....it was great both times!Service was good overall. Second time around we had a fabulous waiter!Will definitely go back when in Chicago.
"Quartino was busy--very busy--and loud with many tables that were big.  It wasn't a place for a conversation.  At times it was frenetic; and even though one is sitting down for dinner you have the feeling of all those waiting for a table.But you also understand why people are waiting for those tables. It is the food. It is authentic and so good one can't help but over-eat. Impossible to stop. Start with the goat cheese and bread and then make sure to try pastas, pizza and then risotto (of course this was the one item which seemed to get lost while getting to the table) followed by shrimp and veal osso buco done to perfection. Beef it great too.  Of course our table shared everything and every dish came back empty.  Pizza with ricotta and basil worked well. In hindsight skip the salad because one needs to save room for other dishes not available outside of Chicago. Make sure you also go for the wine.Service is well explained that things come from the kitchen when they come from the kitchen. It works except when things are lost because there is no conductor really watching over the table---when food arrived we confirmed among ourselves what had just arrived. I will be back but not for a quiet meal--no this is a festive loud place on a saturday night where everyone is going very fast and producing a wonderful experience for all--authentic and delicious."
"My husband and I had a fun and relaxing after work dinner at Quartinos.  The restaurant was busy with a lot of great energy.  The food was delicious and the service excellent.  There is no better pizza in town and the pasta with beef rib ragu was beyond delicious.  The chocolate fondue with fresh fruit was to die for.  The hostesses were all friendly and the manager, Adam, made sure all was superb.  We loved our seat at the window.  A great dinner!"
"I have come here for lunch, for dinner with friends, as well as for a couple events.  This place is solid, although it is LOUD unless you come for a late lunch.  The service is timely, and their menu is delcious!They have  ton of space and their approach to serving food is, first ready, first served (re: don't expect to have a 3 course meal in order here- if your pasta is ready before your soup, you will get pasta first.) A few recommendations:the white bean dipolivescaponatathe gorgonzola cheesearugula pizzaGreat for sharing food with a group, or if you don't really feel like chatting with someone but are fine shouting drunkenly at them. (Since everyone else is doing it, it adds to the ambiance.)  Come here in late afternoon for a lunch where you can converse, otherwise remember to shout from your diaphragm."
Went there for my birthday this year. They were able to accommodate us very well. We had about 12 people. The service was great. All the food that I had and tried off others plates was delicious. Definitely recommend to those who are looking to feed a larger group in River North.
"Always very busy! Make sure to place a reservation.Food was average at best. Service was very fast, they bring out food as its prepared. We ordered several items to share. The pizza was actually pretty good (4.5 / 5 rating)! Also had veal (2 / 5 ), pear & spinach salad (2 / 5 ), calamari (3 / 5 ) and  bruschetta (2.5 / 5).Atmosphere is fun and casual. I would go back for a Happy Hour --to grab drinks and a snack, but probably not for a full meal."
"Excellent pasta!! We were a little worried because they only have small plates and we were only able to get bar seating but totally worth it. We got the bolognese pasta and the pasta and both tasted really fresh, the pasta in the bolognese tasted very fresh and homemade. Go here if you're looking for some good Italian!"
"Oooooohhh so many reasons this is one of my top favorite restaurants in Chicago.  So let's begin, shall we...-The bread slicing machine is A-MA-ZING!  I wish I would have inherited one of these mechanisms from my grandma.-My OWN plastic Italian Grana Padano Parmesan cheese grater!!  Plus EVOO bottle at each table!  I could write a review solely on this...-Tapas/Small plates dining make you feel like you ate less, even though in reality you don't (whatever helps the psyche); Plus most dishes come in half sizes, including desserts-Wine choices up the wazoo plus three sizes to choose from: 1/4 liter (~1 glass), 1/2 liter or 1 Liters (~8 glasses) all organized by color/hue (red, white, etc) and taste/boldness (light, medium, full).-After your wine arrives, you can't pass up the Salumeria Tasting: $25 for your choice of 2 Salumi (Salami), 2 Formaggi (Cheeses), 3 Spuntini (Spreads), and an assortment of olives.-Carbs-galore!  You know you love 'em!  Freshly baked bread, freshly cut pasta (homemade and of all shapes and sizes), and freshly cut cheese, YUM!  I strongly recommend the Pappardelli al Sugo di Manzo (pasta with braised beef tomato sauce), Gnocchi (with potatoes, green beans and arugula pesto), and their Chicken Parmesan (humungous and so delicious it's not even on the menu--only regulars know about it!).-Dessert is to die for!  Go for the tiramisu or profiteroles and you don't be disappointed!-Wicked fast order-to-table timing, said.-Gluten-free menu for those we love who often have to avoid Italian cuisine.-Stellar service in a vintage decorated space that resembles an Italian market.-On OpenTable (100 points, cha-ching!), and the ability to avoid most tourists.-Outdoor seating just blocks from Michigan Avenue with a square-on view of the Trump Tower (a larger sidewalk patio is on it's way).If only they could get rid of those bathroom attendants that make everyone feel awkward (I'd promise to not pee on the seat if they wouldn't offer to squirt a blob of soap in my hands, hand me a tiny sheet of paper towel and then expect me to tip them), I'd be one happy person."
Good prices but middle of the road Italian. All my food needed salted which included the artichoke appetizer and spaghetti. The prices are decent so if you have a group and want a cozy atmosphere it's a good option. The upstairs has a nice fireplace but seems to be the overflow room. The doughnut desert is delicious and you get around eight pieces which is enough to share with 2-3 people. Pasta course is small. We didn't share as my guests wanted their own things. Chicken was moist and sliced which was good.
"Post dinner at motoNot bad at all!Tasty pizza  packed with veggies, including hot red peppers. Great inexpensive by the glass tons of choices. We had a very reasonable valpolicella.Would revisit."
"Rissoto Good. Clam Linguini Good.Wine. Bad.Service. Relatively slow, especially order taking.Sorbet (orange and raspberry) ok."
"My girlfriend and I ran into this place by random on a weekend vacation. Great choice! Great relaxing atmosphere, good service, and tasty food. The duck prosciutto and beef short ribs were delicious!"
Had a vegetarian business associate and this really hit the spot.  I recommend the Fondu and the Kale salad.  Great energy and the prices were very good.  Service was attentive and helpful.  The pizza I would prefer to be cooker a little longer.  It was a little soggy for me liking.  I like the wine list and opportunity to order just a half bottle
"This restaurant is beyond amazing. I've eaten in many restaurants that consider themselves Italian but Quartino is as authentic as you can get. They have lots of vegetarian and vegan options. Our server Stephen actually pointed out the options that are vegan and vegetarian, so it was a lot easier trying to pick something. You can never go working getting a pizza at this place. The crust is phenomenal. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a taste of Italy but doesn't want to spend $1200 for a plane ticket."
"Went there from work. Didn't have to pay ... sooo that was good. But that where it ends with the positive.The place is huge, the cram tourists in from organized tours, party events and try to get them out as fast as possible. Nothing of what came to the table was good. Everything (except the bread) was greasy: meatballs, pizza, veggies, ..... The tiramisu was lacked espresso for the ladyfingers, the ladyfingers were soft, no amaretto, ..... Stay clear."
"5 stars for the impressive food.  5 stars for the service.  1 star for the unmitigated disaster masquerading as seating.  Get it together on the seating---which is so oppressively awful that it distracts completely from the quality of everything else.  Chairs rickety, too small and uncomfortable.  Tables piled on top of each other, constant bumping from all sides, and table surfaces entirely too small for a meal that, by design, is going to include many plates and dishes."
"The meal started out with delicious fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We asked for seconds of this. I'm a bit embarrassed to say this was my favorite part of the meal. Ordered the gnocchi and the Popeye pizza. The gnocchi was covered in a bright (both in color and flavor), fresh sauce. Actually, it was so fresh that it rather reminded me of grass. Surprisingly, it was the first gnocchi I've ever met that I actively did not like.The Popeye pizza, which is a thin crust pizza topped with a huge pile of fresh spinach tossed in lemon juice. There was too much lemon juice in my opinion. Again, the flavor could be described as overly bright. The restaurant is huge, dimly lit, and very noisy. It's pretty boisterous--this I liked. But other than that (and the bread I suppose), there's not much to recommend this place on. With all of the great Italian places in the city, I'd pass on Quartino."
"I'm so happy I finally got a chance to try this place! I have been running by it during my Yelp research but never got a chance to check it out until I was in the area with a few friends and was trying to find a late dinner for a group of 5. I love a spot that takes reservations online and I can get confirmation right away! We were able to share a few things and a couple pitchers of sangria and spent just $25 a person! The sangria was pretty good.. I wish I remembered what we ordered but everything was great! I believe we shared 4 items (4 guys, 2 girls) and we were good! We of course then shared two desserts which stole the show! We were full, happy and didn't empty out our wallet!"
"Great food. We just got the pizza- I went with my parents and they were a bit overwhelmed with the tapas idea, so it was just easier but very delicious. I'd love to go again for their tapas. The enviornment was okay? Of all the hype I heard abotu this place I thought it would be way nicer but I feel like it's an average place."
"Wow, the noise level gets REALLY energetic in this place.  Bring your outdoor voice to converse with your dining companions!I liked the meal from my first visit better.  On this occasion, I tried the mushroom pizza, but it was much better flavor-wise in my head.  I tried a pal's mushroom risotto, and the flavor tasted more artificial than fresh.  Don't skimp on dessert though - those zeppoles (fried dough balls) are da bomb!  It's +$2 if you want both the chocolate and honey dipping sauce, which our waitress failed to tell us."
"Great small plates, of you don't like to share I would suggest ordering a few things for yourself. Great pizza and meatballs, great wine list. Wine by the liter, great food awesome balcony seating"
"Idk why but Chicago's restaurants are just taking over my mind right now! I'm actually not from around Chicago haha. Just visiting a friend & she suggested this place since she went here before & said that they have amazing ""tapas"" style dishes that you can share with the whole table.*** Your meal comes with freshly sliced sourdough bread with butter !! ***Ordered:- Linguine with clams - DROOLING just thinking about this. It had SOOOO much clams in here, it almost seemed endless! And they cooked it in white or red sauce (we chose white) and seriously..... it was cooked to perfection! It was spicy too.... and you know you can't go wrong with a spicy dish!- Calamari - Been craving calamari for ages and this place was so delicious. It was baked / fried just the right amount. Came with marinari sauce, YUM! I could not stop eating this dish........ it was just that good.- Arugula salad - This started off our meal just right. Lots of greens for healthiness. It came with pine nuts and orange slices. The lemon zest of the sauce made this salad really tasty. It wasn't too overpowering so you could basically eat this salad forever haha.- Parmesan eggplant - This was my least favorite dish because I'm not a big fan of eggplants & the cheese was wayyyy too much. It was literally a FAT blanket of cheese over a thin amount of eggplant. Meh.I also loved the venue of this place. It's really a type of friendly group restaurant. But i also saw families, couples, kids. It's really a great place to eat with just about anybody!"
"We had the BEST experience at Quartino!  Our waiter, Mike, was helpful and attentive and gave great suggestions not only on what to order but what to do with the rest of our time in Chicago. Oh, and the FOOD. Delicious. The pasta was fresh, the beef short rib was tender, and the dessert - amazing! If we lived in Chicago, this would be a regular spot for us. They were also so friendly to tourists! Highly recommend!"
"If you love Spanish Tapas - Quartino's is the Italian version. The staff is always attentive - helpful with the menu to explain it if you have not been there before. There is always a line to get a table - best thing is to call ahead for a table, but you can sit at the wine bar for a drink before your table is ready. When the weather is warm get a table outside great for people watching. But if inside they run old Italian B Movies. When I go this is what we eatGet the assortment of olives easier than trying to pick a certain plate.Roasted Peppers Hand Charred it comes with Capers, Garlic, & E.V.O.O Duck ProsciuttoPizza - Margherita Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, & Sweet BasilBut if you sit in the wine bar - OMG even better small plates.Dates Wrapped in PancettaVeal Meatball Slider Pomodoro Sauce & GiardinieraThis is just a few of our favs."
"First things first, to echo many reviewer's sentiments - this place is loud. Not to be confused with energetic ambient banter loud, I mean ears hurt a little and you have to shout to your table mates to have a conversation loud. I love a good bustling, busy restaurant but this was almost uncomfortable.We made a reservation at 7:00pm and waited about 5 minutes for our table to be ready, which is fine. But we waited another 10-15 minutes or so for anyone to even come speak to us. By then we had a drinks and first courses picked out and in famish pecked at the bread. The waiter was nice enough, if not a little pretentious. Our food came quickly and we were please with it's presentation.The taste was a little less impressive. We were so happy to see the many vegetable options since most of us are pretty health conscious and meatless, but the delivery was questionable for some of the items. The caponata was delish as were the beets. The artichokes were bland and the roasted peppers - I have never actually had a red pepper that literally tasted like nothing. But alas, these peppers were pure texture and zero taste. Not to mention everything was drenched in olive oil. The cavatelli was delicious as were the cannelini beans. The spinach and broccoli raab were not memorable - no seasonings or flavor.Overall, it was ok. Nothing truly offensive, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. By the way, as intriguing as the grapefruit or orangecellos sound, don't indulge in that curiousity. Ick."
"I want to give Quartino 3.5 stars, so I'll lean closer to a 4 than 3. My fiancé and I have been there more than once and went again Saturday for date night. Yes, the place does get very crowded and they do kind of cram you in there (small plates on a small table can make for a dinner long game of Tetris) but it's River North on a Saturday night...can't hold it against them for being successful.  The wine comes in very generous pours and it has always been my experience that the waiters will help with small tastings to help you make a selection if you are torn. 5 stars there. We had the cheese fondue and a meat and cheese plate to start out, both of which were certainly good. From there I had a shrimp dish and the little lady calamari. Impression? ""Meh"" She ordered the profiteroles for desert and really enjoyed it while I had an after drink.  By then the place started to clear out a little and quiet down. The waiters are great and seemed in no hurry to clear our table, love that.  Overall:Value: 4.5Service: 4.5Wine: 4Food: 3.5 Overall: 4"
"Perfect spot to come to to start a long night out w friends! Perfect sized small plates, loved the penne w vodka sauce I think it was, and the pizza was pretty good too. Attentive server who knew when to give us space too. I will def be back to try other dishes."
"I've always been skeptical with restaurants that have tons of items listed on their menu. Certainly not on this one! Been here 3-4 times and tried different things, and all were good. Worth to try! Service is good but can be crowded during weekends"
"So my experience wasn't the most complete since we came here on a weeknight (and the place was beyond packed) at around 10:30pm (and it was still hoppin) AND we came strictly for late night munchies to fulfill our sweet tooth needs after having a drink or two at another place. We were happy that we were sat right away even though the outdoor seating was packed, yes at 10:30pm on a Wednesday night so I proffered to sit outside because the weather was perfect but beggers can't be choosers, right? We ordered the talked about Profiteroles and the doughnuts with dark chocolate sauce and both were delicious, Italian style comfort desserts. Prices were reasonable and the 3 of us shared the two desserts and left very much fulfilled. Service was okay, nothing to rave home about, place is cute and casual and fully accepted us tipsies. Will have to try the actual food next time :)"
"Really great for large groups. Food comes out super fast. Don't forget to ask for Tiramisu - it's not on the menu but sometimes they'll have it anyway, and it's DELICIOUS."
"What you must appreciate about Quartino is that it opens late. We're talking 2AM kind of late, perfect for the red eye traveler and clubber. It's located smack in downtown Chicago, so its easy peazy walking distance from hotels. We got there at midnight after our delicious treat at Mindy's HotChocolate. Quartino serves homemade Italian food alongside tapas. We ordered the Italian Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo and a side of salad. Ordinarily, the this serving would've not filled us (think individual size not family style) but we were both already full.The beef sauce was delicious with the al dente homemade noodles!Simple warm starter breads are included which we dipped into the meat sauce. I do bemoan not being able to try their signature desserts like the mini donuts!Other possibilities to try next time -- pizzas, cheese platters, and their desserts!Ambiance? Warm, cozy, and full of life! =)"
"Came here for lunch with three others on Black Friday. With their week day lunch special, got 6 courses in total for $50, which was really good deal. Highly recommend their pork shank, waiter said ""it's life changing"" and it came pretty close to it. Family style, sharing dishes, good time."
Stopped in here for lunch. Had excellent service and very authentic Italian pizza. Will be back here in the future.
"I have ONLY good things to say about Quartino. Let me sum it up by saying that I bring almost every out of town guest here and they love it too. Cheap wine, yummy food, good atmosphere, and great location, what's not to love? They have $10 bottles that they rotate, and while they do go with a shared plates style, the plates are not mini by any means, and if you are eating with 2 friends, each select a plate, and add on if necessary. As for the food, my go-tos are the pappardelle, any of the pizzas, and the arugula salad. I even took some vegan friends here and they have a number of dishes that are vegan friendly without lacking on taste and quality.For dessert, get the donuts and ask for both the chocolate and the honey sauces. Just do it.And the WINE. 1/4 liter, 1/2 liter, bottle, there are a ton of options and all reasonably priced to share or drink yourself.Go here in the summer and sit out on the patio, it's wonderful. Just beware of the crowds on big tourist weekends."
"Quartino's is my go-to restaurant in the River North neighborhood. They're priced reasonably, have great dishes and the restaurant itself has a great interior. It's a comfortable atmosphere, always with a good amount of people and usually a old vintage movie playing on their tv screens. It's perfect for multiple occasions, a nice date with someone, a casual get-together, or a group outting. The bar section is quite nice too, although I haven't ventured over there yet, but their selection of alcohol is mainly wine with some beers, at least in the dining section.As for food, there are some great items and others just mediocre. Their pizzas are really delicious and so well-priced (at most $13 for a full custom-made pizza), and the pastas are equally as good. I recommend the Linguini with White Clam Sauce. Some of their appetizers, soups and salads don't have as much to say, they're not bad but not noteworthy. So I would definitely go with pizza or pasta. Their style of dining is Italian style so everything is supposedly shared (if you choose to do so) which is really nice when you have a group of people to share among. I would highly recommend this place, it's got the right vibes and you can tell by how much business they get that they have earned their reputation in the area. On weekends and Fridays it gets packed, so I urge you to make reservations as early as you can or you will be waiting a while. Saturday is always busy, I called to make reservations on Thursday one time and they only had 5:30 or 9'oclock for dinner available for that Saturday already. Another thing I've done sometimes is ordered pizza that I can pick up without having to wait for a table, which if you call ahead only takes 20-30 minutes. Otherwise this is a perfect place to stop by for a meal on weekdays, when it's less busy, not much of a wait but still filled with people. Great place, good food."
"I really liked their gnocchi. The interior was also very nice ... dimly lit but crowded, a good place to go with a group of people. The crowd is busy and fun, and the service was pretty good."
"Family-style and FABULOUS!  Had a fantastic meal here tonight.  We had a large party and were able to score a reservation for 11 with just 3 hours of lead time on a Saturday night through Open Table on Yelp.  Food was great, waiters were attentive, and they earn bonus points for adjusting our reservation time by a half hour AND having reasonably priced valet."
small tapas place.Duck ProsciuttoAsiago VecchioTortelliniOrecchietteRigatonistrawberry Gelatieverything we ordered was delicious. they have house wines for 20/bottle.fun to go with friends to share and try new things.
"Quartino was the spot for our last meal in Chicago before we left for home. We stopped by for some lunch after doing some shopping nearby. The restaurant is quite nice inside.. I could see it being a good place for a first date, or to even catch a soccer game (I noticed jerseys hanging on the walls, and the servers were also wearing jersey shirts). I liked the atmosphere a lot, it definitely reminded me of Italy. There was an old Sophia Loren movie from the 70s playing on the televisions, perhaps to bring customers back to old Italy? We opted for the Lunch special for 2, where you got to select 1 item from the wine bar plates or soup and salad section, 1 item from the pasta/risotto section, and 1 item from the meats/seafood section. All for $25. Fiancé and I got to pick different soups (minestrone and sundried tomato), and we also picked the calamari and the housemade Tagliatelle Bolognese pasta. The food was good; my sundried tomato soup came with fresh parmesan shavings and a small sprig of basil. The calamari was well portioned and despite its deep fry coating, was relatively light and not overly salted. The tagliatelle pasta did indeed taste house made and I loved the chewy texture. I've been contemplating purchasing a pasta maker and this only makes me want to buy one even more, which probably conflicts with my goal of eating less wheat/carbs. Perhaps after the wedding? heh. Our server was friendly and attentive. The washrooms and bar located upstairs are also very nice and well decorated. For $25 we were stuffed and had to pack some food to go. All in all, a solid meal for our last day in Chicago."
"Really happy about this place. The food was out of bounds, everything was both creative and delicious. The plates are for sharing and though described as ""medium and small"", they can be quite large. Two of us couldn't finish the pork shank. The duck prosciutto was interesting. Definitely recommend getting a reservation. I've been here twice and it can get *extremely* crowded, it was absolutely packed the first time I went (a friday), and more normal on a wednesday. I'll be back to try their other things though."
Went to Quartino with my sister before a hockey game. I was extremely happy with the service here. While the restaurant was packed they were still able to seat us right away. Our waiter knew the menu well and was also really nice. The atmosphere is very tight. If you come here be prepaired to be right on top the table next to you. The Itialian Tapas idea worked out great here. The Cheeses and salami were very tasty. We also had the 4 cheese pizza and it was very good as well. Can tell everything here is made fresh and isn't frozen. The pizza was served piping hot and had a great crust. Overall a great meal with great service.
"I guess Quartino is now my go-to Italian place (because I like the idea of sharing food more than getting a giant entree for yourself). Everything's good here, but the sad thing is that I can't think of anything that really stood out. Nothing was to die for, although they were all very good. I liked the Arrabbiata, but that is one of the simplier dishes, and I somehow end up getting the cookie with gelato dessert. Seatings are tight, but that's part of the charm."
"While visiting Chicago recently for an extended vacation, my husband and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn at State/Grand (reviewed on TA), with amazing 21st floor views of the city, including a bird's-eye view of Quartino. To say this place is 'packed' every evening, would be an understatement. The 9 - 5 local crowd begins to filter in right after work, and dining goes late into the evening. Being a regular on TA and Yelp, I had done my homework and learned that Quartino is a popular place with both Chicago visitors AND locals (always a good sign). The atmosphere is friendly, comfortable, and very loud. (Think: gregarious dinner party with 50 of your closest friends and alcohol flowing - in a cavernous room.)  Yes, THAT kind of loud. The wait staff is friendly, efficient, knowledgeable, and extremely accommodating. We were lucky enough to meet Lanny, Alicia, and Jose on our Sunday evening visit. They were exceptional, to say the least!  Professionalism that matched a 5-star restaurant, but with the ease of a carefully-planned family function. My husband, a former Disney employee, and I noted the outstanding service.  This is a tapas restaurant, so the menu is pretty overwhelming with so many dishes from which to choose, if you're new to tapas. That's where your wait staff can help, offering suggestions - about pairings, how much food to expect, etc... Speaking of pairings, the red sangria was wonderful! And....  you can order just the size you want. I highly recommend a liter.... it's sublime.  The Husband chose martinis and wasn't disappointed. An excellent bottle of wine rounded out our over-the-top meal in this amazing restaurant. (We splurged a tad.)  Attire: dressy casual for evening - not too fancy, not too casual - 'city chic' or dressier resort wear would be appropriate: dark jeans, slacks for the guys, or a nice summer dress.   You'll find seating indoors and limited outdoors, though our HOT July visit kept us indoors. It's a great restaurant for couples or groups... like an Italian family meal, the chairs are pulled up to accommodate all who arrive!  I don't think I'd recommend this restaurant for families with small children/babies after 5 PM... not because they wouldn't be welcomed, but because of how loud it is.  We saw a few families with small children, (looked like locals), and they were leaving shortly after we arrived around 6:15 PM. We did notice a few teenagers with parents, and even they kind of looked a little overwhelmed at the noise and pace.  During the day, probably an entirely different story. It IS, after all, a very comfortable place.   Saved the best for last - the food:  WOW!!!  We tried a few dishes:  white bean and garlic spread with crusty bread, calamari with a house red sauce, beef tips, beef ribs, and gnocchi. All were outstanding, but the gnocchi and beef tips stood out as 'exceptional' - with rich flavors, perfectly cooked, and paired beautifully with red wine. Well into my 40's, I never truly appreciated the red wine/white wine pairing concept - and I'm a wine drinker who's visited Napa Valley a few times - until our visit to Quartino. The beef tips deserve a dry red wine.... mouth-watering!!   OUTSTANDING.  Be sure to visit the upstairs restrooms and check out the entryway as you go through their doors. Take a dollar or two for the lovely attendants in the RR.  To close, I'd like to send a BIG thank you to Adam and his entire team. Taking time to stop by our table to personally welcome us to Quartino was quite nice, especially during such a busy evening."
This restaurant is a great place to eat and hangout with friends. The food was good and the price was fair especially downtown Chicago area. They have freat choices of wine and you need to have wine with those italian food.
Good food. Don't feel that their clam is fresh enough though.
We had 7 people in our group and went for dinner at 930pm. It was such a blast. Sharing all the food was really fun and it all came out very fast. Though our waitress said it would be paced to come out it all really came out at once but that is just depending on when the food is done which we were warned on. Get the fondue if you have a group. It is really good and fun to all dip in it. Also the dates appetizer is amazing also. The biggest plus was how inexpensive the wine was! The meal was worth it for how cheap the entire evening ended up being for a lot of food and wine.Will go again with a group!
"We came with another couple for dinner, enjoyed the variety and quality of food.  Very busy atmosphere, and the waiter was very helpful with suggestions."
"Came here on a busy Chicago night, had a lovely seat on the terrace.We ate:- Dates stuffed with gorgonzola wrapped in proscitto (4/5): yummmyyyyy- Polenta sticks (2/5): Kind of bland- Lamb shank (3/5): Moist but couldve used a bit more pizzaz- Pizza (4/5): YummyI would go back because I loved the overall concept of tapas, allows you to try a whole bunch of goodies.Until next time!"
"What to eat when the business dinner reservation is not til another 2 hrs: soup, trio of olives, and a duck and arugula pizza.Ambience is lively.  Service is spot on."
We went with family of 4 on a Thursday night.  Food was great!  I love the smaller portions that are served family style.  Also liked that our waiter was attentive and gave great recommendations.  They do pack tables/people in but we had a great table near a cabinet.  Great food!  Go early if you don't like crowds!
"This is one of the best Italian restaurants i've had the pleasure of enjoying.  I was in Chicago for the IRCE show and had to take clients out to a dinner everyone would enjoy.  From them taking a last minute reservation, to our waitress, to the excellent wine by the carafe, and of course the amazing food.  I'm not going to list all of the dishes we had but they were all outstanding.  I highly recommend going here and enjoying a two to three hour experience you'll not soon forget."
"I came here on Ash Wednesday, so it was a no meat day for me.  I also just didn't feel like thinking (I had a full day with an 8hr red eye flight where I didn't sleep, work, Mass, and a manicure).  So I put my full trust in my server's suggestions, which was:Roasted Beet Salad (2.5) stars - I liked the subtlety of the ricotta.  I wish there was more.  This salad was definitely a plate to be shared.  If you love greens, you'll love this size portion.  But it was too much green for me with too little flavor.  Luckily, I was famished so I ate a decent amount of it.Asparagus Risotto (2.5 stars) - I felt so bad I didn't like this because my server said it was her favorite dish!  I just told her I ate the salad too fast & got too full, but it really was lacking any flavor.  I did taste asparagus, but maybe I'm just being picky.  I keep forgetting I'm not a big Risotto fan, but when a server tells me it's their fave - I can't not give it a try.Profiteroles (3 stars) - Although probably made in-house, these definitely came straight from the freezer.  I expect profiteroles to be easy to bite into.  These were rock hard.  Such a shame because the flavor was definitely good, especially the vanilla gelato in the middle.Service (4.5 stars) - I forgot my server's name, but it was actually her last week there.  Ironically, she was moving to New York.  But in any case, she was definitely sweet and adhered to my many tasting requests.  Eventually, she suggested a wine that I loved, which I, unfortunately, also forgot the name of.  Half a star off because I had to wait/flag her a few times, but it was pretty busy.Ambiance (4 stars) - cute, casual, intimate, great for a low-key date.I shared my experience with a few locals who all reacted the same way, ""Really??""  They couldn't believe I didn't love it.  If this were closer to home, I might give it another try.  But being that it's in Chicago where I only get to visit, there are too many other great restaurants to choose from that this meal was just not enough to bring me back.  I'm sorry, Quartino!"
"Such a cute little wine bar in Chicago.  I stopped here to meet friends in Chicago while traveling on the business.  The amount of wines to chose from is HUGE and the appetizers were delicious too.  In addition, the staff was welcoming and funny which made our happy hour!"
"The noisiest restaurant i have ever been in.decent food, relatively quick for a very busy and large place"
"I had been eager to go to Quartino after taking a cooking class by the chef at Treasure Island. He was a great guy, and we enjoyed the class and the delicious, simple Italian food with a focus on fresh ingredients. I kind of found the same at the restaurant but I admit I was a little disappointed. We went on a Thursday night and it was packed. It felt a little chaotic. Our server was super attentive and nice, though I did feel like he tried to get us to really upgrade our wine, which is a pet peeve. I said I like one type of wine, ask him to tell me about two reasonably priced selections, and he points me to a third, much more expensive selection. Grrr. I stayed with one of the moderately priced choices, and the wine glasses arrived warm, fresh from the dishwasher. Yuck.We ordered a few dishes and none really stood out. The broccoli rabe in particular was disappointing--full of tomatoes even though that was not a listed ingredient on the menu. The pizza was decent--the crust was actually quite good. We might give Quartino another shot but we won't be rushing back."
"Try the homemade pasta here. It was incredible. The service was excellent, and it is loud, can be crowded, but eating at the bar was really great. I liked that it was like old school italian. Thin style pizza, very italian, excellent wine lists, lots of great small plates."
"Amazing Tapas place. The food and service was awesome, had a great time. Would recommend! Has good vegetarian options."
Sausage-fennell pizza is AMAZING!
"Holy over-rated Batman.  This is the 42nd review I've written today and, by far, the rating with which I'm most puzzled.  Its not bad, but it's certainly not good.  I'll agree that the concept of Italian tapas is somewhat novel, but really it just equates to getting a greater variety of mediocre food.  I have a theory that the majority of the positive reviews are from out-of-towners in awe of its novelty.  I base this on nothing more than its location and my incredulity towards its ranking.On an aside: I'd say that around 30% of the time, when I was trying to coordinate the location for a date with a girl I did not know very well and asked her where she wanted to go, the answer would be Quartino.  Let's just say, at the very least, a girl who responded with that answer was playing catch up for said date."
"This place is ways crowded no matter what time. It doesn't start to die down until 11:30 pm, and even then the energy is great. The food is pretty damn good and probably the most authentic that I've had in the city. Great palace to go with groups. The staff is always friendly. However, a few of the hostesses seem to have a bitchy attitude. I wish it was just a little easier to hear everyone at your table since it is always so loud."
"I'm utterly clueless as to why people love this place.  Am I living on a different planet?!  Everything I've had here has been meh.  I recently went back just to make sure I wasn't crazy and tried totally different things with the same result.  The pizza (prosciutto) was meh, the mushroom risotto was meh, the veal meatballs were meh.  The only half way decent thing was the spaghetti with clams.  Once I added a little salt to it, the spaghetti was pretty tasty.  But overall the food was sooooo underwhelming.  All I have to say is this is not good Italian food.  I definitely won't be back unless someone forces me to go again.  On the plus side, this place has a great ambiance and good servers."
Excellent drinks and service. Love the patio in the Summer. Food can be a bit salty.
A terrific restaurant. Came here with my wife.. Had 8 plates and a bottle of wine and 2 coffees for $89. The meal was fantastic.. Meatballs and rigatoni were delicious. Coming back here for sure.
"had a great time with friends and price on the wine list totally reasonable.  Trying to catch up, in the loft upstairs, was impossible.  The noise level was deafening.  We tried to eat and flew out of there.  The pizza was OK, nothing to write home about. Calamari was great."
"Small plates at its best. Great friendly service and well crafted food. The dishes are not too artsy, but they are made with the great ingredients and care."
"I came into Chicago midday and my friend took me out to Quartino for some Italian tapas and some wine. We sat outside which looked picturesque, however the construction noise interrupted our conversation, but I blame that on the city of Chicago. We got their Rosso house wine which was surprisingly good, and their Taleggio & Grape salad with their raisin nut bread was a perfect pair. I ordered the braised short ribs which were fall off the bone and tender as can be! The salsa verde sauce on top was fabulous as well. My friend ordered the gnocchi which is made with green beans, potatoes, arugula pesto, & pork stock. It was very tasty with a light sprinkle of parmesan right on top. The best part, it was all at a ridiculously great price! Wanna be fancy on a budget? Definitely stop by this place. But make reservations if you are coming at regular meal times!"
"I've been to Quartino a few times before and while they never swept me off my feet, they were average. Last night's experience put a dent in that opinion. We were dining as a group and ordered some appetizers and main entrees. While we were told that all dishes are meant to be shared, everyone ended up ordering main entrée for themselves. In addition to my salmon I also ordered a side of potato puree. First strike came, when entrees started trickling in separately... My husband got his pasta, then some people in my party got their seafood orders and THEN I got my side of potatoes (2nd strike)... 10 minutes later came my salmon (3rd strike)... I'm not sure what serving school Quartino's employees went to, but by no rules is this acceptable! We were not sharing our dishes, therefore it is expected to have everyone's entree to be brought out at the same time! Lastly, to bring a side dish 10 minutes before the main dishes is just absolutely ridiculous! In all fairness, they did try to make up for this blunder by giving us free dessert, but just a word of the wise - make sure you make it clear that you want your main dish brought out at the same time if you're not sharing!"
"I think I was expecting too much from Quartino. The place is very nice, but the portions are really small and prices too high. Wouldn't go there again. Kind of disappointed!"
"This place is cool. Unfortunately my wife is pregnant and is extra cautious about what she eats. Usually this doesn't really affect me too much, well, when you are sharing dishes it does. So, we ordered a pizza, the heirloom tomato salad, and something else...I forget. I do remember ordering a 1/2 carafe of wine though. Unfortunately, my wife can't drink. Overall, food was decent, service was good, and the atmosphere was fun. Their menu had a lot of food that sounded good if the person you're eating with is not pregnant. I might come back again if I'm in Chicago."
"Great meal, friendly service and quite affordable for the portion size! Loved it! Especially alcohol that come in carafes. Highly recommend!"
"My friend and I stumbled into this restaurant on our last night in Chicago, and I only wished we would have discovered it earlier.The pizza is a thin-crusted delicacy that I easily could have had another slice.  We ordered the Margherita (Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, & Sweet Basil) pizza.  The basil was fresh, the cheese was the right amount. I asked for the cheese shaker thing, but I had no need to add more.We also ordered a 2nd dish b/c the server told us it was customary in there. We ordered the meat lasagna. Baked lasagna. YUMMY. I loved it.We also ordered wine, and being Canadians we forgot the difference in measurements and my girlfriend ordered the 1/2 litre glass which was immediately returned for the 1/4 one!The server was a delightful young man.All in all, my favourite restaurant experience in Chicago!"
"One of the employees at the James Hotel (just up the block) recommended we try this place for lunch, and we certainly weren't disappointed. Our waiter was very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient -- can't beat that combination -- and even better, the food was delicious! Truly fresh and reminiscent of the warm dishes I enjoyed while in Italy. Mmmm.They've got a great selection of dishes and offer an unbeatable lunch deal that includes 3 dishes for $25 -- that'll easily feed two people and leave you both full. Enjoy!"
"I don't know if I am spoiled by the tapas I usually have at home, but I was not at all impressed with Quartino, and I say this with an unfortunate note. We had 1/2 liter of the red wine sangria.  It was simply a-ok; it was lacking in fruits flavors.  We also had the angus beef carpaccio, wrapped dates, sea scallops and the steamed mussels.  The carpaccio was very fresh, served with sliced scallions and shredded cheese.  I highly recommend this dish. The wrapped dates were good, as well.  It seems that the dates were wrapped with a small slice of salami and drizzled with honey.  It definitely did the job for the sweet tooth, but I would have liked the dates to be wrapped with a small piece of bacon.  You really can't go wrong with bacon, you know? Sea scallops were prepared well; not too done, which is important for scallops.  The steamed mussels were returned because it was just TOO SALTY.  We tried to eat it, but we couldn't.  So we exchanged it for the shrimp risotto.  I can't say it was the best risotto I have had, but comparing it to the salty mussels, I would pick the risotto. One good thing about Quartino I would give a 5-star is the service.  Rio was our server, and he was very attentive (not to mention easy on the eyes).  The rest of the staff was also very nice and made sure we had enough water and the table was clear of clutters.  Like I said, I had hoped Quartino would be better, but maybe if I had visited with low expectations, then I would be a happier patron."
"Tapas, Italian style.Their Mushroom Risotto is to die for!It doesn't look very appetizing, but it's so yummy!The Veal Osso Buco was okay, I was expecting it to be a bit better, especially with reviews and the price tag that came with it, but I don't think I'd order it again. Also had the Dates Wrapped in Pancetta. They were pretty good too, but I've had better. The pancetta was cooked well, but the date was a bit off. Service was great. Quick and friendly.We had dinner here on a Friday night and it was super busy.I made reservations earlier that day, and I'm glad I did. The wait was ridiculously long without a reservation."
"My friend's parents took the four of us out to Quartino on a recent trip to Chicago. What a truly awesome dining experience.We had reservations, and we got a great table by the windows. The decor and atmosphere was pretty much perfect, and although they were totally packed the service was very attentive and accommodating when we kept ordering more.We split a carafe of red wine, which came in an old-timey glass carafe and was very tasty. We ordered several things to split, which is, I think, the best way to do this place. We ordered:Rucolina pizza -- topped with a heaping pile of fresh arugulaEggplant Parmigiana -- so good we got twoRoasted Baby Octopus -- the red chili sauce was greatChilled Zucchini White Bean & Garlic Spread Finished with Gorgonzola Dolce and one other cheese -- the apricot spread was fantastic and really complimented the gorgonzolaI loved the shared small plates, and since each item comes out as soon as it's ready everything is completely fresh and has an element of the unexpected. Every single thing was high quality, delicious, and well-presented. Next time I'm in Chicago I'm going back to try the gnocchi, the roasted bone marrow, the pork belly, the salumi... Oh my."
"I've been to Quartino before for dinner, but this 4-star review is for it's lunch special. It's a steal if you can make it on a weekday before 3. I got the Carpaccio appetizer, Orechiette, and Cioppino all for $25. All of the entrees were large for tapas and they did not skimp on the seafood in the cioppino. We added a marinara pizza and it was more than enough for 2 people. I would definitely come back again for lunch."
"I had always heard this place was busy. We tried to get a reservation for 2 around 5:30-6:00 on a friday night but they said they only had a 5:00 available. So we called back 5 minutes later and they said the 5:00 was gone and they only had a 4:30 available. So we said we will just walk in. We walked in around 5:20 and there were a ton of tables open and we got seated right away. The .place started getting packed around 6ish.My fiance and I got the:Garlic dip: It was ok. It basically tasted like garlic hummus. Nothing special.Dates: Absolutely delicious! I would definitely recommend this.Gnochhi: I was surprised it came with pesto instead of some type of red sauce... the pesto had almost zero flavor which made the gnocchi dish tasteless.Penne a la vodka: Very yummy!! The sauce was good.If you ask for parmesan, they will bring you a brick of parmesan in a container thing, and you can grind fresh parmesan on your food. Kinda cool. Their bread cutter was sitting across from us too which was cool to watch.So that's 2 for 4. I knew this was a tapas place but it was different than what I expected. There were only like 6 items on the appetizer list, then like 6 salads, and then a bunch of entrees. But the entrees were pretty much tapas size but cost an entree price. Also, the waiter was nice but we felt so much pressure from him to keep ordering more and more. And in the beginning, I told him I still wasn't ready to order (because I had no idea what anything was on the menu) and he said ""I know the prices are expensive... but"" and I was quite insulted by that..I'm glad I tried this place but I don't think I will return..."
"My FIRST 5 star review!Veal Meatballs- OMG I don't like raisins, but the raisins in this dish compliment the meatballs SO WELL!!HOMEMADE PASTA- can't remember the name, but the one with fresh ricotta- it was a vegetarian dish but I LOVED IT! (true meatlover here)Braised Beef- YummmSparkling moscato- DELICIOUS!!Zeppoles with dark chocolate dipping sauce :)My BFF made reservations here and SO GLAD SHE DID!!! :)LOVED IT, Service was awesome too :)"
"This is maybe one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago if I'm downtown. The location is perfect, a short walk from Michigan Ave. The staff is super friendly, and the restaurant itself is charming. The food, though, is where it's at. The menu can be daunting, but the waiters are super helpful. Their food comes small plate style and is meant to be passed around and shared. I was in a party of four, and we ordered five or six things to start. The food comes out as it's prepared (no courses) and each person ended up with a healthy three or four bites of each item. Enough to get a good taste without filling you up on one thing. The best part is that you can keep ordering more! The best bites were the tortellini, porcini and truffle risotto, and the calamari. I'm pregnant and have aversions to pork, but my husband and father in law said the pork shank was the best thing they ate. We all highly recommend the donuts for dessert - YUM.Anthony, our red headed server, was a tremendous help."
"This is an adorable little spot in Chicago with atmosphere galore + good wine and good service.  The only thing that wasn't good was the food.  I didn't love a single thing we ate.  The cheese and salami tray was just okay.  The cheese and salami tasted fine, but not fresh.  Of the 3 sides we chose - peppers, artichokes and beet salad - the first two were inedible.  The beet salad was good compared to everything else we ate.  We ordered the gnocchi and the tagliatelle bolognese.  The actual texture of the gnocchi was perfect, but everything they put on it was gross.  It was like they took every green vegetable in the kitchen blended it halfway added 0 seasoning and drowned helpless gnocchi in it.  The bolognese was unlike any I've had.  It had shredded meat, was super watery and tasted a bit like a stew.  Since the sauce was so watery it made it hard to get a flavorful bite.  I'm from Texas so it's possible this is a dish people actually like.  Lastly, we tried the Zepole, a doughnut funnel cake hybrid, with honey.  It was super heavy and the middle was dense not light and fluffy.  I would not order anything I had again."
"I do not understand the 4 & 5 star reviews here. We had a large group in a private room upstairs for dinner and while the service was good, the food was fair at best.  The 2 pastas I tried were boring and flavorless.  The salmon tasted like olives and nothing else. The filet was fair. The chicken was ok but rather dry and boring. The bruschetta was not great...the bread wasn't even toasted. And the fondue that people rave about? It was awful. The biscotti was so hard it was impossible to break it into pieces to dip in the chocolate. The strawberries were horrible looking. The pears and apples were ok.  I would NOT recommend this place to anyone."
"The thing that I really liked about this place was the fact that I could get smaller portions of various things on the menu. In this case, I got a small order of penne in vodka sauce. It was tasty and fixed my pasta craving. It wasn't the best I'd ever had but it did the trick.  I also had a salad with oranges, house made ricotta cheese and a very peppery arugula. The cheese portion was pretty skimpy. In fact, I thought they had left it off on accident since I had requested they leave off hazelnuts as well due to a food allergy. But under some of the arugula, were little blobs of delicious ricotta. The wine list was decent. I got a quartino to wash down my dinner and walked out satisfied without breaking the bank.The bar did have a funky mildewy smell that I got accustomed to after a bit and it was kind of dingy. I'm not sure if that was an old world ambiance or grime. Sometimes it's hard to tell."
"Fun place to share pizza, salad & wine! The food was good. The interior is nice, although they really crowd people in there so kind of loud."
"Best place to go for large groups.  We ate everything on the menu.  (OK, not really, but a lot.. ) And we had a few carafes of wine which our server let us sample first.... all for only $40 a piece.  Such a deal and the start of a great night for all!"
"I went here for my bachelorette party.  I really enjoyed the food!  I split the cavatelli amongst two others, plus a few other dishes.  Coming from someone who makes their own cavatelli, Quartino's was delicious!! I want more! I plan on going back so my husband can try it.  Also, the other dishes that I tried were the pizza (yummy) and the bacon wrapped dates (super yummy!). I also ran into a groupof high school friends who were also celebrating another bachelorette party.  Fun time!Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the pricing - kinda high, but you're in downtown Chicago= It's kind of what you should expect. :)"
"Great service in the bar area with really good food.  I had the sweet potato, sage and white onion pizza with the Asparagus risotto and they were both above average.  Great place to hang out and have a few drinks, they even gave us a coffee to go!"
"Get an early reservation (ours was for 5:30 I think) and go do something fun after!  They have amazing bread - All the food was superb, actually. The staff made us feel like family.  Our server, the maitre D. and even the bus staff all asked how we were doing and if we needed anything each time they passed by.  The wine recommended by the server was exactly what I had described that I wanted.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars were little nit-picks: when bread is provided, I prefer butter, or olive oil AND balsamic to olive oil only.  The roasted red pepper salsa that they served with the (incredible!) polenta fries, was completely overpowering. The table we sat at felt too small for the three little plates we shared - even though it was a table for four! I was extremely pleased with the adventure, and my dear friend and I felt pampered and sated...and it was early enough to still go roaming in the city!"
"We went here and it was a great meal.  We came with 3 people in the early afternoon.  The gnocchi, pesto canelli(sp) and brocolli rabe tapas which were all really good.  The pizza was also great.  There are a lot of options for vegetarians which is really nice.  We were seated right away and the service was excellent.  I would have come back if I had more time."
"Food was pretty good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion.It was also VERY LOUD and CROWDED."
"I'm really surprised to see that this restaurant has so many positive reviews. My friend and I were very disappointed with everything we got except for the wine. Since its tapas style we ordered several plates from the olives, Gorgonzola Dolce cheese, and artichokes to the octopus and Cavatelli. Unfortunately everything was so bland. It was such a let down especially since I had been wanting to check this place out for a while.Our server was nice but not very attentive towards the end of our meal when we were looking to get our check and then when we were looking to pay.The atmosphere has a cool vintage italian flare but that's not enough to draw me back."
"Italian tapas? SIGN ME UP.I have been here countless times and am never disappointed. If I have visitors in town, I take them to Quartino, order the cheese fondue, they are happy, and we all win. Pizzas? Pastas? It's all good. Wine's good. In summation: everything here is GOOD."
"Went here for restaurant week and order the pre-fixed 4 course tapas meal. Excellent Tapas dishes.  Started with Veal Meatballs Napoli - sooo delicious! Next was the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo (Tuscan Pasta Ribbons with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce) - quite good, but unforgettable.  Next was the Roasted Baby Octopus - my first time having octopus - it was different and chewy, but surprisingly tasty. Last was the Hot Chocolate Cake & Vanilla Gelato - phenomenal!  We also got a pizza to share but it was disappointing compared to the other dishes.  The crust was very limp and soggy.  Overall a great experience - we'll be back."
"I made a reservation here yet I still had to wait another 30 minutes to get a table. It was extremely loud and crowded. Personally, I don't particularly fancy dining in loud and cluttered restaurants. My dad and I had to yell at each other from across the table to hear what the other was saying. The food, however, came out quick and it was delicious. We ordered the Fumo Negli Occhi (Smoked Provolone, Speck, & Baby Spinach) and Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo (Tuscan Pasta Ribbons with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce).The Fumo Negli Occhi is a form of pizza; it was made very thin, crunchy and extremely good.  I liked the touch of smoked provolone that they added into the pizza. The Papperdelle pasta was made perfectly and the braised beef gave it much flavor.  The pasta had a chewy texture to it; it was not too hard or too thick to eat. Even though the food is delicious, I personally would not come here again for dinner. Even with reservations it takes forever to get a table since the place is so crowded.  I would definitely come here to eat lunch since it is not as hectic and crowded during that time."
This place gets very packed but their service and food is always so good. The plates are great to share so you can try different things. Consistency and quality at its best.
"This is a small dish Italian place. The food was tasty, but nothing really stood out. With all the great Italian places in Chicago, I would say Quartino fits the bill if you are hungry, but not necessarily a stand out like Balena or Piccolo Sogno.Be aware - this place has very tight seating. Probably not the best for large groups, or parents who don't believe their children should have their butts planted in a chair for a meal. We sat next to two couple with 3 children, and as they let their little beasts run wild, many a server tripped over them or attempted  to heard the screaming brats back to the table.Very distracting, and we preferred Balena's intimate seating to avoid bs like that."
"Giving this place two stars only because of my most recent experience. Otherwise, it would have been three. We had a reservation for 12 guest at around 930 pm. I have been here multiple times, always packed and have never been disappointed with the food. We arrived at 925 and did not get sat at our table until 955. They had us standing in a small cramped greeting area while other patrons where trying to get a table between us. It was a mess. Once finally sat it took 20 minutes for drinks. I understand we had a large party, but they should of asked for help. Food came out unorganized and I was more than starved by the time we got to order. I asked for bread twice while waiting for my meal. I hope they work on this better. My party and I where very disappointed. We had a table reserved at vertigo at around midnight and we where not done eating till around 1215 if that gives you an idea of how long everything took."
Went here last night with a group of 8 friends for a birthday party and this was such a great experience! The food had options for everyone and all of the entrees were able to be customized for dietary and allergy restrictions- or just for picky eaters like me. I ordered the linguine with white clam sauce and it was so good! Definitely enough for 2 portions. We also got the liter of the red sangria and it was the best sangria I have ever gotten.Prices were actually relatively low for the quality and location and service was great! Highly recommend for a date night or a group event!
"1592... Reviews.In 1492, Columbus sailed and I see that Quartino has reached 1592 reviews... I'll see as to how clever I'm feeling in making a joke about that.I've been going to Quartino (there IS no 's in the name... But we are in Chicago, It isn't JEWEL, (the grocery store) it's Jewels) for about 7yrs now. Is the FOOD that fantastic? Well... Depends upon what you get. Not everything is entirely consistent, but it doesn't suck either.This isn't ""Italian Tapas""... This is ENOTECA. Similar to tapas, and the Italians have just as long of a tradition in doing ""small plates dining"". The pizzas come in one size and yes... ONE person COULD knock it down. This is NOT ""pasta by the POUND with red-lead"" spaghetti joint and it isn't Chicago Style Pizza. I could get into a lecture as to how a REAL Italian (meaning, in Italy) meal would go and 99.9% won't believe me, because you keep going to places in ROME or VENICE where the menu is ALSO in ENGLISH.Pasta is a very ""small course"" in a coursed meal and one rule is: fish and cheese do NOT come together in the same meal either... Much less dish. On a pasta a-la vongole (clams in white sauce), DO NOT have cheese grated on it!In some instances, the food IS that fantastic. The house cured Duck Prosciutto (no, there is no ""H"" in spelling prosciutto) is AMAZING. You CAN have it on a pizza (which I highly recommend, Prosciutto D'Anitra... nom, nom, nom) as well as on it's own for Salumeria. Get over your hangups about chicken/duck. YES, you CAN CURED duck. In Japan... I'd be down with chicken sashimi.And I trust Chef John Colleta. Chef John is one of those guys whom you've NEVER HEARD OF... BUT, he HAS trained some of the guys whom you have/ are hearing about NOW and some of those guys... When their projects didn't go as well as they could have/ should have, go BACK to working for John Coletta.His boucherie/ salumeri/ bunch of cured meats & sausages with cheese on a board, is one the BEST in Chicago.His sauce Bolognese doesn't suck either. Most reading this, don't really know that Sauce Bolognese is a meat ragout (ragu) where the meats are TEMPERED/ braised in milk, then TOMATO. The Italians braise a LOT of meats in MILK. Chef John's is one of the better Ragu Bolognese I've had. Certainly here in the city of Chicago. And I love the house-made pasta.One of the more INTERESTING BARGAINS on the menu is: Veal Skirt Steak. THIS is my go-to dish. Sizable portion of protein, arugula and roasted tomato salad... Phenomenal.Steamed Clams in Pinot Grigio... Under $12? And that MUCH clam? Seriously?Where the place falters is... Some consistency. Over the winter, they were running Roasted Cauliflower and Brussels Sprouts. SO FRICKIN' GOOD! Seriously, lemon, garlic, chili flake and Olive Oil, roast and it was AWESOME. Yet, the absolute WORST broccoli rabe. Kills me. And I LOVE these BITTER greens. Arugula! Kale! Brussels Sprouts! And their Rabe... as well as the sauteed spinach... Pathetic, overcooked and sitting in this watery bath of camouflage green. Worst. For sure a spot on the menu that fails me.Beef carpaccio ain't all that either.The grappa cured salmon was AWESOME and I wish they would bring that back. The seared tuna was really good too.Salads are very good as well as imaginative. Cesar has too much anchovy.Their version of Chippino/ Frutti De Mare... A friggin' BARGAIN.Considering that ""doing 1,000 covers (people)"" is a s l o w night... And how BIG the place is, This place keeps up some awfully good standards to the food. Maybe not ""Cheesecake Factory"" standards... But we aren't talking about ""Cheesecake Factory"" and you really don't want to know what I think of that as ""cuisine."" I respect Cheesecake Factory as much as I respect Satan himself. There are some SERIOUS BARGAINS on the wine list too. There really IS a reason as to WHY I've been coming here for 7+yrs and yes, it helps that MOST of their menu is available until MUCH later than 99.9% of when restaurants are serving their FULL menu. Overall, the food is solid and the staff is great. Service, be it; at the bar, in the bar or in the dining room... Everyone has always been great to me.The menu is BEST when you step out of comfort zone as well with going for seasonal dishes. Have some house cured or made salume or ""God's Feet"" cheese and live a little."
"Great energy with amazing wine and home-made pastas!Saturday night, this place is packed, from bar to restaurant, wine is flowing, everyone is in their best garb and all I spell is amazing food.  Girlfriend and I shared a pitcher of wine along with a pastas dish and bacon wrapped dates and ended our meal with some zeppoles!Everything was amazing, I would definitely come for a return visit!"
"Every time we have been here, we've had an excellent experience. The food and service have always been stellar! This is now our downtown place to go, especially in the summer!"
Fun atmosphere. Food only ok. Not the place for a serious meeting.  Food was generic Italian. Not much too brag about.
"Casual, reasonable and great for big groups. I love their wine service and the fact that you have more size options... not just a glass or bottle.The small plates are great because you have the option to try so much more. For 4 people we usually order 6 or 7 things and pass them around. I like getting the Salumeria Tasting, great for picking and having a glassof wine."
"This place did not live up to the hype AT ALL! In fact, it was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I've had at a restaurant in a long time - mostly due to the atmosphere. However, the food is decent/pretty good, and probably deserves 3 stars. I would never recommend this restaurant for dinner, but it may be a nice option for dessert. The cons: - It's extremely LOUD inside the restaurant, probably because they try to squeeze in as many tables as possible in a small area. If you're sitting next to a loud party, don't even try having a conversation with your table because you won't be able to hear a word anyone is saying, even when they're right next to you.- The tables are extremely small and cramped. My party of 4 was at a table that was better suited for 2. Add on the dishes and pizza once they started to come out, and you can imagine that no one had any room to move at all. - The food was not as amazing as I expected. In addition, the portions of the pasta & risotto dishes were really small! I was shocked to see how small they were, given their price. We ordered the following:    - Funghi Pizza - Roasted Portobellos & Crushed Tomatoes - $11   - Tortellini - Alfredo Sauce, Peas, & Prosciutto - $11.75   - Mushroom Risotto - Fresh Mushrooms, Mushroom Puree, & Pork Stock - $11.50   - Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - Tuscan Pasta Ribbons with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce - $11.75The pros: - We made a reservation beforehand for a Saturday night. When we arrived, we were seated right away.  - Perhaps if you're seated outside (which we were not), you'll have a nice view of downtown. - My favorite dish was the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo. I'd recommend this dish, even though the portions are small.- We were impressed by their desserts (they were delicious!) and thought they had a large variety. We ordered the following:    - Zeppole - $5.50 Hot Italian Doughnuts with Honey or Dark Chocolate   - Profiteroles - $6.50 Vanilla Gelato, Chocolate Sauce, & Toasted AlmondsOverall, if you only have a couple of meals to eat in downtown Chicago, don't waste one of your meals at Quartino. There are better priced, more delicious restaurants out there that will lend to a much more comfortable dining experience."
"quattro stagioni, shrimp risotto, linguini w/clams, Orvieto medium whites, period.  delish & reasonably priced for such high quality grub!"
"Went for a late Lunch at about 330, patio was crowded but inside was nice. Ordered shrimp, beef carpaccio, short rib, arrabiata and tiramisu. Short rib had a lot of excess fat but was yummy. I soaked up the sauce with my bread after we ate it all. Everything else was bland. I actually had to add salt and pepper :/ not a good thing. The arrabiata had absolutely no spice to it, maybe they just gave us marinara instead. Tiramisu was average, not a lot of coffee flavor. Service was attentive and polite. May try it again but doubtful."
"After several years of wanting to try this place my wife and I finally had dinner there. The restaurant is loud and a little tired looking but the food is excellent. In addition, the prices are reasonable. I was really surprised by the experience and will be back for more."
"Not that Quartino needs more kudos, but after several visits here since its opening, I just cannot help but sing its praises. My experiences here have included meeting friends for drinks and eats at the bar, a fabulous Yelp event, and a recent solo stop at the bar. Quartino is the perfect place to come for a little buzz , some noshes and a convivial atmosphere. So heads up all you lonely out-of-towners in the surrounding hotels. They bill the place as one where wine costs about as much as water. And they're not kidding.Wine comes in a 1/4, 1/2, or full carafe. The choices are extensive but not mind-boggling, and the menu divvies up the wine such as whites into lighter, medium or heavier choices, which is very helpful. Wine glasses are the small European bistro types, so you get 2-3 of these out of a 1/4 carafe. Well, that just feels like a deal, for $10.00, which was the cost of my Ferrari-Carrano Fume Blanc.  I added to the delectable wine choice a couple of veal meatballs sliders, an order of grilled rolled zucchini with sun-dried tomato and marinara. I woke up thinking about those!  They were a perfect example of the exquisite flavor pairings accomplished here, even in the smallest dish. Ribbon-thin slices of zucchini were wrapped around meaty strips of sun-dried tomato, then lightly grilled. The sliders were accompanied with a chopped and pickled vegetable slaw, similar to the Latin Escabeche. Perfect contrast the the creamy veal meatballs.Although I've not visited all of the small-plate, tapas places or enotecas in the city, Quartino is by far my first choice for this style of eating and drinking. The pizzas are simple and exquisite. The pastas you can order in half-orders, which is how they'd be eaten in Europe anyway. And the vegetarian dishes are worthy of a ""No Vegan Left Behind"" award. There is always something new to try here.The joint seems to be staffed with college kids, but that may be a point of view thing, since anyone under the age of 30, to me, looks like a college kid. But what a great bunch of kids. They all bring and energy and enthusiasm that you can't help taking with you on your way out. Then you can go back home, or to your hotel, and dream of small plates and well-vetted wines, as the memories and  a thankful tummy lull you to sleep."
"It was the perfect ending to a perfect day. Wonderful, attentive staff...great food...probably the best risotto known to man! Actually, I will dream of this risotto for quite awhile.    The atmosphere is a little loud, but we are finding that is the norm for the great quality, trendy spots in Chicago."
"Ended up here on a whim while looking for lunch on St Pat's Day. Definitely was starting to pick up because it was so close to the parade and the weather was beautiful so the patio was already full. It was a great choice because of the small plates. Who can go ever go wrong with meat wrapped around dates? I'm usually not one for prosciutto, but the salty sweet with the date hit the spot. The pork belly was tender and crunchy on the skin. You definitely don't want to miss out on the veal meatball sliders.I can see it being a great place to head after work. I would like to come back for drinks sometime."
"I went here with a friend and it was great! The service was impeccable especially for a busy night.We weren't that hungry so we just ordered the Lamb Ragu Pasta, Salmon, and Brocolini. The salmon was perfectly cooked; my friend thought it needed more flavor, but I thought it was seasoned perfectly. The lamb pasta was very good as well, but the pasta was a little too ""al dente"" for my taste.  The brocolini was good, nothing too special here.I would absolutely recommend this place for group dinners or a great date spot! The small plates are really fun for sharing."
"Ugh. We had an office Christmas party here recently and it was quite disappointing. First, they did not give us a table large enough to sit our reservations. They tried to put TWO people on each *end* of a row of tables. So there are four people eating at the same place! We complained and eventually got an extra table added. But talk about greedy...The service was pretty bad too. The servers were rude and talked back under their tongue. They did not ask to take our orders (we had to call them over after a long wait) and, when they did, they did not do it in any kind of coordinated way (we had two servers). The food was horrible as well. This place doesn't know what it wants to be. Is  it tapas? But you can order fettuccine Alfredo and pizzas? The gnocchi is the worst I ever had (but, to be honest, one person of the four at my table who tried it liked it). I got some sliced beef which was okay, at least. Everyone was pretty much disappointed with what they got. I finished with the lemon desert and it had no lemon flavor at all. It tasted like vanilla.And it was loud! Forget about trying to have any kind of conversation. When we got outside everyone went ""ahhhh"" because we forgot was normal hearing felt like.My wife is a pastry chef at a Chicago restaurant and she knows how they work. She says this type of experience is typical of a place trying to cut corners under orders from management."
I've been to this place twice.  I love the food...the waiters are so nice.  The ambiance is nice.   I will definitely return 4 more.
"Quartino, I think I love you.  Seriously, you delivered!With such a great and diverse menu, I decided to put our server to work right away.  I asked her to bring a few cheeses, a pizza, and 2-3 other dishes for the three of us.  We quickly found out that this was the way to go!   Here is the lowdown:Wine:Lazio - If You See Kay - Awesome cabernet sauvignon based blendCheese:Asiago Vecchio - wonderful sharp asiagoTaleggio - another winner...so goodPizza:We had a great pie that was half Fumo Negli Occhi and half Campania.  Put it this way...I am going to order it again on my next visit.Tapas:Sea Scallops - Perfectly cookedTortellini (Half Order) - I could have eaten the whole platePappardelle (Half Order) -  Excellent pasta, delicious sauceOverall, I enjoyed a great dinner with some great company.   I will be back for sure."
"Our favorite Chicago restaurant, hands down!"
"It's become a tradition to come here on the way back from the airport now. The place is huge, and gets busy quickly, but we usually never have trouble getting a seat right away.Usually I stuff myself with favorites before remembering to try something new, and the endless yummy bread definitely doesn't help. Seriously, they are very attentive about replenishing my bread supply, and it's just so hard to resist munching on it while waiting for food. Two plates of clams in wine sauce, which is actually a big bowl of clams instead of y'know... veggies on the bottom and a layer of like 10 clams on top. Always get this.Asparagus risotto -  was really homey and comforting, with just a hint of asparagus flavor that demands attention to its presence but isn't close to being overpoweringGnocchi - a bit too heavy for us and we barely ate the plate between the 2 of us.Pancetta wrapped dates - I remember enjoying it, but it wasn't so memorable that I still remember exactly what it tastes like stillVeal meatballs - the meatballs themselves were good, but something in the sauce or garnish stuck out very strongly and had a pungent flavor I personally didn't enjoyBraised pork shank - unluckily got this at the end of a meal so it became too heavy at that point but will definitely try this again at some point earlier onOnce we actually saved room for dessert! Tried tiramisu - really dark and rich but not super heavy that we couldn't finish. But I'm not picky about my tiramisu.Marrow - very greasy and didn't get much out of it. I remember loving bone marrow as a kid, but this was so fatty I barely touched it.There were a few other things I've had but just don't remember.Always have a good experience here. Some of the plates aren't good, but I know more and more which are favorites and the menu is huge so there is always something new to try!"
"This is hands-down one of my favorite restaurants of all time. It's such a great place to go. Good for groups, too!They have amazing food! Very good selection. You MUST start with a bellini to drink.. and of course check out their little appetizer checklist (meats / cheeses / olives) which are terrific (a little pricy, but delish). All the food I've ever eaten there was fantastic. I personally normally do a pasta. A couple of my friends love the Risotto. Their pizzas are even fantastic! There is normally a wait to get seated, as they are always busy, but the wait is generally pretty tolerable. Nice bar area, large dining area.Note: This place is a little different as they bring out the meals as they become ready - which means your dining partners may get theirs before you, or vice-versa. They do this to ensure everyone's food is delivered hot and fresh! But I know some diners are put-off by this.Pros: Ambiance, Excellent food, excellent wine, good for groupsCons: Very  noisy"
"If possible, I would give this place a 4.5, because the 0.5 star taken away was not in the control of the restaurant. I went there with a friend for a early dinner, and thankfully we had a reservation because it was very busy; I couldn't imagine what the wait time would be. I also used the valet parking ($13.99) and that was extremely convenient.We were seated right away, greeted by our waiter (Jourdan), and he explained the menu for us. For those who don't know, Quartino is a small plates restaurant dealing in Italian cuisine - they are meant to be shared. My friend and I shared the caprese salad, the sun dried tomato soup, the penne alla vodka, and the shrimp risotto. Caprese: pretty simple, nothing special. Soup: same. Both the penne and risotto were suuuuuper hot (I just love fresh hot food), and was delivered without much of a wait. I enjoyed the penne more so than the risotto, but both were really good. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was INCREDIBLY loud - I could barely hear what my friend was saying. There was one particularly loud party of about 10 people next to us, and I definitely threw some dirty looks their direction for being so rude and loud. But like I mentioned, it was out of the restaurant control, but it took away from the ambiance. I would recommend this place to anyone, just don't expect a quiet place on a Saturday night."
One of the best tasting Italian restaurant in Chicago. I've been to a lot of Italian places but this place really sticks to the real Italian taste. I recommend their pizzas. Specifically pizza campania. We had bruschette. Get half portions to taste a lot of stuff. Cavatelli and gnocchi. So good!
"Beet salad is not on the menu but worth having! First time I went I had a homemade fettucine - pasta was good, but the marinara was real salty.Polenta fries are good; asparagus gnocchi is even better. My favorite was the arugula orange and cheese salad with pine nuts. So incredible!Fun atmosphere. Good amount of vegetarian options. Open late and still lively at 1:00am."
"Thankfully we had a reservation or else getting in on a Friday night would have been nearly impossible.  We sat at a table crammed into the middle of the restaurants with three bachelorette parties nearby.  The restaurant was loud enough without the constant ""woo's"" and screams coming from grown women wearing tiaras and pageant sashes.  I haven't been in Chicago very long, but it's becoming very evident that River North may be the bachelorette party capital of the world.  The noise and the presence of a bathroom attendant are what's keeping me from giving Quartino 5 stars.  I can't stand bathroom attendants - I'm all for folks making a buck, but I generally prefer paying people for services that I either can't or don't want to do for myself; turning water on and grabbing a paper towel are things I'd rather handle on my own.As far as our meal, everything was great.  Our waiter was very helpful and we decided to try a bunch of things from all over the menu.  We started with the angus beef carpaccio and the spinach salad, both of which were very refreshing on a hot evening.  We then ordered the mushroom risotto (delicious), sea scallops (nothing special, but I love scallops), and the veal osso buco (tender and juicy).  The three of us were still hungry, so we ordered the eggplant parmagiana (not my favorite but still good) and the roasted baby octopus (amazing).  We finished with a sorbet and biscotti type dessert that was very good."
Amazing food!! I went in for a late lunch with my friends last summer during Labor Day weekend when I was visiting Chicago.  We ordered pasta and a small plate of appetizer. The service was very good and the waiter suggested dishes which turned out to be good. Waitingto be there again!
"I have had lunch and dinner here several times when in Chicago.  Great food and great variety.  My last visit was on July 14, 2013.  They were offering a great brunch special, but with the kiddos present we opted for the full menu.  Shared plates this visit included the veal meatballs, broccoli rabe, and margarita pizza.  Kids had Italian sodas.  We had more than enough food...no dessert..and for four people the bill came to $38 and some change before gratuity.  I'd recommend this place to ANYONE.  Dates, families, groups will all enjoy this place!"
"I really liked the feel and charming decor of this place.  The small plates are great for sharing.  This place gets pretty loud though, so not very romantic or anything like that.  The food is pretty good too.  Come with a group to order more dishes."
"Had a nice late lunch here while visiting from out of town - sat outside on a beautiful, sunny afternoon. Really liked that they serve wine by the 1/2 liter and full liter, in addition to by the bottle. Waiter was very knowledgable about the wines and made a good recommendation for our 1/2L order. Tapas portions of Italian dishes - great concept - perfect portions for the 2 of us to share. Polenta fries were excellent - as was the broccoli rabe. The salmon was cooked perfectly, but a bit under seasoned. Gnocchi was a little dense - I prefer them a bit more fluffy - but acceptable. Finished off our lunch with a very good espresso."
"Kind of tapas small plates meets home-style Italian.  We came here after a second city show on a beautiful Saturday night.  It was crowded and loud.  One of our six had been here in the past and he took the lead and ordered.  We had 12 plates and a bottle of wine.  Everything was pretty good, served quickly, and hot.  We were happy.  The Italian red hit the spot as well.Not cheap so know that, but a good time.  Loud though."
"Three and a half stars is what I would rate this place the shrimp was overcooked but flavorful the pizza was pretty good probably 5 stars on its own eggplant parmesan was one star with robbery cheese and lukewarm eggplant, cheese tray whats average hard to mess that up."
"I have been to italy and i have tried lots of italian restaurants around the world.when i checked for italian restaurant in downtown chicago this one was the most rated so i planned to visit it.we went to the place and it was the four of us.actually their service was amazing the waiter was very friendly and helpful although it was a bet packed as it was the mothers day.the food actually was not as we expected at all, we had duck breast and burrata for appetizer the duck breast we returned it as we did not like it at all, the burrata was just okay.we had pizza and shrimp fruti di mare which were good but not great, and we had the scalvi i think its name and was nothing special about it at all,i dont think i would comeback again although the ambiance of the restaurant is nice."
This tapas restaurant was a great place with friends and family. The staff were very attentive and informative. We had the tasting Wine suggestedDonut with dark chocolateGnocchiBone marrowService and food were great! :)
Just ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana for carryout and it was fabulous!  Perfect portion and great price!  Will definitely be recommending Quartino to my friends and co-workers!
Love this place.  A must on a visit to Chicago.  Great food.... especially the dates and anything with the housemade mozzarella and pastas.  My teenage boys want to go back.  Great ambiance too.
"Good, not great for the money you are spending here.You will EASILY spend over $50/person pre drink order unless you don't order enough to get full.I love the style of italian tapas. This is my favorite way of eating because you get to try a lot of different flavors yet not get too full from eating too much. However, their small plates are not cheap which makes it hard to order a lot without leaving with a hefty tab. I would be more inclined to pay this kind of money if I felt the food was out of this world or the dining experience was out of this world...but it's not. We paid over $15 for a plate that had 3 scallops...The wine selection is good, however they serve them in little glasses which I understand is trying to be authentic, but I prefer to drink out of wine glasses....The outside patio is excellent. I will go again in the summer time just for the patio alone (though prepare to wait).All in all, I like Quartino. I think it is a perfect date place or a good place to have a fun dinner out, however the price will keep me from making this a place I go anytime in the near future."
"Balsamic is excellent. Do try it on the bread. Chicken soup is delicious, don't pass it by."
"Great atmosphere, affordable menu, friendly staff. Love coming here with a group of friends and sharing plates & wine. Don't forget the limoncello! And the pancetta-wrapped dates. Caprese salad is solid too."
This is a nice place to take your date for dinner! Just the right price and the right portions on the tapas.  They open late you can have that romantic conversation under the nice ambiance. I loved their Pizza! Very friendly staff and they have plenty of suggestion based on what you feel like eating. Pretty honest. Overall I would go there again.
"Best service ever....our waiter was so knowledgeable, friendly, and there to serve your every need!  He explained the concept there....ordering plates, like tappas, but it's italian food.  We started with the Salummi plate.  Very good value as only $25 and you get to choose two meats, three spuntini, two cheeses and mix of olives and other goodies.  We ordered the duck prociutto as one ofur meats.  We did not know what to expect but it was actually very good!  Also for the spuntini we ordered the vegetable giardineria, sicilian caponata (my fav!) and red beet with ricotta and walnut salad.  All VERY VERY delicious!  We were only two and got full on that along with the alfredo tortelini with prosciutto....so delish!  This is our first time in Chicago and first time at this restaurant and will definetely recommend and be back on our next trip.  Our waiter......can't remember his name but he has lovely mustache....BEST WAITER, attentive, great service.  We heard him with some patrons around us who wanted chicken parm an although it was not on the menu he said he can have it made for them.  How amazing!  Anyways, go visit this place, well worth it!"
"Food was decent, service was awful and an appetizer trio with a bottle of wine took 2 hours."
"The food is top notch.  If you like tapas, you can't miss Quartino."
"The service is excellent.  Like the wine caraffes.  Outstanding and unique bruschetta varieties.  The braised pork is fit for a caveman, a giant hunk of meat on bone, each piece probably weighed at least 3 pounds!  They have high quality olive oil on the tables.  Restaurant was bussling.  I loved the appetizers but only liked the main course.  Of note was the gnocchi with pesto sauce - out of this world.  Hubby said the pork filled ravioli was nasty and reminded him of pate - I was not daring enough to try.  This was a solid 3 star place to me.  Also, if you like to eat a load of italian cheeses, than this place is for you, you will get your fill.  Valet $12.00 or metered street parking available."
"We went to Quartino last night for New Years Eve dinner.  We had plans downtown for midnight so we were looking for somewhere to eat around 10.  About a week before NYE, I called all of our usual places trying to get a reservation and there was nothing available!  After reading a ton of Yelp reviews I decided to give Quartino a try.  They had a reservation available at the time we wanted so we put our name in via Open Table.  Last night we ended up arriving downtown about an hour earlier than we anticipated.  We stopped at Purple Pig first but they had a 3 hour wait!  So we went to Quartino and they were able to get us in right away!  The service at the hostess stand was really great.  The ambiance in Quartino is really nice.  I love the subway tile walls, the antique candleabras, the open airy feeling and the downtown views.  The restaurant has a very European bistro feel which was really unexpected in the downtown touristy area.The food is Italian small plates or tapas.  We ordered the following:Polenta fries: crispy and delicious, really unique!  I wish they came with marinara sauce though instead of the red pepper sauce.Tortellini w/ alfredo sauce, peas and prosciutto: my partner loved this dish, he wants to come back for it! Ravioli w/ braised pork and fava beans: this dish was delicious but a little saltier than it needed to be.  With the prosciutto and parm they don't need to add so much salt!Chicken: garlicky and deliciousCalamari: fresh and well seasoned.  The portion was a bit too large for tapas though. The best thing about our meal was our server.  I can't recall his name but he was really friendly and outgoing.  He explained the menu to us and even got me a free drink when they didn't have the one I wanted!  He went above and beyond and that is just a great feeling.  We weren't too thrilled to be going here on New Years since it seemed like any other Italian place (of which, Chicago has plenty!) but we were pleasantly surprised and will definitely be going back again!"
"1 star for the cavatelli, 1 star for the awesome busboy.  i don't understand the hype of this place, but give someone enough wine and anything will taste good.our food was dismal at best.  even the bread you start with is ""blah"".  we started with the caprese which was decent (at least the mozzarella wasn't slimy), moved on to the eggplant parmesan which was soggy and bland and the cavatelli, which i actually really enjoyed, then onto the margarita pizza which was also bland (it looked better than it tasted), and lastly had the scallops.  the scallops were lukewarm like they had been sitting out for some time and one was majorly burnt.  it looked like a mcdonald's operation in the kitchen so i can imagine why everything is so-so.our waiter, to be nice, sucked.  he didn't stop by once to ask if we needed anything after we ordered, just asking once if everything was okay.  no water refill, no asking if we wanted a refill on booze.  with that said, the busboy compensated for that, asking if we wanted more wine, getting us a new bottle of water, asking if we needed anything else with our meal.. and all with a huge smile.  the fact that our waiter just didn't seem to care really bothered me.dessert was decent (we had the sorbet) although the biscotti could have broken your teeth.  they also sent us with cans of tomatoes.  i'm still left questioning that, but it at least made me a little happier with my experience."
"I've been here a handful of times and each time I always order the Salumeria Tasting platter right after we order our drinks.  And every time, it's perfect.  Meats.  Cheeses. Spreads.  Interesting little salad type things.  I'd highly recommend it for either a starter or even a lighter meal for two if you're not feeling anything too heavy. Very reasonable wine prices and a delicious beet salad.  Oh, and the caprese salad is delicious.  You may think it's hard to mess up a caprese salad, but I've definitely had quite a few lately that just missed the boat. Fortunately, this one-- along with all of the other food that we got, was absolutely spot on.  Perfect ratio of mozzarella/ tomato to balsamic/oil/seasoning.   I also tried my sisters Gnocchi and that was excellent!  The only complaint I have about anything I've ordered there is on the Zola Noci & Pere Pizza. The menu description was 'Gorgonzola, Walnuts, & Pears' so we thought it would be a fresh spin on a pizza.  Boy were we wrong.  It had a weird reddish/pink tomato sauce that overpowered the ingredients & soaked into the crust, leaving it soggy & funky tasting.  After working at a restaurant for many years in my teens, I'm never one to complain-- but I felt the need to just tell the waiter that something was a little off with this dish.  His response was ' I know, I really don't like that pizza either!'  We laughed about it and he kindly helped us pick out a more suitable pizza on the menu. Overall-- Great food,  Great service,  Awesome staff;  I've been there a bunch and I'm sure I'll be back again in the near future."
"Great place for food, wine, sharing food they have small plates. Wonderful arugula pizza. Great service.You can buy a half carafe of wine, sangria.If your having a night out with friends, best choice."
"The top-notch combination of food quality, service, and cost makes this a winner in my book. Our waitress knew the menu cold and handled our food allergies and intolerances without missing a beat. Our dishes emerged from the kitchen quickly and proved without a doubt the Italians can do tapas. My wife and I had several small plates, drinks and desserts for less than $80. That's hard to beat in any major US city."
"You should definitely make a reservation because the wait can be ridiculous at times, especially during dinner. Maybe it's me.. but I am not a fan of Italian tapas? That is weird coming out of my mouth, I love all foods. Maybe it was what we ordered. Veal meatballs - it was a different flavor but after 2, I was tired of it and did not want anymore.Braised Pork Shank - this is one big piece of tender pork. It was good, but definitely way too much for 2 people.Gnocchi - we should have went with the waiter's recommendation but I read some other yelp reviews that this was good. It was too plain for me and just needed more.. something, flavor?Beef Short Ribs - It was very fatty and I could not live with myself putting chunks of fat into my belly.I think this place can be pretty good, but I am definitely more of a Mexican tapas fan after this experience."
Great atmosphere and customer service .Not the best food but good enough to eat after 11pm
"Great for big groups. Nice service and good food! Personally I love Spanish tapas more than Italian just because I think they are more interesting, but Italian is better if you have picky eaters. Good wine too! There are a lot of places I need to try in the area, but I'm sure I will continue coming back for group dinners out!"
"Was in town and needed a last minute place for a group.  We found this place on open table that day and were promptly seated.we proceeded to order some wine and a combo of small plates to share.  The atmosphere was lively, service professional and efficient, and the food not bad.  To be honest, none of the small plates stood out as amazing and none were horrible.  All in all it was a nice evening for a lively dinner with friends, but not a destination."
"My mom and I were walking around the city to shop one afternoon, and we dined at Quartino for some Italian style tapas for lunch!We had an heirloom tomato salad with arugula: very generous in size, especially for two people! We also ordered broccoli rabe with red chili, onion, garlic and EVOO: a solid vegetable choice, as well as the asparagus risotto...which was the favorite dish of our meal. So creamy and the asparagus flavor really shined through.We also couldn't resist ordering a half order of zeppoles for dessert (with chocolate dipping sauce). Can you ever go wrong with fried dough, powdered sugar, and chocolate? I don't think so. Yum.The restaurant itself is gorgeous on the inside...I know this is random, but the sinks in the bathroom are really fun too! ;) The staff was friendly, the food was promptly served, and the quality was great! Definitely a solid choice for a lunch spot, in my opinion!"
"The ambiance of this place was very unique, like a nice Italian home with a meat showcase. They had a varied menu, and were very reasonably priced. They could certainly charge more. Many of their dishes came as half plates at half price, and you could sit there all day with serving after serving and not go broke. The server had wonderful recommendations and he was very knowledgeable. From the moment we sat down, we were almost immediately given attention and the timing was impeccable - everything from water, to bread, to order taking, and a very quick return with the food - all during the lunch rush. We didn't have any wine, but the list was extensive and they were focused on providing quality in everything they do. The flavors were intense. The richest olives I've ever had, a perfectly done duck prosciutto, and the most earthiest and delicious mushroom risotto (I don't even like mushrooms, but it was delish). We also gorged on a pizza which you can split halves of any toppings - we chose arugula on half and (the best ever) pepperoni on the other. I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Chicago!"
"Came here with our friends who live in Chicago... an were excited to have them try sangira... but we felt it was very watery! It lacked flavor...apart from the drinks the food was really good... we ordered the Burrata,mushroom Risotto(very nice),&amazing short ribs... over all a nice place.."
Overly rated for sure! The Spaghetti all' Arrabbiata was the worst I've ever had at any Italian restaurant. It was tasteless. The gnocchi had a gamy taste. It doesn't even deserve a one star.
"Quartinos is a great place to go with a larger group (with a reservation). The plates are very inexpensive and its fun to taste a bunch of different things. The downside is that the dining room is very big and can get loud so conversation may be a little hard (or I may be a little deaf).For a group of six, we ordered: Veal meatballs, Funghi pizza, Calamari, Shrimp, 2x Cavatelli, Tortellini, Penne alla Vodka, and Eggplant Parmigiana. The highlights were definitely the Shrimp and the Cavatelli."
"Great small plates for sharing, great carafes of wine, great atmosphere, great service. It was a great night!"
"My favorite italian place. ever. The food is fresh, delicious, and there are so many options. Anytime myself, or someone even thinks about italian, Quartino's it is. SO good!"
Food was excellent. Service was great. Wine list was very good and not expensive.
"It's a very popular restaurant because of its exclusive location, but as an Italian, to be totally sincere and I am sorry to say that, this is not the restaurant where you will find authentic Italian food. Not happy about it. Pizza is too dry and...well, not pizza. Prosciutto is served in a poor portion, not cheap at all, together with pickled-fruits you may def not want to eat together with prosciutto. I don't know. Hmmm. Ugh. Oh and: Alfredo sauce doesn't exist at all in Italy! We have something similar that we call ""besciamella"", so if you want to look authentic Italian, I'd recommend to change the name at least."
"I've been in Chi a lot lately for work and hit this place up regularly now. Why the rating bump?I can't speak for dinner service but our lunch service has been exceptional. Our server remembered us from last time ( more than a month ago) and they happily made a special item for my pain in the ass colleague. And, when my lunch partner asked for a Diet Sprite, they got her one...from the 7/11 across the street!As for food, the pastas are pretty good but they shine on the pizzas and small plates.Their house wine prices are great too, sadly for me, drinking on the job is frowned upon.If you go, try to get the waiter with the waxed moustache. I wish I could recall his name but he's just awesome."
"Made a reservation through OpenTable and was seated right when we arrived. Atmosphere is nice and ""warm"" so it was pretty romantic without being stuffy/boring. We had a table on the second floor between the fireplace and stairwell. Our server was fantastic. Very nice and attentive and made some great recommendations. We had the cheese tortellini with peas and prosciutto, beef short ribs, and a pizza - half was a vegetarian ""quattro stagioni"" and the other half was a sauceless ""stefano."" I loved the tortellini. It was cheesy and so good and they gave us a side of prosciutto because I didn't want it in the pasta dish. The pizza was also good. I usually like sauce so I didn't care for the stefano too much. The quattro stagioni was very tasty and has a nice thin crust. It was perfect when it was hot but it was a little salty when I ate some of the leftovers cold later. The beef short ribs were okay. They are tender and fell off the bone but it was my least favorite of all the dishes. Three dishes was plenty of food for two people. The pizza is huge and we took nearly half of it to go.Overall, great food and fantastic service. Would definitely return next time we are in Chicago!"
"Really neat place. Very noisy but fun and the interior is so neat to look at. Pizzas are delicious and staff is friendly, helpful and professional. Highly recommend."
Yum good tasty stuff to try. This is a nice place to go on a nice day to sit outside and watch the hustle and bustle of Chicago from the patio. The dessert donuts were wonderful
"A great place for a group to try tons of delectable plates. There is a wide variety of options for every diner: vegetables, seafood, pasta, pizza, olives.....My absolute favorite was the roasted octopus, which was tender and super flavorful.Hardly any wait for a table and the staff was very attentive."
"A coworker said she wanted to try this place since it was newer to the downtown area.  It was definitely hoppin' for a Thursday evening, not an empty table in house.  It was loud in there and our waiter informed us everything was meant to be shared.  So a group of us shared a bunch of entrees and desserts - Margherita Pizza - nothing memorable, in fact I already forgot Fondue - the cheese was gritty - blehGnocchi - wasn't cooked perfectlyMushroom Risotto - had a vinegary taste, no likeyEggplant Parmigiana - the best dish Short Ribs - unfortunately I didn't try this dish Coppa al BananaTorta al CioccolatoNutella PaninoProfiteroles Honestly, I was a little disappointed especially since this was my first night in town."
"Good pasta.  Nothing to brag about here.  Ambiance and location is ok.  Service is lagging behind the ""just ok to good"" food.  There is a lot of potential here but I think it will continue to just remain an ""ok"" place."
"I really liked this place--more than I thought I would.Like everyone has said, it's tapas style, which I normally don't think of when it comes to Italian food, but actually makes a lot of sense.Our waitress, Alysia was super helpful and fun and great and she really made our experience even better. She even gave us suggestions on where to go for the rest of our trip since we were visiting Chicago for the first time.One of my favorite parts of the restaurant was that it's open late. I love eating late and am on a super late schedule so it was so great to see something open late that serves really good food.We started with the white bean hummus (YUM), the dates (holy shit!) and the carpaccio (alright). The bread basket was placed down immediately after we were seated and olive oil & balsamic were already on the table, which I loved. We also got the braised beef papparadle which was phenomenal and the scallops which were equally as good. I was super happy with our dinner! Oh, and we spilt a very affordable bottle of wine, which makes any dinner better! ;)Things do come out when they are ready, which I kind of like, especially since we were warmed about this beforehand. If I wasn't told, I would probably be confused, so be warned :)"
"so much love!although they are an *Italian* restaurant, it's so distinct from any oldschool Italian restaurant you can think of. The menu selection features abundant choices for vegetarians, as well as smart portion of meat. tried the pork belly dish. love the charred outside and the chewy meat, coupled with  green apples they even give you a postcard when you leave. It's now on the wall of my kitchen! Def will go back!"
"Dining date:  July 27th, 2013 & othersWebsite:  quartinochicago.comQuartino's has become my Italian restaurant of choice for the summer of 2013.  Quartino's has always delivered when I am in the mood to indulge in carbohydrates.  The menu is simple, yet highly effective for communal dining.  The service is attentive though not extraordinary.  Be forewarned, during the summer months the restaurant can get very crowded.  The restaurant has no problems fitting people into every corner of their restaurant.  Not all spots are comfortable, and I have found myself squeezed into an uncomfortable spot with very little room to maneuver myself.The menu consists of traditional Italian fare, pizza's, pasta's etc.  The portions are small AND meant to be shared, so feel free to order extra entrees.  We typically order a pizza and a few different pasta's and share everything.  The food is of a decent quality, though falls far short of some other Italian restaurants in the city.  I find myself gravitated to the restaurant more for its ambiance and the ability to try a few different things over the quality of its food product.  I am not implying that it is bad, however, the food does taste like it has been mass produced to please their carbohydrate hungry patrons.Overall, I would recommend this restaurant for its ambiance, and the ability to try a few different dishes without getting overwhelmed with large quantities of food like other traditional Italian restaurants.pbarot.blogspot.com"
"I stuffed myself until I literally couldn't shove down any more food.  It was THAT good!  It was the perfect pizza in my eyes...the Quattro Stagioni.  It was piled high with artichokes, zucchini, peppers, portobello mushrooms and parm cheese.  It was a vision of topping amazingness and it was soooooo good!  I also loaded up on my seasonal favorite, an heirloom tomato salad.  I'm gonna be honest and say it was probably meant for two people because it was piled HIGH...but I could care less.  I hate the whole darn thing!  It was amazing!  And let me tell you, that afternoon wine hit the spot and for $7 it was a steal!  Can you believe a bottle is only $20 for some choices!  In Chicago that's impressive.I'm so so sad to not have this in Pittsburgh, so the game is on to find some fresh home made pizza in the Burgh!  Because I need to relieve this heavenly experience again soon!"
"my hangout place when i lived in chicago. conveniently located in river north, i absolutely heart this tapas restaurant."
"I love Quartino. Its a fun place to take Chicago visitors or meet up with good friends. It does get busy but seats in the bar are always available for small groups.We usually share a few small plates, entrees and a bottle of wine for a reasonable price. The veal meatballs are one of my favorite small dishes along with some cheese and olives!Great gluten free options with a separate menu and desserts!"
"One of my favorite places.  I've been to Italy many times and this place gets it when it comes to both the food and the way it is presented - from the menu to the dishes.  While we didn't sit at the bar, it seemed like a great place to be.  The server was so knowledgeable in understanding the menu and the wines.  After she recommended a couple of them, she volunteered to bring me samples of each, and this place was packed!  On my next Chi trip, I will be back."
"Great food and service!We had wine, a cheese plate, and split fettuccine alfredo and penne in a tomato crab sauce. Heavenly.. I was food happy.The building is interesting too.. Love the architecture inside.Staff was great!"
We had a number of selections which were fabulous.  I particularly liked the eggplant Parmesan and the ribs.  The service  was exceptional!
"Sum it up, prefect experience. Amazing Italian spot. Great cheese and cold cut meats. Amazing dishes. Atmosphere is great, great service. Food is divine, it's a definite must go."
"Coming to Chicago for only a few days, and with so many great restaurants to choose from, my wife and I were a little overwhelmed trying to pick the right spot... Throw in the fact that she's gluten free and you're really searching. But wandering the streets of Old Town and Lincoln Park searching Yelp for a good spot for that night's dinner, we happened upon Quartino. Now we're already suckers for small plates, but throw in the Italian flare and were even more excited. We easily got a reservation on a Monday night, despite finding the restaurant packed when we arrived. We got some great people watching in sitting on the patio, with perfect Chicago fall evening weather. Now the food was fantastic, starting off with some olives and an amazing caprese salad. My wife fell in love with the egg plant salad, and they even got her some GF crackers to dip into it. They also have gluten free pasta, which you can pair with any of the pasta dishes. The GF pasta is a corn pasta, which tastes as good as any we've tried, and mixed into the sausage ragu it was phenomenal. But while the food was some of the best we'd had on our trip, we definitely have to say that the service was by far the best. Our waiter Scott was personable, communicative, very sensitive to my wife's food allergy, and incredibly accommodating. We found ourselves hanging around just chatting away with him after dinner, enjoying some good old fashioned Midwest hospitality at what we found out was one of the top restaurants in town!  Bravo to Scott and the Quartino team for giving us such a great experience!"
A-ok
"Never had a complaint about Quartino. Small shared plates of amazing Italian food and great house wine by the carafe. This isnt a romantic meal place, this is a great casual place to grab food and drinks, its noisy always busy. This time we got here early to grab a drink at the bar and before we could finish our first drinks we were told we could get a table 30mins ahead of our reservation. Then once we sat down took our time ordering 1-2 plates at a time and mult carafes of wine and enjoyed our meal. If gonna order anything, the meatball sliders and cavatelli."
We choose Quartino's based in the reviews and were underwhelmed.  Spinach salad lacked flavor .  Calamari was bland.  Beef filet tasted like it was not salted at all.  Would not recommend.
"Place was great, really was. Place is much larger than one might think. Do make reservations! We arrived 15 early on a Sunday night while there on business for NeoCon (party of 2) and were seated right away at a very small table.  Place was packed and so was the wait to get in. We wanted the whole experience so we left it up to the server to order for us. I asked what items he usually orders and that was it. We had about 6 different half portions, more than enough for two men plus dessert. Wow. No complaints. My only beef was the crappy little cups they give you for wine; bit I guess that's what makes this place unique. I will be back for sure."
The roasted baby squid: Melts in your mouth and is kind of amazing. Ravioli: Delicious. Prosciutto D'Anitra: Different yet tasty.Profiteroles: Ordinary. You have to make reservations as it gets so packed every single day. The food came out in a timely manner and service was good.
"Love Quartino. Hadn't been there in a number of years, but finally made my way back a couple weeks ago. Amazing pasta arrabiata. Perfect amount of spiciness. Haven't had the pizza recently, but the pasta was delightful."
"took my boyfriend here to his bday last night. my first time there, his 3rd. it's a tapas place, very reasonably priced. Our bill was $65 and we were stuffed. My favorite was the beat salad and clam linguine. The cheese and salami were OK. Mushroom risotto was quite bland and unappetizing. We had a small two top so there was no room for all the plates. Things kept dropping. It is very loud so not the best date restaurant. we had to yell to.hear each other. The service was adequate. I think overall 3 stars."
Enjoyed...good food all around.
"We came to Quartino for a late night dinner after an evening at Navy Pier and the experience was not incredible, but also didn't leave us wanting for much. It fell right around 2.5/5 and got the bump because our service was good.The spot seems perpetually busy in the evening as we the place was swamped at 10:30 pm. Love that you can use opentable here PS.  The dining room was packed and the atmosphere was bustling.  To us, it seemed like a much more local and open layout Buca Di Beppos. There was indoor and outdoor seating and the palce was really loud.Beverage options were good as far a wine went. Not a ton of beers to speak of, but the vino was well priced and had a lot of size options. The food was good, not great and we ordered predominantly small plates. The most exciting item was the Polenta fries, followed closely by the veal meatball. We also built a small cheese and meat tray. The bleu cheese was good, but lacked the smack ya upside the head bite that we were looking for.Good spot for late night digs and chilling with friends, but not THE spot to go to for great food."
"I ADORE Quartino!I have been here twice: once with my family for Father's Day and once with my boyfriend. It is a great restaurant for either kind of occasion. I highly recommend the $25 antipasto platter. It is plenty of food for two people, and you get to sample delicious cheeses, meats, olives and vegetable plates for an affordable price. The apricot puree that you dip the cheeses in is out of this world. The Stefano pizza is quite delicious, as I love rosemary. The Pasta a la Vodka has a great kick to it and is a favorite. Last but not least, the Zepolle (fried Italian donuts), are delicious, and with honey or dark chocolate, a great dessert to share with a few people. The plates come in full or half sizes, so it is easy to customize your meal, and to try lots of different flavors.The atmosphere is classy, fun, and suitable for ""fancy nights"" or casual dining. The service each time I was here was impeccable. Ty was a wonderful waiter, and was extremely helpful. He even brought our family a half-size of a dessert that he knew we would not finish, to save us on our bill and our stomachs! He deserves a raise, whatever he is making. The other waiter that I had (I can't remember his name, unfortunately), was extremely accommodating, and didn't make my boyfriend and I feel bad for ordering a limited amount of items (college budgets are the worst!) After finding out that we attended the college that he graduated from, he took our drinks off of our bill! Those kind gestures go a long way. Overall, Quartino has its service down to a T, and the food is excellent for the affordable prices. I hope I get to go back very soon!"
"With more than 1,000 reviews, my husband and I were curious about the popularity of this restaurant so we took his mother here for dinner this weekend. Loved the casual experience, but I've had better Italian food in the city. (Disclaimer - I'd probably give this place closer to 3.5 stars if possible.)We went for broke and ordered the following -*1/2 liter of the red wine sangria: Sweet but would have liked stronger.*Dates with Gorgonzola and pancetta: Could have been plumper with more creamy cheese but I adored the sweet honey drizzled on top to balance the saltiness of the meat.*Baby spinach, pear, walnut and ricotta salad: I love fruit-nut-cheese combos but this one was lacking in the cheese. Pears were at least naturally sweet from being ripe, and the simple olive oil-lemon dressing really made the dish light.*Prosciutto D'Anitra pizza: Would have appreciated a thinner crust with more char on it (ie. brick oven/wood fired crust.) Arugula was a perfect spicy accent to the sweetness of the caramelized onions.*Gnocchi: Wished it was more pillow-like in texture rather than tough. Pesto tasted incredibly fresh and bright though, and the green beans were an interesting choice.*Beef fillets: Fav dish of the night because they were cooked perfectly at medium rare.*Fondue: Can't go wrong with a bowl of melted dark chocolate and sweet ripened strawberries. We polished this off quickly though, and honestly had SO much chocolate left that we ended up just eating forkfuls of this for a while.Overall what we enjoyed-*Smaller portions of family-style Italian plates kind of like tapas = HUGE variety*Affordable dinner for the quantity and differing types of food*Warm and inviting, with food prep such as cutting bread and slicing meat out in the open to view*Ultra fresh ingredients with made-to-order dishes brought out immediatelyOther minor overall gripes-*Would have loved readily available parm with the olive oil on the table*Warmed up bread is better than cold that sits out all dinner"
"This place is AMAZING!!!  I had never had Italian tapas, but Quartinos definitely made it work.I wanted to bring my friends, who are from Cali, to something special in Chicago. They definitely enjoyed it. I made reservations on a Friday night at 8:30 PM. We were running a bit late so I called half an hour before our RSVP and luckily they were nice enough to push it to 9:00 pm. Upon our arrival, the lobby was a madhouse. People were elbow to elbow. Luckily, we only had to wait for 5 minutes for our table. For our table for a party of 4 girls, we only ordered four dishes. While its recommended to order more considering its tapas style, the four dishes worked well for us. We got the shrimp risotto, wild arugula salad, paparazzi pizza, and the rigatoni that had chicken and broccoli. All four dishes was delicious. It was nice to share and try a little of everything. We also ordered a bottle of wine which our waiter recommended to us. I forget the name but they have a nice selection. Our bill came out to be 25pp including tax and tips. I highly recommend this place. Come with reservations and a big group so you can try more dishes!"
"Pretty busy... I was here on a Tuesday night and sat in the bar around 8pm.  Felt alive and buzzing.I had the:1.  prosciutto-wrapped figs stuffed with Gorgonzola and drizzled with honey... pretty good, not amazing, but decent and unique.  Probably 9 figs or so.  Sweet, salty, creamy, sticky, crispy, smooshy... all kinds of texture2. Mushroom risotto:  Nice earthy flavor.3. Italian sausage with peppers and onions:  worst dish of the evening.  The sausage lacked spice and flavor.  Surprisingly the peppers and onions didn't add much.  Maybe because they were not cooked much with the sausage.  The broth was bland also.  Stay away.I'd go again to try more things.  It was fun, energetic, etc."
"I had a thoroughly enjoyable meal here tonight: crisp romaine hearts salad; shared Caprese salad; farmhouse chicken, perfectly tender with a tangy/zesty light sauce; some of a friend's tiramisu (special). I also enjoyed some of the small but diverse bottled beer selection: Founders Centennial IPA and Great Lakes Brewing Co.'s Eliot Ness Vienna Lager, both outstanding (reviewed separately on ratebeer.com). (Unfortunately, no drafts.) Food prices were quite reasonable. Beer at $6 was standard for a restaurant and the quality of beer. Service was great. Note that the place is quite loud, and the restaurant was packed on a Thursday; make reservations."
"Very popular, love the ravioli and pizza, once you are seated and ordered, food comes out as soon as kitchen prepares it."
"Amazed at how the servings were big enough for our group and the price was so reasonable! And everything we ordered tasted great! We went there on a busy Friday night,we got lucky and found seats by the bar. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu."
This restaurant simply deserves 5 stars. No second thoughts about it.Things I love quartino for-Small portions hence more variety of food that can be tried out.Everything from starters to desserts is deliciousFood is fresh Ambience is greatService is fast!
"Before tonight I probably would have given Quartino 4+- 5'atars. After tonight Will not go back. Food was. Ok but service was horrible. If you are sharing Small plates which is what this restaurant is all about you need servers to clear plates and be a little attentive. This was not the case, I could go on and on but won't  sad to say we have crossed this off our list"
"I often like to snark it up and use Yelp reviews as a place to get out some comedic urges, for better or worse.  I'm not sure I can infuse this review with comedy as my feelings for Quartino are that sincere.  I know, right?  Don't take away my Enid Coleslaw fan club membership.  I planned a holiday lunch for my office here (pregnant boss=party early in the season=easier to get reservations/good rates) and couldn't have been happier.  The private party menu itself is extensive and easily customizable, and really quite reasonable price wise.  I worked with Julie, and she was very helpful in assisting me with the organizing logistics and had no issues accommodating annoying questions and a couple of special requests.  The service on the day of the lunch was equally on par, and everyone was very attentive and genuinely nice.  Our serving captain even brought out a photocopied box cover for the DVD that was on screen when asked what the film was.  It's ""Seduced and Abandoned"" if you're interested.  I know I was desperate to know.  Apparently there's some wild antics in that movie.The food was also very good, and the calamari defied the laws of physics and nature by being perfectly crisp despite being served buffet style.  Beet salad was another universal hit amongst the guests.  Lasagna was a little on the watery side, but still tasty.  The orecchiete made up for it.  The co-workers enjoyed it (as a newbie employee planning the office party, I was nervous!) and the space was lovely.  I wouldn't hesitate to plan a private event here again.  P.S.  The layout of the restrooms upstairs is really bizarre.  Just check it out.  Also, the handsoap is Borax!  Awesome."
"Other reviews are accurate in saying it's a loud and busy place but even if that's not your typical style, don't let it deter you from making reservations. We began our evening for two with a delightful bottle of Cabernet - only $20. And their $35 for 4 course deal was enough for two to share. Not to mention their gluten-free menu has a variety of options for every course so you don't feel like you're missing out. Even all of their pasta sauces are gluten-free! We had the Caprese Salad, Penne alla Vodka, Beef Short Ribs, and Gran Coppa Quartino. The vodka sauce was spicier than any I've had before but still tasted great and even my non-gluten-free guest enjoyed it on the gluten-free pasta. The beef short ribs I did not find spectacular but the caprese salad and ice cream dessert (served in a stainless steel martini glass) I would absolutely order again.Next gluten-free dishes to try are the Risotto (pretty much any variation) and the Veal Skirt Steak.Gluten Free Menu: quartinochicago.com/glut…"
"I went here last weekend for my best friend's birthday for the first time.  It was a Saturday night, so the wait was about an hour (we didn't have reservations), but we were able to find a table near the bar with no wait.  We ordered the dates wrapped in prosciutto, sausage pizza, and broccolini.  All three entrees were delicious, especially the pizza.  The service was excellent, and the prices weren't terrible.  I would like to go back to try their pasta dishes!"
"This place is the perfect combination of great food and good prices. It is a fun, tapas-style Italian restaurant. Pizzas are excellent, and I also recommend the meatball slider (one per person). It's highly recommended if you are looking for a restaurant to go with a couple of friends, since all the food is made to share.The place gets crowded every night, so try to make a reservation."
One of the busiest places in Chicago. Tapas style food is excellent clams were great. Thin crust pizza great Italian wines serves in carafes. Great service. Need to work on clearing tables before bringing out more food though.
"This place was a gem of a find! We got really lucky and found an open reservation here for New Year's Eve. We LOVE eating family style and getting to try more than a few things on the menu, so Quartino was perfect for us. Italian food is easy to make, but extremely difficult to make well. I've only been to two Italian places that have made memorably delicious Italian food, and this is one of them. Everything we ordered made us say ""mmmm..."" The food was well seasoned, cooked to perfection and served in perfect proportions for one person to eat all him/herself or for at least 4 people to be able to share pretty fairly. Between the four of us, we got 5 pasta dishes, a pizza and a bottle of wine and I think it only came out to be around $30/person...fantastic!! Reasonably priced, great service, absolutely delicious food. I can't wait to come back!!"
"I've always liked this place. I come here for a chill night- if you come on the weekends you usually get smashed by the dating crowd. I like coming here in the week, the food is good and its about 10 bucks per person- I usually share with a friend, but Im a small eater. One plate typically works for one person, especially if you have the pastas or the pizzas. Oh and they have a $6 table white wine... its a good deal!Service is not very fast, but Im usually in good company and so I dont really notice the lag. The place itself is super nice, love all the wood and the layout is charming. Im probably the one person who doesnt like the patio, and thats cos its on State Street. Dont get me wrong, I love people watching, but its just dusty with tons of fumes and honking instead. I'll sit inside and let the window be my filter."
"I'm not sure why this place has so many great ratings. Disclaimer: I'm a vegetarian. All the food we got was okay, but bland. Just not nearly enough seasoning, even in the white bean dip. (How hard is it to throw in a few more cloves of garlic?!) House red wine was pretty gross, albeit in sort of a charming way. Service was good. People were nice.We went on a Saturday night, and there were a ridiculous number of bachelorette parties  of the 22-24 year old bride variety. Environment was very loud, though I enjoyed the aesthetics of the place."
"3.5! Came here with some college friends when I was visiting Chicago. We were seated promptly because I had made a reservation (whew). It was bustling and pretty packed on a Thurs night. Our server was very clear about how the portions were moderately sized and how it would be best for us to share. We shared the:- beef short ribs - very soft and fell off the bone. Good flavor, very tender.- tortellini - wanted to try this because it's handmade. it was fresh, but not outstanding. the prosciutto gave it some good flavor and saltiness.- trevisella - prosciutto, radicchio and balsamic sauce. the radicchio was interesting... but overall there was a little something off about the cheese / crust.- DONUTS with chocolate sauce. mmm, those were good.Good atmosphere and I can see how this place is really fun. But, the food was just a-ok."
"A total win. We walked in for a glass of wine. Well, they don't ""do"" glasses of wine they do wine by the 1/4 liter, 1/2 liter, liter or bottle starting at $5! Believe me, these prices are unheard of in Chicago from what I saw the week I was there. I went with the $7 1/4 liter of Banfi Toscana, 2008. 1/4 liter is about 1 1/2 glasses and was exceptional for the price.I intended on heading to the Purple Pig for dinner but after glancing at the menu at Quartino, we quickly decided to stay.  They have a decent priced food menu.  I had the veal meatball slider, was very good despite the slightly over chewy bun. I tasted the Tagliatelle alla bolgonase and it knocked me off my feet. This is one of the best pasta dishes I have tasted. Perhaps having something to do with the house made pasta.Quartino also carries pizzas, seafood and what they label specialties such as braised duck leg and veal osso bucco.One thing to be aware of is the bar area gets loud."
Excellent food!great service!Very good prices!What more can you ask for..
"I live right by this place and have been a few times. It has a lot of choices of reliable Italian dishes and is reasonably priced. Mostly small plates. The place can get crowded and for whatever reason people like to block the sidewalk in front of it, but that aside a good place to have some wine or drinks and share small plates with friends. The outside seating is prime people watching so  try to get a patio table."
Great pizza and pasta at fair prices. They made a small error and took care of our ENTIRE bill. I have been here a few times and it will continue to be my favorite place for Italian variety in Chicago.
"I stopped here for a quick dinner at the bar, since I had to be somewhere in a half hour.  I ordered the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo, which are wide egg noodles with a braised beef tomato sauce - it was delicious.  The plates are on the smaller side, since they're sharing portions, but it was just the right amount of pasta goodness.I was in and out in under 30 minutes.  Service was very quick and the bartenders were very friendly.  Good food and reasonable prices - I'll be back."
"Came here for a super late lunch. Had some calamari, delicious. Garganelli with lamb ragu was flavorful but a little too rich/heavy. I had to take bites of calamari in between, it was sort of overwhelming. The linguini with clams, on the other hand, was too light. All in all, a pretty successful meal though. We left stuffed, and the prices were reasonable for the area."
"so not going to lie i tried to get girl and the goat but found out they are booked beyond belief. quartino was the option i landed on after hours of studying chicago reviews. it was STELLAR. its great because its italian style tapas essentially = order tons of plates = not get full since they are all small = you sample everything = you cry tears of joy food was stellar. in addition you can split many of the pastas which just gives you more excuses to try more stuff. only downside was some candied banana dessert that was full of crap and nothing special. it wasn't bad just boring and i kicked myself because i thought it would be different but it wasn't. of course the other dessert(s) made up for it. staff was great and do the valet because the garage next to it, even though more work is actually MORE expensive. place is a little crowded and if you can try to get a table away from any banquet areas. too much foot trafficJEANS: OK since there are tons of tourist in teh area and some show up with a tshirt but try not tooORDER: wait staff"
"I took my cousins here.  They really enjoyed and Fumie would have loved this place.   Fresh , high quality ingredients matched with excellent service.   You can tell just by walking in that you're going to have a good time.    I'd take the waiter's recommendation and also reserve reservations via opentable.     We had all the top suggestions like duck prosciutto, short rib, shoulder, salmon, etc etc.   Highly highly recommended."
This is where we had our first lunch when we started settling down in Chicago. Its hands down our favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago and we have had better Italian than this only in Italy. Like this place even better in summers when you can sit at the patio or the terrace. I am a big fan of small plates as we get to try more things. Love their gnocchi and  tiramisu.
"Was really happy with our experience here. The food tasted great and portions were just right so that you could still enjoy dessert with pain from being overstuffed. :-) Service was great too. If I had to be critical of ANYTHING, it would be that we were sat at a table for two where it felt a little cramped with everything on the table. This was not a big deal for long though as I was focused on some very tasty food at good prices."
"We were looking for a place that was a relatively short walk from our hotel where we could get Italian food and sit outside - this place was the perfect choice!We got a table right away, but it was relatively early on a Friday night. The waiter was very good and did a good job explaining how the menu worked. We enjoy tapas restaurants so this was great for us.We tried one of the pizzas. It was good, but probably a bit too big for a small group at this type of restaurant. The pastas were our favorite, particularly the gnocchi.One word of warning: we sat at the outdoor tables at street level. Just in case you don't know that the red line goes directly under State Street, you'll be quickly be reminded every 10 minutes or so. It didn't affect our enjoyment...it just interrupted the conversation a few times :-)"
"Love the atmosphere and the family concept. Went with a friend and was sat at the smallest table in the place and shared gnocchi and pork shank. It was hard to eat on such a small table with plates taking up half the space. The pork shank is amazing, gnocchi I would pass on. Service was nice and when we didn't like the dessert the server took it off the bill. I would go back again and try something else."
"Excelent italian tapas style restaurant. Share and enjoy!! Try to make a reservation or enjoy your meal at the bar or tall tables, both options are great."
"Quartinos would fit well into a romcom movie scene. the interior has a retro, little Italy bistro vibe (though it's huge) and you can always count on it to be bustling with merry groups of people. most importantly, the food is always on point - i particularly love their thin crust Margherita pizza and oh-so-tender, thinly sliced skirt steak. italian tapas has never tasted so good! this is one of my favorite chicago spots and i recommend it to everyone. make reservations!"
"Last meal before heading back to SF...glad we came here.  The lunch special consists of three items your choice from different parts of the menu.  We tried the veal meatballs, linguini with clams, and braised pork.  First of all, these portions are huge.  Veal meatballs were soft and ricotta cheese went well with the sauce.  The linguini is easily enough by itself to make a huge meal.  I have never had so many clams in a pasta dish before.  Pasta was cooked just beyond Al dente; perfect.  Pork shank was great too, but we were too stuffed to even make a dent in the massive piece of meat so soft we were pulling away layers with a fork.  For $25 I think we just ate a $60+ meal."
I loved it and we will be back! The pizza was just wonderful.
"Visiting Chicago and found this place close to hotel. Have to give this a 5 star as food was authentic, great atmosphere and service. Highly recommend"
"Good food, great energy!"
"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED MY MEAL AT QUARTINO! I was visiting Chicago with my friend, and we ate here twice because we loved it so much! The service is excellent, the food is delicious, and everything is well priced. I would recommend getting the Veal Meatballs and Cavatelli! The Veal Meatballs were really juicy and full of flavor. The sweet raisins on top added a nice dose of extra tastiness. The Cavatelli was equally excellent. Probably some of the best pasta I have ever had. It tasted very fresh, and the ricotta cheese on top was a perfect touch.However, the best part of the meal was definitely dessert. Get the TIRAMISU. The chef makes limited quantities everyday, so it's not on the dessert menu, but it is the best tiramisu I have ever had in my entire life. Some places make it too soft or put too much amaretto, but honestly this one was perfect. Every bite I died and went to heaven."
Extremely friendly waiter. Had the eggplant parm and calamari. Eggplant was very tasty. Calamari a little salty but good. Exceptional value for the money. Also noticed nice upstairs private room for parties.
"Had an excellent dining experience here. I was with a business group of +30, so we rented out the upstairs and had a pre-planned menu. I honestly can't remember anything I ate, but all of it was good. True Italian food, and not super, super pricey. The bottom floor and bar areas were packed, so that speaks for itself. If I'm back downtown I'll try this place out with a smaller dining party."
"I LOVE Quartino. I've been here before with just a handful of friends and the service and food has always been great. Some of my favorites are: the caprese salad, which has big, generous portions of mozzarella (yummm); the tortellini with prosciutto and peas (anything with prosciutto is a plus in my book!); linguini with clams; and the lamb ragu. All of the portions are hearty and filling. I also particularly love the peach bellini -- a nice, fruity, and girly way to get my buzz on.I also love the casual, energetic ambiance of Quartino. This includes everything down to the mismatched plates and utensils, the family-style plates, the chatter of conversation...I recently planned a reunion event with over 25 people here. I just have to say that the service was truly exceptional. I unfortunately bugged the woman who plans private events, Julie Jensen, several times with changes in the reservation and questions about the menu. Every time, she was prompt in returning my messages and patient about answering my questions. When our party actually got to the restaurant, the waiter was also amazing -- friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The food came out quickly, which was impressive given the size of our party as well as the number of other patrons that night. What was also great was that we never felt rushed to leave even though we definitely took up the majority of the second floor!Love this place!!"
"We came here for an early dinner on a Friday. I made a reservation using Yelp and it couldn't have been a smoother process. We were seated right away which is a plus. I was looking forward to sitting on their 2nd floor outdoor balcony, but sadly it was closed that afternoon (not sure why...). Our table was technically inside, but had an outdoor feeling due to the big windows. It was nice having a great view of the city streets without feeling claustrophobic from pedestrians. Our waiter was the best! Mike was super attentive and very knowledgeable on the menu and the wine list. I was struggling between which wine to get and he brought me a sample of each and let me pick based on the taste. It was strange drinking the wine out of a small glass cup, but it was tasty so no complaints there.The food was good. We started off with the Gorgonzola cheese plate appetizer that comes with a side choice of grapes in olive oil, apricot puree, or fennel salad. When our plate arrived, we were given all three sides to sample with the cheese. Apricot puree was so delicious and the perfect complement with the creamy cheese slices. For the entrees, we split braised pork ravioli and the rigatoni with chicken, cream, and broccoli.This was my first time at an Italian tapas restaurant and the portions were perfect for sharing. We left with full bellies and no leftovers, it was too hard to put the forks down. Coppa al Banana dessert - I'll see you next time ."
"Rock solid Italian.  Beef short Rib... Wow!  Another great experience in Chicago.  Italian food in a bistro type atmosphere, great energy, food is a nice departure from what I call 'Red Sauce Italian'. There's enough of that in Chicago.  Quartino takes you to some other tastes of Italy and does it all very well.  Almost a tapas type service of smaller plates, which I happen to prefer, so to enjoy many different dishes.  The worst thing I can say about Quartino:  The washrooms are on the second floor, but they are well decorated."
"Good selection of tasty food - small plates.  Fun atmosphere, but a little bit loud inside. I like that they play old Italian movies on TVs around the restaurant.  Great breads & yummy fondue.  Make a reservation - it gets very crowded."
"Mega-Bistro-Opolis... i think they just added another roof on the roof and squeezed 23 more deuces onto patio by tearing out the shrubbery.good small plates, good flat bread.Too Loud.  not worth the wait which is usually over 30 minutes. If you can get seated in under 15 minutes its fantastic.  If you like the hustle and bustle do it.  Its just starting to feel like more of a hotels.com cafeteria than a casual Italian eatery..."
"What a delightful little corner restaurant in downtown Chicago. The service was excellent, and the restaurant was spacious, yet still quaint. The sangria was great (the red is better than the white), the soup was savory and the prosciutto pizza was perfect. The plates are pretty small - just the right amount for lunch if you're flying solo, and great for sharing 'tapas style' if you're dining with a group. Loved it!"
"Okay, I realize my review really isn't going to add anything new here, but damn, this was some great fried calamari.  Pastas were good, octopus was good, eggplant parm was good, but the fried calamari stole the show, you must get it, no questions asked."
Quality- reliable- and you won't leave hungry. Broccoli rabe is a highlight. Must have pasta and pizza.
"The stress and anxiety of planning a group dinner for 13 people on a Friday night melted away when I chose Quartino. This restaurant does an incredible job with large groups. The dinner menu was planned entirely in advance via email and they have a terrific ""can-do"" attitude. When my group arrived, they were ready for us; and despite the very busy and buzzing atmosphere, it always seemed that they were ready to attend to any of our needs throughout the dinner.Our meal was fantastic, service was nothing short of phenomenal! The staff here are really on top of things, and I didn't have to worry about a thing. A successful dinner party must have something to please everyone, but more importantly, everyone must have a wonderful time over tasty dishes, excellent wine, and memorable conversation. Quartino provides the space, food, service, and overall experience for your dinner party!"
"They had a coupon here for a 5 course dinner for two for dirt cheap, so we gave it a shot. I thought that it may not have been enough food, but man, was I stuffed after the meal. You could pick a cheese, a meat, a salad, a pizza and a pasta. A good combo. The taleggio was amazing, and it was served with some sort of apricot puree. I wasn't a fan of it. It made me feel like I was eating baby food. The boy got the proscuitto, which he liked. The eggplant salad was good, as well as the pesto gnocchi. By this point we were completely full, but we had one more thing to order. We got a pizza, half mushroom tomato and half one with fonduta, tomatoes and basil. The pizza was huge, and not one of those super thin pizzas you normally get at an upscale place.  The mushroom side was great, the fonduta, not so much. I think it was just the cheese on it, as the ricotta gave it a weird texture.Overall, the meal was decent. Service was good. It wasn't anything amazing though. But 5 courses for $30 can't be beat."
"For those who have read my reviews on a consistent basis, you know that I hate those small portioned, foo foo restaurants that are all about the glitz, glitter and ambiance. I want good food and lots of it. The people at Quartino must have known I was coming. They put out a smorgasbord of food that would make the Buffalo Bills, offensive line blush.   My wife and I both ordered the $35.00 restaurant week special. The server warned us that the special was portioned for two people. Of course, I didn't believe him.    We ended up eating so many courses, that I felt like I was about to explode. They were all delicious. By the time our desert was ready, we threw in the towel and asked our server to bag them up.    The highlights of the meal were: The roasted bone marrow: I know some of you think that eating bone marrow is gross. Some think it's a activity that's more suited to canines. My answer to all of you haters is: Arf, arf, bark, bark. If eating bone marrow is wrong, I don't want to be right.    The Italian Fondue was awesome. The cheese was heavy, dense and filling. Not to mention, decadently delicious.     The Beef short ribs were truly amazing. The sauce was the perfect accompaniment to the tender ribs.    The beef fillets were small, but packed a major punch. They were juicy and delicious.   My only complaint about Quartino is the process of being seated. The front of the restaurant was crammed with people waiting to be seated. They really need to open up a bigger waiting area. I'm not complaining about the wait. We were seated in 15 minutes. But in those fifteen minutes I was kicked, elbowed and bruised. Other than the stampede we experienced while waiting to be seated, I have no complaints about Quartino. The service was fabulous and the food was amazing. I can't wait to go back."
"What can I say about this place except that it is AMAZING! I've been here a few times now and I am still WOWed!I first went here last year- I was a bit cautious as the idea of Italian tapas wasn't too exciting. We ordered a few different items and I fell in love. Every dish was better than the next. I went again in Nov after freezing on the architecture tour of the city. We ordered the tomato soup and immediately warmed up. It was the best soup ever..more like a stew with chunks of tomatoes. I compared it more to a marina sauce and mopped up the soup with the bread they served. By far one of the best things I have ever had. We ordered a few more items to share and we left. Another great item is the polenta fries. One member of our party left her purse and one of the busboys chased us down to hand her the purse. He literally ran out, no jacket or anything. We were flabbergasted that someone would do this and not just wait for us to turn around and come back. I went again earlier this year and had more yummy food. I was ""fighting"" with members of my party for the check and her place setting touched the flame in the candle. We started freaking out and immediately someone ran to our table and took care of it. Even though it was the end of our meal, and we had our check, they were nice enough to bring out another setting for her. I can't wait to go there again and have a disaster free meal again!"
"The food there is pretty good and the pastas are pretty great, went there a few months back and love it, the lemonade is pretty good too not just juice but icy as well, and the cute chef gives you you're food :)."
"I really love love love tapas! I adore small plates. This is the place to get them! Get reservations, its hopping on a Saturday and don't be surprised if you overeat. The wait is short and the staff is speedy. Give it a try. You'll love it."
"I recently went to Chicago with my parents, and this was by far the best restaurant we went to the whole trip. The ambiance is really cool - you feel like you are in a real italian restaurant. The service was great and the waitstaff very friendly. Our waiter even took the time to tell us about all his favorite local places to check out while we were there.And then there was the food... The first dish we got was the fondue, and it was the best I have ever had. I really just wanted to forgo all our other orders, and just eat that all night. But everything else was delicious too. Everything is very high quality - either made in house or imported from italy.My only complaint is that they don't have wine glasses, but instead little cups. I didn't care much since I got a cheap wine, but real glasses would be nice..."
"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night, as it was highly recommended by a friend. We were seated upstairs on the outside patio right after a rain storm- which was the first mistake. They said everything was dried off, but our clothes got wet as soon as we sat down. Crammed into the tiniest table, the 4 of us ordered an app and a pizza, but ended up passing on entrees because the service was so bad. Our waiter couldn't have cared less about the service, and a woman from management reprimanded us for keeping our purses on a chair close by. She suggested I check my purse, so I did. I purposely zipped my bag up all the way and when it was returned to me it was unzipped. I knew something fishy was going on and the service was just as sketchy. Worst dinner ever. Service and management really need an upgrade!"
"This was the perfect place to take my parents for din on their first ""couple"" visit to the city while I've lived here.#Winning:1) The waitress was not phased at all when my parents didn't like the wine they had originally ordered, and gave us her thoughts on other wines she thought they would like based on their usual habits.2) The food doesn't all come out at once, and it comes out really quickly, so we could order as we decided how hungry/full we were.3) The Salumeti platter was uh-mayyy-zing. It wouldn't have been enough to feed all three of us if it was the only thing we were getting, but it was perfect along with two other small dishes.4) The waitress put up with a really long story from my dad about where to buy discount wine.5) The whole meal was only $77 for three of us, and that included a bottle of wine!#Losing:1) Super crowded and very loud. We were lucky with our table situation but if we had been in the middle of the restaurant, I'm sure my mom would have put her earplugs in like usual.2)...I really don't have anything else to say here!"
"Quartino has reset my standard for Italian cuisine. The food was absolutely delicious and came in smaller portions, so it was perfect for us because we wanted to try different dishes. I strongly recommend the pancetta wrapped dates and the shrimp dishes. The ambiance of the restaurant is great with the family style setting. The service was a little slow on the particular night we were there, which was understandable considering the fact that the restaurant was full and it was a Saturday night."
"Came here with the husband and the in laws. I think maybe we were both spoiled by amazing Italian restaurants (Spiaggia, Cafe Spiaggia, Davanti Enoteca, or any restaurant on Taylor street), we just didn't think Quartino was a 4-star rated restaurant on Yelp. Here's what we ordered: - Veal meatball slider: gosh the meat was dry. If it were not for the sauce and the fact I was really hungry, I don't think I could've managed to swallow it. -Dates wrapped in pancetta: average. But it wasn't too hot, tasted like the plate had been waiting at the kitchen to be picked up for at least 15 minutes. -Gnocchi: salty, salty, salty. One note, too salty. -Tagliatelle: the meat sauce was good, but after couple of bites, it went back to the salty taste. -Linguini with clam: the clams tasted fresh, the red sauce on the other hand, was very watery, and ha, salty! -Steamed clam: I know, two dishes with clams, but the in-laws said clams are good for liver after heavy drinking...No need to say, it's kinda salty. -Roasted baby octopus: the octopus was cooked very well, but for a $11 plate, there were only four tiny pieces on it. I was unhappy. -Italian donuts: after a very salty meal, I was glad to have something sweet. The donuts were fluffy, melt in your mouth, and dipped in honey and chocolate sauce was the best combo! I love love it! But donuts weren't going to save Quartino's rating--this would be my last time coming here."
Yummy small plates.  A great way to try many dishes.  Great for group sharing.
"Ate dinner here on May 25, 2014. Our server was Andrea. This was the second time we ate here, and it was thoroughly enjoyable. When the weather permits, patio dining is highly recommended. The food is very good, but the portions are small -- and the wait staff and menus let you know this in advance. They encourage you to order a number of dishes, and share. Not sure how practical that is, given the small portions. They also let you know that the dishes will come out at different times, so this is a restaurant that encourages your party to take its time. Don't come here if you're in a rush. All of the dishes our party of four had were terrific, though the sausage risotto had very little detectable sausage (they said it was ground-in).  When I mentioned the apparent dearth of sausage, they promptly put in an additional order at no charge. The service is friendly, and the location in the Near North is great. A couple doors away is a great piano bar: Red Head Piano Bar. Enjoy!"
I'm a big fan of Quartino's....you can't go wrong taking a group or a date or a friend here.  It literally has something great for everyone.  They really make the tapa concept work great here.  I've had very few dishes that I haven't loved.  Some of my favorites are as follows:-The short ribs are great...juicy and tender and the salsa verde sauce works well with it. -The mushroom risotto is simple yet nice.  I love risotto but don't always like to order it as my main entree so it really works for me as a tapa to share. -Polenta fries - Probably one of my favorite things on the menu  BUT please bring me more of the sauce! -We ordered an olive plate and one of the olives was stemmed and salty...kind of like okra with no pits.  I can't remember the name but I loved them.  Overall a great place to go and I love the subway tile and millwork throughout the restaurant.
"Quartino was part of the highlights for my recent Chicago visit. This place is amazing, not only do they have delicious food (tried 6 different courses and all 6 were yummy), the staff is very welcoming and the atmosphere is amazing. If you like Italian food, you want to pay the right price, and you want to have a great time, go Quartino"
"First time dining at Quartino.  We were a party of 8,  Very busy, energetic, noise level is high. We were seated promptly, our reservation was at 6.  We had a round table which is nice with a larger group however, conversation across the table not really possible without shouting.The server was very good.  Explained about the portion sizes and gave recommendations on how many plates etc.We had:Olives, eggplant caponata, artichoke something, salumette, prosciutto, taleggio, pocorino and asiago cheeses.  All very good.Crispy calamari was delicious.Polenta Fries - YUMTagliatelle alla bolognesePenne vodka sauceBeef short rib - melt in your mouthshrimp - excellent, ordered two of thesemargherita pizza.  I thought the pizza was perfect.  The bottom crust had that nice crisp bite, not soggy at all, the outer crust was slightly chewy.  Just how I like my pizza.For dessert we ordered the profiteroles and the zeppole - all very very good.We ordered the Orviete, a nice medium white and the Dolcetto d'alba, a lighter red but everyone loved both wines.Had a great time, didn't feel rushed and everyone seemed to enjoy the food.  What more could you ask for?(someone else to pick up the bill...!)"
"The one serious drawback to this place is the noise level, which is deafening at times.  On our last visit we got the worst or possibly the best table in the place.  There's a table at the top of the stairs in the upper level that gets double blasts of noise rising from below and noise from the second floor.  However, the guys in my party were entertained by the constant stream of young women in LBDs and heels tottering up and down the stairs to get to the ladies room.  So A for people watching, D for noise.Decor is fun - worn wooden tables, white subway tile, vintage light fixtures, and cotton dish towels as napkins.  The dishes are presented as small plates for sharing.  Some aren't all that small though so the meal is hearty.  The thin crust pizza had a nice crispy crust with a balanced red sauce.  The pizza rustica had crispy thin sliced potatoes and rosemary, a savory surprise.The lasagna had a very flavorful sauce, maybe a tad too sweet.  The pasta was very tender.  We also tried chunks of pecorino, three kinds of olives, and tasty thinly sliced, cured meat.  We ordered these items separately but they arrived nicely presented on a board with the addition of cucumber vinaigrette, chewy bread and a delicate apricot spread.On previous visits we've tried the veal sliders, pasta with beef short ribs, and the bone marrow - all nicely presented and very good.  There's an extensive wine list with many choices offered in small portions.  It's a good place to go with friends - enjoy the food and be prepared to yell if you want to have a conversation."
"Food, wine, service, everything was fantastic. I've been once for apps/drinks, and it was great. Dinner was an even better experience. In fact, I ended up walking a couple blocks in the rain, and they gave me a dry soccer jersey (that the servers wear). So, yes, excellent service, rivaling their excellent food."
"Wonderful Italian restaurant with a great atmosphere, delicious food, and great price. We split 6 dishes family style. We had a nice balance of salads, fish, and meat. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable. Definitely will need a reservation but can call the day of usually. 5 of us with drinks got out for 150. Defibitely a feat for a great meal in Chicago!"
"FINALLY!  i've been DY-ING to try this place for months and months.  i decided to treat myself for making it to 31.5.  birthday dinner!i was able to sit outside on this gorgeous night.  i felt like i was in italy, although i've never been, so i fig, this is close enough to the dream.  i ordered a kim crawford sauv blanc, my fave.  i had a veal meatball slider, which was nice and moist.  tasty.  side of homemade jardiniere.  per the server's recs, i ordered the cavatelli, which was tasty.  just ricotta and basil in a red sauce.  super simple, but the homemade-ness of the pasta was totes awes.  after all that, i went to the bar and ordered another glass of kim and the zeppole w dark choc sauce.  nice finish.i am definitely coming back.  it was the perfect 1/2 birthday dinner - a long time coming - finally, a good birthday celebration."
"Me and my husband  wanted something good to eat saw this place and wanted to try the food , the place had very yummy food  and everything was so good we would come back for dinner or lunch anytime this place feel like home and great for the family or any party."
"Great restaurant with wonderful service, delicious food, and an adorable atmosphere.  It reminded me a little of a French bistro in NYC (like Pastis), but it was definitely an Italian menu.  We had a feast of asparagus risotto, salmon, a cheese platter, duck prosciutto, and tortellini.  The half portions are really such a nice option so that you can try a ton of stuff, and the homemade pasta is perfection.  The duck proscuito was tender and flavorful, and the cheese platter -- including the accoutrements -- was delightful.  I highly recommend this place.  Also, our server was the sweetest and most helpful person, and the total bill for all the above and wine was under $100."
Quartino's is always a good option when I'm in Chicago. Food and service are good. But be aware that it is loud.
"Legit. I have eaten here, every time I've been to Chicago, and it is always a highlight.Maybe the Italian food just sucks real bad in L.A., that I am unable to compare to anything decent, but from tastes, this place is not only authentic, but affordable... and really fucking tasty.I took my colleague here and I was worried that maybe he wouldn't share my enthusiasm. Turns out, he thought it was one of better Italian restaurant he has been too.The waiters will fill you in on what to order, if you have any uncertainty."
"Great food, even better service! We had a table for 14 and the waitress was running about making sure everyone had what they wanted and no one went home hungry. I was surprised and would highly recommend this place not only for their excellent pasta and pizza but also amazing service!"
"Nicholas was the best host! He was welcoming and accommodating, and got us in on a busy Saturday night without a reservation. The server was spot on, friendly and knew the menu front to back. The food was delicious and served quickly. Get the prosciutto pizza!"
"Chicago has some fabulous food, but Quartino is not it -- everything is fine -- no more, no less.  We went on a Friday night and had to battle 20 other couples to get to the hostess -- thankfully we had a rez -- but if you don't, unless you're ready to cut a bitch, good luck snagging a table  -- once you've actually secured your seat, you'll notice that everything on the menu sounds wonderful, but arrives at the table lacking real flavor or inspiration.  We tried the beet salad, caprese salad, chilled zucchini starter, lemony shrimp, seared octopus, eggplant parm, and tiramisu -- the chilled zucchini was actually really yummy -- it had this lovely char on it, but the shrimpies tasted frozen and the octopus was a tad rubbery.  Oh, but I would happily swim in a pool of the tiramisu cream.  Overall, more disappointments than tastebud victories. What is fantastic is that it has a pretty large, pretty tasty, and VERY CHEAP WINE LIST.  Cheap as in we got a good bottle of pinot for $10. I would suggest Quartino if you're going out with friends who think Maggiano's is AWESOME, and who don't mind raising their voices to be heard by the person next to them -- the place gets hopping so it's not for the hard of hearing geriatrics in your life.Din for 3 w/ wine was $93 total, w/o tip -- very reasonable -- easy to try a lot for very little monies, so overall, not a bad experience...just not...memorable."
Came here very late one night to grab a bite after my flight landed.  Staff were absolutely wonderful.  The food itself was tasty but a tad overpriced.
"This place gets 4 stars for the food and service. I have eaten here several times in Chicago. This trip was the worst. The restaurant was SO LOUD. RIDICULOUSLY LOUD!! It was horrible. We were at a 4-person table and could not have a conversation. It seems to be a ""Mecca"" of bachelorette parties (aka large groups) which probably adds to the volume level. I had my two 6-year olds along. Our reservation was for 7:00. My only thing is I would do it earlier next time because the crowd is a bit ""frisky"" for my kids.Overall this is a great place. We were seated on time for our reservation which scores BIG points for me. A must-try on the menu is the great value ($25) salumeria tasting. Seriously this was AMAZING!!! So fantastic. We ordered it and a few tables around us ordered it after seeing how awesome ours was. Love this place...next time I will leave my kids at home though and try for a less-busy night."
"Fantastic place to go with friends or a date, priced right with great portion size and a solid wine menu for the type of place it is. Home made pasta is wonderful and the veal sliders are awesome. Pizza is great!"
"I took my visiting Mom to Quartino's. Everything was great as before. But this time, she wanted to try the Gelato/Gelati. Sweet lord. Delicious (and cheap!!). Quartino's, you have my heart... well, my stomach's heart, at least."
"In Chicago for one night and went here. I wanted something I couldn't get back home. Warm decor. Dark but moody. The waiters are in jeans with soccer shirts but its casual to fancy. It's loud with laughing and plates clinking. You can eat outside, in the dining room or at the bar. Service was great. Nice wine selection. Got the $5 blanco and it was really good!"
"I really enjoyed Quartino despite having sort of an odd timed reservation here. We arrived early afternoon so we decided to have a quick snack at Quartino since we still had dinner that night. When we arrived, it was an easy walk form Michigan and the restaurant was fairly empty when we were there mid-afternoon. It's nice to know this place is still open because I'm so used to places closing between lunch and dinner that it is sometimes hard to find something to eat.We got a few little dishes to share including bruschetta and some small pasta salad as well as a prosciutto dish and they were all very yummy! I still can't get over the hard bread that you always get at these places ... I like my bread soft and my butter spreadable. Overall, the service was, great, the restaurant definitely has a rustic small hole in the wall feel although it's quite large, and the bathrooms are really interesting!"
"I stopped at Quartino prior to heading to the O'hare  for my flight home to LA. We wanted to grab some food for our flight. I ended up ordering a Soprano pizza, topped with Veal Meatballs and Pickled Veggies (Cauliflower, Onion, Carrots, Peppers). It was very tasty. The staff was very nice as well, even offering us water as we waited for our to-go orders to be prepared."
"I love Quartino! It was a regular spot for my friend and I when we were living in Chicago, and when we're back in town Quartino will be our spot once again. We became quite fond of the bartender Erik, because he's friendly & personable, and great at his job - especially when it comes to pouring carafes of wine! The restaurant and bar is always super busy, so we always opted out of waiting for dining room service and sat where ever we wanted in the bar. That being said, the hostesses are all very beautiful so if you get to talk to them, the wait may not seem like such a bad option. The food is great! Our go to dishes were the Beet Salad (yum!), Chilled Zucchini, or any of the awesome vegetarian pizza choices, which are gourmet style with creative topping combinations. For a Chicago restaurant, Quartino does offer quite a few options for vegetarians, (YAY!!) One time we ordered a pizza that already had several toppings on it and asked to have fresh arugula added. The pizza arrived shortly after with a huge pile of crispy arugula on top! They know what they're doing. The service is fast! Each item takes about five minutes to arrive once you have ordered it. It makes the whole situation very simple as you can sit there drinking your wine and order as you please until you are full. I like that. They always give you bread and oil before your meal and it's difficult not to dig in and eat a whole bunch - It's filling! They also top everything with a healthy dose of oil, which is nice to indulge in, but oil is fattening, and in my eyes is unnecessary in most cases. Lemon or lime juice is a much tastier, fresher, and healthier topping for salads!The price, service, food, wine, and atmosphere are all Excellent - Quartino is awesome!"
"Always a wonderful experience when I come here. Wonderful selection of wines, so far I've tried their Riesling, Cab & Malbec. all exquisite. We started off with Melanzane as an appetizer along with Sun dried tomato soup (yum!)  For entree I had the the tortellini with peas & prosciutto. Everything was delish. The service was also excellent. I'm definitely a fan of this place!"
"Place effing rocks. Based on street front would not have went, on the initial entry, would not have expected what amazing dinner was to come!! Con: skip the polenta  fries... Too fried and soggy-ish... Ok here we go: mushroom risotto: awesomeBaby spinach: rockedBeets: awesomeWhite bean garlic spread: awesomeDuck prosciutto: greatCaprese: good, not awesome, but goodTiramisu: awesomeZappole: super duper awesome - honey and chocolateWait staff rocks, bus boys rock... Environment: little on the noisy side... But cool, table against the wall a must... Coming back for sure!!!!"
"A lot of good item, nothing overly amazing.  The price was right and its a fun place to go.  I will definitely be back to satisfy a tapas craving."
"I wandered here with some friends because it was near our hotel, and it seemed like we might be able to score some seats on the patio.  We drank opinionated Italian wine, and snacked on fondue, short ribs, meatballs, gnocchi, and white bean dip.  And then we were utterly shocked to learn that the bill, with plenty of wine, was only $20/person.  Ah, Chicago!"
"Italian tapas restaurant out of any kind of pasta on Saturday night at 10 pm!!!!!! Really??????? However,   Pizza is delicious and runs for $11. Try Tortellini and angus beef capaccio."
Always a great experience!
"I met a friend for lunch. She was running late so I ordered a glass of malbec and waited patiently.The wine came in a small carafe and I was left to pour it for myself....nice.Once my friend arrived we dined on:A sputini of Artichokes Campobasso Baby Artichokes, Onions, Carrots, & EVOOProsciutto Di Parma Italian Ham, Aged 18 Months served with gardinieraAsiago Vecchio Cow's Milk, Sharp, Tangy, Semi-Soft served with apricot pureeA pizza - Fumo Negli Occhi Smoked Provolone, Speck, & Baby SpinachandA pasta - Cavatelli Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, & Fresh RicottaWe shared, we laughed, service was great.Bike parking across the street."
"Pros:-Great location-Helpful, welcoming staff-Small/shared dishes mean you get more variety-Tasty food-An extensive wine list/options-Good ambianceCons:-Expensive-Potentially long wait (we just beat the rush on a weekday before 7pm)-Some of the dishes aren't particularly impressive"
"what can you say about Quartino? this place is simply amazing. I've been here with the gf about 3 times now and we always recommend it to people. it can get a little packed but even so the service is great, the staff has great insight if you don't know what to order and most importantly, the food and wine is perfection. we've tried a couple of the pizzas and they were excellent each and every time. our favorite part is the wine. we were recommended the If You See Kay cab and i cant find a wine i enjoy more since trying that. everything about this place screams 5 stars. cant wait till i come back and try more pizza."
"I have to say I love this restaurant. The ambiance, the food, the staff. However, if you don't like a restaurant that is packed -- this isn't the place for you. I came here on a Friday night and every table was filled, which wasn't a problem to me.Moving on to the food. Here is what we ordered:-Veal Meatball Slider: This was so tasty. The veal was juicy, and cooked perfectly. -Dates Wrapped in Pancetta: This was really rich for me. It was definitely delicious, but not something I could eat a lot of. -Cavatelli: Absolutely delicious. The flavors of the tomato, fresh basil, and ricotta were incredible. I would order this dish again.-Sea Scallops: The scallops were cooked to perfection. I was impressed with how good these were. Another dish I will order again. -Crisp Calamari: I wish these had a little bit more seasoning, but these were also cooked to perfection. I'm very picky about my seafood and I truly enjoyed these. Dessert-Coppa al Banana: This dessert was divine. It was a great way to end the meal, not too heavy and the biscotti was great dipped in the gelato.-Cappucino: If you've never had Lavazza coffee or espresso before, I highly recommend it.  I will be back to Quartino again in the near future. Great  food and the prices are totally reasonable."
"Nice atmosphere, family style. Delicious tapas!! beef tenderloin, calamari, lava chocolate cake - very delicious! Highly recommended!"
"This was the best Italian food I have ever had. We got the olive, cheese and salami to start with some chianti, wow! We could have stopped there and been 100% satisfied. Our main course was the margarita pizza, I have had many in my life and this was the best one ever. For the price, this place is amazing. We will be back!"
"This place is casual, affordable and a great place to share a bottle of wine and a pizza with a friend."
"Loved, loved, loved the atmosphere. Even better than that was the tortellini...oh my goodness, that it what I imagine pasta tasting like in Italy! The Alfredo sauce was great too. We also had the pizza. We prefer the thin crust style and it was perfect! I wish we could take this place back to Texas with us."
Big fan of Quartino!  Been back several times.  The latest was for my brother's 22nd bday dinner in July.  I had to make a reso a week or so in advance for a table.  We came a bit early to try and sit outside but that was an additional 45 minute wait.  So we opted for our original inside table.  It was very crowded and loud in the dining room even at 6pm on a Tuesday night.  Our server couldn't have been nicer and explained to my family how the dinner menu works.  We ordered a bunch of dishes and shared everything.  As usual everything was good especially the gnocchi's and pizza's!! Have to love the wine list too!  We go back often for wine and appetizers.  Hopefully next time we will be able to sit outside!
"I agree with fellow yelpers, this restaurant is pretty loud, but that's probably because everyone is have such a great time and enjoying the great food and service. Honestly, my group was one of the louder groups in the restaurant, we had a ball. And our server, Aldo was fairly entertaining! Food is tapas style and I loved almost all the dishes. Can't say I was overly fond of the Stefano pizza, it was good, just didn't wow me, perhaps because I perfer sauce. Gnoochi was ok.  What I can remember was the organic veal, fabulous and the Pappardelle was also a great choice. Dessert: we didn't necessarily want dessert, but Aldo recommended the Limoncello drink. He had us sold when he mentioned was 100 proof alcohol and tasted like a lemonhead candy (which it did). We ordered a round and let's just say I don't remember the end of our night as we continued drinking. Great times and it started off with a wonderful dinner at Quartino! Worth going to dinner!"
"I would have given this place only three stars, but our waiter was so ridiculously sweet that he elevated the experience to four. Came in a group of four and ordered far too much: shrimp risotto, bone marrow, eggplant parmesean, tortellini, and pizza -- half with pear and gorgonzola, and half with veal meatball. Waiter accidentally gave us pizza with half of the four vegetables, and gave us a whole pizza with the veal meatballs because he 'messed up.' Throughout the dinner, he kept apologizing, and I think my table was charmed by how sincere he was about the mistake -- it wasn't such a big deal to us!But the food was good. Solid, if a little heavy on the garlic. I liked the eggplant parmesan and the tortellini the most. The shrimp risotto is a good bargain given how much shrimp is included, but I thought the shrimp had a weird seawater taste, and the veal meatball pizza was definitely the best of the three we had. The restroom is quite interesting -- reminds me of a stark black and white movie. Still not a fan of bone marrow."
"this city has overrate italian food...quartino is the exception. i've been here at least five times since moving to chicago and have never been disappointed.  inexpensive food, great wine selection, homemade limoncello. need i say more?great date spot.order a tasting platter and a bottle of white wine on the patio. you won't regret it."
"Very tasty tapas/family style in the Italian style.  I'd recommend everything we had, so pretty confident of the whole menu.  A bit crowded and loud, but there's a place and time for that.  They have a solid wine list, with some nice surprises."
Love this place!!! Great service and atmosphere!!! The food is served in a way that helps you try several different things while sharing with others in your table.
"Always love to visit Quartino's when in Chicago. The food is great - try the new kale salad with butternut squash! Also, the veal meatballs are excellent - both preparations are delicious - one with tomato sauce, the other with rich brown sauce and raisins. Thanks to our terrific server for offering a split option - 3 of each - when I couldn't make up my mind. Also had the eggplant parm - lots of cheese - would have liked more eggplant - and I would order it again anyway. They serve these hot items for sharing in little cast iron pans. Excellent wine selection. I like that you can order the amount that suits you  - glass, 1/2 liter, bottle, or liter!! Service was very nice. Timely, friendly, offered suggestions, efficient ! Even thou it was very crowded. Only thing I don't particularly like is the noise level (hence 4 rating). I manage because I love the food. I am definitely a fan!!"
"Came here with a group of work people. The atmosphere was a bit loud...it was hard to hear the waiter. Also, it's a bit cramped.The food, though, was pretty decent. Nothing too special.We got a little bit of everything (pastas, pizza, salad, etc). The pastas weren't anythign special; Nothing I haven't tasted before. The pizza was definitely the best on the menu. Very authentic taste."
"I've been here a couple times and usually try to go when I visit Chicago. The restaurant has a very cool interior and lots of original italian equipment. This place has really good pizza, the sausage is my favorite. The meat and cheese selections are also very good, they make a lot of it in house.Our waitress was very knowledgeable and quick. Both times I have been here I have left satisfied."
"What what? Yelp says tapas, I think spanish tapas, but no, italian tapas! The idea is simple...pick a few small plates to share among the table. We did a penne vodka (cheesy), pork shank (so yum it literally fell off the bone with potatoes on the side), dates wrapped in prosciutto, tomato soup (more like sauce, eh), and tortellini (also cheesy... guess we went a little cheese crazy). Dessert was the best, fresh doughnuts with chocolate sauce which was amazing. Good service, a friendly waiter, near decor, a fun bathroom (glass wall and powder soap - you'll see)...all in all an A plus experience."
"I went on a Friday for dinner, and let me say I am glad I got there by 6pm! The place sure became crowded after we found a table in the downstairs bar area. Even though the place was packed, our waitress was very friendly and super attentive. We had never been to Quartino before and she helped us make some excellent food selections! I will certainly be adding this place to my list of favorites, taking friend from Chicago and visitors to the city!"
"One of my favorite spots in Chicago. Very cool atmosphere, makes me feel like I'm in Europe. The food and wine are always good, and the prices are reasonable. Service is consistently good too, even though it can get loud and packed. Recommend sitting in the bar area, it's really fun. Favorites include the pizzas, carpaccio (super fresh), eggplant caponata and the amazing beef Papardelle. Great place for sharing food with friends."
"Great Italian atmosphere for a couple or group. Enjoyed the red wine the most both times I've gone. Wish the ""small"" plates were a little bigger but they were very good."
"When I come to Chicago, I always visit this restaurant.  Such a great variety of great Italian food to try--you will never get bored!  And the prices are quite reasonable considering the quality (and for being in the city).I wont recommend anything because everything that I have had has been wonderful.  The service here is always great too and the staff really takes pride in what they serve and are knowledgeable.  Our waitress Molly was very friendly and interesting.  Too bad she was so busy as we really enjoyed talking with her."
"I had my 30th birthday party at Quartino on Saturday night.  I made my reservation for 29 guests about 1 1/2 months in advance.  The reservation was at 8:30, but I made sure my guests were there by 8, as I was warned that incomplete parties would not be seated.  Everyone enjoyed themselves drinking wine at the bar while we waited.  We were not seated until 9:00, but the manager was apologetic, and gave us a bunch of complimentary wine and meat platters.  It was very generous, and he was a nice guy.  Our table was pretty cramped, but it was Saturday night in a busy restaurant.  I guess I should have requested a room, but I didn't.  We still had a ton of fun, and the food was great.  The wine is really affordable, as is the food, so the bill was extremely reasonable."
Have been to Chicago 10 times and dozens of restaurants.  Absolutely my favorite. Environment was awesome. Food great and tremendous service. Thanks!
"Few places can beat the energy at Quartino, this place makes me happy the minute I set foot in here. Yes, it's insanely loud and you'll have to shout the entire night, but the patrons are always eclectic and fun to watch. My friend and I ordered a few plates to share, the Margherita pizza was not as good as it usually is, but the salmon, veal, and the eggplant parm were excellent. He was missing Italy and so was I, so we decided a bottle of Chianti would be in order to celebrate our good times overseas.Always make a reservation here, especially on Friday/Saturday. We were lucky to snag a last-minute Friday night reso here. Service was friendly and professional. Will be back a dozen more times I'm sure."
"All the amazing photos lead us to give Quartino a try especially the fresh thin crusted pizzas. Coming here on a light weekday got us a table right away unlike most yelpers here. The menu is pretty extensive with its range of anti-pastos, pizzas, and wines! After seeing the photos of the pizzas I choose a half roasted arugula-veggie/margherita. Its came out perfectly roasted, the fresh arugula was an added bonus already. We certainly always had fresh water on the table. Which leads to my only issue with the table turnover; if you leave your plate unattended for even a minute, the sub-server will try and swipe it from you no matter if there is food left or not. I found that mildly annoying as I just wanted to enjoy my meal without it being taken from me."
"While you always need a reservation unless you go at a weird time, and its always noisy, this is one of my favorite italian places in the city. I really love the atmosphere and my favorite is to come when it is warm out and when you can sit outside! Today I strolled in around 4:30 which was perfect because you didn't need a reservation but it was still getting pretty crowded. I had a piizza with artichoke, parmasean, eggplant, and portabella which was really good. The highlights were the caprese salad (i know good mozzarella after spending a ton of time in italy), brussel sprout salad, and the roasted brussel sprouts and cauliflour medly (cooked a lot with garlic, but just how i like it). Other dishes I like from past experiences include the octopus and polenta fries."
GREAT FOR GROUPS!Went for a friend's bday party and liked it a lot. The servers are friendly and efficient! Enjoyed the meal a lot!
"I had a wonderful dinner here with a coworker while visiting Chicago for a conference. She had been before and recommended it so we headed there on a Wednesday night after the conference ended to celebrate. I love a good tapas restaurant but had not been to an one that served Italian food. It was absolutely wonderful. A run down of what we ate:- Roasted beet salad - I don't even like beets and I thought this was delicious. Great flavor with the goat cheese added in. Nothing like cramming in antioxidants with some delish goat cheese. Yummers.- Broccoli rabe - this was okay - a bit bitter for my taste and not as much broccoli mixed in with the other elements of the dish.- Tomato soup - very very good. I love a good cup of 'mater soup, and this did not disappoint. - Chocolate fondue -  delicious dark chocolate served with strawberries. It was a bit strange, though, that they brought a huge container of chocolate and one plate of strawberries. But since we were already full, it wasn't an issue. Service was very good and we were seated immediately outside since it was more on the chilly side and people were waiting for inside tables. But with the heaters, it was a very pleasant dinner. Definitely a place to try if you haven't been!"
"The food: Tapas style servings. Overall, they have very good chefs at this place. You will not be disappointed with the Italian food here.Noise Level: Super loud. If you are looking for a quiet time, you may have to come during their off time, which I am not sure what it would be. If you come here on a Friday or Saturday night watch out for tables full of women (the cackling will be overwhelming).Decor: Very old school Italian. It feels like you walked into an Italian restaurant in The Godfather Part I"
"The fondue here is definitely the best I've ever had.  (And the $10 pricetag is totally fair, although I always wish that little cauldron was bigger!)And last night, during my visit, I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find gluten-free spaghetti among other items on a gluten-free menu so that I could get a variation of the tortellini that I always used to love there before I learned I had Celiac Disease.So kudos to you, Quartino on your fondue, alfredo sauce, gluten-free selections, and general atmosphere.My only complaint about Quartino is that all the servers there seem to be DICKS.  I know you work at a classy restaurant, but please don't treat me like a paycheck and just talk to me.  (Zach, Tony, and Raketa seem to be the exceptions to this rule.  I highly recommend sitting in their section.)"
"Quartino always becomes my fallback suggestion when I'm out of restaurant suggestions, especially when I have friends in from out-of-town who aren't especially adventurous eaters. The food is consistently solid--nothing I've had blows my mind, but it's always tasty. I'd recommend the pizzas over the pastas--the pasta sauces tend to be a bit heavy for my liking, but the pizza is crisped to perfection (try the Margherita or the Pugliese) and a welcome break from heart-attack that is Chicago deep dish. Of course no Italian meal is complete without some great red wine, and Quartino has a solid, reasonably priced selection.Though it's permanently crowded here, service is very attentive and food comes out quickly. The noise level on a weekend evening can be a bit unbearable at times, but it rather adds to the family-style ambiance of the place. And though I'm not gluten-intolerant, I give them points for having a gluten-free menu. Pretty tough to do for an Italian restaurant."
"BEST.DINING.EXPERIENCE.EVER!Let me set the mood. Saturday night in downtown...7 of us...no reservations. By some miracle, even though the place was packed, Matt (I'm assuming if not the owner, then at least a part of upper management) was able to find us a round table that we were seated at immediately. The place was packed wall to wall and everyone was laughing and having a great time.I had never been so I was intrigued by the fact that the orders come out whenever they're ready and that sharing was encouraged. Our server was Brian or Ryan (I must have said it 15 times each way trying to figure out which one, but never quite got it) Haha. He was a superstar! He encouraged us to start with a tasting, which he created for us. His recommendations were dead on. I'm going to try to remember everything we had...we had roasted peppers, roasted beet salad, eggplant salad, two different prosciuttos (one of them duck - both of them phenomenal), one soft cheese and one salty cheese (the soft, which I believe was the Fontina was to die for), and of course lots and lots of bread. We were in heaven and we were just getting started.From there, we ordered two wines, champagne, and then the most delicious meals that I could have ever imagined. I hope I don't leave anything out. There were veal meatball sliders (voted number one fave by one of the seven of us), gnocci (which was a hands-down favorite), fettuccini (another huge hit), lasagna (which was unlike any lasagna I have ever had before...the noodles completely melted in your mouth and each layer seemed to blend perfectly without leaving you too full), the pasta with the lamb ragu (garganelli con ragu d'agnello) - my personal favorite of the evening, and roasted baby octopus (which was just insanely delicious).Then, we moved onto dessert. Since I was in from out of town, we decided to go somewhere else (pops of champagne) - which proved to be the biggest disappointment ever. After such an incredible meal at Quartino, it was the most disappointing way to finish off the evening. Why am I writing this here, you ask? Well, because our night at Quartino hadn't quite ended yet. With a terrible dessert taste in our mouth from pops, we decided to see if we could strike gold one more time with Quartino. We waltz back in (all seven of us) and are promptly greeted again by Matt, who looks royally confused why we're all back. We explained to him what a let-down pops had been and how we couldn't end such a good night with their sad excuse for desserts. He sits us right back down at our table and, without any hesitation, orders us three different desserts...on the house. I was blown away. We had their Italian doughnuts (which were so fresh and exquisite), tiramisu, which normally doesn't appeal to me, but I couldn't get enough of this one, and one of their infamous gelato dishes, topped with bananas and deliciousness. Because of the gracious service, remarkable food, and obvious hospitality of Quartino, my first downtown experience in Chicago will be an ever-lasting memory. I will personally make trips to the city (from Phoenix, AZ) just to eat here!"
"Our family of five with three kids ages 7-9 ate an early dinner here tonight. Although the menu is sophisticated, the family style dining and lively atmosphere worked well for our family.   My younger daughter ate two pots of chicken soup and my other two kids did well with spaghetti and meatballs.  My older daughter actually loved the brussels sprouts salad.  I had lovely pork ravioli.  The desserts were our favorite, though--we had Italian doughnuts and carmelized bananas.  This would be a fun place to come with a group of friends and works well for a family with kids who will eat something other than chicken fingers :)"
"I've always wanted to try this place.  I found the service to be outstanding.  Our waiter was helpful and had a positive attitude.  Looking around the restaurant, this seemed to be the case with the entire staff; everyone seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs, which makes a big difference.The food is VERY simple, but well-executed.  You won't see any revolutionary items on the menu, no fusion and so on.  But they use high-quality ingredients, so the flavors of the food really speak for itself.  My boyfriend and I really enjoy sharing plates so we can try a little bit of everything and not feel like our belts are about to explode afterwards.  The shared plates were perfect for us, plus you can order quarter and half bottles of wine.  I was picking up the tab and it ended up being a very economical but special night out for us!It got rather crowded towards the end of our stay, and luckily I had noted in the reservations that we had theatre tickets.  We had no trouble at all getting there on time."
"Pros:  good pasta, great tapas. Risotto is fabulous (except asparagus). Great tortellini, caprese, tapas sampler.Cons: skip the asparagus risotto ... bland as water.  Its extremely loud.  You have to sit incredibly close to other patrons.  Slow service.  Confused identity ... tapas, pasta, pizza ... hmm?  Pretty sure our server was drunk or on drugs and he gave us birthday apps and dessert on the house but forgot to take it off our bill .... twice!!"
"The best thing this restaurant offers is the Vino. Mmmm.Came here on a Sunday starving with two friends of mine post Football Sunday Funday.  Got a table on the upstairs terrace which was nice, but very crowded at the small tables.The bread that was brought to our table was a little stale but we ate it anyways.  The highlight of my meal was the $2.25 veal meatball slider I ate... Holy shit this was delicious. It was on some kind of ciabatta bread I think and it was just oh so yummy.  That was appetizer one... We all sampled on of those delicious little minis. Then it was time to sample some salads.Quartino's spinach salad came with walnuts which sells me right away. Anything spinach/walnut related for a salad and I'm in.  The only thing that was not thrilling about this salad was that there was SO much dressing.  Not that it was bad tasting dressing, but it was just an excessive amount of dressing. Ask for it on the side.The little tomato salad that we all shared was good too. Just baby heirloom tomatoes. Nothing too extravagant. Would be really good with a balsamic reduction glaze. That would make the salad perfecto.Next course was some pasta.  We got penne alle vodka and spaghetti alle vongole (clams).  The spaghetti was SPICY so if you are not a fan of spice, beware. Luckily for me I'm a red pepper and sriracha junkie so nothing can surprise my capsacin receptors. Nope. The spaghetti with clams wasn't very flavorful minus the spicyness so that was unfortunate.The penne alle vodka was good but it was served to us with some undercooked noodles. Not so yummy. I'm all about that al dente noodle, but when it's well undercooked from al dente.. meh. Ruins the pasta.The service was pretty decent, but our server forgot our lemons for the pasta, to bring us bread, refill the drinks, etc etc.  Took us forever to get the wine too.I gave Quartino's three stars not because their food isn't great, but because I'm a food snob and after having lived in Europe for 12 years, I can't help it. Nice atmosphere, nice staff, but I've had better. Definitely worth trying, but I can't say I'm going to be returning there anytime soon."
Great find for affordable and laid back Italian in River North. Came here on a weeknight with a friend. The atmosphere was lively and we enjoyed a couple of tapas and the sangria. I would recommend this as a great option for Italian food before a night out- the smaller portions will leave you feeling satisfied but not put you in a pasta induced coma before you even make it to Hubbard Street. The place also had a much more energetic vibe than many of the stuffy traditional Italian restaurants you might find downtown.
"This is a pretty cute little spot. It's definitely great for groups, especially ones that are prepared for the noisiness. I've been here a couple time and spilt a pizza and had some great pastas. Nothing mind-blowing, but still good. I also really think its a nice blend of casual and a little fancy. Plus, the outdoor seating is great."
"Dined here recently- no wait for an outside table despite a sizable crowd. Our table was wobbly and the nearby train was fairly audible. Nevertheless, the experience was pleasant.The waitstaff was very helpful- our waiter made sure to explain the menu to us and was always nearby to see if anything else was needed. Everything we ordered arrived promptly. The drinks were decent but highly overpriced, even for the area. My friend and I split a spinach salad and a veggie pizza. The salad was nothing to write home about. It definitely could have used some more ingredients and it would have been nice if the walnuts were candied. The dressing was insufficient as well - I think it was just lemon juice with salt and pepper. But whatever. The pizza, on the other hand, was very good. All pizzas are 12"", I believe, well priced and perfect for splitting with a friend. The crust was wonderfully crispy and toppings fresh. Overall, I had a good time here, not quite a 4-star experience- 3.5 for sure.I would definitely come again and explore some of their other menu items."
Delicious tapas! I loved their eggplant Parmesan so delicious! We also had the funghi pizza which was also good portion size and tasty. Tons of items to share husband had the veal sliders and thought they were delicious. They have a ton of veggie options and their selection of woes are great.
"Came here with a friend for dinner on a busy Friday night. You feel like you are in someone's kitchen it's cute. Everything is really good we tried the pizza, pasta and it was delicious. Space is very cramped, you are very close to your neighbor. I didn't mind though. Will be back again, food was amazing."
"Only kids don't like to share. Ok, that's not an absolute: -We will share things we don't like. -We will gladly share things we really like, as long as it's with people we like. -We will pretend to gladly share things we like with those we don't really like (although we'll secretly want to stab them with our fork). Somehow, despite my feelings about sharing, I love tapas. My friend planned her birthday dinner here; dining with a group of 9 ensured that we were able to taste a nice cross-section of menu items. In addition to the copious amounts of bread and wine I consumed, I tried the following small plates: Quattro Formmagi - C+ (disappointing) Broccoli Rabe - B (nice zip to it) Linguine with Clams in White Sauce - B+ (excellent, but very messy to eat - ask for a spoon) Penne alla Vodka - B- (a little bland) Tortellini - A- Sea Scallops - B- Crisp Calamari - B+ Giardinera Romana - A Fontina val D'Aosta - A- Service was friendly, but a bit spotty; I think that was a function of having multiple servers. Sometimes dirty plates languished on the table, sometimes they were cleared with lightning speed. Sometimes dishes came out in short order, sometimes they were so delayed we wondered if they were forgotten. This is not a place you go if you're looking for a quiet, romantic dinner; it's loud and the vibe is energetic. The plates are mismatched, the tables are close, and chairs are a bit uncomfortable, but somehow they've created an atmosphere where you feel comfortable whether you're dining in jeans or a fancy dress. This is a great place for groups (provided you have a reservation). In fact, I think I would've been disappointed had I been with a smaller group; there were so many appealing items on the menu it would have made for some really hard choices."
"3.5 stars.  Ate indoors, it was VERY loud.  And pricey.  The best part was on Mondays they have full bottles of house wine for only $10.  Wow."
"Pace YOurSelf!!!!  That's my advice when going to Quartino.  Italian Tapas, you have to be kidding me, it's like all my dreams coming true at once.  So you're saying I can have a fresh rocatta and roasted tomato pizza, a slow braised beef short rib on the bone, seared diver scallops, lasagna and a caprese salad all in the same night?  Next you'll say I can order wine by the liter, half liter or quarter liter.  You're crazy, there is no such place.  What's that?  There is? This is serious people.  It's a little packed in there, but it's worth the lack of elbow room.   This will be my go to  place in Chicago every time I visit."
I absolutely love Quartino.  Fantastic food at a great price.  Most dishes are in smaller plates.  Order many and share.  Been there so many times and so far have not been disappointed.  Its much better to park valet than at the meter...just cheaper.  My all time favorites are the duck prosciutto pizza with arugula and grilled pork belly with granny smith apple (which unfortunately is no longer on the menu).  Pretty much everything is delicious on the menu.
"This place is definitely the hot spot in downtown Chicago. If you're thinking of walking in and getting a table on a weekend evening, you have better luck playing the lottery. There was a 45 min wait for patio sitting and 1.5 hr wait for indoor seating (this was at 7pm). We were fortunate enough to grab a table at the bar area (I'm playing the lottery).Started out with a bottle of Gotan Shiraz - Argentina priced at $18. This was an excellent selection. As far as food, this is a tapas bar (aka small portions). So here's what we got. Cheese - Fontina Val D'Aosta. This is served with raisin bread together with an apricot puree. Delicious. Appetizer - Veal Meatballs. Very, very tasty. Main course - Shrimp Risotto. Not the best risotto I've had, but it ranks in the top 5. Overall, the people were buzzing, packed place and the vibe was certainly entertaining. Definitely give it a try if you're in the area."
"I really enjoyed my visit to quartino. The food was excellent. I had the pasta with vodka sauce and pepperoni pizza..both delicious. The service was excellent as well. Our waiter was incredibly helpful, friendly and speedy, even with our group of 15. My only complaint was the waiting area. The restaurant was so crowded and the bar was packed so we were forced to stand in the ""waiting area"" where we were bumping knot people eating dinner and getting hit by the door. Other than that, it was an excellent dining experience. I will definitely be back!"
"So i'm not a pizza eater but the pizzas at this place are so authentically italian and incorporate great fresh toppings (such as Basil, Speck, fresh provolone) i was made a fan. My favorite is the Fumo Negli Occhi. The Steamed Clams are my fav appetizer."
"I would bring out of towners looking for decent Italian food to Quartino.  They get to see downtown as well as get a small plate tour of Italy.  I've been here a few times, once for a Yelp office hours, which was located on the second floor in the semi-private area.The last time I went, we were greeted by about 6 people standing at the host stand.  It seemed a little overwhelming and a bit inefficient.  Was there absolutely nothing else for them to do?  It also took about a minute before we were even acknowledged.  When they finally did, we were told that if we wanted to eat now (about 330PM on a Saturday afternoon) that we would have to be gone in an hour.  What a nice way to make me feel welcome!!  Foodwise, most offerings are small plates as well as pizzas.  I like the Romaine hearts.  I usually don't order salads since I feel like I can make better ones at home, but a friend wanted to try it, so I had a few bites.  The dressing was lemony fresh and delicious.  It's served as whole Romaine leaves tossed lightly and topped with shaved parm.  When I met the chef at Localicious, I tried to get the recipe, but he wasn't sharing.  Basically, he said that everything comes from high quality ingredients from Italy.  I'll have to keep experimenting to get it down.Go with a large group and order several small plates for a fun night downtown.  Bonus - house wine is cheap!"
I don't really see the hype but the duck something was pretty good. Others were pretty small portions for the price. Was an interesting experience but in terms of food I don't think we were really satisfied. We ended up needing to go to another place after to get our cravings filled.
"I love this place (and I'm picky), I go here probably at least 2-3 times a month.Best best is the $15 bottle of Rosso wine and any of their Pizza selections.My favorite is the White Pizza with chicken and zuchinni.For appetizers, go with the 1/2 portion of the Fried Calamari and the Farmhouse Chicken.  Veal meetball sliders are good, but unfortunately I'm on the low carb diet."
"This place is so cute! A great place to have a date. My husband and I started with duck prosciutto and one of the cheeses (can't remember the name, but it was quite salty) paired with the fennel salad and the cucumbers. Loved it. Next, we had the mushroom risotto (yummy!!) and the house made noodles with the beef sauce (delicious!!). Dessert was the off menu tiramisu. I highly enjoyed this meal and would definitely return. We also shared a 1/4 carafe of wine-- prices are fantastic here and I really enjoyed my wine! Service was excellent, too."
"I didn't love everything I had at Quartino, but the things I did love, I REALLY loved. Plus the service is great and the ambiance is perfect for a big family meal. The menu is set up tapas-style so that you order a bunch of little things to share. I liked this as it allowed me to indulge in my favorite eating habit, i.e., trying a bit of everyone's dishes. We tried a wide range of the menu, from pizzas to pasta to seafood, so there was something for everyone. The standouts for me were the mushroom risotto, the polenta fries, and the penne in vodka sauce. The risotto was just so creamy and delicious, we had to order a second helping. And I liked that it was earthy without suffering from the lack of flavor that sometimes plagues this dish at other restaurants. The polenta fries were a wildcard. I was expecting them to be pretty bland but they were really well done. Crispy on the outside and spongy on the inside, with a tomato-based dipping sauce that isn't the traditional marinara. The penne in vodka sauce wasn't overly unique or unusual, just really well done and tasty. I also tried the pesto gnocchi, which I was expecting to love. In truth, it wasn't bad, just not as good as the others. The pasta was pillowy and light, but the sauce could have used some oomph. Maybe more basil in the pesto? Or parm? More cheese and butter never hurt...except, you know, heart- and health-wise. The pizza was the only disappointing part of the meal. I tried the margherita and it was just off. The crust wasn't crispy, the cheese and sauce were bland, and it lacked that overall salty/tanginess that I love so much. Kind of a bummer. But honestly it would have been hard to surpass the marghy I had at Flo & Santos the night before. The salmon, on the other hand, was a saltsplosion, in a good way (if you're a saltaholic like me). The stewed tomatoes were a nice addition to the fish. I had only a bite of the lemoncello dessert thing, and it was uh-mazing. Our server took great care of us and didn't cop a 'tude when we kept throwing additional requests at her. She kept our waters and sodas refilled, brought us extra wine glasses right away, and made sure we had utensils and napkins for each round of food (the bussers had a habit of snatching them away). Valet parking is $11, which is cheaper than the nearby ramps and ideal when taking the train just won't work."
awesome!
Ok second day back for lunch.. Asked for cream added to blood orange Italian soda- no problem..I ordered three it was so bangin.. Ordered romaine salad (needed salt & pepper) was very light & refreshing- tried pizza-crust under was crunchy top was gooey w homemade mozzarella OMG so good-tried meat sauce & pasta was so simple meaty & homemade - tried clams they gave a huge portion for next to nothing- kitchen was beautiful made me want to jump in and work the line- staff in front of the house @ service desk was TOP NOTCH (actual people that like their jobs!!) loved the bar setting to watch a game & much/drink if we had time would have been great. Only minor let down was nutella desert on grilled bread- I guess it was more crunchy bread & less gooey/decadent than I envisioned. Overall a must to try - if you hate crowds & high noise level hit this spot before 430pmTo relax and people watch on patio (weather permitting) if your down for wall to wall madness & are cool w a lively vibe of chatter & fun get reservations around 8 & squeeze in to the pulse of this great find.
"This place is good for large groups, but when I came in a group of four, I wish that we had had more space at our small table.  The service is fast (the food comes to you when it's made to order).Eggplant parmesan is delicious.Pizza is light, airy, but still flavorful.Decor is trendy and stylish in an old-fashioned way.  I don't know why they need a bathroom attendant though; it seems unnecessary..."
"Quartino's is like stepping into a loud Italian house for dinner! Such a lively, energetic atmosphere with GREAT service! Our waiter was pleasant, knowledgeable, and accommodating who DID NOT rush us whatsoever despite how bustling the restaurant was!! WooHoo!! When is the last time that didn't happen to you??!!?Love, love, love the small plates for sharing.......it allows me to sample quite a bit of the menu without feeling like a glutton....WIN WIN! Garganelli con Ragu D'Agnello(pasta with lamb ragu), Roasted Baby Octopus, and the White Bean & Garlic Spread are all must trys. The pasta has a deep, rich flavor without being overly filling and the octopus is simply delicious!The cappuccino was excellent, which it had better be at an Italian joint and the profiteroles we ordered for dessert were YUMMO as well!This spot is loud but not too loud, it is a great place to go with friends but not the best place for an intimate date."
"This is a super fun Italian ""tapas"" place that's definitely worth your time. It's got a cool, vibrant atmosphere with tons of activity going on around you. And yet it's not a difficult place to have a conversation by any means.Going here with 3+ people is definitely preferred, as almost everything is meant to be shared and you'll get more variety with lots of friends ... you do have friends don't you? Oh ... my bad.Anywho, the pizza is thin crust and really tasty. I prefer the margherita myself, but the others are really great as well.The pasta is all made in house, so you're getting some great quality. My favorite is the orecchiette. The sauce is great and it has the perfect pasta texture.The veggies are quite good as well and cuts some of the heaviness out of the meal. I loves me the spinach personally, but then again I have a penchant for Popeye that borders on the erotic.Another one I enjoyed a lot was the baby octopus. Some of my friends felt it was a little fishy, but it was cooked VERY well, tender and not chewy. That's pretty hard to find for octopus.Give it a go. You won't be disappointed."
"This place was good enough for me start a yelp account. Yup, it's that good.You should try get a reservation ahead of time b/c this place is jam packed for good reason. My boyfriend and I came here for our 2 year anniversary at 9pm since the slots were all taken. I heard about this palce and wanted to try it since the reviews were so good and they were right. The service was great, and the waiter was super charismatic and attentive. I looove tapas. Highly recommend the prosciutto and cheeses! It comes with mini sides and jams and honey to eat with. We got a free pizza since the chef made a mistake and the waiter asked if he wanted it for free. (yes thank you very much!) It was fresh and tasty."
"Another great night at Quartino. We've only been once before, about a year ago, but it instantly became one of my bf's fave restaurants. This time we had a 6:30 reservation but showed up at 6 -- no problem, got a great seat with a view of the entire dining room, and it was less noisy than if we had come later.Started with the salumeria plate again, although we've come to realize we're not in love with all the veggie accompaniments, so next time we're just going to order a couple cheeses (the parmesan is a MUST) and a couple meats. Cost will be comparable, and we won't feel bad about not eating the pickled peppers, etc.Then we got half-size servings (which they can do for most of the pasta dishes) of the rigatoni and the bolognese. The bolognese was okay, but the rigatoni was like HEAVEN. Even my boyfriend, who doesn't usually like creamy white sauces (alfredo, etc.), said it was the best! Highly recommend.So Quartino's is still a fave of ours, and we can't wait to come back and try a few more things next time. The price is right, the food is great, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting."
"The most quaint street side restaurant!Awesome waiters and waitresses!Delicious italian food :)I did not know that they have a gluten free menu, but from reading other reviews it looks like they do! As a person with Celiacs disease that is SUPER important!I got the summer vegetable salad - crisp and fresh with extra beets!Also the prosciutto de parma with sweet and sour pickles - sweet and salty yummy-ness right there!My friend ordered the tomatoe heirloom salads which was BOMB. I think it is the best I've had, if I go back to Chicago I would make it a point to go back to this restaurant.Ambience is also perfect for that European cafe vibe, but of course you're still in the Windy City! LOL"
"I was hoping for a nice meal with my boyfriend but the food and the noise level really ruined the experience.  Everything we ordered was underseasoned, completely bland.  The calamari tasted fishy and lacked salt, the funghi pizza had almost no flavor and the dates wrapped in proscuito were a mushy and bland.  To top off the experience the noise level was so loud that we had to yell to hear each other.Extremely disapointing."
This was the second time I have been to Quartino.  The service wasn't as great as I had hoped.  The server brought out wine to a couple people at the table but could not recall which wine went with who so she just sat them down and told them to taste test to figure it out.  The food was good but not an experience to rave about.
Really delicious!  Affordable!  I had a small sangria (yum!!!) and a small pizza.   I went with a group of friends.  We had a reservation and we had no trouble with securing our table.I would definitely go back!
"Great place to share some small plates.  The pizza is great, love the shrimp risotto!  Beat salad is awesome too!  Check it out."
"After landing from a horrendous trip to Chicago, Cailyn and I checked into our hotel, yelped for pizza and within minutes we were on our way in search for food. We originally stopped at the famous Giordano's but, at 11:30pm they turned us away telling us their dining room was closed. LAME. Back to my yelp app we picked Quartino which was only a few blocks away. A euro style Italian tapas bar, Cailyn and I opted to sit in the bar area for some more life and to wake us up. We opted for the Grilled Zucchini pizza and the Vegetarian Pizza with mixed veggies like asparagus, cauliflower and arugula. This was the best thin crust pizza I've ever had. I mean EVER. The flavor was so bold and every taste went together seamlessly. The sauce, bold and rustic the cheese oh so creamy it was almost like a sauce. Outdoor seating. Both dining room and bar area for eating as well. Friendly and helpful staff. In fact, so far everyone in Chicago is friendly. So unlike New York. Highly recommended. A must try."
"4 stars with over 2000 reviews is pretty impressive - but only if the food lives up to the hype. Super loud and the street seating is always jammed (which I don't mind because I prefer to eat inside). Service was crummy, portions are super tiny. For the $26 bucks I spent, I could have eaten at Chili's across the street and had better food/service - TWICE. The balsamic vinegar they have at the table is probably the best I've ever tasted and it seems that the fruit flies are aware of this fact. I went through 3 plates as I sat there because the little a-holes kept flying into my vinegar! That old saying... yea, complete BS. Minestrone soup was bland. Salt grinder took care of that but my pepper grinder was empty. With how attentive my waiter was (he seemed to not really care much about serving and kinda looked like he was pissed off the whole time I was there), I think I would have received a new grinder sometime today instead of last night while I was there. I was really craving risotto so I got the sausage risotto... bland and crummy, kinda runny with this weird skin on top of it when i first mixed it around, served on something about the size of an appetizer plate for a toddler. Upon further investigation, I found that this place is considered a ""small plate"" restaurant and it certainly lives up to that. Didn't even bother with dessert - paid, left, went to 711 for some snacks afterwards... I've been spoiled on the risotto over at Pinstripes in south barrington, so anything I try elsewhere has a lot to live up to."
"I went here on their 7th anniversary, so the pastas, pizzas, and house wine bottles were $7. That's a few dollars cheaper than their regular menu, so it was a great deal!The food was great! A few things we ordered were the funghi pizza (really good!), linguine with clams (lots of clams, but a the taste was a bit bland), cavatelli (best pasta dish that night), pappardelle al sugo di manzo (pretty good, lots of meat), gnocchi (also really good), penne alla vodka (the sauce was a little light, but it tasted good), rigatoni (did not like this one... it was bland and way too creamy). Overall, the food was great!! For $7, it was totally worth it.Our server was awesome! One of the best servers that I have encountered so far. He provided recommendations and was honest about his opinions on the dishes. We took his suggestions and were not disappointed in the food. Since we were all sharing, he brought the dishes out a couple at a time so that we always had a few on our table and were eating each while it was hot.It's a great place to go with friends and I would return to try the other stuff on the menu."
"I am giving them a star because the food was good, but everything else was terrible.  We came here for a random dinner around 5p on a Sunday and initially were greeted quickly and seated.  After being seated we didn't see a waiter for 15 minutes! When he finally came to introduce himself and get our drinks we decided to just order everything in case he didn't come back for another 15 minutes. ---Keep in mind they were not busy by any means except for one large group of 10 and a few other tables-- We kept running out of water and because we could not get the attention of our initial server we kept having to stop other servers for water and additional orders.  They forgot 2 of our additional orders and when we got a hold of a server to tell them our server finally came over and told us it would be a few more minutes, rather than just apologizing for the mistake.  I wish I could say the food was so good that I would be willing to give them another chance but I cant."
"We love this place. It's noisy. Make a reservation. We also ordered a ridiculous amount of food but once again, it's tapas. Order 2-3 a person.LOCATIONsemi off the loop. It's not too far, make the journey. River North, next to the pizza places.. due, uno.. etc.AMBIENCEhomey, crowded, LOUD. SO SO LOUD. No beer on top, no room on table for ANYTHING including your food. Grab a drink, the bartenders are nice. FOODCaprese: GREAT start to the meal. The buffalo Mozz was delicious and creamy but not overwhelming. Veal Meatballs Napoli: SO DELICIOUS. Jonny just looked at me with dreamy eyes and said ""so good..."" sweet, kind of briny but super delicious. melt in your mouth. seriously. Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo: the homemade pasta is really the icing on the cake. The braised beef tomato sauce was to die for. seriously. also not a tapa-sized dish. Tuscan Sausage Risotto: so so cheesy. We wouldn't get it again if we went back. Braised Pork Shank: GET THE PORK SHANK. It was melt in your mouth, falling off the bone... jeez.... really can't say enough about it."
"Great dinner and experience at Quartino.  Very good menu, we tried a variety of dishes and all were done really well.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and helped us with questions."
"Quartino is a great place to go with a group of girlfriends - many a bachelorette party is held at this Italian small plates restaurant. The menu, which features everything from charcuterie plates to pastas to roast chicken, really does offer something for everyone. And because sharing is the idea here, Quartino is perfect for groups.The menu doesn't change much over the course of a year - you'll find staples like calamari, risotto and pizza offered year-round. The restaurant has a decent wine list and some fairly nice cocktails, including a perfectly lovely Bellini. Best of all, the prices at Quartino are reasonable.That being said, Quartino is a large restaurant with two levels so it can get quite loud. Again, great if you're celebrating with a group, but not the place you'd take a first date or a business associate. And unless you fancy waiting around for an hour or more, you need a reservation almost any night of the week (you can usually book same-day on Open Table). Of course, if you don't have a reservation, tables at the bar are first-come, first-serve (people do tend to hover if they think you're close to leaving).Quartino not going to blow you away with its culinary offerings, but it's fun and ideal when you're trying to accommodate a lot of different taste buds."
"I want to give this place 5 stars, but I feel it's a little too impersonal and a little too clunky in its execution to do so.  But, it's a great place if you like hearty, well prepared and seasoned food.My girlfriend and I came here for dinner after a long walk all over Chicago's near north side and Magnificent Mile.  We had reservations and were seated immediately by the kitchen.  Usually not my favorite seat in the house, but it was amazing to watch the cooks and chef produce that much food that fast!  It also meant fast service for us.  This place has a ""share small plates"" philosophy, and it works out well for two.We ordered a number of things: - Mixed olive appetizer- Polenta fries- Pappardelle with braised beef tomato sauce- Scallops- Caprese salad- Roero Arneis white wineI loved everything above, but here are my (picayune) qualms-- The pappardelle was sloppily tossed onto a plate, we only had 3 scallops for $15, and the Caprese salad was lacking in freshness. Outside of that, the flavors were delectable and most items were well priced.  We were told that we could get halves of desserts if we wanted, so we opted to try a couple. Unfortunately, we couldn't get halves of the two we wanted so they comped one for us.  The torta ciccolata (chocolate cake) and the coppa al banana were both amazingly good.  I recommend them.  One last shout out to our server, Ty.  He was attentive, gave great advice, and kept his cool (along with his Rollie Fingers handlebar mustache).  They should promote him or give him a bonus."
Going off the reviews on yelp - this was deceiving. I don't know how this place is high rated?!? I tried the veal meatballs and it's was OK. Definitely nothing special. It's pretty much a bar that serves Italian food. Wine list wasn't impressive either. JUST OK. No reason to go back
"I was just recently introduced to this place and I la-la-la-LOVE it!My one issue with this place is that when we called to make reservations they told us they did not take reservations between time A and time B. They told us to c'mon in anyways and we'd probably have about a 30min wait.  We get there and they tell us it's a 3hr wait.  Whaaaaat?  They then explained that what they meant is that they were booked.  Well thats completely differently then what we were told.  We ended up snagging 2 seats at the bar and settled for that.  We got a couple small plates and we also got a platter of meats, olives & cheeses.  I wish I could remember every single thing I ate there but I can't.  I will tell you everything was pretty excellent.  The duck prosciutto was AMAZING.  It just melts right in your mouth.  As for the cheese, my fave was the parmigiano reggiano.  Amazing.  Also loved the dates wrapped in pancetta.  Seriously- this place ruined my diet and I couldn't be more thankful! The one thing I wasn't a fan of was the bone marrow.  I've never had it, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but my friend I was with said that he has had better and that the flavors on the bread it was served with took away from the marrow.  Meh.  No big deal there.  I definitely want to go back to this place, but I'd love a table this time!"
"No complaints! In fact it was my favorite meal in Chicago. I loved the comforting atmosphere, which is immediately noticeable as soon as you walk in. The bread they bring to the table is warm and fresh. I was obsessed with the actual Parmesan cheese they leave on the table, none of that fake powdery stuff other restaurants give you. The waiter was well versed in the endless wine list, able to make spot on recommendations. My friend an I decided to each order a pasta and split an eggplant Parmesan. I ended up with the linguine and clams in white sauce, which was perfect. It had the right combination of flavors and clams. I wish the eggplant Parmesan had a little more eggplant and a little less cheese, but it was still delicious. For dessert I went with the tiramisu, sweet and savory. My favorite thing to do is enjoy a good meal with friends and wine, Quartino is the perfect place for just that."
"Fantastic pizza! I came here with the bf last weekend for some lunch. We got the prosciutto d'anitra (translation: duck prosciutto)...and it was awesome! There were lots of arugula on top of the pizza, it almost looked like a pizza salad. I was not impressed with the caprese, however. It was nothing special. Head over next door to Osteria Via Stato for the best caprese ever! For drinks, I highly recommend quartino's bellini."
"This place is always a winner.  Good for groups or couples, lots of variety on the menu and everything I've tried has been delicious.  Service is always excellent."
Went here for drinks and pizza. We had the Campania which was excellent. Perfectly cooked crust and great flavors. The atmosphere of this place is perfect for a date night.
"I'm here at a work conference with 200+ financial planners and First Trust tales us to this fantastic Italian restaurant! It's hard to cook for 200 and keep the quality up but Quartinos did it! Buffet style Italian food, I'm just bummed I got full before dessert! The cheese is made fresh daily! Try the pizza, the pasta and the polenta fries! Yummy!!!!!"
"Surprisingly our second experience was much better.  We made a reservation on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately.  Our server was much better than the last one and was very attentive.  The food was certainly much better and cooked well.  I really enjoyed the veggie pizza (I excluded the cheese) and thought the sauce and vegetables were well-flavored.  The garlic white bean dip was also pretty good, and our side of olives was average.  We'll be back."
"Nothing from the menu really stood out for me at Quartino.  I'm writing this review as placeholder, because I went with a few friends and we were more focused on the surrounding ""talent"" and the wine in our glasses, in that order.While I'd rate Quartino as a winner in the talent dimension, it's not a club, so I need to go back again and focus more on the restaurant itself in order to truly grant them my professional reviewing opinion."
"I can't believe I haven't yet written a review for Quartino. I've been here a million times and love it!Quartino, you hold a special place in my heart as our last dinner as a childless-couple was with you (I went into labour with our daughter the same night).Tips:The pizza is great.You can get 1/2 portions of most things. Do it.The risotto is amazing.Duck prosciutto is pretty gross. The real prosciutto is awesome.The patio is great in the summer. It gets busy on weekends. Come expecting some noise.They're great for parties, and very accommodating with children.There's an off-menu tiramisu. Which inspired me to start making tiramisu. And I think mine's better (bias) but theirs is pretty great too.Also, if you're driving, you might as well use valet. It's like $11, whereas if you park it's $5 per hour. If you can find a spot. We keep forgetting this fact.Once, they accidentally used cinnamon instead of cocoa powder on our tiramisu. It was pretty hilarious in hindsight. The management was great to us.They used to recognize us... But not anymore :( I guess we just don't go as often now that we've got a baby to care for.A few things... I'd love if they switched up the menu once in a while, or offered a special. I think we've tried everything and have gotten a bit bored. Also, the summer service/food/staff is worse than in the winter. Not sure why, but after 2 years of coming here, it's definitely something I've noticed."
"We came here for a large birthday celebration on Saturday night (9 people).  We picked Quartinos because of its reasonable price, the restaurant works for big parties, and I like the idea that you don't just ""go in and go out"".  *Be sure to have a reservation - even if you are a smaller group.*First, the bad/annoying item: my boyfriend got a call confirming the reservation and the girl was a bit  rude demanding that we all be there on time to get seated and ""if the number changes, you must call prior to arrival.""  I know why they call, the tone/delivery just really annoyed me (-.5 star). With a large group, we had multiple servers.  Compared to being there with a smaller group, the service was a bit sporadic.  Sometimes they were around all the time and sometimes no one in sight.  Yet, they were all still friendly and helpful.With a larger group you can try a lot more items.  You can also ""share"" more wine, but we've never had a problem with a smaller group killing the big liter.  I really liked the the Tortellini, Veal Skirt Steak, Sea Scallops, Fontina Cheese, Calamari.  I was even brave and tried the linguine with clams (usually don't like clams) and it was better than I was expecting. In terms of the pizza, we tried the Four Cheese which was okay, but I really prefer the Margherita.  The Penne Vodka and the Farmhouse Chicken were average - I'd probably try something else the next time.  Every time I come here, they are ""sold out"" of the Lasagna - that wants me to try it even more!   All in all, we punished LOTS of food and drinks with it being roughly $50/person (incl. a good tip).  4.5 stars for this time. Every time I come here I always think that I need to come more often."
I went for lunch this weekend and had a great time.  The food came out quickly and I thought it was great for the price.  I loved my pizza.  I can definitely see myself adding this place into the post-work rotation for food and drinks.
"My love affair with Quartino continues. Took my parents here, who were visiting and everything was just great. The food is still as delicious... the best thing about them is they are consistently good. We ordered the bianca pizza, broccoli rabe, seared scallops, a salad and asparagus risotto. All the dishes were delicious, fresh and flavorful. But the star of the show was the dessert. We ordered the gelato sundae and also the hot chocolate cake with vanilla gelato on top. They were both winners."
"We went to quartinos with a party of 16 for a bachelorette party. This is an awesome place for big groups because it is great food at a very reasonable price with a fun atmosphere and excellent service. The food here is Italian style tapas and will please anyone from the pickiest of eaters to food snobs. They were super accommodating letting us make a big reservation and changing it so many times as we obtained a final count. Our waiter Aldo was very kind, fun, friendly, on top of it and gave is excellent recommendations on what to order. The tortellini and cheese pizza are my favorites. Overall a wonderful experience- would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great restaurant for big groups. The only downside I could think of is that it's a bit loud- but that's hard to avoid in any popular restaurant on a weekend night."
"I love Quartino for its lively atmosphere, tasty food, good service, fair prices, and wine.  I have dined here multiple times, and I am always impressed with how great this place is for groups.  Our server gave us a paper menu and a pen.  We passed it around the table and each person circled 1 or 2 items.  The food is served tapas style and comes out as it is ready.  You can purchase liters of the house wine and it is very fairly priced.  It is a popular restaurant so a reservation is very necessary for the weekend.I hosted a surprise engagement party for my best friend at Quartino.  They let us sit down even though our whole party wasn't present.  They played along with our distraction and telling us our table was ""ready.""  The staff was so helpful and accommodating.  Next time you want to celebrate with a big group, Quartino will make an excellent venue."
"The food here was delicious, there's no denying that, but our service and the atmosphere was lacking.I went with two friends and enjoyed their company, but our experience was tainted with a poor seat right from the beginning. Our table was in the walkway...or shall I say ""run"" way in which the servers and other diners constantly breezed through, never failing to give me a good bump. Then, our server took our order, incomplete, and disappeared while aware that we wanted to order more, we just wanted to put in the other part of our order later...but not THAT later. It took forever to get the bill and we were ultimately disappointed."
"I can't say enough about the service at Quartino.  As an Italian dude from New York, I've been to a lot of Italian places and have never encountered such a friendly, considerate, competent wait-staff and front desk.  We came here on a Friday night, so it was super packed.  However, Peter (the host for the evening) did everything he could to make sure our party of seven (awkward number for dinner) was seated quickly.  Many thanks to Peter for making our experience a good one.The food and drink:  Both very, very good.  Everything we ordered was fresh and tasty.  I recommend the bacon wrapped dates, calamari,  and pizza (really good).  House wine was solid and super cheap (I think I paid 11 bucks for a half carafe).  Finally, the format of dinner was very interesting.  Family style tapas.  Why hasn't anyone thought of that before?  Different, but I got used to it.  My advice is order 3 or 4 dishes to start, then just start ordering on the fly."
"3.5 starsGreat place for groups with an awesome location (sort of one of the only downtown restaurants with good affordable food thus extra half star). The restaurant is family style, so order a bunch to share and chow down!Highly recommend the pizza with the housemade duck prosciutto and arugula! Super fresh and perfect crust. Other favorites include the antipasti platter (NOM! recommend the fontina cheese) and calamari. LIked the paparadelle too (but I love all paparadelle.. swoon). The rest of the pasta dishes we tried including the risotto and vodka pasta were less than memorable-- sorta of lackluster ordinary.Loud boisterous atmosphere with close tables and flowing vino. Somehow always busy too."
"We got here at 6 and the wait was 4 hours for a table on a (long weekend) Saturday night, so we found a seat right away at the bar instead.  We had white Sangria (with cubes of apple and orange in our glasses), spinach and pear salad, mushroom risotto, and octopus.  The portions were small, but everything was delicious and very reasonably priced.  Explains the long wait.  We'll be making a reservation the next time we come."
"I really enjoyed the food and decor at this place.  I felt the menu and wine list to be very pleasing to various taste.  We shared a few dishes.  The fungi pizza was ok, crust a little soggy.  The sea scallops were great.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection.  They melted in  my mouth.  The asparagus risotto was very tasty.  It was cooked just right.  This is the best risotto I have ever had.  The dandelion salad was different, I expected as much.  We wanted to try some greens that we never had before.We shared the donuts and they were yummy.Very good service."
"This is an awesome place. Nice ambiance, laid back, great menu choices, and great food. I LOVED my Cavatelli, I would highly recommend this entree. Garlic white bean dip was good, as was the caprese (but where was the balsamic?? you almost needed a microscope to see or taste it). The wine selection was great, though the lack of wine glasses was odd I kind of liked their chosen glassware. Fun place to go and share different Italian fare. I will definitely come back to Quartino when in Chicago!"
"Seriously people, this place ain't all that! The food is MARGINAL. And who goes to an Italian restaurant to eat tapas???? For realz, there are WAY better places to eat Italian in Chicago... oh like across the street at Osteria Via Stato!! We at least ordered 5 small dishes, all needed more spice and pazazz. I will say they have a nice wine list. I had the Dolchetto -- a fabulous light red Italian wine that is on the sweeter side. The dessert was blah too. This whole place is BLAH but their wine list. A+++ to that."
"Whenever traveling, I find it somewhat difficult settling on a restaurant for dinner. After scouring yelp for restaurant advice my friends and I settled on Quartino because when we passed by the place during the lunch rush the dishes looked beyond fabulous. We ordered the farmhouse chicken, beef tips, fettuccini alfredo, steamed clams and a pizza bianco. And of course a bottle of wine. A warning when you look at the prices that they seem too good to be true. Do not expect entree sized portions. Albeit these dishes are meant for sharing it is the ordering in numbers that gets you a taste of the palate that Quartino has to offer. I find that I usually prefer it that  way because then I get a taste of everything.Everything we ordered was ridiculously good. The chicken was soft and succulent, the beef had deep notes of red wine, and the clams were so good we ordered Them again when we were stuffed! Every dish had its own unique sauce. Which was just absolutely delicious and flavorful. The alfredo was good but it can also be gotten everywhere. I would pass on the bianco only because it was pretty bland in terms of topping. If you get a pizza get one with toppings and sauce. I used the pizza to dip into the sauces of the chicken, beef and clams. Those clams! My mouth is watering thinking of them now a month or so later. The waiter was attentive and assisted us with our wine selection and the volume in which we ordered in. He wasn't trying to make a sale, he was very genuine. Definitely a great place to check out, we went around 10 pm on a Friday night and the crowd level was perfect. Just enough to blend in but not too much that the service suffers. The ambiance was great, not too light or dark and a moderate nose level.With a bottle of wine and 6 plates the bill came to $90 for 3 people with tip. Not too shabby for the great dining experience we shared."
"Quartino was great! The $25 weekday lunch special for 2 people was fantastic! It's a great deal for to get 3 courses (appetizer, choice of a pasta or risotto, and a main entree). We had the Angus Steak Carpeccio, Ravioli, and Braised Pork Shank.  The Angus Steak Carpeccio was refreshing with shaved celery and cheese. Ravioli was rich and flavorful. The Braised Pork Shank was cooked very well, the meat was tender, juicy, and falling off the bone. Yum!Everything was great! Service was also fast and friendly. What a great find in Chicago!"
"I really love Quartino's.  Quite possibly my favorite small plate restaurant I've ever eaten at.  We had a reservation and were quickly seated.  The restaurant is packed and loud.  This really concerned me at first but I was very surprised at how efficiently the staff operated.  From water, to wine, to ordering, everything was seamless.  My favorite items from the evening were:1.  Roasted Beet Salad2.  Linguini with Clams3.  Beef FiletsDefinitely order wine here.  I thought the selection was excellent and the prices were affordable.  You can order by the bottle, 1/4 liter, 1/2 liter, or full liter.  You can't beat that!  I'll definitely be eating here again the next time I'm in Chicago.  Don't be scared when you walk by or peek in by the crowds and volume -- the food and service will win you over."
"2 people = 2 tapas = more than enough food, so that was a bummer because I would have had smaller portions to try more.The wait staff will tell you that their meatballs are to die for, but honestly they were only okay.If you go here, you MUST get the gnocchi.  Best dish by far."
"Love this restaurant! My sister first brought me here about a year ago, and I can't stop going back.I'm averse to big crowds and waiting, so I say get there early.  I love showing up around 4:30 on a Saturday, ordering a bottle of Malbec and enjoying a wonderful early meal as the theater crowd and tourists filter in for the evening.  Get the house pasta, and I'm sure I'm the zillionth person to mention they have a house tiramisu that's not on the menu."
"The service and atmosphere are awesome at Quartino. I have to say, I was expecting spectacular food dishes because of the many reviews, but we only had a few that held up to expectations. I have to say, this reaffirms by belief that Chicago is the best food city in the country. As many tourists visit Quartino (and they should), I believe the ratings are skewed a bit high because the reviewers aren't food snobs (like us Chicaogans).Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. We had the dates and caprese salad, which were great. Ordered a pizza which was just ok, we had the one with meatballs, peppers, and onions, it just didn't have a lot of flavor besides the spice. I had high expectations for the gnocchi, but it truly just had more of a garlic flavor than pesto. The highlight of the meal was the shrimp risotto. This was awesome and we could have easily eaten another plate. The tomatoes and seasonings in general on the skirt steak were great, but the meat wasn't really cooked like skirt steak should be. Kind of difficult to cut. However, in a large kitchen with small plates, we should have known better than to order an item like that. We had the chocolate cake for dessert which was devastatingly good. I was tempted to get the doughnuts, but our server let us know the chocolate cake was the way to go. And it was, warm with vanilla gelato on top. Yummm. All in all, a very solid dinner place!"
"Saturday night was packed, so we came back on Sunday. Still packed, but no wait at 7:00 PM. This place is hoping with a good vibe. The host and waitresses and waiters will all very friendly. We had two come over to our table to explain our selection of food. Really good pizza and tapas. Lots of tables and a very European atmosphere. I think any food selection would be great and quite an extensive wine list as well."
"A friend sent me toward Quartino with a warning about the noise level - and an assurance that the remarkably delicious food and fun decor was worth it.  I made an 8:30 reservation thinking we might miss some of the worst dinner traffic, but it was still hopping.  As former employees in the service industry, my husband and I understood the hordes of service folk getting their early outs stopping by for a bite and a drink, and we really enjoyed the frenetic vibe.  The food was as delicious as advertised.  We each had and shared three plates - among them vegetarian caponata, pickled veggies, octopus, scallops, eggplant parm, and white beans and escarole.  The bread was never-ending and wonderful and came out with our drinks - wine is served in liter and fraction-of-liter portions - hence the 'quartino' of their name.  The white sangria is delicious and the lambrusco deliciously fruity without being sweet - both were ideal on such a warm night.  Our server was attentive but not cloying, and kept us stocked in water, wine, and bread as the night went on.  He brought me samples of some of the liqueurs when I couldn't made up my mind, and we chatted about working in service and the things my husband and I miss about those days - and especially the busy nights like the one we came in on.The only drawback, as others have mentioned, was the noise.  And even that wasn't so bad as to be uncomfortable.  We still were able to chat about the Sophia Loren films on the screens above us and ooh and ahh over our selections.  The service, ambiance, and food all reminded us of some of our favorite places in Europe - though we've not been to Italy, we thought of beer gardens that we frequented in Berlin and Vienna.  All in all, this is a restaurant we'll make a point of returning to.  It's one I recommend without reservation for its food and fun atmosphere."
"Went here Saturday night with girlfriends, made a reservation but wasn't sat until 30 minutes after stated reservation time which was kind of a bummer and the hostess girls were less than accommodating and truthful about ""your table's almost ready"" and ""just a few minutes."" Was given free bottle of wine for the long wait - that was nice. Once we were sat, our waiter Lanny was the man! Very friendly and knowledgable. Quick to take orders and make suggestions. Food was delish and filling for small plates Italian. Overall affordable and yummy spot to eat with group of people. I'd go back for sure."
"I made reservations for 2 for Friday at 6pm and man was I happy I did. This place was hoppin'!  I was a little turned off by how loud it was;  we were seated in a semi-outdoor patio (not right on the street but an open air room).  The indoor dining room and the outdoor patio were very noisy though, it was difficult to hear my friend while we ate.  It didn't help that next to our table was an exit for a parking garage so every time the garage door opened there was a flashing light and a loud beeping noise....be warned, do not sit on the north end of the patio!  What I liked best about this restaurant is that you can order half bottles of wine in a carafe so my friend and I were both able to order the wines we wanted.  They have a nice array of small plates to order from and share with others which makes it a nice place to go with someone else and share a lot of different things off the menu.  We had an attentive waitress and didn't feel rushed.  All in all it was a decent joint, nothing to rave about but a solid choice if you are hungry and thirsty in the area."
"Mmmm mmm mmm!  We loved our meal at Quartino's!  A friend of ours is a server at Quartino's, which is what brought us in for our first meal.  Honestly, I totally thought that this was a fairly expensive place reserved for a date night.  Not so, after perusing their menu.  Let's start with the wine.  They get their name from their extensive wine list and the little Quartino sized carafes in which they serve it.  There are a ton of reasonably priced wines - some of the quartinos are $9 or $10 but you get two full glasses out of it.  Superb!  Our server was really familiar with the wine list, so it doesn't hurt to ask if you're not sure what to pick or what may go with your meal.We decided to dine on appetizers for the evening, so we got an olive plate, fondue and bruscetta.  The fondue was absolutely phenomenal, especially for a restaurant that doesn't specialize in fondue.  The four cheeses blended together nicely and we got a ton of bread for dipping.  It was really filling for two people and definitely worth getting for lunch or dinner.  The olives were very tasty and the bruscetta was a nice end to the meal.  Fresh and topped with a lot of basil, which is super tasty.I really liked Quartino.  The only downside is the location and thus the throngs of tourists that flock to this restaurant on a daily basis.  The place gets pretty busy later in the evening, especially on weekends, so arrive around 6 and you'll be fine.  We sat at the bar, which is perfectly fine and not super crowded and we still had great service. There's valet parking or a public garage nearby (I'm not sure if they validate)."
"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet. Since before even living in Chicago, I have visited Quartino and now it's one of my favorite places to  share with friends and visitors. Italian tapas. Need I say more?While the wine flows (and comes in several sizes and is reasonably priced) start my ordering some of my faves: the cheese fondue (with apples!), the honey lemon romaine salad or dive right to cheese and meats, all delicious and worth the calories! All of the pastas are amazing, but save room for the doughnuts!The noisy bustle of the place is overwhelming but the two floor restaurant is just lovely. Getting reservations is a good idea, especially for groups. People will be impressed by the fast arriving food, plentiful wine and reasonable prices. Definitely a great choice for any occasion- date, visitors, birthdays!"
"I love Quartino so much. For some reason I always forget that it's there, but when I remember, I'm so glad I did!The pizzas are crispy & amazing... the veggie pizza is definitely my favorite. I usually avoid veggie pizza's because they're always covered in mushrooms (I just can't bring myself to eat fungus), but this one is covered in everything I love! Asparagus, eggplant, zucchini... all topped with arugula!? Sign me up!I've also tried a variety of the small plates & pasta, and wow. It's all delicious, and very fairly priced. They have a great wine selection, will give you tastings if you have no clue what you're looking for, and everyone just generally provides great service. I have absolutely no complaints. Be sure to (drink your Ovaltine) make reservations!"
"Excellent spot, excellent service. Servings are made to share. I had the salamette with parmesan to start, then roasted chicken & tortellini. All delicious, but the Zeppole for desert made my night. Very reasonably priced for the area."
"Definitely a unique restaurant.  Not your average Italian joint.  Staff were consistently friendly.  The menu had plenty of good choices, even for a picky eater like myself.  Be ready to have multiple people helping you though (that threw me off in the beginning).  I guess they have kind of a ""team"" approach to serving tables?  Overall, I really enjoyed the atmosphere; it was a nice cross between casual and ""nice"".  We went around 10:30pm, and the full menu was still available.  Would definitely recommend this place to others."
"Good for close friends or smaller business gathering.  Very active/vibrant dining area that not so supportive of serious client dialogue.  If out to simply eat, drink and be merry while too much food (good red sauce by the way) keeps coming then this is a destination of choice."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Been here at the least 20 times in the past couple years.  Great date place at night (Especially late at night- get a bottle of wine and some deserts), or a wonderful family spot for lunch or dinner (big round tables). The interior has a very old world feel to it.  Cast iron, mix-matched plates, beautiful tile, large vintage mirrors, worn tables (in a good way).  I absolutely love the interior and sometimes come just for the feel of the place.  I've often been here during the day and the upstairs area was reserved for both a baby shower and bridal shower and the guests seemed very pleased, happy and comfortable.  Lots of laughing and munching.  The tortellini is my go-to and I get it essentially every time.  The alfredo sauce is not over powering, even with the generous layering of parmegian cheese on top.  Prosciutto is perfect in this dish and every bite has peas that never seem to run out.I've never broken the bank here and have been surprised at how low the bill was plenty of times.  The service is wonderful.  I can tell a restaurant has decent service when the waiters have been around for awhile.  Usually means they get paid well to do their job well.  I have seen a handful of the same faces for years now and holy crap do they know the ins and outs of the business.  Very pleased every time. Check this place out for sure.  You won't be disappointed."
"During the warmer months their reservation desk/host stand is so chaotic you would think they were giving away golden tickets or something. I think they really need to work on organizing that madness that you walk right into when you step foot in the place. Seating: Might as well have sat me on the lap of the person next to me. Tables are so close and our table for 4 was so small, it needed to be a table for two. Service: Once they figured out who was going to be our server the mediocrity begin. Food: Pizza is ok but the crust could be a little thicker on the bottom to prevent the soggy crust debacle that ensued. Eggplant parmigiana was pretty good but not awesome. The cavatelli was a little undercooked but the sauce was pretty delicious.Overall: food seems hit or miss and it's quite possible that this place was just having an off day. If i got invited back I might go just to give this place a fair shot."
I love this restaurant. I had my birthday party here and I had a fantastic time. The food and service were both excellent. I can't wait to come back for that Linguini and Clams. Delicious!
"You cant go wrong with tiny Italian share plates, cheap wine and amazing pizzas.I work in the area and come into Quartino all the time. The food is excellent and the staff here is very knowledgeable on the menu and very friendly. The bartender Andrew knows exactly what I like when I sit down, and Reketa was an excellent server when I had her. Their duck confit and spinach pizza is probably the best thing on the menu. Although the food comes out as it's ready and is intended to be shared, it's hard to share that one. I always recommend this place to people who are looking for quality Italian food with a bustling atmosphere."
"This was a solid choice for dinner in Chicago. It was very loud and crowded which is not unusual, but maybe more than some. Had the appy platter of olives, salamis, cheeses, salads. It was very good and a great way to try a variety if things st this small plate Italian  bistro. We also had pizza which was so blah it was sad. Wish we had gone with gnocchi, risotto or another pasta and a side to share. Pizza was so blah and filling enough to stop our ordering. Good point was that we had a pretty low bill for a Chicago dinner."
"This is the PERFECT place for a night out with the girls, a group dinner or a private party.  It's in a prime location with pizza and small entress to share.  I like to think of it as the ""italian tapas joint"".  I mean, it totally is sans the Sangria.The meats and cheeses are a must!  Actually, everything is good!  The prices are unbelievable and there is a good variety to choose from.  Order away - it ends up being so inexpensive at the end anyway - unless you're thirsty beasts like me and my girls...lol."
"3.5 stars.A recent trip to Chicago with some friends landed us here our first night. We were staying a few blocks down and Yelp told us this was the closest thing to where we were staying that was open late.It's basically Italian tapas, more or less. We rounded up a few items from the menu -duck prosciutto, a margherita pizza and polenta fries red bell pepper salsa as well as few beers. Nothing amazing and mind-blowing, but the duck prosciutto was pretty on point. Can't say I've had duck like that before, so it was a pleasant surprise for everyone at the table. The assorted pickled veggies that accompanied it were gone in a heartbeat. BTW, I almost stole the mini cast iron skillet they came in. That thing was too amazing not to have. The polenta fries were fun but slightly bland, a little salt or seasoning would've made this a winner, hands down.The best of the night had to be the cheese grater they seemed to have imported from Italy. A plastic container with a fresh block of cheese in it that is shredded when needed. Contemplated stealing that as well, but my partner in crimes purse was too small. Service was great considering we came in at around 1230a and the place shut down at around 2a. We weren't rushed or anything and our server let us take our time when checking out the menu selection. Chicago service noted.The bottom line is they have stuff worth stealing."
"Stopped in here on a Monday night and it was jammed...45 min wait for a table.  No biggie...I wanted to get my booze on anyway so we headed to the bar and ordered a ""glass"" of wine...AH, I LOVE THIS PLACE.  It gives you a carafe of wine for a glass...this is what I am talking bout.Alas, after my carafe and 75 mins later....still no table.  The bartenders felt bad for us and gave us another on the house....and soon our table was ready and I was in wine heaven.  It is a bustling little place.  I couldnt believe the crowd on a MONDAY?!  If this place is this good, why havent I been here before?!?!????  We asked our server what was good and bad...the thing that I LOVED was that he actually answered the question.  I hate it when people say everything is good...have an opinion....Veal Meatball slider-ABSOLUTELY my FAV....I could have had like 10 of these things...so delish.  Good thing I eat meat now...little balls of nomy-nomyGnocchi-so good but so heavy...it didnt stop me from stuffing my face full of the pesto goodiesScallops-YUMMY and flavorful, not gritty and HUGECaprese-Everyone said it was good, but I was disappointed...the tomatoes where mush-y...like gritty...YUCKCalamari-pretty standard....but a little flavor-less....we were salting it and I never add salt so you know it didnt taste like much...not a fanI was absolutely stuffed at the end of the meal.  The service was pretty good, always checking on us, etc....the tapas just kept coming which is nice for a big or small group.  I would definitely go back...especially for the heavy pours of the wines...and they are all so freaking cheap."
"Had a group of 9 and a reservation for 8.  They were able to seat us on time (Friday night at 8 pm).  The food was very good and fairly reasonable for the area.  We tried a number of dishes and the desserts are works of art.  The service was also very good, with a group of servers actively engaged in helping everyone get their food and drinks in a timely fashion."
"Can't go wrong. Good food, lively atmosphere at a reasonable price. Our service was over the top. Extremely attentive even on a busy Friday night."
"Love this place, I only have one complaint from my last experience...see below.This is one of my most favorite Italian restaurants.  So I decided to take the boyfriend here for his b-day.  They weren't able to seat us upstairs like I'd requested, but were very nice and at least sat us off to the side so we weren't in the middle of the very crowded and a bit loud portion of main dining area.  The food was delicious as usual and the wine was also very good and I love that it is decently priced.Make sure you know ahead of time that is essentially Italian food served tapas style.  So you order multiple dishes to share.  There were 2 of us and we ordered the risotto, cavatelli, a prosciutto and cheese platter, rigatoni and chicken alfredo.  We probably could have ordered one less dish and been fine, but who doesn't love leftovers?  Exactly.The only downside was the service.  Our server approached the table and began talking to us like we were 12 year olds explaining how to order.  Um, I've been here many times, I know how to order.  Someone should explain to the servers to first ask the diners if they've been to the restaurant before, instead of immediately talking to them as if they've never eaten at a restaurant in their life.  Also, why are the servers now allowed to wear obnoxiously colored gymshoes?  It just makes the restaurant feel not as classy.Thankfully the food is so delicious that it makes up for one night of not so great service."
"Restaurant ReviewThis use to be a personal favorite when out of town guest would visit because of the tapas style Italian menu, however I may have to reconsider after my last trip. The restaurant serves smaller portions of entrees that are available to share if you have a large party. Be sure to get a reservation or be prepared to wait a long time for a table during dinner hours. A quick review of our meal:1. Margherita pizza- thin crust variety home made mozzarella and sweet basil leaf makes for a great sharing dish2. Dates wrapped in pancetta- small appetizer dish perfect with wine3. House bread- great with olive oil and parmesean cheese from the grater (unlike other restaurants this is the real deal in your own personal grater)4. Fettuccini- fresh made fettuccini pasta cooked perfectly in a white sauce5. Tortellini- thin slices of proscuitto bring out the tortellini. No complaints here6. Linguini with clams- this is one of the highlight dishes with perfectly cooked linguini slightly above al dente with a few clams complimented by a white or red sauce. 7. Penne alla vodka- can't really taste the vodka, an okay dish8. Rigatoni- a few chicken chunks that were slightly over cook detracted from this dish9. Shrimp risotto- shrimp were not overcooked and a healthy amount of cheese holds the dish together well10. Sauteed spinach- over-rated and over priced. spinach with garlic and oil.. Blah11. Beef short ribs- fall off the bone tissue with a nice salsa verde12. Beef filets- amazing, so small though the piece of beef. perfectly cooked filet mignon13. Gran Coppa Quartino- expensive, but if you like gelato and biscotti with hazelnut this is the dessert for you. Has all three gelato flavors14. Fantasia Coppa di Frutta- equally as expensive as above but with all flavors of sorbet15. Panino al Gelato Limone - very soft lemon gelato sandwich16. Zeppole - Great dish to share, inexpensive.

"Quartino has some really delicious food, but my God does it get loud! It would have been 5 stars, but it seriously is almost deafening in there. The noise can be somewhat overwhelming, but the great food makes up for it. So on to that great food...Penne Alla Vodka was really tasty and creamy without being too decadent. The Angus Beef Carpaccio was surprisingly good. The Pizza Margherita was one of the better ones I have had. The Veal Meatballs Napoli are also worth trying. I would skip the Polenta Fries though.Its portions are reasonably sized and priced, and are great for sharing. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well. Quartino lives up to the hype!"
I love Quartino!  What a great place for a date and also a great place for happy hour or even just drinks.   I prefer to go when their outdoor seating is available.  The prices are very reasonable and it is nice when you have a group of 4 or less so that you can order a bunch of things to taste.  Last time I went was within the last month.  My husband and I double dated with another couple.  The food was so good.  The service was great.  The only thing that I was not good was how loud it was.  It was hard to hear after a while which became very frustrating.   I guess that is the price you pay for going on a Saturday night.  I have gone after work before and have never experienced that kind of noise level.  Your best bet is waiting until it warms up and sit outside because that is the absolute best!
"Definitely in my top 10 for downtown dining.  Very seldom a wait, great small plates with very unique flavors, delicious bread, and an excellent wine selection.  I will be coming back often."
"I don't see what the rave is about.  The food was mediocre, at best.  Quartino has a large menu of items, but they should probably offer fewer options and increase the quality of the ingredients. We ordered:1) Veal Meatballs Napoli: They arrived lukewarm.  The meatballs were soft, but had an almost gamey taste.  2) Crisp Calamari: Run-of-the-mill calamari.  The tomato sauce was rather bland.3) Roasted Baby Octopus:  Underdone. Chewy, rubbery and tasted like salt water.  Came with what looked like a sauteed bok choy, which was good.4) Shrimp Risotto: Probably the best dish of those that we ordered.  Risotto cooked well, good amount of shrimp.5) Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo: We appreciated the homemade pasta, but it was a little thick and the rest of the flavors were not there.  The braised beef tomato sauce was somewhat watery - not a thick, flavorful sauce.   6) Polenta Fries: Good, crispy.  The red pepper sauce is a nice touch.7) Sangria: The sangria part was fine, but it needed more fruit.  There were only a few slices of green apple in the pitcher they brought for our table.  Also, we went on a Saturday night and sat outside.  They will clear the outside seating by 11 pm, so make sure you go early enough not to feel rushed through your meal."
"Serves food late! We ate around 11:30pm and it was nice to sit in actual restaurant not just bar food. Quartino serves small plates which i love love love, its fun to try a bunch of things and the portions are decent size, especially the pastas.         The goat cheese ricotta was so heavenly and fluffy I would go back just for that!  Tried the pancetta-wrapped dates drizzled with honey (yum)  the tortellini with peas and prosciutto in cream sauce ( crisp peas that popped in your mouth with fresh flavor- yum).   Generous sized scallops were nicely cooked and buttery.        Tried the white wine sangria which wasn't my favorite, kind of an odd flavor and almost no fruit.  Made up for it with the coppa de banana dessert, a carmelized banana, vanilla gelato homemade whipped cream and chocolate shavings!  Again, yum.        This place is extremely loud, I think something to do with the acoustics and high ceilings because there were fewer than 10 people in bar area but it seemed like they were screaming. Nothing a few rugs or wall decor wouldn't help.        Not life-changing, but tasty food and ill definitely go back to try their pizzas.  :)"
"While planning our trip to Chicago, I wanted to make some reservations at popular restaurants in the area. I found Quartino after looking at reviews and thought I'd give it a try. We ate here on Saturday night and I'm sure glad I made reservations. It was packed inside and outside! Just getting to the hostess stand was a challenge to push through all the people. As for the food.. Quartino calls itself a ""tapas"" kind of place so you can try a bunch of things and share. They encourage you to keep your menu at your table so you can order as you go. We ordered the oricchette with sausage, lasagna, salami, broccoli rabe, and a few other dishes I can't remember. The salami and pasta dishes were my favorite. They were flavorful and filling. I didn't really care for the broccoli rabe - it was basically boiled soggy vegetables with no flavor. We also ordered some of their white sangria - that was yummy. They have 3 sizes to order so its great for sharing.The main downside I had with this restaurant was the noise level. It was EXTREMELY loud... probably one of the noisiest places I've ever eaten at... and that's counting all the Chinese restaurants! It was hard to hear or even talk, it felt like we were screaming at each other. Towards the end it wasn't even worth trying to talk over the crowds. I don't think this would be a good place to bring a family or a group of friends if you want to catch up. Also, the bathroom is upstairs and out of the way. Not a huge deal but inconvenient."
"Consistently fantastic and fresh. Menu is imaginative and large. I always have to stop here in the course of my Michigan Avenue wanderings, and I've brought friends to this restaurant. They were equally impressed!"
"I was mixing their flavored sodas with Greygoose and really couldn't have been happier with my cocktail choice.  :)  We ordered an AMAZING meat and tomato-based rigatoni (?) - sorry, it's been two weeks...my brain is fuzzy on the details.  We also ordered the gnocchi with pesto which neither of us liked at all.  The bruschetta were fun - all three a different compilation of ingredients. And for dessert we ordered the doughnuts which neither of us liked either.  SO.  My three stars are for the ONE pasta and my cocktail deliciousness.  That is all.  The server was perfectly informative as to the workings of the menu and seemed attentive to our every need.  I would go back just to try other things on the menu."
Best Italian in Chicago
"Kind of ordinary but when you are trying to find a place to eat with 8 adults?  (god help us if our group has kids, we probably would still be wandering around trying to find a place to eat)  We literally stumbled onto this place while walking around the city investigating a few places that we have heard about.  I like the family dining aspect that you find here, with it being more like Italian tapas than the big plates that you find other places.  A good house wine (even though I was running 9 miles the next day) and good conversation made this a reasonable and fun experience."
"I have been here 6 or 7 times, many times with friends from out of town, and I am always proud of the choice!  It is nice without being uppity.  This past Friday, I went with three friends and we walked in to a PACKED lobby... I said to the host that I was afraid to know how long the wait was for 4 people, and he said, ""we actually have a table available!""  We felt like we had won the lottery!  Some tasty things to try... the mussels (YUM and the endless bread they bring is perfect for dipping in the extra soupiness!), the pizzas, each cut into 8 slices for only $10-12 is a great bargain... the sausage and margherita are tasty, and the wines are GREAT deals (go for the bottle.... they start at only $18 each!!).  I would skip the sundried tomato soup--  my friend ordered it and it looked like tomato paste, and skip the pizza with arugula and balsamic-- ew!  In general, I think the pasta dishes are not quite the value that you would guess in a place that is so reasonable... the portions are quite small!  Check this place out!"
Stopped by Quartino on a total whim. From the outside it looks super nice and I was a little nervous i was under dressed but when i entered i noticed they had a typical bar area as well as a nicer section for dinner. I glanced at the menu and knew i wanted everything on it. There choices of wine are delicious as well as extremely reasonably priced. It a huge restaurant and can get a little noisy but over all i really enjoyed my appetizers and bottle of red. Next time i go i plan to get some dinner and perhaps do a wine flight!! cheers :)
"Have come several times for lunch, not dinner yet (but most def!).  Every time's been very enjoyable.  Good, solid Italian food served in a very cosy, casual, unpretentious setting that still manages to project a very classy establishment.  Don't be put off thinking since it's in the tourist area that it's touristy and pricey (not!).  You'd really be missing out.Girls' afternoon lunch started off with a bang, a carafe of bellinis.  Yummy!!  Fresh bread at table.  Friend had the tomato soup (loved it) and salad.  I had the pappardelle al ragu di cinghiale e porcini, which was very good.  The pasta was perfect.  The sauce was a bit oversalted, but overall nicely thick with good spices and herbs.  Eyed the neighboring tables' pizzas with envy, but too full.  Next time!The friendly manager made the rounds of all the tables, very nice.  Service is always good, but this last visit was exceptional, I think in part because they were all in love with my friend.  Will make sure to invite her to meals more often, LOL."
"I had the Salumeria Tasting which included cheese, prosciutto, olives, eggplant and bread. It was delicious. I also tried their Dates Wrapped in Pancetta Stuffed with Gorgonzola Dolce & Drizzled with Honey. All heavenly delicious. I split the vegetarian pizza with  Asparagus, Cauliflower, Zucchini, Eggplant, & Wild Arugula and had a quartino of the vino. Desert, I tried the Torta al Cioccolato Hot Chocolate Cake & Vanilla Gelato. Everything was excellent. Service pleasant and attentive. Highly recommended for a night out."
"After a long day walking downtown a very windy trek, my friend and I realized we couldn't get a table in time at our first restaurant preference. We decided to try out Quartino although it looked pretty packed when we passed by it. It was with some belief in luck that we still decided to make our way to this tapas style joint and hoped to get a table on a Saturday night.  And fortune did shine on us! We were seated right away, amidst a large crowd in the waiting area! Strength in the lack of numbers worked for us..with a little bit of luck! Quartino was overall a loud, rustic, energized, and tasty tapas experience. The menu is very Italian with house made pastas with a selection of choices all round. Not a bad wine list either. Easy to see that the place gets pretty busy easily. Still, I have to say that their service was pretty amazing! We had the Cavatelli (excellent pasta), Shrimp Risotto (very tasty), Eggplant Parmesan (cheesy but good) and the Rustic sausage (so-so). It was a decent amount of food for two hungry people. I really liked the Cavatelli. The basil and tomatoes on there just made it right! All the dishes were timed fairly well! We got dishes two at a time, and since we had a pretty small table, it made things very practical. My friend wanted Tiramisu badly, and was disappointed to find that it was not on the menu. A little surprised we asked our peppy server, and lo and behold, they had it as a special off the menu! Our luck was not running out in here, as the big loaf of Tiramisu served to us was pretty amazing and heavenly!! Such a generous portion too! We certainly took our time!A great find in the city, for an excellent price!"
"Great feel to this downtown restaurant. There was a nice vibe and atmosphere. Tuesday night and the restaurant was packed. Small plates are all the rage in Chicago and Quartino was no exception. We started with the Caprese Salad - good but nothing outstanding. Buffalo mozzarella was fair. Veal sliders were ok but not a must try. Roasted Octopus was very tasty and tender. Mushroom Risotto was a favorite and pays out on the appetite appeal of the description. Pesto Gnocchi was tasty, a good balance of flavors. My only real ding on the place was the volume. Per my preamble, I like a restaurant that's buzzing but I also like to talk during dinner. This is definitely perfect for a fun night out but not for business."
"Cute & sophisticated Italian restaurant- surprised there were seats available on a Saturday afternoon, when most of the others were packed. Good food & good service. Prices are decent for Italian cuisine & location of the place. Would love to go for the 3rd time."
"The food at Quartino's is not great, but it's good enough and it makes up for it with its buzzing atmosphere, great service, good wine options and wide range of menu options. And so I am giving it 4 stars, although the food may only merit 3.I returned to Quartino's on a Saturday night with a group of girls. We ordered a bunch of dishes including the caponata, spinach, broccoli rabe, white bean puree, salmon, shrimp, pizza, and olives.The waiter raved about the caponata so we obviously had to order it. If I were him, I'd stop talking it up because I've had much better. It was pretty much mushy eggplant tomato paste. I like my caponata sweeter or with more depth in flavor.The vegetables also were not great. Both the spinach and broccoli rabe were sitting in way too much liquid that watered them down and the broccoli rabe was super bitter. The ""mains"" were a bit better. Although i didn't have it on this visit, pizza is definitely your best bet. The salmon was cooked well and I enjoyed the tomatoes on the dish. This review isn't meant to scare anyone off. The food isn't the worst. So, if you want a fun girls night out then I still say head to Quartino's -- just stick with the  pizza and wine."
"Food is okay, in downtown, what you can expect. But the waiter is a little racist, since he don't understand my accent, he shows his hate and inpatient face to me. What I can say, feel a little disapointed"
"Dined there twice last week with two groups of colleagues from Europe, one of whom is a hard core vegetarian and fussy about food in general. We ate there the first night because a colleague who would miss the scheduled night was so intrigued by the menu. Well decorated, big noisy, busting place serving ""Italian Tappas"". All dishes are modest to small and the tables come with stacks of small plates for sharing.  I can honestly say that everything we tried was fantastic. Pizza was amazing. Veal, Chicken, Octopus, Gnocchi, Vegetable dishes, Antipasti, Osso Bucco, salads all great. Nice bar and solid selection of wine and beer. My colleagues were all raving about the place. So will you."
"Quartino is a solid 4 star, but I'm giving it 5 to make up for the underrating as well as to give the management and staff a high five on jobs well done!  Located close to the Red Head I'd been by Quartinos many many times but never dined there...We had a group of 12 that I booked through yelp/opentable late afternoon on the day of.  Our numbers changed up and down, communicated with Quartino a couple of times, then ultimately wound up with 11 after all, conventions are always a challenge locking down folks for dinner...I equate it to herding cats!When we arrived we checked in and were told it would be about 15 minutes....no problem...we negotiated the bar area and got a round.  It was Monday night and the hustle and bustle, tight quarters, and upbeat feel of the patrons was an ambiance that just felt comfortable.  Some where around the 20 minute mark, a manager came by, identified our group, acknowledged our wait time and assured us our table was next up...then bought our group a round at the bar for having to wait longer than expected.  Well done Matt.  Well done.  Within minutes we were on our way to our table.The waitstaff were welcoming, knowledgeable, and prompt.  The variety of choices and small plate style really works well for a group.  Our table had a variety of the offerings, all of which were very good with the pork shank and meatballs standing out in my memory.  Overall a very nice experience at Quartinos.Good people, good food, good times..."
"Good, solid Italian food.  Nothing special about this place, but worth a visit."
First time I had the risotto with Italian sausage with peas it was good April Ordered the tortellini with fettuccine sauce I had to finch it never disappointed with the food.
"I think I'm going to fall asleep in a food coma tonight because of this place! Went here for a work dinner while traveling for training.  We had some locals who helped us navigate the menu.  It's best to order a few things and share.  For us about one dish a person worked out great.  Here is what we tried:-Polenta fries.  If you love Polenta these are flavored well and add a little twist on what you're used to.  They come with a really nice tomato-based dipping sauce.-Bruchetta.-Pizza.  We had the Soprano (with veal meatballs), Sausage, and Margherita.  All very thing crust.  Really awesome.  Their pizza sauce is really good!-Gnocchi.  I didn't try this personally but I heard from the group that it was great.-Asparagus risotto.  This was really yummy.  It kind of looked like baby food but tasted like adult food :)-Plate of cheese, olives, and meats.  Just order a bunch.I personally didn't order the wine but it was really good.  It came in carafes and you drink it out of little cups, not wine glasses, which is fun.  The ambiance here is really nice!Finally dessert - fruit gelatos were tasty, the chocolate cake with vanilla gelato was really good if you love a lava cake/molten cake, tiramisu was light, and we also had these donuts with dipping sauce of honey or chocolate.  It's deep fried bread, really light and yummy.  Must try more than one dessert!Also I must say the restrooms were really nice and clean."
it was okay. duck prosciutto wasnt that great but i wish i would had tried more tapas. next time chicago!
"YUMMMMMMM!!!!!!Amazing waiter.  Impossible to get anyone else that knows so much about the food they are serving.  Recommended wines.  Fantastic.The food.  Perfection.  Served quickly for such a busy space.  Eggplant Parmesan, linguini with red sauce & clams, risotto with shrimp.  Nothing about this restaurant was bad.Went because it was recommended by someone from Italy that said this was the closest thing to the food they had back in her country."
"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. I had made reservations for 6:30 but was not seated until 7:15 (to be fair, I didn't get there until 6:45ish). The star I'm knocking off is mostly due to the wait: people were crammed like sardines in the waiting area and it was somewhat suffocating. Reading other reviews, this seems to be more of a norm than an exception.Despite the delay, once we were seated the overall experience was great. The waiter (can't remember his name but he looked like the pudgy guy from Grey's Anatomy, not that I watch that show) was very helpful and attentive.Pros:Cavatelli - simple-sounding pasta dish, but was oh so delicious. Perfectly-cooked pasta, and the ricotta cheese really made the sauce popBeef Short Rib - 13 bucks for one rib seems a little steep, but it was mighty tastyMushroom Risotto - Not as enjoyable for me as the two dishes above, but if you're a fungus fan you'll love the flavorsCons:Romaine Hearts Salad - looks like a bed of chopped-up lettuceDesserts - ordered a half-order of the doughnuts and a half-order of the Tiramisu. While neither were bad, I expected a little morePro-Tip: Our waiter was extremely helpful in recommending we order half-orders of a couple of our dishes (I was not aware we could do this). The half-orders were still generous, and allowed us to really expand the variety of dishes we tried without overly taxing the stomach/wallet. Good call, Grey's-man!"

"My boyfriend and I visited Quartino for the second time during my last visit to Chicago. We made a reservation for 6pm on July 3rd, right before the holiday, and it was pretty packed. I loved the rustic, authentic ambiance of the restaurant. It's a family place (and kind of touristy), but it can also be very romantic. Other reviewers have mentioned that it's loud -- we sat next to the kitchen and it didn't seem loud at all. We were also very intrigued by the Dolce Vita-esque movie playing behind us, and while my boyfriend was slightly confused by it, I thought it definitely added to the mid-century Italian feel of the restaurant. On to the food -- we decided to order one pizza, one order of pasta and one order of tapas. I thought each dish was very well made. We had dates wrapped in pancetta, and some were very soft and meaty, others were a little bit chewier, but I still thought they were good overall. I do have a weakness for pancetta, so I may be biased. Then we had the cavatelli with homemade ricotta, tomato sauce and basil. I LOVED it. I think my boyfriend was unimpressed, but I loved the texture of the cavatelli, the homemade ricotta was fresh and the sauce was delicious. Then we had a small pizza, half arugula with duck prosciutto (my half) and half quatro stagioni. I only had the duck prosciutto one and I was also very pleased. It was very original, the prosciutto was *slightly* dry, but I still enjoyed it and I loved the crust. My boyfriend seemed pleased with his half, but I'm not sure. Our server was pleasant -- she was the one who recommended the cavatelli and for that I will be forever grateful. Lastly, I ordered a quarter liter of a sauvignon blanc for only $6! I thought it was such a good deal. Overall, I think we spent less than $50, which I think is pretty good for a date night."
"My boyfriend and I came here 3 years ago and came back recently because we liked it so much! The food is delicious! Lots of options for what youre in the mood for ( Italian food wise) . There are plenty of good bottles of wine for fairly cheap prices. We had the dates rapped in pancetta - deliciously sweet, penne alla vodka, fruit de la mare and the Zeppolis for dessert- we shared all the dishes and it was only $35! The wait staff was so friendly and helpful and even accommodated our specific seating reservation-we called ahead. Check this out if you want good italian food!"
"It's just five stars because it is.Yes, it's noisy. Yes, you will need a reservation.I have tried almost everything on the menu over the course of four years of patronizing the place, and have never had a miss (even gnocchi, which i really don't enjoy, is yummy at Quartino). Small dishes means more variety, and you will leave stuffed. They serve a delicious and super cheap Lambrusco, one of the dozens on their extremely robust wine list, their cocktails are on point, and the desserts are killer.Their wait staff is always in a phenomenal mood, very helpful, and very, very patient. Even the busboys, in the midst of all their bustling about, stop a moment to smile and exchange pleasantries with you. It's just a a really nice place to be after the end of a long work week.Finally, it's extremely reasonable. A party of six ordered two kinds of olives, all five sputinis, 2 salumis, 2 fromaggi, a pizza, 2 vegetable sides, a meat dish, 2 seafood dishes, pasta, risotto, 1 dessert and 4 carafes of wine (granted, it was the lambrusco), and it came out to 50 bucks each with tip. You will be happy, you will be full, you will be buzzed."
"A classic example of catering to the Midwestern palate, I guess. The food has the potential to be very good, but blandness ruled the day. All the flavors were right, but the volume was turned down to one. Chicagoans aren't afraid of some garlic, right?!A tiny bit more salt and a fair bit more of every other seasoning would make a huge difference. Pizza, while overall pretty good, was likewise under-seasoned and overloaded with toppings and (especially) too much mozzarella--a sure way to make an otherwise-good crust soggy and lame. Props for a good menu, friendly service, reasonable prices, and a fun (but loud!) environment. Not a bad spot for a casual meal--but demerits for the bland food, mediocre coffee. Overall, a pretty significant miss but great potential."
Eating at Quartinos is like eating at the local grocier. Great fresh food with wine to go. Its our local spot for eating and drinking. Yum!
"I was there last summer. It was a really quick trip so I dont think we were able to taste anything but 2 dishes so I do not want to review based on food. You can choose to do a 'tapas' style dinner. so the tapas come out at random times, kinda fun and new if you and your girlfriends or maybe your best half want to share OR you can also choose to do it all together.We split the Alfredo. This dish was OK. Nothing special. I think Olive Garden has the best alfredo sauce in my opinion. But again I will give the food another chance.The atmosphere was nice. Jeans and a cute top and nice flats are enough. You can sit outside in a little patio right by the street or inside. And the prices aren't too bad for the location either.I am willing to give it another try."
It is good.  The service is very good.
"Officially my most favorite Italian restaurant. On the contrary to other reviews, my friend and I showed up around 12:00 am on weekend and got our table right away. After going to a concert, we were starving. I absolutely love tapas as small dishes allowed us to try many different things. The young artichoke dish was pleasant, and the red pepper with capers was delicious. Their homemade gnocchi and ravioli were OUT OF THIS WORLD. Definitely come back next time I'm in Chicago, now that I can buy their cheap wine :P"
"This is our second visit. We lived the first and now the second visit was equally fantastic!!  We arrived early for our reservation so we sat at the bar to have a glass of wine. The bartender was so attentive,  I ordered my wine, which he described to be very fruity and maybe I should try it first. He was right!  Not my cup of tea, so he recommended a few based on what I said I liked. Amazing!"
"Went to Quartinos recently with a friend for dinner it is not spectacular but it is a solid, fun place to go. We got to sit outside on a nice day, which helped.The place is Italian food in tapas portions, hence Italian pastas. We tried one of the potato topped pizzas which was good, along with a sausage risotto, which was awesome, and the vodka penna, which was good.We had some wine, which is offered in a lot of different sizes and has some really reasonably priced options. Our waiter was fantastic and honestly told us which were the dishes to avoid.I would go back and recommend you try it if have not already."
"Looooovee Quartinos for anything from a nice sidewalk dinner to a drink after a very long day.  Excellent beer, wine and spirit options.  Great food.....veal sliders, pastas and pizzas (very good pizzas) are delicious.  Reasonable prices and great service will keep me coming back."
"Great food (tapas style), service, atmosphere, and location."
"Seriously cannot get enough of this place.Came the other day when my parents were in from out of town. We ordered tons of dishes and of all the dishes we tried, they were all fantastic but one. The only complaint of the entire night? The gnocchi were entirely tasteless, the dough was overworked and not seasoned, and somehow the pesto didn't have any flavor at all. BUT! Out of 15 dishes to only have one that wasn't great? Fine by us. The risotto was incredible.Cant wait for our weekly Quartino night this week."
"Service is awesome, the gelato is amazing, and their food and wine is so reasonably priced. They also have great outdoor seating and a laid back atmosphere. It's a great place for dates or for a group of friends. Never disappointed. And for the love of God try the vanilla gelato."
"Love Love Love Quartino! The food is always consistently good here. I love getting a bunch of things and sharing. And the best part - it's cheap! I feel like I leave having eaten everything on the menu and get wine and its only 15 dollars! Only downside to this place is that it is beyond loud, do not come here if you are looking for a quiet romantic date or need to talk to your parents or something."
"My sister, mom and I ate here one night when I got off work.  They had red wine.  We had a very pleasant time considering the busy evening there as we sat in the bar section.  We sat at the high tables with high stools near the bar. Although I don't drink, the family enjoyed choosing from the Quartino wine selection.  I think service seems to move quicker when you sit at the bar or near it and the drinks are coming often to the table.  My sister, mom, and I haven't been out just the three of us so this was a nice choice to stop by after work for dinner.We shared a Neopolitan Pizza and as always got dessert with coffee."
I love the service and the pizza. The donut balls are too oily and not good. I would choose another dessert next time. Definitely will go back to try more dishes.
"What? I've never written a review for this place?? Well, it's about time, I think! I came here for their Wednesday's unlimited wine and pizza last night ($20, and you may bring home a bottle of wine for $10). As a group, we had a RSVP of about 70 people. We packed the upstairs. Be prepare to stand in a long line to get to the salads, thinly sliced cured meats and prosciutto, cheese cubes and slices of bread. Forks are in the middle (I missed it because my eyes were taking in all the delicious-looking food). The servers will pass around the pizza but my suggestion is to stay near the kitchen doors. I only got around 2 slices of pepperoni pizza (delicious, by the way). The place is like an Italian tapas place, and I'm a big fan of small plates. A hotel concierge actually told me about this place a long time ago. That was when I first visited Quartino. I loved it. The food was great. Much better than Mercat. Not quite the same, I know, but for Italian small plate? Yum! It's over a year since my first trip here so I don't remember what I ordered. All I know is that almost everything was good and delicious."
"Quartino is our go to downtown restaurant. It's reasonably priced but still feels upscale and it can accommodate large groups of people (I actually had my bachelorette party here). There is a wide variety to choose from on the menu and since the portions are smaller, you can order lots of different items and experience more. The wine is great and comes in authentic italian feeling carafes and their house wine is tasty and well priced!I have been here about a zillion times and will never argue with anyone who wants to go back!"
"Had my birthday party here and it was amazing!!There is a reason that this place is always packed and everyone is having a blast....this restaurant is perfect!Such great food...and such a great variety on the menu.  $20 bottles of wine (holla!) and an environment that encourages sharing food, chatting, and having a great time.My birthday dinner was for 12 people and the service was excellent; I couldn't have asked for anything more.  If you are looking for a place to have your party, go to Quartino!  You'll likely be placed with other large parties on the second floor and it's such a fun atmosphere."
"We saw all of the reviews for this place and thought it would be great for our trip out to Chicago from LA, but we're kind of disappointed. The pizza was pretty generic, the salad was really boring. Overall, we were a little confused what all the rage was about. Seemed like a chain old school Italian place."
"This place is always buzzing with people.Finally got the chance to visit Quartino even though I stay just two blocks away from it.We were lucky to get the table without having reservation. Being Sunday evening it was packed with people.We got a tiny little table.The table was extremely small, when our order arrived it was even difficult for server to fit on our table.Ordered Parmesan Eggplant, Fondue with potatoes and wine. Eggplant was awesome and fondue was good too.Service was great.This place is kind of loud so some people might not like it. Overall good place with great food."
"I've been to Quartino's on three separate occasions. In general, I like the restaurant, location, tapas style, and bustling atmosphere. And, how I love the prices! But, I hesitate to give it 4 stars... I think it deserves maybe 3 and 3/4 stars. I'd like to emphasize that my rating is strongly supported by the prices, service, and dessert! This is a great place for big groups since you can share and try a little bit of everything.I've had a fair share of the food... pizza, the meatballs, eggplant parm, calamari, risotto, etc. Out of all of these dishes, I think I love the meatballs the most. Some of the other dishes were a little too salty for my liking. But, nothing wowed me.I'm a big dessert person, so I always save room for dessert here! I've had...- Zeppole. These fluffy little Italian doughnuts are TDF and are perfect for dipping in honey and/or dark chocolate. If you love the beignets at Grand Lux, you'll love these.- Copa Al Banana. This gelato sundae comes with caramelized bananas and chocolate sauce over creamy vanilla gelato. You really can't go wrong.- Profiteroles. I'm a big fan of profiteroles in general, and Quartino's serves great profiteroles. A little pastry puff, vanilla gelato, and chocolate sauce create the perfect bite.And the sangria is also very yummy."
"The manager went out of his way, more so than the hostess, to find us a seat on a busy Saturday night. This was a plus. However, the food left me feeling a little disappointed as I was expecting something more from this popular establishment. I likely won't be revisiting."
"Party of 8 for dinner on Thurs. Ordered a bunch but I only tried the non-meat stuff. Loved the bianca white pizza (spicy!), the rucolina/arugula pizza, the broccoli rabe and the cavatelli. I could've gone for more pizzas. The calamari was so overcooked and rubbery, i thought it was inedible, but everyone else enjoyed it :/  I also didn't care for the caprese; the tomatoes were not ripe. Another misstep - we ordered the linguini with clams and white sauce but they never came. Waiter said things got lost when tapas are ordered, not sure what that means.My pals loved the gnocchi, roast baby octopus, the pancetta wrapped dates, the papardelle and the pork belly. They also praised the wine selection. We had 2 orders of zeppole - so good!!"
"My mom and I are from out of town and decided to stop here for dinner on a Friday night. The wait was 2 hrs long but the bar tables you could seat yourself. We were lucky enough to score a table in the back. As soon as we sat down the waitress came and asked if we had been there before and since we hadn't she explained the menu very well. We were brought food and drinks in a timely manner always greeted with the warmest smiles. Even though all the tables were very full throughout the entire restaurant the service was EXCELLENT from every member of the staff. All the food is meant to be shared which cultivates an atmosphere of community and friendships. We decided to order the Stefano pizza, veal meatballs, and potato gnocchi. Our waitress suggested that we get a spicy and fruit forward full red wine that was incredible. Before we left we stopped by the bathroom which was like being taken back in time. There was a woman that greeted us at the door, subway tile all around with marble floors, the soap dispenser dispensed powder soap and the sinks were wonderful too. It's might be weird to suggest going to a restaurant's bathroom but you really should. I plan on going back there every time I visit Chicago!"
"Since the first time my girlfriends and I walked in here it has become ""Our Place""  The slogan "" Our wine is cheaper that water"" is somethign we LOOOOOOVE. The wine is great and you can have a long chat with friends over great food and wine and not blow your budget. The staff is very friendly and has gotten to know us well. We thought ...oops we once stayed here for 6.5 hours with a group of girls catching up ... they are going to hate us. We appologised and they said.."" are you kidding it happens all the time""  Its so easy to stay a long time because its like beign in your own kitchen (with someone else to cook) On busy nights its loud but its like you would expect if you were in Italy. People are having fun."
"I'll keep this one short.1. Slow service.2. Calamari was tough (but breading was great!). But calamari was tough.3. Veal steaks were underseasoned.4. Clam linguini...meh.5. Pork belly was well cooked but also underseasoned.6. Meatball slider was pretty good. It was served hot, and the giardineria was a nice spicy touch.Overall, a bit too expensive for the actual food quality."
"It's a solid place.  Good for groups, and fairly easy to make reservations.  Everything has always been good, but only one or two dishes would I highly recommend:  1) the beef short ribs, 2) duck proscuitto."
"(written by my wife)While visiting Chicago with my family to see my cousins, it happened to be my birthday. This is where my native cousins suggested we go, and after looking at a few websites of other suggestions, I agreed. It was easy to find from the L even for this out-of-towner. We were seated upstairs, and I would say the only drawback of the evening was the noise level. It was very hard to hear each other. We started with drinks. I had their Limoncello Martini - Housemade Limoncello, Absolut Citron, Fresh Squeezed Mint Lemonade. I told the server I don't like fresh mint very much, so they used their plain lemonade instead and it was divine and got me just loopy enough. My husband tried the Orangecello Martini - Housemade Orangecello, Absolut Mandarin, Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice. The kids had flavored Italian sodas. DD2 chose the lemon, and DD1 said ""surprise me"" and they brought her Passionfruit - which was unique and lightly sweet. Very refreshing. They also accidentally made a root beer flavored one, and left it for us to share, which was creamy and sparkling. yum!For dinner the 7 of us shared 2 rounds of food, tapas style...Round 1: a cheese plate - Acadamia Barilla Pecorino Dolce Sardinian - Sheep's Milk, Butter, Honey, Semi-Hard served with a fruit/nut bread and persimmon spread. Who has persimmon spread?! We had Gnocchi -  house made Potato Dumplings, Green Beans, Potatoes, Arugula Pesto & Pork Stock. It was covered in pesto, very green but not too strong in flavor. Even my husband who abhors green beans picked around them and loved this. He probably could have asked them to leave the green beans off, but he didn't. I would have added more garlic. I hit was the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo Tuscan - house made Pasta Ribbons which were light and delicate with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce. There were shreds of the beef in the sauce. The serve this with parmesan on top, which was not on the menu and my daughter does not like, so we asked for a 2nd order without parm, which they did gladly. They probably should just have parm on the table instead.Roasted Baby Octopus - Braised Escarole, Red Chili, & E.V.O.O. - my cousin knew to ask for little red chili, I guess she'd been burned before. I did not touch this, but my DD1 loved it! My husband added Crisp Calamari in Organic Tomato Sauce, but I only tried one piece of that. Not chewy at all.Round 2 included more the 2nd pasta ribbons without the parm, Asparagus Risotto - which was delicious but seemed like a very small portion. The texture and creaminess were delightful. Penne alla Vodka - Vodka, Tomatoes, Garlic, Red Chili, Basil, & Cream - YUM! and the Tortellini in Alfredo Sauce, Peas & we asked for the Prosciutto on a separate plate because not everyone would eat that. The server was friendly and attentive, and waitstaff cleared small plates out of the way repeatedly. Water was served in a glass bottle on the table so we could refill easily. The bread on the table was boring, but I didn't eat it anyway because of all the great food. Plates come from the kitchen as they are ready, not all at once, but that is traditional tapas style, and then you know it is hot and fresh. In the end we did not take advantage of the gelato, but had dessert elsewhere. They were able to split our check with 3 different amounts on 3 different credit cards without hesitation. The view from our table was nice too! It's kind of rustic decor, and the servers have jersey-style tops, so that keeps the tone casual, which is good since you have to scream into your neighbor's ear quite a bit. Like I said, that was the only drawback. We also said it was my birthday, and I thought maybe a scoop of gelato with a candle would appear, but it did not. We arrived with 4 and little by little ended up with a table of 7, and they seated us when we were 4, which Chicago does not often do. Originally the reservation was for 8 and we changed it to 6 that morning, and they accommodated that as well. My cousins also took advantage of the valet parking which was quick, but I don't know what it cost them.Here is the WEIRD part - in the ladies room by the sinks is a wall of glass block, which overlooks the mens room. I was in there and thought I saw a male restroom attendant, but my daughter swears when she was in there the attendant was gone and you were looking at the urinals while washing your hands, and a man on the other side looked at her in shock and turned a little away while still trying to ""keep his aim"". Regardless - glass block from one restroom to the other is ODD!"
Ahh Quartino...one of my go to places for large get togethers.  I had my 30th birthday dinner there with a large group and also started off my sisters bachelorette party here and both times people had a great time. I love the small plate concept.  I'm such a fan of trying a bunch of different dishes and Quartino really has something for everyone!  I have tried a good number of dishes and they have been great.A few highlights:-Scallops: I love scallops and they are cooked great here.-Gnocchi - This is a dish that is different everywhere you go.  Their version is top notch.-Pizzas - they have all been good but I don't go here for the pizza-Dates: They are good but I prefer Babareebas-Lasagna al Forno- my friend raved about this dish (I was too stuffed to try it)The wine selection is extensive and I like that they offer different sizes of the wine (1/4 & 1/2 bottles).  I have had their martinis as well and after a couple of those you will have quite a little buzz going!I would recommend making reservations on open table or you could be waiting a while.It is a pretty large restaurant and the tables can be quite close together so getting around is more like going through a maze.  It can get loud and if you are at a long table good luck hearing the people at the other end.  These are just small complaints and would never stop me from coming back.
"I've had the fortune of visiting Quartino a few times.  Took my family and mother here for the first time.  The waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and very pleasant to my young son.  It's always loud, it's always busy, but it's always good.  The pizzas are good and the wine is better!"
"I have passed by this place a million times, but I finally tried it last week.  We sat outside--it's a bit loud with traffic--but great for people watching.  They are expanding the outside patio area, so hopefully it will be completed by the summer.  The waiter told us it's usually an hour wait on Friday and Saturday nights--just a FYI.  We stopped there on a Thursday around 3PM.  The service was friendly and quick.  We ordered the veal sliders--excellent!  The caprese salad, also excellent and very fresh.  We liked the pancetta wrapped dates, but probably wouldn't order again.  We prefer bacon over pancetta, so it's more of a personal preference.  And lastly, we split the Margarita pizza.  It had a very authentic Italian crust, and the sauce was good, but we were expecting fresh slices of mozzarella and I think they shredded it.  Not a big deal.  They seem to have some great deals on wine (which we didn't try) and they have a nice selection of cheeses, meats and olives that I would like to try next time.  It seemed everyone around us ordered them, so it must be popular.  The inside is nicely decorated and the bathroom was sparkly clean and beautiful.  I'll definitely be back."
"I really was disappointed, after reading so many good things about this place on Yelp (as well as having walked passed it many times and thinking it looked cute).  The wine was nothing to write home about. We tried both a white and a red and were disappointed.And while I somewhat enjoyed the shrimp and octopus small plates, I found all the food (even the salad) to be literally DRENCHED in oil. The pizza was nothing worth eating at all - tragic they have so many on their menu.   I will admit one thing - The service was impressive. Or at the very least the expediters were very fast.Maybe this is a great place to come with a group after you've already hit a wine bar - I don't know. It definitely isn't a place I will ever take a date again.Photos will have to be added later."
"2.75 stars.  Decent, but I wasn't overly impressed.  The Italian small plates come in varying sizes but are overall pretty large for small plates.  We had:- Bruschetta:  Decent, good flavors, nothing particularly special- Veal Meatballs Napoli:  served with sweet juicy raisins, the meatballs were actually kind of rubbery, giving it an unpleasant texture- Asparagus Risotta:  Yummy, one of the favorites of the night with a fresh asparagus taste- Polenta Fries:  Interesting but also not memorable; served with a red pepper dipping sauce that was a little too thin- Broccoli Rabe with chili flakes:  Not spicy, and actually quite mushy.  I've never had mushy broccoli rabe before!- Farmhouse chicken:  Overcooked and rubbery- Sea scallops with caper berries:  cooked to an almost perfect medium rare, good flavors, but also nothing special.  There are many much better scallop dishes in other restaurants- Clams with pinot grigio broth:  Warm and delicious, this was another favorite of the night- Roasted Tuscan Sausage:  Very good flavors, and quite a large portion.  This may have been my overall favorite, although it's a toss up with the clamsThe portions are actually quite large for ""small plates"" and the food arrives VERY quickly.  If you're hungry and can get a seat, this is the place to go, although don't expect anything amazing.They also have a pretty decent wine list, which you can order by 1/4L, 1/2L, 1L, or by bottle.  Lot's of Italian wines, of course.  If I came back, I'd probably come for the wine more than the food."
"The food was good, but the service was lackluster.  They try to stuff too many tables in a small space, and we were on a corner, getting bumped by waitstaff and customers.  Our waitress was too preoccupied with other tables, that nearly every part of our order was wrong.  Next time, I would ask for outdoor seating, as it was more calm and spacious."
I loved this place!! The food is incrible!
"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place.  Well, here goes...I'll add to the other 700 on here.  Quartino is hands down my most favorite Italian place in the city.  I love it.  It's not a typical italian joint.  It's great for a few friends to go to and pig out.  We had our company meeting dinner here one night and it was the cheapest bill we'd ever had and we were stuffed to the point of no return.  The wine is great...Sometimes the hostesses are a bit snobbish, but the waiters have always been great and the food...well, I crave it.  It's a little loud inside, but just learn to yell or sit very close and you'll be fine.  If you haven't tried this place, do it.  You're missing out on a Chi gem."
"With so many delicious places to eat in Chicago, I wish I had not wasted my money and stomach space on this restaurant.Don't get me wrong...the food is ok, but definitely nothing special. The restaurant has an Italian tapas style to it. We ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza, the sea scallops, and the pork shank. The pizza was nothing special. The sea scallops were nicely cooked and pretty good, but again nothing memorable. The highlight of the dish was the pork shank. I would definitely recommend getting this entree. The braised shank falls off the bone and literally melts in your mouth. With the potato puree, this entree is worth the money.As for the service, I found our waiter to be pretty rude. He insisted that we order wine and when we refused, he rolled his eyes and walked away from the table in disgust. Definitely didn't leave him a good tip.Overall, Quartino was good, but nothing memorable. Spend your money elsewhere in Chicago!"
love tapas style meals and love italian food - so i had a feeling this place would be a winner. it was crowded but cozy. The best dish we had by far was the mushroom risotto - phenomenal. the sea scallops were delicious as well. for dessert the nutella panino is great if you're a nutella fan. definitely looking forward to dining there again soon!
Stopped in for drinks only.  Good selection of wine.  Nice and friendly wait staff.  Good atmosphere.
"If you like a restaurant that's so loud you can't hear the person next to you, like overpaying for fairly generic Italian. Then try this place out!"
"Loved finding a place with delicious food, great wine, excellent service, a fun atmosphere, and all in River North area that isn't ridiculously priced!  We will be back!Everything we had was good: the pork shank, mushroom risotto, ravioli with bacon, and caprese salad (fresh fresh mozzarella!)"
"What a huge disappointment!!! I have been to one other tapas restaurant (Cafe Babareeba in Lincoln Park) and even though they are different styles of cuisine I had my hopes set high for Quartinos solely because Cafe Babareeba was SO good. But unfortunately all tapas restaurants are not made the same.Prosciutto wrapped dates - yuck! The dates were way too small, couldn't even taste the prosciutto, the honey was extremely overpowering, and the blue cheese only enhanced the sweet flavor. Way too sweet. We were given 6 little portion sizes and could not finish it because of the sweetness. The bacon wrapped dates at Cafe Babareeba were absolutely amazing but these were not even comparable.Grilled baby octopus - another disappointment. Cold, extremely chewy, no flavor. Nothing special at all.Mushroom risotto - this was decent but something that I could easily make at home. Nothing to rave about.Mushroom tomato pizza - this was another extremely sweet dish. I'm not sure if it was from the tomatoes but it was overly sweet. The texture of the mushrooms were just weird. Not good at all. It was a very odd dish, we were just confused about the flavored and textures because they did not play well together.Do yourself a favor and go to Cafe Babareeba, even though it is Spanish tapas and Quartinos is Italian tapas, you will have a MUCH better meal at Cafe Babareeba."
"Nice and approachable upscale italian restaurant.  As you walk on State street, just look for the neon wine bottle.  This restaurant has a large selection of wine, friendly wait staff, and a fun old-school upscale italian vibe.  Definitely check this place out for a group gathering, solo, or for a date night.  A+ for ambiance."
"Service- 5 Stars.  Our server was Rio, and he was great.  I was with some cray-cray friends and he was not at all phased by them.  In fact, he joined in.  Great server!  The ladies fell in love with him.  He was attentive, talkative, and deals well with crazies. :)Food- I liked the Tortellini. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce with the Ravioli (marinara), but the ingredients inside were good.  It might be better with an alfredo sauce.  I really enjoy their cheese.  It is imported from Italy, and you can buy it in the restaurant.  $10/grater.  I bought some to bring home.Parking- They have valet parking for around $11/$12. Prices- We had four people eat well, with left-overs for approximately $70.  We did not order alcohol though."
"Great Italian tapas. Good selection of wines by the glass.The pancetta wrapped dates were memorable. Totally incredulous when the waiter recommended it, but was totally amazed with the juxtaposition of flavors and textures."
"After shopping for a few hours on the Mag Mile, my friend and I were ready to take a break and get something to eat. My friend had been wanting to try this restaurant out for a while so I was happy to check it out with her. When I asked the hostess what the wait would be, she told me the dining room was sold out for the night. Sad face. It was cold, and we were tired so we decided to try our luck at the bar area since it was first come, first served. We spotted a couple in the back corner that appeared to be finishing up and camped out next to them in a polite I'm gonna stare at you and make you uncomfortable until you leave kind of way. Just to lock up the table, I asked them if we could have it when they were finished. Right after I did that, some girl says ""uh, I've been waiting for 30 min"" My response ""ok, well you're not even near the table so if any table opens up does it become yours just because you've been waiting for 30 min?"" Yo Chicago, I don't know how first come first served works in your town, but from where I'm from, the first to grab a table when it opens up gets it regardless if they haven't been waiting the longest. The girl didn't have a rebuttal and another spot opened up so it worked out anyway.  I don't go to a lot of tapas restaurants because I always feel like you end up spending a lot for not very much food. That certainly was not the case here. I'm glad we ordered more conservatively because the portions were big. The menu is fairly extensive but we were able to narrow it down to the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo, Roasted Bone Marrow, Mushroom Risotto, and Caprese salad. Everything was delicious but the bone marrow and mushroom risotto really stood out. They were both perfectly cooked, rich, and full of flavor. Just a heads up, the bone marrow is just 2 bones - perfect for 2 people, may not be enough for a larger party. I really enjoyed this meal.  The service was good. The food came out fast, and everything tasted great. This is definitely a place I'll try again the next time I visit."
"We arrived late and the kitchen was closed, and they re-opened it just for us. The ambiance is very charming, yet airy. They really went out of their way to bring in building materials from buildings demolished here and in Europe. And, above all, the service and pizza and pasta were fabu!"
"Great for a casual client dinner. We sampled at least 20 different dishes and there was something for everyone's taste; which took the pressure off choosing a place for client's when you don't really know their food preferences. It's very busy so quiet conversation wasn't an option but the energy was great, the wait staff attentive and very knowledgeable. Between drinks, apps, entrees and dessert the bill was only $150 for the three of us.  I will definitely go back here the next time I have business in Chicago!"
"We came in for dinner before our bachelorette festivities began, and the food was AMAZING. So good, and at super reasonable prices. Our pizza took a bit longer, but our waiter made it up to us with a free plate of pasta, and when a nearby couple sent a dessert to our table, he um . . . artfully arranged it to reflect the bachelorette theme. I will definitely be hitting up Quartino the next time I'm in the city!"
Made reservations - but when we arrived short one guest we had to wait until they arrived before we could be seated.  Ugh - annoying.Sangria was amazing - and very well priced.  We spilled one and our server comped it.Onto the food - it was good. We bought a bunch of small plates.  Some of the plates were awkward for sharing.  Bill was much higher than I expected for what I ordered.
"Tapas which are cold, tough and clearly not Spanish - not that they advertise it to be, but they need not call it tapas either. Anyways - terrible food. They only get the footfall because they are in the middle of everything. The pasta was soggy. Salumi plate bad to say the least. $100 down the gutter."
"There are few things in the world that I love LOVE love. $4 glasses of red wine are one of them. Quartino's is the ideal place to order a carafe of red wine (SO CHEAP!) and split a few dishes. Things I've had and liked: arrabiata pasta, calamari (though the sauce is a little weak) and the quattro formaggi pizza. Quartino's should easily be one of your go-to places for dinner with the girls, great wine, family style dishes, reasonable prices and great ambiance. The black and white films playing in the background are adorable and, awkwardly, the bathrooms are gorgeous."
"The environment is probably better suited for a group looking for a fun night out, not date night.  Not quite the intimate setting I was looking for.Went here yesterday, wanted to do something nice before going to a show.  I made reservations ahead of time, however I should have noted it was a special occasion.  I thought by how dressed up we were that maybe the hostess would have noticed and given us a more ""private table"", but we were sat next to the main aisle in a rather empty dining room.  At first the service wasn't great, Hostess seemed a bit cold and I had to flag someone down just to get some water after 10 min of waiting.  But after that, no real complaints.Dirty Martini was ok, the blue cheese olives didn't taste fresh, they had a weird taste to them.  Prosciutto wrapped dates were amazing, best part of the meal.  Split a beef filet, the kitchen actually made them to two different temps.  I wasn't expecting this, so it was a really nice thing they would accommodate.  They even told us which was which.   This is great bc my BF and I do not share the same opinion on how meat should be cooked (medium rare obviously).Our other two dishes weren't bad, they just weren't all that great.  The gnocchi was fresh, but was not a fan of the pesto sauce and veggies it was served with.  The Soprano Pizze was really good, I just didn't realize they use fennel in the giardiniera.  We specifically avoided the Italian Sausage so we wouldn't have to taste fennel, but by no means is that the restaurant's fault. I would come back, but only as a group or if someone else chose the place.  Or just to get those dates...holy hell are they good."
"Visited with a work group last week. We sat outside and we did family style, all ordering something and sharing around. Every dish was very tasty, fresh and traditional Italian. The atomosphere was great - this place has been around a long time and the decor (when I made it inside) was amazing - the bar area, the marble, the wood - all very impressive. My only critique might be that some of the portions were on the small side for some of the dishes, but overall the experience was quite good, and I would recommend this to others."
"We were visiting from out of town and we were able to get a reservation, despite being somewhat last minute.  We were a little late geting there and had a bit of a wait before getting seated.  We weren't going to complain, it was obvious that the place was popular, but during our meal they apologized for the wait and comp'd our desert (which was totally unnecessary, but a nice gesture).  The food was very good - the duck carpaccio was unbelievable and is a must have.  The osso buco was very good (and very large).  The deserts also were very good.  I was very impressed."
"Quartino is my ""go to"" place when friends are visiting town. The menu is broad (the fresh pastas are my favorite) and small plates encourage sharing and tasting. Nice decor, but the room can get loud. Excellent service. Wine prices are reasonable, so in the end, you eat well, have fun and the value is outstanding. There may be better Italian restaurants, but we always go home happy from Quartino. Tip: you can buy bottles of wine for take out at the bar."
"Cozy, great atmosphere.  Food is good!"
"awesome for people watching, a nice hot crowd here loves the tapas and the wine that is priced very well for this neighborhood. Was just there for the wine tasting last night. They do this every month on the last wednesday of the month where for $20 bucks they give you some assortment of veggies, italian bread light appetizers and most importantly pizza. You can see that upper layers of mamangement has been working on this because from when i went back in August they increased the quality of the pizza and the frequency that they brought out the pizza has been increased...Aweosme I will go back even if it is not for the wine tasting."
"Decent, if somewhat mainstream American-Italian food. I think they probably consider themselves an upscale Maggiano's and it is, to the extent that it attracts A LOT of tourists and suburbanites, particularly on the weekends. It's always packed. I've been here twice, out of necessity. The first time was because a friend and I were hungry and we happened to be passing by. The second time was for our office Christmas party. Our buffet was really cold, even for dishes that weren't supposed to be. I thought the pasta was very mediocre. The pizza is decent. Overall, it's fine but they're just too crowded for it to be an enjoyable place to go. It's fine if you're starving but otherwise, there are lots of better places to go."
"I've been here a few more times, update on food tried:Shrimp- delicious, a good portion size with lemon and garlicwhite bean and garlic spread- bland, would not recommend thisspinach salad- ok, nothing specialRomaine hearts salad- nice light dress, parmesan cheese was good on topPaparadelle with braised beef- favorite, the homemade pasta is outstanding and the sauce is super tastyMushroom pizza- I like how thin this pizza is, but the mushroom topping wasn't very flavorfulVeal meatballs- both of us didn't like this, the meatball itself was dry inside and needed more spices, but the sauce outside was good.On a weekend night the atmosphere is loud and bustling (make sure you make a reservation!)"
"I loved how everything was so simple yet fresh and delicious, and beautifully presented.  Some slices of their cured meat (I got the Prosciutto di Parma) and their cheeses (I got the Asiago) are a must- great sides to go with it.  The veal meatballs were delicious (came out hot, moist, and tender).  Also got the Roasted Baby Octopus (nicely grilled, but large legs of the octopus), Polenta Fries (decent but a little dry), and their Spaghetti alla Arabbiatta which was delicious.Got the Panino Limone for dessert- gorgeous presentation, liked the ice cream inside more than anything else.  Great place to go with a group of friends."
"I am a fan of the ambience but the food we ordered did not really wow me. As many of the reviewers have pointed out, Quartino has a very laid-back marketplace vibe while managing to be still classy. The first time I went there was for a late-night gathering with chocolate fondue, wine, olives and cheese. I really enjoyed the dining experience, and under pressure of a friend of mine,  I decided to return for a lunch date on the Sunday after St. Patricks. We had:- duck salami: I had nothing like this before and thought it was very flavorful. The right amount of fat made it extra yummy and the portion was perfect. - veal meatballs: I really did not enjoy this dish but being a rare red meat eater, my opinion is less relevant here. To be fair, the sauce was delish.- spinach pizza: we were in awe when we saw that the spinach was not baked into the pizza. Rather, it was fresh, slightly-dressed spinach - a lot of them - layered on top of the perfect crust with perfect amount of cheese and sauce. I loved it and I am sure I will love the other pizzas as well. - penne alla vodka: can't say no to anything that has the word vodka in it. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought but it was still good. Not too rich and not too light.- calamari: have had better. Overall I still enjoyed the experience and I will go back for more pizzas."
Quartino has some of the best Italian food in downtown Chicago. Be sure to make a reservation though because it is always packed.
"This place has definitely gone down over the years.I came here with a girlfriend for a Monday night casual dinner.  It has an amazing patio and its a scene for sure.  However, the scene and energy could not take away from the terrible food.- Wine is plentiful and abundance.  The bottle of sauvignon blanc we had was tasty and refreshing.- Polenta Fries: Meh! I love polenta fries, and these were just not good at all. Some fries were overcooked, and some under.- Eggplant parmesan: Nothing memorable, and had a canned taste to it.- Cavatelli: Again, slapping on some cheese won't hide the poor flavor.I had very fond memories of this place when I used to live here.  There is a crowd, so not the best place to have an intimate dinner.  However, the only thing that holds this place up was the wine list, because the food was quite unfortunate."
"I was in Chicago over the weekend visiting family and this was the place we went for dinner on Saturday night. We had heard good things about it and decided to see for ourselves. First of all, make reservations. This place was packed. Even with reservations it still took a few minutes to seat four adults (and my young grandson), but that's OK. Crappy restaurants aren't crowded, so that's actually a good sign. If you're driving, use the valet service. It isn't much, about 12 bucks and it was worth it. There's really no public parking around, especially during Christmas shopping season. Cab fare would have been higher and would have been a double expense to and from, we had the baby as well, so valet was the right choice for us.We were seated and met by Alyssia, our server. She immediately established that it was our first visit and explained how the tapas/small plate style worked. She went over the menu and took our drink orders. Within minutes, drinks were served. She even brought an extra wine glass in case I changed my mind (I rarely drink). Alyssia answered several questions about different dishes and once we decided, she was off and running. First to arrive were the veal meatball sliders. Big hefty meatballs, I'd guess about 1 1/2 to 2 oz each, on small buns with pomodoro sauce and giardiniera. There was a cheese on there as well but I'm not sure what type, didn't ask. Veal was very tasty, could have used a little more seasoning for me, but it was very good still. Within a few minutes, and the next dish was dates wrapped in pancetta, stuffed with Gorgonzola Dolce & drizzled with honey. Holy cow, that was wonderful. The sweet and the savory of the gorgonzola with the sweet of the honey and the pancetta just can't be described, you simply have to try it. Everyone loved them and we seriously thought about ordering more but there was so much more food coming, we reluctantly passed. Next up was the Pappardelle al sugo di manzo, beef with pappardelle pasta in a tomato sauce. Very good and filling, little bit of heat on the back end. Just right for a chilly night.Next, the only low note of the evening. The rest of the group wanted a pizza, I wanted some veggies. We settled on Quattro Stagioni, a pizza with marinated artichokes, portobellos, roasted peppers, zucchini, and grana. I had asked Alyssia if I could get some of the same veggies on the side for me, she said sure, no problem. Well, the kitchen goofed it up and put all the veggies on the side and none on the pizza, so we basically had a cheese pizza. Most of the food was being delivered by a different server each time, so when Alyssia came around and saw what had happened, she disappeared for a moment and when she returned, told us that she had taken care of it and taken the pizza off our bill. Now that's damn good service!Last up was gnocchi. I have to admit, I didn't try it; I was nearing my limit by this time. It's made with green beans, potatoes, arugula, pesto and pork stock; it's not your average gnocchi. But everyone else loved it. Alyssia came around with the dessert menu. She let on that there was tiramisu that wasn't on the menu. I was trying to be good, my wife and I were going to split a dessert, a Panino al Gelato Limone, a lemon cream gelato sandwich with lemon curd, and whipped cream. The others had ordered a Nutella Panino, which is just what it sounds like, toasted panini with nutella. What I had missed was a wink and a nudge between my wife and Alyssia, the next thing I know we had the lemon panino, the nutella panino and the tiramisu. To top it all off, Alyssia said that she'd seen how I had perked up at  the mention of tiramisu, even though she had already scrubbed the pizza, she wanted us to be completely happy, she comped all three desserts! Is that awesome or what? Besides being a top notch server, hustling back and forth all evening as well as waiting several other tables, Alyssia really knocked it out of the park that night. Friendly, cheerful, and absolutely has the diners interest at heart, she made the night for us. My son picked up the tab for the meal and was certainly generous to Alyssia for her service and I gave her a little extra on the side as well. She certainly earned it; we also gave her an attaboy with her manager before leaving. I hope they darn well appreciate what they have in her. Overall, the food was outstanding. Everything was nicely done, the veal was moist and a good starting point, the pancetta dates were killer; the pappardelle was delicious, little hiccup on the pizza and veggies but it was saved by outstanding service. BTW, the veggies were great, should have got more of those as well. Gnocchi was super by all accounts. I can personally attest to to the tiramisu and the lemon panino as being worth the trip all by themselves. A wonderful meal and service that can't be beat anywhere. Very much looking forward to returning."
"I've been here a few times but I think this will be my last. We've always been just after Christmas and the place is always packed. I would NEVER wait 2 hours for this restaurant so we always end up in the bar. It's a fun atmosphere but really crowded and noisy--really more of a young person's place.I'm the type of person more interested in the food than the crowd and the food is just average. Nothing has ever been bad but nothing has been fantastic either. Last time we had the marrow, which was very good but they seemed to have taken that off the menu. This time I had the duck prosciutto pizza with arugula. The duck prosciutto is really good but there wasn't very much of it on the pizza. In my head I was expecting a white sauce and some cheese on it but maybe I didn't read the menu well enough because it was a red sauce, which just didn't work. It would be a great pizza if they put more imagination into it. As it was, it just tomato sauce on pizza dough with a bunch of arugula on top. My husband had linguini and clam sauce--pretty spicy--but not outstanding.One big negative besides the average food is that nothing comes out of the kitchen together. I know this is supposed to be family style but I personally think it's the mark of a weak kitchen staff that there is so much time in between dishes. I mean, the small bowl of linguini and clams really isn't a sharing type of dish."
The Steamed Clams were amazing!
"I ate here again recently and heading in remembered the place being very average. I have to say that my previous review was spot on. I'll restate, Quartino can best be described as a great value. The food isn't the best but you really can't complain about the prices. My problem is that I don't enjoy eating at places that are great values. I love eating at restaurants that blow me away with flavorful food.I ate here with my larger family and the 7 of us each picked 2 dishes. That's 14 different items from the menu so we sampled much of what Quartino has to offer. The stars of the group were the braised pork shank and the pappardelle with beef ragu. Everything else was average at best and I can't even remember most of them having eaten here less than a week ago.There's much better Italian in this city but for some reason this place fills to capacity by 6 PM on a Friday. Either they are doing something right or they have one hell of a location. I'll still head elsewhere."
"Great atmosphere very energetic crowd,very loud. I really thought the food was average at best. Love the small plate concept but everything was pretty bland. Calamari very tender,marinara sauce watery,cold and tasteless. Pizza bland and very doughy. Service also really lacking. I would not choose to go back,so many other great Italian restaurants in Chicago."
"The service at Quartino was unparalleled! The maitre d was really considerate, and reduced our 45 minute wait time because of my crutches. Everything on the menu sounded worth trying. It was pretty easy for three people with different dietary restrictions--gluten free, carnivore, vegetarian--to share a spectacular meal. I actually ate the tomatoes in my Caprese salad :) It's pretty tight and loud. My throat was sore the rest of the night from ""yelling"" at my friends."
"My friends and I had 4 dishes, a pizza, baby spinach salad Gnocchi, and Tuscan Sausage Risotto.Pizza was good but not special. Baby spinach salad was not that good because it was bland, or you can say healthy...But Gnocchi and Sausage Risotto were great. I don't have Italian food often so for me they were amazing. There was a familiar flavor in our Risotto. It tasted like some Asian food. I don't know what it is but I really like it.Gnocchi didn't have strong flavor but with some fresh veggie smell and tasted well.It was a good restaurant if you don't have to wait for a long time!"
"Quartino's never disappoints. I know this because between probably to 100 times I have been here, I have probably ordered, tasted, or seen someone order almost every item on the menu.  The upstairs is great for big group events.  In the summer, I love to sit out on the second floor patio or even in front of the restaurant right on the corner of the street.  Strangely, my favorite item here is their chicken soup.  That is never what I expected it to be for an italian restaurant but it really does beat out everything else for me.  Their shrimp risotto is delicious and another favorite.  The pizzas are very big and we almost always have one on the table.  Overall, if youre looking for casual italian that is much better than the olive garden but not quite up to par with italy itself, this is a great median."
"Good food for the price, very inexpensive for downtown Chicago.  But, the absolute LOUDEST restaurant, by far, I've ever been to. Almost impossible to hear the server or have a conversation."
"Love love love.  Small portions, fresh ingredients, food comes out fast. We were able to order a few things to share to start and just kept ordering as we pleased. Went here twice within 24 hours."
"Lovely atmosphere, great wines that come by the carafe. I wanted to like this place and could tell that for many it is a neighborhood staple, but frankly was not impressed by the food. In my opinion, the food was a bland, and the concept of Italian tapas didn't work for me. If you go, go for the atmosphere!"
"The service was good. We had reservation beforehand and arrived with a full house. Waited almost 20 minutes past our reservation time, which raises a red flag.Food was ver mediocre. I can see how it can be a good experience for a family with children. The portion was very good but the flavors were far from thoughtful and satisfaction.The shrimp risotto was decent but slightly over-salted. The pork ravioli had rich shredded pork in there topped by greasy prosciutto type of bacon. great/salty on grease salty, not a good combo. Scallops were overcooked and rubbery. Pizza crust was fine but toppings were again flavorless.Our last dish didn't make it, which was good much to our relief. The server was very nice to offer a tiramisu for us to share. The dessert turned out to be the relatively best dish out of all. Overall, disappointing. More of a tourist spot than anything."
"quartino. oh, quartino. believe the hundreds of 5 star ratings. this place is absolutely a gem. it's family-style tapas so it's perfect when you want to order a bunch of different things to sample but don't wanna have to be carted out.  we came here at 6pm on a friday night and literally every single corner of the place was occupied. our waitress for the night was yet another wonderfully sweet chicago native who made some awesome recommendations which we wholeheartedly accepted:-salumeria tasting: duck proscuitto, proscuitto de parma, taleggio, fontina, roasted peppers, roasted beet salad, and artichoke campobasso. everything was excellent!-veal meatball slider. it wasn't gamey at all and the meat juice dribbling down my wrist was indication of how juicy it was. -house made cavatelli: GET THIS! i really don't like ricotta (or any cheese for that matter) but i could not stop eating this dish. the ricotta was unlike any cheese i've ever tried before. the pasta, perfect. there's something so different about fresh house made pasta. the tomatoes were tangy yet sweet and the fresh peppery basil really tied the dish together. my favorite.-villa antinori for me: a full red, it was the perfect pairing for all the different dishes we tried. i almost hugged the waitress for recommending this one for me-founders centennial ipa for bf. i didn't try any but apparently it was very very good. (fyi: a local beer so an additional plus!)the boisterous laughter, loud chatter, bustling wait staff, clinking of wine glasses, clatter of empty plates being stacked...all sounds of a restaurant with amazing food, great drinks, and memorable moments."
Awesome food! Great Service! Never Ever disappoints!
"Quartino's has a really good pizzas but it can get loud.  I was with a group trying to have  working dinner and it was hard to hear because it can be very very loud. Otherwise, everything was great. The food and service is very good and the location can't be beat.  I would totally go back, but under the pretenses that what the other person is saying doesn't matter :)"
"I heart Quartino! I've been here several times and this is my go-to spot for almost any occasion. Wine and dine me on a date, get a big group together, or a business dinner/lunch. All a perfect time with excellent food. Italian is generally a ""safe"" choice for even the pickiest eaters and this place has something for everyone and any kind of dietary restriction. Expect a rowdy, bustling atmosphere packed w/ a lot of people having a great time. Great location in the heart of the city.Definitely order a pizza. Wood fired goodness. Maybe you should get two if you are in a big group. Wait, wait, wait. What am I doing?! Let's start over.... ORDER RED WINE BY THE BOTTLE. LOTS OF IT. Then think about food. So yeah, get a pizza or two... eggplant parm was cheesy good. VEAL MEATBALLS were to die for. Shrimp cooked to perfection; pasta w/ broccoli super rich (my bff's fav), mushroom risotto earthly satisfying.... there was more. So much more.... I just can't remember everything but nothing I tried was ever bad or short of impressive. If you haven't been, you are definitely missing out. And if you like this place as much as me, try Davanti Enoteca off Taylor St. in Little Italy for another fantastic, unique take on Italian small plates."
"Good food I love the carpaccio, fresh ingredients, service is usually pretty good.  I love that they offer their restaurant for fundraising events.   The house red wine is always a good choice"
"The ambience is fantastic, and the date appetizer was one of our favorites."
"I had dinner here with some business associates last Friday.Its busy and loud as to be expected for a family style Italian restaurant, pizza was disappointing but i found the gnocchi quite good.  service is quick but a bit frantic, i had a busboy actually push me out of the way as he ran for a table.definitely noisy but I will be back I am sure."
"Seems like we are the first customers that were not fully satisfied. Quartino is a nice restaurant, our waitress was very attentive and helpful. The food however lacked taste so that I can rate this place max as average. Hopefully they just had a bad day?"
"Fantastic. Everything was delicious, the service was great, and the price actually decent."
"Not sure why people think this place is so great.  First, the service is poor and expect to wait because this place gets crowed and apparently they don't manage their reservations very well.  The two meals I've had here were very mediocre.  The dishes all come out at different times which is really annoying and some of the plates are tiny.  You end up ordering more food throughout the meal because the dishes are so small.  This would be acceptable if the food was good, but its not.  I don't think I tried anything that I couldn't make as good or better myself.I also came here once with some friends for the wine night.  When we showed up the place was mobbed, no seating, no one organizing the event, it just seemed like a free for all.  The food that was included looked average at best.  We ended up leaving."
My favorite restaurant in the city!!!
"I was just here last month after seeing Lookingglass Alice at the Looking Glass theater. They have seating outside and inside. It was too warm to sit outside, but man...this place was pretty fun, inside and out! We were seated pretty promptly even without reservations. We ordered the Margherita pizza since we both love that pizza and we asked the waitress for a recommendation for a red wine if she had any. She said the Bacca Rossa was good so we got a bottle of that. I think the full bottle was 30 or less, but I'm not sure. The pizza was amazing and I have always loved the margherita so we enjoyed it and the bacca rossa paired really well with the pizza. We finished the whole bottle between the two of us. It was a light wine which is not really dry so if you are the type that likes dry wine, then this one's not for you. For desert we had the gran coppa quartino and oh boy was it gran! we devoured that in the matter of minutes because I love deserts. It had the vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate gelati with real strawberries and a biscotti topped off by roasted hazelnuts and whipped cream. It was a really good desert. I can see myself coming back to this amazing place maybe next summer since I really want to be seated outdoors. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves their pizza, wine, and desserts (of course I love the all three!)."
"A coworker and I were in town for business, so we walked here from our downtown hotel on a Tuesday night around 7 pm for dinner. As an avid Yelper, I was hesitant at first because many other reviews say the quality and ambiance has taken a turn for the worst in late years. However, a former Chicagoan with good taste recommended it, so I took her word and needless to say, it was a great dining experience! We were seated shortly after arriving, the wine options were great, the fondue cheese was phenomenal, as was our charming server. And when a busgirl accidentally knocked a glass bottle of olive oil onto the floor, splashing it on my coat, the restaurant manager approached me with a sincere apology and his business card to either dry clean or purchase new. If you're visiting Chicago and staying downtown, put Quartino on your short list."
While I visited Chicago for the 2nd time recently a friend who lived nearby recommended Quartino. I found the food to be pretty decent. Honestly - nothing impressive but a solid italian meal. I had the alfredo and it was very tasty. This is a solid restaurant but don't expect a blow away meal.
"I came here with a friend for an early dinner. We didnt make any reservations but were seated immediately upon arrival. Our server attended to us quickly and was very friendly. We ordered the calamari, linguini with clams, tortellini, penne alla vodka, and asparagus with risotto. Everything tasted delicious and the calamari appetizers came out quickly! I love how you can order a half size dish or a full size dish. The half size dish was more than enough for me! I had no room for dessert but I made room for dessert! We ordered the profiteroles (comes with 2) and the zeppole.  Both were delicious and the zeppole was freshly fried. Very yummie!! We both ordered drinks. My friend ordered a white wine and I ordered my signature midori sour. Unfortunately the midori sour I ordered was extremely sour!!! I was told it was because they use fresh lemon juice. Our server was extremely nice and had my drink remade when I asked for more syrup in the drink.  Even after it was remade, it was still too sour for me. Our waiter saw that I barely touched the drink and offered to take the drink off our bill. What outstanding customer service!!Valet parking was quick and easy. Cost is about $10. By around 6:45pm the restaurant was completely full. If you decide to eat here, make sure to go before the rush."
"Yah. Excellent. Came here last year when visiting. Came back this year. All dishes we had were excellent. Sat outside on a busy, warm summer night. The music of the streets serenaded us all night. If you don't like that, eat inside.  We had arugula salad, spinach and mushroom pizza, asparagus risotto, veal skirt steak and a couple of other things plus dessert. 3 people stuffed. Really a wonderful experience. Loved our waiter, John."
"I don't usually like going out for Italian food, but went here for Fathers Day, since it was my Dad's choice and I can't wait to go back. This place is tapas style Italian. My husband and I shared a flat bread sausage pizza along with Risotto. The flavors of the food were so good. For dessert, we shared the Zeppole which are Italian Doughnuts with Honey and Dark Chocolate. We had a party of 10, so the amount of food being passed and eaten at our table was endless. I just stuck to my two entree selections and dessert and I was satisfied. I didn't want to share my choices because they were so good. I hope to be back here again soon. Great for large parties....this place was packed, so be sure to make a reservation."
"I really enjoyed the restaurant - staff is engaging and cute (!), and it's in the midst of a number of weekend destination spots.  While I enjoyed the pizza, I did not love the other items we ordered.  Veal meatballs - served in a raisin sauce - just didn't have a lot of flavor.  Polenta fries were perfectly fried, but I prefer the inclusion of parmesan in the fry, and again, it didn't have flavor (salt definitely helped the cause).  Finally, the bacon wrapped dates - not sure why it turned out that way.  In any case, the bartender was SUPER nice and gave me a promotion card for a future visit - which i will use because the mushroom and arugula pizza was really good!  I am also a fan of the 1/2 liter wine option.  It was Sunday Funday and a perfect way to start the lunch occasion.  So I will return - for the wine and the pizza."
"I enjoy Quartinos. Good (not mind-blowing) food, fun atmosphere (pretty loud though), and great service. The thin crust pizzas here are definitely my favorite thing about this place, reminds me of my time in NYC. I've had a lot of the other dishes here as well and they were all solid, but nothing really blew me away. Great thing is that food comes out fast."
"Quartino is an ideal concept for the River North ""visitors' center"" -- good enough food, bustling vibe, cute décor and a gloss of rustic urban sophistication likely to leave tourists and suburbanites favorably impressed. I had no complaints on this first visit (save the noise level, which made conversation and communication with the server a challenge). There's a good selection of small plates, with something likely to please every taste. The wine list is commendable in its approachability, variety and portion options. Our server was cordial and helpful, even suggesting that we cut our order down a bit if we didn't want leftovers.We liked a salad of Brussels sprout leaves with apples. Garganelli con Ragu D'Agnello was tasty, though the pasta was chewy (perhaps par-cooked in advance?). Beef fillet with broccoli rabe was pleasant, though the broccoli rabe was overcooked. An arugula pizza was tasty (very nice arugula in a bountiful layer), though the crust was not really what I've come to think of as Neopolitan -- it was crisp, but thicker and not crackly like ""real"" pizza Napoli.All in all, Quartino does a lot of things right and is a decent value. As a spot for a pleasant pre-show dinner, though, it's too noisy for me..."
"No idea why it's taken me this long to write a review. Quartino is hands down the best place to bring a group. It's affordable, the food is fresh and great, the staff if knowledgeable and incredibly accommodating.  The group of 13 I took there last night left happily wined and dined without spending too much cash. Definitely make a reservation; I've never been in there (even after work on a Tuesday night) when it's not packed. It's also gluten-free friendly (a separate menu!)."
"I'm giving this five stars based on two things:1.  Veal meatball sliders2.  Our waiter, Ryan.We were a table of 6, having a mini high school reunion 26 years later.  Clearly I drank too much wine to strongly review all the plates that followed the slider but Ryan kept that party going, for nearly 5 hours.Just a great place to share wine and plates with friends."
"This is the kind of restaurant that makes me wish I lived in Chicago. If not for the very cold and deep winters I'd likely give it a try. I really enjoyed my dinner here and quite frankly could find nothing negative to say about the meal.The service was great from the hostess stand to the table and even the ladies room attendant. The food was great! The Grapefruitini made for a nice start to the meal. My husband and I ordered a number of small plates and were particularly impressed with the Braised Pork. It literally fell off the bone and my husband was found picking every last morsel off the bone when our waitress came to pick up the last of our plates.The atmosphere was lively and the overall experience very authentic. Definitely arrive WITH a reservation. If you still have to wait a few minutes, it will be worth it.Enjoy!"
"Made reservations less than a week out for a group of 16 through open table (which was very convenient). The food was delicious as it always it. We had a fantastic server who worked with me to order for the table and made everything very easy, which is rarely is for a group of 16. He even warned me that the bottle of jack that I wanted to order for the table would run about $400. Can't ask for more honesty than that in a server. I have been here for several events over the last couple of years and they always do a good job of accommodating. I was a little disappointed that the manager, who I had met before, didn't come stop by the table to say hello after telling me he would when I entered. Didn't ruin the experience of course, but that is what kept me from giving the 5 star rating."
"I've been here several times now. It's a great place for just about any occasion, special occasion, quick dinner, girls night, date, birthday party, whatever. The restaurant is kind of huge, 2 floors, always bustling with people, loud, kind of a market vibe-y, and they always play old school Italian flicks on the TVs (thanks!).They serve small plate style so the bill racks up quickly, but the food is so delish. The pizza is a favorite. It is thin crust and they let you order half and half, and can also substitute ingredients. For example, we usually order half rustica and half fumo negli ochi with arugula instead of spinach.. try it seriously. The pork belly with apple compote is really tasty. All of the risotto dishes are great, overpriced though. The eggplant parm is a must. Last time we tried the roasted bone marrow which was nothing special at all, too much breading. The wine list is really nice and they always have suggestions. I would not recommend the sangria here (go to Cafe Iberico if you want Sangria). The gelato dessert is yummy.The service can be inconsistent, it just depends on the night and who you get. We went on St. Patty's Day, and our waiter with the silly curled-up mustache was in a grumpy mood and only visited us twice :( But we've also been when the waiter was super friendly and cracking jokes :) Sit outside in the summer and always shoot for the first floor instead of second floor. OH also, I wish they had Parmesan cheese on the table at all times. They give you bread and olive oil and a mysterious white container with mostly Italian writing... so you just assume it is cheese when it's actually sea salt, and then you learn the hard way. You have to ask for cheese and it's in a twisty grater container."
Pretty good selection of fresh food. Smaller plates meant for sharing.  Took awhile to get seated even though we came at off peak hourse. Friendly staff.
"Quartino is a favorite of ours.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  I am never disappointed!  Everytime we have visitors in town, we take them here.  My favorite plates are the scallops, octopus, sausage risotto and the gnocchi to name a few.  Their meats and cheeses are amazing as well as their pizza.  They have a great wine selection.  Their limocello is awesome!  The service is always wonderful.  It is always loud and lively, which adds to the experience for sure.  I cannot wait to go back!"
"Good food, large seating capacity so you can always get in!"
"Came here twice and liked the selections of wines and cheeses.  We got the Margarita Pizza and loved it!  I know there are alot more pure italian restaurants to visit in Chicago, but this one is one of my favorites."
"Perfect summer time place for light food and great wines.  I have to say the concept of italian tapas is great! I am not a huge fan of loading up on the carbs so when this place opened I was the first to check it out and have been coming back ever since.  They are always busy and I am still waiting for a chance to get a table outside!  My favorites would have to be the bruchettas and polenta fries.  Nothing can top the crisp fries with the roasted red pepper sauce.  Just typing about is making me crave it and stop by soon! The mushroom risotto is the perfect touch of creamy and the scallops were cooked perfectly when we ordered them.  The calamari was good too...not chewy like many places.I wouldn't say that the pizza is my fav though. It is average pizza. I would have to say in comparison to La Madia and Osteria Via Stato it doesn't stand up.  This joint is a great date night, girls night or group night, all in all I love the food and the atmosphere."
"This is my favorite place to eat in Chicago! It's very group-oriented. All the dishes are meant to share. The pizza is the best! I love thin crust and it is absolutely delicious. They have a fantastic wine selection. And the desserts--oh my! The last time I went there everyone at my table got something different and there honestly wasn't a favorite. It was all terrific. I also love the black and white movies they play.The service can be hit or miss. The place gets pretty packed at night and you can barely get out of your chair without bumping into someone. This is the only reason I give the place four stars. I feel they could take about five tables out the main room to make it more comfortable, but I understand why they wouldn't. Having said this, I have never waited more than 30 minutes for a table. I highly recommend making reservations though.Just a tip, they have a person in the bathroom to pamper you. Bring a couple bucks with you when you need to go. I'm not even in a relationship, but I want my wedding reception here. I take everyone that comes to visit me to this place and it's always a great time, whether it's just me and another person or a huge group."
"Yelpers never lead me wrong.  Found myself on an impromptu vaca in Chitown and looked for the highly rated spots. Loved this one!  Ordered 3 small plates: white bean garlic spread, meatball sliders & garlic bread, everything was delicious and I loved the vibe at this corner restaurant off the beaten path (but not very far.)My group would have loved to come back for dinner, but we had too many more spots to hit. I'll definitely be back on my next trip!Thanks Quartino!"
We walked into the restaurant and the waiting area on a friday night at 9pm was PACKED. We were all shoved around and it was really uncomfortable. The bar area was empty so I don't know why they don't push people in that direction. Once we got out of that mess we found 2 seats at the bar and didn't mind the wait time (about 15 minutes). The menu is a sharing menu so we ordered several dishes for the table. Everything was delicious and full of flavor. I wish we had room for dessert because their dessert menu was superb. Maybe next time.
"My go-to place for after work dinner downtown. Great service! I have eaten most things on the menu. Veal meatballs, orichetti pasta and their cheese plates and  pizza. Don't skip dessert here!"
"fun & deliciousthe little sheet they give you to check off what cheeses and accoutrements you'd like is too cute. i love taking large groups of people here. we can order anything and everything on the menu. start with a appetizer pizza then move onto sharing lots of pasta dishes. a lite salad to follow and you cannot miss fondue chocolate dessert. i always get the ovieto bottle of wine. it is crisp, refreshing, cheap and fantastic. shame on me, i haven't been since they opened the new patio upstairs. you really cannot beat Chicago in the summer and i can't think of a better place to get evening started than outdoors at quartino.see you soon amici!"
"Quartino is an amazing restaurant.The food is as good as it gets for someone who knows his food; but isn't quite a critic.However, the service is amazing. The staff, all around, was amazingly genial. We saw many larger parties, accommodated very well. I would recommend this place for non-food snobs who are looking to have a great time."
"5 girls, lots of wine, small plates. I'm in love!Quartino was delish!Polenta Fries = whoaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Very good!Calamari = out of this world!Chilled Aspargus = pretty good, who woulda thunk that I'd like egg salsa? Asparagus Risotto = yeah, that's the ticket!Quattro Formaggi pizza = ehhhh, me thinks notHot Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Gelato = probably one of the best things I've ever put in my mouthWe also had an antipasto plate (olives, meat, cheese, bread, and some other random stuff) = so friggen good!I'll FOR SURE be back!"
"Hmm, I don't get the hype.  I read most of the reviews and came here expecting amazing dishes.  After checking into our hotel, we arrived around on a Monday afternoon.  We were seated promptly outside and although it's a great atmosphere, it felt a bit too crowded.We ordered the Margherite Pizza and a pasta (I forget which).  The pasta was way too salty, we didn't end up finishing it.  The pizza was... acceptable - I wouldn't go back for it again.  To be honest, nothing was really special.  I think the only thing I can say that I liked about it was the decor, ambiance, and the outside patio.  Meh."
"I totally dig it. And if you get a chance, go before the end of September and ASK for the $35 dinner for two menu. It's literally an app, a pasta, an entree, and a dessert for $35 TOTAL. No better deal for the quality.It gets super packed at about 7:30, so try to get in before if you don't want to be part of the pandemonium. That's also the only reason I may not suggest it for date night (loud!).Great wines and Italian small plates. Another bonus? They let you do ""half orders"" of the pastas so you can try more than one. The only thing I didn't care for was the fatty short ribs. Other than that, everything else was tasty and portioned nicely. Note that if you don't do the dinner-for-two, everything you order will come out at once/as it's done...it's not coursed/paced."
"I know you can be overwhelmed, and I know you can be underwhelmed... but can you ever just be ""whelmed""?  That's how I feel about this place.  Sure, it's Italian, so you can't really go wrong, but I just didn't think it was that great.  The more concerning thing was how LOUD it was.  I could hardly hear my sister talk.  Our food was all fine.  We liked a pasta that had some pulled beef in it, and our pizza was okay too, but nothing blew our minds.  It's very crowded.  To be honest, I doubt I'll go again -- probably hit up a Francesca's or a spot in Old Town instead."
"Great Italian food, perfect for sharing at a reasonable price! Nothing mind blowing, but pretty good. Good spot to go with friends and share."
"If you're looking for a late night spot where you can get good food and not have to resort to the usual diner plate of burgers and fries, then you've found it in Quartino. (TIP: Valet parking is 12 dollars)My boyfriend and I are visiting Chicago for the week and found this place because of its close proximity to our hotel. The first thing I must commend Quartino on is the ambiance; it's cozy yet lively at the same time.We had the caprese salad and the pickled artichoke hearts arrive at the same time, both cold dishes.  This was a perfect way to start the meal because both flavors were so different from each other yet very complimentary. The caprese salad had a sweeter taste with its balsamic vinaigrette in comparison to the tangier artichoke dish.We then moved onto the eggplant parmesan and the polenta fries. The eggplant was great. It didn't have the overkill of sauce that you usually find when you go to your average Italian restaurant, the eggplant had a slightly smokey flavor to it and the cheese was just enough. Overall this dish fulfilled my appetite without making me feel like I was going to have a coronary.The polenta fries. Now this is special. The fries are great...what makes it great is the sauce that comes with it: a thick, red pepper sauce for dipping.My boyfriend and I loved dinner so much, we opted for coffee and dessert. We chose the chocolate, vanilla, strawberry gelati with berries and biscotti. We were happy we did.Overall, this place was great and we'll definitely come back here when we visit Chicago again. Throughout the entire meal, we kept talking about how much we wished we had a Quartinos in LA."
"I came here with 2 friends for weekday lunch, because my friend had a 50% off coupon. We had a wonderful lunch - I love tapas, but prefer Italian food to Spanish so this place suited me to a tee. All the dishes come out as they are ready, this wasn't a problem with 3 of us ordering a few small plates, but I guess it could be awkward with only two people, or if someone wants pizza and someone wants polenta fries.... in any case, I think Quartino is made for a big group and lots of wine. That's how Italian should be done, and I'll be sure to be back here to do just that!The food: polenta fries sounded interesting but weren't as interesting as I thought; we still polished the lot off... eggplant parmigiana was delicious, as was penne alla vodka, the veal meatballs came in a sauce that i could not stop eating. Even the table olive oil was great quality. All in all, it was a fantastic meal. Can't wait to try to salami and olive bar too. AND - they have $5 wine for take home. No idea if it's any good (it is 'table wine') but good effort!!Oh - fantastic service too, considering the amount of rushing about they have to do to keep those dishes coming.Update 23rd August - popped in for a 'dessert' in the shape of a cocktail this evening. Incredibly knowledgeable and lovely waitstaff mixed us a phenomenal espresso martini, invented a chocolate one to meet our 'dessert' requirements and let us enjoy them at a leisurely pace in great buzzy surroundings. I could get used to this."
"My favorite Italian tapas restaurant in the city.  Some of my favorites:  veal meatball slider, pappardelle, shrimp risotto...among others.  The hot chocolate cake is to die for."
"Quartino's is in the heart of downtown and I'm usually dissuaded by the downtown restaurants because they are skewed for the tourists in terms of price and quality. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Quartino's. Reservations for a large group of 10 people were easily made through Open Table. The restaurant won't seat you until the entire party is present but if you show up early the bar was a great place to wait. I've never done italian small plates, but I really love this idea. Any italian place will serve you giant bowls/plates of pasta which is not calorically feasible for one meal and you end up sharing it anyways. So if you love to share, you will love Quartino's. If you don't love to share it's ok, you'll just be shunned by the rest of your table. It was great to order wine by the liter (yes America that is a metric measurement). The food came out quickly and was delicious. The antipasti was fantastic, my favorite being the prosciutto wrapped dates. The pasta was cooked al dente as it should be. I'm seated with 4 italian ladies, and if they're satisfied with the dinner than you know it's good. My final note has to acknowledge the fine staff. We had a mishap with the order and it was dealt with quickly. Let's just say a bottle of limoncello ended the evening on Quartino's. For a large group, multiple liters of wine, and a lot of food (dessert of course), I didn't break the bank and left satisfied."
"My gf and I basically strolled in about an hour before closing and they still seated us.  Not only that, but the food was still as fresh as you'd expect it to be if you were walking in during peak hours.  If I lived in Chicago, this would be a regular late-night go-to spot.  I have rarely had food of this quality, this close to closing."
"One of my favorite spots in the city.  Delicious food and great service that won't do damage to your wallet.  Here are a few dishes I have tried:Pizzas- Margherita: Good but worth spending the extra $1-2 for another pizza that packs more flavor- Quattro Stagioni: I ensure one person orders this every time I go because its flavors compliment almost any pastaPastas- Cavatelli: So simple, yet so delicious.  I think I remember a waiter telling us it was a favorite pasta of many workers- Rigatoni: I'm more of a red sauce vs. white sauce person, but I very much enjoyed this cream-based pasta- Tortellini: Melts in your mouth, mmmDesserts- Zeppole: Ask for half honey half dark chocolate sauce so you can savor both flavors- Dark chocolate fondue: Quality chocolate.  We ran out of strawberries by the end, so we began dipping our Garretts popcorn in itService:They are friendly and attentive.  One time, my friend found a hair on her pasta dish (later realizing it was probably her own hair haha).  We told our waitress who was very apologetic and offered that they make us a new pasta.  My friend said it was okay and that she would eat around it, probably because she figured it was her hair.  After we declined the new pasta offer, the waitress let us know that the pasta was on the house, along with any dessert of our choice.  Of course, we went with the most expensive dessert they had-- the dark chocolate fondue.  Afterwards, the manager came to our table and apologized for the pasta.  They handled the situation very well.  5 stars."
"Very good experience--excellent waitstaff, tasty mixed meats-cheeses-vegetables platter ($25 for a ton of food) and La Dolce Vita on tv!The apricot purée was to die for and went amazingly well with the asiago."
"Came here with some coworkers after work on Wednesday. When we contemplated on how our dinner was, the only thing we all had to say was ""SALTY!"". The food was way too salty. We (table of 3) ordered a mish-mash of all sorts of things: margherita pizzabruschetteshrimp risottobaby octopusbeef short ribssteamed musselsThe pizza was my favorite. The rest of the food was decent although very salty and not that amazing to tell you the truth. The risotto was one of the worst I've ever had - the rice was cooked but it just tasted bad. The short ribs were okay, not the best I've had. Also, the bread in the beginning was pitiful. It was cold, stale and not at all good. I would agree with the noise problems mentioned by other reviewers. You really can't have a conversation in this place because it's so hard to hear other people. When I first walked into this place I immediately had some sense of deja-vu until I realized that this place reminds me of Pastis in NY. After finishing the meal I would agree that it's basically the same restaurant - trendy looking but the food just isn't good.One thing I will say though, is that the price is decently cheap. We got gelato and it was $2 which is ridiculous for restaurant priced gelato. However, after tasting it, I will say that it tastes like it's meant to be $2. Our bill ended up around $90...cheap-ish, but I think you can do better elsewhere."
"I wasn't in the right mood for this place, so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt.  The food was good, but the rest of it really got under my skin.  I got an unexpected invitation and accepted it against my better judgement.  Saturday night in tourist central, on the hottest night of the year?  Reason enough to stay home at the end of an exhausting six straight days of work, but I decided to go anyway.As soon as I walked in, a wall of noise hit me:  this place is LOUD.  Then I stood at the hostess stand for a full two minutes--while other people came in behind me and were assisted!--before finally asking if someone could help me.  All I needed was to be shown to the table where my friends already were sitting.  My chair was broken, and I really started to hate this place (however, they brought me a new one on request).  I also had my back about 18 inches from a bus station and was constantly jostled through the entire meal by numerous staffers, none of whom ever apologized.  Let me say for the record that I did like our own waitress (Emily S.), but everyone else found ways to rankle me.But, the food has a good reputation, so here it is:Caprese salad:  B+; I love these things, and it's hard to do them poorly and hard to do them excellently; this one was solid.Crispy calamari:  B; good but uninspired; hot and crisp as promised though.Four-cheese pizza:  C-; I was trying to be less cranky, so I kept my ""What do you want on your Tombstone?"" jokes to myself.Pork filet:  B+; not sure what comprised the glaze on this, but it was savory and delicious; also served with thick green, red, and yellow pepper slices.Gnocchi:  B; nice and light, with haricots verts and some kind of plentiful green herb in a buttery sauce.  Great choice for summer.Zeppole:  B+; Italian doughnuts for dessert, served with honey; on the outside, these have the same texture and flavor as beignets, but the inside is very fluffy and airy.  Only $5 and a large enough dish for the whole table of six to share.One last note, about the men's room:  I hate restroom attendants.  Beyond being utterly useless, they make me uncomfortable, and I can't stand them.  If I find myself giving money to a guy in a public restroom, I had better be getting a lot more than paper towels."
"We had our office holiday party here in one of the private rooms.  The room was nice and the service was great.  The food was just ok.  Part of that could have been that our menu consisted of safer selections to please everyone, rather than dishes that might have been more fun or flavorful.  The salad was way over dressed and everything else seemed to lack some seasoning.  My favorite thing was the polenta fries with red pepper sauce.  I'll be back to try my own menu and hopefully update this review."
"I love this restaurant! We made reservations but it took about 15 mins to get seated. Because of that insignificant wait (IMO), the manager paid for our wine!After that, I would have been satisfied with the restaurant regardless of how the meal tasted (what can I say, I love free booze) but the food tasted great as well.  We had the salumeria tasting and several pasta dishes along with red wine that our waiter recommended. I will definitely be coming back."
"Great food, I recommend the pizzas! Pretty loud though so not a place to go for a romantical evening with your snugglebunny."
"I came here for lunch today with a fellow yelper because I had a 50% off coupon.  I thought half off meant the price, but apparently it was also half off the flavor.First we split the polenta fries with roasted red pepper sauce.  To say the sauce was bland would be an understatement.We then got a raw deal with the shrimp risotto.  Literally.  The shrimp and the risotto were both slightly underdone and again, bland. Our third dish was a pizza with gorgonzola, walnuts and pears, which sounded interesting but did not live up to the allure.  The crust was dry and floury and the sauce was bland.Is someone allergic to salt, pepper and other seasonings at this restaurant?The hostess was very sweet, and service was fine, but the food was not worth returning for."
"Quartino is a gem. It offers a local feel and has great appeal. It is reasonably priced and you get more than your money's worth. Great good, atmosphere, and service. A neighborhood joint in a big city."
"Came here with two of my coworkers. We were seated on their patio which is right in the buzz of Chicago. We got a round of small dishes (which weren't really all that small). Everything looked so yummy and everything tasted even better.-Tortellini with Alfredo & peas. Really yummy.-Pizza speck and smoked mozzarella-Gnocchi w pesto and green beans. Homemade and fresh.-Spinach salad. Fresh and easy blend. Dressing tart and salty.-Bruschetta. Portabella mushroom, tomatoes, eggplant.-Tomato soup. Rich w flavorThe bathroom was a fun visit. Sort of an old school look with a contemporary edge. It shares a frosty window with the men's room so it's a bit odd being able to see bodies moving around on the other side. But, of course, there is privacy (in the stalls).Would definitely come here if I were in the downtown area again. Quite the delish spot!"
"I gotta admit, this is one of my favorite places in the city. The food is always good and the service is always attentive. Our server (zeda) was friendly and warm and efficient.Based on this I would give them 5 stars. But Im docking 4 stars for the awful, rude manager (Short guy with glasses and a scowl---Michael....I made a point to ask his name) who was literally staring us down, and rudely telling us to finish our wine, while their was other patrons in the restaurant, a good 15- 20 minutes before their official 2am close time.I work in the industry and I know how it goes. You don't treat patrons that way. Quartinos is not a NIGHTCLUB! If people order food and wine, YOU SHOULD LET THEM FINISH IT! Especially if its before your closing time. My companions and I were shocked.  NEWSFLASH! You are in the hospitality industry. Put on a smile and be friendly, cant take the late hours, find another job.What a shame. I really liked going here."
"I went during Chicago gourmet week. I shared the Veal meatball Neapolitan, Tuscan sausage Risotto, Veal Oso Buco, Short Ribs, Duck Salami and Donuts.Pluses:1.  Tapas style so you can try more items2.  Everything was well prepared and tastyMinuses:1.  Crowded and a tight fit at the 2-top tables2.  Items ordered outside the gourmet week menu were priceyI think this is a great place for a group, but not sure I would go back with a small party.  Worth a try but I wouldn't count it as one of the must visit restaurants in Chicago."
Great food!  Great prices!  Will definitely come back.
"You gotta love Quartino for the patio seating, overlooking State Street. Oh, and for the cheap wines measured by fractions of a litre. I enjoyed the casual ambiance and European feel of the space, down to the tiny tables and glasses. As far as the food and wine goes though, all I can say is that I've had much better Italian.Everything is served tapas style here, or small plates meant to be shared according to our server. Prices are quite affordable as well, definitely much cheaper than most other restaurants in the neighborhood. The bf and I had the white bean & garlic bread (per my request), polenta fries (per his request), sicilian eggplant caponata, and shrimp with garlic, chili and lemon. I liked the caponata as I do most well marinated, acidic eggplant caponatas, but found it to be a tad oily after a few bites. The white bean spread was pretty good as well, creamy and relatively light with just a drizzle of olive oil, but could have benefited from a little salt. However I did like the nicely grilled filone toast served with the white bean spread, much better than the complimentary stale bread given to us before our meal. The shrimp dish teetered on the small side, but was probably the most successful dish we had in terms of flavor and execution; the large shrimps were cooked nicely, and the sauce of garlic, lemon, olive oil, pinot grigio and chili was simple but very good. The polenta fries failed to impress me, as I found it to be way too dense and almost tough. I also found the red pepper salsa dipping sauce on the side to be strange - almost reminiscent of a sweet & sour sauce served at Chinese takeout joints. The bf, being the crazy polenta feign that he is, liked the polenta fries for the most part, but had to sprinkle salt over it himself. Overall it seems like Quartino underseasons their food across the board, which is pretty unexpected from an Italian restaurant if you ask me.Besides the just so-so food, I wish that I could speak more highly of their well-priced wines. Unfortunately though, I think the quality of the white wine we had kind of reflects the low price tag. Perhaps I shouldn't have experimented with ordering a chardonnay/pinot grigio blend, but it really just tasted kind of sour and cheap to me.That said, I still think Quartino is still a pretty good place if you're around Magnificent Mile and want a relaxing, no-fuss place to grab a light bite. I wouldn't call this a destination restaurant, but I can understand the appeal."
"We LOVED this restaurant! We ordered the quattro stagioni pizza, the gnocchi, and the Torta al Cioccolato for dessert. Everythingggg was cooked to perfection and could not have been better. Also if you're looking for a great red wine, order the Lazio! It was a surprising treat! :) Great restaurant, great service, great vibe."
"We got went there for lunch on a Saturday, the place was packed, but we did get a table right away. We told the waitress we had only 40 minutes to eat, she said she was going to rush our order and she did, we got our risotto and salmon in no time. Everything was delicious. They had, however, a hostess that kept walking around the restaurant wearing the shortest, tightest dress I have ever seen. Seriously, her dress was so short that if it was an inch shorter it would show her butt. I thought that was totally unnecessary and not at all elegant. There were plenty of families with kids there, innapropriate does not begin to describe. You can be well dressed without showing your ""assets"". After all, this is not a night club as far as I know.  The other 2 hostesses were very elegant, I have to add.Anyways, will be visiting again for the service and food, however, I would be really a mood killer for me to see that hostess barely dressed again."
"The one great thing about the tapas menu is that it's not so crazy that you will get confused. There are enough options for variety, but not too many so as to cause a seizure. The portion sizes for the tapas were slightly smaller than normal, but still high quality. A choice of wine pairings would be helpful for new foodies or the general customers. There are numerous options for wine and the sampling is great. We didn't have a wine we didn't like. The restaurant itself it busy and vibrant, but still comfortable enough to have a good dinner coversation. With the decor and seating being comfortable and inviting. Tables are a tiny bit small for tapas service but can be managed."
"Had high expectations for this place, but they did not deliver.  Place was too loud and tables too close to one another, still had to wait even though we had reservations.  The food was blah. pizza tasted no more than a frozen pizza from the grocery store- definitely had better tapas elsewhere.  Don't waste your time or a perfectly good Saturday night like we did!"
Our family was visiting this summer and we stayed downtown.  Everytime we walked by Quartino's we noticed it was packed (at least outdoor seating was).  We yelped it and felt it was worth a try during out stay.  We were not disappointed.  There menus is quite diverse and large and I just wish we had been able to try more dishes.  Our server was friendly and helped us figure out some good dishes to try.  The outdoor seating area was a little tightly packed and the servers could not even fit into the area so I was impressed with how fast they move around and try to accommodate.  We loved the food.  I did order an eggplant dish and the cheese was burned on top so I let the server know and she promptly resolved the issue taking the plate and bringing me a new one without burnt cheese.  I was impressed with their Organic Tomato sauce that is on many of their dishes...it was delicious.  The meatballs in the little cast iron skillet were amazing.  My daughter ordered a tortellini in a creamy sauce with prosciutto and peas and this was delicious.  The pizza (thin crust) was really good too.
"SOOOO DELICIOUS! Friend brought me here for my birthday, and it was one of the most delicious yet filling dinners I've ever eaten. It's tapas style, so we ordered quite a few dishes for 2 people. There was a shrimp dish, with roasted peppers and garlic- excellentttttt!!! The calamari was whatevers; sauce could've been better. We also got the pork belly. It was cooked to perfection, with a slight cinnamon taste. (also cooked with chunks of apples!) Ordered a spinach salad just to feel healthy, but it was just average, nothing extremely special. Finally, we ordered 2 pasta dishes. One of them was in alfredo sauce with prosciutto. I loooove proscuitto and I loove alfredo, so needless to say, this dish was AMAZING. Also, we got ear-shaped pasta in a tomato based sauce with sausages, and I could not stop eating it, even though I was full beyond words.Then came dessert. Since we had already gorged ourselves on the food, we decided to share a raspberry sorbet. BEST CHOICE EVER! It was just the right size and provided a refreshing aftertaste to all the heavy food we had just eaten.All in all, Quartino was great! Would highly recommend!!!!!!!!ps- inside is very crowded, as it should be since it's super delicious. But it's super loud as well, so if you like your dinner in a quiet and non-hectic place, Quartino is probably not that place for you!"
"There's a lot to like about Quartino's. The rooms are spacious, the food is tasty and the service is generally spot on.  The location is super convenient for meandering downtown, I think a better option than Bandera's.But on to the food.  You should definitely start with the Salumeria Tasting, you select two meats, two cheeses along with three accompaniments. I don't know if you have ever had the opportunity to try Duck Prosciutto, but you should.  It is melt in your mouth delicious, for real.  The generous portions of cheese will not be forgotten anytime soon. They also provide you with a delicious walnut raisin bread, which plays along beautifully with all.  Hard to believe that we ordered pasta and pizza after the Salumeria Tasting, but we did.  The Rustica Pizza is  wonderful, although the rosemary could have been chopped a little finer.  Biting into a large piece of rosemary is like chewing on a Christmas tree, not so much.  But the Shrimp Risotto more than made up for it.  The shrimp were nice and plump, not a trace of overcooking.  Too full for dessert the times we've been here, perhaps next time, because we'll definitely be going back."
"I have been to Quartino several times.  After my past experience I will give the place one more chance.  We had the pancetta wrapped dates, tagliatelle bolognese, a plate of various cheese and salumi and olives.  Usually I am impressed with the quality and flavor of the food, but not this time.  The pasta seemed under seasoned and the dates did not need the Gorgonzola with which they are stuffed.  The waiter was cool when he asked how the dates were and we told him that we didn't like them.  He offered to take them off of our bill.  I also realized that the place is a little gimmicky with their little wine glasses and the fact that they combine multiple bottles of wine to serve a large carafe of wine.  They obviously don't know that a bottle of wine can go bad and will negate a perfectly good bottle of wine in the process of combining the two.  I also usually get the pork shank there and that was the only solid thing we ate all night."
"Good pizza BUTTT not the best.  Though I loved the italian doughnuts, they tasted like little funnel cakes!"
Welcomed 2013 at Quartinos. The decoration is fab and the food was perfect. Our waiter had the coolest personality and was very attentive. Will be back without a doubt.
Great desserts!! Great atmosphere! Would be fun to go in the summer & sit on the patio.
"I love this place! Awesome ambiance, great food and great wine. I go here at least once in two weeks. If you go here do try the ""LAMBRUSCO"" - red sparking wine!"
"A table for two was available immediately on a Thursday night around 8:30pm. The place was bustling with chatter and service. For the area, the prices are reasonable and their 'small plates' are the perfect size for me. I ordered a spinach and pear salad and minestrone soup. Both were seasoned well and tasty. They also offer housemade pastas and anti-pasta plates. Great weeknight dinner spot!"
"This was by far the best restaurant in Chicago. Mind you, I was only there from Fri night - Sun afternoon so you can take it with a grain of salt if you wish.But after my 1 hour flight after work I was STARVED. We were staying at the Hilton Garden Inn and because it was a last minute trip I didn't have the time to Yelp my way through which restaurants we should check out.While walking around aimlessly we came across couple restaurants which looked intriguing. For whatever reason this restaurant caught our attention - maybe it was the man outside sitting with a full bottle of wine encouraging us. Either way i am glad we did! Wait time:Since we were just dropping in, we had no reservations. But we were seated in about 15 minutes. Perhaps it was easier/faster because it was only the 2 of us. But the place seems to have a lot of seats.Ambiance:Dim-lit with just the right amount of light. It was a Friday night and it was bustling with a lot of noise and people. I loved it! The vibe is perfect for a weekend out with friends for just a nice gathering or for a celebratory event. It's also really cute for a date night. I enjoy tapas food because I find the engagement between you and your friends more intimate - which helps for a lively place like this!Food:Amazing! We went back in March so bear with me. I believe we ordered pizza, the ravioli, black olives, pickles, i think we also ordered some salami slices. It was all really delicious and really filling. I wish I can remember what pizza we ordered though. Alcohol:SO CHEAP! Half/full bottles of wine are SO affordable! If you go to a restaurant in Toronto you are probably going to pay $80+ for a bottle that costs $15 in a Liquor store.Service:Really great - our server was very attentive and suggested things for us because he could see we were a bit lost on what to get at first. He came around often enough - especially given that it was a very busy night.Summary:In summary, this place is a bang-for-your buck kind of place. You get the fun with good food and great ambiance without hurting your wallet. Too bad this place doesn't exist in Toronto because then I would probably want to host my birthday here with friends."
Wasn't sure what to expect. Yelp was down (drats!) so I couldn't read reviews or check rating before we went in.  Italian Tapas. Love Italian. Love tapas. How could this go wrong? It didn't! Great food. Great decor. Great overall vibe. Highly recommend. My only tiny complaint was our tiny table. No room for the delicious food. :/
Service was great! Outside seating does not take reservation so you can sit faster. The pizzas AE awesome and definitely have a salumi!
"We came here on a Saturday afternoon with a 12 noon gDine rez. The food was amazing, and the gDine deal made it all the better. 5 courses for $13pp!!!  We were literally stuffed when we left.Service was as perfect as it gets. The manager even came to our table to welcome us and make sure everything was ok. Unlike some places that will make you feel cheap for using their own deal, he actually acted like he was happy we made a gDine reservation! Everything was so wonderful, we even tipped the waiter an extra $10 on top of the 20% already paid for through gDine. We were truly blown away by the friendliness, ambiance, and food at Quartino!"
Food are served in small plates. Food are moderately priced and mostly tasted good. Favorite is the seafood stew and least favorite are the chicken pasta and italian doughnut.
"I went to Quartino for a bachelorette party dinner a earlier this year. The M-O-H set up a family-style dinner for about 12-15 of us so I was a little wary of what we were going to eat that night. Not only was the food delicious, but there was plenty of it (we actually had a bunch of leftovers) and the wine was flowing! The calamari was cooked perfectly and the mushroom risotto was superb (and I don't even like mushrooms). The waiters made sure that we were never without a full glass of wine, which was to our detriment later. But that's not their fault!I would very much like to return to Quartino and order off the menu to see what else they had to offer. Fancy, but not stuffy or overpriced."
"Quartino was just down the street from the Dana Hotel where I was staying, and I was in the mood for some serious deep dish. A virgin to Chicago, I didn't bother to check out just what TYPE of pizza they serve at Quartino. That was my bad.I ordered their mushroom pizza and it was way more than my little tummy could handle. It wasn't deep dish but still very tasty. The mushrooms were fresh and I could tell they take great care in selecting the right herbs for their sauce. However, the pizza wasn't anything special...just a pizza to me.I got a little confused when I tried to order a glass of wine, but the waitress was very explanatory about how they only serve in carafes, so I opted for a quarter carafe of a pinot noir and it filled up my small glass about 4 times which I equated to about 2 normal glasses of wine. Not too shabby for $11!My neighboring tables got pasta dishes and everything that was set down looked super appetizing, so I'll definitely be back to give those a go-round. But for now, it's A-OK in my book."
Great food and service!
Awesome food that everyone can share. Stand-out dishes for us were Penne alla vodka and the orchiette. Mushroom pizza was a big hit at the table as well.
"Good food, simple delicious ingredients. Their spinach is addictive. Loved their house made pasta and the short ribs. Would give it a five but for the noise and the pinot grigio I ordered wasn't so good. They do give generous pours but if it doesn't taste good well... won't drink it."
Probably going make sure I stop here every trip to Chicago. Love the ambience and the waitstaff has been helpful in offering advice for dishes. The cheese fondue is deeelicious. And the chocolate cake is out of this world.
This place is great for large groups. I've been here 3 times and every time the food and service did not disappoint.
"Excellent place to take a group of friends. Its my go-to place for when friends come to visit.  Staff is excellent. Food is wonderful and perfect for sharing. Every time I've gone there its packed, almost too much so but it's worth it. Prices are reasonable and there's something for everyone."
"Fabulous shrimp risotto. We made the mistake of getting the gnocchi AND the risotto, which was way too filling and we had to skip dessert (I had my eye on the dark chocolate fondue). Both were yummy, but the risotto was SO full of flavor- it was my favorite. This is a loud and busy place (even at 7:00 on a Thursday night) but it wasn't off putting at all."
"Had my first experience here approx 3 years ago and the service and food was 5 star! Returned to Quartino on a Friday night and it was a packed house!  For obvious reasons because the food and service is STILL on point!!!! Ordered the Margherita Pizza, calamari and a liter of Red Wine Sangria. Everything tasted  so good and so fresh (goodness, I'm craving that pizza right now). Was too full to order the Beef Carpaccio but, there's always next time! Everytime I'm in Chicago, I will make it a point to stop at Quartino!"
"Everything I've ever ordered here was delicious. I especially love the bacon wrapped dates. Make sure to order as many bottles of sparkling wine as possible, they're super cheap!"
"This is the best Italian I've ever had.  All the food was so fresh, made with such high quality ingredients, I was completely blown away by everything put in my mouth.  Their tomato soup is the stuff that dreams are made of.  I haven't yet shut up about it.  It's like tremendously flavorful, thick (almost sauce-like) nectar of the tomato Gods.  I'm confident in saying I'll never have a better tomato soup in my life.  I could go on and on but I think you get the point.The decor is so intriguing.  Old subway tiles, a Borax dispenser in lieu of an antibacterial liquid soap squirter... it's really beautiful and maintains a lot of the building's original features which I L-O-V-E.Gripes?  It was super loud.  Like lose your voice talking to the person next to you loud.  And we were quite literally seated right on top of each other... I'm not sure what that was about.  The service was friendly, but bewildering at times.  Still, I'd go back any day for a spoonful of that luscious tomato soup..."
"Dined here Saturday night and loved it! Being Saturday very busy and had to wait 15 mins for our reservation but found a seat at the bar for a drink before sitting down. Good bar tender and front desk staff attentive despite super busy. We were seated upstairs off to the side of the main area which was perfect as there were only 2 of us and as other reviews state it is super loud in the restaurant ( good vibe but hectic). Food is outstanding: ordered a few appetizers type plates - veal meatballs with ricotta stood out and an organic tomato salad which was perfect. Moved onto the short ribs and shrimp risotto - honestly the risotto was the best I have had. Creamy, not over rich and cooked to perfection. Randomly as were were finishing our meal the Exec Chef John Coletta stopped by our table and asked how everything was. We commented on the risotto as exceptional and he went on to tell us about the rice they import from Italy and how that adds the quality to the dish. he gave us his card and said call, email me with any comments. We are always looking to improve. Super friendly nice guy and genuinely interested in engaging with his customers. Highly recommended - come with friends."
"I came here with co-workers for dinner and man, it was tasty.  I LOVE small plates.  Love love love! And I love Italian.  Love love love! So when you combine small plates and Italian, you get me all smiley and happy (and full).We ordered a ton of food- I mean a ton. Everyting was delish! I even loved how they served the wine in mini personal carafs. The only thing I didn't love was the noise level. This is one of those restaurants that's so loud- due to acoustics or something- that having conversation or an intimate date is very difficult. So keep that in mind.  But for a large loud group or a celebration, it's perfect."
"Great spot.  Went to Quartino a few weekends ago on a double date, and this place is perfect for it.  Great atmosphere in River North, especially for small groups, perfect for posting up for a couple hours and getting after some wine and tapas.  Great bread w/ olive oil to kick things off and then margherita pizza, meat dishes, cheese dishes bruschette, pasta dishes, seaftood dishes, don't challenge me on the names because there was so much delicious food being passed around with the bottles of wine amongst good company in a great restaurant, awesome way to kick off an evening and a great way to show visitors to Chicago one of the best spots in River North."
"This was highly recommended, and I have to admit that it was rather good.  It has a nice ambiance and the food is delicious.  I ate there at 3pm on a Monday, so I cannot comment on the crowd, but the waiter was attentive and seemed knowledgeable about the food.We ate and drank for a relaxed two hours, and the main complaint that I have is that the margherita pizza was not particularly memorable.  It wasn't bad, but I would not have it again.  I probably should have avoided the pizza though, since it isn't really in fitting with this restaurant.The other dishes were all great, very fresh and all enjoyable.  I would recommend this to others, but I wouldn't wait for 2 hours to eat here."
this place is cute and very homey. price is seems reasonable. I got the bacon and dates. that was delicious. I wasnt a fan of the braised pork. the pizza was alright. We all got a shot of the limoncello. DISLIKED. It was so thick. I didn't finish mine. Maybe I just didn't have the pallette for it. Out table was very small. We have like 7 people to one of their small round table. The service was great!!
"Every time I come here I wonder why I don't come more often. Quartino is close to home, in a prime location, has outdoor seating, friendly service, and the food always delivers. Highly recommend going to share a pizza and a couple apps with friends. Also, they have some kind of lemon vanilla boozey milkshake on the dessert menu which is a-mazing."
"This is the place to go with a bunch of friends or for a casual night and great food to share.  Place is always crowded, but make a res and you'll be seated quickly at a ""cozy"" table.  I'm always amazed how the waitstaff manages to wedge/stack/cantilever half a dozen plates on the already full table - kudos. Share the plates you and your company order - don't be greedy here - you can always order another.  The white bean spread is amazing and has a little zing to it with the peppers.  Try something new every visit.  I think our favorites were: penne with vodka sauce, beef carpaccio, ravioli, margarita pizza, and our favorite for dessert - the homemade Italian donuts with powdered sugar and hot chocolate sauce.  Simple and amazing!  Only drawback is the noise - gets very loud when full.  Great place to have a few appetizers and drinks after work too, as the atmosphere is fun and casual."
"Cons: Loud at dinner timePros: Everything elseExcellent ambience. It's loud, but every detail of the décor contributes to an authentic (feeling) Italian dining experience. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious. The service was *very* attentive, as well."
"this was near my hotel on state street and got great reviews, so i tried it. great industrial space, loud, energetic, nice service, good food, small plates, good cocktail/beer/wine selection. modern, solid italian food.  not hugely memorable, but glad i went."
"I've been to Quartino multiple times over the past few months and it is one of my favorite tapas places in the city. Service is great although can be a bit rushed when the place is packed. The waiters are always very helpful, especially when it comes to advice on wine pairings.Best dishes - all of the risottos, the aged prosciutto, pesto gnocchi, and beef short ribs."
"Good service, great price but most foods are terrible. 0/2 in 2 times I have been here. Nothing tastes better than average or delicious. Just seems like a nice setting place for get together, share a bottle and small dishes, at cheaper than city prices. Their tomato soup tastes like a jar of tomato sauce, linguini with white clam sauce tastes like watery garlic with no other taste, fried calimari doesn't taste special at all... usually I can tell if food is good at a certain place by their fried calimari... no bueno"
"Excellent food. Great service. Nice wine selection. excellent atmosphere, My hotel room overlooked the portion of the city where Quartino's is located and I was able to see that it is always crowded, in spite of being in an area where there are many, many other restaurant choices, so I expected it to be good and it was.It was a wonderful, balmy late summer evening so outdoor dining was a real pleasure. The food here is serve as ""small plates"" which are meant to be shared and which is a great way to eat because it allows you to try so many things and to share with your companions. My wife and I shared three items and loved each. My favorite vegetable in the world is, well, all of them, but the best is asparagus, so I ordered the asparagus risotto and was very happy with that choice--truly excellent. The ""Crispy Calamari"" (they also offer another variety of calamari) was also great--lightly battered, plentiful and delicious. We topped these off with a veal skirt steak which was also very good.My only complaint is the tiny, tiny table we had to use to manage all this. We were warned before we were seated that it was a small table, but this table was no bigger than a serving tray with legs  and on it were the oil and vinegar, the salt and pepper, a stack of extra dishes, a little metal stand for holding a pizza, the bottle of water, the drinks we ordered, the three food plates, the silverware, and the plates we ate from. We spent more time manipulating this array of stuff than we did eating! But the food really was good."
"i checked into my hotel, went to my room, through down my bags, then headed out the door for some grub.  The hotel desk clerk recommended Quartino - nice!I really enjoyed my food:  Hearts of Romaine Salad (unique and absolutely delicious dressing made of lemon, honey and extra virgin olive oil and then sprinkled with shaved grana cheese)Tagliatelle Alla Bolognese (YUMMY)Italian Soda (oh so refreshing)I was by myself at the bar and got very good service.  The bill came to about 16 and a half bucks.  You just can't beat the value you get here.  In fact, there is a good chance that I will eat there again before leaving Chicago."
"I take EVERYONE who comes to visit me in Chicago to Quartino. It is a great atmosphere. HUGE restaurant can easily accommodate for larger parties and you can't beat the prices! I can't believe amazing Italian food could be so affordable. Food is intended to be served and is served tapas style as served as soon as it is ready Everything is completely fresh when it arrives at your table. They are efficient, effective and absolutely delicious."
i came here for a late night dinner with my friend.. she enjoys pasta.. and after seeing the reviews.. we decided to check this place out.. firstly.. it is loud inside.. it's really hard to have a conversation when you have to scream to be heard.. and that's across the table.. there are plenty of waiters so it's not too hard to flag one downas for the pasta.. we were both underwhelmed.. they need to add more salt when boiling the pasta.. the pasta itself is bland... my friend had the pappardelle.. it was really heavy with meat and cheese.. and she ended up only eating half of it.. i had the linguine with clams and red sauce.. the pasta was cooked nicely.. but sauce was bland.. the clams needed to be cleaned a bit better since i had grains of sand in my teeth while eating.. i'd skip this place and find something else..
"Food is very basic, nothing stands out. Feels like a food court. Quite edible, but not what I expect from a good restaurant.I am really not sure what to compare it to. The best Italian restaurants in New York are no comparison. Any decent tapas store in Barcelona has much more interesting selection. Japanese ""tapas"" restaurants are also a lot better.The restaurant is extremely noisy, impossible to talk beyond the person sitting next to you. The waters are good, but very slow."
"Second time and second very very good experience. Well it is crowded, but you can understand why! The food is absolutely awesome and the service is equally great. First time pasta (AWESOME) and second time pizza (AWESOME).I suggest the SALAME appetizers if you are a fan of ""Charcuterie"".The waiter was always checking on us and when my glass of coke was empty, he was bringing another one without even asking! For American people it is probably normal but when you are not used to it, you find it kind.I recommend to reserve if you're planning on going on friday or saturday."
"Love the ambience.  They did the rustic, old Italian kitchen look before anyone else did!  The service is friendly and happy to help with ordering.   The food is good (not great.)  I love the late night hours!  Will be back.  Great place for groups."
"There are tons of relatively inexpensive wine choices in various sizes (1/4, 1/2 liter, etc.) -- this is great.  The food I sampled was a bit average.  The duck prosciutto was interesting and plentiful, but as the accompaniment I would not recommend the"" Mostarda"" (mustard seeds with preserved jelly consisting of cherries, plums and apricots).  The eggplant bruschette and the dates wrapped in pancetta were the highlights for me.  The roasted beet salad was generic and forgettable.  The scene was bustling.  At least for seats at the bar, the food comes out lightning fast, so I recommend ordering in stages so you can choose the pace of your experience.  Overall, an ok and reasonably (i.e., lesser) priced experience."
Delightful!!! Super cute restaurant with tons of people there to complete the feel of this very busy dining choice! I found the dishes to be perfectly made! I thought this dining experience was perfectly yummy!!!!!
Really romantic atmosphere and a wide variety of wines. I would def come back.
"Stopped by for dinner with a group of friends.  Outdoor seating had a longish wait (30 minutes, if memory serves), but no wait inside, so we opted for the latter.  We went in, and were escorted to their upstairs dining area, which was good because it looked like the tables were more spaced out there than the main floor.  I really liked the decor.  It was noisy enough to give it a lively, exciting feel, but not so loud that you couldn't hear other people at your table talking.We ordered several dishes to start, and then a dish or two at a time over the course of the meal until everybody was stuffed to the gills.  We got a veggie pizza, mushroom risotto, the beef filet, linguine with white clam sauce, gnocchi, panchetta-wrapped dates, some shrimp, and a few others I can't remember at the moment.  Nothing was bad, and the dishes that were my least favorites were my girlfriend's favorites, and her least favorites were my favorites, so I guess that means everything was good, right?Overall, everybody in our group arrived hungry, left happy, and had a great time in the process.  I'd definitely go back."
Had quite a few different dishes. Good for big groups.
"Quartino is one of those places that I had been to for larger parties- but until this past weekend- never visited with a small group of friends. And it's shareable food concept is perfect for gathering and catching up with friends. On a Saturday night- this place is hopping- noisy, people bustling about, bachelorette parties abounding- there was so much going on it was like a carnival. But that just set the tone for our evening which was light hearted and fun. We had a reservation and got a table right smack dab in the middle of the room- which, while one in my party thought was a bad thing- I rather liked being in the center of it all (although my seat was not on the walk through like his was!) The windows were open to let in the night air and this room with it's simple wooden tables and chairs set a rustic tone. We started with a ""build your own"" antipasti platter which came with prosciutto, 3 kinds of cheese, raisin bread and a variety of spreads to try with them. There is a wide range of meats, cheeses and vegetables that you can choose. Next up we split one of the many pizzas that they had. We chose the mushroom which was really quite good. I could have stopped there but one in our party wanted us to try her favorite- the orechette pasta with ragu sauce which was as good as she promised. No room for dessert- so we headed back to the bar to wait for yet another friend and to enjoy a glass of wine after dinner. Surprisingly- the bill was reasonable given the amount of wine and food we had (about $100 for 3 of us), service was quite good given the amount of tables our server had, and the noise and bustle didn't bother me like I thought it might. Valet parking is available for $10 and is the best bet in this area as the garages around charge more. All in all- while this won't go on my list as a place to have a ""romantic dinner""- it is perfect for what it is- a casual place to grab some vino and food and catch up with friends. And on that note- Quartino met the mark."
Another great experience here! Good food and wine. It was very simple booking a reservation through my yelp app.
Subpar italian with subpar service. The red sangria was good though!
"Came here with a group of friends for a friend's birthday and was very impressed! They accommodated our large group well.One really nice aspect of the menu is instead of just getting one dish you can get two half-dishes for the same price and try multiple things. I got the Vodka Penne and the Arrabbiata Spaghetti which were both pretty good. We ordered a variety of desserts and shared them among the table - each dessert was very delicious and was probably the highlight of the meal. I was shocked when the bill came because it was much cheaper than I had anticipated, it was easily less than $20/person. I say 4/5 stars because while the service was great and the price was perfect, the food was good but nothing special. Everyone was satisfied with their meals but no one had any dishes they were raving about. Definitely a place I would go back to!"
"The only thing better than great food is an efficient and effective staff. Quartino has both. We started with soup .... I really enjoyed the minestrone. We couldn't decide on a pizza between the Campania or Rustica. So they did a half-half. Pizza was served fresh from the oven and both sides were excellent. Dessert was the Zeppole. Again, everything was very enjoyable.Highly recommended."
I've lived in Chicago 4 years now and this is still my go to for bringing friends and out-of-towners to. It's the best place to have an approachable meal in the city. You don't leave feeling stuffed or gross after too which is the best part. I think it will always be my favorite joint in the city. Recc 1.) scallops 2.) gnocci 3.) asparagus rissoto 4.) quatro formaggio pizza 5.) shrimp 6.) eggplant parm. You won't be dissappointed!
Went twice in 2 days: both days were great.First off is this the only place open late night in all of chicago? So for other city dwellers that is a need to know. Til 1 am I believe ( As we were reffered by other restaurant employees in town). Eat everything! Just jump in.Everything is served as it comes out of the kitchen and eaten tapas style. Good wine selection. Quick food and all the staff was friendly in the reataurant and in the bar. And right off red line too!
"I keep trying to figure out how this place gets such good reviews. We got a pizza and the polenta fries and nothing stood out.  Maybe I should have gotten one of the pastas?  We didn't have a bad experience, just nothing special."
Some of the best Italian I've ever had! Just decided to go one night and had an awesome meal with my boyfriend. The food was affordable and delicious. I liked how the portions were small so you can try a bunch of different dishes. We decided to be adventurous and ordered the duck prosciutto. Didn't know what to expect but it was really really good. The tortellini was nice and not too heavy. We had the caramelized banana with vanilla gelato for dessert which is to die for. The atmosphere is a bit noisy but laid back. Not exactly the place for a quiet romantic dinner. Just a good place for great food and good company. Definitely going back!Bonus: Our waiter had a handlebar mustache!
"Went here with a large group (14) last month.  Didn't have any problem with the reservation process, everything was hassle free-- Food was amazing! All 14 people had nothing but great things to say about all of their small plates options.  Prices are also very responsible especially for the location.  Will for sure be coming back!"
"Our server was very kind and helpful. We got the cavatelli, bean spread, and bruschette. All were great, but the cavatelli was the best! The noodles were cooked to perfection and the tomato sauce still had chunks of tomato in it!"
"This was a great place to share a lot of different plates.  We lucked out with great weather so we could sit outside and it was warm and not windy.We enjoyed the Chianti, olive and cheese plate, gnocchi, duck prosciutto, brushette and roasted baby octopus."
"Great atmosphere! Food was wonderful, authentic and tasty.  Servers were constantly there to help.  The prices are very reasonable.  Only small issue is that it may be a little loud and cramped, but that didn't bother our group."
"Good food, good wine, good atmosphere."
"Anytime I have people in from out of town, I bring them to Quartino and it's always a hit. Affordable, shareable dishes. Favorites:Salumeria TastingVeal Meatballs NapoliBeef FiletRigatoni Lasagna Al FornoTo Drink:Pama Martini"
4 = Food4.5 = Experience5 = Wine
"This place is so good, I had to take my family for my sister's graduation.We ordered:-Margherita Pizzas: traditional Italian pizza, but flavorful nonetheless-Rigatoni: This was a good dish, and a ""safe"" dish.  It had chicken, Alfredo sauce, and broccoli--nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing less than delicious!-Tortellini: This definitely stole the show!  ...with Alfredo sauce, peas and prosciutto, this dish was filled with ""mmmmmssss"" once they entered everyone's mouth!Desserts:-Zeppoles: I could not get enough of these desserts, so I ordered them for the family!  Definitely a WINNER!-Coppa al Banana: caramelized banana, vanilla gelato, biscotti, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and choco shavings...  This dessert took my breath away because it is absolutely delicious and heavenly! Quartino is always on point with all of their foods!"
"Came here with some gal-pals for dinner the other week.  I was craving a proper bolognese... Quartino's didn't stun, but hey, the food is well-priced considering the location.  All of it is meant to be shared so expect smaller portions (even for pasta dishes!), but you can easily get something as an entree and just not have leftovers.  (Blasphemy for Italian food?)  The nicest thing about Quartino: We got there early and were seated upstairs, and it filled up as the night wore on.  Lights were very dim and by the time we left, everything was a-chatter and a-clatter.  There's just something so relaxing about a dining room that feels ALIVE, but isn't disruptive or annoying.I crave Italian probably only once a year, and Quartino's food wasn't that impressive. But for that ambiance and the fact that we just had a good time, I'd come back.  Each of us ended up paying around $20 (food, booze, tax, tip).  Somewhat of note: A pitcher of white sangria was $16-- honestly, nothing special, but far from bad!  Also a quarter-carafe of the house wine is the perfect size for a couple of glasses, and a steal for $4."
"Being that I'm gluten-free, sometimes it' difficult to find things to eat or that's accommodating to that. Normally I have to pick a couple things from the menu to ask the waiter if it is or can be made to be gluten free. However, this place, to my delight, has an entire menu that is gluten free! They do have a regular menu, and much of the menus both overlap each other. It was great that they had sooooo many options.... having that FULL menu to choose from!We had the sampler to start, which was an array of different cheeses, italian cured meats, side veggies and olives. We also tried the mushroom risotto and the veal osso buco. The sampler was great, the waiter even gave us an extra thing or two to add to it. The mushroom risotto was made with a pork stock, it was good with the fontina (i think) cheese that came with the sampler. it wasn't too soupy and cooked to allow all the right flavors in. The veal was delish! The meat just fell off the bone, and didn't really need the knife. The bone marrow was still in the bone, had great flavor and super rich.Definitely wanting to go back next time I'm in town!"
"Come here for the following:1.  House Red Wine;2.  Duck Prosciutto;3.  Octopus; and, most importantly4.  The PROFITEROLES.Yum.  Italian tapas at it's best.  Reasonable prices, delicious food.  Must try!"
"Just tried Quartino last Saturday and it was great.  I guess the key is to eat early to avoid the crowds.  We made reservations for 4:30 anticipating that it would be packed later in the evening (thanks fellow yelpers for the heads up).  Now let's get to the food.   I started off with the Minestrone Soup, which tasted wonderful, not too salty. The main course was the Ravioli Filled with Braised Pork, Speck, & Fava Beans.  It was an excellent dish cooked perfectly.  For dessert, sorry I can't remember the name, some sort of chocolate cake, but holy crap, it was so good!  Anyway, the food is great, but the seating is way too close together.  I can't imagine what it's like when it is busy!  We will be back to visit Quartino, just not past 5:00."
"Project Runway out for an evening of modern dining is how I would describe this place..  Frank Sinatra would have loved this place in his younger days.  I owe a great thanks to the concierge at the Wit Hotel Chicago for this recommendation.  My long time friends think I have some Italian blood in me because of my love of pizza, and pasta.  Alas, that is not true, but this restaurant goes on my list of best Italian restaurants in the great city of Chicago.  I had the Italian chicken soup which was an unusual combination of cheese, chicken, and risotto.  My linguini with white clam sauce was truly a spectacular dish.  It was a little more al dente than Americans are used to , but the smaller tapas version was truly a wonderful with some wonderful vegetables and a little red pepper.  I had the coppa alla banana for dessert.  It was one of the best desserts I have ever had with fresh banana, vanilla gelato, fudge and wonderful biscotti.  I did not have the pizza but everyone was raving about it.  Quartino makes you feel like you are in Italy."
"Seafood stew was amazing.  The rest if the meal, though, was just average. The spuntini consisted mostly of unremarkable pastes from a jar.  The broccoli rabe was terribly bitter. The ravioli was pan fried and more like a dumpling. Atmosphere-wise, it has a bustling rustic quality but it's extremely loud - yelling is necessary to make yourself heard - so take care not to bring children."
"I would definitely go back here... Great ambiance, reasonable prices, authentic cappucino, and good house wine. Only tried the pickled veggies and cheese appetizer, but I thought the food was good. I would like to try some of the pasta dishes. If you're looking for a good place to relax and catch up with friends - this is a great place to hang out in downtown Chicago!"
"*DrinksThe wine list is pretty extensive and what even better is their selection of affordable wines by the glass and by the bottle. My sweetheart and I decided to enjoy one last drink and some eats before flying out and stopped here because of the sign out front advertising a good bottle for a really good price.*FoodTapas style always makes me think of leaving hungry. Sad but true... I am a pig. I was really happy with the pricing and portion size. We got a cheese platter and some other great things to pick on before our flight. We went light so didn't get to try to much but I would definitely come back again with a group of people.*Service/AmbianceMy sweetie and I had all of our luggage in tow as we were going to head to the train  to take off for the airport after grabbing a drink and the hostess moved around a couple of chairs and a table so that we could sit outside and enjoy the city during our last drink. If you get the opportunity to sit outside then I would totally grab it. What a great way to take in the liveliness of the city then to dine on its sidewalk.It wasn't much fun waiting for the little that we ordered. We stopped because we had a little time to kill, not a lot. I would have understood more if it were more that we had ordered but it wasn't so I didn't.*OverallThe whole idea of lots of people gathering over lots of food is lots of fun to me. It would be really fun to come back and order a butt load of different dishes and chat the night away over some good wine with some good friends. Not stuffy and not overpriced. Not anything too special either.Rating: 3"
"Quartino had been on my list to try and I finally got a chance to go one Friday afternoon while not at work.  My friend and I sat out front since it was a great day and the atmosphere was great and had good people watching.  The server we had was very friendly and accomodating when we asked for his suggestions.  The wine was very reasonable - we happened to get a bottle of wine for $20 - can't beat that!  Per the waiter's advice, we split the ""sampler"" which included 3 smaller salads of our choice, 3 cheeses and 2 meats.  Everything was great - it doesn't look like a whole lot of food, but trust me it is.  We couldn't finish it.  We also ordered the palenta fries since people had raved about them on here.  I have to say, I wasn't all that impressed by them.  Overall it was a great lunch and I'd recommend it for lunch, a crowd, or a fun place to bring out of towners - since it's small plates, it's great for sharing & trying all sorts of dishes."
"Had dinner here on a recent Saturday night, and would be happy to go back.LOWS- wait for a 4-top on the patio was about an hour, but not unexpected- pork belly, do not order this. It came out overcooked to the point of being nearly charred. - mushroom risotto, another miss. The risotto seemed undercooked and something about the mushroom ragout just tasted.... mushy. I'm a big fan of mushrooms, but this was all wrong.HIGHS-Toscana (on the big reds list), this blend of cab and sangiovese was a great complement to our meal. Very drinkable, but held it's own with some of the bigger food flavors.- Orecchetti pasta  with fennel-sausage ragu was really excellent- calimari were nice and crisp- Our server was very friendly and attentive. When we told him we were disappointed with the risotto and pork belly he took them off the bill. Even though some of the dishes were off the mark, the prompt correction by the server more than made up for up. Looking forward to going back and sampling more of the menu."
"ProsGood food, fast service, moderately priced, attentive staff, approx $25 per person.ConsVery loud downstairs, upstairs is a bit quieter. Portions could be a tiny bit bigger.Strong recommend"
Comfort Italian.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food here.Appetizer: Duck Prosciutto / Cheese - unmemorableEntrees: -Orchetta w/Fennel Ragu Sauce - yum-Pork Shank - oh-so tender with a great side of mashed potatoes
"Quartino was the last stop on the Restaurant Week train.  Can I just tell you how insane this place is?  Walking in at 6pm on a Friday I wondered if maybe I had accidentally made a wrong turn and ended up at the Chicago Board of Trade, or perhaps that was the night Charlie Sheen had booked himself a party.  There were so many people crammed into this place I could not even tell you what the joint looked like. I remember some subway tile on the walls, some mirrors, and a flat screen (that played the single weirdest black and white movie outside of a John Waters flick I have seen in some time). Loud and boisterous, with much hollering and pushing throughout the whole place.Now, to all of you nay-sayers who complain about Restaurant Week being a ""rip off"" - that you are being cheated out of decent portions and/or high quality food, I say Quartino just called that bet and took all the poker chips.  Yes, at first you hear the word ""tapas"" and you think it is going to be a dish where you will get 2 bites at the most. Even our waiter said ""3-5 dishes per person is average"", and of course the RW menu offered 4, so it seemed like a no brainer.  Except, these dishes are freaking FULL SIZE and it seemed like a taunt after the 6th plate was brought to us.  What we ordered:Roasted Bone Marrow with horseradish gremolata:  This was actually an instance where you only got one bite from this dish. The bones are huge, but the marrow is very stingy and will fill up one piece of toast with ease. Extremely garlicky and slightly rubbery. Not worth the listed price ($7.25). If you want a religious bone marrow experience, I suggest David Burke's instead.Italian Artisan Fondue:  Fondue was slightly more watery than I would have liked, but the flavour was good and the type of bread offered held up and did not get sloppy and drenched from the liquid cheese.Garganelli con Ragu D'Agnello: thick lamb sauce over a quilted pasta. Enough said.Orecchiette with a fennel/sausage ragu: thick, hearty pasta with a rich sauce.  Not as good as the Garganelli, but a close second.Beef Short Ribs: Lovely, succulent beef that was spoon tender and marinated in some sort of delicious sauce. A fave.Beef Fillets with broccoli rabe:  another item that yielded only about 2 bites each, but by this time we were groaning from stomach capacity.  The meat was absolutely delicious, the vegetables too cooked and somewhat bitter.We then opted to take the desserts home, the Torta di Cioccolato (chocolate cake with vanilla gelato) and the Zeppoles (donuts with dark chocolate)  Thank god we did because those desserts were heavy, dense and rich as hell. We would have never been able to tackle those there.I am generally not a fan of crowds, but if I could go back here during a down time I certainly would. A solid choice for Italian downtown."
"After not getting into Sable, we stumbled on this delight and couldn't have been happier. Busy with an inviting interior and friendly staff, this Italian eatery only got better when the food arrived. featuring small plates that arrive as the kitchen finishes them, Quartino's food ranges from good to spectacular. Don't leave without trying the asparagus risotto, which was unbelievably good... Or the Zeppole to finish off.I'll be heading back next time I am in Chicago."
"Oh Quartino, how I wanted to really like you, but it just didn't work out that way.I took my team for lunch today to Quartino.  We were looking for something somewhat vegan friendly but also with enough meat for the carnivores of the group.   We got a reservation on Open Table and away we went.Our group of 7 was promptly seated and offered drinks.  We ordered the drinks and waited....and waited....(this will be a recurring theme).   Finally a server comes by and explains the menu.  One of the group was here and explained how it worked while we waited (and waited).  We ordered the meat and cheese tray for an appetizer along with the bruschette, Caprese salad and carpaccio.   The carpaccio was amazing.   Caprese salad was average though I have to say I'm sure it would have been better at the height of tomato season.   I didn't try the bruschette but everyone seemed pleased.   At this point, food started flying out of kitchen.   Everyone ordered a small plate and we shared across the table.   I ordered the pork marsala and it was a good dish, albeit a bit uninspired.  My lunchmates ordered pizza (which they enjoyed)linguine with clam sauce which they said the clams were overdone and the ravioli (which some were left behind).   Once we were finished, we waited and waited for a dessert menu.  We tried getting anyone's attention and no one would help.   Finally after 15 minutes of waited I attacked the manager, got the check and walked out.The food was in the 3-4 star range, but the service rated a 0-1 star.  I can't blame the busboys - they were there with water regularly, etc but the actual waitstaff was non-existant."
"I truly love this place.  I visited while in Chicago on a weekend trip from Washington DC.  The only thing I didn't like was that waiter was not the friendliest.  The grapefruitcello martini was amazing and the cheese and meat plate was so good.  It was also the least expensive place I ate that weekend.  Wonderful wine selection, clean restrooms, both of which are important to me.  I will say this place is VERY crowded and tight so if you are claustrophobic stay away.  wonderful place to go for those looking for an authentic italian experience with lighter food and a good bar."
"There were a lot of people there on the night that I went so I knew this place would be good. The baby octopus was good, but when I go back I would try something else because it didn't wow me. The prime rib was so tender, but to me it was def not enough to share. When it arrived all eyes was on my plate...it was torcher for me to give everyone in my party a piece, but I was nice and did so. They have really good pasta! I only got a chance to try a little cause my cousin ordered it. I wanted to eat all her food up from her. If you had a long day at work and are a little stressed try one of their cocktails, they are very strong. For dessert we had the doughnuts with the honey and dark chocolate sauce, the nutella sandwich and the chocolate cake with ice cream. I didn't care to much for the cake, the nutella sandwich was ok, but the doughnuts was AWESOME!"
"Very cool interior although I felt a bit crowded. The menu is exciting and I always enjoy the ability to order a selection of small plates rather than committing to one entree - I wish more places were set up this way.All of the food was good but none of it was exceptional. Also, in a city like Chicago I think it's important to have an extensive beer list - they missed the mark on this. Compared to most places in the area, though, I think Quartino provides a great value for the quality of food they're delivering. I would come back."
"Thank you. The food is great, home made and flavorful. The service was friendly and welcoming. The prices are crazy reasonable. Incredible wine selection by the glass. Thank you for extraordinary dining experience. Solid value for price paid. I will return with friends and family. Yum!!"
"Wow, where do I even begin. My 13 friends and I gathered to celebrate three of our birthdays all on the same night since they were within days of each other. We made a reservation for 9:30pm and all showed up at about 9:10. Unfortunately it was a REALLY busy night and we did not get seated until 10pm. But because of the delay, the staff sent over three plates of meat, three plates of cheese and two carafes of wine. Fo' free. Hello? (: They sat us in the private room, which normally would have a $20 per person charge, but they did not make us pay that either. Holy comps, batman... this place is already on my good side. Aside from our adorable and kind waiter, the restaurant's host kept coming into the room to check on us and make sure our dining experience was on-point. Also, he seemed to notice a colorful theme in this room full of 13 fabulous men and, well, me. So he flipped the football on our TV to Bravo, which of course was showing Real Housewives. The room applauded. We began to order food. The menu is set up with smaller plates, meant to share. There were many different tastes to please in our group so we ordered quite a bit of variety off the menu. I heard not one complaint! Everyone was very happy with the taste and quality of the food. After we stuffed ourselves, we of course had to order some dessert. I was too full for dessert, but a few friends ordered some ice cream (or was it gelato?) and I had a few bites. SO yummy. Most of the table ordered limoncello or coffee, too. Now the best part of the evening came right at the end (for lack of better term..ahem) when our lovely waiter--quite proudly--brought to our table (and placed right in front of me) the most realistic looking ice cream/banana phallus I have ever seen, complete with a lit birthday candle and, um, chocolate ""shavings"". After a tremendous bout of approving laughter we all sang happy birthday to each other, waiter and host included. What a fun ending to one of the most positive dining experiences I've ever had in Chicago. I highly recommend Quartino for a large group. Family or friends, this place is sure to please."
Delicious pork belly with apples! Brussel sprout salad was great as well. Margarita pizza has some cheese that I wasn't too fond of.Atmosphere in this place was old school awesome. Had powdered soap in the restroom and funky music. Service was on point (even told us we ordered enough for two people when most would let us order more in order to maximize their tip!).
"I came here on a date about a month ago. I reccomend this place to everyone when they ask me about restaurants to try. The Fondue was great (especially with the potatoes), and they had plenty of veggie options for me to choose from!The staff was super friendly and very knowledgable about the menu. :) I'll definitely be back with friends!"
"Best tapas restaurant ever!First of all, they have a gluten-free menu! How great is that? Also, service is pretty prompt. We enjoyed their sausage risotto, pork belly, and veal osso buco. Excellent food choices. Last time we were here we also had their Sumeria platter. The platter had our choice of cheese, meats, and marinated salads.The only thing I think I won't do again is their dessert. It's too rich for my taste. We had the caramelized banana with vanilla gelati, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce. Too much sweet stuff! If you have a sweet tooth, go for it.This place tends to fill up quickly and gets pretty loud. If you're not into being close to your neighbors or hearing a lot of noise, don't go here. If you're into the social scene, and you like sharing plates with those at your table, come! Maybe I'll see you there!"
"It's embarrassing to count the number of times I've come here in the 4 months I've lived in Chicago, but it's a testament to Quartino's awesomeness.Surprisingly, it plays well for a big group or a date, although if you're looking for a quiet spot, look elsewhere. The times I've gone family style with a big group, it's cost less than $30 with booze. I highly recommend the pizzas and pastas but would not order the mushroom risotto again - just didn't do it for me."
"We absoutely LOVED Zach!And who was Zach, you ask?   He was our most attentive, charming, and friendly waiter.  I have to commend him on being super amazing to my normally unfriendly and chaotic family.My niece dropped her sorbet dish.  No problemo, says Zach.  We'll replace it!My other niece spilled her glass of water all over the table and herself.  Oh, that happens all the time, laughs Zach.  So, he and the uber attentive busboy man cleaned it right up.  No scowls, nothing.And, he happily gave me another half carafe of my beloved bellini ($19)pretty quickly.  5 stars for service, yo!  Food was good - namely the shortribs, octopus, mushroom risiotto and the eggplant parmigana.  The polenta fries, veal meatballs and calamari could've used a bit more salt, though.  For dessert, try the Nutella sandwiches.  They are GOOD. The sharing plates concept is great for a big party like ours.Another reasons why I like this place: I made a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday for 8 people.  However, half of the party was about an hour late and they won't seat you until the entire party is there.  I could almost bet my life that they were going to give our table away....but they didn't!  I was surprised and thankful!  So, I think I'll be back...especially for more bellinis and Nutella sandwiches."
"Alright Yelp you warned me but......I burst my eardrum!   We came here with a group of 6 on a Tuesday night for a friend's birthday dinner. The food was decent and reasonably priced. We shared half a dozen dishes, however nothing stood out. I enjoyed the Quattro Formaggi pizza and carafes of wine.  Could've passed on the polenta fries and surprisingly even the chocolate fondue.For me the noise here just isn't tolerable. And I'm under 30. I honestly don't know how I was able to communicate through the meal, maybe the cheap carafes of wine allowed me to yell louder...Good place to take someone to dinner you don't want to talk to."
"Small plates offers a great way to sample a bunch of food.  Fun atmosphere, but be warned - it can be quite loud.I ordered the olive assortment which was really good.  We also ordered several pasta dishes and shared them ""family style"".  My favorite dish was the cheese fondue.  I swear I could eat that as soup!  The funnest part was that when you're trying to decide on a wine they bring you tasters.  Wine comes in 1/4, 1/2 or full litres so you can drink your own or share with the table.  Great friendly service. Our server made really good suggestions and it seemed like she picked according to our tastes (she asked questions). Sometimes I feel that they recommend the more expensive items."
"Quartino, you live up to the hype. My first experience was with the party they threw for Yelp Elites. I came and conquered their free eats. I couldn't stop raving about it to my husband that I made reservations and came again the other night with my cousin and his girlfriend. Reservations were for Friday evening at 8pm. The place was rocking. It was such a gorgeous night that we asked to sit outside but the wait was an hour. We skipped that but still had to wait about 20 minutes for our table to be available. We sat down next to a large party which made it very difficult for us to have a conversation. Well, we could but we were yelling at each other. Once they left, it was much better. All we kept saying was how our parents would love the food but would hate the noise level. That aside, the food was fantastic! We ordered the sampler: Giardiniera, roasted peppers, roasted beet salad, Pecorino and a soft cheese (sorry, the name escapes me and it's not on their menu), soppressatta and prosciutto. Other dishes included: Roasted Bone Marrow Pork Belly Lasagna al Forno Braised Pork Shank Skate Wing I was very excited to order the bone marrow and felt disappointed when I ate the dish. It had too many complex flavors that the flavor of the marrow itself was lost. There was some spice on top of it that I couldn't place. I could have done with the marrow, some salt and bread only. That was the only dish that I wished was different but all the others were divine. I'm thinking about my meal as I write this review. A liter of wine was ordered and I had a Blood Orange Italian soda to compliment my meal. The service was great, the food delicious and the company the best! The total bill was around $140 for all the food and drinks but that was cheap considering how much we ate and the amazingness of the food. Quartino, I hope you can sort out the noise levels because I REALLY want to take my parents here. They would love you like I do."
"Quartinos is HANDS DOWN one of my favorite restaurants ever. It was a date night suggestion by one of my best friends and I have been a repeat customer ever since! I live in the burbs now but when I was in the city, I would even order it to go! Never had a bad meal at this place. The food and beverage is great! The only thing I've never really had the chance to try is the dessert! But I always see other tables ordering them and they look great. You must try this place! I definitley suggest reservations if on a weekend though - sometimes the wait is and hour +"
"Ah Quartino.  This is totally my go-to for LARGE groups.  That is, if you make a reservation well in advance.  The largest group I've been here with was 25 people for my sister's bachelorette party...just so happened to be five other parties there that night.  It was still great.If all your friends commit to eating tapas style and each ordering a dish or two, Quartino is perfect.  I've never spent more than $25 a person and that was with wine, appetizers, desserts, and more food than I could manage to eat.The food is simple and straight forward enough to go with even the pickiest of eaters.  There is something for everyone."
"Oh my of my (s)....This is the place to go for a group of people, loud conversations and endless food. It's basically how you'd imagine an Italian family in restaurant form.Seriously.Seriously a must if you are in the area and wanting to sit down for a couple of hours without feeling the constant glare of a demanding waiter and the one person in your group who has already laid out their credit card fifteen minutes after sitting down. There is no rushing here and if there is, you are rushing yourself. And it's a damn shame if you do.With all of the constant commotion of people passing by every five seconds with gorgeous platters of food from polenta fries, too few types of risotto and amazing antipastas you'll get an eye filling that will undoubtedly make you want to stick around for awhile. If that doesn't spark your interests here's something that definitely will.'The tables are rustic, as in full on wood tables that make you feel like you're in the back of your family's kitchen or corner shop. For the time that you are dining, you are part of the restaurant and all that is taking place.Eating of course, but also the hustle and bustle. There is an old time classic feel to the interiors that makes me want to spend hours sipping on short glasses of wine and having long conversations with friends and family just like I would for a Sunday dinner.Quartinos feels like every meal is a Sunday dinner. Absolute bliss.Truly in love with this establishment that a friend had mentioned numerous times before and lucked out that a large group was meeting up to ring in a celebration at."
"For a group dinner, this place was simply fantastic.  We had a total of 16 guests that were seated comfortably in the Realto room.  I only wish that the wait staff didn't have to come in and out through our room and it was truly a private room but the wait staff was so friendly and accommodating that we appreciated that.  We opted for the set menu of the 3 course meal which was still more than enough food - not only did this include family style sharing of 5 different appetizers, 2 pastas, 3 main entrees and their delicious chocolate fondue dessert, we were able to order a pizza for the kids and two orders of their delicious zepploe with honey sauce.Surprisingly, they did not charge for the children who ate a little bit from the parents plate and they had a great wine list for us to pick from, as well.We ordered the polenta fries, crisp calamari and the veal meatballs napoli for appetizers.  For our main dishes, we ordered the gnocchi and the rigaton and the veal osso buco, salmon and beef filets.  All were delicious especially the veal which was served on the bone and just melted in your mouth.  Thank you again for a great experience - extra snaps to our wait staff and Julie Jensen for helping me set this up!"
"Enjoyed this a great deal! ""Small plates"" for the Italian cuisine lover. Nice selections of wines, and many could be by the glass/half carafe/full carafe. We had some mixed olives and the beef Carpaccio to start with, which were excellent. The Italian fondue - made with a mixture of several of their imported formaggio and served with bread chunks plus the added apples - was AWESOME! We had a baby spinach/pear/walnut salad which was good, but under-dressed (and I never say that!). Also, I understood that things would be brought out in the order they were available - but still was surprised that the salad showed up after all the above. Guess salad guy got busy? The only thing resembling an 'entree' we ordered was actually my least favorite. We had the gnocchi with pesto, which I normally really enjoy when in a more authentic Italian cafe. But this one was overloaded with undercooked green beans and onions and it totally overran the delicate dumplings. I would love to return for another try at the pasta and some of the more interesting appetizers. I'll put it on my list!"
"Not sure I would eat a regular meal here, but stumbling on this place before dinner or after work, it will satisfy. It's really noisy and crowded, but it's perfect to drown out voices in your head.  :) I believe my last trip I spent more on wine (recommend the valpolicella) than I did on all of my meals in chicago.  They have a great presentation of cheese, fruit and bread and a pretty good selection of cheese.  The olives were not as great as other places, but the wine induced haze made up for it."
"What an awesome place!  Very authentic!  And a great wine selection.  If you can go for restaurant week, I'd recommend it."
"This review is SPECIFICALLY for restaurant week:Restaurant week participants usually have a 3 course meal for lunch for $22 and a 3 course dinner for $33, which is a pretty great deal if it's a good and pricey restaurant. However, Quartino took it an extra step and made the 3 course lunch for TWO people still only $22, and a 4 course dinner for two people for $33. I came here on Saturday for a late lunch, and was able to immediately get a table with two friends. We were excited about the 3 course lunch, but figured we would need more food, since it was intended for two people, so we ordered a pizza as well. Well, that was unnecessary...Our first course was fondue, and the cheese was DELICIOUS. We refused to give the fondue up even when we ran out of bread! Our second course was tortellini with peas, alfredo, and prosciutto, which I didn't love, because it had too strong of a wine taste to it, but I'm sure they have other great second courses. Our third course was shrimp, and it was also great.Now, the pizza had artichoke hearts, portabellos, green peppers, and whatever else on it, and it was delicious. Moral of the story, our bill was only $39 and split between 3 people, and we had a 4 course meal and leftovers! Can't go wrong with that!"
"If you love Italian food but aren't into huge servings, then Quartino is the place for you (us)! I'll admit I was awful skeptical about the idea of merging tapas-style eating with Italian cuisine, but after I took my first bite of the veal meatballs, I was sold. Delicious! The price is right, the food is very good (not awesome, hence the 4 star rating), and the atmosphere is busy yet not out of control. I personally insist that you get the polenta fries and the linguine w/white clam sauce (the mushroom gnocchi was also very, very good). There were two of us, and we shared every dish. The waitress was friendly and helpful, and had a great grasp of the menu. I can be a bit picky at times, and she patiently answered all of my questions. Thanks, Lindsey! The bill came to just over $50, and that included two Peroni's @ $6 a throw. Forget the booze, and we could have skated for about $40 less tip. In today's day and age, you would be hard pressed to find a better deal for this quality of food. At the very least, check it out. P.S. The bathrooms are super cool, like throwback 1920's style with the powdered borax hand soap and the pebble glass. Cool!"
"Quartino was PACKED even on a Sunday night, but it was definitely the right place to go with a big group. The cocktails were rather inexpensive and although our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived, there were 8 of us and it was packed so it was understandable. The bartender also bought our first round of drinks since we waited for awhile, which always makes everything okay. We ordered a plethora of tapas which came out at different times, but there was always food on the table and our drinks were always full. We ordered a variety of dishes, my favorites had to be the gnocchi, it was incredibly rich and delicious. I had bites of everything and thought it tasted delicious. My only complaint was the noise level, it was SO loud. We had a large table since there were so many of us, and it was hard to hear anyone across the table. Once we were finished, I had thought it was going to be a large bill, because everyone had a few cocktails, appetizers, and small plates. It was really inexpensive, even for everything we had ordered... I'd go back with a large group just for the price!"
"We ordered a liter of wine for $20, and four people ate for $65. Everything was wonderful. I will be back next time I'm in Chicago."
"Eh. This place left me feeling cold. They say they open at 11:00, so we show up at 11:30 and are told the kitchen isn't open yet so we can ""just chill and look at the menu."" There are only four other groups in the restaurant and they seat everyone at tables right next to us. Then when we order, I get that it's a small plate place, the snarky waiter made a huge deal about everything coming out as it's ready. Our fondue comes out and is very good, followed by our pizza, which was okay, then we wait. After about 40 minutes has passed since we first ordered,  and we notice our neighbors (who were seated after us) have calamari. So we ask after ours. The snarky waiter gives us the speech about how everything comes out as it's ready because...blah, blah, blah. Magically, though, after we point out our neighbors have theirs, it comes out right away. Unfortunately, not worth the wait, it's soggy and rubbery. I might be willing to try it again in the evening when they hopefully have their A team out, but overall, I was super disappointed. Osteria via Stato across the street is a much better bet."
"We LOVED Quartino and will make it a regular stop on our Chicago trips from now on.  It was packed on a Sunday night which spoke for itself.  We enjoyed great service, fantastic food, fun atmosphere and an overall great time!  The plates are small (for sharing, like Tapas) but we each ordered one to share and we all felt very full and satisfied so the final tab was not bad at all.  I would recommend the pizza and the Sangria.  Wasn't too crazy about the tortellini.  Overall thought we loved this place!!"
"It was my first time being there, but is definitely not the last time I go. I loved, loved, loved the Sangria they make and put in this cute personalized bottle for you enough for two glasses, I had my personalized pizza that really is delicious and made with fresh ingredients. I had the Paparazzi Pizza with grilled chicken, fresh zuchinni, and delicious cheese. YUUUUUUUUUUUUUM! So delish!!!!! Overall great place for a date or be with friends! Only reason that they don't get 5 stars, they only offer the regular mojito...... :("
"I have been here twice and really like this place. This place is always packed on weekends and why not, the food is great.This time around I had the cavatelli pasta, short ribs with salsa verde caprese salad and calamari.The short ribs were very good, I think the salsa verde was a great compliment. The cavatelli was quite tasty too. We also had the tiramisu which was quite tasty. I really didnt want to eat any more but i will never say no to tiramisu.Highly recommend this place."
"could use salt --- on everything.as mentioned in other reviews of the Quartino, the service is fast and the food is inexpensive.we tried everything based on what was highly reviewed: fried polenta (interesting concept, the red pepper dipping sauce is good, probably would be better if it had cheese inside, could have used salt -- couldn't finish all of them because they were a bit greasy) i know it sounds contradictory as I mention they need more salt & to add cheese! :)veal meatballs - a little dry, the sauce is some kind of light brown clear gravy with raisins - IMHO would have preferred these to be in a red sauce (I was expecting meatballs of the little owl caliber (NYC restaurant), based on how people were raving about them on yelppapardelle - this was probably the best of what was on the recommendations - a little chewy but goodwe also tried the eggplant caponata which was my favorite, but their bread is just OK, so that could have been better.good place to go with a family, the atmosphere is lively and nice - reviews mentioned it being noisy but we didn't find it unbearable."
"Good small plate Italian restaurant. Calamari, salad, pizza, rigatoni. Bottled beer and wine."
"My friend and I had lunch here today, 09/27/13, and the meal was good.  We tried the $25 prix fix lunch for two which consisted of soup or salad, and two different entrees.  She chose the minestrone soup and it was 4 stars good.  My salad was fresh and delicious. The second course is pasta and I rated it OK; I've had better.  It was definitely served hot so watch your tongue.  For the third course sheI chose salmon.  It was a bit to rare for my liking but it was served in a sauce that was delicious.  Again, a bit undercooked for me, but OK.  Finally, the dessert.  A banana gelato creation that was fabulous.  Overall, I recommend this restaurant. It's located on a busy street and has an outdoor cafe if you prefer seating in appropriate weather."
"We went to Quartino on a busy Saturday night recently.  We were a party of 5 plus baby and all had a great time.  Food was excellent, loud vibrant vibe, friendly and helpful staff.  Couldn't believe our check wasn't much higher when we got it.  That was a pleasant surprise!  Highly recommended!"
"I ate at Quartino during Yelp's office hours.  The appetizers and pizza they were serving were pretty good, so the hubby and I decided to get a table downstairs and order a full dinner.  The atmosphere is casual and very nicely decorated.  We were seated at against the wall in a corner, which was great because it was quiet even when the restaurant crowd was booming.  On to the food --DISAPPOINTING.  First of all, we were told the food is tapas style portions, but they seemed like standard sizes to us - so be careful not to over order.  Then our food came out lightening fast, which makes us think that it isn't made to order.  The sauce was jarred-sauce quality.  The pasta was meh.  The risotto was undercooked.  If I'm ever back, I am going to stick to their pizza, which was surprisingly one of the most Italian-American/NY style pizzas that I've had in Chicago."
"My date and I had the opportunity to dine at Quartino on Valentines day.  We went in and the lobby was very full...luckily we were able to snatch a table in the bar.  We were greeted and waited on by Meghan who was very sweet and attentive.  We had the following:Caprese SaladZola Noci and Pere PizzaTortelliniAsparagus RisottoThe only thing we were not a huge fann of was the Asparagus Risotto, and when asked how everything was we told her that it was delicious but the Risotto didn't seem that flavorful..and she immediatley said i'll take it off the bill which we weren't expecting. She reccomended a white wine for my date and I had a red and then we also had some type of italian drink when we started.It was a great spot for Vday."
"Quartinos is a great spot that Chicago has been missing for awhile.  They have great cheese plates, apps, and wine.  This hits on two different levels, one for a nice date place to get some apps and wine, or two with a large group of people for a bday.  Only complaint and it's not their fault, no parking anywhere but well done."
The quality of food is good.  This is a great place to go as a group and order several items and share.  The house wine is reasonably priced and decent.
"Had been going to Quartino for a long time, ever since when they first started adveritising wine is cheaper than water, yeah but that was many years ago.  They used to have $5 valet parking, which is super cheap comparing to all the surrounding businesses.  Now, their dishes are more money and their wine is more expensive, but it is still a great place to go.  This place has a lot of tourist traffic, or vistors from the suburban areas and they can probably get away with not serving very good food because a lot of these ppl will never return.  But I have to say they neve take advantage of that and they have kept up with their consistency.  This place is a 10 min bike ride from me and I always appreciate the vibrant atmosphere at Quartino.  The staff are always helpful and they must be doing something right to keep up with all that crowd.  Another good thing about Quartino is they open pretty late so if you ever want to stop by for a late night snack, this would the place.   One dish I have to mention and recommend is their profiteroles, the puff is soft and fresh and the ice cream is always cold, it is a great combination and it's great to share with others at the table. MKL"
"We reserved the private dining room, was a great atmosphere for us, allowed us to converse without too much noise. Attentive and knowledgeable service. Excellent food, all around. Family-style meals passed around... although I think the portions are a little small for this style of dining. Be sure to order several menu items, including desserts."
"Food/Service/Value = 5 stars.  However, the last two times I have visited this establishment it has been chock full of bachelorette parties and plastic penises.  I realize there is no way for management to prevent these types of guests (since the restaurant does cater to large groups), but I'm not sure why women find it necessary to make trashy fools of themselves just because they're getting married.  My husband and I had hoped that it was just a fluke when we were there three weeks ago, but took a group of six on Saturday and saw at least three bachelorette parties again.  It's embarrassing.  I no longer feel like I can take visitors there because I'm not sure how they will react when the waiter brings a banana split sundae made to look like a penis to the table next to us.  Or perhaps they'll be uncomfortable being approached by a girl who ""has to kiss a stranger."" It's sad what this restaurant has become."
"I've been here a few times w/groups, and on a pretty forgettable date. It's alright, and for the non-adventurous group, fits the bill. It's very reasonable, and has all the basic italian staples. My issues are that the food is average, but definitely not the best italian in the city, and it gets obnoxiously loud. Positives are that the house wine is cheap and delish, and you can bring just about anyone here and they could find at least something to eat as it's a pretty extensive menu. I hate to say this, because I""m sure a lot of restaurants have issues w/bugs that patrons arent' aware of...but there was a cockroach on the wall (the last time I've been, obviously). Considering I was with a group of girlfriends, we managed to keep it relatively under control and a busboy zoomed over and took care of it. But needless to say, none of us will be back."
"Super loud, super fun, super good.We went with quite a large group on a Thursday night for pre-wedding weekend festivities.  They were very accommodating, seating a few of us early while we waited for the rest of the 20+ person party.  Our waitress was wonderful, making recommendations and putting up with a rambunctious crowd once the wine started flowing.In true tapas style we ordered a hodgepodge of items and passed them around.  The standouts were the calamari, one of the salami plates (I forget which one exactly) and mushroom risotto...absolutely delicious!  I wasn't a huge fan of the ravioli though.  It was a tad pricey, but distributed evenly with as large a party as we had - not sure if it would have worked out as well with only a few people.They sat us in a kind of alcove between the two rooms, which was great because it provided a illusion of privacy for our group.  We still got to enjoy the atmosphere of the place though, and even had an anonymous diner send our tables a bottle of champagne for the celebration.  How nice!  When I'm back in Chicago I'd definitely head back here for seconds."
"Found this place with the help of Yelp!  We took my in-laws here for dinner before going on a Weird Chicago tour.  Phenomenal atmosphere, upscale decor, extremely attentive wait staff and some of the best tapas I have ever had in Chicago.  We had the olive assortment, caprese salad, shrimp risotto (OMG!!!), Veal Osso Buco, sauteed spinach and the salmon.  Hands down best shrimp risotto ever.   Everything was divine and surprisingly reasonably priced.  We were stuffed!  The only drawback, in my in-laws opinion, was the loud atmosphere.  But they are in their 70's - what do you expect?  Honestly it didn't bother me at all. Loved it and can't wait to go back!"
"This is definitely a small plates type of restaurant meant for sharing, so that is always a bit tricky for ordering, but the waiter definitely helped us out. I would definitely recommend the cheese fondue & the calamari & the donut dessert. Wow looks like I recommended a lot, but lots of good eats. They definitely get a GOOD crowd on a Saturday night, so make reservations, and seems better for an older crowd."
"Great location.  Great Ambiance.  Great Food.  Take your friends here when they visit Chicago.Because I don't want to repeat anything everyone else has probably said, I'll just list some of my favorites so you can order them for yourself:Eggplant Parmigiana (very tasty, and one of the best I have had)Cheese Fondue (pretty good, nothing exceptional, but it's a fun meal and definitely try it with apples).Dark Chocolate fondue (also an experience that is fun, and you get a lot of fruit).Shrimp (another must try, cooked perfectly and drizzle it with lemon)Fettuccine with marinara (the sauce has some cream in it; tasty but nothing too special)."
"This is my second time at Quartinos and it was fantastic. As always, the food is affordable and delicious. Our server was pretty prompt and we didn't have to wait too long. The sangria (rose) was super yummy. I got a tortellini in alfredo sauce and prosciutto, which was very yummy, but got cold quickly. The sausage thin crust pizza was very good. This food was more than enough for 2 people to share along with the bread and oil. Overall, a very affordable and yummy restaurant!"
"A great spot for group dinners!I had friends coming in from out of town and wanted a place for dinner where we could share plates, chat, and have a good time. With only a week or so in advance, Quartino had plenty of room to serve our reservation of 9 people on a Saturday night. The place itself is very spacious with two levels. Lots of big groups filled the restaurant, so its noisy but we could still carry on a conversation comfortably. As far as food goes, everything we had was delicious: pancetta wrapped dates (x2), cavatelli, gnocci with pesto, calamari, salmon, arugula salad, and eggplant parmesan  The fresh doughnuts for dessert were to die for. We ended up only needing 8 plates for the whole table, got 2 litres of white wine, and dessert for only $19/person. Talk about a good deal!They got us in and out very quickly (1 hour) but we didn't feel rushed. Props to handling large groups so well, quartino! I will definitely be back."
"For my first real meal in Chicago, this really hit the spot. A bit of caution first... On a Friday night, even with reservations, be prepared to wait a while. (And yes, it's very loud!)That being said, they have a wonder cocktail menu with all sorts interesting drinks to pass the time. Otherwise, the wine list is really great and quite affordable too... Quite a few reviewers have complained about the service, but let's face it.. A popular place on the weekend is going to have spotty service. I had to flag down my waitress like I'm working air traffic control at ORD. While I didn't get her attention, the manager did see me from across the place and immediately took my order and the food came out within minutes. We started with the salumeria tasting... a great appetizer to nibble on. Ministrone soup came out extremely hot and delicious with a lid on top (a nice touch). The prosciutto d'anitra pizza was amazing. The roasted baby octopus was pretty good.. Wasn't a fan of the eggplant parmigiana... By the time the the fettuccini came out, I was stuff..lol"
"This was the quintessential serendipitous Chicago restaurant. Great, lively atmosphere, excellent food and top-notch service.We arrived at prime dinner time, with both the outdoor and indoor sections filled. Yet we were immediately seated at a nice table on the upper level. Despite the hustling nature of the place, we didn't feel shoe-horned in and felt like we belonged. We realized that the place was fairly large and had different spots for everyone. Several options allow Quartino to be exactly what you're looking for:  street-side patio, hang out at the bar, simple tables and even larger spots for family or group gatherings  I even liked the marble stairs, which seemed to give it some an old timey Chicago feel.I ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bologonese, which was more than enough for one person. My other half enjoyed the scallops. Our meal turned into something of a tapas menu, as we shared our entrees. For an appetizer, we had the Italian fondue. While fairly simple, it was delicious and hit the spot."
"This place rocks. Plain and simple.Thank you Yelp for helping us find this awesome dining experience! Had an afternoon in Chicago before heading home and saw great reviews so decided to give it a try. Oh my goodness am I glad we did!We were there for lunch, and I would absolutely love to go back for dinner, there was so much more I'd like to try!! Everything we did have was incredible from start to finish.The atmosphere is so warm and charming. Having just been to Italy about 6 months ago, I felt like I was stepping into a little piece of Italy right here in the Midwest. The service was fantastic - friendly, quick, with a thorough understanding of the menu.We had an incredible antipasti platter to begin the meal. They have meats cured right in house and amazing imported cheeses. You have to try some. We also enjoyed the quattro formaggi pizza, which was a very authentic thin-crust Italian style pizza. Ended with the donuts for dessert. Caution: These aren't just any donuts - you'll want to order more! What an amazing taste and texture experience. So yum.The restaurant was huge and the bar looked really fun. The upstairs was really charming, with windows overlooking the city streets and a fireplace in the center of the room. I can imagine it full of hungry dinner patrons!They also have classic Italian drinks like Prosecco by the glass and an Aperol Spritz. These aren't always easy to find in these parts! Big 5 stars for Quartino!"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE quartinos! I love their menu, their prices and their food. It's decent quality food for a good price! (which is what I love!) I would definitely recommend any of their pizzas (their margarita pizza is awesome)! Also, their starter appetizer tray that comes with 3 different cheese, 3 different appetizers, olives, and a bunch of other samples you can choose is awesome! It it is great starter for a big group of people to share. It can get crowded on a weekend so get there early....tables are first come first serve I believe."
"Excellent food, fun, loud. Enjoy wonderful tapas in a great location. Bring a group of friends, it's that kind of place."
"I've never ordered every dessert item on a menu, until I came here for dinner one night with some family & family friends. We had some not-so-memorable appetizers, a few pastas which were yummy, and then, came the finally: 8 or 9 or maybe a dozen (i lost count) desserts just hit the table all at once! Biscotti, gelato, sundays, torts, cakes, fritters, doughnuts, it was like a fat kid's paradise! My favorite were the doughnuts which came with dipping sauces. I don't really remember any part of the appetizer or main courses, or even all the wines, I think I was just in a sugar coma."
"Good food, good service. The decoration is very classy and that doesn't mean a premium price on the menu either."
"me and my friends went here on recommendation from one of her aunties.  she's italian so we figured it had to be good.  we were not disappointed.  there were six of us and we ordered:margherita pizza: pretty standard.  nothing too special.fumo neghli occhi: delicious pizza.  had speck (kinda like prosciutto).  their pizzas are thin crust so if you're looking for some chicago deep dish this place is not for you.caprese: not a big fan of mozzarella cheese, but my friend who loves caprese said it was goodravioli: my favorite dish!  the sauce was fantastic and the filling deliciousgnocchi: very good!  it's a pesto gnocchi with green beans.  i thought the green beans added a nice crunch.  not your average gnocchipenne alla vodka: everyone else's favorite dish.  you can never go wrong with this.calamari: pretty standard calamari. nothing too special about it.we were all able to eat and no one was left hungry.  we also got some wine and they offered it in many sizes so you can try multiple.finally... dessert.  oh my god.  the table next to us pretty much got one of everything and just looking at it we wanted to do the same thing.  but we were full from dinner so we all shared the torta al cioccolato: pretty much a chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream.  this is my far my most favorite dessert anywhere so obviously i thought it was perfect.zeppole: kinda like beignets.  little doughnuts sprinkled with powdered sugar served with chocolate sauce and honey to dip.  they were good, but i'd rather have my chocolate cake.definitely will go back when i make my way over to chicago again!  only got 4 stars because our waiter took so long to take our dessert order that by the time we ordered the food was starting to settle and we weren't sure if we could eat more.  the TVs were showing some old movies when we just wanted to watch the football game.  it was only showing in the bar area."
"This is much more than a pizza place! I was surprisingly impressed with the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen. All dishes were well prepared. I was especially pleased with the Shrimp risotto. Made with aged Acquarella rice from Piedmont, this was, bar none, the best risotto I have ever had. Prepared perfectly. The place is called a small plates restaurant, but all the dishes we had were decently sized, and thus well priced for River North Chicago. Our waiter was just right; cheerful, knowledgeable, efficient, and not too big of a salesman. Our food was served fairly promptly considering how busy and congested the restaurant was. We lucked upon  prompt table availability when we went for dinner. This was Monday night. Could be tough on a weekend, especially.The wine list was interesting and I would say average priced. The restaurant is part of a small local group, the Gibson Steakhouse Group.As for the noise level, I cringed when we entered. If it had been up to me, I would have left. But I asked my compatriots and they wee still wanting to eat there. And I am glad we did. I have to say it is worth putting up w/ the noise level; and the hustle bustle of the place.Next time I am in Chicago (I go about 3-4 times a year for wine trade events) I will definitely revisit Quartino's. Maybe try it for lunch when it is, I am sure, some what quieter."
"Great food and fun ambiance.  Ordered some raviolis, the carpaccio, the salumi plate and a massive gelato dessert. The place just buzzes and it's fun to watch the kitchen and the servrs move about in orderly chaos."
"Amazing time here and one of my favorite Italian spots in Chicago. We always order the Salumeria Tasting and a pizza, this place never disappoints."
"Great food. Well-Priced. Fast service. Fun Atmosphere.  Note: Not the place for a quiet meal, as it gets loud since its popular and the tables are close to each other."
"LOVE IT HERE!  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because it is so loud.Food- great.  Love the idea of Italian tapas.  You order and the dishes come out as they are ready.  Sometimes I do stagger my ordering because many of the items come out so fast it fills up the table.My favorites are the pizzas, vodka sauce pasta, and the doughnuts for desert -- MUST HAVE.   Drink- great wines, and many of them cheap!  I'll stop in here and pick up a couple bottles for home.Atmosphere- casual and dressy crowds. Don't feel like you need to dress up to go here. Very casual and inviting atmosphere.  Many dates, a lot of big groups.  As I said earlier, this place is LOUD.  If you are coming with a group, don't expect to hear what the person across from you is saying.  So sit by the two most entertaining people in your group, beause that is pretty much the only people you'll be talking with.During the al fresco dining season- great outdoor space.  Be prepared to wait quite some time for it though.This place is BUSY.  Expect to wait. Fortuantely, there is plenty of room in the bar so order some great wine while you wait! Make a reservation if they are taking them (they don't take them during peak times)."
"Second time here. Friggin amazing again.Their service is always excellent.Food is always amazing. We had lots of things but the veal skirt steak was unbelievable. I was laughing the whole time I was eating it was so ridiculously good. The bone marrow was mostly garlic, but still tasted good. Great wine selection and atmosphere.Would make a special trip to Chicago for this place."
The food was okay - wide selection.  The wine was also good.  I think the best part about this place is that it's downtown.  Pops across the street has better food and champagne.  Quartino's is also too loud for an intimate conversation or date.
"We met some friends here for an early dinner on a Friday night. And Im glad we did because the place got packed, with lots of people waiting.The service was good, the food came quick and was ok. Not out of this world, but was good.A good place to go with a large group."
"This place is always pretty good!  I usually think this place deserves 4 stars but I am going to give them a small demotion based upon the attentiveness of the service and the value of the food, which is always good, but was not as good the last time I went.  The problem with this place is a lack of table maintenance and overly expensive drinks.Gnocci is the best thing I have had on the menu and everything else is always pretty yummy as well.I am definately coming back even if my last experience wasn't perfect."
"Order Wild Arugula Salad, Beef Filet, Rucolina Pizza, and Polenta Fries. The food is great overall, especially Rucolina Pizza. Very flavorful, which is a little hard to achieve since it has no meat to add the flavors. My friend really loves Polenta Fries, but I'm not a big fan of deep fried food. The Wild Arugula salad and Beef Filet are just averagely good. Just what you expect to be a restaurant salad and meat entree.The environment is very nice, great for meeting with friends/coworkers.  The server is very welcoming and helpful with recommending dishes"
"My girlfriend and I made reservations here for our Valentine's Day dinner and loved it.  The food was great (although the $25 for 2 meats, 3 cheeses, etc special seems like not enough for the money).We will definitely go back soon."
"If you are looking to host a larger event in the city, Quartino is the place to do it. We recently hosted 100 of our family and friends at Quartino for our wedding rehearsal dinner. Although we were at the capacity for the private upstairs rooms, Julie and her team made it work. The food was delicious, warm, and prompt, and the service was delightful. Roberto did an excellent job of coordinating toasts during each course and he was constantly checking in with my family to ensure that they were happy. It was a little loud upstairs, but the Quartino staff did everything in their power to make it a private experience. Plus, they kindly met all of our quirky audio/visual needs and meal substitutions. Thanks, Quartino!"
"Like so many places in River North you can tell this place is part of a restuarant group. But they make up for a sort of cookie-cutter look w/ lush tasting Italian, an ample wine list, good service and a friendly staff."
"This restaurant, part of the Gibson group, has become my and my boyfriend's go-to date night place. It's easily accessible and really well priced and the food is fantastic. A dinner for two, with a shared dessert comes to around $35 with tip. A couple of things should be noted:- Quartino's is a large restaurant and packs people in so at times it can be very loud, especially if you are seated near the bar area. Although I don't normally like sitting by the kitchen exit space, it is actually one of the quieter corners of the restaurant- They are known for ""family-style"" dining. This means that their dishes are meant to be shared by a group of people, each of whom takes what they want from a plate and passes it around. I personally don't like to share my food but have never experienced a problem with portion size. However, if you do find their portion to be small, it's cheap enough that you could order another entree easily. - They are great for groups and for kids. They make really accessible Italian food - especially their entrees. Their apps are meat/dairy place centered, which isn't my thing.  A lot of people go here for bachelor/ette parties or after work, so their staff is used to accommodating large groups of people. The attire isn't casual per se, but suits aren't required. It has a comfortable elegance. - For those that drink, they have an extensive wine and beverage list which looks fantastic. They also always have a crowded bar.Recommended dishes:Eggplant parmesan, pizza margherita, zeppoles with dark chocolate dipping sauce"
"One of my most favorite places in Chicago. Ideal for dates with family, friends, and lovers. Risotto is super rich, the octopus is salty and succulent, the braised short ribs are fatty but really tender, their tenderloin medallions are perfectly paired with the broccolini, pizzas always deliver crispy crusts and plenty of toppings, their polenta fries are a delight-a crispy bite into a soft comforting goodness (yeah I know, it's just polenta). Also, excellent wine selections. Overall, a few things that stand out when I think of this place. My ultimate favorite go-to!!!! :)"
"This place was okay; was it the best Chicago dining experience I've ever had? Far from it.  But, we went here with a group of work people, and it seemed to have something for everyone.It was pretty easy getting there from the Red Line station, and once we got in, I was really afraid we were going to have to wait, but we walked right in, with no problems with the reservations.  Our waiter was a little flaky; you could tell he was definitely insincere, and almost trying to put a ""I'm Italian, forgettah bout it""/Tony Soprano's little cousin attitude out there.  He was okay enough, but we did go out to dinner with a few people that kept kosher, and one vegetarian, and after ordering our charcuterie and cheeses to be on separate plates, he came back with one plate with everything on it.  He didn't seem to mind having to take it back and get a new one, which was appreciated.  The food was just bland.  It wasn't bad food, it just wasn't great.  I had a bowl of tomato basil soup that tasted a lot like a can of crushed tomatoes, and a vague hint of basil.  I added a ton of salt, which is something I rarely add additionally to my food.  We had an assortment of things at the table, and they all seemed to be okay, but everything was just needing a kick of something.  The soups were definitely under-seasoned.  The charcuterie was okay, but the cheeses that our waiter suggested were something to be desired, especially the soft cow's milk cheese.  I also ordered a pasta, which was an orecchiette.  It supposedly had fennel sausage in it, but I could barely taste the fennel or meat, as the sauce was overly cheesy/creamy.  If the sauce was just a little bit lighter, or there was less of it, it would have been a lot better.  We ordered a pitcher of the sangria, which, as far as sangria goes, was also mediocre/okay.  Not a bad experience, just probably wouldn't recommend it with all of the other better choices in the area."
"Quartino was recommended by many as a ""must"" for our visit to Chicago for marathon weekend. The service was incredible - arguably the best I've ever had dining out. And we went to eat here two nights in a row (because the food was so good) and the service was as good one night as the second. We ordered papardelle (thick flavorful ribbon pasta) and linguini and clams (more clams than I expected). We also added broccoli rabe (heavy on tomatoes and onions) and steamed spinach, both of which were great.Tiramisu was not to be missed...and didn't disappoint."
"I have taken my family here many times, for lunch or dinner. The food is always amazing, the service is impeccable. I've recommended it to many people and I always get a thumbs up about them and a thanks for the recommendation. If you're anywhere near them or drive in from the burbs as I do, this is the place for great Italian food."
"The servers deserve 5 stars and the food 2.  We had the olives, beet salad, meatballs and a mushroom pizza.  All were bland and mediocre."
"Wants to be a new concept of Italian tapas, but tapas are Spanish by definition so they fall short by delivering over-priced small dishes base on typical Italian things."
"I love Italian food and wine, but most of their dishes totally lacked flavor. With such classic ingredients such as tomato paste, garlic, oregano, basil, olive oil, red peppers, capers, veal and Parmesan cheese, how can your food be bland? Wine: Good range of  Italian wines. The temperature of our red wine was too warm (do they have a temperature controlled room to store red wine in?)silverware: had lots of spots and food particles. The waiter cleared it away and brought us new settings.Here is what we ordered: Veal Meatball Slider: OK White Bean & Garlic Spread: really bland - we ended up adding salt, olive oil and the chopped paper relish that came with the sliders to make it good.Rucolina Pizza: lots of arugula, but really salty. The tomato sauce had no flavor.Prosciutto Di Parma: good - but there is not really any cooking involved hereBroccoli Rabe: totally overcooked (parts of it were brown)We were going to try a pasta dish but decided at this point to cut our losses and go down the block to Starbucks for lattes and chocolate chip cookies.Did we come on an off night? Did we order the wrong things? Some people love this place, but I don't think we will be back."
"We live down the street from Quartino and always witness the large crowd of people that gather around the restaurant. This has become one of my favorite neighborhood spots.The plates are meant to be shared. Some of our favorites are the tortellini, orrechiette, and the chicken noodle soup! The pizzas are thin crust and have great options for toppings. We usually get 3-4 plates to share among my wife and I- sometimes we have leftovers to take home. We've never had a pasta that we have not enjoyed there. The pasta is cooked to perfection! The food comes out fast, so if you want to eat slowly and enjoy each plate ask your server to bring out the food slower.We love to eat outside at Quartino! The outside area is always crowded and they always seem to have a minimum 30 minute wait. We've eaten a few times inside and it is loud and hard to have a conversation with anyone. If you are trying to eat a fast meal, I suggest dining in the bar.The service has always been amazing! The wait staff is friendly, informative and personable. Since we go to Quartino a lot, they recognize us and always acknowledge us. This is a great place for both eating with a family, large groups, meeting friends, or a casual date night. This is our favorite neighborhood Italian spot in River North!"
"Ohhhh Quartino. Such a love-hate relationship. LOVE: having large parties here, the split-plate dining style, the bellini, and the speed at which food is delivered to tables. HATE: The noise level, the dish towel napkins (DON'T wear anything black!) and, sometimes, the attitude. Quartino isn't top of the line Italian food, but what they do, they do well. They're great at accommodating large groups, and the casual atmosphere is a major plus. There's a fantastic selection of pizzas, pastas, and other Italian small plates, with enough variety on the menu that everyone is guaranteed to enjoy something and stay engaged."
"I  have been here a couple of times and it is hit or miss.  The first time was a couple of years ago and I was in love with their spicy fried gnoochi. Then I came back, they told me that they no longer serve it, I was bummed.  I'm not crazy for their pizza but  octopus was pretty good. Overall even with a reservation you are still waiting and the place is always over packed. It also really hard if you are trying to catch up with people because it is too loud."
"I have eaten here twice, and had a fantastic experience both times. We had the margherita pizza and lasagna the first time, and a pepperoni and veal sausage pizza with fettuccine alfredo the second. Everything we've tried has been wonderful and fresh.They start off the meal by letting you know the portions are made for sharing, but if you order any regular menu items one plate is plenty for each person. They also serve complimentary bread with olive oil before the meal, which is our favorite. The service is amazing, there is always someone nearby if your drink is getting low or you would like more bread.  The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting and the interior design of the restaurant is beautiful. I love the chef's jacket right inside the front door that is signed by Julia Child. There is always an old Italian movie playing while you're eating.We stopped in for lunch this weekend and as it was St. Joseph's Day, the patron saint of Italy and pastry chefs, the chef sent out a complimentary plate of zeppola pastries for dessert to every table when the check arrived. It was a wonderful surprise and a delicious treat, the perfect ending to a fantastic lunch. Love love love Quartino!"
"This place is great!  Family style italian and every dish that we had was tasty.  It seemed like the food just kept on coming!  The best part of the dinner was that the prices were very reasonable.  The wine prices too were good.  Not the normal 4 times markup you see at most restaurants.  You can even get different size caraffs of wine!  Good food, good prices, good atmosphere, good service, good friends, what else can you ask for..."
"Taking on the responsibility of planning your best friends 30th birthday dinner is no easy task. There are tons of details and moving parts that if not thought out well could easily take the evening in a direction from fun and intimate to disastrous and awkward. With so many options and a paralyzing fear of failure, naturally I turned to the advisement of my fellow Yelper party planners extraordinaire for suggestion. Quartino was surprisingly the overwhelming front runner and apparently for good reason; the event and private dining staff were so on point I was able to throw the birthday dinner to end all birthday dinners. Tune the kazoos, hero Brett saves the day!!  Despite it looking like a tremendous amount of effort on my part (kudos to me), putting this event together couldn't have been easier (kudos to Quartino). After combing through their numerous group dining menu options and selecting our dishes for a 4-course prix fixe meal - which really breaks out to 9 dishes - I was able to sit back, relax and let the magic happen. We arrived to our private room - The Wine Cellar Room - to find a warm, rich space enveloped in wood and flickering candlelight. What a far cry from the bright, rip-roaring scene inside the Quartino main dining room... no need to scream to hear the person beside you, this was perfect and intimate. My addition of some floral table arrangements (thanks Jayson Home and Garden) and tons of extra votive candles created quite the mood. Is it a dinner or a seance? Who cares, it's super sexy. With the house red and white wines overflowing together with great conversation our dishes began to arrive in multitude...Round One//The Antipasti: Delicious, chewy Neapolitan pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, zucchini, funghi), veal meatballs and crispy calamari. Yum! Round Two//The Pasta Course: Cavatelli with ricotta, tomatoes, fresh basil (unfortunately served a bit on the lukewarm side) and buttery Tagliatelle Bolognese. More meat sauce for me!!Round Three//The Main Dishes: Garlic shrimp with E.V.O.O., Pinot Grigio and lemon (my fav of the evening), Farmhouse Chicken with lemon and herbs (boring, bland) and the Prime Angus Beef with seasonal vegetables (a perfect medium-rare sliced filet with tangy balsamic roasted root veggies). Round Four//The Dessert: Dark Chocolate Fondue served with a collection of fruit and homemade biscotti. Sinful, delicious, perfect for sharing.   Small unique details like personalized menus printed with a distinctive message for the birthday girl, unlimited portions for our dishes and fabulous service from cute boys helped me to overlook shortcomings like cold dishes, a 30 min wait for our room to be ready and a forgotten special dessert with candles for my guest of honor. For $35 p/head + the unlimited wine package at an add'l $15 p/head, this party was a tremendous steal! When exactly did wine become cheaper than water?? Obviously when my bestie had the best b-day imaginable, that's when. Looks like Quartino may just be my party (and vino) utopia."
"First off, I think Italian is a more apt descriptor than tapas, though I guess the idea is that you order several dishes for your group to share, so maybe that's where they are getting tapas??The place is huge and definitely a fun atmosphere for large groups, such as bachelorette parties, which was the occasion for both my visits.  I found the service to be great on both visits - despite being very busy - and price-wise, they have some affordable options interspersed with more expensive offerings, so that's nice.But the food isn't anything special.  Not very memorable, really, though certainly not bad.  I couldn't even pick out one thing to recommend.  During my most recent visit, they brought us some of those donuts with chocolate dipping sauce, but I didn't have any because I tend not to like that type of dessert - too rich."
"Even the loudest places have their serene nooks. And we were sat in one of these, in a corner at the top of the stairs far and away from the commotion. But still close enough to think it was perfectly lively.So Quartino's heyday may have passed, but you wouldn't know this by the horde of people waiting outside or the patrons crammed like sardines near the host station. Definitely make reservations.We began with a carafe of the house red (ridiculously cheap) and a slew of small plates. We started with the broccoli rabe, a dish nicely complemented with olive oil, garlic and red chili. The white bean garlic spread had a nice kick to it--very spicy with a smooth texture. Of course, we had to try pizza. Our server recommended the Stefano, Neapolitan-style crust topped with olive oil, house-made mozzarella, sausage and rosemary. The description overpromises a bit, I wasn't as impressed as I hoped but it still hit the spot. The highlight of our meal was the eggplant parmigiana--basically a generous portion of the purple-skinned vegetable baked with tomato, basil and covered in mozzarella. Simple but delicious. I felt we were a bit rushed as tables need to be turned quickly to seat the waiting public, but otherwise Quartino's a great choice for a fun meal. Oh, and our check came to $44 for food and wine. For 3 people! Safe to say I'll be back."
"I love that they are open late with their tapas menu.  When we got in, I was stunned to see how ginormous the place was . . . but empty as we were approaching closing time.  That is a win for us.  The meatballs were definitely tender, but I thought could have used a bit more taste.  The bacon-wrapped dates were a nice combo of sweet and savory.  The lasagna, oh my, the lasagna - complete cheesy goodness."
"Visited here on Sunday evening, party of four, no reservations. Place was busy but no problem getting a table indoors. One thing. This place is noisy. Our waitress came over, introduced herself and explained the menu and the portion sizes. Ordered the white bean / garlic spread and bone marrow for appetizers. Both were good, I especially liked the white bean spread. We ordered two pizzas to share and an order of gnocchi with pesto. I wish the pizzas and gnocchi were as good as the apps. The gnocchi was not very good and was sent back. Way too oily and off tasting. No problem with the server removing the item. The pizzas........not that good. The Margherita one was only OK, the mushroom one was flavorless. Both were also sort of under done. Pretty disappointing. The manager came by and asked how everything was and my wife told him the truth in how she felt. He disappeared for quite awhile along with our server. Finally, we got the check and they had removed the items we were not happy with from the bill along with an apology for us not enjoying our visit. It was not all bad. Our server was really good and the manager wanted to make things right and he did so. That gives hope. I know that Quartino is part of the Gibson's group and that this group knows how to run restaurants, so I am a bit put off on giving them a less than stellar rating. Would I go back? I would give them another shot, not sure if my wife would though. Cheers to All"
"This Italian place is borderline 3.5-4 stars for me. Even for a Sunday night at 9:30PM, it was still relatively packed and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.___________________________Pros:- Great table buser service. Empty plates were taken away promptly.- Extra dishes placed directly on table: great for sharing food.- Pasta was perfectly al dente and even al-DENT-e if you know what I mean.- Prices were very affordable for the budget traveler wanting good Italian food.-----Cons:- Pasta and risotto tasted a little bland.- Not enough dressing in my Tre Colore salad...__________________________Overall a good dining experience:-Tre Colore Salad: 3.5 stars-Baby Spinach Salad: 3.5 stars-Pasta Alla Vodka: 3.5 stars-Tortellini: 4.5 stars- really cheesy! Yummmmm.-Risotto: 3.5 stars-Steamed clams: 4.5 stars. YUM! Excellent broth.-Profiteroles Dessert- 4.5 stars of yummy goodness! We should have ordered two!-Gran Coppa Quartino Dessert: 2.5 stars- It didn't have vanilla gelati!!!! And it tasted like regular ice cream. =["
"Great food, awesome atmosphere, and good service.  Highly recommend."
"Was a bit skeptical as I'm used to eating at upscale, trendy places in Scottsdale where $10-15 entrees are unheard of but saw how many yelp reviews there were so I figured it was worth a shot. WOW....was I impressed! I probably had the best raveoli ever there. They made it with bacon which was a huge hit since I always like when chefs throw curve balls into traditional recipes. And this wasn't like your traditional piece of american breakfast bacon. It was the thinnest sliced Italian deli style/quality type on it. Absolutely blew my mind. It was such a cool atmosphere in this place too. There were probably well over 100 people crammed into this dining room that you would normally expect to seat about 40. It was so loud but in a good way. Not overwhelming. People watching was a blast here. Definitely lot's of bang for your buck here and a great place to hang out and have drinks on a Friday night."
"Okay, I'll admit it - I came here about 4 years ago after hearing rave reviews. Never had I been so disappointed in a meal! I had actually succeeded in dragging my boyfriend into the city for dinner, and we were very let down. So, I badmouthed this place for years, not quite understanding peoples obsession with Quartino.A group of 12 girls and I came here on a Saturday night in March for a quick bite during our friends bachelorette party. We had reservations, so we didn't have to wait, and they easily accommodated our large group. This time around, the food was spectacular! We all ordered small dishes so that we could share, try different things, and not get disgustingly full. I'm still obsessing over the eggplant parmesan - SO delicious, and just covered in thick, gooey mozzarella cheese, served in an individual cast iron skillet. I also tried some pasta dishes, the gnocchi was very good. The thin crust margherita pizza went over really well with all of us - loved the thin, crispy crust! By far, the star of the show is the peach bellini. Pure perfection in a glass. fantastic peach flavor, just sweet enough, and they give you enough for two glasses - score!If I wasn't tipsy, the noise level would have been UNBEARABLE - this is a complaint from my first visit that carries on into this visit. Bad acoustics + rowdy groups = not being able to hear your dining companions.I'm glad I gave this place a second chance - now I have much nicer things to say :)"
"Let me say that I do not often eat out in Italian restaurants. Mostly because my favorite Italian dishes I cook for myself. But given that whole octopus is hard to find, and I miss the ambiance occasionally, my wife indulged me and we gave Quartino a try. A restaurant in River North cannot help but be touristy, I understand that. And despite this, Quartino managed a certain amount of rustic charm endemic to a northern Italian trattoria. The kind where old retired men might play Briscola or Tressette on a warm summer afternoon while sipping house Chianti. However, one got the distinct impression they were trying to hard to make it quite so rustic. And it didn't help that it was roughly 4 times the size of an Italian trattoria, and way too tightly packed. It wasn't quite as bad as bumping elbows with our neighbours, but neither could we stretch out much. The tables were not large, and the staff kept the bread coming. The entrees were small, somewhere between tapas and a regular meal, which encouraged sharing, but made their price less palatable. The octopus was tasty, but not amazingly so. The roasted bone marrow was delicious, but not out of this world. And the caprese salad had the right ingredients, but the tomatoes were just short of mouthwatering. And while it wasn't obvious which wine to go with (and their list was quite nice), I went with the house Chianti, which left me feeling underwhelmed, even for the price. Overall, if ever in the River North and require a rustic Italian experience, this is a nice place to go. But on most occasions you might be better off leaving it to the hordes of tourists wandering the area."
"Can't wait to go back and have another lunch, 3 courses for 2 = $25 bucks"
Food was really good and super quick but service was pretty weak...
"Best place ever!!!! Always good and always a good time. GREAT option for clients looking to have a good time and get social too! Go with a group to maximize tasting options but always get 1. The salumi options 2. The sausage. Where the wine is cheaper than water IS my favorite group place to go in the city. Words of warning though.... It is loud, it is crowded and you better have reservations. Italian tapas for all!!!!"
"5 stars for the place, the sangria, and on top of everything for their beef carpaccio.I need it once a month!Definitely the best Italian restaurant in Chicago, and affordable."
"Eh, I remember this place being much better. First, it was crazy busy on a Thursday night. It was LOUD, I mean shout to hear the person next to you loud. Worst of all, it was kind of ordinary. I love the small plate idea, as we get to try a lot. But, it was a mess. Everything hit the table at once, ugh. That would be the Parmigiano Reggiano over there with the fennel salad. Beet salad over there. Watch it, it stains. Heirloom tomato salad and Broccoli Rabe at that end of the table. Ravioli stuffed with braised pork with speck and fava beans here and the pizza on top of it all. Yep, we eat a lot. But, this was probably too much for us. We realized at that point we would have some leftovers. So we grazed and sampled what we had. The tomato salad and pasta were the best things we had. The huge chunks of cheese were really good too. The broccoli was basic and disappointing, could've used more garlic. We were hungry for pizza, sadly it was one of the worst we've had in a long time. Seemed undercooked to me, which looked like how they did them, and an awful combo of bland gardiniera that hardly resembled the quattro stagiono we expected. I make better pizzas at home, quite a disappointment. The GM was attentive and swooped in to check on us and offered to get another pie or take it off the tab. That was a nice touch and we just removed it. The Profiteroles for dessert were a great recovery. Vanilla gelato, a tasty chocolate sauce and toasted almonds. Quickly devoured, yum! Quartino was packed, so our service was spotty for the night. Otto did this kind of tapas better, but they managed to lose my CC the last time. Maybe I should take that as a sign to go to places with full size portions?"
"Stop complaining about it being loud! That means it's crowded and people are having a good time. It's not a library! I love this place and it is on the itinerary every time we go to Chicago. The pizzas are awesome. Don't ask for the wine list, just get a carafe of the house wine and enjoy."
"I have been to this resturant twice.  After visit #1 I was really not happy, but vist #2 leveled my experience a bit so I wanted to give it a solid 3 for effort, and I realized partly my first visit was imporper expectations on my part.The atmosphere is nice, they are a busy place, and the seating is tight, my first table was really open and cramped and i had made a reservation so it was not like I was first best seat available, but it was a friday night and anything goes for tables for 2.  The second visit was a nice, larger, more secluded table in the back and things were much more private for a finner for 2.  My date and I were in the mood for pizza on my first visit, and we were not happy with what came out.  FIrst of all I was expecting to be able to order deep, but they only have thin, had I read more I would probably have been made aware of this, but nothing anywhere near 'chicago style' pizza is available.   What they do have is very, and I cannot find a way to say very 100 times without writing it out for emphesis, very thin neapolitan only choices.  They were very un-exciting, crispy pita friezbees with nothing about them that satisified in the way of pizza.  By itself it is not a bad meal, but don't go with high hopes, the sauce needs more spices for my taste, but i understand they are using an old family reicipe so I dont want to sound rude- after all this is about my expectation and it was not a bad pizza, just something I personally will not order again if I ever returned.As it turns out, another date wanted to go here a few weeks later, so I said I would try again and find something on the menu to try different.  We chose the all appitizer route, and things were better from the table, the service was nicer, the atmosphere was slower, weeknight vs. a friday night, and the apps were all tastey.  They did not have cesar on the menu, but they made one for me, large, be sure to tell them you dont want full little fishes on the salad if you dont, but the eggplant dish was nice, the calamari was fresh, we also had a thin beef app that was very tastey, and she chose a bean dip that she raved about.So would I go again, maybe- but set your expectations and make sure you try a weekenig first."
"A desperate girl's plea, for a Quartino in Boston's North End:I went to Quartino with a good friend, whom I hadn't seen in a long time back in April, 2009. We decided to stay off the menu and feast on antipasti instead.  Honestly, it started a love affair with duck characturie for me, cured duck, duck prosciutto (not quite certain of the difference - but does it really matter)?  Any place that offers the quantity of dried water fowl intended for human consumption with olives(!), that this places does is absolute heaven as far as I am concerned.Since visiting (I'm from Boston, wonderful foodie haven) I've sent friends and colleagues (good food is appreciated even more far from home) to Quartino and it has not disappointed.A wonderful place, I only wish it was close by...."
"Pretty good, the prosciutto was amazing. It was the wifes birthday, the waiter gave us a shot and some italian donuts complimentary. This place rocks!"
"I love this place. This is probably my favorite place to go out to eat in Chicago right now.Went in on a Friday night with a group of about 10. I had made a reservation, and we only waited about three minutes for the table. As some of the people in my group hadn't been before, I explained about how it works (like tapas, but Italian, and use small plates to share everything). I just ordered for the table, and worked with the server to get a mix of things.As we were eating, one of the managers came just to make sure we were doing ok, which we were.We then ordered dessert, which was amazing. The Tiramisu (not on the menu, but ask for it) was amazing.I love this place and will go back many more times."
"I would call this the Italian take on tapas. Every time we go we'll get an order of calamari, and then order from their meat-chese-olives-spreads menu, and get neverending wine. What a delight! Their food is so fresh and LIGHT! You always leave full, satisfied, but not feeling like a cow. It's also very easy on the wallet for such a nice restaurant. Wine really is cheaper than water here. Great for a date, when your parents are visiting, or with a group of friends. Plus their kitchen is open late! I recommend the peace bellinis."
"Loved it! We sat outside. There is a street side patio and also a second floor balcony patio. Both have overhead heaters and some free standing ones. They made it the perfect temperature for a little cooler early fall evening. Nice setting! There is a huge menu with lots of variety. Plates are ideal for sharing. We tried the olive assortment - nothing too special/unique about them. Then had the dates wrapped in prosciutto - they were fantastic, could've eaten 2 orders! They are basically an Italian version of the Spanish tapas dates, if you ever had those kind. We then split the rigatoni with vodka sauce. SO good!!! Loved the sauce. Seemed a little creamier/cheesier than other vodka sauces we've had. I even used the bread (which was good too - olive oil, etc served at each table) to soak up the last bits of sauce!! Next we moved on to the Soprano pizza. It had veal meatballs and giardiniera (which is just hot, pickled peppers & veggies - sounds odd but SO good!) the meatballs were smaller & sliced so they seemed like eating chunks of sausage on a pizza vs. an actual meatball. They were moist & flavorful! Great combo of flavors on the pizza, definitely recommend. The only thing I would not recommend is the white wine sangria. Ordered a carafe of it and it basically just tasted like juice. Don't bother trying it. We will definitely go back again!"
"four items on the list was definitely enough for four girls.BEEF CARPACCIO -- meh.. i've had better. it could have been seasoned better.. and the type of cheese they used. blahhh. i'm not sure what they used but i know i didn't like it. POLENTA FRIES-- i DO NOT recommend. it was soooo bland. seriously it had no flavor and the sauce was really bland too. the only way i could get it down my throat was by dunking it in tabasco sauce. GRILLED OCTOPUS-- small portion but definitely worth it. i'm a big seafood person so i enjoyed it a lot. it was my favorite dish, actually. MARGHERITA PIZZA-- erm.. one basil leaf. seriously. just ONE. hahha. and the cheese was super super melted. wasn't the best looking pizza and tasted more like a regular cheese pizza but it was still good. if you thought ""okay i'm just eating regular pizza...."" erm...italian sour apple soda. SO SWEET.waiter was friendly. plus one.it was too pricey for the quality offered. not much of a fan.. PS. their bathroom is soooo trippy. the woman's restroom area where you wash ur hands is separated from the men's by clear glass. when i first walked in i saw a man and i thought i was in the wrong gender. i literally stood there and looked for the man but only saw women. it was so odd. only after i come out of the stalls did i realize what was going on..oh also. the soap is powdery. THAT was also trippy. felt like it was powdery because the soap was so old that it turned into powder.... hahahaha. idiot me. but it was cool!! after i realized that it wasn't old soap...... :)) hehe."
They have gluten free pasta! Excellent service. Menu is rich with small plate selections but even the small plates are filling. Great wine selection. Great ambience for a date night or small group of friends.
"My experience at Quartino was the final nail in the coffin containing my former passion for Italian food. They just don't make it in America like they do in Italy.I came here with my parents for a late lunch after seeing it ranked #8 on Yelp Chicago. We were sat immediately outside on the patio. They advertise Quartino was a tapas restaurant, but the portions were pretty big. Value-wise, it's a good deal, but it's not conducive to trying several things. We ordered:Half prosciutto d'anitra, half sausage pizza: This was a huge let-down. I wouldn't say it was awful, but it's nowhere near the quality I expect from an upscale Italian restaurant. The crust was dry, the sausage was tough, and the prosciutto d'anitra was 95% arugula with one or two sad slices of prosciutto. Everyone raving about the pizza here needs to go to Pizzeria Mozza in LA.Veal meatballs Napoli: The best of our dishes. The meat was tender and moist, and the raisins added a nice touch of sweetness to it.Shrimp risotto: Just okay. I love risotto, but this was very, very heavy, so much that I couldn't even taste the shrimp and zucchini.Gnocchi: Pesto and gnocchi is a strange combination, and it didn't really work for me. The gnocchi was cooked well, but the dish was bland and unbelievably oily -- I couldn't get past the uncomfortable sensation of everything sliding down my throat. Our server was amazing -- funny, courteous, and very patient. Unfortunately, that's the best compliment I can pay Quartino."
"I don't really understand why Yelp raves about this place. It's got a weird vibe--fancy, yet casual. Service was slow. And the food wasn't even that great. Granted, the prices are pretty low, but you can find better in the neighborhood."
"I've been to Quartino quite a few times now, and each time has been a little different, i.e. the service isn't consistent. What is consistent though, is the food. It's always delicious and perfect for sharing with others. They have a great wine list with awesome bottles of the month (at $20 a bottle!) that's affordable for anyone. I've had everything from their cheese & meat platters (definitely try the tallegio cheese & duck proscuitto), margherita and rustica pizzas (thin crust and delicious), ravioli (best of my life) and other pasta dishes. Overall, it's a cozy and casual restaurant that serves great food and wine. Three cons for me: 1) Inconsistent service, 2) I know they're being ""authentic"" with the wine glasses that look like orange juice diner glasses... but I would just like to drink my wine out of a nice wine glass and 3) if you're wearing black or any knit clothing, don't put the napkin on your lap - it leaves lots of fuzz."
"This place has great Italian food, everything was filled with flavor!  My wife had a Caprice salad, my bro had a sausage, I had asparagus risotto, and my other bro had meatballs.  Oh wow.  Everything was delicious!  The only downside to this place was the quantity of food you get for the price.  For $16 I expect a big bowl of sausage, not some plate that is fitting for an appetizer.  I mean, if this were an elite restaurant or if the food was world-renowned, sure.  But not a casual place.  They did have a mob flick on, which sort of made for an interesting night LOL."
Great for accommodating groups.  If I am not going out with more than four people than I don't think of it.  But it is a great choice for groups because it has something for even the pickiest of people. I am deducting a star because sometimes the service is not the quickest.
"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed Quartino's and I've been back several times since.  I want to list the one bad aspect first, the restaurant gets very very noisy.  So if you are looking for an intimate setting, this is not your place.I guess I should also add another hit or miss aspect was that the timing of the food was a little off.  The appetizers come out extremely quickly, but you have to wait for your main course a little longer than you'd expect.  I felt like it's happened every time I've been there.The servers here will explain their plate sizes as ""small plates,"" but I disagree that they are ""small.""  They may not be family style (like Maggiano's), but I think you can expect to get full off a couple appetizers and a main dish.I definitely recommend their bone marrow appetizers, clams, and veal skirt steak.  Their pizzas are ok.  Most of their desserts are very good!"
"Love love love it. $72.80 for FOUR people, including two bottles of wine. We miraculously got seated right away, which I've heard can take a bit, but everything was ready quickly and there was bread to munch. They use glass wine-sized bottles for table water and the sausage pizza is AMAZING. Loved the cheese plate we got (don't recall, something mild/soft). For the price, this is a steal! The only downside would be a wait, but we didn't have one, nor did we feel a rush."
"The short review: it was over-hyped and I was underwhelmed. The long review:We went out with a small group of friends to celebrate a birthday and we made a reservation for 6:30 for a party of six on a Friday. The restaurant was insanely busy and there was already a line of people waiting, which made me relieved that we had a reservation. We ended up being seated on the second floor near one of the kitchens. The atmosphere was extremely loud, and I could barely hear the other people at the table, as everyone in the restaurant was yelling at one another. I would not recommend this for an intimate date, or any sort of dinner where you value conversation.Now, onto the service. The service was extremely lacking. It took about 10 minutes for our server to approach our table, and she didn't really offer up any recommendations or suggestions. She disappeared for awhile, and then some random guy (the owner? manager?) came up to our table and took our drink order on a grubby piece of paper and then just left. Another waiter/server came out and served us our drinks, which also seemed bizarre. Luckily, our waitress came back and we put in our food orders, and she was able to answer a few questions we had about the menu and how much food to order. Our table seemed confused by the fact that the menu is ""family style"" and ""small plates"". Many people ordered too little food and complained of the portion sizes as ""family style"" and ""small plates"" are conflicting terms. My boyfriend and I have been to many tapas bars and small plate restaurants, so we anticipated the way the meal would be served. I think it would be fair to mention that you could go to almost any other restaurant and order an entree per person and share with your entire party and there would be significantly more food for a much lower price. Regardless, people still seemed hungry after ordering an entree per person, but no one wanted to foot a higher bill.As for the food, I seem to be missing something based on the other Yelp reviews.  The duck prosciutto was... lacking. We were served a measly 2 ounces of meat that was over salted and lacking in duck taste. I kept on pairing it with varying amounts of the sauce/jam on the side and that just made it taste worse. I really, really wanted to like this, as I haven't seen it on a menu before, but it was just terrible. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. Next, my boyfriend and I split the Caprese salad. It was pretty standard--nothing amazing, nothing terrible. Lastly, we split the beef short rib which was one short rib. The meat was extremely tender and fell of the bone, and the sauce greatly accentuated the meat. This is the one item I would recommend that everyone try if they dare venture to this restaurant.The other people in our party split a plate of Vodka Pasta which looked pretty standard, and the four people each had a large spoonful of pasta. They also split the grilled calamari which disappeared quickly, so I'm assuming they liked it. For their main entree, they split a pepperoni pizza which was about the size of a medium Dominos pizza, and they each got 2 pieces. They all said it was good, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. The other people in our party tried two of the desserts (the banana split and the profiteroles) and they were large portions and looked good. I didn't try them so I can't comment on it!All in all, I'll never visit this restaurant again, as I feel that your money can be much better spent at any of the other culinary meccas in Chicago. Thanks, but no thanks Quartino."
"My friends and I used to frequent this place all the time! Every time I'm in the city, I always want to go. The wine is delicious, the food delicious, and the atmosphere is great, although it can sometimes get a little loud inside, but when the weather is right, the patio is amazing! My favorite item so far is the cheese fondue!"
"A group of 10 of us dined here for a bachelorette party. This is a good choice for your girls' night: They had plenty of seating to accommodate large parties and the family-style plating lends itself well to groups (and to sharing the check!).That said, when we arrived only 8 of the 9 of us were present; the 9th had been flying into Chicago and was delayed at least 20 minutes. The hostess refused to seat us until the entire party was available. While I think this is a stupid policy with a group this large (after all, they're still holding our huge table and we'd just be buying drinks if we were sitting there), my real problem was with the hostess' incredibly rude attitude. I went to explain the situation to her and she cut me off by saying ""It will be a while."" and then turned to the other hostess to chat, essentially signaling our conversation was done. We ended up getting seated when an unexpected additional guest joined our group, making us the full 9; our now 10th member joined late and simply pulled up a chair. All told, we were not seated until 15 minutes past our reservation on a busy Saturday night even though we arrived on time because of the 1 missing person, and any of us who actually interacted with the hostess was in a foul mood after being treated like crap.Fortunately our waiter, Peter, was out of this world. He kept the food and drinks coming, provided helpful advice on what to order, and even conjured up a cream-puff-and-banana dessert for our bachelorette arranged to resemble a certain part of the male anatomy.Food ran the gamut from awesome (mushroom pizza, asparagus risotto, garlicky bone marrow) to meh (chili shrimp, margherita pizza). Most dishes needed some salt, in my opinion, although I noticed I was reaching for the salt shaker more than others.Prices were fantastic. After eating a mountain of food and sharing four carafes of wine, we each ended up paying just $26. I couldn't believe how little dinner cost!I wish I had asked to speak to a manager about the hostess last night, because the front-of-house role provides a public face for the establishment. That hostess is doing Quartino a huge disservice with her rudeness to customers and potential customers."
"Don't let the fact that this is across the street from a Chili's deter you from stopping in and having a little taste of Italy! I met up with my twin sister here for one of our bi-monthly girl's night out dates. We split a liter of house red wine which came in carafe. Perfect choice to get us in a drunk, giggly and gossipy state of mind (Girls just wanna have fun!).We ordered everything to share and started with a meat, cheese and olive platter. The cheese (creamy and delicious) came with scrumptious bread and a tasty apricot spread. For entrees we split a margherita pizza (not the best I've had but good enough for the occasion) and tortellini in a cream sauce with peas and prosciutto (very rich! so rich and creamy I swear my heart hurt after I ate it. But it was delicious!). For all this food and wine we each only paid about $30. WIN. My sister also bought 4 bottles of house wine from the bar to take home for $6 a piece. DOUBLE WIN.My only regret was that I didn't get a Bellini here. I saw this on the menu towards the end of our meal and the description is still taunting me. Prosecco and WHITE peach juice-just like the first (and best) Bellini I ever had in Venice. They even name dropped the famous Harry's Bar in the menu description! I'll definitely be back soon to try that Bellini! And also for the good n' cheap wine!"
"If you want to have a nice and casual dinner, this is the good place to go ! The food and the wine are good. Prices are very reasonable. The atmosphere is very pleasant and casual. PS: I had a table close to the restroom. It was a real fashion show ! I had a tomato salad with mozzarella, basil and olive oil, it was such a pleasure. At last something fresh and not fried. Then I ordered a carpaccio and a pizza. Everything was very good. The staff is very professional and helpful. The only concern is the bread... hard, dry therefore not so good.Nevertheless, I really recommend this place."
"This review is easy for me, one word ***love***.Ok, I lied, I'm to wordy to keep it to one word. But after my visit a couple of Sunday's ago with two of my girlfriends, that is how I felt. This is one of those places that you walk in and want to sit there all afternoon, drinking wine, eating yummy small plates, and having great conversation.....oh wait, that's exactly what we did!The shtick is easy - get a bunch of stuff to share. And that we did! We started off with the white bean and garlic spread, asparagus risotto, and clams. The bean spread was thick and delicious, served with a nice crusty bread. The risotto was, well, pureed asparagus just like it says. If you only sorta like asparagus you might find it overpowering but I thoroughly enjoyed it. And the clams were piping hot served with a really good white wine & chili broth. Just a hint of spice but not too much. After sharing a litre of chianti, we found ourselves a little hungry still and also got a margherita pizza. I love a good neopolitan pizza and this one did not disappoint.This place makes me wish I worked downtown still so I could stop in (weekly) after work for a nice glass of wine and some good eats. It also makes me kick myself and wonder why I am so late to the game on knowing how awesome this place is....please wait while I remove myself from underneath the rock that I've apparently been living under. Oh well, I'm already planning my next visit and am about 95% sure I will be having my birthday dinner here (yeah, it's end of June but you need to plan these things early!!)."
"Went here for my birthday with a group of 14. This place is very very busy. The wait by the door is a little crowded but I guess there isn't much you can do about that. Food is great. We ordered two pizzas, shrimp risotto, octopus (i didnt care to try that), scallops, pasta, and another dish or two that I can't recall at the moment. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the drinks we ordered would come late or the waiter forgot to bring a drink. Other than that, its a great place to go and share a few dishes."
"I really like Quartino, but it's definitely not a place to go if you want to have a quiet, peaceful dinner. For the amount of dinners, they are good at getting your food out to you quickly. This is an Italian tapas-style place, so it's good to go with a group and order a lot of different dishes to shares. I haven't had anything there that I haven't liked, but I haven't tried everything yet. I highly recommend reservations if you're going for dinner because it gets really crowded and the front is cramped, so it's annoying to have to wait. While he food is good, I do want to warn that it's a bit on the pricy side, especially since the plates are small-ish. Also, it's really loud, so it's great if you want something trendy, but not great if you want to have a meaningful conversation."
"So happy I am moving down the street from Quartino's. It's very affordable, nice meat and cheese plate portions and they always have a great wine special. Try to get a spot outside for great people watching!"
"Bread with olive oil and vinegar, water on the table, Bianco light white wine, bruschette, romaine hearts salad, asparagus risotto, and scarola e fagioli, all vegetarian, $45 for two, without tip (52) lunch labor day 2012.  Crowded, convivial atmosphere.  Brisk service.  Breaking Away (which I love) on constant loop on the flat screen TV, and racing jerseys on the wall."
"This place was phenomenal, food, atmosphere, service all great.  New favorite Italian place.  Make a reservation, the place is packed always!"
Good food but small portions.... I had to eat somewhere else after cause it didn't fill me up.
"Went to Quartino on a Chilly Friday night (last week) and was looking forward to a late night spot to grab some eats and a glass of wine. This place is great. The food is solid, not exceptional but really good. The service was great. It can get really noisy in there, but that's expected as this place is always busy. We had the Margharita Pizza, bone marrow with crostini, asparagus risotto, caprese salad, and an assortment of desserts. Great plates for sharing and trying a bit of this and that. They had a nice selection of wines, and I was a fan of the wine recommended by our server. I'd definitely go back for a nice meal in the city."
"I had such high expectations. After hearing only good things about Quartino I ended up disappointed. The food just really wasn't that good. I came with a group of friends for a birthday, but no one was that impressed. The pasta dishes were decent, but I felt like I could have made them at home. The fondue was okay, but rather bland. The noise level is also pretty loud. This usually doesn't bother me, but so so food coupled with a so so atmosphere just equals a so so experience. I probably will not go back, especially since there are so many better options in the area."
"We used to frequent this place when I lived in Chicago. We always sat in the bar area and always had good service...but they did know us :) The wine is cheap and my experiences with the food have always been good. We ate a number of the appetizers and can't really remember not liking anything. We would frequently go there with larger groups and never had a problem. I recommend the octopus salad (I can't remember if it was a special or is always on the menu).Also, you HAVE to check out the bathroom in this place! The bathrooms are upstairs. It's trippy because for one, they have the Borax powder hand soap, but when your washing your hands you realize you can see into the opposite sexes restroom! You can't see toilets or urinals or anything, but you can make eye contact with people. It's pretty shocking if you don't know they're like that! So, beware all you nasty people that don't wash your hands.....the hand washers can see you (and will probably tell all their friends that your gross)!!!"
"Quartino is a great spot to go for happy hour drinks and snacks with a group of people. I've never sat down for an actual ""proper"" meal here, but both times I've gone, I've sampled a variety of their appetizers and cheap wine.My two friends and I shared the Salumeria tasting for $25 and we each got the $2 veal meatball sliders, which is a really good deal. The sliders were super filling. We also couldn't resist the pancetta wrapped dates. They were fabulous, but then again, how couldn't they be?We also split a bottle of the house wine, which turned out to be much better than I expected.Overall, a ton of food and drinking at a reasonable price. I can't really complain about that."
"Great spot for some wine, pizzas, and delicious plates to share - or order your own plate! This place is a reliable choice."
"Quartino is a safe restaurant to take almost anyone too. The menu is large and I'm certain everyone can find something that appeals to them. The food is pretty good, but I would not say outstanding. When I went, I failed to order with enough variety, such that each dish I ordered contained heaps of arugula. I was completely arugula-ed out when my last dish came. In fact, I am lucky I didn't turn into an arugula. Guess that is my own fault though! They also have lots of cheap wine which is a huge plus."
"I LOVE this restaurant. It's probably the best place to bring a group that I've been in the city.  The staff is so accomodating-  in food recommendations, taking pictures, acting really happy, splitting a check 14 ways which is often scowled at, etc.  Katy S. recommended that our group order by circling items on the menu, which was a great idea for groups. We tried so many things (orechiette, bacon dates, pasta arrabiatta, several pizzas- the one with the pickled veggies is awesome, salmon, mushroom and asparagus risottos) ordered 5 or 6 carafes of wine and limoncello shots and it was still $35 per person including tip. The atmosphere is warm and lively and a great place to have a good time with friends."
"If heaven is a carbohydrate the gates to heaven are good table at Quartino. I wanted GOOD Italian food while I was in Chicago, emphasis on GOOD I was told this was the place to be. It was one of those nights...so we ordered everything! Started with a bottle of wine, served in a carafe with juice glasses, just the way I like it, no fuss. The calamari fresh and delicious, pickled salmon in grappa, delightful, four cheese pizza out of this world and just when I didn't think it could possibly get any better I looked over at the table next to us as say that they had some type of gelto situation that called for my immediate attention. The gelato was so damn good it made me wish that I would have saved more room from the huge dinner I'd just eaten. The biscotti was perfect, the espresso helped me digest the pounds of food I'd just inhaled and although I may not have been hungry for a week it was all worth it!Quartino is a gem. The only thing wrong with it, is that it's not in LA, where I live."
"Loved the food, loved the noisy, fun atmosphere, and pretty darn cheap!   We were visiting from Toronto for a weekend, had dinner their on Saturday night and loved it so much, we decided to go back for lunch Sunday before our flight.  That's saying a lot, because we in all our trips, we have always made it a point to not go back the same place so we can try different things.  This place is fantastic.Cavatelli, Veal Meatball sliders, and the duck proscuitto were particularly delicious.Service was excellent.  The floor manager on the Saturday night actually gave us the tiramisu on the house because we couldn't decide whether to get that or the cannoli.He was right. The tiramisu was amazing."
I love this place for the small plates. I can get a variety of cravings satisfied without breaking the bank! The food was terrific as always. The waitress seemed really distracted and we rarely saw her. The runners and bus boys were really on top of it and truly helped keep up the speed of service. I hope you tip them well! I would definitely come back!
"Great atmosphere. Quite busy. Numerous vegetarian options. Loved the fondue. Besides the fondue, the food was just ok. Ordered the gnocchi, and it was quite dense."
"Probably our favorite dinner spot in the city. The food is delicious (special tip: all of their pastas and risottos can be ordered as half orders)- our favorite is the tortellini alfredo and penne alla vodka. The cheese fondue is a yummy blend of any cheeses they have lying around and never disappoints. Wine is super cheap and generally good. Chocolate cake is to die for.What really sets the place apart is the customer service, though. Any problem we've ever had there (pasta undercooked, really cold sitting under the fan, forgot to give us a to-go box, etc) was met with an apology from one of the managers, a free dish, and a coupon for a free pizza on our next visit. They also let us study in the bar on a really crowded night even though we were just having wine.Definitely my go-to place anytime I don't want to try a new restaurant!"
"Italian tapas is a beautiful concept - cheese, sausages, pastas, pizzas - in shareable quantities so you can indulge in a little bit of each. What's not to love?Well, when the pasta is forgettably blah, the meats were all just a bit funky, and the one thing I was looking forward to (the mushroom risotto), never showed up, very little love was felt for this place when the meal ended. On the bright side:The hot chocolate cake with ice cream was deliciouso!According to Mary D., one of my most excellent tablemates for the evening, the Italian donuts were amazing, as was the rigatoni.Our waiter, Detroit, graced us with free Lemoncello shots (we have no idea what his real name is, but we do know he's from Detroit - alas, the genius nickname). Quartino's was excellent about accomodating our large group, and the service was impressively attentive throughout the evening (for 18 people, I was thoroughly impressed). The Riesling was a pleasant addition to the meal as well.  I think there may be potential here, so it might be worth a second try - you can never go wrong with pizza, right?"
Good food!
Everything we ordered was amazing. I especially liked the eggplant Parmesan and the asparagus risotto. Delicious! Wow! But it was pretty loud so not a good place for a business dinner or anything intimate.
Fantastic service and delicious food. The prices are very great for the quality of food. Had the asparagus risotto which was delicious. This place had a great atmosphere. Would definitely go back.
"Love this place for small plates. Really cozy. Come early in the evening, score a table by the bar. Its a bit noisier, but its like a cozy european tavern where people eat/drink/chat.The veal meatballs = very good. We split a few small plates and a pitcher of sangria. Inexpensive for what I thought is good, real, food at a downtown spot, without the downtown snootiness."
"Had an absolutely delightful belated-birthday dinner with my husband here in August. From start to finish it was wonderful. I had been to Quartino a few times prior over the years for work lunches, but this was my first weekend/dinner experience and the hubby's first time altogether. It was a Saturday night and the place was packed and buzzing! No worries, we had a reservation and were promptly escorted upon arrival to a cozy corner table that shared a booth bench with the adjacent table. I was skeptical about the size of our table, but it proved to work out.The server we had was marvelous! He was super-attentive throughout the dinner. He explained how we should order several plates to share and that everything comes out as it is ready. We had scoped out the menu prior so we already had our menu for the night picked out: Caprese salad, Gnocchi with arugula pesto, Short ribs with salsa verde, and, of course, a bottle to share of the house red wine.The Caprese salad was amazing! Something about the balsamic syrup makes those raw tomatoes (I never eat raw tomatoes) tasty and addictive, not to mention fresh mozzarella being one of my favorite things in the world. I already remembered that the gnocchi was one of my favorites from a previous visit, so it did not disappoint on this occasion, either. The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth-tender-fantastic! Did not really notice the salsa verde, but the meat spoke for itself anyway. We finished the evening with dessert--the torta al cioccolato with vanilla ice cream. Oh man, heaven! Any time you pair hot chocolate cake with ice cream, it is a winner. This cake was wonderfully moist and melty and the ice cream was just perfect. I am almost drooling thinking about it.It was truly a memorable birthday dinner for me. I have to hand it to the staff at Quartino--even though the place is packed and noisy, it's still a wonderful experience. The waitstaff is very attentive and informative, the server for the table next to us even checked in on us on occassion when our server wasn't in the vicinity. I adore this place and will definitely go back. It's affordable, elegant, and fun all at the same time!"
"great food.  great atmoshpere.  great waitress.  i spilled entire glass of wine on my shirt and the guy tending the bathroom went across the street for me, bought tide sticks, came back and completely cleaned my red wine stained shirt.  was overly impressed by this gesture."
"This is probably one of the best tapas bar I've ever been to!!! We had a group of 5 and decided to check this place out because of all of the wonderful feedback that you guys posted and I'm so glad that we did!! Don't be fooled by the appearance when you first walk in because this place can definitely pack A LOT of people! We arrived at this place around 7ish on Wednesday night for dinner and waited about 20 minutes for a table. They were really busy and we were literally drooling when we saw the amazing food on everyone's table. They have 2 bars (upstairs/downstairs) and an extensive wine list at reasonable prices. The decor is really cute and we felt very cozy. Our table was near the back corner so we felt very snug in our group even though the place was very loud! For Food Dishes, we ordered the following items: 1. Grilled baby octopus - I thought the dish was good if you like octopus. I'm not a super big fan of octopus, but it was flavorful and the veggies gave it a nice touch. 2. Steamed Clams - Very good! Highly recommended if you like clams. They give you a pretty large portion and the broth that they steam it with is very flavorful and delicious!! 3. Quattro Stagion - Vegetable Pizza - The pizza was thin crust and a lot bigger than what I would expect for a tapas joint. I thought it was OK, but I was actually really stuffed so I only had about 1/2 a slice. It sounds a lot more tasty on the menu then what we actually got. 4. Penne alla vodka with sausage - Delicious Delicious dish! I'm so glad that we added the sausage which gave this pasta a really good flavor. Be warned that there were some parts of the dish that had more concentration of vodka, but it was soooo good! I highly recommend this one too! 5. Pappardelle con Cavolfiori - Mehhhh... nobody in our group really liked this dish. The noodles are very large and thick and the sauce base had a thick consistency. They only gave a little bit of walnuts and apples and at the end of the night, the waiter saw that we barely touched the dish. When we confessed that we didn't really like it, he ended up taking it off the bill! Isn't that awesome?!! :) 6. Mushroom Risotto - Love this dish!! It's really creamy and the rice is not too mushy. Lots of mushrooms in here and just really addicting! I think I could finish off the whole plate myself :X 7. Caprese - I thought the cheese was really milky for my taste buds. I mean, I love cheese, but I didn't care too much for this one. Also, I thought they were a little skimpy on the vinaigrette. I probably wouldn't get this again. 8. Crispy Calamari - Pretty darn good calamari. Very crispy and flavorful as well! I didn't even need to add sauce!! Yum.... Wines: 1. Pinot Grigio - Pinot is pinot. Good wine :) 2. Rosso - I'm not big on red wine, but this one was light and went well with our food and super cheap! Dessert 1. Coppa al banana - Generous portions of vanilla ice cream with biscotti and caramelized banana. The biscotti was a little bit chewy and not what you would normally expect, however I really liked and it was a great treat to end our dinner! Overall I loved 4 out of the 8 dishes that we got and the dessert was kick ass! I wish I lived in Chicago so that I could try the other stuff out... but I'm sure I'll be in the windy city again! Can't wait!!"
"Pros- PIzza!- Waiter was super nice- Nice ambiance inside and outCons- Tapas weren't that awesome (had bruschette, carpacio, polenta fries)- Bathrooms are upstairs- Pizza took a long timeConclusions- May go back to try gnocchi and another pizza"
It was a very loud environment. The food was so so for the price. Tables are pressed together. The service was excellent. .It's a pretty hip spot with a very vibrant environment but I wouldn't go back for the food.
"Nice and yummy selection of appetizers, cold cuts home made pasta and pizza. They also have hearty mains that are generously portioned. Desserts are suitably decadent.  Everything we've had was delicious and reasonably priced, for the quality. The restaurant is good for groups and family style sharing. Go for the lunch special, which features a choice of starter, pasta and a main for only $25, for two people. Highly recommended."
"I've heard nothing but good things about this place. So I decided to come here to try some world famous Chicago pizza. I was disappointed to find that they don't offer deep dish. So I asked for some local favorites, I was suggest a medium pizza with half Soprano and half sausage. I would first like to say, giardiniera is a supposed Chicago staple. And that if you are from out of town, try it before you buy an entire pizza. I was fortunate to have only half of my pizza with it. It really takes some getting used to, and eventually grows on you. But when I first took a bite into, I honestly thought they sold me a pizza filled with week old sewage. Eat with caution! I also don't think it should have been suggested for me. Luckily the sausage was amazingly good and the service was absolutely amazing. I got to try several of the Goose Island beers and they were all decently good, as Chicago isn't really well known for their beers. Not a bad place to come, the price is not too expensive either."
"I was here for a wedding so we were fine dining the entire weekend - this was the best place we went. Every dish here is superb, from the gnocchi in pesto sauce to the memorable clams over linguini. The portions are generous so don't confuse it for the type of tapas place that will leave you hungry!The wait staff was attentive and never left anyone at our table waiting for another round."
"Quartino is ok, everything is fine - average. The food on the menu looks great but when it arrives it is mediocre, lacking presentation value, flavor and inspiration.I had the mushroom risotto (3/5 stars), gnocchi (4/5 stars) this was the best entree i ordered. Gorgonzola cheese and prosciutto (3/5). Red sangria (3/5) was not that strong; felt watered down."
"This place offers great customer service and the food is good for its price point. The followings are what I had:Minestrone soupSun-dried tomato soup - my favorite of the night. I wished I had another bowl of thatAsparagus Risotto - Surprisingly good. creamy but not overly creamy. Has a nice flavor of the Asparagus which doesn't dominate. A little salty but I think that's personal preferenceGelato ice creamAll in all, I like this place as it has a relaxed environment. More of a place where you and your family can go to enjoy a good meal or with friends. I can see this place being a regular spot that you hit up once a week.One last thing, the customer service is really tentative and warm. This separate from a restaurant to THE restaurant."
"Wow.  So many reviews.Nothing new to add, except to re-emphasize CHEAP WINE!  They have a great selection of Italian wines, served by the quarter-litre (or half, or 3/4 (a bottle), or full), and they're all very affordable for a restaurant.  You can get a tasty half litre (served in a carafe, about 3-4 glasses worth) for $10-15, and some whole bottles only cost $18 or so.So go for a decent Italian meal where you can actually afford wine.  But maybe don't expect stunning food.  It was all good, but not great.  Gnocchi had an arugula (sp?) pesto instead of basil, and I wasn't a fan.  But the tomato soup was hearty and cheap, and the risottos were good.Good spot we would return to, though not incredible."
"Great place to be. Very friendly folks, down home feeling. And the food is excellent. We had the pork shank and it was cooked like grandma did it."
"The tapas were great, the noise was a bit high but the service was great even if it was packed."
"This place is amazing! The food comes out as it's ready, hot, fresh and the real deal. Get the olives and a cheese, and one of the fresh vegetable salads. The pasta is awesome and our waiter was a very cool guy who knew the menu well. Don't forget to leave room for dessert either. The berries and dark chocolate fondue was the perfect ending. If you are ever in Chicago, don't miss this Italian meal, it won't disappoint."
"I love Italian food, so I'm a tough critic. I came for lunch with two friends, and we shared four dishes after the waiter informed us that it was small plates.Portion size was actually larger than the typical small plate, which was fine by me - but three people didn't need more than three entrees. We started with polenta fries, which were really tasty, but really how can you mess up fried polenta?. Pesto Gnocchi - green beens in it tasted...canned. Duck Raghu - under seasoned, noodles were unpleasantly chewyRisotto - pretty good, flavorful cream sauceOverall experience - food was boring, and didn't taste all that fresh. The only dish we almost finished was the risotto, the others were left half full - and I quickly refused a take-out box."
"We came here one night after the Opera and I enjoyed the restaurant for the most part. We started off with the tomato soup (a la french onion soup) which definitely hit the spot. Up next, we decided on the Stagioni (with spicy sausage), which was an absolute blast for my taste buds. The white wine Sangria we had was decent --- had three tiny bits of fruit in each glass. Wrapped up our meal with gelato (chocolate & vanilla) which wasn't half bad. Our server was fairly nice... standard. A couple points of confusion: an Italian restaurant playing mariachi-like music at the bar... lol. Bathroom is upstairs but look for the ""WC"" signs (Water Closet, as seen in Europe). In the bathrooms, you can see the opposite sex washing their hands via a glass window. Odd!"
"Honestly I was expecting worse.  It's a huge place and it's in River North so its goals are evident before you walk in the door.  They want to sell you as much wine as possible, and some shared plates to go with it.  I have to say though, they pull it off pretty well.The food was standard issue Italian-American fare done competently.  Meatballs, pizzas, pastas all tasted good enough though hardly remarkable.  The wine flows fast and cheap, 30 bucks for a liter is a good price even if the wine is a small cut above box wine.  The service was efficient.  I guess what else could you reasonably ask for.I'd return with a group who is looking to tipple a ton of wine on their way to an after dinner engagement, though certainly not as a culinary destination.  I'm glad I tried it though, it serves a purpose."
We came here after 3 days festival food at Lolla.  Here they made the scallop taste like heaven (forgot the name ;).  Naples' style cuisine at its best.
"Highly recommended by Yelp and the hotel we were staying at, we made reservations on a Saturday night for a holiday dinner for the three of us.   We walked to Quartino and arrived about 30 minutes ahead of our reservation time, figuring we would have a drink at the bar.  Much to our delight, they cleared a table and seated us immediately.   Minutes later Aldo was at our table ready to serve.   First time here?  Yes.  Ever done small plate tapas style?  Nope.    No problem, says Aldo, I'll explain it to you.   He did a great job with suggestions and guiding us through the meal.   Service was prompt and friendly but not intrusive.    Nice job Aldo!   Thanks for making us feel comfortable.We started with some spicy salami, Asagio cheese and olives.   Comes with walnut bread, pickled veggies and apricot purée.  I liked the salami..it lived up to its spicy name.   The combo of walnut bread, cheese and apricot purée was delicious.  My wife was eating the apricot purée by the spoonful it was so tasty.My son chose the Cavatelli for one course and I got us the pork shank to share.  The pasta was good, not great.   Nice tomato flavor and cheesy.The pork shank was absolutely fantastic.   It is soaked in wine for like 9 hours and falls off the bone.  It is served over some super creamy mashed potatoes.   I'm still thinking about a forkful of the moist, flavored meat with hot mashed potatoes!   And for only $10!This was plenty of food for us.    Along with some cocktails total bill was about $80.   Very reasonable.We had a great time.   The restaurant is very loud, but I liked it.  A nice high energy vibe; celebratory.   Oh yeah, they also had ""A Christmas Story"" playing on the TV.   We laughed through dinner and mimed the lines.   ""You'll shoot your eye out!""  ""Bumpases""."
This place is delicious! I absolutely LOVED it!! And the bill wasn't bad either!
"This place gets a little crazy. The entrance area where everyone waits to be seated gets so packed, you feel like a sardine. I love the energy inside, everyone's in a good mood. Free bread and olive oil makes me happy. The food is decent, but I'd have to say reasonably priced. I've been here 3 times and always had a good time.Come for the atmosphere, crowd and candles, not for the food."
"was in chicago on business. unfortunately I was alone, but didnt want that to spoil the opportunity for some good eats. found this place a few blocks from my hotel.went in about 9:30pm on a wednesday night, the place was packed but they did have room for one :) sat down and looked at the giant menu, i was a bit overwhelmed by all the choices as it all looked so good. i settled on a pizza, the trevisella ( prosciutto, radicchio and balsamic syrup) it was completely different from anything ive ever had, but was delicious.service was definitely a bit slow, but i got everything i needed in timeas others have mentioned, this place is extremely loud, because of the high ceilings and open layout. i want to go back and try all the small plates."
"A solid 4 star place in my opinion.  The food was really quite good and the service was superior.  On the downside, the ambiance was a bit mixed.  We went on a Friday night at 9pm and this place was PACKED.  Not only packed with people but also with tables.  So, if you like to have your space...I wouldn't recommend it.  Otherwise, I found that it was worth it.The scallop dish was amazing, the spinach pizza was sooo good (they give you a stick of fresh parmesan so you can grind it on yourself...very nice touch) and they had a great selection of wines to choose from and in different sizes! Our server handled my picky-assed drink order (Kettle One Gimlet with only a very small dash of the Rose's Lime) and the blew it on the first one but got it right the next couple of times.  Rather than be annoyed at me (and I'm good natured about it...just picky) he seemed cool with it and worked to get it right.  Very great waiter, too bad I'm horrible with names otherwise I'd recommend him.The decor in general is inviting, albeit packed, but the one turnoff was that they had TVs places around the dining room area.  This was disappointing as it took the level of sophistication of the place down a few notches...Americans get enough TV already...we could use more places without them.Anyway, the bar area was also packed but looked like a nice place to grab a bite and chill out with some friends or family (not kids).  Lots of darker woods for the furniture and bar, which is always warm and inviting to me.  I saw there was an upstairs but I was too scared to go up...you never know who's up there waiting to jump you. Ha! But really, I just didn't go up because I didn't have a reason to, so have fun exploring."
Food was delicious.  Great service.  Table was a little small but that didn't stop us from enjoying the ambience.  Highly recommend Pancetta stuffed with gorgonzola dolce & drizzled with honey and the sun dried tomato soup.
"Definitely the place to go when I have visitors in town for the ""touristy"" experience (and it's two min from my place). The wait can be ridiculous so definitely make a reservation ahead of time. One time, I tried to make a dinner reservation on a Saturday afternoon for that night and couldn't get one until 9:30pm. I don't like to eat that late, but trust me, the food is so yummy we definitely kept that reservation. I had always figured that it would be an expensive restaurant, but it's really quite affordable. Lots and lots of vegetarian options (gotta love Italian food!) and delicious bread. The pizzas are my favorite (about $10-12) and one is enough for two people. Definitely play around with ingredients if you know that you like pizza in a particular way. My only qualm is with dessert since the one time I actually had stomach space for dessert, the gelato we ordered had a ton of ice crystals in it. Not good especially when I think it was like 8 dollars. So I won't have another dessert there but that's ok because there's other restaurants around for me to get dessert at (Starbucks anyone? haha). Overall though, I keep going back. It just loses a star because of the wait times and the sad desserts. Definitely check it out!"
"Finally, fried calamari done right. That might have been enough to warrant a 4-star review, but wait ... there's more ...The place was packed at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday night. I highly recommend making reservations at least a week ahead of time. I was able to get a good sampling of food because of items ordered by 7 other girlfriends (eventually) seated at the first floor bar. Maybe I should have read other reviews before going -- I probably would have found out about the virtually non-occupied 2nd floor bar option.Nevermind that... the wine and food were delicious. I'm mad because I didn't try more. A quarter liter of wine was an ample amount for me. I ordered my new wine love the MALBEC ($9). It was pretty good. I tried someone's ROSSO DI MONTEPULCIANO and it was the same, just less heavy. I ordered the VEGETARINA PIZZA ($12) and it was tasty, with a nice crispy crust. It's hard to go wrong with arugula and eggplant on pizza. Then, throughout the night I snatched bites of the handmade cheese TORTELLINI, POLENTA FRIES, as well as two decadent desserts -- COPPA AL BANANA  (Carmelized Banana, Vanilla Gelato, Biscotti, Whipped Cream, Chocolate Sauce, & Shavings) and TORTA AL CIOCCOLATO (Hot Chocolate Cake & Vanilla Gelato). The CRISP CALAMARI was truly the least rubbery (i.e. well-cooked yet best quality) calamari that I've tasted in a long time. Due to my repeated bad experiences with the dish, I was hesitant to buy it myself. I'm certainly glad a friend did instead! My bill was about $28, including tax & tip.At the bar, the service was prompt and knowledgeable. I have no complaints there.The crowd was a challenge. I just wish the hostesses, when I stated that I was expecting a group of 9 and was unable to get reservations (since the place was booked), had suggested going to the upstairs bar. I did speak to the manager at some point, who politely explained our options. Also, I appreciated the sincere efforts of the 2nd floor bartender to try to accommodate our party. All in all, we had a great time. The crowd did bring a great energy to the place. Downtown on a Saturday night, what did I expect? A bustling, mostly middle-aged environment, complete with a great overall experience was cool enough to make me want to go back."
Really overrated.Food was bland and salty. Worst place we stooped in Chicago.Cheese plate was good though.
"We went with a group of eight on a very busy Friday night. We had an 8pm reservation and arrived on time. While waiting, after only about 15 minutes the manager brought out glasses and two bottles of wine to keep us occupied. We were seated just a few minutes later. I will let other reviewers comment on the food,I will simply say that the managers gesture was a rarity of exceptional customer service."
My Server was Awesome!!!! But unfortunately the food was disgusting.. Watered down Alfredo sauce and horrid Onions on my Pizza. Yuck!!!!
"Italian tapas in a ""New York Italian bistro"" atmosphere - white tile walls, hanging meats, a bit noisy, crowded.  Missed the Yelp event here so decided to check it out with my friends.  We all agreed that it was fine, but nothing much to write home about. Arrived on time for our reservation and we were sat immediately - that was very nice.  As others have said, this place seems to be confused about who it's catering to - couples, groups of friends, families, they were all there.  It's too loud to be a good date joint, too crowded to be a great place for groups or kids.  Very reminiscent of an Italian place I once went to in the meatpacking district in NYC, which was less confused about its clientele - rich young professionals and artists in suits and mini-skirts.  This place was thankfully less pretentious, we didn't find that kind of person here, even on a Friday night.I chose the Grapefruitcelli martini - it was fantastic, just the right touch of sweet.  Highly recommend.Food - The Good:- pork belly - thick cuts of meat, thin apple ring slices, cinnamon apple compote, this was very good- fondue w/ bread - my favorite of all our selections, if you like cheese and you like bread then you can't miss this!  They offer other dippers for an extra fee (veggies, apples, etc)- antipasti: duck carpaccio, olives, gorgonzola - all were very good. The duck was a little oily but tasty and unusually good. The 3 kinds of olives were all very unique. The gorgonzola was the thickest we'd ever had, very creamy and good, less stinky than I thought it should be. Served with tiny breads, apricot spread, and some sort of jelly-like spread.Food - The Not-So-Good: - mushroom risotto - meh.  A little too soupy, and not enough mushroom flavor for me.- shrimp - nothing special about this, shrimp were chewy/overcooked- calamari - also totally unspecial, served with marinate sauce so I missed the kick of cocktail sauce that I prefer- ravioli - heavy on the meat flavor.  I'm on the fence about this one, so you'd probably need to try it for yourself.Food, plus 3 martinis and 2 beers came to $134 plus tip.  A pricy night out for 3 people but not outrageous.Staff was great.Tables were strangely laid out - some were way too close, but then you'd have a gap so big you could practice your breakdancing.Bathrooms upstairs, follow the ""WC"" signs (that's ""Water Closet"" for the Americans).Valet is $12, quick car return.  Not really any better parking options in the area."
"Great atmosphere, super friendly waiters, but average food. The gnocchi was dense and the crudites tasted as if they had been defrosted, then steamed. And what's with the horrible small ribbed glasses for wine? The fondue and scallops were good though.One tip- if there is a long wait to sit in the main restaurant, just sit in the bar area! Seating there is first-come first-served."
"Good lord!  This place is crazy, crazy awesome that is.  It is hopping on the weekend, so get a reservation.We are from out of town and tried this place on a recommendation from a Chicagoian friend.  It lived up to the recommendation.  We were seated immediately and ordered carafes of very moderately priced wine.  Then we tried the olive sampler, a salami, and a cheese (which came with an apricot spread).  All were fabulous.  I would have liked to try more salami.  The mains are served family style so we decided to try 4 different homemade pastas - the tortellini with prosciutto, the pasta Bolognese, the lasagna, and the pasta with braised beef (ribbon noodles).  All were freaking amazing!  Wished we could have tried a pizza too, but the pasta looked too good.  I would come back here in a second.  Best of all - the bill was fairly low!"
"Very, very loud, but the food was pretty good. This seems like it would be better as a tapas bar with a bunch of friends to have drinks,."
Love the postcards.
"*ONLY SPEAKING OF THE BAR*First off, AMAZING DRINKS.I could practically live off the Espresso Martini.Awesome place but I may be bias because I was there with an awesome group of people.Regardless, will DEFINITELY be coming back."
"Italian small plates, what's not to love?  Large menu with tons of options and quality wine at reasonable prices.We started with the nothing special spinach salad and tasty calamari.  Went with the beef filets and house made ravioli for dinner.  It was just my wife and I so we went weren't able to try as many things as we would have liked, but as I watched food come out for other tables, I would say that the pasta dishes looked far better than the protein driven dishes.Two of the better parts of the meal were the chianti wine special and the coppa al banana dessert.  I'd go back just for that.  Do note that it is extremely loud in the dining room so don't go with any of your soft talking friends."
"love the ambiance, the flurry of activity and the food here. i came here a couple weeks ago, only to realize that i ate here on my first trip to Chicago 3 years ago! what a pleasant surprise, because i had fond memories of the food here (although i wasn't a yelper then, so i totally forgot i'd been here before). only difference is, i came here with a bigger group the second time so more to share!awesome possum dishes:- cheese fondue: being asian, i'm not the biggest fan of fondue, but this knocked my socks off.- orrechiette: well-seasoned and tasty- spinach: lemony and garlicky, can ward of all the vampires you want- both red and white sangria: red wonwe also got a pizza, which was ok, but those were definitely the standouts. i'd go back!"
"Went here tonight for a casual Italian dinner. The place is packed and loud, but they seated us off in a little corner where we felt comfortably isolated in our own little space. Food is served meant to share so we ordered caprese salad, pizza and risotto. We also ordered a half liter of wine (followed by a 1/4 liter) and fully enjoyed it all. Food and service were both good and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to friends. Total for two with salad, pizza, risotto and a full carafe of their best chianti was around $110, so not bad at all!"
"Wow, I'm at a loss to explain how I could have such a different opinion of Quartino's than most Yelpers.  I think the food at Quartino's is ""meh"" at best.  There are many many other restaurants in downtown Chicago that are better for Italian and/or better for wine.   Our service was fine:  not great, not bad.In a nutshell, go somewhere else."
Loved this place.  I visited on a Monday night and sat on the patio.  The food selection was great and the ambiance was perfect.
"The pasta was quality:1) cavatelli with tomatoes, basil and fresh ricotta. Fresh and creamy!2) gnocchi with green beans and arugula pesto. Melt in your mouth good. The quality of the handmade pasta was worth it. But the rest, not so much:1) polenta fries. Underwhelming. The red pepper sauce was bright, but not enough to make these awesome.2) bread. Kinda tasteless until you put it in olive oil. 3) romaine salad. It was basically romaine with parmesan shavings. Hardly any dressing."
"I judge a restaurant by its ability to deal with large groups. And if the group involves 12 hungry and happy (read tipsy) women, all raving about their meal a week later, I can't not write a review! The food is among the best Italian I've eaten in Chicago and it doesn't burn a hole in ones pocket. They have an extensive food and drinks menu to choose from and the service is great. My favs - The vegetarian gnocchi, margherita pizza & funghi pizza."
They would not seat us even though part of our party was stuck in traffic. The service was slow and the food came out sporadically. They say its a tapas place but it's more Italian. Did not enjoy my experience here and will most likely not come back.
"Very loud and a bit cramped, but the pizza was great and so were the dates (appetizer). The service was very good."
"We went to Chicago for the weekend in October and had amazing weather. It was literally 60-70 degrees this day and 50-55 that night. We had been to Quartino a few years back and remembered it was cheap yet good so decided to give it another try. As we approached the restaurant we saw everyone sitting outside! In October! In Chicago! So we did too of course! It was awesome. The pizza was simple but perfect, thin crust margherita. We had a flight of wine for I believe $11, shared that got about 2 good glasses each. Then had salad with balsamic dressing and calamari with an even cheaper wine that wasn't as fantastic but still good. All in all the impossible-to-plan-for kind of experience that I utterly adore."
"Just OK. We were in Chicago for a few vacation days and walked by this quiant looking restaurant in the early evening. We were seated right away inside. Noise level very high but that was ok, we expected that. Our server was very nice bringing a booster seat for my DD's American Girl doll, so they get points for being kid friendly. I ordered the lasagna which looked great but was just too salty and pretty much tasteless. All I could taste was salt! Wine was just ok. Probably would not go back, too many other restaurants to try."
"I absolutely LOVE this place! I've been going there since I moved back to Chicago a few years ago and have brought a ton of people there just to check it out. The food is amazing, the service is great and the atmosphere is super relaxing. Every time I go, I order the arugula pizza, which a great option whether you're a meat eater or prefer to go veg. On my most recent visit, I tried to step out of the box and started with the eggplant bruschetta, as well as bone marrow...which was something I've never had...and was AMAZING! We finished with cappuccinos (also extremely tasty) and their homemade tiramisu. The lighting wasn't too bright and created a relaxing ambiance that made us feel like we were at home. Also, their pizza crust is something I haven't found in the city. I'm a Chicago girl that loves her pizza, so I'm picky about what I order. My boyfriend drove out to surprise me one weekend and called Quartino ahead, asking if they would sell us their dough to make homemade pizzas as a surprise for our anniversary. Nick, the manager, told him that was no problem and even threw in a bottle of wine for us since we were celebrating with food from our favorite place! I highly recommend Quartino for a first date, anniversary, birthday and more!"
"This place was hopping when we dined here on a recent trip to Chi-town!   Bar is trendy and cute albeit packed which is a good thing I guess!   We were sat right away when we were ready.  Very knowledgeable waiter really knew his menu!   It's a ""tapas"" style Italian place where plates are small for sharing but they also have traditional menu fare.  The calamari was amazing, almost melted in your mouth.  We also shared the goat cheese stuffed dates wrapped in procuitto and drizzled in honey, TO DIE FOR!  The side of meatballs was a meal in itself also.  We also shared a traditional pasta and alfredo sauce that the hubs ordered. The only downsize was MY pasta, red sauce never arrived.   40 mins later the waiter was so embarrassed and when I told them to not worry about it at that point it arrived.  The manager comped that dish as well as sent over their sugared donuts for dessert which was a wonderful gesture.  More than made up for the mishap!  We will def be back on our next trip to Chi-town!"
"Have heard great things, so finally got to try Quartino and I was not disappointed.  Food was excellent.  It was obvious that everything was fresh, and nothing beats fresh parmesan cheese.  I highly recommend the lasagna even if you're not usually a heavy lasagna person (I'm not either)."
"Friendly, helpful staff that were pretty attentitive to your needs. they have a good selection of wines and small plates  and are also pretty vegetarian friendly. good portion sizes and a nice way to spend happy hour in the evening. perpahs the next time around i'll get to sit in for a full on meal."
"Love, love!!! My biggest tip, make reservations so worth it! We had a late reservation on a Saturday evening, the place was packed but our table for 10 was ready and waiting for us. We were quickly seated. The service was attentive, helpful and offered suggestions. I love the decor and the window in the bathroom between the guys and gals. Sangria's were great. Every dish we tried was a HIT. One of my favorites was the veal meat balls, super good. This setting was perfect for a large group to pass around the dishes because if it wasn't my favorite then it was some one else's. We ordered a salad to start (bread was always on the table) and then the ensue of dishes came from the kitchen. As to the complaints its loud, yes it is but isn't that the sign of a booming restaurant? As the evening went on it did quiet down. This was a huge hit for us and everyone enjoyed themselves. BIGGEST TIP, MAKE RESERVATIONS!"
"If a Geurnsey cow and oyster Rockefeller fused in the Hadron collider, it would culminate in the Roasted Bone Marrow.  God particle or creative tapa?"
"We visit Chicago a couple times a year, we have a few spots we visit every time. Frontera, Purple Pig, Sun Wah, Jake Melnicks to name a few. Quartino was recommended by a friend days before heading up from Indy (FOOD HERE NEEDS HELP) We were able to get a reservation either 6:00 PM or 10:00 PM Friday decided on 6:00. Early but OK. when we arrived there was already a line at the door, we checked in and was seated within minutes. Our waiter promptly greeted us explained the restaurants concept and recommend house signature cocktails lemoncello and grapefruitcello awesome. We proceeded with our feast of freshly prepared, well presented and great tasting food. Went back next night late for Espresso Martinis and dessert. Sorry I have missed out on this place. We will plan better next trip and get a later reservation. Mangia Mangia !!!!!!"
"Both of the times I've been here on a Tuesday night, already (more than) slightly tipsy after a tasting at another bar earlier. Usually, I want a bit more to imbibe as well as some pizza since you can't just drink your dinner.Since it was still pretty busy in the main dining room, I end up sitting at a high top in the bar area with a friend where we've had fantastic service each time. What surprises me though is how reasonably priced their pizzas and drinks are, which is what constantly draws me in. Well that, and the fact that it's right on the route back to my place after the tasting.Convenient? Yes. Well-priced? Yes. Quick? Yes. Count me in, please."
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago.  My girlfriend and I go here pretty regularly.  Great atmosphere, awesome waitstaff, and delicious food.  I have probably had most of the items on the menu, and have never had one I didn't like. Best of all, this place is not expensive at all, especially considering the quality of the service and food.  They also have a really nice wine list.  Really a great place for a date as well.  Thanks Quartino for being such a great spot."
"Wow, went to this place on a whim and man was impressed! The whole tapas menu style was REALLY fun and provided us the opportunity to try many different dishes. I have to say that we were VERY impressed with the food! Had the Rigatoni, which was delicious, the Caprese salad which was very fresh and light, and the Asparagus Rissoto which was perfectly prepared. All in all I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and a great atmosphere. I'll be back again soon!"
"This is my husband and I's guaranteed good time date night spot. We have probably been 15+ times.Do you like cheese? (Please say yes, if you want to remain my friend.) If you like cheese then you will LOVE the cheese fondue at Quartinos. In fact, it might be laced with crack because I think about this fondue more than is a healthy amount.  Every time we go, I say I am going to get something different but have yet to be able to resist the cheese temptation!Do you like to drink copious amounts of wine? (Again, please say yes.) Quartinos has a great wine list with extremely reasonable prices. I have never been disappointed in our wine selection.Other things at Quartinos that are great: the atmosphere, all the pizzas and the cheese list!!Go here- eat cheese, drink wine and have a good time!"
"What a doozie! Yelpers what gives? Over 600+ reviews and a solid 4 star rating. Not the night we visited! Justin S. pretty much hit the highlights and lows of our dining experience, but I will add a bit more. Here's my advice for Quartino ... I don't mind the loud and bustling atmosphere. It's fine, it makes me feel that we've really picked a great restaurant. What I do mind though, is constantly having my chair bumped and 2 out of the 4 chairs at our table not even accessible to sit at. Make it a smaller two top table and save us both the grief. Waitstaff, hustling, but not extremely attentive. I hate having to flag down people for water. If you notice that our water glasses are constantly empty and you can't keep up maybe bring two bottles of water next time. And please, please, please don't come to the table and ask if we are ready for dessert when half of our meal hasn't even been served. Ohh, you are shocked it never made it to the table. Well, maybe if you would check back with your table then you'd realize it had never been delivered. Flavor of items ordered (when they FINALLY made it to the table). Total let down. Beef Carpacio ... well this item never officially made it to the table as we were notified they were out of it. Calamari - not fresh and overcooked. Bigoli was served luke warm at best - just another disappointment. Pork Marsala, once again, not hot, pork overcooked and absolutely no flavor. The marsala sauce had a nice flavor, but the pork was obviously not cooked or marinated in this sauce. The antipasta platter that almost never made it to the table ... pretty substandard. Bruschette the highlight of the entire experience (we should have started and stopped here)."
"I dream about this place from time to time! The pizza was beyond amazing for the price [so was the calamari], AND a bottle of wine! Great location on State Street as well! Our waiter was the BEST, I think his name was Will.  Can't wait to return!!!"
"i came to chicago to visit, and out of the 3 day stay, i'd have to say this was the best place we've eaten at - even better than giordano's!the food was delicious, we got fondue which was amazing! best meal i had in chicago.  we also got pizza and meatballs which were also good.  the service was great, the bathrooms were interesting and different, and it was open til late.  it's a must try place in downtown chicago!"
"Edit 6/13/07:I've now been to Quartino at least 15 times and I think I've tried everything on the menu. Everything continues to be absolutely delicious, but my favorites include:Veal MeatballsFungi PizzaShrimp (can't remember the exact name, but I think it's one of the only shrimp dishes on the menu)GnocchiFried CalamariYou can't go wrong with any of the above! Mindy S and I celebrated her bday at this new ""tapas"" restaurant tonight. I'm not the biggest fan of tapas, but I really enjoyed this restaurant.  We read Aubrey K's review before heading to Quartino so we made sure to order the veal meatballs and the eggplant salad she recommended. Both were great, although I think I preferred the veal meatballs. We also ordered the pesto gnocchi (my favorite dish of the night) and the seared scallops. Everything was phenomenal and left us very full! Service was great as well and the sweet waitress brought over a delicious dessert in honor Mindy's bday (without me even asking her to).  You would also expect this restaurant to be pretty expensive (especially since it's owned by Gibson's and Hugo's), but I found the prices to be very reasonable."
"Decided to go to lunch here today, after a doctors appointment.  And let me just say..... Food was good!  I love the bruschetta and margarita pizza.   If you get my new fav server, Stephanie you are so lucky.  For just coming here by myself and having lunch. She highly recommend items that would be fit for one person and is not trying to have you spend so much $$$$.  Quartino, good job on having her on staff.  She is great with speaking with customers."
"I'm pretty sure this place REALLY NEEDS another review.  Anyway, it was fantastic.  All of it.  I wish I'd gone when I first decided to add it to my 'must visit' list, which must have been like 4 or 5 years ago.  One caveat:  It's LOUD.  But I would deal with bagpipes surgically inserted in my eardrums for some of those Italian donut things right about now OMG BEST DESSERT EVER.  Seriously, if you don't order them when you go I will come to your house and shake you like a baby (note: Never shake a baby).I might not have mentioned how completely and utterly reasonable everything is.  To wit: bottle of Ruffino Chianti:  TWENTY ONE!  ONE!  TWENTY ONE DOLLARS.  And...they offer wine by the 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 (bottle sized) and full liter.  AND it's priced accordingly.  Which is...about the coolest thing I've ever seen a restaurant do.  I kind of love it."
"I usually eat family style at this two-story Italian restaurant in the Gold Coast area of Chicago.  You'll notice the white tiles, which came from old NY subway stations and hospitals.  The tortellini with alfredo and peas is rich, creamy, and delicious."
"Best Italian food in the city. Risotto anything is sure to please, especially the Asaparagus. Mozzarella and Tomato appetizer is always fresh and simply the bomb. Lovely atmosphere and extremely reasonable prices for the quality of food/drink you are getting."
My top choice tapas place. The dishes are Italian influenced. The off the menu tiramisu is the best!
"OMG. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the noise level. The food was out of this world delicious. I took my mom here when she came to visit from Pennsylvania. I wanted to do a nice, formal dinner one night so after some research I decided on Quartino based on price, location and menu selection. The menu really is extensive. It's mostly ""small plates"" to be shared, but I found the portion size to be just right. I don't know if I've ever had a better chicken alfredo rigatoni. Yes, it's a rather standard, simple dish, but it can be ruined so easily. Quartino just nailed it. My boyfriend had the veal osso bucco and was floored. My mom had the spaghetti and meatballs and was impressed. I tried the sauce which was killer. A little on the spicy side and very unique. Overall, the food was probably some of the best I've had in the city. The atmosphere is romantic, but you can go there dressed casually and not feel out of place. It is crowded, as the tables are positioned very close to one another and the noise level was very, very high when we were there (7pm on a Saturday, I believe). It was honestly the only complaint I have and I guess it is to be expected at a place in the loop on a weekend during the dinner rush."
"I've been to Quartino multiple times so it's clearly good enough to try but it's certainly not the best Italian in town. It feels and tastes like your run of the mill chain restaurant Italian food. But if you're downtown and need a descent place to eat, Quartino's will likely do the trick."
A decent place for small plates - cheaper than Purple Pig but you can taste the difference. We went late on a Friday night and it was very full. The pizza margherita was good though pretty standard. The duck prosciutto was earthy and unique. The caponata was a little too bitter. Overall we weren't blown away by the food but it was quite lively late at night if you like enjoy that sort of atmosphere.
Awesome selection of small plates and wines!
"Walked in on a busy Saturday night and our party of 3 was seated immediately. Great service. The prosciutto wrapped figs were amazingly tasty. Pizza had a crisp thin crust, nice sauce and house cured pepperoni. The environment was bustling and our waiter, Peter, kept the food coming and was very helpful with the menu.I definitely return, would consider bringing my kids earlier in the day. Very reasonably priced (~$60 (w/tip) for 3 small plates, a pizza and drinks for 2).WARNING: Bachelorette Party Central"
"I have to admit, this place was a ton of fun because of the group I went there with, but it's good without the group too. All Italian tapas and all good stuff. Some dishes are better than others but nothing is bad.Generous wine pours and decent prices on beer. The energy here is awesome too. I've had better food at better prices, but overall I enjoyed it."
"I really like this place...Just cause I belive appiteziers are the best meal and with Tapas I feel like im eating apps all night long.We had a reservation at 730 but we got done with our tour early and decided to try to get in early..with our luck we did.We started with a 1/2 litre of wine wich provided us both with 2 glasses each...so  a full litre probably would have got us through the meal (we ordrered another later on). We had the sampler and picked our meats Duck prosetuo and Soppressta both were really goood! The cheeses we got werent as amazing but the cucumber salad they give with it is really good, as well as the artichokes, the girdanera and peppers were just all right. Next we had the tortelini and it was soooooo amazing who knew just cheese would be that good. That was followed up by a lackluster calamari( i wont get again). After that we waite\d...and waited..and waited for the final dish of pork belly...it was well worth the wait. They actually didnt let us pay for it since it was so long a wait although we didnt even mention it. All and all i would definetly come again and try as much different things as possible."
"Old fashioned details.Awesome food.""Happening"" atmosphere.Cheap.What else can you ask for? Oh yeah, bring this place to my hometown!"
"Mmmmmmmmm, italian food served tapas style!  Who would have ever thought?!  This place was GREAT!Came here with the boyfriend and we got the lamb shank and the tuscan chicken risotto.  Then for dessert we got the french style doughnuts!The lamb shank was a single lambshank which was great because with me and italian food, I sometimes will get tired of what I'm eating and I won't finish, but here, since it's tapas style, we all can order a dish and share it!  The lamb was great!  It fell off the bone so nicely that I didn't even have to use a knife.  The sauce was a citrusy sauce which tasted so delicious!The tuscan chicken risotto was ok for me, I wasn't that great of a fan, I think it was too cheesy for my taste but my boyfriend said it was really good to him.The french doughnuts were the best!  It was served with powdered sugar and dark chocolate sauce!Not only do they have great food but they also have great prices!!!"
It is indeed loud but somehow it works to help to increase the energy level of the table. The waiter did an ok job making some suggestion on the dishes to order. Wanted to order their sushi grade scallops but we went 2 days earlier than their next shipment arrival date so it was a bummer. Veal meatballs was great in flavor and the texture is fluffy and light which was great. Pork belly was ok but the apple compote had good vinaigrette taste balanced out the fat but not as fabulously melt-in-the-mouth great as expected. Overall it's a good place to dine but I didn't find the urge wanting to go back soon.
"Love the food at this place, can always get nice Italian staple dishes. I enjoy the rowdy atmosphere, and the whole bustling environment. My favourite dish is the Stefano pizza, with sausage. I like coming here on a Sunday afternoon, when you can actually talk. Service is generally attentive, and I love the sampling selections you can choose from. really enjoy the polenta fries as well."
Highly recommend the food and atmosphere. Chicago needs this place!
"By far my favorite restaurant in the area. Not great for a quiet date night but wonderful with groups. Order a bunch of dishes, prepare to overeat, and enjoy."
"Location, price taste!   Downtown Chicago just off the MM.The men's bathroom is too much - there's a window that looks partially into the women's bathroom.  Old school bathroom attendant warms the water in the sink for you when you wash, and hands you a fresh towel."
"Great place to come for a date if you get reservations ahead of time. The veal meatballs were very good as was everything we got, but the main reason to come here would be the atmosphere - It's very busy and alive in a good way on Friday or Saturday night and is a great place to start a night..."
"Came here with my lady friends on a Friday night. We somehow plowed through the huge crowd gathered near the front and got ourselves a table. We ordered a $20 'bottle' of a light red wine and got the olive plate to share (we had already had dinner beforehand). For the ambiance and location, this place is a) super affordable and b) DELICIOUS. I always avoided this place because I thought it would be incredibly pricey. Also, this place is not my usual ""scene"" - I counted at least a billion girls in North Face coats and dudes who looked like they played football and/or some other sport in high school, but I think that's why I like this place. The only odd thing was the bathroom attendant upstairs in the ladies room- definitely not used to that.I hear the Penne Alla Vodka is great, and this place is awesome for small groups and for general hanging out. Will be back soon!"
"Although Quartino's IS a bit on the pricey side, I can't help but absolutely love this place. I love coming here with my friends (the bigger the party the better- and the more variety in food!!) for the delicious small plate italian tapas. All of the selections that they have here are absolutely wonderful and the ambiance is great for small groups (not too loud). It does get a bit busy so getting there earlier if you have a larger party is always a good idea, and keep in mind that there isn't a ton of space in Quartino's, so you might end up sitting on top of one another (which I don't mind at all!). All in all, completely worth the trip!"
Great place for really good Italian food and drinks before going out with your group to the clubs/bars/etc. Perfect for Friday/Saturday night. It can be loud and busy so just be prepared. Definitely not an intimate date kind of place.
"As others have noted, a bit touristy but fine.  Service was good.  I thought the thin crust Margarita pizza was just ok.  The cheeses and lives were excellent.  The small plates/share concept is everywhere it seems--but we like it.  Not sure I will search it out as Chicago has so many fabulous choices, but it's fine."
"The summer out door dining is nice given that it's on state street so you get the nice views along with the speeding taxis, the loud honking and the occasional police sirens.  The food was OK, it was not something to talk about.  The wine was great though. We got the cheapest read on the menu, half liter and had a great time chatting it up while sipping on some good cheap wine. The wrapped dates were way too greasy and had little cheese flavor to it.  The lamb Mostaccioli sauce was not good and had convoluted taste of sugar and tomatoes.  The scallops were fairly decent but the price was a little steep given that their flavoring was nothing to match it. I would recommend it for wine and maybe dessert with some great company while enjoying the lovely Chicago outdoor dining weather. Other than that I will not be back unless I HAVE to."
"Took some friends visiting from out of town and told them we were going to an ""Italian"" tapas place, which they had never been to. In fact, they thought I was confused and told me tapas places are usually Spanish.  Fair enough, but I showed them! At Quartino, you get delicious Italian tapas. It is a bit pricey, but when you go with a group and share a number of dishes, it ends up being very doable. The outdoor seating is fun for people-watching (read: herds of tourists) when the weather is good, although the wait for a table may be a bit painful. Quality of service isn't always consistent, so I never know what to expect in that respect ... but it has never been what I would consider bad.Overall, always a satisfying dining experience."
"The restaurant was beautiful designed, with an old world feel & decor. I thought the big screen TVs in the dining areas unnecessary, because they were distracting the diners from each other. On first look, the dishes seemed incredibly cheap, especially for the location, but then I realized they were tapas portions. We orderedfried polenta - good idea, but just okmushroom risotto - good tasting, but has no texturetagliatelle alla bolognese - the tagliatelle was quite large & doughy, the sauce okbeef short ribs - wow, melts under the forkroasted baby octopus - seriously, 3 pieces only??lemon cake with lemon gelato - wow, totally summery & deliciouszeppole - italian donuts were amazing with honey or chocolateOverall, the desserts were MUCH more impressive than the other courses. We watched the zeppole walked by countless times throughout dinner, and they were as delicious as I imagined. Bravo for the desserts!"
Duck ProsciuttoPork Belly SpantinoAll excellentPastas are good as well as seafood and small meat dishesNot NY/NJ Bread and if with big group place 2 separate orders or u can be rushed
"The first time I came here a few years ago I was totally unimpressed.  I could not for the life of me undertsnad the draw of this place. This time I came here with 5 friends and we had a great time.  We are all big fans of tapas, so either Spanish or Italian...we are happy! We were seated at a round table in the corner, so despite the place being very crowded and loud, we had no problem having a discussion.  Just ask to be seated near a window or wall, which can help with sound. We ordered a variety of food...9 different dishes and we liked everything we had.  Offcourse some things were better than others, but I believe that is truly a matter of taste. Also, ask how many pieces of something you get, since you maybe shocked at the small portions or several pieces you get wityh certain plates, especially if you are there with a group that is sharing all the items. We did have one small issue  -  they had run out of several items that we had ordered...that was a bit annoying, since that should not really happen in a place like this. We also ordered 3 desserts and they were all tasty.I like the vibe here, it is classic/worldly, energetic and fun.  A great place for friends to meet and eat. We all had a really good time and would not hesitate coming back again. Just make reservations in advance, as they do fill up quickly. The summer offers outdoor seating which I adore and a great opportunity to people watch!  Can't beat good food and a show! :)"
"First, this is NOT a restaurant for a quiet dinner or catching up with friends. With that said, the food was very good, the prices are very reasonable considering its location, great selection of wine and food, and great service.  We arrived 20 minutes prior to our reservation time, and despite the hour and a half wait for walk-ins, we were seated immediately. Our first impression in the main dining room was the HEAT- 81 degrees according to the thermostat on their wall! Diners were fanning themselves while they ate at their cramped tables, and the staff stated that it was the number of patrons and not a problem with the air conditioning that caused the high temperature. Our server was great- very attentive and helpful while allowing us to order at our own pace. Throughout most of the meal the three of us were rarely able to hear what the other was saying due to the non-stop noise- between the open kitchen off the dining room and the overall number of patrons. This is by far the noisiest restaurant I've ever visited.In all, this a great place for great food and wine, but not great conversation."
"Quartino... ah, one of the many flavor of the month restaurants my dad had taken me to when I'm in town.I really like the concept of Quartino. I like a restaurant where I can try a little bit of everything but end up full at the end of the meal. Provided the people I'm with and I agree on food we like, there ends up being a great variety of choices. The food here is very good.The service, though, was really uneven. Our server seemed really confused throughout our meal, brought our food out in a very scattered way with no rhyme or reason, and generally was hard to track down if/when we wanted more food. the restaurant was fairly new at the time, and we may have just hit them on a bad night or when they were still working out the kinks. They show promise, and I'm definitely up for trying them again."
"I just love the food! Everything is so tasty and garlic filled. Olives, salami, fresh Mediterranean salads, pasta, pizza, shrimp, veal meatballs, wine....what on earth could be better?? I come back time after time again. I almost wish I could resist so as to try someplace else."
"I really enjoyed my experience at Quartino. I live in the neighborhood and, to be honest, the area is so packed with restaurants that I was looking forward to dining here but not super excited - however, it was great! The portions are perfectly sized and priced, and I got absolutely stuffed (with leftovers!) for a pretty good price, especially in this area where restaurants can easily fall into the too pricey and not very good trap. Recommendations:1. Make a reservation or get here early and have a drink at the bar, especially when the outdoor area is closed.2. Try the pastas and the pizza - I think these are definitely the best dishes at Quartino. 3. Avoid the polenta fries unless you enjoy the taste of pure deep fried food. The red pepper sauce accompaniment isn't great either. 4. The wine and beers lists are really good - try a new Italian beer (e.g. Moretti or Peroni) that you might not find elsewhere! 5. The bread they give you at the beginning isn't great - don't fill up on it because the main dishes are way better."
"Awesome and authentic.Walking around Chicago and stumbled into this place. So happy we did. Awesome, old fashioned Itlaian table service. Great, real Italian food. And an atmosphere that brought me back to my family's gatherings. Casual to dress casual.  Wonderful location as you can people watch on this busy street. Prices are great - very, very resonable.  Highly recommend this place.  **It's very traditional so if you are looking for Chicago deep-dish pizza there are some disney-type restaurants down the block... This place is more of a neopolitan style restaurant. - Wonderful."
"We stumbled upon this place during a weekend trip to Chicago. Traveling with 8 other people can sometimes be hard, especially when making dining decisions, but I think everyone enjoyed their meal. And thankfully we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table. They say its tapas and you should share but really its hard to share such yummy goodness in such a small portion. This was a great meal in terms of relatively inexpensive Italian food and wine."
"I was tasked with picking a place for dinner for a date I went on recently. Primarily because my date was not from here so I was happy to do it but oh the pressure! I didn't want to pick a place too expensive because then I'm that asshole girl that's a gold digger. But ugh what if he's the ""meat and potatoes"" guy and just really wants a nasty ass steak? Well, I picked well! I opted for Quartino. I'd been here before and knew the type of atmosphere and that it is tapas style. I'm not typically the type of girl that enjoys sharing small plates but I figured that picking food together would be a nice conversation starter. I also knew that it wasn't that expensive and I believe they have a full bar...It was actually a perfect place. For a Sunday there were quite a few people there which created a nice casual, no-pressure atmosphere. We did end up discussing our options and I came to learn that (thank god) he too did not eat meat. So, I didn't have to worry about explaining my finicky habits when it comes to meat (chicken: no; hot dogs: yes!)The plates were the perfect size. We ordered 4 and split it between just the two of us. We also ordered a carafe of wine which was a fine amount for two people, although I could have used another glass or two. But it was a Sunday and too much alcohol equals judgment impairments so probably a good thing.All in all, the dinner was a success! The food was great. Yummy bread. Fast and friendly service. And all at a reasonable, socially acceptable price for a first date."
"This is one of my top overall picks anytime visiting Chicago. The main reason is they make the absolute best sangria I've ever had in my life. It's made the right way, not just red wine with a bunch of fruit stuffed in it. Order the full litre. You'll thank me for it!The staff is always friendly and welcoming. I love the atmosphere - I feel like it's cozy and intimate, although it does get a bit loud.The appetizer menu is outstanding, with lots of difference choices. I ordered the polenta fries and while they weren't exactly mindblowing, the spicy sauce that came with them was great.The shrimp risotto is my absolute favorite dish and they delivered it wonderfully last night. Cooked perfectly, with a ton of flavor.We also ordered the Margherita pizza which was great, as always. The zeppoles are definitely worth saving room for. The chocolate sauce is great and they are so light and fluffy, they are a perfect after dinner snack."
So loud that there is no reason to go here. There are too many fine restaurants in Chicago to have to put up with ringing ears and a headache when you leave a restaurant.
"Small plates are a trend that is definitely here to stay - it sometimes feels like the majority of restaurants in Chicago serve small plates. It's almost becoming a tired concept - too many places serve the same mediocre, overpriced-for-their-size flatbreads and calamari, vaguely attuned to whatever ethnic cuisine the establishment is trying to emulate. Quartino is not in this category; this place executes the concept flawlessly.Based on my experience, the food is uniformly fantastic. The prosciutto-wrapped dates are excellent; not remotely greasy or cloying (Chicago restauranteurs take note: dates are already sweet and do NOT need a superfluous honey glaze. Do them like this). The grilled octopus is fork-tender and simply seasoned. Bone marrow is copious and served with an appropriate amount of bread. Gnocchi with arugula pesto and green beans undoubtedly stole the show. I've seen enough of the played-out gnocchi offerings, served with gobs of bleu cheese or bland vodka cream sauce. This was a subtle twist on an authentic dish (Romans eat pesto with green beans and potatoes, which were represented by the gnocchi) - a welcome change of pace. I recommend you spring for fondue for dessert, which is also a pleasant surprise; very dark chocolate, melted just right, not a shade too thick or too thin. My lone pseudo-gripe is with the short rib, which tastes somewhat like the Italian potroast I make at home; by no means unpleasant, but it is somewhat offputting to be served food one feels one can make for oneself. Pricing was surprisingly fair for this typically extortionate neighborhood - most small plates set you back single digits, no small plate runs more than $13, and some of them (gnocchi, short rib) approach entree-size. Wine list is good and cheap, service is fast. All in all, Quartino bucks the trend of pedestrian, vaguely Mediterranean small plate establishments that are inundating the Chicago restaurant scene. When I have a hankering for this style of dining, I'm definitely headed here."
"Whether you're going for lunch with some friends on a weekday or on a weekend for a fun night out with a date, Quartino is a good place.  I have been several times and the food is consistently good as is the service.  I like that they have small plates and pizzas that you can share and they are always willing to make anything vegetarian.  You know it's being made fresh because they have never given me a hard time about switching something to vegetarian.  At most places they'll tell you, sorry but it's already been made.  Not at Quartino.  Very good food and great ambience."
"Not good, I know a lot of people like this restaurant, but my husband and I just don't get the appeal. We went in on a Friday for the 2 for $20 lunch special. At first the waitress had no idea what we were talking about, but then she spoke to the manager and found out that it was in effect. For the first course, we had the salad with spinach, walnuts, and pears. It sounded good, but when we ate it it was incredibly unbalanced. For the second course we had the pork marsala which was definitely the best part of the whole meal but still not amazing. For the third course we had tortellini with prosuitto, peas, and alfredo. It was not great and was very salty. The bread was ok and the $4 quartino of the red house wine was surprisingly good. I won't be back unless for wine."
"This restaurant was a great experience for us on our first night in Chicago. Be prepared there is one waiter but multiple servers and the food comes out as it's completed in the kitchen; so, not everyone gets their dinner at the same time. You really have to keep track of your order. We were missing one plate and somehow we find out that they were out of it! However, the maitre'd comp'd us our entire dessert order!"
"Quartino had really great vibes and a friendly staff. But, yes there is a but, I think the rating of ""A-OK"" was made for this restaurant.  The buzz around this place was that it's got a great Chicago feel and I completely agree, however, the food was just alright.The group that I was dining with had dined before and knew exactly what they wanted, so I just sat back and let them order.  The polenta fries, which were mediocre tasting, lacked that unique flavor that makes an appetizer memorable. It being restaurant week, we followed the crowds with ordering the $33.00 course option.  We had the sea scallops, one of my favorite food items but once again - these were mediocre at best.  The caprese salad was well done, but that's also a dish that is expected to taste the same just about anywhere you go.  For dessert, we ordered the Zeppole's which were pretty great overall.  I loved the honey & dark chocolate dipping sauces and the doughnut dough was delightfully light and delectable.The experience dining at Quartino was exceptional and I'd love to go back, I just wasn't in love with their entrees.  I'll stay open minded and give them the benefit of the doubt...we all have our days off.Oh, and try the bellini's they are heavenly!"
"One of the better tapas places where my wife and I have eaten.  We ordered a 1/4 carafe of wine which suited the amount of wine we desired with our meal.  The calamari portion was very generous.  Our fried polenta was crisp and the red pepper dipping sauce was flavorful (and we don't usually like bell pepper!).  The veal meatball slider that came with giardinara was delicious.  Our final dish was the shrimp risotto cooked just right. It was a great way to end an awesome meal.  The vibe was lively (bordering loud), but well worth it."
"This is a solid place to bring guests staying around the Mag Mile.  It's extremely well-priced and is better than most of the overpriced tourist traps in the area.  The portion sizes are perfect as well.  I don't like how everything comes out at different times, and every time we go, the service is slow, albeit friendly.  The last time I was there with my Mom, almost half of the plates stacked on our table were dirty, which kind of grossed us out.  All that being said, the food is good, the prices are fantastic, and the wine deals are amazing.  Plus they let you carry out the bottle of wine if you don't finish.  The cavatelli with fresh basil and fresh ricotta is delicious and by far the best thing we have ordered here.  I recommend for a dinner out with guests in the area who don't want to spend a lot of money."
"This was a great place to enjoy a late dinner while visiting Chicago. Quartino boasts a lively atmosphere, the group sitting near us was very loud. So if you are looking for a quiet meal, this is probably not your goto place, though it was a late dinner so that may have had something to do with it. The penne alla vodka, zola noci & pere pizza were very good, and the prices on the food & wine were surprisingly reasonable. They also have a large bar area."
"I'll go with the masses here and give Quartino 4 stars, because I enjoyed my meal and I would return. Both qualifiers for at least 4 stars.I Yelped Quartino before we decided on it for dinner the night after I ran the Chicago Marathon (a Sunday). It didn't sound like the BEST option but we didn't want to wait long and we wanted to eat somewhere within the hour. Hence, the celestial union between Quartino and our little group manifested itself. We were out of towners, but worldly ones who live in Boston, so I don't rate this place with an Applebee's / Oilve Garden perspective.This place looks far classier on the outside than it ends up being. It has a more welcoming rustic, European countryside feel inside.I got the feeling the food was not freshly prepared, as in, it is prepackaged stuff that they heat up, or they make it in big batches ahead of time. That being said, it was still very tasty, so I'm not sure exactly how it works.We got some bread (cold, not heated) which was okay. Olive oil only on the table for dipping (no cheese, no spices). We chomped away on that while I ordered some wine and we looked over the menu.We each got our own pasta dish, although they stress ordering together and sharing the dishes here ""tapas style"". It's called ""tapas"" but it is not Spanish food. It's Italian food, and there are pizzas. So I think Quartino is a tad confused and can't quite decide whether they want to be Italian or Spanish or tapas or not....The food was good and I would revisit, as I said. I would say, though, that the prices are too high for the portions and quality of food you receive. Too pricey. Maybe it was the downtown State Street location?One thing that threw me: the way you order the wine. You order it by the pint or something weird like that. I thought I was looking at 1/4, 1/2 or full as a glass - and thinking, this must be some pretty damn good wine, because it was $20+ for a glass! Turns OUT that those ratios, on the menu there, they represent the portion of a pint pitcher you get. So... full = 480 mL = 16 ounces = 2 cups = about 1 and 1/2 ""normal"" glasses of wine. On top of all this confusion, you drink your wine out of what looks like a scotch glass. I was so thrown....I would like to go to Quartino again. Because of how confused they are about who they are supposed to be though, I can't say they beat out any other normal Italian or normal Spanish tapas restaurants I've been to.Wait: Made a reservation, so none, but looked like you could have walked in.Food: Enjoyed, but again, something weird about it...not made to-order.Service: Extremely friendly hostess and waiter. Quick, attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.Atmosphere: Laid back, relaxing atmosphere. Welcoming and comfortable. Mostly groups of people celebrating one thing or another. Not a couples or singles type of place from what I saw, I could see dates happening here though."
Visited Chicago last year and stopped by this tapas bar  . .  and I loved it! I loved it so much that I came by twice. The braised lamb shank and gnocchi were my favorite. The lamb shank was nice and tender   . . fall off the bone. Gnocchi was a plate full of heaven. We had ordered so much food that the manager had to pull up another stool and make a makeshift table for us =) The service was excellent  . . . the manager even gave us his cell phone number if we wanted to come back and yes I would definitely come back here if I'm ever in Chicago again.
"Oh how I love Quartino. ""Small plates"" Italian is heaven on earth, and the prices here are ridiculous. A year or two back I took some New Yorkers here and we had a feast. When the bill came, shock. We had stuffed 5 people with food and wine on $30 per person. The same meal in NYC would have cost twice as much, if not more. The salumeria is top notch. The pizza is good (and a brilliant way to ""close down"" the meal, make it the last thing you order). Gnocchi to die for.There are other small plate places in Chitown, but I think this one is the best."
"Quartino's is the BEST place downtown for a large group!! It's in a central location in River North and has a lively, rambunctious atmosphere that seems to fit perfectly with why we came - to enjoy great food and wine with friends.  We came here on a Saturday night with a party of 12, ate and drank like kings, then each shelled out only $30 a head including tip! Solid menu of ""small plates"" - though each one was generous enough to make it around our table for every person to try. If you're looking for a romantic dinner for two, this isn't your spot (but you should try Riccardo Trattoria in Lincoln Park). The joy here is getting together a ton of people to try bites of antipasti, calamari, pasta, pizza, risotto and more without having piles of leftovers!"
"I had been dying to try Quartino, so when a GNO (Girls Nite Out) dinner was on tap I suggested we give it a try. I was pretty underwhelmed, as were the other 3 people in my party. It's basically italian tapas, which sounds like a great idea and probably is, just not here. The food wasn't bad, it was just blah. Nothing impressed me, which for those prices something should have. The service was great, our waiter was funny and attentive, and the Bellini's were so good I really wanted to dive in the pitcher and drink my way out. Other that that it wasn't much to write home about. Oh, it was very loud in there, unnecessarily loud. So loud my ears were ringing and my voice was hoarse from having to shout so we could hear each other at our own table."
"Alright, I've heard enough about this place, and I finally got my booty there: twice! First time, I was the angry bitch girlfriend who made the server uncomfortable probably because I didn't even order at the same time as my counterpart...Yeah not a proud moment..lol Problem: when I did order my eggplant Parmesan; it came out before my soup...hmmm Wondering if maybe it was someone's mistake?Second time we sat at the bar, and it was a better experience since I was not being a mean..well you know! I like the atmosphere, and the food is pretty darn good. I still know where to get the best Italian food in the city of Chicago, yet this place is all good in the hood!"
"One of my favorite places in Chicago, there's something for everyone on the menu, thus so easy/enjoyable to share small plates. Mmm, the gnocchi. I absolutely adore coming here when it's warm out; enjoying some sangria on the patio and people-watching makes for a lovely food outing."
"My favorite restaurant ever!  I have been fortunate to eat at the finest restaurants in S.F., L.A., the O.C., Hawaii, the list goes on... I even opened this Yelp account thing JUST to review Quartino.  I ate here with my boyfriend and his parents one night and came back the next night with a party of 9 because the food was so good!  Hell, we even craved Quartino the next day but opted out of another trip to the city.  Ok...obviously I LOVED it....Why?  The Salumeria tasting was the best idea.  Two meats, two cheeses, three spuntini and delicious apricot puree and mostarda to compliment.  The duck prosciutto with Taleggio cheese and apricot puree atop a nut/raisin(maybe dates) bread?! I felt like the rat in Ratatouille.  We ordered a pizza both nights; first the Prosciutto D'Anitra and the next night the Soprano (added tomato sauce).  Delicious pizza Naples style and so good we devoured it before we could speak. Ordered a liter of house wine and finished it (well, mostly I did).  Also ordered the shrimp dish, soup, and the Dates wrapped in Pancetta.  I hate Gorgonzola cheese but somehow I enjoyed the combination of Pancetta and honey atop the dates.  We also ordered dessert; Coppa al Banana and The Hot Chocolate cake (BOTH AMAZING).  The party we brought with us the second night were a group of true Italians and they also were in amazement of the ecstasy brought on by Quartino's food.  Amazing, amazing, amazing.Service was great.  In fact, if it weren't for Brandon/Brendon (it is loud in there) we probably would have passed it up the first night and meandered elsewhere.  He explained the menu and within a few seconds we were watering at the mouth.  Waiters and waitresses are very attentive and the bussers are constantly clearing your table.  I felt like I was in Italy!!This is mentioned last in my review because the quality of food is priceless, however their prices are very affordable.  About $100 for a party of 4 to gorge?!  I'd be there 3 times a week if I could.Definitely going to visit there once, twice, maybe three times next time I am in Chicago."
"Feeling in a celebraatory mood, I grabbed my favorite gal pal and headed over here last week, almost fogetting that it was St Patrick's Day! After raising our glasses with an excellent dry sparkling, we were duly impressed. The service was great, the warm and cosy atmosphere, calming, and the prices were gentle on the wallet. At the end of our time, we were even serendaded by Irish bagpipes!Do keep this place in mind for casual elegance, warmth and great vino. Next time we will try the food. Cheers!"
"The food is fine here at Quartino's. Honestly, if I were rating the food alone, I would give this place a 3.5 stars, maybe 4 if I felt generous. It's straightforward, homestyle Italian cooking that is made unique with tapas portions/presentation. The thing that separates this place from the rest is the wine and champagne--cheap and tasty, my favorite combination. You can buy by the glass at the table, but don't forget to buy a few bottles on the way out, as well. FAR superior to two buck chuck, promise!"
"Small plates, small plates, SMALL PLATES!  I love that small plates are coming into fashion or maybe I am just really into them this year. I finally went to Quartino after somehow never getting around to going before. I am so glad I broke that habit because I had a great time.I went there on a weekday night and sat in the bar. I like the bar area better because it is less formal and I get really loud as the night goes on.So we decided to do it up right and order a bunch of plates to try. Veal Meatball SliderSalamiAsiago CheeseTomato wrapped with zucchiniroasted peppersgarlic breadbroccoli rabeTo drink I had the prosecco and my friend had a half liter of red wine. For dessert I had the limoncello martini and she had the espresso martini. All the food was amazing and we really got more for each serving than we thought we would. The service was also really great and we had a lot of the staff coming around to check on us. I cannot wait to go back and try the four chesse pizza, I have seen that it is a popular dish on yelp and foursquare but I really wanted to try some of the other plates before I went for the pizza. I didn't get the feeling that it was too loud in there. Maybe because we were in the bar and I naturally expected it to be loud but I never felt like I was shouting or I couldn't hear."
"Came here again for a going-away extravaganza.  Anyway, it was my first time dining here on a weeknight, and boy was it packed and loud!  Apparently? the plates are meant to be shared, but I could honestly just eat one and be perfectly satisfied.  This time I ordered the gnocchi in a pesto sauce, to be shared of course, with the rest of the group.  The pesto sauce didn't really do it for me, was a bit too mild than what I'm used to, not really bursting with flavor.  The other dishes I sampled were the risotto, the cavatelli, meat balls and pizza.  The risotto was just not to my liking, kind of a bit...ehh.  The cavatelli, topped with basil and ricotta, was very good, as were the Prosciutto D'Antira (Onion, Duck Prosciutto & Wild Arugula) and Funghi (Roasted Porotbello & Crushed Tomatoes) pizzas.The Dessert was great.  I ordered the Tiramisu, which doesn't appear on the menu.  This time we didn't share, so I kept the entire piece to myself.  It was very good.  I also ate some of the Zeppole, even though I'm not much of a doughnut / fried-dough person, regardless it was pretty tasty."
"Ok lets be honest TAPAS is one thing but on top of it its Italian!Mangai!!So yes im like the 982,291, 209 review but seriously this place is def consistent.  Affordable wine and killer eats.  Best thing about it if you dont like something that you ordered dont worry about it (Cheezy Italian accent!), you will have other plates bc we all share here!  :)  Honestly everything I have here is good if not great.  You def need to try the roasted octopus!  Such great fresh flavor!!  The pizza was good but I need to try the funghi, just need to go w/ someone that enjoys mushrooms.   :)  Risotto was right on flavorful.  The place does get really crowded so be prepared to wait or get lucky in the bar seating.  Either way solid joint w/ no complaints here..."
"Decided to try their dinner menu so we went with the Salumeria Tasting it was a great way to start out the night.. you get two salumi, two formaggi and three spuntini which was the assortment of olives.We ordered Artichokes  campobasso: baby artichokes, onions carrots and EVOO Roasted beet salad: ricotta salata and walnuts (Really like this one)Sicilian caponata: eggplant salad olives and capers (Nothing too special, Trader Joe's has an identical Caponata.)Salumi. Sopressata: Spicy Calabrian Sausage (Yum)Prosciutto di Parma: Italian Ham aged 18months (Who doesn't like prosciutto?)FORMAGGI:Asiago Vecchio: Cows milk sharp tangy semi hard Fontina Val D'Aosta : cows milk,creamy rich sweet semi soft. OLIVES:Gaeta Liguarian, San Guiliano Basano My favorite: Sicilian oil cured. Amazing olives! I know that sounds weird but I've always been a fan of anything pickled or cured.Polenta fries with the roasted red pepper sauce were served very hot right out of the fryer. We had to let them sit for awhile but they were pretty decent. I would have been happier with a different sauce for dipping though. Ordered the roasted baby octopus with braised escarole red chili and EVOO. By far this was my favorite thing we ordered. It was amazing. You need to try the Octopus.Cavatelli was another favorite it was very good with fresh basil. Just an authentic tasting pasta dish.Overall I've never been a fan of Tapas places but I've always liked Quartino for their little dishes that make the place a hit. I would usually just come here for dessert and some vino but I wanted to try some of their dinner menu and I was pleased. Keep up the good eats!"
All the food was excellent. Portions were just right so you don't overstuff yourself with room for the yummy deserts. An employer from the Columbia store said this was the best italian food in downtown Chicago. We all agreed.
"Great food and service, and I love that the wine comes in multiple sizes depending on my mood.  I've come here for couples dinners as well as with my family and have always had a good experience.  The only bad part is that the wait can be very long, especially on weekends, so definitely make a reservation!"
"You have a group of 8 friends wanting to go out for a fun night of stuffing their faces and boozing it up without breaking the bank. Where do you go? The one and only Quartino's! The caraf's of wine are ridiculously cheap - 20 bucks for nearly a bottle and half of wine? Yes please! A charcuterie platter for $25? Absolutely! Arugula pizza and Wild Mushroom pizza for 10 bucks a piece? OH EHM GEE...On Friday night my friends and I celebrated my new job a Quartino's and had 3 carafs of wine, a charcuterie platter, two wood-oven pizzas, and 5 entrees to share. At the end of the night my friend's scoffed when we split the bill $30pp - this all including tax AND at 20 percent tip!!!Quartino's has consistently been a restaurant where I go to enjoy good Italian bites and house wine. In the summer months my friends and I have been known to spend hours drinking many, many carafs of white wine while sitting al fresco to people watch. My only complaint is that the restaurant is always packed like sardines - and the noise level can be obnoxious. Thus, minus one star."
"Five for service, three for food equals four starts!We had a group of 11 there last night. The food was good, nothing spectacular..kind of like Mangiano's.. but fine for what we were looking for.......the service, however, was spectacular aside from one glitch at the end... the back waiters, bussers were friendly and phenomenally efficient.  I can not say too many good things about them. We were seated on the second floor and the entire staff there was just outstanding.  Whomever is the manager/trainer of Quartino's needs a raise...yesterday!The ONLY negative was our waiter, who was maybe 24, light hair and glasses.. seemed overwhelmed and not once came to check on us and never did come back to give us the check. We had to ask our busboy, who asked another waiter, who was extremely gracious and got it for us and then took it when we needed pay.  Great teamwork but kind of a little service downer at the end.. ....  but again, everything else was truly spectacular!"
I'd come back here any day just for one thing - Polenta fries!
"Went Friday night as part of a party of 5. We had reservations, and my cousin (who made them) had asked for an outdoor table, but when we got there we were told it would be a 30 min. wait for that. We took a seat indoors instead (it was humid out anyway, so probably just as well). Indoors is LOUD. Like, people screaming, ears-ringing-when-you-leave loud. The two women in our group with less than-resounding-voices were impossible to hear all night. Our table was right near a waiter station with the big bread-slicing machine on it, which was in use the whole time -- normally the sound of it going would have been annoying throughout a meal in a regular-volume restaurant, but I assure you I never heard it once. The dishes are small and they encourage you to order multiple plates for the table and share (Italian-style tapas, essentially), and they bring out each dish as it's done; since I don't eat tomatoes, this limited the number of dishes that were available to me. I chose the mushroom risotto, which had a full depth of funghal flavor but was just infinitesimally undercooked; my cousin's shrimp risotto had achieved the proper creamy texture without the hard bite of undercooked rice remaining (I make risotto frequently at home, so I'm well aware of the process and what it should be like). The shrimp scampi ordered by another member of the party was serviceable, but nothing beyond what you'd find at Red Lobster (though the shrimp were a bit bigger); the texture did suggest that they'd been overcooked a bit (veering slightly towards tough). For dessert we ordered a Fantasia Coppa di Frutta, a trio of fruit sorbets (raspberry, orange and lemon), topped with slivers of fruit (granny smith apples, sliced grapes, pineapple), a biscotti, and lemoncello supposedly (didn't really detect it anywhere). The lemon was the best flavor; orange was okay; I thought the raspberry was too sweet, though someone else in the party loved it. This came in a metal cocktail glass (nice presentation) and was big enough for the five at the table to pass around and pick from.Also on the dessert menu is their list of liquers and Italian bitters; they also have house-made lemoncello and orangecello. Service was kept hopping because the place was so busy, but the tag team of two waiters who were helping us was attentive and patient when we needed a couple of rounds of extra time to deliberate over what to order (chatting got in the way of ordering).A note on the restrooms: I didn't notice this when entering the ladies' room, but upon leaving I saw that the space between the sinks and the door, where there might normally be a large mirror, is a big window that looks into the men's room! This does not look into the toilet area, just the entry area, but still, be sure to do your private primping before you reach this spot, if you want it to remain private; I witnessed one guy adjusting himself on his way out the door (gives a whole new meaning to the term ""people watching""). Overall, Quartino was okay, but I wouldn't rush back because of the noise factor alone. Maybe it would be a better spot for lunch or an early dinner."
"I went here with about seven people and it was the perfect choice for a group. The food was really good and it had a great wine list. The service, though, was the only downside. The waitress took forever so one of the guys I was with actually went up to the register to get her and he overheard her talking shit about our table. Safe to say we didn't give her a huge tip. Also it is EXTREMELY noisy so don't come here if you're looking for an intimate dinner."
Decent pizza. Lazy service( my bartender was too busy flirting with a 22 yr old girl at the bar). Gelato was freezer burned
"Decided to check out Quartino after hearing many folks rave about it. Went late on a Saturday night (9-ish) and the place was packed. And I'm not talking about just a full restaurant here. I'm talking Outback-Steakhouse-in-Schaumburg-at-7 p.m.-on-a-weekend packed! We were barely able to squeeze our way into the lobby after getting through the revolving door.Once you adjust though, this is a fun little restaurant. The décor is really cool with a lot of old subway tile and an open kitchen. The space definitely has some character. There's a neat wine bar in the front of the building where you can go hang out and have a bottle of wine, or three if you go with a group without reservations because it will take awhile to get seated. The crowd is stylish, young, and good looking. I'd best describe it as Lincoln Parky kind of crowd. I don't think I've seen that many ladies with over-the-knee boots in any one place in my life (not a bad thing!). It's definitely not touristy like a lot of River North restaurants are. A+ on the people watching meter.  The food is also a strong point. This isn't heavy pasta dishes smothered in a gallon of red sauce like Nonna used to make. It's a ""tapas style"" situation where the dishes are smaller and meant to be shared. An interesting trend in Italian cooking. We tried a few appitizers. Started out with their Salumera Tasting. Basically, this is a combination platter where you get to choose two meat types, two cheeses, two olives, and two vegetable salads. Went with Bresaola and Prosciutto for meats, Gorgonzola Dolce and Provolone for the cheeses, and Sicilian Caponata and roasted beet (never thought I'd order beets in a restaurant but what the hell!) for the ""salads."" The dish is sufficient in size to serve at least two people with moderate appetites and a little pricey at $25. But it was really good, particularly the Gorgonzola and Caponata.For the main dinner, I just had a sausage pizza (was feeling a little basic after the Salumera!). Very good and flavorful. The wine list is also reasonably extensive, and relatively affordable for a downtown restaurant. There are plenty of bottles in the $20s - not bad at all.   Service was prompt and friendly, which is a credit given how crowded it was and how many large tables the waitstaff had to deal with. The waiter was really cool and good about explaining things, which was helpful given the somewhat unique concept. In the end, I'd highly recommend Quartino for a group of friends who want to spend an interesting night out. The food is very good and the overall experience with the ""intangibles"" added in is even better. I would, however, make reservations given how popular it is, and be prepared to spend a little money as it's not particularly cheap. But, as they say, you get what you pay for and in my opinion the restaurant offers a good value for what you get."
"My girlfriend and I came by this place for dinner recently and I was pleasantly surprised. It's italian style tapas that come out as they're ready, so if you go with a group of people, make sure everybody is okay with sharing because if you order 5 things, there's a good chance they'll come out at 5 different times. My lady and I had the Salumeria(sp?) tasting which was really good, especially the duck prosciutto and the eggplant caponata. We also shared the pork belly and ended it all with some chocolate fondue. All in all, this was a great place to sit and relax, drink too much wine, and have some lively conversation with your friends and family."
"Like the other reviewers, I would also suggest that you make a reservation when you go here.  I went here with a group of 12 for a family member's birthday. Our reservation was for 6:30 on a Friday night and we were promptly seated in a private room in the middle of the first floor.  Absolutely every dish we tasted was amazing and delicious. They have REAL Parmesan at the table. Even the bread they brought us was perfect and fresh.  Hi-lights included the duck prosciutto and Gorgonzola on the anti-pasti platter... basically all of our anti-pasti platter consisted of simple yet well crafted items.. but seriously that duck... I'm still thinking about that duck.   Entree hi-lights were the shrimp risotto (highly recommend, it just melted in your mouth oh my goodness), gnocchi, tortellini with peas in an rich white sauce. I had absolutely no room for dessert but my family enjoyed that as well.Our server, Tony, was experienced, attentive and had great suggestions/guidance.  For large parties, try seeing if you can get the private room.  It made our birthday completely memorable and wonderful. I definitely want to go back here.I'm giving this 5 stars because I simply couldn't have imagined a better dining experience for this occasion. Between the food, the atmosphere, and the service, what isn't to rave about!!"
We really enjoyed this place. We made reservations and got in right away. I enjoyed the family style how the plates come out as they are ready. We were six and we all enjoyed taste a bit of each different selection.
"Not bad. Good prices. Really, the food is decent overall. But I just wouldn't go back. Too many other options in the vicinity."
"Great for groups.  We had a team dinner for work here.  I'd recommend designating someone to be the point person to order for the table.Overall, it was good, but nothing to rave about.  I think it's because my manager has poor choice in food and she ordered for our table (without consulting).Here is what we ordered. . .* Salumeria Tasting - Recommend it.  Great choice as a snack for a group* Veal Meatballs - Not bad/Not great - not as good as an Italian grandma's veal meatballs* Polenta Fries - Good choice* Pepperoni Pizza - Why my manager ordered pepperoni pizza is beyond me. Sadly, this was the second best tasting item.* Zola Noci & Pere Pizza - Wasn't impressed.  It was like a cheese pizza with pears placed on top (yes, I mean placed)* Penne alla Vodka - Best tasting item we ordered.* Panino al Gelato Limon - Yummy, but I'm a dessert person and any dessert is good to me."
"Love this place. The prices are very reasonable, and for delicious food with a bustling atmosphere right on State Street, you can't beat it. I always take out-of-town guests here since I live in the building, and they always love it and want to go back. We've shut this place down on Saturday nights a few times. Love the family-style small plates. We can all try lots of different dishes, and everything I've ordered has been delicious. The bar area is a nice place to grab a drink after work on the weekdays, and the restaurant is always lively. If you're looking for a quiet, romantic eatery, seek elsewhere, but for what it is, Quartino is a very fun place to eat with very good food, and it won't break the bank."
"Amazing, authentic Italian and excellent prices. Waitstaff was extremely pleasant and helpful. Every dish we tried was amazing, especially Veal Milanese, spaghetti arabiatta. Would come here over and over if we lived in Chicago."
"Yes, Italian that is as good as it gets.  Old school authentic recipes (I could picture my Italian grandma whipping up her culinary masterpieces while eating) but lightened up for modern tastes. The portions are smaller but big enough to share. Going back for seconds tomorrow night.  We shard the veal meatballs - there were six small balls served in a small caste iron frying pan with a light bean and tomato sauce, very good.  Hubby had the tomato soup, very robust with large croutons and a dollop of cream, he loved it.  I had the shaved veggie salad - very light and tasty and fresh!  Eggplant Parmesan was cheesy and good, especially on the piece of bread I smothered it on. We actually had room for dessert, glad we did - tried the zeppoles with chocolate (again, I channeled my grandma in the kitchen) and the lemon gelato-lemon curd sandwich.  Both excellent and not overladen with sugar and our taste buds were in desert heaven.  Thanks yelp and all the good reviewers, would not have found his place without you.  We had wine and cappuccinos, bill was under $70. Worth every cent."
"The atmosphere was good and the price was very reasonable, but I had high expectations coming in.  Overall, I thought the food was ok.  The meatballs were really good, but there are better Italian places in the city.  This is a great spot for dinner with a group of friends before you head out to the city.I also heard that the last Wednesday night of each month the have a $20 buffet/ all you can drink deal for three hours."
"I love Quartino, though I guess no restaurant gets a four star rating from me.My parents, hosiers (real hosiers i.e. Bloomington, IN is the ""big city"") loved the restaurant.  It was a cold, but not to cold, Sunday.  I dropped my mom off front and looking at the valet ($10!) I decided ""hmm, maybe street parking"".  Maybe I was lucky, but street parking was found a block away.It was a late lunch/early dinner.  As others have mentioned this is a ""family style small plates"" style restaurant. So what does that mean? Well you pay full price, but get little bitty items.The best thing about this restaurant is the  cured meat selection. Apparently they cure their own meats, and you can tell.   It is to bad they don't have a deli where you can get the cured meats to go for a discount.The pizza's were pretty good, the fettuccine was average. . .but overall we had a great time.  This place is expensive though, $20.00 a person without wine."
"Gotta love Quartino's. The food is great, it's not ridiculously pricey, and the waiters and waitresses are always incredibly friendly and helpful. The place can get pretty crowded and noisy though, so if you are looking for a more intimate Italian restaurant, this isn't the place.  The atmosphere would probably be greatly improved if they had about half the number of tables that they have in the dining room; but then, there would probably be a huge wait to get a seat. Even when it's crowded, though, the food has been consistently good, and the plates start coming out not too long after you order. As a place to meet up with friends or to grab a bite to eat after a long day exploring Michigan Ave, Quartino's is definitely a great choice."
"Quartino used to be a ""go-to"" place for us when out of town guests come visit.  The restaurant basically serves Italian tapas.  I recently visited with a group of 11 people.  Reservation was not difficult to make.  You can either call the restaurant or make the reservation online.You get a basket of house-made bread after you are seated which you can dip in olive oil and real Italian parmesan chese that you can grate yourself.  Food didn't take long to appear on the table even with our group size and how busy the restaurant was.  Overall the meal was good.  Food was good.  The only complain for the food was that the pork belly was a bit dry.  The server was friendly, however, she did not let us know that there were no refill, so between just two guests, it ended up $20 worth of lemonades.  Also, we ordered zeppole as one of our many desserts.  We didn't know that we have to choose between honey or chocolate for dipping sauce.  When the dessert arrived, it came with both honey AND chocolate dipping sauce.  Later when the bill came, we found out that there was an extra $2.50 for the honey.  I would say that that is very sneaky.  The bill came out to be about $450, which was over our expectabtion, but that was ok since everyone enjoyed the food.  But my impression about Quartino changed after the sneaky charges that we incurred.  Pro: Good place to go to if you want to try many different dishes with a group as they serve tapas.  It's always a busy place so you know the food is good.Con: sneaky charges."
"Loved!  Loud place, busy, crazy, great food. Group of 4 or less is perfect unless a special occasion. Like being in a large Italian family's kitchen. Definitely do a pizza for the table (4 people or less) then a small plate for 3 or 4 of you. I did 3 ppl, 1 pizza, 2 plates. Just enough. Perfect. Oh, and wine wine wine. Also, Go check out the Wine Room."
"Great food, great ambience, would definitely visit this place again!"
"My parents and I were staying at the Palomar Hotel (down the street from Quartino). We had taken a cab to a certain restaurant, whose name shall remain disclosed, and after discovering it was in the middle of a shopping center in a shady area we decided to ask the cab driver to take us back. I tell you this because it was about 8:30 when we got back, and we were famished. We walked down the street from the hotel, walked by Weber Grill Restaurant and it looked packed. We then popped into other restaurants with long waits. Quartino, as packed as it was, my dad worked the system and we get seated. We waited a while for a waiter but we were happy to have a table. Our waitress comes around and gives us a little background of the menu and how it works. She was really nice and helpful. We were a little confused but we just decided to go with it and order 2 small plates each and pick at each others choices. Mom ordered the Beef Carpaccio, and the Cavatelli. Dad ordered the Shrimp Risotto and the Veal Milanese. I ordered the Farmhouse Chicken and the Grilled Zucchini. Note: the zucchini dish was more like a zucchini rollatini without cheese but stuffed with crushed sun-dried tomatoes (so good)! Everybody's decisions were delicious. And the method that we chose, ordering 2 per person (as if we were feeding ourselves) and picking at each others, worked out great! For dessert, Mom eyed the Zeppole, which gave her some memories of the boardwalk she and my dad went to years ago. We all shared it as well as ordered cappuccinos. Wonderful! Definitely a hoppin' place for a Tuesday night in summer. Guess thats a good sign!"
"This place is happening!! We arrived around 6:15pm and the dining room was already full-- if we had known about this place earlier, we would of made some reservations!We walked over to the bar, and were super lucky to grab 3 seats pretty easily. If we had come a bit later, I don't think we would of been able to find seats. Since this place serves italian tapas, the turn over rate at each table is super slow- so if you want to come check this place out, make a reservation or go early.We had the sausage risotto, hand rolled gnocchi, mushroom pizza, and beef short ribs. Everything was delicious- came out hot and full of flavor. I also had their sangria which was perfect to my meal. This place is a perfect place for a date- if you get a seat in the dining area. This place is also great for hanging out on a Friday night- nice bartenders and great food!! I'm so glad my bf's friend recommended this place!"
"After 600+ reviews what can I add that hasn't already been said?Food:4.5/5As I've said in previous reviews for Italian restaurants I'm a bit of an Italian food snob and Quartino is nearly as good as it gets. Some of my personal fave's are the gnocci, meatballs, swordfish(when they have it on special) and the duck prosciutto (found on the small cheese menu)Wine:5/5The selection is moderate but the prices are awesome. Perfect place to dine if you're a wino like me.Service: 4/5I've always had very friendly and generally knowledgeable servers each time I've dined here. The service can at times be a little slow but when the place is slammed you have to be more forgiving.Atmosphere: 3/5I realize they're going for the family style, casual italian dining experience, but it doesn't work on this scale. The place is too big and the tables too crammed together. If you are lucky enough to sit upstairs or outside its a bit better but the place is too loud and crowded for my taste most of the time. That being said the food makes it worth while and if you go during non-peak times it's significantly improved.Value:4.5/5The quality of the food coupled with the relatively low markup on the wine makes Quartino a great place for the money. I am always pleasantly surprised when the bill comes."
"Quartino definitely did not shine when compared to Osteria. Inside, it was large, but loud and cramped. I felt like i could hear the couple sitting next to us. There must have been some sort of large banquet hall upstairs because we saw at least two bachelorette parties going upstairs. The place was super noisy, but I suppose it could be understandable since it was a Saturday. Another by-product of the crowded place was the service was a tiny bit slow. The most memorable part of our dinner was the fondue. It was like an endless supply of cheesy deliciousness. The fondue comes with a variety of breads that they refill as you run out. The Soprano pizza we ordered was a good taste of the thin crust in Chicago. The pizza was nothing spectacular, in fact I have a hard time remembering what it was like. Lesson at the end of the day is go across the street to Osteria."
"I went here to celebrate my mothers birthday and let me say what a dissapointment! Service was LATE. Everyone got their SMALL plates at different times. Appetizers were ok. I mean, you cant go wrong with chesse and olives. Dinner was by far less than mediocre. I have to tell you that everything is in small plates so if you are going there be ready to share. I had a pasta dish. ""Spicy"" linguini with shrimp and scallops. It was VERY bland. Everything was over cooked that it lost all flavor. Not spicy at all!Everyone else had the typical chicken alfredo and beef. The alfredo was just creamy. It overpowered the whole meal. It was more cream that anything. And the beef was ok. By the way, thats all the plate brings. three pieces of beef. After a couple bites here and there. We thought that maybe pizza was their specialty since it was obvious that what we just has wasnt., We ordered a cheese pizza. OMG! It was HORRIBLE! they didnt even get the pizza right!Never going there again! I hear the wine is cheap and ok. So if you are looking for some appetizers that dont need cooking and cheap wine then this place is ok. but definetely NOT for dinner."
Fancy?  Yes.  Tasty?  Sorta'.
"Do I need an excuse to rave about my new favorite restaurant of the week in Chicago? Not really, but holy moly good. We ate here for a bachelorette party dinner and it was the best decision of the night. The maid of honor had requested an ""isolated"" table (genius move on her part) and we were seated on the second level, in a back room with a tv that constantly looped a heavily-overacted black and white film. What makes Quartino's special is that it's an Italian tapas-style place. Typically I'm not a tapas lover. I like my food to be mine. I'm a fantastic sharer in most everything except sharing what's on my plate. However, at this place, they encourage sharing and it only adds to the experience.Try the pesto gnocci (I can taste it now), the cheese fondue (the best cheese in the biz), the penne a la vodka, okay - well really, try everything. Because you can and because you'll be glad you did.Just go. Don't ask questions and just go."
"Great location, great night time atmosphere. The staff was friendly and helpful, we really enjoyed the menu selection as well. The restaurant IS quite loud, I felt like we had to talk very loud sitting right next to each other. Other than that, the food was great and well priced and the wine selection was awesome."
"My experience with Quartino started out as an easy 4 star at least.  Early enough on a Friday evening to get a table without a reservation and our server was quick to get us started with drinks.  We just wanted something light so we went with the Salumeria Tasting (the duck is awesome)Decided to stick around for dessert, but they had gotten VERY crowded and loud and for some reason it took forever to get dessert - that's where they lost a star.I will definitely go back though and try some of the hot dishes."
"Picked this place for a date recently; I thought the sharing of food would be a good way to interact, which it certainly was.The food was really good, I REALLY like the eggplant pizza, highly recommended!  Also had the short ribs and cavatelli, good stuff.They have good deals on the wine when you get half liters or liters.  Do it!My one gripe - it is LOUD.  If you have the patience to wait for an outdoor table, that might be better if you don't want the loud din inside.Liquid dessert - opt for a homemade Lemoncello or ORANGEcello.  So good!"
"It's always a dangerous thing to review a place after your first visit, but I enjoyed Quartino enough to give it a try.My mom and I were in town for the weekend, staying at the Ritz right in the middle of tourist hell.  I was bound and determined NOT to end up at a chain restaurant for dinner on our second night - you know, one of those monstrosities that caters to the tourist crowd, offering up over sized portions that if you are a tourist, you feel like you have to eat because there's no way you're taking it back to your hotel.After much Yelping and calling the concierge a couple of times, we settled on Quartino - close enough to walk, modest enough prices, and options that ranged from simple to ridiculous - and were both really pleased with the choice!  Thanks, Yelp, for not leading us astray - in fact, for leading us to a really excellent option in a sea of awful, over priced, over sized alternatives!We were seated promptly in the large but very busy dining room, and immediately found ourselves a bit overwhelmed by our options.  The menu focuses on small plates, so the server encouraged us to order a few things to share.  Menu options ranged from a short list of olives, cured meats, and cheeses to small plates of rustic-sounding meats and pastas with intriguing fillings.  The entire reverse side of the menu was reasonably-priced wines - and I'm talking reasonable in any city, much less in the heart of Chicago.Mom had the tortellini with peas and prosciutto in a light alfredo sauce, which tasted like the macaroni and cheese of my dreams.  I hadn't really considered pasta, but was convinced to get the ravioli by the magic words braised pork and speck.  I might be a bit hyperbolic here, but it really was some of the best ravioli I've had - like little pillows of savory goodness, complimented perfectly by a chianti and tomato sauce with the occasional fava bean.  Mom and I split a caprese salad, an odd choice in the dead of winter, but just right with salty and soft slices of mozzarella, firm tomato, and a drizzle of a balsamic crema.  I also had a dirty martini - not the best I've had, but definitely good enough to sate my weeks' long craving.On the whole, a very positive experience.  We really enjoyed our food, and the service was attentive but not annoying.  I think Mom was a little anxious about the crowds, but even though every table in the house seemed to be filled (at 7:30 on a Saturday night), our food arrived promptly, our water carafe was never empty, and we were able to get out of there as soon as we were ready.Though my preference is rarely to eat downtown when in Chicago, for Quartino I'll make an exception."
"Great atmoshpere. Great vibe. I love the rustic-Italian theme and the ambiance of the place. Quartino is alive with energy and the tapas-style Italian food is a really fun way to eat. It's a great place for a date or to go with a group of friends. The food is good but not 5-star good. The pizza is very good. The cured meat and cheese plates are a really unique option. This isn't the best Italian food that I've ever eaten (that would be in St. Louis), but I really recommend Quartino for a unique experience in downtown Chicago."
"I do love love love! Before I start, I just want to mention that you can purchase to-go bottles of wine for FIVE DOLLARS! FIVE DOLLARS?!?!? YES!! Haha! It is good wine too. It is supposedly from Italy and the only reason they sell it so cheap is because it is from their own vineyard and the import it themselves (I think). I bought 3 to enjoy at home.I'm sick of the ginormous plates of food you usually get from other Italian restaurants in Chicago so when I saw that they serve small plates... I was too excited!7 of us came here for a birthday dinner. The birthday girl loves Italian so it worked out. We had a  6:30 reservation and we arrived late on a Saturday night. But it doesn't justify having to wait over 45 minutes for our seats. Of course, it would've been better if the waiting area (basically the space between the door and check-in desk) was more spacious People were cramped together waiting for their tables. Anyways, that was the only negative experience of the night. We were given complimentary wine (2 pitcher fulls) for waiting so long, so after that, waiting was bearable. Two managers (I assume they were anyways..) came to apologize. We ordered so much food! WE had about 10 plates, including a pizza. I loved the beef rib, gnocchi, mussels, and the chicken. But everything was good. We also ordered 2 desserts, the zepoli (not spelled correctly I think...) and some kind of fruit sorbet? They were good but not great.To keep it short, the whole meal, for the seven of us was $190, and that included tip!! We didn't pay for wine but that would've only set us back another $30 or so. I don't know about you.... but I think that is very good for all the food we got to try. I will be back again and I will buy more wine the next time I'm back!One more thing... They have sort of weird restrooms. You could see into a part of the men's restrooms.... You can't see them doing their thing of course! but I was checking myself out (haha!) in the full-length mirror and saw a guy walk past the mirror on the other side. Confusing? yes.. but see for yourself."
"Good food, served in shareable tapas format. Usual Italian cuisine, pretty cool ambiance. However, do NOT come here if you are tired or looking for a quiet meal, this restaurant is lively and extremely loud."
"Happy New Year everyone!So I finally made it to Quartino after telling myself for over a year that I would try this place, only to wuss out after being told the wait was over 45 minutes.However!  On a random Monday evening, I stopped in and found the place quite quiet (relatively speaking).  Actually, Quartino was still pretty busy for a Monday night, but we were seated right away despite not having reservations.We started off with a bottle of their house wine (red) which was only $12, and an order of gnocchi.  These babies pretty much melted in your mouth, and the pesto sauce was super yummy!  From there we got an order of their roasted tuscan sausage in a garlic-olive oil sauce.  Not bad, but I liked their gnocchi much better.  A must try!  The total bill (plus a double shot of espresso) came out to roughly $45.  Not too shabby.The people watching's great!  The crowd here is very diverse from groups of rambunctious high school teens, to couples on awkward first dates, to old friends enjoying a night out, there's something interesting around every corner.  Oh, and especially the crazy floor manager who spends the entire night practically running around the restaurant making sure things are running smoothly.  Look out for him, but really... you really can't miss him =PSo after several failed attempts, I think Quartino's was worth it.  I'll definitely come back."
"Quartino's clearly is not in need of my glowing review - but considering I frequent this establishment so much, it's only fair. Quartino's is my go-to place. A lazy weekday or Sunday dinner option, parents are in town, my birthday dinner, girls' night out, date night with the husband - whatever the occasion. It's my go-to place because it's consistently great, from the food to the service to the price to the energy; I don't think you can go wrong. A few personal favorites are the cheese plate appetizer (get the eggplant, beet salad and duck prosciutto), orecchiette with lamb ragu, octopus, cavatappi, and the zeppele donuts. Additionally, on my last visit I sampled some of the new menu additions and the pappardelle pasta with the short rib is absolutely unbelievable. Also, you must try the limoncello, they make it there on-site and it's gloriously potent. I love the fact that I've literally spent entire evenings at our table enjoying myself with friends. They don't rush you out! Go, eat, enjoy...you will be back."
"Yelp is definitely losing my reviews. I know I've reviewed Quartino before.The perfect place to get super-carbed food. Pizzas, pastas, and breads which are a good value. I like the thin pizzas but the crust is chewy. They have a decent selections of salamis; they do have meat dishes but they aren't worth the price. They have a monthly wine tasting event on the last Wednesday of each month. $20 get's you bread, salads, cheeses, and proscuitto; pizza slices are passed out by the servers but good luck getting any.The staff is always energetic and fun. Make sure to get there early or prepare to wait as it gets packed."
"You gotta love a place where your entire table of 12-14 people can get completely trashed and no one judges you; probably because it's quite boisterous in there on a Saturday night anyway. I mean this place was really bumpin'. Don't expect a quiet dinner here.The entrees are a nice, small size but still filling. By the end of the meal, we were groaning when other dishes were brought to the table. Also, the dishes are served as they are made, making it perfect for passing dishes around. We had maybe 20 entrees being passed around and I had a little bite of everything and was stuffed; I believe everyone else felt similarly. The short ribs and cheese plate were especially outstanding and the only dish I really didn't care for was the gnocchi. The wait staff was attentive and kept us moving efficiently toward our goal of getting absolutely wasted. One of the busboys had really bad B.O. so I *know* he was working hard."
"Quartinos was suggested to me by a friend who knew I was looking for stellar wood/brick-oven pizza. I crave that style of pizza weekly and am always looking for my next fix....mmmm pizza....My friends, husband and I have had take out from here three times now and we will definitely be coming back! Their ""Neopolitan"" style pizza menu has many options and they have been so good I have not inquired about ""build-your-own"".Two winners you might enjoy are the Valtellinese and Quatro Stagioni. The Valtellinese has a thick-dried/smoked beef bresaola, wild arugula and their amazing grana cheese. For the vegetarians the Stagioni would probably win your hearts over with the artichokes, roasted peppers, grilled zucchini, portobello mushrooms, and of course their tasty shaved grana.The only problem is getting the pizza home in time before it's cold!!! We've had this pizza weekly for the last month and are huge fans....this is much easier for us to get than our other favorite pizza place, Spacca Napoli with their authentic wood-fired pizza!!!..Guess what I'm about to get after writing this review??"
"It has been interesting to read the other reviews for this restaurant, because it seems like my experience was very similar to many others. I came with a group of ten a few nights ago, and we sampled many different plates from the menu.  Overall, I was very disappointed in the quality of the food that came out of the kitchen.  Flavor was lacking in a big, big way, and it seemed to stem from a severe lack of seasoning.  A little salt and pepper could have done wonders.  Man, it was shocking how bland most of the food was.The worst dish of all was the pancetta wrapped dates.  This was not a problem of underseasoning--this was just plain horrible food.  The dates were incredibly small, and the seed inside was not removed prior to cooking.  The pancetta on the outside looked like the leftover scraps from some other meal.  I have had pancetta wrapped dates many times before and have even made them myself...these were bad.  Really bad.  Shame on the kitchen for putting these out.We moved on and got the veal meatballs, gnocchi, beef short ribs and orecchiette.  The general consensus around the table was that each of these were disappointing.  It's not like they were inedible, they just tasted completely blah.  It really was shocking how bland they were.The bright spot in the night was the sausage pizza and the torta al cioccolato we had for dessert.  The torta had a vey rich, smooth chocolate flavor, and to be honest, is one of the best chocolate desserts I've had in Chicago.The service was ok but not stunning.  The decor is, in my opinion, homey and comforting--I really like it.  It's a really nice space.Overall, the stakes for food in River North are very high.  I was really disappointed in the quality of the dishes and I think they need to work a lot harder to live up to expectations for restaurants in this neighborhood.  I have eaten here a few times prior, and I was sad to see the quality slip."
"Love the food, love the pitchers of Sangria!!!  I just really wish they would not ""lose"" my reservations all the time, well they don't lose them....I check in and then they forget about me, time before last I waited 30 minutes before going up and saying what in the world?  They say oh we are sorry come with us..this last time I waited 15 minutes she goes oh wow so sorry, come with me....That is very frustrating."
"The perfect melding of Spanish and Italian dishes to yield Italian Tapas!(now, there's really no Spanish fusion, it's all Italian, but, instead of family style, it's served tapas style).Great stuff stuff, and pretty reasonable.  Our part consisted of 4 couples, and with wine, our bill with gratuity was still under $300.  Plus, I felt satiated, which I NEVER do after eating tapas.  I really recommend the tortillini and grinder pizza.  Delish!"
"Quartino is a safe standby for me. The food is great- they have something for everyone. I get food envy regularly so I love the tapas/sharing style of Italian food that they provide. They, also, have the BEST Lambrusco (sparkling red)- please try it you won't be disappointed. There are only 2 downsides: 1) it can get loud, acoustics are bad, so it may not be ideal for large groups and 2) it can get touristy.I really enjoy myself every time!"
"My girlfriend and I arrived at 10:30 pm on a Friday night and the place was packed!  We were quickly seated though.  Our server was fantastic and the service overall was impressive.  The food was delicious.  Although I would not recommend the sun-dried tomato soup as it simply tastes like pasta sauce.  We also had the caprese and margarita pizza and both were excellent.  The liter of wine was also a fun touch.All in all a great experience, the second time I have been here and always look forward to returning!"
"AMAZING!Its the little things about this restaurant that make it an outstanding experience.  Such as, the owner of the restaurant coming to our table and asking us about the food/service, or the care our waitress took to make sure we found a wine that we enjoyed and went well with our dishes.  The food is simple and done to perfection.Call ahead for reservations because its always busy, its THAT good!"
"Really delicous tapas style Italian dishes.  We tried the white bean and garlic spread, escarole, veal meatball sliders, and plenty of red sangria.  Everything was delicious and we finished our meal with some zeppole (little Italian doughnuts) with honey.  I look forward to returning.  The highlight was being seated on the upper balcony overlooking the street and the activity of Chicago.  Loved it!"
"Nice place for Italian tapas and SEAFOOD! Love the scallop and the clams, the rib is also yum!"
"Great small plate Italian food and prompt service that's easy on the wallet earn Quartino four stars in my book. The veal meatballs, cavatelli pasta are a few favorites that always seem to be on the menu, and their risottos never disappoint. I often overlook the Salumeria menu (cheese, cured meats, olives, etc.) and forget to leave room for dessert, but the few times I've remember take note, I've never regretted it. Since Quartino is usually bustling, I'd recommend making a reservation. You could wait in the bar, but if it's busy, it's very likely the bar will be packed as well."
"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  Its shared plates are perfect for groups or to bring the out-of-town family members.  Love the outdoor seating in the summer too.  It can get pretty loud on the first floor, so if you're bring your grandma, I'd recommend requesting a table on the 2nd floor.  Cheap carafes of wine and the cheese & chocolate fondue round out a fabulous Italian experience."
"My first big meal in Chicago and I loved it. As soon as we got there, my friend and I were seated right away. The place wasn't as full since we went in the early evening but it got packed very quickly. They give you good bread to start off with before you order.  I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza and the linguini with clams pasta and MMMMMMMMM! The manager came around to uor table (I noticed he frequented quite a few tables; some seemed like regulars) and asked how everything was. My friend told him that she would have preferred something else (I can't remember what, exactly) but was not complaining. The manager insisted we get what we ordered exactly how we wanted or to order something completely different. We insisted that everything was fine.  A while later our server tells us that our meals are on the house and offered us a free dessert to go with it! WOW! It was unnecessary but I was completely satisfied and happy. We ordered the dark chocolate fondue with strawberries and it was so good. The chocolate was rich and creamy and the strawberries were fresh and sweet. It was definitely a great start to my vacation in Chicago and I would definitely go back someday. I give 5 stars for taste, service, and atmosphere. Really exceptional."
"I stopped into Quartino for lunch with coworkers, and knowing that the concept is Italian tapas, I was fairly sure that I wouldn't overeat.  Turns out, like most meals, I did.The decor is put together well, feeling like a old world kitchen with stacks of bread and hanging meats placed around the main dining room.  The food, wine, and prices were great.  My favorite dish was either the quattro stagioni pizza or the amazing shrimp or mushroom risotto.  The portions were much bigger than I thought they would be.  In fact, the pizza was probably enough for four of us to comfortably split for lunch.  For dessert, I would definitely recommend the hot chocolate cake and gelato, but it's a little hard to share.  Probably better suited for this is the zeppole, Italian doughnuts similar to the consistency of elephant ears, served with melted dark chocolate.  Not too filling and definitely delicious.My only complaint is that the table feels really small by the time all of the tapas are on the table.  The wines are served with a carafe and a very small glass, so it felt like I had too many plates and glasses in front of me pretty quickly.  I'd try to opt for a larger table the next time I go."
"Went there for my second time yesterday and it is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. As others described, it is small plate and I would suggest  two plates per person. You get the most bang for your buck with a pizza which I've had both times. I like that they let you get half and half on a pizza with no additional charge. (I got half a pizza that was $12 and half that was $10 and paid $11). To be honest though, I tried the pepperoni yesterday and thought it was a little too greasy. While pepperoni is usually a staple of my diet, I would suggest being a little more adventurous here (such as the Soprano with Veal meatballs and giardinera.).The bread is very fresh, served with oil and parmesan cheese that you grate yourself at the table. Both times I ordered may favorite appetizer, calamari, which was amazing. Don't be fooled when they refer to it as a ""small plate"". It is the same size as you would expect at any other restaurant when you order it as an appetizer. Yesterday I order the ravioli and tortellini which were excellent, and the time before I had the shrimp risotto and the vodka pasta. Most the dishes looked great so while I would recommend any of these four, I'll probably try a different two next time. As an added bonus when I went yesterday, there is outdoor seating right on State Street which is great for people watching.  I noticed some other reviews complained about the noise level inside (which may have been an issue last time, I remember it being really crowded inside) so sitting outside solves this problem as well."
"I'm a big fan of Quartino's.  If you are looking for someplace quiet, this is not the place for you, but if you love small plates, having a laugh of two with some friends, this is the perfect place.  Everything we had was fantastic."
"This is an upscale Olive Garden.The pasta is so insanely overcooked it really is insulting.  I was at a table for 14, so we definitely had a big enough sample size to be sure that this was always the case.  The pizza has some decent toppings but please, PLEASE, if you are going to make pizza and serve it to people, try to learn how to make a crust.  I am so sick of these places in Chicago where they really take for granted the craftsmanship it takes to make a decent dough and just whip together some crap and then top it with good ingredients and hope nobody notices that its on a piece of cardboard.I do give them two stars because they accommodated 14 of us and its kind of a lively atmosphere and its hard to find a place in Chicago focused on lots of passing of plates and sharing of foods.  So if you are not quite so obsessed with properly executing the basics of Italian cooking as I am you could pretty easily go here and have a good time.  Bottom line:  It is across from Chili's, just as it is across America, where it is known as the Olive Garden.  Though without the breadsticks I loved as a kid.Also I keep noticing the word ""homestyle"" -- Have you ever been in a home in Italy?  They would kick you out of the family for cooking spaghetti for 15 minutes like they do here."
"Quartino is the restaurant that my family lovingly refers to as ""Tapas Italian."" Everything is really small there, and you're supposed to order a bunch of little things and serve them family-style.I think the metal roof on the place really makes the sound of people talking go from a dull roar to downright screaming to hear each other. There's no music or anything, but when you walk out, your ears will be ringing from how loud the chatter was inside.The food is pretty good. Be sure to order things in triplicate so everyone gets some. It's that nouveau Italian thing, not really traditional... But I can forgive for good food."
"Italian angle to small plates and we left very happy. Went with out of town friends after a day at the art institute. Every plate we tried we loved. Their pasta is hand made. Pizza made from imported dough with perfect balance of crisp and chew. Risotto cooked perfectly. They have outdoor seating but its along state st which has steady traffic. While you feel space from pedestrians, i was sensitive to truck exhaust fumes. Still, a great way to cap our afternoon."
"Excellent to-share italian tapas. We had a selection of cheese, duck proscuito, olives, grilled peppers, beet salad and a pizza. All that accompanied by a good red wine. It was delicious and very affordable. The place is popular and busy. Eat outside on the terrace as the inside is very loud when filled with customers."
"Every city needs one of these...mad busy, chaotic, shouldn't work but does! Food arrived in an ad hoc way. What we ordered was very good but one main arrived well after the others so just as well we were happy to share. Our server was very good and overall we thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
"I've officially been to Quartino 4 times and I can't think of anything negative to say.... maybe that its hard to share with picky eaters or to split the bill with cheap people (neither of which are quartinos faultEverything on the menu is great, service is great, DONT MISS: Bellinis and the donuts... seriously deliciousyou can't go wrong!"
"Great food, but the WTF is up with the wide-ass tables?  Shouting just to have a conversion is what this makes this restaurant more of a battlefield than an intimate dining experience."
"I was impressed by Quartino in many ways. It emphasizes itself as a pizzeria and a wine bar, and they serve many of their dishes in smaller appetizer portions. You can then try many different items, just like the way we did at the recent Yelp party. The thin crust pizzas are delicious, with crispy crusts and without an overload of toppings. The pizza slices were clearly the hit of the evening, and anyone who digs thin crust should order a pizza or two here (they're not that large - again ""smaller"" portions). There were also some bruschetta-like items with tempting toppings like sun-dried tomatoes and portobello mushrooms, though they overwhelmed the bread into a semi-soggy state. I imagine Quartino prepared a lot of these items for the 150+ crowd, so they may have sat for a bit. I am sure the bread will stand up a bit better if you order directly from the menu. We also enjoyed meatballs and polenta fries (a look-alike for mozzarella sticks) for this fine appetizer buffet. The cocktail special was a bellini, a peachy-champagney mix which was interesting but a bit sweet for others. Every employee at Quartino seemed to be efficient, pleasant, or a combination of both. I would love to come back to Quartino for a real meal sometime soon.Give a 21-Yelp salute to Andrea and Elizabeth for setting up this swell soiree at Quartino. Cool Yelp stuff too - love the new baseball cap."
"The atmosphere was great and very enjoyable!  The food was VERY affordable and the portions were just right.  I highly recommend ordering a lot of food so you can try a lot of the stuff they are noted for, but smaller portions.  If you like the smaller portions, you can always go big the next round! ;-)My boyfriend and I were running a little late for our 7:00pm dinner reservations and we called to tell them we would be late.  They were very nice and said they'd hold our reservations.  When we arrived, there were TONS of people waiting for tables, with at least a 45 minute wait (it was a Friday night).  We were seated right away- even though we were running a few minutes behind.  Our waitress was fabulous!  Because neither of us had been to Quartino's before she spent a lot of time going over the menu and telling us popular items.  She was very honest about portion sizes and said we could order more depending on whether or not we were still hungry.  We ordered a bottle of wine to start (highly recommend checking out the Wine of the Month part), and the Veal Meatballs.  They were delicious ;-)  We then ordered a smaller order of the Asparagus, which ended up being pureed.  It was very tasty!   For dinner, we split a Margarita Pizza which we made 1/2 Margarita and 1/2 Stefano (recommended by the waitress).  The Stefano portion was a little spicy, but definitely worth it if you like a little kick on your pizza!  Overall, our experience was great and we'd definitely go back!"
Had dinner there with some friends and as usual the service was terrific and the food was fabulous.
"Quartino, will you marry me?This is my favorite go-to dinner place in the city. Nothing beats it for large groups and it works perfectly for dinner for two. I've been there just about every day of the week and for both lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed. Its also so affordable! Like magic, the bill always ends up being much cheaper than you expect based on what you order [we like to play guess the bill when we go there and we always guess too much].The house wine is fantastic...and cheap! You can't beat it. They have a large wine selection beyond that as well as desert drinks to finish off your meal with. The tapas selection seems endless and the service is fantastic. Its quite impressive to me that in a restaurant that always seems to be busting at the seems, they never skimp on service. I've been to plenty of restaurants that can't keep up when I'm the only customer there. And any restaurant that can handle a group of 15 people on a Saturday night during restaurant week and make us feel like we were the only table in the place gets extra props.Must eat: sausage rissoto, gnocci, eggplant parmesan, pizza [its all good], garlic shrimp, fondueIf you are in the mood for desert definitely go with the italian donuts with both sauces [caramel and chocolate]Whatever you do, get to this restaurant immediately. You won't regret it."
"Other than its infamous pizza, Quartino serves Italian tapas style plates. I've never been that impressed with Quartinos in the past few visits so decided to give Quartinos another try. We tried a variety of dishes: vodka penne, shrimp risotto, scallops, beef short ribs. They were all pretty good but nothing phenomenal that I needed to come back for. Why is Quartino's getting 4 stars though? Because of its pizza. Each time I've come to Quartinos, the pizza usually saves them and this last time, our argula duck prosciotto pizza was a winner. It was sooo good with its perfectly thin and crispy crust, thinly sliced prosciotto with monstrous amounts of fresh argula on top. OMG - so darn good. I want some right now! I would venture back to Quartinos but only for its pizza."
my favorite go-to restaurant! always consistent and always a pleasure. the only downfall is their waittimes!none the less I'm always willing to wait for some of their margharita pizza =)
"I love the atmosphere here - felt like a place in Europe.  It was a bit noisy,  but in a good way - conversation was not hindered.  Wonderful service - charming waiter.  Food was very good and not very expensive, depending of course on what you order.  Except for that crazy expensive bottle of wine my companion picked out, it was very reasonable.  A fun place."
"Good Italian food tapas-style. Cool decor, great value."
"Came on a Saturday night with a large group of friends. Bustling atmosphere, fun and young. We were seated after about 30 mins despite reservations. We ordered a few of the small plates--short ribs, seafood special (lobster, clams), eggplant parmesean, gnocchi with pesto, rigatoni with chicken and cream. Nothing was impressive, all pretty average. The gnocchi was pretty dense and chewy. Short ribs had great flavor but was a bit dry, and there was nothing special about the seafood plate. It might have been our choice of dishes. I would have loved to try the bone marrow, the veal meatballs, and the polenta fries. Overall, pretty average, may be worth a second trip, but not before I try all the must-go places in Chicago."
"Used the amazing Yelp app for iPhone while wandering the streets of Chi-town (admittedly in classic tourist style) to find this killer Italian joint. Definitely a much cooler place than we would have found using the guidebooks from the hotel/airport.Sat outside on a corner patio around 5:30 p.m., which has a more chill vibe than the more fancy interior. Great when you've been trekking the streets of Chi all day, haven't swapped your tennis shoes for heels yet, but are in dire need of pasta. (Here's a pic of us, enjoying a girls' getaway weekend: bit.ly/ccBIqQ.)For a table of three, we ordered three apps and a 1/2 carafe of white sangria. Sangria was really only enough for one generous glass each, and was refreshing if without that special ""kick"" nice strong sangrias have.Italian small plates looked small, but the portions are very generous. Rustica flatbread was the only loser of the bunch -- it was filling but a little bland. Onions were the only real flavor - not enough pancetta and ""grana"" on the menu (""grain"" in Italian) apparently means thin-sliced potatoes. A little off.However, the Cavatelli was brimming with basil & gooey ricotta cheese -- I could have eaten it all myself. The Orecchiette was also amazing, with a lovely thick pasta and spicy meat.Definitely recommend for the food, moderate prices, and even more so for the wait staff who weren't snotty -- even though we were almost under-dressed and we were in full-on giggly girl and tourist mode."
"We love Quartino. I could go here once a week. I was asked  ""why don't you try somewhere different?"" before we went this weekend. My answer: ""Sometimes you don't mess with the sure thing."" Quartino is a guarantee for a fun, delicious, wine-infused evening!Inside in the first floor dining area has a great, fun atmosphere. Sort of a vintagey feel. I love how they play of old school Italian movies on little TVs in the corners. Gets a little loud, but this is a great place for a group of friends or a date.The outside patio is really nicely done. Great for people watching. We've sat close to the street before, but they have nice little planters that soften the feel.We have been here several times before- a reservation for a weekend is a total must! If not, be prepared to wait up to 2 hours for a table. Yikes!Lovely wine selections. This Friday it was a little warm so we tried a half carafe of the white sangria while waiting for our table to be ready. YUMMY! You could tell there was a lot of pureed fresh fruit in there.  Peaches? Pears? Citrus? So tasty and refreshing! Then with dinner we had a pinot grigiot. Very reasonably priced!The food here is great-small plates let you try lots of different things off of the menu. We love, love, love the linguine with clams! One of my other faves is the pizza with the spicy salami and fresh basil. I could eat the entire thing myself, but that would defeat the purpose of the whole ""sharing"" idea. The prosciutto wrapped, cheese stuffed dates drizzled with honey (wow!) are to die for...The only problem with going here is that you will walk out stuffed from ""needing to try"" just one more thing!I can't wait for our next visit!"
"Mmmm it's good!But maybe I just can't give it 4 stars because my mom loves it?  The service is always nice and helpful, the desert is amazing, the wine is good and when I got home I started drinking wine out of my juice glasses to feel more Italian.  Just a little touristy for me. Hmm. Tip: Do yourself a favor and check out the bathroom.  You may get lost trying to find it, but damn, I felt like Alice falling down the rabbit hole once I got in there."
"I went with a group of girls for dinner last week. Although we had a reservation, we had to wait for a table to open up. We were pleasantly surprised when we were offered a complimentary glass of wine while we waited. Our waiter was with us soon after we were seated, and we ordered a few small plates to start. Everything we tried was served within minutes, and was absolutely delicious!We found the whole experience to be fun and affordable! Definitely worth another trip!"
"I don't know why I've delayed RAVING about this place...Quartino's is my ""go-to"" restaurant when I'm downtown.  I LOVE IT!  So many positives:open late late night, very affordable, tappas-style let's you try a little of everything, outdoor seating, and most importantly- the FOOD is DELICIOUS!!  Duck proscuitto is my favorite and we get it everytime I go in some fashion.  Even their olive oil served in the beginning with the bread, is AMAZING- you can TASTE the olive flavor in the oil- I'm still working on trying to buy some to have at home!  Service is great as well; you will never go wrong at this place!  Try it, it will quickly become your favorite too!!"
"A few girlfriends and I were in Chicago for a bachelorette party. We decided to try out Quartino on a Saturday night based on all the positive yelp reviews and yummy looking pictures. We had the veal meatballs, which I personally loved. We also tried the polenta fries (interesting, but not as good as regular french fries of course), lamb shank (melt in your mouth meat and one of the larger dishes we had), a ribbon pasta with meat (also very good). My only complaint was with the pork belly. The flavorings were good (pork and apple always go great together), but the pork belly was very dry. For dessert, we had the profiteroles and tiramisu, both delicious and the perfect ending. Tiramisu is off the menu so make sure to ask your waiter about it. For drinks, the peach bellini was really refreshing! Would love to return, too bad Chicago is so far away!"
"My 2 stars is solely for the service and I mean that in a good way. The servers were very friendly, informed, and attentive. If they weren't, this place was getting 1 star. The restaurant has no ambiance, which seems to be the theme of the River North restaurants. It all feels fake and touristy - which it is. We got the Veal Meatball sliders, which were pretty good - 3 stars. We had the mushroom risotto, which was terrible. It had no flavor. I actually had to salt it - 0 stars. The last thing we had was the pappardelle, which was fine - 2.5-3 stars. I will not be coming back and will not be recommending it to anyone."
"Quartino is a great place for a group, hands down.  I always go with a group and share entrees and small plates.  The food is consisently good, but nothing outstanding.  The pizza is probably my favorite, and you can't go wrong with any of the standard Italian entrees like bruschetta, etc.  My favorites are the gnocchi and the asparagus risotto.  If you are an asparagus fan like me, you will love this risotto, as it has a really strong flavor (in a good way).  It's a good sized place, and I have never had to wait very long for a table.  It's a little loud, but since I am typically there with a group to eat and drink for a couple of hours, we tend to get louder too.  If you want a good place for a group outing, this is definitely a good choice."
"Came here for a weekday lunch. It was a little loud - a large group near us was having a birthday celebration - but not bad. We ordered pasta and pizza. The pasta was excellent, but we didn't like the Trevisella pizza at all. When we let our waiter know, he offered us another pizza instead. I applaud their excellent service and would come here again!"
"After a busy day on the Magnificent Mile my wife and I ended up at Quartino. It was noisy, very noisy, almost unnecessarily noisy- but in a good way. Frankly we enjoyed the energy of the place. This is about Italian communal dining; each dish is delivered as soon as it is ready, there is a stack of small plates on each table and wine is served by the carafe, so this is all about sharing. We enjoyed the food and the experience."
"Loud, mediocre food, hard to move around, slow service.I wasn't impressed."
Holy crap!!! This is my 3rd time come here. My coffee has DETERGENT in it! I told the waiter but he DIDN'T  say sorry to me! I hate this place and will not come here any more !
"I've been to Quartino many times and have always had good meals there.  The food is always fresh and tasty, and prices are reasonable.  The house wine is good, which can't be said for many places.  I appreciate that there are a lot of tasty vegetarian options, which is of course common for most Italian places.  I love the polenta fries, and the pizzas are tasty and crispy.  The Nutella panini are terrific too--gooey and warm, and a great end to a fun meal."
"Great Food, had a reservation for 7:00 on a Sunday night, got there a little early and had no problem being seated. The waitress was great. Will go back next time we are in Chicago."
"Quartino is probably one of the best values in downtown chicago.  The total bill for dinner here for me, and 4 friends was under $70 (before tip).  We had a nice table outside, and the service was good.  Also, it's a fun place to eat in a group, since everything is meant to be shared.I only give it 3 stars because I felt like all the food was a bit lackluster.  We had tried many things too:- bread: didn't taste very fresh, this is disappointing for an Italian restaurant-cheese fondue: I just did not like the cheese.  It tasted like it had some sour cream in it.  Still, at $10, this is a terrific value.-pizza: thin crust, and not bad, but I felt like the sauce was a bit bland, and could have been more flavorful-polenta fries: these were interesting, and pretty good, but the red pepper dipping sauce was disappointing-prosciutto: delicious! no complaints therewe also shared a few desserts, which were pretty good:-chocolate fondue: in contrast to the cheese fondue, this was good, and chocolate was (at least in my opinion) high quality.- vanilla gelato and banana sundae: also pretty good. So, I'd recommend this place, if you are downtown, in a group, and need somewhere for dinner that won't break the bank.  It's a fun place to eat, and the food is good."
"I came here one day when i was on a work trip and i decided to eat here 2 times! it was great cause i was with some coworkers and we were able to try many different things on the menu since they are more of a place that likes to ""share"" their food... i appreciate variety so this was just perfect for my likings. When i ate the first night it was super crowded and loud, but it didn't bother me cuase my group was probably contributing to the noise level.. for lunch the next day it was like an entire different place and vibe. i enjoyed both visits."
"My wife and I love Tapas bars. It allows you to taste many different plates as you can share and minimizes a bad experience from just one dish. So after coming to Chicago for a conference and checking Yelp we gave Quartino a try. It is not a pure Spanish Tapas restaurant, so if you are a purist you may be disappointed. But the food was from good to very good and it was an enjoyable experience.We had read some reviewers complaining about service, but to be hones the service was good. The octopus was hands down the best dish from our lot, not so chewy, so I would rate it from very good to excellent. All of the others were from good to very good. We try the eggplant, dates stuffed with gorgonzola and then wrapped in bacon (kind of hard not to like this one wherever you go), shrimp and lobster ravioli.If you want to get the most of this Italian Tapas restaurant, try to go with 2-3 other persons so you can sample many items on the menu.Prices were reasonable. Very nice ambiance, a little loud, but it adds to it.My final rating: 3.5 stars"
"I travel for business almost weekly, and I find myself in Chicago frequently.  I have eaten at Quartino 4 or 5 times in the last several months and have had a good experience each time; usually I want to get in, get a nice meal (the food is consistently good), and get back to business. The bar staff has always been friendly, courteous, and a general pleasure, so it's right up my alley.This is the first time I'm writing a review because I always think you get the true measure of a place when you have an issue or problem of some sort and you see how it's handled.  This evening I had a minor issue, and it was taken care of swiftly and in a way that exceeded expectations.  (No, it doesn't matter what it was.)  So in my mind that warrants a nice review.   Thanks for exhibiting exceptional customer service.  Things happen once in a while, and I'll still be back."
"As always this is a great space for large groups and a fun evening. It's crowded, loud and fun. You order for the table, so if you really want something get two.The fondue rocks, as does the zucchini pizza. Gnochi....calamari...polenta fries...there's really nothing that's not good here."
"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago! The location is great, the prices are reasonable, the food is fabulous, and the service is awesome. It can't get any better. This is not a chain. I usually take the Funghi pizza and then try another dish or two while I'm here. It can get crowded some nights so reservations would be useful."
"I've only been here twice. Once for drinks (really crowded) and once for dinner (really crowded). This review is for my dinner experience. We stopped by on a busy Saturday night. We were seated immediately; our table was upstairs, tucked into a corner near an exit door, where they eventually shuttled a table through (Watch your head!). Prices are affordable and I like the option to order wine by the 1/4, 1/2, etc. carafe. It allows you to sample before you leap. (Unfortunately, I didn't like either of the wines we tried.) We started with bruschetta, which tasted too dry and crispy. The boys had a meat plate that they said was okay. For entrees, they ordered tagliatelle and ravioli. They said those were okay too. I ordered a veggie pasta dish that was a big disappointment. (It was very bland.) I hope this was an off-night for the restaurant because friends have told me how much they like the food here. I guess I will have to give it another try..."
"I love this restaurant.  It's a great place to take large groups because all of the food is served tapas style (small plates brought to you as they're ready) so it's fun and casual and everyone can sample everything.  A few of my favorites are the polenta fries, the pizza with walnuts and pears, and the delicious white bean dip.  Great wine list, consistently good service, and make sure to get a reservation-- everyone else knows how good this place is too!"
"I have been here numerous times over the years since I work in the neighborhood. To be fair, I will state from the beginning that I get a small industry discount because of my job and the staff knows myself and my coworkers since we are regular fixtures in the bar late at night. But there is a reason this place is one of the top-grossing restaurants in all of Chicago, apart from the fact that it is owned by the Gibson group and they do great marketing.That said, I love this place almost entirely. I've had great service in the dining room, outside, and in the bar. Since I'm mostly in the bar these days, I'll recommend sitting at a table and getting Liz, if you can. She's a sweetheart.Food: The pizzas are tasty- the crust is crispy without being too hard. The salads are shareable and can be ordered in a half portion. The appetizers are generously sized. Between those categories, I am always comfortable ordering a few things and splitting them between the group. Don't be afraid, here or anywhere else, to ask for WHAT YOU WANT. I will modify a pasta or pizza or salad to better meet my wants and needs and they accommodate me cheerfully here. I wish the salad selection was wider and that's my only menu gripe. Why isn't there a delicious fruit-cheese-nut salad with basic greens? Drinks: Full bar, reasonably priced for the location. I like that you can choose the size of your wine portion from quartino to full bottle. The mimosas and bellinis are great and served in customizable portions as well. Martinis are strong. Whew. Ambiance: Warm and cozy. Outdoor seating when weather permits, old world charm inside and out with chalkboards updated with specials and wines, an upper level for additional dining and restrooms. Even the restrooms are charming with the old school Borax soap. TVs in the bar to keep up with Chicago sports. Finally, how cute is it that there is a little market area where you can buy reasonably priced bottles of wine to go? That's a nice touch and a great thing for the travelers who stay in the hotels nearby. On that note, food is easily ordered to go and wrapped nicely. I will be back again and again, of course."
"The veal meatball sliders were decent at about $3 a piece.  The duck prosciutto pizza was just OK, you couldn't even taste the prosciutto. The veal meatball pizza was also just OK with lots of celery. The free bread was dry and not very tasty. The zeppole was awesome, light, and fluffy."
"This place was excellent. The food was good, the wine was good, the atmosphere was good... I would definitely go back!My only complaints were that for a place who's motto is ""where wine is cheaper than water,"" I didn't think the wine was that cheap. I guess compared to other Italian restaurants maybe, but we got a liter for $36, which we finished pretty quickly. Other than that, our bill was reasonable and the food was great. The pizzas are a bargain, and the tapas style is a great way to sample.Oh, and this place is loud. It's not obnoxiously loud, but if you're gonna come here for a date, be prepared to talk above other people. There's a berry chill across the street too, so it's  a nice cap off."
"Good food, very fast service.  Only thing keeping it from another star is that it was really (really) loud.  We had a reservation for 8:30 but arrived early and they seated us immediately.  A little tight too but that's nitpicking."
"Not sure if it was the drinks and friends, or just the food, but I had one of my best meals in recent memory here.  The place is packed and with good reason.  Small plate Italian, but big taste.  I really like the traditional olives and sausages.  They have a great wine selection to bring out the savory flavors.  Good pepper and cheese dishes as well.  Rich and wonderful.  The flat bread pizzas are okay, not spectacular, but a good filler for the meal.  I highly recommend the veal dish and calamari. Go with a large group so you can try a multitude of dishes."
Get the tiramasou! It's not on the menu so you have to ask for it.
"Loved this place.  Good food, fast service, reasonable prices & nice ambiance.  Enough said.  I'd come back again next time i am in Chicago."
"I've been about two dozen times, both when I lived in Chicago, and every time I've been back since.  I'll keep going, as long as it stays the same.This is a great Italian small-plates place from which a lot of the new, trendy Italian Tapas restaurants can learn.The pizza is exceptional, the ingredients fresh and tasty, and the price is great ($10-$12 for about 12"").  The grilled octopus appetizer is near-perfect. The wine selection is extensive, and there is a large variety of wines available in small, medium, and large carafes.  There's a nice variety of cheeses and olives, and the coffee and biscotti are a must-have at the end of your meal.I would have gone with 5 stars if I had stuck to my usual menu (octopus and pizza), but I branched out, and there were a few less-than-stellars.  The caponata was somewhat bland, not at all what I was expecting (maybe my grandmother's version is bastardized, but it's what I'm used to).  But the eggplant parm was pretty good.  The bread could be better.  Next door, at Osteria via Stato, they do it right.The service has always been exceptional, both at the bar and at a table.  Maybe it's that Chicago kindness, but I always leave happy with the service.  *****Message to the chefs at Coppa in Boston:  Get on a plane to Chicago, go to State and Ontario, and see how it's done. *****"
Had a great study break dinner with a friend of mine - friendly and cute waiter...yummy carafe of house red....great spaghetti with lamb ragu.  Enjoyable evening over all!
"I haven't sat for table service here yet, but I did come for drinks after work around midnight. We sat at a table in the bar, which did have waitress service.What a nice surprise - my drink was STIFF (none of that watery, more-soda-than-scotch crap you find at some other Chicago bars), the pizza we ordered was nice and crispy and thin (though a bit greasy), the clams were awesome (and the waitress brought more bread for sopping up the sauce - no charge) and my caprese was very good... nice, fresh mozz. Our server was incredible - attentive, despite the bar being incredibly crowded. This definitely wasn't the cheapest place I've ever been, but after nine hours on my feet I'll come here to satisfy my scotch and pizza craving at midnight any time."
"Good food, reasonable prices, easy to get reservations, large portions."
"My friend and I - two famished, near-bitchy-mode gals - found ourselves rushing to Quartino after a whole morning of retail therapy in the area.  We spent the next 2 hours feasting on yummy Italian ""tapas"" -- the duck prosciutto & arugula pizza, veal meatballs (my fav!), eggplant parm, etc, etc - and calming our nerves with some lovely Chianti.  I often use the bread metrics as a proxy measure of the food quality of any European-cuisine restaurant.  And I must say Quartino's crusty, warm bread was a winner.  Service was friendly and fast.  A fun, casual ambiance with a touch of River North chic-ness.  Great for family dining, friendly outings, or casual, fun dates."
"Holy price increases, Batman!  Quartino, your pizza is still fabulous, and I do love your wine, but a 25% increase in your prices?  I know $20 for a carafe of wine is by no means unreasonable, but when I'm expecting $16?  That's quite a sticker shock.  And the food prices have gone up as well.Look, I realize that costs are going up for everybody, I really do.  But a 25% increase.  Yowzer."
"Exellent food, excellent service.  A must stop on any trip to Chicago."
Great for a group. We had a wonderful time with our group of 7. Food was very good especially the tortellini with prosciutto. Wine was good and reasonable.  They had a great lunch special.  I wish I worked in the area so I could take advantage.  I will be back very soon!
"Quartino is the best tapas restaurant in Chicago!!! Either with a large group or with a friend for lunch on Sunday afternoon!!! The service is AMAZING and I promise you, it NEVER fails!! The food selection is divine. Chef John Coletta is magnifiquel!! I highly recommend the ravioli, the pork belly, crispy calamari and of course... the arugula thin crust pizza!!!! DELICIOUS.... Hats off to the chef!!!!!"
I went with a group of people that didn't really know each other so the experience would have probably been better with a group that felt comfortable sharing plates.  The service was great...friendly staff.  I can agree with some of the other reviewers about the noise level.  The people on the other side of our table weren't really able to join in my conversation.I had the mushroom risotto which was really tasty!  I'd be interested in updating my rating once I have a chance to return with a different group.
"Quartino is a really good value.  I love it because it's loud, the food is great, the wine is cheap and good.  It's great for a birthday, special occasion, or just a casual dinner - it's always a mix of dressy and casual, locals and tourists.I always get a cheese and olive tray - comes with really good condiments like spicy grape relish.  Last time I was there I ordered the Montepulciano d'Abruzzo - a refreshing and tasty red wine.  They serve small plates and flatbread pizzas.  The food comes out as it's ready, they give you bar towels and mismatched silverware, and oh yeah - quartinos (quartini?) are awesome! About a glass and a half of wine in a small carafe.  Most of the wine is available in carafes or bottles, they have a huge list in a wide price range.This place is huge but it's always busy.  I recommend a reservation on a Saturday night especially for a group.  Other nights you can usually get seated pretty fast, they serve the full menu in the bar seating as well."
"We loved this place. It was fun, good prices, super loud inside, good looking people, our server was awesome, and the food was awesome. Get the pork shank, it looks scary, but the meat is so fucking good."
"Stopped in on a bustling Thursday night and got right in. Kind of surprised at how busy it was but since we got seated promptly I was happy. Split a pizza and a couple small plates , nothing crazy good but nothin bad either. Food was solid. Beers were quick. Waitress was on top of it. Considering how busy they were I think they may deserve a higher rating... 3 1/2 stars! So let it be written , so let it be done! It is busy , if its more than two you might want to get reservations. Enjoy!"
"Great pick for a casual dinner- yummy pizza and not too expensive.  Twice now I've had their prosecco and it was either free (part of a mother's day deal) or only $5 for a very full glass.  Beware- its always packed, even on a Tuesday night!"
"I was waiting all day to experience ""Italian Tapas"" but was sorely disappointed!  I left feeling unfulfilled and still hungry.  The food was just okay....there was nothing exciting, nothing that made me do the happy dance.  The Margherita Pizza was decent but nothing to write home about, the Crisp Calamari was exactly that ""Crisp"" but they should have added ""Chewy"" to the name.  The waiter graciously took it back and the second order was a bit better.  Their desserts were AMAZING!!! We ordered the Zeppole (Hot Italian Doughnuts with Dark Chocolate sauce and the Torta Al Cioccolato (Hot Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Gelato)!  I was doing a happy gig in my seat!  I would definitely go back for the desserts!!"
"The place is 'related' to my favorite Steak restaurant Gibsons (at least thats what the ""toilet guy"" told me). Well, the place is good - lively bar, good food (i was there on Restaurant week) and a good Italian wine list - its one of very few places in Chicago where they have Ripasso. So what I dont get is why they cant invest in a couple of real wine glasses. We had a bottle of Amarone and then later the Ripasso and when you get two so rich wines they need oxygen and i need to be able to get the full bouquet (read swirl the wine). Call me whatever, but i just think that was dumb!When you are there, remember to ask for the Tiramisu  - its not on the menu, but they have it (not the worlds best Tiramisu, but still good)."
"There's nothing really wrong with Quartino, but I haven't found any particular reason to pick it. The food is modestly priced and modestly good. Each trip, one dish usually ends up being terrible though, and there's nothing excellent to offset it.Add the cramped space, the poor quality of the bread (that bread ""Q"" is such a tease), and the indifferent service, and I'm just not into the experience. I am docking a star for shared plates, since enough is enough of this trend. I'd like to have dinner when I go out for dinner.I've been here at least a half dozen times, and one trip stands out as excellent. This was for a large group -- for which Quartino's is perfect. But if you have a smaller party you might as well go elsewhere.My girlfriend loves this place, and she's going to hate this review. So let me try to smooth things over a bit here... HI SWEETIE! You look GREAT tonight! Can I give you a back rub and then make you some supper??"
"Before I even moved to Chicago I went to Quartino and really enjoyed the food but not the company I was with. Now that I live here I decided to take some of my visiting friends in hopes for a better experience. It was a Saturday night and PACKED, I would definitely make a reservation, which we did and pretty much sat down as soon as our entire party arrived. The hostess stand was kind of a cluster so I was glad for the prompt seating. We sat upstairs at a table overlooking State Street. As soon as we sat down we had bread and waters and shortly after our server Aldo came. He was awesome! We pretty much entrusted him with our entire order and loved everything! He even suggested a wine to compliment it all and we ordered a large carafe of it. Trust me it doesn't look big, but between the four of us it was plenty! Then, after dinner, Aldo brought us two desserts on him. It was a great experience, I will definitely be going back to Quartino and asking for Aldo sometime soon."
"Good: polenta fries, duck prosciutto, beet salad Ok: Scallops, Gnocchi, the Sangria (which was SO cheap!)Bad: MusselsThis was like the Wal-Mart of tapas restaurants--it was HUGE, filled with people grubbing for deals, and had a selection of weirdly cheap wine. Ok, the grubbing for deals part was a stretch.Anyway, I thought the food was tolerable to good, depending on the dish. Somewhat of an experience to eat in such a crazy popular restaurant, but choose your dishes wisely!Avoid the mussels--a friend @ our table ordered these and the consensus was that they smelled and presumably tasted something like cat litter--but check out the polenta fries and the beet salad. Not sure I'd come back here again for a real meal, but they have such cheap sangria that I think it might be a good place to have a few drinks and eat some appetizers/dessert!"
"It is apparent that Quartino is a member of the Gibsons family of restaurants  in the quality of their food and service. The restaurant is ALWAYS packed and lively (probably their location right off the Magnificent Mile adds to their capacity...). What are you looking for? A tourist trap? Local hang out? Family friend fuel? Quartino has it all. The restaurant is extremely loud, don't come round if you want an intimate setting.But the food is consistently good; guests eat from small shared plates that come out at will. Service is friendly and speedy, and small plates are cleared quickly to avoid clogged table tops. I've never had a bad experience here."
"I've been here a few times and I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant. The wait staff is great and the ambiance can't be beat.The meats and cheeses you can order as a form of anti-pasto are absolutely excellent. The polenta fries are covered in a savory panco breading and are quite tasty. Also, they have several great pizzas to choose from. I have tried the portobello with crushed tomatoes and the four-cheese pizzas - both were great. I guess if I have to think of something that isn't great about this place would be that it's so popular that it's usually very crowded and with that comes a noise level that can make it hard to carry on a conversation."
"The Prosciutto is an amazing, amazing thing.This is the place to go with a big group.  You can order many things, pass them around, and have a great time.  4 people or more, awesome.The food is really exceptionally good.  I will return for sure.  I can easily see this reaching the 5-star stratosphere in the future.Other than the God-Send Prosciutto, the noquis were very good.  Pizza, not so awesome."
"We kicked off our wedding day by having all of our family meet up at Quartino to get to know each other before the wedding.  Good wine, family style portions was the perfect way to get everyone to interact with one another.When we were seated, it took a little bit before everyone came in, but our waiter was patient and attentive until all of our family arrived.  This is a special place for  my husband and I, because we ""celebrated"" here every time we felt like celebrating, anything from a new condo to a new couch, and now our two families coming together.My mom and my sister loved the place, and my husband's family always like coming here, for any reason.  The food, wine and service is consistently good."
"We went here on a Saturday night, with reservations for 8:30p.  Apparently, that's bachelorette party time.  I counted 5 parties in our area alone.  My fiance and I discussed why women seem to love Quartinos so much...perhaps because you can eat a lot, but it doesn't look like it because the plates are so small??Anyway, I digress.  I always enjoy this place.  I don't come often, especially considering the crowds.  But every time I dine here, I always walk out satisfyingly full and happy.  While this place tends to be better for larger parties, the two of us had quite an enjoyable time.We started with the meat and cheese- Parmesan and salami.  Both were delicious.  We also had the polenta fries, the shrimp in olive oil and lemon, and the penne in vodka sauce.  The waiter suggested adding a protein to the pasta, and sausage seemed to really enhance the already delicious pasta.  Those polenta fries are killer.  The shrimp was really good as well.  Although we most certainly didn't need it, we ordered the doughnuts for dessert.  They were really good.  I would have asked for the chocolate sauce to go were that not very silly sounding.Overall, we had a great time and quite enjoyed our meal.  Yes, the place is a little cheesy, packed to the gills with tourists and bachelorette parties galore, but I guess that just adds to the entertainment value."
The new(er) pizza with the cheese fondue on it is amazing. Its a must order.
"I was in town for a conference, and after a day of scientific talks and a 3 1/2 mile trek back to my hotel, I wasn't feeling the usual uber-well reviewed, trendy, put-some-heels-on River North eatery.  I wanted to put my comfy shoes and a sweater on a shove some Italian in my face.  Thankfully, Quartino was 2 blocks away from my hotel.  I initially dismissed it  as probably touristy and over-priced , but the yelp reviews were great and the price was right, so I gave it a try.  Quartino far exceeded my expectations.  I sat at the bar, where the service was friendly and attentive and the decor was elegant and cozy.  The wine list was both quality, reasonably-priced and perfectly sized (1/4 liter was perfect for relaxing without waking up with cobwebs the next morning). The Italian Tapas concept is genius, although probably not novel, but who doesn't have trouble deciding what they want at an Italian restaurant?  I ordered the pizza bianca and eggplant parm and both were really, really good.  The pizza bianca wasn't quite what I was expecting- it was alot drier than the traditional olive oil/fresh mozarella concoction that I usually get when I ask for pizza bianca- but it tasted awesome enough to make me forget about all of the other pizza biancas I have ever been with.  The eggplant parm was exactly what it should have been- hearty, cheesy and delicious.  The only thing that kept me from staying at the bar, nursing carafes of wine and trying to stuff some dessert in myself  was my desire to head back to my hotel and slap on my spandex-waist yoga pants (WARNING: NOT A SKINNY-JEAN-FRIENDLY ESTABLISHMENT. If Quartino lived in Ann Arbor, I would be there A LOT.  If you are looking for cozy, reasonably-priced and delicious, I cannot think of another restaurant in the area that fits the bill better.Only negative was how noisy it was, but it was also the NCAA Tournament Final."
"After a bit of a hiatus, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed my meal.  Definitely have some pizza.  The salads were also a great treat.  I also had two different types of pastas but unfortunately forget what they were (it's been a few weeks).  In any case, I think Quartino is definitely a hit or miss.  On the good days, I love them.Service was spot on too."
"This is my favorite *good* italian place to dine without spending money worth a bran new pair of stilettos on one meal.**********Always always always have great service**********I think I've tried a bite almost everything from the menu, minus the fondue.  Amongst them I especially love....  Peach bellini, grilled octopus appetizer, caprese salad with the best balsamic reduction and freshest mozzarella, ear shaped pasta with ricotta, lamb chops, and italian donuts with honey.It's a comfortable, casual, beautiufl place to have a relaxing lunch/dinner.  You don't need to speak in hushed voices and you can laugh out loud.  The women's bathroom is sooooo pretty too, haha. One day I'm going to break in and steal their silverware collection- they have about 10~15 different sets that they mix and match... all matte silver with fine details, some with faux lace prints, flower decorations, scalloped edges.. The plates have an old French vintage feel as well."
"Since we forgot Xoco was closed on Mondays, we regrouped and found ourselves at Quartino. Everything was good, pretty standard.House wine was very inexpensive and very good.Ambiance was good, but very loud inside (~7pm)Overall I would go back if I was in the area and didn't have any other better options."
"Pretty good foods with reasonable prices in this neighborhood.  Think Italian-esque food Tapas style.  Also, the wine prices are decent, which is rare.This is what 2 of us ordered to share.Let's get started:White Bean Garlic Spread - Very tasty dish.  Served with pieces of toasted bread.  The garlic taste is not overwhelming,  and the consistency  is good.  They give you a well sized dish of the stuff, so be sure to ask for more bread.Eggplant Parmigiana: Divine!  Melts in your mouth, not too much cheese and seasoned superbly.  Caprese salad:  Again, large portion.  Mozzarella was so fresh as were the tomatoes.  I did add a little pepper to the salad, but that just be my own taste buds preference.Asparagus Risotto:  TO DIE FOR.  This was my favorite dish.  The flavor was bursting from the bowl.  I did not want this dish to end it was so tasty.And for dessert:  One scoop of lemon gelato - refreshing and Coppa al Banana...this dessert was HUGE and luscious.  Be sure to save room for this guy."
Everything my group ordered was delicious here.  Sharing tapas is so much fun because you get to eat a little bit of everything!
"Quartino's food is usually a pretty solid four stars, but I have to take away a star for ambiance. This place is crowded, loud, and overall a terrible place to hold a conversation. I've been here several times for happy hour and also for dinner on the weekends with friends. The wait can get ridiculous- more than an hour during the week! I will say the food is great. Everything I've tried, from the pizza, calamari, scallops, and steak is delicious. The sangria is not to be missed either! Give it a try if you like shouting your conversation, standing shoulder to shoulder in a bar while waiting for your table, coupled with good Italian food."
"I showed up at Quartino on my friend's recommendation, and I was completely ravenous from my all-day trip in to Chicago. So I accordingly went a little nuts in my ordering, packing into one visit what I might have in three normal outings.Started with a small cheese plate from the Salumeria menu.  Each comes with accompanying fruit, giardiniera, and cucumbers.  Salty cheese, meet the sweet fruit or crisp cukes.  A perfect small cheese plate (which, if you're inclined, can be grown considerably by added meats and vegetables).  Unable to choose between gnocchi and a pizza, I took both. The gnocchi, fortunately, arrived first. A second hit: cooked completely yet remaining ever-so-slightly chewy, these were some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.My pizza was the Quattro Formaggi, and it came last, fortunately.  Because it was easiest to pack up and take back to my hotel after a valiant try at a second slice.  They're small pizzas, and neopolitan thin-crust, not the monstrous thick Chicago style.  The thinness is never better than when it is right out of the oven, but even so I didn't mind snacking on it for breakfast, either.The shop is Old Tyme elegant, tile floors and small tables.   In comparison to my native environs in socal, Chicago service always spoils me, and this is no exception.  Waiters back east are universally more attentive, and kitchens nearly always more efficient than they are here."
"I really like eating WITH my friends. Where we all dig into the same food and eat. I like the pass the dish style. The bottles of cold water, the modest wine list. I moved away from Chicago several years ago, so it was nice to find such a nice new place that didn't smell of franchise!Go for the decor, stay for the food. Service was not the best but we were never left waiting (too much)."
"I love that Quartino has the hustle and bustle of a popular restaurant as well as the comfort and coziness of sharing delicious dishes with your friends. It was packed like any other night, but the wait was well worth it. My three friends and I shared five dishes and were quite content afterwards.-calamari-perfectly battered and fried. left me wanting more.-mushroom risotto-my favorite dish of all. the cream wasn't too heavy and the flavor was just right!-sauteed spinach-simple and garlic-y. just the way i like my veggies. -cavatelli-good tomato taste. pasta was cooked just right.-roasted tuscan sausage-the sausage had good flavor, but there was a lot of sauce, which was a little too tomatoe-y for my taste.  my friend took it home to be cooked w/ pasta. An amazing pitcher of sangria sealed the deal."
This is a great place.  I didn't eat dinner here but just stopped in for a couple glasses of wine.  They have a nice selection of a wide variety of wines.  If you are up for some wine tasting I would definitely recommend Quartino.
"Thursday night dinner with friends I hadn't seen in ages...perfect environment for catching up while noshing on delicacies together.  Mushroom pizza was mouthwatering, Salumi Plate was varied (though not everything we thought it would be) and the octopus was sublime.  The only problem? We often couldn't hear one another, it was so loud.  And the menu, while broad, also was a bit overwhelming.  Choosing just a few dishes quickly was hard to do. When they came, they came all at once, which made for a too crowded table. As I gazed across the room, though, it seemed nobody else cared and were having an equally chatty, great time."
"Yes, 5 stars and let me tell you why...Dinner at Quartino is more than just scarfing some grub, it's an experience. In fact, I've never had dinner here in less than 2 hours and it had nothing to do with slow waitering --all your food comes out as it's ready so service is pretty darn fast.  The tiny tables that are too close together, cheap delicious wine and tiny plates meant to share scream leisurely European-style dinner.  I am a sucker for family style eating, of which Americans seem to be not so fond. I don't know what the reluctance is...maybe it's capitalism and that whole what's mine is delicious, but I suggest trying them with the marinara cause the red pepper sauce doesn't do anything for me. Get a 1/4 carafe of wine and you can try a few for half the price of other d-town eateries. Also, the white sangria...mmm. And of course the warm chocolate cake is the perfect way to end a fabulous meal.My suggestion, put on a loose ( but attractive, it is downtown after all) pair of pants, grab a couple friends and head there tonight."
"Top restaurant. Fresh food, great wine selection and good service. And who couldn't give 5 stars to a restaurant with old Italian cycling jerseys on the walls? We had Friday brunch here and got suitably drunk on strong cocktails and Prosecco at a good price."
"the portions were all made for sharing, however, asparagus risotto was not seasoned enough.  the garlic shrimp was tiny and salty.  the pizzas had no taste.  the only good thing was the charcuterie plate we devised."
"At the risk of getting slammed by Chicago denizens, I just don't know what the hype is here. With 4 stars and over 1400 Yelp reviews, I expected something fantastic but what I got was a mish mash of poorly crafted tapas that were mediocre at best in a loud, crowded, and poorly decorated space. I came with a friend on a Friday night so it was understandably crowded. We shared some duck prosciutto, scallops, gnocchi, and the Stefano pizza (white pizza /w basil & sausage). The prosciutto was nothing special and a bit pungent, scallops were under-seasoned, and the gnocchi was bland. The only decent eat was the pizza which was done with a nice crispy crust and topped with some delicious spicy sausage and basil. Even that, however, only stood out because of the mediocre backdrop. In short, Quartino tries to serve up refined Italian small plates in a happy hour setting but the high prices and disappointing food make it a total miss."
"We love Quartino's!!!  It is always our first stop when we come to Chicago.  Everything is great, GLUTEN FREE pasta!!!!  Yeah!!! Keep up the great job. The atmosphere is also great.  Get a carafe of the house wine"
"The food here is ""ok"" but the service here is really slow. I wish that a tapas place should serve food a little faster to keep it going but here it took way longer then normal to get the plates coming."
"I'll be perfectly honest- Italian food is not really my ""thing"".  When I think of my last meal on death row, it is nowhere near pasta, red sauce, ravioli, or anything else of Italian descent.  Pretty much the only thing I adore coming out of that strange boot-shaped country is wine.  That being said, Quartino almost converted me last Friday.A friend and I are on a tour de force to visit all the yummiest Chicago restaurants so when Quartino came up, we happily obliged.  We made an open table reservation for 9 pm on a Friday and were seated promptly (despite the restaurant being LITERALLY bursting at the seams - people were actually hanging outside in the rain because there wasn't even space to stand).  We got a nice little table and after having a semi-awkward and semi-funny exchange with our waiter got our waters and wine ordered.  This funny/awkward dynamic lasted the entire meal and was pretty much the only thing that detracted from the evening (also, the tiny table and severe lack of room to have a plate, water glass, and wine glass for 2 people).  After the waiter brought us a red carafe when we clearly enunciated chardonnay, he happily comped the whole thing then brought the right one over (nice!).  The food came next and I'll just highlight the best of the best - the mussels.  Seriously the biggest mussels I've ever seen.  Perfectly seasoned and soaked in some sort of white wine and caper concoction and basically a spectacular, mind-numbing, nothing-else-matters-except-these-mussels life altering experience.   Everything else we had was also quite delish but I will take some time to address the desserts.  We ordered the warm chocolate cake with vanilla gelato and the fruity gelato trio with limoncello.  Both were stupendous ends to the evening and it was at that point where I was happily astonished that absolutely nothing that went into my mouth that night tasted even remotely bad.I would definitely consider going back just for the mussels.  But knowing me I will probably go back for the mussels and at that point I might as well order dinner, and naturally what's dinner without dessert?  Yes, I have very little self control when it comes to yummy food."
"Yummy!  Shared a pizza, 3 dishes, and 1L of bellinis with two of my gfs and loved everything!  The bill came out to $30/pp after tip which was pricier than I thought, especially because I still had room for more food and drinks.  We ordered the caprese salad ($7.50), steamed clams ($10) that were too salty with a hint of spicyness, cavatelli pasta with ricotta ($9.50) that was just so-so, and lastly, duck prosciutto pizza ($12) which was my favorite part!  It barely tasted of duck but did taste like salted meat of some kind.  It was topped with fresh arugula and a little vinaigrette - so light and tasty!It's loud and crowded in here but very cozy.  Food comes out as it is cooked, and I felt like it was the perfect speed that allowed us to concentrate on one dish at a time.  Be prepared to wait even with a reservation on a Friday night."
"Ah Quartino, the place where ""wine is cheaper than water"". It's a perfect place to go when you're in the mood to feel European, drinking wine from carafes and selecting interesting sounding cheeses, olives, and cured meats from a separate a la carte menu (very fun to do.) I used to think their pizzas were the best thing ever, until I further explored the Chicago thin-crust Italian-style pizza scene and found some even more delicious options (see review for Ian's), but that said, their quattro stagione is still pretty unbeatable.The reason we keep going back to Quartino is because their risotto is hands-down THE best risotto we've been able to find in Chicago (the tuscan sausage and asparagus are to DIE for). In fact, we haven't tried many of their small plates or pastas because we can never get past the darned risotto.Summary: perfect Quartino date night = carafe of wine (great selection), 2 or 3 a la carte cheeses, pizza, risotto (no room for dessert, which is okay because their desserts aren't spectacular) and if we're lucky, space to sit outdoors in the summer and people watch/pretend we're in Italy as the wonderful post-risotto food coma sets in."
"The ONLY reason Quartino gets 4 stars instead of 3 is because of the terrific pizza.  I am from the east coast and have been dying to find a flat pizza, and Quartino's pizzas are terrific, and very reasonably priced.The wine selection is pretty awesome too, and I think the prices are extremely reasonable. The downside:  It's freaking noisy in there!  and the bar stools are SUPER uncomfortable and practically on top of each other.  But overall, an awesome stop!"
"One of the better tapas places I've been to in this city. We had so much food I don't even remember everything we ordered: tortellini, cheese plate, charcuterie, short ribs, another pasta, etc, etc, etc. Everything was amazing, right down to the restroom attendant (they deserve your dollar). A few things I didn't love: restrooms are way back on the second floor (I felt like I was walking through a private gathering to get to it). Server told us we ordered too much food (let us worry about what to do with the leftovers). And wine wasn't served in wine glasses, rather those small cup-like glasses. A proper wine glass is needed to experience the true 'essence' of a wine. (Oenophiles will understand and agree with me.) But, I would definitely go back. And order that tortellini and those short ribs again."
"Service was great, dining room extremely loud. Ordered a Margerita Pizza. Crust was good but the tomato sauce on the pizza was extremely lacking in seasoning. Very bland. My wife had the minestrone soup which she really liked. Also ordered a small plate of veal meatballs with sun dried tomatoes and raisins. Wasn't sure about that combo but worked, however the meatballs were under seasoned. Wanted to order a desert of Zeppole and our server was nice enough to let us know that an order had 8 and she could get us a half order of 4. Very nice. They were good, and since we couldn't decide on the dipping sauce (chocolate or honey) they brought them both. Extensive wine list with several sizes available on most everything. Would go back and give them another chance, maybe we just caught them on a bad seasoning night."
"I went here with a large group (over 20+ girls) and we had a really nice 5-course meal. The appetizers were amazing - especially the calamari - holy cow I've never liked seafood and this was positively great! I thought the pasta needed to be cooked longer, but others liked the ""al dente"" quality of it - so okay, to each their own. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some tasty Italian food - whether on a date or with a big party. They will absolutely cater to your needs."
"Came here on New Year's Eve and it was a great choice. The sangria was potent, cheap, and delicious (insert dirty joke here). The sausage risotto coated my insides with an awesomeness previously unknown (insert second dirty joke here). Even the tomato and mozzarella salad was fresh and refreshing (no dirty joke works here). It's very noisy so if you aren't that interested in hearing what your date has to say, even though I did just in case you're reading this, this is definitely the place for you. Highly recommend."
Real and excellent Italian food/pasta
"I really wanted to like this place.  There was so much potential when I walked in the door.Maybe it was the wedding reception taking place upstairs that made Quartino put extra tables in every possible nook and cranny downstairs.  It made what was a loud, energetic restaurant just impossibly loud and overcrowded.  We were sitting literally elbow to elbow with tables all around.  They were seating people in the entrance next to the doors.  I spent most of my dinner just waiting for a busboy or server to trip over me and spill something.  There were probably 2-3 close calls.You can say that anyone that puts up with that abuse gets what they deserve.  You could also argue that a restaurant willing to do that compels you to take your business elsewhere next time.  It bordered on utter contempt for the customer.   The wait staff was overstressed, and the hordes of tourists and bachelorette parties and iPhone-hypnotized woo girls cramming this restaurant just didn't get the Chicago Italian Experience that they probably were expecting from this place.  I have no idea how anybody at those large tables could enjoy themselves when they couldn't hear the person sitting across from them.  I was just trying to get some more bread or a drink refill without having to flag someone down.Some of the dishes were very good.  Most were plain.  There are better places in the city, but don't fear for these guys.  They have a great formula and location.  I'm just saying if you know better and actually venture into the city more than once a year or once a bridal party, you'll do better"
I love this restaurant I can just say foods and dessert are outstanding................
I love this place.  I've been there twice in the 5 months I've lived in Chicago.  The first time I went with my bf and the second time I had family in town. They all loved it.  The food is so good.  You must get the salumeria tasting.  The wine prices are super reasonable and I love that you can order a liter of wine.  The 4 of us polished that off no problem the day before NYE.  The tortellini are fab.  Everything I have had there has been delicious!  I totally recommend!
OMG!!!!This place rocks my boat every time we visit Chicago!!!!
"I went here with some school friends for an end-of-quarter celebration. We split into groups of four to share tapas... my group had veal meatballs, pancetta wrapped dates, tortellini, broccoli rabe, and pugliese pizza. Everything was wonderful except the broccoli rabe in my opinion... other people liked it but it had a strong flavor that I didn't care for. Everything else I tried (penne ala vodka, gnocchi) was good, too. Great food, great atmosphere... I will go back!!!"
"Quartinos is as good as it gets considering the price. Great atmosphere, great food. If you are thinking about it, dont.. just go"
"Quartino, you are the one true love of my life. Great atmosphere, friendly service and very reasonably priced. We try to come here whenever we're in Chicago--and it is worth it every time. Absolutely love the idea of Italian tapas, and everything here is a hit. Pros: arugula pizza, octupus, nutella panino, mushroom risotto, and the house wine--FAVORITECons: NONE!"
"I went here a while back and it was an interesting experience- sort of like eating in a restaurant that is Italian on the outside, a deli on the inside with Italian tapas....  The service was ok except they messed up my pizza order.  The pizza was nothing special except the veal meatballs on it,  My friend had some interesting mini plate options- olives, creamy gorgonzola spread and hard salami.  All of his options were good except the green olives.  Its a fun place to stop by with a few friends for a snack if you are in the area but not worth a special trip or if you are very hungry."
"The food was solid, but the service was slow.  I will go back to give them another chance some day."
"After my last review of Quartino, I must say, my opinion of the restaurant has changed 180 degrees. After the bad experience my friends and I had a few weeks ago, Tony Rice, who works at the restaurant, contacted me and asked me to give Quartino a second chance. I never expected a restaurant to be so attentive to customers' reviews. I must say, it was great that I did give Quartino another shot. The food was really great, the service was fantastic and the wine was divine. I highly recommend the broschetta, the garlic shrimp, the Italian sausage and the shrimp rissotto. The desserts were also amazing. You really must try either their hot chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream or the new apple fritters whose  sweet and tangy flavors make the perfect combination.I highly recommend it, well worth visiting. Thanks again Tony!!!"
"Love this place! I go here every time I have friends in town. Perfect for big groups, just remember to get a reservation. When I call only a few days in advance we end up with a really late reservation because of how busy it is - every night of the week. The wine is such a great deal so expect to buy some bottles and have a good time. The food is also extremely affordable, even on a student budget."
Absolutely love this place!  First stop when friends come in from out of town.  Great food. Great service.
"Yum, yum, yum! An Italian tapas place? Woo hoo!  I've been to Quartino numerous times, most recently last night.  I absolutely love this place. The food is consistently good and I love the tapas idea because you get to try so many different dishes.My favorite treat at Quartino is the duck proccuito.  I haven't been able to find it anywhere in the city -- it's amazing -- very rich and flavorful.  I wish I could order it all the time!"
"LOVE this place!  My husband and I go here all the time. It's perfect for any dinner night.  It's a bit noisy though, so you'll have to speak up!"
"This is a fun place to eat and inexpensive (and right in the Gold Coast area too). Of course, I had the polenta fries with the roasted red pepper puree; ordered two different pizzas and also the beef carpaccio.  Everything was good including the service.  I want to go back and try other items on their menu including the veal meatballs. The only thing that I found was a bit much were the profiteroles.  They serve you two huge ones and it is hard to cut with a fork. The traditional small size would be much better."
"I love the concept of Italian done tapas style.  My friend and I who lived in Italy, and take Italian food seriously, were very pleased.  I thought that the outdoor seating was lovely.My friend and I shared a delicious salad and two pasta dishes and it was just enough food.  The pasta tasted fresh and the sauces were very good.I think this is a great place to take a date!"
"Just tried Quartino with other two girls.This place rocks. We ordered small dishes to share. They all came cute and tasty. We also ordered 1/2 liter red wine. All of us satisfied with the choice and the price.The small dishes we chose are ranked from best to not-the-best by ME as follows:Roasted Tuscan SausageOrganic Veal Skirt SteakPenne Alla VODKAIt was a great night. For desert, Fantasia Coppa di Frutta is great, but the lemon sorbetti is a little bit sour for us. Well, the tiramisu is very nice. With desert, all of us got small free Limoncello,  and free pizza coupons from Seamus Boyle. When we came down and  saw people waiting in a long line outside, it was really guilty. We almost spent 3 hours there."
"QuartinoWhere the wine flows cheaply,And you share your plates. Where cheese and meat antipasti,A divine taste creates. Too loud and boisterous,For a romantical meal.Over fondue and nutella sandwiches,I can learn to deal."
"While on a business trip in Chicago, I stopped in at Quartino because  I thought it looked like a good place to eat and people watch. Unfortunately  it was LOUD.  incredibly loud.  I had to talk myself into staying because I had walked for several hours and was too hungry to try to find another place to eat.I ordered some wine and opened my phone to yelp online and escape the noise.I ordered the caprese salad and a penne pasta with a pink sauce.   A big part of the high volume was how packed the place was, I was hoping that meant that the food was able to overcome the sheer mind numbing noise that was starting to get really annoying. My caprese arrived.  After the first bite the sounds disappeared and all I could hear was angels singing.   I order caprese frequently because I love that combo of cheese, tomato and basil.  It was SOOOOO GOOOOD.The ingredients were so fresh and delicious!Then I waited to get my penne.  The angels receded and the noise started to intrude again.   My penne arrived and once again, I forgot the noise and ate in silent appreciation for good food.I was very satisfied with the meal but I need to get earplugs to go back."
"The space is inviting and airy so it leads you rather quickly to find comfort and joy, The staff smile and work diligently to accommodate your needs and desires.The wine is unique, some priced cheap and even better when poured freely. The food was good, but the few items I had at the Yelp event were not mind blowing. They were solid and edible, but nothing magic to OOh and AAh about, but still greatly appreciated as it was all free for the event and helped make for a fun evening.Yes, i will be back to spend my own money here, it seems worth it so far and hopefully my servers will help lead me to the land of OOOhs and AAAAhs;-)"
"OMG!!! is all I have to say. The food was out of this world. Our server Ty was GREAT! He even posed for pictures with us. We had the Salumeria tasting, Zeppole, bone marrow, Copa al Banana, Nutella Panino, Dates wrapped in Pancetta, Polenta fries, Roasted bone marrow and pork belly. Everything was AMAZING!!! I can now see why my boyfriend loves this place."
really good price for the quality/taste of foodatmospherefriendly servicegreat winesolid 8/10
"I had been dying to try Quartino for a while and finally this weekend, I got to go.  I went with a big group of people, and only one of us had been there before.  We made reservations, which I would highly recommend, for any size group if you are going on a weekend.  We got a table on the first floor, and I have to warn everyone on hot summer nights, this place is really stuffy.  The second floor was much cooler.  This was a wonderful place to visit with a big group.  The food was excellent, except we all decided that is not the best place for seafood dishes.  But we all really enjoyed sharing each other's dishes.  And this was the perfect spot to be for the bar-hopping we did the rest of the evening!  Perfect location for FUN.  Quartino is a great place to get your Saturday night going in style!"
"I went here with a group of 8 to celebrate a friend's birthday.  It was so much fun, and I'd highly recommend it for a group.We got several dishes to share (I don't remember what), but none of them were bad or even mediocre.  They were all delicous!  We got a few desserts, 2 bottles of wine, and the bill was less than $20 a person.  I don't even know how that was possible with the alcohol - but hey - great!Awesome place for dates, groups, or anything.  It is small plates, so get a few and pass them around!  I'm definitely going back soon!"
"For what they do, the food is very good. The veal meatballs are delish, the veggie pizza fresh and only lightly coated with oil as it should be, the duck prosciutto was definitely something I could snack on for a while. Dates with pancetta were, just dates wrapped with pancetta, great combo but similar everywhere. Polenta fries could have been cut smaller like actual  fries to accentuate the crispy batter. Bone marrow was underwhelming, nothing special - I'll try God's butter again, Anthony Bourdain."
"Went here on a Thursday night with a large group (10). It was PACKED both upstairs and down, but they were able to accommodate us (we had a reservation). The ambiance is great- we sat at a long table with a HUGE candleabra in the center, which unfortunately dripped wax all over the table (still gorgeous, though).We shared a wide variety of things- veggie pizza; gorgonzola pear walnut pizza; salmon, scallops; caprese salad; antipasti (olives, cheeses); VINO; penne a la vodka; mushroom risotto... Everything was absolutely delicious. It's a 'small plate' concept, but the plates are small only by Chicago standards- you really get plenty of food for not too much money.Service was fantastic- very attentive despite how busy it was. Food comes out quickly- as soon as it's ready- and the family-style concept means that there's always something to eat. Highly recommended."
their food never really disappoints. solid 3-4 stars. it is packed and loud in there though. good for a quick casual dinner. good wine with a good price.
Food was solid...wine was tasty...good atmosphere...done and done
"Wanted try something fun when we met my brother-in-law and his family for dinner (they were visiting from MI).  This place succeeded and the food was excellent. Everything served Tapas style(small plates designed fir tasting and sharing). Had the Italian fondue, gnocchi, mushroom risotto, and eggplant Parmesan to mention a few. Everything was delicious and way beyond typical Italian fare. The only thing we thought was ordinary and did not excite us was the calamari. Personally, the pizza was not exciting either but then I am a Chicago style guy.  The place is quite noisy so great for group fun but not a place if you are looking for a quient dinner. We will definitely go back when we are in the city."
"4+ stars.  We pretty much enjoyed everything except the fried mozzerella sticks, which were a little heavy.  Veggie dishes were good.  Festive atmosphere, bordering on noisy, but hard to criticize them for their success.  Our reservation was messed up but they seated us (party of 5) quickly anyway, which was nice of them.  We ordered 2 small plates per person which was too much.  Liked the no-pressure wine options, which was the same price per liter no matter how much you ordered."
"Italian tapas... WOOHOO!!I absolutely love Italian and this restaurant definitely lived up to all my expectations.  I actually set up a double-date at Quartino based on a Yelp! referral.  None of us had been here before, but will definitely come back again.  All of the food is great (I highly suggest the cheese fondue with apples - YUM) and the ""Stefano"" pizza.  The food came out very quickly, which was a surprise because the restaurant was so crowded.There are so many things I wish I could have tried on the menu... pretty much everything sounded great.  I would definitely suggest going with a group -- everything is fairly cheap and your bill will be much less than you're expecting!!"
"I have been to Quartion's a handful of times, for both lunch and dinner during the week. The place is not too crowded for lunch, but packed for dinner. During the week we never needed made reservations for dinner and were still seated quickly. I recommend sitting outside when the weather is nice, the inside is a little cramped and it's not as loud outside, actually kind of peaceful on a week night.The food is great! and oh the wine! some of my faves are the veal meatball slider, any pizza, gnocchi, eggplant Parmesan, polenta fries, and some other pasta I can remember, just remember it was good. Lots of great wine to try too. I have also had consistent good service, the waiters are always nice, helpful and knowledgeable."
"What a wonderful restaurant. Let's start off with the only negative part - our food, at first, was delivered way too fast. Our wine bottle had barely hit the table when three of our five ""small plates"" showed up at the same time.  Seriously, we were seated and nearly completely fed within 15 minutes - NOT the kind of pacing we expect at a nice place.Luckily, the food was really tasty and when the waiter realized our table was full, he came up and said that he would slow down the pace.  After that, he did a great job firing the plates and desserts.I would totally go back to Quartino. In fact, if I lived in Chicago, it would likely be on the short-list of places I'd visit several times per month.Order the polenta fries. Tasty and unusual!"
I'm a big fan and have enjoyed many diners here. For the location and selection it's actually pretty cheap. The servers have always been nice and somehow I always get a table fairly quikcly (they must be good and turning them over). I recommend the octopus. This is a great spot for tourists and locals alike.
"A friend of mine from High School is the lead in a Broadway play that is running here in Chicago so we took her out to Quartino to celebrate after the show. We had a great time, the caprese as always is fantastic and the wine is tasty and inexpensive. There was some confusion as to who our server was but once it was settled the service was great. There was only one strange incident to report....being that her show got over well after 10:00pm we didn't start eating until about 10:30, as we were catching up on old times and drinking our wine, my husband noticed a drunken couple sitting across from one another near the kitchen who were giving each other foot massages THEN the woman got up and sat in the man's lap and started FULL ON MAKING OUT....we were staring and practically yelling at them to get a room, without drawing to much attention to our dinning companion(who did not want to end up in a fight or on the news due to her employment). NONE OF THE SERVERS DID ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. Finally we flagged one waitress over and complained and then she ""THANKED US"" for complaining b/c unless we did she could not saying anything to them??!!?!?!? WHAT??? So strange! Either way it was an entertaining meal to say the least!"
"Went for wine and some apps and had totally forgot that I had been here before until I saw the bathroom upstairs. Not that it is a memorable bathroom or that I had a memorable experience there, just something with the black and white tiles. Sat in the bar area this time. Both the bar and restaurant we not overly busy on a Monday night. The tomato soup was good - more of a broth than creamy. The caprese salad was mediocre but I half expected that since it's off-season for really good tomatoes. I like the 1/4 carafes. We were able to try many (cough cough) different wines this way. Some were good, others just OK. Don't try the Primitovo, that one was bad. The Prosecco was enjoyable if you're in to bubbles. Not half price bottle night here like a lot of other places nearby have on Monday nights. Just two of us in the bar area, not crowded, and it was impossible at times to get the waitress' attention. It was like she deliberately was not looking at us. So needless to say, service was slow."
"came here on a thursday evening w/a friend when her brother was in town...and i have to say, quartino is pretty pretty good. it was packed and we were seated right away, which i definitey appreciated...because the waiting area is pretty cramped. im a big fan of tapas as a rule because im so indecisive, so this was a great answer to my personal problem. we started off w/sangria that was on special (which was definitely pretty darn good) and hten moved on to tapas. since none of us had ever been there before, we asked our server for advice on what to menu. he was incredibly helpful and we each ended up picking 2 and sharing. everything we tried was very tasty, and i'd imagine the things we didnt try are as well, but like all tapas this place can get pricy quickly. we also ordered a caprese salad to share...but our server forgot it...oops.overall quartino gets 4 stars because i did enjoy the food and our experience as a whole...but we did have to wait quite a while for service once seated and for our meal, not to mention our forgotten salad. also, though i realize they were pretty close to maximum capacity, i felt rushed to get out and like we didnt really get to enjoy our meal properly."
"I really like this place.Italian food represents everything that good cooking should be: fresh approachable food cooked with heart. And Italian restaurants represent everything that eating out should be: fun and casual dining delivered by a caring and authentic staff.Quartino gets it. They've really done a superb job of eliminating the excessive fussiness that I've come to loathe when eating out. Quartino knows that its food isn't the greatest. The service isn't the most refined. The restaurant doesn't care because it's not trying to be something it's not. This is why  Quartino is always packed. It's also why the dining room and bar are always alive with good energy. Quartino's menu is designed for family style eating. The dishes are intended for sharing. So it's fun to order several dishes and sample bites here and there. The prices are very affordable. Half of the menu prices are below $10. Several dishes hover in the $11-12 range. The wait staff is very good about recommending dishes on the menu. The food is always consistent. I recommend any of the thin crust brick oven pizzas which arrive on a metal platter steaming hot. The pasta dishes are solid. The tortellini with peas and prosciutto is yummy. Order a carafe of the house red wine. It's a steal. On weekends, it's almost impossible to get a table. Just grab a table in the bar area. Order food at your own pace and savor the wine. Quartino is one of those rare restaurants that manages to create ""magic"" in their dining room---the collective fun and happiness of a couple hundred diners brought together by good food, wine,and service at reasonable prices."
"The more I think about it, this place deserves 5 stars. This was my first Yelp review ever so I was a little stingy on the stars. 5 stars fo sho."
"Went for my bachelorette party. They handled our party of 9 on a busy Saturday night. Service = good. Food = awesome. Price = right.Went for a nice outdoor lunch with coworkers. For a pizza and salad -- really, really good pizza and salad -- $8.25 per person. I can drop that at Panera for lunch and not be nearly as satisfied."
"desserts, specifically the chocolate molten cake thing was amazing"
"Food is good, fun place long waits sometimes but once your seated food is fast.  Great wine"
"The food is great. I don't eat a lot of stuff (dietary restrictions and choices) but they've got great things for me. Also, their food is top quality, comes out fast, and it's easy to get additional things added if you need to add something to the order.The service has always been great too. The servers have been friendly, worked well with the group at the table, and have given us great service.The atmosphere is a lot of fun. You can dress up or wear jeans, people do both. There's a bar area, a dining area, and then an upstairs/overflow area. The bathrooms have attendants (really sweet ladies that I've seen) and the decor is really cool.I would not suggest coming here with children or if you need to have a conversation as it gets REALLY loud during dinner. Though maybe that's a good time to bring kids so they don't have to be quiet. :)"
"I was really disappointed when we went to Quartino's recently. This place came recommended by a friend and had good Yelp reviews, but I just don't get the appeal. Don't get me wrong, the food is quite good and the prices are reasonable. We really enjoy Tapas style dining, so I figured this place was a no-brainer. However, the place was so cramped and noisy, no one could enjoy their meal. To start off, we had a reservation for a party of six and they seated us at a table that could maybe fit four people max. Plus the noise level in the place was so high you couldn't hear what the person next to you was saying. Now, I don't mind an 'active' atmosphere in a restaurant for I think it helps with the overall energy level and enjoyment of the meal, but this was to a point of discomfort. I would have really enjoyed this place if we were actually given the opportunity to enjoy our meal. Saw this. Did that. Bought the t-shirt. Moving on..."
"Went here after St. Patty's at Streeters with two friends around 8:00 and we lucked into a table right by the bar. First of all this place is HUGE and even has a second level so I can't imagine the wait ever being bad. We ordered the calamari, the Stefano pizza, beef short ribs, and something I'm probably forgetting due to the fact that this was our post St. Patty's dinner. Everything was really good, especially the pizza, and with a bottle of Chianti (just okay) the total for three of us was only $79. I'll definitely be back."
"I have never written a review before but I feel that this restaurant deserves a thumbs up.Six of us had dinner last nightIt was absolutely delicious!  We ate everything : veal meatballs, scallops, pasta, palenta sticks and much, much moreThere was not one thing that was just fair--everything was wonderfulThe place was packed but no one rushed usTo top it all off, it was very reasonableI would say, don't walk-- run for a great meal"
"I have never written a review but I feel the need to after experiencing Quartino's.  I booked a private, special event there last Saturday night for 50 people, upstairs.  I requested a buffet appetizer type party.  Not as expensive as some other venues.  My guests were so happy with all of it.  Food was delicious, especially the veal meatballs.  The staff was extremely helpful and so nice.  It was a perfect night.  Roberto was the best!  Thank you Quartino's!"
I went with two friends to Quartino for lunch on a Monday.  We ate outside where the spacing was comfortable.  We ordered the fondue appetizer with some apples.  The apples were a little brown but still very much edible.  The cheese and bread that came with it were both fantastic.When you order your entrees they come out as they are completed.  My Penne alla Vodka appeared first and one of the other entrees didn't make it to the table until I had already finished my plate.  In a casual setting with good company this won't be a problem but I wouldn't recommend it for a business lunch.Anyway the food quality was good.  Penne alla Vodka is hard to mess up so my expectations were met.  I enjoyed the sausage pizza.  For drinks we ordered both the red and white sangria.  I recommend the white but both were good.  The prices were average and the service was excellent.
"When I made the reservation, I thought I was making it for Osteria via Stato, just across the street.  So imagine my surprise when I realized, as I walked up, that I had made a mistake.""Oh well,"" I thought. ""I've never been here, so cool.""I went with my oldest guy friend's wife who was in town for the night.  Holy loudness, Batman.  We waited for 15 minutes until our table was ready & barely made out the host announcing over the speaker, ""C-----, Party of 2.""  It was all mumbles.  I still don't even know how I made it out.We were seated at what I only describe as the world's smallest table for two.  We were shuffling our plates & glasses around in order to figure out how to best utilize the limited space.  It was also slanted (or maybe the floor was) --- the olive oil started spilling out of the plate (y'know, to dip the bread).  Also, we had to make sure that we put tall items or liquid items against the wall because otherwise, we were in very real danger of having everything tip over onto us when people (a lot who were very drunk) walked past our table.Since it was so very loud, I couldn't hear half of what our waiter told us when we got there.  Something about meat & cheese sampler or, I dunno.  Something about bringing out small plates to share (we really didn't want small plates -I'm a vegetarian & she wanted seafood-, but since we were already there, we just ordered what we wanted & then didn't share).  Our waiter really didn't seem interested in knowing what we wanted, just in spitting out whatever his script said.Personally, I felt pressured to order super-quickly.  He just stood around as we tried to decide on a wine, while not making any recommendations on type, just standing there.  Then, when we decided on a bottle, he practically forced us to only take a half-bottle (liter? something about liters like we're gonna know what a liter equals).The two of us are about the friendliest customers you could ever ask for as a server, but he was just going through the motions, unfortunately.  When we ordered our food, he commented, ""Yeah, you may have enough to share.  Might get stuffed, might not.""  What does that even mean, anyways?Anyways, we got our food in piecemail, which, since it was small plates didn't surprise me, but since we weren't really sharing (not knowing it was small plates when I reserved), it wasn't so great.The portabella bruschetta was tasty, but nearly impossible to eat.  The ingredients were really huge & fell off the bread all over the place (since the table was so small, really, all over the place).  The broccoli rabe was ok, but man, I got a bite that was allllll black pepper.  The polenta fries were -eh- & the roasted red pepper sauce that with with them was less than eh.She ordered the linguini with clams, which I didn't try (she didn't comment on if she liked it or not).  I wanted to order the mushroom risotto, but it's made with pork stock (ew), so nope.  In fact, why is it that when a lot of restaurants have what would otherwise be vegetarian options, they have to use animal stock, nullifying the veggie option?  Annoying!  Anyways, instead, I ordered the penne alla vodka, which was the best part of the meal.For dessert, our waiter finally stepped up & recommended the chocolate cake with ice cream, which we ordered, although any of the options sounded tasty.  We got it & it was crazy rich, but good, nonetheless.  We were unable to finish it, however.When we were still eating our dessert, we were given the bill.  Even though we were assured that there was no hurry, our waiter hovered within feet of our table for the next few minutes, just staring at the tab.  The upside was that our water glasses were refilled about a dozen times between placing the dessert on our table & when we did leave.Wow.  This is long.  Oh well.  I probably won't be back, is the bottom line.PS:  If I were the owner/manager, I'd take a look at these reviews & change a few things.  Like how freakin' loud it is.  I don't agree with a fellow Yelper's assertion that restaurants should be noisy & fun all the time & that the only reason a person would go out to dinner would be to eavesdrop on crazy conversations.  What about, oh, I dunno, the FOOD?  Tasting flavors you'd never try at home?  Or having a quiet, romantic meal with a new guy?  Or getting together with an old friend to catch up while they're in town?  Just like there are different bars (cozy, loud, full of energy, precocious), there are different restaurants.  & just because someone likes restaurants where you apparently have to scream at the person you're practically sitting atop in order to be heard doesn't mean the rest of us do or that we're dowdy or idiots because of it."
"Waiter don't remember the order and not willing to split the order for us. The food is bad. We ordered several different dishes and none is extra good. Totally overrated. The cups are stained and we have to change it too. Oh, wifi is password protected too."
"I went here on a Thursday evening and it wasn't busy at all. The decor was ok but I was expecting it to be a little more upscale. Still, it was comfortable. We started off with the meat, cheese and olive platter. I'm not a big fan of smoked or dried meats but the cheese was good and so were the green olives. They give you all sorts of weird garnishes which none of us really liked. We also all tried the eggplant parm which I loved. It was covered in a ton of cheese which I adore but isn't for everyone. The penne alla vodka was good too. That seemed to be the group favorite. We also had the margarita pizza which was good but not what I was expecting. I thought there would be lots of fresh mozzarella melted on it. Instead it was a blend of different cheeses. Still tasty and was covered in basil which again, I love but some people probably won't. I'd probably go back but probably with a group larger than 3 and I wouldn't get the meat, cheese and olive plate."
I just attended a Bachelorette party here and it couldn't have gone better. We had a private dining room off the main room upstairs which I highly recommend since it was much quieter. We worked out a package with unlimited drinks and the food served family style. Everything was delicious and my friends are still talking about the penne with vodka sauce and the beef filets. If you have a large group I recommend working out a package in the private room!
"I know there are amazing restaurants in the city, especially out of the touristy area of town, but Quartino is by far one of my favorite places.  The food, selection and prices are perfect, especially when eating out with a big group.  They have an awesome, affordable wine list.  It's loud, but that makes it more fun."
love.what more can I say?tapas. amazing food. great price. wine is cheaper than water. perfect service.go! =)order this trip:octopusshrimphalf order pastaskirt steakveal meatball sliderbottle of wine
"A pretty affordable and nice place to visit downtown.Came here with my boyfriend's family when they were in town. $16 carafes of the house red wine was amazing. We drank up some pretty decent wine on the cheap.We got there about 10 minutes before our reservation and had to wait about 30 minutes in the crowded, LOUD lobby which was a bit of a pain in the butt. It was raining outside so everyone was slammed in the tiny hostess area together. Luckily, that was the only bad part of the experience!We sat upstairs, so it was noisy, but not incredibly loud like many people have said. If you're eating with a soft-talker, maybe ask to be seated upstairs?I loved the eclectic ambiance and lighted candleabras. The service was great, though he did forget one of our orders (the polenta fries, doh!), but we were full enough and didn't need them.We shared a bunch of the small plates and a pizza. The sausage pizza we ordered was seriously the best pizza of my life. I don't know if it was the quality of the ingredients or what, but I could have eaten the entire thing by myself. Flavor country!We all tried the veal meatball sliders as well which were tasty and the men's favorite part of the meal. On the good reco's I'd seen on yelp, I ordered the asparagus risotto to share and was pretty disappointed. My boyfriend's dad reached for the salt immediately. It was everyone's least favorite.We ordered a bunch of antipasti which came out beautifully before the meal with the many sauces, toppers, etc. explained nicely by our server. The caprese salad was good and the tomatoes were really flavorful even though they were definitely out of season. The seared tuna small plate we had was delicious and had quite a bit of tuna which was surprising.Since we didn't eat TOO much for dinner, we shared the zeppole (the doughnuts with honey and chocolate which were good, but very airy and not like most doughnuts. They were better with the honey than the chocolate because they were so delicate), the nutella panini (which I loved because it had nutella, but was basically two pieces of bread smeared with nutella and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Very messy to eat, though), the coppa banana (YUMMY caramelized bananas with gelato, biscotti and whatever else they could fit into that big martini glass) and the gran coppa quartino (another big martini class of gelato, hazlenuts and berries).The entire meal for 5 with wine was $130. I know! I will definitely be back."
"This place is fantastic.  Excellent friendly service from knowledgeable waitstaff, delicious food that is reasonably priced and house wine that is to die for!  Also i noticed it makes gluten free pasta - so I went for a repeat visit with my godmother who has a wheat allergy and she said it was the best she's ever had (I ventured a taste and although I noted the lack of wheat starch I will say it was quaffable compared to others I have tried off her plate).  Then I went back late night after a happy hour.  When i like something i guess i turn into a repeat customer pretty quickly - went here three times in the first two months I lived downtown.  Quartino, however, is a place that should be on everyone's short list of restaurants to try while they are in the area."
"First time in Chicago ever. Landed at the airport at 10:30pm. Was in hotel room by 11:30pm. Starving.....what to do? How lucky I felt to have done some research and was already planning to conquer my late night hunger with a gem like Quartino. Had the ""ear"" shaped pasta and a bottle of red wine ""tepernillo (sp?)"" and the veggie pizza. We sat at the bar and the bartender was honest, easy to get along with, let us take our time to order, and had good suggestions. We were also lucky enough to watch some serious game spitting going on at the end of the bar. Poor guy :( I would eat her at least once a week if I lived in the city, and based on the amount of people who picked up pizza while we were there, I am not the only one. I think, had I had the opportunity to have a regular sit down dinner instead of sitting at the bar, there is a definite possibility for five stars."
"One of my favorite spots in the city!Quartino has fabulous wines at great prices, delicious pizza and small dishes, and indulgent desserts. Fun for a night out or a late-night stop, whether with family, a date, or girls' night out. If you're lucky, there may also be celeb appearances. Kitchen is open pretty late. Cocktails are delicious, but seem somewhat unnecessary given the size of the wine list. I highly recommend the homemade Limoncello - perfect for topping off a great meal. Service is great, bartenders are fun, food is delicious, wine is abundant - what more could you ask for?!"
"I don't really understand what the hype is with this place. They may have some great wine although we never got along that far in our dinner to actually enjoy. My wife thought this would be a great place after she read the reviews on Yelp, and I was all for it because I work around the area and walk by this place almost every single day.First of all, this is a small cramped place. There were two of us on a Friday night (busy night, I know), and we got seated next to a pole, and barely had any room to put anything down. When they came with appetizers, we were eating with our shoulders hunched in because if you tried to relax, you'd hit one of the waiters or customers walking through.We only got so far as appetizers. I don't remember what we got, something that looked like fat french fries. Flavorless. Sucky. We paid our bill, got up, and finished dinner at the Chilli's across the street."
"Quartino is the best restaurant in Chicago!  The best of the best.  We love the atmosphere, the food, the location and the service.  We got the gnocchi, the penne in vodka sauce, the short ribs, the calamari, and the italian donuts.  We DEFINITELY would come again!"
"Absolutely wonderful. If you are any where near this restaurant, do yourself a favor and go in. You will love it."
"Quartino has delicious pastas and tapas. There's definitely something for everyone here, even if you're not into the small plates type thing (because you can easily just get an entree for yourself... I recommend the gnocchi.. with arugula pesto... so yummy). I will say that the Zeppole (italian doughnuts, we got it with dark chocolate) didn't blow me away, but at $5 I'm not really complaining. The biggest issue I have with this place is it's super noisy, and I think it's mostly because of the acoustics of the room, not because of any loud music or anything. It'd be so much more pleasant if you didn't hear everyone's conversations simultaneously."
"Great outdoor seating, which was a great place to have a drink.  Extensive wine list and great service!  I didn't care for the first glass of wine I ordered and they quickly replaced it with something else without a fuss!"
"If I had to describe Quartino to someone who'd never been there before, I would describe it as the holy union of tapas and Italian food.  As it happens, I've used this description a lot the last 24 hours since I can't stop yapping about the experience I had at Quartino and how much I loved it!I was surfing this site looking for someplace fun and interesting to go for my birthday dinner with my parents, and I had typed in ""tapas"" and this place popped up.  I gave the menu a look...let's just say they had me at ""salumeria"".  (I will Englishify that; salumeria  = customized meat, cheese, and olive plates.) So yesterday at 3:30, I came in for my reservation with the boyfriend and the parents looking forward to eating some meat and a delicious meal, and Quartino did not disappoint in the slightest.  It's a cute little place with some of that stone-wall-Tuscan-style decor, a really swanky looking bar, and an upstairs I didn't see at all.  We sat in the main dining room, and I did not notice any problems with noise, but we also went at an off-peak time.  The four of us consumed the following:       *Salumeria selection of sopresetta, prosciutto di parma, asiago cheese, and the selection of olives.       *White bean garlic dip       *Veal meatball sliders       * Fusilli with red sauce, buffalo mozeralla, and olives       *The ""Stefano"" pizza (mozeralla, parmesean, basil and rosemary, and spicy italian sausage)       *Dark chocolate fondue with biscotti, bananas, and strawberries       * A carafe of malbec, lemoncello martini, and after dinner liquors (limoncello, orangecello, and frangelico)That whole big meal was like an ongoing song of ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MEEEE!!!!""  Seriously, it was the gift that kept on giving.  The food just keeps coming and coming. The meat and cheese is really fresh; they make it themselves in-house, that fusilli is to die for and goes really well with the malbec we were drinking by the carafe, the pizza was thin and crispy with a real punch from the sausage.  I cannot put into words how much I loved the fondue - the biscotti we got to dip in the chocolate was the best I've ever come across! We got a nice tableside visit from Chef John Coletta too, who gave us a ltitle glimpse into the inner workings of Quartino; that's how I found out about all the salamis, meats, and cheeses being made in-house and the fact that they have three working kitchens. Very cool.I'd go back in a heartbeat and if sharing a well-savored dining experience with others has ANY appeal to you whatsoever, you should too."
"This was my favorite restaurant in Chicago when I lived there. They have Italian tapas, it's a nice bistro atmosphere, and all the food is so good. I never ordered anything I didn't like; and it's good for a date as well as a group dinner. I always got the profiteroles for dessert, so I highly recommend those. The pizza is also a nice change from all the deep dish Chicago style pizza places in the neighborhood."
"Wow, 440 review of this place? Holy cheese balls!I went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was pretty packed! I'd describe the atmosphere as boisterous. The people were all enjoying themselves, so it was fairly loud. The tables are also packed in pretty close together. It's like everyone there is one big happy family! I found the restaurant to be clean and nicely decorated.We had to wait awhile for our waiter, twice. When he showed up he was nice enough though. We actually had two waiters, one of whom appeared for the first time halfway through the meal. He seemed nice as well. It didn't take long to get the food. Water glasses were refilled regularly, which is good. Running out of water is a major pet peeve of mine.They have a good selection of wines, and many of them are available in a variety of sizes: 1/4, 1/2 and full carafe and bottle. There are also a few available by the glass. Prices seem decent to me, but I'm far from a wine expert.The food, with one exception, was excellent. In case you haven't read any of the other 440+ reviews of this place yet, it's basically small-plate Italian. It's like an Italian tapas restaurant. Actually, I think most of the portions are larger than what you get at at a true tapas restaurant. For two of us we ordered a caprese salad, a pizza, a pasta and a risotto and we had too much food. We would have been fine with 3 dishes. The pasta (orchiette or something...I'm too lazy to look it up..it's the ""ear shaped stuff"". I know nothing says ""tasty"" like munching on some ears) was delicious, as was the Popeye pizza, which was loaded with baby spinach. I left feeling stronger then ever, and ready to whip some Bluto ass! The caprese was good, though not the best I've had. The mushroom risotto was a bit of a disappointment. It was kind of just a big brown goopy mass.  . . you could hardly tell there was any risotto in it. We didn't have room for dessert, so I can't speak to that.Also the manager (didn't catch his name) was very nice and helpful. We had some payment related confusion, and he was totally cool about it."
"Decent italian food for a reasonable price in Streeterville.If you're lucky, the food can actually be really good ... it just seems pretty hit or miss.Good wine. Try the Est! Est! Est!And for dessert the Coppa al Banana is amazing. I rarely order desserts, but I always make an exception for this one.This restaurant is really loud, so not the best choice if you want to have quiet night with good conversation. Maybe if you sit upstairs, it may be a bit easier to hear. This is good for groups, we took a party of about 15-20 ... great way to try out a lot of their dishes by sharing. Food came out as it was ready.  Be careful with groups though, they won't seat you until everyone is there. So if you have a straggler or someone planning to arrive an hour late, be aware and see if you can squeeze them in at your table later."
"I love the concept of Italian style tapas, the dishes are great, but it's always packed and so even with a reservation we've had to wait at times.  Not the place to go if you're looking for a quiet dinner... so basically don't make this a first date place. Try the meatballs and the polenta fries... probably my two favorite small dishes. The pizzas are all great."
"One of my all-time favorite Chicago spots for pretty much anything - great date spot, group gathering, bachelorette or birthday celebration. It gets loud and there can be a wait. Just know your audience and you'll be fine.Any pizza is to die for as is the asparagus risotto (life-changing). I also love that wine is extremely inexpensive and service is quick. I will be back time & time again!"
"Meh, just meh.  Nothing here was over the top or unique for me.  The pizza was OK, the pasta was OK and the veal meatballs were OK.  Maybe was expecting too much?  Maybe small plates and Italian food is too much of an oxymoron?   Not sure.I was here with a group and it came highly recommended.  We sampled numerous items.  How could I leave an Italian place and still be hungry?  In addition, their wait staff (for a not-super-crowed Wednesday night) was not attentive, and my martini was pitiful."
"So imagine this: You land in chicago, you're hungry, its windy and cold as hell.  What do we want to eat?  Deep dish pizza!  Ok lets go!!!  As it turns out everyone and their mom wants to eat deep dish pizza in chicago.  Forget it...lets find somewhere else to eat.Thats what happened to me and my gf during our chicago trip last march.  After refusing to wait in line for hours to eat ""fat peoples pizza"", we decided to look up a place to eat on our iphones and we ended up at Quartino.  This place is an italian tapas style restaurant with a wide variety of dishes.  I dont remember off the top what we ordered, but one dish that stood out was their Gnocchi.  It was rich and flavorful with little bites of asparagus mixed in with the sauce.  I washed everything down with a Perroni and I was good to go.  I had a great time there and an awesome meal.  Im def stopping by the next time im in the Chi."
"Definitivamente es un buen lugar para pasarla bien y compartir platos y comida, la variedad de vinos a precios rasonables es buena.La Sangria excelente y es un lugar para pasarla bien con amistades , o con la persona amada! No es bueno para ninos especialmente en la noche, por que este lugar si que se llena! So far so good, I love the Sangria and pizza , it's not expensive as the other downtown places. This place it's to share food, moments, wine, and a good time!Try  profiteroles for dessert!"
"I don't know what's taken me so long to review this place, as it's one of my favorites. This place has such a great atmosphere, it always feels like everyone is excited to be there, staff included. The food is great, as is the wine list. I've been here for many bday's (including my own), and it's always crowded with a very lively bunch of diverse people. My advice? If youre headed there for drinks and a few apps with friends, head to the bar. It's excellent people watching and quick service. If you want the sit down experience, then make a reservation, or be prepared to wait!"
"I truly have a love-hate relationship with Quartino's. I recommend it to everyone because overall the positives outweigh the negatives. There are times when I'll visit several times within a month, then those pesky negatives creep in and I don't visit for several months at a time.Love - the charm of the restaurant's dining area, you really do feel like you're at a local trattoria in ItalyHate-that you can be on top of your neighbors eating (lucky you can't hear their conversations but the room is typically very loud!)Love-the eggplant Parmesan, the orrchiette with sausage, spinach salad, cured olives and meats,  the polenta fries and of course the zeppole (Italian donuts) with honey or chocolate dipping sauces.Hate-that food is brought out when its ready and sometimes they'll forget that you still have something coming (long story short - this happened when my family of 12 dined there this summer and our waiter never brought an entree that was ordered...we were still waiting for it when our dessert arrived! to be fair the manager was very apologetic)Love - the outdoor dining in the summer, great people watching!Hate-reservations aren't accepted for the outdoor seatingLove - the funky bathrooms, that mirror cracks me up and fools me every timeHate - that they have a bathroom attendant and that you have to go upstairs to use the facilitiesAgain I will state that Quartino's positives outweigh the negatives. This can be a tough place to carry on an intimate conversation just because noise does carry here, but I will say that its a great place for a group of 4 to come and share some plates."
This is by far my favorite place to eat in all of Chicago.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  It's outstanding!The octopus is the best I've ever had and I haven't been anywhere else in the USA (or Italy for that matter) that can match it.
Celebrated my birthday there last night in the realto room. The service by Roberto was great! They totally took care of us. It's a perfect way to celebrate in that private room. Food and drinks were delicious!
"The words ""fresh"" and ""fun"" are really all you need to know about Quartino.  My wife and I went there yesterday to celebrate our anniversary.  No, it is not a place to go for a quiet/intimate dinner for two.  Have you ever eaten in an Italian's home?  It is a noisy and boisterous affair, especially when the wine is flowing as freely as it is here!  The place is named after the mini-carafes that you may opt to purchase your wine in, giving you the ability to sample a wide variety of wines.  As great as that is, and after many visits here, we have yet to discover a bad wine on their list, do NOT limit yourself to wine.  Did I mention they make their own limoncello?  They also make their own mozzarella.  In fact, I bet they have their own herb garden around somewhere as well.  The basil and mint sprigs seemed like they were fresh picked!  Don't count on any frozen pastas either,  this is probably the freshest food you can find.This is what put us into our food comas yesterday:  Caprese salad (which was on the small side, but good for a taste of the mozzarella and basil), Veal Meatballs, Tortellini with Prosciutto,  Pizza with Pear, Walnuts, and Gorgonzola, and the Lemon Pannini to go with the above mentioned limoncello.Now, we were branching out yesterday, if you are making your visit there, you MUST have some antipasto!  Get the sampler so you get to order sushi-style (a card and pencil to check off what you want).   Also, pizza is probably not a great idea for only two people (too filling, variety here is the key!)I know it is on the ""Spendy"" side, but this is only two blocks north of the Loop.  Most restaurants of this caliber, and even lesser restaurants in this area, are easily on the ""Splurge"" side.  Quartino's offers fantastic service, casual dinning, no waits, and late night dinning.  If you don't mind the noisy Italian atmosphere, you can't lose here!"
"Warning - the food here is best enjoyed dine-in vs takeout.  I just ordered food from here (a pizza and a caprese salad).  I went and picked it up and walked back to my hotel, eager to dig into the raved about pizza.  I open up the box...and...WTF!?  The pizza was massively overcooked...so overcooked and dried out that the cheese had taken on this coagulated texture.  It was awful.  I even took a bite from a piece thinking...maybe it tastes better than it looks.  Uh, wrong!  So...why the 4 stars for such awful pizza?Well, I called up the restaurant and talked to the manager to explain that I had just paid for the worst pizza ever (really, I'd take a frozen Tony's pizza over this offensive thin crust Italian one).  The mgr was extremely sorry and gracious and immediately offered to bring over a new pizza...and deliver it to my room at the hotel nearby.  He tried to include wine, drinks, appetizers as well, but I declined as it was just me eating.He did show up...hot and fresh pizza delivered straight to my hotel room.  He took one look at the original pizza and instantly knew it was not okay to have served that.  And even though I had said I didn't need anything else, he threw in a HUGE tiramisu dessert (which of course I had a few bites of).  I thought that was over the top service that deserves 4 stars.  Granted, I still give that warning to you all (see first sentence) as to prevent any of you from having a similar fate.  :-)  But just nice to know that they really did care about rectifying the situation.  And the pizza and caprese salad were delish!!!"
"Went here with the husband and in-laws for a Thursday night dinner.  The food is very good, didn't sample wine though (have on previous trips but not this occasion).  They take reservations and have valet parking which you can't beat with a stick.  The cheese fondue and the bananas dessert are wonderful.  The restaurant is a bit noisy though.  Good experience overall."
"SO I went back to Quartino and tried their pizza and a few other items on the menu.  I was seriously disappointed.  We ordered:MELANZANE PIZZA.-TOMATO, MOZZARELLA, GRILLED EGGPLANT, AND SHAVED GRANA.-----The pizza was dry & crust tasted like burnt bread.  This is just my personal opinion, but I was not a fan and don't believe pizza is Quartino's forte.POLENTA FRIES-  yuck...again, my personal opinion.  I was not a fan of these.DESERT- NUTELLA PANINO-..This was just toasted Italian bread with a thin layer of Nutella.  It did not have much flavor, but easy to replicate at home and a good idea for company.  I DO SUGGEST TRYING THE FRIED DOUGHNUTS...HOLY COWWINE- DOLCETTO D'ALBA.   This was a smooth Pino Noir.  I'm more of a Merlot or Cabernet drinker, and still enjoyed this wine.Yea, my last trip to Quartino was quite disappointing and I don't suggest ordering the pizza.  Still one of my favorite restaurants though!"
"Love this place. Great spot to go with friends and share 15 little plates. Good atmosphere and you can get noisy in here without looking like a complete ass.I liked, the mussels, salmon, and tortellinis but everything was good."
"I was a little hesitant about Quartino because their menu didn't seem as extensive as the typical list of tapas you would encounter in the usual spanish tapas type of restaurants. However, if you look a little deeper into their menu, Quartino actually has quite a selection. They have a whole menu just for antipasta. We didn't order anything from that menu but the table next to us did and it looked pretty good. Food comes out pretty fast here (something I always appreciate!) and the prices are very affordable. Their different sizes of wine carafes makes it easy to sample a lot of different wines. There wasn't anything I had that I would be dying to go back for but since the menu is pretty extensive and affordable, I would definitely like to go back to try some of their other tapas and pizza.My Quick BitesQUATTRO FORMAGGI PIZZA  Very cheese and crisp. However I felt that the four cheese were not very distinct and just tasted like a one cheese pizza.BRUSCHETTE  We ordered the portebella bruchette and it was a nice change of pace from the original tomato brushette. Very tasty!POLENTA FRIES  We couldn't resist ordering this dish. The polenta fries came out hot and fresh with a side of sauce. I wasn't very impressed as the polenta didn't have much taste and the sauce didnt' aid in that respect either.SPAGHETTI  We wanted a simple pasta dish so we opted for just spaghetti. It was pretty good and it was great for sharing!"
"This was my second trip to Quartino- the first was awhile back with a party of around ten, and we shared several dishes/desserts among us. Though I can't recall what they were, when a girlfriend and I were in the area and looking for good Italian on a Sunday afternoon I remembered this spot. We were promptly seated and the service was friendly and responsive. Italian tapas are a newish concept to me, and the servers are very clear that the dishes are moderately sized and meant to be shared. We tried the cavatelli, which was good but not great- the pasta was a bit too chewy and saucy, but that can probably just be chalked up to my own personal preference. The quattro stagioni pizza (artichokes, roasted peppers, grilled zucchini, portobello mushrooms, and grana), however, was EXCELLENT! Crisp thin crust and the toppings all complemented each other quite well. Would definitely recommend the pizza!"
"lemony goodness...i've been to quartino a handful of times since my last review and it's becoming one of my faves... the european atmosphere makes it inviting to lounge, sip and nibble... reminding us that we need to take it easy once in a while.  their $8 half carafe of rosso is decent - i even asked our server why it was so ""cheap"".  he replied that they cut a good deal with the distributor passing the savings onto us - score!  it's not the best but it's drinkable.  the broccoli rabe remains my fave dish, mainly because i just don't know how to cook through the bitterness of it at home.  but my latest discovery: LEMON GELATI PANINO = homemade lemon gelato sandwiched between 2 lemony pancakes served atop fresh lemon curd and topped with lemon cream and lemon chips!  TWO sandwiches come in one serving!  SO SO SO GOOD."
"Fantastic place to go with a group- they have a great set-up for family style dining, a large menu and the food is delicious! I went with a group of 8 and we had a bit of everything and some wine, with the total bill under $30 each."
"we shared a pizza - spinich and speck and one other ingredient, and it was delicious. we both were full. we each had a few glasses of the house wine, again both the red and the white were great, and we got out there at $36.00 bucks.we ended up sitting at a table in the bar area so we could sit sooner. the crowd was good, great energy without anyone being out of control, and the service was very very good.i highly suggest this place."
"This is one of my favorite places to nosh in River North.  The food is always tasty and the service is excellent.  Everything is served ""European-style"", meaning it arrives at your table as soon as its done, unless you specify an order you'd like it in.  The Bellini's are delish, as are the pizzas and the sauteed spinach (one of the best reditions in the city, heavy with roasted garlic but not too much).."
"I had to think hard about rating Quartino, and it wasn't until I realized that I wasn't being as objective as I usually am that I went with the higher 4 star rating.  Innately, my pysche shouted ""3 star 3 star"" but we'll get to the explanation of that later.So objectively, as I oft try to do:Location: 5 out of 5.It's not often that I give a restaurant 5 out of 5 stars for their location, but Quartino's seems to have it down flat in terms of where they are located.  Easily accessible by public transportation (Red Line, 22 Clark bus, etc.) as well as the highway.  I can't speak for valet service because a)I did not make use of it and b)when I went last night it was Venetian night and it looked a little more crowded than usual.Bar area: 4 out of 5.Nothing really negative to say about this bar area, except for the fact that it was a little noisy, but then again, it was packed.  For my personal preference, I would rate it a 4.  If it were the middle of the day and not too many people were around, I'd probably upgrade to a 5.  Also, I saw a family that brought a very young kid to the restaurant - we're talking like no more than 3 or 4 years old.  And this was at night.  At 1030pm.  WHO DOES THAT?  TO THE BAR AREA?!  (this in no way impacts my rating, it was just an observation)Service: 5 out of 5.  All around, very attentive service.  From the bartenders to the bar area to the waiter in the dining area, couldn't complain.  Fast, efficient, polite, professional.  Couldn't have asked for better.Food: 4 out of 5.Here is where I struggled, because had it been up to me to rate the food, I would have given it 1 star.  or 1/2 star.  But objectively, it deserves a 4.  The reason I took umbrage to the food is because it's family style.  Yes, I knew that going in it would be a lot of sharing, and it was tapas, and everyone was supposed to order a few small hot plates and share.  Even the waiter suggested this.  Alas, since I grew up eating family style ALL the time with my Asian American heritage, I enjoy my own personal plate, unless it is dim sum, but that is out of necessity.  I like to try too many foods at dim sum to try to eat each serving by myself.  Sorry, I digress.  Yes, I hate family style dinners.  I hate sharing my food because if I took the time to order what I wanted, no one else should get to have any.  But I played along since it was someone's birthday, and did the family style gig.  A couple of options for the food: there are pizzas, cold apps, hot plates, soups, salads, etc.  But aside from that, there is also the salumeria menu (antipasto is the best I can come up with) that included olives, peppers, various smoked meats (prosciutto, duck prosciutto, various salamis, etc. etc. etc.) I think our table got a good mix of smoked meats, veggies, olives, fish, as well as a few pizzas.  The pizzas are different to say the least.  If you're looking for Malnati's or even traditional thin crust, this is NOT the place for you.  Think exotic, like prosciutto with grilled radicchio and balsamic.  It was definitely an acquired taste. Not terrible, but radicchio is awfully bitter.  And as much as I am complaining and bitching, the family style here wasn't too bad.    Not the best food I've had, but it was very good overall.  Pricing: 3 out of 5I'm torn on this one, because some things are so reasonably priced at Quartinos, and yet some things were not.  Example: the house wine they had was 12 dollars a bottle.  Yes, an entire bottle, and I've definitely had WORSE wine than their house wine.  But at the same time, a half carafe of bellini was 19.  The pizzas were all reasonably priced at 10 - 12 dollars.  No complaints there.  But some of the antipasto options were 4 - 5 dollars.  (granted, olives were about 2, which is fine, and I'm not saying that there weren't cheap tapas options, I'm just using the higher price point as a comparison).  I think the moral of the story is that if you study their menu prior to dining, you can definitely eat and drink for a reasonable price.  Let's assume 2 people are dining.  You could have a bottle of house wine (12 dollars), split a pizza (11 on average), have one or two tapas (2 - 4 dollars each) and maybe a dessert (5 - 6?).  At the same time you could easily double or triple what I just quoted.  It's really up to your dining tastes.Overall: 4 out of 5Final Word:  Worth a look if you have a large group of friends or want a nice romantic dinner.  They have an upstairs dining area that actually looked nicer than the downstairs, but this might have just been my personal preference.  I would NOT bring children to this restaurant, and I think they would have a harder time finding something delectable (to them).  The only thing I would question is their accessibility for people in wheelchairs.  Dining on the first level would be fine, but I did not see an elevator to go to the restrooms on the second floor.  Not saying it's not there.  I just didn't see it."
"Any place that has prosecco on the wine list is OKAY with me.Quartino has prosecco on the wine list. Quartino also has carafes of bellinis, and carafes of some insanely cheap but very very good wine. I don't know how they manage to sell it so cheap, but it's FANTASTIC and like $4.Food is served tapas-style. Plates are small and damn delicious. Our group tried pizzas (two of them), polenta fries (AMAZING), mushroom risotto, gnocci, ravioli, and scallops. And we loved EVERYTHING.And then we looked at the desserts - some of us grabbed the profiteroles, which were fantastic. And the rest of us were totally and completely happy with chocolate fondue.My only issue with the place was that it was REALLY LOUD. But we also went at 8 on a Friday with a group of about 20. Small wonder we couldn't hear each other, no?"
Went with a group of eight and had a good time. The waitress had some excellent recommendations and didn't over sell for the sake of boosting the bill. The food is good and sure to please a wide variety of tastes.
"The food was excellent (in addition, a great value) as was the sangria, but the noise level is almost intolerable. I felt myself screaming at my date and almost had a hoarse voice by the end of the night. Definitely try to get a seat outside if its still warm out!Oh, and the arugula pizza was DELISH."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  The food is amazing, great wine list and city center location makes it fun.  The prices are very fair and on the less expensive side.  The atmosphere is always upbeat and busy.  I would suggest making a reservation, especially on the weekends.  The manager Nick Haubrich will make any guest feel right at home and has always made our experiences perfect!"
"The Italian tapas concept is inventive, but I'm afraid the food at Quartino is not.I split a Pizza and a risotto with a friend.  The four-cheese Pizza was plain with a rich acidic tomato sauce and tangy blue cheese and the asparagus risotto was runny.I wanted to like this place more than I actually did.  It has that big-chain aspiring to be small restaurant sort of feel.  And while I didn't try any of the wine carafes, I can't help but wonder where the wine comes from?  A big wine bag out back?The service was overly attentive bordering on rehearsed.  I simply felt like this place was trying too hard to be innovative and cool and lost track of the fundamentals, good food, nice atmosphere, and warm sincere service."
"A group of friends and I decided on Quartino for an early Friday dinner, and the place was packed by 5:30. The space is very warm and inviting, and our group of five was seated in the mist of out-of-town families, older couples, and twenty-somethings that had probably just gotten off work. Our waiter was friendly enough, though hard to get a hold of during the peak time. Our party was very excited to see a valet in the bathroom.We were all poor college students, so instead of ordering in the manner suggested (1.5 plates person), we each ordered one dish and then got an order of calamari as an appetizer. This worked fine, as none of us needed a ton of food anyways, but I understand how the average person would not be satisfied with one plate. The calamari's breading was light, crispy, and well seasoned-- a very good start. For the main dish I ordered the linguine with clams, and the rest of the table tried the gnocchi, the lasagna al Forno, and the garganelli con Ragu D'Agnello. The lasagna took a while to come out, though that's pretty typical for such a dish, and everything else was speedy. I ordered the linguine with the white sauce, and it was light and buttery in such a way that I can't imagine the red sauce working nearly as well. It was simple and fresh, the clams were especially good, but nothing amazing. Opinions about the gnocchi were split, one person liked it but another said it was bland, the lasagna was tasty but unmemorable, and the table agreed the garganelli was very good. We all came away from the meal pleased, though not wowed. Don't get me wrong, I had a good experience. For a restaurant in this location, the food was affordable and un-gimmicky. Quartino was just not particularly memorable, and I don't think I would go out of my way to come again."
"Bello Bello BelloHaving lived in DC for so long before I came here, this place strikes me as the Italian Bistro du Coin of Chicago.There is great energy here and great food and wine.   Everything is fresh and prepared wonderfully and the kitchen is open till 1AM!   How wonderful.You must have the assorted olives with at least a half liter of wine to start your meal.   The salads are fantastic and fresh.   The pasta is the best I have ever had.  On a hot day my buddy ordred some ice cream before his meal.  The Gelato and ice cream is fantastic too.   There is wonderful outside seating too!"
"We go to Quartino all the time and its consistently great. Good prices. Good food. Fabulous thin crust pizza. And the best service. Liz in the bar always takes care of us and she is awesome. Friendly, knowledgeable, and cheerfully tolerant of all my stupid requests.  Oh, but the brussel sprout salad needs to be a year round thing... ;)"
"Well, this dinner out in Chicago was SOOO much better than our last trip!  We made reservations, and we only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated.  It was crowded and loud, but that was kind of part of the charm.  We split a 1/2 carafe of Marques de Riscal, which wasn't our favorite.  For dinner we shared the polenta fries, mushroom risotto, and the quattro stagioni pizza.  My husband also got the roasted bone marrow, but that is something I don't do.  Everything was really good.  Our waiter was nice, but after dinner we planned on ordering dessert and coffee and he didn't even ask.  Just dropped our check and walked away.  So that was a little disappointing.  But overall, it was a great dinner experience.  (FYI- there is an attendant in the bathroom.  I felt like a big jerk because I left my purse at the table.)"
"Wandered in for an early, brief lunch and we enjoyed our food very much. We did individual salads and shared the mushroom risotto and shrimp. I can be skeptical of risotto, but the mushroom was very well done. Staff were attentive, but not overbearing. We were catching up after not seeing each other for quite a while and that early in the day, the noise other diners mentioned was not an issue for us. I would return and would definitely try more."
"Great atmosphere, great food.  A the price/quantity ratio could have been a little better, but that's not surprising from a tapas place on state.  Oh, and the Italian wine was spot on."
"Great place. Food is good/fun. Small plates, great to share. Desserts are also very good. Love the salami menu. Slider appetizers are good. Short rib is great. Pasta's good. Downstairs is loud and fun and upstairs is less loud and still fun. Waitstaff is very attentive with personality. I recommend this place to out of town visitors whenever they seek my opinion. Great cocktails, too!"
Definitely one of the better Italian establishments in River North. Nice outside patio in the summer. Excellent service. Bar area is very happening. Even has a great lunch!
"I love this place!!! The only problem I had was the wait..they were very very busy. So, had the Chilled zucchini, excellent ! The Farmhouse chicken was so tasty, and we had a pizza. The crowning glory was the donuts you dipped in dark chocolate. My God that was awesome!  I love the tapas type dining, and since it was Italian, that made it even better. The manager was awesome, the hostess were very professional. The waitress was ok, but they were slammed so it was ok. She was very nice it just took a while to get things. We also didn't realize it was a tapas style restauant so one person didn't get her pasta till after most of us were done eating, but that was our bad. Love the food here."
"Now, I realize there are many a great eats in Chicago, and I do try to eat at a new place I have never tried before, but this is a place I try to visit almost every time. It is casual, simple, small plates Italian, and their slogan is ""where wine is cheaper than water."" I'm not sure anyone needs to read much more, but just in case you are, the bellini is delicious, as well. Believe it or not, it is the closest to the original from Harry's in Venice I've tried."
Stopped in here last Saturday for a late lunch....the food was delicious.  Shared amongst our table:calamaristeak tartaresun-dried tomato soupveal slidersI think my favorite of all was the veal sliders....a cousin to mini hamburgers.  Quartino's is a reliable place for great small plates to share.
"We had our wedding reception at Quartino, and I can't say enough good things about both the food and the service.  The event planning staff (Julie) was very professional, responsive, and easy to work with.  We had a private dining room for 35 people, and three wait/bar staff dedicated to our room (led by Roberto).  They were so helpful and went out of there way to make sure everyone's wine glasses were filled throughout the night, and that every table had as much of the family-style food as they could eat.  Everything was delicious!"
"The fact that Quartino has been open for 3 years and is still packed to the gills every weekend says a lot. It's a loud, boisterous, busy place with great food, great service and the sort of charm that keeps people (like me) coming back again and again.I love the fact that you can really make the experience your own - whether you're looking for drinks and light appetizers, a meal that will leave you stuffed, or just coffee/dessert, Quartino has you covered. The last time I was there, my friend and I ordered way too much food (fondue...and ravioli...and a pizza...and zeppole) but it was all delicious. I really like their polenta fries, as well as the tortellini soup - those have stood the test of time for me. Those donuts are killer, though. *Adding those to my list of favorites.*Downsides: you never know what the wait time will be, so better to make a reservation if you're on a tight schedule. And, as pretty much everyone has already said, it's LOUD so just know what you're getting into."
"One word.  Fondue.  I opened my menu and immediately closed it.  I ordered my fondue with bread and apples.  It rocked my word.  My boyfriend and I got in a huge fight while we were waiting for our server to come greet us.  We sat in silence for a minute or two and then our waiter came over to explain the menu.  This is what he said: ""These are small plates so we recommend you order a few and share.  I hope you guys like each other!""  That was probably the best thing to say to a couple that's scowling at each other.  It instantly ended our fight.  I digress.The food was so tasty. I was impressed.  The restaurant has a really great feel to it.  I went upstairs to go to the bathroom and the bathroom felt like it was from the 1920s.  They even have powdered soap.  All in all, I had a great time and lovely meal."
"Great atmosphere and service. Food was reasonably priced and drinks were as well.  Food taste was mediocre at best. We had pizza, scallops, pasta and veal meatballs. Pasta and ""gravy"" had no flavor at all.  Everything else was ok.  Very lively atmosphere for drinks but food I could do w/o"
"It's official, I love this restaurant.  If I could, I would eat here everyday.  Imagine a large, bustling dining room filled with the smells of house cured meats and cheeses.  Tables are set rustically; mismatched plates, tarnished  silverware, and bar towels as napkins.  It is peasant Italian at it's best.  Service is quick, incredibly knowledgeable, and efficient.  Last night I was taken care of by Zack, a kind and funny server who was very comfortable talking about the different wine offerings.  He even took the time to do a blind taste test with us.  We settled on an incredible Barbaresco. Thanks Zack!My favorite part of the meal is the salumeri offerings that you chose from a separate menu.  If it weren't for the other tasty offerings on the main menu, I would be happy to dine on the salumeri menu as my main dinner.  Prosciutto, sopressatta, parmigiano regiano, and oil cured olives were served with tiny salads of fennel, red grapes, apricots, and artichokes.  It's so fun to take all of the different ingredients and make different combinations.Although the menu is designed to share plates, I took a more traditional approach and coursed out an appetizer (the salumeri offerings), salad, and entree.  My entree was incredible!  Tender beef filets served in a brodo of wine, garlic, broccoli rabe, and chili peppers.  It had just enough sauce to require house baked bread to sop it all up!  Mmmmmm!Please, please try this restaurant and enjoy the extensive list of wines by the glass, 1/2 L, L, and bottle."
The interior design of this bar/restaurant is simply beautiful.  This is one of the first places I visited while in Chitown and I was floored.  The food is equally as good.  Out of our 5 day stay we ate here twice....I ilke it.
"I have been to Quartino's many times and it is always an outstanding experience! Small, tasty dishes served in a huge downstairs dining room coupled  with Italian Soaps playing on the flat-screens around the dining room (or soccer if you're lucky) with mismatched silverware, china, and chairs (oh my!). Open kitchen on the main floor with a fireplace and private rooms upstairs. Even a see-through bathroom! I told you this place rocks!Honestly, I've always gone in with a free pizza coupon. Not that I wouldn't pay full price, but come on, the economy right? Restaurants are hurting so bad to fill the seats, right? Ha, I made 5:30 pm reservations on a Friday evening and the place was packed already. Line out the door by 6 pm. You know something has to be right when people line up in the middle of winter to get some...Finally, let me touch on the service. Each time we have gone we've had a different server. Yet all of them are fantastic. Even in a busy rush on a busy night, they will stand and welcome you, explain what's going on with the menu and happily (with a smile no less!) get your drinks and food. The food runners and bussers are professional and well trained. These folks will take care of you.I would bring my folks here - it's that good."
"If you want a great place to go with friends or family, Quartino's is the place! I actually went here on a date, but the atmosphere is perfect for a group outing. With that being said, it tends to get pretty noisy. However, the Italian tapas plates are phenomenal. They are beyond flavorful! My boyfriend and I ordered 4 dishes between the 2 of us! Perfect portions! Also, great wine!! Tip: be sure to make a reservation. Always very crowded."
"Quartino is absolutely kickin' on a Saturday night.  I'm talking packed to the gills, people flowing into the streets, loud as hell crowded.  My saving grace?  The Cellar Room, which is not really in the cellar - it's a room just off the main dining room that allows you some reprieve from the insanity when dining for one of your fabulous friend's 30th birthday dinner!Because our dinner organizer is so very smart, she organized a $35 pre-fixe menu including 4 courses (appetizer, pasta, entree and dessert) and an all-you-can-drink wine package for the low-low price $15 each.  Come on.  All you can drink wine for $15?  Sign me up!!On to the grub! Appetizers: Neapolitan pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, zucchini, funghi), veal meatballs and crispy calamari. I indulged in the zucchini and funghi.  Absolutely delish.   Pasta Course: Cavatelli with ricotta, tomatoes, fresh basil and Tagliatelle Bolognese.  The cavatelli was served lukewarm or even cold, but I can imagine that served at the proper temperature, it would be a party in my mouth.  The ricotta was creamy and plentiful and the pasta was just right.  The tagliatelle bolognese was piping hot and chock-full of meat.  I was a fan!Main Course: Garlic shrimp with E.V.O.O., Pinot Grigio and lemon, Farmhouse Chicken with lemon and herbs and the Prime Angus Beef with seasonal vegetables.  The shrimp can best be described as orgasmic.  If I could have licked the bowl dry, I would have.  Our chicken was great as well.  Dessert: Dark Chocolate Fondue served with fruit and homemade biscotti. Honestly, at this point I was at maximum fullness, what with the prior 3 courses and licking the shrimp bowl clean (ha), but I managed to snag a few strawberries and a biscotti.  Mmmmm....Quartino turned out to be the perfect spot to ring in my bud's 30th b-day.  With good food, endless wine and rowdy conversation, it was a night I won't soon forget!"
"I can't say much about the atmosphere at Quartino, as every time I have been there it has been on the outdoor patio. Which, of course, always provides great people-watching opportunities.The staff here is very friendly, quick, and know how to enhance a dining experience. The food is terrific and I would say that Quartino has always been a go-to for any type of occasion--a reunion with an old friend, a birthday dinner with 8 girls, a date.I have never eaten anything here that I didn't like. It is not a place that will blow you away, but it is an old standby that never disappoints!"
"I love, love, love Quartino's.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  It's GREAT for large groups, and the Italian tapas concept is fantastic.  While this restaurant always seems to be packed,  the wait staff and management handle it well.  I've never felt neglected or cramped, even though the restaurant is often a zoo.I especially love this place because it's totally possible to get a great dinner on a tight budget - even the wine is affordable!My group of friends has made this our destination restaurant for any and all celebrations - I think we've done a good job eating our way through most of the menu and I have yet to sample a dish that wasn't delicious.  Last but not least, there is nothing better than having a girls' lunch on the outdoor patio when the weather is nice - I'm counting down the days till Chicago winter is over and I can celebrate with pizzas and Bellinis outside!"
"Heard great things about this place so it was one of the first I visited when I moved here. It's packed most nights so it's best to call ahead and make a reservation. The service was great and the food was delicious! The appetizers (cheese, prosciutto, etc.) alone were enough and the entire atmosphere has a great authentic Italian feel to it. Whether its enjoying a nice dinner or having a few drinks by the bar, this place never disappoints!"
"A serious good time.We opted to sit at the Wine Bar. Our fantastic bartender Holly let us try a few robust wines, and took the ones we didn't like off the bill. We had about 3 1/4 carafes of delicious leathery reds that were complimented by the Tasting Sampler we ordered. It was amazing. Italian cheeses, olives, meats, salads.. all amazing. She even told us about the secret to life: Italian Gorgonzola + Apricot spread + Australian Melbac. Fucking amazing.You get to chose from a bunch of things for the $25 tastings, but I would recommend skipping on the artichokes (they are bland), and the black olives (they taste like chocolate + anchovies; the other olives are amazing though). The place is cute, they serve wine in cups like in Italy, and the all the staff we encountered was super sweet. We finished off with some home-made Limoncello (highly recommended!) and this crazy lemony vodka milkshake. Seriously, $60 left us stuffed and tipsy. It was SUCH a great time."
I love this place. Italian tapas and wines by the carafe. What more can you ask for? I've been many times and the food never disappoints. I enjoyed going in the summer when we were able to sit out on the sidewalk and enjoy the fresh air. Inside is nice too but can be very loud.
The menu looked very appetizing when I read it online.  I ended up making reservations since we had a larger group for a busy Friday night.The place was so packed and loud.The food was Italian tapas style with pizza and other stuff.  We shared a bunch of food with our tiny little table that was barely enough to hold the group of us.  The food was solid but not very memorable probably because it was so busy there and was distracting me away from the food quality.  I ordered a pizza and a couple of beers so that was enough for me.
"The four is only because I've been there once.  The menu was creative and lengthy.  I also enjoyed that they have an olive, cheese, and salami bar.  The prices are very reasonable for what you get.My friends and I got an appetizer, a bottle of wine and a pizza for $45 all together.  That isn't bad at all.  The wine we had was very good and the selection was vast.The service was attentive, polite and accurate.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.I hope to return soon to try more.  Perhaps the rating will increase to a five."
"Amazing food, amazing service, great management. This place has never disappointed."
"Craving Italian one night, my boyfriend and I looked on Yelp (of course) and found Quartino.  It's a short walk from our house and a nice jaunt to the movie theater, so we decided to try it.Most of my Italian experience comes from Olive Garden, so I was excited for the family-style ordering.  We settled on the Gorgonzola Dolce and Sopressata  to start, and were pleasantly surprised when it came with yummy raisin bread and tons of garnishes to slap on top of the meat and cheese.  Delicious!  I believe it's absent from the online menu, but we ordered a spinach and mozzarella cheese quiche-like dish next.  The texture was a little odd--chewy and squishy all at the same time, but the taste was satisfyingly salty.  For the main dish we ordered the Fetuccine with tomato basil sauce.  After our first courses, we expected it to be great, but were quickly let down with the first bite.  The noodles were bordering on crunchy and the sauce was watery and tasteless.  I saw that most people around us had ordered the Neapolitan pizza, and if we had been a little more hungry and in the mood for pizza, I think that would have been a better route to take.All in all, it was a fun place to visit, the staff is nice and the food is served insanely fast.  It's a good value too-- minus alcohol, our total came to about $30.  I'd visit again and choose another pasta dish or the pizza."
"This place became one of our favorites. We go there all the time because you can have Italian Tapas! In other words it's just like going to Emilio's or Café Babareeba but having italian food instead.Their pizza is great and the fact that you can order 2 or 3 different risottos (depending on how many people are with you) and share them all with your friends is great because you end up trying everything.Their pasta is great too and so is the Salumeria, where you pick a variety of cheeses, meats and olives as starters.The desserts are also pretty good. This is a fun experience."
"I was here on Friday night for a friend's birthday party. We were in the private cellar room and I'm VERY glad we were secluded from the rest of the restaurant. The acoustics in this place are very very bad. If you go with a large party, request for the private room. You won't be able to hear your party if you're out in the open. We had the prix fixe menu with unlimited wine pours for 3 hours. They offered the house red and white, pinot noir and pinot grigio respectively. They kept refilling our glasses of vino like it was a water glass. Needless to say, I was tipsy in no time! Our group got roughty and raunchy as the night went on (from all the free flowing wine). We had an extensive menu and some of the offerings were very good and some of the others were just so-so.The goodAssorted Neopolitan Pizza: great variety and it was nice and lightVeal Meatballs Napoili: melted in my mouth and I loved the raisins on top.Prime Angus Beef Tagliata with seasonal vegetables: lean and tender (best dish)Shrimp with e.v.o.o., garlic, pinot grigio and lemon: great flavor, just a tad too much garlicFarmhouse Chicken with lemon and fresh herbs: juicy and great flavorClassic Dark Chocolate Fondue with apples, pears, pineapple, strawberries and house-made biscotti: this was my favorite part of the meal. The biscotti was nice and airy and tasted wonderful with the chocolate sauce.The not so goodCrisp Calamari: it wasn't so crisp and I think it was undercooked and way too greasy.Tagliatelle all Bolognese: this had very little tomato sauce and it reminded me of beef stragonaf. There was a lot of this dish left over at our table.Cavatelli with tomatoes, fresh basil & fresh ricotta: our dish was served cold, not even luke warm. It was very mushy too.Our wait was SUPER long. We had reservations at 9:00 and we had to wait at least 20 minutes after that time. This place was packed to the gills too!I would like to go back with my guy for an intimate dinner. This place is good for groups and for couples. There was a good mix of both.They also have reasonable valet and that's a plus!"
"Valentine's Day experience at Quartino.....best thing about this restaurant=price.+/-  1.) Bread --plentiful, but COLD +/- 2.) cheap wine - 16$ for house...SUPER acidic though not good +/-3.) gnocci-good but not your traditional Italian gnocchi...in fact       nothing like   it...interesting dish though....green beans and mini potato chunks with mini gnocci and arugala? - 4.) Broccali Rabe -TERRIBLE. I was really excited when I saw this on the menu--undercooked, wrong taste, 7$ for HORRIBLE b-rabe...and I am a BIG fan of brocc Rabe! very disappointing- 5.) and before I forget....the shared plate where you can pick 2 cheeses, assortment of olives, 2 salumi, and 3 other things for 25$....sounded like a good idea...cheese great, but only like 4 small pieces ....HOWEVER, ---5.A) the ""hot soppresata"" is NOT hot soppresata..it was seriously 95% fat...it was TERRIBLE and its not like getting good hot calabrese authentic soppresata is difficult...L'APPETITO under john hancock has the real stuff!!! ---5.B) procuitto di parma is hard to mess up...but i am pretty sure they dumped salt all over it. SICK---5.C) assortment of olives, literally 9 total and they were all DOUSED in EVOO...gross   --5.D) I don't even know what all the other crap was on the plate....but it was GROSS tried it and GROSS.+6.) refreshing that the taglietelle bolegnese was delicious...BUT the waitress had to make sure they weren't sold out of it...what?+7.) mashed potatoes were great....but those are hard to mess up!Overall, dinner was pretty cheap...but not so great....maybe would go back for lunch? and order something that is hard to mess up while keeping in mind that the antipasti is TERRIBLE!"
"First suggestion is that you make a reservation.  This is a nice date place but can get very very crowded.  The staff was very nice and the waiter was very helpful when assisting us in choosing our plates.  The variety of food here is amazing. Portions are a great size.  Most of what we ordered was more than delicious.  I recommend coming here and taking your time ordering, eating, and enjoying the company you are with."
"I read thru most of the yelp reviews before attending a birthday party at Quartino a few weeks ago, and the verdict seemed to be: mixed bag.  Kinda touristy, kinda loud, kinda fun, some of the menu is good, some not...so I went in with fairly low expectations.  Which is probably why I had a super time at the birthday party and would easily return to this place.We had a private room for our party of about twelve people, which was awesome.  There was an oddly placed, gigantic (unnecessary) flat screen TV on the wall, which we turned off immediately.  Other than that, the ambiance was great and the room was quiet enough to have conversations, yet the fun ""party"" atmosphere of the restaurant still infiltrated.  The server was a tad grouchy, but she was pretty much on the ball with second (and third and fourth) rounds, food orders, etc.Onto the food and drink: Three words.  FOUR DOLLAR WINE.  And not just a glass of wine, a little pitcher, which is probably about two and a half glasses.  That alone will keep me coming back.  The menu is mostly small plates, although they do offer entrees.  Since we were with a big group, we ordered lots of stuff and passed the plates.  My favorite things were:  polenta fries, asparagus risotto, all the pizzas, and the salmon.Quartino is a great place to go with a big group.  Definitely call ahead for a reservation if you are going on a weekend or with a party of more than six.  Our group had a lot of food and a LOT of wine and got out for about $30 a person.  Not bad at all. It may be a tad ""touristy"", but those are some smart tourists.  They must have done their homework...fellow yelpers, perhaps? :)"
"I LOVE Quartino.  As long as you're prepared going in that this is a LOUD and hectic place (it is always packed when I go there), you'll have a great time.The wine is extremely affordable, and the food is always consistently solid.  Definitely my favorite Italian tapas/winebar in the city.  I much more favor going here than across the street to OVS.  Try the cheese fondue, the braised pork ravioli (or any pasta/risotto dish or braised meat for that matter), and anything from the salumeria.  Something about the combo of atmosphere, food, wine always makes me feel so happy after dinner here."
"Pretty good Italian place. The staff is very attentive and eager to answer questions. The prices are relatively fair for the quality and amount of what you get, and the place is handicapped friendly (except for restroom access?) and good for groups and kids. The pasta was exceptional, the pizza was a little dry- but the sauce was really great. I'd recommend the vodka penne and the olive tasting plates. Good spot."
"The hostess and the wait staff are super nice and the outside patio during the summer is great.  The one main issue I had (and why I couldn't give it more than 3 stars) was the noise level....it is really, really loud almost to the point you feel like you cannot hear and you can't enjoy your meal or your drinks and you just want to leave . I have never had an issue with RSVP's maybe I have just been lucky."
"So, I've always heard that people in the Midwest were friendly...the people at Quartino definitely validated this idea. We were seated a little after our reservation time, but it was really crowded, so we understood. Our waiter was extremely attentive, honestly, he probably one of the best waiters I've ever had. We ordered a few small plates...the pizza with prosciutto and arugula, which was divine, a very hearty plate of olives and duck prosciutto, and the veal meatballs. My boyfriend spilled a little of the meatballs on his sweater. Our amazing waiter noticed this, and offered that the restaurant would pay for his cleaning. I couldn't believe it! We had the doughnuts for dessert, and the manager sent over some complimentary limoncello. Nice touch. Needless to say, I'm quite upset that Quartino isn't in my own neighborhood. I would definitely become a regular."
This is one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Chicago. Great for groups. Perfect if you want to share a bunch of dishes. Always amazing!!
"The eggplant parmigiana is to die for.  The eggplant is well-done, which is the only way to eat eggplant.  The sauce was, thick, salty and tangy.  And the entire thing was smothered in a golden-brown cheese crust.  Our very nice waitress just brought one to the table on the house, probably because our octopus dish came really late.The broccoli rabe was my next favorite dish.  It was cooked in broth with garlic and red chili peppers, which resulted in a green, sweet and slightly spicy rabe.  Usually, it's oily and bitter at restaurants.  If I were dining alone, I would have eaten the entire portion.  I like my greens!The margherita pizza was not as good as I had expected.  At a restaurant with such an extensive pizza menu, I expected a great, thin crust and just a sprinkle of cheese.  Instead, the crust was medium-thin, extra-chewy, and the basil was weighed down with a ton of cheese.  My parents seemed to enjoy it, though, despite claiming that they don't really like cheese!Cheese seems to be popular in the dishes here, as our orrechiete with fennel sausage was heavily sauced and then topped with a parmesan snowstorm.  I prefer a more dry orrechiete, with a lemony olive oil coating, sausage, mushrooms, and finely chopped parsley, but this was drenched in a creamy tomato sauce with sausage.Finally, the long-awaited grilled mini octopus arrived.  Four fishy tasting, chewy tentacles.  It had a nice char, but I should have ordered the fried calamari instead.Basically, I would come here if I really wanted an eggplant parmigiana."
"What a letdown.After reading many a glowing Yelp review for this place, I had high expectations for the bachelorette dinner I attended here. However, while there were a few bright spots, for the most part I found myself longing for a change of scenery.First of all, I'm not a big fan of loud restaurants--save the cacophany for taverns and sports bars. The roar of this two-level eatery was deafening, and at first I found it nearly impossible to converse with the gals on the far side of our table--although eventually we all started screaming at each other, which only added to the noise.Secondly, I eat meat, but because my significant other's a veggie, I'm tuned into the whole concept of looking for the menu items with no dead animals in them. Turns out, there weren't very many--even normally innocent items like gnocchi and risotto included PORK BROTH, for some reason. That left the vegetarians and Jews in our party with only a handful of options--sucky at a place where you're supposed to share plates with the carnivores and gentiles.Thirdly, the prices sucked just a wee bit. I've been to many a tapas joint, and $10/plate seems steep. Even Ba-Ba-Reeba skews lower than Quartinos.Fourthly--and this is a minor one--I advise you not to look up at the ceiling, especially as you're waiting to be seated. The white hammered-tin ceiling is dusty and nasty and better left ignored."
"We went to Quartinos tonight and had a great time. I think the service and  atmosphere was terrific. Very attentive and friendly (but busy!) service staff. I think the food although pretty good in presentation was fairly flavorless. We ordered polenta fries, margherita pizza, calamari and two pastas. I am not sure I would go back with my ""foodie friends"" but it is a good place to go with kids/teenagers. $90 for two adults and two toddlers is a bit steep for mediocre food."
"Still 5 stars! My boyfriend took me for my birthday dinner...we only ordered one item different from what I have had before, the BEEF FILLETS, they were very good! The other food was just as good as the last time we were there. He asked them to bring my a piece of tiramisu for a birthday treat and it was amazing....had a glass of Mascato D'asti with it which was also great!"
"Caprese Salad, grilled octopus,gelato, great bar.Ate here a couple of years ago and couldn't wait to get back!  Wonderful service and real Italian food"
"Yum...that's all I have to say. Not really I have a little bit more to say. Came here this past Saturday. Of course I was late for my reservation (like always). It was a special occasion so I wanted to sit outside. The hostess said about a 10-15 minute wait, but then somebody came up to us and said there was a table ready. We decided to order a pepperoni pizza, the gnocchi, and the lasagna. I was kind of dissappointed in the pizza. The was extremely greasy. It was my first time having gnocchi and it was really good. The lasagna though oh my. The bolognese sauce was delish. I really enjoy the tapas style. The show stopper though was the italian donuts. They were fresh, light, and fluffy. Paired perfectly with the chocolate sauce. Go there now!!"
"Loooove Quartino. Definitely some of the best Italian in the city and there is such a variety of things to try - it's hard to pick just a few! However, it is tapas style, so if you have a group it's a great way to try a little of everything! My favorite thing out of our meal were the bacon-wrapped dates... sooo delicious. The pizza is great too. We also loved the penne with vodka sauce. The vodka sauce was made perfectly. Great selection of wine. I highly recommend!"
"Rule #1 of Italian food: remember its noodles, sauce, and cheap meat, charge accordingly.The food is decent but obscenely overpriced, which is pretty much par for the course in River North. Good but overpriced food for people on expense accounts and tourists who don't know any better. The reason it gets the two stars is the service is very good for a place as big as it is, the staff is knowledgeable and makes educated suggestions for you, and the tapas style of eating is something I really enjoy to do. The decorations are fairly contrived and tacky, which wouldn't bother me if they weren't trying way to hard to be authentic.The dishes are good but univentive. When my father says ""This place is gentrified Italian food"" you know you are bland as can be. All the pasta dishes were all right, but very small and all ranging around $10. The $30 cheese plate was positively miniscule for the price. When the bill came to $200 with tip, I wondered how people justify the price for food that is a slight upgrade from the Olive Garden. I'm not asking for gourmet, innovative Italian food (which I don't think exists anyway), just make the prices commensurate with what you are serving and at least try to make it look like I couldn't prepare your food at home"
"Good Italian food is scarce in the high and arid west where I live, so I searched it out in Chicago when I was there for a conference. I'm glad I did! Here's what I enjoyed at Quartino:Bresaola antipasta with candied mustard fruitArugula and orange salad with sliced peppersMushroom risotto, half orderTorta de chioccolattoThe antipasta was something I've never heard of before: Bresaola, which is paper-thin air-dried beef that has been seasoned with something wonderful and fleeting that I couldn't quite identify. It was served with, among other things, a spoonful of 'candied mustard fruit.' That, in turn, is a candied fruit puree of sorts that has mustard seeds in it. Really unusual, but really good.The salad was delish, and was beautifully presented. By now, I was practically purring. I was also about half-way through my half-carafe of wine (really cheap at $8!), which may have influenced my mood, too. Thankfully, my server recommended a half-order of mushroom risotto, and I took her advice. When it arrived, it was steaming hot, packed with mushrooms and soooo good. It's creamy succulence was a perfect counter to the bitter / citrusy / fiery salad I had just finished. For desert, the torta de chioccolatto was over-the-top. Like the risotto, it arrived hot and fresh from the oven. It was slightly gooey in the middle, firm on the edges, and served with a scoop of vanilla gelatto on top. (Can I use the word 'chocorgasm' on Yelp?)To top it off, the service was great -- attentive and friendly."
"Somebody freeze time, I'm in heaven!!!!Ate here with my dad. First, we were worried we wouldn't be able to get a table because there was a mob of people waiting! Thankfull, everybody was waiting to be seated outside, so we got a table indoors immediately. Ordered the ""Fungu?"" pizza (mushrooms and tomatoes) and the Clam Linguine with white sauce. Sure, those were amazing, but on to the best part - dessert!!Apparently their Tiramisu is on the secret menu. IT. WAS. AMAZING. I have never had such amazing tiramisu. We also ordered the Gelato (Strawberry, Chocolate, Vanilla) and it came with strawberries, a biscotti, and whipped cream. I could eat that again everyday."
"The best tapas ever! We arrived in Chicago late and fortunately Quartino opens late. It was the perfect beginning to our trip. We were a party of 8 and there was no problem accommodating us at 11:30pm. The atmosphere was old school Italian kitchen. We were sat at a large round table and felt like it was Family Sunday dinner. They have a large selection but we opted for a few plates to share. The food came out quick and piping hot.  Everything was amazing - sausage thin crust pizza, roasted bone marrow, pork belly, caprese, ravioli, mushroom risotto, sauteed spinach, roasted baby octopus, farmhouse chicken, and beef short ribs. Whatever you do -  order the pork belly! It definitely falls into ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"" for us. It was so good the boys were craving for it throughout our trip. I highly recommend Quartino any time of the day. Cant wait to return!"
"Very crowded, and incredibly noisy. Not at all what I was expecting. This isn't the kind of place I would bring a date or my family... at least not on a Saturday night. It was difficult to hear the people sitting at my table. I needed to answer an important phone call, and couldn't hear a thing. This is a very large establishment with indoor, outdoor, and upstairs seating. It's also open late. Quartino seemed to cater to many large groups, most of which appeared to be there for a pre-clubbing meal.We made reservations, but still had to wait around in a very crowded entry way, pushed back and forth, for quite some time. The staff was polite, our server was good, and the other girls in our party loved their Fettuccine. I chose a vegetarian broccoli dish instead. I didn't know veggies were so difficult to cook, and yet mine were tough to chew! The Caprese salad was pretty good, but my mimosa was not good at all. (How do you mess up a mimosa?!) The baby spinach salad was okay, but nothing to write home about. However, I did enjoy my dessert, and my cold water. =-)Oh, did I mention one of my forks was dirty? Mmmm... yeah... dirty forks aren't good. They were also out of the eggplant that I was hoping to try.My experience here wasn't horrible, but it's a prime example of why I'm reluctant to venture out past ye ol' Olive Garden in the US. Every time I try, I walk away underwhelmed. It's not a place that I would willingly choose to try again."
Fabulous pizza.  Wild arugula salad was amazing.  Risotto... eh.   Friendly and prompt service.  Tapas style.   Fast.  Will come back with a group.
"Quartino provides a unique dining experience. Small portion sizes, similar to tapas, to share with your whole party. They stagnate the dishes so you are always eating and always getting a new flavor. They have a comprehensive and authentic Italian menu. They offer a wide selection of Neapolitan pizza. The Soprano pizza is a MUST have - it's topped with classic Chicago giardiniera , need I say more? Stick with the pasta and pizza, they were all very good. The lamb and skirt steak were prepared perfectly but lacked that special house taste to make it something to talk about. We had a large group dining to celebrate a birthday and I was thoroughly impressed with the level of service the staff provided. Definitely a Chicago hot spot that won't zero out your bank account."
"Went here for lunch after shopping on the Magnificent Mile. We ordered the Scortinio pizza. All I can say is yum! Very flavorful with just the right amount of crust. Not too think or not too thin. We also had the caprese salad. The tomotoes were nice and ripe and the mozzarella cheese was delicious. The service was great, very friendly and we were sat outside which was perfect for people watching. It was about $35 for two people and well worth it, we also had beer and my friend had a glass of sangria."
"We wandered over to Quartino's on Saturday around 1:30pm.  We were seated right away by a very friendly hostess; our server also greeted us right away.  He then introduced us to the menu and recommended a few items. We started with a bottle of their house wine, which is a tasty, light, fruity red; and at $15 a bottle, it's a steal (consider most restaurants will charge $30 for something like this). Ordered a sausage pizza, wasn't very impressive but I give it a 7 on a 1-10 scale;  the Prosciutto di Parma was very delicious, served with sweet cucumbers; for our entrees, we ordered the Cavatelli, which is one of their homemade pastas, cooked in tomato sauce, with fresh basil and Ricotta cheese; the roasted salmon; and the Vodka Penne. Overall, the food was tasty, but nothing spectacular (the only thing keeping me from giving this place a 5 star). However, what made this place a memorable dining experience for me was the service.  Our glasses were always filled on time, food came out very quickly, exactly as ordered; our server was very friendly and checked on us throughout the meal, the manager also stopped by to say hello and told us a little bit about the restaurant. Overall, Quartino is a great rustic style restaurant in the heart of Downtown Chicago, with fantastic service and great food at a very reasonable price. Our bill (1 meat, 4 main dishes, and a bottle of wine) was under $65 before tip. Usually half of that goes to a bottle of wine elsewhere if not more. I would highly recommend Quartino to anyone."
"Ah, another small plates place.  I say skip the small plates and go straight for the pizza.  The 12"" pizzas will run you $10-12 and are big enough to be shared between two people.  They recommend getting a few small plates to nibble on while waiting for your pizza, but in our case, the pizza arrived BEFORE the small plates did.  By the time we got our small plates, I didn't really care for them anymore as my attention was focused on the PIZZA.  The Neapolitan-style pizzas have very thin crust and cheese layered on so thinly that it's practically transparent.  But somehow there is an unbelievable amount of flavor packed in.  Very satisfying!The small plates are okay...I wouldn't bother with them.  They give you pretty good bread while you wait anyway.  We had the olive assortment (WEIRD-tasting), the housemade giardiniera (pretty good), the spicy eggplant (also pretty good) and the roasted beet salad (subpar - way too sour), most of which went untouched as we were too busy devouring our delicious pizza.  Next time we're just getting the pizza.  $10 split between 2 for lunch isn't bad at all.  Sure beats going to the neighboring tourist-hell pizza places."
"We went here for my birthday last week because I was craving wine, company and a good time.. Mostly wine, though. :) It's a really cute joint but it's kind of loud and was super packed (good for business, not for shimmying a group of 10 upstairs and cramming us into a table). We tried a vast amount of things, from eggplant to pizza to olives to.. mashed potatoes (it wasn't me ordering those, but they were really good nonetheless). I think my favorite was the clams in a garlic broth. My friend and I kept asking for more bread to ""zope"" (""dunk and soak up the juices and wipe the plate clean"" in Jersey-Italian) with. It was amazing! I think the best of all was the tiramisu for dessert, which was absolutely delicious (or it could've been because I had drank a good amount by that point :) ). All in all, it was a great place to take a group of people for a nice birthday dinner!"
"This is the perfect location to celebrate with a large group.  My Maids picked it for the dining option for my bachelorette party.   It was a lot of fun!  They ordered many appetizers, two pizzas, and two entrees family style for the dozen of us to share.  Drinks came quickly and service was great.  I would highly recommend for sort of group experience.  It's a tad loud so best not for a romantic date night."
"I went to Quartino for the first time a few weeks ago for a bachelorette party pre-dinner that we (I was a bridesmaid) were throwing.  My party-planning inept best friend reserves a table for 20.  We arrive with a party of 6, waiting on 5, and my friend forgets to call Quartino and tell them that.  Fortunately, they had no poblem with that but could only seat us at a table for 6 because the others weren't there yet.  We take the smaller table.Right away, I liked the simple italian decor and thought it was exectued well. It felt very Chicago to me.  We sit down and order a few pitchers of sangria to get us going.  It was nothing special, but was a pretty solid red sangria.  Once we took a look at the menu, we start placing our orders.  The duck prosciutto and brosciola were cured well and served with some sweet jelly and pickled veg on the side. Yum!!!  I love meat.  The polenta fries were served with a roasted red pepper dip and the dish was probably the best polenta that I had ever had.  The fried calamari was nothing special, but crispy and good.  Everything else had dairy in it, so I couldn't eat it, but it all looked good.At this point, our server had been so wonderful and helpful.  Remember the other 5 people I told you about that we were waiting on?  They came in three different sperts through out our meal and each time they came in, our server helped us squish them in to our table built for 6.  I wasn't happy with this at this point because a) these bitches need to get themselves together and make it to a dinner on time, especially when I'm pop'n for it and b) I was really pissed that Quatrinos didn't give us a larger table with the knowledge that we had more guests coming.  At this point, I'm sitting on top of my friends and the people at the table next to me and just dying to order an espresso and get the hell outta there.  As the night went on, the place became super crowded and super loud and super on my nerves.  Still, our server kept his spirits with our table and helped us with everything we needed.  The food here is mediocre to good and service is great.  If you don't mind a loud a boisterous place on a Saturday night you won't have a problem here.  If you are going with a large party, they can accomadate well, just make sure that you have all of your party there when you are seated."
"May 7th, 2010 I went here and with a group of friends for a birthday dinner. Before sitting we decided to go get a drink to get the night started. 2 makers Manhattan's cost $23 which is kind of a lot, but they were nice and strong. After we were seated, the waiter came over introduced himself and was real cool with his delivery. He informed us that it was an Italian Tapas and that sharing is a main part of the ambience. While we were waiting, he bought out an already made Pizza that was so good....sorry yelpers I forgot what kind it was. Anyway, I'm not going to get into everything that was ordered, but I tasted everything and loved it all. The bill came out to be 33 bucks a person including 2 bottles of wine and subtracting the fact that the birthday dude didnt have't to pay. I'm going back very soon."
"Been back twice in the last month, just a solid dining experience with lots of great looking people.  My favs:The mussels are fantastic, save your bread to dip in all the buttery goodness!  Sausage pizza.  The sausage was really something else, where is it from?The one night our table wasn't ready on time (yes, annoying), in fact, it was delayed 30 min.  However, the host comped us - 2 carafes of wine, a red and white, as well as a giant platter of salumeria.  That's how to keep your customers happy!Only thing is, it's pretty damn loud in here, hard to hear someone sitting 2 persons away.  But that's part of the fun..."
"A couple things to note.... 1) Come here with a reservation. We had ours for an early dinner at 5.30pm on a Friday. By the time our party left at 7.30, it was PACKED. I'm talking out-the-door waiting list. 2) Ideally, you should come here if you're 21+. Why? Because they have an awesome list of wines that you can buy by the carafe. You should buy lots of them. Yup. 3) GET THE NUTELLA SANDWICH THINGYS (I can't remember what they are called). Seriously.....even if you are full of delicious food, you can find room for these babies. They are heaven on bread. 4) I almost forgot.....get the polenta fries. Those bitches will change your life. Sure, they might clog a few arteries but it is worth it. Quartino has decent pricing, a great atmosphere, and a great location if you're in the downtown area. Thank you to Chelsea V. for the reco! :)"
"Holy moly, this place is LOUD!  What?I SAID, THIS PLACE IS LOUD!!!!Hell yeah, it is, but that's prob'ly 'cause everybody's drunk off one of their plentiful wines or maybe a tasty peach bellini or five.  Or maybe because it's one of those restaurants that just seems to encourage camaraderie and boisterous friendship, what with the sharing of dishes and all.  Or maybe it's loud 'cause patrons are actually fighting each other for the last braised pork ravioli.  I mean, Laura B. and I were civil enough with each other to share nicely, but had I been dining with someone else, it might've come to shouting and blows...I really enjoyed myself at Quartino.  We overate and over-drank, but I don't get to see my gal pal that often anymore, so we figured why not?  Why not order some broccoli rabe?  And some delicious caprese salad?  And a tre colore salad for good measure?  And sweet lord, the divine braised pork ravioli and perfectly plump seared sea scallops and some sorbets and cappuccinos and and and...  Like I said:  overate and over-drank, but happily.Our server was a total sweetheart--she was super down-to-earth, which I always appreciate amidst a growing sea of pretentious and/or unaffected servers these days, friendly and efficient.  Even our busser was a doll.I could do without the televisions and a smidge less noise would be nice, but hey--eating at Quartino is sort of like eating with my Italian family.  We're loud as hell when we sit down for a meal, especially when the food is good and the setting is comfortable.  Don't tell Nonna, but Quartino's got one up on her--that ravioli... damn, it's good."
"I (and my guests) am just consistently happy with Quartino. It ranges from good to very good depending on the night, and that's why it's my go-to spot when guests come into town. I'm guessing I'm not the only one who feels that way because last night was a Wednesday and the place was packed.And still, we could sit with plenty of room, walk without falling over someone, hear each other pleasantly and get our server's attention within minutes of the desire hitting us for more. The bartenders are friendly, the servers are eager, the food is undersold as  ""small plates"" because there's enough for a light lunch on those plates --  and prices are reasonable for both food and wine. We spent $80 on three people for food and beverages, and we left happy. And that's why I love Quartino. Of course, I will return."
"Don't put risotto on toast and then ingest  result loss of several layers of flesh on roof of mouth.  LOVE this place, food and service, this is one of my favorites in a city that has so many great restaurants. Great atmosphere."
"BEST RESTAURANT IN CHICAGO! Great service, loud restaurant (but better than an awkwardly quiet one). We got the Fungi pizza, 4 cheese pizza, shrimp, chicken soup, gnocchi, lasagna, olives (all 3). EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD! The gnocchi was probably the best thing, we devoured it. SO MUCH FOOD! I will definitely be coming back here!"
"Good range of prices and selection.  Stopped there for a lunch on the patio and had a nice pizza and house wine, which was plenty of lunch for two people.  Smaller portions gave this a euro feel.  Don't go here for a big American pig out."
"This is one of the most fantastic restaurants in the city!I love love love going to Quartino. My friend introduced me to it a few years ago and I've been going ever since. The food here is wonderful and inexpensive. It's kind of loud, but the atmosphere is great and the servers are all excellent. They have consistently been friendly and very helpful.My favorite things to order here are the Pizzas, the Aspargus Risotto, and the Seafood (the Salmon is always great). For dessert, I definitely recommend the chocolate fondue and the donut things (I forget what they are called). I really like that you have the options of bringing wine, buying a bottle in front, and ordering off the wine list. The wine that they offer is always great and always a good deal price wise.I had my birthday party here last year, and it was a perfect meal. They put us in the party room just off of the bar, so it was much quieter and we had a little more room to spread out. We were able to order lots of dishes and share them amongst ourselves, so everyone got to try lots of different things. They were very gracious and I just had a wonderful time.I've also brought visiting family members here and highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good meal!"
"Given this place has 270 mostly positive reviews I'm not going to beat a dead horse here. Or however you say. I think its kinda past its prime but still worth checking out.There is a great wine selection and they serve it by the 1/4 liter and up. You could have lots of fun tasting wine. I am partial to the Pinot Grigio/Pinot Blanco mix. I'm not sure why, I guess it was just something different. I didn't pay any attention to what the red wine people were drinking but they seemed happy. I didn't want any red wine.As far as eats, if you read my reviews, you know I am primarily vegetarian, but occasionally when I go out I cheat. Quartino was occasion to cheat big time. Still, some of my favorite things were vegetarian. The eggplant caponata, the candied mustard fruit that comes with salumeria, and the polenta fries...all really beautiful. The pizza was okay, if you are a vegan and considering cheating I would consider looking elsewhere for pizza. However, the tortellini alfredo, with prosciutto and peas and cream sauce was worth it. As far as deserts, the chocolate fondue, nah. Nothing spectacular. The coppa al banana however, was addictive. Its composed of carmelized banana, vanilla gelato, white chocolate, chocolate syrup, biscotti, and whipped cream. The chocolate syrup is at the bottom so don't get confused like everyone at our table did and think they fooled you. The dark chocolate syrup is in there, you just have to dig. The banana didn't look very carmelized. One person that supposedly doesn't like white chocolate was still attacking the dessert. Addictive.The service was great and they have a nice atmosphere, and valet."
"Quartino is one of my favorite restaurants to go to in the city, especially with big groups.  It's fun and lively without being pretentious - and the food and drinks are great!  My favorites are the pizzas (all that I've tried have been fab), mushroom risotto, and cavatelli pasta.  For drinks I usually roll with the prosecco, which I credit with being responsible for many a fun evening out.  You MUST get dessert here - the chocolate cake with ice cream on top is one of my favorite desserts ever.  The Italian donuts are also good and a unique option.Not only is the food and atmosphere great, but so is the service.  Everyone is knowledgeable and friendly and I've never had a less than stellar experience."
"I finally had a chance to dine at this establishment and I was not impressed with the food. The service was top-notch, and the decor & atmosphere were enjoyable. However, the food was not something I would want again or recommend to my friends. I had the opportunity to taste the pasty mushroom risotto, bland veal meatballs, and oriechette pasta with sausage. For the price I could have easily stopped at the neighborhood Jewel and grabbed something from the freezer section that was tastier. The one food highlight was the ravioli. It was a flavorful dish. Be warned: the portions are small and start from $9. If I was dragged back to Quartino, I would probably invest in the antipasto and create a melange of some delicious concoctions. Even still, I cannot in good conscience recommend Quartino for a delicious and satisfying Italian meal."
"I finally got back here for dinner.   While I didn't remember it quite so crazy and loud, it was pretty fun.  I hardly make my way into the loop area for dinner, so it felt festive in a way, and made me feel like I was a tourist - andthat can be fun.  Great People Watching!  There were moments in our dinner where I think my husband and I were quiet for minutes at a time just zoning out by the craziness around us.  Waiters zipping around, girls in too short dresses running up and down the stairs, numerous hostesses and busboys...We were also right by the kitchen so there was the meat slicing, the line cooks, etc.  The food is good.  I think my husband really enjoyed it even more than I did.  I thought it was fair.  The waiter warned us things would come out randomly and maybe out of order, which they did, and didn't mind as he had warned us.  Awesome cheeses and olives.  The scallops were great, but I believe there were 6 or more on the plate.  Damn...we were sharing, but there was just only so much scallop I could eat, would have been nice with a bit more greens on the plate just to break it up a bit.  The bruschetta was okay really, I had to pour some olive oil on it to liven it up a bit...the Calamari came last - was actually nice after the scallops, but needed salt, seemed like the batter had none in it...but after that it was great.  Desert was alright also..basically it had lemon curd on it, so in my book it didn't matter what else was on the plate...I loved it.The cheap wine thing is Awesome.  Sold.  I like that you could buy the wine to go for 1/2 price!  We were totally tipsy upon leaving, and didn't though.I'd go back with out of town guests for sure.  Make a reservation though...I was glad we did, this place is hopping!"
"Excellent, excellent group dining restaurant. I would highly recommend hosting any group parties here. Very accomodating atmosphere and won't break the bank.Do make your reservations in advance though. They fill up quickly.Considering the price, excellent food, cheap (good) wine, & good service.Big fan of the old Italian movies playing in the back ground while dining."
"A friend and I had lunch at quartino today and we enjoyed every dish.  It was, of course, made even more enjoyable with a half-carafe of white wine.  The eggplant parmiagana was amazing.  The caprese salad was just okay: the basil wasn't very fresh.  The shrimp risotto was yummy.  And, we topped it off with fried donuts with chocolate sauce.  Lunch on a Saturday seems to be the perfect time to go here since there weren't many people, thus not too loud (as mentioned in many other reviews)."
"I recently decided that I would avoid any establishment within 2 miles of Michigan Ave. for the duration of the tourist season. Contrary to my personal rule, I found myself at Quartino on Thursday for a client dinner, and was pleasantly surprised. Very very pleasantly surprised. First of all, the place was packed--patio and restaurant inside--with Chicagoans. Granted, they were the Viagra Triangle/Gold Coast/downtown high rise crowd, but none the less--I appreciated the lack of t-shirts. I ordered the scallops, and would have passed out from culinary bliss at the table, had it not looked extremely unprofessional. There is one thing that bothers me, though, and that's the WC system they have here. First of all, there's a bathroom attendant. Ugh. I always hate those. I do NOT need assistance putting soap on my hands and picking up a paper towel. Also, these attendants are always generous with the paper towels they hand you and it makes me just want to stay STOP! You're killing trees! I don't need an entire stack to dry two hands. Next, this is possibly the worst-situated restroom I've ever seen (next to the ones at Faith & Whiskey. Go there and you'll see what I mean). To get to the WC, you have to climb a hefty flight of stone stairs (though I appreciate the exercise, the angle and smooth finish of the stairs are not stiletto-friendly) and THEN you have to squeeze through a throng of people at the bar who are scarfing down appetizers at a buffet. The bar is RIGHT next to the door for the bathroom, and there are people smashed up against the bar trying to order drinks. These people are not anxious to move and lose their spot in the booze-ordering queue just so you can go empty your bladder. Otherwise, this place is great. Just build in travel time when you need to go to the loo."
great place to eat. Great service. try the wine inexpensive yet very good.
Another restaurant with a form to fill out; The Salumeria Form; JACKPOT!  (Is it weird to enjoy filling out a good form)?Only 3 blocks from my apartment I consider this to be a fairly good find.  The outdoor seating is so-so (a noisy and ugly corner) with a 30 minute wait on a Thursday night.  Hostess wasn't the friendliest person to deal with either.I was here on a date and the whole point of the menu is family style/ tapas /  sharing plates.  You get an OK amount for each order but its definitely picking food; I wouldn't come hungry   So we ordered a few things:A    Duck prosciutto B    Prosciutto de parmaA    Giardiniera Romana (homemade pickled vegetables) really tasty!A    Roasted peppers; really delicious C-  Romaine Hearts; swimming in dressing and covered with sliced parmigiano... gross!The service was fine and the bill came to about $60 bucks for the above a few drinks.  The real treat is the Salumeria Menu which comes on a double-sided form which you get to fill out.
Yum!  Even the olive oil tastes good here!  I like this place because of the atmosphere.  It is so earthy and when it get crowded - it looks like a bug family having a good time.I've tried a lot of there food since I was with a party of 12 (we split all of our plates) and the dishes that I really liked were the:- Farm House Chicken- Salmon- Linguini with Clams- CavatelliAll of them were good!  You will not be disappointed!
"I really, really like Quartino.  At this point, I've been here more times than I can count, and I've never had a bad experience.  The wine: the best part of Quartino?  The wine list is cheap, interesting and tasty.  The restaurant also sells $10 bottles of wine every day in the lobby.  Want to save even more?  Get a really inexpensive half or full carafe of the red house wine with dinner.  Both the sangria and the bellinis are also delicious!The food: every time we go, we get a selection of meats and cheeses from the salumeria to start out, and in fact my boyfriend always claims this is his favorite part of the meal.  They are fresh and served at the right temperature, and the accompaniments are diverse and heavenly- think cut grape salad, apricot jam, candied fruit, spicy fennel salad, and mroe.  The fondue is another frequent selection for our table, and we are practically licking the bowl by the end.  The pizzas are yummy (vegetarina is a particular favorite), and so are the polenta fries and the nutella panini.  The risotto is also a good choice.  The salads are the only thing here I don't love.Potential downsides: Quartino is usually loud and crowded.  I find that this adds to the atmosphere (a noisy, busy Italian cafe) rather than detracting from it, but if the noise bothers you, request a table upstairs.  Also, make a reservation if you want to go at a busy time!  No matter how busy it gets, though, the service is always good and thorough.Bonus tip: make friends with your server or bartender to get a free pizza card- your choice of any pizza on the menu!"
"I ordered the linguine with clams, and it was pretty good -- I really like the atmosphere of this place, which is more why I'm giving the 4 star rating.  The pasta itself was pretty good, but nothing mind-blowing.  Really good place to go out with friends and get caught up!"
"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about with this place.I've heard a lot of good things about this place, and after living here for some time finally checked it out.  We went on a Friday night, and I was smart enough to know to make reservations ahead of time, as it was definitely packed.  Next to the Giordiano's on Rush and Cheesecake Factory, this is probably the most touristy haven I've been in.  Don't expect to have a whole lot of conversation in here as the tables are tightly packed and the noise level is at a super high level.Normally, this isn't something I care about as much (I love Mia Francesca on Clark, good luck hearing anyone in there) if the food is good.  However, the food as Quartino isn't much to write home about.  We sampled a number of pasta and meat dishes, and none of them jumped out at me as anything spectacular.  I will admit that the prices are great for both the food and wine, but I would much rather shell out a little better extra for some quality food.  Bottom line, if you want to hangout with some tourists who are stopping over from Michigan Avenue and have some okay food at pretty good prices then here's your place.  Otherwise, stick to your neighborhood Italian restaurant, it's much better"
I love this place. The sangria is refreshing and the pizzas are tasty. The service is always great too.
Amazing. In every way! And free limoncello shots :)
Had a great lunch w frnds there! Delicious food and smart wine selections. Will definitely come again!
"good food, service and ambient was excellent!"
"This review will come in two parts -- a review of the food/experience (which will be presented w/ bullet points), followed by a review of our server (I think a short narrative is the best route for this portion).Part I:- slightly loud (but not horrible)- seated fairly quickly (despite the fact that it was pretty busy)- appetizers: calamari (decent; not the best I've ever had); Sicilian eggplant bruschette (tasty); veal meatballs (omg, yum!)- main dish: orecchiette (I needed a moment after my first bite; uber good)- dishes came out as they were completed (which was nice; less waiting)- desserts: coppa al banana (I've never had a banana so perfectly caramalized; biscotti = amazing); zeppole (hot Italian doughnuts with honey/dark chocolate; fan-fucking-tastic)- wine: Malbec (red from Argentina; full-bodied and superb)Part II:Our server, Zac, was one of the best servers I've ever had in my entire life. Pretty big bag to carry, but it's true. He was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable (re: the menu), funny...he's exactly what every server out there should strive to become. He gave us some wine suggestions, brought us some samples, then sat there with us while we tried them just to see our reactions. He really became a part of the experience and seeing as how he was just so super nice, we welcomed him with open arms. (Zac -- if you're reading this -- you complete me.)Finale:It took me an hour and forty minutes to walk off my dinner. I'd do it all over again, too. Shiiiiiit. SO worth it. :P"
"Fantastic dining experience (at least for an out-of-towner on a business trip).  Maybe it's not the most authentic place around, but since when is authentic more important than good?Their slogan is ""Where Wine is Cheaper Than Water"", and I think they really mean it.  If you are really into wines, you'll be able to drink your fill.  But they also have a full bar, which I took full advantage of.The menu is a little small (especially for an Italian restaurant), but I had no trouble finding something to order.  But the best part was the pizza.  A crust that's thin and crunchy (but not dry), toppings that are quality (prosciutto, mmm), and just enough sauce to taste but not overwhelm.Great place for groups, dates, casual gatherings.  The dining room is pretty loud, but I will definitely be back.PROS:- Short, but awesome menu- Very heavy emphasis on wine and cheeseCONS:- Can get pricey if you order from the bar"
"Dishes are meant to share, so make sure you and your date/table are in agreement as to what you order!  Restaurant was packed but we were quickly seated (with 2 people)."
"I ate here for dinner on a rainy night several weeks ago and the place was packed. To me, large crowds mean a restaurant has a lot to live up to (or else I begin to question all these people's judgement.) I highly recommend making a reservation in advance so you spend as little time in the crowded bar/waiting area as possible. Our table of four had a reservation but still had to wait a few minutes before we were shuffled upstairs to our tiny corner table. Although we felt claustrophobic in a small-space, high-traffic area, our waitress was attentive and kind, and most importantly, gave us genuinely great recommendations for our orders. We decided to share a bunch of different small plates, from traditional caprese salad to the cheese fondue (a must-have with apples!) and the highlight of the meal -- the clams. The clams were fresh (even though we're as far from the coast as I've ever lived) and the broth had a perfect amount of kick. And of course you have to have dessert, which at Quartino is a generous serving. It's always a good sign when they don't skimp on the important things. Now that I've had a taste, I don't question crowd of people constantly filling Quartino. In fact, they have pretty good taste."
"I stumbled upon this place while wandering the loop with a friend. Both of us had heard about it before, but neither of us had tried it. We were greeted by friendly hosts both outside the front door and just inside it. We opted to sit at a bar table, though it seemed like there were many open seats when we came in (some time between the lunch rush and the dinner rush). We planned on ordering a margherita for each of us, but our kind waitress suggested just splitting one (she was right, one pie was enough).We ordered the red house wine which is brought to the table in a carafe with unfrilly non-stemware glasses, and sold by the quarter liter (hence the name of the place). The wine was quite good, especially for the price. The pizza was very good, though the generous amount of cheese was simply American mozzarella, not the fresh mozzarella that one normally finds on margherita pizze, but the crust was on point and the sauce was noticeably better than the sauce at pricier, more hyped-up places I've been to.The pizza was good, but I can't speak to the quality of any of the other dishes since we didn't delve any further into the menu. The atmosphere and decor were really cool, and the bathrooms were very clean and have old fashioned dispensers full of powdered soap. Small touch, but I love stuff like that. Our server was great. I would definitely go again."
"This place is awesome!  Just plan ahead on the weekends, because everyone knows it."
"Went here with 15 people and had a great time without busting the bank.Its rare you can get proper attention with that many people, but they put us in our own little room and gave us 2 waiters - altho  it appeared they had other tables as well.   The place is enormous .. upstairs and downstairs and a bar .. almost too big.We ordered almost everything on the menu .. all kinds of apps, cheese, salami, olives, beet salad .. chicken, steak, some pasta dish .. pizza .. and lots of red wine.  Its hard to say what my favs were .. i liked the meat alot - salami, chicken, beef .. the pizza's .. the cheese .. things that go well with red wine. Total only came out to be $40/person .. for 3 hours.   If i had a big group i would definitely come back"
"came here for my official birthday festivities with my friends. i can't believe i waited this long before coming to check this place out! nice and central location dowtown. it gets BUSY. luckily i made a reservation for dinner. however, we still ended up waiting close to 30 minutes before we were seated. we were even early for dinner! lots of stuff on the menu. the pizzas are such a good deal, $10-11 for a pretty huge pizza. we had a party of 9 and a bunch of us broke off into smaller groups to share different things on the menu. between the 3 others that i shared with we ordered the quattro stagioni pizza, baby spinach salad, shrimp risotto, and the sea scallops. it was the perfect amount to share, a nice taste of everything. we also ordered a pitcher of the red sangria, very tasty and strong. service was great and speedy. i will definitely be back!"
"My wife and I ate here as soon as we got into Chicago on Friday night.  I had a reservation so we got right in, and were waited on momentarily.  I was a little nervous about the noise after reading all the reviews, but I did not think it was that much different than any other bustling restaurant on a Friday night.  I ordered the lemon martini to drink, and my wife ordered one of the red wine selections.  Both were good, but nothing to go crazy over.  We didn't feel like stuffing ourselves so we ordered the spinach salad with pears and burrata, a pizza (sausage, mushroom, onion), and pasta (pappardelle with braised meat sauce) to share.  There was bread and oil on the table, which was very standard.  The spinach salad was very blah.  The pears worked very nicely with the salty cheese, but it was mostly just spinach.  Next is where this place earns the five stars.  The pizza was easily one of the best pizzas either of us have ever eaten.  I have had my fair share of neopolitan pizza, and even made the lengthy trek to Ravenswood for Spacca Napoli on my last trip to Chicago.  This pizza blows that out of the water.  Perfect crust.  Nice sauce.  Great toppings and cheese.  Just the right amount of everything.  Not overloaded.  Not skimpy.  Lastly was the pasta.  Again, easily one of the best pastas I have ever had.  Perfectly cooked hand made noodles with just the right amount of melt in your mouth meat sauce.  My wife liked it as well, but probably not quite to the same level as I did.  Our bill was 58 dollars before tip for a martini, two glasses of wine, salad, a pizza, and a pasta.  VERY reasonable for downtown Chicago.  Not everything was wonderful, but when one meal gives you two dishes that are the best that you have eaten I think the place deserves five stars.  We go to Chicago a couple times a year and I try not to ever eat at the same places since Chicago is loaded with such wonderful restaurants, but I will definately be making it back here."
"It is very hard to write anything negative when eating delicious leftover pizza from Quartino!  I have been wanting to go to Quartino since I saw it featured on Check Please.  I have to say, it wasn't as loud as I had expected.I loved the Margherita Pizza!!!  The waiter recommended a Pinot Grigio which was very good.  The place was pretty busy so we just kind of started ordering stuff figuring it would all stagger out, and we could enjoy our wine.  I'm not kidding, our pizza came out 4 minutes after we ordered it, the calamari was about 2 minutes later and the pasta came out in a flash.  This was faster than the McDonald's I went to last week in Michigan!  (No Joke)So I was a little disappointed that the food wasn't timed better and that you know they have food just sitting there ready to go out out.  The gnocchi was like mush it was so overcooked.  The texture reminded me of the inside of a burnt marshmallow!  Weird!  We probably would have drank more wine had our bellys not been filled so quickly.  I think we were there for less than half an hour!  Summary:  Very good food, take your time ordering, get the pizza!  Ask the server for wine recommendations, and they have clean bathrooms (but they are upstairs)"
Food was very good! Reasonably priced and came out fast! It was nice being able to reserve a table through yelp!
"Traditional Italian Cuisine. better dining with a lot of friends, they offer small plates and you can have many dishes so that can taste a lot. Love this place."
"Crowded even at 5:30pm the place was packed, the food was okay, nothing special, the pasta was bland, it seemed to be missing something.  The Pizza was fine nothing to write home about, the service was good, but the table was small so there was not enough space for the dishes as they brought them out.  Everything else was fine ok.   The beef short ribs were good."
"I can't believe I have not written a review yet considering I have been here so many times! My first experience was with my girlfriend and we got to sit in the bar, drinks lots of yummy wine and eat amazing food. Our waiter was extremely helpful with our wine selection and in her patience with us since we tend to talk so much it takes us forever to order. First time=great experience, even better Merlot! Skipping ahead, since I have had a wonderful time here already, we decided to have my bachlorette party dinner here. One of my bridesmaids plan the whole menu (and evening) and what good taste she has! We dined on pizzas (the margherita is delicious), brushetta, meatball napoli and sliders (one of my favs), calamari, cavatelli, tortellini (another fav), any many many more, which I loved every bite! After we stuffed ourselves, I even got a giant ice cream sundae which we all had some! Our waiter was amazing and the food never stopped coming! good times, Great Friends! I have also visited Quartino and a few other occasions (the yelp event and a work event) and will continue to do so and suggest it to anyone who is looking for a good wine selection and good food and great prices. All served small plate style so it is perfect for a small or big group."
"absofreakinlutely the best italian tapas restaurant that ive ever been to, hands down!you cannot go wrong here..what can you chose from? theres too many to name but i will say that everything that ive ordered there has been phenomenol! AND! the wine!!! too good to be true...not only can you enjoy a nice glass (or two, or three...hehe) with your meal, but you can buy bottles even cases there for super cheap! this is a must go to if you come visit the city...the atmosphere is wonderful and the staff is great!**house wine with a formaggio platter! mMm~ im in heaven......"
I was shocked to see this place still packed at 10:30 at night.  The wine was tasty and reasonably priced.  I only had a bite of tortellini which tasted fresh.  The highlight was my fried calamari - lightly breaded and so tender.  It was amazing.  The caprese salad was also great - fresh tomatoes and thick slices of mozzarella.  The food came out very quickly and it seemed like we had 5 people waiting on us.
"Had way too much food here and cultivated some extreme nostalgia for my study abroad time in Italy.  The food was exactly what I would expect of a real Italian establishment, and I will definitey be back for more.House vino was perfect with the Stefano pizza (spicy sausage - for real, felt the warmth and I am no wimp, with rosemary) and my friend and I went all out with dessert.  We got some amazing combination of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry gelato with fresh fruit and hazelnuts, and while I can't completely attest to the absolute authenticity of the gelato (half of a half of a liter of wine lowering my gelato snobbery levels), I can say it was delicious and perfect to split.While it was loud and crowded, I definitely felt taken care of, with our waiter offering suggestions for food and wine and checking in on us, and the manager stopping by to chat and give us his card.  Can't beat that."
"If someone here asked me ""Come here often?"" I'd probably be more than the requisite amount of disgusted, but after a few minutes, I'd realize that the truthful answer to that question is indeed ""Why yes, yes I do.""The service here is great. And the atmosphere is classy, but still fun and not at all stuffy. The veal meatballs I've had really weren't as good as people say, and they were kind of cold. The tomato soup is pretty average (actually, it had plastic in it once, but they took it off our bill graciously). But the polenta fries are wonderful, and the scallops are well prepared. The olives are delicious and well marinated, so they are a good starter. The pizzas are probably Americanized, but they are closer to authentic Italian, at least from what I've experienced. The mushroom pizza is the best! The pasta is of course delicious, and I like the orichette (sp?) the best. Whew. That's your laundry list!"
"let's see.. the first time i came here was about 3 years ago with some of my girlfriends. perfect for girl talk, wine and food to share.the last two times i've been here was with friends from out of town. both times, my friends left very happy.drinks aren't expensive.food is meant to share, tapas style.they have pizza, seafood, pasta, meat, olives, cheese, pretty much everything on their menu!i always order calamari and everything else i've had was good.if you're a guy and you like meat, go for the short ribs!you MUST save room for dessert! every single dessert they have is to die for.location of the restaurant is in the heart of downtown chicago!so expect traffic on the street, difficult street parking (but that's what valet is for!), food and drinks come cheap!i'm not sure if quartino still has 50% off if you sit in the bar area but it's worth asking if you decide to dine here."
Interesting concept. Food just keeps coming as you order throughout your meal. Would like to go back now that I have a better idea of what and how much to order. Good food and good price.
"Holy Moly, we were in heaven. It was Thursday night around 8pm and after bar hopping in River North a little my 2 GFs and I decided on Quartino- I had never been. It was PACKED but the wait list was only about 20 minutes. We wandered to the back of the bar area and found one lone empty table and grabbed it. We immediately were greeted by our sweetheart server and filled out our antipasto card for starters. We went with some Pecorrino and Gorgonzola cheeses and some Soppresatta and Duck Proscuitto. We also ordered the LITER wine, as surely a bottle would not suffice! The space is so warm and welcoming. Even though it was very busy, it wasn't too loud and the service was exceptional. Our starter plate came with about 6-8 little dips and sauces and home made Giardinaire which rocked. We were having such fun experimenting with trying to make 'the perfect bite' with all the little ingredients.We ordered a couple of veal sliders to share which were AMAZING and tasted like someone's grandma's secret recipe. And then of course we had to get a pizza and chose the sausage which came with some crazy good roasted tomatoes and lots of fennel. I am not really a dessert person, BUT, after a big, crazy comfort-food meal like this, sometimes I go there. And I did. I went.  I let the other girls decide on something and told myself I'd just have A bite of whatever they ordered, which turned out to be deep fried donut holes with dark chocolate sauce! WHAT!?  Can you think of something more sinfully delicious? After the 2nd liter of wine I wasn't really too concerned about how many bites of it I actually had. I think it was probably 12.This was such a fun place. It was great that it was just a random choice to go here and I didn't have any expectations. I was blown away by the yum factor and great service. Perfect night with fun friends."
"For the love of Italian food, this place is everything I've ever wanted! Delicious food, ridiculously low prices, and fantastic service.  Both the tagliatere with bolognese and linguini with clams were tops that we've ever had! Soprano pizza was a treat. Cavinelli and pappardelle were extremely tasty also. Bottles of great wine for $15-40...  We'll only be in town for a few more days, but this place is worth coming back to before we head home."
"I have been wanting to dine at Quartino for who knows how long, and when my dad and brother came to visit me and wanted a nightcap/few bites before they went back to the hotel, I knew exactly where I wanted to take them. Most people talk about the food in their yelp reviews. I could explain how phenomenal the Salumeria Tasting was and that although we sat right by the kitchen and about three bachelorette parties, we were too focused on our food and laughing to notice much else. But what stood out to me was the service and hospitality of Quartinos.Being in the industry, I understand the importance of making the customer enjoy every aspect of their experience- from walking into the door to signing the bill and waving goodbye. While we were finishing our last olives and slices of cheese, a server assistant sort of bumped into my dad's chair while he was carrying dishes back to the kitchen (no big deal, dad works in the industry, too, and wasn't bothered by it). Less than 30 seconds later, our sweet waitress had a shocked look on her face while she was standing behind my dad. Um... ma'am? Apparently the SA had spilt some melted ice cream on my dad's back during the run-in and she was quick to wipe it off my dad, then to clean up the floor around the table. I couldn't count how many times she asked if he was alright and how sorry she was. To make the experience more entertaining, she then offered to buy our dessert since someone else's had been spilt on us. Sweet. So we got our menus and began to look over. Then the manager came out and apologized as well, then gave us his card if we need anything (like therapy or a massage to deal with the stress of our meal).. Now that was unnecessary but really showed that they wanted to make sure we were happy customers and enjoyed the rest of our evening. I'm already in the neighborhood enough as it is, and I will be sure to be back as soon as I get another free weekend and hopefully a table on that heavenly patio opens up :)PS- SAVE ROOM FOR THE ITALIAN DONUTS. OH. MY GOD."
"Loved it!I loved the food, the sangria, the free dessert from our waiter, and the atmosphere.Perfect spot for a date. You get to try a bunch of new things (the first time I've ever had duck!) over a glass of wine, and with what felt like your own private waiter. Great service!"
"The end of the month wine tasting?  Yes.The pizza?  Yes.The cheap wine?  Definitely yes.The service?  meh...not bad but not great.  Due to ginormous crowds.My main reason for not going to Quartino more often is that EVERYONE goes to Quartino too often.  It's crazy crowded and the food is relatively cheap (do pizza and small plates) and tasty.  And then there is my savior, the vino.  After a night at Quartino, I have to go off the bottle for a bit for personal rehab.I'd prefer it a bit less crowded and loony, but it's a good spot, especially in the location it's in."
"Not a fan of this place at all. Went here for my mother's b-day hoping for a fun family style meal but unfortunately it was not an enjoyable evening. The service was fine but we literally couldn't hear anything  the other was saying the place was sooo loud. We seriously could not hold a conversation, it was horrible.  We ordering one of everything of the small plate items and no one was impressed, and most of it all went back uneaten. We ended up just ordering some pizzas as a last resort so everyone didn't  leave hungry.Too loud and food is at times inedible. Won't be going back!!!"
"ate here about a month ago with a group of about 15 people. Food was great, i personally enjoyed the penne alla vodka and the pizza. the wine was flowing and they took great care of us."
Great service. Good wine. But skip the spaghetti arrabiata.
"Not really a fan of their food. I find to have this same problem with a lot of restaurants in this area of Chicago. More about the ""scene"" and not the food. Eh."
"Get the polenta fries and their mushroom risotto. The tagliatelle is very good as well. The only thing that bothered me is one time the manager came to our table at the end of our meal and was extremely cordial, only to come back 2 minutes later and ask us to leave. Interesting tactic...kinda down on Quartino now."
"This place is a true gem. We enjoy coming here, any chance we get. If you have not tried it, you should. There are far worse places and few better to eat. The atmosphere is clever and the service is genuine. The food was a pleasure to consume. If you are unsure what to eat, try a lot of different dishes. You'll enjoy it."
This just may be in the top 3 of favorite restaurants of all time for me.  I dream about the risotto.  Small plates allows you to try everything.
"Delicious food, vibrant environment. Please get rid of the TVs, though."
"We were very happy that we found this place. They were very flexible and made pasta for my kid, and did two kinds of pizza on one ( half and half). The waiter was very helpful and made sure we were happy with the food. We like to go back and highly recommend this restaurant."
"I don't eat meat or dairy (It's called veganism) so when my sister came into town with her friends they all wanted to eat down in the Loop.   I tried to get them over to Little Italy for Tufano's but it was no go cause I couldn't remember how to spell the damn name or at least well enough for the information operator to find it in the listings.So we ran across a sweet Italian cashier in the soap store Savon who advised us to try Quartino's.  She said she's from a big Italian family and if it's good enough for her we might like it.  And like it we did.  Luckily we made reservations.  Upon arrival were we glad.  It was standing room only at the bar and every square foot of the eatery was packed with a chair and a butt squarely on it.  However, the reservation line is very orderly and we were seated exactly at 8pm.  The Din from the happy conversations was not deafening but gave the dinner a lively cheeriness that made you feel like you were a part of something right and good.We ordered a Carafe of wine and shared some appetizers.  Try the olives and beet salad.  The wait staff was on fire that night and the amazing clockwork rhythm of their motions was hypnotic.  But I was worried as vegans always are.  I was worried that my questions about the food ingredients would not go over well with our waitress.  I could not have been more wrong.  She broke down the pasta and made special requests to the staff which were followed perfectly and not a hint of annoyance.  Really top notch.The food was great.  My sister and her friends had a wonderful time and I have a new place to bring my stubborn, unhealthy, non eco-friendly relatives and friends.  Blurg."
"I first experiences Quartino on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday.  We had reservations for 10 people and were seated as soon as everyone arrived.The waitstaff is exceptional.  Really. They took the time to explain everything to us (sometimes twice, since everyone else in  the restaurant was talking so loudly you couldn't always hear on the other end of the  table).The food was outstanding.  For 10 people, we ended up ordering a ton of dishes and just going around the table. The pro: you got to try a little of everything; the con: you only got to try a little of everything.  Our waiter was awesome and let us split the bill between all of our credit cards.  Definitely nice to not have to count cash.There were 2 bachelorette parties there the night we were there.  It's definitely a ""hot spot"".  I am looking forward to going back."
"I'm not sure why I haven't written a review yet. This is a great place to go when you're really NOT sure where to go. They have great crispy pizzas that are so tasty: my faves are the sausage fennel pizza and the duck prosciutto with arugala pizza. The pastas are amazingly fresh and delicious, never too overpowering which is something I don't like about Italian food sometimes. The risottos are pretty good too. And you must order veal meatballs! Everything is share-able and you SHOULD share because you'll want to try everything."
"Quartino's is a fun spot in the River North area, ideal for large groups or others who don't mind how loud it gets in there. The food is good, the wine is better. Plus, at least for this San Franciscan, everything is really cheap!! More on that later...The small plates aspect is my favorite part of the dining experience here. Who doesn't love trying several different things? Its a good insurance policy as well in case you come with picky eaters or if any one of the dishes fails to deliver.We ordered:- caprese salad, which was very good! even though tomatoes aren't yet in season- fettucini, which comes with a red sauce, parmesan and whole cherry tomatoes that melt in your mouth. very good!- polenta fries, which were a bit bland and came out so hot that we had to wait several minutes before trying them.- walnut, pear and gorgonzola pizza, which was good but could have been so much better if they added arugula or spinach at the very end. Somebody tell the chef!- these fried doughnut things for dessert. They were tasty. We tried them with the side of chocolate but I think next time I'd go with the honey, which would better compliment the delicate flavor of the doughnut.Overall, the dining experience was pretty good. I did really like the decor and feel of the restaurant, which achieves an excellent classy-modern-antique feel that goes very well with Italian food. I was most taken with the prices, which are very reasonable for a good meal. A 1/4 carafe (a bit more than a typical glass of wine) of the house red or white is just $4. Steal! And the total bill for three somewhat hungry people, including 1 drink and a dessert, was just $45."
"I love this place. Wine by the carafe allowed my wife and I to sample three different wines (and have more than one glass of each) and it was very affordable. The food was great. We loved their pizzas and the pasta bolognese (sp?) was excellent. The ""build-your-own"" antipasto platter was great, as well. We had the olive assortment and loved them all. The Gorgonzola was excellent with it's accompaniments (chopped fennel, apricot marmalade and sliced grapes). As for ambiance, it more than met my wife's requirements: we must not be the only people in the restaurant. This was my second visit and both times the place was packed. Beautiful tin ceilings, rich woodwork and open kitchen add to the charm."
"I was really please with my experience here. I went on a Saturday evening, it was insanely packed but I was able to get a spot at the bar right away. I started with a glass of white sangria, it was some of the best I've had, it was a little on the weak side but for only $5/glass you can't really complain too much. I had the roasted beets as an appetizer, they were delicious and a wonderful choice for a lite starter. I was lucky enough to be the recipient of a server error and got some complimentary  asparagus risotto. It was prepared perfectly and tasted really nice. I couldn't imagine ordering that for my entree but it's plenty to split as a side with a friend, it's very rich and filling. I had a half order of the Cavatelli. There's no mention of half orders on the menu but thanks to the fantastic bartender he let me in on the little secret. It was the perfect size and very delicious. The pasta was a little chewy but nothing that would ruin the dish. Fast friendly service and will definitely be back on my next visit to Chicago."
"The food was amazing and filling for being ""small plate"".  It's a very cute atmosphere, but gets very crowded so I would definitely make a reservation if you want to be seated right away."
"I've been here twice and both times the food was fab, and our waiter was attentive, informative, and fun. He suggested the house red as a good, cheap wine and he was right. All the food was delish. I know the Copa al Banana is the fan fave (as our waiter said, the caramelized banana is ""where the magic is"") but I love lemon and I looooooved the lemon gelato in the ""panino. ""We were there on our way to the theater and the dinner crowd really hadn't started to come in so noise and people weren't an issue. And although we ordered a lot of food and wine, the bill was surprisingly reasonable."
"Very good!  When it's good weather, it is worth the wait to sit outside.  Good prices on wine and martinis are good too.  It's nice to get something to share."
"I really like this place. Cool decor, bustling energy, good location and good food. I would recommend for a group of friends going out to dinner, not for a date night."
"After I posted the above review, I got a Yelp message from the manager (or from someone purporting to be the manager).  The tone of his e-mail was sincere, and he wanted to know how to make it right for me and the people who suffered through that night at Quartino's months ago.I did not respond, because I don't think I want to eat there again, but I really, sincerely appreciate his efforts to address our dissatisfaction.  I thought that deserved an additional one-half of one star.The other additional half-star was for a couple weeks ago, when I went to  Quartino's bar.  I know, I know, why would I, the guy who felt wronged to my soul by this place, go back, even if only to the bar portion.  Well, I had two friends in from New York.  Their work put them up in a hotel a block away from Quartino's.  It was late.  Quartino's was close.  It was late.  Did I mention we had no time to venture out of that polished carnival mag mile area? Anyway, we wound up belly up to Quartino's bar, the place wasn't crowded at that hour, and we were able to have a few good beers.  My friends liked the Goose Island, and enjoyed that with every new beer, the bartender got a new frosted glass from the freezer. I have to admit, that was classy.Oh, and I could almost give them another star for giving the bathroom attendant the night off."
"I thought the pizza was pretty good, and the roasted peppers were delicious, but it gets way too crowded like other yelpers have said.  Would I come back here? 3 stars = maybe.."
"so.  Quartino's is a fabulous place for a big group....we had 12.the place is big, loud and has an extensive menu that can please just about anyone.  We had tons of wine and cocktails and started out with two of the cheese/charcutterie platters....they came with ample salume, parmesan, prosciutto, blue cheese, olives, capiccola, grapes, etc etc.then it was basically and ordering free for all.  One of my person pet peeves is when stuff just comes out at random - and this seems to be quartinos specialty.  the food was a-ok, nothing to write home about....but it kept a comin and satisfied everyone at the table.  we also had a little glass of limoncello to finish off dinner and that may have been the culinary highlight!i wouldnt recommend this spot for a date or anything like that, but for a big group that isn't too critical of service or timing, quartinos is great - cheap and you pretty much know what you're getting into."
Perfect summer evening outside dining.  House wine affordable and delicious.  Tapas sized dishes were excellent.  Pizza was meh.Have fun and go outside!  Loved it.
"I never knew there was such a thing as Italian tapas! I went here with some co-workers and had quite the dining experience. Since there was so many of us we ordered several things off the menu and shared. A couple of my favorites included: Polenta fries, Sausage pizza, scallops and mushroom risotto. And I can't forget to include the yummy desserts- the italian doughnuts and the chocolate fondue with strawberries. MMmmmm MMmmm good. The food was good, but I wouldn't say it was the best italian food I've had. I do think it's a great place to come with a big group- You can order and share so much food and feel satisfied! The atmosphere was loud and lively.. oh and I can't forget they have a great selection of wine. Quartinos is the place to Eat, Drink. and be Merry!"
"This is a great place to go with smaller parties of 3 or 4, great food, good wine, and not too pricey for the caliber of quality you will receive at Quartino.  We (group of 3) sat near the middle of the room and the place was somewhat sparse for 6 pm on a weeknight.  However, I felt like our waiter and corresponding staff were rushing us and were almost too quick with the food.  Later into our meal I could see why, the staff felt the impending storm and by the time we were finished the place was packed.We had the caprese salad, some pasta, and the Margherita pizza, in addition to a mushroom brochette appetizer.  I'm happy we chose the pizza as the rest of the meal was rather small, but it all was very good.  The wine is great, they have options for the wealthy patrons and those who jump on the cheapest ship.  It's a bit noisy and might not be the best for a date, but definitely recommendable for larger parties."
"Quite a noisy environment.  But if you like to try a little bit of everything, this is the place. We ordered the clam linguine and bone marrow, which were both great.  Friendly staff and good food."
"Oh Quartino! You will always hold a special place in my heart AND stomach! My boyfriend and I went here on a our first date and continually come back for special occasions or the just because meal! We LOVE it here! We've ordered almost everything off of the menu! We usually start off with some cheeses. olives and prosciutto and then share a pasta, polenta fries or pizza. The only thing I have to say I didn't like here was the veal meatballs. He loves them, but I just wasn't the biggest fan. The fondue is SOOO good, the salads are all very fresh and tasty, the pizza's are super thin, which I love and the variety is fun to choose from, the pastas are all very good! This place is just all and all an amazing restaurant and one that we will continue to come back to time and time again! The wine list is amazing as well, and it is very reasonably priced! The last time we were in here, they actually offered to package the half bottle of wine we couldn't finish to take home with us! I love the energy of this place as well, it is very lively and the place is always packed! If you dint like a lot of noise you wont like this restaurant ;) However, this is a great place for a date, special occasion, group event or just to stop in a have a great meal at a very reasonable price!"
"Completely blah experience.  The cheese fondue was awesome, and the wine rather cheap.  Besides that, Quartino was forgetable.  The pizza sucked.  The seared tuna was weird (the sauce didn't seem to go well with the fish, and the fish kinda sucked too).  The service was spotty, and the dining room the loudest I've ever experienced.  I'll probably be back to see if I can find some redeeming items on the menu to go with the fondue and vino.  Or just for vino.  Taint nothing wrong with that."
"Had eggplant with cheese,Clam linguini,pork with apple,duck confit,minestrone soup.  All was extremely delicious besides minestrone which was kinda bland.  I know now why this place was bustling and had a 30 min wait time on a Tuesday night."
"Quartino's is one of my favorite places in the city that I don't visit enough.  I've been here for date nights, group dinners, and girl's night outs, and each option works here!  I agree that the margarita pizza is pretty awesome.  I would also recommend the fondue because you get a lot of cheese, it's easy to share, and they will bring extra bread if you ask.  They used to have the most incredible asparagus risotto, but I don't think they have it anymore.  If you ever see it, you must order it as you will turn into an asparagus lover instead of a hater.Great place to go on the weekend.  There will be a wait so just grab a drink at the bar, relax, and enjoy!"
"The tre color salad, orrieche, eggplant, and short ribs are excellent. Wine is limited to Italian selections, but cheap and good. Service attentive. Conversation level is loud and the tables are close together, so it's difficult to focus and not evesdrop. Overall, I would go back for the food."
"I would give Quartino 3 stars for the food, but am upping my overall rating to 4 stars because:1) It's great for groups2) Tapas / shared plates- super easy and fun3) Valet!4) BYOB5) Fun atmosphere"
"The two stars are given for atmosphere and convenient location - that is it.The sausage risotto had slight traces of sausage, barely noticeable. And the spinach and tomato pizza was practically a Jack's Pizza with a bag of spinach dumped on top (try at home not bad way to spice up Jack's but not restaurant quality at all).Our service was below average. Can't remember the last time a bottle of wine was brought to the table and left for us to pour ourselves, even BYOB places pour it for you."
"Summary: Bad... bad food, wine, and service.Would go here again? NoAte with a group of 4 others at Quartino recently, and was very disappointed because I had heard good things. The food at quartino is slightly more inventive but of equal quality of something you would get at Olive garden. The malbec we ordered tasted like it was a boxed wine and lacked any dimension (could have been a bad wine selection, but I haven't met many malbecs I didn't enjoy). It was so loud on the 2nd floor that I couldn't hear the person sitting directly next to me, let a lone across the table. The highlight was the Pappardelle with the braised beef sauce, by far the best dish.Our server was very busy, but it took a really long time to get our wine in the beginning, and after a busser cleared all of our silverware in between courses, dishes were delivered and no one at the table had any silverware."
"I've only been here once, but they have a very decent white wine bottle for $12! I believe they make all their own wines, and the one we had was very good!  The portions are smaller & made for sharing, but are definitely enough to fill you up without stuffing you  to the point where you can't move! (which most Italian places do)  Didn't get dessert, but they had a chocolate mousse thing in a martini glass that looked fantastic!Definitely going again!"
"10 of us we were there for a family celebration and had a terrific time.  A wonderful selection of food, drink and desserts.  Small plate choices made everyone happy with choices from pizza to clams, beef and a variety of appetizers.  Matt, I believe one of the managers, was extremely attentive and made sure we were well taken care of.  Our server, Roberto, was excellent...food kept coming and our glasses were full.  It was difficult, but we did manage to try a few desserts and finish it off with a glass of lemoncello.  What a memorable night!!!"
"Went for an in-between lunch and dinner. Got a great table outside. Dirty martini was fabulous. Service was great. I got the roasted red peppers and cheese and really liked it.  Hubby got the brushetta, which he liked but said the bread was a bit hard. Overall, was great and will go back!"
"My favorite Italian go-to! The perfect meal consists of: Drink--A bubbly peach belliniAppetizers--A bowl of mussels in an amazing white wine broth, crunchy calamari with dipMain dishes--Signature cavatelli--house-made pasta knobs in a fresh tomato sauce with flavorful basil and ricotta. Thin crust spinach and cheese pizza. Desert--This was a special so I don't know if they have it anymore, but the warm apple fritter which was almost like large onion rings but with apples inside, sprinkled in sugar and cinnamon and paired with their house gelato. All for around $50-ish for two people, last time I checked. The ingredients are fresh and the ambience is lively. Also a great place to check out some of the city's trendy young things on the weekends before moving on to River North clubs!"
Each small plate was excellent and bursting with flavor.  This restaurant has a nice European ambiance except for it's size!
We started at the bar and had the calamari.  We all agreed it was the worst calamari we've ever had -- very bland and rubbery.   Glad we started at the bar because we were able to leave before paying for more dishes.   The restaurant looked promising though so I would consider coming back and trying other dishes
"This review was a fight because my wife liked this restaurant while I hated.  She like it because the food and wine were both tasty and inexpensive.  I hated it because of the white tile floors, walls, and ceiling made me feel like I was in a bathroom ala the scene in the Godfather where Mike takes out the Turk (he's good with the knife) and the Captain...just add 1,000 inappropriately dressed tourists.  But, we did like their cheese selection and fondue."
"First and foremost, fantastic wine and so cheap!!! The tapas theme is so trendy right now, and Quartino gets it right. The pizza was fantastic and I also loved the salmon, the scallops and the mussels. The service impressed me--even though it was so busy while we were there, our waiter attended to our every need. My only complaint is that it was very loud in there and not very easy to talk to anyone but the person sitting next to you. Quartino is a must!"
Great vibe. Good food w interesting flavors.  The gorgonzola was to die for.
"good food and a great atmosphere.Took our family of four here while on vacation. everyone found something that interested them.  All food comes out in family style, dish by dish. Not all at once.  It was great for us.  We had a really good pork shank, short ribs and a pasta dish.  The shrimp dish missed.  Appetizers were good.They were playing old Italian movies on the screens, that just completed the experience.  Great fun for allBe aware that it is very noisy and a fun atmosphere.  Also, tables are close together.  worked fun for our family, but could see others put off by this."
"Quartino, I wanted to love you like my friend Sam loves you. Really, I did.But I've had too much good pizza since I moved to Chicago. From the Neapolitan-style pizza in my neighborhood to just about any deep-dish variety I've tried so far, you fell in the middle for crust and the bottom for taste.Actually, I might even like Domino's better than the pizza I had here.I should clarify that I came here on a numbingly cold Sunday morning in January, when the restaurant (the whole city, really) was nearly dead. This could work for or against the restaurant, I guess, but I didn't really get the loud and bustling Quartino most people do.Our service was attentive, to say the least. She went through her welcome spiel, explained how the menus worked and revisited our table no fewer than five times before I was actually ready to order. To start, I got the extremely bizarre spinach salad with ricotta salata and some very underripe pears. Maybe I'm just used to a nicer cheese on a spinach salad, but the combination of ingredients was just plain gross.My friend and I split the Quattro Formaggi pizza. Underwhelming. It made me sad, truly.The food deserves only two stars for now, but I'll offer up half a star for beautiful decor (all white and wood, with gorgeous old tile floors and antique mirrors everywhere) and half for the wonderful bartender who gladly fixed me a mimosa when I wandered in from the cold, craving a little ""breakfast"" before I hit my lunch stride. He was trying very hard to make conversation with a German man who spoke little English and was already into his second beer by the time his pizza came. Cheers to him.I shall return, Quartino. When I can drink again. Because without wine, things do not seem to go as well."
"1) reasonably priced for where it is2) a good family-style serving style3) tasty italian food with some things you haven't seen before (polenta fries)4) good service5) and now that it's warm there is lovely outdoor seating6) they have mis-matched silverware and napkins, which rules"
"LOVE.  If there was a place like this in Boston, I'd live there.  Four dollars for a quarter-carafe of decent wine??  That alone gets five stars!My brother and I ordered the Sicilian olives and Fontina from the salumeria, both of which were great and the presentation of the cheese was particularly good (served with slices of bread, sliced grapes, apricot puree, and some sort of chopped onion spread).  The entrees were just as tasty: a creamy asparagus risotto and tagliatelle bolognese.  By that time, I was comfortably full, so I stuck with a scoop of lemon gelato for dessert (a no fail most places), but my brother got a banana and chocolate dessert that looked (and, according to him, was) amazing.Our waitress was friendly and everything came out fairly quickly.  The prices weren't bad at all for what we had.  I have to say, I have had better Italian food, but with the ambiance, WINE, and authenticity...I had to give it five stars."
If you wear a white shirt and you order chicken be sure to not spray the juices all over yourself.  It can be embarrassing especially if you're with clients.  This place was great other than my messiness.  I was on a low carb kick when I went here and an Italian place can be difficult if you're not eating carbs.  They made a special dish for me and it was spectacular.  I need to go back here!
Really great food and service. The Alfredo dish was great as well as gnocchi. The pizza wasn't very good. Not a great place for 2 people but great for a big group!
"Visiting from LA...this place is amazing!!Great food, good ambiance, nice service and a good variety of wines.Would rec. making a reservation!"
"One of the BEST places in Chicago.Italian tapas done to perfection.Favorites: The bread with olive oil and tons of parmesan cheese, Veal meatballs, thin crust pizzas and the wine.Go here. It's heavenly. Not much else to say. It's the best."
"I may be biased because I live down the street but I like Quartinos.  A quick pizza, some pasta, and a little dessert hits the spot each time.  And when it's freezing out, it's great to have reliable and consistent spot in the neighborhood."
"This is not the typical Italian food that you come to expect, nothing is really smothered in heavy cheese or red sauce...but with that said, the food was amazing, the service staff was helpful, polite and prompt, and the atmosphere added to the experience.  We went on a Tuesday night and didn't have to wait to be seated.We went in celebration of my birthday, had Bellini's, wine, olives, dinner and dessert- and I cannot think of a single criticism. Perhaps my best Italian dining experience outside of Italy. I definitely plan to return soon...and I highly recommend: the polenta fries, the Bellini's, the pizzas are amazing, and the Italian donuts!"
"Nummy, nummy, num, num, num! Yep, that describes my experience at Quartino. Went there today for lunch and had a fun time tasting the different yummy stuff on the menu. We ordered the Pepperoni Pizza right off the bat for the timid food taster in our group. We then had fun picking and choosing other items from the menu. White Bean Spread....lordy was that ever good. Angus Beef Carpaccio...mm, pretty good. The Parma and the BLT Panini's. Those were okay...wasn't crazy about the buns they were on. The Gnocchi...ooo like soft little pillows with all kinds of happy flavors going on. The Duck Prosciutto...oh yeah, baby you bet your sweet arse that was good. Dessert we ordered the Copa Al Banana....yum!!!! Gelato, caramelized banana, chocolate sauce, whipped cream and biscotti. Wow! That was definitely a good time in my mouth. We also ordered the Italian donuts which were okay.All and all I loved my experience at Quartino's. It was fun tasting so many different flavors and such a great place to go with a group. I definitely want to go back and try their dinner menu sometime soon!"
"My husband and I were staying in the downtown area or a conference, and we decided to check out Quartino's, which was a half block from our hotel. It's a small plates ""tapas"" restaurant, with great ambiance and food. It was very crowded-always a good sign-and there was a wait to be seated (about 20 minutes, that's after 9:30 pm). The house white was good, and we shared the baby spinach salad (dripped with a honey dressing), gnocchi (my husband's choice-he loved it), and lasagna (pretty good). All in all, a great romantic meal."
Have been going there for the last few years. Never disappoints. The food is simple but delicious
Great for a group dinner - definitely get some of the pizzas. We had excellent service and the wait staff was very responsive. It was a little loud but that might be because there was another group nearby. I will definitely return.
"Great antipasto in a fun, loud, vibrant atmosphere.  I had a great time, the service was admirable.  It was very crowed but we were seated quickly and we  were served quickly. We just ordered the antipasto assortment and got some meats, cheeses and other various accompaniments and a couple hot tapas plates which was the perfect amount for two people.  There are a lot of people in there and the seating is tight so your girlfriend will have some fine opportunity to eavesdrop on a conversation or two and then comment on it to you like you were doing the same thing but all you were really thinking was that you wanted that last bite of goat cheese before she clawed it up."
"It's easy to go overboard here.Came recently with a large group for dinner and I'm confident that we ordered at least 50% of the menu in duplicate quantities.  There were 4 antipasti meat platters, 3 salads, 4 pizzas, 2 risottos, fondue, meatballs, gnocchi, shrimp, lamb, and probably a few other things that I didn't even notice.Oh, and lots of wine.From my two visits here, standout items have been the risottos (there was an asparagus risotto on the menu before that was super but it's not  currently available) and the gnocchi.  What I like about Quartino is the small plates approach since, as a non-meat eater, I can easily share items and order my own things as well (they have quite a few veggie pizzas and pastas on the menu).  There is a lively, welcoming atmosphere at Quartino and it's a great place to come with a large group - it can definitely get noisy here."
"What I love about Quartino is the variation. You can wear jeans or dress up, and they'll have something on the menu for whatever you're craving. The asparagus risotto and pizzas are notable, and the cheese and meat selections are delicious. The service can be spotty when it's busy, but they're quick to clear the dishes as they pile up, and the tapas comes out quickly as well. The prices vs quantity can be a little hit or miss, with the wine prices being fairly exorbitant. The pizza and tapas are a bit more manageable, especially the pizzas as they are all very yummy. The chocolate fondue is delicious, but $4 plate of dipping fruit each seemed steep for the amount we got. It's a good lunch and dinner place, great for dates and just a casual night out but I would not recommend it for a private party unless you can do a by-the-menu order, or set plates of food. The tapas buffet was excellent as far as the quality and taste of the food went, but was overpriced by.... well, a lot. A lot. The service is good, friendly and attentive. The environment is lively so it can be a little loud at times but you'll be ok."
"Oh, Quartino!...How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...is it the wonderful wine?...the short ribs that melt in your mouth?...or is it the potato puree...the broccoli rabe...or maybe the warm chocolate cake?...perhaps it's the staff...the managers Nick and Tony...Dan...server par excellence...and then there's Andrea...I can't pin it down. All I know is that you're wonderful!"
Quartino is a nice mix between a casual and fancy restaurant. It's an accommodating indoor seating area and a great outdoor seating area in the summer right in the middle of downtown. Great place for a first date or a 50th anniversary. Recommend getting the thin crust pizza if you want a break from the heavy deep dish pizzas of Chicago.
"Went here for the wine tasting last night and it was fantastic!  $20 gets you all you can drink of the 4 different wines of their choosing (2 white, 2 red) and then tons and tons of appetizers (cheese, meat, spreads, bread, various sides and they are also passing pizzas around).  Great place, great price, good times!"
This place is fantastic. Very busy though. Make a reservation if you want to go at any normal dinner time. Tons of wine options (both selection and serving size). Go with a larger group and you can try a lot of different things! Not too pricey either.
"I LOVE quartino!  Went here to celebrate my hubby's birthday and everything was so affordable.  A bottle of wine was $25, small and large dishes ranged from $3 to $10 bucks.  Got a huge, delish Tiramisu for $8.  Would def. come again!"
"first of all, they didn't seat us after we arrive on time though we had a reservation. they still go With first come first served. so what's the point of making a reservation? Then, good is just ok-- super noisy. Wouldn't recommend."
"I don't give one star reviews often (if ever), but I do when my food doesn't come for 45 minutes and the server tells me ""uh, it'll come when it's made"".I had been to Quartino's many times before and always had a mediocre (non-review-worthy) experience.  But most recently, it was horrible.We had to ask for bread 3 times before it came.  Our food came out very late and the pizza was basically burnt.  Our server gave us a lot of attitude.  Our second wine order was so slow that it came out with the check.The food is overpriced for its quality; the atmosphere is loud and stressful; and the service is abysmal.The whole situation was just a disaster and I am never coming back again."
"Yum!  Cheap wine, sharable portions--what a fun, fun concept!I will agree with others that the set-up in the restaurant could be better (it gets tight and you run the risk of being bumped) and it is incredibly loud inside.  However, there is a lovely patio that is nice for people-watching out front on nice days.I came here with my aunt on a weeknight and it was packed.  We didn't have to wait for a table, but still...very crowded.  We shared a 1/2 carafe of wine (very reasonably priced and so, so good), split the spinach salad, some pasta with meat sauce (tagliateelle alla bolognese) that was divine, and a pizza with veggies on it (quatro stagioni)...plenty of food for the two of us, and I took home most of the pizza.I will definitely be back for the cheap, delicious wine and good food, probably to enjoy a nice day on their patio."
"This was probably the meal I enjoyed the most during my time in Chicago (granted, I didn't go anywhere that fancy, but still.)  The menu and the restaurant itself reminded me of some places back home in NY.Pros:- Prosciutto- Brocolli rabe- Baby octopus- Fusilli with a sort of spicy puttanesca sauce- Reasonably priced food and wine- Friendly waiterCons:- Calamari salad (The calamari was sort of tough.)- Loud as all hell"
great with a big group- great food too!
"Let's start with the desserts, because they are decadent and they've got my favorite profiteroles. I have tried several desserts here and the majority of them are delicious. The zeppolis(Italian donuts) are remeniscent of beignets, but denser.Quartino is a great place to go with a group. The plates are about small to medium size. The pizzas, meatballs, sausage risotto, angus beef steak, and desserts are all delicious. The prices are really great too."
"House-Made Burrata with Roasted Beets Salad was good. The Burrata (mozarella cheese ball with creamy middle) was a nice compliment to the beets and greens. Great recommendation from server to order two 1/2 portions of the two entrees I couldn't decide between. Ravioli Filled with Braised Pork, Speck, & Fava Beans , and the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - Tuscan Pasta Ribbons with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce. The ravioli was good, but was really enhaced by the Speck (prosciutto). Braised beef tomoato sauce was excellent. Pure comfort food. Tried the tiramisu (another half order suggestion from server which was perfect size). The dessert was underwhelming as the lady fingers were missing a soaking with espresso (or coffee) and rum, and the topping was dusted exclusively with and too much cocoa power (should have chocolate shavings). I gave honest feedback to my server, and although I didn't ask for it she removed it from my bill. A nice gesture which she got back in her tip. Overall the bill was $37 including wine, so a nice value. Quite loud inside."
"Do you like to snack?  Have a little wine?  Snack some more?  Order some more?  Be OK in a loud place?  Well Quartino is your place then!    I like the concept of being able to pick out your own antipasto plate for an appetizer. So you pick your meat, cheese, olives, maybe some roasted red peppers...the whole shebang.  And then ontop of it all, you also get little jams, pickled veggies and other little dressings and dips for your whole antipasto plate experience.  I could go for different kind of crostini bread for it? Onto entrees, you could pick a pasta / pizza / salad and all do family style with it.  It does suck if you are only with two people and you get a 2-top for a table.  If they try to sit you at one of those, ask to be moved.  You will not be happy with trying to balance all your plates on a small table!  I really like all their pastas and salads, their pizzas are the thin and crispy variety.  Order their wine by the carafes too. Not sure why it is so great to have wine this way and have those little tumblers to drink your vino from.... but I like it!  Sign me up!  They have lots of italian wines that you can actually purchase by the bottle at 50% off their rack pricing for you to take home too.  Delicious!"
"Quartino's serves consistently good (not amazing) food.  If I were to judge the food and ambience alone, I would probably give this place 3 stars.  However, my extra star is for the sidewalk patio.  It's still one of my favorite alfresco spots in Chicago.  Notably, however, the outdoor seating is first come, first serve and the wait can be up to an hour.  Luckily, you're always welcome to split a bottle of wine (their house wine is inexpensive and tasty) or a carafe of sangria at their bar which also offers open seating.  Definitely not my first choice for Italian food, unless its the summer and I'm in the mood to dine outside!"
"1) If you don't have reservations, good luck. There system is definitely Grand Lux Cafe style, where you ask how long the wait is and you're told 3 hours. 2) Even if you do have a reservation, good luck. My friends and I waited a half an hour before being seated, and the lobby is so jam packed that I was repeatedly squeezed by more people than I cared for.3) Food...ehhh. My risotto was undercooked and very heavy. My friend's pasta dish had so much cheese on it that it looked like a casserole. 4) Oh my god it is so cramped! I thought the lobby was bad but seriously, the tables couldn't be closer together. Being elbowed by an old gentleman while you're eating does not a pleasant dining experience make.5) The manager was nice enough to bring me a dessert for my birthday, but I think it was only because he was hard-core hitting on my friend. Better bets: Oysy (for sushi). Volare (for Italian). Both are fairly close to Quartino, and at either place you won't be tempted to punch anyone."
I went to dinner here with a party of 17 people.  The service was awesome and their small plates were perfect to allow us all to try different things.  We had a ton of wine and I was stuffed with great food all for about $40 a piece. I would definitely recommend for a large party of people.
"They serve pretty decent family- and tapas-style Italian fare. Do follow yelpers' recommendations on specific dishes tho' (wish I did, but it was a last-minute decision). This place is best for large groups.Friends and I (group of six) was there tonight (Sunday). We were seated very quickly, in a corner kinda tucked away from the rest of the restaurant, which was nice and homey. Service was prompt and nothing to complain about. Noise level was close to ideal for conversation: everybody could hear each other without being conscious of our neighbors.We ordered quite a few ""tapas."" My favorite dishes are the polenta fries which was really good with the sweet red sauce, and the roasted baby octopus, succulent and flavorful.We also had the assorted spuntini: peppers, calamari and artichoke. The calamari and peppers were good. The artichoke was a bit too tart for my tongue.Our neighbors had a ""salumera tasting"" (assortment of cured meat, cheeses, and pickled stuff) and it looked really good, so we ordered it as well. We got salami and duck proscuitto for the meat, provolone and something similar to parmesan for the cheese, three types of olive and a couple of other small sides. It costs $25, the most expensive dish of the night. The prosciutto and cheese were good. The rest was a disappointment.I was excited to see that they serve neapolitan pizza. They didn't have Prosciutto e Rucola so we ordered the margherita with prosciutto, a $3 add-on. The topping was pretty good tho' I could use more basil. The crust is not worth mentioning. I've had extraordinary neapolitan pizza at Spacca Napoli, and this one was anything but.I ordered a Mojito. This sad little thing costs $9. Cut the Bacardi, add more mint, and I'll be a much happier person.The dinner costs $20 per person, pretty cheap for this neighborhood. Everyone was full, tho' by the time I got home I was looking for munchies again - but that's just me. If you have a group of four or more, this is a pretty nice place to sample the Italian tastes.If you're driving, street parking is near impossible. Valet is $10."
"quartino ... why yes, why thank you... i was pleased and i was most definitely happy...eating at quartino has this feeling of eating in italy! the whole setup, from the patio dining to the french doors and more... the ambience? can't be beat!quartino: italian tapas FO SHO! :Dwhen one thinks of quartino, i think, EXCELLENCE! in service, in quality, and in food! for you wine lovers, you will be NOT*, NOT* be disappointed.. extensive is the perfect word for it...  as for food, prices were fairly appropriate ranging from $9 (pastas) and up... tapas $10 and up, you get the picture...definitely a great place to come on a date or not (semi casual) or whether it be kid friendly, quartino is it! :D"
This place was great.  I cannot wait to go back and try even more of their delicious plates.  The red sangria was superb!
"Been here several times including the Yelp event. Was here on Saturday night with some out of towners. Our server was awesome. The carafe of wine is the only way to go. It's closer to 1.5 bottles of wine.As usual food was great. Some highlights:FUNGHI NEOPOLITAN PIZZE- ROASTED MUSHROOMS, CRUSHED TOMATOES, AND MOZZARELLATUSCAN SAUSAGE RISOTTO -WITH TOMATOES AND FRESH PEASVEAL MEATBALL SLIDER WITH POMODORO AND GIARDINIERAPOLENTA FRIES WITH RED BELL PEPPER SALSAONLY reason for 4 stars and not five is that is so bloody loud. No one would ever describe me as soft spoken, you honestly can not hear each other talking. You're nearly screaming at each other. The wine drinking helps that along as the night goes on. It was a 9pm reservation and still was crowded and loud. Something new that I hadn't noticed before, they now sell wine for you to take as you are leaving. This is a great  idea after having a few glasses at dinner."
"I was here for a company party and wasn't necessarily impressed with the place. It just reminded me of every other chain place in the city, with the purchased ""ambiance"" (see: replica antiques) and feeling that I could have probably felt a little more comfortable. Setting a table large enough for our extra large party would have been a good start. We had some water issues as well.The food in general was good, I had the shrimp in olive oil and butter - extremely tasty and we started with the antipasto sampler. Everyone at the table ordered something different and sampled all around. Personally, I really, really, really dislike tapas style dining with more than two people. I find it cumbersome and exhausting. Everyone else seemed satisfied, so maybe I'm just a sourpuss.I can see myself going back here, but not with a large group!"
"Excellent Pizza - but its not just pizza.  All the food is amazing, and you can try a lot of it because it is meant to share.  The staff is really friendly, and they have lots of options for seating (booth, table, patio, bar, upstairs, terrace, etc.), which is something that I really like.  Great place for happy hour and/or a great weeknight dinner."
great food and great place!
"I love how they serve small plates, like Tapas but it's Italian food instead Spanish.  It is just so good!  I've tried about a million things on the menu.  My sister lives across the street so we tend to go there a lot.  It is a fun experience with 2 people or 6....and I always leave stuffed.  The best part is the price!!!  It's amazingly cost effective - I think the value is really exceptional.  The atmosphere is fun - not intimate at all - you kind of feel like you are in a big kitchen but it's different and I like it.  They do have a nice patio outside too when the weather is nice."
"The food wasn't that good, we had the eggplant parm which was burned and 90% cheese 10% eggplant.  How do you let burnt food go out of your kitchen."
"I had been here with my son for early dinner and had a great meal.  True it is loud, but didn't bother us.  About70% tourists. One waitstaff for four or five tables. Well run. I scheduled an anniversary party for my family of 20 or so. We has a private-ish alcove boardered by an aisle where wait staff passed from second floor seating to second floor main room. Every server passing by congratulated my parents on 57 years!  So charming. All loved the food. Can't beat $40 per for four courses. Chocolate fondue was awesome. I was a hero!  Thanks Quartino's!"
"When traveling in large groups, it is generally wise to make reservations.  We made one for 16 and it still took them 30 mins past the reservation time to get our table together.  They got a large crowd around the front of the store to make them seem busier than normal and gave us free bottles of wine for the trouble.  I never really knew that Italian tapas existed until I ate here.  We tried a little of everything.  The popeye pizza was actually pretty good.  It looks a little strange as they just take a normal thin crust pizza out of the oven and just throw mounds of fresh baby spinach on there.   The wild arugula burshetta was also very tasty.  I would skip the cavetelli as the sauce was not all that good.  The grilled organic veal skirt steak was a big hit among the meat eaters too.  It was overall a solid experience after the rocky start so I wouldn't mind trying it again."
"Amazing food and ambiance.  Tasty selection of wine, small dishes, and salumeria.  I've dined with both large groups and small groups, and aside from two incidents, service is usually impeccable.  Unfortunately, there were two rather annoying incidents where we were delivered the wrong food.  However, management more than made up for it by buying our dinners and giving us vouchers for free pizza (which is DELICIOUS) on our next visit.  My only complaint is that the bathrooms are on the 2nd floor with no elevator.  It can also be somewhat loud on the weekends, but for me, that just adds to the ambiance so I do not mind it at all.  This is definitely my go-to restaurant whenever I'm in the area.  I recommend dining on the patio."
"Great place for groups, when you are dining with little kids, anyone else with ADD or whom you have not much to say to.  It would also be a good place to discuss something taboo, as surely no one would be able to over hear your conversation.The food hits the spot, but would probably make Malto Mario cringe.  I had the duck pizza once, which was all arugula and no cheese.  Blech.  But the veggie pizza is good and I have several of the antipasti and pasta which were both yummy.  I also once had the veal milanese, and I hate to be nit picky, but it was NOT lightly breaded.  It was heavily breaded.I love the red wine.  It is not bad wine, but it is cheap."
"My friends and I go to Quartino at least once every two weeks and it is a great, reasonably priced restaurant to get good, Italian food and wine. The pastas, pizzas, and meats are unique, but the menu also offers more simple, classic dishes for those who are looking for a more classic Italian dish. The noise level can be loud at times, but is more energetic than overpowering in my experience. Outdoor dining is hard to get, but is definitely worth the wait if the weather is nice!"
"The decor made me feel like I was dining in some Italian village--super cute! Though the food didn't exactly blow my mind and Quartino is not my new favorite restaurant in Chicago, there were definitely some notables:- SALUMI! Especially the duck prosciutto. Eaten with the giardiniera they served on the side = MM MM MMMM! - Margherita pizza was very good. Probably the most exciting thin crust pizza I've ever had. - Veal meatballs really did melt in my mouth! Thank you, fellow Yelpers! The alcohol was relatively cheap as well, and I got pretty tipsy off of half a carafe of Bellini... Lastly, made reservations for 2 on a Saturday evening at 7:30pm on the same day, and we had no trouble getting a table and were seated immediatley! Brownie points!"
"It was my & my husband's first time  to this city & a very good friend that we were visiting decided to take us to this place for our first Chicago meal. Granted that we had a long wait since it was a Sat night when we came with no reservation, we enjoyed every aspect of our meal. Great experience!"
"I've been here for drinks a few times - a good downtown area option for some good food and wines. I'm a pretty big fan of the small plates menu...the meats and cheese are always good and fairly true to Italian fare. One thing to note: it gets pretty dang loud, conversation can be unfriendly come 7 or 8pm. I also hosted a dinner event here in the upstairs rooms - highly recommended. Great little environment, absolutely wonderful service, good wines and good bang-for-your buck...even if you're spending someone else money. They do it right for birthdays, bachelor/ettes, company, group dining and any other special events you can think of regardless of your wallet."
Food is awesome but noise level makes it hard to even hear the waiter!
"Love this place...especially their wine list (and the fact that you can get 3 different sizes of wines!)  I sat outside the other night which was a great thing, service was fast and prompt and our servers were funny and super social which always is a plus!  I've never gone to a place where when you pick a wine or a dessert the server actually tells you their honest opinion (my server gave me a look of disapproval when I asked for the nutella panini for dessert, he told me the chocolate cake was the way to go).  Well he was RIGHT..definitely amazing!I love the concept of Italian tapas...perfect portions to try and sample everything.  Prices are a little high but nothing out of control.The only funny story I have is that we were sitting outside on the patio and our pizza we ordered was up on the stand , and we were sitting closer to the street as opposed to closer to the restaurant...a homeless lady walked by and told us she loved our pizza and would like a slice...thankfully my friend shooed her away (my pathetic self was just about to tell her, aww sure why not)...And the best part of this place is that it's opened late, I think after our tab came we went back inside for some drinks at the bar til 1am! Great times :)"
"Since Quartino has opened its been packed! They must be doing something right.  the food is good, but its not the best Italian food.  It is simple and casual and always a good time. The prices are right as well. Some of my favorites are the bruschetta, orechiete, and any of the pizzas. Tonight we went for the mussels and they were pretty delicious!  If you are looking for a fun easy restaurant for a big group, head to Quartino."
"I'm not a huge fan of Italian food, nor am I from the Chicago area, but I must say that dining at Quartino was quite the experience. I've visited many tapas restaurants that served Spanish food, true to the genre, but never before an Italian tapas restaurant. The portions were adequate and the prices quite competitive. I ordered the penne ala vodka with mozzarella and a tortellini soup (vegetable base) and both were outstanding but because of the tapas sized portions, I wasn't really full (nor was I willing to share). I'd recommend getting soup, main dish, and a dessert if you like to feel full. Overall though, I was really satisfied. The service was also quite speedy and friendly. I visited with a large party and they were able to separate our checks (between 20+ people). I highly recommend Quartino to anyone looking for savory Italian cuisine that isn't too expensive."
"i came back for a lovely lunch date and had THE BEST food - risotto, pork belly w/ apples, a huge gelato sundae, and all of it was gluten-free.  the service is so friendly and competent and helpful and god, that food, mmmmm-hmmmm.  i ate so much i damaged myself.  but that's my fault, not theirs :D"
"Great rustic family style Italian food!  This place is best to go with a group and share a bunch of items.  Plus, the giant carafes of wine are a nice treat to share!"
"This is my favorite go-to restaurant in the area.  It's get for family, friends, or out of town visitors.  It has a nice outdoor area in the summer and is huge inside (2 floors).  The food is delicious and it's decently priced.  Great place to stop if you're visiting Chicago or shopping the mag-mile"
"This place is cavernous, deafeningly loud, and an amazingly packed factory.  Came with a friend on a weekday night (after having called ahead to avoid the 25 minute wait), and got seated up on the 2nd floor back room.  The noise level is extremely high -  people are literally yelling and shouting across tables, it's definitely not a place for a quiet dinner out.  The menu consists of tapas style Italian dishes - we had the brussel sprouts salad (beware, the vinegar-based dressing is extremely acidic), one of the vegetarian pizzas, and carpaccio appetizer (which I didn't get to taste).  All were pretty standard.   Service was extremely friendly and nice, but given the raucous atmostphere I'm not sure I would make it back - my eardrums are more important to me."
"why is a perfectly good restaurant right off of michigan avenue?  this kind of place should be in a cobblestone alley somewhere, hidden so that the tourists can't find it and coerce it into becoming a chain.  the wine is served in carafes, an economical way to sample a few of your favorites without paying too much.  per the suggestion of our waiter, we sampled the calamari, beef carpaccio, and tortellini with prosciutto and peas.  i am lactose intolerant, and there was a LOT of cream in that pasta, but if given fair warning, i would gladly suffer for more of the tortellini.  the portions are small to mediumish, but if you order strategically, you can try a bunch of dishes that you may not otherwise want to eat a whole meal of.  service here was impeccable, perhaps even efficient to a fault.  we came for an early pre-show dinner and told this to the waiter.  he had us in and out in under an hour.  next time, i'll be sure to linger a bit more."
"Food is good, not great. Service is very hit or miss. This place is a mixed bag. I WANT to love it, but I don't."
"I heart Quartino.  All those naysayers below who claim that small plates are not the way to eat Italian are wrong.  We were able to sample far more things than we would have been able to with normal sized portions and it wasn't that expensive.  The house red is quite delish for only $16 a liter and the gelato and banana desert was awesome.  This is what we ordered (for three of us) based on our piqued interests, yelper's reviews and our knowledgable servers suggestions:1.  cheese plate with tallagio, romano, beet salad, duck proscuitto cured in house.  2.  polenta fries with a roasted red pepper sauce 3.  caprese salad (a definite must!) 4.  spaghetti with a sweet marinara5.  duck filled ravioli with fava beans6.  some sort of 4 cheese pizza (couldn't finish it - too much food!)7.  The carmalized banana desert thing and the lemon gelato sandwichesTotal bill for all that, plus wine, three people, more food than you can eat: $105.  It was an amazing dinner and a great value.  Two thumbs up for this place."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.... but I fell I am being VERY NICE about giving this place 2 stars!I've been to this place like 4 times, and even though my friend gave me ""comp pizza"" coupons, I will not use the rest and instead hand them out.The pizzas are okay, at best. Nothing fancy, similiar to ""real pizza in Italy"". Sorry.... new york pizza rules!The wine is OKAY, of course... HOUSE WINE... nothing fancy.... The side dishes are good, but nothing really sticks out...Like I said, been here 4 times, I really WANTED to like this place... but the main dishes are..... too... plain... Guys, don't bash me.... this IS SUPPOSE to be OPINION BASED!I'm not saying these guys are horrible, I just didn't like it!Oh... does not matter with or without reservations... you WILL WAIT.... in the COLD...."
"If you're a fan of films like Goodfellas or The Godfather but aren't Italian, Quartino is the place for you. I took my family when they recently visited and we were treated like familia. The dining experience is very open. Many of the plates are small but are passed around from one to the next as you chat and enjoy lots of good wine (which you can also purchase on the way out). On TV screens throughout the restaurant they're playing Roman Holiday and the Q-shaped bread is very cute.Be prepared for a loud evening as the place gets packed and everyone's chatting it up at their tables."
"I love this place.  I have been several times, and everyone I have taken has loved it too.  It's tapas meets Italian, and that rhymes with ""big food hard-on"" to me.  I have had nothing that I didn't like, but I've also never had the pizza.  It just doesn't seem like a pizza joint to me, and from what I hear, that's where the place flails.  Go down the list of their fantastic wine selection.  Mix and match.  Share all the plates, so you can try as much as possible.  It's a fun night out in the realm of choose-your-own adventure coursing.  The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly, which can always cost a place at least one star, if not more."
"Went here for an end-of-softball-season party with co-workers.  We sat in the bar area, and pulled a bunch of tables together.  We ordered lots of red and white wine with several different pizzas and antipasto platters.  The service was friendly and they kept the carafes of wine full.  The food was not overwhelmingly good, but I love pizza so I wasn't about to turn it down.  I would like to go back, grab a table with my sweetheart and enjoy a low key meal and give it another shot."
"My first time at Quartino's was this past December for our holiday work party.  I got trashed on some delicious chardonnay and was loving that food.  I went for a second time, sat in the bar area, and again, enjoyed the food and the wine.  Things I loved:-atmosphere--something about tiled walls makes me feel good.  It's old, clean-looking, almost like I'm eating in a bath tub, and I love the bath tub.-veggie pizza--the cheese, crust, and veggies were divine.  I guess that's the whole pizza.-pasta ragu--it's like a meat sauce, but not super chunky.  Good flavor.Desserts:-fruit with chocolate fondu!-little doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce--yum!Negatives:-It gets insanely busy.  However, on a Saturday night I walked in and got a table in the bar area.  It's first come first serve and there was plenty of space.-As the night progressed, though, large parties that were waiting for tables were taking the tables at the bar just to sit and wait, which got kind of annoying because they were all up in our faces.  Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.Will definitely be back."
"I don't eat downtown often, but I must say this place is pretty damned good for the price.  The calamari was excellent, the bread was fresh, and the linguini with clams was tasty.  The pizza isn't really like any I've had in Italy, but it was good.The house wines for $16 a litre aren't bad, especially if you want a buzz on the cheap.[pretentiousness] I would give this place 5 stars, but I can't because I've been spoiled by much better food in Italy. [/pretentiousness]"
"I've been here a handful of times since moving to Chicago in Feb. The food is amazing!Every time I've gone, it's been a Friday or Saturday night. It amazes me how busy this place gets. I've never arrived without a reservation (and at least on the weekends, I don't recommend you do) and most of the time, the only reservation time available for a group of 4-5 is super early or 9p when you book at the beginning of the week. I'll admit, it's loud, but that's all part of the ambiance. Bring friends, though assume you'll only speak with the ones next to you. SHARE! It's small plate Italian and historically we've started the sampler and had everyone pick a max of 1 dish and then passed the plates. The drinks are also yummy! Wine is relatively inexpensive and I enjoyed the red sangria during my most recent visit. In my opinion, the place definitely has bang for its buck as far as good restaurants in that area."
"I just love this restaurant.  It never misses.  I love the idea of tasting plates for italian.  It's a great place for any occasion.  The prices are right, the flavor amazing and the ambiance is great.  This definitely one of my go-to restaurants."
"Usual good service, fine small-plate foods. My go-to place for workweek meetings on the Near North Side."
"Not that this place needs another review, but it deserves it. We found this place via Yelp, and THANK YOU YELPERS! You did not lead us astray.We ate on the patio on an August evening on a Monday night. The waiter was attentive to our drinks. Servers were knowledgeable and explained each course as presented.Food arrived VERY quickly. Our cheese and meat tray arrived within 5 minutes of ordering. As did the pasta. Our bill was just under $60 for 3 people, 2 courses, a cheese and meat tray, and wine. Extremely reasonable, especially considering the authentic atmosphere.Tips: The Liter of wine is a great deal for 3 or 4 people. It's family style dining, so try something new. Check out the WC (water closet), it's unique and has a window to the other gender's closet."
"I went here with my group from work for our holiday lunch in 2006.  It was nothing short of fabulous.  We were a group of about 12, so the ""family style"" dining worked really well for us.  The service was great, the wine list awesome, and the food was fantastic!  I wouldn't recommend going here with a small group (4 or less), only because you won't be able to sample as many of the dishes and have it make economical sense,  but it's absolutely great for a larger group."
"Loudest restaurant I have ever been to, but the food and fantastic service completely make up for it. Wonderful limoncello cocktail too. We had a dynamite time!"
"Went back during a recent trip to Chicago. Great food, great service."
"I am a tapas lover (as in it is my favorite food group) and I love to explore all the different varieties in Chicago.  Let me tell you that Quartino definitely did not disappoint.I had only been once before for wine and olives in the bar and knew how packed this place got ,so for roomie night out we decided to do a later dinner and I made a reservation. We arrived, were told it would be about 10 minutes (with reservation) and we decided to start with a drink in the bar.  Let me tell you that this was no easy feat.  Even at 9pm this place was completely packed tight.  We managed to squeeze our way to the bar and within minutes had a small carafe to split while we waited.  The wine we picked wasn't great and I was looking forward to getting some recommendations from the waiter when we sat as I know this place is famous for the wine.We were seated within the 10 mins or so and on the second floor which mainly consisted of large parties.  It was a bit rowdy, and oddly enough it was the oldest group (all in their 40's) that was creating all the noise in a room full of 20 somethings.  A waiter came almost immediately and let us know that he wasn't our waiter but would start us out with some drinks.  We asked for recommendations and he asked about our tastes in wine and recommended a GREAT vino at a moderate price.  Super helpful, polite and he wasn't even our server.  I love that kind of service.The rest of night was great.  We way over ordered and were only able to taste the last two dishes.  Everything was brought out in the perfect order and the timing was perfect.  Highly recommend but not all in the same night (learned that it was way to rich)Fondue- with applesPesto gnocchiSausage risottoOverall, we had a great experience.  Everyone was super friendly and the service was great.  Also wanted to mention the close quarters at the bar and during seating lead to some friendly conversation with other patrons.  I would recommend this place for lively events (groups, girls night out) but probably not so much for a date night."
"I don't know what all the fuss is over this place. The experience wasn't great at all. I had the pleasure of being accompanied by one Lori R. We were early (a rarity for Lori) and because of the volume of customers waited till our designated reservation, OK our mistake. When we finally sat down the place was cramped and really ridiculously loud. This however was a god send bc it allowed us to talk loudly about the other patrons without them hearing our comments. The food started off great. The bruschetta was great wow what a kick off only to be followed up by numerous food fumbles. The pasta was an odd consistency and not our standard fare, the pork chops Marsala were bland, and the antipasta platter tanked and was served last. The olives were disgusting, did they use pine sol in the marinade bc that's what it tasted like. Lori Yelp and I have been mislead....AGAIN"
"This is an amazing dining experience!!!!! Went with a large group (11 people) and tried about half the menu. Everything was positively superb. The biggest shock of the night was how remarkable the lasagna tasted. Lasagna is like pizza to me...even lousy lasagna is still good (just my opinion). However, this was quite possibly the BEST lasagna I have ever had!!! Also, all the vegetables were seasoned and cooked perfectly. The rabe was out of this world.Now, the only reason it isn't getting 5 stars is the noise. There is your typical loud restaurant....and then you have Quartino's. I could not even hear the people that were sitting right next to me. We were yelling at one another the entire time. And it is an extremely crowded dining area, so if you don't like to have people sit very close, you will not enjoy this establishment. So...moral of the story: if you want a memorable meal with little table talk, this is the place to be :)"
"Service was good, food was good as well - but WAY too salty. Fun atmosphere."
"Food is fine, but it comes out of the kitchen when it comes out.  They warn you of this randomness when you order.  My husband's entree came out 40 minutes prior to mine.  Too bad, that is how it works.We were warned!Not sure why this is the way it is, but note that.  This is probably a fine place for all appetizers that are being shared."
"The food is great here and totally affordable.  It is great for a date or a group of people.  It is so simple: just order different little plates and sample all kinds of food.  I love the gnocci!Beware- the hostess will glare at you, but just glare back and she will smile next time.  I swear.  I have tried it."
"I went there for the first time with my boyfriend and his out of town family and all 5 of us were so incredibly pleased! We ordered the antipasti platter and just had our server pick the best ones out for us, the fonduta (which was sooooo good!) and an array of entrees from the skate wing (wonderful) to shrimp scampi, to linguine with clams (that had the most clams in it that I have ever seen, most restaurants skimp on expensive things like seafood.) We all raved about our dishes. Only negatives are how loud it is and how cramped the tables are togetherI've been back two times since and each time, have been less pleased (maybe just because someone else wasn't paying for me like the first time) I went there last night and by boyfriend ordered the duck leg, but it was by far the worst dish we have had there. I also tried the baby spinach salad and was also disappointed, the dressing tasted like lemon juice alone. There mixed drinks are a tad pricey, 8.50 for a vodka and water. I think they have really well priced wine and entrees but all the other things are typical prices for chicago. I know it sounds like I don't like the place, but just had an average last experience there. But the place gets four stars for the skate wing, the linguine, the fonduta (make sure you get the apples to dip) and the friendly servers, however the female hostess have quite an attitude sometimes."
"Quartino is a great after work place for reasonably priced food and reasonably priced wine.  I have had dinner in the main dining room two or three times and I much prefer the bar area.  The bar is friendly, the kind of place where you go with a small group of friends to enjoy each others company.I think the food can be hit or miss.  I usually get a salad and an appetizer, last time I was there I had the Arugula Salad and the Grilled Octopus appetizer and both were prepared well and tasted good.  I also love their meat, olive and cheese selections.  I am not crazy about their wines, they are very affordable but I've had multiple selections and never been too crazy about any of them.  I don't think anyone goes to Quartino expecting a great wine selection but I think you expect more of a lower priced wine selection - which is what you will get.I have always had very good service at Quartino too.  They train their staff on their wine and the food.  The bartenders are always friendly and helpful.  My favorite part - that powder soap in the bathrooms.  I love the way it makes my hands feel and the way it smells.  I wish I knew where to buy that!"
"How do you say ""boo"" in Italian? Even though I didn't pay for dinner there, it was blah.Reasons:1. Our waiter had a cheesy accent and a lofty attitude.2. Their wine tasted like Franzia sans the box.3. The pizza was ick! Honestly... the cheese and tomato from Italy comment didn't help. I guess it explains why the pizza wasn't that great. The best pizza is from Chicago!4. I thought a Soprano was gonna come shoot me. JK.5. Olives were too strong, blah.6. Gnocchi was oily and mushy. WTF?One thing that was good was some eggplant spread with bread.Overall, it was overpriced and not that great. Given the choice, I'd go eat something from Walgreens and buy a new car battery."
"What a great spot! Went with my coworkers last week while in town for work and honestly all my favorite things in one place - excellent wine, cheese, spreads, Neapolitan style pizza and tapas style Italian food. Everything was great. I highly recommend the sampler platter of cheese/meats/sides. The pizza crust could have been a bit crispier (though I'm comparing to ny pizza) and the place was a bit loud but a great experience overall. I'll definitely go back here again when I'm visiting the city. A great scene, very reasonable prices and solid food."
"I went here with 4 friends to check out the Italian tapas. It's a cool idea and apparently this place got rave reviews. We got there and it was packed and fast paced. We were seated promptly but the positives ended there. We were offered what appeared to be Wonder Bread and cheap olive oil. Each plate that came out from the pizza to the Gnocchi was disappointing. The wine was three times what you would pay in a store and one quart we got may as well have been pure vinegar. This place gets two stars because for five people our bill was less than $100, which was awesome. But for the food and experience was seriously worth about half that."
"Quartino is truly ""the place to be!""  It's a place to be seen at, and during the warmer months, a place to sit outide and see others.  Owned by the people at Gibson's, the Quartino crowd is just as hip.First things first, the vino.  Wine is served here by the carafe, like in Italia.  There are varying sizes of carafes and the wine list is quite extensive, inclusive of vino from motepulciano and even some brunello.The antipasti is simple and very good with the wine selection.  Great olives, fennel, cured meats, and cheeses.  People tend to go for the pizza, but compared to the rest of the menu, the pizza tends to be on the weaker side.  Yes it is thin, but it is just trying to be italian and doesn't have that cracker-like, semi-charred crust like Spacca Napoli - which is real neapolitan pizza.  And for Italian pizza, i need real mozzarella di bufala.The scallops and other fish dishes are simple and impressive, so is the farm house chicken, and the organic chicken has improved greatly - the quality of their meats is good and very tasty.  This is a fun spot to hang out at, serving til 2 am, and the ambiance is warm and inviting."
"We made reservations for eight two weeks before the event. We showed up and were seated without a hitch. There were eight of us, and they sat us at a, somewhat, smaller table. There wasn't really much room for all the food and they were slow-er to clear the tables. We ordered tons of food and it just kept coming. The portions are just right for sharing and their pizzas are very large and yummy!Our server was very patient (most people's first time) and efficient. The prices are reasonable and they have a couple of bottles of wine priced at $12. Awesome.I would give this place 4.5 stars, so I rounded up!Definitely try this place out. Their scallops melt in your mouth, mozzarella in the caprese salad is super fresh, and the pizzas are thin crust, affordable, and delicious!"
"Have been to Quartino numerous times for lunch and dinner.  Dining in the bar for lunch is a terrific experience, and the dining room is great as well.Solid cured meat selections, great cheeses and wide range of entrees.Perfect for a large, boisterous group of friends - the noise level of the dining room can be somewhat raucous - it's got that sort of fun, hectic feel that really enlivens a dinner party.Emily B's description is spot on - the holiest of unions of tapas and Italian food.Keep it up guys."
"Maybe I need to come back again...because the food I ate tasted okay. I had the tortellini, shrimp risotto, and beef baby ribs. Dessert was really great though I couldn't even finish it because I was full. The place was crowded and a bit loud. I had higher expectations. I think this review sucks."
"Amazing place with excellent italina Food. The Place is very busy even on weeknights so a reservation is reccomended. Pizza was good, and the Veal Meatballs are great. The pasta and Risotto were excellent and the price compared to the quality of food was excellent. Good Polenta Fries. Please order the deserts... thye are to die for.... The Tiramisu is not on menu, but definitely ask for it. Will definetly go again."
"I attended my first Yelp event at Quartino's last night.It advertises itself as a pizza joint, but honestly, it's so much more than that.   We were able to sample some of the appetizers set out for us as well as the bellini station.  Everything was fantastic.  The service was awesome, everyone was very nice and accommodating, from the hostess up front to the servers offering appetizers and the bartenders.When the pizza came out, we were very excited, I love thin crust pizza and it was honestly, some of the best I've had in a long time.  It was thin, not too crispy and not too cheesy.  Perfect for me.  It did remind me of pizza that I'd had in Italy.   Bravo, Quartino!We were able to scope a glance at the menu before we left and we can't wait to try it again!"
"I found the Salumeira (sp?) items to be a bit so-so, even though I thought they were a great value.    The ravioli with fava beans was to die for.    The duck prosciutto pizza - yum!   I watched this teeny tiny girl pour olive oil all over her pizza and thought - why didn't I think of that.    Of course, then I laid it on mine - wow, what a great idea.    I have reservations today and then am off to see Wicked!    I will report back!*** Second trip to Quartino's - We had bellinis, tortellini, beef carpaccio, d'anitra pizza, nutella panino and zeppole.    Everything was great.   Service was unbelievable.    The place was packed yet the waitstaff and managers made us feel like we were the most important people in the place.    The deserts just sealed the deal.   This place is great!!!"
"Quartino is a study in ""how to pack the most people into a restaurant."" Truly, I don't know if I've ever seen a dining room that looked more like canned sardines than this one. Despite this, I'm giving Quartino four stars because the crowds did not at all ruin the experience, at least for me. We were with a large party, so we let the waiter do the ordering for us - and he didn't go wrong. He brought a hefty selection of antipastos, salads, entrees... and it was all delicious. Edgy enough to be different, yet very classic Italian. The eggplant antipasto was a standout, as was the garlic red-sauce pasta (can't remember the real name). Simple, strong, yum. The only area lacking was the dessert. We had a chocolate ice cream concoction and some creme-filled pastries. They were good but not as exciting and flavorful as the other dishes.Oh, and how can I forget the wine? The wine was one of the best parts of our Quartino experience. The waiter recommended one of their highlighted Cabernets and it was magnificent. Dry, smoky, great with the food's strong flavors. A perfect pairing."
"Came here the other day and it was great. Italian tapas... brilliant! I had caprese salad, shrimp risotto, and the assorted sorbet for desert. It was all great, I wish the caprese had more balsamic vinegar though.The service and atmosphere was really good too, so I'll definitely be back here."
"I had dinner here on a Tuesday night and white the food was good... I would not say its as good as it gets.   The small plates are really nice sized plates.  This is a great place to eat dinner and not break the bank.  My waiter, Zach, was fantastic!   Zach provided great service, was friendly and helpful.   I had a pizza... while it was good, it was not great.   Its not the type of pizza you crave.  One of the plates we had was gnocchi... we had it served with a meat sauce and it was very good.   The final small plate we had was a shrimp dish... and it was really good.   That would have been enough food, but we also had dessert.  We had the cannoli... it was good... but not the best I've ever had..  and some sort of lemon dessert that was really amazing that I would try again.  I would eat here again... the food was good... service was fantastic.... and all at a reasonable price."
"Authentic Italian portions that are just the right size so you can sample a bunch without letting any go to waste.  This place was an awesome save at midnight for our party of four food-fussy travellers. Great service too, even in the middle of the night. Will def go back on my next trip to the city."
"I did make 8 o'clock reservations and we did arrive a little late but well apparently they were not ready for us, we got seated at around 8:45ish.The bellini was really good!The food was good, we had the portabella bruchette, which was good, the tortellini was good, except the peas were kinda hard and the scallops were really good.We were actually full after all that but the desserts looked really good!I see other people were complaining about people hitting the chair bec its to crowded, my bf also did not like that either!I had a inside seat so I was ok!Our waitress was pretty good and the food did come out fast so that was a plus since they made us wait for 45 min to be seated!It is pretty touristy and really packed and I guess it is really annoying sitting in a seat where people pass by since people keep bumping into you ."
"Great tapas, thumbs up on the tortellini w/prosciutto, the sea scallops and the carpaccio. The risotto's were a little loose for me. But a place I would go back to again and again."
"Loud, but fun atmosphere! I really liked the food overall and the service was good for it being so loud."
"Very, very good food. I was in town on business and went here with a couple coworkers. Most wines you can order by the bottle or liter (win!) and all are affordability priced. The entrees were all amazing, we ended up getting  6 and sharing all of them. This place has great ambiance; a little on the loud side but in a friendly way. It has the feel of a much more expensive restaurant, our bill came to only $100 (before tip) for three people, including wine! Will be back the next time I'm in town."
"I've had mixed experiences here. I wasnt crazy about the pasta I ordered the first time I went or my salad. I went for the pizza though the next time and LOVED it! The wine is very reasonably priced and the outdoor seating is always a plus. I would avoid being seated upstairs if you can. The bar is downstairs meaning that it can take forever to get a drink. I'm also not crazy about not being served at the same time as others at the table. My fiance was done with his risotto before my pizza came. To be fair, they warn you about that beforehand. I'll definitely be back to Quartino for the prices, pizza, ambience, and wine!"
"This place deserves 2 stars, but if I had to rate the service, it would have been a 5! I went here for my friend's birthday party and I wasn't too thrilled from the outside.  When I got in, It was ridiculously loud and packed and the table I sat at was pretty small for a group of 7.  The food was O.K. nothing fabulous! Everything ordered here was meant for sharing, but honestly I felt like there was not enough to share.  Nothing tasted different, I felt like I could have whipped something up better in my own kitchen.  The waiter made our night tho, he was very attentive and he cracked some jokes here and there that set the mood.  Later, he brought out the cake which we had ordered for my friend and he surprised us with candles (which we forgot to buy along with the cake) and a discount!"
"Love Love Love this place!  Great wine, Great food, Great atmosphere!  Affordable considering you're in Downtown Chicago!"
"Crazy long wait times, but we sat at the bar, where no one else was. The food is small plate style, but I was only hungry enough for a small plate of pasta. The pasta was awesome - oriecchette with fennel-sausage ragu. Amazing! The wine is served in carafes. Had the Gran Coppa Quartino for dessert - decent. Everything was fairly priced and delicious."
"I've tried Quartino twice: once for a date night and another time with a group.  And I was extremely satisfied on both occassions!  Our recent trip involved going with the in-laws who were visiting from the burbs.  It was a great social setting to take a family of 7 for a Saturday afternoon lunch.  The constant flow of food made dining out more of an experience than just eating.  We were all able to sample each others food and try things we wouldn't normall try.The staff was great:  we wanted to try a seafood dish but the only option on the menu included raw fish.  So, he checked with the kitchen staff and they were able to whip up some scallops off of the dinner specials menu and they were very tasty.Down side is it can get a little crazy on Friday and Saturday night.  But hang by the bar and have a drink....especially some wine.  The best part is the cheap, tasty wine. Yum :)"
"I was so excited to try this place but was left so diappointed.  For one thing the dishes are so tiny that they are a joke.  I know, I know, it's ""tapas"".  For 3 of us we ordered 4 dishes, 2 appetizers, and had bread and I was still STARVING!  Why you ask?  Well for 1 thing, an order of the $12 scallops gave us only 3 scallops!  What a joke.  Plus the calamari was none too great and I did not care for the odd tasting polenta fries. But I was being treated so I wasn't going to raise a ruckus.  I did love the asparagus risotto though, and the chocolate cake.  I would never go back, I find it to be a rip off and an expensive way to get full."
"love love love this restaurant  food is always exceptional, as is t/service & you can't find a better restaurant of this quality for the $  great wine list too"
Quartino is amazing.  This is a place to go with a group of friends.  You are able to share small dishes and the prices are great! I love the vodka sauce pasta.  Delicious.  I love going here when it is nice out and you can sit outside.  It is great for people watching.  I come here often and have no complaints!
"Girlfriend and I hit this place - was a big fan of all their risottos, the short ribs, and desserts galore!"
"The best deal on the meu is the two dollar veal meatball slider.  The pizza is okay and the calamari was bland and when I asked for a sauce other than the watery chili sauce it came with the waiter was out of suggestions and basically implied that I should just take it... The did close the patio (10/11?) while we were eating and I don't know if they comped the wine because of that, but the wine was free...The shrimp risotto was too cluttered for my taste with random vegetables.  The bolognese was okay."
"LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED this place!!!!i visited my best friend at the end of July and she took us here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Even though we were late for our reservation they seated us right away. Our waiter was fantastic.  even though you could tell he was very busy he didn't rush us AT ALL.  the wine was fantastic.  the food - oh.  delicious.  we ordered the meatballs, the caprese salad, the asparagus risotto, fondutta and a pasta dish.  the HIGHLIGHT of my dinner -- the grilled nutella panini.  i was a nutella virgin.  i cannot believe the chocolaty deliciousness i have been missing out on!!!!!i left a little tipsy.  sufficiently full.  and my sweet tooth was satisfied."
"Great, fun food - the Italian version of tapas.  Perfect for groups that like to share as expected from Italian style eating.  They feature a simple one page menu.  Almost everything is good, I'm a fan of the duck ragu and lamb shank.Save room for the zeppole for dessert.If you don't like loud places with lots of people - you wont like this place."
"Delicious itialian!!! Loved it here, Reiterate need for a reservation."
"I liked the drinks and food I have ordered in the restaurant and bar.  Yummy Bellinis. Q is a casual date place, it's nice to share food, so it's also good for a group, but can get very crowded and loud after about 7pm.  A word on the monthly wine tasting - if you really want to try new wines and get an eduction - don't bother with Quartino's.  Ugh, it was a zoo last night.  Too many people and long lines for vino.  Food was good -  in fact - delicious, wine was just ok, and the lines were crazy long by 7:15.  I enjoyed talking to the few people I did.  The staff seemed very unprepared for the droves of people that showed up.  I won't be going back for another tasting.  I enjoyed the one I went to at Fleming's a few weeks ago.  MUCH more civilized."
"I had my rehearsal dinner here.  This place is usually solid, but I feel that they had trouble executing the same quality for larger groups, you know how sometimes the meals aren't so great if they are served several times in one night.  The service was incredible, though, even if the food was just okay that night.  Quartino, take that nutella panini off the menu.  I felt like a fool serving that to my guests, it was so hard, I almost broke a tooth.  Thank goodness the service was so good, they brought another dessert out."
"Really good food and I like how it's done family style. We tried an assortment of pastas and meats/cheese, and it was fantastic. Add some good wine specials and it turned out to be a good evening.Got a reservation for the place through OpenTable, but it ended up not being necessary for a Sunday evening."
"We were in Chicago for a mere 5 days, hoping to partake of some delicious food among other cultural experiences. But ya, namely eating. And, since we are Angelenos, we're pretty hard to impress. But I didn't actually realize this until 3 or 4 mediocre meals in. Chicago of all places. Then again, we didn't exactly have a lot of friends here to show us the local scene. But who needs the locals when you have Yelp. Anyways, I digress. The much lauded XOCO had a major line out the front door so we walked to Quartino's, as our second resort. No expectations. And wholly heck, we were so blown away. We don't really have good Italian in LA, and this was seriously good food in an authentic energetic atmosphere. Don't be fooled by the business crowd sitting outside. This is seriously great food, especially the short rib and polenta fries. And the restaurant is beautifully authentic. Especially the bathrooms upstairs! Classic black and white tiles with a gorgeous green leather arm chair.This is the only restaurant we hit up twice! In 5 days! Affordable, delicious and zero attitude. I love this place."
"Quartino is definitely a happening place.  We made a reservation for 7pm but didn't actually get seated until at least a half hour later, so my advice would probably be to reserve a bit earlier than you actually plan to eat - that way you'll be hungry and not starving by the time the food comes!  The gnocchi was very squishy, a little too squishy for me, but the flavor was good.  We really enjoyed the shrimp risotto, which wasn't too creamy, and the beef fillet, which was tender and well-balanced by the vegetables it came with.  My favorite was the sea scallops dish, which had a bit of a buttery tomato aftertaste.  Yum.  I also loved the Quartino dessert, especially since it came piled high with toasted hazelnuts and really good biscotti (with raisins in it!).If you're going for a red wine, try the mazziato (sp?) merlot - sooo good!"
"AMAZING. We ordered gnocchi, spinach risotto, salmon, pureed potato, house wine and lemon gelato for dessert.  Best tapas restaurant I've ever been to, hands down. Including a generous tip, it was still under $100, very reasonable. Crowded and loud like the other reviewers say, but well worth it. Service at the bar and while dining was exceptional. Will be back next trip to Chi!"
"For some reason I didn't love this place the first time I dined there. I don't know what was wrong with me that day! I remember the Fondue was delicious but that I couldn't really find anything else. I'm so happy that I gave it a second chance (and several other chances since)! It is actually a great place for dining out! If I created a list for places to bring my family members when they visit from out of town (which I really can't because my West Coast family members never venture far from the Pacific), this would be in the Top 5 for sure. It has something for everyone! It has many recognizable comfortable options, but it's just different/special enough to make everyone feel like they're having a unique dining experience. The wait-staff is VERY friendly (my mother was stoked that four different people thanked her for coming and wished her a good evening as she was walking out the door) and some of them, very familiar with the cuisine that they're serving. I was thrilled to learn that our waiter the other night studied abroad in Rome (actually in the same Loyola program as me which was very cool). Reservations are easy to make and they are very understanding if you are running a couple of minutes late. Though I don't recommend pushing that, the place fills up VERY quickly. Here are my only complaints: a) because of the large open spaces and the number of visitors every day, the place can get really, really loud (difficult to even hear the person sitting next to you) and b) I was once served Spaghetti with Marinara when I ordered Carbonara (kind of a significant difference - though I honestly dug the Marinara better, uh oh). These are kind of nit-picky so if I could just deduct half a star, I would. In any case, bring the 'rents when they visit from out of town. They'll dig it.  Also, if you are looking for private dining for a small group - reserve their wine room! I as told it has a capacity of 17, but makes for a GREAT place for a dinner meeting or something. I booked a reservation for a business meeting that I didn't actually attend. Everyone loved it."
"Good Food + Affordable prices + Decent Wine at Decent Prices = Quartino!!!I actually came here for the wine tasting, which I didn't actually get to do.  But that was okay, because the affordable wine prices ($12 for a 1/4 carafe of Montepulciano??!) and the really decent food made the evening quite nice!  My friend got the Bellini ($9ish for 1/4 carafe, apparently quite good) and we shared the Eggplant Bruschette (yum!) and a pizza.  So good!!!!!Definitely coming back here again."
"Always packed and full of life, quartinos is always consistently good. I've been here a handful of timed and each dish is always top notch. Pasta always cooked perfect, small plates for sharing and great desserts."
"The atmosphere was authentic Italian ristorante; tile floors and walls. We had no reservation on a Saturday night, so we faced a 2 hour wait for a table or 45 minutes for an outside table. But we went to the bar and found a table immediately. The food was fantastico. There were only 3 of us, so we couldnt really appreciate the make-your-own appetizer of exotic cheeses, meats and olives. But it sounded terrific to us. The carafe of chianti was delicious as a complement to vodka penne pasta, eggplant parm, and quatro frommagio pizza. Yum. I can't wait to go back."
"Well, I had only been in Chicago one week and I stopped by Quartino with my family.  It's a great atmosphere and very good food - lots of vibrancy."
"I have been to this place many many times. It is a great place to spend 3 hours eating great food. I have found that if people know what to expect from this place then they have a much better dining experience. It is a tapas style Italian restaurant. It is a great place to go on Friday or Saturday night to hang out with friends or a date. A few tips though:1. Don't go with more than four people. This place is tapas style and the dishes are best shared by 2-4 people. With more than 4, it can get a little awkward picking dishes and sharing. 2. Pace yourself. Don't order everything at once. If you pace yourself, you will have a much better dining experience. Having 4 dishes come at the same time is just too much.  3. Order the house wine. It is very good and affordable. Bottom line: I have gone here probably 40 times in the past two years and I have rarely had a bad meal."
"Well, with 252 reviews, I don't know what new things I can offer to the mix.  Here goes...1.  Service was great!  In fact, I would have graded this restaurant 3.5 but bumped up rather than down because of the service.2.  Dishes overall were very very good.  Must haves:  Shrimp risotto (mmm... so flavorful.) and orincetta pasta.3.  Dessert - unenthusiastic ""m'eh.""  I had the Limone Gelato ""sandwich.""  The cakes were dry and the gelato was vanilla.  M'eh.4.  Went with a group of 5 others and with alcohol and tip, the bill was less than $180.  Not bad!5.  Valet parking only $10.  Self parking in that neighborhood is mucho dinero.  $10 is a bargain for those needing to drive.6.  Loved the ease of the reservations online.  Please, Chicago restaurants, more of you should do that!!"
Awesome - nice authentic-feeling Italian/Mediterranean deli and restaurant. Small plates with tapa-like feeling. Really enjoyed the food and wine here.
Italian tapas? Yes please. We went here with the parents a few weeks ago and I enjoyed everything I ate. The service was good (which can be an issue with tapas). The atmosphere is a little off because they really pack you in. But if you can tolerate that you will over the food and the concept. Very good.
"After reading all the glowing reviews Quartino has received, I had to check it out.  Maybe my expectations were built up too high due to all the 5 star reviews, etc., but either way, I walked away feeling disappointed. We had an okay meal, but it was definitely nothing special.  The highlight would have to be the delicious 1/2 litre of Bellini.  The low point of our experience here is a toss up between being seated at a tiny table that was bumped by everyone who walked by, and the fact that I had to yell and try to read lips to communicate with my boyfriend.. who was a mere two feet away from me.  We came late at night, thinking it would be an off time and therefore less noisy.. but.. we were wrong.  I found the staff to be indifferent, with the exception of a waitress (not our waiter) who noticed us looking less-than-happy because we had not received our drinks or had our food order taken after having sat there for a good 20 minutes.  All in all, I'd go back here again but am in no hurry.  Based on my first experience, I think Quartino deserves a 2.5 (my boyfriend said 2), but given that I really liked our drinks, I rounded up."
"I loved this place. It was my last night in town post-conference and I'd been eating in that weird, disjointed conferencey way for three days. I wanted Italian. I wanted salumi. I wanted Italian wine, most of all. Quartino gave me everything I wanted. Hallelujah. We waited in the bar for a bit before dinner, and it was a typical Italian wine bar setting, with nice ambiance even though it was packed. The wine list is extensive and I loved that it told me the wines that Quartino is the only restaurant outside of Italy to serve. They could have been lying to me. I have no idea. But I wouldn't have cared. It made me feel special, and to be quite honest, I've rarely met an Italian wine I didn't like. Just the taste of a Montepulciano or a Chianti and some cheese, bread, and prosciutto, and I'm in heaven. The  salumi menu is extensive, and the pile of prosciutto I got was beautiful - fresh and not too salty. The Caprese was good and so were the olives. That was really all I needed. I never moved on to the entree, although my dinner companion did. I honestly don't remember much about her meal, as I was kind of zoned out on my own small (but actually kind of large!) plates. I'd go back to Quartino, and not just because the Italian options in DC are so sadly lacking (in my opinion). And if I'm the kind of tourist they're looking for, they found me."
"We probably didn't eat enough to warrant a true review, but I thought this place was just OK.  The food was good, but our server was a drag.  Try the polenta fries, which were unique and tasty with a roasted red pepper sauce.  Try to sit outside on the corner for great people watching."
"I've been hearing about this place for years, so I was pretty excited when I landed a reservation on new year's eve. The scene was every bit as crowded and loud as the other reviews will lead you to believe, but this is not your typical Italian-American restaurant, its an Italian tapas and wine bar....Its supposed to be loud I thought the food was fantastic, although my friends from out of town were not quite as impressed (I think they were expecting more of a spaghetti house type menu) If you go, I suggest you and your group try a handful of small plates and mix and match your dishes. The wine menu was amazing, and quite affordable too! Altogether, we ordered 6 small plates, (4) half carafats of wine and one desert to share, and the bill only came to $155. Altogether, I highly reccomend this place to just about anyone...Its fun, tasty, and different from just about any other Italian restaurant in the city. Just be prepared to try something new, and you'll have a great time"
"Very busy place, make sure you make reservations.  Service is fast and on point, food is good, not great.  I recommend the tortellini, all entrees come in small plates meant to be shared -- ambiance is rustic and LOUD."
"This place was all in all a fantastic venue for a group of seven women who probably had a little too much wine.  We ate for about 15 people as well with all of the fantastic appetizers, pastas, and we didn't skip dessert either.  All of the food was delicious, warm (when appropriate), and served in a timely manner even with the crowd. Our server was awesome, helpful, friendly and experienced. She really kept an eye on the table, our drinks, etc. Great service overall! I actually ended up planning an event for my company here after this experience. It was for 19 people and the folks at Quartino's were super accommodating. We also had the same incredible food, service and great experience. Will definitely continue to come back!"
"Truly Italian pizzas, super tasty and thin crust. Quick, nice and efficient service. A little bit noisy but perfect for a group of friends. The tiramisu is a must!"
"wouldn't call this a tapas bar, but it is definitely a very good and surprisingly authentic italian spot.don't let the location & touristy look fool you, the pasta is very tasty"
"i am a frequent customer at quartino, and it is often the first place i bring guests new to the city. i love the small plates style, the succulent olive oil, the amazing mozzarella, the incredible pasta... quartino certainly knows how to give the full experience, from the glass water bottles presented at the beginning of the meal to the postcard attached to the bill. but most importantly the food is fantastic and it is one of the truly good restaurants in that area, being that it is very touristy (theres actually a chilli's across the street, shudder.)one negative point- the restaurant can be extremely noisy. i recommend going upstairs for more ambience and quiet."
Love this place!!! fanastic food. A little loud but really fun when you go out with a large group of people.
"Food was really great here. Had the veal meatballs which were scrumptious. Gorgonzola cheese plate with the apricot puree was also tasty. Cavatella was also nice, but will probably order something else the next time. Ambiance a bit noisy unless you are looking for a place to watch a sporting event while you eat, but overall not bad.We're definitely planning on going back for more."
"When it takes one 29 hours to get to Chicago, where does one go first?No, no... not Fogo's.  After 29 hours of traveling, one does not have energy to eat at Fogo de Chao that night.One goes to a place like Quartino.  Italian tapas... kind of but not really.Eleven pm, and looking for a place to eat, Quartino comes through with shining colors.  They are opened until 2 AM (kitchen closes at 1 AM) and they offer an extensive wine list with truly excellent FOOD!  There are two menus -  one is ""regular style"" with another resembling tapas-style, consisting of many different little things you can add to an appetizer plate, like cheeses, salamis, prosciutto, salads, etc.  We ordered the asiago cheese, another cheese the waiter recommended, regular prosciutto and some delicious duck prosciutto.  YUM.  It came out with a lot of little sides to the appetizers - like candied fruit, cucumbers with lime, toast, apricot paste, grapes, etc.  We had a LOVELY bottle of 2003 Ruffino with the meal.  I loved, loved, loved this wine!!!The meal... We also ordered a pizza... a vegetarian pizza with a great crust and bursts of amazing flavor.  Also on our table was a terrific veal carpaccio.... holy bazookas, this is good stuff.  ALSO - we had TERRIFIC FONDUE.  Wow, was that good or WHAT?  Very heavy but you don't order fondue when you want something light.  :-)  Great cheese, with perfectly crisp bread and apples.  DELICIOUS.Obviously, we had no room for dessert ...........BUT THAT NEVER STOPPED US BEFORE, did it?So we ordered two desserts, a double espresso and a coffee to boot.  Desserts were amazing... espresso was good, coffee was weaker than I like but very flavorful.There is a definite feel at Quartino that resembles eating in Italy....  including patio dining and all.  Even when you eat indoors, the french doors are kept wide open to the outside, and it sort of feels like patio dining....... Ambience is dimly lit but rather semi-casual.  It's a place where you can come as dressed up or underdressed as you'd like and still fit in just fine.  Service was truly topnotch from our maitre'd to the waiters... our own waiter was spectacular, but even other waiters helped out immensely, made suggestions, clean up for us, etc.Quartino started off my Chicago trip with a bang, and if I had just a couple more days in Chicago than I do right now - -  I'd go back in a heartbeat.  WHAT A GREAT PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Oh, and an additional note - - any and ALL take-out wines are 50% off.  You can't beat that!!!!  Drink there, and then buy one to take back to the hotel at half the price.  PERFECT."
I thought this place was average at best. The pizzas were bland but the prosciutto wrapped dates were great and the service was too. However the noise level makes it extremely difficult to have a conversation. I thought it was an average touristy restaurant.
"I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't so overcrowded and touristy.  Also, don't believe the ""wine is cheaper than water"" slogan.  The food is excellent, though, especially the pizzas and the appetizer plates (tapas).I was very impressed with pizza they make here.  It's real, thin crust, Italian style pizza - after Follia, it's the best I've had in Chicago so far.  I also love the tapas here, which consist of a great collection of cheeses, meats, and olives - each with a little side item.I thought the service has been adequate every time I've gone.  The ambiance, however, isn't really what I was hoping for.  The restaurant is nicely decorated, but it gets very crowded and loud.  I would recommend going early for lunch and getting a seat outside.Finally, I was disappointed with the (cheap) wine.  Yes, they have two or three types that are really cheap, but they're awful.  All the other wines are basically priced the same you would pay at a typical Italian restaurant.  It's still not bad, but from the way they advertise cheap wine, I was expecting more."
"For $12.00 I had a glass of Wine, Salmon carpaccio and three huge slices of mushroom pizza - high quality food and great atmosphere.Location is excellent- this is a urban paced successful operation that cannot be flawed in any way - well by me and my friends anyway!Al the staff are groomed to perfection and bend over backwards to serve!Top Notch"
"We returned on a Saturday night - its very popular, and close to Michigan Ave -You used to get a separate paper to check off the appetizer plates you want - now you have to know what to order - the raisin bread, marmalade and grape salads are extras added to cheese, olives, and prosciutto (meats) always a fun place to start, but now you need to know to order this !We knew it was a tapas styled, and we ordered a margherita pizza - thin crust, basil fine, cheese had flavor, but not like a true Napoli margherita pizza.penne alla vodka - good portions,gnocchi with green beans - good portion, strong green bean flavor, and gnocchi a bit tough not rolled eithercheese tortillini - good portions served with proscuttioRaviolli - only got 6 small pillows of pasta - not nearly enough!!Red Sangria - bargain for $20 per Liter!  Very fruity, Desserts - strawberry with Chocolate Fondue - strawberries cut so are easy to manage - Chocolate Volcano Dessert - large portion - very good chocolate flavor, moist cake.Zeppole with honey - 8 small donuts, perfect for sharing, dip in chocolate or honey!!  5 Adults stuffed all for $120!As others have posted, it is hard to hear, and they do have TV monitors with movies and subtitles - you never know how the plates are going to come out, so service this time was slower than usual, but for the price and the food, it still works!"
"I cannot say enough good things about Quartino. Probably my favorite restaurant in the city. The only thing I miss about no longer living in River North is the fact that I can no longer visit this fine establishment every week or two. The Stefano and Rustica pizzas are the bomb and you can't go wrong with any of the pastas. Now, if only they would deliver."
"Upside:This place is very nice and located in the heart of the city.  Love the tapas and love, love, love gettting the list of fine italian meats and cheeses and olives to order from.  Yum.  good wine and good food.  Also, since it was busy we had some huge delays and the staff and manager handled it how they should- apologized profusely and sincerely and took wonderful care of us the rest of the night.  So kudos to them for a problem handled very well. The manager and staff really seemed to care.  Given all this I love it and go back often.Downside: really loud and touristy.  Its no calm relaxed dining experience.  It's also no surprising amazing experience for your tastebuds, just good solid food.  Also the pizza was just not good to me.  I am so spoiled by Spacca Napoli (ravenswood) amazing pizza that everything else is just kinda boring. Overall I like it alot and will be back."
"Okay, maybe I was really drunk or something last time I was here.  I came here sober a few weeks back, and I have to say I was disappointed.  While I really love their wine list and antipasti menu, the other dishes were really mediocre and overpriced compared to what I had experienced before.  The vibe is very cool, and I enjoy the atmosphere, but if I come back it will be only for a happy hour or something -  wine and meats/cheeses."
"Had dinner there but probably should have tried the one across the street and enjoyed a nice dinner.  It was just too packed to be enjoyable and feels like a wanna be place...We tried the grappa cured salmon w/ sweet & sour cucumbers.  The salmon was ok, it was thick small pieces...but the sweet & sour cucumbers were very good and refreshing.  For dinner, we had the Prosciutto d'Anitra pizza and the linguine w/ clam in white sauce.  The pizza was ok at best but the pasta was good, al dente."
"Quartino,You used to be so good before you raised your prices, reduced your portions, got rid of wonderful menu items, and jacked up your wine prices by two fold. Quartino used to be the place where me and the girls went to eat a wonderful dinner, drink great wine and have a savory desert for a reasonable price. Not so much anymore. The service used to be great. We had a wonderful server who we adored but now, a bitter and spiteful girl serves us. This girl once brought us the wrong salad. When I informed her that it was the wrong entree and was allergic to eggplant she asked ""Oh... and exactly what happens when you eat eggplant?"" I told her what my usual symptoms would be and when she came back with the right entree she said ""Don't worry, this one doesn't have eggplant in it."" In a highly sarcastic voice and then rolled her eyes before plopping the dish down.  It must have been love, but it's all over now."
"We just happened upon this place while roaming the streets of Chicago.  There was a bit of a wait and, as is with many downtown Chicago places, it's a little bit crowded.  We were seated in 10 minutes or so (at a pretty tiny table) and were waited on within  a reasonable amount of time.  This place is tapas.. small, yet shareable, size portions.  Food was very good except for the pizza.  Pizza was pretty ordinary, but I still think this place is worth the trip."
"So I'm not the biggest wine expert in the world. I went to Quartino, because I heard that the staff there is pretty good with folks like myself. I looked over the menu and asked our waiter what he thought would be good with the food I had in mind. I was a little disappointed when he was just like ""Well, this is usually what most people order..."" I guess I was looking for more of an elaborate explanation. I wound up ordering the biggest container expecting it to be a disappointing experience. The food came out and it all tasted great. Had the eggplant parmigiana, calamari, and linguine with clams. They all came out in smaller portions, and was definitely fun to share with another person. It's been packed the 3 times I've been there. They're really accommodating though. There was a time where my plans had changed, and I wanted to see if I could get a table a few hours before my reservation. They hooked it up. Good food, really social atmosphere, good wine (from what I could understand)...but they could do a little bit more with the not so savvy wine drinker like myself. OR I could just order beer..."
"I have been to Quartino several times over the past couple of years and every time has been  nothing but excellent!! I decided to write this review because I recently had my birthday dinner here and was just so impressed with how wonderfully everything was handled!! It was a saturday night and very busy in there. We had a large group of 17 people.  One might normally expect the service to suffer a little due to the busy night and a large group, however it did not!! It definitely surpassed my expectations!Our server was over to the table as soon as we were seated and made sure everyone that needed a drink got one promptly!! He then took the time to explain the menu and options for those who had not been there before.Everything came out shortly after we ordered and our waiter was always checking by to make sure we had everything we needed. Every item we ordered was delicious and pretty much devoured by everyone at the table!!The best part of the entire night was when the bill came and everyone was so pleasantly surprised by how cheap it was for all the delicious food and drink we had just consumed!! Nothing makes a birthday girl happier than when all her guests are so pleased!!Thank you Quartino for making my celebration such a success!! I will be back for sure!!"
"Best Italian restaurant in the city in my opinion.  Great food, good prices, great people watching.  It was the first restaurant I went to with friends when I moved here six months ago, and I try to go at least once a month.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!"
"Just got back from my second dinner at Quartino.  Once again, it's top-notch in taste for value.  The sausage pizza was a bit greasy, but the Asparagus Risotto was delicious, the fondue was good, the service was extremely attentive, there was no wait.  The time before this I went with a group of 8 and we literally ordered every food item on the menu.  I don't think there's anything on there that I wouldn't order again.Enjoy!"
"Liked the place - a lot of character, very good food, reasonable prices. Beware - it's very loud, so it's not for intimate dining. But a lot of fun!"
"Dinner at Quartino last night was excellent! I went with four other friends from work, which was perfect since their dishes are meant for sharing. You should definitely order the Scallops and Gnocchi.  By far my favorite dish was the Tortellini! Oh and their Bellinis are yummy. The French Martini was also good.I would agree with Sarah S.'s comment - the pizza wasn't all that spectacular, which is why I wouldn't give this 5 stars. All in all an excellent place for dinner with a group of friends!"
I went to this place for a friend's b-day party. Our group had about twenty people in it. I was really impressed with the restaurant and I'm glad that I was able to try it.   The waiters were very friendly and very attentive. I was shocked by how crowded the place was. We were there on a Saturday night though.  I felt like I was at a celebrity hot spot. We waited in the bar for about 15 minutes before we were seated. We ate from a set menu.  I never had Italian Tapas before. It was great though.Here is a menu of what we had:Salad/Italian breadMeatballsPastaSteakAsparagus RisottaScallops CalamariRed WineDessert-Ice Cream for the b-day girl
"Wow this place has alot of reviews!!! And a Yelp Sponsor? Hmm...the pieces are falling in place. But hey, Kudos to them for recognizing the importance marketing. Went on a date with the boyfriend, and sat at a high-top near the bar. The food was great, especially the Fonduta and the pizza's. The atmosphere was cozy, no frills, and loud- but it all contributed to a fun and lively ambiance."
"Quartino is always a great place to go to chill, especially during late nights: drinking massive amounts of wine and munching on funghi pizza & penne a la vodka! :)"
"From bachelorette parties to birthdays to just girls night out; this place is the go-to restaurant for locals and out-of-town guests! Thin crust pizza, polenta fries with red pepper dipping sauce, mushroom risotto, veal meatballs, baby spinach salad--YUM. Its always busy, always loud and crazy, and you always bump into someone you know, but the food is awesome, the vibe has such energy, and you never end up spending much moola. Quite the catch you are, Quartino."
"I was here for a company party and wasn't necessarily impressed with the place. It just reminded me of every other chain place in the city, with the purchased ambiance (see: replica antiques) and feeling that I could have probably felt a little more comfortable. Setting a table large enough for our extra large party would have been a good start. We had some water issues as well. The food in general was good, I had the shrimp in olive oil and butter - extremely tasty and we started with the antipasto sampler. Everyone at the table ordered something different and sampled all around. Personally, I really, really, really dislike tapas style dining with more than two people. I find it cumbersome and exhausting. Everyone else seemed satisfied, so maybe I'm just a sourpuss. I can see myself going back here, but not with a large group!"
"This is a local favorite of mine. Sitting outside is a must during the summer.A lot has been said about this restaurant so I'm just going to make recommendations from the menu:1. Get the Cavatelli (it's really dumplings but they're phenomenal!)2. Pizza selection is diverse. I recommend the Funghi, Quattro Stagione, and the Rustica.3. The Profiteroles are amazing. And the Zeppoli are damn good too.4. The Siciliano Salad (only served at lunch) is great.This place is great. If you don't know what wine to order, just ask."
"We had an event at The Casino club over on Delaware one evening, and decided to finally try Quartino for dinner. Let me get the nitpicking negatives out of the way first -- they were significant, and could be important to you depending what your mood is for the evening.First: the place is insanely crowded with no ambience...it is a classic River North restaurant in that it is a blend of downtown-destined locals, trend-setting visitors and rag tag tourists. Seriously weird vibe guest-wise. BUT -- let's be honest: all of Rome feels that way, too, so it's not a bad thing (and what restaurant owner wouldn't want a busy place?).Second -- the worst tables and chairs in restaurant history. One of the other writers mentioned this, but at one point we had plates in our LAPS, on a railing, and in the server's hands. There is no room at the table, and the chairs are ridonkulously uncomfortable (unless you manage to steal a pleather-cushioned one away from a 6-top...I'm just sayin').Now -- the best part? The food is amazing. Seriously. I could find nothing wrong with a single thing we ordered...I don't know if the rest of you do this now, but I actually have Yelp in mind when we go out to eat! So we ordered extra things just to try...The 'salumeria' was a great idea, and I ordered a lonzino (dried pork loin) and three different cheeses. All were great -- and the candied fruit, giardiniera and cucumbers were a nice treat. We also ordered the now-famous caprese (freshest mozzarella in the city), shrimp risotto, rucolina pizza (arugula on pizza rules...), and calamari. There were at least 20 other things on the menu I wanted to try!!!The wine selections were great, the service was excellent and attentive, and the valets were fast and effective....If it weren't for the LOUD, crowded room (replete with 80's permed Disney character-sweater fanny-pack wearing tourists), and the tiny tables and prison-caliber chairs, this would be my new favorite restaurant!"
"I went with a group of four on Valentine's Day. I must say, reservations were a GREAT help. No wait whatsoever. We had the fettechini alfredo, home farm chicken, and a split pizza - sausage and cheese.Hopefully you're lucky enough to get Zack. He was super funny and really helped us in picking our food since none of us had ever been there. All in all, definitely try the pizza. Superbly done."
"Amo Quartino!!GREAT food, GREAT wine, GREAT atmosphere. If you can, try to sit outside if it's nice.  I usually come with a group of girlfriends, and I've never spent more than $25 or $30 each including tip, and I always walk out full and happy (and a little tipsy from all that wine!).Their house white is cheap and great - $16 for the full carafe, and they have this red called Lambrusco ($20 for the big carafe) that is light, slightly bubbly and served a little bit chilled - definitely different but in a very good way!A few of my favorite dishes:Eggplant Bruschetta (!!!)Veal MeatballsTortellini - with cream sauce, peas, and prosciuttoCaprese salad - best I've had outside ItalySea ScallopsDefinitely make a reservation, it's always busy."
"Great corner location in the Gold Coast with outdoor seating and a beautiful vintage-y interior with tiled walls, antique silverware/plates and a great view of the kitchen.Since service was fast and friendly, the only star deductions are (sadly) for food. While I tried a number of good things: polenta fries, the bellini, some great pasta that had basil and fresh ricotta, gelato with hazelnuts...the pizza marguerita was not so great (I asked the waiter to box up the leftovers, but on second though left them behind at the table when I got up to go)--and some of the prices are a bit steep...especially considering that I split everything with the sister.Overall, the atmosphere and drink list are the real winners...and I'm just not sure that's enough to bring me back."
"Ever time I've been here it has been a wonderful experience!  I used to go at night around 11pm.  Almost each time we've been given something on the house, a glass of wine ( or two) an appetizer etc..One time they were trying out new apps. and brought 4 to our 4 top!!I've also have had lunch there a number of times.  Everything has been above average, and the prices are VERY reasonable. I love the duck prociutto (sorry about the spelling) and the garlic white bean spread.  The pizzas have been great, as well as the ceasar salad.  The service is always friendly, sometimes exceptional.  They even sell wine by the bottle to go, a few  for $6.00.  I have absolutley nothing bad to say about this place. ( And no, I don't work there)"
"This is my GO TO for big groups. We had a grad party here, and they treated us phenomenally. Great food, exceptional service. Thank you Q!"
"I had a friend from out of town staying at a hotel in the area so we decided on Quartino's. On all levels, service, food, wine and atmosphere, we were not disappointed.It was a Tuesday night and our group was immediately seated without reservations. Yes, the tables are close together and the London underground tile on the walls doesn't help the acoustics, but we were in the mood for a fun and lively place.The only problem is that with all the choices, ordering can be daunting, but that's a good thing. I was really pleased with the resulting variety of textures and flavors, and even temperature - hot vs cold. Our wine was excellent because one person in our party knew what to pick. Our server was great.WIth tax, tip and about a bottle of wine per person, the bill came to about $50 per head. All in all a very pleasant experience."
"All my friends really like coming here, so we always end up here for birthday dinners. I don't mind it, it's one of the better places around the hood. and I love the idea of sharing. Our servers are always pretty easy going. I've pretty much tried everything on the menu, so safe to say, everything is pretty good!The prices are reasonable, and I love the huge girl's restroom."
"Loved Quartino! Really good food and really decent prices. And the idea of small plate italian food is excellent! You get to try a little of everything.They serve wine (and sangria mmm) by the carafe, and have a HUGE wine list. We opted to go for the less expensive wines, but their list goes from $15 carafes to $70-80) so there's something for everyone.Between three of us, we decided to get:1 carafe house Pinot Grigio (really good)1 carafe red sangria (also pretty good)1 Margherita Pizza (PS pizzas are big, lots of food right there)The fondue (the best part of the meal in my opinion. It's a white cheese fondue and it comes with bread cubes, but for a little extra, you can get fruit and veggies on the side, sooo good)And the Cavatappi (hand rolled pasta with ricotta cheese mixed in, really good).The pasta plate was perfect for sharing with three. We probably would have been fine with two dishes, the portions are a good size. Best part of the night: For all of that our total bill, $66! I was shocked to find such great italian food and wine with such a small bill. Awesome! My new favorite spot for sure.The only reason for a loss of one star: It is loud here. Granted we went at 7:00 on a Friday night, but it was very loud and hard to have a good conversation. Plusses however, awesome food, amazing prices, attentive servers, takes reservations (and were on top of it, we were seated right away), and small plate Italian food is the best idea ever.Everything was very authentic tasting and I would absolutely love to go back and try more things on their menu. My one major recommendation: Get the fondue. It's amazing."
I really really enjoy this restaurant. I would comfortably call it some of my favorite food in the city. That is if I am trapped downtown. I love the food. LOVE it. everything is good. The wine list is overwhelming and served in liters. It is overall delicious. Here are the things that made me vasilate between 3 and 4 stars and end up with 3: if you have reservations they seat you with ease however the tables are too close together and small if you have a larger group. It might be the loudest restaurant ever. I went there with work people and I am pretty sure my ears are still ringing. If you read any of my other reviews you would know that this is a major pet peeve with me. The food is excellent served family style which I love. There is no reason not to go here if you dont mind taking a cab or are already over here. Don't drive here! The wine is too good to worry about driving home.
"Quartino is the perfect place if you are looking for: small plates to share, an environment where your group can be loud (read: not obnoxius), a nice selection of wines, discounts on bottles, a place that is happening/active on the weekend nights and is open late.  They have the best balsamic vinegar accompanying the bread.  The mushroom risotto, veal meatball sliders, fondue, and cheese/olive platter, and any desserts are a few things to try.  And don't forget their limoncello martini - soooo good."
"Our waitress was super nice. The quattro formaggio pizza was great and the wine was reasonably priced and decent. We are Italian, though, and were a little confused by the heaps of spinach and cabbage on our pizzas. Kind of ruined it for us. Too loud, too, like the other reviewers said."
I'm actually not  huge Italian fan but i like this place because of it's great menu selections. Carpaccio is amazing. Fish is fresh. And they have a great cheese selection. Overall a good experience.
"Came here with a group of six after a concert and it was perfect! It's like tapas but with Italian food. One of the gals we were with was familiar with the menu so she ordered for us... I think we started with a salumeria tasting plate and on it was some of the best sopressata I have ever tasted. We also had a pizza, asparagus risotto, meatballs, and i think the polenta fries, but I really loved the pastas.  I'm definitely gonna come back next time I want to catch up with friends!"
Now my favorite Italian restaurant!  Been there 4 times in two months!
"This is a great place for a group dinner, but make sure to make reservations, not that that always helps.  They don't really honor their reservation time, it's more of a ""guideline""However,  it's a great place for small plates and it's fun to have so many tastes.One huge complaint is that it is SOOOOO loud in there.  It's like you're in a rock concert."
"Excellent that saved our butt at midnight!  Great food and wonderful selection.  House wine yummy and wait staff was friendly, even at that hour of the night.  I would definitely eat here again and would also recommend to anyone looking for a quality alternative to late night Chicago bar food."
"My husband and I stopped by Quartino for lunch on our way out of town.  We were there a little before 11 am but the posted hours didn't have them opening until 11:30 am.  We were quite disappointed since we were on a tight timeline.  Luckily, the chef saw us and had us seated despite the time.  We even got sat outside which drew more and more people for lunch - they didn't turn anyone away.  We were really impressed.The food was great as always - I love to start with the antipasta platter so I can sample the cured meats and olives.  The value is unbelievable.  I will definitely be back!  It can get loud at night though so if anyone is hard of hearing in crowded places, it may be frustrating to carry on a conversation."
"seriously? who approved these recipes? the polenta fries were underwhelming, and not Italian. The veal meatballs napoli were completely awful, the taste was so gamey. And the worst? tagliatelle bolognese (pasta with meat sauce), which I've had all of my life in new york, Italy, etc...they didn't even come close to how it's supposed to taste. The ONLY decent thing I would ever come back for is the pizza, but then again, how hard is it to screw up pizza?"
"Perfect for large groups.  The staff is extremely accomodating and even helped us work out our menu for 16 people in advance.  They have a great drink special for $20 where you can add all-you-can drink wine and beer.  The rustica pizza is awesome and so are the polenta frieds.  Cheese fondue is also delicious.  My only complaint is that the place is crazy loud, but there's a good chance our group was partially the blame."
"Loved, loved, loved Quartino's!  We had called in advance to reserve our table for 11 at 9:45.  We got there at 9:45 but were missing a couple of girls and they wouldn't seat us until everyone came.  Well, we were all there and still had to wait twenty minutes.  Three of us were outside and a worker must have heard me complaining because the manager came over to me and told me that he would give us a free carafe of bellinis after dinner to thank us for waiting.  I was definitely not expecting that but was very happy and surprised as things like that never happen.  We were seated and our waiter was great-always bringing in wine when we needed it and recommending pizzas for us.  We ended up getting four pizzas to split and they were all delicious!!  At the end of the night, our bill was only $10 a piece to pay-and that was with a $30 tip.  The manager delivered our bellinis as promised and gave his card to my friend and I who live in Chicago (the rest were visiting) and told us to call him personally if we ever needed anything again.Amazing service for such a busy place, one lost star because of the reservation debacle."
"I go to Quartino almost once a month for dinner and drinks - you can't go wrong with this place!  I've been there with my family and girlfriend for dinner, and with friends for my birthday.  With four people, we always get one or two pizzas, a few pasta dishes and a few desserts to share.  Of course, you can't forget the 3-4 carafes of house wine (2 red/2 white)!  For my birthday, there were about 15 of us and we got a big table in-between the bar and the downstairs dining room - good times!  The service is fast and friendly, exactly like you would want it.  If you haven't been, go there this Friday.  If you're already been there, then I'm sure you've already made plans to go back!"
Loved it!  Really quick service and absolutely amazing food.  One of the few Italian places that gets risotto right.
"Tapas, Italian-style? Way too cool. I was NOT in the mood for Italian when my boyfriend suggested Quartino, but I was starving, it was close, and nothing else was open... and, in the end, I had to thank him for ""dragging"" me there, because we had an awesome time and everything was super good!I was by far the most excited about the cheese fondue appetizer. So good. We didn't get any of the extras to dip in it, just bread, and there wasn't QUITE enough, so I recommend saving some of the sliced bread they bring out initially to dip in the fondue later.I was also very excited about the concept of sharing, since it allowed me to try more dishes. We went for the cavatelli and the gnocchi, both of which were very tasty. I definitely could have eaten more, because the dishes are pretty small (and cheap!) but instead we got dessert... MORE FONDUE! If dark chocolate fondue is on the dessert menu, I'm going to order it. We got it with strawberries and bananas, and it was good but really rich and we couldn't finish it.The wine was all cheap, too, which of course I love. The boy tried some sort of champagne concoction which he didn't like very much, but I did. We had great service, and the whole restaurant has a lively, fun atmosphere. I definitely want to go back and try more!"
Excellent food. Excellent service. Would definitely go back!
Really captures the feel of a European café. Awesome.
"I've been to Quartino twice, and I've had great experiences both times.  The first time I went with a big group for a friend's birthday.  Considering the size of our party, and it being all loud/ a little tipsy groups of girls, our service was great as was our experience.  The food is delicious!  You really can't go wrong.  Sangria is great for large parties.  Be sure to check out their Wines of the Month, that are only $20 a bottle, such a steal.  The second time I went, I went with my boyfriend on a week night after work.  It was very crowded, considering it was a Thursday night around 6 pm.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive.  He was helpful with the menu as well.  We ordered the pancetta wrapped dates with goat cheese, which was ridiculously awesome.  We also had the brushcetta (which was good, but not amazing), a side of sauteed spinach (awesome!), and we split a pizza (half sausage/ half funghi)/. The sausage half of the pizza was awesome!  We split a bottle of their Pinot Noir of the month, definitely $20 well spent.  Quartino is delicious, great service, and bang for your buck."
"went with a group of 12 last week, we all enjoyed the experiencestarted off with a italian reserve wine which was full bodied and went well with all the dishesthe best part of having 12 ppl is we can order a lot of dishes to try and the highlights were: the cheeses, the duck prisciutto, the mushroom pizza, the grilled octopus, tortellini, penne a la vodka and short ribgreat atmosphere, attentive service (even for a big group), a good place for get togethers definitely"
"Mother's Day - and although it was fairly packed, we received an outstanding greeting at the door and friendly service.  I do feel alittle chubby today after chowing on the pizza, cheese plate and caprese and let's not forget the bread and wine.  They were out of the skate that night, but we were already kinda full - so we opted for desserts instead as there was no stopping us now.  In all fairness, I think I will have to try this place again and not fill up on the aforementioned dishes and try more of the small plates.There were alot of families, so the ambience was probably more subdued than I can imagine this place gets on a Friday night."
"This. Place. Is. Amazing. Got some pizza, bruchette, and $20 bottle of Pinot noir. Left drunk and so satisfied. Perfect for a date or big group of friends. I loved the atmosphere. The Quattro Stagioni= perfection. Our waiter was very knowledgable and friendly. We couldn't have had a better experience."
Great food selection. Wine was awesome and the bill was relatively inexpensive for the amount of wine and food that we ordered. Highly recommend but make a reservation as it's always crowded.
"Went there last night for dinner.  Knowing it was pretty loud, I asked for a more intimate seating.  They have a small dining room which seats 10 people.  It is perfect for those that don't want to be in a noisy environment.We made reservations for 7:30 and were seated promptly.The food was delicious.  We hade a homemade pasta dish (incredible); a mushroom risotto (heavenly) and sea scallops (melt in your mouth).  Loved the choices of wine in either liter, 1/2 liter or 1/4 liter.  Outstanding!  Will be coming back!"
"Consistant, casual, classy, lively, small plates, inexpensive, friendly, options, and fun. These are all words I think of when thinking of Quartino. I have been here many times, always with friends, and have enjoyed it every time. This place is truly amazing. Many of the people I know tout this as their favorite restaurant. I have yet to meet anyone who simply does not like it. The food is great, the service is friendly (they must treat their employees well), and the atmosphere is fun. Nice wine list. Try the duck pasta. You will not be disappointed!"
"A friend and I went over to Quartino for the first time last night and it was fantabulous.  Tapas, small plates - the idea isn't new.  But Quartino's is an exceptional experience of great small plates and little samplers of wine.  The concept works really well here.I have little to no experience concerning italian cuisine and wines.  So the server was very helpful with his suggestions.  Though some were misses (i.e. the hard cheese and really, really salty olives), there were great hits as well.  We thoroughly enjoyed the sea scallops and the duck proscuitto.The bellini was lightly sweet and fizzy.  And the wine (I forget which one...must check on that soon) went well with the stronger dishes.  The dessert was...eh.  Vanilla ice cream, banana, and shaved chocolate.  But the meal itself was superb."
"Celebrated my birthday here two weekends ago. I LOVED the food and the service. I would definitley go back. My only reason for four stars (instead of five) is that the kitchen kept sending out the wrong food and duplicated food. In the middle of our dessert, we received two orders of gnocchi. I attributed this to growing pains (they'd just been reviewed in Crain's) and extra busyness (it was a primetime Saturday night and marathon weekend). Food-wise, the Margherita pizza was delicious. The Angus Carpaccio was so smooth and tasty, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Asparagus Risotto. I did taste the Mushroom Risotto from a friend's plate and I thought it was a little overseasoned. The little donuts (I forgot the right name for them) were delicious, as was the special birthday sorbet cup they gave me. Their wine list is very good (according to a sommilier (sp?) friend who joined us), but the wine list given at the table doesn't list the ""special"" wines on the chalkboard outside the restaurant. There was some confusion there. That said, they really made good on this. They took two bottles of wine off of our (very large party's) check, and were nothing but apologetic. I really would go back (many times!)."
"I went to Quartino on a Thursday.  It was packed but with a party of 7, it was smart to make reservations.  First the food was great (3/4).  We ordered 10 dishes for 7 of us and it was very filling.  The only dish that I didn't enjoy were the scallops.  The sauce was too acidic for my tastes and it lacked flavor.  The Ravioli was great along with the country chicken.  The fondue was decent but if you order it, definitely get the apples for dipping.  Dessert and Wine were also very good (3/4).  The 1L carfes are nice and a pretty good deal.Service was friendly and prompt.  The cadence at which the food came out enabled us to leisurely chat and eat at the same time.  There was no silence in our conversations because the main dishes were served - major plus for me.Downstairs was loud and the upstairs seemed quieter.  Prices we're definitely reasonable.  2 ""courses"" and 2L wine for around $250."
"I'm going to have to fully agree with all 100 yelpers who have raved about Quartino...**thank you for the suggestion** ...Took a friend I haven't seen in ages here last night and it really was a fantastic dinner. We started with the olive sampler (who knew I even liked olives? NOT ME) and the gorgonzola cheese ... ummm, i love you gorgonzola. The cheese was paired with grapes, this amazing apricot sauce-like substance, and a cucumber thingy ... the combination of flavors was perfection. For the main course we ordered the spinach pizza and then the Orecchiette ...  I very much preferred the pasta over the pizza, but both were delicious. The pizza was a basic cheese pizza topped with fresh spinach, nothing out of the ordinary. Everything, including 1/4 carafe of wine each (equivalent to just over a glass) cost each of use with tip only $26. Now THAT is a deal. On the way home I offered my leftovers to a homeless man. He replied with ""I don't like Italian ..."" Silly man, he missed out on some delicious leftovers!"
Good choices for vegetarian .. decent prices .. open late .. great service .. will highly recommend for family & friends
"Went here for late lunch with a friend and thought it was quite good.  There were only a few other tables at around 4pm, so if you want to avoid the noise the other reviewers experienced, go around this time.The only problem we had with Quartino was deciding what to order, which is why I think it's better suited to larger groups.  If you have more people in your party, you can order more and then you get to sample a lot more of the menu.   Anyway, we had the duck proscuitto, tuna carpaccio, spinach/walnut/pear salad, and the cavatelli pasta.  I liked the duck proscuitto, it came with some interesting accompaniments, but they were tasty.  The tuna carpaccio wasn't what I expected...it came with a roasted pepper ""stew"", and I thought it overwhelmed the flavor of the tuna.  Loved the spinach salad, it was simply dressed but very fresh.  My favorite was the cavatelli...rich ricotta, flavorful but not overwhelming sauce, and doughy texture of the pasta was perfect...a lot like an Italian version of comfort food/mac and cheese.  I had to be at work so no wine this time, but I'll be back (with a bigger group!).Update: came here when my parents were in town and had a fabulous dinner.  The pizza was wonderful, crust was just right and toppings delish. We tried a lot of the different cheeses and I thought all of them were great.  The bellinis were soooo good!  The only drawback was how close together the tables were and it got quite noisy during peak dinner hours!   Still loving this place!"
"I came here with very high hopes as I had heard great reviews from my colleagues and friends, however great the wine was, I was quite dissappointed in the meal itself.  We had ordered the Soprano pizza (a slightly awkward pizza with meatballs and crisp veggies, sounds good, but wasn't that great), roasted eggplant spread (the best thing we had, delicious!), portabello mushroom bruschette (mediocre), crisp calamari (unfortunately a little soggy when it arrived), ravioli (very tasty) and orechiette (tasty as well). Overall, including the 2 bottles and 2 half liters of wine , 6 of us paid $35 each which was decently priced.  Outside of a great wine menu, I feel the food was not too special."
"This was such a fun dining experience. A massive yet cozy dining room and excellent service. I ordered a huge cappuccino to begin with and was glad I did. Everything we had was good but the beef filets and the veal meatball sliders were high points. The short ribs melted in your mouth, so good but soooo filling! The sausage risotto was maybe a little mushy but very flavorful and mixed excellently with slices of the beef filet. I will be dreaming about those veal sliders and for two bucks a slider they were worth every delicious cent. I had no room left over for dessert. Excellent wine prices, I guess I can't say enough good things about this place. I feel like I ate the world and I can't wait to go back."
"Went here with my lady for lunch on a beautiful Tuesday afternoon after the museum and before class.  We shared a pizza (delicious) and a small plate of cavatelli.  The plates of pasta are pretty small, appetizer size, but the pizzas are a good size.  For dinner you would have to get a few plates, but for lunch sharing two plates was sufficient.  They have an extensive wine list and the service was pretty good.  If the weather is nice sit outside, it has great people watching.  For the two plates and the carafe of wine everything came in under $50."
"Only had a chance to get a few antipasto, which were a let down."
"I'd say 3.5 stars.  I've been so many times and I must admit, it sort of gets worse each time!  The only thing that keeps me coming back is the food.  It very popular these days and there's always a significant wait, even for the bar area.  It's always a spur of the moment place for me so I don't think of reservations though the most recent time I went, we had actually called ahead and it still took about 30 minutes to seat us.  Also, why exactly do they need three hostesses up at the front?  From what I can see, none of them do anything in particular.  The food is still good, the pizzas are probably the best thing there, thin crust and true italian style (dinner-plate sized and sparing with the toppings, a good thing, trust me).  The tuna carpaccio is a joke, it's 4 slices that might be 1 inch x 1 inch in an overpowering tomato sauce.  The pastas and risottos haven't disappointed me yet.  The entrees are hit or miss, grilled veal skirt steak was perfectly cooked with a tasty roasted tomato salad while the duck leg was dry and kinda gross.  The skate wing has been perfect on one occasion, inedible to the point of being sent back the next.  Do get olives and items from the salumeria, excellent.  We've had the same waitress twice (sarah?) and she is a delight.  Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, she's always able to make me forget the rude staff at the bar and front of house.  Good value if you order well ($100 for three people including a mezzo of wine).  I wouldn't go out of my way for this place, but I'd stop by if I was in the area."
"OMIGOD, DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?? I CAN' T HEAR YOU!! That was the basic feel of of a 8-pp group dinner here one Friday night. They had a good table for us but two big problems, A) it was SOOO crowded and loud, we couldn't have any normal conversation. B) It was ALL tapas/sharing portions. You couldn't order a basic entree for your self, they made it clear that you needed to order a bunch of things and they come to your table...when they come. If I had known this I would have picked someplace different. I HATE tapas--I find it the biggest tease of a meal. Will not return next time I am in Chicago--it seemed to be like a fancy Macaroni Grill, w/maybe tastier appetizers. Crappy deserts, as well."
"we came here on thurs night and it was PACKED.  good thing we had a reservation, b/c i don't know how we would have gotten in otherwise.  we got there earlier than our 830 reservation but were seated pretty promptly at 830.  we got a drink at the bar while waiting, and we could have eaten there, but the loudspeaker was right above us, so we waited for our table.for two of us, we shared a popeye pizza, polenta fries, the broccoli raab, and an arugula and orange salad.  service was super prompt, considering how crowded the place was.  everything was good, but i was surprised that the spinach on the pizza was just slightly wilted.  i thought it would have been more cooked.  the polenta fries were delish.  we should have known that midwesterners eat pretty hefty portions, b/c we had a ton of leftovers after this.  however, we of course ordered the hot choc cake w/ vanilla gelato for dessert, which hit the spot.  after dinner, i was so full that i immediately passed out at the hotel."
"Certainly a ""hot spot"" on a Friday night in Chitown. If you're looking for big city ambiance than this is your place. If you're looking for great Italian food and service this is not your place. We were seated promptly after wading thru the chaos of the hostess desk. The place was packed to the gills, both the bar and restaurant. The best food we had were the antipasto small plates. The main course pasta dishes themselves (lamb and shrimp risotto) were a disappointment. They felt like they had been prepared that morning. They probably had been given the volume of tables they serve. There's no way to make quality, fresh food at a place this large that turns this many tables. I would reco against if you're looking for a solid Italian dinner. I would reco for if you're looking for a cheap night with some friends over a bottle of red at a place bursting with ambiance."
"Inexpensive food and wine! , good service, lively atmosphere but can be loud depending if your table location. Upstairs seems to be more quiet. Either way I'm a fan!"
"I can't say enough about this place!  I've been there with my mom, for a big dinner with a large group of friends, and for an after-work drink.  Each time, the wine is cheap, the cheese fondue is amazing, and we have great service.  I suggest the cheese fondue, and any risotto on the menu."
"This place is great fun on a Sat. night during the dinner rush.  Use their valet parking (only $8) & save the headaches of searching for parking or the El.  This place has decent ambience and a great wait staff, but most importantly delicious light italian fare.The prices are actually pretty cheap, so go nuts and get a bunch of dishes.  I really enjoyed the grilled octopus, the seared tuna (raw in the center & melts in your mouth - delectable!), and a ravioli stuffed with a seasoned pork.  Really though, anything here would be good I imagine.  The wine is good with a decent selection.  I went with my sis who is in the wine biz, so consquently more than half our bill was liquor.  If you stick to a single bottle of good wine, you can easily do the whole evening, dessert, parking & tip for under $80-100 for 2 people.  Not bad.The downstairs is more happening than the upstairs.  They also have outdoor seating for when the weather's nice.  Make reservations too or you'll never get a table during the rush."
This place is great! My mom and I went here before heading out to the opera. Great service and wonderful food. Very loud and busy! Lots of fun for groups because you can choose to order lots of little dishes and share. Definitely make a reservation!
"Good food; Good wine; Good service!We had the polenta fries *yummy*. (How could fried starch ever be bad?) , a pizza with veggies and the gnochhi!The pizza crust was thin and flat; (definitely rolled!) but very tasty and the sauce and cheese were well seasoned.The gnochhi with the arugula pesto was very fresh and good. The service was great and the wine recommendation was spot on.The overall look of the place and the open atmosphere was very relaxing and there are some great people watching opportunities."
"LOVE IT!  The food is great and their Belletini (peach nectar and sparkling wine) is excellent.  It's a fun place to go with friends and sample A LOT of different foods.  Cured meats, cheeses, olives, antipasti, pizza - it's all good and won't cost a small fortune.  I also recommend the house made Lemoncello as an after dinner liqueur.You should eat here!"
"The only thing keeping me from giving Quartino five stars is that I didn't get to sit down and enjoy a full meal.  But what I can tell you is that the wine, food and service I got to experience during a recent wine tasting event was perfecto!  Just a bite of their pizza definitely has put Quartino at the top of my list of a dinner night out."
"Love this place!   Very casual.....great pizza, pastas and even other entrees. The portions are smaller , but so is the price.  I'm tired of going to places that serve you so much food that pay so much more for, and end up taking it home and just doesn't reheat the same.  This place is always busy, and there's a good reason for it.  Good food, at a good value, and the service is always very accomodating....even with substitutions."
"What a letdown.  I wasn't impressed with Quartino, and had high hopes from what I had heard from others - and from other reviewers. Not Impressed with:* Loudness of the place.* The server's balk at our request for separate checks.* The arbitrary process at which appetizers/entrees come out to your table.Yes, it's busy (even for a Monday night), but man the acoustics here BLOW.  I felt like I had to scream just to be heard at my table, and my voice can normally carry. I came here with two other co-workers (on business travel) so we requested separate checks for expense report purposes, but not without this big fuss about how it would be easier for him if he didn't have to.  Whatever!!  After assuring the server, that that is the only way that's acceptable to us, and why we were asking, he went to go see if he can do it.  It was explained to us that the way they do it at Quartino is that entrees and appetizers all come out as soon as they're cooked.  That means they bring out your food out of order and whenever they feel like it.  It wasn't till the end of the meal that we realized we didn't receive a dish.  We asked about it, and he explained that the ravioli simply wasn't done cooking yet (read: they forgot about the ravioli).  Puhleaze.Other than that the food was pretty good.  In particular I enjoyed the proscuitto alfredo tortellini, the pizza with sausage and giardiniera, and polenta fries.  Would I go back?  Probably not.  I'm sure service is better elsewhere.  No thanks."
"I just do not understand the popularity of this place.  So-so Italian food, the loudest restaurant I have ever been in, and a wait staff with an attitude that would make someone from New York city cringe.  Had reservations for 7:30 for 3 of us on a weeknight, not weekend.  Place was less tan half full when we arrived but were still kept waiting for 15 minutes before we were seated.  The table was in an alcove the connects the bar the the main dining room.  Felt like I was on the Edens at Rush hour.Waiter asked if anyone woould like drinks.  I order the 1/4 carafe of wine ($15!!) and my wife and son decided to pass on booze.  The look on the waiter's face would have made you believe that someone just shot his puppy.  We ordered 4 or 5 small plates and told our waiter that after we were done with those we would be ordering some additional items.  None of the plates were bad, but none were especially memorable either.  We finished the first round and the waiter shows up and asks if we would like coffee or dessert?  When I said 'no"" and then began to remind him that I had told him we would be ordering more items, he disappeared and returned with our check.  Did the parking meter on my table expire?  Had I forgotten to bathe?  When will I be back? Never.  I'm spending more and more time at restaurants in the city's neighborhoods and avoiding dining downtown.  Just too much hassle"
"Not a fan of Quartino!I live in the area and have been there half a dozen times with friends. I like Italian but I haven't found anything great on the menu.If I wanted Pizza, I'd go next door to Via Stato or a few blocks over to La Madia!The idea of ""Italian Tapas"" is great, small portions of Italian foods to share, but this place is a waste of a meal and money."
"Let's play a game.  It's called ""How much did you spend on a big group dinner?"" (Knowing that it's always wayyyy too much.)My group of 10 ate/drank the following: four liters of wine, two pizzas, three pastas, meat/cheese plate, two beef tenderloins, two fondues, five desserts, and so much more I can't remember right now.  So...how much did we spend?  $36 PER PERSON (with 20% tip)!!  Are you kidding me right now? I love this place.  Been three times now.  My most recent visit was great--made a rezzie earlier in the week for Friday night.  Was graciously offered the ""Wine Room.""  It was perfect.  My favorite place in Chi-town by far.  I cannot think of a place where you get a better value for delicious, fun food."
"Prices are great here for both wine and food - tough to beat in this neighborhood - but the food was just OK.  Actually it was probably less than OK being as salty as it was but I was won over by the service and the fairly low prices.  We had meatball sliders (easily the best part of the meal), a salad (bitter & salty), an octopus appetizer (just OK), the ravioli (very salty) and a clam linguini (just a little too salty).  I probably would've 1 starred this place but this all cost less than $40 so I wasn't going to complain.  What I will complain about is that there was a bathroom attendant in this place.  Not that the attendant was rude - he was very polite and professional - but a place like this really has no business having a bathroom attendant ever - especially on a Wednesday night.  The decor is totally  ""Italian Farmhouse"" and meant to be casual dining.  I didn't remember seeing an entree over $25 on the menu.  The napkins they use are friggin kitchen towels!  (they even feel like they were probably used in the kitchen - not good)  The last thing I want to do when I go relieve myself is to have some guy watching me and waiting to serve me.  Maybe I'm a little petty - but the bathroom attendant was pretty much ends any likelihood I'll be back.  But if they got rid of that and laid off the salt a bit, this place could easily make 4 stars."
The sausage pizza is great and the wine selection is very good. It does get a little noisy but nothing you can't handle. Service is good. Ambiance is great. I would have liked some more coaching on the build your own antipasti. Go on a weeknight to beat the crowd.
"I had the most delightful meal here. My girlfriends and I split a lot of wine, the veggie pizza, the asparagus risotto, and the mushroom bruschetta. We finished the evening with bellinis and chocolate fondue. The food was amazing, the atmosphere was upbeat (don't come here if you're looking for a quiet meal in a small restaurant) the staff was delightful. I can't wait to go back!P.S. I was delighted when I only had to pay 30 bucks at the end of the meal!"
"this was a great restaurant, and we were not the only ones who noticed. The place was packed, and that gave it the ambiance a lot of energy and fun. The food and drinks were great and the value was good too. I would highly recommend going here if in Chicago!"
"OK - I've got to start with an admission - I love Italian food. Visiting the Italian side of my family - all living in Italy - is always a culinary delight. Quartino serves tasty Italian food in the very trendy small plates style. So the dillema after three visits to Quartino is to rate only the food or rate the overall experience.The decision is clear enough to me, and it's not easy to give Quartino's only 3 stars. The food is good, but dinner out at a restaurant is about the food and the ambiance. Quartino's is just too jam packed with tables and it's too popular at the moment. The tapas concept compounds the problem of overcrowding. The waitstaff simply cannot keep up with the rhythm of the dining experience. In a place like Cafe Iberico you order a few small plates, and then a few more, and so on. At Quartino you simply don't get the attention needed to order two or three times during your meal. As others have mentioned, the place is loud - loud like you can't hear the person across the small table from you.In the end, the fun of small plates is sharing food with friends, and trying different items on the menu. The slow service and the loud and crowded environment overwhelm the food. My suggestion, wait until it calms down, and then give it a try."
"Meh, good wine, mediocre food, very crowded tourist spot."
"I went here on New Year's Eve for a pre-NYE cocktail.  Now, fresh into  2007, I find myself  totally smitten.  To remember my experience, I like to rely on a simple (but useful) mnemonic memory aid:Q is for Quite charming.  The layout, the atmosphere - I loved it all. U is for the Useful waitress.   She explained the wine sizes (half a carafe will do for two) AND Italian tapa-esque ordering techniques.A is for the Array of cold Italian plates - cheeses, prosciutto, olives, oh my!R is for Ronis.  I wish I had got these on my delicious little appetizer pizza ($10 and serves two.  Great deal).  We ordered the Zucchini pizza which was delicious but I kicked myself after seeing someone else's ronis later.  Roni envy is rough.T is for Tad.  It took a TAD bit long for the waitress to bring us our wine.  Once delivered, this was soon forgotten.I is for I , as in Kristin, want to go back ASAP.  This place is so cute and reasonably priced.  I want to put it in my pocket!N is for New.  GREAT idea to have Tapas go Italian.  At last,  a brilliant lovechild.O is for Out.  Next time you go out near State/Michigan check Out Quartino.  You will not be sorry!"
"Great atmosphere...can get very loud if you are trying to have a good conversation, but fun!!  Pasta is delicious and pizza is good.  Can be for a family w/ kids or a fun night out with adults.  Bar is very nice too!"
"This place is so great! I already know it is going to be a local favorite for me. The staff is very knowledgable and courteous! A friend and I went and got the whole package: ordered a bottle of wine, appetizers, meals, and dessert.The wine selection is great and they are very helpful in sampling and offering advice to pair with your meal. The appetizer we got - eggplant parmesan was delicious! We each got small pizzas, and they were both great as well. The pizza is thin crust and I got the veggie pizza - which was loaded with big vegetables and lots of cheese. The dessert we got was sorbet with fruit topping. Everything we got was perfect and the price was right. I think our total for the whole bill was around $60 (thats pretty good for wine/apps/meal/dessert)!I would recommend this place for a wide range of events - whether a friend is in town, your family, or a date. The place is very nice and the bar area has sports on for those who want to catch a game. The patio wasn't open when we were there, but it looks to be very spacious and probably a busy area in the summer."
I absolutely love this place and I *sheepishly* admit that I am a regular.  The food is always delicious and the small plates and the restaurant's urging that you share with your companioins means that you get to try many different plates.  The atmosphere is always a blast and the staff are considerate and truly aim to please!!!
"So I've never bothered to review a restaurant I didn't absolutely love, but this will be my first. To be completely honest, I'd sum up my experience here with a hearty ""Meh."" The restaurant was so loud that keeping up a conversation with my friends was difficult. After waiting for thirty minutes for a table, we were seated in the corner of the restaurant, tucked between a wall and the entrance to the kitchen, only to wait for another fifteen minutes before we even saw our waitress. Not a good start.I liked the concept of the restaurant going in, but I was a little bit disappointed by the execution. The create-your-own antipasti was a fun addition, and the meats (prosciutto di parma and an air-dried salami) and cheeses (taleggio) which we selected were delicious; the accompaniments, unfortunately, were hit-or-miss.  I was very disappointed by two out of the three olives in the tasting portion -- I didn't know it was possible to serve a bad olive, but I guess there's a first for everything.The veal meatballs were tender, juicy, and flavorful; however, the accompanying sauce was far sweeter than what I was expecting and what I deemed desirable. The calamari, covered with far too much batter, was rubbery both in terms of texture and flavor. The polenta fries were also tasteless, although that could be blamed on either the person who invented polenta fries or the person who ordered them rather than the person who prepared them for our consumption.The desserts almost made up for the lackluster food. The caramelized banana sundae was good, and the lemon gelato ""panino"" was similarly delicious. The best thing, however, was the biscotti that accompanied the sundae.All in all, I think if we had ordered better, my experience would have been better. That being said, I still think everything on a menu should be on the same plane. Perhaps I'll try this place again and my second experience will be better than my first, but with so many other restaurants to try in Chicago, one mediocre experience is enough."
"Shazam.  Somebody's doing something right here.  Great tapas with plenty of crazy dishes to try and an endless wine list.  Polenta fries!  Crowded and loud like any of the other tapas restaurants in town.  But excellent, attentive service, even when it's elbow to elbow."
pizza was cooked to order however cheese was melty and toppings all fell off the crust......apps were good....beer was cold....probably  better drinking with apps place than a dinner joint
"I was originally going to give a 3-star rating but read on for why I downgraded to 2-stars.  I don't know what the big deal is about this place.  It's a big restaurant, the menu features Italian tapas, and you can't get anything less than a 1/4 carafe of wine.  I ordered the Penne all Vodka and it was just okay.  It didn't really have much taste.  Good thing I ordered it spicy because the peppers were the only thing that saved it.  The portions are small relative to other restaurants in the city.  This isn't a place I would say is a ""good value.""   Additionally, my penne was coated with grated Parmesan cheese.  Granted, I like a lot of grated Parmesan cheese on my pasta but I prefer to either a) put it on myself, or b) have a waiter do it.  For the dish to come out of the kitchen with that much cheese on it is a bit presumptuous in my opinion.  Fast forward to 1 hour after eating...my stomach was rolling (and not in a good way).  I had to jump in a cab, bee-line it home and hit the bathroom.  I was sick to my stomach.  Bummer.  Thus the 2-star rating.When it comes to Italian restaurants in the city I am a BIG fan of Volare.  I think it is the best old-school Italian in the city.  I haven't found anything better, so I will stop trying to find a place that's better and continue to go there!  My friends tell me RoSal is good but I haven't tried it yet."
"There is one tapas restaurant that I can name in the good old upstate of SC. This being said, coming to the ""big city""...I grew to love/adore/devour tapas. How could I have been missing this 23 years of my life?Quartino reminds me of an Italian version of Café Iberico, a tapas place that I adore and used to haunt when I worked downtown. This Italian counterpart has all the makings of its (unlikely) twin...small, tables close together, LOUD, dishes coming out when they're ready, aiming for family style...much of this already pointed out by other Yelpers. I'm not really a fan of traditional style, Olive Garden looking restaurants, so I was excited to try this place...seemed like it was my kind of Italian joint.However, for my first trip here, I came with a party of 18 for a birthday. Here's my experience racked up.The birthday girl ordered a preset menu, which was a great idea. The only downfall was the fact I couldn't really determine how much I'd be spending. At my end of the table, we did order a liter of wine for about $16. The house red was good.Here's a run down of our small plates:--Margarita Style Pizza - hot, hot, hot...burned the roof of my mouth. The sauce was kind of tart and I wanted more cheese.--Sausage Pizza - again, hot hot hot...burned the roof of my mouth...pretty much like the Margarita with random sausage slices thrown on top. --Calarmari - Pretty good. Could have been crispier though.--Tomato/Buffalo Mozzarella salad--DELICOUS...ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS...but I am huge fan of mozarrella--Parmesan served in a little frying pan--sadly, I didn't taste this.--Scallops with capers & spinach--pretty good but the scallops were a little dry.--Mushroom risotto--looked absolutely revolting but was surprisingly good. --Pasta with what looked like ricotta cheese--pretty tasty.That's all I can really remember eating. Only the salad stood out.Highlights:--There was an embarrassing ordeal with the bill, and the servers were very accommodating and polite. Though I'm sure they snickered at us behind our backs (as I would have), with a party of 19, there's always bound to be confusion over paying the bill. It's a law of nature, frustrating but it always happens. All I can say is, I paid my fair share!--With our coupons, I ended up spending $30. Was it worth it? Considering the fact I chipped in for a bday, had wine, and the gratuity was included, I was pretty pleased. Pleased enough to come back here again on my own with a much smaller group to really try to enjoy my next Quartino experience. --MAJOR HIGHLIGHT - I don't know if it's only a Monday thing but there have half priced wines to go! I picked up a bottle of house red and white ($5 each) and a white called Water Color ($10). I got them to go and they charged gratuity...so $25 for 3 bottles. Not bad! I walked away very delighted!Will I be back? Yes, when I make it out of the hood and want to expand my horizons downtown, I'll make sure to drop by Quartino again."
"excellent food. had the best tiramisu. I always order Tiramisu from many italian restaurant, by far this one is the best. they don't just soak the biscuits in cream and sugars.very well balance.the pizza was nice, thin and crusty.the pasta, just ok."
"I had heard people rave about how much they loved Quartino, so I decided to go with a friend last week for a week night dinner.  My meal and experience were awful...maybe it was an off-night, but whatever the reason, I would never return.We were promptly seated at a two person table.  First problem, there was a stack of 10 plates (I counted them) and a pizza holder sitting on the table...which meant that there wasn't enough room on the table for our dinner plates to sit on the table in front of us, they had to sit to the right of us.  I know Quartino encourages sharing, however, I'm still trying to figure out how 2 people could use 10 plates.  Also, neither of us ordered pizza, so I don't know why we needed a pizza stand on the table?  Either way, I'd rather judge a restaurant on it's food.Here's where I ran into the second problem.  Everything from the bread through the rest of the meal was either mediocre or inedible.  I started off with the butternut squash soup.  It tasted like apple sauce and had the consistency of a badly mixed smoothie.  After a couple of bites I gave up and hoped the other food would be better.  For dinner we decided to share the scallops and a pasta dish (can't remember the name.)  The scallops came first (about 10 minutes before the pasta) and after waiting about 5 minutes for the pasta to come, we gave up and started eating the scallops.  My friend had never had scallops and I offered her the first bite.  She made a weird face and said ""oh they taste kind of like chicken!""  That's when I got worried.  She was right, the scallops were so over cooked that they had developed the consistency of chicken.  The pasta came a couple minutes later and at least the pasta was cooked well!  However, I would have rather had Ragu straight from the jar rather than the sauce that was on the pasta.  I won't go into detail on the sauce.  I want to believe that I had Quartino on a bad night...but if this was a bad night, I'm not really that worried about trying a good night.  Baffling."
"Three stars from me too.  My date was way more entertaining than the food or the atmosphere, thankfully. Although - I'll hit the fourth star just for the fact that i loved the historical bathroom and the attendant that didn't put things all over the sink.  I even tipped. (see TALK conversation haha)Three cheers too for all the house wine they have."
"I can not begin to tell you how great this place is. C'mon, a Pizzeria Wine Bar!! How can you go wrong.  Food- is exceptional, meant to be shared, so many choices, so much flavor mouth watering thinking about it. Drink- excellent, I am a Red wine/Chianti guy so this is a no brainer, excellent. Staff is unbelievable, Seamus runs a great restaurant and Mike A. went out of his way to make our evening (parents anniversary from out of town) one of the best my parents can remember. Thank you a thousand times! The atmosphere is a buzz with life, may be loud for some but it's part of the experience. Everyone is happy and talking all night. Service is above par, and last but definitely NOT least are the lemon cello's. You HAVE TO HAVE 1 (ok 2). Delicious!  We will be back soon and frequently, as this is our favorite eatery in Chicago. would give it 6 stars if we could!"
"I don't get the appeal of this place. It is incredibly loud to begin with, and the food is just so so. I went for a friend's birthday with about 6 people. We could hardly hear one another. Fine, as long as the food makes up for it. Not even close. We ordered the cheese fondue which was the worst fondue I've ever had. The cheese wasn't very warm and lacked flavor. We then ordered some pasta dishes which were good, but not memorable. Dessert was okay, but nothing great. Overall not worth the price. I wouldn't go back."
"Love this place!  I've been here twice, first on a weeknight with a girlfriend and we sat outdoors.  Second time, brought the parents who were visiting from out of town (who now love this place too!)  A great place to eat good food, and take your time with it.I have really enjoyed every dish I have tasted here, including: clams, 2 different risottos, any pasta, and the dessert.  You can order wine by the 1/4, 1/2 or full liter, or by the bottle.Really great service.  It's nice to be able to order one or two dishes at a time, and then wait as long as you want deciding your next dish.  Our server made some good suggestions and I never felt rushed to leave either.Downside: on a Friday night it was LOUD inside the restaurant.  It got to be a little annoying as the night progressed.  Also, the dessert fondue was good, but the dark chocolate was so dark that it was almost bitter - I would pass on it the next time."
"Can't go wrong with a carafe of the house red (Rosso). The atmosphere is really nice. Yes, it is a little loud, but come on - when you're putting back the wine and enjoying good food and good company, who doesn't want to laugh out loud. Most recently I had the pizza. Thin crust is always my favorite and they have a nice consistency where you get that lovely crackery crunch. If there was a whole wheat option I would be in heaven. I'm a sauce lover when it comes to pizza and there's isn't my favorite. First, there's not enough for my taste, but it's lacking depth. I found my dish tasted much better after seasoning with salt and pepper. I like big flavors and miss the garlic or onion I put on pizza at home.Dessert......mmmmm. My fiance and I split the banana dessert and it was perfect. Sweet, not heavy, served in a chilled martini glass so the ice cream stays the perfect temperature. I was savoring every spoonful, so by the time I got down to the last few bites it was nice to not have ""soup"" left in the bottom.Can't wait to try this place when it's warmer out and you can sit outside :)"
"My wife and I had an excellent time at Quartino tonight.  It was our first visit and we loved it.  We tried 9 different dishes, which is something you just can't do at most restaurants!  We started with the olive sampler and caprese salad followed by half orders of mushroom risotto, pappardelle, orrechiette, lasagne, and ravioli, finishing with tiramisu, and complimentary zeppoles (thanks to it being St. Joseph's Day).  Throw a liter of Primitivo in for good measure and finish with a funky dessert drink consisting of lemon gelato, lemon vodka and prosecco, and WOW, what a great last meal in the windy city!  On a vacation where gluttony ran rampant and excess was an understatement (seriously, we ate at Capital Grille, Joe's, Frontera Grill, Ba Ba Reeba and more), Quartino was a fun and tasty way to end the trip.  Our favorites were the orrechiette, ravioli and risotto, while the lasagne and the olives were only mediocre.  This is a solid 4 star, enjoyable establishment but like most have said, it IS  loud.  Also, the bussing was sub par, but these really didn't diminish the experience too much.  Go.  Enjoy!"
"So lovely and charming. Went here with a girlfriend for a girls night out. It's loud and crowded but so friendly and we were never rushed to hurry and eat. Would come back with the family and kids, great place, great food. What a great find in the middle of the city!"
"Great service, atmosphere but..... The food was not up to par. I expected. Freshness and was disappointed"
"Took my son here,who is a student and a chef and boy did this place disappoint! The idea of tapas is great -but the food was not. We ordered 5 items trying to get a variety.The food came fast and hot but overcooked. The waiter asked us how we were doing One time and that was to refill our glass.This was an afternoon so the place was by no means packed.....The wine is good thou and cheap! My parents are old school Italians and I was raised on this type of food-This is not Italian...pass!!"
"I always loved this place and enjoyed dining there.  I LOVED their risotto dishes - it's all delicious, especially the saugage risotto.  Actually, every thing is good...well except for the potato stick appetizers - it's bland.  The waiter and waitress were always nice and very friendly.  They have a big wine selections but I am always disappointed in my wine choices and could never get it right.  The atmosphere is loud and you're have no problems with bringing ""bratty"" kids to this place since the noise/music drowns them out.  The menu is not too kid-friendly but one can always order spaghetti w/marinara or penne w/butter sauce."
"I've never ever ever had a bad meal here.  In fact, I've never had a good meal here.  I've only had GREAT meals here.First, the pizza.  Exceptional, melt in mouth and full of flavor.  I'm usually a sauce and cheese kinda girl, but their pizza topped with arugula is fantastic.  All of their pizza perfectly blend the most complex of flavors together perfectly.  Nothing about it is bland.The pasta is also incredible, as are the bread and cheese plates.  The best thing about this place?  Not expensive at all.  For the quality of the food and establishment, this place is a steal.  Their wine may not be actually cheaper than water, but it's still pretty darn cheap.The ambiance is perfect for any occasion: date, girl's night out or a gathering of old friends.  Sometimes there's a wait, but it's never for very long, even on a Friday or Saturday, and always worth it."
"Since Quartino opened I have enjoyed every meal. From the minute you walk in the door until the minute you leave, you're transported to a great restaurant more expected in Milan than downtown Chicago. The chef, John Colletta, can be found either in the kitchen, at a guest's table or greeting guests at the front of the house. This hands-on attention to detail is surely why the food and price just can't be beat. On your way out, don't forget to pick up a copy of the Chef's cookbook and have him sign it. Our favorites include the Margarita Pizza, duck prosciutto, dolce gorgonzola cheese, lamb meatballs and anything remotely sounding like it came from the sea. This has become a Chicago institution and is a cannot miss spot for us. In the interest of full disclosure, we used to visit Quartino at least once a week when we lived around the corner. Now that we live 3 hours away, we make sure not to miss it when we're back in Chicago."
"For Quartino, I have only use pick up service only so far, but I would like to dine in someday.The service was good, polite, attentive even for pick up customers.The ambiance was definitely top rate.The food was incredible and super delicious. The only reason why it's a 3 star and not a 4 was the portion. It was simply tiny.Besides that, I would recommend it to a friend for sure."
"Fantastic food and terrific service!  It really doesn't get better than Quartinos when you have a group of good friends you want to go out with for dinner.  We've been several times before and it's always been good, but we just had our Rehearsal Dinner at Quartinos and blocked off the majority of the 2nd floor for our 60 guests in early March 2013.  I can't say enough good things about the food and the service.  All of the servers were so nice and made everything really easy.  All the guests loved it and there was a big variety for everyone.  The best moment was when they brought around my favorite pasta dish and to make it vegetarian, they left off the prosciutto.  I was so disappointed, but 2 seconds after they dropped off the plates of pasta, they followed with a full plate of prosciutto!  It was great service and presentation.  The set up was great and they even had a bunch of TV's positioned so everyone in both rooms could see the video my husband made of us growing up!  It was a great experience and will always be a great memory from our wedding weekend!"
"What as surprise!I was expecting a busy touristy place, but it is nothing like that. We loved the bread, soup, pasta, pizza, meatballs and did I mention wine? Service from Patricia was great. The manager Nicholas stopped by and engaged us to see what we liked etc. Once again - Outstanding!"
"As Good as it Gets is right on mark!!!. . . if you want to eat at a place that has it's own heartbeat. When you walk in it is crowded, noisy, and electric. The entire staff was friendly, couteous and attentive. . the big 3 for me. . .we went with a party of 5 fresh from Training and seeing Chicago from the top of the John Hancock building. . .so needless to say we were ready for some food and drink. . .Our server Keturah was on point and made some excellent recommendations. . .we started with some beer, wine and the meat and cheese platter. . .The platter was enormous and on a scale of 1-10 it shattered the scale on flavor, assortment, and presentation. For our dinners we all ordered and shared with each other. . .Every dish . . .(rigatoni, Veal, lasanga, Calabrese salad) tasted fresh, came out hot from the kitchen and was enjoyed by the entire team of 5. There are 2 levels, and outdoor dining; we elected for first level and inside as it was still hot in Chi-town that week. Even with a full house the service was top notch and nothing lagged. . . .I will be back to Quartino's everytime i find myself in Chicago. . .enjoy"
"Amazing, affordable tapas and wine. Fast, efficient service, even though they were packed."
This is one place you're guaranteed a good time/service. Wine is alright ( mostly Italian) but they bring your order real quick. Avg price for the location.Update: I went to their wine tastign and found out their house RED ( even white) is $5 ( they call it Antica Asteria.) It tastes better than the CATENA I paid $35+.
"This is an excellent restaurant.  Everything was great.  We tried several cheeses and cured meats.  I don't care for gorgonzola, but the gorgonzola dolce is very good.  We tried the pizza with speck and spinach  (fumo negli occhi) it was fantastic.  The crust is amazing, the balance between toppings, cheese and sauce is perfect.  The desserts were also tasty.  It has a unique dining room.  It makes you feel like you are in Italy in a cafe somewhere.  Can't wait to go back!!"
"A great place for laid back fun, food and friendly service. Love it every time I go and the food is very good."
"Group of four ate there on a Friday (11/6) night. Restaurant was crowded and reservations are recommended. Seated upstairs and the tables on all sides feel like they are right on top of you and at any moment you could reach over to someone else's table and take a sample. The food was good but not great. The table ordered three pasta dishes (ravioli, gnocchi, tortellini) along with a thin crust pizza. Enjoyed a liter of wine for a very cheap price. With all of the wonderful places to eat in Chicago I am unsure if I would come back in the near future."
"after twenty or so visits, quartino's is always reliable and cheap. the food is decent, but nothing truly rave-worthy (i do love the fundido though - get it with apples,) although reasonably priced. the small plates set up lets you and your guests try a nice sampling of what the restaurant has to offer - perfect for those indecisive-orderers.and quartino's is not joking when it says their wine is cheaper than water. no matter how much food or wine my party orders, the bill always seems to come to about $20 a person. they also take reservations and are able to accommodate large groups, so it's great for parties."
Quartino is a great place for just two people or a group. I had my last birthday here and everyone was pleased. There were some friends there that hadn't had small plates and fell in love with it. I can't remember ever having a bad meal here.
"I'm definitely a fan of Quartino for several reasons.  The food is great, cheap, and it has a cute environment.  I love sitting outside in the spring and summer since there's great people watching on state street.  I went last night and ordered the grapefruit martini, one of the best I've ever had!  I also tried my boyfriend's espresso martini and that was great as well.  I usually order pizza or pasta there, but last night I got the asparagus risotto, which was yummy.  I think I like the cavatappi pasta with basil and ricotta better, but I still enjoyed it.  The only downside to Quartino is that it gets pretty crowded, so you need a reservation a few days ahead of time if you want to eat there on a friday or saturday night.  This place is fun for a group since you can share the dishes and have some cheap and yummy sangria!"
"If you're looking for a tasty, affordable Italian meal served in a vibrant, borderline-rowdy atmosphere, Quartino should be your top choice. I'd read the Yelp reviews so I knew what to expect, and I thought it would be  perfect choice for me and my foodie husband to celebrate his new job. I was right -- Quartino is great for couples or a small group looking to laugh and talk and eat great food. We hit the salumeria menu pretty hard because we really love us some meat and cheese, but we also got a few small plates. In fact, we were going to order more -- we really wanted to try a pizza or something from the pasta menu -- but we were way too full. We did order the zeppoles for dessert, which presented the only snag of the evening -- we ended up having to wait longer than expected for them to be made. But our server was very apologetic, and we weren't in a hurry. The only thing that keeps me from giving Quartino five stars is the noise level. It really is crazy noisy in there, so it's not a good place for large groups, or for people who are easily overwhelmed by noise (parents or grandparents, perhaps?), or for having important conversations with someone who speaks softly or doesn't hear well. But if you don't mind the noise, or don't mind shouting above it (like me!), this really is a great place to get tasty italian small plates at a reasonable price."
"What a great deal. You can eat two or three courses here and spend less than $20 a person. And the food is worth considerably more! Excellent service, friendly staff, no long waits, even for a terrace table on a warm evening, and the bathrooms were clean too. It's also surprisingly quiet on the terrace even during evening rush hour. Especially loved that the caprese came with real mozzarella instead of the plastic stuff you get elsewhere, and that the salumeria was available for takeout. The gelato was also the real deal. Pizza funghi was also very generously topped with portobellos and not regular button mushrooms as you can often find. The concept is 'tapas' style for most dishes but the pastas and pizzas are more than enough for one person. If you don't want to share it's cheap enough to not need to.It's my new favorite place to eat, I'll be back without a doubt."
"Tasty food--however, reading the reviews, I think I need to go back & try it again.  I went for a work sponsored meal/event at lunch, & we did not get to choose our own food--they just brought out some chef selections.  I think I feel cheated by this.  It's now on my to-do list to go back and eat by my own rules here."
This place is great.  I stopped here for lunch with the baby I care for and the staff was so friendly towards us and very accommodating of my vegan diet.  I loved my food and I really liked the architecture.  It was a great dining experience and I will be back.
"Quartino is my absolute favorite restaurant in Chicago. Anywhere that gives you a salumeria menu has stolen my heart already, though I'm sad that they no longer automatically give you all the tasty accompaniments - you now have to choose. Boo. However, unending bread, a platter of cheese, meats, and olives, delicious thin-crust pizzas (pears with gorgonzola?! DO IT!!), yummy veal meatballs, delicious gnocchi with pesto, and cheap-cheap-cheap carafes of house wine will make any visit here well worth the money. Its great for groups of all sizes, and I for one love the open, noisy atmosphere - I just feel transported to another place somehow.Two thumbs way up. Try it, you'll love it!"
"I had my wedding reception in the upstairs of Quartino, it was WONDERFUL.  Lynette worked with me to make sure everything was perfect and it pretty much was.  She was very pleasant, and answered all my questions promptly and politely.  Our main server at the reception was great too, I want to say his name was Roberto but I could be wrong.  Our guests LOVED the food and wine and the staff were very kind to our photographer, DJ, and our cake creators.   The price was pretty reasonable too.  I would highly recommend having a party here, or just going there for dinner.  In fact I should be getting there soon myself!"
"They have gluten free pasta, which is cooked right and paired with a fresh,tasty tomato sauce. If you are looking for a great gluten free pasta, this is a good place to go. Food is served family style, and while my group tactily gave me first dibs on the pasta, I got more  than I could eat so I wound up sharing.My only issue with the restaurant is the noise. As with other restaurants, the tables are close together and the crowd is social, so it can be very loud at times. My first time here I sat upstairs, and it was almost impossible to talk with my friends. Go in the off hours and you won't be disappointed."
"food -- not goodphysical location  -- outstanding: roomy, clean, very attractive designservice -- friendly and attentivefirst thing that crossed my mind after walking in, looking around and seeing the menu was ""for this location and this nice of a place, the prices seem downright cheap ....wow, i might have found a great bargain.""  unfortunately i was wrong.  the food was very poor.  we had carpaccio, olives, cheese and the saprano pizza.the beef carpaccio was paper thin.  carpaccio is supposed to be thin, but this was by far the thinnest i have ever seen and there was absolutely no way to enjoy it since it turned into mush as you tried to move it from the serving plate to your plate.olives are olives.  cheese is cheese.the pizza was average to below average, something you would expect to find at a non-specially chain not a place that bills itself as ""italian.""  the sauce was tastles.  the giardiniera lookled like someone literally dumpled it out of a can on top of the pizza right before bringing it to our table.if you are looking for an aesthetically nice restaurant in the gold coast with cheap (relatively speaking) food and don't really care about how the tastes, this is the place to go."
I just ate here tonight and the food tasted good going down.  But I got sick and so did my husband.
I go here all the time. The food is great and so reasonably priced!  The portion sizes are perfect-not your typical Italian restaurant where one meal can feed a family of four.  The service is ok--sometimes you have to search for the waiter.This place is always a great place to go with friends. Maybe not the best on a date b/c you can't hear anything it's so loud!  The one annoying thing is the noise level. The Rustica pizza is tasty and don't forget to save room for the chocolate fondue!
Having dinner here was the highlight of my trip to Chi Town. AMAZING! And Valerie was an incredible server... I totally want to hang out with her.
"The taste of the food is great. The Fetuccini Alfredo were fantastic 3 times I've been there. The staff although a bit on the slow side, is friendly. The place is huge and the pizzas are delicious. My only complain is that the food takes a little more than usual, and the staff is a bit slow, other than that, it's a great place to eat."
"it's hard to write reviews of restaurants that are exactly what you expect.  and once i saw that gibsons gift certificate icon on the bottom of quartino's website, the jig was up.  this is, as are most italian restaurants, a good place to go with large groups, picky eaters, or when a lot of different dietary restrictions/preferences need to be satisfied.  would i come here on a date? no.  would i come here for an office lunch? yes.  and this is why:(1) the service is efficient.  no waiting around for water or plates to be cleared and if your server is nowhere to be found, there's always another milling about.(2) the food comes out fast. nope, no pacing courses. whatever is made first in that mammoth kitchen gets brought immediately to your table.(3) extensive selection of pizzas, pastas, appetizers, carpaccios, and main courses. (4) you won't find any strange, inventive or potentially offensive flavor combinations.(5) the prices are reasonable.the pizza margherita, mussels, gnocchi, asparagus risotto were all just fine.  the only highlight was the linguine with white clam sauce.  quite tasty.  the desserts too were good.  try the warm doughnuts with chocolate sauce and profiteroles.some added bonuses worth mentioning.  no fixed gratuity at lunch for our group of  seven.  and, when they accidentally threw away our two remaining slices of pizza, they gave us a whole new one to go for free."
Good Wine! Great Pizza! Good cheeses!  The risotto is weak and prevents a 4 star rating
I stopped here to eat with my boyfriend after work before we headed to a movie. The garlic bread is amazing! We also ordered a pizza and split it between us two. Amazing! The wine list is very extensive and inexpensive. This would be a fun place to go with co workers after work one night. The seating in the bar area is kind of crowded but I didn't mind. I will definitley be back here.
One of my favorite places to eat in Chicago and its right next door to the Dana Hotel which is a huge bonus. Try the bar plates if you want a variety or sample what has to be some of the best fried calamari I've ever had. The caprese salad is also amazing. Great place to gran a glass of Italian wine and unwind at the bar. Highly recommended!
their veal meatballs are not the same as I remember.  Warm mushy raisin.. ick! And the buffalo mozzarella cheese seemed a bit off on the caprese salad today at lunch.  Ballo will be my got to for veal meatballs. Sorry Quartino.
Good place to go before it gets too loud and obnoxious. Very good food and cheese. Nice selection of wine at a reasonable price. It does fill up with the out of town types so beware. valet parking.  Swing over to Pops for Champagne afterwards to unwind.
"Great inexpensive wine, amazing food that is unique and great service.....stop reading reviews and just go, you won't regret it!"
"We went here for a late lunch after shopping and walking around the mag. mile. They have great service and atmosphere, and it also helps that they are located only a couple blocks away from the michigan ave. It was awesome that you can do half and half pizza and pasta. You can try two different pastas (or pizzas) for a price of one. We tried the carbonara and creamy alfredo fettucini. We also got the veggie pizza and the veal meat ball pizza. The highlight was the carbonara spaghetti. Everything else was just mediocre. Our bill was about 28 dollars. Our server was great even though we were quite indecisive. Maybe we didn't get the right stuff, but it didn't really live up to the reviews..."
Tasty bites.  Everything was great. From antipasta to dessert. I would go back for sure. If you're in a big group I don't suggest getting the lamb shank. It was too hard to share. But do get the short rib and duck prosciutto.  The service was good and expect it to be a longer meal than a normal sit down place.  I mean it is tapas afterall.
"Yes, it was was noisy, and yes, we had to wait for a while even though we had a reservation, but the food was good, the service surprisingly attentive, and the bill came to less than $30 per person for dinner and dessert, but no wine. The polenta fries and veal meatballs were excellent, as other reviewers have noted. We were also quite pleased with the not-very-spicy-but-very-flavorful spaghetti arrabiata and the almost lox-like spek (smoked prosciutto), although the marinated artichokes were disappointingly bland. Dessert-wise, the caramelized bananas weren't very, but the accompanying gelato (we had the chocolate) was particularly tasty as were the homemade donuts with honey."
"This is a great spot for group meals!  My company's team came out here for dinner and we had so much food family style.  First we started out with this meat and cheese appetizer (3 different meats and 3 different cheeses), fried calamari, then we had a pizza, gnocci, asparagus risotto, farmhouse chicken, tiger shrimp, prime angus beef tagliata, and this chocolate and caramel fondu.  I think it came out to about $50 a person, which is very reasonable.   I love being able to try a little bit of everything.  The service was great, and I'm sure I'll come back again."
"Last night, I took a group of out of town guests to Quartino (11 of us in total). Quartino is an incredible place for groups. We ordered a couple servings of calamari, almost all the cheese and meat appetizers, three pizzas, the asparagus risotto, and five of the desserts. Everything was excellent. Plus, being able to order extra items after the fact if someone is still hungry is great for groups."
"Absolutely love the food, great service, cool space.  BUT.... if you're there after 8pm on a weekend night, beware that this place gets unbelievably LOUD.  At some point, shouting at your companion who is only 3 feet away gets pretty old."
"Ok - obviously the food is not on par with Spiaggia or Schwa, but for the type of restaurant it is it's FABULOUS. The food is a great mix of traditional and more fun Italian food. They have such a large menu from pizzas to meat platters to soups to pastas and so much more, there is something for everyone. The atmosphere is a little loud at times but you can always hear the people at your table. Finally, the staff is great! They know how to make sure that your needs are taken care of and if you come more often they remember your name and favorite foods :)"
"I've been here several times, I live right down the block, and the first few times I wasn't crazy about it, but last night I changed my mind.  Had a great meal, split a pizza and pasta- perfect portions and great taste.  I've also tried the caprese salad, chicken soup, calamari, eggplant, and enjoyed them all.  Not a huge fan of the broccoli rabe side.Wines are good and reasonably priced, they also offer a monthly $20 bottle which you can't beat!Management checked on us twice during our meal and was super friendly without being overbearing.  Great wait staff and hosts as well.Only negatives- olive oil tastes cheap, when you ask for parm they bring you something in a plastic container to grate yourself (doesn't feel that fancy), and the noise level is really really high.I must say I've been reformed, and will be back- thanks for a great quick impromptu date night!"
"This is a dependable place for great food along busy State Street.  Wood-oven pizzas, Italian tapas, fresh ingredients--can't really go wrong.I took my family to Quartino to celebrate my graduation.  They accommodated my large party and moved us to a larger table when asked.  The shared plates were great for us and we loved the nutella dessert.  OK, yes.  Anything with nutella is awesome, but this was fried french bread with chocolate and nutella!!!"
"I've been here twice. Once just at the bar, and once upstairs. They had quite the crowd both times, and considering there was hardly any room for the servers to maneuver, the service was decent enough.You should get at least 2 items per person and all share to get the best overall mix of the food offered. I was there with just one friend and we ordered the squid, strip steak, four cheese pizza, and ravioli.While we were there, a very large group of middle aged women were celebrating something at the table next to us. One of the women apparently was having such a good time she fell right out of her chair and flat on the floor beside me. It just goes to show you how loud and hectic it can get inside this place sometimes!"
"This really is my favorite Italian restaurant in this city!  I've had so much on the menu I could be an expert, but hands down great!"
"Went here last night and had a great time.  It was just as most of the other Yelpers said: Great environment, very comfortable, good 'Italian Tapas'.  There are also traditional entree orders, but the small serving orders are fun for variety.Price is very reasonable...I was surprised, actually.  The wine setup with the small carafes is very cool too.  Good bar with a fun bartender(don't remember his name, sorry).  Our server for dinner was was a great guy...very friendly and fun... His name was Kyler I believe.The Manager came by twice to check on us and make sure we were doing well also, which I appreciate.So, as I said, great time and will definitely come back again."
"This place was delicious thanks brad and Jamie, the veal meatballs were solid unfortunately i didnt get to try the wine i am sure its delicioius. but this place was great the food was wonderful."
"One step above Chef Boyardee.  Crowded, noisy, poor food quality.  My spinach salad was almost completely devoid of dressing and had three measly slivers of pear on it.  Orrechiete pasta was orange.  That's about all I could say about it."
"So I finally checked out Quartino for the first time recently... while waiting for a table outside, I was seated in the bar area where a waitress came up to us immediately to order drinks. Although I didn't have the appetite to sample as many dishes as I thought I would, I tried out the caprese salad and the margarita pizza. Safe choices, but both were very good... also, our waitress as great- so informative and helpful. She explained the menu to us newbies, and also described to us what the most popular dishes were, as well as their own speciality wines.... great service! (Since we choose to sit outside, it was a pretty nosy since it's located right above the red line, so i had to scream over my company a few times!) But it's a great little patio. I look forward to going back to try some of the pastas and other small dishes I've heard good things about.Update 11/07: Came here recently for lunch. Excellent service. The manager came up to us several times to ask if we needed anything, and also explained to us some of the meanings behind the art on the wall and the old school movies playing on the tv. Excellent service!Update August 2, 2010 I had dinner here recently on a Saturday night. Since this place is always packed and insanely loud, I asked if we could be seated upstairs, which was still insanely busy and full of many bachelorette parties and large groups, but much quieter than downstairs. Ordered the veal meatballs which were delicious - had a sweet taste with the golden raisins. Also loved the Shrimp Risotto and Bolognese pasta. Cheap wine and wood-fire pizzas are excellent as well. Hard to get a reservation here for weekends, esp on the patio. Our pasta took forever to come out so after complaining to the manager, he comped the dish as well as bringing us a comp dessert which was fantastic - hot chocolate cake with vanilla gelato. YUM!!"
"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner this past week.  I wanted to like this place more, but it gets about 3.5 stars for me.  It gets 4 stars because of the excellent service and because it is great for groups.  The food, however, is more like three stars, because I've had better and I think it is definitely more Americanized Italian food.  Our group shared a bunch of dishes, and some were great and some were just average.  I suppose your experience with the food here will vary depending on what you order.  My favorite by far was the ravioli with some sort of proscuitto on top.  I expected more from the sun-dried tomato soup, but it just ended up tasting like spaghetti sauce.  Also, the octopus was a bit dry and all of us agreed that it was a bit too salty, even though we all like salty food.  The cheese plate and the pizzas were good.  Another plus is that the place isn't too expensive, so you don't have to feel too guilty if you didn't have the best experience.  Overall, I think I will be trying other Italian food establishments in city rather than coming back here."
LOVE Quartino!  The only thing better than Italian food is Italian tapas. YUM!
"I typically pick the restaurants, but on this night I had a serious epicurean brain freeze. Subsequently, Audrey assumed the role of Foodmander & Chief and made the executive decision to go to Quartino.  We put our name in for a table of four on their outdoor patio and were told the wait would be 25 minutes.  Just as we received our bottle of wine inside at the bar, our table was ready!  Wow, a table ready in less than the time quoted.  A mini miracle to start our dining experience...Quartino is part of the small plate movement and encourages you to order 2 to 3 plates per person and SHARE.  As you know I HATE sharing and so does Jono's wife Lisa. This should be interesting.  We started off with their build your own Salumera Tasting. We opted for Duck Prosciutto, Soppressata, Parmesan Reggiano, Fontina, Calamari Salad, Roasted Beet Salad, and the Siclian Caponata.  The tasting also came with a selection of olives and all the fixings for the meat and cheeses.  To the selection we also added a side order of Prosciutto di Parma. Everything was delicious!  The house cured Duck Prosciutto was the clear gold medal winner, but every other component somehow made it to the podium (Sorry for the Olympics reference, but how can't you get caught up in all this hoopla?).  Next we had the Eggplant Parmigiano which had great flavors, but was salted very heavily. If I think something's too salty than something is wrong.    The Margherita Pizza was also a bit of a letdown.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good pizza, but when I think Margherita I think fresh buffalo mozzarella, not shredded mozzarella.  We also shared the Tortellini with Alfredo Sauce, Peas, and Prosciutto, which was good.  I went off on my own and ordered the Veal Meatball Slider, which may have been the best dish of the night. The meatball is perfectly spiced and it's served with yummy pickled vegetables.  To wash it all down we ordered a $16 liter of Antica Osteria Bianco, which for the money was perfect for an outdoor summer night.Quartino's outdoor patio is among the city's best.  Substantial marble tables and nice comfortable chairs make it a bit nicer than most. However, the street noise can be a bit much.  I mean do ambulances really need to have their sirens so loud?  The service was good, but not great. There were a couple of opportunities for our server to go the extra mile, but maybe didn't recognize it. No big deal.  As we were eating I was excited to give Quartino 4 stars.  However, as I am writing this review the salty eggplant parm we had is actually making me thirsty. And now I'm thinking about the disappearance of the fresh mozzarella on the pizza.  So for now Quartino will have to settle for 3 stars. I'm sure they will be devastated....1 Salumera Tasting1 Side of Prosciutto1 Eggplant Parm1 Tortellini1 Veal Slider1 Liter of Wine---------------------------$110"
"I'm not quite sure exactly what to rate Quartino. I enjoy this restaurant a great deal, except for the fact that I haven't had too many good ""main courses"" there. I have been here about 5 times or so and their fondue, caprese, and profiteroles are amazing! However, the only other thing I have had here that was good was the pizza. All the other times, I have been very disappointed with my pasta. The atmosphere of the place is nice. It's a bit loud inside, but that is fine. It all matches the homestyle italian vibe they are going for. The bar area is nice and they have a good outdoor dining section for when it's nice outside.  Now if only I could find a good pasta dish there."
"we were scrambling for a place to eat dinner after midnight. being from the west coast, we were eating all of our meals a little later in the evening due to the time change and the fact that we eat late meals as it is. this place was perfect and offered good service. we got the pizza margherita and a 1/2 liter of wine and we were on our way."
"Last night was my first encounter with Quartino and I'm wholly unimpresssed.The service was lackluster and the salumeria was not all that tasty.  The proscuttio, salami and parmesan portions were decent.  Our calamari and 1/2 caraf of bellini, on the other hand, was DELICIOUS!As for ambiance, it was all together far too loud.  I was sitting right next to my friend and had to strain to hear her.  It wasn't due to the loud obnoxious ladies surrounding us, but the pulsing music played about 70 decibels too loud.I think I'm going to try more of the hot dishes next time."
"Absolutey the second best meal we've ever eaten. The first being cooking with the chef in her kitchen in a restaurant in Lucca, Italy. The parmagiano, provolone and mortedella platter was the best we have ever had. The angus tagliatta Rosemary was to die for. Absolutely the beat restaurant in Chicago."
"First time there. Excellent food and service. Loud rooms, but great restaurant. The Salumeria menu is a must and pizzas are very, very good."
"Great place for good food and cheap prices! The Profiteroles is a must for dessert, the best I've had yet. There were so many things I wanted to try but didn't get to since the menu is so extensive. I suggest you come with a large party so you can sample everything and get an order of the olive and cheese platter. All the stuff I sampled, no complaints. The Sangria, clams, salads, pastas were all yum. The Risotto however, didn't fancy me. It looked like baby food mush and tasted bland. Service could have been better though, the food came out fast but then you were left unattended to the whole night. Ask for a postcard to take home with you at the end of the night!"
"Meh. Medium. Nothing special. We were in a large group of 20-23 people, and the service wasn't bad, but the food was pathetic. Cheese and olive tray was ok, expensive and the only good thing on it was the cheese. The pizzas were pretty bad, thin crust, not a lot of sauce, very much a flatbred pizza. Wine was ok, again nothing to call home about. The bathroom attendant basically yelled at us for not tipping (hello.... didnt have my purse on me, and you would have gotten one next time had you not asked for it) and you can SEE into the men's room when you're at the sinks. Weird. Will not be going back here."
"Really fantastic gnocchi and pastas.  tried it on a recommendation from my sister, and will absolutely be returning"
"Don't come here for the pizza. I really like pizza but I wouldn't pay to eat theirs again. Decent variety of beer at prices that won't hurt your feelings. Wine was reasonable. They give you tiny glasses for every beverage except water. Everything comes with bread, which is nice. Service was pretty swell. Our waitress showed personality and her attendance at our table was timely and appropriate. The waitstaff was very accommodating to our large crowd, adding another table to our main one despite the resulting lack of walking space. There was a variety of people at the restaurant, from hipsters to suits to intellectuals to a woman wearing a sleeveless sweater. Didn't mind the crowd except for the constant laughing of the guy in the enormous turtleneck. Someone should have punched him in the face."
"I love going here with a large group of friends prior to a night out. We get a ton of appetizers and share, have a bottle or two (or four) of wine, service has always been great, nice outdoor seating area, good experiences here."
"This place would get 3.5 stars if Yelp let me give half stars, but since the Manager was super nice/accomodating and it's always nice to round up, why not give 4 stars?  The food deserves 3 stars because it is good, but not amazing, but the service (mostly because of the manager but the rest of the waitstaff was super nice too) is a solid 4 stars.  The best dish of the evening was the pappardelle.  The tomato and beef sauce was really nice, as was the texture of the homemade pasta.  I thought the gnocchi was a little underseasoned and over-garlicked (to the point where when the waiter put it down on the table there was this cloud of garlic that came with it), but they could have been very good with a few minor tweaks.  The side of broccoli rabe was very nicely seasoned and cooked.  The scallops were nicely cooked, but didn't blow me away in terms of flavor, etc.  I have definitely had better scallops before, but I have also had worse.  Let's see, what else did we try?  The veal meatballs were again nicely cooked and tender, but I thought the raisins and the sauce made them a little too sweet.  The polenta fries were ok, but slightly underseasoned and a little on the dense side.  I also wasn't in love with the dipping sauce.  I also thought the caprese salad was just ok - I have had better fresh mozzarella and better tomatoes elsewhere.  But all in all, the food was pretty decent.  Oh and I thought the carafe of house red wine was pretty decent too."
"This is not a fancy place, but if you are looking for a reasonably priced casual Italian restaurant with cheap wine, this place is perfect! The food is good, it is made to share so you order a bunch of small plates and they bring it out as its ready. You can order wine in many different sizes, and the wine prices are very reasonable! There is a huge selection of pizzas and a nice selection of different pasta's. There is outdoor seating, as well as a couple nice rooms fro private dinning upstairs. I have been here many times, and the staff have been very friendly and helpful. It does get pretty crowded, so I would recommend making a reservation if you dont want to have to wait."
"great concept of Italian tapas.  Food high quality, unusual menu items, great friendly service.  A bit noisy."
"Awful, just awful experience. My friend was in town from LA to celebrate her birthday and some other guests recommended Quartino. So one of the other people made a reservation for 10 people at 9pm. I was running late thinking it was no biggie. What they hadn't told the person who made the reservation was that they won't seat you without your full party. So my friend sent me a text to let me know that and I called the restaurant. They were pretty blase about the whole thing, despite me saying we weren't told, it was my friend's birthday, and I couldn't get there for 20 minutes. I had to spend the money on a taxi (plus an added $3 for atm charge) to get there. Then we had to wait more time once I arrived. Basically what happened is that they didn't have a table for us at all at 9. They could've easily pushed apart their 4 and 6 people tables to make two groups if they'd had one (because we ended up only having 6 people), but they just plain didn't have one for us at all. And when I called the guy was rude and said my party hadn't told him how many people were coming, despite the fact that they had indeed as soon as they got there. Or all he needed to do was count them and then add me, the person on the phone. But no. So my poor friends were stuck waiting for 30 minutes because of no table and the fact that they didn't mention the situation with every person having to be there. On the plus side, once we called them on what they'd done and they remembered I'd said it was my friend's Birthday we were there for, they comped us our first round of drinks (and told us as they were seating us that they would), which was $64 (we paid them back by each getting an $10-$12 drink). It was a nice gesture, but in no way made up for their table screw up. On to the food. Not traditional Italian at all and pretty small portions. I grew up half Italian and spent a lot of time eating at my little Italian grandmother's at the holidays. They tried to tell us it's an Italian thing to have small portions, but let me tell you, it most certainly is not. Not where my family is from at least. Prices were too high for the amount offered. At the end of the night, I ended up giving a tip of $11 despite not eating any of the food due to health issues. I spent $25 when I should have only spent around $7 ($2.25 red line fare and tip for the bellini I was comped). Ridiculous waste of time and money. Just beware if you go there that you MUST have *ALL* members of your party for them to seat you. And they probably won't tell you that up front either. Be prepared for them not to care if you call and ask for your party to be allowed to sit. Horrible customer service. I won't ever go there again."
"Your best bet for dining downtown at a place that isn't a chain, doesn't suck, and won't cost you this month's rent to afford. The servers are very friendly, and will usually crack a joke when they graze your arm with their ass while negotiating past tables on the crowded patio. The food is sort-of family style, and every single thing we ordered was superb. My Ketel One martini (with three olives) was probably the most well made martini I've ever had. I would have to say that Quartino ranks in the top 5 best dining experiences I've ever had. One note, my dining companions and I decided to finish off the perfect meal with some limoncello, which took a good 45 minutes to drink. For $5, they give you a huge amount; it's practically a goblet of sweet lemony goodness. We sat there til closing, and the owner graciously asked us to join him for a drink at the bar and gave us a card for a free pizza when we left!"
"After reading several great reviews from Aubrey & Andrea about this place, I just had to try...and boy, am I thrilled that I did.Did anyone else get the feeling that they just hit the jackpot? As far as great food, great wine and good prices go, this place cannot get any better.I know some people complained about the atmosphere, but I LOVED it. The old movies on the plasmas, the loud chatter in the background, the hustle and bustle of the waitstaff--it was great.We had the Veal Meatballs, Pesto Gnocchi (!!!!), Gorgonzola cheese, Marinated Artichokes, Proscuitto de Parma and Peach Bellini. The meatballs and gnocchi speak for themselves and are amazing--truely AMAZING. However, the Proscuitto and Gorgonzola were one of my favorite parts of the meal--they each came with three ""toppings"" to eat with the meat and cheese. The Proscuitto was accompanied by pickled cucumbers, giardinera peppers, and candied mustard fruit. And the Gorgonzola came with peach puree, grape salad, and fennel salad. SOO good.The only thing I'd change, is that I'd save room for the dessert because it sounded ridiculously good!"
"I've eaten here several times while in the downtown area, and also hosted a work event here. It was a fantastic time each and every time I have gone--the pizza's are amazing, the wine list is really fun to peruse, and the outdoor seating provides some very fun people watching. Definitely check it out if you're in the area, and if you're looking at a good event space for about 50-70 people, definitely check it out."
"Wonderful food, crazy atmosphere.  It was loud, no doubt about it, but not so loud that it felt uncomfortable.  I could still hear everything that was said by the members of my table.The food is pretty damn good--small plates of delicious Italian food--and not so very expensive that every dish feels like an extravagance.  The veal meatballs were excellent, as was the asperagus risotto.  My only complaint?  The desserts were too BIG!  I didn't feel overstuffed until the desserts hit the table, and we dug in.  If you think you want three, order one.  If you think you want four, order two.  They seem HUGE as compared to the other food portions (but they're also delicious)."
"Italian tapas bar? It is fun, it is unique and has Italian movies playing on tv's. 5 of us ate for $200 and that included a fair amount of alcohol. It is better to take a group and get more choices. I wish I could rate the zeppole but they were OUT!They also seated us at 10pm."
"Our first day in Chicago we were walking around in Bloomingdale's and a staff member started talking to us and told us we had to try this place and I am so glad we listened! Went there late night on Thursday for some apps and dessert. This place is one of the few that serves a full menu of food until 1-2am. Boyfriend got the bone marrow and veal slider. Then we ordered a ton of dessert. Got a banana sundae which I didn't like. Hot chocolate cake topped with vanilla gelato was delicious and we took the tiramisu to go and it was absolutely amazing! Tapas style restaurant with very reasonable prices, and good size portions with great quality - I look forward to coming back next time I'm in Chicago. Top it all off our server was great! He was so helpful and made the whole experience even better!"
"This place was blah. Made the mistake of coming on a Saturday nite and it was so busy and loud. So loud. LOL. The veggie pizza was ok. Different so maybe thats why I didnt appreciate it as much. It had spinach, cauliflower, asparagus, tomato sauce and lite cheese. There was also some other vegetable in there that I couldn't figure out. My fettuccine was terrible!!!! OVERCOOKED!!!!! LOL!!!! It was sticky and rough. NASTY!!!! It was just all stuck together in a big clump. Just a mess. Not gonna return."
"This is a great place to go with a group.  We went for my bachelorette party last year and it was a great opportunity to share a lot of different dishes.  They have a good selection of cheap wines although the bellinis are my favorite.  I've always had good service except for the last time we were there when my waiter forgot one of my dishes and gave the wrong dish to another member of my group.My favorites are the fondue, caprese salad, scallops, prosciuotto, and for desert the chocolate fondue or profiteroles.  I always get the same things whenever I go, they're like old favorites to me.  And I like eating tapas so I can eat as little or as much as I like."
"I want to like this place more, because it has potential, but I just can justify giving one more star. We made reservations well in advance for our culinary tour across America, and my boyfriend is a chef so we are all about tapas style cuisine. The hostess had an issue finding our reservation and told us to wait 20 minutes in the bar. The cocktail waitress was downright rude when we asked to pay for our drinks right away, as the hostess called our name five minutes later. We already had cash and a tip out and nicely asked the cocktail waitress to transfer our bar tab to our table in the dining room. She literally refused and rudely ""asked"" ""dont you guys mind paying here?"" I was immediately turned off based on our first impression. Being in the restaurant industry we know how to tip and we know rudeness when we see it, doing exactly the opposite of a specific guest request is a big no-no where we come from in Las Vegas and NYC but anyways... Thank goodness our server was great, he is truly the only reason we are giving three stars instead of two. He was excellent, attentive, knowledgable and apologetic for the few little snafus from the kitchen. (He didn't even know about the situation at the bar.) Anyways, the ambiance was cool, I liked the candelabras with real candles on the bigger tables and the decor. I know this is a personal thing, but the tiny little ""shot glass"" looking things they serve with the wine carafes are one of my pet peeves. I want my pinot noir to aerate properly, one glass at a time, in a nice big red wine glass. Their glasses made me, a pretty avid wine drinker, want to drink less. And one glass was skunked, but our server got me another one and it was better so no worries, that happens sometimes. The food was underwhelming, almost as if it had been awesome at one point and then, well, I don't know, but the food had so much potential to be great! The cheese fondue was ok, the cured meats were good, The bone marrow was horribly over done and the bread crumbs on top were overwhelming. The veal meatballs were not good at all, in fact, they took so long our server took them off of the bill before they ever arrived.  The eggplant was great, and the parpadelle was ok, but the pasta was overcooked. Our server did everything he could to make our experience better, and we appreciate his efforts. If it weren't for our server going above and beyond, I would take away another star. Skip Quartino and go to the Purple Pig in a heartbeat!"
"Very cute place, fun for lunch and happy hour, especially during the summer when you can sit outside. I love thin crust pizza (sorry Lou!) and Quartino's makes a great pizza! I also love the tapas style portions...the only dish that wasn't the best was the risotto, which I expected to be better. If you have to wait for a table you can sit at the bar and get a bottle of wine!"
The food was good. Service was OK but won't go back. Too many tourists. I get the whole supposed feel of the place but were practically sitting on the next table. I had to get out of my chair every time a server went by. The girl sitting behind us felt it necessary to flip her rather long hair every five minutes which kept hitting someone at our table. All the food at the same time five minutes after we ordered.
The food was ok... Not WOW at all!
"Quartino's  makes me feel like I'm back in Italy. Although people call their food ""tapas"", it's not - it's just how food is served in Italy (smaller first plate, then the main plate). I've been to Quartino's many  many times now and have brought a variety of people there. The service varies but the food is consistent. I've eaten outside and in a private upper area, and sound was not a problem in those areas. The main eating area and the bar area, however, can be very very loud and are very crowded.  The prices are very reasonable, especially for its location. The restaurant isn't too busy in off-hours, so I'd recommend adjusting your eating schedule on weekends and walk by in an off-hour and eat outside in the warm weather. The valet is the cheapest in the area, too!They have a variety of wines that comes in a variety of sizes - very convenient. Everyone seemed satisfied with their wines. The Bellini is awesome - I'm absolutely addicted!! It's white wine mixed with pureed peaches. It's an absolute must for you to order meats and cheeses from the salumeria menu (quartinochicago.com/menu…) - try two meats and two cheeses for a good variety. You may have to ask the waiter for the salumeria menu - sometimes they don't automatically bring it to the restaurant diners. But if you're visiting late night on the weekend, this menu is great to curb your late-night appetite! And right when they bring the order, ask for more bread because they definitely do not bring enough and ask for olive oil if it's not on the table. The gnocchi is a little softer than it should be, but it is flavorful. The sea scallops have been improved since my first visit, and is my favorite item now (I often crave the sea scallops and sometimes get them at other restaurants, but Quartino's  sea scallops is the best to me). The Prime Angus Beef Tagliata is excellent and the organic chicken is good - very moist. All my friends seemed happy with their pizza, and many friends rely on the quatro formaggio on their regular visits. As for how much to order per person, I usually order from the salumeria menu or a smaller plate to share and then one of the larger plates for me. I believe their prices have slowly been increasing by a dollar every few months. Their hot small plates are $8, their pasta and risotto is $9 and the specialty plates (including sea scallops) are now $16 (I swear these used to be $12). I'll keep coming back to this restaurant to keep experimenting. Their reasonable prices make for a guilt-free dinner. Plus, I'll keep coming back for their Bellini's!!!**Update** Yes, their prices keep increasing. Sea Scallops are now $19. Risotto is now $10-12. The hot small plates are still $7-10. Also, they no longer have the wooden fork thingies, so you're just supposed to magically transfer food from the salumaria menu onto your bread... I still love the place, though."
"I went around this time last year and dined on the patio with my boyfriend.  Between the two of us, although we are young, we have a combined total of about 14 years of restaurant experience.  That's why I feel compelled to lower the rating for this restaurant because of the service- or lack thereof.  It was our first time at the restaurant and both of us would have preferred a server willing to take the time to explain some of the finer points of the menu.  She did not do that and so we did not get the full experience because we were ignorant about the menu.It is one of the nicer outdoor dining areas in this particular section of the city however.  The food was good, wish the service was up to par!"
"Quartino gets a 4 stars from me for being a convenient place to get a quick and delicious bite without stress.  I love the outdoor sidewalk dining, their family style of service and the Salumeria.  Cheese, curied meats, fruit and olives... the fastest way to my heart is throught the salty-savory...."
"Can't say enough about how great Quartino's is.  Drinks were great, Food was fantastic, service was wonderful and an excelllent ambiance.  Loved, Loved, Loved.  I don't think we will go downtown again without eating at Quartino's!  I highly reccomend."
"Definitely a great place to go with a group.  Fun small plates to share.  We love the octopus and the gnocchi in particular.  The house wine is quite good, and it's the best one could imagine with italian tapas."
"Chicago has had a surge of enotecas, an Italian combination of a bistro, wine bar, and tapas place. Hugo Ralli and Steve Lombardo, best known for their Chicago standards of Gibson's and Hugo's Frog Bar (reviews forthcoming), have entered into this hot new fray with Quartino, a challenger just a block away from the new Lettuce Entertain You enoteca, Osteria via Stato. Sadly, like many things Hugo and Steve do, this is more about show than substance, but especially so here. The tables are jammed together worse than your traditional kosher delis, with floors and walls that reflect sound everywhere, coupled with a fairly hip, arrogant, (and thus) loud crowd; in toto, it makes for a lousy dining experience. The waiters think they're funny with their pushy attitude; it simply doesn't work in this environment, coming off as almost boorish instead. The dishes were hit and miss in quality, more good than not (though nothing especially great), and forget about asking for anything done a certain way by the kitchen; it's clearly a production line that has a stock set of formulae and don't even bother trying to mess with it. Their marinated fare was perhaps their best; I had a housemade (or so claimed) giardinara that was kind of nice, and some of the dried meats seemed tasty enough. Like the patrons and the service, though, much of the food was brash, unsubtle, and overbearing. Example: sweet potato fries were big and overbreaded; tasty, but in a way that makes you go, ""okay, I get the point, stop shouting."" The red pepper sauce that came with them was nearly identical.Their true win is the wine, and the fact that they named themselves after their wine presentation sort of shows at least they're aware of what they're hawking. Moderately priced choices of truly average wines abound, in carafes as small as the quartino so you can have many choices on the table. They serve the old style diner water glasses for you to take small pours from quartinos so you can get little tastes of just about everything your party orders (and I'm sure this encourages a sort of ""endless drinking"" concept that reflects well on the final tab). Since I tend to dine with highly discriminating wine enthusiasts, we found ourselves with a couple of quartinos of almost drinkable fermented grapes. I think one of my fellow diners would have labelled it as ""good for kids"" (meaning people my age and younger) but not worthy of a serious (think ""your parents' age"") wine drinker's time.After a Friday at Orchestra Hall, if I need a Ralli and Lombardo place to stop at for an early dinner (as was the old family tradition), it's going to be Hugo's, not this place. In fact, I don't think I'll ever go here again... unless I have some friends who are just in love with the place, and I don't care if I can hear what they are saying during dinner.Pros: Trendy, easy mix and match of food and wineCons: Loud, obnoxious, mediocre foodSummary: One of the more disappointing new Chicago enotecas if you actually care about the whole experience."
"I made a reservation for 9 pm this past Saturday, and specifically requested to be seated outdoors. Whoever answered the phone said that was definitely ""do-able"". When we arrived, this was not the case.  The hostess said there was an hour and a half wait for an outdoor table and we could only be seated indoors.  First of all, there were at least 6 tables open outside.  I'm pretty sure the server for the outdoor area just wanted to go home.  I've eaten here before, and while the food is definitely good, there are plenty more Italian restaurants in the area with better food and DEFINITELY better service!  Bye, bye Quartino."
"Italian small plates (ie Italian tapas) = genius.  We ordered a ton, ate a ton.  Yes, it did get loud.  They really pack the people into the main dining area.  I imagine that the patio on a cool day would be a great option.The veal meatballs were delightful.  The dark chocolate fondue: the food of my dreams.  There is not one item that I didn't enjoy/love except maybe the hearts of romaine salad.I'd go here again in a heartbeat, but might try to plan it on a nice night so I could sit outside..."
"This place had been very hyped up to me before I went, and maybe that was a bad thing.  I can't say anything negative about it, really.  Though it definitely was loud and crowded on a Friday evening.  I had one of the risotto dishes, which was more like a rice dish.  I am used to risotto being more creamy and soft, and this wasn't like that.  It was good, it just wasn't what I expected.  The antipasti appetizers were wonderful, and the quarts of wine were great.  I liked the reasonable portions for the meal, but then when dessert came, they gave me a dessert to feed three people!  So that was a surprise, and since I have no willpower, and still hear my mother in my head telling me to clean my plate, well - I ate the whole thing.  It was the lemon tart dessert, and it was worth every bite."
"I had two friends in town who were visiting Loyola, so this was a close spot to stop for dinner.  Let me just say that I loved everything I tried.  Being that Quartino is a sharing place - I had some awesome fondue, pizza with sausage, two kinds of pasta and some cheap house wine.  The bill was about $20 per person!  I will return and bring more friends and family.  One negative is the restaurant is loud, so 4 people is probably a good limit if you want to be able to hear."
"Quartino is not really a great date restaurant or place to enjoy a nice intimate conversation but it is an incredibly fun restaurant to go to with a group of friends.  I came here with three friends and it was a fantastic experience.As a party of four, we were able to try a great variety of dishes, we ordered the gnocchi, ravioli, tortellini, mushroom risotto, orecchiette, and a zucchini pizza as well as sorbets, gelatos, and fried donuts for dessert.  Needless to say we were very full afterwards.  The food was all nice and simple (as it should be), delicious, and rich.  All this for $26 a person including tax and tip (I consider that a pretty good deal).The service was surprisingly good for such a large and crowded restaurant and the food came quickly enough so that we could order as we ate.  The noise level was fine if you are expecting it and it was good for masking our sometimes obscene conversation.In all, this is a very fun restaurant with great food for a reasonable price."
"I love restaurants.  All kinds.  I've eaten in 4 star fine dining restaurants and zero star greasy spoons.  I don't mind spending the money, but the sum must equal the parts and unfortunately, this place misses on each part.  I went there on someone else's dime for my birthday dinner.  I had heard about this place, but never tried it, and I was excited.Atmosphere:  Are you kidding me?  This place is beautiful and located in the heart of the city.  You walk in to classic design and within moments are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the crowd.  And I'm not joking when I say this place is as loud as some concerts I've been to.  We had to wait a few minutes in the crowded, noisy foyer, then were led upstairs to our table.  The upstairs is beautiful, but it felt like we just stepped on the field at a bears game, complete with the roar of the crowd.  My headache began to throb,  There must have been 40 women in the room at different tables, all of them cackling and shouting to be heard over the roar of the crowd and the others at their tables that were screeching inane stories about lotion.  The noise did get slightly better after 10 pm, but was unbearable.  The restaurant played vaccuous trance in the background.  Yuck.The Food:Here's the deal, tapas is an awesome concept.  The spanish do this with much success with a combination of (usually) exceptional small plates of food that run from $5-$10,  Everyone shares and everyone gets to try something different.  Italian food, however, does not translate well when you charge ridiculous amounts of money for small portions of underwhelmingly average food.  We ordered a braised lamb shank for (if I recall) close to $20,  After I ate the approximately 2 ounces of tender, poorly seasoned, meat, I found myself giggling at the idea that I could have had 5 times the meat for the same money at a nicer, quieter, more relaxed fine dining establishment.  The Asparagus Risotto was bland and decidedly missing salt, pepper, flavor....  It was about 1/2 a cup of Risotto and cost us $14 (maybe it was $12, close enough).    We ordered other stuff too, but none of it was what I would call reasonably priced or anywhere close to exceptional.  This concept COULD work if they made fantastic food and charged 30% less, but as it stands the food is ridiculously expensive and sadly mediocre.The Bill:We had 3 people.  Each of us had a cocktail and some food.  We were there for dinner, but none of us left feeling anything close to full.  Our tab, including tip, was $155.  For that money, the three of us could have enjoyed a fabulous meal at Wildfire (or Opera, or giocco, or bob chinns or froggy's or, well just about anywhere), walked out having enjoyed our conversations and feeling like gluttonous pigs.The staff:I've worked in restaurants for close to a decade (at least I used to in a former career).  You don't have to be very good when you don't have to bring out the food in order (they don't) or on time (they bring it whenever), and you don't have to be very good when your customers can't hear a word you say and you can't hear them either.  We resorted to hand signals for water refills and to answer what looked liked (i'm not very good at lip reading in the dark) 'Is everything okay?""  The girl who served our table was nice enough (from her smile - I think she said thank you, but I couldn't tell).  I can't fault her.  I'm not terribly sure if I had the chance to hear her voice.Overall:Avoid.  Besides the crowd, this place is expensive and the food just isn't very good.  You can spend far less on tasty spansih tapas and enjoy a more reasonable atmosphere down the street at Iberico.  You can spend just a hair more and enjoy brazzaz or Fogo de Chao and feel like your money was well spent.  $12 tapas plates  that taste like the Olive Garden master chefs made it isn't enough to sell this place.  Why waste your money on below average food so you can sit in a room with your friends and be unable to converse due to crowd noise?I'm not only unimpressed with Quartino, I'm downright dissapointed.  The folks that gave this place great reviews need to try some other places.  I guarantee that you'll realize that your opinion was goofy.Now, had they served big plates for that money, I'd be saying that it was a reasonably placed, sort of generic eatery with mediocre food, but with little plates it makes the diner feel like a fool when the bill comes."
"Decent food but entirely too crowded and noisy. It doesn't really feel like it's about the food here, but the location and the crowd. No thanks unless it's an off time and that's where I happen to be!"
"The atmospshere at Quartino is a little rowdy for Italian.  I usually associate Italian with relaxed dinners over red wine and nice conversation.  This place was a little less conversation, and a little more action.  My tin topped table for four was tiny and cramped, but if you skinny that's shouldn't be a problem.  The pizza was authentic northern Italian and definitely a highlight of the evening.  Pass on the gnochi.  Yes to the eggplant appetizer and Romane heart salad.  Excellent value for your money and a great way to sample many dishes.  Sorry, but I need to save my 4 and 5 star reviews for 4 and 5 start joints.  Still, Quartino gets recommended."
"Quartino is one of my favorite places for dinner in my neighborhood. The service is always good, I have always been able to make a reservation the day of, and the food and wine are excellent and very affordable. I highly recommend the cheese fondue, which I get every time, although I usually have to ask for more bread because they don't bring much. This is an especially great place to come with a group of friends because you can order several different dishes and a few carafes of wine without spending an arm and a leg."
"Small plates at an Italian restaurant - it's like every girl's dream! What surprised me about this place is I don't usually pick Italian as a place to go out for dinner - pasta, blah, cream sauce, blah, pizza, blah. I can make all of that at home. But this place changed my mind. PLUS, they have CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP wine!!! Went here with a friend and we each got a 1/4 carafe of wine for $6. I thought I was reading the menu wrong, but no. I received a cute little carafe with just enough wine to warm me up on the inside and make me want to have deep, philosophical conversations:) And this place isn't just about cheap wine - the food was outstanding. We ordered the clams in wine sauce - super garlicky and salty and we got extra bread to sop up all the delicious sauce. Then we got the tortellini in Alfredo sauce with prosciutto, peas, and ham - WOWSA! I would never order this on my own because I don't even like Alfredo sauce, but my friend convinced me to try it and I may now be a convert. The sauce was the best I've ever had - like the most decadent Parmesan just melting in your mouth. I honestly could go back every other day and eat that stuff. And then the pizza was great - nice thin crust with quality ingredients. So for about $25 bucks a piece, we stuffed our faces with good food, drank tasty, cheap wine, and had great wine-fueled girl talk. One thing to watch out for - don't try and eat clams if tipsy. I flung one across the aisle and almost took out our waitress. They were very nice about it and asked if I would like another carafe of wine.:)"
"I was recently here while visiting Chicago. The food was pretty tasty and the price was right but I found the restaurant a little soul-less overall. Probably a great place for a large group because it's spacious and seems to be able to handle capacity but nothing special for a small group. Very tourist friendly, which might explain the weekend lunchtime crowd."
"I have been here dozens upon dozens of times and not even a few slow servers can change my opinion.  Don't go here expecting Maggiano's and their ""we live in fat america"" portions.  Quartino's is classic Italy when it comes to portions and it's ideal for a night out of great food, cheap wine, and getting to leave without feeling like total dog shit/too full.I adore the ambiance, love the low key approach to dining.  It's meant to feel like you are in your own kitchen (hence the open kitchen atmosphere, kitchen towels for napkins) and it's heavenly for someone looking for a great satisfying and social meal without breaking the bank.Plates are small, but completely satisfiying.  Antipasti is always reliable, delicious, and fresh.  The tortellini with proscuitto, peas and alfredo is TO DIE FOR, the orechietti is always reliable and delicious, the spinach and pizzas are fabulous, and the chocolate torte with vanilla gelato is sinful.You will not regret this meal and if you do, you are completely uptight and impossible to please.  If you don't like Quartino, try an Italian joint that's 4 times the price and who spends the meal kissing your butt and perhaps you'll leave happy.Always a winner. Perfect for dates, dinner with the girls, dinner with the family (preferably Italian), and everything in between.Did I mention it's ridiculously affordable?  When it comes down to it, everything in life is a game of ""you get what you paid for"" and Quartino   will remain a staple in my life in Chicago.One negative:  Pizza with pears and walnuts...not so good.  And only snag the Stefano if you like it spicy!!! (as in sausage)"
"Sooo wonderful!! Ate an drank a ton and the bill was $60 for two people...total!!! Parpadelle was awesome and veal meatball sliders mmmmm not to be missed!! The wait was long, but expected. Luckily we snagged a seat at the bar and had some cheap vino to hold us over."
"Great location, casual atmosphere, real Italian food... love it! Portions are small, so I'd get 1.5 dishes per person.Recommend:Tortellini w/ prosciuttoLinguini w/clam (white sauce)Eggplant appetizer"
"Quartino is an Italian tapas place.Anyone else see something inherently wrong with that statement above?  It's OK if you don't.  We'll talk about it later.  For now, let's talk about the restaurant.My girlfriend and I went to Quartino with a wonderful couple who are probably our most worldly friends.  He is a very smart economics professor and spends a lot of time traveling the globe attending conferences and teaching in cool places like Barcelona, Zurich, and MIT.  She is a wonderfully talented woman who has decided to take the LSAT just for fun and can play the koto.  And they like to photograph their food.  Wherever they travel or go out to eat, they will take a camera and photograph what they ordered - usually the dessert.  We get photo albums online from them all the time and 90% of the photos are of what they ate.  ""Here's our last meal in Prague!""So, we've established that they're cool people to hang out with and a total hoot.  They know food and love to eat it.  I went to Quartino with reasonably high expectations and a good appetite.  I only knew walking in that it was an Italian place.Right away little things started to present themselves and harsh on my mellow.  Like, it was crowded, and loud.  REALLY loud.  Like, I could not understand what my friends were saying at our own table loud.  The decor is nice in the place, but it is a a strange mix of things: there is some white tile like its an Italian deli (and a meat counter to match) there are some nice fancy touches like its a really chic designer restaurant, and there are TV screens and a bar like it's, uhm, a bar.  All of these things are competing for attention in this smallish, low-ceilinged place and it creates a somewhat chaotic environment.  The TV's were showing some old Italian films and the one I spent a lot of time watching and reading the subtitles of was a delightful early Fellini film the name of which I missed but really came to enjoy.  It was, unfortunately, at the expense of me paying attention to my food and my dinner companions, but I could not hear them talk at all and the food ... well, I guess it's time to talk about that first statement.It is my uneducated opinion that Italian food is not meant to be served tapas style.  It just does not work that way.  Italians like to eat.  In Rome, one sits down to dinner at about 8:30 at the earliest, and you do not get up before 11:00.  It's just not done.  The food comes slow, steady, and in copious amounts.  There is bread, wine, conversation, perhaps a little music.  It is a time for friends, relaxation, ending the hard work day in style and comfort.  Loud and convivial is OK but not at the expense of your conversation.Quartino takes all of these Italian eating fundamentals and turns them on their head.  The place really needs to decide what it's doing, 'cuz it's not hanging together.  The whole tapas thing is that you get these tiny plates with a little food on it.  What self-respecting Italian eats like that?  Plus, is Quartino a deli-style place?  They serve decent (not great) charcuterie (look it up) and cheeses and have a good wine selection and some good looking pizzas.  They could run with that and be a wonderful place?  Do they need the TV screens?  Do they need the tapas?  Do I really want to go to an Italian place and have ONE single piece of octopus?  Or ONE tablespoon of an admittedly great and difficult to prepare asparagus risotto?  Do I really want to shout over the din of 75 people in the bar watching the sports channel?  Do I really need a Fellini film to tell me I'm in an Italian restaurant?I dunno, Quartino.  Italian tapas?  Your messing with something that's been perfected since the time of the Roman emperors.  I seriously considered giving you three stars just 'cuz the food was good and many other people seem to like it.  And the food was good, don't get me wrong.  But someone there needs to decide what the place is going to be, and I think they'll have a real winner."
"Fun place for after work drink and small bites, find myself here afterwork and before going out for dinner. Love the prices on the wines that they offer."
"Went here for my birthday last year. Yuck is the word that comes to mind. Not only did we wait forever to dine al fresco, but the food was less than stellar. This is the Italian version of tapas, I guess. Yes, I know that different regions of Italy have different dishes, but I can't say I've ever had a nastier Italian meal--until Quartino."
"This place is yummy and reasonable!!!  They even have gluten-free pasta!    Most everything is good, but stay away from the mushroom risotto - it just doesn't taste right.  I've given it a shot twice, and it tasted funny both times.  The last time I went, we tried the salumeria.  Michael, the waiter, chose a great selection for us.  Much better than anything we could've picked ourselves.  There was duck salami, crazy stuff.  In addition, my co-worker has a pretty bad reaction to gluten (I only have a mild reaction now and again).  He asked that the 2 gluten-free pasta dishes be cooked in new water so he didn't get sick from the contamination.  They ended up messing up and our dishes didn't come for about 15 minutes after the other 2 pasta dishes.  The manager came up and apologized to us and removed both dishes from the bill.  I'm so impressed!!These guys are also open super late on weekdays.  Made for a good place to go after a couple hours at the climbing gym or working out."
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago!  Great for sharing, reasonably priced, excellent Italian red wines, great atmosphere, wonderful service.  Great pick for Italian food lovers and Winos!"
"Great selection of aged italian meats, cheeses.  The thin crust pizzas are also quite good.  Never had an entrée because I always start with an assortment of the above.  Great 1930s/40s atmosphere too!"
"Tonight was my fourth time visiting Quartino.  My friends and I met after work to have dinner and to help celebrate an engagement.  Our waitress was kind enough to bring us some champagne to honor the occasion.  Very nice, totally unexpected, loved it!When you go, make sure to order the cheese fondue and the gnocchi.  If I had been raised without manners, I would have been licking the fondue pot clean - yes, it's that good.  The gnocchi is great because they add pesto to the sauce.  My third favorite dish would have to be the asparagus risotto.  It's very rich and creamy.  Anyway, I think it's a great place to dine with friends and/or family.  The tapas idea works great for this Italian restaurant.  They also have a selection of wine (both red and white) that are exclusive to Quartino.  I did not drink it tonight, but I have enjoyed the red wine from Multipulciano during past visits."
"Best Italian food I've had.  Everything comes out exactly when it's ready, so the wait is almost nonexistant.  A little loud, but the food more than makes up for it.  I highly recommend the asparagus risotto and the cavatelli...it looks simple but it is amazing!  They say the ""wine is cheaper than the water"" here, not sure if I agree with that, but the wine prices are fair for sure."
"If you are looking for a quiet laid back place for nice relaxing evening... keep looking, this is not the place for you tonight! I was shocked with how loud it was, but  I feel that cannot be held against the restaurant... that's just the kind of place it is and atmosphere it offers. SERVICE: 3. 5  stars: Our server was very nice and helpful with food and wine suggestions but because the restaurant was SO packed and SO busy he wasn't able to provide us with the service we needed and was not to be seen for long spans of time. FOOD: I thought the pizza ""Margareta"" cannot remember the exact spelling on the menu, was delicious, but a little tough. The organic chicken breast with beans was really good, the shrimp risotto wasso-so and the mozzarella with tomatoes was super fresh. I did not taste the lamb, because, well, yuck, lamb, but looked great!! ATMOSPHERE: Guess I don't have to talk about that again, loud, loud, up, awake, bustling, but if your up for that kind of evening, I guess it's OK! Overall, they do a good job here!:)"
"I had been meaning to try this place out since it opened, and finally got around to it when some work colleagues were in town for a convention.  We each selected a few different tapas-style dishes and shared amongst the table.  We even had a vegan in our group, and the waitress was quick to make some suggestions for what to order.  We also ordered a couple carafes of wine and some martinis, then finished off with some limoncello.  Everyone raved about dinner.  Will definitely return here.  Be aware that this place is usually crowded (we came on a Tuesday night), so reservations are recommended if you don't want to wait too long.  Also, because of the crowds, it does get noisy here.  Best to come here with a group that wants to be in a lively setting."
"Quartino is one of my favorite go-tos.  Whenever I have a friend in town visiting, I suggest venturing to this place for its adorable, tasty Italian tapas and a lively atmosphere.  I've always had excellent service here, and it seems that whoever I bring to this place ends up telling their friends about the joint.   Great people watching during the summer on the outdoor patio. My one critique - there is ALWAYS a crowd, so it can get pretty noisy...try to avoid a first date here."
"This is the third time I have eaten at Quartinos. I think this is a hit or miss type of place. I have had great dishes and not so great dishes. Last night was a not so great. Zucchini pizza was very good, pancetta wrapped dates not very; asparagus risotto was completely tasteless and had a poor consistency, but the caprese salad was tasty. We ended the night sharing the chocolate soufflé cake. It was delicious-- until the last bite. There was a couple hardened pieces of flour that I unfortunately bit down on. Not a memorable meal and probably won't go back."
"This is a place for many occasions, but none better then getting off of work around 10:00pm and going to have some charcuterie, cheese and wine with your co-workers after a long night. The place usually is quiet by then and it is nice to just relax. Full bar service, sit in the restaurant and watch some old Italian movie and make up your own dialogue or just zone out over a pizza. Regardless, it is a great place to relax with fair prices, good service and great ambiance."
"if you're looking for a quiet evening at a cozy italian restaurant, this is not the place to go. however, the food is great at quartino. we actually went here for my mom's 60th because we heard from an italian restaurant owner in quincy (my hometown) that this was a great place for italian food in chicago. they have a salumeria and fresh bread that they cut in the middle of the restaurant (not sure what the point of this is, but maybe it seems more fresh?). you can start out by choosing from a list of several DOC antipasti. we had the prosciutto and three kinds of italian cheeses that they paired with all sorts of accoutrements. We also had the caprese salad which was really fresh even though tomatoes are no where near in season. also had the cavatelli, penne with vodka sauce (one of the best dishes of the night), the short ribs (so tasty!), and the salmon. we tried several of their desserts, but my favs were the profiteroles and the nutella panini. based solely on the food, i give quartino four stars, but just know what you're in for with the noise and commotion.good to eat: anything from DOC list, short ribs, penne with vodka sauce, nutella panini"
"Just went here for the first time last week. I'd heard mixed things about it, but overall I was pleased.  The restaurant was so loud and the table we were sat at was so large that we actually had to switch tables so we could hold a conversation.  Aside from that, the meal was fun.  I loved the funghi pizza.  Yes, I felt weird ordering a funghi pizza but it was quite yummy.  We all shared a few dishes and didn't have anything to drink...so I was very happy with the bill when it came.  It was CHEAP.  Definitely worth a try."
"For it being in the heart of the downtown restaurant district, this place seats people pretty swiftly (if you consider 1 hour wait swift considering we didn't make reservations). The dining room is really crowded and tables are set so close together it probably only has room for your legs to move through. It's a loud dining room so if you want to go for a heart to heart talk and meal, this might not be the place. But, considering it was a saturday night in a packed house, the waiter was on it like no other. Trying to get refills on our waters was a little tough but the waiter was very prompt with ordering, delivering drinks, etc. This is a great place for a different kind of tapas...Italian style. We loved going to Iberico because of the spanish tapas and low prices, and I think Quartino really gives us an alternative to that - Italian family style dining for a decent price. They give you a sheet full of meats, cheeses, and olives where you can mark the amount of each you would like and it comes in a shared plate. The meats were pretty good but my Italian friend commented that one of the meats was ""not good"" to the waiter (the meat was really dry and appeared more like jerky than cured meat). That was all he said. The waiter immediately sent in another order with fresher slices and comped us both orders of that particular meat. We got a pizza bianca and the pizza was very deliciously baked fresh and flavors were well balanced. We also got the steamed clams, which were so so, nothing to write home about. The asparagus risotto was alright, it was tasty but again, nothing to write home about. I think we should have stuck with more main Italian dishes like gnocchi or more pizzas since I saw some unbelievable pizzas and small plates around.For dessert we got a caramelized banana with their vanilla gelato. It was absolutely divine and was a HUGE portion for 3 people. The limoncello was also very tasty and according to the said Italian friend, it was ""just like how my dad made it."" For the restaurant to be located where it is, I was expecting to pay a lot more for the food, but it was surprisingly fair and the foods were of high quality. I'd definitely bring visitors to Quartino next time and make sure to make reservations earlier!"
I came here the other day and it was delicious. It was my second time coming here. Its great because they have small portions if you don't like to eat a lot or if you want to try a bunch of different portions. We got the cheese platter with raisin bread which was delicious and these veal sliders which were excellent.
LOVE IT!  We went here for my birthday dinner before going out.  It was DELISH!  The bellini's were AMAZING!!!  We each ordered a dish and shared and the food was amazing!  The asparagus risotto is TO DIE FOR!!  We of course had dessert and it was amazing!  I HIGHLY recommend Quartinos....GREAT place to go with girl friends!!!!!
"My parents were in town and we needed a good place for lunch on Saturday.  A friend didn't give Quartino rave reviews, but I thought we might try it anyway cause it looked pretty reasonably priced from the online menu.  I didn't realize that the menu was served in small plate style.  We ordered the spaghetti with pomodoro sauce, the pork ravioli while was served with bacon and a brown sauce, the italian sausage with onions, peppers, and red sauce, and lastly, the caprese salad.  Everything was very good, especially the pomodoro sauce (which the waiter recommended and was like marinara but had cherry yellow  and red tomatoes in it) and the ravioli, which had a great brown sauce and thin cut bacon on top.  I even liked the sausage, which got extra stars since it didn't have caraway seeds!  The caprese salad was fresh and good, but I've had that at so many restaurants that it's hard to really wow me with one.  Mom and I split the peach bellini, which was sweet and delicious.  However, I'm 100% sure the menu's claim that Quartino is the only restaurant where ""wine is cheaper than water"" is false advertising. I didn't get dessert cause I was looking forward to Berry Chill across the street, but the fried pieces of dough with chocolate dipping sauce looked delicious - I will have to try them next time.  One other thing I must mention is the definition of the salumeria, which is basically a make your own antipasto salad tray.  You get a piece of paper (sushi restaurant style) and select the olives, cheeses, and imported meats you would like brought out to you.  It's a really cool idea, so I'll be trying that next time as well.Can't wait for a warm weekend to sit out on their patio, drink wine, and invent my own antipasto salad."
"The food was good, not Super Duper, but good. I was already a bit ticked off since I had an 8:30 reservation and they did not seat us until 9:15. Not only did they seat us late, they never apologized or offered up and perks for their tardiness! Its a good atmosphere, although very, very loud -- and I don't thinks its just that I am getting old!So go when you have a lot of time, or wait until they get their ACT under control. GOOD cheap Wine! always a PLUS!"
"Woohoo - it rocked! Italian tapas, how could you go wrong?! Food was great, service was great too.  The wine was flowing and gave me a terrific hangover the next day. We got a table outside and stayed for 3 hours! Great place for big groups, girls night out, etc.  Eat, drink and be merry at Quartino!"
Food so great. The waiters are very friendly and helpful. I love every single dish. Save some space for Zeppolo.
"Not much else to say here that other Yelpers haven't said but I still feel a review is in order. This is the first place we ate at when considering moving to Chicago. It's got a lively feel that's loud but I think that's part of the experience. We dine here frequently and try something new every time. The service is fast, the drinks are cheap and the food is really good. When friends from out of town now come to stay with us, this is first place we recommend.The only thing keeping this from five stars is the noise, close tables and the bathroom attendant that looked offended when I only gave him a dollar."
"Meh - this place is incredible generic and bland.  Let me start off by saying, I only give 5 stars to place when I walk out thinking, ""that was one of the best meals I've ever had!""  I have yet to feel that way about a single restaurant in this city (and I love Chicago).This restaurant came highly recommended by several friends - which I now realize don't have very good taste in food - hee hee.  We went here with a group of 16 after a stroll downtown looking at some of the Christmas decorations.  One star is for how well they handled a group of 16.  We had a preset menu of tapas picked by the friend that made the reservation.  The calamari was by far the worst I've ever had.  Under seasoned, rubbery, the marinara was super bland.  Also, am I the only one that think the wine list is terrible?!  I saw some woman buying the $5 bottles in the foyer as they left and thought to myself, ""what were they thinking?!""  I'm all about inexpensive, great wine - but you'll only fine inexpensive terrible wine here."
"One of my most favorite places in Chicago - the pizza, scallops, pasta, profiteroles and carafe of bellinis are the best!"
"who: tha girlswhat: fungi pizza, calamari, eggplant parmigiana and a CARAFE of vinowhen: post workwhere: din and drinks at Quartinowhy: we do what we wantwe were seated after a relatively painless wait then wined and dined like queens. we were more than satisfied with the eats. the pizza was cooked to perfection and we fell in love with the sauce at first taste. the calamari was also nice and generous. i'm talkin BIG, glorious pieces of squid coated in num num. the bill came and our jaws dropped.  not because the number was astronomically high but we thought that we did some major damage.  turns out, Q gets your bang for your buck! :)i'd highly recommend quartino for a girl's night or a date with the sig other."
"This place is great, its a perfect place to entertain clients as well as go with friends.  I love small plates so that is perfect.  If your focus is on drinks, conversation and a fun atmosphere this place is perfect.  Culinary aficionados might want to look elsewhere as at my most recent visits the food and service have been lacking.  My last few visits have made me categorize this under ""Fancy Bar Food""."
"This is a great restaurant!  Inexpensive, tasty, and the atmosphere is boisterous and fun.  Getting a table on Friday (even when it was PACKED) was no trouble at all.  I enjoyed the house wine served by the carafe, and the sauteed spinach was delicious.  My server (I think her name was Carrie) was fast, friendly, and helpful.  I'll definitely be back for more!  Grazie!"
"I really wanted to like this place. I like the concept. However, I have given this place two chances and have not been very happy with the food either time. It just does not taste good, at all. I have tried the polenta fries, margharita pizza and one of the salads. It was all just bad tasting. I couldn't even finish the salad because the dressing tasted horrible. I don't get it."
"I love this place.  I had a big birthday dinner here as well as a small family dinner, so it can be a versatile spot.  You can't go wrong with the pizzas, and the ravioli and risottos are yummy, too.  Also love the decent house wines by the carafe.  The dishes (besides the pizzas) can be on the smaller size so order accordingly (ex. one order of Ravioli probably wouldn't be enough to fill me for a meal).  Always packed, and it can definitely get loud both upstairs and downstairs, but I love the vibe and energy that emanates from this place ..."
"I just went to this place the other evening and it was wonderful. We came straight from work so it wasn't packed which was very nice. By the time we left around 7:30 it was packed (this was a Tuesday evening). I do agree that it gets a little loud and that can be annoying at times. The service was wonderful. We ordered the fondue and were having problems keeping the candle lit. Our server found the tallest server and he climbed up on a chair and turned our fan off. In addition, they kept our bread and water in supply. I love the fact that you can order small carafes, large carafes, or bottles. Since we were a group of 4 we went with the one litre carafe of this house Pinot Grigio and were happy. They don't short change you, the wine is good, and they weren't pushy about ordering more (even though we did). The food was very good. I went with a group of picky eaters so we weren't that adventurous. We had the sausage pizza, fondue with apples, penne alla vodka, fettuccine, and the spinach salad. The only thing that I wouldn't suggest was the salad. there was little to no dressing and was just flat. I loved the fondue and would go back just to get the fondue and some wine one evening. In addition, we had the chocolate fondue with bananas and strawberries for dessert. It was amazing the chocolate was rich, dark, and plentiful. Another definite must for the table. I can't wait to go back and try the clams and mussels. They also have a lovely outside dining area that will be great once it warms up a little more. I would stop here either for dinner or for a drink and appetizer or two after work."
"Good solid and reasonably priced. It's a good choice.  Seems like a good place for groups but the food was good, better than Scoozi."
"I'm sure that everything that I could say has been said already. Went there early with some friends for dinner on a Friday night. It was already crowded! Definitely a good idea to make reservations and come on time (they won't sit your party until everyone is there.) Food was good but not insanely memorable. However, there was something about the atmosphere that I really enjoyed. Reminded me of my time in Italy."
"I'm not a big fan of pizza, but I like Quartino! Pizza was good and I like their Apple dipp'n Cheese, we ordered some red and white wine, they are good, One thing I don't really like is the dining area is so crowd and so loud, I was hardly to talk. Service was not bad but not too good, and their dishes are not pricey, so I guess still worth it to go again!"
"I felt a little bit like a tourist walking into Quartino due to it's distinct location at State and Ontario, but I was pleasantly surprised at how great the food is. I absolutely love Spanish tapas because you get to try a little bit of everything. This place is the Italian version of tapas, so I recommend going here with a lot of people and trying one of everything. The pastas are deliciously creamy and rich, and it's ok to order a couple because you don't have to eat the whole thing by yourself. One of my favorite dishes was polenta fries with red pepper sauce. It was just a unique dish that I've never seen anywhere. A great twist to the regular french fry. The salads are good. The spinach one was fairly large, enough to split between a few people. When I'm looking for a good place to eat downtown, I will definitely be back here."
"Quartino is fantastic.  I made reservations for Saturday at 730 for my husband's birthday.  We got there and the place was jam packed.  The weather was nice out that the outside seating was completely full.  We had a party of 7 so it was a perfect place to eat because we were able to pick 2 different pizzas and a bunch of small plates.  Everything was delish from the wines to the after dinner coffee and everything in between.  We had 2 bottles of Lambrusco (my hubb's fave) and then a liter of the Sangiovese (my fave).  We ordered the margarita pizza, spicy sausage pizza, 2 caprese salads, orecchiette with sausage ragu, penne with vodka sauce, the veal skirt steak, veal Milanese, shrimp, octopus, and capacola with a side of hot giardinara.  Everything was extremely flavorful.  The shrimp was a little bit overooked, but everyone still gobbled it up.  My faves were the spicey sausage pizza, caprese, and veal skirt steak.  The skirt steak was so tender and juicy and came with a side of arugula.  We ate it all up and were stuffed.  We capped off the dinner with some expresso and cappuccinos.  The service was decent, our server was friendly and gave us suggestions for some of his favorites.  It's all served tapas style made to share and there was enough of everything to please even the pickiest eaters.  We had one vegetarian with us and from the pizza, to the salad, and the pasta he was stuffed by the end of the meal.  I absolutely loved Quartino and we'll definitely be coming back.  Only issue I saw was just space wise, it was really crowded and kind of cramped.  For a table of 7, we were squeezed into a table that was a tad bit too small.  But we dealt with it.  We live in the burbs, but for me this place is worth driving to the city for dinner.  We loved it."
"Been here a few times and always had a great meal! Tapas style italian and a great selection of all kinds of dishes. Great for groups. It is loud and a fun place to eat. Also, they have great wine for very cheap (Their tagline is ""where the wine is cheaper than the water"""
Love this place. close to my office. never tried based on a co-workers bad experience. however I loved it. will go back.
"A great place to get a drink after work, but get here early!  I went to meet up with some friends yesterday (a Monday) and by 7PM there was not an empty seat in the house.  Bar area can get very loud and chaotic as they use a loudspeaker to call on people who's tables are ready.  Nice wine list and great sausage pizza."
"mmmmm! My only complaint would be the closeness of the tables and the noise level, but it all adds to the ambiance. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend the fondue and gnocchi! This would be a great place for a big group; especially because you could try everyone's food!!"
"This place is, over rated and not great. Went there on a Saturday night for my sister's birthday. We got reservations, we all showed up on time and still waited 25 minutes to be seated. The girls at the front, perhaps having a rough night, but I found them very rude as did most of the people waiting. The food was not at all what I was expecting. Very disappointing and I will probably never go back. For the small servings I expected the taste to be very bold and savor every piece. This did not happen. The best thing is the wine which you can buy so I would go again, buy some wine and get some better food else where."
"This place is an absolute gem. So many of the items have a flair about them that is hard to find at anyplace with reasonable prices. And the true-Italiano approach to eating, where you take your time, and graze on one thing after another (as opposed to gorging yourself on one huge plate of whatever)  There are plenty of smaller bites to consider, from the beet salad, the olive and salumi selections, and the olive samplers. The pizza has a real-roma feel to it, not like most American pizza with a much lighter touch on the toppings and sauce. And the wine is varied, plentiful, and very reasonably priced. Beware that this place is pretty loud inside, but other than that, this place is wonderful."
"I have been here twice, and was impressed both times. I like an Italian place that doesn't shove a week's worth of food on one plate for you. I came here about two weeks ago for a college reunion with 7 of my friends. I like the hustle and bustle of this place. I also enjoyed that we could be as loud as we wanted and no one stared us down. Because in all honesty, when 8 girls get together, that haven't seen eachother in awhile, it tends to get noisy. Yes you don't get a ton of room to move around in, but it's an Italian restaurant. When have you ever gone to an Italian restaurant where you weren't all crammed in? For those people complaining, you really should have expected it. The food also suited our large group. I liked that we could order a bunch of plates and just pass around. This way, we all got to try a little of everything and I left full, but not stuffed. From the pizza to the risotto, everything was very good and well prepared. The sangria was also very tasty, and I liked the fact that wine and sangria came in a variety of sizes. Now, for the reason that I deducted one star: our miserable server. Now, usually when you are in a larger group, they add the tip to the bill beforehand. However, they didn't do this here, which was fine. Our waiter did tell us the tip was not included. I'm sure we could have figured it out, us all being college grads, but it was fine that he mentioned it. What I did mind was that he came back a second time to tell us the tip wasn't included. Ok then. Then, as if we didn't hear it enough, when the credit card girls signed over their receipts, he asked if we had included a tip! I mean come on! Rude and rude and bad service. We shouldn't have left you anything...."
"I recently visited Chicago, one of my favorite towns, and my friend and I ate at this amazing italian place. It was on a Tuesday afternoon, they have a beautiful terrace outside, so, summer time, it is a pleasure to sit there and enjoy the beat of the city. We had a salad, very fresh, great mozzarella cheese. Also, we ordered a pizza, light cheese, well done! It was delicious, that type which is a little crunchy when it is well done (not the mushy one you get some places --- nothing wrong with that, if you are into those types of pizza!!! but we like it crunchy!!!). The wine was very good, the nice thing is that you can order half bottles, so it is perfect for 2 people. As desert, we ordered profiterol!!! VERY GOOD! Highly recommended. Over all, a GREAT place. Service was nice and prompt. Oh, almost forgot, we ordered also a side of prosciutto, goes well with olive oil and toasted bread (we asked for it and the staff was very nice to toast the bread for us!!). Very affordable, a lot of big parties. It is a little noisy once it gets crowded, but still bearable. Can't wait to go back to Chicago."
The food here is Italian-style tapas which is good.  We got a few things to share and I was surprised by how much I liked the Quattro Stagioni pizza.  Even more flavorful than I expected.
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE x infinity this place!!! The food here is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! You won't be sorry you waited 30 mins over your reservation time squeezed between a hundred people by the bar/waiting area. I had a reservation for 20+ for my birthday. Our servers were great and came by constantly to take our orders. We didn't know the dishes would be small so we kept trying different things. The wine was good and reasonably priced, so we ordered at least 8 bottles. My husband loved the arugula pizza and he still talks about it. The manager came by and asked us if we wanted to try a variety of dishes...on the house!!! I ended up sharing my birthday cupcakes with the manager and servers. Thank you for a delicious 30th!"
"Quatrino has quickly become a standby for us. Friends in town on a random saturday? We'll probably wind up here. And why not? It's like a large, friendly trattoria, really casual ambience, the wines are a great bang for the buck, pizzas are great, as are most of the small plate choices. I especially like the salumeria mix and match options. Only downside is the scary decibel levels in here - can be fun when you're with a crowd yourself, but not the right restaurant for meaningful conversation."
"Great atmosphere, amazing service, incredible food. Loved it!!"
"I feel bad about only giving this place 3 stars, but I just left feeling like I wish I knew Italian and wasn't ready to rave about any of the food.My fiance and I came in early on a Saturday afternoon after walking around all day and were ravished.  Unfortunately, when I opened the menu, I had trouble figuring out exactly what I wanted.  I was glad the waitress gave us the low-down that sharing plates is recommended, and she was able to point me to a cheese plate that turned out to be great, since I was clueless just staring at the menu.  We also had the prosciutto plate, which was good as well.  The only thing I struggled with was exactly what to do with each of the accompanying foods.  Do I combine them, eat them separately, by hand, by fork?  I'm sure it didn't matter, but I wanted to do it properly.  After sampling the different meat and cheese combinations, we ordered the spaghetti arrabiata and gnocchi.  The gnocchi arrived swimming in olive oil, which kind of turned me off, but it was still tasty.  However, once we had picked all of the gnocchi out of the dish, we both struggled to eat the accompanying green beans, which had long since drowned.  Poor things.  The arrabiata wasn't as spicy as my fiance expected, but I thought it was just right (which means it wasn't spicy at all).  Overall, I thought the place had a great atmosphere.  It was typical Italian, with tables seated in close proximity to another, but not to the point where I've felt I was rubbing elbows with other diners.  Our waitress was great.  I'm sure we'll come back to the bar, but probably not for dinner."
"My marathon team went to Quartino to carbo-load on Friday night, and the place was hoppin' (as I expected).  It's a big place, but it still felt really crowded - people were bumping and jostling me in my seat all night.  The service was just okay - our waiter was friendly, but he largely disappeared after taking our orders and it was tough to flag him down if we needed something.  Also, the food runners did that thing that I HATE - where they bring the food out and ""auction"" it off because they have no idea who ordered what?  Yeah, very amateur, and it made for an unpleasant experience since we'd be in the middle of a conversation and have to stop to yell across the table, ""Guys, who ordered the fettucini???""  As far as the food itself, it was just okay.  I ordered shrimp, and while they tasted good, they were so overcooked and rubbery that I could barely chew them.  The orecchiete pasta with some sort of meat ragu was fine, though the pasta was a little too al dente for my liking.  This just wasn't a place that I would rush back to."
The food was good but the portions were a little small. I ordered the sea scallops for $15 and was surprised to receive only three.
"Excellent place...Went with 2 friends last night and had a great dining experience. It was loud, crowded, and trendy but what does one expect on a Sat. night, right? The night started out on a funny note...My last name is prounced like Jackson Pollack...not POLLOCK...The hostess kept blaring out, ""POLLOCK, party of three""...Not so cool...Once seated, our server was amazingly attentive, knowlegable, and nice-a rarity these days.. The food was all tasty and VERY reasonably priced...Overall, a great experience and I would love to go back..."
"food here is ok - hit or miss on what we ordered.1)  octopus appetizer - don't bother.  2)  pizza with the arugula on top - bother, it was good3)  romaine salad - good, small4)  the italian donuts - get only the chocolate sauce, they charge extra for the honey, although they didn't say that when we ordered itthe server was not that nice.  when we asked where out pizza was - because not kidding, we were waiting for 20 min - she said it's coming - like we were being impatient.  i just don't think it's ok to have that kind of attitude when there was nothing preceding that except to take our order.   if your customer has a question - don't go on the defensive.  i liked the ideas of the dishes, but service coupled with not great food quality will make it a place i won't go back.meh.  i've experienced better."
"Quartino is located on the near north side of Chicago in an area that attracts many tourists as well as locals. This was our first time dining there and we had an experience I've never had before and may never have again. The atmosphere is noisy and friendly (Sat night)--a big place but they take good care of customers and we didn't have to wait at all to be seated with a 7 PM reservation. The food is very good. It's not fine dining; it's small plates, Italian, and you can get away with a really good individual pizza for $10-12 or you can spend more and try various plates. Wine was good, nice beer selection, and you can order all at once or try appetizers, salads, olives, etc and then pick out some entree plates. We had pizzas, duck, potato pancakes, salads, seafood and it was all good. The unbelievable part, however, was the service. The waitress stopped by often enough to see that we were ok but was never hovering. Everything arrived fine except for some scallops. We were not unhappy or annoyed but reminded her and she apologized profusely, which was more than enough especially since the restaurant was very busy and we were enjoying ourselves and had plenty to eat. The scallops came and they were comped. And then the potato pancake came and we were told that was comped too. And then a plate with three salads arrived that we hadn't ordered, compliments of the restaurant. THEN the manager stopped by and apologized and asked us if he could buy us more wine; we declined due to rapidly filling bellies. He told us dessert would be provided--also comped--and in a bit we watched in amazement (as did all the diners around us) as  1) a bananas/ice cream concoction, 2) a huge chunk of tiramisu, 3) an individual chocolate cake with ice cream, and 4) six beignets with dipping sauces began arriving at our table. We were in shock (and shared our good fortune with nearby diners). All of this was comped, because our scallops plate got lost in the shuffle. I cannot say enough about this place and we will definitely plan to go back, but folks looking for a good unpretentious place to eat and folks visiting should know that this is a great value and they WILL take care of you. It's not like we were regular customers or celebrities. They really wanted us to be happy. So go eat there! You'll be glad you did!"
"I've had some decent food at this restaurant in the recent past, but today was a dining experience NOT to remember. Friends from out-of-town wanted a ""Chicago vibe"" and a menu 6 people could graze off of.  I'll cut to the quick.  3 of us ordered Bloody Mary's that were, honestly, the worst I can remember...watery and bitter as if someone has p*ssed in them.  Pancetta wrapped dates were greasy and tiny (midget dates?!). Angus Beef carpaccio was not only pink (""is that veal?"" asked my guest) but draped off the edges of the plate. Gross. Pizza were obviously rushed out of the kitchen, sloppy and visually unappealing (one was literally covered with basil leaves such that you couldn't see the pizza). Polenta sticks were yummy. Ravioli stuffed with veal was just a mess. I'll leave it at that. Extremely unappetizing. Good news is that the waiter comped our Bloodies, but the food preparation and presentation was unbelievably poor - especially in the middle of a city that knows good food. I won't be back any time soon."
"my mom told me never to say no to a free drink.  thanks, mom!i dragged my boyfriend (see review of Bite) along to my first yelp event.  at first the line for free bellinis was disappointingly long, but lucky for me, it kept getting shorter.  and shorter.  and then they'd give me two at a time.  and then we realized the glasses were really just shot glasses.  and then, we drank more.i really can't say a freaking thing about the place itself.   i mean, i had what, um... 2 bellinis?  8?  12?  not sure.  i do remember the staff saying ""that's the last champagne bottle?!@??!"" amused at our drinking proficiency.  yeah.there was also food.  it was all stuff i could have made, but am way too lazy.  it's pretty nice.  but unremarkable.ben says that the silverware of the quartino is of the best quality for pointing at people.  you see, while they were snappy to collect dishes and glasses the moment they hit the table empty, the silverware, it for some reason stayed in ben's hand.  and it was his ideal poining tool, point-in-conversation-making tool, and brandishing tool for the night.  yea for ben-who-didn't-really-go-to-prison (yeah, that was a joke) and all that."
"Wonderful lovely place with great food, awesome atmosphere. Probably this is as Italian as it gets. I am so sad that there is not such a place in Boston, the only place in Boston that comes close is ""Trattoria Toscana"", but even thats a different class of restaurant. And: Very affordable, great value!"
"I really enjoyed my experience at Quartino. The service was excellent, our waitress was very attentive and tried to help us choose nice wines to go with our meals and tastes. My water glass was never empty, which is something I definitely watch out for! The manager even stopped by and said hello. The food was great, same with the wine selection. I liked the smaller plates, we went for lunch after work and it was the perfect amount of food to share, in my opinion sampling food and wine made the meal more fun than usual."
"I have been going to this restaurant for the past 2 years, and it has been a place that doesn't disappoint. I especially love it during the summer time, since they have a nice outside seating on State street. You get the same feel as if you were on a cafe / restaurant in Paris, full of life, right in the middle of the vibrant city. The inside is also very pleasant, they have a large space, on 2 floors. It can get a little too noisy, especially in the afternoon, after. During weekends it gets crowded as well, so make sure you call in advance to check on the waiting time and / or make a reservation. It has a laid back feel to it, the servers have always been very laid back too, but in a positive way. Me and my friend always order the same thing (thin crust pizza, well done, which is very nice and crispy; tomato & mozzarella salad - very fresh; some fried polenta - for a touch of some greasy food). Bottom line: a very good Italian restaurant, laid back, casual, nice atmosphere, good service; good for large groups; not good for a quiet romantic dinner, since a little too noisy."
Was there with a big group for a Bachelorette party and we had to wait longer than expected.  They gave us free wine and dessert for the entire night.
"Group dining reigns here. With the small plate sharing, a long wine list, and the busy energy from a packed restaurant, this place is perfect for a gathering of friends to try some decent food, laugh loudly, and enjoy themselves. Even the way the food is delievered to the table, which is whenever the dish is ready it will come out to you, encourages a group experience. And yes, the resturant was loud and several employees ran about with very important things to do which made me feel I was bugging them if I wanted something like a drink refill, but thankfully our server was low key, patient, and attentive. Even when my wife didn't like a dish she ordered, our server, which I wish I would have asked him his name to give him some props here, simply took the dish away, didn't charge us for it, and offered her something else to try. No big deal. No odd looks. No drama. Easy peasy. Very thankful for that. The food in general is tasty. Nothing amazing stood out but nothing caused me to be dissapointed. The Duck Prosciutto Pizza was interesting and I think my favorite thing I tried but the other pasta dishes and appetizers were just fine. Overall this place is enjoyable. In a group. And would go again. In a group. A romantic, intimate, quiet restaurant for a date night this is not."
"I loved this place! Came here on a date with my bf visiting from out of town. Was expecting it to be very expensive but it turned out to be more than reasonable. We got the sausage pizza--apparently their best pick as well! It was a beautifully created pizza with perfect crust-I swear! The beer was cheap as well and the dessert -doughnuts! So beautiful and enough for 4 ppl! I pass this place everyday to go to work and I always want to go in for another taste. I would def. recommend this place to anyone looking for a non-traditional Chicago-style pizza place, aka--not anything like Giordanos or Ginos!"
"This place gets PACKED- so make a reservation or be prepared to wait. You can wait in the bar area for your table or try anf grab a bar table- but that area is always packed as well.The food here is really good, hence the long waits and busy nights. I have only been here once and took advantage of the 'wine cheaper than beer' so I don't specifically remember what we ordered. I know we got the antipasti platter- which is great because you get to pick your meats and cheeses. I know we ordered gnocchi which was also good....and that's about all I remember about the food.The service, however, not very good. Three or four servers came up to us after about 20 minutes with no drinks asking to take our order, even though we had just ordered drinks.Once the food came, a server was no where to be found...same to say for when we wanted our check...It was super busy that night, so I'll give them that. Just felt like I should mention it as a heads up if you want a romantic night out- this place is LOUD. But that is Quartino so if you don't like it, don't go there.I will definitely be back because the management is great and always walking around making sure people are happy.Great place for groups!"
"I came here for lunch, which is the best time for me to try restaurants, as I'm not a fan of crowds.  The Bruschetta was awesome, and the bartender recommended an excellent white to compliment my seafood.  Also, the Boraxo handsoap in the ladies room was an excellent touch!  The people are so nice here!"
"Great meal for 2 under $50. Started out with the fried calamari which was extremely fresh and tender accompanied with lemon slices and the usual marinara. A Bottle of the house red which was $12. Entree was the grilled organic veal skirt steak served over arugula with a balsamic reduction to sauce the plate. Also had the porcini crusted tuna salad  as an in between course but was not impressed at all, definitely skippable. Make sure to finish up with the signature limoncello to help you digest. Delicious!"
"I heart Quartinos!  I'm usually not a big thin crust girl but damn do I love their pizza!  Great food, sweet wine list, fun atmosphere and nice staff.  Jackpot."
"Quartino is absolutely awesome!  Service is tops - last week it was Lindsay.  The week before it was Joshua.  Food is fabulous. Atmosphere is lively and unpretentious!  To think it took me this long to find you!  I guess I'm glad ...I might have eaten my weight in cheese, risotto and pizza by now."
"I liked this place because the wine and food was inexpensive because you can order small portions.  The fondue was delicious.  The seating outside was a little crowded and noisy, but overall a good experience and I would like to go back."
You may never know what a craving really is until you try Quartino.  It evokes every emotion and memory of your Grandmother's cooking without your cheeks getting pinched.
"I don't really remember much about my meal here other than waiting for my dining companion who was getting sick upstairs.  She says it was the mussels, but I ate them and felt fine.  I think it was the wine.  I guess I would go here again if I was stuck in the touristy, mall part of Chicago, but nothing here wowed me."
"I stumbled upon this delight because i received a gift certificate at a Liver Foundation fundraiser. So, I did what all ladies do, grabbed my nearest four pals and headed out for free eats. Little did we realize that HEAVENLY eats would be awaiting us. Unreal! We ate like little kings and queens. Amazing service, tasty pizzas, the fresh cheeses and variety of wines were all so tasty. I think we tried almost everything from the Salumeria menu...and delightful and some veggie friendly options! Words cannot describe how much I adore this restaurant. I will be back next time I'm in Chicago!"
"Amazing pizza!The outside seating is great, and inside the atmosphere is exciting!.  Its a lively place, but not too loud to hear everyone at the table.  Good for a group, or a date, and the wine for sale was 50% off.   .... don't forget to order a bellini!."
"I really enjoyed this restaurant, service was just ok but food was good. I had the gnocchi and caprese salad...both delicious. My friend ordered pizza and well, that wasn't so great. But pizza from a restaurant doesn't taste as good as pizza from pizzeria in Italy either."
"Love it! A friend's uncle is the head chef so we get stuff for free so I am a bit biased but still it's great. Authentic Italian, they show old Italian films on tv screens throughout. My favorite restaurant in town."
"The food is good, especially the roasted octopus and the Salumeria, but there is lack of variety for frequent diners. Thin crust pizza is very good, too. The best part is the inexpensive but excellent wine. Service is variable: some very attentive staff, some rather indifferent. Sometimes, service can feel a bit rushed. If you plan on having a traditional meal with appetizer, entree and dessert, make sure to order one at a time. Otherwise, everything may arrive at the same time. The weak point is that this place is usually VERY loud."
"This place looked more like a Salumeria and so that is what we ordered..sure they have pizza but my husband makes great pizza, so we got the duck prosciutto and the breseaola..both were good, but the duck was just great, spicy and good mix of fatty and lean.  We also ordered a smoked cow/sheeps cheese which was also great. That plus bread plus vegetables and we were set. Oh and wine, did I mention wine? A great selection of mostly Italian but some   South American and very reasonably priced.  Ordered a half plus a quarter liter, so basically a bottle for $15 which is unheard of in California...so when are they opening a branch in San Francisco?"
The antipasto was to die for!!!!! The service was first rate.
"I really don't know what all the fuss is all about at Quartino. The place is huge, the line is long, but the food is definitely nothing to brag about. I came here friday night with another couple, and we tried a variety of items from the mushroom pizza to the ravioli and sausage risotto and also the veal meatballs and spinach salad. I've got to say the only decent item was the pizza which had a generous portion of cheese and a light airy tomato sauce. The other items and like most other items here are relatively cheap (around $10) but the serving size and quality definitely do not match the prices. The meatballs were tasty as well but also not amazing. I might return again to try some other items on the menu, but it's not worth all the support. If anything, go to Osteria Via Stato across the street, a lot more worth for your buck."
Excellent food and atmosphere. Not expensive.Great for late night dinner.
"Always good. Always reasonably priced. This is the perfect place to meet up with friends after work, if you work downtown. They have plenty of seating, so you shouldn't ever have a problem getting in. The family style serving is fun, everyone gets to share. They have outdoor seating, but it is State Street so it is LOUD. The decor is really simple and the service is always pretty good. I always get the gnocchi and the spinach salad which are both simple and tasty. Go!"
"Finally tired Quartino last night and was not disappointed! The ""quartino"" of wine was a perfect size - about 2 glasses worth, if I were guessing. We got three dishes - polenta fries (almost like fried mozzarella without the cheese - so good), gnocchi with green beans (delicious, I could eat it ALL the time), and pizza. Neither my friend nor I liked the pizza we had selected (the Soprano) - we loved the crust and the veal sausage on it, but it was too spicy with the giardiniera for me. I'd definitely try another pizza the next time though because the crust was absolutely delicious. Totally reasonably priced - I'll definitely be back!UPDATE: When a group of students and my undergraduate advisor came to town for a conference, I needed a place for dinner for TWENTY, near the Mag Mile on a Saturday night! I called Quartino, and it was no problem at all for them. We all had a great time passing plates around and sampling a little bit of everything. Great place for a big group!"
"me and the misses had the pleasure of having a cocktail or two and a snack in the bar recently and were quite impressed by the wine list, food, and bar service. we came in on a busy Saturday lunch and our bartender, Eric was a rock star. even though he was busy he took the initiative to give us a couple samples of wine and even talk to us in great deal about the wine. he even gave us his card and told us to stop back. don't see that very often. cant wait to come back and try some more small plates and a liter of that verdicchio!"
"Went here the other night for some wine and pizza. It was late and the restaurant section was closed--not that we minded. Luckily we quickly found two open stools at the bar.I mentioned wanting to try a red ""with some kick"" and the bartender steered me to a tasty Cabernet for $12. All of the beverages here, even milk I think, are served in half carafes--fun. Of course, I drank two of them and couldn't figure out why I felt buzzed. Duh! Two carafes is probably almost 4 regular glasses of wine!The pizza was very thin, very hot and pretty tasty. My only complaint was that the basil was more of an afterthought on the margherita and not sprinkled throughout. Still, it was nice to be able to get something like that at 12:30am.The bathrooms were huge--maybe 8 stalls?--and had Borax soap in them which amused me. They also have some sort of weird feature where men and women can watch each other walk out (but not see the actual stalls. I know, I explained this poorly.)I would definitely go back. A nit-picky item: I don't understand why nice bars like this don't spring for barstools with backs! It's exhausting trying to stay straight in stools!"
"Good pizza, but everything else sucks. Cheap acidic wine for cheap prices, and our waiter told us to order three to four plates for two people, which ended up being WAY too much food. I would recommend coming here and getting a pizza to go, only."
i continue to take out-of-town visitors here and everyone continues to love quartino. energetic atmosphere and GREAT GREAT food!
"In a town where deep dish and stuffed wrangle side by side to be the reigning pie, every now and then a crispy slice of thin crust is in order. The variety available here is pretty staggering, and the freshness of the ingredients really shines through. The menu also offers up a broad range of pastas, salads, antipasti; as well as a smattering of mains... it will not be the most incomparable Italian of your life, but it will certainly line your belly. I've seen some grumbling in the other reviews about the portion size trending towards tiny. Frankly, I think you'd only think that if reared on the notion that the Olive Garden's bottomless  pasta bowl is a healthy portion (and if that's the case, I really don't want your opinions about food at all...), the poor dears. Wine is poured by the bottle or in 3 sizes of carafes. If you can imagine, I generally go for the full liter. There is a very generous 25% discount for industry, by the way... AND they sell $5 bottles of wine to-go all the way until the 2am close time."
"Finally a place where I don't have to swim in my bowl of pasta.  The portions are  perfect and the thin crust pizzas are yummm.  I enjoyed the Broccoli Rabe, Gnocchi, and Rucolina Pizza.  My only complaint is that it was too noisy and the waiters kept bumping my chair as they passed by. Very reasonably priced!"
"I have been here several times and it has not disappointed. The idea is to not order for yourself but that everything is to be shared. If you stick to this, it's a great concept. The food comes out whenever it's ready which is fun when you order multiple dishes as it makes it a longer more joyful process. Something is finished and there comes another dish to replace it. Do not order too much at once, you can always order more as you move along. The wine is great too, a nice selection to be served by the carafe instead of bottles making switching possible as well. It is crowded on weekends so be prepared to wait"
"I heart this place.  So delicious and affordable.  We were able to try almost everything.  Some appetizers/tapas, pizza, pasta, and dessert.  Everything was great and the whole bill came out to 67 bucks, that's how much Howard and I pay for a bottle of wine sometime.  So yummy!  I can't wait to plan a big event there sometime and utilize their back room."
Been here a few times....the staff is always sensational.    Food is pretty good with decent prices.   Better to come here with 1 or more people rather than alone for plate sharing.  Looking forward to trying one of their wine tasting events.   Usually crowded...best to reserve ahead of time.
"I love this place; it's one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago--lunch or dinner.  They have the best pizzas, soups and bread."
"I've eaten here several times and always enjoyed myself.  However, on my most recent visit, I felt as if I need to up the limit on my hobo stab insurance; as we were finishing our dinner outside, a man walked right up to us and asked if we were going to eat the last of our pizza, which was apparently way too close to the sidewalk to ignore.  So we parted with a slice of pizza, but we found everything else (including the 7/8ths of the pizza that we did eat) to be excellent."
"My husband and I went here for his birthday last weekend.  I honestly was not too impressed!  My husband was drawn to go there because of the wide range of homemade meats, which were very good, but you can only eat so much of that stuff.  We also got the calamari salad, eggplant parm and the mushroom bruschette.  Everything I would have to say was about average.  We also had a quartino of a medium bodied red and bellini.  I loved the bellini and he really enjoyed his wine but I still don't think I will frequent this place.  Maybe on rare occasion we would go back, but I have to say I was not pleasantly surprised."
"A cloud-less Wednesday with the sun beaming down the the breeze making the temperature a wonderful 72 degrees, there was no choice but to dine alfresco style.  Quartino was the ideal spot.Started out with the Porcini Crusted Tuna and the Eggplant Parmigiana.  The Tuna was really small but was loaded with flavor.  It was served on top of a tomato sauce relish which really made it tasty.  The Eggplant was buried under a layer of cheese and covered in marinara sauce.  Not bad, but I would've liked a little more eggplant.I had a glass of their Riesling, and nothing was more perfect than a cold (yes, cold, not slightly cold) glass of wine to go with this awesome lunch.Next, my mom and I shared the Caprese Salad and the Sea Scallops.  The salad came with two big, round cuts of buffalo mozzarella and three perfect sized tomatoes.  A topping of fresh basil and a bottom layer of aged balsamic vinegar and olive oil made this salad that much better.  I don't think I have ever tasted a fresher cut of mozzarella anywhere.  The scallops were even better.  Six plump ones serves with caper-berries and shaved garlic.  The scallops were perfectly seared and wonderfully cooked.For dessert, we ordered to Coppa al Banana and the Zeppole.  The first came in a martini glass with two big scoops of vanilla gelato, a half of a caramelized banana, fresh whip cream and topped with chocolate shavings.  For anyone who hasn't had gelato or hasn't had it in a long time, this is a real treat.  I could've eaten at least one more order, despite the large portion.  The Zeppole, which are donuts, were just OK.  You have a choice of sauce to have them with, dark chocolate or honey, and we chose the dark chocolate.  They are soaked in powdered sugar and are probably a better date dessert during a late night visit.The service was flawless and the dishes came out rapid fire style, but not to the point where our table was too full to hold them.Overall, I am very impressed with Quartino and can't wait to come again.  This is a great place to share several dishes and a glass of wine and perfect for a lazy afternoon of soaking in the sun."
"minus one star for the spinach salad but plus one for exceptional service! our waiter's name was David!Quartino opens at 1130 am. We arrived close to noon on a Friday. The restaurant filled up quickly after we ordered our food but the food still arrived in on time. Portions are small so it's fun to share your food! A stack of small plates is conveniently provided and constantly switched out. Make sure your server knows if you're not done with your food yet because they are so efficient that I almost had my unfinished food taken away twice! HahaThe food comes whenever it's ready and bread is provided. Ask for balsamic vinegar to create the perfect dipping sauce with olive oil and pepper. The bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and never ending! Our spinach salad arrived first but it was disappointing. The thin sliced pear was amazing but sparse (or maybe I just wanted more because it was so good!). Spinach tasted a little off and warm like it was cooked. I think blue cheese would've been better than the cheese they had.Clam linguine was FANTASTIC. It's the type of dish that I would want to order again even though I like to try new dishes all the time. We had the marinara sauce which I doubted at first because marinara tends to be too thick and salty. The sauce at Quartino was definitely freshly made. It was the perfect combination of whatever marinara is made of, with a light sweetness. Thin slices of garlic were the perfect compliment to the clams.Then came the pizza. Get two different toppings half and half so you can try more toppings! We had the Quattro Stagioni (tomato, mozzarella, artichokes, roasted peppers, grilled zucchini, mushrooms, and grana) and Pepperoni (neopolitan sausage, tomatoes, and mozzarella). The pepperoni was amazing to me, but the Quattro Stagioni was even better. So much flavor and if you're a cheese lover like me you'll be picking off the big pieces of grated cheese to eat on its own. And don't forget to order drinks. Sangria is only $4 and one of the best I've ever had! Sweet and doesn't taste like alcohol.About the service: Hostess recommended that we share food (great tip!). Waiter brought us a new pizza when it was actually my fault for ordering the wrong topping because there's two pizzas with similar names but they're completely different pizzas! And upon careful scrutiny we found zero traces of spit or any trace of an angry cook. Oh we were so happy! Then we ordered cappuccino with a shot of espresso but felt like it  wasn't strong enough so our waiter, David brought us a shot of espresso on the house!Btw, check out the restrooms. designed with an antique flair. Interesting soap choice. Also, if you're a classics movie fan, The Bicycle Thief plays on 4 televisions in the four corners of the restaurant. Don't wear black though cuz the white ""napkin"" which is made of some cotton material will leave lint on your clothes!A wonderful experience. Prices are reasonable. Definitely want to go back!!"
"One visit and I was completely aware of why this place has become so popular. It's well-prepared, simple Italian food served in a rustic and (as far as I know) authentic setting. The prices are pretty reasonable given the quality of the food- an outstanding value. The gig is to order smaller plates and share with your tablemates. We were a group of three and each ordered a salad and an entree which gave us a great variety and a good cross section of the menu. The dessert, a nutella panino, was just absolutely terrific and was matched perfectly with their cappucino.My only negatives- first, very minor- what's up with the low awning by the front door? I'm 6'3 and had to duck WAY under it to get in. Not very welcoming to us tall chaps! :) Second, and more of an annoyance- the three of us were seated at a very small round table, leaving very little room for placing plates on the table- at a restaurant predicated on sharing, this seemed a awfully ill-conceived. Also, because we were close to the kitchen, I was bumped and brushed by servers and bussers all evening. I accidentally elbowed a busser and felt awful about it. We adjusted the table and I pulled in my chair as close as I could to minimize the problem but with little relief. I know losing tables means losing business, but they need to consider getting rid of that table! It was the only damper on an otherwise terrific evening."
"wow so I am review # 75??? That's a whole lot of reviews, and must say something about this place.  Well let me start with it being a pretty good deal! I took my assistant and one other assistant who floats among people in my office as need arises out for a nice end to administrative assistant's week (partly to treat them, partly to get myself out of the office for a while on a Friday!)What a great pick for a workday lunch! I love the smaller plates and the sharing concept.  I wouldn't quite call it tapas style- each dish really is enough to qualify as someone's meal.  But obviously sharing is encouraged, which makes it more fun.  For 3 people, the bill only came out to $50 for a 1/2 carafe of wine, caprese, a pizza and two pasta dishes.  I thought I was reading it wrong!  I thought we were going to have to spend a lot more to get full on ""tapas"" that were priced between $6-12 each, which is why I'd hesistate to call it that.  Everything was very good, and I have been back quite a few times since then (brought my mom here for her birthday, and she raves all over again anytime I mention it!)As soon as we walked up to the front door from our cab, we were greeted by two hosts with a smile.  Inside the hosts seating customers were equally friendly.  (its a little different for dinner on weekends- while they are still friendly, they are also very very busy doing crowd control! its a nuthouse in the lobby sometimes).  The waitress on the first occasion was knowledgeable (although she seemed a bit distracted, but no big deal).  She recommended a great wine (yea I know, drinking at lunch and coming back to work, what would my clients think! :)).  I don't really remember any other wait staff sadly- although I will say they do a great job in the bar too if you order appetizers while you wait for a table It wasn't as crowded for lunch as for dinner.  The tables in our part of the restaurant weren't too packed together, and some tables were empty, so I'd highly recommend this for a long lunch.  Obviously, for dinner, its crazy packed, and very loud (wouldn't come here on a date really unless I could sit outside, or upstairs where its a tad less loud)I don't LOVE the pizza because I prefer a bit more heft to a crust (if I'm getting pizza, to me it might as well be gino's!), but for an extremely thin crust, it was still really good and the toppings made up for it.  The gnocchi was also good, as was the shrimprrissoto.  I don't generally like creamy sauces but these were not TOO heavy and very tasty. Caprese good, pastas good, meat dishes good- really I haven't had anything here that wasn't lick-your-plate good :) Obviously also a great place to come on a warm evening to sit outside- although its a little tougher to fit multiple plates on those little tables!If you come here- GET THE FONDUE! You will thank me later! I didn't discover this until a few times in- and I really would actually come here and just get fondue until I was stuffed.  Hate to admit- a friend and I actually ended up doing this before, and had a pizza go to waste (because we thought we had to order SOMETHING else)While there are a lot of good restaurants in this area, this does stand out!"
"I liked what I heard about this place on Check Please, but the food was even better than I was expecting.  We took my aunt and uncle who were in town visiting for a night. My uncle ordered one of his favorite Italian dishes, linguine and clams, and was very happy with how the chef made it.  We also ordered some of the small plates that are Quartino's specialty: roasted peppers, eggplant caponata, calamari. All were absolutely delicious.  The thin crust, gourmet pizza we ordered had an amazingly flavorful, crispy crust and perfectly balanced toppings.  And, last but far from least, the wine was wonderful--and totally affordable!  That was the biggest surprise with Quartino: the bill.  We pieced together a bunch of small dishes that ended up being completely filling, plus wine and dessert, and our total check was only a little over $90 for four people.  It was refreshingly reasonable for the quality of the food.My only hesitation on giving five stars is the factor that others have mentioned here: the noise level.  I doubt that there is much the restaurant can do about this (metal ceilings, tile walls), but it is something to keep in mind when deciding to dine there.  With my aunt and uncle in town only for a night, we would have preferred a setting that made for easier conversation.  Especially on older ears, the noise level can be a real obstacle.  And we went on a Monday night--I can't imagine the din on the weekends!  Still, the overall experience makes it well worth having to raise your voice a little."
"Like some of the other reviewers have said this place can be kind of loud, so it would not be a romantic date night sort of place.  But it is good for a large group of people to order a bunch of different things.  The reason for 3 stars is that the food only comes out 1 plate at a time no matter what, and the prices, while not bad for the area, are a little high for the quality of the food."
"gotta go 3 stars.....went with three others, and my friend made the reservation about a month prior to our visit....and we got (honest)  the WORST table in the joint.  no matter....service started off slow.  the antipasti plate was fantasticmeal was well timed.wines were excellentpolenta frites were tasty and funkysausage ravioli---yumbroccoli rabe is a nice departure.clams were sandypastas were cooked past al denteoctopus was okbread was not that gooddessert doughnuts were undercooked and a $3 upcharge for a dipping sauce for said doughnuts is a little nickel and dimey, don't you think:?"
"Has a nice, laid-back atmosphere. Food was good and affordable, as was the wine--great selection there. The portions are big, so it's easy to share. We had two pizzas and a pasta between three people, and that was more than enough. Service was friendly and though it was busy, we stayed there for a couple of hours without getting rushed."
This place is always busy!  The food is great. Usually order the ravioli or pizza's.  Great Bellini's!!!
"I'd heard good things about this restaurant and thought it was high-time I checked it out.  Boy, am I glad I did.Both in ambiance and food presentation, Quartino reminds me of Cafe Iberico - only everything is Italian-themed instead of Spanish.  We came on a weekend evening, and actually got seated immediately.  So that was really nice.All the items on the menu are meant to be shared, so my friend and I ordered the Caprese salad, the Cheese Fondue with bread, and then an order of Cavatelli (pasta in a tomato sauce with basil & ricotta).  Everything was good, but our favorite part was the Cheese Fondue.We didn't have room for dessert, but next time I think I might have to try the Chocolate Fondue with strawberries.The one interesting thing from our meal, though, was the fact that the wine glasses seemed like glorified shot glasses.  Maybe this is normal in Italy.  Who knows?"
"Skip it.  Not the worst dining experience I've had, but .... we had a reservation and still had to wait almost 30 minutes to sit down, noise level was LOUD and we couldn't have a proper conversation over dinner.  Food was overpriced and tiny (if you want people to get multiple dishes to share and enjoy then don't price them each so high, at that price I expect a full meal!)  The food was good, but nothing to write home about."
"Delicious! I'm so happy I finally got to experience what everyone is talking about. I love the appetizer where you can decide what you want- salads, olives, cheese and the crafts of wine. The margarita pizza was not what i was expecting- i wanted flatbread and used to mozarella. Other than that, great atmosphere, I would go again:)"
"Friday night I went to Quartino with 3 friends.  We had reso's for 9 pm, but one pal was late, so we didn't sit until 9:30.  The place was crazy crowded.  Neither of the hosts offered to take our coats, but a manger-esque person stopped by the table and took them for us - which was good, because people bumped into our table and chairs all night, like I said, it was crowded.Quartino is pretty loud, so my friends delegated appetizer duty to me rather than discussing all of the options - I picked the sampler.  You get to choose 2 meats, 2 cheeses, and 3 cold dishes plus all of the little relishes and sauces for $25.  A pretty great deal - it is a lot of food.  We had the duck prosciutto - heavenly, and a dried beef that was rather bland.  For cheese we had Parmesan and fontina, again, absolutely delicious.  All of the little relishes are fun to try, too.For entrees, two of my friends had the gnocchi which I enjoyed tasting, but would not have eaten an entire order of, as it was extremely rich.  I shared a pizza and the beef entree with another friend, both were phenomenal.Now on to dessert.  This place really needs a fondue sampler platter (ahem).  We made our own.  Chocolate, caramel, apples, bananas and strawberries.  At the last minute, I ordered the hot Italian donuts - GREAT choice.  The tasty little fritters were light and fluffy and piping hot, and tasted amazing as fondue items.The whole point of this place is to order food to share, which I love doing because I always try everyone's food anyway.  You can also order wine by the glass, carafe, or bottle, which is fun.For all of that food, 2 carafes of wine, one glass of prosecco, and one bottle of prosecco (yes, I really like bubbles) the bill was under $200, which I thought was great.  While the food comes out as soon as it is ready and is not staggered, we were never rushed and ended up eating and drinking until after midnight. Pros:* delicious food, easy to share, fun atmosphere, reasonably priced, not rushedCons:* really crowded, really loud, bathrooms are upstairs (that is just a pain), everyone gets their entrees at different timesAll in all, if you have a few loud friends that you want to catch up with that you enjoy sharing delicious food with - you will really enjoy Quartino."
"We went here on a friends suggestion. Another friend declined to come, stating this is the most over-rated place in Chicago. I agree with the second friend.Food was bland and severly lacked spices. The tomato sauce had NO flavor. The tables were extremely small, which is frusterating given it is a tapas place and you tend to have many plates on your table at once. Prices were expensive, around $7 - $10 per plate. Most tapas places I've been to average $5 - $7 per plate. We go tthe veal sliders - covered in bland, tastless tomato sauce so you couldn't taste the veal at all. The sliders were accompanied by a picked veggie salad, which actually had some flavor, but was just okay. We got the eggplant parmesan, which was covered in cheese and the tasteless tomato sauce, the clams, which was the best thing all evening, th beet salad, which had a weird dressing on it, making the dish a bit slimy. We got a pasta dish with apples and nuts and gorgonzola, and again, it lacked flavor. I'm not really sure how gorgonzola can lack pizazz, but they managed it. I got a savignon blanc wine, which was good. I liked that you could get different size wine carafes - quarter, half and full. Bread they served was just okay - didn't taste like fresh baked bread, which they advertised it to be. Meal was $56 before tip. I would spend my money elsewhere. Service was a 2 out of 5. They almost dropped the entire thing of steaming hot clams, with sauce, on me and my purse. Luckily, they caught it. We often had to ask for our water to be refilled, and many times the waitstaff were problem serving in the middle of the outdoor patio (instead of at the servers station, a mere 10 feet away)."
"I don't get all the great reviews.  The food is mediocre at best, the atmosphere inside, not that great.  I do like the outside seating area, it's more 'upscale' than your usual plastic tables and chairs.  The chef needs to use more salt...and I HATE salt..."
"I've walked by Quartino many times before knowing what kind of place it actually was. I had the opportunity to go here last Thursday night on a business dinner, and I was very pleasantly surprised.We had a very big table, which meant that the wine was flowing all night. Isabella W., being the food expert that she is, was at one side of the table and ordered a nice selection. My end of the table was having a hard time making decisions, so we decided to match the other side's order! Ha!Here's what ended up coming out of the oven: capri salads, mushroom risotto, sausage risotto, polenta fries, margherita pizza, scallops, meatballs, a meat and cheese platter (w/ speck!), raviolis, mostacholi, calamari, and a few other things that were passed around.The waiter was ok --- seemed to be well-versed in what we were ordering initially. Because we ordered SO MUCH food, I think he gave up in explaining every dish...and that was a little disappointing. I liked that Quartino was family-style, and it worked out well because we have a big ""family."" I'd come back here, but probably only with a nice-sized group."
"Don't have any major beefs with the restaurant--the food is decent and a good value, particularly for this part of town.  And the wine selection is pretty broad for those not getting full bottles.  I can't rate this place much higher because it seems so... Goldcoast.  Kind of corporate, kind of soul-less, like a really nice Olive Garden.  I must confess--I got stood up on an online date here, so it leaves a sour taste in my mouth.  But as I talk to people, several have met online dates here...  I think that says something about the place (big, busy, neutral, nonoffensive).  BTW:  the bathroom attendant thing is kind of creepy, as well."
I was at Quartino over the weekend for the first time in a long time. It was as good as the first few times I went when it first opened. I highly recommend any of the pizzas and the veal meatballs. The service was a bit inconsistent but friendly.
"I had some family members host a bridal shower for me at Qartino and I had a pretty nice time. The food was good, not great, but not bad either and the semi private room had a nice view of State street. The service was just ok except they were as nice as could be when a mistake was made. (Forgot a drink a nd then missed serving a plate to a person).I would go here again if someone had their heart set on it. but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again. There are too many other places in town/ that are good. I think that any of the corporate chain restaurants are lacking a bit in intimacy and quality. I want stellar not mediocre."
"My mouth waters with even the thought of Quartino. My new favorite place to take a group of people. Everything we ate was excellent. My favs are the Veal Meatballs and the Cavatelli. They have some really good wines and desserts as well. It definitely is reasonably priced. The last time we were there it was $30 per person (a group of 9). That included several dishes, 3 and a half liters of wine and a few desserts. I would definitely recommend Quartino to anyone!"
"Classy place, and not too expensive for such class. I enjoy filling out the little cards where you can choose which of the millions of small plates and appetizers you and your friends want. We were not cool enough to understand what EVOO meant, but the server was kind enough to non-condescendingly explain: extra-virgin olive oil. Really good bread, and the salami came with odd pickled garnishes. The pasta dishes were kindof hit-or-miss, but most of the food was worth politely fighting over. It was packed on a summer night."
"I forgot about this place, but then I remembered it!  A really cool idea - lots of little Italian dishes, especially because it's so hard to pick just one sometimes!  I like the decor and also the bellini is very delicious.  I ended up here late one night after work last summer and definitely plan to visit again ASAP.  I recall some tastey desserts, too.  A definite GO."
"Loved it. After checking out the menu online (and drooling) my fiance and I decided to make an impromptu trip here after work on Friday. We arrived at 6 without a reservation and were seated immediately. The second we sat down, two hands came out of nowhere, one from the left with water and one from the right with bread. Our waiter explained the menu to use and offered samples of the wine. We ended up with the cheapest red (hey we're saving for a wedding) which was pretty tasty. We started with the duck proscuitto which was yummy, if a bit fatty (but duck is) for my taste, and the taleggio cheese, which was good but probably unneccessary since we were also planning on the fonduta. The fonduta was fantastic - light and creamy, not heavy like most fondues. Our bowl of bread was replenished without us asking.  At this point we were through with one 1/2 liter of wine and on our way to full and tipsy. We decided to not go overboard and just ordered the meatballs and the polenta fries to share, and another 1/2 liter of wine. I really wanted the pesto gnocchi but I knew it would be too much (next time). The polenta fries were good, but I was expecting them to be better. The meatballs were fantastic, and I usually am not that big  a fan of meatballs. After all that, we still couldn't resist dessert. Profiteroles (excellent, depsite the topping of almonds) and lemnocello for him and some lambrusco and the nutella panini for me (heavenly, and so simple - just bread and nutella!). We ended up spening $70 for a ridiculous amount of wine, some meat and cheese, fondu, meat and starch, 2 desserts and 2  after-dinner drinks. And we ended up taking home half of the fries, meatballs, and nutella panini to eat later!I loved the fact that the liter is double the cost of the 1/2 liter, which is double the cost of the 1/4 liter. It make me feel like if I am going to end up drinking a whole liter, I don't need to decide that now. It's not like you save money buy ordering more upfront. Yes, it was loud, but we didn't mind. The only sour note came at the end, when they started clearing everything away and we felt rushed to leave (though we had been there over 2 hours and there was a line out the door). Our server came and took the signed credit card slip off the table while we were stlll sitting there, which I absolutely hate. Overall it was fantastic and I can't wait to come back!- - - Update 7/30 - Came back with two friends. We again had the fonduta and the meatballs (amazing again) but also branched out to try the fettucine (okay) caprese salad (yummy) and asparagus risotto (oh my god - so good). Service was great again and with all that plus a liter of wine and one dessert, tax and tip, we spent $80 between 3 people."
"Italian tapas. Love it! We had the veal meatballs, linguine with clams in white wine sauce, lamb shank, and the ravioli with pork filling. Each dish had very generous portions (for instance, there were five veal meatballs). I was pretty filled from eating the the meatballs and the ravioli, which I shared with my love. We ended up taking the linguine home. The bf enjoyed the lamb shank, which was cooked in a sauce that consisted of orange zest, mint, and another ingredient. I tried it but neither of us could taste the mint nor the orange zest. The linguine was simply done and was very light. I liked the kick of the pepper in the linguine. And we finally found a ravioli with no cheese filling! The bf called the ravioli a ""man's ravioli.""We went here on a Saturday night and the wait for a table was an hour long. We opted for a table in the bar, and we definitely waited less than an hour for it--perhaps 10-15 mins. We sat toward the end of the bar so there was plenty of space and not as loud as it was toward the front. Also, our waitress was very attentive and very helpful.Our total bill came to a few cents under $50. Most of the dishes we ordered were about $10. The lamb shank was about $17. I'd say the price of each dish is reasonable.Overall, I would definitely return for the food and the attentive service we got."
"I really liked the schtick Quartino is going for.  A few of us went there last week and had some wine, cheese, salumi, and salads.  We were lucky enough to get a table in the small back room, and our server didn't rush us while we socialized.  The food was good - not great.  I'd probably stop in for a snack and drink at the bar instead of a full meal."
"Definitely not the best in terms of food quality but it really is a great value.  plenty of food plus litre of wine = $50-60 plus tip for two.  If you go with a group, you can try a lot of things.  The antipasto platters are great.  pizza and pasta are both solid.  dont get the very cheapest wine, it tastes like ass.  but the others are all quite good for the price imho"
"I was in Chicago for only three nights and felt compelled to dine here two of those nights.  The first night I found out just at the end of my meal that they have house made Salumi....so I endeavored and gorged my self on the duck prosciutto.  It was such a pleasing meat.  The fat is mostly on top and not marbled throughout like a good deal of cured meat and this makes for a lovely buttery, creamy white layer on top of beautiful dark meaty goodness below.  We also had seared seared Sea Scallops that were plump, juicy and seared perfectly medium rare in lemon butter with caper berries.  Great Value.  A perfectly serviceable caprese salad, clam linguine in a mild white sauce as well as fried calamari rounded out the first night.  I forced my sister to eat some dessert which was a lemon cookie with lemon gelato.  All this and a bottle of nice Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc for $100.00  Service was quick and provided by various different persons.The next night we sat at the bar and it was outstanding.  The bar was packed with a fair amount of the popped collar crowd but when I get down to eating I don't care who is calling for ""jaegerBombs....chief"", I can block out any one.  The bar tender greeted us with a comped gnocchi that was high on our list of things to order.  More duck prosciutto and an outstanding speck which was a smoked prosciutto.  Added to these were roasted beets salad, calamari salad, asparagus risotto and Gorgonzola Dulce, and a bit of parmegiano-reggiano.  Along with the salumeri was a bit of mustardo and some pickled this and that....good, but I really need little more than cheese and meat with bread to bring me joy.  I finished off the night with a braised lamb shank (tender, succulent and I would probably have taken it with me to suck the marrow out if I had been a little less stuffed) and a asparagus risotto that was a bit disappointing after the rest of these lovely treats.  The staff was friendly, attractive (especially the girl with the short dark hair) and efficient despite it being Sunday night at 11 and the bar was slammed.  I will go out of my way to go the next time I am in Chicago if only to develop an mean case of the gout from excessive ingestion of duck prosciutto."
"I would have to say that Quartino is a very fun place to go to share a bunch of food and drinks with friends.  It is relatively inexpensive for the quality of food and location.  The place was extremely busy on Friday night but we managed to be seated within minutes of our reservation.  The bartender and server were very attentive and kept our drinks full.  We ordered the Garlic Cheese Bread, Veal Meatballs, Scallops, Caprese Salad and a pizza with Pepperoni and Sausage.  There were 3 of us there and it was the perfect amount.  I would have to say the best thing was the Caprese salad, you could tell the fresh mozz was exactly that, fresh.  It was the perfect texture and taste.  I would order everything again except the Scallops.  My wife gets them everywhere and she said they were just average.  It was definitely a fun place and the bill at the end of the night was under a $100 before tip.  You can't beat that!!"
"This place is really good!  They've got a great deal where you can get a half a sandwich and a salad for like $6!  Their bread is so good too.  Also, if you go in the summer they have a great outdoor patio!"
I feel you can get so much better quality Italian elsewhere. I usually like tapas because its fun to order lots of different dishes and have a nice variety. I have to say I wasn't impressed with the dishes I had. Also the place was just too noisy for my taste.
"This place is blah. Went with a group of seven and had to wait almost 50 minutes on a Monday - this was with a reservation! The polenta fries, calamari, and ravioli were all ordinary. The shrimp risotto sucked. The rice was undercooked and the shrimp were way overcooked. Someone ordered the breaded veal and that was good but nothing special. The steak was the same way. The desserts were unimpressive. I doubt I'll go back."
I loved the atmosphere in this place I thought it was very fun. It was crowded and loud but I liked that. The food was great! I loved being able to share so we could try different things. The Lasanga was the best and I normally don't like it. I had the sausage risotto it was excellent. The meat and cheese platter was good. The wine was good and you got a generous portion for the price. The banana dessert was good although the chewy biscotti was weird for me. The only complaint the free bread that everyone gets was not that great.  We had a great waiter and had a great first night in chicago.
"I absolutely love this place!! It is true they do have wine that is cheaper than water. This is a great place to go out with a large group of friends, especially if you like to share (tapas style). You have to try the antipasti starter, you can choose from a variety of meats, chesses, olives, and the artichoke hearts are awesome...this is a MUST! Make sure you make a reservation because this place is crowded every day of the week. Also, the best time to visit it during the summer so you can sit outside it's just like Italy!"
Had a very nice experience.  Good fast friendly service.  Prices were very reasonable.  Food was not excellent but pretty good.  Try the meatball sliders.  They were awesome.  Pizza was average.
"So accommodating!  I had a horrible experience with a restaurant down the street that had closed unexpectedly.  Quartino quickly seated us -- a party of 6 -- in the bar area and we were able to be served and get out in time for our reservations at a local show.You can't beat the prices either.  The wine carafes are great for a large group -- no need to decide between red and white.  The food is delicious and so inexpensive.   Quartino offers a great night out, fun atmosphere, good food and manages to keep your wallet full."
"Anyone who thinks this is authentic Italian needs to visit Italy. Or at least Little Italy.The food is adequate - which is where my 2 stars come from. The ambiance is crowded and kitchy - tables can be 4"" apart and there's bread, canned olive oil, and other silly crap everywhere. Service can be fair - but servers are typically running headless trying to deal with the crowd.If you haven't been, don't go. Do yourself a favor and try something like Francesca's on Taylor."
"Went for my birthday dinner the first night in Chicago. Had heard about it through friend of a friend and we were staying only 2 blocks away. Made a reservation a few hours earlier and had no problem -- were seated upon our arrival. Lovely, authentic ambience (or at least not the sense of a chain--haven't been to Italy in a while to know how authentic). Food options are great. Sharing is fabulous--I wish more restaurants designed meals for sharing! Eggplant parm was the best. Calamari was bountiful, but not amazing. Worst part--too full to have dessert! And it was my birthday!! So today we are on a mission for yummy dessert."
"While the food is very good! ( not so much the desserts), I hate the service!!!! I have gone 3 times and only once, b/c a friend was serving us, did I not feel rushed out of there.  I mean its tapas.  My group continually orders food and drinks and must shovel our food in if we do not want to be asked 10 times if they can take our plate away. Its sooooo annoying to eat there. You barely have time to talk to your company b/c every 2 seconds someone is coming over to clear your plate - even when food is still on it. Make sure to continually touch your food or you will be bothered non stop!!!!  We even asked our server once to let us please take our time with our food and the reply was 'We are trained to turn our tables over fast.'  I think I am done with this establishment. I've had enough!"
"I know it's kind of in the touristy part of Chicago, but I always love this place.  I have never had a dish here that I have been disappointed in.  And I am an Italian food snob, having spent a lot of time in Italy."
"Eh.  It was okay.  I wouldn't take my parents here if they were visiting.  I was there with a friend, we just wanted to get a little something and have some wine.  Ended up getting a few small plates (one of which my friend sent back because it smelled terrible) and a 1/2 carafe of wine.  The service was o.k.  Nothing about the restaurant was fabulous.  I was expecting something wonderful given how much people rave about the place.  Seemed a little Maggiano's to me."
"This was my first visit here as reccomended by a friend in town from Minneapolis. I had never even heard of Quartino until tonight. We were seated within 10 minutes in a gigantic cozy room. Cozy in this review equals super cramped. I ordered the pasta Pomodoro as did my friend and her daughter ordered the Mahgarita Pizza. It was a small plate of pasta and a 10"" thin pizza. The pasta was cooked a little under al Dente and the sauce was flavorful with hints of basil, oregano, pepper and loads of sliced garlic. Lots of Garlic. Very tasty. I also ended up having a slice or 2 of the pizza and it had a very gummy crust and the basil was cooked in rather than on top and there didn't seem to be any fresh sliced tomato which is the basic of a Mahgarita pizza. Prices are good for a downtown Italian restraunt, but the amount of food you get makes the $9 make sence for downtown. Small amounts, not over done and not so full you cannot move. As othev reviews say, this place is loud. There is no fabric to buffer the sound. This place was packed on a random Wednesday night in the beginning of April when there isn't much happening downtown. That in itself says a lot for this place."
"I like to think of this place as the Italian version of a Tapas restaurant. It's a great place to go with a group of friends, because the portions are good for sharing, and there are so many options the more people you have the more options you can try without breaking the bank! The pizza is really good as well, and I think it's really cute that you can order wine in a little carafe. Been more than a few times and keep going back!"
"Due to a last minute change, I was scrambling to find a place to hold my December book club meeting. Quartino's website it welcomed large parties so I figured it was a good bet. I made my reservation online with no special requests.  When I arrived, it was surprisingly loud for a Tuesday night, but it was December so there were several people celebrating the holidays.  I was beyond delighted when they sat us in a private room in the middle of the restaurant.  The food was great, the wine was delicious, everything seemed reasonably priced, and since we were in the private room we were able to talk without having to raise our voices.  All in all, an enjoyable experience."
"Quartino's is a great laid back, casual place to hang at - we enjoy sharing their small plate offerings and sitting in their bar area.  I have always found the food to be good and tasty.  I can certainly find restaurants that serve finer and more imaginative Italian food, but for this type of environment, I think the food is quite good.  I like their porcini-crusted tuna, and their risottos are also a favorite as well.  For dessert, I really think their profiteroles are delish!  It's a cute casual place to hang with friends and enjoy cheap but good wine and have a good time!"
"The first time I went to Quartino, I thought it was absolutely wonderful, but  I have been a tad bit let down the past few times.  I think the concept is great - tapas style Italian.  However, the quality of the food has been a bit lacking lately.  Also, while I enjoy a fun and crowded restaurant, Quartino takes ""pack em in"" to a whole new level.  I have been unbelievably squished into my seat on my past two visits.  Since it is in such a busy and bustling touristy area, I think it's always a good bet to bring out of town friends here - once.  However, if you are looking for a nice Italian dinner on a chill Friday or Saturday, this is not the place to go."
"What more could one want?  Fresh Italian tapas, pizza and cheap wine by the carafe?  They've really got it down.  Everything was so tasty and the service is efficient and friendly.  Not fine dining by any means but a fun place, great for goups.  I haven't tasted anything that I haven't loved.  Stays open late (midnight during the week) and a fun bar scene."
We had a family reunion gathering of ~20 people and everyone had the best time sharing wine and entrees.  The staff was great and the food outstanding.  It could not have been better!!
"Excellent place to sample a wide selection of italian whites and reds, while feasting on tapas size portions of pastas, and meat and seafood dishes.  Pizzas are cooked in a wood burning oven and are satisfying.   Lively atmosphere both during the day and night time dining hours adds to the overall dining experience."
Hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  I lived in Italy and this is the most authentic pizza I have ever found in the States.  A 'must eat' if you live or are visiting Chicago!
It was pretty good. I enjoyed our appetizer cheese platter that we designed ourselves. It was just loud and cramped. other than that..pretty awesome!
"All around good fun at Quartino!  The atmosphere is really lively, the wine is great, and the food is good, too.  (Note: its not the best food, but honestly I don't think that its trying to be ""the best."")  What you should expect at Quartino is a fun menu for sharing at very reasonable prices.  Oh yes, its definitely worth a visit."
"OK this was my first downtown dining experience and it was pretty good. Great food. Great selection with some killer desert. If a complaint was to be made it  may be that it gets loud . And I mean loud. My fiance and I could barely hear each other.Regardless, it is a great place to relax with fair prices, good service and great ambiance. As whole I think you cant go wrong. Just be sure to make reservations."
"This place ain't bad, but it's in the middle of a touristy part of town that I try to avoid. But, it's also close to my bus so sometimes after a crap day at work the wine calls me in, like last night for instance. You have to watch the prices too, cuz it will catch up to you at these ""small plates"" places. Everything I've had here is good. Nice cheese selection too. If you are so tempted to brave the bullshit tourists, go here and don't leave without ordering the polenta fries...they're genius."
"By far one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I have been there several times and it never disappoints. Everything I have ever ordered has been delicious. The scallops are a favorite as are the quatro formaggio pizza, caprese salad with mozzarella cheese that melts in your mouth and nutella paninis for dessert. Quartino is the perfect place to go with a group because the food is meant for sharing and you get to try so many different delicious things. And I have never been when its been more that $20 per person including wine! For an amazing meal and a fun night out with friends, definitely try Quartino."
They have great deals here but it fills up fast. The decor isn't my particular taste but is passable. The small plates are fun and tasty and you cannot beat the wine selections and options for tasting. I took a star off since I always seem to be bumping elbows with other people but I suppose that isn't their fault. I will continue to go.
"I really should get a frequent diner card here because I've been a good 30 times.  I've also been across the street to Osteria Via Stato, and they don't have the Italian small plates thing down as well as Quartino, which does it excellently.  My favorites are: Wine - Est Est Est (dry white wine, close to a sauvignon blanc); Salumeria - Gorgonzola Dolce and Sopressata; Spreads - white bean garlic; Pizza - Stefano; Fonduta (always yummy); Pasta - Orechiette, Gnocchi; Salad - Spinach; Other - meatballs, polenta fries, lamb shank, scallops.  Enjoy!"
"OMG this place is frickin' awesome!  Best pasta I've had in Chicago, and there are plenty of good places around.  I have spent quite a bit of time in Italy and am super-fussy about my Italian food, but I have been to this place 3 x's now and can definitively declare this place Italy-worthy.  I've had the homemade ravioli, the pappardelle, the tortellini, and the gnocchi and they were all exquisite.  I love the smallish serving sizes because they are bigger than tapas but small enough to allow you to try different pastas (I never like having to commit to just one!).  True, it can be awkward that they can come at odd times - our main dish came before our appetizer last night.  But really, who cares when everything they put in front of you is so delectable?  I love the Nutella dessert too.  Also, pretty reasonably priced!  If you don't mind crowds and noise, this is THE place to go for Italian in Chicago.  Oh!  And it's open super-late!!  I'm totally in love."
"I have been meaning to come here check it out for quite some time so glad I did few days ago.  I love Italian food, it's my favorite!  You order food to share : ) like tapas style.I didn't know that so I start ordering several different plates, and then asked my waitress if that was enough for me to eat.  She laughed, asked me if I was sharing or not?  ok, I will share my food.I had few beers with my dinner but they also have extensive wine list, some are exclusive to Quartino only.  Maybe you can buy a bottle to take home for special occasion?Caprese salad was very nicely done.  I had someone brought this over for dinner once so I knew how good this was.  Very cold and refreshing taste!Milanese Risotto was very nice, sweet, rice and peas mixed were tasty.  I've read Kelly K 's review about how much she liked Gnocchi so I tried that as well.  This was nice side dish kind of thing: potato dumplings with asparagus?  I saw people order thin crust pizza.  I have to definitely try some pizza next time.  oh just let you know, bathroom's are upstairs, old fashion style, very clean, and bathroom attendants are really nice.   Where I'm from, we don't see many bathroom attendants so I just like to point that out."
"I came here for a meeting and we sat in the bar table area, didn't realize how big the place until I had to use the bathroom. Much bigger than I thought! I will say the service was great, always attentive servers, quick with the food, (I do mean under 10 more like 7 to 5 minutes!), and a good menu and the valet was cheap. However it was freaking loud!! Thank goodness we were in our own little corner because if we weren't I don't know how we could get through the meeting, probably not the best place to have it. Though I was surprised how busy it was on a Wednesday night. If you're looking for a quiet intimate night, probably not the best place to go, but if you're with a small group that can tolerate screaming over everyone, enjoy good, inexpensive, small dishes, enjoy a friendly staff and decent wine selection trot on over."
"Love this place.  Went here for the second time for my b-day and we got the little back wine cellar room and had a BLAST!  We were in the middle of the restaurant, but it was easy to hear everyone.  We loved everything from he meats, cheeses, antipasti, GNOCCHI!!!!!, cheese fondue, FUNGI PIZZA, Ravioli and the PROFITEROLES!   The inexpensive wine carafes were perfect to wash it all down!  We ate like kings and dinner came to less than $40 per person.  It would be less expensive but we all decided to go overboard and ordered a little too much....but well worth it!"
"The service here was great!  We were seated right away and our waiter was very observant.  We were not sure which wine we wanted and he brought us a sample of three different ones to help us decide.  I had the Margherita pizza, which was excellent.  My husband had the crispy calamari, which he said was good, and the braised lamb shank,  which he said was just ok.  I would return here again - I think it would be a great place to visit with a large group of friends."
"I liked this place enough to recommend my friend come here once, but I feel that probably once is enough. I enjoyed my dish, which I will call it the grilled veggie pizza with arugula and I pretty much hated my friend's carbonara dish. Both of us were surprised by the size of these so called ""small dishes"". Typically at tapas, two people have to order five or so items to feel satisfied. Neither of us finished either of our two dishes. I really liked the soup we also got and I would almost consider giving this place four stars if it weren't so LOUD. I left with my ears ringing and a desire to order their pizza out."
"Quartino's is the worst pizza experience I ever had. I like to think that I am a reasonable person. But I left that place starving and angry. I paid $20 for the ""so-called"" Unlimited Pizza and Wine they offer. I went with a large group of people. After waiting in an extremely long line for mushy appetizers and cold bread I asked about the pizza. I could tell other people were irritated and starving as well. They brought out like 4 small pizzas for over 120 people. People practically knocked the waiter over trying to get a meager slice. I managed to get a slice one inch wide. I ate it in two bites. After not being able to get another slice, I left to go find a real dinner. Save your money. Go to Pizzeria Due a block away or Portillos. They have pizza too I discovered."
mehhh for mediocre.
"Great food for the price.  Go in a big group, order up the wine and share lots of little plates tapas style.  As long as you are with good friends, you will have a great time talking and laughing and stuffing yourselves.  It is pretty loud and cramped in there, so be forewarned.  My favorite thing to do is to try picking lots of separate meats and cheeses for the antipasti platter....all have turned out to be delicious...except this last time the sicilian olives didn't go over so well.  The pastas are just so-so but the pizzas are pretty darn good.  And I never feel over-stuffed when leaving this place, but like I just ate the exact perfect amount of food.  And the bill is never what you think it will be--always much less!"
Went there the other nite - it was good.  the food is great and their are so many sexy singles there - yummy!
"Italian small plates - think Italian tapas.  Delicious, and allows for a variety of tastes in one sittingNicely done, good location. Sidewalk dining is a plus when the weather permits"
"When you and your consultant friends want to get together and get drunk off cheap red wine and stuff yourself with a huge selection americanized italian food, Quartino is it. Make sure you don't get too drunk because you'll never find you way to or back from the bathroom, which is located on the second floor. At least there's a couch up there you can nap on if you are so inclined. Probably embarrassing, but at midnight, does anyone really care?"
"Cheap wine...good food, good scene. Ill be regular since I live around the corner now"
"I was pretty impressed with the food here. I was a little skeptical since it was right downtown and in the midst of touristy restaurants. The have smaller plates here so it is like Italian tapas. (That is a great concept!) We tried a bunch of different plates and my favorite was definitely the gnocchi. I think it was served in a basil/olive oil sauce and it was just amazing! Their slogan here ""Where wine is cheaper than water..."" and their wine is pretty good. We just got the regular table red wine and I thought it was decent AND I bought a bottle to bring home for only $5!There were, however, two things that I did not like about this place: 1. It was SO loud. This place is big and it was CROWDED and you could barely talk to the person sitting next to you, let alone the person sitting across from you. I would not recommend going on a first date there. 2. They have a bathroom attendant. I just don't like places that have those. It makes me feel awkward b/c I don't need someone in the bathroom to give me soap and hand me a towel. I can do that myself."
"Great food and plenty of small plates to choose from.  Unique menu, make sure you try the pizza!  Friendly staff and perfect atmosphere for a get together with friends"
"Cheap and delicioius.  I especially recommend the quattro formaggio pizza and the bolognese orchiette.  Delish!  And the romaine salad wtih parmiggian, EVOO and honey is surprisingly tasty.  Great atmosphere as well.  Thumbs up on all counts -- this is a regular for me."
"food was pretty good, the bar didn't really caught my eyes on their mix drinks, service was amazing, the plates were mostly dirty. but overall its a good restaurant"
"Zach,You had us at hello....thanks for the great service and conversation.  Watch out for those flying monkeys.The food was great and the price was wonderful.  Your Manager was awesome as well.  Are you two brothers?"
"Sorry... but I don't get this place. The interior was really well done, but small plates Italian?? Doesn't make sense to me. Everything was too salty and too heavy. The salad (Tri-colore) was just lettuce, olive oil, and lemon. Waaaaay too much lemon. It really could have used a splash of vinegar. The cheese, olive, etc. list they make you check off is kind of silly. Why don't you just tell your server? Also, the pasta is either too heavy or too light. It's like they got confused on what Italian they are doing. Are they Old World Italian, or American Italian. Not very straight forward. Points on the decor and the wine list. Fairly reasonably priced overall."
Great for a group of people.  The atmosphere is loud and crowded so may not be a great choice for a date but the food is wonderful and the service has been good each time I have been.
"I tried Quartino for the first time last night and it was great!  It's Italian tapas, so I was super excited about that since I love Italian food and I love tapas style as well.  We had the 1/4 carafe of pinot grigio which was delicious and so cheap- it was $9 I believe for the entire thing.  Then we had the gnochhi which was delicious, and the funghi pizza which was so tasty!  I can't wait to go back and try the other pizzas, and the desserts.  Actually everything on the menu sounded and looked amazing so I'll have to go back. And the best part- it's so cheap!  Our entire bill was $28!  Unbelievable!"
"I have been to this place twice and the first time I remember having good food, the second time it was just okay. I do like the entire concept of this place, Italian tapas and good cheap wine, however I don't think this will be a place I would go again if it weren't for a reason beyond my control (like a birthday). The service is good and they are pretty quick with the food. We ordered the fondue to start, and shared three dishes, shrimp risotto, spaghetti carbonara and tagliatte alla bolognese. Fondue was good but it seemed like a trio of cheese cause and not actual cheese itself. The pastas and risotto all were pretty bland except for the carbonara. It was tasty but I haven't had a carbonara that wasn't tasty. It's pretty hard to go wrong with bacon, cream and parmasean cheese. The ingredient ts are good quality but overall dish was very lacking in any taste. There are other better options to eat in river north than this but other than the food, it is a fun atmosphere. If you are looking for exceptional Italian food, look at other places outside of downtown."
"For the price and quality, Quartino deserves five stars.  Their food and the atmosphere are crowd pleasers.  We have brought very picky out of towners here and everytime it is a hit.  It is good for families, couples, anyone really."
"Highly recommended for large groups. I came here with just one other person once and we didn't get to try many different things between the 2 of us. However, when I've come with groups larger than 2 I've been very satisfied.  I seem to have the same favorites as everyone else: fungai pizza, fondue, veal meatballs, and the gnocchi."
"I visited my brother in Chicago this past winter and we went to Quartino for a fun Friday night. This restaurant did not disappoint. The service was great, the atmosphere was cool, and the food was excellent. I think we had pizza, but it was really good--thin and slightly crispy. The wine was excellent as well and we all had a good time. It was a little loud in there, but I don't know what else you'd expect on a Friday night!"
"I don't get it. The place is huge and packed. After reading all the great reviews, and my general love of tapas...I put this place as a must see. We had reservations, luckily, because when we got there, there was an hour and a half wait.....Who on earth would wait an hour and a half? Anyway, we were seated, the place was like a train station....really loud. Our server was great and very polite. We had a bottle of wine and started ordering. We had the rissoto with italian sausage which was pretty good and the duck prosciuto, which was good as well. We also had some veal meatballs which weren't anything spectacular. I also made the mistake of ordering the scallops. Now, I know they are expensive, but at $14, they gave 2 of us 3 pieces. Its a sharing place, at least give 4, or cut the order to 2 and reduce the price. That irritated be a little. THey had a TV playing Roman Holiday....I have no clue why, the place was so loud its not like you are going there to watch TV. Dessert was pretty good, but overall, I was not impressed at all."
"This is what Italian is all about.  We were typical loud Italians in a restaurant and had a fantastic time.  The apps were coming, the wine was flowing.  The app sampler was amazing... duck prosciutto to die for!  Octopus was great.  Risotto so good that the chef on Hell's Kitchen wouldn't be able to complain about it.  I can't even remember all we ate, but it is safe to say it was most of the menu.  If you are used to a decent Italian place like Maggiano's, then you will be blown away with the quality and detail of this place.  And, the prices are reasonable for downtown Chicago and you don't have the pretentious service you find in other places.  I went here in a -10 degree windchill and I'm from Florida, so you know its good!"
"I really enjoyed this Italian Tapas place- it had great service even though the waiter was a little ""too friendly"" if ya know what I mean.  But anyway- the food was really good- and the portions were perfect size- they were bigger than your typical tapas place, but they were still perfect for sharing and being full.  And save room for the dessert- it's so good."
"I really liked this place. I had the white bean spread, warm potatoes with tomoatoes and a pasta entree and I though they all tasted very fresh and consistent. It was busy, but we were able to get a table fairly quickly with a last minute reservation.  The wine was ok, service was fine and the bill wasn't hurtful ($60 bucks for two entress, wine and three appetizers).  I would say that it was a pretty good experience overall."
