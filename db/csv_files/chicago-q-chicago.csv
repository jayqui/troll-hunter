Chicago Q
"Everything was great from the server, Wes, to the complimentary chips and pickles, St. Louis ribs, potato salad, coleslaw, salads, and the drinks. Wish we had room for dessert saw the carrot cake and the table next to us it was huge. Some of the best bbq I've ever had if not the very best. Yum!"
"Arrived to a charming building with great decor. Was seated quickly. Staff was excellent. Served BBQ chips and sweet pickles, both very good. My wait person suggested this burger made of beef and pulled pork, topped with pork belly bacon and brisket on a brioche bun. Sounded good and ordered it with a side of Mac and cheese . Burger was a tad dry but tasty, and it was immediately enhanced with a side of spicy BBQ sauce. The Mac and cheese was a little dry, but it came out hot on a skillet.  Ordered an Arnold Palmer to drink but didn't realize I was being charged for each refill. Staff may want to divulge this detail before someone has 4 refills (I'm a big drinker, no judgments). Lol.  The wait person did apologize for not disclosing. All in all, a decent experience.  I wouldn't order the burger again and would likely try the pulled pork and ribs if I come back."
"Chicago Q has one of the largest lunch portions I've ever had! They start you off with pickles and chips (and if you love salt, you'll love the chips!). I ordered the lunch brisket which came with a few slices of brisket, a side of mashed potatoes and a side salad. For someone watching their weight, their salad was a decent serving and the house balsamic tasted pretty light. BUT I'd still suggest ordering it on the side. The brisket was juicy but I'm still a huge fan of Smoque so I was a bit let down on this one. It wasn't bad by any means, but if you want the best brisket, I'd suggest taking the trek up north. The mashed potatoes were a generous serving so there was enough to take home and eat the next day. It's worth a try if you like barbecue."
"Arrived for a dinner reservation on a Wednesday night and got seated immediately even though my friend was running a bit late. As soon as I got seated, the waiters brought the water and the complimentary chips and pickles. The chips are amazing; my friend and I couldn't stop eating them. We ordered the alligator sausage as an appetizer and it was delicious-very juicy and the mashed potatoes and vegetables added a lot of different flavors and textures. My friend and I both ordered the St. Louis ribs. Personally I thought it was a little dry which was a bummer. The sauces also didn't match my taste for some reason. The service was amazing and I really wanted to try some dessert but just didn't have any room left."
Honest review: saw it on check please. i was really skeptical but it was great. I always thought hog wild was the best but this beats it. Free barbecue chips: from my experience of chips there either really old and stale to thin and burned or really bland and greasy. But these were heavenly really crunchy really fresh perfect seasoning not to much of a barbecuey taste( i mean like sometimes the barbecue flavor could be really over whelming) and not greasy! Best chips i ever had sorry lays make sure u eat with the pickles for the perfect bite.Free pickles: i usually dont like pickles because their never fresh or have way to much pickling spice on it so its to sour or to overpowered these were perfect. A lil bit of vinegar and some good sweetness really was delicious i was so surprised. Its not like really sweet like dessert just the right amountBlackened alligator: dont be scared of tasting new things if u like chicken then youll love this but with more of a chicken flavor. It comes with a pancake on the bottom didnt see a point to it lol would have preffered something else maybe grittz. The sauce is really good its a roasted garlic aioli and its not mayonnaise from a jar like a lot of people do this was homemade it was delicous really enhanced the taste of the alligator. It comes with lemon which cuts down the richness of the dish. The alligator itself had a really good flavor to it not to over powered by the blacking spice and not to dry it was really tender a really great dish live a little and try something different Hush puppies: these were really good supper crispy not burned or greasy seasoned perfectly. The inside was a little dry though. It had bacon wish it had a little more though. Didnt notice any cheddar in it?The sauce was to die for it was so good best aioli i ever had so rich u will not want to stop eating these their that good.Corn dog pork belly: i love pork belly so this was a no brainer it was so good if u loved fried food this is for u. Its so crispy not like how street vendor corndogs are i mean like really crispy. The pork belly was cooked nicely the fat was cooked off so it wasnt like all gelatinous( like for example when chicken skin is flabby thats what i mean) really seasoned good. The mustard sauce was so good it really enhances the flavor of the pork. The coleslaw on the side is very vinegary so it cuts through the richness of the dish and makes it taste better the only problem is if u eat the coleslaw by it self it has an off putting pickling spice i couldnt figure out what it was but there was a certain spice that made it a lil funkyBbq flight: kobe brisket i made a vow after my last trip to county barbecue never to eat brisket again because its always bland and dry this was not the case!:) it was a lil dry not like omg i need a laser to cut it but like a lil bit. It was really flavorful really a high quality meet it was really good i wish they added the house seasoning on top of it for extra flavor and an added crunch but it was really good. There was no fat or sinu anywhere thank god!!! Really good flavor to it maybe just smoke it for longer for more of a smokey flavorPulled pork. I love pulled pork but i dont judge good barbecue based on that because it is really hard to fuck up but there have been times where people fucked up. It was really good. The pork was actually pulled not just shredded witch does make a difference in texture. There were parts that were really smokey( means looks black or burned thats just smoke) it had a really good flavor not to dry and no fat or sinu thats the worst in pulled pork when it has a bunch of fat or sinu that makes it so gross again wish they added the house seasoning on top of it for crunch and flavorThe chicken: i didnt really eat a lot of it cause i ordered alot and wanted to taste everything it wasnt dry it had a good smokey flavor to it alot of times chicken is really dry and bland this was notBarbecue sauces: mustard i love mustard i think good barbecue needs mustard homemade though not some crap from the store. Wow was it good a lil sweet and tangy but really was one of the best mustards i ever had.spicy barbecue sauce: i think its just the normal barbecue sauce with chili flakes. I liked the original plain one its sweet witch is really good not to sweet just i like spicy food. This sauce really does enhance the flavor of the meat i put it on everything even took it home in a to go container.Vinegar sauce: this wasnt really vinegary like i wanted it just a lil bit and a lil bit sweet for me this tasted the best on the ribs Completion st luis ribs: omg the ribs are so good. There tender but not fall off the bone tender theres a good meaty chew which is the correct way to cook ribs. It had a saice on top so its either been glazed while it was smoking or on the top it was really good agains sweet but not to sweet. There cut for u! Thank u jesus! Just wish the top was crispyDessert was okCornbread great but dry
I give Q 5 stars for the food and service. Ball the runners were so attentive to us that anything I asked was brought to me.   Our server was in the twilight zone spaced out of his mind he forgot we got there.  At the end he sure remember to bring the check.This is the best in ribs I ever had.  The alligator was my favorite dish from the menu.The chile poblano corn bread was so amazing
"We second meal her in 48 hours!  Daughter v, came to visit us for the weekend.  When she.saw my posted pics from the first meal, she said she wanted try Chicago Q with us. I cancelled reservations with Catch 35 for dinner that, made reservations with q. Then we ran over to catch 35 for lunch.I need to correct the chef's name.. It is Lee Ann Whippen."
"I really enjoy this restaurant and on my recent visit I had the following:BrisketFried Green TomatoesHush PuppiesCorn BreadChocolate Mousse Pie Everything was delicious!  The brisket was meaty and flavorful, the tomatoes were savory, the hush puppies were just the right amount of rich sweetness and the corn bread was great in texture and flavor.  The mousse pie was alright...I just found it to be way too sweet.This is a fantastic spot with incredible atmosphere."
Kind of a mixed bag for me here. First time visit on a Tuesday night and found the place to be fairly busy but still lots of room upstairs. My cabbie hadn't heard of the place nor did the drivers of the other four in my party. Look for the white house on the block with a smallish lowercase q on the wall.They had an impressive selection of local beers to choose from. We all picked our favs along with an appetizer of mac and cheese and fried green tomatoes. The mac and cheese was fabulous and well done. The tomatoes didn't do it for me but then again they are not among my favorites.I went with the brisket as did others in the group. As a side I picked cornbread while others went with fries. My brisket was good but nothing to write home about. They provided four sauces on the table to augment it. I found the spicy sauce to pair the best. The cornbread was a huge chunk and very good. Our server was awesome and cracked jokes with us all night long. Not sure why I'm not raving about q as others are here.
"So many reviews, what can I really add? For what it's worth, my favorite of the three eggs Benedict was the smoked chicken on sweet corn muffin. My eggs were a little overcooked on all three Benedicts, though. My least favorite was probably the pulled pork on fried green tomato - although it was still good. We got reservations as we were showing up at 12 on a Sunday, which you would think is slammed. There were plenty of open tables, though - the house, and thus restaurant, is huge. Wouldn't hurt to get rezzies but probably not needed."
"Chicago Q is amazing!A hidden gem! You would never know that this quaint, adorable white house in the middle of Chicago is actually the best barbecue around!The service was fantastic. The place is a cross between being classy and casual. Our waiter was fantastic and other waiters/busboys always helped clear the table or fill our water cups. Great service when they all work as a team.  When you walk in you get the homey feel. One of the rooms is basically a dining room with just one big table for a part of 10 or so. Very cool!As my meal I ordered the BBQ Flight appetizer  ($15). It came with plenty of food for a dinner meal for myself. It included 3 small portions - pulled chicken, kobe brisket, and pulled pork as well as cornbread on the side but I substituted that for coleslaw.Coleslaw - did not have too much mayonnaise. Definitely my type of coleslaw and it was a huge portion.Kobe Brisket - this was cut in cubes for the appetizer and was very tender, but also very fatty. Pulled Chicken - pretty dry since they bring you the sauces on the side. Once it had some BBQ sauce on it, it was much better.Pulled pork - good not great. Also a little drier because the sauce is on the side and not soaking in the meat.What blew me away was the RIBS. My boyfriend ordered the ribs and shared some with me. They were absolutely amazing. So tender. Didn't fall right off the bone, but perfect came off as you ate it. These weren't even their ""competition-style"" ribs. Those I will HAVE to try next time. So good!If you love BBQ, come to Q!"
"*** D E L I C I O U S ***  I came to Chicago Q for their Kentucky Derby viewing event.  Instead of paying for the buffet and the 5 drinks for the Derby party upstairs, I stayed at the bar downstairs.  LOVE it!!  The service was great!  They were extremely busy due to the event or maybe it's just because it's a beautiful warm Saturday everyone's out.  There were 3 and sometimes more bartenders working constantly behind bar, but it didn't take them long to attend me and their other guests.  They were attentive and efficient.  Thumbs up for that.  I wish I had the appetite for BBQ ribs and their other signature BBQ combination menu items, but I knew the portion would be too big for my appetite so I only ordered two starters, BBQ Shrimp with Grits and Pork Cheek.  They were DELICIOUS and flavorful!!!  The BBQ pickle complimented the pork cheek lusciously.  So did the BBQ shrimp and the grits.  I tried their Hazelnut Old Fashion cocktail requesting extra easy on the syrup, it was not too sweet, slightly bitter, just how I love it.  Smelled really good as well.  The place was vibrant and the interior décor is lovely.  Both the interior and the exterior have unique characteristics.  I would definitely go back again and bring family and friends.  Highly recommend."
"Came here after a very late flight because it was close to the place we were staying at. After being seated, they quickly brought out the pickles and chips. I liked the pickles, they were crunchy and a little sweet. The chips were a little stale though. Started with the pork cheeks which were delicious, but the portion was a lot smaller than expected. This was more of an appetizer for one. Then we had the shrimp brochettes. It was satisfying, but not all that special, so you can skip this and try something else. The interior is very dark and service could have been a little bit more attentive. There wasn't many people in the restaurant but it still took awhile to get water refills."
"A one-star ding because we were served the chocolate cake a la mode for dessert today and took one bite to realize this was cake that was at least two days old (or, maybe, a week).  But to the management's credit, my complaint allowed for that to be taken off the bill...otherwise, this was a mostly solid experience.We came by for a Fathers' Day brunch this morning and tried a few different items--the sweet potato hash and eggs, the sweet potato and carrot cake pancakes, the biscuits and gravy with eggs, and the chips that are served before your meal comes out.  Save for some of the chips also being a bit stale, the main brunch items were excellent.  I also went with the small batch whiskey flight ($18), with three very heavy pours of selections that were by-and-large a winner.  Love the feel of the interior space; tables are tightly packed but not so packed that I felt like we were sitting with our next-door neighbors (but if possible, request a booth).  Service was speedy and responsive, including that moment with the dessert.We dropped about $150 for our four-person party, where all of us had drinks.  Obviously, an expensive brunch so just know what you are getting into upon arrival (as in, if you don't realize that this is basically the Gold Coast, get your BBQ elsewhere!).  Glad to have this in my back pocket when I want quality BBQ with friends who live in this part of town."
":( Heartbroken...I had been wanting to come here for years.  I just kept forgetting about it with all the other restaurants that I wanted to try.  I love hole in the wall BBQ places, because you tend to get the real ""BBQ's"" there.  I had been told by many many people that this place was amazing. Let me tell you something... I drove by this place about 15 times before I called and asked where it was.  This I drove by in about 10 more times till I found parking. No Valet? I couldn't find them. UGH!!!  This is not a well lit place, so if you don't live in the city, then you will probably need to CALL.Okay, I got inside and I was super excited. The decor was nice and it was just a beautiful house.  I think it is an old house?? Not sure.  We were seated.. blah blah blah.  Our waiter was awesome!  That is mainly why there are stars, otherwise, nothing... They brought the pickles and the chips..ugh.  Okay, then I tried a hush puppy.. OMG it was so dry..ugh.  Then I order a pulled pork sandwich.. Now...Can you really go wrong with pulled pork?? Yes, apparently.  The sauces that they provided were horrible!  I was very disappointed in the North Carolina sauce.  I know North Carolina sauce, and it was nothing like that. *SAD FACE*  I was so bummed.  The only thing that was good on the plate was the Cole Slaw... at least I could eat that.  If it wasn't for our waiter and the cole slaw, I would have to give zero stars.  I think my expectations were too high.  :("
"I may be a customer service freak, it makes me feel good spending my money when I get great service. Walking into Chicago Q started out a little shaky. We used our regular Open Table app and made a reservation. The wife and I  walked in and tow young ladies working the hostess stand were very polite until a man walked up and both completely diverted their attention from us to him. I reminded her to finished with our conversation prior to helping the next customer. We were seated and the secondary hostess apologized for her co-host behavior. The rest of the service at the restaurant was outstanding. The pickles and chips were brought out immediately. We ordered the chicken wings as an appetizer, they were smokey and put together very well. The ribs ordered for dinner were smokey and cooked within minutes of being over cooked. The slab was meaty and not a lot of fat. Just a tag bit on the dry side but still tasty overall. I anticipated the coleslaw, and believe it or not KFC still has the best coleslaw. This wasn't chopped us as fine as KFC but had a similar flavor. Seeing that I travel the world for barbeques it's hard to impress me with ribs. The menu has two offering and I suggest you try the competition ribs. The price point is almost double however the waiter explained the process for preparing the ribs is more detailed, the meat is hand picked and cooked slightly different. Traditional ribs are almost half the price than competition but hopefully the competition is better. Yes, they're offering two levels of food, they're not offering you their best and not afraid to tell you. If you want the best product pay additional for it. In summary Chicago Q is a nice yuppie barbeque house, you can get the same quality traditional style  ribs at Smokey Bones. If you want the high end ambiance Chicago Q is your spot."
"So.freakin.good. Fried green tomatoes? Eew, right? Wrong! You must try them! Along with just about everything else on the menu! BBQ chips can be hit or miss, but these were delish. The cornbread was a slice of sweet southern comfort. Also, great service! I really love that. There are so many amazing restaurants in Chicago, but make sure this is at the top of your list!"
"This is hands down my current favorite restaurant in Chicago. We loved the shrimp and grits, the cornbread side, and the peanut butter pie dessert especially. Cannot go wrong with anything on the menu! Our server, Wes, was fantastic!"
"Q was delicious! A great spot for BBQ. They start you off with complimentary bbq chips, which I proceeded to eat 3 bowls of. Very addicting. I had their St Louis style ribs, and could not get enough of them. I ate them with a fork because the meat literally fell off the bone.  I also ate the Mac and cheese, not my favorite but still hard to go wrong. I'd like to go back and try a few other options....BBQ chips 4.5 stars Ribs 5 starsMac and cheese 3.5 stars"
"If it's edible, pour barbecue and commence consumption. Quality, service, and character. Don't forget the incredibleTaste. 2 thumbs up."
After a few visits...I realized that I was never quite as impressed as I was since my first visit. Sad. I still think this place is decent but the meat is a hit or miss...sometimes it's dry. And the staff can be pretty forgetful as well.
"Stopped into Chicago Q after walking around Wells Street Art Festival and it satisfied my craving for barbecue. We sat out in the patio despite the scorching sun because heck, it's summer and we have to make the most out of patio season. I've only been here once, but I think I can confidently say that this is now one of my favorite BBQ places in Chicago. The complimentary barbecue chips and pickles? Thank you! Although the chips did seem a bit stale, that didn't stop me from eating them. Of course I got the pulled pork sandwich, and it was served with 4 BBQ sauces. I tend to always reach for the spicy one because I think it enhances the flavor the most if that makes any sense- but they were all equally tasty. I also got watermelon feta salad on the side, and even if it probably made me full faster, it was nice having something sweet and fresh with the meal. Add to this the unique building, the location (I couldn't help but constantly look around), really good service, and OK prices, I'll come back when I'm back in the area!"
"The best fucking rib EVER! And our waiter Seth he is the sweetest, coolest and awesomest! Oh and Eric is a sweetheart!Very professional very friendly service"
"I love BBQ, and Chicago Q has won a spot in my heart for having some great BBQ choices. Their are many choices for appetizers, we stuck with the fried green tomatoes, delicious! Then for our entrée we had a half smoked chicken and the Kobe sliced brisket. I am a Jewish gal and brisket I take seriously since my grandmother and mother always made brisket and there were never any leftovers. Their brisket though is so juicy and sinks into your pallet that. They smoke it the right way that gives it the great flavor you taste. The chicken was great as well but the Brisket really left a mark on me to come back to this place. The service is wonderful and the venue on the inside gave the feel of a relaxed country home, which made it a great environment to eat with our family. Highly recommend this place!"
"Let me first start out with a confession. I am a BBQ junkie and most likely a BBQ snob. They say admission is the first step to recovery so there you have it! Lee Ann Whippen, partner and chef at Chicago Q, is a frequent contestant in competition BBQ events and also appears often on TV in competitions as well.  That was one of my guiding lights to try their BBQ. The restaurant is just beautiful.It is located in the trendy Division / Clark neighborhood and is in a quint old home that is restored beautifully. It's only a block or two from the Red Line station. The interior is definitely  high end stuff with a lot of modern traits that really do not in anyway scream BBQ here but really very nice just the same. Our table was ready on arrival and the service was excellent So what you ask is with only three stars? Unfortunately ...it was the BBQ.  We began with brisket meatballs that were VERY good. Interesting twist on a BBQ classic protein. So...I am here to rate the BBQ and ribs are a must.  They offer two types and styles. St Louis and baby backs can be prepared ""standard"" and ""competition"" style. I went for the ST Louis competition and my wife chose the regular ST Louis. style. Four side sauces are served (appreciate it when they side serve...i had hope of really good Q then ) and the varieties worked from vinegar based, a mustard style, spicy and a more traditional type. Ribs are served sliced (thank you) so ease of eating without public ridicule was possible. But... My ribs were not ""great"" as a matter of fact many backyard BBQ afternoons feature better. Ribs lacked flavor and REALLY suffered from a lack of smoke flavor.. I looked for the red badge of BBQ, the smoke ring, and very faintly, if i looked close enough  it might have been there..ehhh maybe not. So undaunted my wife and i swapped ribs. One supposed regular and one competition. Neither of us (and my BBQ pallet is pretty refined) could tell the difference. We paid 2.50 extra to sub the Mac N' Cheese side dish but it was dry and pretty flavorless. . I was heartbroken. After sitting awhile nursing a glass of wine, lamenting my restaurant choice, I looked around the dining room to see who was there. It was busy. Then I realized what went wrong. This was not a BBQ crowd, it was a dine out crowd. I'll l assume they ""gentrify"" the BBQ to appeal to the masses rather BBQ aficionados. I get that. Most of us won't dress up and pay a premium for well served BBQ so they have to hold down the real flavors to appeal to their clientele. Well ,.... That is what i surmised at least.  i certainly hope it wasn't just bad BBQ  ...please Lee Ann  ...tell me it ain't so!"
"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Chicago! Make sure to make a reservation in advance if you want to come here. It's very simple to make a reservation and earn points on Open Table. Once you're seated, you are served a bowl of homemade pickles and bbq chips. The bbq chips are super addicting. You MUST order the signature carrot cake pancakes and the smoked chicken eggs benedict. The signature carrot cake pancake melts in your mouth. Not only is it super light and fluffy, it's absolutely delicious. The best part of the smoked chicken eggs benedict is that it's served on a piece of homemade cornbread. The Mimosa Special is a great deal for a group of people. It serves up to 6 guests for only $25. however, the bloody mary bar sounds wonderful too. One of the best things about this restaurant is that you get to try all of their bbq sauces with any bbq order. If you're really in love with a particular sauce, you can buy a bottle on your way out. TIP: Don't get the brisket! It's dry and bland. This is NOT the best bbq place in Chicago. Stick with my suggestions above."
"Went there around 2:30 pm, so it's quite empty there. The waiters are attentive except that they forgot to place our order so we waited a long time....Food tastes yummy. The pulled pork is soft while the ribs are solid but easy to chew. Moreover, the complimentary chips and pickles are unique and tasty as well!"
This is a great place to eat some tasty bbq. The meat was all top quality and well prepped. The waiter was great too.
"Chicago Q has become one of my favorite restaurants in the city!I've been here for brunch and dinner several times and have always left a satisfied diner.Brisket and cornbread have always featured in my orders whatever meal I've been there for. The meat is delicious, tender and succulent and pair so fantastically with the barbecue sauces they are served with. The cornbread... ah! You can see and taste real corn kernels! Try not to fill up on the chips and relish served in lieu of bread, because the meal you are about to have requires great attention and your palette will thank you for it. Sweet potato pancakes and the watermelon feta salad a perfect add ons to brunch.They even have a great selection of desserts - espresso brittle ice cream and chocolate cake are my favorites. Their drinks menu caters to all tastes and ages.The staff is great, very polite and attentive! Love this place!"
"Had a chance to check out Chicago q while in town for work and based on Ray Lampe's recommendation (bit.ly/1Rzu6Cw) for First We Feast I was excited. Boy was Lampe wrong. The food was hammered, had zero smoke flavor or flavor of any other kind for that matter. The wagyu ribs had no meat on them at all. The wagyu brisket was grainy, no moisture (how can you screw up a wagyu brisket?!) and I shutter to think what competition the ""competition"" St Louis ribs won. Maybe best ribs served in a college dorm mess hall?"
"This place checks all the boxes. Having recently relocated to Chicago from the South, I was starving for some legit 'que.  I had the q2 which included pulled pork shoulder and a half slab of baby back ribs.  Rib meat was exceptionally tender and tasty. The pulled pork was a perfect balance of inner and outer meat.  You get 4 amazing sauces to sample on your meat. I chose the cole slaw side and was happy with my choice.  The slaw was a huge helping and was just creamy and sweet enough to complement the BBQ. I could have made a meal of the homemade BBQ chips and sweet pickles brought to me when I was seated. Topping it off was highly attentive and friendly servers that made for an awesome dinner experience.  I cannot wait to return and sample more of the menu and, just maybe, leave some room for dessert."
"Rode by on the bikes and it looked cute, so we dropped in for lunch.Great food, great service, friendly and professional wait staff.Also, good wine list.A bit of fine yet casual dining on Dearborn. Stop by, you'll be glad you did."
"This place is known for BBQ. As soon as you see the place you are filled with doubt since it is fancy. Whose ever see a fancy BBQ place? Not I. However, the food was still good. We went for brunch. We enjoyed the hush puppies to start. I guess they were good. I don't really understand a hush puppy. We shared the Benedict flight and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese is superb. Their Benedict flight was good but nothing spectacular. It was three Benedicts: one with smoke chicken, pulled pork and brisket. I will say this, they do a great job smoking their meat. The chicken and brisket was dry though. I can't imagine eating it on it's own. Their pulled pork was good though. Moist and smoky- best pulled pork I've eaten. To start, they bring out homemade chips sprinkled with the dry run they use on their BBQ and homemade sweet pickles."
"This would be a 4.5 star rating if Yelp allowed for such things...Went to Chicago q for Sunday brunch with 3 friends at noon. You would think it'd be crazy busy but there were empty tables all over the place! You can make a reservation for brunch, which is quite rare in the city, if that makes you feel more comfortable. The building itself is really cool and quite different from most Chicago restaurants, very spacious. Our server was very nice, checked in on us several times throughout our meal and the busboys were on point with water refills and clearing dishes.I ordered the benedict flight which was really good! Great way to try all 3 benedicts and get some brisket, pork and chicken. I liked the chicken and pork ones the best. I also tried my friends carrot cake pancakes which were quite good as well. The glaze they put on them in particular is delicious. They also bring you chips and pickles right when you get seated which is a nice touch!The only thing holding me back from a full 5 star rating is price. Compared to a lot of brunch places it's pretty expensive, which is somewhat understandable given the dishes that come with pork, brisket, etc... You do get a lot of food with the benedicts, which is nice. Since this place is in Gold Coast, most of the locals probably don't care about price anyway.Overall, great brunch place! No doubt about it. Would love to come back for dinner some time too!"
I should have been updated this review because I have been several times since my first visit. On my visit yesterday I can for there 4 meals for $4 a piece for there 4 year anniversary. I absolutely loved the lobster tacos! So much flavor and the alligator portion on the taco was decent. I also enjoyed the corn squash fritters. Crispy on the outside and mushy goodness on the inside. I mistakenly ordered the bourbon drink with cookies for dessert and I was disappointed with the dry tasteless cookies. Bourbon shake was on point though. I will be back! :)
"Really enjoyed the pickles and BBQ chips as complementary offerings at the table. Very nice touch. They have a very strong drink menu and a huge whiskey/bourbon list which I can't really comment on because that's not my thing at all. But it seemed quite impressive.The BBQ is where you will find me. I had the pulled pork sandwich. Pork was nice and juicy. Sandwich was a little messy. Not sure I was on board with the pretzel bun for the sandwich though. I would change that. The side of cornbread was really good too and they give you a nice chunk.As with most BBQ places this is a little pricey but I enjoyed it quite a lot and given the urge striking me for BBQ when I find myself on the north side, would definitely think of this place."
Best places I've ever had a folk shoulder barbecue the main chef provided competition ribs on the house for our group and she was fantastic. Hands down the best I've ever tasted in my life.
"I really like the atmosphere and the food is pretty good, but feel like they need to work on their beer and wine list. Their whiskey/scotch/bourbon list is great though. Also, the service was just meh.My favorite part is that they give you pickles and chips when you sit down. That's a really nice touch. :)"
Everything on the menu is delicious. The baby back ribs fall off the bone they're so tender. The sides are delicious. Come with a group so you can try more things! Family style is where its at.
"tl;dr: The 2-star review feels ungenerous, but ""meh, I've experienced better"" truly hits the nail on the head.  The seasoning just wasn't there.Disclaimer: I grew up regularly eating 'que and my boyfriend is from Kansas City.  That might help you frame our expectations for barbecue.I'll start with the food.What they did right: You could definitely tell right away that the base material was quality.  These were the right cuts of meat and cooked to the correct consistency.  We ordered brisket and it came to table fork-tender.  We also ordered pulled pork and it wasn't soggy or swimming in a sea of grease.  But there was a big-ol' piece of delicious fat still attached to some pieces, letting you know that extra flavor was right there.  Also, big pieces of burnt ends in the mac and cheese, should you choose that option.What they did wrong:The seasoning.  On everything.  From the starter bowls of homemade bbq-seasoned potato chips and pickles, respectively, to the watermelon-feta salad and the mac and cheese.  It's as if they didn't want to offend with too much spice so they erred on the side of NOTHING AT ALL.  It was bland, and it made me very sad because I wanted to like this place.They offered 4 different sauces to choose from for the barbecue including: a vinegar-based sauce, a carolina mustard sauce (my favorite), spicy bbq, and sweet bbq.  The sauces were decent.  I ended up mixing the mustard and spicy to end up with a passable flavor experience for my pulled pork.  Now for the service:What they did right: Maybe it was a busy Saturday night, but the manager, attired with blazer over his plaid shirt, poured our water and checked on us during our meal.  One stellar server--not ours--came by and actually interacted with us and helped out even though we hadn't asked her to.  She really sensed our need. What they did wrong: Honestly, our server wasn't too great.  He never checked on us during the meal or interacted much. We felt like we were waiting awhile for him to come out at the key points, i.e. to take orders, clear table, and bring the check.  You get better bbq bang for your buck at a cheaper joint, and the Q will taste better.  This is definitely not worth the hype."
"""They call her Barbie Q,"" the waiter said gesturing over to the lovely Lee Ann Whippen, hustling around the kitchen. Clearly working well because our meals were *delicious*. More on that later, because I want to get back to that waiter. The pun was actually good-- we like puns. What we don't like is poor service. We like ""pour"" service, and sadly, our drinks were not replenished much. Sideways of saying service was not at all attentive. They left money on the table because we would have been down with at least 2 more bottles of wine (there were 4 of us) and dessert.But I don't want to end this review on a sour note because the food is soooo delicious that it actually compensates for the service. This is not a BBQ dripping in sauces. It is a dry rub and juicy cuts. Omg-- I'm drooling just thinking about it. Like Brisket? I lived in Texas for a year and never since had brisket as good-- until Q. The decor is also fabulous-- feels kinda like a cottage in New England you wish you could afford. That's my way of saying it's very nice.We'll definitely be back-- perhaps not on a crazy busy Friday night. :)This would be 5 stars if service weren't an issue."
"I'm not really big on smoked meats. If you'd ask me to compare pulled pork from two different places, I'd probably care more about the sauces. That being said, this is my review of a bbq place....Came here with a group for a birthday and they gave us the front room which was really nice. Nice set up, nice room, A+ there.  I ended up getting the pulled pork sandwich while the gf got the slider trio. My pulled pork was pretty good. I was a little hungover at the time so all I did was pick at the meat and dip it into the sauce. I do like how they give you 4 sauces on the table and let you pick. My go to was the mild, but they also have hot, vinegar, and mustard. After an hour I decided to try and eat the sandwich, and by that time, all the grease fell onto the plate and the bottom fo the bun was drenched. Some people may like that, some may think it's too unhealthy. To each their own.The gf's slider trio had the pulled pork, the brisket, and the chicken. They were all alright. Only bad part was that there was a little piece of foil in the chicken on that she almost ate. Luckily she spit it out, but that's still pretty gross. It was so small that we didn't even bring it up. Accidents happen.For the sides we got cornbread and fries. I didn't really like the honey butter cornbread, but I did like my fries. They give you a really generous amount of them too so that's a plus. For drinks, a bottle of champagne for mimosas is about $25. They don't do bottomless here anymore so be aware of that."
"Food was ok-service was awful.Visited this restaurant last night for a fun ""girl's night out."" Made reservations for 8:30 and were not seated until 9. To make up for our waiting, the hostess said our first round of drinks were on them. Very kind gesture.House made chips were tasty. Hush puppies were ok. A little dry, but the dipping sauce helped with that and was good. We all ordered the pulled pork sandwiches which were awesome!! The meat was tender and the BBQ sauces were yummy. The fries were awesome as well!Now, here comes my bitch fest. Our waitress was no where to be found at the end of out meal. Andrea was her name. I know this because I just looked on my receipt because she screwed up our payments. Anyway, when she finally dropped our check off, she had charged us for our complementary round of drinks. No problem, we told her and 10 min later, she brought back our revised bill. No lie, 20 minutes later, we gave our payments to another waiter because she had yet to come back and take our credit cards/cash. We asked him if he could please put 22 dollars on each card. Andrea comes back, 10 minutes later, stating that she had put 32 dollars on each of our cards. At this point, we all thought we were on MTV Boiling Points....we asked her if she could fix her error and change it to 22. 15 minutes later, she finally brought us the corrected bill. I just checked my account and it's on there for 32 dollars...seeing that fueled my rage filled Yelp review. In total, we were there from 8:15 until 11 p.m.  20 minutes of that time was spent eating. The rest of it was waiting for our bill.NEVER. AGAIN. I'll go to Famous Dave's if I'm in need of pulled pork."
"I have been a frequent patron to Q and each time, I leave happy and full. The food is excellent, the restaurant itself is very nice and the service is great. The kobe brisket is the way to go for meat lovers along with the pulled chicken. The sides are all delicious with the hush puppies and the honey cornbread really standing out. To go along with all of the great menu options, you get complimentary chips and homemade pickles before your meal that are amazing. Definitely give this place a try, you will not be disappointed."
"I grew up in Kansas City and thought Calvin Trillin was right when he declared Arthur Bryant's restaurant to be the best bbq in the country.  It is incredible.But the St. Louis style ribs my son and I had at Chicago Q were the best we have ever eaten and we have eaten ribs across the country.We sat at the bar and the bartender was great.  The restaurant is incredibly well done and very cozy and comfortable.We come to Chicago once a year for a 3-game Cubs series and while they played, well they played like the Cubs and lost all 3, but sitting in Wrigley Field and win or lose, great great fun.But the discovery of Chicago Q on this trip was a real find.  Just the best damned ribs anywhere.  But in Kansas City, Arthur Bryant's restaurant it is."
Best ribs of my lifeHad the st louis competition ribs and the kobe beef brisket - beef brisket a bit dry but the ribs were DIVINEWe also loved the bbq chips and pickles that came free and were continuously resupplied throughout the evening The bbq sauce and mustard are also divine - would buy for my own bbq sauce needs given the chance
"My daughter and son love it here!  Plus, it's a cute place for adults.  It's rare that we can find a restaurant that all of us enjoy."
"The chicken I had this evening was the best chicken I have had in my life. It was so, so tender. I cannot stress enough how great this chicken was.We went to Chicago Q the night before Christmas Eve. My boyfriend ordered the steak, which was a little tough. Portions are appropriate. Not huge. We got the baked beans and coleslaw as sides, followed by two bourbon flights of three. I barely finished mine (I thought flights meant something along the lines of ""bourbon mixed cocktails."" I was wrong). To my surprise, the maitre'd stopped by our table to tell me it's OK to stop if the bourbon is too intense. She'd had the same experience before, and I thought that was a nice thing for her to do, especially since it meant she had taken notice of my situation while walking by to attend to other guests.All in all, great service, comfortable ambiance, good food."
"This place lived up to my expectations, and that's saying something, since they were rather high. The pulled pork was delicious and went well with all four sauces they served us. I definitely recommend this restaurant."
"So me and my friends decided to try Chicago Q since had so many reviews here on yelp. Place look very nice it was packed so right away you know that food will be good. We went for the Chicago restaurant week deal so we had appetizer, entree and desert for only $33.00 which was a very good deal. Service was outstanding and portion for the main entree was huge but to be honest we were not impressed with the food. I have been in other not that fancy BBQ restaurant in the city like Smoque and food taste way better. In overall it was just ok for me the taste of the food but like I mentioned portion and service was super"
"This place is divine. You know you loved it when you realize you never did a review of your experience when it happened two years ago.  My husband had the BBQ flight and I thought he went to heaven when he was done. As a vegetarian, I had the Smoked Corn & Black Bean Salad  and I still dream about it. The cornbread is out of this world - all of them.  I LOVE THIS PLACE and wish they had one in Miami."
"I lived a block away from this fantastic BBQ Restaurant for three years and I miss it.  I grew up in Tennessee but have lived in Chicago for ten years.  I am no stranger to good (or bad) BBQ.  I have never had a bad meal at Chicago Q, they have always impressed me. This was my default place to go belly up to the bar for a solid meal if I wanted to be casual and just get out of the house.  The service is always top notch and the atmosphere has a relaxing southern charm to it.  Anything on the menu will be wonderful, but I highly recommend finding a reason to order the Bacon Cheddar Hushpuppies and Smoked Wings as an appetizer.  I cannot say enough good things about Chicago Q."
"Such a great look from the outside to the inside ! Since it was a nice day we decided to eat outside . Loved everything we had , brisket were awesome, service was great! Looking forward to have a chance to come back soon."
"The pulled slider, wedge salad, and fried green tomatoes were amazing. They give you tasty pickles and chips to begin. The dessert was awesome and enormous. You must get the chocolate cake and espresso Carmel ice cream for dessert. I cannot wait to return. This place is perfect for the neighborhood, the area needs more places like this."
"Let's start by saying I was going to initially give the restaurant a 3 star but the last thing I saw prior to walking out of there did it for me.Let's start by the seating arrangement, our table was so close next to the table next to us that honestly I had to struggle to get in and out and almost fell on the neighboring table!!The appetizer we ordered was the dry rubbed chicken wings, which came out in less than 2 mins. Needless to say they were cold.  We told the waiter who took them away and apologized!! Not a good start.The main course was ok, yes just ok. I ordered the brisket platter and my friend ordered the pulled chicken sandwich. Nothing to write about. The entire time it seemed that they were in a rush to turn around tables. One of the hostesses (dressed in black) came around and was looking to see how long we and the table next to us had till we leave and was writing that on a paper. Our own waiter seemed always in a rush, he actually threw the check on the table instead of placing it and asking if there is anything else he can help with.All that wasn't the it - the it or the last straw was this other waitress walking to get a wine glass, realizing that there is a stain or something on it, and rubbing that with her finger to clean it out, then placing the whole thing in a tray to serve to this other table!!! Seriously!!! Use your hands to clean!! Long story short, I won't be back and no I do not recommend this place at all."
"So Chicago q is good.  Good but not great.  Let's start with the things done right.    The housemade chips and pickles that come complimentary are divine.  Go easy or you'll find yourself full.Full bar with an amazing selection.  I'm a bourbon guy myself, so I was impressed and the waitresses and bartender know their stuff.So there was a large group. We all ordered our own plates and then split some sides.i had the pulled pork sandwich with cornbread.  You can get the cornbread sweet (with some sort of honey butter) or you can get it savory (poblano cheddar I think).  The cornbread was just ok.  It was a huge portion that resembled a piece of cake, however it was quite dry.  I suppose some folks like their cornbread dry and crumbly, I do not.  The sandwich was solid, it came on a pretzel bun.  Can we pause here for a moment and acknowledge that maybe the pretzel bun is being overdone and doesn't belong on every sandwich?  I digress.  The bun was unimpressive. The pork however was absolutely tender and flavorful.  The bbq sauces (4 to choose from) were also very good.  This would have been better as just the pork minus the bun.The sides:  mac-n-cheese:  Nothing wrong, but nothing amazingbeans:  Pretty goodbrussel sprouts:  I don't like brussel sprouts, but if i did, I'd imagine that these weren't bad.potato salad:  don't just right.  Wasn't that nasty thing your secretary brings to the office party dripping with mayo.Dessert:  I didn't have any (kill me, i'm on a diet), but everyone else raved about the chocolate mousse, pecan pie and the bourbon milkshake.  I'm torn on how to review this one, but for the price (I didn't have to pay fortunately) I would expect to be blown away.  Instead I was just satisfied.  It's BBQ, how much can you really charge?"
"Thought this would be pretty good and it exceeded my expectations. Classy atmosphere, great service, awesome food. This is a upscale twist on your favorite notes on barbecue."
"You don't come here because it has some awesome bbq. You come here to except a trendier restaurant that serves BBQ (not a shack or bistro with a smoker) . It's an ""in between"" place that makes me wonder if I should eat with my hands....but I still do anyway. It's a place to go to grab a beer and BBQ in Gold Coast style. Service has always been hospitable. Very knowledgeable staff. They give you real hot towels to freshen you hands later.I've been here at least 3 times. My favorite is the chopped brisket sandwich. The complimentary pickled cucumbers and chips are always welcomed. For someone who doesn't like coleslaw, I actually like their big portion of lightly dressed coleslaw (no mayo but little tang and mustard).   They provide a variety of bbq sauces...can't remember if anything stood out. I prefer the sauces in other BBQ joints like Smoke Daddy more."
"Went there Saturday for brunch and I truly enjoyed it. Simply loved the bloody mary bar! And the pickles and chips were great. I had the shrimp and grits,  elote corn, and cornbread.  I was satisfied. Looking forward to going back again"
"I loved this restaurant! Sat on the patio on a warm summer day and felt really relaxed and comfortable. The complimentary chips and pickles were tasty, my bourbon peach tea was delicious, and I really enjoyed the Q burger. Good service too. Would definitely come back again!"
"Solid food, upscale setting. You go here for the drinks, the atmosphere and the food is quite nice too. Get any of the whiskey cocktails if your'e ordering pork (pulled or ribs) and you'll be happy. Service is solid, sometimes can be a little awkward if you're waiting for a member of your party to arrive and are ready for a drink but good overall. Wooden floors and simple decor make for great people watching in a lively environment."
"Had a great dinner with family last weekend. Clean, not too loud inside. Instead of bread brought to the table, you get seasoned potato chips and bread&butter pickles. Be sure to enjoy those layered on top of each other, but don't eat too many! You'll want to save room for what's to come.I ordered the pulled pork platter. It was great quality. Comes with a side, and I ordered the watermelon feta salad. This was the perfect pairing to balance out the heavy meat platter. It's true the ribs are fantastic! Be sure to get the competition style if you are getting a full rack. They bring out all their sauces to the table, so you can try them all.We ordered the poblano cornbread, vegetable skewers and mac&cheese as sides for the table. Only disappointment is that these sides are $6/$8 but are only big enough to share between two people at most."
"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! My experience became no experience!  In hopes of trying a new bbq restuarant my family and I (husband and toddler son) called Chicago Q to find out if they accept walk-ins and how long the wait would be.  We were told yes and there was currently no wait. We headed right over since we were in the area and when we check in we were told there was a 45 minute wait!! REALLY?  Why lie? Such a waste of my time!  And to make matters worse,  an apology was not offered.  If this is how they treat their customers,  there's no need for me to become one. First and last time....your lost!"
Great Food! Love the atmosphere. Southern charm. Fried green tomatoes are lightly breaded thick cut pieces. The vegetarian option was very filling and flavorful. The service was superb!
"Went here for a work lunch, A+ from appetizers to sides to main courses everything was delicious! 3q is great way to try a lot of menu without feeling too stuffed, especially if you split with another person. Favorite dish had to be the alligator though. So so delicious.This place was great for groups, date, nice dinner etc. I highly recommend!"
"After a hit and miss meal a year an a half ago, we decided to give Chicago Q another go... and did Easter brunch with them.AGAIN Inconsistent Food Quality. Case in point:   - There were two Brisket Eggs Benedict ordered. The brisket was great but each      order had a perfect poached egg and one that was solid, to the extent we could     take it off the plate by sticking the fork thru the yolk and lifting it without spilling     a drop.  - We'd ordered a side of Carrot Cake Pancakes. They came topped with bacon.      Unfortunately, the bacon was so greasy that a pool of - about the circumference      of a tennis ball - collected on the plate. Perhaps, the reason they were served     without butter was because they they felt there was enough fat on the plate.      As for the pancakes themselves... bathed in bacon grease, thin, dense and of littleflavor; the three of us left almost 3/4 of it on the plate.The server couldn't answer a couple of our questions, but did say she was a trainee and went and got answers from the kitchen. Appreciate the honesty.The ambiance is very pleasant... light, clean and comfortable. Even the outdoor patio looked inviting. They even had someone dressed as a bunny to engage the kids... a nice touch.I'm the first to acknowledge the roles of ambiance and service as being central to a dining experience... but if the food quality isn't consistent, it doesn't warrant rolling the dice.I'd really hoped to be able to boast about our meals this time thru... but I can't."
"I've been to Chicago Q for lunch a few times and for brunch once, and overall consider it to be a solid option for either. The chips and pickles to start are delicious! I could easily spoil my appetite overindulging in the chips (and have on occasion) and even though I'm not typically a fan of bread and butter pickles, I always find myself snacking on these until my food comes.The hush puppies are DELICIOUS. They're fluffy with great flavor, and I love the sauce they come with. The barbecue I've had has been good - very tender and the sauces they give are good as well. The brunch was a bit less stellar than the lunch - I ordered the kobe brisket benedict and while the eggs and biscuits were delicious, the meat was a little chewy and a bit too done. Maybe some of the sweeter options would be better.I think this is a neat place for food and drink, but it definitely is on the pricey side for barbecue. I find it hard to shell out that much for hush puppies and pork on a regular basis, especially now that there are so many good barbecue places in the city."
"I call Chicago Q the boojie bbq spot! It's upscale bbq goodness! Brought my parents here for a special little treat when they were visiting. My daddy knows himself some good bbq! We all loved everything! From the chicken, to the ribs, to the pulled pork, to the mac and cheese and sweet tea.  Yum! The pickles are so amazing, we could not stop eating them! Our reservation was a bit later in the evening and they were closer to closing time, so there were less patrons than I expected. I felt a tad rushed toward the end, but overall, service was great."
"Wow. Maybe the best lunch I've had in the city. They bombard you with so many things, and they are all wonderful.The ambiance is a neat ""old-money"" Southern feel which is different from your typical BBQ joint. I had the sliced brisket for lunch. Things started off with some amazing BBQ sweet potato chips and a giant bowl of sweet pickles (free). Then a house salad (nothing special). Then came the entree: perfectly cooked sliced brisket and four great sauces to choose from (very good). As my side, I had the baked beans, which were meaty, delicious and served in a cool tiny cast iron skillet. They were perhaps the best baked beans I've ever had. The lunch was enough for two people and cost about $13. With all of the other things they throw in, I don't understand how this place turns a profit on the lunch menu. My table for one was almost completely full of dishes in the end.Is this the best BBQ in town? Hard to say in a competitive market like Chicago. But was the dining experience altogether five stars? You bet."
"Well, I loved it.  I mean, the cornbread is as big as your head!  It's incredible....honestly.  I am not easy to get 5 stars out of, but I couldn't knock off a star for ANYTHING.  It was the perfect experience and I have already made plans to return with my hubby for our anniversary trip in February -- reservation is made!I went with four fabulous mamas on a girls shopping weekend and we had some incredible food.BBQ chips and pickles {eat them together or be damned} were our table starter.  We indulged in the mac/cheese, brussel sprouts and veggies as sides and I had the St. Louis half rack of ribs.  The sauces were IN-F-ING-CREDIBLE.And, let's talk about service.  Um....amazing.  Our server was knowledgeable, patient and accommodating in every way. She really took our experience to the next level.  Food fired up hot and ready with not too much wait time. Water glasses were always full and refills on alcohol came quickly and easily.  The atmosphere is awesome, with stained wood, humble decor, great lighting and seasonal add-ons.  I would love to see this place at the holidays.  I bet they really go all out on the banister!Truly a must try spot in Chicago.  The meal was also one of the most affordable I've ever had and seriously the best.  Thank you so much for the amazing meal!"
"Chicago q was a lovely surprise - everything from the lovely garden to how massive the restaurant is behind the cute old facade - all the way down to the food. Their equivalent of other restaurants' bread is two bowls of pickle slices and chips, both decently tasty.Food: Slider Trio (pork, kobe, chicken) and Pulled Chicken Sandwich with friesThe chicken was unbelievably tender and flavourful - even without any sauce. Speaking of which, the sauces come in a set of four: a traditional BBQ, traditional with pepper flake, and two Carolinas (a regular and mustard sauce). The mustard was probably my favourite, followed by the pepper-flake original, which I would have loved more had it actually been spicy. The fries were also great. I'm not a big fry person, but they made my tastebuds happy.Drinks: Mojito and local beer - both okayService was efficient and friendly. Would come back to go into a pulled chicken food coma. That would be just fine by me!"
"I've read reviews and went to Chicago Q expecting an amazing experience and for my taste buds to do a little dance... Not so much. The chips and butter pickles they put out are decent; the sauces are amazing- 5 stars for them; service was unbelievable- 5 stars to that also! However, the food... Not entirely impressed. The brisket was good, but the pork and chicken were just an ordinary pulled pork and chicken. I'm going to give this place another shot since the brisket was pretty good, maybe I'll try the eggs Benedict (over brisket) next time and go for the whole brunch thing. All in all, it was just so-so food-wise."
"Birthday dinner for fellow yelper Mike S, accompanied with Andrew T and Sue T and non-yelper boyfriend. All in all this place was good. Not great, but good. Of all the food we sampled the ribs were the best, in my opinion. We all ordered the baby back ribs. I thought the meat had good flavor, some smoke although not a ton, but still good flavor. They were pretty meaty too and seemed to be cooked just about right. The dry rub on it was good, but like Mike S said, it was kinda powder-y, in that you could feel every granule of rub on your tongue. This was less than ideal and something I've never experienced before. I would say this was the one downfall of the ribs. Other than that they were pretty good, a solid 3 stars and worth a visit for. 4 sauces were served with the ribs. Mild and spicy are the same except one has pepper flakes in it. These were typical, overly sweet sauces with a spice I can't quite put my finger on. Allspice, clove? I don't know but whatever it is, there's too much of it in the sauce and it lingered on the tongue. Pass on both of these. Their nod toward Carolina vinegar is good, but not as good as authentic. Their mustard vinegar is surprisingly good and the table favorite. Big fan of it. The rest of the food was appetizers and sides and unfortunately most of these were kind of lack luster. Not bad but kinda forgettable. For appetizers we ordered the bacon cheddar hush puppies (that Yelp speaks of so highly), grilled oysters and shrimp and grits. I guess I forgot that hush puppies are mostly fried dough and not actually balls of cheese and bacon. There was no actual bacon or cheddar flavor to speak of. Others complained they were a bit dry, I didn't think mine was dry but there was nothing special about them at all. Don't let their awesome name fool you, these are no better than Long John Silvers', as my boyfriend pretty accurately assessed. The grilled oysters were also OK. They were covered in a lot of fat and butter and maybe cheese so it was mostly slop on top of an oyster. It was fairly tasty despite this but the oyster is really masked by the fat. The shrimp and grits were the best of the appetizers, the shrimp were seasoned with their dry rub. The shrimp were good and flavorful and the grits well seasoned, didn't need salt. Certainly not the best shrimp and grits around but good, solid appetizer worth ordering. For sides the table shared Kobe brisket baked beans, classic potato salad and bruleed macaroni and cheese. I liked all three of the sides more than the others I think. I thought the potato salad was good because it wasn't excessively dressed in mayo and had a lot of dill. Maybe could have used just a hint more salt but not much. Sue T totally disagreed, hated the dill and thought it needed tons of salt. I personally liked it just the way it was. Others complained there was nothing ""bruleed"" about the macaroni and cheese, other than that I thought it was still pretty good. It was creamy and tasty, maybe the slightest bit more of salt needed again but it was not under salted. I have had a lot of bad and really under-seasoned macaroni and cheese as sides at restaurants and bbq joints and pretty much don't order it anymore because it's usually just not good but I thought this was better than average. It won't make you go WOW but it's better than most because it wasn't dry and it was actually salted. The Kobe brisket baked beans were a bit of a disappointment because again Yelp talked them up and they were kinda just OK. I will say, however, for baked beans, they were better than average because they were not just sickly sweet brown sugar slop. They were still a bit sweet but not excessively so and there was actual meat flavor plus chunks of meats in it. Lastly we ordered dessert, totally unnecessary and probably not really worth it, but it was a birthday dinner. Dutch apple pie with bourbon gelato - the gelato was good, quite a strong flavor. The pie it self was OK. The crust was tough, the seasoned apple was pretty typical of what you'd expect. Carrot cake, I did not sample, was received as just OK. Chocolate mousse seemed OK, I'll let Mike S review it as I didn't really hear his opinion, although he ate it all except for the crust. Yelp is definitely over-rating this place. I would not say anything is bad here, I found something to enjoy in all the food but most of the sides and apps unfortunately left us going, thats it? Not bad but not noteworthy. The ribs are good, not the best in the Chicago area but good flavor without sauce and meaty and definitely not dry. This place is also pretty expensive. What they charge for a half slab is what most BBQ joints charge for a full slab. I know this is ""gold coast dining"" but it's really not. Just because the location is near downtown doesn't mean its fine dining. The interior is nice but the food is needlessly expensive."
"We visited the Chicago Q as a birthday party of four but soon realized it was definitely a party of more. We were greeted with a lively, boisterous crowd in a relatively high energy environment for a sit-down dining BBQ experience.The appetizers, dishes of homemade BBQ crisps and pickled pickles, really whet the appetite. Coupled with a 30+ minute for our food made us anxious and hungry for the main courses.I stared blankly at the massive slab of St. Louis ribs buried in a heap of French fries, wondering just how on earth I would get to the last bone. The meat was tender and slipped right off the bone and into one of 4 different sauces. While the meat texture was excellent, the dry rub seasoning was missing more punch than Manny Pacquiao did vs. Mayweather (what a shame). I resorted to the sauces for most of the flavoring, but still realized I was licking my fingers after every rib. All in all, the environment and food were great and will definitely visit again sometime soon!"
"Definitely the nicest BBQ place I've ever been to... It's not often you find yourself devouring ribs using your fingers in a place with white linens. I started with the Mint Julep, I've never had one before so I can't compare it to anything, but they essentially make this drink a snow cone which is pretty fun. The taste was pretty good but I think it could have been better.We sprung for the competition ribs which were very good. Our friends got the regular ribs and they also really enjoyed their meal. We should have done a side-by-side comparison. All of the sides were delicious: baked beans, mac & cheese, and corn bread. My husband and I split the ribs between the two of us and the sides listed above between 3 people and we had more than enough food.Service was just a little bit slow, but they were packed so it was somewhat understandable.Everyone in our party really seemed to enjoy their food and drinks! I would recommend this place to others, just keep in mind that it's a little bit pricey.**As a side note, my husband had gone here for lunch a couple days prior. Being from KC, he's a pretty strict judge of BBQ. He ordered the pulled chicken and pulled pork and he didn't care for it at all - he said it was really wet meat and not very flavorful. When the server came and asked how it was, he simply said ""It wasn't for me."" The manager came over next and insisted on comping his meal even after my husband declined a few times. From this experience, it was very clear that servers and management put a great emphasis on customer satisfaction which prompted us to come back with 5 of our friends. On our second visit, the one outlined above, the food was very good. Our friend even ordered the pulled pork and my husband said it looked much more appealing and our friend said it tasted very good. Great customer service!**"
"The closest I've coming to finishing a full rack or ribs (get the St. Louis style): I love this place. The chicken (both pulled and regular) was also  fantastic. The spicy/sweet BBQ sauce was was my favorite. I though the greens were a bit bitter for my taste, so I wouldn't order them again but I wouldn't recommend against them. The mac and cheese was incredibly delicious as was the salad dressing. The chocolate chip cookie was the best i've had in year, however the peanut butter bacon one was not very good. I'm giving them 5 stars because the highs were so high they knocked it out of the park for me and the lows were not so low that I felt like I should recommend against. The ambiance was also delightful. I cannot wait to go back."
"We were down in the loop for Memorial Day and decided to find a restaurant to dine at. After finding several closed due to the holiday, we found Q and couldn't have been happier. The food and atmosphere were great. Its comfort bbq food but with an upscale feel. I suggest ordering a few items and sharing, so you can try several items."
"I was invited to join a friend to dine with her at Chicago q.  Not knowing to much about this restaurant, I had accepted.The exterior looks like a small home.  Once inside, the homey atmosphere continues.  The entry area contains a small waiting area and the bar.  The white walls jumped out at me for some reason.  The host staff greeted us and took us to our table promptly.Upon entering the main dining room, again, I couldn't stop noticing the white walls.  The dining room was much larger than I anticipated.  When we were seated at a booth, the dining room was nearly empty - we had a 6pm reservation.  The one page menu was very easy to read.  We were greeted by the server and then proceeded to go over the menu and took our drink order.My dining date had ordered the One Pulled Meat & Half Chicken Platter and I had ordered the One Pulled Meat & Half Ribs.  As we were waiting for our entrees, the dining room was certainly starting to fill up with other diners along with louder conversations.  If you are looking for a quiet place to dine, this is not the restaurant for you.   The server was very attentive to us and to his tables.  We couldn't believe our eyes when the food runner bring our meals.  The platters were very good size.  WOW.  The food was incredible - so much where we had to take leftovers home.  Of course, we had to try some dessert.  We had opted to try the Apple Pie with Ice Cream.  Truthfully, it was not the best dessert I've had.  Maybe if the pie was warmed up it was be better.  I also didn't care for the flavor of Jack Daniels in with my ice cream.  Overall, Chicago q is a great restaurant for great food, service and great times with friends."
"I am torn about this place. I went with a large group for brunch on Sunday and they were very accomodating. But then it took the waitress about 15 minutes to get to our table. When she did, she took like 5 minutes to tell us all about the restaurant owner, which is always nice to know, but then she left, without asking if we wanted to get our drink order in or if we were ready to order (and after 20 minutes, we were). They serve BBQ chips and pickles to all tables which are so great, especially as freebies, but while we were enjoying those, one of the busboys came up and cleared all our plates. When I asked why he was doing that, he said he was going to bring new ones out, but never did...When she finally came back, she got our drinks and food in. But then it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks out. I understand they were busy, but drinks should not take that long. One of my friends ordered the bottomless mimosa deal, but was regretting it once he realized that he was most likely not going to get his money worth.When our food came out, my opinion instantly changed. I tried everyone's dishes and all the eggs benedict dishes were incredible! I got the biscuits and gravy and am so glad I did. By far the best thing on the menu!!Pricing was far and the waitress was good about splitting the check up for us. I think there needs to be some kinks worked out in the service part, but the food is great!"
"Delicious. The portions are huge and they were very helpful with explaining their menu. Our waiter was attentive to us so we never needed to get up and find him. I got the slider trio with a watermelon feta salad. mmmmm so good! Their house made chips were the bomb as well as their pickles! We ordered the macaroni and cheese as an appetizer, it was okay-I've had better but it came on this huge skillet and I came with 4 others and we're all able to share from it! Portions are HUGE! Beautiful decor in the inside. Great spot for brunch! Mimosas were also delicious. YUM"
"I'd walked by this restaurant several times and thought how cute it was, without realizing exactly what it was.  When looking for a dinner spot on Yelp, I realized the review I was reading for Chicago Q was the same place I'd walked by! I shared the BBQ flight as an app, which is a great way to try the different bbq varieties and sauces.  I've also tried the Pulled pork sandwich and the ribs, and neither disappointed me.  I love the outside eating area- perfect for dinners.  The cocktails are great too!"
"Our daughter and son in law took us there for Father's Day. made a reservation. Had to wait a little but that's okay. Expected. They tried to give us the bar instead of a table of a booth which we did not want. Finally sat down and enjoyed the dinner. We ordered two slabs and side orders. It was good. It is a nicer restaurant so do expect to pay more. Of course our daughter and son in law treated us. It was a pleasant experience overall! Oh, Carrot Cake was so good that you had to try it!"
"Some kind of good BBQ in a nice setting. The meats brisket, pulled pork and at. Louis ribs were all outstanding. The cornbread was less than stellar but the coleslaw, with kale and the Mac and cheese made nice sides. Come hungry and leave with a doggy bag!"
"This is without question the best upscale bbq experience I have had in Chicago.  From the homemade bbq chips and pickles to the pecan pie everything about this place is next level.The cocktails here are well made and there is a great beer list. They also offer a bourbon flight, which  was a tasting of three different bourbons. Since I have been going through a big bourbon phase, I was pretty excited about this and it didn't disappoint. I got the bbq platter with the pulled pork shoulder and half a chicken with the poblano cheddar corn bread. My boyfriend got the same platter with the pulled chicken and ribs with the honey butter corn bread.  Everything was amazing. They bring out 4 different kinds of bbq sauce, which were all delicious. Even though I was already pretty full at this point, we finished strong with a piece of pecan pie served with a vanilla bourbon ice cream. It was fantastic. If you like pie (and who doesn't?) you must get this."
"Went here for dinner during Chicago Restaurant Week and loved everything about the experience.  We were warmly greeted and given an overview of the menu and seated in the front dining room where we could watch the Bulls game.  Our server was right at the table with water and gave us all the details of the special CRW menu.  We had prompt service when it came to the drinks and appetizer and as soon as we were finishing up our small plates, the best ribs I've ever eaten hit the table.  We opted for a rack of the St. Louis style ribs and they were so tender they were falling off the bone.  So good I wanted to call my grandpa, who is a rib master, and let him know there was real competition.  I didn't really care for the coleslaw but the honey butter cornbread was DELICIOUS!  The button on my jeans was about to burst and we knew it was time to go...we got the check and cashed out within just a few short minutes and our waiter was so nice.Will definitely go back!"
"I had a combo of Mac and cheese with the watermelon feta salad. Perfect combo. My son said that the ribs were the best he's ever had, and he's been to some amazing BBQ placed. The chocolate cake was sinfully rich and perfect. All of the portions are huge. My daughter and I split the Mac and cheese and we still had 2 servings to go home. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!!"
"We came by to try this BBQ place for lunch and during Restaurant Week 2015.  This means a 3 course lunch for $22 pp here.  Wife had their corn/bean/avocado salad, kobe brisket with cole slaw, and carrot cake.  I had their smoked chicken wings, pulled pork with cornbread, and carrot cake.  We also had their delectable pickle slices and homemade chips which come with every meal.  The pickles weren't tangy at all as might be expected, had some sweet flavoring, and were quite addictive - I  can see why they are so popular and go so well with their BBQ.  Everything we had was excellent - the only knocks might be the kobe brisket was on skimpy side, and they are a bit on the pricey side judging from the regular menu pricing (it's hard to tell if the RW serving portions were normal or not as we've not dined here before).  I even liked their vinegary BBQ sauce (I normally don't), as it was quite light on the vinegar, and it went well with moisturizing the pulled pork (not saying it was dried out).  I particularly liked the more spicy BBQ sauce (the other two sauces were a milder BBQ and a mustard sauce).   Anyway, it's a cozy and quaint dining venue, and it was nice for us that it was quiet for a weekday lunch.  We understand it can get quite loud here on weekend evenings.  I would say come here and try their BBQ particularly if quality is your top priority."
"Not only is the food great, the customer service is spectacular.I've been here a number of times through the years; each time is a better experience.Had brunch today and we ordered the pork belly corn dogs to share.  Nothing like you've ever had before!  The waiter asked how we liked them.  Our only comment was that the inside seemed cold.  He immediately replaced them....and Chris, the manager, came over to apologize.  Not at all necessary, but very gracious.When we paid the check, we made a comment to the waiter about ""The Dead Head group"" (it is the weekend)...smoking dope next to us on the patio.  Again, Chris came over to apologize to us.  Totally not necessary.Great customer service....the food, wine and unique BBQ are well worth making this a regular spot.  It's my neighborhood fav."
"Hands down, best customer service I have ever received in a restaurant, especially a bbq place. The food was delicious and there was constant service to our table, whether it being refilling of water, to delivery of hot hand towels after our messy, delicious pulled pork sandwiches. All around good vibes and great service!"
"Disclaimer: Q is a BBQ Restaurant, not a bbq joint, and we loved it! So many great appetizer choices, in addition to bbq entrees in various formats. Alligator tastes like Mediterranean chicken kabobs (not a bad thing), very glad it wasn't battered and fried as is typical. Phenomenal pork belly appetizer - love how it resembles steak. Kobe brisket was moist, despite not being fatty, definitely a generous portion of meat to drag through 4 sauces (absolutely loved the mustard sauce). Cornbread was too crumbly and couldn't taste the habaneros much. Last but not least - the unlimited bbq chips and sweet pickles - please hold me down, I can't handle it, and yes I will agree to refills when asked. Fantastic."
"This place definitely is one of my top favorite restaurants in Chicago for plenty of reasons. First, THE STAFF. Exceptionally attentive and kind while delightfully fast even the place is packed. The waiters have great communication and are always on top of their game. Second, of course, the food! Sooo, soo tasty! Every ingredient is fresh, even the chips and pickles you get for free as soon as you sit down. Everything on the menu looks delicious, I feel like I have to keep going so I can try everything on it. Lastly, the ambience. From outside the restaurant looks like a quaint and cozy cottage, but when you go in you realize just how big it is. It has the vibes of a ranch but with the elegance and tradition of a fancy restaurant. Fully recommend this top-notch eatery."
"Really tasty fare.  I ordered the traditional ribs, it came with a flight of sauces, bbq chips and a plate of pickles. All were excellent.  The ribs were fall off the bone good."
"Wow, what a tasty meal!The mac and cheese is delicious, super cheesy with crispy bread crumbs on top. Definitely get some!Since you have a choice between corn breads, go with the buttered born bread. A step above the jalapeno version. It practically melts in your mouth.The BBQ pork sandwich was gigantic, so if you're hungry this will definitely fill your stomach. It comes with 4 different BBQ sauces, the mustard sauce was by far my favorite. I think the 'spicy' sauce could use a bit more kick to it.When you sit down you also get crispy chips and bread and butter pickles. These alone are probably enough to fill you up, so careful since the portions are so large!Total for 2 entrees and and a side was about 40 bucks. This was with no drinks :)."
"Brisket baked mac and cheese ! How can a meat and mac n cheese foodie say ""No"" to that.  I came with other members of my once a month brunch club, and this was the dish I had.  The flavor was very good, and the portion was huge.  This was more than I normally spend on mac n cheese at a restaurant, but I had enough for three different meals, so I can't complain about that.  Everyone in my group had nothing but positive things to say about their meals.  This is probably the most classy bbq restaurant I have been to, but I guess I should expect nothing less of a gold coast restaurant.  Our waitress was willing to split the check 8 ways, which is a plus in my book since I know it is an inconvenience."
"I went here with my sister for my birthday -- we shared a side of bruleed mac and cheese, a pulled pork sandwich, and a half order of brisket with bread on the side to make a sandwich. Out of the three options, the mac and cheese won my heart. Five stars! The brisket was okay, a little dry but we were given additional sauces to pour over. The pulled pork was very good as well!My sister let the waiter know it was my birthday, and he seemed a little thrown off--almost as if they don't get many birthdays. At the end of the evening, he came over with a plate of 3 cookies and candles, which was nice, but the cookies were a little dry, and we ended up not even eating them. Overall an okay experience, but maybe not birthday special!"
"Delicious food. The brisket was perfection. The bacon cheddar hush puppies were exquisite. Baby back ribs fell off the bone. The service started out attentive and on point but as the dining room filled up, we were mostly forgotten. The staff is dressed well and there are plenty of them but we were left alone without being offered dessert or coffee and had to flag the server down to ask for the check. Strong start, great food, weak finish."
"My friends and I went to Chicago Q for brunch, and everything was delicious. I chose to make my own Bloody Mary, and it was extremely exciting. I was able to put in celery, bacon, sriracha, olives, asparagus, and much more. They don't mess around when they give you that half a cup of vodka either - amazing!I ordered the southern eggs benedict with pulled pork on fried tomato -- very different, but loved it! My friend ordered the carrot cake pancakes, and if you have a sweet tooth, I highly recommend that!!"
"Bbq for brunch. Say no more. After a night out my friends decided to make a reservation here for 8, although it was originally meant for 7 they easily accommodated us. The interior is really beautiful here; there are tons of blown up wall sized photographs of nature and the whole restaurant is naturally lit.Almost everyone at my table ordered the southern eggs benedict which was recommended by our waitress. My one friend called it an ""aggressive"" looking dish with eggs pulled pork and hollondaise atop a fried green tomato. I shared with some friends the q3 meat dish with pulled pork, st louis style ribs, and brisket. I frickin' love bbq so everything tasted amazing. My favorite was the pulled pork- it was tender and the dry rub was tasty. Sadly the side of cheddar cornbread didn't really do much for me; it tasted like butter with a hint of cheese, but I did like the texture. My friends all realllly enjoyed the mimosas and at $20 a head, they got their fill. It was a pretty busy Sunday morning and the waitress had a hard time keeping up. Q is a great destination for a carnivore's boozy brunch."
It was just ok. Smoked Chicken and Macaroni and Cheese were bland. The cornbread was too sweet and crumbly. Chips and pickles were a nice combination...but food did not represent Chicago Barbecue.
Good food. The alligator bites are amazing. Definitely a must have. Service was a bit slow but it was a busy Saturday night. If you dont have to valet I encourage you not to. Very long lines to not only pick your car up but also to drop it off.
First time here saw owner on BBQ pit master and the food was good. I ordered the alligator appetizer which was excellent. For my meal I ordered double cut pork chop. My waiter grizzly Adams said it is a favorite of the Gm of smith and wollensky boy do I love that place best steaks in Chicago. Back to my food the double cut pork chop 2nd best I have ever had what is first you ask. It comes off Captain Ray gill those are to die for.also got a side of baked Beans they were good but if you want the best ever just call Mom J to make you some. I can't wait to come back and enjoy the moonlight BBQ and my wife.
"I was here last night, I love the entire building including the outside.The food was alright, way over priced to be honest! 22.00 for 9oz of brisket?!? Come on... Brisket was extremely dry and chewy, pork was okay not much flavor I was actually wondering if they even rubbed the meat before its smoked. The wings were excellent perfectly smoked and sauce was incredible. Mac and cheese was delicious and cornbread was so tasty! My friend ordered a rack or ribs and I was tempted to order a slab after I saw his. I'm very particular on bbq and I believe this place was just average. Service was okay, honestly could have been much better considering they are going for more of an upscale bbq restaurant."
"Delicious. I recently came for brunch with a few girlfriends. We split the Eggs Benedict Flight, Carrot Cake Pancakes and Biscuits and Gravy. Yum! The biscuits were amazingly soft and delicious, but the gravy to biscuit ratio was a little off on the gravy side. The pancakes were incredible; they literally tasted like cinnamon buns. And the Benedict flight, YUM. Service was perfect, without being overbearing. The restaurant itself is absolutely adorable and looks like a quaint white house from the outside. Great bourbon list. The only negative of the trip was that when clearing the dishes, someone managed to spill some kind of sauce all over my chair, pants and jacket and I didn't notice it until I went to the bathroom. Luckily I was wearing all black, so it could've been worse, but still. Yikes."
"Went here for dinner for a bachelor party.  We were seated in a group dining room.We got to start off with pickles and chips while we waited for our food.  Had the kobe brisket which was great and the ribs.  I loved the mac n cheese, my only disappointment was that hush puppies wasn't on our menu."
"Recommend Lunch special which ends at 4pm M-F the food was substantial. I was able to share with a dish with my boyfriend which included chicken, ribs,pork  side of pork beans, small salad and corn bread. Skipped dinner after this fest. Not a fan of bbq unless I'm outdoors but my bf loved it. The ribs were tendered and delicious!"
Great BBQ with a high end flare. Southern style with great ambiance. Wait staff friendly and management always on point. My favorite is the pulled chicken and pork.
"I had high hopes because the place was very quaint had amazing natural lighting, but the food just fell a little short.I committed to unlimited mimosas so it really couldn't be a less-than-3-stars experience. A good start with the free apps- pickles and BBQ chips for the table. I had a taste of each and thought it was mediocre, but I appreciated them being generous with the portions. And I really mean generous- my group of 8 hungover friends that skipped out on Taco Burrito King the night before were very, very hungry. Needless to say, before I could get through half of the menu,  I looked up and the pickles and chips had become two empty bowls. The waitress was attentive and refilled these without making any comments (which she totally had the right to) about our impressive vanishing act. When I received my skinny mimosa glass without an accompanying pitcher, I was expecting to be disappointed, but again, the waitresses were quick and my glass was never empty for more than a 5 minutes. 10 mimosas in, I was ready to feast like a queen. My friends and I shared a BBQ platter and the benedict trio. Honestly, it was nothing special. It almost pains me to say this because the place was adorable and the liquids were plenty, but the BBQ was almost.. bad. Now I've had BBQ in Kansas City and in Los Angeles, but I definitely don't qualify as a connoisser, and I've also definitely made some better BBQ in my own kitchen. The meat was generally bland and the ribs were definitely not fall-off-the-bone good. They supplied a variety of different BBQ sauces and my eyes immediately lit up because I love sauces and I love choices- and this was a perfect combination. Unfortunately, after carefully tasting each one, I found them to be odd- each one in their own little way- and I almost.... (can't believe I'm going to say this) .. preferred it without any sauce. But then it was dry, so it was a lose-lose situation. I was left defeated. The benedicts were just soggy biscuits with eggs and the same dry BBQ. I thought a bite of each was pretty good, but it ended up all tasting pretty similiar and looking like a plate of BBQ pieces and yellow yolk and hollandaise running all over some squishy bread. The one thing that I really enjoyed though, was the fried green tomato for one of the benedicts, that was used in the place of the bread. It was the only hint of acidity in this plate that desperately needed it. At this point I wished they left the pickles on the table to cut all the richness. The benedicts came with a side of potatoes, and those were left untouched. The cheddar jalapeno cornbread, which came on the side, was also dry and pretty tasteless. Zero cheddar, zero jalapeno, handful of corn-flavored sand in my mouth.  I mean, are they just naming things whatever they want and quietly watching us to see if it has a placebo effect on us? All in all, the place was cute and the service was great, but the food fell short. I probably won't come again, because there are quite a few other places with a great environment and tasty food.  QT, but Q_QNow that makes 20 Q's in my review. thank-Q, thank-Q very much. (22)"
"First off, you can't go wrong with unlimited BBQ potato chips and sweet pickles.  Second, A FLIGHT OF BBQ?  Sold.  Throw in an order of hush puppies (Thanks, Cassie!), and you're got yourself a satisfied foodie."
"So I'll skip what I feel is the obvious-- the BBQ was phenomenal! I learned later that Lee Ann Whippens-- Pitmaster, chef, partner of Chicago q, is a bit of a celebrity! Look her up. Pricey? Worth it. BBQ pork AND chicken was on point. Brisket was fantastic. Mashed potatoes were perfect. The mac & cheese was good, but compared to the BBQ, I'd only get BBQ the next time I come back. A great surprise I learned was how wonderful the staff are! They're knowledgeable, extremely helpful & gave wonderful tips when I was indecisive. They were so busy (Saturday night, Valentine's Day), but the service we received was still great! Can't wait to come back!"
"The food here is delicious. The experience was really bad.I was so uncomfortable, I couldn't wait to leave.We went for Restaurant Week. As always, delicious pickles and chips are served when you sit down. I like to enjoy them throughout my meal. The busboy  and waiter tried to take my side plate 4 times. Our meal was served, A rack of ribs, Brisket and sides. This takes a while to eat. Half way through, Busboy back again, I had to tell him we are still eating, please. Comes back again.After we are done and chatting, a manager comes by and interrupts our conversation. Then she walks away. Now she is back with a towel to wipe our table and completely interrupts us again. She says ""sorry, I keep interrupting uou.""Our waiter brings dessert, but does not ask if we want coffee. Finally, we are done, and I am surprised they didn't carry us out,Holy turn the tables.Great food, awful dining experience."
"Yummy eats, even for just a fish eater.  The ahi tuna salad was very good.  Great wine and beer selection.  The cornbread was just like my granny's and the mashed potatoes were delicious.  The pickle and chip openers were unexpected, but great.  And the cheesecake - YUM.  All of the meat eaters at my table gave nothing but praise too!"
"Do I believe Chef Whippen can make a mean pulled pork that whoops on Bobby Flay?  - Yes.Do I believe that that transpires into Chicago q in any fashion? - No.I was completely underwhelmed by this place.  Decided to go on a Sunday evening around 5pm and was really surprised that I was able to get reservations about a half hour before without a fuss.  When we got there, I realized why...  the place was dead...  begin the underwhelmed-ness.While the space Chicago q occupies definitely qualifies as unique and inviting for the Chicago area, it looses its appeal when you're forced to admire it twenty minutes while waiting for a server.  The fact we had to wait was even worse given we asked for one THREE times and, once again, the place was dead.When we were finally able to order, we thought we were in good shape.  The complementary chips/pickles brought to our table were a nice touch (all tables get this) and the hush puppies were definitely a good surprise.We tried to order a set of Kobe Beef Ribs, but they apparently weren't carrying them that day (bummer...  especially when we were willing to shell out a small fortune for 3 ribs).  We ended up ordering a couple sampler platters in addition to several sides and a rack of ""competition"" ribs.  I have no idea why the ""competition"" ribs cost more than their standard counterpart, because they definitely don't taste it.  While all the food was OK, we could have easily gotten better at a roadside BBQ shack (for half the price).  A few of the items honestly reminded me of food they'd serve at a high-school cafeteria (dry corn bread, rubbery ""brisket"", etc.).Honestly the hidden rock star of the show was the chocolate mouse pie that they provided us for the lax service.  Crushed pretzel crust, salted caramel drizzle and a surprising well constructed mousse definitely saved the event as a whole from a complete failure.I feel like q has the makings of a great establishment.  Given the positive reviews, I'm inclined to think that we just had a bad experience...  but that bad experience is one that I'd be inclined to never go back."
"Where or where do I start? I'm a huge fan of BBQ, and I'm very picky and judgmental of anyone who says they have great BBQ but can't back it up. Lee Ann and her crew definitely back up their claims of having fantastic BBQ. So where do I begin? At the beginning.Right after being seated they brought out a bowl of house-made Bread and Butter Pickles and house-made Potato Chips. I guess I had better let you know, everything in made in-house. So the Pickles were perfect, just the right amount of sweet and sour, and nice and crunchy. My wife doesn't like pickles, but she did try these. She is still not a fan of pickles, but at least she tried them. The chips are dusted with their BBQ Rub, which is fantastic. Try eating a chip with a pickle on top. Your taste buds will thank you!We moved on to the appetizer plate. Fried Green Tomatoes, BBQ Chicken Wings, and Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies. I have never had FGT before, but these were fantastic! Loved them! The chicken wings were amazing, and the Hush Puppies were moist and crunchy. Superb!I had the Competition Baby Back Ribs for our entree. What a treat. Even though they were overcooked (for the BBQ Judges out there, you know what I mean) the meat was not mushy in the mouth, and the flavor was fantastic! And the best part is that all the BBQ is Dry Rub. Sauces are on the side.My wife had the sliced brisket, and I would give it a perfect score. Just the right amount of pull, tender, juicy, and pleasing to the pallet! We had the Smoked Chipotle Corn and Bruleed Macaroni and Cheese. Both were fantastic!For desert we shared a slice of Chocolate Mousse Pie, which was divine!The service was fantastic, friendly, attentive, and all-around wonderful!  I don't know why I have waited so long to visit Chicago Q, but I will definitely be back."
"My favourite Chicago spot?Great plaid-clad waiters and SUPERB food. Equally quality drinks, and brilliantly knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff, even if some take a minute to warm up. Our waiter described himself (but didn't actually) like a whiskey, subtle, strong spoken, slightly darker, bold, complex and ginger.There's a Bloody Mary buffet bar??!! Bottomless mimosas, too! Come bottomless and they give you mimosas!"
Amazing ribs. The competition ribs are sweeter than the regular ribs. Next time I will get the regular ribs. The slaw is great. Portions are large. Ribs are meaty and juicy. The run is perfect and there is really no need for the sauce that is served on the side. Not a large beer selection.
"This is one of my favorite places in the city. The food is always superb and you don't need to make a reservation too far in advance. And of course. A HUGE plus that you can even make a reservation. (I hate places that only accept walk ins)My husband and I have come here countless times. Mostly for dinner and once for brunch. We also took my parents here when they visited from LA. They loved it, and they are sometimes hard to please with restaurants! The food is always great. I have yet to order anything here that I've disliked. The portions are big.. So you have a midnight snack or lunch covered the next day. And I love the homemade BBQ chips they have on the table for you to snack on. And they will keep replenishing the bowl until you ask them to stop. (Which I never do)Their cocktails are also great. Not too pricey and poured generously.  For brunch they also have great mimosas. $25 for a bottle.. Great for two people!There are private rooms on the 2nd floor if you're having a meeting or private party, the rooms look pretty swanky! Parking can be a pain around here. There is some street parking but not too much. There's a valet or I would just cab it. And there is a red line at Clark and division that's a course blocks away."
"I got the dinner plate because I'm gluten free and I found them small and disappointing. The sandwiches that my friends ordered looked much better, and they were cheaper as well. I ordered the American Kobe Brisket dinner plate. For the price I found the portion was very small. The brisket was mediocre at best, and I'm not picky. It was tough and served at room temperature. The coleslaw was very good though, as were the BBQ sauces. Honestly, what I liked best was the free pickles at the table, which I think says a lot. For how crowded this place was and for the price we all found it very underwhelming. I'd rather go somewhere else for great BBQ and have more leftover in my pocket."
"My friend made a reservation here for brunch and I was really excited to come and try their Bloody Mary bar and different brunch items. The restaurant itself is very large and airy with a Southern downhome feel. Our party of 8 was seated at a large table with very comfy chairs underneath a translucent ceiling that let in a lot of natural light, which made the atmosphere very relaxing. Everyone at our table either ordered the bottomless mimosas or a Bloody Mary, which made boozy brunch a really good time. For the Bloody Mary bar, our waitress brought out cups that were half full of vodka, which made me a little nervous at first because it was A LOT of vodka. However, their Bloody Mary mix cut right through that and I couldn't taste the vodka at all. Their bar had so many toppings, such as bacon, stuffed olives, and salami to name a few. I made the mistake of putting a little too much horseradish and my drink ended up tasting like cocktail sauce, which was okay to me, but my friends kept calling it Satan's drink all throughout brunch. The mimosas were also very good and our waitress kept refilling them when my friends' glasses were half empty, which kind of made it hard for them to keep count though they didn't mind.For starters, q gives you free bread and butter pickles and BBQ chips, which was really great since everyone at our table was starving. Normally, I don't like the sweetness of bread and butter pickles, but these ones were really good and tasted homemade. Not too sweet and still deliciously sour. Their chips were also very good and were coated with a lot of yummy spice. For our main dishes, I split the q3 (pulled pork, brisket, baby back ribs) and benedict flight (1 smoked chicken eggs benedict on honey butter cornbread, 1 American Kobe Brisket Eggs Benedict on a cheddar chive biscuit, and 1 Southern eggs benedict on a fried green tomato) with 2 friends. Maybe it was because I was too full from the pickles, chips, and Bloody Mary, but all of the food tasted very mediocre to me. The 4 sauces that came with the q3 were just okay. The meat also wasn't anything special, especially the baby back ribs, which I normally like to be fall-off-the-bone. All the different eggs benedict all tasted good, but the dish as a whole was too heavy for me. The eggs were all poached perfectly, which was great, but I could only take 1 bite of each since everything was so rich.Overall, q is great because of its atmosphere, free pickles and chips, and boozy brunch options. However, I felt like I had much higher expectations for the food and it didn't quite meet them. I thought it was a great place to try, but will probably not be back for the food."
"Fantastic, toddler-friendly but still upscale-ish for parents place with great food.  We had a great experience dining here with our two year old.  They bring out pickles and BBQ chips right away, along with crayons and a drawing menu for the kid.  The building is beautiful, large, and full of light.  It's quite noisy so no one noticed when he threw a crayon on the floor, etc.The food was awesome.  We ordered the split plate of baby back ribs and pulled chicken.  It came with a huge piece of cornbread.  We also go the mac and cheese (to die for) and the corn (spicier than anticipated).  The service was attentive but laid back and not too snooty.  We will definitely be back, with or without the kiddo."
"I was highly disappointed.  Being from Texas, I know BBQ very well and this was not good BBQ.  I came in for brunch and ordered the Benedict flight which came with pulled pork, brisket and chicken. The meats were dry, bland and they did not have a smoky flavor.  The rest of the food was good which is the reason I gave 2 stars but this place was missing the ""q."""
"We are at Chicago Q around 7:45 on a Saturday night - there was originally a 45 minute wait but then they offered us a table right next to the bar which we accepted. We weren't in the traditional dining room but the atmosphere was still really enjoyable. We had the mint julep and hazelnut old fashioned - both were made really well. We shared some Mac and cheese (delicious!!) and cornbread (average) and I got the veggie kebobs as my main dish. The veggies were great, they had a bourbon glaze and were perfectly smoky. Unfortunately the rice that came with my dish was way overcooked though so that was disappointing. My friend had the St.  Louis ribs and said they were awesome! This place is definitely worth checking out!"
"It's Thanksgiving long weekend and we were craving for some good american bbq but Smoque was closed due to the holidays so we decided to try this place We were able to make reservations through open table on Yelp, and there was no wait time on a Friday night around 8pm The environment was good and they have a bar/lounge area in the front so it's good to grab a drink or small snacks with your friends.The service was ok, the food was ok too, and I would consider the environment to be pretty fancy for bbq ribs. I'm guessing the price is a little bit higher than usual tooWe ordered: 1) full slab of traditional baby ribs - a little bit dry and pretty spicy (2.5/5) 2) full slab of competition st louis ribs - more moist than the traditional baby ribs but we weren't very impressed (3/5) 3) House Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies - the server recommended this appetizer but Im sorry to say that i didn't like it because it was so dry and i didn't taste the bacon (1/5)4) Honey Butter Cornbread - it was sweet and moist (4/5) 5) Coleslaw - (3/5) 6) french fries (3/5) 7) complimentary bbq chips (4/5) 8) complimentary pickles (3/5) 9) American Kobe Sliced Brisket (3/5) I thought it was overpriced for american bbq and the food was just okay, but I might  give this place another try for the brunch menu !"
"Best barbecue I've had in the city!! Meat literally falls off the ribs, (I had the competition St. Louis) & can't wait to go back."
One of my favs.  Delicious food.  Was very disappointed on Mother's Day however.  Very bad service and took over 1 hour to get food.  It won't stop me from going back though.  This was not consistent with my other visits.
"Came out on a company event.Food: it was a catering dinner where they brought out family style. We Had the beef brisket,  the baby back ribs, and then chocolate moose.The prices for the BBQ dishes were ridiculous though. 4/5Service: 5/5 it was very outstanding.  Quick and refill on drinks and they clean the tables after every courseAtmosphere: it was a very good set up location.  They put all of us in a party room.  We had 22 people. However, parking was not great.  Valet parking took way too  long. 4/5"
"4 stars for the ambience and service. 3.5 stars for the food, sadly. We ordered the 3q platter - 2 orders of kobe beef brisket and half slab of st. louis ribs with a side of cheddar cornbread and bruleed mac n cheese. We also ordered the hush puppies as appetizers. The best item: mac n cheese, hands down. The kobe brisket was, of course, good but not spectacular as I would have expected. The ribs, though, were very juicy and fall off the bone...yummm!! I still give it an overall rating of low 3.5 because I'm picky about my bbq, and there's a better bbq place in the chicago area (only great one we've come across so far) - Smoque bbq. Must check it out!"
"Very disappointed in this place. I will say, the service was great, but I was less than impressed with the food. The free chips were dry and flavorless. I ordered the baby back ribs and brisket with cornbread as my side. I feel that I didn't get much for what I paid for ($27). The brisket was cold and I only got two, very thin pieces. There wasn't much meat on the ribs, and what was there was dry. And the cornbread was also very dry. The flight of sauces they provided at the table was not to my liking either. Not to sound too harsh, but I've had better bbq sauce from McDonald's. I will say the other person I was dining with got the mac and cheese and she said she liked it. I didn't try it, so I can't say if I liked it. I wanted to like this place, but I just didn't. The ambiance and service were impressive, but the food was less than lackluster. I left disappointed."
"Q Chicago had the YUMMIEST corn bread I've had in a very long time. It's a honey butter corn bread, served in huge portions. I ordered the bbq flight as a meal with a side of cornbread (I believe it's suggested as an appetizer). I couldn't even finish it! It was very delicious. The pork and chicken were both delicious. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork, and it was such a big serving as well. He couldn't finish it. But as it is a little expensive, it's nice to have leftovers!The feeling of the restaurant was quaint and cozy, not at all like a loud bbq hall. It was upscale while still being homey. Do go try it!"
Everything was amazing!! Sima was an AWESOME server!!  Love the BBQ shrimp and the Effenciado was a great drink. Great experience all around!!
"This place is not worth 4 stars at all. 5 minutes before 6 o'clock, the waitress told me they only take reservations after 6 so I couldn't sit down. After telling her it was only 5:55, she gave me dirty looks, and pointed to a table that I could sit at. We ordered the hush puppies which had no flavor and were completely dry. I then got the pulled pork sandwich which wasn't special either. None of the BBQ sauces are fantastic. We tried the Mac and cheese, which lacked a lot of salt and it seemed as if they used nacho cheese as the cheese sauce. My sister tried the brisket sandwich which was all fatty pieces of meat. Nothing special about this place at all, and it's pretty over priced for it's lack of taste and rude staff. Only good thing was the lemonade, to be honest. Won't be coming here again. Waste of money. There are WAY better BBQ restaurants in the city and way better restaurants close by."
Had the slider trio with corn bread and Mac n cheese. All was delicious (best BBQ I've had in Chicago) and I would definitely order it again. I heard brunch is delicious too so I'll have to come back and try!
"Came here for an impromptu brunch and left satisfied.  The house-made chips were well-seasoned and plentiful, and my American Kobe Brisket Eggs Benedict was perfectly hollendaise-y and served on a crunchy cheddar biscuit.  However, the brisket itself was tough in consistency and overall underwhelming -- disappointing, considering this place is literally named for its BBQ products.  And although the breakfast items were reasonably priced, the regular lunch / BBQ prices seemed a bit steep based on the ""just okay"" quality of my brunch order.  Maybe it's because I've been dazzled so many times over by places like Smoque and Green Street Smoked Meats, but I just wouldn't come back here strictly for the 'Q.  That said, it's a fine brunch spot, and I wouldn't rule it out for a return."
"Went here Friday for girls night to try their restaurant week menu. Unfortunately I didn't have a huge appetite, which I highly recommend if you plan on coming here. You will not leave hungry or empty handed. The food is amazing, delicious, and plentiful! I mean, the portions are massive. When you sit down, you're greeted with homemade chips and sweet pickles to snack on. I highly recommend their Mac n cheese! If I were starving, I would have ate the whole thing. For dinner I ordered the Caesar salad with bacon and parmesan croutons, beef brisket with corn bread & cole slaw, and the carrot cake for dessert. Best carrot cake in the city. HANDS DOWN. I hardly made a dent in my food, but either way, I left completely satisfied.  If you're looking for good bbq, make this your next stop!"
"This place is great!  Both options for ribs are awesome, and their seasonal drinks are perfect.  My favorite was a Simpleton.  Chips and pickles are ok, some people may love them.  Definitely a place to check out or bring some out of town friends to."
"Really confused with this one. Not very busy when we came in - figured everyone else was at Smoke-out. First off, saw some people eating pickles and chips when we came in. Hubby and I didn't see them on the menu, and ordered an app like we always do. After leaving and looking on Yelp, turns out everyone gets them for free. Just not us I guess. So the food - the wings were ok, although a little grainy like they were cooked a little long and then maybe reheated. The rest of the meal was very poor. The brisket was grey, dry and tasteless. There was absolutely no flavor to the meat at all. We left half of that on the plate uneaten. The pulled pork was incredibly dry and tasteless.  Left half of that on the plate too as it was simply unappetizing. I was really looking forward to the ribs. They were fork mushy. I watch BBQ Pitmasters religiously and was very disappointed. Zero smoke flavor and they must have been wrapped and held in foil for hours too long. Maybe all the good stuff was at the festival."
"A pathetic sad excuse for a BBQ establishment. It should be stripped of that title and refer to itself a White Castle spin off...except that would be an insult to White Castle. Whoever rated this place above 2 stars is either is shill or has no concept whatsoever of what actual BBQ food should taste like. I'll dive into some specifics. I had the Q Burger---ordered medium with a side of fries. The burger patty came out extremely well done, charred black and tough as rubber. This was supposed to be topped with pulled pork and ""pork belly"" (read: bacon). The pulled pork was akin to some sort of bagged variety I've happened to pass by at a grocery store---enough said there. The fries were cold and stale. Not just stale from a few hours ago, some of them felt like they've been sitting around for days. This is not an exaggeration, I would say a third of the fries were so hard that you couldn't physically crush the fry between your fingers----me and my dinner companions tried. But in all honesty---I could chalk up the overcooked shoe burger and last week's fries to an off day in the kitchen. This is a BBQ place after all, right? My friend got the brisket sandwich---a colossal failure. The ""brisket"" was a cubed, rubbery, flavorless, tough mess of an excuse for a brisket. Served on a brioche bun straight out of the bag---not warmed up or charred on the grill. Nothing better than paying $16 for something barely classifiable as food on a cold bun out of a bag.  I'm in utter disbelief at this point and have never wanted to walk out on a meal more than at this point. I scarf down some of this food with the same enthusiasm of a Victorian era inmate choking down rotten gruel and ask for the check. Speaking of inmates---here's an idea of how this place can moonlight before it's eventual demise. If any actual BBQ chef from St. Louis, Texas, or South Carolina gets into any legal tangles---why not send them down to this joint for a 7 course platter as their sentence? In my opinion that's a bigger deterrent to crime than a several month stint at the local correctional facility.Couple side notes:--The food runner presented 4 different kinds of barbecue sauce before our ""meals"" arrived. One of the sauces was a regular and another was a spicy sauce. Except the only difference between the two was the spicy had chili flakes mixed into it. Brilliant. --My dinner companion asked for some malt vinegar for his french fries. After multiple attempts by the food runners, servers, water boys, etc. to decipher this bizarre request, they finally obliged. 10 minutes later he was presented with a tall bottle of balsamic vinaigrette. Brilliant."
"DELICIOUS! I wasn't expecting much but it was so good! We had take out so I can't say much for the service other than my interactions on the phone. But even then - they were great! They gave us a lot of the side sauces.Baby back ribs and St. Louis ribs were the bomb diggity (yeah, I'm bringing that back). I'm not a big fan of corn bread but the cheddar poblano and the honey butter cornbread were so good. Good portion sizes and wish I could go back now.Thanks, Chicago q!"
First rate meal competition rib was as good as any served in any BBQ restaurant pork belly very good brisket sausage terrific sides all very tasty! Can't wait till the next trip to Chicago q
"The food here was very good. Even the free pickles and chips were delicious. I had the baby back ribs and my girl friend had the brisket. The ribs fell right off the bone and couldn't have been any better. Brisket was very good as well and came with 4 different types of sauces. The reason I am only giving 3 stars is for the service, it was terribly slow. We're talking 20 minutes to get one drink slow. I recommend this place for the food, just don't have plans to be anywhere after dinner because you will most likely be late."
"Near my apartment there are a number of smaller, over-looked spots that I have been making an effort to try: Eduardo's Enoteca was a winner (still need to write that review), Orso on Wells Street is a nice spot, and Chicago q was next on the list. Usually I write reviews after I've had brunch and dinner, for whatever reason, but I don't know that I'll be back to Chicago q to have dinner. Allow me to explain why.First, the general info. Chicago q is actually a lot bigger than I thought, so I was surprised when I walked in and followed the hostess all the way to the back of a very comfortable, Southern-looking (I guess, never actually been to a real Southern place) restaurant, complete with ranch-dress-decked servers and the smells of a smokehouse. There also is a second floor and outdoor seating, but the warm-up this weekend left town after Saturday, so that wasn't an option.You start your meal with some less-common nibbles: bread-and-butter pickles and bbq-style potato chips. Both are quite tasty, and we had to ask a server to stop bringing them, or we'd have no appetite for our actual entrees. We first tried the Hushpuppies, complete with incorporated bacon bits and cheddar. Quite tasty, but also quite salty; the exterior is dusted with the house dry rub, and while flavorful, it has a bit of salt in it too. The chipotle-mayo dipping sauce also was tasty but also pretty hot (though I'm kind of a wimp for spice, so take that as you want). Not bad, but not a shining moment in food history.Moving on to the entrees, I tried the sweet potato hash, and my dining companion tried the southern eggs benedict, which means fried green tomatoes instead of a muffin and pulled pork in place of the ham/Canadian bacon. The hash was a trio of peppers, potatoes, and sweet potatoes, though I wish there had been more of the latter and less of the two former. It also came with two chive-cheddar biscuits, which ended up being a bit dense and less flaky than I'd hoped. Honestly, I made better ones at home last week and better sweet potato hash with significantly more sweet potato. The benedict also was a bit lackluster; the pork was not as succulent, juicy, or explosive as I'd expected based on other reviews; the tomato was pretty dense, as well; and the accompanying potato wedges were only good when rubbed in the salty dry-rub adorned this and every other plate.I washed down my brunch with my first Mint Julep... not sure why I said first. It did teach me that I definitely am not a bourbon/whiskey fan. If you are, maybe you'd love it. I did not. My companion's bloody mary, however, was her favorite part of her meal.Nothing was bad, but nothing was great. It was good. It was ""A-OK."" The description of the menu and the smell of the restaurant made me expect great things, so I was disappointed. My dish was sadly forgettable; my favorite part may have been the chips of which I wish I hadn't eaten so much. For lack of flair, I cannot say I'll return to Chicago q. I did not expect top-notch bbq in Chicago (for that, I'll go to Texas, Missouri, or maybe Arkansas), but the reviews and the build-up made me expect more than I got. I haven't had too many ""meh"" dining experiences at places where I expected more (but see my review of Uncommon Ground). Sadly, this was one of those experiences."
"We had a special event here a few weeks ago, and it was start-to-finish perfect.  The Octagon Room was a terrific choice for private dining.  We had 11 people (it can fit up to 16) and the table is a big square, so you can really see and hear everyone very well.  4 people on a side, no ""head of the table,"" and no need for people to only talk to those seated adjacent.  When anybody gave toasts or presented a gift, everybody could hear it.  This is of utmost importance to a special night!  Also the room has doors that shut out the noise of the bar/restaurant, even though the room is just off a busy section you won't be distracted.We planned our set menu in advance and also ordered a champagne toast.  The servers were all fantastic, everything came out at the right time and they were unobtrusive.  They refilled the champagne constantly which was an unexpected treat - not just one glass each, I know I had several!  The meal was served family style which was a really fun way to have dinner.Everyone could order off the drinks menu (don't need to select a drinks package) which people really enjoyed as some aren't big drinkers.  We started with salad (baby greens, cherry tomatoes, cornbread croutons) and the the smoked dry-rubbed wings.  The wings were a huge hit, and the servers brought more when we finished them.  The salad was good, though not a highlight compared to all the meat.  I just thought we should have something green!  And I loved the cornbread croutons.  We then moved on to (deep breath) pulled pork, sliced brisket, St. Louis ribs, fries, greens, mac 'n' cheese, and chipotle corn.  SO MUCH FOOD!!  Everything was great.  The brisket was a highlight among the meats - some of the best I've had.  The mac 'n' cheese was undoubtedly the best I've had in a restaurant.  Absolutely fantastic!  The fries were crispy and hot and addicting.  The corn was full of surprising yummy flavors.  Everyone was just so darn happy to be eating fun food while dressed up in fancy clothes.  It was an undeniable hit.  The apple pie we ordered to finish was just okay - tasty but not as exciting compared to the meal itself.  We got to take a lot of the food home and enjoyed it two nights later.  It was a pretty good deal for set-menu private dining, one of the more affordable options in the area.  Everyone was hugely impressed by our choice of restaurant and we were thrilled!  Big ups to Chicago Q for being so fantastic and professional.  Such a great space to celebrate in, especially if you want to give your guests something more unexpected.  Nobody will forget your special day if you celebrate it here!"
"I would have given this place 5 stars but $20 corking fee per bottle was outrageous. The food, the service and ambiance was amazing, just really couldn't get past paying more to uncork our bottles than the bottles of wine themselves"
"0Love the food at this place,  but the service I received today not so great.  Izzy was not attentive to me at all.    I Will be back,  but if I receive the same service as I did today then I won't return no matter  how good the food is."
"Quite possibly the best BBQ restaurant I have ever been at.  Awesome facility and setting, truly comfortable and the food and service were outstanding.Sit down to home made chips and bread and butter pickles.  I swear I could have made a meal of just that.Ordered some hushpuppies as an appetizer and then got the Brisket Plate with cornbread and the mexican corn.  Daughter had the BBQ shrimp and my wife had the BBQ vegetable skewers.I simply can not tell you how good the food was and how large the portions were.  Service was awesome and felt very much like eating in the comforts of home.Simply love this place, can not wait to go back."
"This was a fantastic spot for our private event. We hosted our son's graduation lunch for a party of 15 here at Chicago Q this past weekend in their private, upstairs Wine Room. I could not have been more pleased with the entire event. Our server, Sima, was the perfect combination of professional, fun and efficient. She left us alone when we shared toasts and stories but was right there whenever we needed more beverages or food. The food was fantastic. Everything came out of the kitchen hot, delicious and well-presented. I could not be more pleased with Chicago Q and Sima for helping to make our special event even more special and will recommend to friends in the area."
DELICIOUS UPSCALE BBQ RESTAURANT! If you love BBQ with all the fixin's in an awesome atmosphere then this is your place to eat.
"Stopped in for dinner before we left town. It was conveniently close to our hotel and looked quaint from the outside. The inside was dark and the hostess seated us all the way in the back. You get free sweet pickles and potato chips to start. The pickles were on point, the chips tasted flavorless and over cooked. Our server came over to us, with a beard and flannel shirt, looking the ""rancher"" part perfectly. Too bad I couldn't understand a single word he muttered. Literally, he could have annunciated his words more. I felt like my hearing aid was failing me and I don't even have a hearing aid. I gave up. Smile and nod. I ordered the bbq chicken sandwich with coleslaw and an extra side of Mac n' cheese. The chicken sandwich is enough for two hungry adults to split. There must have been a pint of coleslaw on my plate. Share that, too. The Mac n cheese was very good, with a nice crunchy layer on top for people like me who enjoy texture. I'm giving only three stars because of the super dark atmosphere and bland mumbling waiter. The bbq was great, but when I go out to eat, it's the experience as a whole that matters. Too many other places to try in Chicago to make time to go back here. Forgettable."
"Finally went to this place.  Not what I expected.  With a name like Chicago Q, I was expecting an inventive restaurant with a modern atmosphere. The only inventive item on the menu was the chips and pickles they give you (for free) before your meal.  I really enjoyed it. You put the pickles/cucumbers on the bbq chips.  Perfect!  The rest of the meal was just ok.  The ribs were just ok.  Hubby loved the mustard bbq sauce so much that he bought a bottle of it to take home. The corn bread was HORRIFIC.  Dry, dry, dry. The one thing I HATED was the different level of ribs.  There's the basic ribs & the competition ribs (a recipe that's won awards). There's a $10 difference, so I ordered the basic ribs. Based on that, I'm glad I didn't spend the $10 difference because for me, everything on a restaurant's menu should be top of the line at whatever price.    And what's with the sauces??? Ribs taste better when the sauce is put on in the last 5 minutes of cooking. These ribs come bare (and bland).  Ugh. Nothing special about this place.  No need to go again. More older (over 60) crowd than I expected.  I'm not quite 60 yet, but I like a fun, modern place to dine."
"We visited on a Friday night, pretty early. The place was empty when we arrived around 6, but quickly filled up by the time we were leaving. Our waiter explained the store behind the restaurant and the award winning BBQ. We were ready to dig in. The place has an old southern library feel. It's more upscale for a BBQ place. The staff was friendly and we enjoyed everything we ordered. Get ready for leftovers! If you're a whisky or bourbon fan, be sure to take advantage of their flights. We knew we would be full so we skipped right to the main dishes. I had the Slider Trio of pulled pork and two chicken sliders. It was perfect to try a few different things. They do not add sauce to their meat but bring out a selection for the table to add as you like. It was fun to try everything. The meat was juicy and perfectly cooked. We also had the Brisket, which my mom loved. My dad ordered the Competition St. Louis Ribs. The waiter did a great of job selling this to us. The only drawback is that it only comes as a full slab. Get ready for leftovers! All the dishes come with the standard sides you would expect to find at the BBQ joint. Of course, they were good, but an afterthought when it comes to the meat. I don't think any of us were able to make a dent in the sides. Also in our group we had one non meat eater.  He ordered the crab cakes and was very happy with them. He cleared his plate! We had ordered several beers and after a recommendation that went back with my mom they graciously replaced her beer with another selection that was more her taste."
"I hate it when I have to do this, but after our 2 most recent visits to Chicago q, I have to knock a couple of stars off my original review. The reason is very poor service AND sub par food! I don't know what happened, but when I compare our experiences.......it screams INCONSISTENCY. So, on one visit, I went alone for lunch and I was seated at one of the high tops in the front of the restaurant. It was a Monday around 11 and the restaurant wasn't crowded by any means. I ordered the pulled pork lunch portion and it took forever for my food to be served. My server was nice, but he was missing in action much of the time and he gave no apology for my meal taking so long to be served. On this visit, I just brushed off the time lapse as a fluke. The food was good as well.On my next visit, my family was with me and this is the visit that guaranteed, it would be a long time IF we decided to try Chicago q again. So, we stopped by for lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was pretty empty, but again our server was missing in action, it took WAY to long for our food to be served, and the meat that came with our entrees was dry and seemingly overcooked (chicken and pork). Our beverages weren't being refilled and it took forever for our plates to be cleared after we finished eating. I'm more tolerant of these mishaps during peak hours of really busy restaurants, but there were only 2-3 other parties eating at the same time as us. Sorry, our love for Chicago q has gone awry.......on to the next one!"
"The BBQ is fabulous!! The ambiance is dark, with plenty of leather and wood. Amazing interior. You will love sitting on the leather chairs. The host /assistant was great with my children...brought them little plastic cups of water with kids without me even asking. And you would never even imagine that they would even have a kids menu. Fried green tomatoes were delicious.  Could have been a bit more flavorful, and I'm not a fan of ranch so I didn't love the sauce. We tried both the savory and sweet corn bread, they were fantastic! I also selected the BBQ flight. The chicken was perfect, as was the pork, and especially the Kobe beef. I'm in love. It did take quite a while for the platter which is technically an appetizer. My kids were finished with their Mac & cheese and were ready to bounce so we had the wrap it up! Try it! You won't regret it!"
"Nice place... The service was excellent and was probably the highlight, with the pork followed closely behind.  It was flavored well and cooked well.  It was obviously a good piece of meat and cut well.  The brisket is what is weighing my review down.. it was a bit dry and lacked flavor.  It has a lot of potential, but just didn't do it for me."
"Good service, and the food is phenomenal. Try the cornbread and the eggs benedict (with any meats)"
"Smoked Dry-Rubbed Wings - not exactly what you would call ""dry rubbed"" as they were swimming in sauce, but good nonethelessKobe Sliced Brisket - awesomeSmoked 1/2 Chicken - awesomeBBQ Sauces - enjoyed the original the best, the ""hot"" one wasn't really hotColeslaw - awesome (because it's not drowning in mayo)Pecan Pie - pretty decent, but presentation was a disaster. I'm guessing the dough was overmixed as the slice of pie had no structure and looked like it was dropped from the roof of my condoChocolate Mousse Pie - not as good as I had hoped, but pretty interesting flavor combination with the pretzel crust"
"I've been here a few times now and have had outstanding experiences each time.  Great food, delicious drinks, cute space and friendly service.  What more could you ask for??Right off the bat, the pickels and chips are to die for.  I could eat them all night with a cocktail or two and call it a nice, but that might be frowned upon.  I begrudgingly ordered ""real food"".  The Q Burger with pulled pork on top is cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious.  I tried a few of the sauces, the classic bbq was my favorite (but only because the delicious vinegar one wasn't working well with the pretzel bun).  The bruleed mac n cheese is to die for and the roasted brussel sprout special was delicious.  The cornbread (both honey and jalepeno cheddar) are tasty, but too dense for my taste... although my table happily absconded with the leftovers.  Drinks were delicious, a greal brown liquor person's dream!  I love the mint julep, and the Manhattan and Old Fashioned were great as well.  Other than the utterly delicious carrot cake, desserts were disappointing.  The peanut butter crunch cake is no longer on the menu, so we tried the pecan pie (disappointing crust and not sweet enough), the espresso brittle ice cream (good but not great) and the bourbon milkshake (not the best we've had, plus the cookies were pretty average).  Service was friendly and funny and really helpful, plus the space is really nice.  I highly recommend!"
"Chicago Q makes delicious BBQ, both during dinner and during brunch. They start you out with amazingly tasty seasoned chips and pickles (unlimited). I usually skip the appetizers to ensure I have enough room for the delicious q3 platter. I recommend the pulled chicken, pulled pork, and half slab of ribs. The brisket is the only meat I haven't particularly enjoyed. Their brunch options are fantastic as well - incredibly delicious benedicts, each served with its own hollandaise sauce and its own twist on the english muffin (one uses a fried green tomato, another a traditional southern biscuit). The service is generally excellent - very attentive, friendly, and knowledgable. I highly recommend it. Another plus - there's rarely a wait at brunch."
"I went here with a group of 7 for brunch yesterday. We devoured probably 8 bowls of chips, but they kept them comin'! For my entree, I ordered the Kobe Brisket Sandwich with cornbread. The brisket was unbelievably tender. I HIGHLY recommend. The food took a while to come (over half an hour), but it was worth it for the taste. The service was also great and the decor is really cute, especially upstairs!"
"It's a cute space and I wanted to love it...but service was a mess on a slow Tuesday night (restaurant wasn't even half full). Our server messed up our orders and then just gave up on serving us. Management was very apologetic and efficient in taking care of this issue, so big plus there.The food was just ok: I had the corn salad and bbq flight. The salad was too heavy-handed with cumin and the next day I noticed there was quite a lot of oil sitting at the bottom of the container. I thought the sauces that were served with the bbq flight were more interesting than the bbq itself. The corn bread that came with the flight was good."
"Service is five stars at Chicago q.My husband, young son and I visited q on a Tuesday around 1:00pm and ordered from the lunch menu. You can choose a starter, a sandwich and dessert from this abbreviated, prix fixe menu. The value is outstanding, as you get enough for lunch and to take some home if you wish.My husband and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich (the chef won a throwdown with Bobby Flay for her pulled pork) and I had the hush puppies to start. Our sandwiches came with a pile of perfectly-cooked pulled pork, a side of pickled onions and a humongous, sweet *hunk* of cornbread. My son ordered mac-n-cheese with a side of cooked apples from the kid's menu and he finished both very quickly. The hush puppies were particularly interesting! I absolutely love hush puppies, having grown up in the South; however, these guys were seasoned really well with a sweet/hot combo, which resulted in such a unique taste. I really loved them! Our food was served with a separate plate of an assortment of barbecue sauces (all wonderful), and before our food was served, we had some homemade sweet pickles and chips. A great start!I really liked everything about q, but I particularly noticed the staff's keen attention to service and overall presentation. Often, one associates barbecue with a casual atmosphere/rushed service; but at q, everything is first class and that's what makes this place extra special. Don't get me wrong -- You can go in jeans and a hoodie at lunch and be completely casual, but expect top-notch service.We ended our lunch with a flight of bourbon. Let me tell you, this is a GREAT value! We really enjoyed Brandon as our waiter - hilarious guy and not pushy at all! Jeremy, the manager, is doing something right (I immediately recognized him from his previous post at Blue Door Farmstand in Lincoln Park - another great restaurant)! We will be back for dinner!"
The dining experience here is nothing short of fabulous! Brisket - fried green tomatoes - creative specials - huge cocktails - The only downside is that it is very loud inside- hard to hold and hear a conversation Great patio with swagger - wish it was larger to accommodate more Great servers!
"To be blunt, they know their shit. Although I never been to the south, I feel I might have the right to say that I do have - at least food-wise. Had split plate with pork and chicken, which was huuuuge plate in my Swedish standards. I'm not a fan of waste but it's alright since they'll encourage you to bring what you don't eat in a doggy bag. What made the food just great was the sauces - at the end of the day the chicken and pork (particularly the former) is quite dry and not overly thrilling. But with some spicy, sweet, and sour sauces on top, you can't go wrong. Casual setting and service to the level of what I would expect."
Was just in town visiting and I was craving BBQ. At first glance I was expecting a small renovated house but once you walk in you will be shocked at how big this place is. The atmosphere is very cool and the food is delicious. They start you off with pickles and BBQ chips but don't fill up on these since the portions they serve are quite large and can fill you up pretty easily. I got the combo entree with 3 meats. My least favorite of the three was the brisket since it was a little on the dry side but overall I really enjoyed my time here. Great BBQ joint!
"This place is yum, though on the more expensive and posh side. Smoque and Lillie Q are both cheaper, though all in all, all three are great. My ranking in terms of price and food: Smoque, Lillie Q, Chicago Q. I really liked the atmosphere of Chicago Q. We shared the hush puppies and I got the Kobe sliced brisket. The hush puppies were savory and filling, I'd recommend them to share. The brisket was juicy, very yummy. Coleslaw was decent and the jalapeño cornbread was alright, a bit dry."
"Wow. I've been here twice in the last month and I can honestly say these are the best ribs I've ever had and probably ever will. I went first with some friends and the second time I took my parents who were in town visiting. They share my sentiment- Best. Ribs. Ever. Chicago q starts every table off with house made pickles and chips. I don't like pickles, but I tried these on my first trip and dreamed about them until I could make it back to get more. Amazing. As far as the ribs go, my first trip I had a half rack of the traditional ribs. They were spectacular, that is until I tried one of my husbands competition style ribs. Those blew everything else out of the water. I will likely never order anything else here because they are too good not to get. I've even eaten them leftover - and nothing is lost the next day. Yes this place is expensive but it's beyond worth it. Service both times I've been was spot on. Add that to some of the best meat I've ever had and I don't know how you could find a fault here."
"Love the bottomless free chips. Ribs was the best we had in a long time. Came with 4 sauces, all very good. Good beer to go along with it. Very satisfied."
"First off, GET HERE as fast as you can!  By far top 2 of the best bbq I have ever had! Second, you must ask for SIMA! By far, the BEST service I have ever received in my life! And that is saying a lot coming from a guy from the food biz.  She is everything you want from a server (knowledgable, kind, funny, prompt, and attentive).  I cannot say enough great things about this place. GET HERE!!!"
"Wow, my mouth waters just thinking about our experience here. It was amazing. The ribs may be the best I've ever had. That huge rack of competition baby back ribs stared at me and challenged me to go ahead. Oh, and I did. The most tender, fall off the bone, meaty ribs this boy has ever had. Holy crap. Trust me - order these!!!  I'm still fantasizing about another trip here and getting me some more!The bread and butter pickles are outstanding and a great start. The brussel sprouts as a side were one of my favorites of anyplace I've ever had them. So tasty!The atmosphere is awesome and the service was attentive and prompt. Overall a fabulous experience and HIGHLY recommended!!"
Was too expensive for the quality.  The brisket was way lacking.   They were dry and not as flavorful. The ribs were smoky tasting but something was off about them.  Almost like they were soaked in juice. If you live in this neighborhood its passable.  Don't go out of your way to get here.  I won't.
Delicious!  Deceptively large restaurant from what you see out front. Service was outstanding. Pre-dinner pickles and chips were fun. We added a side of habanero ranch for chip dip. Waiter recommended  the St Louis Competition ribs which were great all sauces were tasty. All in all great dinner.
"Great spot for upscale BBQ, outdoor seating is lovely and inside has the comforting feel of eating inside a house in the south with all the wood paneling and white walls. Service was impeccable-- when our waitress slacked off the food runners and busboys were refilling our glasses and switching out plates without hesitation.4 types of BBQ sauce are featured although we were only given small samples of each. Pulled chicken, pork, and brisket were all moist and delicious-- try the Mac n cheese and the cornbread for sure. St. Louis ribs were also meaty and fall off the bone good"
"I think this place used to be a downtown Chicago staple, but it seems like it may have lost its luster a while ago. Overall, our meal was pretty uneven.Good:The Kobe Chopped Brisket Sandwich was probably the best thing I had. It was a simple meat on bun set up, with a variety of sauces u could add. It was good, but not something I'd be dying to have again. Also, their newest addition to the appetizer list is farm-raised alligator. We decided to try, even though our own waiter warned us it would taste just like chicken. And he was right! But it was very tasty chicken at least.Meh:Oddly enough the items that this place is supposedly famous for is what let us down. The corn-bread and carrot cake didn't taste very fresh: they were both dry. At a previous visit to this place during restaurant week, I remember our meal being just as uneven - with their most famous dishes letting me down, and their lesser-known picks being the highlight."
Food and service were AWESOME!!! This place is a YES!! The atmosphere is very sophisticated yet relaxing. Very nice place!! We'll be back!!
"We went in for a late lunch on a Friday. Not too many tables were full and we were seated promptly. After that, the pace slowed wayyyy down. It took a while for the server to stop by for our drink order. When she did, I requested a gluten free menu. I would expect it to be brought promptly since we had already had ample time to review the regular menu, but we waited again. Even for tourists able to take a long lunch, everything just seemed too slow. A table nearby us actually got up and left after they couldn't take the wait.On the other hand, if you can wait out the slow service, the food and drinks were excellent. My wife had a mint julep served in a traditional silver cup, while I enjoyed a refreshingly bitter negroni variation. We shared some dry rubbed wings for an appetizer and the brisket and baby back ribs entrees. The brisket was tasty, though presented rather perfunctorily in strips on a big plate. The ribs were fantastic and slid right off the bone. We enjoyed tasting the four sauces, and most enjoyed the spicy and south carolina mustard."
"Let me start by saying I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars. The service was meh, the environment was somewhat loud and a bit crowded, but the food was outstanding. I took my parents here on a Friday night for an 8:30 reservation.As far as the service goes, we were seated shortly after we arrived for our reservation. We stopped at the bar for a drink, we ordered 2 Whiskey on the rocks and a vodka tonic. The Whiskey's were pretty small (about a shot). For having so many Whiskey's available, you'd think they would pour a decent glass. When we were seated, the waitress was very friendly, and always came around to fill our drinks. We ordered appetizers which came out promptly, and as described. Our actual meal order however took around 30 minutes to come (after the appetizers). Our waitress acknowledged that they were running behind in the kitchen. This is one of the main factors I didn't give it a higher rating.The atmosphere in the place seemed loud and a bit crowded, we constantly had to speak up to have a conversation. The bar area is really cool, I wish we would have eaten there. Maybe the place isn't quite as loud/crowded during non peak hours.The food was amazing. Everything I ate was really good starting with the pickles they bring out when your seated. All the sauces were awesome, I particularly enjoyed the spicy sauce. We ordered the meat sampler appetizer and all the meats were really tender and juicy. My main course was the 2 meat plate. I got the sliced brisket and ribs (don't remember what type of ribs). They were amazing. They also give a very good portion. I ate about 1/4 of my meal and had to pack the rest to go.As I said earlier, I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars, but overall I would recommend trying this place out because the food is amazing."
"I love ribs! Love 'em!!! The 'competition' baby back ribs at Chicago Q are as close to perfection as I've ever tasted! I'm no barbecue judge, I just know what I like & these ribs are amazing and totally worth the $36 price tag. Definitely large enough to split with another person. Of the 4 side sauces I really enjoyed the regular, the Carolina mustard, and the spicy ( the vinegar one wasn't my thing). The ribs could stand on their own without any of the sauces and they were just there for enhancement. The starters of super spicy chips and bread and butter pickles they place on the table & refill as much as you can eat are delightful. The choices of sides are outstanding & I'd love to work my way through many more of them. We had Brussels sprouts with bacon served in a cast iron skillet that I loved and a heaping pile of coleslaw that I'd rate a 3 star - a little bitter, not my fave. The restaurant is very homey feeling with hardwoods and upscale ambiance. The service was IMPECCABLE! It just doesn't get better than what we received with a whole team fussing over us just the right amount to make us feel super well tended. Our kids had been here before and had been raving about these competition ribs ever since. On their last visit they had also ordered a half rack of the regular baby back & felt the pricier ones were significantly better. Awesome restaurant, food & service!"
The BBQ is always amazing...the only problem is the mesquite chips and house-made pickles they bring out before the meal are so good that you end up asking for more (it's endless) and you're half full before the entree comes out.Good problem to have.
"Crazy, real portions. Not at all for the faint of heart.BBQ flight is a great way to sample all that is Q! I think what I love most is the restaurant itself, so beautiful. Wonderful date spot!The complimentary homemade chips are equally as mystifying. Try!"
Great place for dinner. They have a yummy variety of sauce for the delicious meats they cook up. I highly recommend the variety appetizer. My favorite part is sitting on the sidewalk patio with standing heaters. Nice and comfy restaurant.
The best meat ever. Anything you choose is good! You're not leaving that place hungry! That's for sure!
"I want to love this place.  The food is great, the atmosphere is lovely but the service was very disappointing. The complimentary pickles and chips are a great treat but we waited a least a half an hour to get them.  We sat for at least 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged and offered water.  It was at least another 15 minutes before we were offered cocktails unfortunately we were never offered a chance to order a second round (which we would have had).  I hope they were having an ""off day"" because the food is delicious.  We had 2 appetizers and 1 round of drinks and it took 2 hours.  Again, my compliments to the chef but I don't think we will go back."
"I initially thought I was going to be giving this place 4 or 5 stars but unfortunately we left feeling like it was just a okay. Location is excellent and this place is more fancy than other bbq joints that I love such as Smoque and Fat willies. However, I suppose this place is more about the fancy than about the food. If you want amazing bbq, this just isn't it. If you want to impress family and friends with an adorable place that serves mediocre food, than Chicago q is your place. The tables are nice and the atmosphere is inviting. What's better is they have a nice outdoor eating section which we were lucky enough to enjoy on a nice Chicago summer night. Now onto the important stuff, the food. The complimentary chips were probably my favorite part. They were cripsy and not over seasoned, pure perfections. The complimentary bread and butter pickles were also a nice touch, but don't over eat on them. My husband ordered the kobe bee brisket and it isn't cheap for $22 but it was over chewy and just not as flavorful, even with the four sauces Chicago Q offers. I ordered the St. Louis half slab of ribs and they were one of the better things we tried in our group, they were tender, fall off the bone, not too fatty, definitely delicious. However, also not cheap and definitely needed the mild, tangy sauce to accompany. We should have just gotten the full slab of these instead of that Kobe brisket. Oooh, how can I forget the corn bread. This deserves a section for itself. Because every good bbq place should have yummy cornbread. We tried both the honey butter one and the spicy jalapeno and both were extremely dry and lacked flavor due to the fact it was just like a hard rock of yellow bread. Sorry, it just didn't do it for anyone in our party. Overall, our service was also just okay, the guy didn't seem to try to work for his tip, but no worries there, he was still nice-ish. The place is cute, the bbq is sub bar, and I don't know if I'll be back. Maybe just for those yummy, complimentary chips."
Alfresco Dining and BBQ my kind of Friday evening!!! We started out with the Hush puppies and fried green tomatoes. I LOVED the puppies they were divine. I was on the fence about the tomatoes they were cut so thick it was a bit overwhelming. The Paloma for two was also a great drink agave tequila reminded me of a strong margarita. On the main dish the brisket and mixed veggies oh so yummy! I am definitely going back! BBQ downtown worth spending the money on! Our service was also great!!!
"Had a great meal here while visiting Chicago. Call to RSVP on the weekend, but as walk-ins we were seated in 15 minutes. Nice chatty atmosphere. Not your place if you're looking for an intimate setting.Good:-Food came out hot and fast-Hush Puppies-BBQ Shrimp and Herb Infused-Grits-Fried Green Tomatoes -Macaroni & cheese sides-Mashed Potatoes-Q3 (with St. Louis Ribs, pulled pork and brisket)-Poblano Peppers for vegetariansBad:-none"
"Full disclaimer - I am a Memphis BBQ Network certified judge so my opinion on anything they ship into Chicago from KC probably doesn't count...also please note that I have an immense amount of respect for multiple award winning chef Lee Ann Whippen...Lots of comments on the chips and pickles - I, for one, loved them both, but  I came for the competition ribs...also have to say the pulled pork was very good...But the St. Louis style ribs? Wow, what a disappointment! The first slab that came out was barely warm and with so little meat that you could see the bones pushing through on the back of the slab - more like the baby backs you get at Robinson's for half the price...Kudos to the wait staff, by the way....the place was slammed busy but our server was attentive and sympathetic through out the meal....The replacement slab was the right temperature and offered without question - good recovery! The meat had a good smoke ring and pulled off the bone the way it should...but I keep remembering how little meat was on those bones...Chicago is fortunate to have so many great options for BBQ ....if you're looking for the fine dining version in the Gold Coast, you won't be disappointed with the service, sides or the scene at Q; but if you're looking for great ribs, try Smoque, Honey One or come to Memphis!"
"This is not a typical BBQ joint, so we opened our minds and palate to experience q's menu. I ordered the Kobe Brisket and my wife had had half chicken. They were both delicious and I recommend trying all four sauces that they bring, because they bring out different tastes. I especially liked the spicy and the mustard. We shared a side of grilled veggies, which was perfect with the meats. The only criticism I found was that the cornbread was dry (possibly due to its large size). We both enjoyed the atmosphere and experience and plan to return to try more dishes. Our waiter was tops!"
"Q burger was too dry! The mac&cheese was not tasty at all, and the pull pork was nothing special!"
"Underwhelming and expensive.  I ordered the kobe beef brisket, and it was brought out as 8 tough and barely warm slices. The sides were excellent, but it doesn't excuse the meal to be mediocre and unreasonably priced."
"This place looks really nice on the inside and the food and service was good. I got the mac n cheese, bbq flight, and a burger, and they all hit the spot. The chips and pickles they put on the table are great as well. Overall, if you like bbq I definitely recommend checking out this place. I did not give 5 stars because the food did not wow me, but it was certainly a worthwhile experience."
Chips and pickles as snacks are so good!! Slider platter was the best of all worlds. Ribs literally fell off the bone. Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese were great side dishes! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
"My wife and I went here for our second time recently and had a decent experience.  The food came out incredibly fast (like a few minutes after we ordered), which is fine, but the waiter kind of ignored us after, not even asking if we wanted another drink.We had brisket and chicken, both of which were good, but I wasn't really impressed.  Sauces:NC - very thin and vinegary, OK flavorSC (my home state)- decent sauce but not truly SC BBQ in my opinion, missing some tang of mustardSpicy - ok, but tastes like Heinz BBQ with some added peppersOther sauce: mediocreOverall, it was an average experience.  I'm not rushing back but wouldn't be opposed to returning."
"i don't eat pork.. cus its not kosher.. but when i do, i only eat chicago q.the butter pickles, the blackened alligator, the cornbread, the coleslaw, the bbq sauces, the mac 'n cheese, and obviously the ribs..  AMAZING. if you are depressed, go have a meal here because it is the ultimate comfort food. the ambiance is great, its a fancy bbq restaurant which you don't see very often!"
"Recently we had a group of 12 that ordered the pork shoulder.  It is required you call ahead for this dish because it takes over half a day to cook.  And folks ... it is fantastic.  Let's start from the beginning though.Q has a beautiful bar with some great bourbons and whiskeys but unfortunately I ordered the Mint Julep and was left disappointed.  A Mint Julep isn't overly difficult to make but this one lacked any flavor.  A disappointing start, but things got better.We were seated right on time and ordered some appetizers.  The alligator is a unique menu item and while it tasted very good, like the old saying goes, it tasted like chicken.  The hush puppies and the accompanying sauces were great - definitely a must.  The crab and avocado was very good as well.Onto the main course:  the pork shoulder.  The chef came out and told us about it and shredded it for our group which was great.  It came with beans and Kobe beef brisket (outstanding), cornbread (average but good), and coleslaw (very average - don't fill up here).  We also ordered mac and cheese for a side which was loved as well.The pork itself couldn't have been better.  Very tender with the right amount of fat, it was some of the best BBQ meat we've ever had.  It came with four sauces but they weren't really needed the meat was so good.Unfortunately our night ended on a disappointing note: the desserts.  The carrot cake we ordered was very obviously previously frozen, and this particular piece had not thawed all the way.  It was exceptionally dry and the frosting wasn't good either.  The cookies we ordered were overcooked, and the cheesecake was very plain.Q would have been a flawless 5 stars if not for the Mint Julep and desserts.  Skip those items and you'll be golden.23/365"
"I found it interesting. Every time I'm here the bussers, different every time, they are all awesome. Fast, see what you need before you need it, friendly. However the waiters were consistently slow, very slow. No matter how nice they are, they are slow...As for the food, I really didn't  like it so much. I only go because I live so close by. I don't get why people recommend the hush puppies, they are bland and dry to me. So are the pulled pork, and brisket. I liked the St. Louis ribs but those are just alright."
"Some of the BEST BBQ in the city.ENDLESS chips and pickles, be careful not to fill up before your main course. I love the pulled pork sandwich. The meat has great flavor and you get your choice of a few sauces on the side from sweet to tangy. I am also a fan of the Smoked Corn, Black Beans, Avocado side as an appetizer, great summer dish! Would recommend reservations for Friday and Saturday night but week nights I always walk in without having to wait. Service has always been friendly and offer great suggestions.Highly highly recommend :)"
"Well.. Where do I start!  I'm from Texas.. Land of barbecue and all things beef! We were looking for a place serving black eye peas for New Years when a friend back in Dallas found ""the q"". Called ahead and got reservations as were traveling by train to Chicago.  I had seen the famous chef on TV bbq competitions and thought "" this should be the place"". I was wrong!    It started with a waiter who seemed to be put out with my questions in the beginning. we almost got up and left right then.  We should have! The Stated Kobe beef brisket had been sliced and waiting on someone to order it, dry at best on my plate and thin like off a slicer, the ribs had great flavor but we're definitely not off the smoker, more likely out of a pressure oven. The sausage was excellent!! However, not on the menu. The cornbread seemed a little dry as it crumbled when I tried to pick it up. And I never did get the butter I requested to soften it up. I WAS SHOCKED!This was not at all what I had expected! I plan on calling and speaking to her (the chef) personally when we return home. The service was poor from the waiter however the young man bringing water, chips and pickles was so attentive to our needs we tipped him separately and i might add equal to our waiter!  We were there around 6:30 pm on New Year's Day and the peas seemed to be the last of the pot.  We did achieve our goal of peas on New Year's Day but will NoT be going back there again!  We have been traveling the U.S. For a couple of weeks now, all about food and hotels!  Dallas, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and back to Chicago and home to Dallas. So sorry to say, Chicago lost all bids on food while we there!"
"Very nice place. Decent menu with various kinds of BBQ. As is often the case at such places, the meat itself is often relatively tasteless unless you pour on the sauces. Nothing to complain about but nothing really spectacular. Nice bar area, very cozy. Prices are reasonable."
"Food is great! Service was great. Slow night due to weather, but better for me. New selection in beer to which was amazing. Definite 5 stars."
I come here on a whim with two friends.  It was brunch and we were thrilled to find somewhere without a wait.  We had a fruit salad of sorts that was just delicious.  We also tried an eggs benedict with cornbread.  The cornbread was not very good. I probably would not order it again.  The atmosphere is lovely.  Do not go here if you are expecting a BBQ joint.  This is a country club taking on barbecue. If you are in the mood to feel like you're eating in a Ralph Lauren ad this is the place for you.
"I came here for dinner on a Friday evening...I called 30 minutes prior to arrival to make reservations and thankfully they had room for us..We were seated immediately upon arrival...Food:Freebies with refills - Pickled pickles and freshly made seasoned potato chipsThe flight ($12.25) - consisted of 4 different sauces, Kobe Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Pulled Chicken; the meat was perfectly cooked  so it was tender for sure and delicious..the portions of the meat is small because it is an appetizer, but if you aren't a big eater, you can probably just have this as a meal....note that the pickles and chips that you get on the house fills you up as well..*came with corn bread (portion was huge--looked like 3 big slices of cake..) - tasted good....House Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies ($8.25) - appetizer that comes with 5 medium size pieces (2-3 bites each piece), it tasted good, but I didn't really see/taste that much bacon or cheddar...the dipping sauce that comes with it complements it well.The food overall was ok, but not great great to make me want to go back to eat.. maybe I'll check it out for the ribs or something next time.Price: costly..meat is usually costly though..Customer Service: the waitress/waiters were all friendly and attentive, no complaints!Parking: there is street parking, but depending on the time and day that you go .. it may be harder to find parking.. they also offer valet parking so might as well opt for that..Atmosphere: casual, good place to go with friends for drinks or to grab some expensive food...dim lit place (so it can be romantic as well)..I would come here again to give it another try and actually go for some pulled pork and meat entrees instead of just appetizer dishes.."
"Have been back several times, and I'm never disappointed. Their brunch is great as well"
Went to Chicago Q for brunch with my wiggly 10 month old. Was a bit skeptical since the place in beautiful inside but they accommodated us right away and we had a wonderful experience. I had the pulled chicken sandwich which was fantastic! Only thing was some of the cartilage made into my sandwich which meant I had to spit those pieces out but the sandwich tasted so great I didn't care! Would love to visit again - thank you for giving this momma a nice brunch out!!
"Awesome BBQ!  Really enjoyed the Spicy Brats, ribs and brisket.  Corn bread was notable.  All in all a great BBQ Gem in the Shire.  Look forward to going back."
"Let's put it this way, I grew up in the south and this is one of my top places to get good southern food. I ordered the fried green tomatoes and shrimp and grits. My lord, I could eat them for days. The tomatoes were thick and not greasy. The grits were creamy. The seasoning was not heavy handed. We went during a busier time during warmer weather, so the service was slow at times. I can't fault them on that because who doesn't want to eat BBQ outside on a summery day?Bottom line:Thank you for serving bread and butter pickles and food with love, Chicago q; you have made my heart happy."
"Everyone needs an escape every once and a while. When in Chicago, why not escape to BBQ paradise.The meal begins with complementary, house-made bread and butter pickles and perfectly seasoned barbecue chips. From there, browse the extensive bourbon and wine list and relax in the ambiance of southern charm while you study the menu.While all choices are good choices, some choices are more good than others. Without fail, the Competition Style ribs and cornbread are a guaranteed winner. Also, the brisket sandwich and pulled chicken are formidable options; but why not just order everything? You should. The meal ends with a rolled-up hot towel presented artfully on a small plate. This turns out to be more-than-necessary considering the amount of the quite excellent sauce you will inevitably end up wearing like cheap makeup.In one word - the restaurant is STUNNING."
Went here for brunch and absolutely loved it!  Pulled pork eggs Benedict might have been one of the best eggs Benedict's I've ever had. Will definitely go back.
Vikki was great! Food was St. Louis rib and the spicy BBQ sauce was to die for!! We will be back.Plus I found parking right in front. That's always a plus as well!
"Local gem.......If you like good service and bbq!I couldn't wait to review.I went this evening to the bar aloneTo check it out. Menu is limited for me as I am vegan but that's neither here nor there,I know it's bbq. However great snacks, wine list however small had a few niceFinds on it. cocktail was amazing, the bartender adjusted it to myLiquor likes with no hesitation.That brings me to service. Kyle behind the bar was an absoluteJoy. Attentive, kind, knowledgeable, friendly. Everything youLook for in service, if you like to explore places and chat up a friendlyFace this is the perfect place to do it. Emily was also quite kind.Overall great experience and I will be returning to the barFor food, drink and friendly banter."
"Gourmet BBq?This place is good. A little bit pricey for BBq.They have blackened alligator.But we asked the chief if he would fry it. You definitely need to ask him to fry yours, too.It was absolutely fantastic.The baby back ribs are great.The chicken was moist and delicious.For BBq in Chicago this place is worth a try."
"I really like the feel and vibe of this place.  Its really distinct.  It looks like a nice white house north of the gold coast in chicago, but as you get closer you see that its a huge eatery.The food is amazing and not overly expensive.  I got the kobe brisket sandwich, and needless to say, it was so tender, juicy, and delicious.  You get 4 sauces with your entree.  I really liked the spicy BBQ.  It goes well with the pickles and chips that they give you too.Overall awesome experience.  I didn't have to wait a second to be seated (post Kentucky Derby).  Extensive bourbon/whiskey menu I will have to try at a later time.Overall, I highly recommend this place.  Loved it."
"The boy and I came here during restaurant week. I ordered off the lunch menu while he ordered off the regular menu.Spiced wings: very tasty and smokey. Wings were very smallSliced Kobe brisket: dry, not very flavorfulCarrot cake: moist and the frosting was a bit too sweet for me. However, I am not a fan of frosting. I always wipe it off. Haha.Mac and cheese: It wasn't overly creamy and I liked the bits on top to provide some texture. BBQ Chips: very nice and crispyPickles: I don't eat pickles. I hate them. I think they're disgusting. However, I had one and I was amazed that I actually LIKED it. I haven't had pickles in probably at least 10 years. Corn bread: We got both kinds. It was alright. I like that they had a variety.Pulled pork: Star of the meal. It was so juicy, tender and proper amounts of fat. I can see how Bobby Flay lost against Chicago Q in a throwdown challenge!The service was patient and nice. Hardly anyone in the restaurant during lunch. There was a kid who was playing hide and seek with me in the booth in front of us. The kid was so enamored with the staff that they gave him a small tour of the kitchen in the back. How adorable.Although I ordered from the restaurant week menu and he ordered off the regular menu, it came around $44 total? Basically the same as two lunches from the RW menu. I would come back for the pulled pork, even though it's quite expensive. All in all, a good meal.Man, I can't believe I ate pickles."
"Excellent appetizers, great atmosphere, and fast friendly service.  The food is fantastic.  I'll be coming back!"
"Food, drinks and service were great. Only downside was the constant draft of cool air where they set us upstairs.Highly recommend going here. Some of the best BBQ around."
"Yuuuuummmmmyyy! Delicious drinks, amazing pickles and chips for the table when you arrive. The bbq is served in large portions of whatever meat you choose and then the sauces are on the side. Hush puppies = love Only one thing... Don't do takeout or delivery from here... Whereas in the resto the food is abundant and flowing, the take away portions are smaller and more sparse. Still yummy but not worth the $$."
"I've said this many times before...there are certain types of cuisines that if you open up a restaurant, it's hard to make your place stand out from the rest of the pack. Italian restaurants are what they are, as well as certain Mexican restaurants. I found that may folks are very picky when it comes to barbeque; I've been to Kansas City where those folks are known to have great bbq. My boss wanted to have our ""monthly group dinner"" (I don't know what else to call it; it's nice that we have these things every month to explore the city together), so we decided on this place. The place looked really classy from the outside, and it also showed it when you walked into the restaurant. Our group got seated in a large corner booth across the way from a nice looking fireplace. The bar was a little further behind it. On a Thursday night, I was not surprised that there were nothing but corporate types at the tables (the men and women were in business formal attire and they looked like they were having ""meetings"" over dinner). Looking at the menu beforehand, there were several dishes I was dying to try. We started off with the House Bacon Cheddar Hush puppies. These were nice and crispy, and the tangy sauce that came with it was a nice addition. For the main course, I ended up ordering the Kobe Beef platter with fries on the side. They came as strips on a plate, so I was able to slice them into pieces and savor the juices. I did tell myself that it would have been nice if they had some sore of bread/rolls combo on the side with these. Still, the dish was good.Overall, Q was what it was. It didn't stand out to me, and I refuse to compare it to any ""authentic"" barbeque restaurants. It's still a great place to go to have a nice quiet night out or to have a power business dinner, but that's about it."
"Absolutely delicious! My wife and I were in town for a wedding and our flight got in late. We were trying to figure out where to go when the owner of another establishment who was closing up for the night mentioned 'q'. That was the best advice we have been given in a long time! Not only were greeted by a friendly host but our waiter was top notch. He was asking if we needed anything else and get the water coming. The staff were always circulating and clearing plates and platters to keep the table very clean!Now for the good stuff...the food, as I mentioned we had got in late so we decided to split the BBQ Flight. Not only was it a flight of pulled chicken, pulled pork and brisket it also had a BBQ sauce flight! We also had to spring for the bacon and cheddar hush puppies! It was awesome, we cannot wait to come back and visit the newlyweds! Go to q, you will not be let down!"
"Delicious! Cobb salad with pulled chicken .. the complimentary homemade chips and pickles served to each table are flavorful and addicting. My pear martini was super unique and I recommend it if you like pear flavoring. The atmosphere is romantic, trendy, and comfortable if it's not during a busy peak meal time. I'd opt for off hours or a Sunday night."
"Really enjoyed Chicago q! Staff was super friendly and our waiter was quite knowledgeable about all aspects of the menu. I'm always a little 'scared' to go out to a BBQ place, I do a lot of low-n-slow smoking on my Weber smoker and although I wouldn't call myself an EXPERT I do know what I like and what I don't like. All this to say that I really liked the BBQ here!I had the competition spare ribs, the dry rub was tasty and they were the perfect type of tender. Good color and smoke ring, too. My wife got pulled pork and what I tried of it was very moist, tender and flavorful. Also have to highly recommend the bourbon flights. Three generous sized samples come with them, so you really get bang for your buck."
"I know I had Chicago q on my places to ""try list"". So I decided to try Chicago q on a Saturday evening cause my wife was out of town :-(  My ""PLAN"" was to get some BBQ to go and turn around and go back home. For some reason when I pulled up to the Chicago Q my curiosity got the best of me. They had valet parking, SO.... I walked in and I felt kinda underdressed. The hostess asked if I had a reservation. I said no. She found a table for me pretty quickly. To make it short, the experience was a pleasant surprise, in part, because I was expecting a BBQ ""joint"". However, THIS was an EATING establishment!!.. with an AWARD Winning CHEF!!...that's what my waiter told me. I'm sorry I forgot his name, HE was excellent in his attentiveness & service!. The FIRST thing I had was the BBQ fresh fried chips along with the Butter Pickles I almost ate too much of that. I was kinda full off of the Pickles & Chips...but I ordered the Cheddar & Bacon Hushpuppies (Yummy)... I ordered a side of Mac & Cheese to come with a half slab of ribs. My waiter explained to me that I could order the ribs that are just tender...very easy to remove from the bone,or the ribs that are so tender that they fall off of the bone when you pick them up. I'm sayin', OK, I think they're bragging a li'l bit so give me the ones that are just easy to remove , because I think he's just blowin BBQ smoke up you know where....WELL when the ribs came, I just looked at 'em...looked kinda plain to me. My waiter did explain the sauces that were offered with the ribs 4 all together. I picked up the first rib and placed it in my mouth and wanted to stand at my table and give a round of applause!!!! I'm saying to myself, ""...and THIS is with NO sauce!!!... ""  So needless to say I DID try a couple of he sauces. complimented the ribs perfectly!!. I took my time and ate them real slow. I wanted to enjoy this. After eating all, my waiter offered me some Pecan Pie with Vanilla Gelloto!!!... I'm like, Dude ya tryin ta kill me, I gotta take it home."" I did. I GOTTA take the wife with me. So She can experience the same joy I did....and I MUST meet the AWARD WINNING Chef!!! I gotta go back!!!.."
"Great atmosphere, wonderful wait staff. Pickles & bbq chips as a starter - the chips are world class. My fiancé and I ordered the pulled pork sandwiches. Absolutely the best pulled pork I've ever had. Tender, smoked just right, delicious! Yelp's star rating doesn't go high enough. The sauces served with are impeccable. Can't wait to come back to try something else!"
"Awful arrogant and absent waiter even at 4pm on a saturday afternoon. The place is beautiful, though.The food: we hated it but to be honest, we're not that into bbqed meat with these rubs and spicy stuff -  and everything we ordered was veeery spicy and so full of seasoning that you could barely taste the meat. The spices are sooo intense that the ribs, the cornbread and the french fries all tasted the same.Again: it might be us. If you like the thick rich spicy flavor of seasoning accompanying your meat than maybe this is the place for you."
"We came in for a 4:15 PM dinner reservation for Valentine's Day. It was an 'early' dinner but the only time that we could snag at short notice.The service was great. Even though we were a couple minutes late for our reservation, the hostess did not give away our table and we were seated upstairs in a corner room where they keep all of their wine & alcohol. Our waiter was super informative and definitely knew what he was talking about. He knew which of the four BBQ sauces were popular with customers, explained the different types of ribs, and etc. Great guy. Now, moving onto the food. I love that they start with chips & pickles as the starter -- a great southern flair. The chips were seasoned well and very addicting. The waiter was great about refilling the chips as they were running low. I do agree with some of the Yelp reviews about the busboy rushing to grab the chips & pickles off the table, but all you have to do is let them know that you wanted to keep them. We decided to order the BBQ flight to start and to share the full rack of the St. Louis Competition ribs between the two of us. The BBQ flight came out super quickly and includes a sampling of their meats (pulled chicken, pulled pork, and kobe brisket). The kobe brisket was AMAZING. It made us kind of regret not ordering the brisket entree for our meal, but that only means we have more to look forward to when we come back. The ribs were cooked to perfection and the meat fell right off the bone, as our waiter promised it would. The sampling of sauces were a great complement to the meat as well. The full rack order was pretty big, so we had to take home a half of the rack. Given that, Chicago Q provided pretty good 'value' for a restaurant in the Gold Coast/Old Town area. We definitely will be looking to come back soon."
"Lunch on a Thursday, 3:00pm. The dining room was dead and maybe a few people sitting at the bar. My first impression, this is a BBQ restaurant? It looked like a fancy seafood/house. Weird, nothing about it said BBQ. Our server was nice and the bus boy as well. The lunch menu was small and very pricey. They put sweet pickles and homemade chips on the tables as a snack, wasn't sure if it's as free or not, it was. The bus boy even gave us more chips when we were done. I ordered 1/2 slab St.Louis ribs, pulled pork and coleslaw. It came with 4 dipping sauces, all were good. The pulled pork was very good, the ribs had great smokey flavor but very fatty with pink meat... Not the best. The coleslaw was average. My fiancé had a blue cheese burger with bacon... That was delicious!!!!! I enjoyed his burger more than my ribs. $45 for 2 entrees, no drinks. Although I enjoyed the empty bottle of bulleit bourbon that they put on our table filled with cold water, nice touch. I probably will not come back but I been wanting to try it out and now I can scratch it off my list. In conclusion, I had better and cheaper BBQ."
"We went here over Labor Day weekend and had a good experience. The chips and pickles for the table were very good and had just the right amount of kick to them. I had the Kobe BBQ sandwich and the meat just melted in your mouth. Also we had our 2 year old with us and they were very accommodating with a booth and had a good selection on the kids menu. There were a number of other families in the restaurant so I would say its very kid friendly. The only downside to the experience was that we had to order our bottle of wine three times as they did not have our first two choices which by the time we received our bottle we were halfway through our dinner. It happens, but it would have been nice to have that sorted out earlier by our server.Overall a very good experience and we would go back...."
"Chicago q is fantastic BBQ for special occasions, since it is on the expensive side. I have gone here for my past 2 birthday dinners with a large group, and they have done an excellent job. Both times we ordered the whole pork shoulder with sides, plus some additional appetizers and sides. Their pulled pork is the best I have ever had. I love the warm feel of the place, and the huge photo of Indiana country that they have on the wall.Warning: don't fill up on the free chips and pickles!"
"Fantastic upscale BBQ joint.Yes the menu looks pricy but the portions are HUUUUGE. A single serving of the cole slaw slide comes literally in a bowl. The meats very generous as well. If you're starving, then go for the 1 meat entrees. If you just ran a marathon, are at least 250 lbs or training for a food competition, then consider the 2 or 3 meat combos. The BF Is a big eater and could not finish his...Oh also who would have thought, their blackened alligator is awesome too!"
Would of had BBQ at pretty much any of Chicago's many BBQ places. It is alot nicer inside than your standard rib joint but that defeats the point. It was significantly more expensive and I didn't notice anything about the food that made the price worth it.
"I loved Chicago Q! I went in not knowing what to expect because I recently moved to the area and didn't have much to go on. It's quite a charming building on both the outside and the inside. They have large tables that can accommodate big groups (we fit 7 easily in our booth) which I always appreciate.In terms of the food, they put out BBQ chips on every table and they're delicious. We ordered fried green tomatoes as an app which were also great. For my main meal, I got the trio sliders, which includes pulled chicken, pulled pork, and brisket mini sliders. Our table tried multiple sides as well, we loved the fries and mashed potatoes. My one complaint is the Mac & cheese, pretty bland and not very cheesy at all :(.Our waitress was very attentive and split our bills up perfectly! I will definitely visit again, and next time I'm sitting on the patio!"
"Q has become a part of my regular brunch routine.  I  had been for dinner a few times and always enjoyed it, though a bit unremarkable at times.  Brunch is the time to go!  Sitting out on the patio is delightful (and dog friendly!) and the service is always impeccable.  You will never see the bottom of your bottomless mimosa - a blessing and a curse.  A recommendation: get hush puppies and carrot cake pancakes for the table to nibble on while you wait for your entree.  The main dish portions are large and can be shared.  A great place to come for brunch and dinner with friends and has a fun and lively atmosphere.  Q has a lot more character and charm than many of the other restaurants in the area!"
"Service was good and the place was nice, except for the fact that we were placed in the bar area that has a connection to the outdoor seating and I don't know what they were doing but on a very cold day, they kept opening the entrance and leaving it open for 5 mins at a time. I don't know what they were doing and I'm sure it was an isolated incident, but it really sucked for us. The food was a letdown.I expected a lot from everything I heard about the chef; that she's well known and makes the best bbq in the city. I think it was the rub that just made it taste dry. I really don't know, but I do know I've had way better bbq at way less expensive places. I wouldn't go back."
What a great place! If you're looking for a great BBQ place in Chicago stop looking and go here!
"I have enjoyed a fine meal here many times. Each visit allows me to appreciate more and more  of what ""Chicago Q"" has to offer: a comfortable atmosphere, good service, and delicious food.  This restaurant is clean! I've never seen even a water spot on the drinking glasses! The Q offers linen table cloths and napkins which is a nice touch that I fully appreciate...I especially like the hot towels with lemon after the meal to clean my hands after a rack of their delicious ribs.Most often the staff is cordial and very attentive...from the host, to the wait staff, all are make themselves available to the need of the diner. While our waiter was a bit overwhelmed with many customers, he still managed to get our party everything we needed. He was still able to offer this with a friendly and professional manner.The food, oh my, the food is delectable! I've had both the competition and traditional baby back ribs and both were, moist, tender, and flavorful. I've also enjoyed the brisket platter which boasts a savory flavor, along with a pleasing presentation. All the sauces are available on the side for you to add as you wish. However, I use them sparingly, for the meat always seems to be prepared to my liking. I have had the pulled pork and chicken too, both are quite tasty, and the portions are certainly plentiful. The sides, cornbread, baked beans, and coleslaw are all delicious. In addition, they provide complimentary homemade chips and pickles as you await your food.I have never been disappointed with my dining experience here. I give them my return business continually and would recommend this restaurant highly for a quality dining experience."
"Huge portions, above average Chicago bbq. I've gone twice and I've been sat in the front foyer feeling room each time which doesn't have the same ambiance as the other rooms in the restaurant."
"Stop #2 on our mini BBQ crawl. Best light, airy patio vibe, service & pulled chicken!We arrived at 2 pm without a reservation on a Saturday. The hostess asked if we wanted to dine inside or outside. It was a rarely mild August afternoon, so the patio was the obvious choice. We were seated right away on the beautiful beachy or Mediterranean-like patio. I was immediately thrilled with this choice which would prove to be the most relaxing and elegant atmosphere of our 3 stops. For a fairly busy Chicago street, I found it to be quiet...almost peaceful. LOVE. I will also point out that the inside dining room appeared decidedly more formal, especially for a BBQ restaurant.Service and pacing here is pretty great. We were brought water, house-made chips (awesome- and hold up well the next day), and bread and butter pickles immediately, and our waiter greeted us right away. Not once did we ever want for anything. Drinks were quickly topped off, our server and bussers always near by, appetizer and entree appeared promptly and appropriately, items cleared quickly (a necessity at our tiny table for 2), and leftovers wrapped up in the kitchen nicely.When you're on a crawl, you quickly learn to pace yourself. sampling is kind of a must, especially if you don't want to spend 2 extra hours at the gym the next day! The BBQ flight appetizer ($12.25) was therefore an easy choice, says this genius. ;) It was a trio of meats and included Kobe brisket, pulled chicken, and pulled pork, aaand it came with 3 slices of honey butter cornbread, pickled onions and of course, sauces, served separately (IMO, as they should be!!!). This is a great & affordable sampling option, but don't expect huge portions, as it is an app. Having said that, I thought the portions were pretty good to share for 2 or 3 people, maybe 4 if you really are just trying to check out what you'd order more of later or another visit. The bad news is, they were all excellent, so good luck narrowing down! The pulled chicken is noteworthy for its juiciness, no small accomplishment for off-the-bone chicken and definitely the best chicken in that category we'd ever had. Both the pulled pork and Kobe brisket were fantastic as well, and the Kobe was the tender, yummy highlight for me.And now, a word about cornbread. I'm not a cornbread girl, it's just meh to me, and often dry, so I defer to the cornbread connoisseur, aka my ball & chain on all matters of cornbread. The B&C rates that corn bread as 8 out of 10. It was slightly sweet with bits of moist corn kernels, had a nice darker crust on top. It was moist enough, but not as moist as some. Neither was it dry, as it didn't need butter or honey on top, perfect as is.  We followed up our appetizer by choosing a half rack of the meatier St. Louis ribs ($16), which also allowed for a side. Happily, I chose the watermelon salad, as we were considering that anyway- nice! For the ribs, the meatiness on the bone is fair, but the baby backs (typically less meaty) would have to be practically naked by comparison, though we didnt try them. They were delicious and moist. (If you are keeping score on this crawl, I loved them but preferred the slightly sticky, smoky crust and flavor of Lillie Q's STL ribs.) The watermelon salad with goat cheese, grapes, mint leaves and a balsamic reduction was a light, nice and flavorfully refreshing side. Very happy with that choice!  Sometimes you have to pat yourself on the back. Today was that day for me. Chicago Q is hardly a secret, but it was new to me, and I simply loved this location, atmosphere, setting, food and service! More upscale than other BBQ places, but not at all pretentious (at least on the patio where we were all relaxed and trance-like). It's a bright white small structure nestled among other much taller buildings (like the house in ""Up"" said Bonnie E.) and lovely for a weekend brunch (which they do offer). Do it, reward yourself. Our 1 1/2 hours here felt like a mini stay-cation; I guess that's island time."
"Had a group of 7 guys in town for a bachelor party and we decided on Chicago q.  We figured we'd attempt to be adults and have a nice sit down dinner to start the weekend before all the debauchery of the next 48 hours.  We were looking for a restaurant that was a little more high end, but not getting into Chicago steakhouse prices.  This place was perfect, and will probably be my new go to place to bring people from out of town. From the outside, this place looks like an old Southern style home, and seems a little out of place for this neighborhood.  When you walk in, it's crazy how big the place  is compared to the outside look. To start out, the waiter put bowls of homemade bbq chips on the table along with some sweet pickles.  I don't usually eat pickles, but paired up with the bbq chips, they were amazing.  For appetizers, we ordered the cheesie hush puppies, which were good, but not amazing.  I'd probably try one of their other apps next time. For my entree, I ordered the Q2, pulled pork and a half chicken, with a side of honey butter cornbread.  For $26, the amount of food they give you is crazy.  I had to cut myself off and not finish the whole thing, or I wasn't going to be able to drink the rest of the night.  Looking around the table, a couple guys ordered various types of ribs, and definitely heard no complaints. For 7 guys, our bill came out to about $360 pre tip, which was not bad at all considering we weren't taking it easy on drinks the whole time we were there.  Definitely worth it for the great atmosphere and food.  Of course, one of the guys wanted to play credit card roulette and have 3 random cards picked pick up the tab, and my lucky card was picked by the waiter...."
"This place is huge and it smells heavenly inside (like BBQ-heaven, obvioulsy.) To start, instead of bread and butter, they bring out bbq chips and pickles. I could eat that alone and be happy. But since we came for restaurant week we had the 3 course prixe-fixe. The hush-puppies appetizers were good, but the winner was the slabs of ribs for the entree. It was so tender and smokey!! All the entrees ordered were HUGE! The side of cornbread was the size of my head! I love the 4 sauces that come with it, but my favorite was the spicy bbq. Ask for more peppers and it will be even better."
"Great place to eat! Unfortunately, we were sat upstairs next to a private room and the bathroom so it wasn't a great place to sit. May be worth requesting to sit downstairs next time. Very quaint- they bring you bread and butter pickles and BBQ chips to start. Food was awesome. Coleslaw is nothing special, I would recommend getting a different side. Worth going if you're in the mood for some BBQ!"
"I love everything about this place - from the classy but not snobby interior, to the outdoor seating, to the quality of the food! I have never been disappointed in my meals here. First of all, they start you off with BBQ potato chips which are like crack. You just can't stop eating them. Then, everything else you get is just insanely meaty and good. I love the Q burger - and what meat-lover wouldn't want a burger with meat piled on top of meat?The Q burger comes standard with the excellent beef burger, top by bacon and provolone cheese. However, you are to choose an additional meat to insert. I have done it with brisket and with pulled pork, and both times it was excellent. The sides are always amazing - the fritters, the fries, the mac and cheese, cornbread and the greens. I also had their slab of baby back ribs and they were insanely awesome.And it's in a great walking area in the Gold Coast. Head over there and get your BBQ fix."
"Came here on a Saturday night and q was busy and very loud.This place means business. And by that I mean it's a well-oiled food-delivery machine. We were seated, ordered our food, and had everything at our table within 20 minutes. Not an incredibly difficult task for a BBQ spot but still impressive service and our waitress was very nice.We split a BBQ platter (sliced beef brisket, pulled pork, slab of ribs), a side of watermelon salad and mashed potatoes. Finished with a slice of rhubarb-infused cheesecake.Brisket: Dry, but flavorful. 7/10Pulled Pork: Moist, good smoke flavor, good bark. 8/10Baby-back Ribs: Very tender, good flavor. Good all-around but missing something: 8/10Sauces: Of the 4, I was a big fan of the sweet, spicy, and especially mustard. Vinegar didn't work for me.Watermelon salad: Pretty ""meh."" 5/10Mashed Potatoes: They are definitely mashed potatoes. 6/10Cheescake: I don't think its fair to say this was ""infused"" with rhubarb. It just tasted like cheesecake. Good cheesecake. And huge. But not infused. 6/10Overall, pretty good. Nice atmosphere, but not stuffy. Nothing blew me away, but pretty decent bbq."
"Oxymoron for a Q place - Refined & posh does not pair with BBQ in my mind, at all. Quick hit is to try the smoked half chicken with the pulled pork because that's the only way you'll remotely think you're getting your money's worth - but you're not. And make sure your pinky points up when using the lil' spoons to sample the sauces, y'all.Review:I tried the half chicken, the pulled pork, the brisket, and the wings with a friend. I also tried all the sauces. BBQ was OK for this q place... The smoked half of chicken was awesome and the best of the bunch. The brisket was good, too. The wings were fried and this annoyed me. Wings at a genuine BBQ place should NEVER be fried and they should be smoked and then placed on a grill. The sauces were all pretty spot-on and good but nothing too original except for they dainty lil spoons used to try them.There's also a poor beer selection but don't fret, you came here for wine paired with q, right? I would assume they probably have a better wine selection by the looks of the VIP-table-esque chromed bottle chillers that were lined up around the place.The only reason why we met here is because my friend confused the 'q' with the other 'Q,' the Q-BBQ on Diversey (& N Burling) in Lincoln Park that I enjoy & his bike ride was already too long to make him leave so we stayed.I'm glad I tried this place I but won't be back and I wouldn't say it's worth a BBQ seeker's effort to go out of their way to try. I'm a self-proclaimed BBQ aficionado from NC where my grandfather smoked & grilled eastern & western styles (& other recipes) constantly, and this place is ok; however, no way I'd pay these prices again for Q. I mean, really? Great restaurant for something else if that's the overhead these prices are paying for but not a Q place. I also hope they pay their staff well because they were great and service was great. Don't know why the manager has to run the cards though."
"I used to love Chicago Q. Great food, nice ambiance (love the fact they always play blues) and good service...so bad my last two experiences were disappointing. I went for brunch this past Sunday and we sat on the patio. Juan was our server. We both ordered the benedict. Mine was the smoked chicken and my husband had the kobe brisket.  I sent mine back since both eggs were OVERCOOKED. What is the point of getting a eggs benedict if eggs are not poached. Well, Juan was attentive and immediately took it back. He brought another one around 8 min later, after my husband was almost done with his (which by the way was overcooked as well).  Second try, eggs were still overcooked. I was so hungry and decided to eat the way it was. This place is not consistent. Some days are good and others days are really really bad."
"I had to say the owner was very responsive to my complaint and send me a voucher, to try them again, which I used for dinner instead of brunch. I had the BBQ pork and it was fantastic !!"
Incredible BBQ and kid friendly loved every bit of our dinner. Atmosphere was great and happening loved it!!!
"First time there. The ambience is good but the food is lacking. I had the slider trio(brisket, pulled pork, chicken) with a side of cornbread. The pulled pork saved them from a one star rating. It was good. The bbq sauces were good also, but I wasn't there to eat sauces. Complaints: The chicken was very dry. I had to drench it with sauce to swallow it; the brisket was dry and bland; the cornbread(sweet honey butter) was salty--to a point where I had to take a sip of water after every bite. I made sure I ate it all after spending $17 for a $10 dollar meal. Q is overpriced and the food is under par for what you would hope to expect in a bbq restaurant in Chicago. First and last time visit."
My absolute favorite place to eat in the city!
"We live a few blocks from here and visit often. The service is amazing, the prices are fair and the Q is always perfect. Make reservations early for the weekend."
Nice bar area. Our server was perfection! The grilled oysters and hush puppies very good! The meat ( competition ribs and Kobe brisket) were ok. Good place for drinks and appetizers.
"The only thing better than the food is the service, and the food is really good.  The atmosphere is warm and comforting, especially the lounge area upstairs.  Chicago q is easily one of my top-5 restaurants in the city.  I usually go with the St. Louis style ribs, slaw, and cornbread, but you cant go wrong with anything on the menu.  And the pickles...good lawd are they good!   This is coming from someone that hated pickles for 30+ years before trying them at the q.  Just try not fill up on them, as hard as that may be.  Special thanks to Eric (the bartender). He's served us in various ways over the last few years and always goes above and beyond.  We'll keep coming back because the experience from start to finish is always outstanding."
"Spicy food overwhelms the flavors, takes away from the taste.Came here for brunch, asked the waiter for recommendations.God the rack of Baby Back Ribs, and alligator appetizer.It took a while to get the appetizer, during which, the hungry guests munched on chips.  The chips have a nice kick to it, but nothing intolerable.The alligator appetizer was underwhelming, to say the least.  The meat was rubbery, too spicy, uncomfortably so, to the extent that the taste buds were basically rendered helpless to taste anything else.  We were quite hungry, and tried to finish the appetizer, which was not a lot.  The fact that we were unsure about finishing the last two pieces is a testament to the overwhelming heat (spiciness) of the dish.Next came the ribs.  The best way to describe the ribs:- very soft, but a tad bit away from melt in your mouth,- dry.  This was surprizing, because as far as I could tell, we did not order dry ribs,- with an unnecessary spicy kick to it.Side of fries was A-average, and the corn bread was so so.Ribs came with 4 sauces.  I prefer the mild.  However, when you put the mild sauce on already spicy ribs, you don't get mild ribs.Overall, average food at an upscale place.Might give it another try, but not keeping my hopes up.P.S.  I read some recent reviews (not Yelp sort), and realized that it was a total mistake for me to come here.  So I change my mind: won't be coming back here any time soon."
I was taken to this place for my birthday absolutely loved it the food was excellent I had the trio the brisket was a Lil dry but everything else was excellent I loved the blackened  alligator  with mustard aoili just the best
I'm sorry pretzel rolls are a gimmick. Not for a good quality sandwich. Upgrade the bread.   Place was loud. Hard to hear the person across the table. Seen the owner three times so she is interested in her customers.  Bathroom upstairs was much better than by the bar.   Corn bread was very good but it was explained that it was extra. Great mint Julip.
For a great bbq experience.  Tell them #porkmafia Sent you. It is a #porkmafiaapproved location for bbq
A hidden gem for lunch. I started with smoked wings for an appetizer and they were phenomenal. Main course was the brisket sandwich with cole slaw. The meat was very tender and the servings were large. Every table gets home made chips and pickles which were also very good. Service was exceptional. If I lived in Chicago I would go here every week.
"So. Amazingly. Good. We went here for date night and were so impressed with the service and even more so with the food. We got the plate of 3 meats--pulled pork, pulled chicken, ribs-- along with the watermelon salad (just ok), macaroni (good but very filling), and cornbread (must-do). To top it off, we ended with the pretzel crust chocolate mouse pie which was absolutely pheromonal. I can't wait to go back and try the brisket and eat more of that cornbread!"
"Been here with groups of 5-8 twice.Good: Melt-in-your-mouth baby ribs! 4 special sauce blend! Super yummy (roasted?) oysters cheesy in a good way ! Watermelon salad very tasty. A little bit dim but jice decor. Service great too.So so:Drinks are mediocre, side dishes(cornbread, coleslaw) can be better .Overall meats are all good and I enjoyed it a lot and will sure be back !"
Eh. This place was just ok. For the price and location I was expecting to be blown away and it was just alright. Boyfriend and I had the pulled-meat sliders and the babyback ribs between the two of us. We also tried the bacon cheddar hush puppies. The pulled sliders were SMALL. Like two bites each. The pork was by far the best. They do let you sample 4 different sauces which was cool.
"This was what I expected, good but not mind-blowing. Place was packed on a Saturday evening and we were seated about 8 minutes after our scheduled reservation. I immediately loved the ambiance and décor of the place as it felt like a home with a lot of character.After we were seated, our hostess told us that our waiter would be right with us. However, we waited over 10 minutes before our waiter contacted us. Luckily, the busboys delivered us the homemade chips and pickles and constantly refilled our waters. Those were a nice alternative to the usual bread and butter and were quite tasty. Our waiter finally came to us and didn't even apologize for making us wait, but to his defense, we believe that he honestly didn't realize we were there until then...so this wasn't a huge deal, but still annoyed as this kind of place should have known better and be prepared. This isn't their first busy night. Not an excuse.After ordering, our food literally came out in 2 minutes. The fastest food delivery ever, faster than fast food joints and even Jimmy John's. A little skeptical but got over it after remembering and understanding how BBQ is done.I had the smoked half chicken while the bf had the sliced brisket. My chicken was very juicy and tasty, as it did not even need the sauces, though the Eastern North Carolina vinegar sauce was my favorite. My savory cornbread filled with poblano peppers and cheese was also good, but expected more of a kick. The bf's brisket was average and definitely needed the sauces. I know that is how this place does their BBQ which is nice to get to try all the different sauces, but I'm just used to much of the flavor coming from the BBQ cooked in the sauces with additional sauce to smother it all in. My bf's sweet cornbread was good and I liked that they do give you the two different options of cornbread, along with fries and coleslaw.What was very nice was that the portions were generous. Cornbread was huge and a lot of meat to accompany it. Our waters were also constantly filled which signals for great service, though our waiter didn't really check up on us other than the beginning. My bf also had a whiskey flight and since it was a great deal, some of the selection was sold out so our waiter did kindly assist him into other options. My bf thoroughly enjoyed each of his three whiskey 'shots.'The best food item we had probably was the pecan pie. Not overly sweet, plentiful pecans, thin and flaky crust, accompanied by a comforting scoop of ice cream. Also, as many places do, coffee was offered and it was quite good, even though it didn't need to be.Overall, quite pricy but a lot of food. Solid tasting food but not outstanding. Great whiskey and bourbon place. Worth checking out, but probably will not return."
"This is good city BBQ for sure.  Nice surprise considering the neighborhood they are in.  Which also accounts for the higher prices though.  It's pretty good.  Not down and dirty, southern BBQ (Kobe brisket?), but still good.On a side note, they were at Baconfest and had the nest Bacon I ever had.  Sadly, they don't sell it in the store?!"
"Met a friend for dinner around 8pm on a Thursday night, I was able to get reservations that afternoon no problem.  Had great service all night and the meal was delicious.  I ordered the porkchop and seasonal vegetables side, although the mac and cheese looked tempting.  The seasonal vegetable was just as good though, roasted brussel sprouts with bleu cheese, bacon and figs...wonderful.  I think I'll always have to have bleu cheese with my brussel sprouts from now on.  After we dinner we enjoyed a glass of red wine and didn't feel rushed out of our table, it was a very nice evening all together and I can't wait to go back!"
I so wanted to like this place more:( The place was busy and had a good feel to it. It smelled of barbeque in a good way.  We had a great start with the delicious chips and smokey wings as an appetizer.  I thought the ribs and smoked chicken were the highlights of the main courses.  I felt everything else was just average.  I think I am spoiled by Texas brisket.  The group thought the sauces were bland with the exception of the mustard sauce which was good.  The sides were again lack luster.  The service was good but not overly friendly.  Overall just a big ehhhhh. Maybe it was an off night?
"The mission: Find a good place to eat a Thanksgiving meal at a decent price. The outcome: $33.50 per person for 1 Turkey Leg, 2 sides and 1 dessert. Score!After scouring online for hours looking for a good, but reasonable priced restaurant for Thanksgiving dinner (or lunch in our case) I stumbled upon the above deal at Chicago q. By far this was the most reasonably priced deal I could find in Chicago without going to a Golden Corral. Once at the restaurant, I realized that it was even better then I expected and seeing as most of the restaurant was packed at noon, I realize most other people realized the value in this deal as well. Upon arriving I noticed that many people had selected the per person deal, rather then the family special. At $33.50 per person vs. $195 per family I definitely think that per person was the better way to go. We ended up getting more food for our buck. After seeing the portion size we decided to go with 2 meals for 3 people, and let me say this was the way to go. We could not even finish everything with he 3/2 ratio and therefore I ended up going home with some mighty fine Turkey legs. See my picture for a good idea of the size. Overall we agreed that the Turkey legs, while impressive, we not that great. The meat on the leg was tough and hard to pull off the bone. I imagine that smoking that many Turkey legs resulted in lots of pre-planning and cooking and possibly the toughness. The sides seemed fresher and more than amazing. We got Hericot Verts, Sausage Apple Stuffing and Mashed Potatoes, the Mashed Potatoes being the best. Dessert was pretty good as well. As for the service, everything was spectacular. Our waiter was cheery and kind and helped make our Holiday extra special. Thanks to him for giving up his Holiday to make ours great! Even the barbecue Pit Master herself, Lee Ann Whippen, was there and with a seat next to the kitchen it was fun to see her working. Long story short, come here if your looking for some great food at a great price!"
"Above average food and quality service.  The best part of the food was the mac & cheese, which is why they did not receive five stars.  I believe when you go to a BBQ restaurant you should remember the meats, but this was not the case here.  While the meat was definitely good and above average, nothing made it stand out like other BBQ joints.  The service was a bit slow but overall was decent.  I think our waiter was a bit shy and hesitant to visit our table as we would walk by and look at us but then never stop (not sure why).  In the end, we probably won't return here as it is a bit out of our way and there are much better BBQ places closer to us."
"Pros- Food/Service was good and I really enjoyed the design of the restaurant. Well-sized portions.Cons- Maybe my expectations were a little high for the price. The food was good, but I don't believe it was worth $80. (Ribs, macaroni and cheese, potatoes, cornbread, chicken wings)."
"warning: PORTIONS ARE HUGE.Oh, and our waiter was really freaking tall and cute. Made the dining experience so much better. Hah.Okay, now that I got that out of the way, let's get to the more important stuff (but really, a cute waiter is pretty darn important...) I was simply awed by the exterior look of the restaurant because it's a gorgeous, spanish(?)/southern home-y architecture in between all these modern Chicago buildings. breathtaking. I was so excited to walk in. The interior is rather dim, but also a perfect mixture of modern and southern-vintage (I'm not making sense, am I...)Food:Pulled Pork ShoulderSt. Louis Full SlabHoney Butter cornbreadBruleed Macaroni and CheeseFree birthday cookies (3 different kinds!) and milk!!!! YAYYYYChips & pickles:The chips were freaking delicious. I'm pretty sure we asked at least 4 times for more bowls of the chips...maybe that's why I was so full by the end of the night.As for the pickles, very similar to Korean-style pickles, if you know what I mean. But it was so good my friend purchased a jar to take home for $8!Pulled pork shoulder:This is what I ordered. When the plate comes, you're basically looking at a mountain of pulled pork shoulders. Literally a mountain. I believe all the bbq menus come with the cornbread, so if you want to order the mac and cheese separately, make sure you say that otherwise they'll replace the cornbread with the mac&cheese. Anyways, the pork shoulder was TENDER, JUICY, and NOT. SALTY. You don't know how many places disappoint me with salty pork shoulders, but this place, was amazing. It also comes with four different bbq sauces (my favorite with the pork shoulders was the mustard) so every bite can be brand new.ALSO, I couldnt' finish it so I took it home and microwaved it the next day, and it was STILL SO AMAZING. Kind of wish I didn't eat so much at the restaurant so I had more leftover...heh...St. Louis Full Slab:No, I didn't eat the pork shoulders AND the full slab...I just had a few bites of my friend's and it was delicious! Again, you have four different sauce options, so that's always fun, and the ribs were delicious! Very soft, and falls right off the bone when you bite, which is perfect.Honey Butter cornbread:Cornbread comes with all bbq meals I believe, and it was a bit too buttery for my taste, but it went very well with the pork shoulders, and it was perfect to have a bite of the cornbread after a couple bites of the heavy pork shoulders.Macaroni and cheese:It was delicious, but rather on the salty side. but I highly recommend this to anyone who goes for the bbq because mac  & cheese goes soooo well with any kind of bbq.Free birthday cookies and milk:Yes, I said it, FREE. It was my friend's 21st birthday, so we asked if there was anything the kitchen could get us for her birthday (yes I'm that annoying person that embarrasses everyone by asking these kinds of questions) and the CUTE waiter said ""of course!""Out comes a plate with three different cookies with a candle on it, and a glass of mil (how cute)! The three different kinds of cookies were, chocolate chip, oatmeal, and sugar. Sugar was my favorite, and the milk was so necessary since the cookies were very dense and sweet, yet so delicious."
"I have come here several times and I am always cautious about what I order due to how expensive a meal can become. However, my in-laws have been wanting to go so I broke down and went with them. They ordered the full baby back ribs and the single pork chop and they said its was real good. I had the slider trio which I enjoyed a lot. However, the most popular items on the table were the complementary pickles and chips brought to the table. The meal total was $80, and that is without any alcohol, appetizer, or desert. In my opinion there are other BBQ options in town that you will get more for your money and tastes just as good if not better."
"Ate here with a small group of people for brunch. It's a BBQ place and I've never been to a BBQ place for brunch. I had the Kobe beef eggs Benedict. It was a southern style biscuit with sliced tender Kobe beef topped with a poached egg and a smokey sauce. It was served with a side of potatoes. It was so delish. It was so filling. I also had the bottomless mimosa ($20) which were also very good.  My husband had the carrots cake pancakes. They were thinner than expected but so full of flavor. We need to return to try the ""competition ribs"""
"Lovely upscale barbecue (well, upscale FOR BBQ that is.)  Like the white building and the tasteful ""q"" sign.  We elected to sit outside as it was a little stuffy inside.  It was a cold night but we asked to be a near a heater and were very comfortable.The music (blues blues blues) is great and perfect for the food.The homemade chips and pickles they brought were really good.Great bourbon selection. I had an ""inside job"" which was pretty good.  Hubby had some fancy bourbon (who can keep track?) neat.  Generous pour he felt.We shared a rack of competition ribs, sweet cornbread and their amazing beans. They bring four sauces to choose from.  Our favorites are the vinegar and the regular.Service was friendly and attentive.Everything was delightful and we had enough for brunch the next morning :)We shall return :)"
"GREAT BBQ PLACE!!!!I made reservation here on the recommendation of a friend. I wanted to take my husband somewhere different for his birthday dinner. Making the reservation was SUPER easy and they were VERY professional! They asked not only if we had been there before but if we were coming for any sort of special occasion. Nice touch! We had reservations on a Friday night at 7:30pm and had NO problems getting in on time! There is metered street parking or valet available. Their beer/wine selection isn't great (very basic and limited) because they focus more on Whiskey&Bourbon (AMAZING selection for those lovers). Our waiter was a little strange, he was VERY knowledgeable about the products and explaining how the menu worked for 1st timers (which we were and we appreciated). The food is AMAZING!! I highly recommend the Mac-n-Cheese as a side as well as the cornbread! The entree portions are large enough to share so you can get a few entree menu items to sample many different things (which we did). They brought freshly baked (still warm) gourmet cookies and milk for a birthday treat for my husband (which was complimentary) and they were SO delicious so save room! *wink* We will definitely be back!"
Loved it. Amazing pulled pork!Make sure to snatch a seat next to the fireplace! The BBQ sampler was fantastic as well and we left full and content! Will be back! Great spot on a cold winter evening or for brunch!
"Really cool place, charming ambiance, and wonderful food. I had the St. Louis ribs and the meat was tender and fell off the bone. And the sauces that accompanied them were fantastic as well. My girlfriend got the chili and thought it was so so, but besides that it was a great night. Recommend this for anyone who enjoys good bbq food."
"Holy God almighty the kobe beef is bomb. All the servers wear paid and half have beards. Since of their beer is unique and dang tasty too. Their veges are ridiculously good , we had grilled onions  peppers and asparagus. Meat codes with 4 sauces: sweet BBQ, hot BBQ, vinegar BBQ, and shine mustard thing (very tasty). Also got a side of Mac n cheese, which was decent.They provide free chips and pickles, which are BBQ flavored and sweet, respectively. One star less because our waiter had no sense of humor"
"The green tomatoes were very tasty and breaded perfectly.  A dash of salt would have been appreciated.  But seriously, who cares?  You come here for the Que and it...is amazing!  I had the St Louis ribs and so many tomatoes are needlessly dying for the quartet of sauces they bring.  THIS MEAT NEEDS NO SAUCE.  I am a rib snob and these are good!  Will definitely be back :-)"
"Ah Chicago q is the best! I read another poster's review who said it is bbq for yuppies and that definitely sounds right. I've been here about five times and every single time I try to limit myself on the delicious chips and pickles that come free (and fast!) and always always get full. The brisket and shrimp and grits are my favorite meals so far. Better than the southern food I've eaten even down south--and in a much chicer atmosphere with lovely white walls and pretty people all around. Each meat dish comes with several bbq options--the sweet one is my favorite. Love that they give you a choice and a substantial amount of sauce to test out. In terms of drinks, I think it's better to get drinks at the Pump Room nearby. I've had the campari drink, the bourbon one, and of course the mint julep. All were ""meh"" okay. Each just tasted a little bit off and not worth it for the money. Service consistently good. If you enjoy restaurants for the atmosphere, this is a great place. Cohesive interior design plan."
"Second visitWe ordered: brisket, pulled pork,corn bread, pulled chicken, ribs, watermelon salad, Cole slaw. Pros: brisket, brisket, brisket! !!Also loved the chips and sweet pickles that comes standard to the table. Service was excellent both times and food comes fast. Beautiful out door seating.Cons:none"
"Chicago q is BBQ with a refined twist. First things first, they start you off with bread and butter pickles (infused with onions and whole garlic cloves) and homemade potato chips dusted in some sort of sweet seasoning. If you are feeling the southern vibe, get yourself a bourbon drink. They have a vast selection of bourbons, all moderately priced. Last time I went with an ""inside job"" cocktail and was very impressed. Stiff and not too sweet, accompanied by bourbon soaked cherries. I am still eyeing the mint julep that comes in a copper cup with crushed ice - next time! I have been here twice, the first time we went with appetizers, but the second time we jumped right into the main event. The hushpuppies were good, but we found the fried green tomatoes too thick, lacking flavor, and raw-ish in the middle. The meat is where it's at. Anything they do is incredible and you are able to customize the flavor with the 4 sauces they bring to the table. They offer quite a few options on the ribs, so make sure to ask. Portions are large and I recommend sharing to get a taste of everything. Last thing...Poblano cornbread...do it!"
"Excellent smoky flavored meats, great service and pleasing experience. They have several in-house dressings that compliment the meats well. Never a disappointment and a good selection of adult beverages as well. You won't regret the food. A must try."
"I love brunch and BBQ, so this place really delivered for me. The chips on the table when you sit down are awesome! I shared the Eggs Benedict Flight and a side of the Sweet Potato pancake with a friend, and it was more than enough food! Everything was delicious, and our server was super friendly."
"The food and atmosphere at Chicago Q are consistently excellent. We had the pulled pork, baby back ribs and hush puppies and enjoyed every bite. What set our experience apart though was the warm and genuine service we received by our waitress Sima. We eat out regularly and she was easily the best waitress we've met in 15 years."
"Can't say enough great things about this place. First off, can't go wrong with BBQ. Second they have an amazing whiskey bar. Third the menus is outstanding. I have never seen Kobe beef ribs before so we had to get them! They were about as you would think, pretty darn incredible. I had the burger and even that was great. We also got some mac n cheese which I had a craving for so it really hit the spot. They also have whiskey flights, I did not partake however I did try a new rye whiskey and it was a new favorite! I really wanna come back in the summer when they can open up the windows and doors and see what the summer scene is like. If you have been here.....GO here. You won't regret it."
"You'd think a place that serves a burger well done after you order it medium rare - twice - wouldn't deserve more than one star, let alone four. The redemption here belongs to the excellent service we received after those two misfires in the kitchen. The manager could not have been more apologetic. Whereas many places would shrug or serve up a replacement with a sneer, we had or meal and more (a table of desserts, coffee, gift card, and probably more) compensated for. The service overall was excellent. Our server, Seth, was a constant presence throughout the meal. While we probably won't order that burger again, we'll be happy to come back and give Chicago Q another try. Thanks for the great response!"
"Between our party of 3 we strategically ordered all the different varieties of meat and they were all tasty. I wished the flavors were a little more distinguishable but that is the challenge with BBQ especially when you're using the same rub/seasoning. Surprisingly enough for me, the chicken was my favorite because it was cooked to perfection! I was less than impressed by the cornbread but that might be because I was already full off the pickles/chips they kept refilling. Overall, it was a little pricey but atmosphere was nice and would definitely go back!"
"Wow! Its a cute restaurant! Inside an old house, really really cute outdoor seating too. The subtle smell of yummy BBQ as you walk in got me pretty excited for my meal. Ordered the Kobe Brisket with honey cornbread. They give you two house sides buttered pickles and bbq chips, which are great to munch on with your drinks while you wait..But when the wait is over... and your BBQ arrives - YOU INDULGE! Oh man, every bite was beefgasmic! The bbq comes with 4 house sauces - with 4 separate little spoons (attention to detail!) Absolutely delicious meal in an amazing venue! You must try and I must revisit"
"With all the great restaurants in Chicago, I was reluctant to try Chicago q but I was very happily surprised. It's a BBQ restaurant with an upscale feel. The ribs were AWESOME! The service was friendly and knowledgeable. They have a bourbon list like I have never seen before. It was fun trying flights of bourbon. If you like BBQ, you must go to Chicago q.Special Features:Good for Groups, Neighborhood Gem, Notable Wine List, Hot Spot"
"Let me first say, this place is adorable! Felt like we were in a swanky Southern home for dinner- very well designed with such character. The food was very good- I got the pulled chicken, the BBQ sauces were good as well but all a bit spicy. The reason I'm giving two stars is because of how rude the hostess was to my husband and I. We arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation of 5. We had been walking all afternoon and were so excited to sit down at our table, grab a drink, and relax until the rest of out party of 5 arrived. However,  the hostess was so discourteous and snooty to us when we asked if we could be seated, snapping at us and looking us up and down. (Mind you- we are in our upper 20's) and felt VERY discriminated against because of our age. If our family had arrived, hands down they would have been seated because of their age (being older). It definitely put a bad taste in our mouth."
"I enjoyed this place as they have good strong drinks. The food, honestly, eh. The bartenders and waiters here are friendly for the most part and take good care of you. I'd recommend a visit if you like BBQ and like strong drinks. Otherwise you'll end up like me and only like half of it and be a bit disappointed with the price."
"Looks like I'm up and down about Chicago Q.  What's consistent is the service, the chips and the pickles.  Love those things!  I didn't stray from the cocktail menu too much.  I had Templeton Rye manhattans.  Very nice.  We started with the mac and cheese and this time it was wonderful.  Crunchy on top, gooey, creamy, cheese goodness on the inside.  I got the chicken sandwich again.  Its solid.  My friend and boyfriend shared the bibs done the regular way (I guess there are 2 ways which none of us knew about even though we've all been here multiple times) They both loved it.  I got the honey butter corn bread which was still not the best thing.  Its kind of dry but has a good flavor.  They no longer have the chocolate mouse pie with pretzel crust.  The waiter acted like I was making it up when I asked about it.  So I don't know if its temp or gone forever.  We tried three desserts, the pecan pie which was unsatisfying do to not being gooey enough and a dry crust, the cookies and milk shake which were not good.  The cookies didn't have a great flavor and were super dry and the shake was like milk and bourbon (but I still drank all of it) The winner was the ice cream pie.  It looks like they're charging $9 for espresso ice cream but its a slice that's rolled in toffee and then refrozen and oh so good.I'd come back because what they do well they do really great.  Although for me the main dishes aren't a draw."
"Was here for a private party and it was the best BBQ I've had in ...well, ever!  Maybe the best part of it ...was that the food just kept on coming... Pork shoulder shredded by the sous chef in front of us, mac and cheese, cole slaw to die for, corn bread that was so creamy (I usually don't even like corn bread), fried green tomatoes, and pickles to start (I couldn't get enough of these!)The decor was upscale southern cozy.  Only downside was the front room was really, really cold.  Turn up the temp to make it feel like down south!"
One of my Chicago favorites! Have been here twice... And in the three months of living in Chicago plus being particular about my restaurant selection (we all know Chicago is so plentiful of amazing restaurants) - Chicago q does it for me!
I have a suspicion my baby back ribs were in fact spare ribs but nonetheless this place has great service and atmosphere. They were most accommodating with my friends and myself moving to their upstairs lounge with bottle service. Try the spicy bbq - it's the
"I was attending a birthday party in Old Town and needed a restaurant for dinner beforehand. On a whim that Saturday morning I checked to see if Chicago q had any openings because I'd been hearing so much about the place. In my head I was thinking ""no way, no how"", but lo and behold there was a 7 pm reservation! I snatched it up faster than a kid stealing a cookie off the counter while Mom's baking. The bottom line, everyone should just go here. The ambience is warm and inviting (tables are a bit too close together but it's tolerable). In spite of the number of people in the room its not noisy. Staff is super friendly, and the coordination is amazing. We were never without drinks or full water glasses and the table was cleaned off promptly. I do have to say as nice as it was, and this might sound strange, I did feel a bit of a disconnection with the server. He took our order and was very friendly but other than that we rarely saw him. Oh and they could work on their sauces, I found them to be just ok. However, those are both really nitpicky complaints (I mean who needs sauce when the meat is that good?)Loved, loved, loved and will definitely be back"
"It was OK. The baked beans were great and spicy, but I was left somewhat unimpressed by the ribs. Small serving size, expensive, kind of overcooked, and not overly tasty."
"St. Louis Ribs!!!!! This place was in walking distance from our hotel and it was bustling on a Sunday night. We sat outside to enjoy the beautiful weather and our experience was wonderful. We were brought chips and sweet pickles when we sat down and it took all my restraint not to chomp them all up before we ordered.We shared the St. Louis Ribs and they were amazing, fall off the bone and accompanied with 4 different sauces. We chose the watermelon salad with fresh basil and drizzled with balsamic, it was the perfect pairing. We also split the mac n cheese and it was creamy and baked so it had the crispy topping that I adore. I would highly recommend Q to get your rib fix on. (I saw someone order the carrot cake and it looked great but we were so stuffed we had to pass)."
"I love my BBQ (Of course, like everyone else, I will boast that nobody else's BBQ touches mine and I have perfected my secret sauce).  I love this place.  Great food, great service, great ambiance, great people-watching.  'Nuff said.Ok, fine, got a few more words to pad up this review.  Have been here for both brunch and dinner, and excellent.  I get the ribs plate with cornbread - last time they ran out of the jalapeno, but still had regular, so who cares.  The pickles they bring out are *addictive*, our party of four have gone through so many bowls, it's not even funny (to the waiter at least, haha).Everyone is so friendly, and service is prompt.  I love the cozy, comfortable converted southern-style house.  It gets crazy at the bar area at peak times, but still room to move, and all the better for people watching.  If you have a large party of 10+, there's a big room right up at the front that they can reserve for you."
"A little fancy, but great bar and BBQ is awesome.  Bourbon flights are a winner and the BBQ flight is perfect for a nice big lunch.The hush puppies are ok, but nothing crazy."
"Came back for the ribs. Good! This is white cloth BBQ in the city and that comes with at a higher price. Berm here twice.  Too many other BBQ options to come back. Been here, done that!"
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Chicago Q! Will be back and with an empty stomach :-)"
"Q BBQ is always a great place to go for awesome food and service. It is a little more fancy than your typical BBQ joint, however it does not feel stuffy. The waitstaff is good at making you feel comfortable. Only request, Bring back the unlimited mimosa brunch please."
"This place is great.  A high quality restaurant with great food, outstanding drinks, and fantastic service.  The atmosphere is casual rustic elegance.  They did not skimp on furniture or decor.  Lots of street parking, great patio, and comfortable bar seating.  Have never had a bad meal here."
"I had high expectations for this place.  My brisket was somewhat cold and not tender. Sauces, sides, and service were excellent.  Perhaps I caught them on an off day. I will probably give them another shot."
"Ribs are very good & brisket was not bad, but prices have gone up & Sunday afternoon service was terribly lacking. Maybe our server was new, but several times we ran out of water & when we asked for more, recycled liquor bottles filled with water were brought & plunked on the table. Glasses remained empty. We filled them ourselves, and then again toward the end of the meal, it happened again.  Even though the restaurant was mostly empty - nobody was seated in the actual dining room, everyone was in the bar, front room, or patio - our table was cleared & wiped down before I could even wipe my hands & sip the water that took a lot of work to get. Sheesh. Shame since we are regulars, or should I say were."
"I came here back in July before I moved to the USA. First up, I am still no ribs connoisseur even now (after living here for over 3 months), but I was a fresh off the boat newbie when I visited this place having only been to one other rib place before. So for all you southern / mid west rib experts please don't judge this Aussie!!So right off the bat, they explained to us that there are 2 different types of ribs... baby back and St Louis... 2 different types?! Ok then, we'll take some of both :) For sure for me the baby back ribs were my favourite. So tender and juicy and the whole time I was enjoying these all I could think of was the Austin Powers line... ""I want my baby back baby back baby back.. ribs!""... now I know what he was talking about hahaWe also got a number or sides and pulled pork. All great and you get to choose from a whole bunch of different sauces.... Go the spicy sauce, was the best by far (even if it wasnt that spicy...but I'm asian so I like burning mouth spice haha) The outside is really cute (I walked past it again the other day and was like what is that place..looks like a cutsie brunch place, then I remembered its ribs!) and the service and atmosphere is really good. It is a great fancy version restaurant for ribs and I'm sure we'll be bringing a number of our overseas visitors here in the future!"
"I RARELY give out 5 stars to a restaurant, but Chicago Q definitely deserves it! I have dined at fancy schmancy restaurants in Chicago and shelled out ton of money for the ""hyped up"" experience. I will admit, I'm thoroughly impressed by the presentation and avant garde cuisine at the end of the long and $$$$ meal. On the other hand, as for my tummy, not sooo much. My digestive system is utterly confuddled by the crazy array of  elements, the sauces & reductions, endless drink pairs, and never ending list of ingredients that I can't remember for the life of me. . What I want is great, simple,  unpretentious service, savory foods, & good beverages to pair with our meals. Chicago Q delivered all of that on this special Valentine's day dinner.Outside decor reminds me of Charlie Trotter's. Cozy, homey, bright, and inviting. Their bar and dining area is spacious. The moment we walked in, we were greeted by the 2 hostesses and waited 5 minutes at the bar for our table. Bartender got our drinks right away, and we were led to the 2nd floor of the dining room. I really love the decor of this place. It feels like I'm inside some colonial museum surrounded by white pillars, mahogany furniture and floors, and massive amount of space for large groups. Right next to our table was a seating area with a TV for diners who want to relax before or after their meal. Our server Michael was phenomenal. He was friendly & explained any questions we had throughout the night. HIGHLIGHTS: ++ Instead of bread, they serve homemade kettle chips & sweet pickles. ++ Drinks: Started with 12 yr Glenlivet & ended the dinner with bourbon pairing presented by GM- Lee Lampert.               ** Going off topic for a sec, GM Lee is one hell of a manager (great one!) We noticed throughout the night that when he wasn't serving drinks to tables, he was busing off dirty dishes, filling up waters, or explaining the history & background of bourbon flights :)+++ If I can recommend anything, it'll be the chicken.              * Doesn't look impressive on the plate, but that bad boy is deceivingly  succulent, sweet, and juicy. It def trumped the pulled pork and kobe brisket out of the water. +++ CORNbread. Need I say more? So JUST go and check it out! No BS review here ;}"
"Yelp is like the modern day encyclopedia. If it ain't been Yelp'd.. Well it ain't right! After rigorous research on choosing a restaurant that offered good food, service, reasonable prices, and a casual but not dive feel in this area, Chicago Q it was. I must admit.. I was a happy camper when I left.First let me say how AMAZING the service here was. Keep in mind this is a modern BBQ place (as someone below described) but the service was 5 stars. I felt as if I was the only person they were waiting on. Paul is amazing and had great recommendations and offered the perfect amount of service to ensure our happiness and not annoyance. He got pulled into a large group and we got concerned for a moment. I think one of the ""Greeters"" noticed and came over to assist with a SMILE. I mean this girl was in her cute dress and heels, but yet she took our plates, wiped our table and bagged up my food. That's why I call service and would keep me coming back again and again. EVERYONE was fantastic.Now on to the food. They start you with the house butter chips (sweet pickles) and regular house BBQ chips. Both were tasty and we are off to a nice start. Since this meal was about all you could eat.. no drinks except water at this table.. bring on the meat! We then opt for the BBq Shrimp and Lemon Infused-Grits. Now the Shrimp was gigantic and the grits were not those southern Grits, but were a nice mix of creamy and traditional. They had a lemon butter sauce or something but it was yuckie. It good be eaten as a meal depending on how hungry you are.Then we opted for the main course *ding, ding, ding* I had the Pulled Chicken Sandwich (smoked chicken) with Fries and we split an order of mac n cheese. This chicken sammich was soooooo delish! Oh my goodness. The fries were the perfect size, texture, seasoning. But let's go back to the sandwich. They serve you 4 sauces Original Mild, Spicy, Eastern North Carolina Vinegar and South Carolina Mustard Sauce. I LOVED the Eastern NC Vinegar and the Mild. Oh goodness. It took my sandwich to the next level. The mac n cheese was not bad either. It was served at room temp which was a bummer, but it was real cheese, not too runny, and kinda tasty. With the portions the way they are, I'll skip out.. Conclusion: I will be back!"
"Wow - surprised, blew away all expectations and one of the top BBQ meals I have had in Chicago!We came here for lunch on a Saturday.  They were busy but the restaurant is sneaky large so they were able to seat us right away.  I can see how in the near future you will need a reservation to get seated immediately.  The decor and feel of the place was very clean, roomy, and had a feel of a modern whiskey house.The food: they first give a bowl of house made BBQ chips and pickle slices.  The pickles were awesome.  Our group was killing the pickles to the point we forgot to order food!  I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with fries and a side of the mac & cheese (to share).  My wife ordered the brisket also with fries.  The chicken was done perfectly!  It wasn't overly soft or too moist that it was dripping and it wasn't over cooked to the point it was jerky.  It literally was perfect.  The other show piece is the array of house made sauces they provide you to compliment the meal.  The spicy BBQ and the mustard were equally amazing.  The fries I truthfully don't even remember.  The mac & cheese is one of the best I have ever had!  My wife was just as blown away by her brisket.  The bark on the brisket was great and the meat was super tender.Great spot and a must try!  The service here was one of the best I have had in Chicago as well.  Not pushy, very attentive and never seemed to interrupt the table!"
"Eh, I wasn't blown away.  I was there for lunch one day, and we were the only four people in the place.  Which is huge by the way, has a Southern flair and a whiff of upscale about it.  Borderline trendy, but still nicely done.Service was very good, albeit a bit ""routine"" in that everything was done by rote.  Everyone was super polite, water was always full, etc etc, you know.  The hot towel at the end was a nice touch, though ouch, it was hot!The chips were good.  I didn't try the pickles.  I had the pulled pork sandwich.  There was nowhere near enough sauce to go around the table for four people.  Barely enough for one and suddenly we couldn't find anyone to get more.  The sandwich was good but not fantastic.  And I'm not one for finding gushy fat mixed in -- it grosses me out.  Fries were good but not as good as they could have been.  Someone had the combination platter which was a ton of food and he barely spoke but I think mostly because he was super hungry.  I can't remember what others had.  I mean, it was all ok.  I've had much better pulled pork.This is definitely a Black AmEx kind of place.  My sandwich was $16.  For about half that I can go to Pork Shoppe and have a much better sandwich with all the sauce I want.  I was curious about the competition ribs but it was a sort of business type lunch plus I didn't think $4000 for ribs seemed appropriate.  (I made that up.  They're super expensive but not $4000.)  Everyone was satisfied enough, I think.  It was hard to tell.So, it was ok.  Much better places to go around town, also without the hassle of the Gold Coast."
"Came here on the recommendation from a friend. Sit down, semi formal setting. Best BBQ pulled pork sandwich I've ever had. My gf had the BBQ pulled chicken sandwich which was really good too. Both came with a side (fries, coleslaw, watermelon salad) and four bbq sauce choices (original, spicy, mustard, vinegar).  I liked the original and spicy most. Also go the Mac and Cheese which was incredible. Two glasses of wine as well. Total bill was about $60 before tip. The chips and buttery pickle slices to munch on before ordering were super good as well."
"First impression made me feel like I was at a chic, southern farm house. We were seated within minutes, which was great for a Sunday brunch in a busy city. The server assistant quickly asked which type of water we would like, got it and brought us a few munchies. Bread and butter pickles and chips. Yummmm. Who doesn't love a place that will bring  a little freebie appetizer? Bottomless mimosas $20, Bloody Mary bar $7 a piece. Not bad for the mimosas. Great for the BM bar: heavy alcohol pour, bar chock full of peepers, cheese, meats, olives and more. Now for the main attraction... I got the eggs Benedict sampler, one of each of the Benedict's. My favorite was the one with the fried green tomato as the bottom. The flavors of all three were great. The chicken didn't have much flavor and I prefer an English muffin over a sweet biscuit or cornbread as the bottom. The hollandaise and breakfast potatoes were delish. I would love to go back and try the BBQ shrimp and grits or the grilled fruit and yogurt. Just gimme a English muffin next time ;)"
I love q!! Everyone was super nice. They constantly kept refilling our waters and the chips they give when you first sit down. The food was great! I just got 2 sides when my friends and I went they were the Mac and cheese which was AMAZING! And the coleslaw which was so-so. My friend ordered the ribs that were also amazing. Seriously you have to go if you are in Chicago! Try there toffee covered expresso ice cream it's to DIE FOR!
"The idea of ""fancy BBQ"" is a bit of a oxymoron.  We don't expect to have a white tablecloth and fine silverware when we dig into a plate of ribs.  There's something about scooping up pulled pork with a plastic fork.  So it's understandable if you BBQ purist scoff at a place like Chicago Q.  But in the end, it's the quality of the food that's most important - if it's smoked well, good flavor, and great sides, that's enough to keep me coming back.  And Chicago Q delivers.  Granted, I'll preface this by saying the price is a bit much, but not overwhelming, and there's a lot available at Chicago Q that you can't get at a Smoque or a Honky Tonk or even one of the newer places like County (haven't been to Green City yet, so I won't pass judgement on that place yet)We hit up Chicago Q for our final restaurant week meal.   One of the most redeeming qualities of Chicago Q is its bourbon list, and I started the meal off with a healthy pour of George T. Stagg, Jr. - a rare find in Chicago, and at staggering 135 proof, it's definitely a drink that will grow a bit of hair on your chest.  Despite the strength, it is surprisingly smooth, and has a fantastic smoky flavor that preps the stage for the BBQ.  In addition to the Stagg, another one to check out is their house barrel of Angel's Envy, a new favorite of mine.One of the highlights of Chicago Q are the housemade pickles - these guys are great - a nice sourness, with the right amount of spice.  Paired with the pickles (not pictured) are the housemade chips - perfectly seasoned, not too much sale, and a hint of sweetness and an awesome crisp.  To add to the restaurant week menu, we started out with some NOLA style char-broiled oysters- a great oyster flavor and topped with a healthy dollop of melted romano cheese.   Despite knowing that a full-on 3 course meal was ahead of us, we decided to order a few plates of wings - these dry-rubbed, Memphis style, and smoked, and I'm glad he did.  The dry rub had just the right amount of bite, the wings were perfectly cooked - tender and fall off the bone with a deep smoky flavor and cooked enough to have just a bit of char.    And of course, the wings aren't enough, so we had to order more - a plate of fried green tomatoes - lightly battered, sweet firm tomatoes, served with a great ranch sauce that the tomatoes probably didn't even need.  Was already starting to feel the fullness at this point, so I held back a bit here...And so we finally move on to the Restaurant Week portion of the menu - for an app, I went with the Hushpuppies - fried with a nice crisp crust and a nice mealy middle, filled with the right amount of small bits of meaty bacon and a hint of cheddar.  The mayo-based sauce served alongside had a bit of kick to it and complemented the puppies well.  my buddy went with the corn, bean, and avocado salad - pretty solid, but nothing much to write home about here.  Just a filler until the highlight of the night....Everyone's got there preferences for ribs - I used to be a die-hard baby back fan, but ever since a meal at Rub's Backcountry up in Devon last year, I've converted over to being an almost strictly St. Louis guy now.   Thankfully, my fiancee will usually get the baby backs, so I'll still get my baby back fix in most cases.   For those of you who aren't in the know, Baby Backs are taking from smaller (not necessarily baby) pigs and are cut from the top of the rack, so they're the more tender, fall of the bone type rib.  ""St. Louis"" ribs refers to the cut and not the cooking style and refer to the spare rib and are cut from the front (as opposed to the back, duh) and tend to be the meatier, more flavorful, chewier rib.   Both are done extremely well here.  Well cooked, great flavor, and perfect texture.  My rack was maybe a bit overcooked, but still pretty awesome and a decent deal for the restaurant week menu. I took pics of dessert, but could only manage a few bites at that point.  The cookies were solid - an oatmeal raisin, a chocolate chip, and a third I can't remember, but it did have bacon in it.  The carrot cake was also pretty good, but was a bit too cakey for me.  There's not much I can complain about with this meal.  It's not the best BBQ I've ever had, but it beats a lot I've had in the city.  The location is central and convenient for those of us who live on the Near North side and want a BBQ fix without haven't to travel way up north or to the South Side.  The ambience is definitely fancier than you would expect, but if you can get over your preconceived notions for what a BBQ joint should be, I think you'll be presently surprised.  Pics are up on my blog:eatinginchicago2014.word…"
"I had always avoided this place even though it was in my neighborhood although I didn't know exactly why. Maybe it was a few of my friends saying how it wasn't very good. Nonetheless, when it came time to finally go there, I jumped at the opportunity (even though I live right near there).First of all, the place is a nice place and the service is pretty good too. The food however, leaves a lot to be desired. The complementary food was a nice touch but a little too salty. The other food, such as some of the ribs we had, were very bland.Maybe I went on a bad day, and I am willing to give them another shot, but based on what I had, I wouldn't be so quick to recommend this place."
"Went to Chicago Q on a Friday night. The place was hopping, and the food was great! We went with the pulled pork sandwich, a side of macaroni and the brisket platter. Everything was delicious. My only complaint was the noise level; I could barely hear the people at my table."
Chicago q is an excellent place for barbecue.  It is on the expensive side but the food is so good it is worth the price.  The pickles actually were a really nice surprise.  The choice between beef brisket and pulled pork always is difficult but you can't go wrong with either one.  And don't forget to indulge with the cornbread.  A real treat.
"Chicago q: The Tale of So Many DishesThe two starting dishes are over seasoned potato chips (still good) and a mountain of weird pickles. A huge, towering mountain of garlic pickles. Enough to feed a kingdom and It was weird. I like that the server and water guy both approached the table immediately. Although soft spoken, the server did his best.The sauces are traditional, presentation is nice. The butter on cornbread wasn't cinnamon flavored. The ketchup wasn't spiced. Then why did they take it out of the bottle/plastic? Interesting. Then, hand towels came after the meal, very thoughtful, but with a confusing lemon. A lemon? I did however, pick the best meal of the evening. I ordered the chili with kobe brisket chunks. And man, it was incredibly meaty. I thought the cornbread was really soft and unsavory, it crumbled quite easy."
"Fantastic service - a drink was spilled on my wife and we were provided with the full meal for free, including drinks!The food was good, but not great. The meat was very well cooked, however they provided sauces on the side so you can choose which you wanted with each bite of food. A nice idea, but personally I prefer to have my BBQ slathered in rich sauce."
"It's a large - and upscale - BBQ restaurant in the Gold Coast area of Chicago just south of Division on Dearborn.  It used to be a sushi place when I lived in the neighborhood many years ago but from what I understand Chicago Q has been open for over a year and seems to be doing thngs quite well.Dinner starts with some spicy, very tasty potato chips being placed on the table to munch on while you peruse the menu.  Then hopefully you'll get better drink service than we did but eventually the table got one round of drinks which was it for the entire dinner.  It was probably a tough night when I was there because there were 3 tables of 10+ which has to mess up the kitchen but overall I wasn't that impressed with the service for this reason.  The food, however, was quite good.  We started with some blackened alligator for an appetizer since one of my colleagues thought it looked interesting - it was very meaty but not rubbery and tasted quite good.  On to the main course, the ""competition"" ribs were quite good but a bit overpriced at $35 and I really don't think these would have done very well at a competition given that one slab had meat which pulled off the bone very easily.  The nice thing is that each rib was already cut so you didn't have to worry about slicing each rib yourself and making a big mess.The only thing I recall at the table which wasn't a hit was the salmon, but otherwise everybody appeared to enjoy their meal.  This place is a go-to for one of my company's executives and he eats out a lot so I think that definitely says something.  Clearly some of the better BBQ in town, though a much more upscale experience than you'd expect from BBQ.  At these prices and in this ambience I expect the service to be better but I know it was a potentially difficult night so overall I'm a fan and I may be back."
I am from Kansas City so I am veryyyyyy particular on my ribs... This place was not too bad! Very good considering it isn't in Kc! Fancy environment with nice and attentive waiters! Highly recommend this place for BBQ in Chicago :) had the baby back ribs and the St. Louis slab. Both were great!
"I'm a big fan of BBQ when done right and an amazingly bad critic when done wrong. I lived in the South for a number of years, and while I was able to shun their 8"" shorts and stupid haircuts, I did gain a whole new appreciation for savory, well-done pork. With that being said, Chicago Q gets it right.The decor and atmosphere are a bit surprising, as it seems befitting of a higher-end steakhouse than a finger-licking comfort food joint. We went on a slow Monday night and the service was ""meh."" The biggest pet peeve is having to ask for a waiter, ESPECIALLY if the place is half empty. Step it up with some initiative, man. Other than that minature snafu, the rest of our meal was delightful! We opted for the Q3 meal, which is your choice of three meats + a side. The Kobe beef brisket was very tender (although it had come with a ton of praise beforehand and I was a bit let down), the pulled pork was solid, but the shining jewel was the baby back ribs. Good God almighty! My girlfriend, who tends to stick to the food my food eats rather than the  meat, even loved it. The best is the hot towel finish which was surprising and awesome.Will definitely go back and hopefully get someone to move a little quicker when we get there!"
"I came here on my last visit to the CHI to visit with a friend.  She's been a fan of Chicago q since it opened and she's had parties here etc.  They've been good to her, so why wouldn't she want to show it off?Chicago q is very cute & white picked fence looking.  I only sat at the bar because I was waiting for my friend.  After a while, I felt bad for not having a drink, and sleepy, so I ordered a French Press of Coffee.  It was okay.  I think I do a better French Press at home, but hey, not everyone loves a deep, dark coffee like moi.Upon my friend's arrival, we moved to the patio.  Sweet, cozy, and we had our pick of the tables.  The GM came out to greet my friend and was very pleasant to me as well.  This is a great little patio for people watching in the posher neighborhood of the CHI.I seriously have very little to say about the food because I really didn't have any.  This day was HELLA hot and I had NO appetite.  I did order the BBQ flight and I enjoyed the pork and the chicken the best.  They brought approximately 6 sauces to try.  I enjoyed the mustard the best.  The corn bread was WAY too sweet, I would have preferred maybe the jalapeno kind, but like I said...I wasn't hungry.  The BBQ chips and pickles the were complimentary to each table were amazing.  The service was spectacular I'd go again, and probably next time with an appetite."
"I go here frequently because I live in the area, usually for brunch.  The service and food is always excellent.  The restaurant itself is modern, yet homey.  In the summer the outdoor patio option is great.  The menu seems limited, but really there is something for everyone.  The cocktails are excellent.  Great bloody mary bar on the weekend.  The great free, house made appetizers of pickles and chips to start your meal is very generous and rare these days.  The owners are there frequently and you can tell they care.  Very professional staff.  If there was any complaint its more like a request- would be great to see more specials or rotating, seasonal options to mix it up for those that have had everything.  Can't wait for their new endeavor to open up!"
"This place was an unexpected awesome find in Chicago.  We were out riding Divvy bikes and found great reviews on Yelp so decided to give it a try.  They have very quaint outdoor seating but the weather looked ominous so we ate at a high top in the bar area.  As soon as we were seated they brought a bowl of homemade potato chips and sweet pickles. A nice touch to nibble on while we decided.  The pickle were delicious - sweet with a little zing of spicy.  We decided to go for the 2-course per fixe lunch.  I had hush puppy appetizer with pulled pork sandwich and my husband had BBQ wings with pulled chicken sandwich. We thought the BBQ sauce on the wings was the best and wish they brought some of that sauce for the sandwiches. They brought 4 different sauces for the sandwiches - they all offered something different.  I used a mix of the north Carolina vinegar based sauce and the spicy sauce on my sandwich while my husband used the mustard and regular BBQ.  The meat on both our sandwiches melted in your mouth.  A hefty side of coleslaw accompanied each.  The staff was very attentive and never left your drink empty. They had a great selection of whiskeys, bourbons, beer and other cocktails but I stuck to fresh brewed iced tea which was good.  For a nice touch they offer warm towels to wash our hands at the end of the meal.  When we are back in Chicago we will definitely return to Q - it was a highlight of our visit."
"Complementary homemade BBQ chips and delicious pickles start the meal out at a high bar, but Chicago q doesn't disappoint thereafter. Appetize with the hushpuppies, please; do it for me. And move on to anything for the main dish, as it will be delicious, filling, and comforting. My favorites are anything brisket. To end, try the cookies and milk. The staff is excellent, the atmosphere and vibe are well developed, and, as strongly hinted at above, the food is unparalleled. Indulge in some 'q, and try to sit outside now that the weather is (hopefully) looking up!"
"Finger lickin' good BBQ with Gold Coast style!I ended my Restaurant Week endeavor with an early weekend lunch. We opted to sit near the fireplace in the ""casual"" seating area up front. We were promptly handed various menus, dark napkins and a bowl of BBQ chips 'n pickles. BACON CHEDDAR HUSH PUPPIESThis was my first time having hush puppies and thought they were decent. Came with a side of chipotle sauce.HALF SLAB ST LOUIS RIBSFall-off-the-bone, tenderness! Came with the largest piece of honey butter cornbread. Needless to say, I could not finish. I loved having the options of slathering different sauces: honey mustard, original, spicy, and cider vinegar.   MILK AND COOKIESGreat ending to the meal! Between three different options, I picked the oatmeal 'n bacon and white chocolate apricot almond bar. However, I would've liked more sweetness with the oatmeal 'n bacon... maybe more raisins or chocolate to offset the smokiness of the bacon.Service was friendly. Our server came around post-entree with hot towelettes for our BBQ laden hands. With such generous portions, we ended up toting leftover CQ bags. I definitely will be back to sample their other meat offerings!"
"HANDS DOWN....the BEST BBQ i have ever had! We came here for Brunch, but i ended up with the Pulled Pork Sandwich. This was seriously the best pulled pork i have ever had (even at 10am!) Plus along with the sandwitch they provide you a variety of sauces from spicy to sweet. We started off with the Bloody Mary bar and $20 endless mimosas. As you wait for your food, they bring you out their special pickles and homemade bbq chips-which were fantastic. A handfull of the group ordered their Eggs Benedict which they are know for-the plates of food were HUGE and very tasty- my favorite was the Southern. We also sampled the carrot cake pancakes which were really thin, but bursting with flavor. Everything was AMAZING and can't wait to return to try the burgers and ribs which I was told to order as well as the tasty homemade desserts."
Food is still amazing.Updating to say they have a gluten free menu. It's so good. I love this place. It's food heaven!My husband (who was trying it for the first time) said that it was the best BBQ he's ever had. It was a slow afternoon (we were there for lunch) and the our waitress gave us a tour of the kitchen. Totally awesome. Definitely will be back.
The best BBQ! We had wonderful service everyone was friendly and all of the food we got was wonderful!! The BBQ comes with 4 diff sauces so tasty!! I recommend going here and I will be back!! :) great place
"Great food, and a great value! Don't let the small entrance fool you. Love the pickles and chips that come with the meals."
"I loved Chicago q. I loved the atmosphere. The restaurant is sectioned off pretty nicely. Even though it is a pretty big place, you don't feel like you're in a loud crowded space. Our waiter, Benjamin, was very knowledgeable about the beers and bbq. He also had a killer beard. The alligator appetizer was amazing. I will definitely be getting that when I go back. I split the q3 with another person, along with a side of the award winning potato salad. With the meal, appetizer, and side, it was more than enough food for the two of us. Long story short - we will be back :)"
"Oh this place was great!!First of all, we had 11 people, 3 of which were UNDER THE AGE OF 8, ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. Dad had made reservations weeks in advance, and I can't express how great an idea that was.  They gave us the front room on the bottom floor.  We could close the doors to shut out the bar noise.... It was PERFECT.  The kids have a tendency to be over simulated at loud restaurants, so having this room for us was too great.  It would have been a nightmare for us, and anyone within earshot of a screaming child.While I can't say this place is great for kids, they do have a kids' menu.  And all I can say about that is that both the 7-yr-old and the 4-yr-old ATE EVERYTHING, and let me tell you, the plates here are not small.As far as the adults go:I started with a smoke porter from O'Fallon, dad had the 8-bit pale ale.  My lady friend and older bro had Bell's Oberon, little bro had a simple rum cocktail named ""Synthesize"", mom and sis-in-law (SIL) had lemonade.  0 complaints.There's alligator (Cajun seasoning with some sort of horseradish dip) on the appetizer menu, and I've been dying to try alligator forever.  Also, dad, big bro and SIL had read about the bacon cheddar hush puppies (deep-fried corn bread with some spicy seasoning) so we also had to have a go at those.  Again, 0 complaints.I switched to a double IPA , like I do, and had the q2, 2 meats and a side.  I had the brisket and St Louis 1/2 rack with the poblano corn bread.  Dad had the same, but with baby back ribs.  Lady friend got the slider trio (mini sandwiches, 1 each of brisket, pulled pork, and shredded chicken).  Little bro's lady got the brisket sandwich and after one bite, gave me that ""holy-shit-that's-good"" look.  Mom had the watermelon salad and some meat of sorts.  SIL and lady friend shared the patio salad, to much  I remember seeing a lot of ribs and meats at the beginning, and a lot of empty plates at the end.  My lady friend wasn't too impressed with her sandwiches, then I pointed out to her that everything comes dry- the sauces are served on the side (the waitress DID mention this before we'd ordered, so no demerit there) and as soon as she added some BBQ sauce LOVED her brisket slider and pulled pork slider.  General family consensus, the meals were great.I must say we would not have had the same experience without the privacy from the bar.  Thank you so much to the hostesses, or server and her shadow!!!"
"My new favorite fancy bbq joint in Chicago. The food and service was outstanding, the ambiance was romantic and elegant. And to top it off they start you off with homemade butter pickles and bbq potato chips. It doesn't get better than that folks."
"3.5 stars My first meal in Chicago was at Chicago q as it came highly recommended by a friend and since I was in the ""Midwest""? let's eat!Boyfriend and I had a reservation so we walked on over from our hotel (tres convenient!) and walked on in.  First thing that caught my eye was their bar and massive wall of bourbons!  Woah!  Anyone who is a bourbon lover, Chicago q is your place! Walk further back to their dining room and it's as if you are sitting in someone's little house on the prairie, very americana, cool.Sit down and there's servings of pickles and homemade potato chips at your table...hell yea! Those chips are yummy!We ordered the q3 which is your choice of two pulled meats + half a chicken or slab of ribs. We chose: pulled pork, brisket, and ribs.  Also ordered side orders of Mac n' Cheese, Cornbread, and fried green tomatoes. Pulled pork and brisket were pretty good- a bit dry- but add some sauce and it's a bit better and the rib meat fell right off the bone hell yea!  Their house-made sauces accompany your dinner and were nice to try: Original Mild, Spicy, Eastern North Carolina Vinegar and South Carolina Mustard Sauce.  I enjoyed the original, spicy, and put some vinegar on my pork yum.  Corn bread was served in a cast iron and came with honey butter- omg good.  Mac and cheese ""brulee"" was pretty yummy too and the fried green tomatoes were nice and hot and crispy, bite into them and warm and juicy- fantastic.  Oh can't forget their sweet tea, i love sweet tea!It was more than enough food for the two of us and we took leftovers back with us but not before we sprang for their seasonal dessert (apple pie): came in a cast iron pan, warm, oozie and vanilla ice cream on top.  Heaven."
Went here for a private event and they did a great job! I liked the brisket and the fried green tomatoes were SO damn good. I can't believe I'm from Texas and I've never had fried green tomatoes before. The fries were also excellent and I had to ask a friend to move them away from me so I stopped picking on them!The service was really great for our event. The waiters were really attentive and very friendly. Great place!
"The restaurant is very chic looking with a relaxed atmosphere. The wait staff was very friendly and informative.  They told of us of the crazy rewards that the BBQ Pitmaster & Owner Lee Ann has won on her ribs and how she won $10,000 for her mashed potato recipe! haha Needless to say, you can tell the wait staff is very into their job and knowledgeable of 'what's popular' amongst clientele and will gladly give feedback on their favorite dishes.We were pleasantly surprised with a starter/appetizer of bread and butter pickles and barbeque chips.  I thought the chips had a little too much seasoning on them, but nonethelesss... great touch! We ordered the Q3 which was a half slab of ribs and two pulled meats.  We chose pulled chicken, pulled pork and the baby back ribs.  Our sides consisted of the mac & cheese and the $10,000 dolla recipe mashed potatoes.  A side of cornbread with honey butter came with the meal as well.  The meal also comes with 4 of their homemade sauces: honey mustard, spicy bbq sauce, bbq sauce and something else.  I also ordered a coke, thinking it was a fountain drink.. but it was a coke in the old school coke bottle.  While I liked the 'classic' touch, there's no refills on the sodas, so that was disappointing.Soooo... here's my breakdown of what we ordered:-Back back ribs: BOMB.COM... literally fall of the bone style.-Pulled Chicken: Meh... too dry to be honest.-Pulled Pork: OMG... yassss! So so good.  Definitely my favorite part of this meal.  I consider myself somewhat of a pulled pork connoisseur and it was phenomenal! ;)-Mac & Cheese: I was soo excited for these, but very disappointed.  It looked so much better than it tasted.  Completely flavorless, in my opinion. -Mashed Potatoes: Excellent! Very good... not sure if they were $10k worthy, but still very good!-Cornbread: Dry. Not sweet enough for my taste.  The honey butter on top was good, however.-The sauces: Amazingg! I specifically loveddd the homemade spicy bbq sauce.  I like spicy things and it was the perfect amount of sweet and spice.  Delightful!In all, some of the items were hit or miss.  This hits were HITS though and the great service made me give this place 4 stars.Lastly, I thought it was a lovely touch... at the end of the meal the waiter comes with some warm folded wash rags and a half of a lemon.  The lemon serves to remove the stickiness of any bbq sauce or food on your fingers and the warm and toasty rag washes it all off.  It was refreshing change compared to the moist towelettes that most BBQ joints present to you.I'll definitely go back for more of my favorite items the next time I'm in Chitown!"
"Ok, before I start let me just say I love competed in BBQ circuits, & I've been smoking meats since I was 5; I realize I'm a tough critic on most BBQ joints. That said, the meat itself was good--not great-- but they did have some good sauces. I had the brisket platter & beans. Beans were pinto ranch style. The biggest issue for me was price--simply too much for smaller portions. 5 slices of brisket for $18? C'mon, add in some cornbread & taters or something. Also, the wait for the food took a while. I know Q can take a while, but they were even slower than normal. This is a good place for a date when you have time & money. Again, good texture & flavor to the meat (at new BBQ joints I always choose brisket to begin; if you can get that right, the rest should be good), but the price was not right...too upscale & Q needs to have some grit!"
"My boyfriend and I went here for Restaurant Week and were super excited!  Now, I will give Chicago Q credit where it's due.  I realize that Restaurant Week is probably every server in Chicago's least favorite week due to the high volume of crowds and people tipping less than they usually would.  Still, I don't find that to be an excuse to be sullen, negligent, and dismissive.  For the most part, the food was all really good.  The chips were amazing!  The hush puppies and ribs were great appetizers.  When our entrees arrived (pulled pork and brisket), they were cold which was a huge disappointment.  But both still had a lot of flavor and were very tender.  We also had the carrot cake and cookies (not sure what flavor the cookies were because our waitress neglected to provide any explanation, even though I saw other servers doing that for their tables).  To be honest, my biggest gripe is that our service sucked.  Our server- I think her name was Megan- just seemed like she hated life and/or us for being in her presence.  She was super negligent.  The busboys and food expeditors provided a higher caliber of service than she did.  I hope they got our tip- not our server- but I'm sure she took a cut.  Overall, I would try to get her attention and she would ignore me.  She would avoid looking at our table.  It was very difficult to get her to give us our check. Other servers cleared plates off of our table which was super nice of them, but where was Megan?  Why did it seem that everyone else in the restaurant valued our patronage more than our own server?Overall, I'd go back but hope not to get the same server.  Maybe she was having a bad day, but sheesh."
"I want to like this place more for the service and attention to detail. I can't in good conscience give more stars than 3 though because I'm disappointed in the food here. Yes, I said it, the bbq here needs some improvement. Five of us came in on Friday and we waited for the rest of our party to show up so those of us that were there went to the bar. Their whiskey selection was impressive and when I sked for a little bit of water the bartender gave me an eye dropper of their house distilled water. Nice touch, impressed so far.Our server, Shawn was awesome, quick with the chips and pickles and refills as we needed it. When we told him that we were thinking of sharing four entrees between the five of us. He not only let us know that it would be enough but he suggested that we add the mac and cheese as an extra side.The pulled pork was tasty, a lot like South Carolina style hash and which went well with the mustard sauce. The St. Louis Ribs were a good choice too with a slight sweetness to it and the vinegar sauce, which was something that was hard to find was also tasty. The chicken, well it was chicken and the spicy sauce made it better. I had such high hopes for the Kobe brisket, thinking that Kobe beef plus BBQ would be terrific but I found it terrible: rubbery, over done and just about inedible. I gave my share of it to the others and took an extra helping of ribs.Side wise I thought the mac and cheese was just okay while the 2 cornbreads were indistinguishable from each other. The slaw was pretty good and the dusted fries were also pretty tasty. Between the five of us with a good tip it came to around 30 bucks a person, which isn't too bad but I expected a lot better food wise, particularly from the brisket and the corn bread."
"Good gracious God I love this place. Such a classy American establishment built off of delicious BBQ and an interior that oozes of Southern hospitality. I love BBQ, and in my opinion, Q has some of the best Kobe beef and pulled pork in the city. My girlfriend and I love to come here during all hours. Brunch, an early dinner, or a pre-rage stomach-padding feast with friends - it doesn't matter.The Bourbon and Scotch drinks are a great way to start the night, especially after a big meal. You'll be full, but after crushing a few of those, you'll feel lighter in no time.. ready to hit the scene like an animal. Oh yea, service is great. No complaints. Chi-Q gets 5 from this guy."
"SUPER SLOW service, mediocre, overpriced BBQ. The hush puppies were not life changing as other reviews mentioned - pretty bland actually (couldn't find the cheddar anywhere). The watermelon salad was really a half-assed attempt at a gourmet side (a sprinkle of wilted herbs and a crumble of cheese seemed like an afterthought). The cornbread was dry with a tiny dab of butter on top - you call that honey butter cornbread?! The pulled pork was pretty good, but the sauces were below average at best. The blackberry sage refresher was the highlight of the meal, actually. Also did not appreciate being asked by multiple hostesses if we had a reservation. No, we don't. It's 3pm on a Sunday and your restaurant is mostly empty. Is that a problem?"
"For an award-winning restaurant, I was expecting a bit more. The food is good, but not great. The upscale atmosphere is a bit pretentious for BBQ food. And unfortunately, I found the ribs to be a little burnt."
"I'm not going to lie... I think this place is a little overrated.  With that said, my boyfriend and I still had an enjoyable experience here.We booked a table via Open Table around 6:15pm on a Friday night with no issues.  Upon being seated, we were given bread and butter pickles (bleh!) and their version of BBQ chips (delicious!).  It's nice that these came complimentary and gave you something to munch on right away.We ordered the blackened alligator as an appetizer and at first we thought it was pretty good.  However, as we kept eating it, we realized it tasted like spicy fishy chicken.  By the end, we were kind of grossed out and couldn't finish the plate.I ordered the pulled pork for my entree and while it had a good smokey flavor, it wasn't very moist.  I will say they give you a good size portion and the hand cut fries that come with it were great.  I also loved that they serve the pulled pork with four different sauces.  My boyfriend ordered a full slab of the ribs which he enjoyed but they were a bit pricey.Overall, 3 stars as it was a good (but not great or memorable) experience."
"Great BBQ, coming from someone who moved from Memphis, TN.Great food, even better chips to start with.No need for a reservation for brunch. We sat outside with our dog at our feet. Definitely get the Benedict Flight. For lunch/dinner, don't get cute and just order the awesome pulled pork or baby back ribs."
"Very good barbecue in Chicago. Ribs were tender and smokey. I did not like the barbecue sauce selection, but the ribs and brisket didn't need it."
"The service at q was AMAZING. The guy was friendly, knowledgeable and generous - three characteristics that make up a perfect server. I wish I knew his name so that I could go back and sit in his section!q is in a house. The great room has a bar and fireplace  in it, but there are a few rooms off of it for more intimacy. We sat at a high table in the great room where we could see out of the large front windows but also had a nice view of the television.Our amazing server gave us a bowl of chips and pickles. There were a TON of pickles in that bowl. It was as if they dumped out a jar of their own homemade pickles just for us. I was in love. I love pickles. THEN, I saw a garlic clove (I like pickled garlic) and I offered to split it with M (she declined) so I popped the whole thing in my mouth. My mouth and throat and stomach were all on fire and I felt like throwing up. My wonderful server brought me a glass of gingerale to make me feel better.I was much better by the time our food came. I got the q burger and M got some ribs (I don't remember which kind). She was also presented with four different sauces for her ribs. I used her sauces for my fries. She said that the ribs (without any sauce) reminded her of the ribs my dad makes. She loves my dad's ribs and thinks that they surpass all restaurants, but she expected more from the ribs from q for some reason.I ordered my burger medium rare. It DEFINITELY came rare. As in, the meat inside was not just red but kinda raw. I liked the flavors and thought it was delicious, but I thought the texture of the meat on my tongue was weird. It was soft and slimy. Besides the service and the classy atmosphere, q has an enviable selection of Bourbons. Our server even offered to give M a sample of one of them (she politely declined). We determined that q is a good neighborhood place we can go for good food and drinks in a nice setting."
"Good things come to those who wait. And that's what I did. I waited for the dessert. I exhibited self control and could not have been more pleased. Yay me! Woohoo parts of the experience.Dessert- See pic #185. The strawberry infused cheesecake. Sheer perfection. Light, airy with a graham cracker crust. Now, they didn't try to reinvent the wheel here. However, they flawlessly pulled off a dessert staple. It's secret? sour cream. Yes sour cream in the cheesecake. Save room for it. In addition, the expresso ice cream covered in brittle. It's huge. The size of a brick. Almost. Order this after the cheesecake. Desserts and coffee. Best part of my meal.  Chips and pickles. It's unique. It's memorable. It's flavorful. Thumbs up. Now for the meh, thumb down/not upThe hush puppies. Just skip. Your stomach only has so much space. Fill it with something better. The bloodies. Too spicy for my taste. The corn bread. Dry, not very sweet. The meat. Prefer it to be mixed with a sauce and cooked. Cole slaw. I've had better. One thumb is way up. The other is wobbly. See what your thumbs reveal. According to my calculations- this equals 3 stars."
"As I sit here writing this review a single tear escapes me, rolls down my cheek and slides into the corner of my mouth....wait a tick? What's that? OMG it's a touch of BBQ spice and sauce left on the corner of my mustache after my visit to Chicago q over a week ago. I can taste is all so clearly now, and as the warm memories of my lunch time experience wash over me let me regale you with the tale of the little ""q"" that could.Ahhh, I remember it like it was last Friday, at 2 pm, sometime after a Black Friday morning of punching infants and shoving the elderly to get the last $50 leather jacket on special at Macys. OH WAIT... that's EXACTLY how it all happened (sans the punching and shoving)! Weary shopping legs and a reservation made in advance found me in this elegant spot located just north-west of the top of the MagMile. Walking in I was greeted not only by a friendly front of house staff but a rustic COlonial decoR. I'm Not a design person bUt the best way I Can describe the interiOr was: an uPper class southern home accented wIth white finishings And warm wood trim. Upon being seated we met our new friend, our server, whose jovial personality and high knowledge of both BBQ and COcktails pRoved to be very helpful as we perUsed their multiple menus. After viewing the COcktail menu I decided on the Bear Hug which was the love child of TemPleton Rye, CInnAmon Simple Syrup, Lemon Juice, and Ginger Beer - outstanding.Soon after COcktails aRrived we were preseNted with complimentary in hoUse made BBQ Chips and sweet pickle slices (alsO made in house). I was a tad under the weather (and yes still drinking mid day cocktails) so the smell of PIckles wAs not pleasing to my compromised sense of smell, however the BBQ chips were something heaven sent. Quite possibly the best chip I've ever had!For my main course, and after much deliberation, I settled on the St.Louis style Competition Ribs #foodporn. Our server had won me over at Ribs, sold me at St. Louis but basically proposed food marriage to me when he described how the competition STL ribs, had a tiny bit of tug on them compared to the traditional fall off the bone baby back (I felt no tug - so tender) and that the award winning BBQ chef used a mopping technique to sauce up these bad boys..... drool, foodrection, and I'm spent! (For those interested the ribs and I are set to be married this spring)I paired my rib-tacular rib-gasm with a side of baked MacNcheese which came served in a piping hot cast iron skillet to my table. The portion sizes were unreal and far too much for one such as I to finish in one sitting. Our server won points again when he said there was no shame in this and that their ribs tasted even better several hours later, cold, smothered in sauce. Good sir you are speaking my language. Cold Pizza and Cold Ribs are pretty much replacements for physical intimacy.Also of note was their BBQ sauce selection that was brought to the table to sauce up your meat at your own discretion. Clear winner was the spicy and original recipe with the mustard being a close second. Vinegar was not for me. With all this love for the ""little q"" going on my one criticism comes at the expense of the Mac N Cheese. I found it to be a tad dry, bland and had far too much bread-crum on top. Maybe it's a Canadian thing but less is more with MNC.Other than that one tiny stumble this was a fantastic experience all the way around. I did get to try my friends pulled pork and was also floored by that as well. Amazing! Astounding! Ahhhhhhh LOVED. Time to shave my Movember stache off and say goodbye to the last fleeting taste of Chicago q BBQ that still resides on my upper lip.**Bonus points if you can find 3 hidden cornucopia's in this review"
"We were in today for a company holiday lunch. I am not a fan of BBQ but I didn't get to choose the place and since my whole team LOVES BBQ so off we went. We sat in a private room in the front of the joint. It had 30 ft tall ceilings and so much charm. The guys were happy because they got to watch Sports Center a bit while we ate. We ordered a ton of appetizers; hushpuppies (super yummy!), a shrimp thing (I'm allergic so I passed), the corn salad (also good) and the wings (amazing!) They had an assortment of sliders, brisket & pulled pork...I had the best burger that I've ever had in my life. (No bbq for me). The ""side"" of cornbread was HUGE...almost a meal itself. I shared mine with my coworker and we still couldn't finish it. All in all the food was amazing. Everyone loved what they ordered and I will definitely be back. Hopefully I'll get the cute ginger waiter again. We even shared in a ginger bonding moment over the fact that we don't have souls"
"Hello Q!We stumbled in from my friend's place down the block around 11:30 on a Saturday. It's a bummer they don't open until 11. I loved the pickles and chips that were brought out before our meal. If it's a nice day, they have a lovely patio with great people watching. I went for a brunch item - sweet potato hash with eggs and biscuits. It was different but in a good way. The thing to get for brunch is the benedict sampler but I wasn't that hungry. Decent bloody mary - not the best I've ever had. I'd probably go with something off their wine list next time."
"Torn between 3 and 4 stars, but sadly, it was the bread and butter pickles and potato chips that pushed me over. I mean, it SHOULD be the BBQ that does it, right? And the BBQ was good, but I could pretty much take it or leave it. With the smattering I tasted, the pulled pork was dry, the kobe beef was decent, but the pulled chicken ended up being the star. Chicken...the star? Yeah yeah yeah. Perhaps it was an off night. I enjoyed the sauce options given, a sort of ""choose your own adventure"" if you will, but then again, I don't want to be reliant on sauces to cover up mediocre meat. However, I'm standing by the sides to bump this place up to 4 stars. Holy giant hunk of buttery corn bread. If I could make a meal of you and bread and butter pickles, I would. Pair that with attentive, friendly service, a cozy space, and fantastic bar area, and this place could grow on me."
"Had a delicious restaurant week lunch! I went with the dry rub wings, baby back ribs, sweet cornbread, and cookies. We also got the cheddar-bacon hush puppies and brisket. I was absolutely stuffed by the end! Everything was smoked to perfection and the sauces were such an array of flavors from across the country. I must admit that the hush puppies were probably my favorite. The chipotle mayo dipping sauce that came along with them was divine!!! The bacon oatmeal cookie was pretty darn good too."
Best BBQ place in Chicago.  Go with the kobe beef brisket as well as the Mac and Cheese.  I enjoy the outdoor seating and they have a good amount of beers (bottled) available for selection.
"Here again on a Sunday night and again it was quiet. We sat in the bar area which has about a dozen circular tables for four and a few TV screens so we could watch the game. Half rack of St. Louis ribs and a flight of bourbon made for a great evening. Our waiter was great and quite knowledgable with the bourbon and beer selections. The atmosphere was great, food was delicious, and unfortunate we were too full to try the desserts. What a great restaurant. And with a friendly staff and good food, you can't go wrong."
"This is the fourth BBQ restaurant I've been to in Chicago, and I would say I wasn't impressed.The bbq dishes were underwhelming, and I definitely do not recommend the watermelon salad - it had a bad sour taste to it.The cornbread was the highlight of the evening - highly recommend the honey cornbread!"
"The food was really nice, but the decor and the staff were superb. A conscientious waiting staff that knows the difference between being overtly ""fake"" friendly and being  professional and observant. The place has 3 different areas to eat that are all subtly different and spacious, but still hold the general southern charm/decor. The food is cheap for any area considering the atmosphere and quality."
"In order to try a taste of everything, we ordered the BBQ flight, half slab of St. Louis and Mac & cheese.  The verdict: Mac & cheese...just alright..  wish it was more creamy..Pulled pork...not so bad, good flavor and not dry. Pulled chicken...pretty dry and boring.Kobe brisket...please take these away.. chewy and bland.  I was waiting for melt in your mouth and I couldn't wait to swallow the piece so I could eat the ribs! St. Louis ribs...highlight of the meal!I loved the spicy sauce out of the four sauces.  I'm glad they give you a selection to choose from..  In addition, I think the pickles and chips were a nice touch for starters.  They are both free and unlimited.  The pickles are not your average sour pickles, they are crunchy, lightly sweet with a kick.  It's a perfect contrast to all that meat.  Overall, it's not a place place to eat at..... just not the best BBQ I've ever had."
"Hands down the best grill chicken I have ever had.And price is more than reasonable considering the quality, the portion and the location."
On a weekend trip to Chicago we decided to use Yelp to help us find a delicious place to eat... and Yelp pulled through!!! Chicago Q. We walked the mile and found a cute clean looking white building that looked like it belonged in the country side on England. After being seated they brought us delicious homemade bread and butter pickles and homemade BBQ chips! Delicious! The wait staff was so attentive and brought us more refills then we could handle. Luckily we arrived early enough that they were still serving brunch so of course we ordered a bloody mary and a mimosa.When it came to dinner we all ordered something with Kobe Beef. It was perfect! I got the Kobe Beef brisket that come with 4 sauces and a huge hunk of Delicious corn bread.Needless to say everything at this place was fantastic and I would and have recommended this to friends visiting Chicago.
"Our server was Devon and you could tell he really knew what he was doing. I came here with my family to celebrate a birthday and they were very accommodating, very helpful, and they made us feel welcome! Not to mention the food which was by far amazing! In addition to our dinner, We ordered some of the sides to share amongst the table and it was the perfect amount of food. I would recommend this place anyone looking for great food and an overall good experience"
"Service was much better on my last visit, and for the first time, I expanded my horizons and tried out the kobe chopped brisket sammich instead of my usual pulled pork.  It was juicy, mouth-wateringly great meat, but a little fatty.  I highly reco the jalapeno cheddar cornbread!  Another new dish I tried was the braised green side.  Yes, it was $7, but it's enough to last 3 meals.  Mmm, makes me want to eat veggies more.I can't wait to come back to try out something from the dessert menu."
"My husband raved about Chicago Q for at least 6 months before I finally caved in and gave it a try. I was not at all disappointed. Our reservation was for 8pm, we got there early, probably 7:45. Our hostess was gracious and said we would probably be seated in 10 minutes. And we were. While we waited, we found standing room at the bar. The kid was impressed that they have Abita Root Beer. The husband was happy that they had Templeton Rye. I was busy taking in the ambiance - pretty cool, but in a modern cozy kind of way. The place is bigger than it looks like from the outside.Initially, we made the reservation because of restaurant week, but we decided to order off the regular menu. No regrets. The homemade chips were delightful. I was not sure about the pickles but they were good. Our starter was the cheddar bacon hush puppies - so good. Entrees were pulled pork with sweet cornbread, pulled chicken with fries and brisket with jalepeno cornbread. And an order of mac and cheese to share. Enjoyed everything but really loved the mac and cheese. So nice to get very full plates of fresh, hot food. The tray of 4 sauces that were brought with the entrees was a nice touch. Much classier than plastic sauce containers.We did not really find what we were looking for on the dessert menu, which considering how full we were, was okay. We shared a carrot cake which was loved by one person and okay to the others. I think one has to be a fan of carrot cake to really appreciate a good carrot cake. Service was attentive but not overbearing. We never felt rushed. Valet parking was not too obscene at $12.00."
The atmosphere/service is amazing and the food is even better! The chips and pickles that they start you with are delicious and the BBQ and sides are the best in the city.
Great classy BBQ joint!
"I went here for brunch with a group of friends and can't say a bad thing about it. The service was great, the food was amazing and the atmosphere was very comfortable and pleasant. When you arrive they bring you a bowl full of homemade kettle chips and homemade bread and butter chips. That was just the beginning of the amazing food. You can't go wrong with any of eggs benedict, most of us ended up getting a flight so we could try all of them. To compete our experience they brought out hot towels with lemon. I can't wait till I'm back in Chicago to go there again!"
"Best ribs ever!  Better than smoque. We both did the restaurant week menu, however, I'd skip the appetizers and go straight for the BBQ. The ribs were so meaty and tender. The fries were yummy.   Will def go back whenever I crave great ribs."
"Q is simply amazing, what else can I say? The food is outstanding, and very reasonably-priced for the quality. Portions are big too. The drinks are good, and the service is even better. I've been here a handful of times, and have never had any bad experiences. I honestly don't like giving 5-star reviews, because perfection is unattainable... but q comes pretty darn close. If you enjoy BBQ, or a nice dining experience in general, you do not want to pass up Chicago q."
"Fantastic food, try the pulled pork and watermelon salad however our server made us feel as if we were a complete inconvenience. Service is chilled out so best not to be in a hurray. Great food and building, disappointing attitude."
"I've been wanting to try Q for at least a year now and finally made it this past Saturday. We had a party of 7 for a friend's birthday and had a reservation. We were seated immediately upon arrival and were taken upstairs to the wine room. Our table was large and spacious and the pickles and BBQ chips everyone raves about we re waiting for us on the table. Needless to say the evening was off to a great start. We started the meal with the bacon hush puppies. So delicious! The sauce that came with them was spicy and delicious. When the waiter tried to take it away we kept them to use as dip with our meal! A variety of food among the table. I had the brisket sandwich with French fries. The brisket was incredibly tender, definitely a winning dish. There were four sauces brought out and I was a big fan of mixing the mustard and vinegar sauces, a killer combination both with the brisket and the delicious fresh cut fries. I also sampled a friend's pulled chicken and it was fantastic. Pulled chicken is much harder to do than pulled pork (in my opinion) and Q pulled this off fabulously. It was especially good with the spicy BBQ sauce. While the brisket and chicken were the only things I tried everyone was beyond pleased with their meals and couldn't rave enough about them. For dessert we ordered carrot cake for the birthday girl. Our server also brought out free cookies and milk to celebrate. Everyone adored the carrot cake but the cookies were not so great (who cares though they were FREE). All in all the experience at Q is one of the best I've had dining out in Chicago."
"Pickles and BBQ chips galore.  I would just head over for that.Standard ribs and pulled pork, sauces are amazing.  Especially the vinegar based choice.  Monster cornbread which was very good.  Tried the sweet one but, next time will go for savory."
Great Food! Great Service! Very nice space. We will be back
Not bad but there are better bbq places in Chicago. The crab cakes were delicious!
THE BREAD AND BUTTER PICKLES ARE CRACK. And they sat our 4 turned 5 top on a busy Saturday without a roll of the eye which I know is absolutely a pain in the ass and I absolutely appreciate. Service overall was stellar.
"Naperville Ribfest .. never again... SERIOUSLY!  Once you come here, BBQ anywhere else is a waste of your time and money.   I have eaten BBQ in the south where BBQ to them is like a hotdog to us Chicagoans, yet this place is still better than anything I have had down there.  I came here with a big group of 18, 12 adults, 6 kids for my monthly foodie feasting with my closest friends for a Sunday lunch.  Due to our large group, we asked for one of their private rooms, which ultimately was the best decision even though we had to make a $300 minimum, which with 12 adults, would not have been a problem.  The room was set up with a bunch of tables put together to form one huge one and they had a flat screen hanging on the wall for the guys and their football obsession.   On the table are bowls of the tastiest homemade chips that I have ever tasted.  They use the same rub on their pork as they do on their chips.  WOW and their pickles... for some reason they were just so darn good; sweet, crunchy, and delicious.  They take our drink orders and we peruse the menu and come to a dish that is $305, no joke ... it's the whole pork shoulder.  AH HA .. we all were on the same wave length and quickly start deliberating on whether the 11 of us carnivores are willing to take down the pork shoulder beast, we surely did and I would have made the decision again .. no regrets people.  To top it off, Chef Lee Ann Whippen herself comes out and shreds the shoulder with massive bear claws (see pics that I have posted).  She is known for slaying the BBQ dragon, Bobby Flay on his on show Throwdown! with Bobby Flay in Season 4.  Coleslaw, Kobe beef baked beans, cornbread and pretzel roll buns all come with this amazing entree.  The pork just melts in your mouth and with the four different sauces that you can try, it was just simply the most amazing BBQ I have ever tasted.  We also ordered the fried green tomatoes and the hush puppies.  They were delicious as well, but definitely not the stars of the show.  They also had a kids menu for our little tykes, their meal came with a big cookie at the end ... what kid wouldn't want that??Service was 5 stars as well, they were very attentive and helpful.   I would come back here in a heartbeat if anyone wants to go eat BBQ!!YIKES, I was drooling writing this review!!  HA"
"A great place for some good barbecue! We tried the BBQ chicken wings and the brisket. It was full of flavor, more like finger licking good. The corn bread is a must. They offered 4 different types of BBQs. Btw, the BBQ chips they offer in the beginning are a hit!"
4 stars for the baby back ribs & room decor3 stars for mac and cheese & ladies at the door (they were friendly)2 service- not all that great1 star for hush puppies & corn bread -  both VERY salty and DRY
"Solid BBQ! You just have to pay more than typical BBQ due to the prime location. However the scene is good, they accommodate groups, and the food is pretty good.They offer a wide variety of meats and sides. I went with a group of six, and the table split a lot of the different meats and sides. I think the cornbread was an overwhelming favorite (it's HUGE) as were the ribs (fall off the bone good).I would definitely go back, and highly recommend for a group of 6-10."
"""Upscale barbecue.""  An oxymoron, in my opinion, and one of which I'm just not fond.I arrived at q on a Saturday night for a birthday celebration (very small, just a group of 4).  We we were seated quickly, but for the rest of the night, service was very slow.  I had a half slab and corn bread which arrived after what was probably close to 45 minutes.  As I neared the end of my meal, I was neither impressed nor offended by the meat, the sauce, or the corn bread.  I've had equivalent BBQ for half the price and better BBQ for similar cost, but without the pretension.  If I'm looking to have pork slathered in sauce, I want to be able to bury my face in it without feeling uncomfortable.  Not that I do behave a slob, but why not have that option?Twin Anchors and Smoque both offer better food and what I would consider a superior place to enjoy said food, but if you're after BBQ with ambiance, q might be your best and really only option.  I find q overpriced, but given the neighborhood and the trendy feel they are striving to achieve, I understand the prices.  I don't hate the place, but ""meh"" perfectly captures my sentiment."
"Chicago q is in my neighborhood so I was really hoping to fall in love with this place. Unfortunately I wasn't really impressed.My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch during the late afternoon on a Sunday. We were seated promptly but had to wait to be greeted by our server. We ordered a couple beers off of their menu and after that they brought BBQ chips and bread & butter pickles, which were both good.Fifteen minutes passed by and we were still beer-less. Our server finally came by and informed us that they were out of the beer we had requested and asked us if we wanted something else. After waiting so long we skipped on the alcoholic beverages. No big deal except our server was unfriendly and inattentive.We ordered  the pulled pork sandwich and the smoked corn, black bean and avocado salad. The pork was good but the salad unfortunately came without the avocado, one of the main reasons why I ordered the salad.Our server came around after a couple minutes and I told her the salad came without the avocado and asked her for a side so I could throw it in. She looked confused but said she would get me some. Another 15 minutes passed and I finally had my avocado.I would have been fine with all of this if the service wasn't so slow and our server wasn't so unpleasant. The restaurant wasn't busy at all so I was really surprised by how long we had to wait for everything."
"Bachelorette party from Hades. Girls crying. Girls yelling. Girls spitting in fake plants at the airport (alcohol involved). The definition of a shit show on wheels. Lo and behold, Chicago q. I had my fingers-crossed that this sure-bet restaurant would save the day. I've always had a way for blaming frowny faces on empty stomachs, so I was hoping q's homemade bbq chips and house sweet pickles (crazy-good) would start steering this party in the right direction. Ya know what else makes people smile? A damn good Blood Mary. Please, oh please, waiter - pour some alcohol down these unhappy souls' throats! My mother is the Queen of Bloody Marys and I, well, I'm not a huge fan but q's smokey/meaty tomato kick-in-the-ass Mary is an exception. It may not have been what the group needed, but it sure as hell was what I needed at the moment. Our waiter handled our group very well. It seemed to be difficult to keep everyone at the table between the bathroom stall crying sessions and phone calls to home outside the restaurant. This social/company side of this sacred meal was nothing like I had envisioned it when I originally chose q for our dinner stop, but the food was exquisitely predictable. My kobe beef sandwich was piled high with juicy, lean chunks of meat and left me wishing I wasn't from out of town so I could party the night away with a to-go box in hand.  So, maybe we weren't able to salvage the remainder of the evening, but we were able to fill the tummies of a bbq-loving bunch with juicy meats and bloody Marys. One more note - q is quite possibly the prettiest BBQ restaurant I've ever been to. It's like a worldly farm boy - hard to come by, but magic when you do."
"OMG.  I went here after a visit to the Chicago Surgical Museum with my friend and classmate, we were starving and certainly came to the right place!  First off, they start you off with these homemade seasoned chips and buttered dill pickles which I could honestly make a meal out of by themselves.  I ordered a combo plate of ribs and pulled pork with a side of jalapeno cornbread.  WOW!  Each serving was out of this world!  The ribs came precut and with 4 different sauces to choose from.  Personally, I loved the spicy and mild.  The pulled pork was incredible too, I wanted to do an experiment with the gigantic piece of cornbread they give you to try and make a sandwich with it, but I was afraid I would make a fool of myself. Hahaha!  Great place guys, if you're ever hungry and in the Gold Coast area, hit it up!"
Probably some of the best pulled pork I've ever had... Even better than the salt lick in Texas. Great location and amazing food. And the spicy BBQ potato chips are a great appetizer. The whole experience was awesome.
"I love Chicago Q! The food is great and the service is on-point. I gave it 4 stars because I lived in Alabama for 5 years and nothing will ever beat true Bama BBQ but this place is close!Also, I have hosted multiple corporate dinners here and they always get positive feedback. They have a good variety of private and semi-private spaces for different size groups."
"I should have written this review months ago!  I went to the Chicago q during ""Restaurant Week"" and I have been a fan every since.First the service was great the waiter was just so nice and I always like when I get a waiter or waitress who doesn't seem like they are getting upset that I am asking a lot of questions.I couldn't decide if I wanted St. Louis or Baby Back ribs and to be honest I really didn't know the difference well our waiter explained the different cuts and he smiled and asked did we have any more questions.While we were there he didn't hover over us but he did come back from time to time to make sure everything was okay with me and my friend...I loved that!!!When the food came out it was hot, it was presented on the plate like a Masterpiece and I absolutely loved it!The serving were big enough that two people could eat from one plate so my friend and I ended up taking a big doggie bag home and the leftovers were just as amazing!Now, the price is on the higher side but as I said the servings are enough for 2 so if you are on a budget you can try a few things with a friend and share...trust you will get full!!!The mac n' cheese was one of the best I have tasted at any restaurant I have been in and I am being honest I wasn't expecting much and I got the surprise of my life it was well worth the 6.75 that we paid because we got 4 servings from the order.The beef brisket melted in your mouth and it was an explosion of flavors that made my tongue and my feet do the happy dance...that is always a good thing.The ribs were tender, the cornbread was delicious and I am a happy camper!!!I hope to go back for my birthday next month!To top it off was the wonderful and cute dessert my friend got which was milk and cookie, I got the key lime pie...now to be honest the pie wasn't my favorite I like a more dense key lime pie instead of creamy but if you prefer creamy then this is the pie for you.All in All it was a great experience and I would recommend Chicago q to everyone!!"
The Kobe beef ribs are fantastic (when they are available). Half chicken is also solid.
"Don't waste your time trying to book a party here. I wanted to do a pre-bachelor party dinner here but have yet to hear back from them. I first submitted an inquiry on their website, then have called 3 times. Each time they said their special events coordinator would call, but never did.Update: I was finally contacted by the event coordinator, she was very apologetic and informed me she never got the original inquiry."
"Chicago Q high-jacked my lunch plans!  No lie...  My wife and I were heading to another nearby establishment for lunch, when we smelled BBQ.  Luckily, we figured out where the wonderful aroma had originated and payed our first visit to Chicago Q.My first tendency when visiting a new BBQ joint is to order a massive meat sampler entree that results is overindulgent meat sweats and subsequent regret.  Thus, we decided to share some appetizers and sides to get a good feel for the restaurant's offerings.   Here is the lowdown:Pickles & Potato Chips: They are free and simply amazing.  Wow!House-Cut Fries: Crispy wonderful deliciousness!BBq Flight: Enough for a meal, comes with excellent cornbread, must order!Smoked Dry-Rubbed Wings: Ridiculously flavorful!Bruleed Macaroni and Cheese:  Cheesy heaven!The restaurant has a great atmosphere and excellent service.In the end, we left happy and very full. I would return tomorrow...."
"This is not a BBQ restaurant, it's a BBQ themed restaurant. If you like good BBQ, you won't like this place. If you aren't religious about BBQ it's fine. Ribs look like they came out of a rib machine, brisket and pork are lean and bland."
"This is more of a 3.5 star spot to me. They have some really good dishes - like the Kobe Beef ribs and the cornbread - but many are just okay. Entrees can be a bit pricey for BBQ but you're definitely paying for a nice, date-appropriate ambiance and excellent service. The bar also has a very nice selection of beers and wines. I've been a number of times and I'd go again, but not very often as I feel like there are certain places that do certain entrees better for less money."
"This is such a great place to get BBQ. It is more upscale, but a very good. Skip the mac and cheese."
"Excellent hush puppies! Somehow they've been slammed by previous yelpers but I would disagree mightily. They coat the little suckers with their BBQ Rub that gives them a singing taste with the accompanied dip... I strongly recommend!I went with the BBQ option for lunch with two meats... ribs and pulled pork. The pork was a little fatty but the ribs were tasty! Definitely full of smoke and huge in size! I couldn't even get remotely close to finishing them in one visit. The sauces on the side were good, but I wish that they gave us a little more serving than what was provided to us."
"I wish I could give negative stars to this place. I'd give it negative 100. My husband and I ordered its delivery. Not only they forgot to give us coleslaw as side and the sauce that's supposed to come with the rib, the worst part is that my husband got food poisoning after that! He still couldn't eat any solid food.  It's either his rib was under-cooked, or the pickle we paid $5 for (which by the way, only had less than 10 pieces in it) was spoiled. For a place with such establishment, I cannot believe this happened. Will. Never. Be. Back."
"Chicago ""q""???? more like Chicago ""x""...*cross* this one of your list of ""must eats in chicago""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! jk it was pretty good i guess, it should be more like Chicago ""y""....as in ""y"" havent you eaten here yet !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!! !"
"I do not like giving out 3 stars because it does not help the reader when making a choice to go to a place...and I was really on the fence for Chicago q...so I decided to bring in simple math.  I made a list of everything I experienced and gave it a 5 to 1 stars and then divided it by the number of categories.  Drum Roll Please....Chicago q came up with 3.88235294 Stars!!!  I told you I used some math.  I will break down my categories that brought me to that number.(score - category - description)5 - Service - Our waiter Brandon was so cool and laid back...he never rushed us, in fact, we were eating dinner for like 3 hours.5 - Decor/Comfort - It was really nice in here. We were sitting under the giant light well which gave us some nice natural light. The chairs were cushy too and that's why we sat for three hours...we didn't want to leave.5 - Company - There is nothing like having a great dinner with a coworker and friend!5 - BBQ chips - They were really good and a nice free treat.4 - Bread & Butter Pickles - I don't even like Bread and Butter Pickles but these were really good. 5 - Four Sauces - Okay all of the sauces were so good. My favorite was the spicy one with the pepper flakes floating on top.5 - Pulled Pork - It was really good...it was my favorite meat that we had on the table.2 - Beef Brisket - It seemed uninspired to me. My friend loved it and it was his favorite.1 - Pulled Chicken - Really boring and not very tasty.  We both agreed that this was our least favorite meat on the table.2 - Corn Bread - It was just dry. I love corn bread and I was not a fan of what we were served plus we were given one small piece of butter on top of 3 pieces of corn bread. I needed like a bucket of butter to make it taste good.5 - Hush Puppies - Put cheddar and bacon in a round ball and throw it in the deep fryer, then it better be good!!! The spicy dipping sauce was also really good too.5 - Arugula, Spinach, Bacon, Poached Egg Salad - This was one of the more creative salads I have had and it was really good too. I would not have this as a special salad but move it to the permanent menu.5 - Baked Beans - These were a meal in themselves...I am quoting my friend, Peter W...I have to give credit where credit is due. My wife who tried leftovers asked if she could just walk in and get the baked beans. The giant pieces of beef really set these baked beans apart from anyone else.1 - Award Winning Baby Back Ribs - I know that these ribs have received an award but I do not know why...maybe the same love did not go into our rack that we received as the rack that one the ribbon.  I am sad to say this but I make better ribs at home.  I think the dry rub was nice on the outside but I was not happy with the finished product of the meat.  It took a couple of days for me to really think about the ribs.2 - Key Lime Pie - The crust was amazing but the filling they made was like a  whipped topping for Lemon Meringue.  It was light and airy and did not even have a lime taste to it.  I am a huge fan of Key Lime Pie and I would recommend you take this off of the specials because the filling is not that special.  This was a real letdown.5 - Seasonal Four Berries served warm with Ice Cream - This was the star of the show.  I normally do not even like this dish but I was blown away by it.  Everything was so fresh and good...this needs to come off of the specials and be on the everyday menu.So that is how I came up with my rating...I had to bring math into this because I was really going to issue my first 3 star review and I couldn't do it.  Some additional comments about the evening. The service was amazing.  Brandon was great and he even put up with all of my questions and jokes.  This place is like fine dinning BBQ. If you have been to a BBQ place you usually place your order at the front window, grab a seat and wait for your name to be called.  This place is the complete opposite of that.The one thing I didn't like was that nothing was hot when it was served to us.  Maybe I do not know anything about BBQ but I would have liked something to be hot.  Every time we placed our order, our food arrived in under 2 minutes...I know that it is BBQ and it was cooked hours before but it would have been nice to have warm food that seemed to take a little longer to get once we placed the order.  I know call me crazy!!!I am not sure if I would come back here but if I did then I would get the pulled pork sandwich and drown it in the spicy BBQ sauce.  I would also add on an order of those baked beans.Also this place does not look like a BBQ place from the street.  In fact, I have been going by here in a car for the last 10 months and I had no idea this place was BBQ.  I thought it was some expensive french restaurant.  I do find it weird that you can not even smell the BBQ outside like you can when you go near any other BBQ joint.  So I was really surprised, when I read about this place on Yelp a few weeks ago!"
"An easy 5 stars, Chicago q has done the seemingly impossible by combining down-home style BBQ, craft cocktails, and an uptown setting. Make sure to get a reservation here, things get busy early on but you can easily have a few drinks at the bar while you wait for a table. Come to Chicago q hungry, as you will want to order everything on the menu. I would recommend the q3, to split between two people (at least!). The q3 is your choice of one pulled meat (get the pork), brisket, and a rack of ribs. For sides get the poblano cornbread, Kobe baked beans, and/or the mashed potatoes, all of which are beyond delicious. The four different sauces are out of this world good. I combined all of them, but liked the Dijon sauce the best. I have to say, the pickles and chips served prior to dinner were my favorite thing at Chicago q. Eaten together, they are a little piece of sweet n' salty heaven. Although we didn't save any room for dessert, the menu looked good, especially the milk and cookies with bourbon chocolate milk. Speaking of bourbon, check out the cocktails here for sure. I loved the Simpleton, with it's spiced rum and cinnamon it was the perfect drink for a frigid night. To be honest, I wasn't sure about trying barbecue in Chicago, but Chicago q blew my mind and I will certainly be back for more deliciousness."
"This restaurant has a little identity thing it needs to work out. The interior is that of a fine steakhouse or upscale eatery. It's modern, cool, urban, and elegant. And the food is BBQ so yay! But it's pretty average. Nothing to write home about anyway. The chips and pickles on the table are very good. The hush puppies were alright, a little heavy for my taste. The pulled pork and fries were pretty average. The cinnamon ice cream was not good at all but the vanilla was heavenly.The service was hit or miss which dampened the meal for me. The price for the prix fixe lunch was very good ($15 for 3 courses). I would come back here though I wish Chicago Q would step up their food game."
standard food does not match the very nice interior design. Ribs were lame... Service was good.
"Excellent bbq. all BBQ dishes are excellent. Chicken is very tender, juicy and smoked to perfection. Brisket is very very tender. The ribs are superb. When the kobe beef brisket chili is in season, I always order a bowl.  It is excellent. Cole slaw is excellent and a great side dish to the BBQ. Braised greens are not the best compared to the great bbq.  Asparagus with mushrooms was excellent. Seasonal veggies usually really good. Desserts are really really good. Brunch is very unique. Service is excellent. Atmosphere is great and in a great neighborhood. I eat here 2-3 times a month. Most of the other BBQ restaurants in Chicago can't compare to this restaurant. Try the BBQ flight!"
"A chic-looking restaurant. The bread and butter pickles chips-freebies are great! We're a group of 5 and all enjoyed their meals. After we stuffed ourselves, here comes my fave Bourbon (so far) The Bookers...and everything just went perfect from there :)"
"Great experience at Chicago Q. I didn't read the reviews/info closely enough and thought it was a casual take-out place like Smoque - so I was pleasantly surprised at the snazzy decor and formal table service.  I had the Prix Fixe lunch menu. Hush puppies were decent. Pulled pork was excellent - loved both BBQ sauces. Definitely recommended. Chips and pickles were both great, as others have mentioned - and I normally hate pickles.It was interesting to read that many people had bad experience with their wait staff. My waiter was great, but the food runner was so/so - he dropped off my pulled pork without explaining what the 4 sauces were until I asked him.I'd go back again, but for a date night rather than weekday lunch."
"I don't even know where to begin with Chicago q.  I live right down the street and I have been wanting to come here since they first opened.  Finally came on Sunday with 3 other people.  We got so much food we needed to be rolled out of there!Each table gets complimentary house made chips and marinated pickle slices!  We went through a couple bowls of each - so tasty!!For starters, we had the bbq flight inclusive of pulled chicken, pulled pork and chopped beef brisket with cornbread and 4 different BBQ sauces.  This is cheap and a large portion of meat so you can taste each kind and decide which you want as your main meal.  I suggest this for a small group.  They also had a special salad for the day which was awesome.  it was topped with bacon, frisee, tomatoes, crouton and a poached egg in an awesome dressing.  For our main meals, I had the sliced brisket with fries, my boyfriend had the pulled pork with fries, my brother had the chopped brisket sandwich with coleslaw and my mom had the pulled pork with jalopeno corn bread.  We all shared eachothers food and everything was amazing.  We also shared a side of mac n cheese which was really good.We had so much food and even all brought home leftovers - a lot!!The price isn't too bad for the amount and quality of food.  I would love to go back and dine outside when the temp goes down a bit.  Love this place!"
"We live just a few blocks away and I've been smelling their bbq for MONTHS! Having heard about the smoked oysters event, we came for July 4th weekend. Turns out they'd stopped having smoked oysters (doesn't that sound good though?!) but we stayed for dinner anyway.Kobe brisket, half rack of St. Louis ribs, fries, cornbread. Thought it'd be too much but we finished every bite. AND we munched on a bunch of their complimentary chips and pickles too! Everything was very good though perhaps not amazing.. but many components were a nice extra touch -- the free apps obviously, the spicy bbq sauce and the south carolina mustard, the water glasses constantly being refilled. And how our waiter changed our order a bit so we got more food for the same price!Restaurant is a little fancier than your usual bbq shack, but it still has a nice homey feel, and the waitstaff were all very sweet. Wish we'd have left room for their cobbler!*only annoyance, and it's a minor one, is that I'm pretttttty sure it's not KOBE brisket, and I don't like it when restaurants just slap on that name to sound cool. no one in the US has kobe beef, okay?*"
"Ever since I was first introduced to it, Smoque has been my standard in barbeque. I've had just about every item on their menu and loved every bit of it. Chicago Q recently popped up on my radar and looked like it could give Smoque a run for its money. Here's how it stacked up vs. Smoque in my mind:Atmosphere:Definitely a different vibe vs. Smoque. A Southern plantation style feel to the whole place gives it a homey feeling, but also a bit of a regal look. Quieter than Smoque, but still noisy on a busy Friday night. There's a full bar in the front and the kitchen is open in the back which is fun to watch as you wait for your food.Food:Appetizers: When seated, you're given house-made barbeque chips and fresh pickles. Both are delicious and work against you if your intention is to clean your plate; a really nice bonus for free. The menu has a large variety of starters that all sound pretty good. We tried the cheddar bacon hushpuppies which were fantastic. They a strong hit of salt which was cut nicely by the dipping sauce. Texturally, they had a nice contrast between the crunchy, crumbly outside and the almost creamy middle.Ribs: Chicago Q also offers St. Louis cut ribs like Smoque. Their ribs were the most tender ribs I've ever had. It literally was impossible to pick up the ribs without them falling apart. Personally, I prefer the rub that Smoque uses and the fact that their ribs have a bit more chew to them. If tender ribs are your thing, then Chicago Q is for you.Brisket: Probably would give Smoque the edge here. Chicago Q's Kobe brisket is a bit leaner, but just not as juicy. Still great though.Pulled pork: Hands down, Chicago Q is better. Great, intense pork flavor with crispy little bits in the meat. I heard that this pork beat Bobby Flay; I believe it.Baked Beans: I'd call it a wash here. Smoque actually cooks their beans in the smoker, and they are very sweet. Chcicago Q's beans are more savory with a bit of a kick and have HUGE chunks of brisket in them; it eats like an entree rather than a side.Mac and Cheese: Smoque wins this one. Although their portion is a lot smaller, it's executed better. Chicago Q's portion was very large, but the bread crumbs were so toasted on the top that I got a really strong toast flavor over the mac and cheese which didn't seem that flavorful to me to begin with.Sauces: With your order come 4 different barbeque sauces: vinegar, mustard, standard, and spicy. All good, but the mustard was my favorite.Value: My friend and I ordered A TON of food, and with tip, our bill was barely $70. This makes the value just about even, if not better than Smoque.Overall: Although I still love Smoque and still consider their ribs best, Chicago Q is my new favorite. I loved the atmosphere, value, food, and variety of menu options. (They even have a brunch and a delicious desert menu if you ever manage to save room) I will definitely come back here very soon."
"On the recommendation of a friend, I stopped in here on my trip to Chicago. Everything about this place is 5 starts. The decor is very inviting, and the service outstanding. The host greeted me immediately upon entering  you can tell the staff enjoy working there as the bussers and server were extremely attentive and polite. Then there's the food.One word: wow.Now, I'm from L.A., so we don't get particularly good BBQ, so perhaps my food review won't mean as much as a BBQ aficionado, but it was breathtaking. I'm not a huge chicken at restaurants, but the pulled chicken was exquisite. I highly recommend the BBQ flight appetizer. It gives you a taste of each of the pulled meats and your first taste of the 4 delicious sauces that you'll practically want to drink with a straw!Highly recommended! I'm going to have dreams about this place. It's definitely on my ""must go"" list for future trips to the Windy City."
"Was a bit disappointed.  Pehaps because the craving for southern was right after coming back from a trip to the south. .and this was no comparison. You're served homemade chips and a pickle salad when seated, which is nice...but the chips are sooo greasy and the pickles sooo sweet. The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good. Service was a bit slow and unsure. Cute place, but I won't be back :("
"Update on my last review - after an unfortunate experience, the folks at the restaurant and their affiliates went out of their way to make things right. The food is great, the service is outstanding."
"Solid classy southern urban bistro with award winning ribs, friendly, professional staff, a gorgeous, capable chef all of whom collectively turn out a delightful food experience.  I personally prefer the St Louis ""competition ribs"", but will gladly suck down whatever gets put in front of me.  The sides are all unique and tasty.  The bar area is very comfortable for both eating and drinking and upstairs has some delightful little nooks for parties of 4-8 wishing to enjoy themselves outside of the main dining area. The quality for price makes this place a high value for money experience."
"Great place! I went here for dinner with a group of coworkers and we had a wonderful meal at Chicago Q. Great drinks, interesting menu, lovely decor and outstanding service. I had the pulled pork/pulled chicken combo and it was out of this World delicious!!!! I ended up for taking about 2/3 of it home, that's how generous the portions were. Overall our dining experience here was quite enjoyable, and I will definitely go back to Chicago Q!"
"The interior is nice but quite loud.  The ribs and brisket were amazing!  The BBQ sauces were mediocre. I thought the menu was pricey. They give you way too much food, I'd rather see the portions smaller and menu priced a little more reasonably.  Service was seriously lacking. We waited almost 20 min before our waiter came over to our table (never apologized for the delay).  Everything was slow to come out. We had to gesture to the waiter several times for additional beverage and water.   By the time we finished dinner, we just wanted to leave."
"We had a great time here.  The food and atmosphere were wonderful.  The bar when you walk it is really cozy and would be a fun place to go for a drink after work.  Drinks were a bit pricey, but it's a Chicago restaurant so that is expected.  The pickles and BBQ chips that they serve when you first sit down are SO DELICIOUS.  We thought about just eating those all night :)  Would highly recommend the pulled pork and the brisket.  I actually liked the coleslaw best of all the sides, but you can't go wrong with the cornbread either.  I also took a bite of my friends Chicken cobb salad which was fabulous."
"3.5 starsWent here on 4th of July with my wife and a friend who came for a business trip from Korea.  Overall the food was good, but there were some uh-oh moment in the process.When we first walked to the host at the patio, she asked us about how many people would dine.  I said 3, and she told me 25 to 30 minutes.  So I asked ""inside and outside""? then she said ""you should go ask the hostess (who manages the dining room) for table availability inside.""  Wasn't the first question supposed to ""do you want to dine inside or outside"" especially if there are different hosts managing dining room and patio?  Anyway we went inside and asked for a table in the dining room.  The host said 25-30 min.  So we decided to wait sitting at the bar stool having drinks.  10-20 minutes later, a hostess led us to a table at the bar!  I said I wanted to have a table in the dining room, and she was like ""you should wait for another 20-30 minutes for that.""  This is either a case of dumb people who can't calculate the table turnover rate, or that they didn't want to put us in the dining room (don't know why).Anyhow, the foot came.  They were generally well executed.  My friend and I had baby back rib, but of different kind.  I had the ""competition"" baby back rib while my friend had regular baby back (which was 6-7 dollars cheaper).  I thought my competition one was more tasty even though I had to pay more.  My wife had brisket which was very tender and tasty.  Compared to the ones from smoque bbq, this brisket had less fat.  Asparagus salad wasn't bad, but it was too oily.  Oh by the way, I enjoyed their potato chips and pickles!  Very delicious.Overall enjoyable food, but the miscommunication of the hostess almost threw us off in the beginning."
"This place is the eccentric millionaire of restaurants -- it looks fancy as hell but it serves down home comfort food at reasonable prices.  We split the Kobe brisket, a half rack of St. Louis ribs, a side of fries and cornbread.  First, they come out with complimentary chips and pickles, which is like if Olive Garden brought you unlimited soup and breadsticks as a free appetizer.  Both were goddamn delicious and (ostensibly) free.  The Kobe brisket is not Kobe obviously, but only pedantic assholes like myself know or care about that sort of thing.  Everything was tasty as hell if not mind-blowing, but I'm definitely down for multiple trips.  The spicy BBQ sauce and the South Carolina mustard made good dishes great."
"Rllllly good. I loved this place. I spent time living near Memphis and am used to good BBQ - wasn't sure what to expect of this reasonably upscale Q place in an urban environment, but was pleasantly surprised. Was in Chicago for a conference and went with my husband/daughter and a friend and her family - good place for kids in a city where everywhere feels a little bit hard with kids. Was a longish walk from the Mag Mile area, but such a nice walk - getting to see a little bit of the city outside the touristy areas. Food was excellent - think all of us there agreed. Brought out some great homemade BBQ chips and pickles before the meal. Beer selection was good. BBQ came in 4 styles - I decided to try the Carolina-style, since I'd lived there for a couple of years and fallen for the vinegary taste. They really did it well - but they brought all the BBQ sauces we'd asked for in little cups on the side, so I tried the spicy and the ""basic"" too - all were good. The only one I didn't try was the sweet mustardy one - but others said that was good, too. Would totally come back to this place again - nice area in the Gold Coast, too. Only downside - service was really slow. Nice and pleasant, but slow. Nothing bad enough to stop me from coming back. Just one of those things where I'd have spent more money and bought a second beer if he'd been back around before the food came and I filled up on that."
"I was so pissed off....  I had a hankering for Barbeque on one of the coldest days this winter.  I checked yelp because its usually spot on.  I only chose a downtown location because I didn't feel like trekking to the South Side for real ribs...  ANYWAY, I made my way over to Chicagoq and it was super empty.  I pre-ordered and got there maybe 20 minutes after I ordered.  I got home in another 10 minutes and my ribs were totally cold and hard.  They appeared and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp drying out all day.  I was so pissed off.  Don't you hate when you have a strong taste for something and when you finally get it, it's disgusting!  The greens were disgusting, the cornbread was horrid.  The entire experience left me depressed....  Please avoid this place if you can.  No real ribs there...."
The place looks and feels awesome but that's where it stops. We sat down and it took 20 minutes for the 4 of us to just get our drink order in. Finally we ordered our drinks and felt we need to order the meal as well as we thought it might be another 20 to 40 min to put or meal order in. All in all the waitress came to our table only 3 times the entire time. My drink was empty after she dropped off the food and didn't ask if we need another. I highly recommend not to go there if you want great service. When the food came out it seemed like it sat under the heat lamp too long and the baby back ribs were dry and the mac and cheese was room temp. I was forced to get up and give my card to the hostess just to get out of there.HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!
"Amazing St. Louis ribs and a giant slab!  There were 5 of us and our food came out only like 5 minutes after we ordered!  I tried both baby back and St Louis ribs and thought the St Louis ribs had more meat, flavor and fell off the bone easier - plus it was $2 cheaper than the baby back!  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Ribs were served with 4 different sauces, but honestly the meat was delicious enough on its own."
This is one of my favorite spots in Chicago.  As a former waitress I always notice a waitstaff that goes above and beyond.  I have been to Chicago Q several times and every time the staff is hands down the best wait staff I have ever encountered.  Little touches like making sure our takeout bag included our favorite sauce really put the service over the edge.  Food wise the sliced brisket is my favorite.  I had the brisket sandwich last time and it was not as moist as the sliced brisket but I still enjoyed it.  The chips and pickles that are brought out before the meal are also great!
"I was here for bbq and it's good, especially the brisket. The chicken was nothing special.  With your meal, they bring 4 small bowls of sauces to the table, which necessitates regular refilling as there is no sauce on the actual meat. I tried the vinegar, the mild and the spicy. I favor mild sauces, so the mild was fine for me and I thought there was minimal distinction between the mild and the spicy.  We ate in the bar area, which was right off the door and on this January night, extremely cold, which detracted from our dining experience.  We sampled the chicken, the brisket (which was the best) and the baby back ribs.  The cornbread also is fine, but nothing memorable, and quite hard as a next-day leftover. I forgot to mention-they start you off with homemade chips and pickles. I ate one pickle just to taste it but that was it. Not a huge pickle fan so can't really comment. I actually thought Smoke Daddy in Wicker Park was better bbq. I think this is BBQ for the chi-chi set. (They do give you a hot-and I mean very hot-towel when you're done eating.)"
"Have been there 3 times w/o a reservation and service was great. The chips and pickles are enjoyable. The ribs were okay. The last time I tried their St. Louis style ribs that gets all the special attention and was willing to pay more to try it. Again, they were just okay.  The hush puppies are okay. The cornbread is too sweet and dense for my liking. The mac and cheese was vey good.The last time we visited there we tried the crab appetizer which was served in a martini glass. It was a very generous portion but incredibly very bland. On another occasion the bbq shrimp appetizer arrived over cooked. I know, that's what I get for ordering seafood at a bbq joint. The overall experience of the food does not rise to the price. Sorry, just not feelin it."
The pulled pork is the best!!!! It melts in your mouth and is so juicy and tender. Close second are the baby back ribs. Omg so tender and flavorful and falling off the bone. The mild classic BBQ sauce was my favorite and really enhanced the meal. For an appetizer you have to go with the hush puppies. The Mac and cheese though looks good from the pictures but is dry and not very cheesy/flavorful so I wouldn't recommend getting that
"Pull out your stretchy pants and get over to Chicago q ASAP. So where do you take your mom who has traditional taste, doesn't care for fancy small plates, but appreciates good food, nice portions, and ambiance? Easy. You take her to an upscale BBQ place like Chicago q where chef/partner Lee Ann Whippin (of TLC's BBQ Pitmasters and Food Network) cooks up some of the most delicious BBQ in the city. The space (formerly Tsunami) is elegant and modern yet casual, beautifully done with white-panelled walls, rustic tables, large leather chairs and booths, soft lighting, and all the Southern charm you can fit into a place. As soon as you walk in, the aroma of BBQ just hits you in the face and makes your mouth water. Once seated, you are served unlimited bowls of BUTTERED PICKLES and homemade CHIPS. They are addicting and you might find yourself polishing off a bowl or two before your food even arrives. Then there's the food. Be warned, portions are huge. My sister and I shared the q3, a combo plate that comes with your choice of two pulled meats plus either a half slab of ribs or chicken. We went with pulled pork, Kobe sliced brisket, and the half slab of ribs. Everything is smoked, which adds that extra aroma, taste, tenderness and flavor to the meat.PULLED PORK--holy moly, best pulled pork I've ever had, melts in your mouth. RIBS--meat so tender it falls off the bone, served with three sauces (regular BBQ, spicy, and vinegar). BRISKET--tender, flavorful, you could tell it was cooked low and slow. SMOKED HALF CHICKEN--mom approved. She declared it better than the chicken at her favorite restaurant. If mom's happy, everyone at the table is happy.We also ordered a side of the MAC AND CHEESE, very tasty, not my all time favorite mac and cheese, but still good enough to order because it goes well with all the BBQ meat. And how I love CORN BREAD. Ask for extra butter to go with the corn bread, it was just a tad on the dry side. For dessert, we had the ESPRESSO BRITTLE ICE CREAM--yummy and topped with peanut brittle, very unique. Good selection of drinks--cocktails, wine, and beer. Old Rasputin Imperial Stout was great. The only disappointing part of our experience was the server. He wasn't thrilled to be working the Sunday after the new year and was clearly daydreaming about being somewhere else. However, the restaurant manager became our substitute server and totally picked  up the slack. He came over in his suit jacket to serve me my beer. He refilled our water several times, brought us more chips and pickles, and came by often to check on us--and I really appreciate that. Kudos to the manager for making up for his lackluster employee. Two fireplaces, one downstairs, one upstairs plus a wine bar. Bathrooms upstairs are beautiful--I just had to mention that. This kind of comfort food really hits the spot on cold winter days. Even the reheated leftovers were delicious. Their kitchen is open late until 1 am on Friday and Saturday nights. I'd suggest you go here with family or go with a foodie friend so you don't feel self-conscious shoving your face full of BBQ. I'm drooling thinking about my next visit--I can't wait to go back."
"We held our rehearsal dinner at Chicago q.  After looking around in the area for an alternative we settled on Chicago q as the best value and price.  For a smallish party of 24 people it was the perfect place.  The serve dealt with our food allergies (nuts and eggs) and kept the wine and beer flowing.  The BBQ is not as good as Rub, but pretty close, but its BBQ and everyone thinks their place is the best.The corn bread was fantastic."
"Where do I begin with this place...simply awesome!  I have eaten here twice now in three weeks.  I have lived on the Gold Coast for over 20 years and have yet to find a simpler, more enjoyable offering of foods on any menu in the area.  This place is great!  I often avoided this restaurant thinking the prices were in the Gibson's range.  I was mistaken.  I went here with my girlfriend before the Opera in early October.  I was dressed in a tux and my girlfriend in a beautiful full length blue gown.  Wow were we way, way overdressed for this place.  All the patrons and staff were dressed in jeans and flannel, and or t-shirts.  Lol!  Ok, so we weren't dressed appropriately for bbq.  The waiter came to our table almost immediately and took our drink order.  I was thinking wine, but figuring it wouldn't be a wise choice with bbq we went with a couple of light draft beers.  The beers were very inexpensive at 5 dollars each, not bad.  While we were waiting for our drinks the waiter returned with a couple complimentary sides of buttered pickles and homemade chips with the chef's dry rub bbq.  The buttered pickles were great, but the chips were a tad overcooked and well they tasted like chips.  Nothing special.  My girlfriend ordered the Q2 platter, which is a half chicken, brisket and a helmet size portion of coleslaw.  The chicken and brisket were smoked to perfection.  The coleslaw however was tasteless.  The thing I liked most about Chicago Q was that the chef let the meat speak for itself.  The sauces are brought out in four separate dishes and the diner is then allowed to dip to taste.  That's the way bbg should be presented.  The meat should never be drenched in sauce.  Dry rub is the way to go!  I ordered the Q burger.  Simply the best burger ever!  It was cooked to perfection!  The burger was medium, with brisket, coleslaw and melted cheese.  I have never enjoyed a burger so much!  If the burger wasn't big enough it also comes with a choice of a side.  You can get fries, coleslaw, or cornbread.  I chose the cornbread.  The portion was huge, delicious and flavorful.  I will go back again, and again.  Next time I will try the fries with my burger."
"Ok I can understand that some people may be philosophically opposed to the idea of BBQ costing this much money (after all it is a home country food) but this is worth the expense. We had a good breadth of the menu and I can say all of our food was great. Add in the location, service, and general ambience (the building itself is very cool) and you certainly get what you pay for. This is certainly a different take on simple BBQ and people from Memphis and elsewhere might roll their eyes- but I would absolutely recommend it. From what I understand it isn't a bad place for bourbon if you're into that, however I didn't drink any when i was there."
"Umm...yum!!!  We've been wanting to try Chicago q for awhile now and finally made it in this past Sunday for dinner.  First off, the space is super cute-full of character and southern charm.  Our waiter, John, was awesome-friendly and attentive and he answered all of our questions about the menu very thoroughly and gave us some great suggestions.Now onto the most important part, the food!  We started with the complimentary kettle chips and bread & butter pickles, so delicious we had to ask for refills on both and they happily obliged.  We also tried the Onion Rings and Bacon & Cheddar Hush Puppies-the onion rings were ok-very lightly battered and they came with a buttermilk ranch dipping sauce-but I will admit I've had better (that didn't stop us from clearing the plate though!).  The hush puppies were DElish-crispy on the outside and warm and moist on the inside with a yummy bacon chunks and super tasty spicy dipping sauce-strongly recommend an order of these babies.Even though we were already stuffed, we moved on to our main courses of Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken, and Ribs with the Poblano Cheddar and Honey Butter corn breads.  We also tried the Mac 'n Cheese and Kobe Brisket Baked Beans.  Everything was awesome.  Love that the meat is dry rubbed and you get to put your own sauce on it.  Super tender with a delicious smokey flavor.  The corn bread was ok, a little dry, but not bad.  The mac 'n cheese was creamy and cheesy with a crispy breadcrumb topping.  As far as the baked beans I could take them or leave them, the big chunks of brisket were good but the beans as a whole were a little lacking on the flavor.  Overall, we had a great bbq meal.  Being from the Kansas City area, my boyfriend has high expectations for his bbq and I think he enjoyed what Chicago q had to offer.We didn't have any room for dessert but to top off and awesome meal Lee Ann Whippen came by our table, chatted, and took a picture with us.  She was so unbelievably sweet and friendly and the fact that she took the time out of her night to stop by meant a lot (especially because I'm a bbq reality show junky).  No question that we will be returning to Chicago q in the future."
"Q is definitely worth trying out for lunch or dinner. They start you off with some pretty delicious homemade BBQ potato chips and pickles. For my main dish I decided to get the kobe brisket sandwich and it was fantastic. Everyone should try to taste all their homemade sauces as well! A little pricey for a barbecue place but it was worth it. I'd recommend reserving a table outside, the ambience of north dearborn street is soothing."
"I've now been to Chicago Q for both brunch and dinner and I would say this restaurant is definitely solid. I love the interior of the restaurant - it's homey and inviting, which is just perfect when you're about to sit down to a big plate of BBQ!The house made pickles are amazing.Word of warning: Some items are quite spicy (like the sauce that comes with the hush puppies) so be sure to ask your server for recommendations if you don't love spice.Pretty much all of the meat here is delicious, and the complimenting sauces are delicious.Yesterday we were there for brunch and a friend and I split two items, the sweet potato pancakes and the 3 way eggs benedict. There were actually 2 orders of eggs benedict on our table, which means there 6 poached eggs, and not one was poached correctly (ie no runny yolk). Not the biggest deal, but when a restaurant boasts 3 types of eggs benedict on their menu you would think they'd correctly poach the eggs. The sweet potato pancakes with bourbon syrup, however, were phenomenal!I enjoy the experience of going to Q, but honestly I think there's better BBQ to be found elsewhere in the city."
"First time for me last night and there are a lot of positives to say. We were well treated by the staff we met, the food we ordered and there were three of us was well prepared and the portions were good. In fact we had no room for dessert though I did take home the vanilla bourbon pecan pie which my wife really liked. We ordered fried green tomatoes and blackened alligator for starters which came with complimentary homemade potato chips and homemade bread and butter pickles which were very good. Our entrees included pulled pork and Kobe beef brisket and a dinner salad. The meat comes with 4 different types of sauce and each is unique. The spicy one was a bit mild for my taste but otherwise all was very good. They have a nice selection of spirits inc. a new favorite of mine, Bulleit 95 rye whiskey.All in all this was tasty and I would return."
"Loved everything about this restaurant.  It's much bigger than it looks from the outside.  3 Floyd's on rotation, major plus.  Hush puppies were bomb.  Tried the Kobe brisket and pulled pork shoulder.  Not sure which one was better but both were 10/10.  All the house sauces were great too.  Will be back."
"Q is a cool lookin' restaurant. From the outside, you'd never guess that it was a BBQ place, but it is. They've got yummy pickles and chips on the table for you to munch on while you look at the menu. I went with the competition ribs for my entree. While they weren't the most tender ribs I've had, they were still delicious. And actually, I thought they were even better as leftovers the next day.The reason I'm not giving this place a 5-star review is the sauces. They have 4 different sauces you can choose from, and I have to say, I wasn't totally wowed by any of them like I am by the sauces at Q BBQ in Naperville and LaGrange. Also, the acoustics aren't that great either, so if you're having a conversation and it's a full-house, it'll be hard to hear what is being said across the table.All in all though, good food and definitely worth a visit."
"I really WANT to love Chicago q because my friends have hyped this place up so much, and I do love me some barbeque. However, and maybe this is because my expectations were too high, I was let down hard. The bbq pulled pork sandwich and the salads I had were just so very average, and I can name 3 random places right off of the bat that have better barbeque. It was also half cold. The service was abrupt, and the waiter kept coming around wanting to clear off the table even though it was a weekday night and the place was half empty.I would try Chicago q again because it deserves a second chance. Maybe that one day was just off. I REALLY want to love Chicago q. Will update my review once I do!"
Outstanding service. All waitstaff and managers were visible and helpful the entire evening. Every staff member thanked us as we left and yielded as we passed! Standards of service are well executed here without any attitude- well done Chicago q!
"Let me preface this by saying that I had been wanting to come to Chicago q for so long. An avid fan of barbecue (growing up in Memphis and St. Louis will do that for you), I am a little wary of Chicago BBQ (let's be real) but was excited for Chicago q nonetheless because of all the great reviews it had. I was finally able to come for a friend's birthday dinner and the place was so cute! The outside was clean and the inside was just what Chicago q is--upscale bbq. The only things I didn't like about the decor were that it was just a little too dark and our table was awkwardly shaped for a group of 8.Now, on to the food! I wanted to like this place so badly. I got the pulled pork sandwich with corn bread as did a lot of people but we also ordered the St. Louis style ribs. The cornbread was warm and had actual pieces of corn which is the only way to make cornbread. It was great but too buttery for my taste. The sandwich itself was okay. It wasn't awful but it didn't blow me out of the water. The meat was moist enough but not well seasoned and wasn't really worth what I paid. The ribs were also just that--okay but not worth it! We also ordered the bruleed mac and cheese which was, like everything else on the menu, just okay.To be honest, my favorite part of the meal was the chips and pickles they give you at the beginning of the meal. The pickles were a hit with basically everyone at the table and my friend even bought a jar to take home! I should also say that most of my friends I think enjoyed their experience a bit more than I did (but then again they didn't grow up eating great bbq).Chicago q was okay, but please don't confuse this for great bbq."
"As far as I am concerned, the best BBQ place in the USA is in a gas station (OK Joes in Kansas City), and most BBQ places worth anything are far from glamorous looking places.  So when I saw the Veuve Clicquot umbrellas outside, and the stylish interior of Chicago q, I was skeptical to say the least.  I simply had never been to an upscale BBQ restaurant before.  I was expecting to be served overpriced and underflavored BBQ, but living only a couple of blocks away, I had to try it.   As the saying goes:  don't judge a book by its cover.The BBQ at Chicago q was very good.  Having tried the Kobe beef brisket and the St. Louis style ribs, I know that someone in the back of this posh restaurant really does know how to smoke meat.  The kobe brisket was incredibly rich, tender, and flavorful.  The ribs were not quite falling off the bone, but close to it.  They had a distinct smoky flavor and i really liked the dry rub that Chicago q uses.  And although it is a classy place, they don't skimp on the portion sizes whatsoever, which would be a sin at a BBQ joint.Beyond the meat, the sauces were quite good.  I liked the spicy sauce, although it could have been a bit spicier.  The mild is a good sweet option.  I personally don't like mustard based sauces, but my companions have seemed to like it.  The sides also were very good.  Both cornbread options are great (honey butter and Jalapeno cheddar), and the brûléed mac & cheese is also delicious.  The fries are better than average, but not outstanding.  As you might expect, this place is a bit more expensive then your average BBQ joint, but I think that the high quality food makes it worth the trip.  The service was also good, and I have to say, being able to get a reservation at a BBQ place is not something that I will complain about.   BBQ purists might look down on Chicago q, but in my view, it is perhaps an improvement on, or at the very least, an evolution in BBQ dining.I very much look forward to going back several times and working my way through the rest of the menu!"
"Chicago q was exactly what I wanted on a chilly Sunday. Very good BBQ in a pleasant environment. We were seated in the bar area which has a great vibe, not overly fancy but a step up from what you expect in a BBQ places bar. The bacon cheddar hush puppies were a great starter, and entrees including pulled pork, smoked chicken, and baby back ribs did not disappoint. The sauce were a little underwhelming but luckily the meat didn't require much sauce as it was all super tender and very flavorful. I do wish the chicken skin was a bit crispier as I prefer crispy skin."
"The best way to describe the restaurant is ""upscale BBQ.""  The environment is nice and the wine room is great for a group of around 20.   Dinner started off with BBQ chips and pickles... a great way to open up the pallet.The wait staff shared that Chef Lee Ann Whippens faced Bobby Flay on ""Throwdown"".  APPETIZERSFRIED GREEN TOMATOES -  Thick cuts of green tomato with crunchy crust and dill cream sauce.  The crust was a little heavy but it worked well with the sauce.  BBQ SHRIMP and LEMON INFUSED-GRITS -  Nice large shrimp but really didn't taste the lemon. MAINThe way the do BBQ is that it's a dry rub and provide with four sauces (Regular BBQ Sauce, Vinegar BBQ Sauce, Mustard and Spicy BBQ Sauce) yelp.com/biz_photos/euO3….  I enjoyed the Spicy best but they were all good.SALMON STEAK yelp.com/biz_photos/euO3…  The asparagus was very good.  The salmon is grilled with crisp skin and  was recommended medium.  It was ok but it lent itself well to the BBQ sauce.SIDESBRULEED MACARONI and CHEESE yelp.com/biz_photos/euO3… - the mac & cheese is a solid side but not spectacular.  Would have hoped for a bit more ""brulee"".DESSERTMILK & COOKIES yelp.com/biz_photos/euO3… Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal with Cranberries and Candied bacon, White Chocolate Apricot Almond Bar.  Friends said the bacon was nice and smokey but didn't provide enough savoriness.  Was expecting more out of the the Almond bar... it was good but didn't really taste all the ingredients. KEY LIME PIE yelp.com/biz_photos/euO3… - Very creamy with a light lime flavor... almost tasted like cool whip on a crust.The waitress also recommend the STRAWBERRY INFUSED CHEESECAKE but like the Grits the flavor wasn't there.Overall the service was excellent and the food was solid.  Good environment great for groups.  Wish they would have stronger options for non meat eaters but overall pretty much what you'd expect for an 'upscale bbq' restaurant... 3.5."
"I will start by saying that I had been DYING to go to Chicago Q since the day they opened. I cannot speak of the interior of the restaurant because I never saw it. It was a beautiful evening in Chicago so my party sat outside on their lovely patio. Nice white benches, umbrellas, brightly colored seating pads. The perfect way to spend one of the first really nice weeks in Chicago this spring.The pickles and homemade chips. Oh. Ma. Word. I would seriously return for these alone. The rub that they use on the chips is so darn addictive. I did not want to fill up on those, however, whilst waiting for my barbecue.I ordered the Kobe beef brisket platter, with the cornbread with honey butter. The cornbread piece was ginormous. Nice and crusty on the top, moist and crumbly as I cut it with my fork. The honey butter took it over the top (there is a more savory option for cornbread, but I like mine sweet). The brisket was a little different than I am used to. Typically, the brisket I have always had has been able to be shredded with a fork, but this was not like that at all. The pieces I ate while at the restaurant required a lot more cutting than I was expecting. However, I will say that the pieces I took ""to go"" seemed much more tender when I ate them at home. The beef itself had a beautiful smoke ring and the flavor was tremendous.For the table to share, we ordered some of their mac and cheese. I love how it's always called ""mac"" even when the pasta at hand is not specifically ""macaroni."" In any event, I wanted to lick every last bit of this out of the adorable little cast iron pan in which it was served. Super creamy with a nice baked cheese crust on the top. I also cannot comment on their barbecue sauces, since I do not use barbecue sauce on my barbecue. :) However, my dining companions asked for sauce to go with their leftovers and raved about all of them.Service was fantastic. Our waitress answered all of our questions and was very attentive without being intruding. The bus staff was quick to pick up our used dishes and ensured that we all got the correct ""to go"" bags. My dining companions RAVED about their pulled chicken so I think I know what I am having the next time I go.  Well, that and some sweet tea. There's always room for sweet tea."
"Oh yes. OHHHHH yes.I had been really sick of Chicago, so I booked a one night staycation nearby at Hotel Indigo for me and my boyfriend. Keeping with the theme of treatin' myself, we walked around the neighborhood looking for a place to eat. Ending up approximately... 2 minutes... from the hotel, we chose Chicago q.and I'm high-fiving a million BBQ angels right now for how delicious this place is!Together we ordered the mac 'n' cheese, pulled pork sandwich, and the ranch smoked bacon sausage plate. Mac 'n' cheese = DIVINE. I wished it was a biiiiit creamier, but seriously.... this mac 'n' cheese is close to perfection.Pulled pork = woooonderful! Combined with the (forever perfect) pretzel roll, I couldn't handle this sandwich. Plus with the variety of sauces they gave with our meal kept the sandwich interesting.Sausage = I can't speak to this. My boyfriend loved it, but wished it was a bit more flavorful.The service was good, the cornbread was the size of a generous piece of cake,  and prices were definitely reasonable for the amount of food served.Ask me if I'll come back here. Ask me."
"Good BBQ, smoky and tasty, but too pricey.  After all, it is just good bbq, nothing special."
"First thing you notice approaching q is the fabulous smell of bbq wafting across your nose. Walking in, it is as if you have been an invited guest to a fabulous cottage home. We were seated quickly and the staff was friendly. Our waitress was a bit ""off"", we were left unimpressed by her service. The food was amazing, however, it was served so quickly after we ordered, it was hard for us to enjoy our cocktails and conversation before dinner. Our waitress disappeared after the busboy cleared our plates and neglected to offer us the warm, moist towels for post-bbq clean up. We loved the food and the atmosphere, but the service could use some touch-up."
"Really great barbecue;  our primary complaint was slow service.Two of us dined at q at 1500 on a Thursday.  (This timing may have been a factor in the poor service.)We ordered (a) the q2 platter with brisket, half-rack St. Louis style and poblano cheddar cornbread, (b) pulled pork platter with coleslaw, and (c) a side of baked beans.  The brisket was wonderfully smoked and had an even, fine marble.  The ribs were very well prepared and fell off the bone with the slightest effort.  The cornbread was a drier variety, not my preference, and was mostly neglected in the battle for stomach real-estate.  The pulled pork was a lean preparation, also well smoked while still retaining it's pork flavor.  The coleslaw was mediocre.  The beans had a sweet and tangy sauce with large pieces of lean meat.  They would have likely benefited from a few other varieties of bean (ie. in addition to pinto.).  The sauces were also very good; the vinegar-style was our favorite, perhaps only improved with some more spice/heat.The greatest failing we experienced was with the service which was lagging.  We had to remind the hostess that we were there after waiting 10 minutes to place a drink order and had to wait another 15 minutes to get our bill.  (All with a restaurant that appeared to be at ~10% occupancy.)Overall a good dining experience;  perhaps great with better service."
"My husband was hosting a meeting of 30 coworkers from out of town  and was looking for a place they could all have dinner together near their hotel. I checked on line and saw Chicago q was right there in the neighborhood. Their web site indicated they could accommodate groups and the Yelp reviews were overall positive, so he went ahead and booked a private room and fixed-price menu for his team.My husband loves his BBQ (southern boy)....and he *raved* about the food, saying it was the best BBQ he'd had in Chicago. He also had nothing but great things to say about the setting and the service. I think he's told me, ""We have to go there!"" more than three times since last night's dinner.I'll report back when I have first-hand experience...."
Went here for the first time at 10ish on a Saturday.  Excellent place! I am sad that was only my first time as everything was delicious right down to the free pickles.  Great service as well.PS. don't forget to order the alligator app.  MMMMM hmmmm!
"Damn 400 reviews!  Wow.Okay so I wanted to crank a review out quickly for those that haven't chosen this spot as a possibility for Restaurant Week 2012!.  Three courses of spectacular, tantalized our (myself and dining companions) taste buds and filled our bellies to the MAX!  I could have used a wheel barrel to get back to the car, driving home was a feat.  To the chick and dude that were supposed to meet us last Sunday night for dinner, how stupid of you to bail on your best friend and also stupid of you to bail on a bangin' meal.  When you RSVP for a meal with awesome company you do your model best to get your ass into that seat.Three courses and what I got.  We all ordered beers or cocktails.  I enjoyed a couple, finely crafted Mint Julep's. (Maker's Mark Bourbon, Mint, Sugar) All served in a deep tin cup with a mound of snow over the top.  Kind of like a snow cone if you will, for adults.  Except no primary colors.First course BBQ flight which included cubes of Kobe brisket, pulled chicken and pulled pork served in ramekins with two cake size slices of corn bread topped with whipped honey butter.  Chicago Q's very own mixtures of BBQ sauces accompanied.  So much food and so very tasty.  Kobe cubes were my favorite, I dropped the silverware and went savage on the plate.  The meat was tender and heated to the right temperature, good solo and even better with their house sauces.  Second course was a full slab of baby back ribs, my gal pal opted for the St Louis style.  Now we had a 3rd diner with us, but with all the food on the table, I cannot remember what he ordered though he was not dining like we were on ferocious barbecue.  First course he had BBQ shrimp served over a sea of lemony grits, after that is where it got foggy.  You see, by this time and especially after the BBQ flight, we could each, only get two bones inside before asking for doggy bags. Final course dessert.  We asked for cookies and one got them as they emerged from the oven.  Freshly baked chocolate chip cookies they say are served with milk, though I'm not sure where exactly the milk was.  They ran out of oatmeal and bacon, poop!  Two of us got key lime pie served over a smear of a strawberry jam and with a heaping dollop of fresh whipped cream.  That key lime was extra special, so much so that I've been thinking whether to return for another slice all week.Service was on top of their game except for a few hiccups, we discussed whether its a design thing or wait staff just not asking before taking.  The Q offers house made chips, slightly sweet and salty and you can have as much as you can handle.  All in all this was a great visit and I think Chicago Q has made a few more customers with this endeavor.  In the future, instead of looking into the windows as I walk by on Dearborn, next time I'll just walk in.Great for a date or entertaining friends."
"WHOOHOO!Any restaurant that starts me off with homemade bread and butter pickles already starts as a 5 in my book.  However, the greatness didn't end there!One small complaint - I had a reservation for 5 and wanted to change it to a reservation for 6.  I called twice and was informed that there was no way that this could be changed.  Finally, things worked out and I was able to change it (and make the reservation earlier, which was fantastic).  However, I was a bit dismayed to find out that there were no 'mystery tables' that would only seat 5 and not 6.  It worked out, but it was a bit disappointing that they didn't make an effort to accommodate.In any case, a group of 6 of us visited for dinner during restaurant week and we had a great time.  Five of us ate off of the restaurant week menu and one from the regular menu and I think I can say with much certainty that we all loved it.First of all, the space is great, it's like an old Farmhouse and it's bustling, but not overly so.  I thought it was very pretty and relaxing and had some interesting artwork.  Also, the bathrooms were spotless, and nicely decorated.  Atmosphere and bathrooms - 5.Our server was super friendly, didn't rush us and she wasn't inattentive.  When we asked for her thoughts on menu items, she was quick with an answer instead of the ""everything is delicious..."" reply which I hate.  She was busy, but kept tabs on us, so she was a standout.  Service was a 5.  The food - wow!  I think I may have found my new bbq spot.  I had the trio of meats to start and then the kobe brisket, finishing with milk and cookies.  The pulled chicken and pork...wow...yum!  The brisket portion of the appetizer was tender, though a bit fattier than the entree version.  The appetizer comes with corn bread and is definitely enough for 2 or 3 to share.  The kobe brisket was delicious and I recommend it with the spicy cornbread (coleslaw was good, too).  All in all, everything I tried was great and I would definitely return.  I think portion sizes are massive, though (this may be the best deal of restaurant week!).  Two of us could have shared one meal.  The milk and cookies were delicious and I have to say, a nice, cold glass of milk does a body good (and try the oatmeal cookie with bacon...unique and delicious).  Food is a 5.  Value was definitely good for the portion sizes - perhaps a bit pricey, but everything was wonderful and you definitely will have some to take home.  A 4 for value.My only recommendation is for q to move their bbq sauce to large, squeezable containers because I can't get enough!!!"
"Came here for dinner last night. They have outside seating which always looks tempting but as it was kind of chilly out (this is summer??) we sat inside at the bar. We shared appetizers (shrimp n grits, crab salad thing I forget the name of, and fried green tomatoes.) I loved the crab and the shrimp and grits and they were perfect portion sizes for sharing (if two people are not that hungry.) The fried green tomatoes were kind of bland. They also have a handful of interesting cocktails, nothing amazing, but whatever, it's the thought that counts. It is also not super loud which is nice if you actually want to have a conversation with your dinner companion. All in all, I like this place - it's great to have another solid option in the neighborhood."
"I was so excited to try this place with my boyfriend. It was recommended by a friend and my boyfriend is an avid BBQer so I thought he would really enjoy. Some of it was outstanding but there was a few misses. First the neighborhood and atmosphere can't be beat for upscale southern BBQ. I was also excited about this place because there are so few women chefs and she has a sterling reputation. We chose to sit outside and enjoy the neighborhood. The service was quite good throughout our dinner. We started with the fried green tomatoes and were a little disappointed. The slices were quite thick and not completely coated with their yummy seasoning. All slices seemed to be undercooked and a little tough. So I would pass on those should we go back.They brought out seasoned pickles too which were excellent. Spicy and sweet we gobbled those down. We chose to split the Competition Style St Louis Ribs and they were everything advertised. DELICIOUS. Even my boyfriend who is fussy about BBQ enjoyed them and the slab was more than enough for the two of us. We added the Kobe Brisket Baked Beans. WOW!. My favorite of the night. But watch out if you order it. They have a very spicy kick to them that you don't notice at first, but starts to build after the 2nd or 3rd mouthful. By the end of dinner, my boyfriend had removed his jacket, undone his bow tie, unbuttoned his shirt collar and was mopping his sweating head. Now that is what I call good BBQ. ha! I had the Mint Julep and it came out as a snow cone. Quite unique, but truth to be told I hated the flavor and would never order it again. My boyfriend had a Negroni which was scrumptious and much more to my liking. All in all a good experience. Was it enough to take us back? Probably not. With all the good restaurants to enjoy in Chicago we will continue to search out the new and different. But if you have a hankering for good BBQ, try this place out."
"We were walking through the neighborhood on one very hot, muggy Chicago day and came across this cute restaurant.  We decided to pop in because we were absolutely starving, and could use some refreshment.We were seated right away, and the decor inside was clean and inviting.  Our waiter recommended the orange blossom martini.  I must say, I did not like it even remotely.  It tasted like cheap booze, I'm sorry to say.  I did force it all down since it cost $11 dollars.  They brought BBQ chips and sweet pickle slices to our table prior to ordering.  Both were delicious and fresh.  We were so hungry we wanted to order an appetizer.  I wanted the fried green tomatoes, but my husband refuses to eat tomatoes so we compromised on the cheddar bacon hush puppies.  These hush puppies have the ability to be fantastic, but alas ours were overcooked.  The flavor was there, if they were just pulled out of the fryer a moment or so sooner.  The dipping sauce that came with the hush puppies was a perfect accompaniment.  I would recommend this, but not when it's overcooked and dry.For our entrees we both got the pulled pork sandwich.  I also got a slice of the chipotle corn bread.  The corn bread was moist and just the right amount of sweet and heat.  Fantastic!  The pulled pork was served on a pretzel roll, which I loved because the bread didn't fall apart as I was eating the sandwich.  The pork was kinda fatty and bland, to be honest.  This was not the best pork sandwich I'd ever eaten in my life.  They serve all of the sauces on the side, so you can pick and choose what to add to the sandwich.  I went with a mixture of the North Carolina vinegar and the Spicy for the sandwich, and just tasted the others.  All sauces were flavorful and tasted homemade.  Chicago q is just OK.  Nothing to go out of my way to get again, but if I were in the neighborhood and craving BBQ, then yes I'd stop in."
Great ribs.  Healthy portion sizes.  Really like the atmosphere.  Looking forward to trying one of their sandwiches next time we go.
Joking.  Went to this place with Robert Irvine.  And for Britany's bday.  Tossed it.
"This place is a little fancier than you'd expect for a bbq joint, but thanks to Yelp we were prepared for this. We had gone to Giordanos for lunch that day so we weren't very hungry when it came time for our dinner reservation. I don't suggest doing both places on the same day but we were only in town for a few days and had a long list of places to try. With that being said, we still wanted to try as much as we could here.- Complimentary bbq chips and pickles: if you put chips in front of me I'm going to eat them.. it's that simple. I don't like pickles but my boyfriend finished the entire bowl so they must've been good.- Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies: I was excited seeing these on the menu because I've really liked the ones I've had elsewhere.. these were good but I think I liked the chipotle mayo dipping sauce more than the actual hush puppies. Probably wouldn't order again.- q2: we went with the pulled pork and St. Louis half slab.. thank you to our waitress for explaining the difference between baby back and St. Louis ribs.. naturally we went with the one with more meat. The q2 came with a huge piece of cornbread and 4 bbq sauces (original, spicy, vinegar, and south Carolina mustard). My favorites were the spicy for the ribs and vinegar for the pulled pork, while my boyfriend liked the mustard the best. The ribs were tender and delicious. The pulled pork was also really good. However, I prefer ribs and he prefers pulled pork so splitting the q2 worked out perfectly. - braised greens - I was a fan but could've done with the pieces of pork in it and the separate sauce had little flavor. I used the vinegar from the q2 instead.. much better.It was just the right amount of food for the two us - we went home full and happy."
"First off, they have a nice outdoor patio and interior is also well decorated with a few tvs showing college football. After that they brought free homemade BBQ chips (rather good) and bread n' butter pickles (meh, too sweet imo). It looked like they had a nice cocktail menu too, but I didn't partake. My meal was a half rack of St. Louis ribs with honey cornbread. My friend got a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw. Despite the snobby anecdote from the server about how ""upscale"" the ingredients are and how they add more ""love"" to the food, to explain why their prices are higher than most, I would consider the food very mediocre. It's hard to compare BBQ in Chicago to anywhere down south, but after the schpeal about how award-winning, upscale, etc. this place is I expected much better. The ribs were just ok, while the cornbread was somewhat better than that. My friend said the pulled pork was just average and the coleslaw tasted like they forgot to add the dressing. The bbq sauces (sweet, spicy, mustard, vinegar) were also decent but nothing standout. If you've ever had true Southern bbq, save yourself the disappointment and go elsewhere."
As much as I wanted to take a picture of this awesome food - I was here for a work recruiting lunch. The House Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies were a very good appetizer to start with! I continued my meal by enjoying the American Kobe Sliced Brisket (could have given a couple more pieces) with a side of Pablano Cornbread (such a massive piece that I don't think I even ate half) - along with my countless trips to the butter pickles that were provided when we sat down. Can't wait to come back!
Very Solid BBQ. Some of the best ribs in town. Huge portions... so expensive price seems fair. Great ambience - feels like a fancy steakhouse inside. Service was fast. Not a typical BBQ joint. But it works here.
"I wanted so badly to love Chicago q. As a Texas native who spent several years living in St. Louis, carefully smoked meats are dear to my heart, and I will take almost any opportunity to find a new place that manages to craft cuts of brisket or ribs into succulent, flavorful morsels through hours of smoking.Its hard not to love this restaurant, too, especially if you love the south (as I do). From the moment you walk in, you feel like you've stepped into a different state, where drinking bourbon is the norm (personally, I felt like I was going to the kentucky derby). If you like barrel-aged spirits and the southern ""feel"", you should try the mint julep; you won't be disappointed. All around, the decor is tasteful and elegant, and the ambiance is wonderful, even ""cute"", as other yelpers have described it.But herein lies my problem; I have never really valued ""cute"" and ""BBQ"" together. Separately, yes, I love cute restaurants, and I love bbq, but the values of good BBQ and cute restaurants can sometimes be at odds in my mind. Even after trying Chicago Q, my favorite ribs are the ones that have come from some dude with a smoker at some obscure fair in Texas (or a certain smokehouse in St. Louis; I'm looking at you, Pappy's). There's just something about smoked meat that I feel needs to be enjoyed in the simplest settings- on a picnic table with a checkered table cloth, out of tupperware and paper plates, or even standing around in a parking lot. For me, barbeque is an experience of the soul, where you meet salt-of-the-earth people, share tables and food, and you line up to get it while its hot, because when its gone, you're just SOL.Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say you can't enjoy barbeque outside of these settings or in a fancy restaurant- I just think Chicago Q misses the mark on the soul and flavor I've become accustomed to in eating BBQ. I got the competition St. Louis style ribs, and they were technically perfect, but the perfection feels superficial- they LOOK amazing, with all of the hallmarks of expertly smoked ribs- perfect smoke rings, a nice bit of crust, and the meat stays on the bone until you bite it off. However, they were not seasoned enough, and while I was expecting loads of smokiness (because supposedly the competition ribs are smoked much longer, and they're priced accordingly at $34, though my server couldn't really give me a definitive answer on what the difference between the regular and competition ribs is), I think most of the effort goes into the texture and appearance of the ribs, rather than their flavor. My fiance's pulled chicken sandwich was huge, and bits of the chicken were tender and flavorful, while others were dry and bland. We also shared some cornbread and the mac n' cheese; I loved the whole kernels of corn and topping of brown sugar on the cornbread, but my fiance felt it was too dry, and she loved the sharp cheddar sauce on the macaroni, but I felt it was too much, so I guess its a toss-up on the sides. I'm glad I tried Chicago Q; it was a pleasant evening, it satisfied my hankering for some sort of BBQ, and I certainly didn't leave hungry. Next time I want to spend that kind of money on a cut of meat in a nice restaurant, though, I'll probably go to one of the famous Chicago steakhouses, where I can get an authentic cut of beef in a style that Chicago is known for doing well. I would definitely go back to Chicago Q for that mint julep, and I think it could be a good value as a lunch destination."
"Most BBQ you'll find in Chicago is kind of like American-Chinese food: you know it's not the real thing, but it satisfies a certain orange saucy craving. But sometimes you really want the real thing. Chicago Q is a valiant, if not very successful attempt at the real thing. It has terrific service, really good sides and apps, and a great decor, but it's attempt at true Q inspires only but a shrug.I got the 3 meat combo with brisket (which was actually by all measures excellent), St. Louis ribs (just ok flavor, not a lot of meat on the bones), and pulled pork (good cut of meat clearly taken off the whole shoulder (as opposed to from out of a preprocessed pack), but without much flavor).All of the meat was unsauced, which isn't a problem per se, but how the sauces were served was disappointing: small portions in small cups with small spoons. Aesthetically it looks really pretty, but functionally it doesn't work real well. It may be a bit low brow for Chicago Q but squirt bottles work so much better. The NC mustard was fantastic. If only I could get the damn stuff on my food..."
"I really dont know where to start with this review.  I came here with a party of 25 on a Sunday night.  I must start by saying the service was phenomenal.  Our waiter was attentive, helpful with suggestions, and just a very pleasant person especially considering dealing with such a large and rowdy group.    Since we had a large party, we ordered just about every appetizer and nothing really stood out to me.  The smoked wings and the grits were good, but nothing was exceptional considering the pricing.  For dinner, I had the competition style baby back ribs with a side of mac and cheese.  Given the price of the competition style, they should be the best ribs in the universe.  They were good, but give me carsons, smoque, or twin anchors any day and I'll be just as happy.  I suppose you are paying for the nice ambience so you can't really discount that I suppose.We ordered every dessert for the table and I have to say this was the highlight of the night for me.  Specifically, the milk and cookies, cheesecake, and espresso brittle ice cream were all phenomenal.In conclusion,  when it comes to BBQ, I much rather be at smoque or something similar.  However, if you do want BBQ in an upscale and classy setting, this is the place for you."
"Cool place and nice vibe. You wouldn't think so, but there is ample seating area in the back of the restaurant as it opens up. There's bar with a nice bartender who can make stiff drinks. Beer selection is ok. I ordered the brisket sandwich which was ok. They do give you four different sauces, so  I guess that is cool, but I would rather have my meat already marinated and soaked in that sauce then me having to put it on. The bread good and had a bit of sweetness to it. I think I need to try out other items, but the brisket was so so. Oh service is good. No complaints there!"
"I've only tried the ribs here, but the experience was very good and I would come back without hesitation.   The food was great, apparently the ribs are award-winning and there was a variety of 4 different flavorful, interesting sauces provided.  You get a bowlful of really nice homemade bbq chips and pickles (separately) as you sit down, so you can munch while you wait for the entrees.  The staff was really friendly. There was a slight miscommunication with my order, but it got resolved in a quick and friendly manner with no problems.  The prices aren't cheap, but very reasonable.  I'll come back to try the other things they have on the menu."
"Quite simply, the most impressive space I've ever seen feature such mediocre food.The meats are smoked, though not thoroughly. The sides are about two strokes of effort short of being tasty. The soft drinks are shy on syrup. For real. We spent $150 on ""bar-be-que"" and had watery drinks.The service was are-you-ready?-No?-See you-in-20-minutes.The space, however, is out of this world."
"Four enthusiastic stars for Chicago q.At first I was a little nervous and put off:Pulled up just past the restaurant right in front of a pay-to-park box.  Score.  As I was situating myself, the valet tapped on my window and told me I had to valet.  I said okay and went inside.When I got inside, it was pretty dead.  (5:45 on a Thursday, maybe I expected more of a happy hour crowd?)I sat at the bar and ordered a drink (Original Sin Cider).The more I thought about this valet situation, the more uncomfortable I got.  I was parked in front of the pay box.  That's not valet.  So, I asked to speak with the manager.  He was friendly, and listened to my concerns.  He said that ""didn't sound right"" and he'd be back.  He went outside, came back in, and right away explained that the valet outside was new, it was his first night, and he didn't know.  He also said for the inconvenience, he would pick up the cost of my valet.  I thanked him.Then, I realized, this meal was going to be awesome:By 6:15, the bar and restaurant were both packed to the gills.We were seated and immediately greeted by Dan, our server, along with bread & butter pickles and homemade bbq chips, compliments of the house.  (DO NOT pass these up, they were both awesome!)How cute is it in here?  I felt like I walked into Paula Deen's house.  Wainscoting, bright, clean, very Southern Chic.As the manager was walking by, my boyfriend stood up, shook his hand, and it was immediately obvious that they knew each other, which, as it turns out, they did know each other from the past.  Cool.  My BF knows someone wherever we go!We ordered (there were six of us):2 sampler appetizers (shrimp'n'grits, dry rubbed chicken wings, hush puppies, fried green tomatoes.  The shrimp'n'grits and fried green tomatoes were my favorite.  The grits were creamy and perfectly seasoned, not bland at all, and the shrimp had been grilled perfectly.  The fgt's were sliced thick, cooked just right, nice cornmeal breading, good flavor.We also ordered a q2 with St. Louis ribs and pulled chicken, and a q3 with pulled pork, St. Louis ribs, and brisket.  Side dishes: cheddar poblano corn bread, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese.The meats were all fantastic.  I've never been a brisket lover, and this brisket may have just changed my mind.  Super tender and very flavorful.  I didn't even use sauce on it.The ribs were literally fall off the bone.  The pulled chicken was juicy and went great with the North Carolina vinegar sauce.I only tried the cornbread and mac & cheese, the mac & cheese, I'm really picky about, it was okay, not great... but the cornbread was phenomenal.  Moist yet crumbly, probably the best I've had.We were all too full for dessert, but compliments of the manager, we ended up with cheesecake, espresso ice cream, cherry cobbler, and pecan pie.  I tasted the cherry cobbler and pecan pie... I wish I would've saved room!Check out Chicago q, you will NOT be disappointed.  I really can't wait to go back!!!"
"As the Depeche Mode song goes, I just can't get enough.Came back to Chicago Q for a dinner with a few co-workers. They were as blown away by this place as I was the first time I came here. I love that Chicago Q is very consistent with its great service and amazing food. I cannot stop thinking about the poblano corn bread. oh my goodness, just...why can't I eat it every day? I had a chance to try the Southern Belle drink this time around, and it was dangerously good. Woo boy. I could just keep going on and on about how much I love this place. Get the bruleed mac and cheese! Why are you still reading this and not stuffing your face with bbq?!"
"I absolutely love Chicago q. One of my favorites, I bring all of my out of town friends and family here. I have tried just about everything on the menu, and I really can't say I've disliked any of it. The BBQ chicken is my favorite; however, the ribs are excellent, as well. All of the sides are absolutely outstanding. Definitely, order some cornbread and hush puppies for the table. I also love the pickles and chips as a nod to the traditional bread basket. My goal is to have a large group come here with me and order the pork shoulder."
"So back in the day if I wanted BBQ the only good option was Fat Willy's Rib Shack... suddenly Chicago has been on a major BBQ binge. I can't even name all the places that have popped up around Chicago, but until tonight Smoque was my favorite. To complete my #FatKidSunday of Del Seoul tacos, Molly's Cupcakes and finally Chicago Q's. First of all the staff, the atmosphere, the building... top notch! Now to the good stuff... to start off we tried a BBQ flight. A trio of pulled chicken, pulled pork and kobe brisket with their trio of BBQ sauces. So the good part is it's simply amazing... the bad part is it'll make you even more indecisive on what to order for your main course. All the meats are soooo damn good, but ultimately the smoked pulled chicken is just out of this world good. I'm pretty sure those chickens were smoking while they were alive... PETA might not like that. Ultimately decided to go with the smoked half chicken with cole slaw and a side of mac and cheese. The half chicken is a chicken like no other... cover it up with BBQ sauce and tell me it isn't the best BBQ chicken you've ever had. Even the cole slaw was damn good, all like 20lbs of it that they put on your plate. The mac & cheese deserves it's own paragraph... it deserves it's own review entry actually. Holy crap did I think Art Smith's mac & cheese at Table 52 was the best ever... well here comes Chicago Q taking the throne on that one. Hands down my favorite BBQ place in Chicago now. I can't wait to go back and try some ribs next time. I liked it so much I'm thinking of getting a smoked whole turkey from them for Thanksgiving!"
"A definite favorite in the neighborhood, try the brussels sprouts and bottomless Bloody Marys on Saturdays and Sundays!"
"There are a lot of good BBQ places in Chicago however, q is by far my favorite. The ambiance is cozy yet sophisticated. The waitstaff are attentive and personable. The food is.... perfect. We ordered the flight of BBQ, the chilli, the honey butter cornbread, and the mac and cheese (for two). The flight came with a bunch of different sauces (all delicious) and I think that every table gets homemade pickles - for free. These pickles are amazing - I bought two jars on my way home and sent one home to my parents. They were thrilled."
Honestly the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. Our server was very rude. I am about to move out of Chicago and heard so many wonderful things about Q I wanted it to be the last place I tried with my girlfriends. Very BIG MISTAKE! the only good thing about this place is the free pickles and BBQ chips. We all said we would never go back.
"Chicago q never disappoints. We're always seated on time and never have to wait when we make a reservation. Maybe I'm used to River North prices, but I think everything on the menu is reasonably priced.  I don't think there's a bad dish on the menu. The complimentary chips and pickles are great and the pulled pork and St. Louis ribs are standouts.  The fairly-recently added sausage platter is also delicious."
"I'm not a huge barbecue person.  I will admit I love the smell, but usually the taste isn't what I'm expecting.  However, Chicago q was fantastic!!  Ribs that fall off the bone, pulled pork and chicken that is so tender and flavorful....it was an amazing dinner and I know I will be back.On the downside, the mac and cheese was disappointing and while the service was outstanding, I wasn't ready for our meals to come out that quickly.  We didn't have time to talk of get comfortable or even get half way through a drink before our meals came out.  Could have used a little time to enjoy the pickles and chips and have a beer."
"Love Love Love this place. Went here for the first time with a group of 6 for brunch and we all had a great time!Firstly, our server Otha and others were so helpful. Our drinks were always filled and he checked on us all the time and they were all so friendly and nice. Probably the best service I received in a restaurant in Chicago. I seriously think that service is what separates the good from the greats, and Chicago Q was great.Our food was yummy. I had the kobe hash from their brunch menu and it was good. There was so much food that my hubby had to finish my plate.It was my BFF's bday and we got a surprise cheesecake for her with candle and Otha included some other pastries on the house. It was lovely.I definitely recommend Chicago Q. Great Food and Greatest Service :)"
"Love this place... If you like barbeque, you will like this place. Excellent service and excellent food."
"This is a great place to get some BBQ, everything I tried was great! I got the slider trio which was perfect, very delicious and a bunch of different food combinations. The homemade chips and pickle chips are really good. Will defiantly be back!"
"Sometimes procrastination works out.  My friends and I planned a weekend trip to hit the auto show, eat, imbibe and stay downtown for the night.  My friends are not huge foodies, and the restaurant I really wanted to hit was Girl and the Goat, but they were booked up.   Chicago Q was not on my radar for Saturday the 15th, but my indecision paid off.We arrived a bit early.  Exiting the cab, we smelled the pleasant smell of wood smoke. We and grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our table.  It's not Mint Julep season, but Chicago Q's is awesome.  ""Cool"" presentation, you'll see...We were sat and complementary chips and bread and butter pickles made it to the table.  They were delicious and I hate sweet pickles.  We ordered the appetizer special, basically a small sample of client favorite apps.  They included fried green tomatoes, smoked shrimp and grits, smoked wings and hush puppies.  The smoked wings were absolutely great and the sauce was tasty, as well.  The tomatoes were well prepared as well.  I wanted to give the grilled Blue Point Oysters a go as well.  Though I enjoyed the preparation, the dish seemed like it was more of a gratin than anything.  Didn't get much smokey flavor from it... Still nice, though. My buddy and I are whisky enthusiasts.  We were given their ""private"" list and went with a trio of Angel's Envy Bourbon.  The port finished, rye and cask bourbon's were monsters and well priced.  The entree's arrived.  My friend's all ordered sandwiches.  The brisket was fork tender, juicy and highly flavorful.  I went with their special offering, a smoked veal chop with white and purple potatoes and charred greens.  The chop was very flavorful and tasty but needed just a little bit more seasoning.  The greens were conversely, super salty, so I combined the two and it was really enjoyable.  I had an awesome time here.  You can eat really well at Chicago Q even if you're on a tight budget.  Will be back for sure."
"I am shamelessly a brisket fanatic and Chicago Q has some of the best I've ever tasted. Everything here is top notch. I anticipated that a weekend night would bring a long wait, so I went with the boyfriend on a Thursday night and we were seated right away. We loved the pickles and chips, had to refrain from asking for more so we didn't get full. Had those hush puppies with the bacon which were awesome. He had the pulled pork sandwich and I had the brisket sandwich, he reluctantly gave me a bite with some cole slaw. It was awesome. I really enjoyed their beer selection and he was loving the whiskey selection and service. Maybe one of the best parts of Chicago Q was our server. She was extremely friendly (not in the obnoxious, overly enthusiastic way), made great suggestions, and was always checking on us. Can't wait to go back!"
Oh Chicago Q... I'm in love with you.This joint is top notch.  The place is gorgeous and indicative of a fine dining restaurant.  The service was stellar and the staff was very knowledgeable.  It's great getting the butter pickles and kettle chips when you sit down...and their beer selection is quite good (I'd recommend the in-heat wheat)I had the pick 2 last time I dined which included pulled pork and a half slab of babyback ribs.  Yum!  So much I couldn't eat it all.  You should also have the hush puppies... they're crazy good!It's a great place to dine if you're looking for BBQ in a upscale environment.
"GREAT food. Reasonable prices. LOVE the unique design. However, it's crazy hard to get in here :-/"
My favorite BBQ place in Chicago and I've been to almost all of them. Atmosphere I real nice yet feels very casual.
"New Year's  dinner was soo good at Chicago q.  We have been looking forward to dining at Chicago q since we notice the restaurant during the summer farmer's market.  I had the half-chicken with complimentary chips and pickles.  Tasty!   We enjoyed a taste of about five different sauces, all were complimentary to the meal.  Ranging from Sweet to spicy.  Love it!  We can't wait to dine at Chicago q very soon!"
"We visited this place while on vacation in Chicago.  Something to know about this restaurant.  LeeAnne Whippen, a very accomplished BBQ competitor, co-owns this restaurant.  When I found this out I had high expectations.  Chicago is not known for BBQ and I like what the idea of what they are trying to do here.  Offering an upscale environment for eating BBQ is interesting. Quality service that one would expect at a fine dining establishment.  In my opinion this is good, on paper.I have had BBQ everywhere in the country.  So experiencing this was odd and left me at a little bit of a loss as to what to expect. It wasn't bad, just different.  I am of the bent that I want to get up to the counter, choose my meat by the pound, sides and then sit down like in Texas.  Not so much, a complete 180.  Prices definitely match the presentation.  This was the most expensive BBQ place I've ever been, more so than Blue Smoke in Midtown Manhattan.  Still, not a big deal really.  Just not what I expect when eating BBQ.They offer quality meats such as Kobe brisket and Kobe beef ribs.  Man did I want the beef ribs, alas they were sold out.  I had the competition spare ribs.  These were good.  Exactly what I would expect from a competition rib.  These were worthy of a placing at finals.  Good taste, tenderness and appearance. The staff brings you BBQ chips dusted with dry rub.  Awesome.  They also bring bring some bread and butter pickles.  I'm not a fan of pickles.  These were great.The sliced brisket was good but it was missing smoke. I was expecting to taste beef smoke and some salt and pepper.  The fat was rendered well, caramelized, the rub was sweet.  I could not detect much smoke at all.  The tenderness was correct, had a good pull to it. Overall it wasn't central Texas brisket, the holy grail of brisket, but we were not in central Texas.  The wife was happy.The portions were large.  Prices high but it's an expensive city and an upscale restaurant that costs money to run.  Overall it was good.  I would recommend checking it out."
"2-1/2 stars. I really don't get the hype. While I am not a huge fan of BBQ, I was hoping to be won over by Chicago Q after reading such good review.  However, that was not the case.  The chips and pickles are a really nice touch and the sauces are delicious. BUT-- I do not like the idea of competition BBQ where you put the sauces on yourself.  I got the brisket and it was very difficult to eat.  The bread was dry especially with the lack of sauce. The brisket was chopped into squares which made the sandwich impossible to eat.The mac and cheese was nothing to write home about. The cornbread was good but dry. The sweet cornbread was definitely the better than the savory.The positive things: the decor is really cute and it's cool that it is in a house and located in a great area. Unfortunately, I will not be coming back here."
"Chicago q is a fun venue to have dinner with friends or for a date night; the atmosphere is lively, the food is great and q turns BBQ into an upscale and modern experience. You even are offered a choice of black or white napkins so depending on what color clothes you are wearing the napkin will not leave noticeable lint! Never had that option at a BBQ joint before.At Chicago q they start you off with a basket of delicious BBQ flavored potato chips and a basket of sweet pickles. They are quick to replenish these treats. There are a half dozen appetizers and our group of six shared the BBQ Flight and the Hush Puppies; both were delicious and a great way to kick off our feast. The BBQ Flight (and the entrees) come with four different homemade BBQ sauces so you can doctor up the meat to your liking (a sweet sauce, a spicy sauce, a mustard sauce and a vinegar sauce). Most of us preferred the sweet sauce, but they are fun to experiment with. I went with the pulled pork shoulder for my entree, but sampled some of my wife's St. Louis ribs. Both were quite good; not only is the ambiance upscale, but the food is much better than your average BBQ joint. The portions are bountiful and only one of the six in our party had a clean plate at the end of the night. Our table also shared a trio of sides including the Kobe beef baked beans (my favorite of the sides; the Kobe beef was succulent and the beans the right combination of spicy and tangy) as well as the buttermilk mashed potatoes and the bruleed mac & cheese (which were both hits as well). The entrees come with your choice of two types of cornbread, slaw or fries - take my advice and go for the cornbread. The meats are excellent quality and well cooked and seasoned. My skinny jeans barely fit by the end of this meal! Chicago q has a nice cocktail list, lots of bourbons, several beers (though I do not believe any are on tap) and about thirty wines; one of my favorite inexpensive wines was on the menu, Girls in the Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon ($34 per bottle) and our table shared three bottles; this went well with the BBQ. Most of us were too full for dessert, but two brave souls ordered the Chocolate Mousse with Pretzel Crust and Salted Caramel which they seemed to enjoy and devour. Chicago q has a nice ambiance; it was a much larger space than I anticipated but even on a Tuesday night it was packed. I definitely recommend making reservations (they are on Open Table). The dining room is a little on the loud side and our table was a tad small for six people, but everybody seemed to have a fun time and we talked about coming back to partake in the $305 Whole Pork Shoulder dinner carved tableside (that serves about ten). Our server was fairly good and her assistants made sure our water glasses were kept full and our table clean. While q is a bit on the pricey side for BBQ (our tab came to about $55 per/person including the wine, tax and tip), it is worth paying up for. Chef Lee Ann is definitely Whippen up some delicious BBQ and this restaurant is well worth a trip."
"Love the BBQ at q. Sitting outside in the summer is a must, the porch furniture only enhances the experience. I get the pulled pork, it's delicious and the competition style BBQ lets you mix and match flavors. My boyfriend is a brisket fanatic and was not disappointed. The corn bread is giant! So much good stuff. You will not go home hungry!"
Event: My birthday. My wife said where do you want to go for your birthday.  I will always pick this place. Great BBQ. Great Whiskey. Try the BBQ beans as a side. It's full of beef and beans and tastes spicy. There is nothing better than sipping good whiskey in a good atmosphere with a great BBQ in front of you.
"Not sure if they do this when dining at the restaurant, but I ordered a full rack of baby backs, and what was delivered to me was a plastic container full of hacked up ribs... NOT a slab.  It looked like leftovers from someone else's plate.  When I called the restaurant, the manager said ""that's how we do it.""  The hacked up slab of baby back ribs were dry and pretty disgusting.  Can you imagine a steak from Gibson's coming pre-cut??"
"Pretty good. The staff was very friendly and informative. We came for lunch, but I think dinner may be better. Our food came out tasting good (we had smoked chicken and brisket), but my only complaint was that it was not hot at all. Also the brisket was a little dry. It's weird but to me the best brisket I've had in this city so far is from Whole Foods. The sweet pickles and chips were not bad, a little to sweet for me. We were a bit disappointed that there were no beef ribs for lunch. I'd come back again to see if dinner is better (with hot food and beef ribs.)"
"One of the best dinners I have ever had!  My boyfriend and I had been to Q before but this time they stepped it up even more, which is hard to believe!  I hosted a dinner for my boyfriend's graduation and invited 16 of his friends.  Mary Catherine, the event coordinator, set up everything for us including a set menu with our top picks and was there to see that we had everything we needed.  She introduced us to our wait staff and everyone couldn't have been nicer or more attentive.  Our menu included: Hush puppies - delishWings - SpicyBriskey - yum! competition ribs - my fav!  mac n cheese - tables favcornbread - must getbeans - very tastycarrot cake - if you like carrot cake its a must trysauces - amazing!  i loved them all But by dessert everyone was so full it was hard to finish the cake, but we all tried!  The set menu was only $40 a person which is a fantastic deal.  Plus they box up all the leftovers which is a win win.  Definitely give Q a chance to host your large party, they do a wonderful job!"
This place was a dream!Party of 3--two burgers and a sandwich. So yummy. I ate half and was stuffed. Come play. Good drinks.
"Disappointing.  Quality is sub par, staff is fair (at least our waitress).  Its the food that so disappointing.  Beef ribs were overcooked, brisket cubed not sliced and dry, very dry, corn bread seemed to be sitting out for ages and crumbled since it lost all of its moisture.   I could not recommend or be willing to go back."
"Delicious from start to finish...from the pickles and potato chips to the chocolate mousse pie.  We had one of the combo platters and the competition baby backs were some of the best we've ever had.  The portions on the combo platters seemed a bit small, but everything was quite tasty! A comfortable dining room and efficient wait staff.  We'll definitely be back!"
"It has been a long standing tradition that we take my friend out for bbq on his birthday, and this time around certainly did not disappoint! I appreciate the place for breaking the stereotype that bbq is meant to be homestyle and that it can't take on a more decadent twist. I think the ambiance has a more upscale feel to it, but yet it's warm and inviting. Our server was especially hospitable and made us feel every bit as comfortable as if I was at home. I love that we get the bbq chips and pickles on our table. The seasoning is fabulous and works as a great transition to the seasoned meats and bbq. I opted for the Evan Williams house bourbon whiskey. It was very smooth and paired very well with the brisket and ribs. We lucked out that we were at the start of Restaurant Week and I opted for the pre-fixe, choosing the beet salad, brisket, cole slaw, and carrot cake. My friends were kind enough to also let me sample the spiced wings, the honey cornbread, the pulled pork, and the warm cookies. We also had 4 sauces set before us. There was the mild bbq, spicy bbq, vinegar, and mustard based sauces. I have an affinity for spicy so that was my sauce of choice, but all were uniquely and yet deliciously flavored. I would certainly love to have a bottle of that spicy bbq on hand at home. The meats were tender and cooked to my liking. The meat was falling off the ribs and tasted delicious even without the sauce. I would love to come back here, but agreeably it is a little more on the pricey side so I'd consider it at time when I can treat myself. I am tempted to order the wings for carryout though..."
"I've been here around 3 times, each time on a Sunday with my parents.  The service is always top notch, there are always multiple servings of chips and bread and butter pickles....and there is a reason why there are multiple, and that reason is that they are very good.  The staff is very helpful and always making sure you have everything you need.Whenever I come here I always get the baby back ribs, just regular style.  I've had the competition style once and didn't find it necessary to go for again.  You are more than free to decide differently.  I have had the brisket on a sampler platter and wasn't overly impressed..  But the ribs are always great here, these ribs will fall of the bone and they are smoked.  None of that non-smoked Twin Anchors fall off the bone, this is real deal smoked tenderness and juicy.  I don't think many other places in the city can compare to the ribs served here.We also had the bbq shrimp with herb infused grits which was very good, it could probably use another shrimp or two as we only received 4.  But both the shrimp and grits did not lack flavor.  I had a side of beans with brisket in them on the side of my ribs...they were too sweet for my liking of beans, but they are more than generous with the brisket in the beans.  Overall I really like this place, it is my favorite place for BBQ ribs.My update is if they have the smoked alligator get it, I won't be able to go there and not get it if they have it in the future."
"Maybe the hype of this new hot-spot was a little overdone, but this place was an honest ""just ok."" (wao wao...in the debbie downer voice).BBQ in Chicago is done properly in many places, not many of which are in the Gold Coast, so this started off on the right foot opening its doors in the former Tsunami sushi location. The decor and atmosphere were very appropriate. The mint julep and homemade bread n' butter pickles served at the onset of the meal were the only things I favorably remember.The ""just ok"" part was a result of the not-so-good service, the overpriced food and the stereotypical Gold Coast staff....not to mention, the food was nothing to brag about.Our server added several items to our bill (likely by accident) and when we kindly pointed them our to her, she proceeded to give us attitude as if WE accidentally charged ourselves for food we did not order...AS IF!!!I don't know about you, but if you're going to have crappy service, the food needs to be much better!"
"Absolutely delicious! Pricy (for my budget, or rather, my bf's budget) but WORTH IT. Went here on the 4th and was able to get a reservation really quickly. The hostess seemed a bit off but I imagine she'd had a really stressful shift and who wants to be working on Independence Day anyway? Luckily our waiter was much friendlier and helped us choose which kind of ribs we wanted and gave us some great recommendations on apps. I also really liked the pickles and chips they bring out at the beginning and thought it was a nice touch. Left feeling full and happy. Highly recommend."
"Can't really say anything bad about the place, but can't really say anything good either.  I've had better Q, but I've had much worse.  A little pricey.  They seem to be caught in some kind of identity vortex and can't make up their mind.  Is it a Q joint, or a high end joint."
"great food, great service.  phenomenal pickles and chips to start!"
"Made a 7 pm reservation for three on a weeknight. We arrived at 6:30 and they were more than happy to seat us. Great service--very friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, answered all of our questions about the different types of BBQ and ribs offered. I love that instead of bread for the table, they have BBQ chips and pickles--unique and great touch, and delicious! The Competition Ribs were fantastic--myself and another in my party shared them, and we still took home almost half a slab. Besides the ribs, the cornbread was the star of the show for me. Sweet, moist, and easily shared by three people. We also ordered the mac and cheese, as well as the mashed potatoes. They were both very good, though they could've been a bit hotter. I will definitely go back, and next time would love to dine outside. And try the hush puppies, which sounded delicious."
"Went to this joint with high expectations.  My wife had food from catered and thought it was really good.  Saw it on Check Please and figured I love BBQ so let's give it a shot.  Started off solid with drinks in the bar.  The drinks were well mad and they had a nice cocktail selection.  Plus one.  The resturaunt itself is really nice, two floors, little bit bright but cool lighting, overall a great atmosphere.  Plus 2.  Our party was fairly large and we were seated upstairs at this large table sorta off on it's own... cool. Plus 3.  Waiter was a pleasant chap who was knowledgable on the BBQ and also on their solid beer list.  Plus 4.   I thougth we were really rolling at this point so we go about ordering all kinds of food and I'm pretty juked up at this point.  Food... oh man total let down.   The sauce on the side is great, the pulled pork no so much, the sides such as mac and cheese were a total let down.   I couldn't have been more dissappointed.  Smoq and Fat Willies are better from a food standpoint.I might hit this place for drinks and maybe an app but I wouldn't return for dinner.  Skip it and get better BBQ at smaller less expensive places.  It's usually not about the money for me if you look at the places I dine but when the food isn't up to snuff I hate over paying.  Damn I hate when I pick a lame place!"
"Growing up in STL, I love barbeque.  I am always trying to find a place that reminds me of home. This place is much to upscale to feel like home.  Many of the people were dressed up for dinner, instead of shorts and nice short for summer.  Since going GF, I have found that I am limited in what barbeque sauce I can eat.  Regarding their knowledge about GF, I would have to give them four stars.  Once they were aware of my allergy, they provided me a gluten free menu that was not much smaller than the regular menu.  This is a bonus for us GF eaters; usually we get maybe two dishes to choose from.  They get four stars for being GF friendly. The food was good, but it was more on pricey side, therefore three stars.  The seasoned chips provided when you arrive are tasty. The service was okay. We ordered drinks and it seemed to take forever as they had run upstairs to the 2nd floor bar instead of the 1st floor. Due to slow service on drinks and refills on ice tea, therefore they warrant two stars.  I loved the decor, however it was too loud to carry on a conversation with only four people, therefore two stars. The only reason I am giving this place three stars is due to the GF eatability."
"A friend made a reservation for Restaurant Week and invited us to partake.  Done!  I was at first apprehensive because Yelp says it isn't good for kids.  My friend emailed the restaurant and we were informed that they are *very* kid friendly and have a kids menu.  Yelpers, you did me wrong.  We sat at a GIANT table that was great because I wasn't constantly jockeying things out of the little dude's reach.  I was a big fan.  The room is kinda loud but frankly, that's my thing now so that if my 15 month old lets out a random shout, no one turns to look at us angrily.  Our waiter was super friendly, super efficient.  We had more chips without asking, our beverages were empty for seconds before he was asking if we needed another.  Fantastic service.  The food was amazeballs.  Sometimes you go to to restaurant for Restaurant Week and their portions are embarassingly small and to get a regular sized meal, you have to upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.  Not so at Chicago q!  I had the grilled shrimp and grits and they were delicious.  I was especially grateful that the lemon butter came on the side because I'm not a citrus fan.  For an entree I had the full slab of babyback ribs.  Fall of the bone delicious!  I liked the mustard and hot sauces the best, I'm kinda sad I forgot to ask for some to go.  Because, of course, there was SO MUCH FOOD that I have half a slab of ribs waiting for me to consume for dinner.  For dessert I had the cookies and milk.  One was chocolate chip and the other was oatmeal, raisin and CANDIED BACON.  Mmmmm.  We'll be back because even without the Restaurant Week discount, the food is super affordable and, more importantly, awesome."
"Visited on a Saturday with a 6:15 reservation.  We waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready.  The bar and restaurant were pretty busy (no empty tables that we could see).  The complimentary barbeque chips were very good.  The pickles, not so much.  And this comes from a guy that has no less than 5 different kinds of pickles in his fridge at any one time.  We started with the hush puppies which were pretty good.  The outside is dusted with what seemed like the same seasoning as the chips.  I really expected more taste from the bacon and cheddar.  The sauce was a nice compliment.  Kind of a cream cheesy thousand island sauce.  For entrees my gf got the beef ribs and I the brisket.  The server explained that all of Q's meats are dry rubed.  I'm not much of a rib guy but my gf said they were very good.  I AM a brisket guy and was disappointed.  IMO, the brisket was sliced too thin (maybe 1/8"") which deprived it of juices and the much desired bark.  Now I understand that barbeque chefs generally excel at one item or another but rarely hit the mark on everything.  So given the many types of ribs available, that would seem to be the focus here.  But if true, then price the other items accordingly.  Four sauces are offered and I found the combination of the North Carolina vinegar-based sauce and the spicy sauce to be my favorite for the brisket.  I admit that when the brisket was drenched in sauce it improved.  But that shouldn't be necessary.  The fries were ok along with the cornbread.  I won't go back for the brisket as there are better choices in the city but might be willing to try some of the other sandwich options."
"Three of my favorite words in the English language: meat, meat, meat.You'll find all three at Chicago Q! Yes folks, get your meat here, with a side of old fashioned southern hospitality. There's no way you can leave this place hungry (well, maybe if you're a vegetarian). And for being the classy, ""upscale"" BBQ joint that it is, your wallet won't be hit as hard as you might think. I mean, the place isn't cheap, but the prices are totally reasonable, especially for a Gold Coast, sit-down, cloth napkin (which may actually be a towel) type place.Some things you might want to start with: pickles & chips. Those are gratis, and they continue to flow as long as you can eat them. The pickles are good and chips are freaking awesome, but don't fall into the trap of eating too much of them. Save room for meat! I also suggest: corn bread, fried green tomatoes, hushpuppies. They're all good and come in a big, sharable portion.The meat is good, and comes in heaping helpings. I won't say this is the best BBQ I've had, but it's definitely good. On my most recent visit I got the BBQ flight, which is technically an appetizer, but I don't care. It was a meal to me! It comes with small bowls of brisket, pulled chicken and pulled pork. The pork was my favorite, followed by the chicken. The brisket was a bit chewy for me. It also comes with three generous hunks of honey butter cornbread, which as I've already mentioned is good. It's also quite sweet, so be prepared for that. There are four sauces that come out for the table, one ""spicy"" which I liked but didn't find terribly hot, a mustard sauce, a North (east?) Carolina vinegar-based sauce and a traditional brown sweet sauce. They're all pretty good, so try them yourself and find your favorite. I like the decor. The place has two stories, with the upstairs partially overlooking the downstairs. It has a warm, homey atmosphere, but it's busy and does get loud. The service is good; friendly staff and frequent refills (of water and chips).One closing tip: If you don't want to be mistaken as a member of staff, don't wear a plaid shirt."
One of my favorite BBQ places.   You have to get the hush puppies and the ribs are fantastic.   Carrot cake tops the meal off.
"As someone who is not normally a ""BBQ Person""....consider me a convert.  This meal was absolutely divine.  The drinks were fantastic, the food was heavenly, and our server was very patient with our large group.  I was even pleasantly surprised at how reasonably priced the food is for the amazing quality.  You can really taste the TLC they're putting on every plate.  Specific highlights for me:-Housemade pickles to start, great freebie vs. just the usual bread-The Cornbread!  Comes with every dish (I think) and is crazy good.--I got the pulled pork/chicken combo plate and it was a wonderful way to try both meats and really sample all the sauces.--The Mac & Cheese!  Its really rich so I recommend getting it for the table to share.Will absolutely be back the next time I'm in Chicago."
"Like Adele and the movie The Artist, Chicago q is very good but not as great as you've probably heard -1) Beef ribs are a rare find in general but to advertise them as kobe ribs and to charge $35 for 3 bones? I couldn't taste it but still very good.2) The ""Competition slab of ribs"" we got were good but not worthy of a blue ribbon or the $9 premium over a slab of their regular ribs. Needs more char for crispy bark. But flavor was excellent and appreciate that sauces are served on the side.         4) The complimentary pickles were the tastiest and best bread & butter pickle chips I ever ate in my life."
"We came unknowing of the Chicago q's spotlight on Showdown with Bobby Flay (Chicago q won). However, the ribs.............The restaurant has the attitude and decor for a fine dining establishment, but I was truly expecting mouthwatering ribs - as I should with any BBQ joint. What came to the table was entirely underwhelming.The set of BBQ sauces that accompanied the ribs was an excellent touch, but the true meat-tarian in me believes that ribs should be marinaded and cooked in sauce. This way you have some of that sweet caramelization that appears on the grilled/cooked ribs. Chicago q's ribs seemed to have been cooked bare (maybe salt and pepper) and then solely served with BBQ sauces to top on the side. A friend also got the pulled chicken sandwich, and it was the same - BBQ sauces on the side. Severely disappointing. It should be up to the restaurant's discretion to create the distinct taste of the dish.Also we inquired about the difference between St. Louis and Baby Back ribs. We were given the explanation that St. Louis would be more marbled, fuller flavor and Baby Back more meaty, lean, less marbled - similar analogy (I took) of Rib eye to Round cut respectively. In short, we were much more satisfied with the Baby Back - and there was much more tender meat in the Baby Back. (Get the Baby Back). I'd love to come back, but really have zero inclination to come back. Okay, maybe the homemade pickles and chips. But THE MEAT...cmon...unnecessarily pretentious and expensive."
"Food was very good, and the bourbon list was extensive. Mint julep was excellent. It was quite loud inside but overall I had a very good experience."
"Awesome! We shared the slider trio, bacon hush puppies and the seasonal vegetables. While I would normally avoid seasonal veggies ( for fear of being over cooked or bland) they were amazing! Roasted brussel sprouts with button mushrooms, walnuts and blue cheese. The complimentary chips and pickles were awesome too. We'll definitely be back."
"food was amazing an the service was great. definitely get the combo of kobe brisket, pulled pork and ribs. cocktails were great as well. loved the building as wełl."
I took my wife and mother and father here for diner.  We loved it.  The food was wonderful and the bbq was exceptional.  The only down side was the cole slaw.  We mentioned this to the server and she gave us all free desert with apologies.After our meal the waiter took us on a tour of the kitchen and showed us the smoker and where all of the food is prepared.  It was a great experience and I am thinking of taking the whole family there for christmas.  A++++++
"Great food and mostly good service. A large group of us (16) did a group package/private room prix fixe meal. We had one waiter and a few runners who were easily able to handle the large group and keep the unlimited drinks full. However, during the last 30 minutes of the unlimited drinks they slowly stopped refilling (drink package was for 2 hours). This was not well received when the next interaction we had with the waiter was his sales pitch to purchase a la carte alcohol. I hope that they can stay true to their word for groups, deals, and prix fixe meals when they give specific terms and conditions.Food Review:BBQ Chips - kettle style, thicker chips, but I honestly couldn't tell the difference from store bought.Pickles - barely could call them pickles. These were some sad wilted cucumbers that I wouldn't allow to be called pickles for lack of flavor, crunch, and quality.Pulled pork - Excellent.Ribs - Full rack varied only slightly on cooked temperature. The ends of the rack fell off the bone in perfect rib fashion, however the mid bones left a little to be desired. Carrot cake - rich, creamy frosting with a solid moist cake. A little on the heavy side, but that's exactly how I expect my CC.BBQ sauces - after warming up the the vinegar, I came to really enjoy it. The mild & hot were solid homemade complex blended sauces but definitely catered to the traditionalists in the group.Overall, I would visit again for the food but I'll stick to a small table with just the girlfriend."
"chicago q,i love you.my boyfriend and i went here for the first time for thanksgiving dinner...and geez what a presentation!mouthwatering turkey, mashed potatoes, and the moment the sweet potatoes made it to my mouth i felt like i could of died and floated away to heaven. really... they were THAT good.oh and hello hello .... the service!these people were the sweetest, most genuine wait staff we have experienced here since moving to chicago.our water glasses were never empty, everything was clean and well presented, and on top of it all (since we are two 23 year olds) we weren't treated any differently then all the large families there for thanksgiving dinner.since we live right on division, we were slapping ourselves on the wrists for never checking out this place sooner.thank-you chicago q for making our thanksgiving dinner away from home such a great experience!:)would highly recommend for anyone looking for a great night out in the gold coast!"
"They had me with the pickles and chips.Hands-down the best pickles that have ever passed my lips.  THE BEST.  The housemade potato chips are damn addictive too.How was the rest of the food?  Well, very good, but it's the pickles that have me salivating over a week later.It was a feast.  Those exquisite pickles and fantastic potato chips to start.  An order of bacon cheddar hush puppies, a bit pedestrian but greatly enhanced by the spicy dipping sauce.  Then the main courses--for me, a half slab of baby back ribs and pulled brisket.  The ribs were huge sticks of near-perfect meat.  The brisket was a weaker option but paired brilliantly with their mustard sauce, one of the best examples that I've found of this too-rare barbecue sauce option.Sides, you say?  How about an enormous pile of creamy, tangy cole slaw?  Jazz that up with a few twists of black pepper, and enjoy.  A little crock of bubbling macaroni and cheese may not be the best you've had, but will match up well with the orgy of meat on the table.Dessert?  Of course.  Milk and cookies, my friends.  Milk.  And.  Cookies.  That's one oatmeal and candied bacon--superb as just an oatmeal cookie; one s'mores--dry and not as sweet as you'd think, but with a delightful drizzle of melted marshmallow; and one double chocolate-chip--a gooey, fantastic mess of an outstanding cookie.  Glorious.All that wonderful food (and a couple of solid cocktails) was served and whisked away by a legion of staff who have mastered the art of being helpful and attentive without smothering.  They were kind enough to seat our group without our missing member.  As the night wore on and our friend never showed up, the waiter was kind enough not to mention him and never rushed us to order.  I also appreciated that he offered a taste of the cole slaw upon my request for a description.  Those are the little touches that elevate a dining experience.  Between the service and the food, I will surely be back.In the meantime, I have to find out if they sell those pickles by the jar."
"Checked out Chicago Q and was not disapointed! Our waitress recommended the chili and the Beatbobbyflay Pulled Pork Sandwich.  We licked our plates clean, the sauces were good but more than anything it was the quality in meat."
"By far the best BBQ place as far as an entire meal and service experience. My parents, in law's and I went in for brunch/lunch to taste test the menu for a private event and were all blown away. Seema, easily the best waitress I've ever had, made our experience flawless and we couldn't say enough about each course of food. Fried green tomatoes, hush puppies, shrimp and grits and a poblano Gouda filled sausage to start, followed by a myriad of lunch and brunch choices. Did I mention the crispy pig powder chips and butter pickles placed on the table when we say down? Yum! The pulled chicken and St Louis ribs beat any BBQ place I've ever been to. Can't wait for the event we have there and to go again for a perfect plate of BBQ and hopefully Seema is our waitress. She is a class act, a great salesperson, and customer oriented."
"Went for restaurant week 2014. The rw menu was limited but filled with quality. Wife and I purchased all three entrees and shared all. The pork shoulder was melt in your mouth perfect, the kobe brisket was cooked to perfection and the St. Louis ribs were worth the trip down there to fight for street parking! We couldn't get enough of the pickles and bbq chips they provide. Don't even get me started on the cornbread! I can only say, WOW! We will be adding Chicago q to our eating out rotation. It's a must try in Chicago for upscale bbq in Chicago."
"Ok, I'm kinda bummed that I can't give them more stars, and I am really just writing about my experience on Thanksgiving Day, which could have been better.There were 5 of us, and we were quickly seated in quieter area - on a balcony overlooking the main dining room below. It was rather isolated, but at least we could hear each other talk. The atmosphere was bustling, festive, and fun.Service was prompt, and upon getting our drinks, we ordered the family style Thanksgiving dinner ($195, serves 6-9). We're thinking this is going to be a ton of food. I mean, it serves up to 9 people, right?So I probably shouldn't complain about food coming out TOO fast, but it came out very quickly (like, maybe we could've finished half a drink and relaxed a bit before eating)...but we were hungry and ready to dig in, so I don't think anyone minded too much.The half turkey is placed on the table, which is quite large enough for the group (and I would imagine for up to 9 people)...and then the sides. Um, here is where I start having an issue with the place. The sides are in these little dishes, like a 5-inch plate with a rim....I'd say enough for 2 people to share, not 5, and definitely not 9! Seriously, if 9 people were sharing these sides, I don't even think they would've gotten two green beans each!So, upon seeing these sides (thinking I could eat this thing of mashed potatoes all by myself), we immediately order another round of everything (except for cranberries and rolls). But even when the second set came, we were still all taking polite little spoonfuls (Dear family members, if I was taking more than my share, please retroactively accept my apologies). I should mention that the food was EXCELLENT! And we wanted more! The mashed potatoes were particularly popular, and it is the only side that we requested a THIRD helping of. But guess what! We were told by the server that it would be 30 minutes, as they were out of mashed potatoes...at 5:00 on Thanksgiving, with a packed house! Wow, Sux2b them!So dessert. Traditional choices...pumpkin pie, bread pudding, I forget what else (nephew requested pecan pie, but I'm not sure if that was one of the choices). Anyway, they bring the dessert, and upon putting the first plate down, I'm thinking that it's so large that it must be for the table...but no, each of us who ordered bread pudding got a ginormous slab, with a dollop of ice cream (I would suggest twice the ice cream, and maybe 1/4 of the bread pudding, as a more appropriate ratio). I actually would've preferred more mashed potatoes to the slab-o-dessert (as good as it was).Now if 9 people are having this family style dinner, there are 9 desserts served for the same price that we pay for 5 people. It doesn't make sense. I think it should be a per person charge (and they might make more money that way, actually).Anyway, the kicker is that we (and by ""we"", I mean my sister, who paid....thanks, Donna!) were charged for all these sides that we ordered additionally. I really would think that the family style should provide ample food (within reason) for the table, including a satisfactory amount of side dishes.Like I say though, the food was excellent, but this family style thing was quite flawed. I just couldn't help but feel a little cheated....just glad there wasn't 9 of us!Next year I think I'm just going to have to cook, dangit!"
"By far the best food I have had in a long time! The Mac and Cheese makes you wanna shout ""mmm mmm good""! The mashed potatoes are lumps of heaven. The brisket... is this beef? Holy Cow! Tender, Juicy and seasoned to a T! Expect excellent service, homemade potatoes chips and pickles! They also over valet! I enjoyed my birthday here and would love to go back over and over and over and over again!Real chefs use real butter! Love it!"
"Chicago Q... how thankful I am that you opened up down the street from me.  First, I love the way they mix it up with the pickles and chips appetizer.  Soo good.  And one time, my group had to wait awhile for our table, so they gave us a free app. Can't argue with that service!I've tried just about everything here... the pulled chicken, the pulled pork, and all the different BBQ sauces.  You can find what you like!  As far as sides, the mac and cheese is really good, but I'd say the cornbread and fries are just *okay.*  Mostly, I just love the concept.  It's a classy barbecue spot.  I've always had great service here too, and it's right in the city.  I'll be back."
"From my experience, this is the best BBQ in Chicago.  And before you fill my inbox with hate mail and death threats, I will admit I've never been to Smoque. What's that you say?  Really? Saying you've never been to Smoque on Yelp actually evokes MORE hate mail and death threats. alrighty, guess it's time to change my name and city of residence...again.Let's get back to the business at hand, Chicago q.  To be perfectly honest, I really can't think of a single time that I've eaten BBQ and not been fully satiated by my experience.  If given the option of eating Sushi or Dumpster Ribs, I would have to clarify whether the Dumpster Ribs were safely inside their styrofoam container before making my decision.  And like I said before, Chicago q is the best BBQ I've had in Chicago.  The Brisket is the Shiznit.Ok even I'm ashamed of that last one, I'm gonna give myself a time out."
"I'm a born and raised Texas beef brisket barbecue girl who was probably eating it second-hand in the womb and never stopped since. I married a born and raised Memphis pork barbecue man who is pretty much the same. I may not know how to cook it myself at home (because I'm super lazy in the kitchen) but I know good barbecue when it's on the end of my fork. And q here is good barbecue.I got my grubby little barbecue-loving hands on every single kind of meat they offer here, with the exception of the $305 pork shoulder. (When I go back to Chicago next August, I fully intend to spend my 5-day allotment of dinner money on that pork shoulder and just eat it for the rest of my stay. Maybe. Probably.) I can personally vouch that every single kind of meat they offer is tasty as hell. The kobe beef brisket was especially remarkable - juicy and tender without being overly fatty.The service was a little hilarious though. We had 4-5 people waiting on us throughout the night and none seemed to be communicating with each other (which is how I ended up with a metric ton of chips to take home, not that I'm complaining), but they were all still incredibly attentive. Their lack of communication only benefited us in the end!"
"Great BBQ, cocktails. Probably the ""nicest"" BBQ place I've been to, service is good. The place is pretty solid."
"If you're looking for an ""upscale"" BBQ joint, this is the place for you.  The decor here is great - looks like a trendy, Southern home on the inside.  The BBQ is also pretty good, although, I still think the selections at Smoque are better.  My table and I ended up trying most of the menu, from the brisket, to the dry rubbed wings.  We also got racks of the ""Competition"" Baby Back and St. Louis ribs.  I found the wings to be quite good, but the pork ribs were not that impressive -- at least not at the price of $35 a rack.  It was good, but almost a bit too fall off the bone tender where you lose some of the pork flavor.  The bruleed mac and cheese here is fantastic though, so get that.  Didn't try any of the ""regular ribs,"" but I am sure they will be decent. Service here was also pretty good, so all in all, a solid spot in the city for BBQ."
"True story: at age 6, I out-ate my father and my uncle (combined) in bbq ribs.  Ah, to be young and possess that childhood metabolism again.  The point is, I've been a bbq fanatic for longer than I care to admit.  I've paid my fair share of visits to the bbq places in Chicago and yet, I think my favorite up until now has been good ole Dad's homemade ribs.  Enter Chicago q.  Despite my affinity for bbq, I actually haven't had the ribs here, seeing as though my only visit so far has been for a bachelorette party and I decided to go with something more, well, ladylike.  While the chopped kobe brisket sandwich rocked my face off, I think I actually preferred the pulled pork.  I loved that they gave you all the sauces to put on yourself.  In my champagne buzz, I may have poured all of them all over my entire plate, but whatever, it was still delicious.        Pretty much everything here was top notch, from the free pickles and chips to the mac and cheese, to the cocktails.  I will certainly be planning a return trip sometime soon."
We had a very fun and laid back Chicago Q NYE consisting of tasty cocktails and yummy bbq. Highlights of the meal were the hushpuppies and mac and cheese. The sliced kobe brisket was a little dry but the accompanying sauces made up for it. Service was fantastic with both our server and the bus boy humoring our camera happy group. My favorite way to end a New Year's Eve celebration is in fat pants in bed in a food coma ... Mission Accomplished!
"We've been wanting to try Q forever and when we got the chance a few days ago, we took it.  We had a 5:30 reservation on a Friday.  The place was pretty empty when we were seated, but by 6pm it was packed.  We enjoyed the complimentary pickles and chips.  You just can't go wrong with a crunchy potato chip!I ordered the smoked half chicken.  The waiter mentioned that it would look pink because of the way the meat reacted to the smoke but assured that it was cooked all the way through.  My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  It took no time flat to receive our order, which was almost weird.  I'm not going to complain about getting yummy food really fast though! The chicken was great.  Juicy and well seasoned.  I'm not one for bbq sauce (one of the only, I'm sure in a bbq restaurant!) but I did like their mustard sauce.  Very yummy.  My husband used the spiciest one, I forget the name.  He liked his sandwich.  I tried it and commented that it almost tasted like a roast meat.  The pretzel bun was yummy too.I saved room for dessert.  I just had to!  We tried the cherry cobbler, which was very good.  Not too sweet, just enough.  Loved it!Very enjoyable experience.  We look forward to our next visit!!"
"Chicago Q specializes in barbeque and is located in the action packed Rush Street area on Chicago's near north side that is loaded with restaurants and bars.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and has several separate dining areas and a small bar. On a Sunday evening during Restaurant Week my wife and I accompanied by four of our friends dined all for the first time at this eatery.  We had a reservation for 6:00 p.m., and we all arrived within a couple of minutes of one another around 5:45 p.m.  The bar was filled so we opted to be seated.  Within a few minutes we were escorted to our table that was in a semi-private room in front of the restaurant that accommodates approximately 20 or so people.My wife and I ordered from the $44 prix fixe menu.  Our starters included fried green tomatoes that were good but not remarkable.  My wife had the beef brisket that was tender and flavorful.  I had the baby back ribs that were served with three different sauces on the side.  The ribs were tender and good but not exceptional.  The sauces were interesting but nothing special.  For sides we each had coleslaw that was just average and hominy and black beans that was somewhat flavorless and disappointing. The entire table shared an order of the restaurant's touted Yukon gold potato salad at an extra cost that was just average and clearly overpriced.  For dessert we had the carrot cake, which was tasty and rich, and cookies that were average. Overall, we had an enjoyable dining experience at Chicago Q.  However, the quality of the food was mixed, and my ribs didn't leave me with a craving to come back anytime soon.  The atmosphere was comfortable and the service was competent and unhurried. Valet parking is available, as well as metered street parking, but good luck trying to find a spot. I believe there is much better barbeque in Chicago than the fare served at Chicago Q and a lot less pricey."
This place is never disappointing from the gourmet cornbread to the variety of amazing BBQ entrees. Q has some real touches that make it special. Every meal starts with their house made chips and fresh pickles and the entrees are served with a variety of their house barbecue sauces all very special in their own way.  I will caution that on a Saturday night the place gets LOUD making it not a great spot for an intimate weekend date but with a group it's great. Service was speedy we never waited long for anything we asked for. Will be back in the future.
Everything was pretty amazing. From the potato chips to the ribs to the Brisket to the sides. Everything was extremely tasty and tender. The portions were huge is great for groups. The space is very comforting - with a fireplace and mini lounge on the second floor. Great service.
Great BBQ place.Wonderful wine list.Please give it a try. Service was good.
"I have been here several times since BBQ Pitmaster Lee Ann Whippen and her partners opened this upscale BBQ restaurant in a swanky part of Chicago.First of all--let's put the price issue aside. Your are going to a restaurant in a part of town that is known for upscale dining. Charging $26.00 for these extremely high quality ribs is not outrageous.Baby backs will cost a couple bucks more, but save these for your visit to Carsons and order the St Louis Spare ribs here.Although I feel that the ribs are generally a bit over-cooked--slow smoked for hours, the quality and flavor is fantastic.The pulled pork in terms of proper smoke techique and quality is probably the best in the city.The four sauces-mild, spicy, Carolina mustard and vinegar are all top notch.The complimentary bbq potato chips are great-served slightly warm and not too salty.A special MONSTER SHOUT OUT for the spicy bread and butter pickles w/onion.These are addictive, perfect for your pulled pork sandwich and simply delicious. I cannot imagine how anyone could not like these. But hey, different strokes...Now, $9.00 for the cheddar/bacon Hushpuppies sounds outrageous. Especially when you tend to get ""regular"" hushpuppies as a complimentary bread basket when you are in the South. But these little things are great. Six large puppies served with a chipotle mayo dipping sauce. Hey, we are near the Gold Coast here. Worth it? Maybe not. Get em? Definitely!Certain ""little"" things that are annoying would have to include the $3.00 8 oz bottles of Coke. The way I drink 'em it would cost me a fortune. So I limit myself to one.Bourbon options are abundant but severely ""measured"". Beer options are interesting and appropriate and not terribly overpriced. Wine selections are also not a rip-off.One note : if you plan to order a ""proper pulled pork sandwich"". Since you will have to have cole slaw with it, make sure that you ask for it in a separate bowl, otherwise it will run all over your plate. You would think that they would know better.So overall, a bit pricey for bbq but as a treat if you are in that part of the city, it is worth it."
"Did Chicago q's Thanksgiving dinner with a GrubWithUs group -- my first grub.Had an overpriced Balvenie at the bar after arriving early, while I browsed the web and played Angry Birds on my Kindle Fire via q's 3 WiFi zones. Ran into a gentleman at the bar with a Kindle 3G, which gave us a great conversation topic while I waited for my group and he waited for his meal.The smoked free-range turkey was nothing short of AWESOME. From the minute I walked in the door, the smell of BBQ had me tempted to skip the traditional turkey meal, but the turkey was totally worth it. Juicy, smokey, falling apart in the just the right places. The meal was served family-style, passing serving dishes, and I feel the amount of turkey was a bit lacking, but it made up for lack of quantity in volume of awesomeness.Somehow q was out of mashed potatoes -- how do you pull that on Thanksgiving? Fortunately one of our grubbers thought to ask for mac 'n' cheese as a replacement, and the mac 'n' cheese was definitely in my top 5 ever. The candied yams? sweet potatoes? were good, but almost TOO good -- too much candy, not enough veggie. Great complement to the smokey turkey however.Drink service during the meal was a bit slow -- I got my second beer just about as I finished my food.Will definitely be going back for traditional BBQ, and will review again."
"As a South Carolinian transplant in Chicago, as soon as I found out about Chicago Q I knew I had to try it out. I have been multiple times over the past couple years and am never disappointed.The decor of the restaurant is very warming and comfortable while at the same time semi-upscale. It looks like an old house and sitting upstairs you really feel like you are eating in someone's home!Every meal starts out with free chips and pickles, both of which are AMAZING. Seriously, I sometimes want to come here just to eat these. I was never a big pickle fan, but Q's pickles are out of this world. They should sell them on the side, I know lots of people would buy them. As for the main courses, I have tried almost all of the meats (chicken, beef, pulled pork) and they all are great. Barbeque can really vary by location (SC is all pulled pork) but I would say that Q doesn't fit one style, they really do all meats well. The sauces are also very good, every table is presented with 4 sauces (from mild to spicy) for everyone to try. For sides, the cornbread is really good, as is the coleslaw.For the location, prices aren't bad, service is good and the food is delicious, I will definitely keep coming back!"
"food was great but prices for the kobe beef ribs were misleading. price on the menu was $75 and the server said we could have a half order. they still charged $75 for the ribs and said that this was the price for a half order, even though the menu said different. wrote to the restaurant with no response.ordered a lot of food and enjoyed it very much but this problem with the price left me with a bad feeling."
"Do not believe all the hype about OTHER BBQ spots in the city: THIS is the best BBQ joint in town! The pickles and BBQ chips they give you for starters are delicious and addicting. All the sides I've had are amazing, but the Pulled Pork is out of this world. Not to mention their great variety of sauces. Last but not least, the place is SO pretty inside. I love the blue leather and white walls, so cozy. Love, love, love."
I've eaten here 3 or 4 times and enjoy the food more every visit.The pickles and chips when you first sit down: fantastic.All meat dishes: incredible.Finish the meal off with some scotch and you have yourself a good night of eating right there.
I've been meaning to review this place for awhile--since I've been about 5 times now and plan to make many more visits. If you love southern bbq food- GO. The cornbread. I drool thinking about it. Let alone all the meats and sauces. Absolutely mouth watering. The BRISKET. Get it. Just get it. I will go until I've tried everything on the menu. And then repeat...
I went here for the first time yesterday and ordered the St. Louis ribs.  They were DELICIOUS.  The half rack was more than enough for one person.  I've been told the pulled pork is also very good.  Definitely look forward to going back and trying other items on their menu.
"Okay, this is my new favorite BBQ place anywhere. Upscale clientele (was glad I had a sports coat) mix with shorts and jerseys but it leans toward the nicer end of the scale. Asked the waiter what I needed to eat--""Brisket"" without any hesitation. This is usually a danger zone for me: they always say that and the nasty, dry, fatty brisket disappoints. Oh no, not so here! Had brisket, ribs, pulled pork combo and, while it was all good, the brisket was indeed the best thing on the plate. Corn bread, beans, and greens were all good too... But it's all about the brisket, baby!"
"Highly recommended! I'm in love with this place. Mouth watering ribs, incredible butter pickles. The bar is gorgeous  and stacked!"
"A female barbecuer who beat Bobby Flay at a Throwdown?  Yee haw!  I was excited to try the bbq here and it did not disappoint.  I ordered the bbq  flight as my meal so I could sample as much as possible (brisket, pulled pork, and chicken), and my hubby ordered the ribs so I had all my bases covered.The appetizer portion was generous and came with thick slices of cornbread topped with sweet butter, and the meat was delectably, deliciously tender.  The meat comes dry-drubbed and they bring out the array of bbq sauces, which is a nice combination of flavors.  I only wish the sauces had come the way ALL good barbecue sauces should come - in big squirt bottles instead of tiny thimbles because after all, if you've got it...flaunt it!  And it's barbecue sauce doggone it, not truffle-pate-whatsit-sauce.  Cue me up for Chicago q!"
"Pretty dead for a Monday lunch. Service was just ok. I think our waiter was in a bad mood. Amazing fixed price lunch too!! Reasonable prices and they have sweet tea!! BBQ sauces are pretty bland, I was kind of disappointed in this. Meat was good tho."
"You know, I wasn't expecting this place to be nearly as good as it was. It is a SOLID four star place. The outdoor patio is really nice, the food is excellent. The hush puppies were great, but too many for two people to share. The corn bread was a little less buttery/moist then I like, but still very good. The BBQ was a little less ""fall apart"" than it could have been, but the spicy sauce was AWESOME. The mac n cheese was really really good too...Great service too. I would totally go here again"
"Having spent a good chunk of my life in Tennessee I have had my share of amazing BBQ. I have lived in Chicago 4 years now and still have yet to find better BBQ. Q Is the best! Everything from the refined casual atmosphere, service, food, and consistency makes Q my favorite restaurant in Chicago!!!"
"I live in the neighborhood and have walked by q for over a year now. I've been dying to go and last night I did! It was a great atmosphere, love how they give you pickles and bbq chips when you sit down, but our waiter... was WASTED!!! It took about 45 minutes to get a bud light and then the beer brought out wasn't even the right one but we just took it because we'd already waited a while for a beer.... the most disturbing part about it was her co-workers and management continued to let her work in her drunken state. I work in hospitality and was referred by our concierge and I'm going to have a hard time referring future guests here if this is how they allow business to run. Aside from that the food wasn't bad. It was cold... probably because our waiter was so drunk and forgot about it... but not bad overall. Not sure if I'll be back. So disappointing because I've been waiting a year to visit :/"
"The meat, the sauce and the sides all made this the right choice for dinner on NYE. Because I wanted to try as much meat as I could, I had the BBQ flight as my entree. All three (Kobe brisket, pulled pork and chicken) were delicious with that nice smokey flavor. The 4 sauces pack some flavor, with the original mild and North Carolina Vinegar being my favorite. My only complaint has to do with the chicken. The meat is served in cups, and at first I thought the chicken was kinda soggy, but I didn't realize how soggy till I saw liquid at the bottom of the cup.  When it comes to looking for something to accompany your meat, you can't go wrong with the cornbread, fries, hush puppies or mac n' cheese.  If it weren't so pricey, I'd come back more often."
"I loved loved loved the decor and ambiance of this restaurant. Like many in Chicago, especially those on Halsted in the Lincoln Park area, this gem has a cutesy white little house on the outside, but once you step in, it opens up into this super welcoming, high ceiling, two-floor classy dining room with an open kitchen at the very end. Food was pretty amazing. - Cannot get enough of those home made BBQ chips with a hint of sweetness. They could sell a lot of these and it's fine if they don't stay crispy coz if I buy them they ain't gonna last more than one night.- Baby ribs were so extremely tender. Comes with four different kinds of sauces which were all amazing and they complimented the meat very well.- Smoked half chicken was slightly under cooked but tender and smokey. It was very very hard to eat with fork and knife. So it's prolly not a good idea to order this on a date.- Pulled pork sandwich was the same thing one of my friends ordered on her two visits here and I loved how they used pretzel bun. Huge portion too.- Honey cornbread was delicious. I loved how it had more texture than the others I had tried. The drizzled honey and butter made it even better.- Fries were nothing special though. I was not wowed.I really enjoyed our NYE dining experience here. This restaurant just makes you feel happy. It's like down to earth hard core super southern food - elevated to a classy level."
"Sometimes we all just get the strong desire to trade the urban, quotidian chaos for a breath of Southern comfort.  At Chicago q, you can do just that without having to leave the liberal city boundaries.  With a little bit of class (without following the trend of Gold Coast pretentiousness), plenty of charm and a lot of Southern flavors, q is definitely a pleaser.  The ambience is full of light colors that open up to a spacious oasis of glossy hardwood floors, large light fixtures mingling with skylights, and enlarged photographs of centuries old oak trees lining country roads which continue as far as the eye can see.  I love me some tea so I cooled down with a glass of iced Southern-style sweet tea.  The hospitable servers start you out with complimentary sweet pickles and cinnamon potato chips.  I was in love and thankfully had a huge appetite that day.  As addictive as these two are, q has been put on the map due to their BBq techniques and recipes involving numerous house-made rubs and a variety of woods for smoking their meats.  Chef Lee Ann Whippen has won countless awards in barbeque competitions across the nation, but has also starred on TLC's ""BBQ Pitmasters"" and the Food Network's ""Throwdown with Bobby Flay.""  She cooks the true backyard-style smoked meats, yet serves them within q's modern, comfortable environment.  Q offers their very own ""Competition"" ribs every evening, but with a limited supply so make your OpenTable reservation somewhat early to get your hands on a slab.  With so many meats to choose from and my indecisive habits, I started off with the BBq Flight appetizer combining q's kobe brisket (I LOOOVED their South Carolina mustard sauce with it), pulled pork and pulled chicken--each with three sauces to mix 'n match.  Your meal wouldn't be complete without some communal sides.  A few favorites of mine are the house bacon cheddar hush puppies, classic corn bread with honey butter, and the sharp-flavored brûléed macaroni and cheese.  I surely got a taste of why Paula Dean makes all of her silly faces and moans.  I'll be sure to make another trip to q in the near future when my carnivorous teeth are craving some meat.Awarded Review of the Day in Chicago, Illinois on 09/25//2011!"
"Granted this place isn't cheap, but if you want to impress a special someone or have a well deserved celebration, this is a good place to go. You have to love meat to come here. I wouldn't if I was a vegetarian. Their brisket is amazing, and they have four different sauces for you to try, with their spicy ones being my personal favorite (I can't remember if it was the Carolina one or just the bbq).Their portions were very generous, and even with a sandwich you'll probably have left overs, since they bring you some sort of bread while you wait on. We ordered some pickles for appetizers and they were amazingly good.I didn't really think they had a great selection on beers, but maybe that was just me.Their service was outstanding though, with our water glasses always full, the bread always kept on coming and our order coming on time. Our waitress was a bit slow but other servers helped speed up the process for us, so we didn't feel we missed out. On top of this, the place is gigantic and we were seated on the second level, which had a sort of living room area with a fireplace and a couch. Really comfy, and nobody minded us straying over there after the meal.They also have a coat check and it's free, and their outside area is really romantic. This is worth the trip."
"Good- The hostesses were friendly and inviting. I also came for restaurant week and I liked the selections they chose for the menu. The homemade potato chips are so good. Our party enjoyed the southern-yet-classy atmosphere here. Eh- Granted, we were a party of 7, but the main course should not have taken half an hour to arrive. When the entree finally came, the ribs were a bit overcooked and dry. I had high expectations for the ribs here and thought they were mediocre. Bad-When some of us told the server we were sharing for the restaurant menu, he made a disappointed nod at us, but come on, how many people can finish a whole rack of ribs by themselves? I told them it was my birthday when I made the reservation but there was nothing special about the dinner."
"I'ld recommend the competition baby backs; pretty tender and no sauce necessary.  Mac and cheese was extra cheesy and the greens were green (mustard, kale, collards). #KCapproved late addition: *i'ld recommend sitting at the bar though after just witnessing someone take something out of a just poured Johnny walker red with their finger *blankstare* lost half a star on that"
"The adorable and romantic chateau cottage exterior (which is oh so charming) did not at all prepare me for the AMAZING Southern BBQ menu and meal I was about to experience. Yum. Yum. Yum. The Hush Puppies made for a perfect starter (after the BBQ Chips and Pickles that came on the table) but coupled with the chipotle mayo, I started to fill up and wasn't quite prepared for the huge portions that were to follow. Half slab of St. Louis Ribs came with a heaping mound of delicious coleslaw and each rib literally fell off the bone piece by piece. Our waiter brought out four sauces and each was outstanding, but even without the ribs were so tasty. I cannot wait to return and indulge in those ribs again, and maybe try the mac n cheese and bourbon flights, which were both quite tempting."
"Great atmosphere and fantastic BBQ! Loved the BBQ chips and bread and butter pickles they bring you when you sit down. We had the crab cakes which I was quite impressed with from a BBQ restaurant. They weren't dry and there were two if them, perfect since there was two of us! We also had the combination sliders which consist of brisket, pulled pork, and chicken. And my favorite part was it came with corn bread served with choice of sweet or savory butter. We choose the honey butter and it was delicious! Will definitely be back!"
"We went to Chicago Q on a Sunday for lunch.  Chicago q has an outdoor eating area and most of the guests when I arrived were seated outdoors.  My preference for air-conditioning during the summer months led me to ask for a seat inside the dining area, and we were shown to a nice four-seater booth by the wall. Surprisingly, the dining area was relatively empty and I think there were probably only 2 or 3 other tables that were occupied.  Our waitress greeted us cheerfully, while another member of the waitstaff brought us bowls of potato chips and sliced pickles to munch on.  we were pleased to see that they offered both a brunch and gulag lunch menu, but we decided to go straight to the regular lunch menu and indulge ourselves in some ribs.  My party of four shared two rib platters and a side of sautéed greens.  For the ribs, we got one full platter of their regular house ribs, and a full platter of their ""competition"" ribs.  Our server explained that an additional two hours of labor goes into the preparation of the competition ribs.  Our party, being intrigued, decided to order both regular and competition ribs so we could compare the two. Well, the competition ribs are a clear winner.  They a priced higher, but they a much more tender and tasty than their regular ribs.  They also have a little bit of a reddish coloring on the inside (but not a raw type color), compared to the regular ribs that just are brown on the inside.  The coleslaw side was vey delicious, but I was to a big fan of their cornbread side.  The sautéed greens by themselves were also a little bland, but they were done appropriately (not overcooked like some other places do southern-style greens) and did pair well with the strongly flavored ribs. We passed on the alcohol but did note their extensive bourbon list for next time.  I got an iced-tea and got a couple of refills, whereas the diet coke we ordered was priced by the small bottle; just something to be aware of. Overall, I got my rib craving satisfied.  The flavor of the competition ribs were excellent, but the meat is not the ""fall-off-the-bone"" variety you can get at a place like Smokey Bones.  Rather, it is a little more substantive, and It feels deliberately prepared this way, so you can pick up the bones and chew the meat off, rather than simply picking it all off the bone with your fork.  I suppose it all boils down to how you like to enjoy your ribs. But boy, did I enjoy mine."
"Meh. That's my review, meh. If I were to base it solely on the food, I'd give it about a 2.5. This is a nice place--you can go ""stylish casual"" in jeans or dress up, and the restaurant has the fun feel of an event-type place, but the food didn't measure up.Maybe I'm biased as a 7th-generation Southerner, or maybe I'm biased because I lived in Texas for 13 years, but the food was just alright. I had the competition ribs, and all I wanna know is, who else is entering this competition?? I'm pretty sure I could outdo these with a Crock Pot or a propane grill, both of which are abominations to the true smoke-flavoring process of real barbecue. If this place has a 4-star average, either I ordered the wrong thing (but should the worst thing on the menu fall that short??) or, just what the heck have you ppl been eating to consider this very fine barbecue??I think back to the best ribs I've ever had--those would be from Houston's, just fall off the bone tender and so flavorful you want to eat your sauce-covered fingers too. (Now, I don't wanna hear any crap from anyone about how ""fall off the bone"" means overcooked, because in my world, overcooked is tough and dry, and cooked just right means melt in your mouth.) The best barbecue in general I've ever had would go to a two-way tie between the wonderful Salt Lick in Driftwood, TX or the magically sauce-free, smoke-flavored Kreuz Market in Lockhart, TX. Both life-changing experiences.The sides were fine, but nothing memorable that would make me jump at the chance of coming back here. Service was fine. It did take quite a long time to get our check. I would want to raise this above a 2 to simply reward the nice atmosphere of the place, but Yelp says 2 stars = meh, and 3 stars = A-OK. Well, A-OK barbecue is a fail of epic proportions, since barbecue done right should basically raise the human experience to a higher plane."
"Mmm. Been here twice now 'cause it's nearby and we're (I'm) lazy. Genuinely good barbecue, plentiful servings of the complimentary chips and pickles, and plates ideal for sharing. Expect to pay marginally more than you might for a comparable meal elsewhere in the city, but you can chalk that up to its location. There's a deceptively large amount of space, as well, which is a huge bonus for me - big groups work well here. The actual waitstaff is a little hit-or-miss, but I found the bussers and even the hostess to be very attentive. We also got 10% off coupon for take-away on our last visit. Way ahead of you, Q!"
"So, we had 845 reservations, we arrive at 841, and we (party of four) was told that we would be seated ""closer to our reservation.""  Ok.Well 915, still not seated and growing concerned because my concept of time is such that the as time moves toward, we are actually getting farther away from our actual reservation.  I approached the guy ""in charge"" who was more interested in covering his behind rather than apologizing.Seated 40 minutes late, food was okay.  Certainly not worth the wait or lousy customer service."
"Spectacular!  Everything about this place exceeded our expectations including the food which was extraordinary. The entire staff was exceptional, most especially our waitress Sima who was very knowledgable and friendly. She represented Chicago q in the best possible way, proudly giving us history from the building to the recepies!  A can't miss in Chicago! We will definitely be back!"
This was a great find! Good food and server was very helpful with answering our questions. Very good Cobb salad and the pickles & chips brought out for the table to enjoy were a nice and tasty touch. I recommend you check out Q when on the Gold Coast.
"Absolutely loved Chicago Q.  Great decor and vibe in the restuarant, doesn't feel stuffy like some downtown restaurants can.  They had a pretty solid beer list which is always a plus.  The chips and pickles they start you out with are amazing!  We also had the cheddar bacon hushpuppies which I would definitely recommend.I had the pulled pork and pulled chicken entree, very flavorful.  I actually liked the chicken better of the two which is rare.  Husband had the kobe beef brisket, outstanding!  It was my husbands birthday and they provided some cookies with milk at the end as a nice treat.  Would absolutely recommend Chicago Q to someone looking for a nice, upscale barbeque experience."
"A higher-end BBQ joint that doesn't quite justify the price.I went here on a first date and we did order quite a bit of food.  They start you off with potato chips (good) and pickles (okay).I ordered the brisket with cornbread.  Both were fine, but not world-crushing.My date ordered baby back ribs and fries.  Also good, not world-crushing.We also had the greens (fine) and the cheddar bacon hush puppies (fine).Four beers between us, plus tip and I walked out $99 lighter.  Granted, we got more food than we could eat.  And I appreciated the quality service.  Plus, you get four different sauces with your barbecue.  That's a nice touch.  But I can't say anything I ate blew my mind.  It was all good, just not great.I mean, you pay $6.75 for five hush puppies.  That's $1.35 per hush puppy.  And that's steep for something the size of a donut hole.  You couldn't even really taste the cheddar or the bacon.The brisket was $20.75.  Think of what you can get elsewhere for that much money.  Hey, I'd pay that if it melted in my mouth, but it was just okay.Also, not a great date spot as it was really, really loud.I might come back, but I would order less food."
"Kudos to fellow Yelpers & especially Pamela V for the recommendation of Chicago q.  Easily some of the best BBQ we've enjoyed and especially appreciated since the unexpected and deeply regrettable closing of a GR favorite, Sandmans.Located in a unique building/house near downtown Chicago, this is a welcome stop after traveling on foot up & down the Magnificent Mile.  Although it was mid-afternoon before our tired feet found themselves crossing the threshold, the place still had a lingering smattering of patrons and we were warmly welcomed.The pickles and chips are a nice complimentary starter.  I usually don't like pickles, but after hubby tasted and indicated they were delicious, decided to try one and ended up eating several!  The seasoned chips were excellent...just the right amount of spice washed down with swigs of Sweet Tea.We ordered the 3 item sampler with pulled chicken, pulled pork and ribs.  The sauces are served on the side which made it fun to mix & match.  The meat was surprisingly flavorful on its own.  According to our waitress,  just about everything on the menu is made on site.  This includes the chips, pickles, main dishes & the desserts. For the sides, we ordered cornbread which was hearty and smothered in honey butter, macaroni and cheese and broccoli infused with pine nuts, cranberries and spring onions.  What a meal!  The waitress kept coming by to see if we were OK.  From the looks on our faces, she could tell that we were better than OK....we took a brief trip to food paradisio southern style!  Highly recommended if you're in the Chicago area & want a meal that tastes like your momma would have made it."
"This is my fiance's favorite restaurant, the barbecue is some of the best in Chicago.  We came here for his last birthday and left in a food coma thanks to the wings (yum!) and the Q2 which we split.  I love the pulled pork and the kobe brisket.  I've also taken my sister, a very picky eater, here and she said it was the best burger she's ever had.  If you come in the summer try to get a table outside!"
The food is great but not as fantastic as I would have hoped for the prices. They aren't super expensive but just not worth the money. The mac n cheese is a must try and the corn breads are so tasty! It isn't super southern or authentic even if a few dishes are great. I would recommend coming here with a larger group as the sides are overpriced and you'll want to get a couple and they are larger portions.
"BBQ in the Gold Coast? For real? For real.Yes, there will be white tablecloths and slices of Derby Pie that are about the same price as AN ENTIRE PIE (I am from Kentucky; I was sorta galled to see the price for a slice) but other than that, you'll get the real deal or, close to. I enjoyed my Mint Julep more than I should have. MJs are pretty nasty by definition (Kentuckian). This was enjoyable. It shouldn't have been. :)I was most impressed by the service. Even though you're eating bbq, the staff acts as though you're at any other white-shoe Gold Coast steakhouse. I don't think I blinked without someone catering to my needs. I can see how some might be annoyed by it, but I appreciated the attention. I think it shows they don't take their clients for granted.This is also evidenced by the food. Yes, it's bbq (for the billionth time), but they show some innovation and real care with the product. How so? BBQ Flight. Yes, a BBQ Flight: Kobe Brisket, Pulled Pork and Pulled Chicken all served with sauces and in small, shareable bunches. That way, you can check out what you like and go to town on it for your main course. Skipping ahead and noting that I could mix and match meats for the main course, I knew it was time to explore some of the other apps. The hush puppies and onion rings are as fantastic as they sound on the menu. Bacon cheddar hush puppies that are as big as racquetball (or, maybe, a squash ball). The accompanying sauce looked tasty but, also, mayonnaise-y. You know I don't play with that. I could hula-hoop with the onion rings -- buttermilk-battered goodness.The main dish was a combo of pulled pork and pulled chicken. I didn't have to choose; I got both. Loved it. And, I tried them with all the sauces. They were all delicious but my personal taste was the original recipe. Combine all that with slaw, pickled onions and cornbread and you can forget all about it. Delicious... and you'll need those white napkins... and a to-go box. I was felled by the amount of food brought to the table. Thing is, my hurt tummy made room for a happy one for lunch the next day."
"I loved there homemade pickles, so crunchy. I liked the BBQ and the 4 different sauces. I liked there own sauce and The South Carolina mustard. Which I don't normally eat a mustard type of BBQ sauce's. I picked that South Carolina mustard over the North Carolina vinegar type. I liked there mild version of BBQ .This was a treat from my sister on Christmas eve, we came by taxi. We both did have the St. Louis Half slab ribs & Cole slaw & Braised greens and as a appetizer it was the House Bacon cheddar Hush Puppies & a really hhot  chipotle dipping sauce. we asked for honey on the side trying to cool it down. I think that ranch dressing would have worked. It was to hot for me my opinion.The Braised greens were tough to cut I think they were collard greens. But I think that they should used another type of green like Turnip and mix them together.  Also we stayed for dessert which wasn't on the menu.  But we had ice cream and took out dessert's to go. They were both AL-mode.Mine was a pecan pie very good & my sister had a cobbler pie. They accidentally gave her pumpkin Ice cream, she wanted vanilla. We ate it there because it would of melted on the ride back to the hotel. Our server was Dan  Very pleasant to chat with. I think we were the last order of the night because it got quieter and the bus boys & girls were clean up ,and setting up for the next day.   You do have to make reservations. We love the lamps we were unsure on how to change the light bulbs. Then you see the road. But it goes no where on the wall like a video. I wished it showed  people waving or the video changes say different things around on how they named it  Chicago Q. Or cows walking down the road."
"I went during lunch and found out they have a prix fixe lunch menu for just $15! you get an appetizer (choice of hush puppies, smoked chicken wings or beet salad), entree (pulled pork sandwich, chopped brisket sandwich, or pulled chicken sandwich) with a side (coleslaw, honey butter cornbread, cheddar poblano cornbread or fries) and a dessert (vanilla ice cream, cinnamon ice cream or two cookies-choices were oatmeal raisin & bacon, keylime or chocolate chip).The smoked chicken wings and pulled pork sandwich were delicious and juicy. The cornbread was really dry.  The desserts were pretty good. The cinnamon ice cream tasted like it would be the ice cream version of horchata. The oatmeal raisin and bacon cookie wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I thought they'd use smaller, crispy bits of bacon in the cookie but instead they used slightly bigger pieces that were chewy so it was a little weird."
"We checked out the Q a few weeks ago on a long weekend vacation and we weren't disappointed. A bit tough to find this place, cute little white building off a side street.  No beer on tap, as others have said but I'm cool with it. Capitol Supper Club? Yes please! I've missed you! One of the best things about visiting Chicago is getting some of my old Sconnie beers sneaking across the border. The service here, it should be mentioned, is the best I've had in a long while.The food - very good, I'd say. Sean had the brisket which was very tender and excellent. I had the pulled pork/chicken platter. Also really really good. Baked beans - great. Sauces - varied and really tasty. Cornbread - the only real disappointment. Really dry and not good. The only thing I have against this place (other than the sub-par cornbread) is the atmosphere. This was the weirdest BBQ place I've ever been to. We didn't know what to expect so we just wore jeans and casual attire......and while not terribly so, we did seem under-dressed compared to the rest of the diners. I found this odd. I have never been to a barbeque place where jeans weren't the norm. Or one with a coat check.  I mean the Maitre d' was wearing a full-on SUIT! Complete with pocket square. Not really bad, just very strange. Bottom line - good food, skip the cornbread, wear some khakis."
"It's ok but certainly not worth a four or five star review.  They did have some good sauces and excellent ambiance but...wow, expensive and of course I've had far better.  If you go, it's mostly for ambiance, don't expect mind blowing bbq."
"Holy smokes. You may end up with meat sweats later on in the evening after a night out here. Its well worth it, trust me.My lovely lady took me out for a birthday dinner and we got our fill of bbq. We couldn't really decide on one entree each so we ordered a few.-Pre-App:Bread and butter pickles + barbeque chips (nice touch)-App:House Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies-Entree:Competition St. Louis style ribsSingle cut pork chopPulled pork and pulled chicken-Sides:Poblano Cheddar Cornbread Bruleed Macaroni and Cheese Cole Slaw-Dessert:Milk & Cookies All the meats had a great smoke flavor accompanied by their four homemade barbeque sauces on the side so not cover up that flavor. The ribs were fall off the bone and I mean no-effort-involved fall off the bone melt in your mouth. The corn bread was curiously spicy, the mac n' cheese had a creamy awesomeness to it and the cole slaw was crisp and tangy.The thought of dessert made want to roll on the floor and take a nap. But I managed to get a few bites in. Warm and gooey paired with the cool milk you just can't go wrong.I really think this was a great barbeque experience for Chicago. The price points were great as well with entrees from $9 to $300 (whole pork shoulder). Best I've had thus far and I have sought out several places in the city. Give it a go you will enjoy!"
"First time here, loved the chips, pickles were sweeter than expected. I got the q2 platter which is a meat, half slab, and a side. For the meat, i got a sausage something-something chipotle. It was kind of loud in the restaurant, but it was good though, They have 4 different bbq sauces, i'm fairly certain their spicy bbq is just their sweet bbq with chili flakes in it. It was good though, a good option for bbq in the city without having to go too far south."
"By the time my kobe-hash hit the table, I had filled up on the free house-made pickles and bbq potato chips that our waiter kept maliciously refilling. The hash was delicious, and the 2 giant flakey biscuits that came along with it were amazing. My greatest regret in life is not being man enough to finish both of them.The bloody mary's were delish as well and came with a skewer of cured meat, cheese, and olives.I want that long lost biscuit :("
"Starting with the atmosphere, five stars right away. The wood is all white, giving me the definite feel of being in the South. Continuing on that note, all of the servers are wearing plaid shirts that hint at the southern influence. The different sections of the menu are creatively placed on the walls on signs. The most interesting thing about this place is how quiet it is. Conversations can be had easily, but if no one is talking at your table, it is not a big deal at all. For my dinner, I ordered the chopped Kobe brisket with French fries and the homemade lemonade. The lemonade was perfect. It was sweet, but not so sweet that it slapped me everything I drank it. It was literally the best lemonade I have ever had. When the brisket arrived, I knew I was in for a treat. The sandwich was surrounded by even more brisket that I had to excavate away with my fork. Then I could eat the sandwich the way it was supposed to be eaten. The bun was a little crispy, but still had the perfect air-like texture. The brisket was so full of flavor that I forgot to put any kind of barbecue sauce on. They brought out four house made ones but I don't even think the brisket needed them. The fries complimented the sandwich well but I did not eat too many because the sandwich was huge and I was full. After the meal, another A-plus for service. The waiter brings out hot, damp towels with a lemon slice on top for you to wash your hands. The service here was fantastic, I wish I could remember my server's name because he deserves to be known. The things that stood out most to me were the managers. Both the manager and the assistant manager were out on the floor bussing tables, refilling waters, and bring food out of the kitchen. The team at this place really knows how to run a restaurant. I would definitely go back here again. It was the best barbecue I have ever had."
"This review is quick and fast so it will probably not even make it to the main page... because Yelp is like that. Anywhooo, I've checked in at dozens of places since my last review 6 months ago, but the fact that I stopped what I'm doing in the midst of a busy evening to type this review as I polish off the leftovers says aLOT. When you can heat up chicken breast in the microwave and it STILL tastes like butter... Hot diggity dog that is some righteous chicken! It was amazing last night... melt in your mouth amazing.. but it was just as good tonight. I started not to even bag the leftovers because who wants dry leftover chicken breast. We have all been there and done that.  Portions are pretty good also... We did the 1/2 smoked chicken and pulled pork with 2 sides. 2 girls ate until we were stuffed and I just ate a 3rd meal with a snack still left over. I'm a NC native so I was skeptical of the pulled pork... it was on the ok/dry side last night meaning it NEEDED the sauces to perk it up. Tonight ala microwaved leftover it was delish with no sauce. I was mad that I forgot to ask for a small cup of the hot sauce or vinegar but surprisingly I didn't even miss it. BTW the hot is really not hot at all... ijs. The braised collard greens were good... and again, I have southern standards. OF course they did not touch my mama's greens, but they were good. The brûlée mac and cheese disappointed. It was ok, but not worth writing home about. Keep in mind that my NC native, true southerner standards are high so everyone else may love it. When these 2 southern chicks finished eating we both agreed that we would come back to Chicago Q in a heartbeat. As a matter of fact I may be bringing the boyfriend here this weekend to see if it passes the meat and potatoes, southern guy test. I will keep you posted!"
"I have been here for brunch and for dinner. I wasn't disappointed with either experience. They have a great beer selection for my father who loved trying something new, and a friendly yet knowledgeable wait staff. The pulled pork didn't disappoint and the half slab of ribs was amazing! Their homemade BBQ sauces cover every pallet. Make sure to try their complimentary, homemade pickles and chips. My favorite part of the whole meal was the cornbread!"
"Let me first say, I don't like BBQ, so going to q on a Saturday night was not my choice and I had rather low expectations of my meal (and high expectations of leaving hungry).  But guess what? I find myself giving the place five stars because it was a wonderful surprise of delicious food and savory sauces that opened my eyes to a new BBQ world.I ordered the smoked half chicken and would highly recommend it with the mustard sauce (although you can't go wrong with any of the four sauces they bring to the table.) My friend, being the  manly dude that he is, proudly ordered the full stack of ribs and within minutes, there wasn't a crumb left on his plate, except for the cornbread....it was a huge, thick piece of fresh spongy cornbread and even he couldn't finish it. The atmosphere varies. There's rather romantic lighting and high tops in the front by the bar, which is good for a date or a small group of friends. The back of the restaurant is more casual with traditional tables suited for larger, boisterous groups.Bottom line...get to q and enjoy the way BBQ should be done."
"Bread and butter pickles - oh my!  They are better than my grandmother's.  I've had my share and more of BBQ over the years.  I am from the South.  This pulled pork is the best I have EVER had.  I like my Q dry and theirs is served this way.  Choice of sauces provided on the side.  I didn't even need them.  I applaud this chef for bringing upscale BBQ to the Chicago market.  And, this IS upscale."
"there's something wonderful about chicago q. the ambiance of the dining room, the service, and bbq were exceptional. though the bbq is a bit pricey, it was worth it for the experience that we had. i'm a texan, born and raised, so i know a thing or two about good bbq.chicago q has good bbq. the kobe beef brisket was excellent along with the pulled pork. my husband ordered the kobe beef ribs and i ordered the baby back ribs. my ribs were fall off the bone tender. i prefer a little more bite to my ribs rather than it being fork tender. the kobe beef ribs were moist and had a smokey flavor. we also sampled the corn bread which was a little too dry for my taste. but what i enjoyed about chicago q is that they bring to your table their house made potato chips and pickles. both were very good. the pickles were especially tasty."
"What a find! We were looking for good bbq in a casual, but nice setting, and this far exceeded expectations. Some other reviewers have commented that the food was too expensive, but for the quantity and quality of the food, I would say it is very  reasonable. We had the shrimp and grits appetizer, St. Louis ribs and watermelon salad. All outstanding! Unfortunately we were too full for dessert, but will return for the chocolate mousse pie with carmel and pretzel crust. Loved the decor. The private rooms looked great for a small party. Our server, Sima, as well as other staff were friendly, accommodating, and efficient. I highly recommend!"
"Last night was my first experience with Chicago Q. Luckily, I made a reservation, because it was totally packed when we arrived. The complimentary, homemade BBQ chips were phenomenal! I would go back just to eat the chips. They were a perfect combination of sweet, salty, and tangy. The pickles were fine--nothing memorable there. The wait staff was very friendly and definitely added to the experience. Our server Damain, was lots of fun. It was pretty busy, but still he was very attentive. A friend and I went expecting to score some of the much lauded kobe beef ribs. Unfortunately, they were sold out just a moment before we ordered. NOooooo!!! That was disappointing. Our server, suggested that we might ask our neighbor for a little nibble. We refrained as there was only a bite or two left. FYI: You can call ahead and the kitchen will reserve the Kobe beef ribs.We'll be doing that next time. We ended up ordering the kobe beef brisket. The sauces were delicious (we loved the traditional),  but the beef itself was adequate at best. It was tender, but wasn't very warm. Make sure that if you order an additional side you make it clear that it is ""additional"". We didn't get to try that luscious corn bread... The place is great and we had a nice evening, but you're definitely paying for the location."
Totally fair prices for excellent bbq!
"Horrible!!! My husband and I ordered the Kobe brisket, pulled pork, cornbread, and braised greens. I'll start by saying the pulled pork was the best thing we ordered and that was just okay, provided you salted it and added one of the many sauces (which were actually pretty decent).  The cornbread tasted like cake. That's it. Waaaay too sweet (even for cornbread)...I mean it was like a slightly savory bread pudding crossed with cake. The braised greens were bland and greasy. Seriously, I've never had something that tasted as though literally NO effort was made to season it. There was bacon or salt pork or something in it, but I have no idea what happened. Maybe they thought if the veggies saw the bacon they would be inspired? The Kobe beef brisket? For $23.00, holy crap, this was so ridiculously dry, tough, and flavorless that  it wasn't fit to be served!!! I think the worst part was that it didn't taste *completely* like someone didn't know what the hell they were doing in the kitchen (it really did, but this is just one other thing)---it tasted like leftovers that sat in the fridge all week uncovered, and you microwaved them for a quick dinner out of desperation, even though you knew you should have probably trashed them.Finally, our waiter was sooooooo rude. He clearly saw we really touched nothing on our plates and after ignoring us all evening, was perfectly content to clear the table without a second thought. It wasn't until I said,""hey this was absolutely terrible"" that he came back with a condescending remark and took one thing off the bill.So no, not my favorite."
"From the minute I saw the sign, I knew this would be a neat place. They have outdoor seating, although it was too chilly for us to sit outside.  I ordered the beef brisket. It comes with 4 dipping sauces. For a appetizer, we had the hushpuppies, which was recommended my our waiter and were very good. They also give you yummy pickles and home made chips. My date had the pulled chicken sandwich and we shared the greens and the beans. (I personally thought the beans were too spicy but he liked them) After I took the first bite, I was in shock. NEVER had I had a meal that was this good.  I cannot wait to go back and take my friends.  Make your reservation now....you wont be sorry!"
"The best thing about Chicago Q was our excellent service.  We were a party of 4 but 2 members were an hour late.  They seated us and our waiter never once rushed us...even though we only ordered 3 cocktails over that time.  Eventually, we gave up on the other 2 people and ordered...once we did the stragglers arrived, our waiter put their order in and it came out on a rush order with our food, bravo!Complimentary pickles and chips are awesome!Honey cornbread is divine.The BBQ was very good, though the brisket could have been ""wetter"" and the ribs ""meatier"".  Pulled pork was more ""chopped"" but solid nonetheless, and the sauces were excellent.I'd go back for sure.  Very nice meal."
"One of my favorite spots in Chicago. I love everything about this place. I have been on numerous occasions and every time has been better than the last. I had dinner here last night and started the evening at the bar selecting a Stone IPA as I waited for the rest of my group to arrive. After a few drinks we were seated for our reservation and immediately dove into the seasoned chips on the table that I've always found to be hard to resist. I've tried the pulled pork, the barbecue chicken and several other items on the menu. All are great. However, I think if you head to Chicago Q you are mistaken if you don't order a slab of ribs. They are awesome. And then you can sample with all the different sauces provided. Makes for quite the meal. Throughout the dinner I had an Angel's Envy Rye Manhattan and also an Angel's Envy Bourbon on the rocks. They both complimented the meal perfectly. Overall, a great place for a group dinner. Fun environment that's busy but never too loud or packed. I fully recommend visiting if you are in the Chicago area and craving some solid barbecue!"
"The food is so flavorful and delicious.  I had the ribs and they were falling off the bone.  Their sauces are excellent too.  The outdoor patio is great, although it started raining on us and they were quick to accommodate us with a table inside. Great BBQ food!"
"Best BBQ in Chicago. We tried the hush puppies, grilled oysters, and alligator-yummy! Baby backs, beans and cornbread yummy too! Great service- truly a decadent place!"
"If there was only a 6th star to rate this amazing place. Let's start at the beginning: The ambiance is fantastic. You walk in and you feel like you are in someone's home. The complimentary coat check was unexpected and welcomed surprise. From there we met our friendly waiter who brought us over sweet pickles and homemade potato chips. Seeing as it was restaurant week, my two friends and I decided to dive face first into everything. We ordered the Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies with the spicy dipping sauce. They were fantastic. So crunchy on the outside, yet soft and delicious on the inside. As I perused around the room I saw the amazing mac and cheese. I did not order it, but I definitely intend to on my next trip. It is served in a cast iron pan. As it was plated, it was so cheesy that the strings seemed to never end. It was finally time for the appetizers. I must have blacked out from the deliciousness of my meal because I can barely remember finishing it all. I have the BBQ flight and it was sensational. If you want an opportunity to taste everything Q has to offer, then you must order this. My friends ordered the Black Bean and Hominy Salad. And while it was delicious, there was just go much of it. It would have made a great side. The portions were so large that we did not know how we would make it through dinner. Up next: Kobe Brisket and your choice of a HUGE mount of cole slaw, crunchy delicious fries or wonderful smelling cornbread. I am not a fan of cornbread, but I could not deny how great it smelled! The Brisket was phenomenal. Period. Then came dessert. When they say Carrot Cake, they are not kidding you. I practically a piece of cake the size of a small child's birthday cake. The presentation was exquisite, the food was delicious. My friends chose the milk and cookies. It came with three generously sized cookies. One was a chocolate chip, one was an oatmeal and then the sugar came drizzled with a bourbon caramel glaze. Everything was just phenomenal. Go there, but do not plan on doing anything after. You will want to sleep and wake up to eat the rest of your leftovers."
"Had the good fortune to stop at Chicago Q for lunch at 3pm so there was no wait, but let me tell you - if you have to wait for this food, you will be rewarded!We had a bbq flight (pulled pork, pulled chicken, beef brisket), which came with cornbread and a half slab of the baby back ribs.Pulled chicken, when you catch a tender bite (any time you have pulled meat, you can get a dry or a tender bite), it is exquisite. The pulled pork was similar. The brisket might have been over cooked (easy to do when the cubes are so small) but still tender enough to chew easily.Baby back ribs fell off of the bone - just the way I like it. The meat was so tender, then when I stuck a fork in it, the fork just came right back out. So what makes Chicago Q five star worthy? the blend of sauces and the pickle chips and potato chips that come with your meal. The pickle chips are ""bread and butter"", i.e. they are sweet - AND DELICIOUS! No too strong that you can't just grab one with your fingers and drop it in your mouth.The bbq chips are perfect. Seasoned with just enough bbq spice, and thick enough to have a crunch, but not so thick that you cannot easily consume the whole bowl by yourself.And then, the sauces for your BBQ. Regular BBQ, Spicy BBQ, Northern Carolina BBQ (vinegar style) and Eastern Carolina (mustardy). There is enough of a difference between regular and spicy BBQ that you notice, but not so much that they both don't taste like BBQ.The vinegar style sauce was too runny for me and probably would be best used as a dip. The mustard sauce takes some adjustment, but it is very good once you do account for the fact that is mustardy.I rarely give five star reviews, but this dining experience was top notch from start to finish. The pickle chips and bbq chips, the meat, the sauces. Well done Chicago Q, and I'm not talking about the meat!"
"food/service was amazing. takes reservations. decor was refined/polished/classy.complementary fresh fried chips and pickles. look at the photos. amazing and delish. free refills.ordered the full rack competition ribs, giant cube of cornbread, and a side order of pulled pork. yum. fall off the bone ribs, perfectly smoked and seasoned. fine with or without the rib sauce (4 bbq sauces - mild, spicy, southern/vinegary, mustard).also ordered fried oyster po'boy with watermelon salad. not very crisp batter, but the bread and slaw were good. i'd say it was ok, but i would order something else next time.service was great all around. helpful w/ our questions on the menu, efficient, and even ran out to give me my gloves i left in the booth. thanks Q!!!!one comment - anyone order their desserts there??? it looked amazing!! will TRY to save room on my next visit.breakfast looked amazing too - i was drooling at the table next to me that ordered breakfast."
"I Tried Chicago Q during a Wednesday afternoon after reading Yelp reviews of restaurants close to where I happened to be, and was really happy I did.  They had an appetizers happy hour special that I took advantage of and would suggest anyone to do the same.  Hands down some of the best BBQ I've had in some time, definitely worth checking this place out!"
"Succulent and juicy pulled pork brings me back for more. Despite all the fantastic restaurants in Chi, I keep coming to this place over and over.Each dining experience has been terrific! Cocktails - AMAZING.Love the tangy homemade pickles and bbq chips that come out before appetizers.Food portions are huge with the options of getting 2 or 3 bbq meats. The 4 bbq sauces provide a nice variety of tastiness. My husband went so crazy for them at lunch today we had to get extra napkins!I've never tried the brunch but ogled some plates of it today and it smelled worthy of some further research...Decor and ambiance are much nicer than a typical bbq place. Outdoor dining in the summer makes for a special date night.Make reservations because this place can get crazy busy on the weekend. Takeout also offered. Yum."
"Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!This used to be really really good.  And I had thought I had written a glowing review based on past experiences there.  It was a four or five at start.  The first several times there.  Then the big changes:I think this was back in March, when they sent the delivery guy out with half the order (then tried blaming him).  Another time, they didn't send sauces.  We did get an empty dish that should have had sauce.  (WTF?  Homeopathic sauces?  one part per billion in the air mixture?  woah.  strong stuff!  easy, there, cowboy!)The most recent, worst episode was about two weeks ago, or thereabouts.1) the water guy touched the glasses with the pitcher.  eew.  hygiene 101 says that's a no-no.  2) the waiters and bussers (not the customers) kept bumping into me (we were outside).  It happened upwards of 10 times.  Customers did not do that.  3) the kobe brisked was rubbery.  how the hell can someone mess that up?  but there it was.4) the st louis ribs, typically very good, were tough and the ends were unappetizing.5) hygiene problems (busser handling my fork by the forky part, not the handle) and put it on the table (really?  you use the same goddamn towel to wipe everything up, to ""clean"" off the table, etc.  And you expect me to believe the table top is clean?  um.  no.  but then you put my damned fork on it, while touching the forky part?  really?if it weren't corrupt Chicago, a call to the health authorities would clear this up. If that's their food and hygiene when we can see, I'm scared to know what goes on behind the scenes.  Fortunately, I'll never find out.  Nor will I fund their germ factory any more.  Disgusting.  Disappointing food.  And a third chance that went awry."
"Hmm, I don't know what all the fuss is about.  It's good, ok, don't get me wrong, but I have yet to find anything special about this place that is of note or better than other BBQ joints I've tried. I figured this would be upscale Gold Coast BBQ...as would the prices, location, and decor suggest but that the redeeming factor would be the food.  However, like many things in the Gold Coast, I feel as if it was kind of a tourist trap.  I will say the service was excellent, slow, but excellent in that we liked our server and the staff was attentive with water, sharing plates, silverware etc.  The pickles and chips were a great touch at the beginning of the meal.  From a sea of other appetizers we ordered (chicken wings, hush puppies, smoked salmon salad...the only highlight was the shrimp and grits...everything else was just not that good).One comment that will stick out in my mind...we asked, are the ribs fall of the bone? (For me, this is a warning question, like if you answer yes they are, I'm running out the door because I freaking hate that!)  Our servers reply was, ""When people ask for fall off the bone ribs, they're asking for overcooked ribs.""  Ok good, we are in for a good time, no fall off the bone boiled ribs for us!.  Funny thing is, I don't recall using a fork, knife, or my teeth for that matter at Chicago Q once to eat their ribs.....they were pretty much as fall off the bone as you can get.  I'm sticking with my neighborhood favorite Lillie's Q any day of the week. I miss their crispy edges and ribs I can actually use my teeth for."
"Rumor has it there are some purists who don't like the concept of upscale barbecue. Well, to them, I say ""get over it."" After all the steak has migrated from it's primal spot on the grill to some pretty nicey, pricey streak houses. So why not barbecue? I for one was happy to munch on quality barbecued meats in this nice big classy room. And for not much more than some of those lower key, self-service joints.I came here with a friend for an early Friday night dinner (we were having a Florida senior moment.) I had a martini at the bar while waiting for my friend. It was nicely prepared and the bleu-cheese stuffed olives were excellent. We were seated promptly and greeted by a number of servers, actually. It is that type of team service where you have numerous visitors at your table, including a quick check-in from what must have been the manager. We were in manic mood, of sorts, and probably engaged them in some TMI kinds of conversation and kidding. They played along with us quite well. I can see they have made a special effort to hire and educate the right kind of people here.The menu is full of classic barbecue offerings and sides, but is not too long or gimmicky. Appetizers include such interesting items as a BBQ flight of Kobe Brisket, Pulled Pork and Chicken, BBQ lemon shrimp with polenta and House Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies. Prices range from $5.75 for Onion Rings to $10.75 for the Shrimp. We chose the flight, which came out in a sushi style in a way in small separate dishes with dipping sauces, and pickled red onions which resembled pickled ginger in their pinkness. I requested chop sticks, but they couldn't find any. This was my first experience with ""Bushi.""There are three salads to choose from: A basic baby greens, one orignal with hominy. smoke corn and black beans, and a Cobb with pulled chicken. We shared the Cobb. It was delicious and would make a great lighter dinner choice, still with BBQ flavors.The main BBQ menu has sandwiches, ribs, Kobe Brisket, smoked pork and chicken. You can also get a Rib-eye, a Pork Chop or a Smoked Salmon Steak. There are ""combo"" offerings, too. We orderd 1/2 slabs of each of the Baby Back and St. Louis ribs. Served dry-rubbed, with separate dipping sauces, they were tender and flavorful. We didn't even use the sauces. Only a plate of squeaky clean bones remained. I loved their coleslaw, too. It was nicely shredded green and purple cabbage, not too ""wet,"" and a generous quantity. A pulled pork sandwich runs $10.50, 1/2 slabs around $15 and full around $25. So pretty standard prices.Five big old stars for a GREAT value, in a classy but understated setting, exquisite knowledgeable and friendly service and mouth-watering dishes. Chicago q was just the nicest surprise. Fantastic location, too, smack in the middle of the Division & Rush Streets scene."
"I didn't read any yelp reviews before making a visit to this restaurant. A friend from out of town who dined here with one of his clients suggested that we check it out. When we got there, i was surprised that it was a bbq place. The exterior definitely makes it looks otherwise. The interior is also a bit upscale than what I was expecting. The service, cocktails, food were all really good. I really like bbq but wouldn't call myself an enthusiast. This place kicked it up a notch for me."
"Holy BBQ, Batman!House-made pickles that aren't too sweet or too vinegary?  Chicago Q, you've piqued my tastebuds' interest.  BBQ trio app?  Pulled chicken, Kobe beef, and pulled pork...all smoked?  Yes please.  And you do it right!  You put the sauces on the side.  (Spicy was my favorite, followed by traditional...the vinegar...not so much.)  The beef was heavenly.Cornbread.  I'm a HUGE cornbread fan.  In all seriousness, I am a very discerning consumer of the stuff.  (Don't laugh...it's true!)  It was quite good.  A bit dry, but the sweet/savory balance was right on with the cornmeal.  Not too dessert-y, not too corny.  Ha.  Corny.So much food, too.  The hush puppies were great--how can anything with bacon and chive and it's starch based and fried to perfection not be?  As were the onion rings...although a bit too much on the breading.  I like a good onion/breading ratio on onion rings.  And the pulled chicken/pork plate was delightful.  Coleslaw!  Yay!And all this in a much nicer than expected setting.  Not that I really knew what to expect...so the ambiance confused me a bit, at first, but after awhile, what they were going for clicked.  (Whitewashed walls, southern manor-type feel but relatively upscale all the while still oozing hip.  But not too hip.  See why I was confused?)  The service was top-notch.  SUPER ATTENTIVE.  (Maybe a little too much, but hey...that means they care!)  Pear/cranberry cobbler?  Get outta town.  (Actually, I did.  Home now.)"
"I've never really been a fan of BBQ so I wasn't sure how I'd feel about Chicago Q, but there's little not to like at Chicago Q.  I was expecting a low-key BBQ joint, but Chicago Q is just as upscale as it's neighbor Il Mulino where I've enjoyed tasty Italian food.  We were there to celebrate the engagement of a friend...and Chicago Q knows how to celebrate because they immediately brought some complimentary champagne to the table.  We oh so enjoyed the champagne, while also munching on their complimentary pickles (i think i ate 4 bowls of them!) and chips.  The rest of the meal wasn't complimentary, but it was well worth the price.  We started with a few orders of hush puppies for the table and we all agreed they were pretty fabulous. As for my entree I ordered the pulled chicken, which came with a ginormous piece of corn bread.  The chicken was pretty good, although a tad bit too smokey tasting for me...but then again I'm the girl who doesn't love BBQ. And the corn bread was uh-mazing!I washed it all down with a fabulous Pimm's Cup. I enjoyed it so much that I was hoping I could order a 2nd, but decided against it since I'm nursing and figured it was enough alcohol for my 2 month old. I left completely stuffed..and all that food & drinks came to only $42/person!My Texan hubby was on babysitting duty that night, but I know he'd love Chicago Q so I'll most definitely be bringing him back soon!"
"Let's go in chronological order.You sit down and they bring you a bowl of homemade bread and butter pickles. Delicious. You also get a bowl of homemade BBQ potato chips. Yum. Both of these can be refilled as .much as you want. Take advantage. They'll even pack some up for you at the end. Oops. That's not chronological.So next we had the hush puppies. Sprinkled with what I can only describe as magic dust. I imagine that pixies, fairies, and BBQ masters sneeze this stuff.Next up was a BBQ combo plate. Pulled Pork, Brisket, Cornbread, Slaw. Also three types of BBQ sauce. Vinegar based, mustard based, and another that I forget but it was what I recognize as traditional.Then for dessert...I was too damn full. We packed up more than half of our food plus full servings of the pickles and chips, but you already knew I was gonna say that.The service was good. It was fun. Great spot. I also went for lunch a few weeks later. They have a prix fix menu. I think it was $15 for an appetizer, entree, and dessert. They were the full portions and again...too much food. Pickles and chips at lunch too. Did I mention the pickles? What about the chips?"
"Went last night for an early dinner. Love the pickles and chips (instead of a breadbasket). The waiter up-sold me on the ribs - I ordered the ""normal"" baby back ribs, but he convinced me to order the ""competition"" ribs. It was worth the upgrade! I barely had to chew the ribs. My only complaint is that the cornbread was very very dry. Will be back for those ribs!"
"I've been here twice and love love love it! They bring you yummy bread and butter pickles and chips with BBQ rub on them when you sit down. My favorite thing is the St. Louis style ribs, but everything is good, so I like to do the 3 meat options and split it with someone. I'm from St. Louis where BBQ is a big deal, and this is by far the best I've had in Chicago!"
"Drinks: Delicious, well mixed, good bar staff.Hush Puppies: Over cooked, couldn't even get my fork into themSalad: dripping in dressing, felt like I needed to rinse it off (yuck!)Pulled Pork: Cooked well, sauces delightful, still nothing to write home aboutTable Pickles & Chips:Good, but they're again not something I'd come back forPecan Pie: My favorite thing of the night.Check: Really reasonably priced... but I don't think this is the best BBQ in town."
"Quite possibly the best BBQ I've had. The wings are perfectly spiced, smoked, and sauced. Not too sweet, salty, or smokey and has the right amount of sauce  The ribs melt in your mouth and they aren't very fatty. They are served semi-dry but come with 4 different bbq sauces: traditional, spicy, Carolina vinegar, and mustard-based. Other mentionables:Fries - house-made and sightly thick but these are crispCole Slaw - minimal mayo so you actually may be getting a serving of vegetables.Bacon Hush Puppies - Good but I don't care for hush puppies in general; not much bacon in the ones I gotCookies - freshly baked and excellent as if you were at a bakery.I loved the decor. Nothing you would expect at a BBQ restaurant. It was more country - French country that is.Service was extremely professional and knowledgeable. We had a ton of family-style leftovers and they divided it up and gave each of us our own bag. Plus, no wet-naps here. They have hot towels with fresh lemons!!!Q, see you soon."
Didn't expect Chicago q to be as nice as it was. Sat at the table by the fireplace and enjoyed watching the Hawks game while having the pulled pork sandwich which was amazing. House made butter pickles and chips were great.
"We have been there for several times since we are living nearby.The food was good and very big portion, I had never finish mine every time.The price range is affordable.The service is friendly but could be better, especially during lunch time, they have only a few serving staff, I tried once to wait more than 15 mins to get a softdrink refill.Other than that, all good!"
"Hands down, one of the best places in the city.  Just be careful to not fill up on the complimentary sweet pickles and fresh potato chips before you have a chance to get to the best part -- the BBQ!!   Anytime I have a guest in town, I take them here --- no better place to find this type of quality service and delicious food for this value in Chicago.  Stop reading, and GO THERE!"
"The food gets 4 stars but the service is definitely 5 stars! They give you complimentary  bread and butter pickles and barbeque potato chips. I had the half chicken, it was juicy and flavorful. The food came out quickly. The staff was very attentive. They made sure that my water glass was never empty. The only thing keeping this place from a 5 star review is the prices!"
"I like BBQ.  If the meat is fall of the bone and the sauce is good, then you've got good bbq ribs.  Chicago Q has pretty good ribs, some better than others, and I enjoyed it all and ate alot.  But I feel like there are better places for ribs.  I would give the place 4 stars for taste, service, atmosphere, but the price point was a little high.  I'd go back to try other items tho.The pickles are the best!  Couldn't get enough of them."
"My husband and I have been to Chicago q four times since we live nearby & it is great.  We have gone here once with a family member and every time the food was consistent.  The first time we went, the waiter suggested the appetizer that has each meet on it as a way to determine what we like best.  That was the perfect suggestion and every time we go, we get the same thing now that we know what we like.  The chicken is amazing and so juicy.  The cornbread is great and both of us are from Florida, so that says a lot!  However, we were not very wild about the hush puppies.  I would have given it five stars, but due to our mixed experience with the waitstaff, I am giving it four.  The first time we went the waiter was great, but the last time the waitress was not very good.  We went around 6pm on a Sunday and asked for mixed drinks and she hesitated and told us that they may not be able to make them.  Next thing we knew, someone else delivered our drinks.  We ordered mojitos as we always do and it has never been a problem before.  She also did not ask if we wanted another round until we were done with our meals and by that point we were over it.  We will definitely go back again, but we will likely request another table if we end up having the same waitress!"
"Beautiful atmosphere. I mean this as a total compliment - this is a trendy place you can take parents/older people/people who don't like trendy stuff that isn't ""too trendy"".Had reservations for my birthday, and we were seated right away and given their signature pickles, which were great.I had a whiskey old fashioned and the BF opted to a beer. Both were delish.Now, on to the main dish BBQ...We both had the pulled pork sandwich with cornbread and split a side of mac and cheese. The pork came with 3 separate sauces, all very delicious. The pork....oh my god the pork. It melted in your mouth, it was delicious, flavorful. I was obsessed from first bite. The mac and cheese was excellent, it could have been a little more cheesy, but I'm a WI girl, take that comment for what it is worth.Then, in honor of my birthday, our server brought out cookies and milk. I had to take the home because I was so full but they were a great snack the next day. I definitely recommend Chicago q!!!"
"A group of friends and I went here for my birthday dinner on a Sunday evening. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to get reservations just a few days ahead of time since I had heard how good Chicago q was. And it was GOOD.Those comp chips and pickles are no joke. We ate them all and and could have gone through another bowl of each. The chips had an awesome BBQ spice on them, and the pickles were spicy, sweet, and so delicious. I could sit at the bar with a drink and just munch on those and be a happy camper.We got the hush puppies for an appetizer, and they were awesome. Crispy outside, soft and fluffy inside, and the chipotle mayo dipping sauce had one hell of a kick, but it was really good when used in moderation. For dinner I had the pulled pork sandwich, which is crazy huge. You will NOT go home hungry, that's for sure. It was served on a giant pretzel roll and a huge chunk of delicious cornbread. And the pork is served plain so that you can sample all 4 of the awesome sauces they bring out. The honey mustard and traditional BBQ were my favorites. They were kind enough to bring a plate of cookies with a candle and cold glass of milk since it was my birthday too. The chocolate chunk cookie was really, really good :) Also, our waiter was great. Service is definitely a priority of this place. Overall, a really good meal! I'll be back."
"First off, service was great. Attentive, rarely had to ask for anything, and was as polite as you would want someone to be.  Hats off to the chef here for many reasons as well. I was in for lunch with two of my friends and we sampled just about everything we could possibly fit into our stomachs.  Our favorites were the sampler which included chicken wings, fried green tomatoes (beautifully done, crispy outside and nice firm tomato), shrimp & cheese grits (I would have licked the container the grits were in), and the jalapeno dill ranch was just a perfect dipping sauce.  The hush puppies were cooked to perfection and had a wonderful taste. Pulled pork and chicken were juicy, mouth watering, and flavorful. The perfect compliment to everything was the homemade BBQ sauces.  For dessert a must have is the espresso ice cream cake with homemade peanut brittle.  Great southern cooking in the heart of Chicago."
"Upscale BBQ.  I adore the atmosphere and decor. A Yelp quick tip accurately described it as the South meeting Room & Board. Well said.I struck up a conversation with an stranger/employee from the restaurant randomly last week at a fast food restaurant on Michigan Ave, who told me about the place and that I would not be disappointed. I'm a former vegetarian and don't eat much meat, but her confidence told me I couldn't pass this place up. After reading a couple of reviews, I knew I had to try this new spot. They even have a gluten free menu.  Absolutely divine. My BF and I sat in the bar and ordered the pulled chicken and pulled pork sandwiches. The waiter warned us the food would be out before we knew it and wow....we barely waited 2 minutes. Just enough time to order a couple of Mint Juleps and nosh on the yummy homemade chips they served us. We were instantly blown away. Make sure to sample each of the sauces and add what appears to be heirloom onions to your plate. The Mint Juleps are pretty stiff. They had to doctor mine up a bit.The service was amazing. And the food was even better. See my photos. The trophies sitting next to us were a testament. Our waiter informed me that the girl I met on Michigan Ave. was in fact the award winning trophy winner....! Thank you kind stranger. Consider me a new regular. I hope to see this new find around for years to come.  I'm so glad to see this new business in my hood. Consider the word officially spread :)A+."
"I've been here twice in the last 30 days and loved it both times. For each visit my boyfriend and I had the same server, Aerial (I hope I spelled his name right).  The decor is very much unlike any typical BBQ joint. In fact I hesitate to even tag them with the word joint. It looks like a large country home. Nice neutral colors, clean and crowded. There's an upstairs with a private party room and a couch/flat screen tv lounge area as well as a large downstairs with a private party room, bar area and general restaurant seating area.  On our first visit we went up the grand staircase to the upstairs lounge area which was great as we got to watch March Madness and snuggle up on the couch. I got the combo platter- pulled pork and chicken with a GIANT CHUNK of corn bread.  The fried pickles are fabulous and the pickled onions out of this world.  My boyfriend despises onions but he loved these.The second time we came here we brought my boyfriends sister and her hubby.  We ate our way through that restaurant, I tell you.  The GM came by to say hi.  And our server managed to get us a tour of the kitchen, complete with a tour of the big beautiful smoker.  We even briefly met the lead chef and pitmaster star, Lee Ann Whippen.  When we returned to our table after the tour they brought us a platter of cookies (with bacon baked into them!!!) and cookies!I loved this restaurant and I loved the experience!  I will absolutely return and I would absolutely recommend Chicago Q."
"I expected so much from Chicago Q after reading and hearing raves about it. Totally overrated. My entire group received ""smoked"" wings that weren't even cooked through. Out of a group of 12, 11 agree that this place was a complete disappointment. I don't know if I caught them on a bad day or what but for $300 bill, we expected so much more."
"There were a few things I really liked about this place, but one thing was extremely disappointing: the Kobe brisket sandwich.  Beware that this brisket is not sliced as typically.  It is cubed in large pieces, which added to its chewiness.  The ""croissant""-type bun it came with was flaky and buttery but too delicate to be used as a sandwich bun for a large pile of cubed meat!  Also, they offer 3 different types of BBQ sauces, and the spicy was my favorite, but they definitely don't leave you with enough sauce on your table, so you have to keep asking for more.  The honey cornbread, although a large portion, was a little too dry and crumbly for my preference.  I'd try the ribs next time, but I'm not really jumping at the chance.Things I really enjoyed: mac & cheese (nice and gooey with spicy crumbs), the service (our waitress was very friendly), freebies (our bowls of house made chips and butter pickles were never empty), the drinks (the Pimm's cup tastes like iced tea), the milk & cookies for dessert (these are like cake-cookies and fantastic), and the atmosphere (decently priced BBQ in an upscale Southern house feel)."
"I love this concept. Upscale BBQ in a place with great southern charm. They really nailed the ambiance, and I would give it 4 stars in that aspect for sure. As for the food... Bottom line: the meat is super high quality (we had pulled pork and baby back ribs). It falls off the bone, is super tender, and you can just tell it's great product. However, it really isn't seasoned. Now, this is fine, since it's good meat and all, but in that case I need damn good sauces. Unfortunately Chicago Q failed to deliver in the sauce area. Their ""hot"" one wasn't hot, the regular one tasted bottled, and the vinegar one was so thin you could barely get it to stick to your meat. Such a killer, cause they give you HUGE portions, and the whole time I was just thinking, good thing I'll have left overs so I can put Smoke Daddy sauce on it at home. As for the sides and such, the wings were really good, albeit pretty fatty. The savory hush puppies were very dense, but good. Mac & cheese were both good but didn't stand out from the competition. In all reality, the most standout side was the fries, which were perfectly fried and seasoned.  Also, the chips they put on the table in place of bread are fabulous.  Oh, and the milk and cookies are good, but we were too full to truly enjoy them."
"Trying to write a blog post while on a ski trip with the guys is probably foolish. But I have many to write and don't want to get behind. Erica and I went back to q for dinner with one of her old colleagues. I enjoyed my first visit, though the ribs we ordered was my least favorite part. This time around we stayed away from ribs and tried new items. It was a good call as I like the q experience that much more after round 2. As other people have mentioned, an ""elegant bbq"" place is a perfect compliment to our existing bbq and other ""meat"" focused venues. The concept is good and well executed, reminding me of walking into a southern country club.The meal started very well with the table setting in-house pickles and chips. I enjoy a little bourbon with my q and they have quite a selection. They also recently started bourbon flights, a great way to taste some different styles. The presentation of their single glass pours was fantastic. They come on a tray with sides of ice cubes and distilled water, so you can choose the right amount of either.We ordered one of their salads to start, but were surprised to see chicken wings and hush puppies also show up. They came compliments of the chef, a very nice chef :) I'm not a huge hush puppie guy, but these were good. I also liked the bbq chicken wings, the only dish they serve with the sauce already on the meat. The salad was a bit off, mostly in the dressing/seasoning. It tasted too salty and the dressing was a tad strong for me.Since I didn't love the ribs last time, I played it safe with a pulled chicken and pork combo plate. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed my bbq. They serve three types of sauce on the side - regular, spicy and a vingear based bbq. I love the spicy and went through a few servings on my meat and fries. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese for the table that did not last long.Our tasty meal finished with a surprise visit to our table by Chef Lee Ann Whippen. She chatted with us about her experience and what brought her to Chicago. We learned a few of her tricks of the trade and even let us take a peak in the kitchen and see her smokers. It was a fun way to end the night and the extra personal touch makes a difference in the dining experience.My first Chicago q experience was good, but my second was even better. I love the concept of upscale bbq dining when you want the best of both worlds (bbq but going out for a nice meal). The execution is spot on, and there's something for everyone on the menu to enjoy the fruits of Chef Wippen's talents."
"Has this chef ever traveled to the south?  Has he/she ever tasted good BBQ?  Worst shrimp grits/pulledpork/pulled chicken we've ever had.  Corn bread was too dry.  Dirty martini wasn't dirty.  Pickles were solid, thus the 2nd star.  Waiter was a douche.  Anyone giving this place 5 stars has never been to TX, Memphis or NC."
"I was looking for a good place for lunch within walking distance to the Public Hotel.The short version:  (out of 5)Flavor: 5Originality: 4Presentation: 4This place was highly recommended by the staff and I can understand why.Ordered the Q3 which consisted of two pulled meats and half slab of chicken or ribs.I opted for the sliced Kobe brisket, pork shoulder, and the St. Louis half slab with the corn bread for a side.They offer two types of ribs: the regular baby back or the St. Louis style.  The baby back is leaner and the St. Louis is fattier and more flavorful.  They do offer a premium ""competition"" version of each.While waiting for the food to be prepared, they brought out complimentary homemade bbq potato chips and pickled cucumber with mustard seed.  Each had a unique spice and tangy-ness to them.  I wanted to finish each one of them but had a big breakfast earlier and wanted to reserve some stomach space for the main courses.They came out with generous portions of each (especially of the pork shoulder).  They paired the meats with four different sauces.  A spicy bbq sauce with red chili flakes with a good kick but not overpowering because of the heat.  The others were a mustard based sauce and a vinegar base North Carolina style which I am quite familiar with.  The last one surprised me.  The mild blend.  It has a wonderful blend of sweetness and spice.  I liked it so much that I bought a bottle to take home with me.Back to the meats.  The pork shoulder was had a nice flakiness to it with a good marinated flavor.  The Kobe brisket was nicely sliced and was not overly cooked.  Tender goodness that tickles the palate.  Lastly were the St. Louis ribs.  Fall off the bone, flavorful, and filling.My only knock would be the sodas.  Served in nostalgic small coke bottles, each drink is charged individually.This place does bbq right.  If you're in the Gold Coast district, I too would highly recommend this establishment."
"What? Have I wandered into the south even though I am north? My mind can barely comprehend which is better- the beautiful decor or the smells of pork BBQ wafting out of the open kitchen. Where am I, you ask? Well at Chicago Q, the newest BBQ joint in town and let me tell you- this is no joint. Located in the old Tsunami space, as you pull open the dark wood doors and walk into the restaurant, you know that something special awaits. The bar area is in the front along with a small room for private parties, with the main dining room in the back- one side lit by skylights with soaring ceilings, the other side more intimate with coffered ceilings. The made to look old plank wood floors stained dark brown contrast beautifully with the lighter ceilings. And upstairs- there is a wine bar area with comfy chairs and tables- a perfect spot to sit and linger. We were seated for lunch in a booth in the back and within seconds, complementary butter pickles and chips were set down in front of us. Our server, Otha, was delightful; friendly, knowledgeable steering us towards his favorites on the menu. We did throw him a loop when the two of us ordered the full pork shoulder ($305 on the menu) as a joke. The look on his face was priceless as we told him we were going to sit and eat pork all day! Needless to say, that pork shoulder feeds 10 - 14 so we will save that for another time! Instead, as I am prone to do at a new place, we ordered a little of this and that. I had the pulled pork sandwich and my friend had the Q BBQ 2 plate which comes with brisket and baby back ribs. We also ordered a side of the ""bruleed"" mac and cheese. Within minutes our food was in front of us. The ribs were so tender they fell off the bone. My pulled pork was so large- I barely made it through half of it. And that mac and cheese? Mighty tasty. They also serve three different sauces (Carolina, BBQ and spicy BBQ)  with your entrees- the spicy was my fav!  Add in a few glasses of wine and I do believe we had the perfect lunch! Lunch for two with wine ran about $80. There is valet parking out front for $12 or you can usually find street parking in this area (at least during the day) Funny. I usually associate eating BBQ as being in a casual joint with paper napkins and BYOB. This ""joint"" certainly has that topped by a long shot. Or should I say a pig's tail???"
"Went here for a buddy's birthday last night. Service was very good, even if our waitress was a vegetarian and was lacking in the suggestions deparment. They did make up for it by being oddly receptive to my friend's request for their wifi password so we could look at pictures from a bachelor party he went to, but I digress.All three of us had brisket sandwiches, and all three of us finished our brisket sandwiches. Sides (cornbread, fries, coleslaw) were all good too. If it was socially acceptable, I'd probably come here, exclusively eat the pickles and chips that come before your meal, and leave. Don't get me wrong, I'd tip, but I have a feeling this would still be frowned upon.Also, it just occurred to me now that we mentioned it was our friend's birthday and they didn't bring him out anything. You know what, screw it, I'm going back just for the chips and pickles.A lot of people seem to have commented on the prices but I think this restaurant does a pretty good job of catering to clientele in the surrounding areas. It's called the Gold Coast for a reason. Basically, if you want BBQ served on a tin tray, you've come to the wrong spot. But, if you're looking for pretty good BBQ and moderately fast internet, Chicago Q has got the goods."
"You will not leave Chicago q hungry, that's for sure. You will probably leave happily stuffed and needing to face-plant on your bed immediately after.It's not the best or most authentic BBQ I've ever had, but it gets the job done. The portions are nuts. I recommend the appetizer sampler, where you get 3 samples of meat and a heap of cornbread (thus freeing up your sides options for the entree; I got the coleslaw and didn't regret it). The cheddar-bacon hush puppies were just okay -- skippable, in my opinion.Pulled pork was yummy and both the baby back ribs and St. Louis style were tasty. I like that the ribs don't come wet and you can add the sauce yourself -- definitely less messy that way. The hot mustard sauce is good as a alternative to BBQ.  The service was good, though it was a little odd that our server referred to both me (I'm 31) and my stepmom (she's in her late 40s) as ""sweetie"" repeatedly. We are grown women, sir, no need to call us sweetie. But that's not a huge deal, more like an odd quirk. The food came out at a good pace and water and napkins were replenished as needed. The Malbec we ordered was not bad for $35 (one of the cheapest wines on the list).I'll definitely come back, I just need to make sure to clear my schedule after in anticipation of the food coma."
"We made reservations for 5:30 on Valentines Day and the place was empty so it provided us with some good conversation time before the restaurant became busy around 7pm. Once our orders were placed it took about 20 minutes which is extremely fast service!! I ordered the smoked half chicken with cornbread and a side of macoroni which was enough for two people to share. The cornbread was moist, sweet and huge. The chicken was also moist and very flavorful and slid off the bones. The side of macaroni is enough for 2 and it was also delicious. The dish comes with 4 different bbq sauces for variety but I'm not a fan of the vinegar based sauce but the other 3 were good. For dessert we ordered the cheesecake which was delicious!!! I will be sure to return to this spot.Smoked half chicken $17.50Pulled pork/pulled chicken combo $15.75Cheesecake $7.25"
"I was debating between a 4-star and a 5-star rating, but I decided to prioritize the quality of food and not the other factors.Cons:It was very busy but the service was good. Could have been a little more attentive though. This place is also very expensive! Pros:The food was delicious!!! It was the BEST ribs I ever tried in my life. Me and my friend shared the Competition Ribs. They simply melt in your mouth. It was so good that we actually considered getting more.We'll definitely be back! It was a great trip!Steve G."
"Delicious southern BBQ food, southern BBQ atmosphere and southern friendly service! The atmosphere really does bring you ""home"" with the wooden accents on everything and the red and white plaid uniforms of the servers. It is quite large with an upstairs and downstairs. Restaurant seating is throughout but there are a couple of lounges with TVs to comfortable watch game, get appetizers and drink at. The food is definitely going to meet your craving of ""Mom's southern meals!"" The BBQ Appetizer flight was a perfect meal for me with a taste of each of their meats and a large cut of their cheddar corn bread! The people around me expressed their love just about everything else on the menu too! Be sure to come hungry so you can have enough of your meal and still have room for dessert. We loved their blueberry bit and the cookies! Ill be back soon Q!"
"After about a month of commenting on how cute this place looks from the outside, I finally made it in this weekend for brunch. q receives a definite 5 stars for ambiance. The decor is absolutely adorable and they have a cozy front patio area that's separated from the sidewalk by a white picket fence and flower boxes. The chairs outdoors have comfy cushions and large umbrellas provide some shade on hot summer days. Also, it was surprisingly peaceful on the patio given that it's less than a block away from Division and Dearborn.The food was great. We both started off with Bloody Marys, which were solid, but nothing special. Next, we were pleasantly surprised by large bowls of bread and butter pickles and BBQ chips brought to us in lieu of a bread basket. For our main meal, I ordered the smoked chicken eggs Benedict and he had the brisket hash. Both were awesome. The eggs Benedict were served on honey cornbread with succulent, smoky chicken smothered with delicious Hollandaise (heavy on the lemon, but I didn't mind). The hash consisted of tender chunks of brisket and potatoes topped with two eggs, which he ordered over easy. The eggs Benedict were served with breakfast potatoes, which were meh, while the hash was served with tasty cheddar chive biscuits. The biscuits were good, but the cheddar flavor was almost nonexistent and their texture was a little firm and not as flaky as I would have liked. The people sitting by us ordered the stuffed french toast and the breakfast sandwich, both of which looked a-mazing,Service was prompt and friendly. Definitely want to come back for dinner to try the BBQ. Anyone who beats Bobby Flay in a throw down is okay in my book."
"I went here on a business dinner with two other guys.  We ate a little of everything.  The apps were the best part in my opinion.  I had the smoked salmon.  Because you can get brisket, chicken, and pork on the appetizer is why i got the salmon.  It was cooked perfect.  Great food!"
"Have dined here several times now and decided it was 'bout time for a review!My husband and I call this ""fancy bbq"". Now, normally, when I add fancy to something, it means I think it's just ok (because it means the food isn't typically supposed to be ""fancy"".) In this case, however, I'm ok with fancy. Any place that brings pickles and chips to my table, gets extra points. The pickles are a bit sweeter and not my favorite but pickles nonetheless! I have tried many things on the menu including pulled chicken, the brisket and ribs. Never disappointed. The meat all comes dry with sauce on the side. We always have to ask for extra sauce because they bring it in ""fancy"" little bowls and it's never enough. They are always really great about bringing extra so, again, fancy is ok.The mac and cheese is delicious!!! I can skip the fried green tomatoes and I don't love their coleslaw or corn bread but the experience is always so great. They have a nice bar, with a lot of cocktails and beers to choose from. If you want to dig in and get dirty with your bbq then maybe you would prefer a different location (or maybe you just hope for a dark booth where no one will really see you) but if you haven't tried q then hurry in. The food, atmosphere and service have always been great!"
Completely sexy- with a fantastic bourbon selection. Very nice!
"The St Louis ribs and brisket are up there with the best BBQ in the city. The pickles and dry-rubbed chips (both complimentary) are a nice touch. If you're looking for good BBQ, you will find it here. Only complaint was the bar service. I ordered a manhattan, up, rye. They brought me a very frothy bourbon cocktail--from being vigorously shaken--and with almost no hint of bitters. This is a pretentious, geeky review, I know. But if you're trying to be a best-of-the-best BBQ and whiskey bar, these are the details you need to pay attention to. I didn't ask for a new one because I will drink bourbon. In fact I enjoyed it. But it is not what I ordered.I will give this place another shot if for no other reason than the food was excellent. Keeping my eye on the bartenders though."
"Everytime we are in Chi- we go here. I keep forgetting how good the food is. The quality never  goes down, and i can get a perfectly cooked fish here too.  The waiters are attentive and seem to always be in motion."
"Go. Just go. You'll thank me later.Incredible food, staff and ambiance. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable about the drink menu and of course the food. I had the ribs this time around and I have zero regrets. The Half-slab and corn bread was more than plenty for me. I bring almost all Chicago-visiting guests here."
"We were here for mothers day.  Loved the ambiance and the staff were incredibly courteous and helpful. We even got to meet the chef, Lee Ann Whippen, who came out to say hi despite how hectic it was in kitchen today. Apparently she's one of the rare few who have managed to beat bobby flay in his bbq throwdown. Loved the chargrilled oysters and farm-raised alligator appetizers.  Competition ribs were amazing!"
Bad ass BBQ and excellent service. Now I have to go back to Cleveland.....blah.
"What is this place doing here!I was in town for a Northwestern Game staying down the street when a friend suggested this place.  Oh my, I will never see Chicago BBQ the same way.  We started off with excellent service and friendly staff.  We made reservations, were seated quickly, were IMMEDIATELY provided with drinks and menus shortly thereafter.  Now, I am not normally much on appetizers but we ordered the BBQ sampler and did not look back.  I mean, we ate everything.  We had the Kobe Beef ribs for an appetizer.  We all ordered the competition beef ribs.  I got an extra order of brisket.  It was all amazing.  Tender, fall off the bone good.  All the time we were able to get drinks quickly, refills on water, refills on chips and pickles.  Yes, about those pickles.  Wow, Damm, Wow.  Just give it a try, and then tell me you don't like pickles.  Well,    There ya go.  A routine outing that turned into a Viking Feast.  I will be running for two weeks just to get back to a normal weight, and I would and will do it next time I am in town.  Do yourself a favor, go here.... Eat.    S"
"Awesome restaurant with the perfect combination of good food, genuine friendly service, and unique and friendly ambiance.  This is what a fun night out with friends in Chicago is all about.This is where I take out of town guests to when they want a taste of Chicago without the touristy BS."
"I had the Q2 dish, half pulled pork and half St. Louis ribs with french fries. We also ordered butter corn bread as a side. Everything was great!The only issue for me is the air. It was very cold inside!"
"Here's the good stuff:Service - Top notch. We threw all kinds of things (think chicken episode of Portlandia) at our server and he had answers for everything. Everyone was attentive and the timing of the food was perfect.Ambiance -  Cute and comfortable inside and outsideFood - For the most part. My partner ordered the St. Louis ribs and he couldn't say enough good things about them; tender, flavorful, made with love. The bacon cheddar hush puppies were also very good.There's only one thing that didn't put a smile on my face:My food: I ordered the Kobe brisket and while the flavor was good, it was pretty dry. I also ordered the honey butter cornbread which was gigantic and again, while the flavor was good (and a nice compliment to the brisket), it was a bit dry and a little too crumbly.It could have been a fluke, or had something to do with the fact that we were sitting outside. I would definitely return and recommend to others."
"WE LOVED CHICAGO Q. WE LOVE BBQ. WE LOVE EVERYTHING. IT'S HOMEY, THERE WAS NO WAIT, THE WAITER HIT ON JONNY. IT WAS MAGICAL. LOCATION... not super convenient, not inconvenient. JUST MAKE THE TRIPAMBIENCEfeels like eating at home, the decor is white, simple, woody. The waiters wore plaid and khakis, it was cute. Basically, a chic country style restaurant. FOODAlso, I... usually HATE pickles but they made me a believer. Seriously. Also, the homemade BBQ chips? HOLY. so good. Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies: MAGICAL. I am a hush puppy expert... okay not really but it was so so so good. I love bacon. I love cheddar. I love the sauce. Bruleed Macaroni and Cheese: so creamy. so sharp-cheesy. so delicious. Holy. just do it. just order it. do yourself a favor. Honey Butter Cornbread: so moist. sweet but not too sweet. we still dream about it. St. Louis Competition Ribs Full Rack (JUST DO IT): It was succulent, fall off the bone. Worth every penny and every calorie. The 4 sauces that they gave... were great. try all of them. Original Mild, Spicy, Eastern North Carolina Vinegar and South Carolina Mustard Sauce... We loved all of them separately. Pulled Pork Shoulder/Pulled Chicken: The chicken was tender and delicious. Pork Shoulder.. ehhhh it was alright. Next time, I'm definitely getting the ribs too. Fries: don't order them. They weren't great."
Such good food!  Plus the service was impecible.  The waiter had tons of suggestions and the drink menu and selection were delish!  Will definitely recommend
"I love Restaurant Week!  Each year I get to pick two restaurants I've never been to or would not normally try and stuff my face for a fraction of the normal cost.  My demanding school schedule only allowed me one free night this year, and after viewing the participating restaurants, Chicago Q emerged as the Chosen One.We were seated right away in the back corner of the restaurant.  We had a corner booth, which was disappointing, since I am positive my sore neck had to do with the need to tilt my head to the right the whole time to talk to my date.  The interior is certainly a far cry from the family reunion/birthday party/cookout/backyard BBQ I am used to, and the drink menu was a bit classier than Bud Light from a keg.  I settled on a Pimm's Cup.  Who knew a cocktail and meat overload would go so well together?With our drinks came a bowl of house-made potato chips (seasoned with BBQ, or something?) along with another bowl of buttery pickles.  I ate entirely too many chips and even forced myself to try a pickle, which I enjoyed.  They're delicious and they'll keep coming if you finish, so be careful not to eat too many!!  We decided to order from the Restaurant Week menu and (each of us) started with the BBQ flight, followed by the full slab of ribs (both St. Louis and Babyback), and finished up with the key lime pie.  The BBQ flight, consisting of pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket, along with a huge chunk of cornbread, is massive and could easily be a meal for one or shared between 2-3 people.  I was nearly in a food coma by the time I finished.  I couldn't throw the towel in just yet because my giant slab of ribs and second huge chunk of cornbread came out a few minutes later.  The ribs were meaty, delicious, and pretty much fell off the bone, but I only made it through half of them before calling it quits.  The key lime pie was airy and delicious, and wasn't too heavy to slam down at the end of the meal!  Each meat dish comes with 4 different flavors of sauces - my favorites were the spicy BBQ and the vinegar, with my least favorite being the mustard.  My one regret was that the cheddar hush puppies were not on the Restaurant Week menu - my mouth was salivating at the thought of them, and I haven't even tried them yet!While the Restaurant Week menu offered a good variety of everything on their menu, I think one would be fine ordering a shared appetizer, a half slab or ribs, and (maybe) squeezing in a dessert.  Between the two of us we had leftovers for 3 days!All in all, a great experience, and super competitive prices for the area/food/portions.  Forget the piles of napkins, paper plates, and the red picnic tablecloth - Chicago Q gets you all covered in BBQ and greasy meat, but in a much classier setting than your typical barbecue.  I'd happily go back!"
"I'm in Love.  That's capitalized, so you know it's serious.  My affinity for anything bbq'd is not exactly a secret.  No sauce, with sauce, vinegar sauce, I really don't care, I just want some smoked meat.  Regardless of my cravings for everything bbq, I still would have loved Chicago q.  The service was great, the food was delicious, and the dining room was gorgeous.  What more can a girl ask for?Most importantly, the food.  Yum.  We started, as all tables do, with a bowl of pickles and a bowl of potato chips.  I believe the chips were bbq flavored, but don't quote me on that.  The pickles were very good, and they sell them by the jar.  I seriously would have bought a jar, but I thought I'd try this ploy... ""I need to go to Chicago q to get a jar of pickles.  You know what, let's just have dinner there"" and that would be a good trick that would result in me eating more smoked meat.  I started with the shrimp and grits, so good.  Bbq shrimp with lemon infused grits, a perfect sized appetizer.  For my entree I had the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw.  The server brought a plate with 4 different bbq sauces nestled on it.  I'm a sissy, so I liked the mild/sweet one.  I snarfed as much of my smoked meat and coleslaw as I thought was feminine and then decided I was taking the rest home.  There was still enough left for another meal.  But wait, we haven't talked about dessert yet.  He was having the Restaurant Week prix fix, which included milk and cookies for dessert.  He shared, such a nice boy, and I ordered the oatmeal bacon cookie.  It's oatmeal and bacon.  In a cookie.  All together.  In a cookie.  Smoked meat and oatmeal all mixed together?!  In a cookie!  Deliciousness.The service was great.  We showed up at 7ish on Restaurant Week Saturday with no reservation and we were seated in 15 minutes.  That was an excellent start to the evening.  The server was very nice and attentive, as well as knowledgeable.  The decor reminded me of some of the nice restaurants in Jackson Hole.  A warm and welcoming sophisticated country theme.  The dining room was much larger than I expected.  The place is huge really.  I didn't realize there was such a large upstairs.  It wasn't ridiculously loud though, you can still carry on a conversation without bothering the people next to you.  There are currently two restaurants on my list in Chicago that I'm yearning to get back to (both involve smoked meat) Chicago q is now at the top of the list."
"The Prettiest BBQ joint I've ever been to.Which is not to say it isn't manly.The rub on the ""competition style"" St. Louis is like if Jesus made a rub, and then got it tweaked by Superman, and then a third draft by Remi the Rat from Ratatouille.The pulled pork is some of the best I've had.And all three of their sauces are completely different, yet all special. Just like children.Bonus points for having fancy sod and big ice cubes.Will be back."
"The baby back ribs are served without sauce and you have four to choose from including an incredible spicy sauce. The smoked flavor of the moist pork is just tremendous as was the beer selection. While the rest of the menu looks very attractive, the next time I'm back, I'm getting the baby back! The ambience seemed a bit weird  and loud due to Saint Patrick's Day festivities (or perhaps this is the way it always is). The service was incredible. It seemed we were being attended to every 2 three minutes."
"We dined here during restaurant week and were pleasantly surprised.I am not a huge pickle fan, but found the house made bread and butter pickles fantastic! I started with the lemon shrimp and grits which were ok, but I preferred the bbq flight. The mustard sauce is delish. You get a lot of food. A lot. By the time our entrees (brisket and ribs) arrived we were too stuffed to take more than a few bites.Of course, there's always room for dessert though! We had the milk and cookies and key lime pie. The server said the key lime pie was the best dessert on the menu and he was not lying. It wasn't too tart, but just had enough citrus buried under the creamy texture. I've been on an obsessive recipe search since. Service was exceptional. Our water glasses never went empty and the entire waitstaff was very attentive. As busy as it was, the chef took time to give us a tour of the kitchen. Chef Whippen is super nice and made us feel at home. Not only does she make a killer key lime pie, she's got the southern hospitality down pat.Their brunch menu sounds awesome and I would definitely return to try it."
"My husband and I had an early dinner here a few months back (I know...kinda late, but I could've sworn I already wrote a Yelp review on this place).  We didn't have reservations, but it wasn't quite dinner time and they were happy to seat us.  First impressions...loved the modern but comfortable decor and natural sunlight filtering in through the skylights.  I'm sure they spent some money on design.  The service was prompt, and we got a big, complimentary plate of pickles and bbq potato chips to whet our appetites (as if the heavenly smell wasn't enough).  Unfortunately, we kinda choked when we saw the prices on the menu, especially for their famous(?) ""competition"" bbq.  Our waiter explained that the chef/owner competed nationally, as well as on a televised bbq cook-off, and this was her recipe.  As curious as we were, we didn't want to fork over +$30 a plate when we knew we could gorge on dah-licious and CHEAP bbq elsewhere.   We settled for their standard pulled pork, hush puppies, slaw, and beans; all tasty, but not quite as memorable as the sticker shock.We're glad we stopped in...great ambiance and service...but we probably won't eat here again the next time we visit Chicago."
"Very good barbeque. Started things off with a mint julep and some homemade chips with pickles - classic and delicious. Brisket with mashed potatoes was really tasty too, and the warm hospitality rings true to the southern vibe."
My party and I sat outside and the setting was pretty nice overall. The pickles that we were given when we were seating were very tasty and probably were the highlight. Our waiter was really nice however he kept forgetting to bring us things that we asked for and messed up orders a few times. My pulled chicken sandwich really wasn't that good and tasted a little dry. I would however go again if I'm in town to try something else.
"This place is amazing!  I couldn't stop eating the homemade BBQ potato chips and pickles.  I'd seriously go back just for that.  I had the pulled chicken sandwich with coleslaw.  I loved the four sauces they bring out.The service couldn't have been better.  They are so attentive.The only negative thing I felt was that it was extremely loud in there, to the point where it was hard to carry on a conversation with the person I was with.I've been thinking about Chicago q ever since I went and I will definitely go back!!!"
"First let me say I love BBQ. I mean love BBQ. So what a great opportunity to take advantage of restaurant week with a trip to this BBQ place. When you walk up it look like a quaint little cottage and it has really nice decor. I was seated when I stated my name I later learned I was not checked in on my Open table reservation after asking twice about it. So at the table are some wonderful pickles and home made chips they were so tasty and made me excited for the meal. 1.) Homemade Lemonade- Did not take homemade. Tasted like Simple syrup with lemon juice. I like to see some pulp in homemade juices 2.) Bacon and Cheddar hush Puppies - I love hush puppies but they were over fried. So dark and hard on the outside. and came with a Chipotle aoli. And if you read my reviews I HATE CHIPOTLE. So I had one plain. 3.) ""Kobe"" Brisket - Eh nothing spectacular tasted like regular old brisket to me. The BBQ sauces it came with were OK. A North Carolina vinegar sauce was the most questionable for me. I love love love love fries. But I did not like these again they were overcooked. The person on the fry station must have been distracted or something 4.) Honey butter cornbread- At first you think oh wow that is going to be so good and it is brought out on a cast iron skillet so you think yumm nice and warm WRONG!!! It must have been precut becuase the edges were hard and it was definitely not warm and very crumbly. 5.) Dessert- I was so looking forward to the seasonal cobbler or pie when I was told it is Key Lime Pie. Really key lime. Isn't that a summer fruit it is February. Carrot cake was another option so I chose that. And it came all nice and pretty as you can see from my photos and then I cut and bite and COLD! Cold cake! I do not like my cake cold unless it is cheesecake. So let me say that the service was even worse than my food experience there were only three tables being occupied and my waitress came maybe twice. Oh and I would say her name but she never told me. I kind of felt that as soon as I started ordering from the restaurant week menu she was done with me. I seen all the 4 and 5 stars and I rarely give a one star but my expectation where high and the service was low!"
"Absolutely love Chicago Q!  The food is amazing - I haven't had anything I didn't like here.  Complimentary chips and pickles are fantastic.  I then always order the hush puppies - they are cooked to perfection and I love the spicy sauce they are paired with.  Usually go with the pulled pork or chicken and I'm a sucker for the four bbq sauces - traditional, hot, vinegar and mustard.  I typically use all four, making stripes down my sandwich!  My absolutely favorite would be the mustard. (Side note, you can now buy bottles of their sauces = awesome!)  There is always someone in my party that gets the ribs and raves about them.  I also have to have a side of mac and cheese, which is oh so gooey good.  Tried the seasonal chili on my last visit and it was great - especially like the cornbread croutons!Also love the atmosphere at Q - have been here for dates, birthdays and holidays.  Highly recommend!"
"So I lived in Atlanta for a year. And after a year of basking in arguably one of the top BBQ regions in the US ... q came up well short for me. I've heard a lot of great things about q but it was a very forgettable experience from a food standpoint. I got the St. Louis ribs, kobe sliced brisket, and mac and cheese ... I'll go as far as saying it was decent but nothing to rave about. And I'm going to go out on a limb and say the pickles that they give you when you first sit down may have been the best part of the meal ... as I'm still trying to finish my $10 jack and coke cause it's a little too steep to swallow."
"It's only NOT a five star rating, because it's not quite KC Barbecue quality which is the standard I put against all other BBQ restaurants after it.First, it was a busy Saturday night but I booked a reservation three days in advance and did not wait a single minute for our table.  We were rushed upstairs to our seating next to the TV lounge area and had a great view overlooking the rest of the restaurant including an incredible glowing collage of the Virginia countryside where apparently the owner once lived.  The entire room was incredibly well lit and the finishes throughout the restaurant and bar were clean and modern looking.Our server was attentive and very well-versed in the entire menu and immediately recommended two great starters for us - the mac n cheese and kobe beef baked beans!  We paired them with our pulled pork and pulled chicken entrees and it was an incredible mix of meat, beans, and pasta!  There were also four custom sauces to dip from and all were very tasty - even the tarty mustard-based sauce.The whole night was incredible and we had tons of leftovers to boot!  Thank you fore everything."
"Non food Highlights-- service was great. Our waiter was friendly and down to earth- have great drink selection, from bud lights to pimms cups-  the whole feel of the place is very neat. It looks upscale from the outside, but not all pretentious- the upstairs reminded me of a lofted area in a plantation house. It looked as though there was a room you could rent out which was beautiful- looked like a bachelor party was there Food highlights-- big portions- comes with 4 BBQ sauces - cornbread is awesome!- price is great for food and location of the restaurant- hushpuppies worth a try- chocolate mousse pretzel crust salted caramel dessert is a MUST!! My favorite part of the meal- a real stand out Not a huge fan of the Mac and cheese. We got a few combo platters. None of the meats were out of this world, but consistently good."
"This place is amazing!There probably isn't anything more to say, but I recommend the Pulled Pork."
"I've never been a big bbq fan and I recently realized I just don't really love bbq sauce.. But Chicago Q helped me look past this by establishing that bbq doesn't just mean the sauce. It means amazingly cured/smoked red meat products. And that my friends is something I can get behind. I've been here twice for dinner & brunch, and both times I found my meal to be very good, prices extremely reasonable and portions fit for a king. I challenge the average person to walk out of here without a doggie bag.  Only 4 stars because both times I've been there I wish I had ordered better, or maybe it's just that I know food tastes better off other peoples plates."
"I really like Q, and the food is always delicious.  They have an excellent wine selection, and the BBQ sauces are delicious.  It's a fun restaurant to go to when you want to chill out on a week night.  I love the concept of BBQ food in a more urban setting.  And the chili is so good."
"Q looks fancy from the outside so I was pleasantly surprised when the inside was open and more relaxed- a large photo of a country road was hanging near our table, very fitting.The food is very good- you get hearty portions at a fair price. I enjoyed mixing and matching with the 3 different sauces. The brisket and pulled pork were my favorite. The chicken and baby back ribs weren't anything extraordinary. For dessert we had cobbler at that was awesome; definitely save room for dessert!"
"A good BBQ place with reasonably generous portions, kind service and a fun atmosphere. Chicago q is a large restaurant with a unique style. Food comes out quite quick, especially if you order one of their ""pulled"" dishes. The food could have been hotter and less ""heat lamp"" oriented, but the flavors were still decent enough. The three or four sauces provided lacked any unique signature if you will. This style of restaurant should spend more time on the sauce as it could create a more memorable experience. Their hot sauce was not hot! Service was good, but I was a bit appalled when the server recommended a beer he said was absolutely amazing and never tried it. The beer, Turbo Dog, was good but for him not to have tried something he recommended so strongly is poor technique. Overall good price points and attitude.Something worth trying, but not sure if it is the best BBQ place in Chicago. Good luck!!"
"I made reservations at q for a Saturday night when my parents were in town, knowing my dad would love the BBQ and my mom would enjoy the southern-style food. My friend also joined us for the evening.We had hoped for a booth, but the atmosphere felt just as cozy at our table, despite the fact that we were seated in the center of the dining room. I had heard going things about the Pimm's Cup - so my friend and I decided to go for it. My parents both opted for wine. Apparently the ""good"" aspects of the Pimm's Cup referred to its potency...which I can't complain about. It was bit stiff for my first drink of the night, but we were able to down them by the end of the meal. We were also given complimentary chips, bread and pickles - I hate pickles, yet couldn't stop eating these. Go figure.We started with the Hominy, Smoked Corn and Black Beans Salad, which was delicious and very fresh. In retrospect, we really didn't need it considering the amount of food that came with our meals, but we enjoyed it nonetheless.We all ordered the pulled pork shoulder except my mom, who ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The pork itself was delicious, as were the sauce options that come with it. I'm a major sauce person, as is my dad - four sauces is a big deal. The North Carolina Vinegar and South Carolina Mustard were my favorites, though you can't go wrong with any of them. I'm fairly certain we managed to order almost every side among the four of us, but I only remember mine. I chose the bruleed mac and cheese and seasonal vegetables - both were wonderful. As others have mentioned, the service was great and very attentive (without being overbearing) throughout the meal; no complaints there. Overall, an excellent meal and first experience at q - I'll definitely be back. Bonus points for the location...I'm always a fan of a great restaurant nearby in the Gold Coast :)"
"I have to say, I've been lucky to have recently been to both Memphis and Kansas City and had some wonderful bbq, but Chicago Q, which stands as a bit more contemporary and slighly upscale restaurant, was SENSATIONAL. I sat at the bar with for lunch on a Saturday. The service was excellent. The bartender was knowledgeable about the food and the beer selection, which had some nice pairings for BBQ. I started with the cheddar bacon hushpuppies, which were spicy and delicious. From there, I hit the Pulled Pork Sandwich. The pork was phenomenal, as were all four of the sauces. I loved the South Carolina Mustard Sauce, but the Spicy was my fave (see a pattern developing for my love of spicy food). The cole slaw was also excellent.All in all, this is a must stop next time you are in the gold coast!"
"I recently figured out that I love BBQ after a childhood where I never really ate it, so I have felt the need to try the best spots in the city. Chicago Q is top notch for a cool, trendy atmosphere (not what everyone wants in a BBQ joint but I dug it). Service was also very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately I was not a huge fan of the food. Had pulled chicken, pulled pork, and St Louis Ribs. The food came out in 5 minutes but it was all luke warm at best, closer to cold. That really took away from any enjoyment. The free pickles and chips were a nice touch and very good, and they had good fries (the only dish that came out hot). As far as BBQ, Smoque had significantly better for more reasonable prices. Q was a little steep for BBQ."
"Chicago q is a fantastic place in Chicago to go for some really, really good bbq.  For starters, the waiter brings out a bowl of butter pickles that are pretty sweet and leave you wanting for more.  You are also brought out some BBq chips that went really well with the butter pickles when combined.What I really wanted to try at the ""q"" was the Kobe Beef Ribs but, unfortunately, they were out of them when I got there :(  I ended up ordering the St. Louis Half Slab of ribs and they turned out to be amazing.  The meat was fall-off-the-bone and it was just incredibly tender.  They also give you a generous side of coleslaw or, if you prefer, fries.  Along with your slab of ribs, you get to pick from 4 different bbq sauces, such as, Original, Spicy, Eastern North Carolina Vinegar, or South Carolina Mustard Sauce.  For me, I really enjoyed the Mustard Sauce and the Spicy the most although the others held their own just fine.  Naturally, I just had to try out something from their drink menu and I ended up choosing the Whistlepig Straight Rye Whiskey and all I can say about that is, ""lskafjoivnuroai%@!!**!""  It was a mighty fine drink indeed and it went very well with the ribs & sauce.  I will say that you will pay a hefty bill when you are through if you order a 3 course meal plus drinks and tip.  The food, to me, was very good and the service was outstanding.  You have the option of eating indoors or out and you really couldn't go wrong either way.  Check it out!-Papa Bear"
"Not being from the South, I have no idea how ""authentic"" this place is.  And Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn: when I crave meat in my mouth, this is where I go.  My Yankee ass leaves happy every time.I love this place, and so does pretty much everyone I take here.  I could live on the bread-n-butter pickles alone.  But cucumbers do not a BBQ make.  I like to split a half order of St. Louis style ribs (the meat literally falls off the bone) and a pulled pork and chicken plate.  They also make a great mint julep on real shaved ice in a big frosty metal cup-- perfect for hot nights outside.  Oh yeah."
"I was hoping to expect the same mouth watering flavors from the restaurant after tasting the food from the rib fest this summer. Was I disappointed...eh. The appetizers did it for me. The rub on the chips and the pickles were so good. The waiter said the food takes 5 minutes to serve. Well, it took more like 12. In some restaurants that's not a bad thing. But when the waiter sets the expectations it's not a good thing either. When the food was delivered it was quite a bit of it. I ordered the St. Louis ribs, pulled pork and cornbread. The smoke ring on the ribs was beautiful and the taste was excellent. The pulled pork a little dry but the cornbread was sweetly divine. My boyfriend had the mac & cheese with baked beans. They both were alright. Nothing to write home about. The sauces were ok: mustard; chili; vinegar & mild. The mustard sauce was at best..eh. I would say the chili & mild were the best of the 4. The food was not served on hot plates and therefore got cold really fast. I wanted to enjoy the food more considering she's one of few competition women in bbq. Recently coming in 2nd place in a Vegas competition. One good thing about having dinner at Q was the company. They made it worthwhile."
"This place is so perfectly designed, it is welcoming and feels open and fresh.  Then the food comes!  The chips and pickles are out of this world, a perfect combination of flavors.  Yes, you'll finish them all.  We had the Benedict Trio, off the charts amazing! For desert we had the seasonal choice of key lime pie, perfect blend of cream in the filling with sweetness in the crust.  We went back the next day for lunch and took our leftovers all the way back to LA, where the kids attacked the leftovers like lions!  Even the dog got to taste a rib bone.  The owner gave us a tour of the kitchen and it was really impressive to say the least.  Let's all pray she opens one in LA : )"
"High-end and BBQ are not two things you normally put together, but q has brought it to Chicago and demonstrated how to do it well.  The dark wood tables and off-white painted walls make you feel like you're almost in an old Southern mansion, except more updated with the enlarged photograph of a country road which brings contemporary flair.  The staff wear plaid long sleeve shirts which balances the semi-formal ambiance to keep it relaxed.I don't think you can go wrong on the menu - all the meats are good.  We had the St. Louis ribs which are prepared with a dry rub and then you have the option of slathering them at the table with one of three sauces:  mild, vineagar-based, and spicy.  Some may be a bit disappointed that the sauce is not basted on during the cooking, but to keep things simple and play to different palettes I assume q's approach is the best compromise.The mac n' cheese side is absolutely wonderful - fresh cheese, light breaded crust on top - one of the best I've ever had.  They also make their own potato chips and cucumber pickles to get you started off.  If you can, save room for the classic american desserts and pies which are so tasty you'll want to keep eating even if your full from your slab of ribs.Grab a Pimm's cup, order a slab and update your BBQ!"
"Food= 4.5 starsService= 2 starsAtmosphere=4 starsLong story short, our waitress sucked. The food was excellent- starts off with crispy chips and butter pickles, which were great. The BBQ flight, Shrimp and Lemon Infused-Grits (wow) and ribs- all great. The waitress took our order and didn't reappear until midway through the entrees. Not personable or remotely friendly. You at least get a 'thanks' when the bill gets dropped off at any crappy diner, but not from our server at q. Thankfully the bussers were attentive and friendly."
"Went to the Q about three months ago. Great experience, wonderful interior and excellent service. I had the ribs, which were some of the best cooked I've had; they were tender, well glazed and fell right off the bone. They were served with a variety of dipping sauces, all of which were amazing. Surprised by how good the mixed drinks were, as I was not expecting this from a bbq place. Definitely looking forward to coming back."
"So good.I walked in the door and read the menu - felt right at home.  As a displaced Southerner, I appreciate any place up North that serves comfort food - as I define it.They had many craft beers on tap and my waiter was great about finding out what I like and guiding me towards a beer I would like.  She did.  I had a great a Belgian wheat - Sheet Metal Blond.While I was waiting, they brought out housemade bread and butter pickles and bbq chips.  Mmmm, good.I decided to try many things so that I could get a taste for what Q had to offer.I opted for the pulled pork and half slab of St. Louis ribs.  Everything is smoked but doesn't have any sauce ... yet.  They bring out 4 different options:  a spicy bbq (that's really spicy), a Carolina mustard, a Carolina vinegar, and an original mild.  I tried them all.  I mostly enjoyed the Carolina vinegar and the original mild.  Yum.I also ordered a few ""premium sides.""  Cole slaw came with my plate.  I ordered the braised greens, brulee'd mac and cheese, and some of their cornbread.  The cole slaw was perfect - not too mayonaise-ish and creamy, but really good.  The braised greens I was really looking forward to - and they were alright.  Not amazing, but that maybe because I grew up eating amazing greens in Georgia.  The brulee'd mac and cheese was highly touted in some people's reviews.  It was pretty good - but didn't quite live up to the hype of some reviewers on Yelp.  The cornbread was good - and it came as a huge block.  Huge I tell you.My waiter was really good.  She was sharp and funny.  My food came out incredibly quick and she almost apologized - letting me know that I was in no way being rushed.  So I sat and enjoyed my food.They brought me out a lemon and a lava hot towel to wash my hands after dinner was finished.  Very thoughtful.Next time I will sample the incredible bourbon/whisky selection.  It was pretty good.Everything was really good.They had some outside seating and the interior was very cool.  It felt a little more upscale than the pricing suggested.  Cool, relaxed vibe.Will I go back?  Yes.  Will I recommend it to others?  Yes."
"This is some of the best BBQ I've ever eaten! I am not  a huge BBQ fan, so this really says a lot about how much I enjoyed my meal at Q. On a random weekday night, before heading out  to Zoo Lights, my boyfriend and I decided to try out Chicago Q.  I had seen Chef Lee Ann's episode on the Food Network's Throwdown with Bobby Flay and decided that I had to try this place.After walking in you quickly realize that this is not your typical Chicago-style barbecue joint with aquarium smokers and meager decor.  The inside looks like a southern mansion converted into a restaurant. The decorations were very unique and cute.The restaurant was not too busy that night, and we got a table right next to the open kitchen, which is pretty sweet. Chef Lee Ann was greeting people, and she seemed really friendly and bubbly. Too bad she didn't come say hi to us. :(Every table gets complimentary, homemade pickles and potato chips dusted with a rub.  These were excellent--we asked for many refills.For our dinner, we decided to share the Kobe Chopped Brisket Sandwich and the Pulled Pork Shoulder. Note: I really don't care for smokey bbq, but this one was done just right.  You could see the pink smoke ring on the meat, but the smokey flavor did not dominate.  The chefs obviously know what they're doing with their meat.  I highly recommend the shoulder! It was so juicy, full of flavor, and not too smokey.  The Kobe beef was very succulent and you can tell it's a better quality of beef than most of the brisket you see in this city...BUT the shoulder was better. :)  The meat comes with all three of their sauces (Original Mild, Spicy, and Eastern North Carolina Vinegar).  Definitely go with the vinegar-based sauce on the pulled pork.  We liked the spicy sauce on the brisket.For our sides we selected cornbread and coleslaw.   The cornbread was simple, moist, and flavorful.  The coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my liking but still A-OK and went well with the pulled pork.  We also got an extra side of baked beans which were delicious. The service was excellent. The waitress was attentive and our glasses were filled with water all the time.I do wish the atmosphere was a bit more laid back...I mean, who eats BBQ in their suits and ties??? But it is in Gold Coast afterall, what do you expect?We will be back when I am in the mood for some 'cue again!"
"Scott and Jesse waited on us. Jesse is right on whisking away done plates and filling our water, never far from us!  Scott was incredible.  being that we were first timers, he totally nixed our order and suggested we get a variety plate to try most of what they offer. and did the wings appetizer.  wow, everything was so good.  sauces were fantastic and I couldnt stop eating the butter pickles, ate the whole bowl.  Jesse took us to the kitchen and gave us a tour and we got to meet Lee Ann!  that was  real treat. Yes we will be back!  oh and the best part (well besides meeting Lee Ann...) our food portion of the bill was only $44!!!"
"Mixed review here... We had a party of 12. We were seated promptly, orders taken quickly, food arrived fast and was very good. Based on that I would have given it a  4/5, but... I must have been asked 6-7 times if I was finished along with so e of the other guests. They started wiping down the table while we were still eating!!! The bus boy even picked up our glasses by the rim with his hands that he just bussed tables with - gross! I get they are busy and need tables, but we wanted to get desert and didnt b/c we felt soooo rushed. It was seriously really bad. If you dot mind getting locked out of your seats before you swallow your last bite, then go for it cause the food was great. Sad to say, I don't think I'll return."
"After getting hyped reviews from friends, we decided to take a group to Q. We had a group of 8 squeezed into two small tables- it was tight, but that is typical of city dining. Chips to start we're ok but mostly crumbs like they were dug out of the bottom of a bag. Pickles were pretty good. Try putting a pickle on the chip for a little adventure! Service was slow but water glasses were full. I got the St. Louis ribs (standard not competition) and brisket combo with cornbread. Wife got the standard baby back ribs. The ribs were extremely fatty, like way way way to fatty. The fat should have been trimmed before cooking as it made eating these ribs a blubbery mess. If I wanted globs of pork fat, I would hang out with my Russian homies and grab some sala and vodka. The ribs fall off the bone more than I like and are not the hearty meaty kind. Also, the sauce situation is a pain. Who serves sauce in cups with spoons? Just give us fun squeeze bottles and call it a day. The spooning sauce thing is a pain in the ass and they barely give you any sauce- we had to keep asking for more.  Overall, I won't be back. Too many other options around town that aren't as expensive and serve better BBQ. Btw their in house grape soda is great!"
"A coveted 5 star rating?  I know, but after searching for a negative for Q, I couldn't find one.  Everything was outstanding from the kettle chips and pickles to the key lime pie.  I went here with four coworkers when one of our colleagues was in from London for some 'teambuilding.'  Upon walking in, it's much larger than it looks from the outside.  The best way I could describe it is upscale farmhouse.  It's clean and Southern decor, but the upstairs is quite posh.  We walk in and go to the hostess stand.  As one went to go check on our table, Lee Ann Whippen came over and was doing something and then left.  So I look at the other hostess still there and said, 'wow, she's really here huh?"" to which she replied, 'oh yea, Monday through Friday!'  I was so excited.  I think for me meeting an awesome chef is how most people get if they were to meet some Hollywood douchebag.  As soon as we got to the table, we got kettle chips and garlic pickles.  Now, I love me some bread baskets but sometimes is really nice when you get something other than the standard.  Garlic pickles?  I mean why has no one thought of this before.  Yes, there are whole garlic cloves in there and yes, I ate one.  So then to my pleasant surprise, Lee Ann comes over to our table to chat!  She recommended the shrimp and grits for an app, and she said it wasn't on the menu, but for ribs (other than the competition ribs) you get get a full slab but half baby back and half spare ribs.  Excellent idea since I know most people prefer baby back but I prefer spare.  She also recommended the corn bread over the other sides, although unfortunately I didn't try any because my carbs were dominated by the cheddar poblano cornbread we were sold on last minute (yum, by the way).  When comparing it to the goat cheese cornbread at Table 52, tough call.  I suggest a yes to both, lol.  The head chef coming out to the table though to me is what separates a 4 star and a 5 star place so that was quite nice.Onto the food.  Yes, it was a Monday but wow they have superb service.  The shrimp came out about 5 minutes after we ordered it.  So the shrimp were barbecued and, well, shrimp.  Nothing spectacular there.  But the grits...if there's food in heaven, I'm fairly certain it's these grits.  I want some more, like, now.  So after these, we decided to order a bunch of food for the five of us to share.  We went with the Q3 and got pulled pork, half chicken, and brisket.  The brisket was good, but not the standout to me.  The chicken was really good.  Completely tender and succulent, but the pulled pork was the star.  They bring out four sauces and I feel I'm not doing my review justice by not trying them all but the spicy one was so good I couldn't stop.  I had to order more of it!  We also got some mac and cheese because you can't go wrong with that.  Then onto the ribs.  I had one of each.  They were awesome!  So after 3 meats, cornbread, mac and cheese, and a slab of ribs, what else would you get?  More ribs of course!  We were still a tad hungry and decided to get the competition ribs.  Yea I thought the prior ribs were good but these were out of this world.  We actually had to poll the table afterwards to see who liked the regular slab and who liked the competition.  The competition won by a slim 3-2 margin.  The competition was unbelievably tender and very meaty and just what I dream ribs are about.  After eating enough food to feed a small country, we opted for key lime pie.  Our Londoner wanted to try so we all took a bit.  I'm not a huge key lime pie fan but this was outstanding.  It wasn't as tart as I typically find in key lime.  It was extremely light and airy as well.  Moral of the story, I want to go back.  Actually, not sure what I'm doing writing this review when I should be on my way back to Q!"
"I had an amazing experience at Q recently. Heard great things and made reservations for an early Father's day dinner there. I think it'd be a really long wait to eat there without a reservation. Like everyone said, they served free pickles and chips when you're seated. Best.Pickles.Evar. We shared the BBQ flight, and the Kobe brisket was to die for. I think I'm going to order the entree the next time I'm there. The mac and cheese is also something to get as a side. It was light and fluffy, but the cheese was rich and creamy. Most of us had the St. Louis ribs, which was good. I liked that they gave you BBQ on the side. We had the best server. He was polite, knew his stuff, and wasn't obnoxious. In fact, the entire staff was great. The ambience was great too. I liked the southern style home-y feeling the restaurant had. Apparently they serve brunch, which our server told us about. Definitely checking that out sooner rather than later."
We liked our busser Jesse and our server Meg very much. Jesse offered to show us the smoker and was very knowledgeable about all the areas of the kitchen and man that smoker is huge and needs a name!  Meg knew so much about  the beer and her suggestion of the Pranqster was great! The baby back ribs were great too! I like a place like this where the busser is not just the one picking up our dirty dishes but engaging us in conversation as he offers to do so!
I have never eaten at the restaurant only gotten take away.  I will tell you that this is the best barbecue in the city.  Seriously.No other BBQ I've had in Chicago can touch this place.  it is *that* good.  seriously.and make sure they give you some of their home made chips. Damn they are delicious.  and the pickles too! MmmMM!
"Cue the accolades! Holy cow; (no pun intended) that meal was beyond satisfying. I was excited to learn that they serve lunch, and this is just under a one mile walk from my Michigan Ave. office. I'm already dreaming of when I can have the bruleed mac n cheese again! My bf and I met another couple to celebrate their recent engagement this past Friday night. I made reservations in advance, and thank heavens I did! It was PACKED as a recent Michelin winning restaurant should be. Our friends were running a tad late due to the insane traffic and bad weather. (They go hand-in-hand here in Chi-town.). So we cozied up to the bar and selected some very Kentucky Derby-esque cocktails- Pimm's Cup and Mint Julep (see attached picture). The Pimms Cup, otherwise known amongst my friends as the ""Pimp's Cup"" came lavishly adorned with citrus and cucumbers on the rim. It even had some in the drink as well, think sangria. The Mint Julep was a kick in the esophogus. No, seriously, it was like liquid fire that definitely warmed me right up from the serious frigid temps outside. Ok, enough about the drinks. How cool was it that instead of a bread basket, you were served homemade pub chips and pickes? DELISH! I think we had at least 3 bowls of the stuff. I'm a pickle fiend! We ordered an appetizer to share with the table, and decided on the House Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies. The waiter even said he would add a few more to the plate to ensure we each got two pups. Thanks dude! These were warm, crunchy and a LIL hot. (Warning: Please allow them to cool a few mins before biting into these hot suckers. I burned the roof of my mouth with the hot oil that was still nestled inside my pup. Ouchie!)Now, onto the main course! We both ordered sandwiches which came came along with your choice of coleslaw, cornbread or fries. My bf ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich and opted for the cornbread. I ordered the Kobe Chopped Brisket Sandwich and opted for the cornbread as well. We also ordered a side of the Bruleed Macaroni and Cheese. I have to admit I liked my boyfriends' option better. The pork was tender and smokey, and came served upon a pretzel roll. I was totally jealous. My brisket was not very tender and had a lot of grisle. I just wasn't WOWED. My dad makes smoked brisket in his smoker at home, and found that I liked his better. Next time, I'm definitely going for that pretzel roll piled high with pork! Aaaand, I'm going to stack some of those sumptuous pickles on it too. MM MMMAlong with your sammies came a trio of sauces from mild to Carolina vinegar and the bold. I loved the bold sauce! The only thing that bothered me was the pushy tendency of the bus boys and our server. I know it was a packed house, but we were languishing over our hearty meal and having a good time. I felt a bit rushed considering they stopped at our table seven times asking us if we wanted boxes. We all were a bit miffed about that. I definitely would like to be part of the lunchtime crowd sooner rather than later. Hope to see you again soon Q!"
Huge portion! So good !
"Everything was top shelf. We started with a plate of hushpuppies and a sampler trio of kobi beef, pulled pork, and pulled chicken. Sauces were on the side - the Carolina sauce was the hottest of the 3. The other two were a toss-up for the best.One had fall off the bone baby back ribs, one had the pulled pork sandwich, and one had the kobi beef brisket. All were delicious. Cornbread and coleslaw were very good also.The poundcake club for dessert will surprise you. Not a combo you would expect but distinctively different....and very good.Oh - the wait staff - very attentive and efficient - and friendly.As an added bonus we had a tour of the kitchen and met one of the sou chef's.I will be back!"
Truly amazing and mouthwatering pulled pork and baby back ribs and the dipping sauces were fun and tasty. Sliced Kobe brisket was uninspiring.Service was friendly and professional. Great cocktails and wine.We'll be back!!
"This is another disappointing Chicago BBQ joint.  The wings are overcooked messes of BBQ sauce and not smoked at all.  The ribs are overcooked and below average.  The salads are basic and lack flavor aside from anchovy-heavy dressing.  The cole slaw has more mayo than cabbage and service is very slow.  To cap it all off, a meal for 3 cost nearly $125.  The really sad part is that we had a decent meal there last month but after two bad experiences. the good meal seems to be an anomaly.  We will not be giving this place our business anymore and we feel bad for Chicagoans that actually think this constitutes decent BBQ."
"Wow...wish we had room for dessert! If the basic ribs were great - can't imagine what the ""competition"" ribs tasted like!Pass on the second offer of free BBQ chips...too much other goodness!! Kobe brisket is great - love the watermelon salad...very fresh. Hush puppies were a bit doughy - but not greasy. We will be back for Sunday brunch!!"
"I like the restaurant setting.  It's large but kind of cozy at the same time.  The lunch crowd wasn't that bad for a Friday, either.  The food portions are pretty darned good, but the quality was barely above average only.  Their sauces aren't really anything to write home about.  The spicy sauce was no different than the original, except the spicy had a few red chili flakes in it.  My brisket was a little dry, but the mustard sauce made up for that.  Service is excellent, btw.If you're in the mood for 'q' and you happen to be in the area, this place will suffice.  Unfortunately, the prices will drive away most folks who can't (or choose not to) afford a $13 dry-ish brisket sandwich."
"After one bite of the pickles, I knew I was in love - in love with a PICKLE.Seriously, I crave these pickles all the time, trying to get my friends to come to q with me so that I could just eat bowls and bowls full of pickles.By the time dinner or lunch or brunch has come out, I'm not even that hungry. Not to say that the pulled pork or chicken or whatever you choose isn't great, because it is - plus I love having so many options for sauces, but I really just want those pickles.This is convenient, because after I dragged yet another friend with me, he noticed that you can buy jars of their house-made pickles. Yes, please.  I'll have another bowl of pickles. As long as the server doesn't whisk away that bowl before I'm ready, I really can never have a bad meal here.As much as I talk about pickles (I'm not kidding - I love them), I've had really great experiences with servers and all of the other actual menu items. Whenever you're around this area and looking for a well-priced meal and look at the slower life - come here!"
"If I were ever put on death row and had to choose my last meal, this place would seriously be a top contender. My boyfriend and I nabbed a reservation for restaurant week on a Friday night, so we were thrilled. The place is right down the street from my apartment and completely unassuming to someone who walks by 5-10x a day. You would never guess that this is a BBQ joint from the outside. Let me start out by saying that we had our reservation locked in on a Friday - the first Friday of Lent, nonetheless  - growing up Catholic and not eating meat typically on those Fridays...I will happily accept my warm little spot in hell for eating here. Highlights of the meal included: EXTENSIVE bourbon menu, the housemade chips and bread and butter pickles, the BBQ shrimp and lemon infused grits (could've seriously eaten those all night), the kobe brisket and the [oh em gee so good] carrot cake.I left this meal extremely full and extremely drunk, which is an automatic A in my book. Our next venture is to check this place out for brunch - cheddar and chive biscuits and gravy?! Yes, please!!"
My fiance and I got a q2 and it was really tasty! The server and bus boys were really friendly. This place is a bit pricey though...
second time eating there and i can't say enough about the food and the staff here. wonderful place. make sure if you wan the beef ribs you call in advance to order them as their supply is limited.
"Nice place, solid BBQ in the center"
"Yummy, yummy in my tummy! This place was so good! Not to mention they have the most delicious, crisp Sauvignon Blanc I have tasted to date. I love my white wine!I felt like I was in cape cod while sitting in the dining room, it doesnt really resemble a BBQ joint, but no complaints here I liked the decor. For the food, we started off with the hush puppies, obviously, and they were so stinkin good. I usually dont like hush puppies, but then again, I've never had them with Jalapenos and Cheddar and that delicious dipping sauce. I ate 2.5 of those puppies! Seriously good. For my main, I had the Smoked Salmon and beet salad. The salad was soo fresh tasting. They diced it up for you, so that was nice, and the beets were sliced very thinly. They had the nerve to ask if the maple dressing would be ok, are you kidding, of course it will be! I also tried, the pulled brisket and that was seriously out of this world...especially with that spicy BBQ dipping sauce. The pulled pork just might have pulled ahead of the brisket as it was just cooked so perfectly! It pretty much melted in my mouth. And, we obvi, couldnt pass up the Mac 'n Cheese, I just polished it off as my lunch and it was just as cheesy, crunchy and delicious as it was last night! How could I forget about the pickles until the end of my review!? Those pickles! I had them box them up for me, I dont care how cheap it looked, I couldnt stop eating them and I knew I would want more today! Good thinking on my part! If you havent been, definitely go! I'm not the biggest fan of BBQ, but this place definitely impressed. The service was top notch as well. The patio would be fun in the summer as well!"
"Just dined at Chicago q again and had another amazing meal.  I had their appetizer sampler of chicken, pork and beef with 3 slices of cornbread and left a very happy woman."
"Um, yes, please!! This place is so delicious, from the homemade bread and butter pickles and ""pig-spice"" chips they start you off with, to the appetizers and cocktails... just fantastic. And the place is gorgeous, not the ambiance you would expect from a barbecue place.We got the bacon cheddar hush puppies to start because it seemed truly un-American not to. God Bless patriotism. They were fluffy and light with a great dipping sauce.I had the barbecue flight appetizer as a main, which was plenty of food for me, though I imagine a guy would probably want something heartier. The brisket was my fave on the flight. Comes with cornbread, which was awesome. My friend had the pulled pork sandwich, which she loved.The sazerac is delicious, if you're into whisky cocktails... which you should be if you're eating barbecue, they go quite well together.The service was totally outstanding, and I'm not just saying that because our server was hot (full disclosure: he was). Every person that worked at that place was cordial and friendly, and we had an awesome time. I saw some party rooms upstairs, I would def check this place out again with a big group."
"First timer and it was delicious!! I got the pulled chicken and my husband got the ribs. Definitely isn't cheap BBQ but a fun date night! Service was great, and very fast for a busy week night. Would definitely go back! Make a reservation."
"We moved away from Chicago nine months ago, and our first stop in town was to Chicago Q.  From the service, to the bourbon selection, the pulled pork, brisket, and the pickles and homemade BBQ chips, this place will always put a smile on my face."
"It can be very loud here but the pickles and chips while you are waiting for your food makes up for it.  Feels like being in a country club restaurant but moderate priced BBQ, what a great idea.  They have great bloody mary's and cornbread."
"WOW! I'm from Kentucky & this place blew my mind! Husband & I came for a date night & we will be back :) the St. Louis ribs and brisket were out of this world! The sauces were so different and amazing, too. We keep shaking our heads bc it was so good! Highly recommend. Best restaurant we've been to since we moved here last June!"
"We went to q for a weekday lunch and so their were maybe 4 tables being served.  They sat us in the back which is far less 'cute' than the front of this converted mansion.The food was good - no complaints.   I had the pulled chicken sandwich. Although there was really no way to eat it as a sandwich.   I did love that it came with 4 different sauces and the enormous pile of coleslaw was tasty.  However, it certainly wasn't the most amazing BBQ meal I've ever had."
"I had a hard time decediding on the rating.  It is SUCH a beautiful place...I walked around loving the decor and feeling there.Yet...  I was there with a group.  We got one of the semi-circle booths and it was so loud next to the open kitchen and with the dining room noise we literally could not hear each other.  So, that was disappointing.Then, the food.  LOVED the appetizers.  So, based on that I almost gave it a four star.  We got the hushpuppies - a must!  Fried green tomatoes - great!  I ordered the competition ribs wanting to experience their ""best"" ribs.  I have to say, maybe it was just an off day, but they were the worst ribs I have had.  I LOVE ribs and my local Bartlett ""Papa Pacino's"" has this fancy goumet restuarant beat by a long shot.  No comparison.  So, I guess because Chicago Q is supposed to be ""THE"" place for good ribs I had my taste buds so anticipating that.  Hugely disappointed!  With all the choice places to dine in the city I was bummed that we went there.  They were dry.  I also did not find any of the four sauces to be very good.  Either too spicy, too tangy, too strange, or just plain bad.  (AND I am NOT someone who is so hard on places!!  I just really did not like this!)My friends also did not enjoy their meal.  The server was not friendly, I actually wondered if she was new and nervous because she did have to ask others the answers a few times.  With all the reviews and I had watched the ""Check Please"" episode I was shocked to not have had a 5 star experience!"
"Good, solid food, but I didn't find it remarkable compared to other BBQ joints in the city.  The atmosphere elevated the experience to more of an upscale BBQ feel. So, good place to bring out of town guests who love BBQ, I guess?"
Delicious bbq. BBQ pulled pork mini sandwiches were great.
Brisket was out of this world and the service was great! Upscale yet traditional bbq joint that doesn't skimp on the portions.
"My boyfriend and I came here for a late lunch/early dinner on Tuesday. He ordered the wings and the seasonal veg which was asparagus and shitake mushrooms. I had the Kobe beef sandwich and the watermelon salad. Everything was delicious - the beef was super tender and the watermelon was sweet. The wings were a little stickier than expected considering the smoked dry rub advertised, but the flavor was great.Two minor gripes - the service was really attentive at the beginning but towards the end of the meal, our server disappeared. Perhaps our weird timing meant a shift change, but it took a while to get our check. The second gripe is the sauce cups - while I appreciate the idea of providing different sauces, I wish they were provided in bottles, to lessen the amount of waste. I tried them all and liked the spicy one best, but that meant the others just got tossed.Overall, though, one of the best meals we had in 4 days in Chicago."
"Made my 5th or so visit to Chicago q this weekend. Split brisket and baby ribs with brother. Ribs better than brisket imho. Get the flight to start.Beware of the monster portions of corn bread. No seriously, they're huge."
"Went with co-workers. Valet parking and the inside has a plantation feel to it. They start you with complimentary homemade bread/butter pickles and BBQ chips. Service was great. Now the food. Our group was not crazy about the Mac and cheese side but cornbread, beans, spicy hush puppies, ribs, brisket, and BBQ shredded pork was so very good. When in Chicago definitely try this place. It will not disappoint."
"TL;DR version: Mediocre lukewarm BBQ that can't decide if it's going full-on hipster with the longboard skateboard or if it's going to stay close to traditional BBQ roots and not own a skateboard at all. Lousy sauce, great service staff.The full monty:Our server was fantastic; she reminded me very much of the best server I've ever known in terms of personality and attention to detail.Unfortunately, service alone can't always carry a meal - and at q, it certainly did not.* The hush puppies were the star of the experience, but even though they were fabulous, they showed up warm. They need to show up really, really hot to be truly excellent. The comp chips and pickles are fine; the chips taste much like store-bought BBQ chips from Lays.* The ""brulee"" mac and cheese isn't anything special. A few different cheeses with large spiral noodles and some crumbled bacon on top. Slid into the salamander for a few minutes, or maybe actually fired with a torch, it still came to the table luke-warm and underwhelming.* Kobe brisket sandwich was decent, but it came on a plain, cheap bun instead of the nice pretzel bun my two dining compatriots received with their pulled pork. If you're going to hipsterize barbecue, go all the way and use an artisan roll. Otherwise, stick to BBQ roots and serve it open-face on Texas toast (and not artisan texas toast with truffle butter. Wonder Bread only)* Cole slaw was good, but it needed to be run through the salad shooter one last time. There were some serious pieces of cabbage that needed to be trimmed down quite a bit in order to eat, and as those who know me well will affirm: I have a really big mouth. (and that's not innuendo, either.)* The sauces were mediocre. I really liked the mustard sauce and their ""spicy"" sauce even though it wasn't spicy. The ""regular"" sauce was boring, and the vinegar sauce was probably good but I got tired of trying to spoon it out of the ramekin without splashing it all over. Again, either glitz it up and put it in some fancy dispenser or bring me a squeeze bottle of the stuff.* The jalapeno cornbread was not spicy, and as noted later by my out-of-town visitor, ""the butter should not have remained solid on top the entire time it sat there"". He's right; it was lukewarm. Cornbread quickly starts to taste like ass as it cools even though it's the iPhone of bread product. If my butter isn't melting on it and getting soaked up, it's not worth eating.If I went back, and I would, I would opt for a piece of meat on a plate and a few ramekins of mustard sauce. Nothing more, nothing less."
"Top 5 reasons to get a bloody at q:5) price - $6 per is a steal, especially considering reasons 1-4 below4) they will mix their spicy BBQ sauce (on request) to the standard bloody mix3) they rim the glass with their pork shoulder dry rub, which is a little sweet/a little spicy2) they use smoked olives1) they give you a bacon twirl that surrounds your straw...when availableThe food is great too (try the smoked dry-rub wings) but the bloodys alone make q a destination visit."
"This is the best barbecue I've had in the city, maybe anywhere.  I love their sauce so much it's ruined all other barbecue sauces for me.  Their pulled pork and ribs are incredible.I gave 4 stars only because I don't love the mac and cheese and the corn bread has always been dry for me, although I know other people who love it.  It's also a tad pricey for what you get.  It's definitely not priced for a weeknight BBQ spot."
"The inside was very comfortable and classy.  The service was GREAT, from the hostess to the waitress to the bus guys.  Everyone was friendly and professional.  The food was wonderful.  We shared alot.  They bring out pickles and chips when you sit down.  They were very tasty!  We ordered the fried green tomatoes and hushpuppies for appetizers.  The fried green tomatoes were perfect...not too much bread crumbs and the tomatoes were thick and juicy.  The hushpuppies were moist and very flavorful.The pulled pork was REALLY GREAT, moist and delicious!!! The coleslaw was perfect too.  The ribs were very moist and loved the bbq sauces!  Our sides were wonderful....mashed potatoes and mac and cheese!!Driniks were great too!!  Would recommend to small and large parties."
"My favorite new place in Chicago. Excellent service, fall off the bone ribs, perfectly prepared brisket, and the list goes on. It's unlike any BBQ joint I've ever been to. It's easy to miss if you don't know what your looking for because it looks like a house with a small ""q"" on the front. When you get inside, it's pretty large though. There is a downstairs and upstairs and it's very trendy.I'll definitely be making a few trips back in June."
"not worth the money...every side is extra , and ribs mediocre and small portions...waiter seemed a bit unsure of things and dessert of cookies tasted storebought and not fresh  (first bad review- im pretty reasonable)"
"I went back to Q last week and could not be more impressed! Everything was excellent, even the crow I have to eat after my last review. Great job Q team and Lee."
"I saw the chef on Throwdown at some point, and when I randomly looked at Chicago Q's website and recognized her, I knew this was a place to try.Made reservations on a Saturday night @ 9pm (highly recommend it, the wait for walk-ins, even at that time, was 1 hour) and as soon as we walked in, we were greated with a powerful smell of BBQ.  I don't recall experiencing this kind of aroma from the food when first entering.We were seated promptly.  Like everybody else, I LOVED the homemade bread & butter pickles (there were also onions and garlic in the bowl).  I had to restrain myself from having another bowl.  The homemade chips - WOW!!! - loved them too.  But luckily I saved some room for an entree.We shared the kobe beef ribs.  This dish is 3 large, meat falling off the bone ribs, with 2 sides.  We substituted the mashed potatoes for cole slaw, which proved to be wise, as the slaw is a not-miss at this restaurant.  We shared a side of honey cornbread, and basically licked our plates clean.  The 4 bbq sauces that came along gave us a perfect variety to mix & match our tastes.  We loved all of them.We got to go into the kitchen to see the smokers and get a glimpse of how things go behind the scenes.The atmosphere and decor is small-town, southern, farm-y.  The upstairs hosts a private room and a few couches in front of a tv and fireplace, in case you want to eat like you are at home (isn't that how everybody eats dinner these days?).Loved Chicago Q, recommend it to all, just make reservations so you don't have to wait."
"This place has the best BBQ that I've ever had in my life! One of the challenges with BBQ is that people have different tastes as far as what they like in a sauce.  Some people prefer not to even have a sauce and prefer that the meat have a nice and flavorful rub instead.  No matter what people's preference as far a sauce or no sauce, all BBQ fans love a nice tender piece of meat.  You know that a place knows what they are doing when they manage to not only provide you with good flavor but give you nice tender, juicy, fall off the bone meat.  This place has it all.  I had a half slab of the St. Louis ribs.  I was torn between trying those or the award winning ribs.  I decided to try the St. Louis because I figured if the baseline ribs are good, the award winners must be great! Well, the St. Louis ribs made me question my miserable shadow of a rib-eating life.  I thought I had tasted the best ribs somewhere out there but this place made me forget the name of the ribs at uhm...I forgot the name.  Aside from the meat being tender and having a nice flavor rub, the ribs are served with about 4 different sauces to satisfy the pallet of even the most discriminating sauce aficionado.  You've got sweet spicy BBQ, honey mustard, vinegar something or the other, and one other sauce that was really good too.  I tried them all and they were all great.  And the portions are a nice size.The sides were really good too.  With items like sweet sliced pickles and garlic gloves, potato chips made in-house and sprinkled with a sweet fairy dust they call ""pig-powder"", bacon cheddar hush puppies (served with a special dipping sauce that's also pretty awesome), mac 'n' cheese, this place does not disappoint on providing items to choose from that satisfy your BBQ craving as they add their signature twists that provide bold, rich flavor combinations to old classics.  From the ambiance to the drink selection, I would describe this place as ""Grown Wo/Man's BBQ"".  Not only do they have a full bar and a variety of cocktails and spirits but they have a F-ing bourbon flight! Yeah, you heard me! If they had cigars I think this would be the place where I would want to have my heart attack and die.  And lastly, the service is good.  The servers are very patient and informative in helping you to make these major life decisions like what to order.If you are a carnivore of any level and are looking for some grilled smokey goodness, do not come to Chicago without stopping here for some unforgettable Q!"
"This is how food should be: exciting, delicious, high-quality, yet low-key. I love that the restaurant manages the perfect ambience that's great for a group outing or a low-key date night.  Their drinks are great, though I wasn't feeling well and unfortunately couldn't finish my mint julep.  I'm not even going to talk about the ribs because I don't think the vivid, sensational imagery would be appropriate for the public. BUT I am going to add two words about their beans: GET THEM.  They're sweet, spicy, a hint of sour, and all kinds of party in my mouth.  They are AMAZING with the macaroni and cheese (which you should get with the bacon because... well.. how else do you eat mac and cheese?).  And with the ribs, obviously.  My only complaint is that I've never ended up having room for dessert.  Though they do have a ""milk and cookies"" on their dessert menu.  And one of the cookies is ""oatmeal and bacon."""
"I don't know why everyone loves it so much. Maybe it's the atmosphere... I tasted their pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket and I must say that it's nothing that I couldn't make in my oven or a crock pot. Even though whole q seems to be sprayed  with a smokey febreze (that's how I imagined it at least :p LOL) inside, you won't taste any real smoke in the meat. I must say that I was very disappointed with the food I was served, not because it wasn't cooked well, but because it promised to be bbq and it didn't deliver. If you want to taste how the real bbq should taste like visit Smoque BBQ (I absolutely love this place even though I'm not the fan of the atmosphere). If you want to get together in a ""goldcoast atmosphere"" (how Jenny H. said), then q is a good choice.Tasting their meat I came to realization that if the restaurant offers you four different sauces to cover up the taste of meat, it should tell you right away that it's not a real bbq. Anyway, I gave to stars for pickles."
"My hubby and I went to here for our anniversary since we were in the area for others things and I really wanted BBQ. Let me first say, that we both felt a cold reception from the hostess. I was a bit apprehensive, but we were here so we went in.  Once seated, the wait staff were amazing. Our server was out of this world amazingly helpful and made us feel right at home. Her suggestions were spot on.Now onto the food. We both tried different things so that we could get a full taste of what they have. They start you off with chips and some pickles on the table. We then started off w/ the bacon hush puppies, yum!  They come w/ a chipotle mayo that was awesome w/ them. I had the pulled pork/chicken with a side of coleslaw. At first I felt the coleslaw was a bit under-dressed but it worked very well w/ all the was on the plate. The pulled pork was AHMAZING!!!! very tender and flavorful. The chicken was so juicy and tender, that right there is worth ordering it alone. My hubby ordered the kobe chopped brisket w/ poblano cheddar cornbread. The sandwich was great, just what brisket should be. Now the HUGE piece of cornbread was the best I have ever had. (sorry to my hubby who makes some killer cornbread) They also have a honey cornbread option that I would love to try! You are served 4 different kinds of sauce w/ your food. a mild, a spicy, a North Carolina Vinegar, and a South Carolina mustard sauce. I was impressed by them all but I did not care for the spicy one. My hubby on the other hand enjoyed it.They have catering, weekend brunch, and a buffet option (for special days like Father's Day) They do have a great dessert menu however we did not try anthing this time since we were full!"
"My wife, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law went here for dinner on my birthday and came away very impressed.  We were sat upstairs which was nice since it kind of gave us a little privacy.On the table they had some homemade potato chips and I believe some pickles which was a good start to the meal.  We ordered a meat sampler as an appetizer where they gave us a sampling of pulled pork, beef brisket, and pulled chicken I believe.  It was nice because we were all unsure as to what to get so this gave us a little taste to what we could order for our meal.  I ended up going with a platter of ribs and brisket and was not disappointed.  The meat was amazing!  I also got jalapeno cornbread with the meal and they don't cheat you on the portions.  They give you the biggest piece of cornbread and serving of coleslaw.It was a great meal with great service.  Will definitely come back!"
"Originally from Kansas City, so I have high expectations for BBQ. Great BBQ for me is sliced brisket that has a deep pink color into the meat as a result of the smoking process, or textured pulled pork that isn't a ball of mush. Along with that -  great BBQ meat will be flavored by the rub and the wood that has smoked the meat, and there isn't any need for much BBQ sauce. The sauce is a condiment, you like to taste it, but like a great hamburger you don't want the mustard or ketchup to over power the meat.That being said, the meat that I had included, baby back ribs, sliced brisket, and the pulled pork, and is the reason for the 2 stars. As for the BBQ sauce, I like the spicy and the South Carolina were both good (3 stars). I did really enjoy the house made pickles, jalapeno hush puppies with a spicy sauce (3 stars), the bourbon cocktails were a nice addition to the BBQ menu, as well. The atmosphere is very much ""gold coast"", fun and loud, but comfortable for a Friday/Saturday night. Casual dress for men but the ladies will want to look cute/sexy/flirty. If you want truly tasty BBQ in Chicago then go to Smoke Daddy or Smoque."
"I tried again as the family likes the place and maybe I just have an aversion to BBQ, but I liked my meal less than the first time. Went Ribs this time hoping that their competition style would bring me back in line with the rest of you. In the end, they too let me down. The service was still top notch and for that I cannot complain."
Great service - they anticipated my every need. The food came out so fast! My sushi grade ahi tuna steak was seared and seasoned perfectly. The accompanying veggies were delicious. It's a warm environment and was jam packed on a Wednesday night. I loved my experience and I will come back again!
"I love BBQ but I'm not one who would declare there is one definition of what barbecue is and that all nonconformists are not worthy of the name.  I enjoyed my meal of 'Kobe' brisket and sampled my son's ribs. Both were smoky and tasty but clearly not made in a conventional BBQ technique. My quess is simmering or braising followed by a quick visit to a smoker.  I liked it but have to say it's not my favorite style. All in all Q provided an enjoyable meal, and a very weird cocktail (inside job).  Looking around I had the impression people were having a great time, and it sure was busy. But in the end it isn't a place that would draw me back."
"Came here for Easter brunch with the family.Service was prompt and friendly.Decor inside was lovely -- love the staircase and multiple floors and wait staff in their urban chic/ country casual flannel shirts.Food was delicious - great BBQ, yummy bread and butter pickles and chips.We also order the hush puppies to pound in the calories -- but it was worth it. I had the brisket sandwich -- the portions were plenty and the sauces were wonderful.  For the value of a nice Sunday brunch -- terrific!They also had a cute easter bunny and egg hunting for the kids upstairs.I would definitely come back again!  All round, great experience."
"2nd visit was disappointing.  Cole slaw not as good/creamy as I remembered.   I had a ""flight"" of appetizers as my entree -- chicken, pulled pork and brisket.   Chicken was WAY too dry.   Pork a little too dry.   Brisket too much fat.   Large portion and perfect for dinner.   My friend enjoyed her 1/2 slab of BBQ ribs.   Sauces were good.   Last time I thought they brought a flight of 5-sauces.   Last night only 4.   For dessert, my friend had the sweet potato poundcake with candied walnuts and vanilla ice cream (very good).   Q treated me to 3 cookies & milk for my b-day.   1 out of 3 cookies was great -- the double-chocolate chip.   Others were just ""eh"".   Prior experience I thought the food was much better.  Service was still good and the room is very nice.   Just didn't feel like the food was up to par."
"We loved Chicago q!  Everything was perfect---drinks, service, meal...everything.I made a reservation for 6:00 on a Saturday. It was early enough that the restaurant was still rather calm and quiet. Our server was very knowledgable on the menu.  We started with the hush puppies and I had the brisket and hubby had the ribs.   I think this was my first time eating a rib EVER, and I loved it. The brisket was delicious and tender and I loved experimenting with all the sauces.  The way to my heart is through free little starters...and q's pickles and chips were perfect. We will definitely be back."
"Not even average. No idea how this place has been rated so highly, I guess a lot of those people have not had the pleasure of great barbecue. Started with the BBQ flight: brisket did not have a smoke ring, texture was good, but flavor was not there. Pulled chicken obviously needs a good sauce and with 4 sauces I figured I would be fine. WOW was I wrong... The sauces were awful...terrible. The worst BBQ sauces I have ever had the displeasure of tasting. The pulled pork was decent, but the lack of a good sauce was once again an issue. Hush puppies were ok. Place is way overrated. If it ever was good, it's gone downhill. Don't waste your time or money."
"Seeing as most BBQ is from the Southern area of the US, I wasn't sure where to find good BBQ in Chicago. Searching on Yelp brought Chicago Q up, and boy am I glad it did.I love how instead of bread and butter you're started off with some excellent chips and bread & butter pickles that are excellent. I then decided to have an Orange Blossom martini which was outstanding. I ordered the half slab of the St Louis ribs (more meat & fat than Baby Back) and it was outstanding. The ribs are served dry rub with a selection of sauces on the side. I like almost all of them. The original was sweet & tangy, the mustard was my fave with a nice kick to it, and the spicy was much like the original with some heat to it. The vinegar based one was just a little too runny for my taste. I also had a side of the mac & cheese which let me down. I can tell they were using cheddar which unfortunately doesn't melt too well and as it cools forms a mealy type texture.Still, the service was great, the price is nice, the decor is classy & relaxed, and it's just a great place to go. Looking forward to many more meals here."
"Simple, tasteful decor.Excellent, unpretentious service.Insanely delicious, comforting food and drinks. If you leave here without ordering the salted caramel/chocolate mousse/pretzel pie, I'm sorry for your loss.Yeah, I'd live here if they'd let me."
"Such good BBQ and a fun, lively homey environment!"
"My 2 coworkers and I found this place on Yelp while visiting Chicago on business. We did make a reservation which was available upwind arrival. All 3 of us thought the food was yummy. Unless you're really hungry, you may want to skip the a la carte items. We ordered too much, but all of it was delicious. Cool bar area."
"This place has delicious food without playing into the ""country"" stereotype. I went on a Tuesday night and their clientele mostly seemed to be business professionals. The restaurant is very elegant inside, but definitely reasonably priced. They give large portions and instead of bread they provide homemade chips and pickles. I ordered the bean salad and my date ordered the Q2.  He picked the ribs and the brisket.  He thoroughly enjoyed both. With the ribs, they provided 4 different types of BBQ sauce. The cornbread was a very large piece.  It could have been a bit fluffy and I wish more butter was on top. The staff is attentive, helpful, and friendly.  At the end of the night, we were given hot towelettes. The valet cost $11.99."
"Usually I'm a sour cream and cheddar gal, but the freebie BBQ chips that came before the meal had me sold on Chicago q with the first bite... I went with the smoked half chicken, and it was no spring chicken.  This was the mother hen of all chicken, as in, the portion was huge.   I barely ate a fourth of the entree.  The taste was as described: smoky.  The chicken came with some nice dipping sauces which were quickly described for us.   As a side I had house cut fries which were also very good.  My partner in crime had the ribs and corn bread- the ribs were devoured and the corn bread was nibbled: it was a little on the dry side.I also had a ginger fizz, which for the $11 price tag was a steal.  It was quite literally intoxicating.  Another nice touch was dark linen napkins for the ladies at our table.  We were both wearing dark dresses, and the napkins helped minimize lint on our going out wear.  Overall, a good dinner, and I'll be certain to be back for some of those ribs this winter."
"so freaking good,  4.5 starswe also had the best waitress ever, super attentive, great recs, and overall awesome.pickles and homemade chips were great to start with. hush puppies were to die for, amazing chipotle dipping sauce. great pulled pork, and i loved the smoked bacon sausage. sides were also great - mac and cheese, and cornbread.finished off with a bourbon, they add a few drops of water to open it up. that was pretty cool. then pecan pie. it was really good, except the crust was impossible to cut! overall amazing meal! loved the service, food and atmosphere"
"We tried a little of everything, and it was all delicious. The bbq chips were irresistable. We shared hushpuppies and fried green tomato appetizers, delish. My baby backs and sweet cornbread were both about the best I've ever had. The ribs were surprisingly big & meaty and fall off the bone tender. The service was attentive but not overbearing and the 9 year old in our party was welcome and well served."
"I loved the prix fixe lunch option, for $15 you got three courses. For the first course you could pick the bacon cheddar hush puppies, or one of two salads. For the second course you could pick either a BBQ pulled pork, pulled chicken, or brisket sandwich, with a side of either fries or cornbread. For the third course you could choose from vanilla bean ice cream, cinnamon ice cream, or two cookies. Having an appetizer, entree (with side), and dessert for $15 is a great deal. For those that were wondering, the sandwich seemed to be full sized, the ice cream came with two scoops, and there were three hush puppies; you will be full.They give you homemade pickles and BBQ chips to munch on between courses; the chips were amazing.They give you new silverware between each course; probably standard for a prix fixe meal, however, I've never had a prix fixe meal before.The service was great; they refilled our waters constantly before they could even get a fourth empty.The only downside for me is that the pop came in eight ounce glass bottles and were $3. Personally I hate when restaurants don't have fountain pop because if I pay for a pop, I want to be able to drink as I want without having to rack up a huge bill (for the record, I didn't ask how much a second pop would be, once I realized the pop came in bottles, I didn't get another one because I've never been to a place that didn't charge a lot per bottle).I felt quite under dressed in a t-shirt and jeans because the building's finishings were so fancy and the service so attentive. The place was pretty empty inside (as everyone was sitting outside on the patio), therefore, I didn't get a good feel for what the average customer wore. Next time (there will be a next time), I'm going to dress up a bit more."
"Ordered food for take-out, we got:- Full slab of baby back ribs- Pulled pork sandwich- Side of mac- Side of cornbreadPortion sizes were good, ribs just fell off the bone. My favorite sauces were the original and the mustard based ones. The mac was good, but nothing special, and the wife was in love with the cornbread. All in all, excellent especially given that it was take out."
"The food was absolutely delicious, but I cannot recommend Q. After waiting well over an hour for a table, we were seated in the bar area. At most restaurants this wouldn't be a problem.But at Q, management is aloof. What seemed to be a frat party enjoyed dinner with us. Not only could we barely hear each other, but the party of ""gentleman"", waiting for their table, literally bumped into us, twice, while we attempted to enjoy our food. Now you're thinking, maybe no staff noticed. In fact, the servers had to hold their trays well over their heads while pushing their way through this group of mouth breathers. No one did a thing. In sum, if you're looking for some delicious food in a Jersey Shore atmosphere, Q should be at the top of your list. If, on the other hand, you would like to enjoy a laid-back time with friends or colleagues, look elsewhere."
"Nice place, a bit loud for my taste but they can't be blamed for being well known and crowded. Dining here was a great experience because of the fact that you get 4 different complimentary BBQ sauces to try, although the ribs are actually succulent and flavorful without sauce. You also get complimentary BBQ flavored chips and the best bread and butter pickles I've ever had, so if you are by yourself, or are trying to save money, or just in single-minded pursuit of MEAT, you can still have some variety in your meal. Although the ribs were absolutely fabulous, the sides were disappointing. The bacon cheddar hush puppies were on the dense side, and not very bacon-cheddary; the chipotle mayo dipping sauce was great though. The fried green tomatoes were well fried but ultimately disappointing -- good thing the excellent bbq sauces make anything go down easy.Service was great, and when our server noticed that we particularly enjoyed the pickles, he offered us more to take home."
"Really liked Chicago Q. The atmosphere was great, the food was awesome and the portions were huge."
"Southern food finally done proper!!  Being from the south I've found that nobody in the midwest can quite do southern food proper (no offense, the south did create the food).  The key, your meat must be cooked perfectly without any sauce, then the sauce will spruce it up that much more.  The sauce is a staple, but should be a bonus to the meat.  Lets be honest, badly cooked meat is just that, badly cooked meat.I shared the bbq flight - pulled chicken and pork and kobe brisket accompanied by cornbread.  The flight was perfectly executed and it was a close race for the best, but I'd say I liked the brisket best followed by the chicken, then pork.  With this you got 4 types of sauce - original mild, spicy, carolina vinegar and a mustard style.  My favorites were the spicy and mustard - literally finger slurpin' good.  We also had the fried green tomatoes which were served with an herbed greek style type of yogurt sauce that was tasty, but didn't over power the goodness of the tomatoes.  For dinner we split the baby back ribs that slid off the bone - meat cooked to perfection!!I also enjoyed the Orange Blossom Martini - Templeton Rye Whiskey, Lemon Juice, Cinnamon-Infused Simple Syrup, Splash of OJ - Why yes please to another now!Thank you Chicago Q - I'll be back for some more southern done proper."
can't say enough about the dry-rubbed chicken wings!Lee the GM was extremely helpful selecting several different Bourbons and one of their own!Just found out their culinary happy hour (3-6 M-F) features:Smoke Dry-Rubbed WingsHouse Bacon Cheddar Hush PuppiesFriend Green Tomatoesall for under $4!!!!!
"Second time dining here, still on point. Love the chips, delicious pork chop and they were very accommodating for a 6 top at 10pm. Will be back."
"GREAT barbecue!  I love the fact that they give you 4 different bbq style sauces, it gives you automatic variety to your meal.  The portion sizes are huge! Those hush puppies are TO.DIE.FOR.  Make sure you order them. It's also good to find good Sweet Tea at a restaurant up North, so kudos to Chicago Q.  I highly recommend it."
"I could talk about the sweet potato chips and bread and butter pickles they give you complimentary. But you've read the reviews so you know how great they are. I could also talk about the cheddar bacon hush puppies. But again everyone talks about those so you know they are crispy and tasty.What I will recommend over and over again is the ""competition style"" baby back ribs. It would be easy to look at the price and say ""40$ for ribs?"". The answer is that they are well worth it (I do recommend splitting them with someone though cause it's a meaty rack). The time that went into the preparation and cooling of these ribs comes through in every bite. As each bite falls off the bone you can clearly see the pink smoke ring that permeates the meat and says 10+ hours of smoke. You can choose from any d the 4 tasty sauces to accompany your ribs. But I likes them dry. The dry rub is fantastic and can stand on it's own. The only other place you can ribs like this is at competition with money at stake. Since I'm writing this review only briefly after my meal it is time for me to embrace my food coma and take a nap. I'll probably dream about the ribs."
"The reviews changed my mind about the place.  I was skeptical about high end BBQ.  I was a fan of the Chef/Owner since she is from Va and took down Bobby Flay. However,  I should have stuck to my first mind.  I have the competition Ribs. They were if even possible over cooked, a bit dry and the rub was not that eventful.  The BBQ Beans were decent.  However,  the drinks were strong and the Burbon selection plentiful.Others at the talbe seem to enloy the pulled meats. The fries were good and I am not a Brisket person but the Brisket was very good. Sliced Brisket. Service was poor and the waitress not only forgot us for some time but over charged and did not have a pleasant attitude.  There are other  BBQ places that are way better. Skip this one uless you come for Burbon or Dessert."
"While hardcore BBQ fans may take issue with the fine-dining approach to what is usually a picnic table experience, casual diners will be awed by Q's different take on the cuisine. The menu features all the classic BBQ staples with upscale ""twists"" - the baked beans are served with kobe beef brisket and the mac and cheese is done ""brûlée style"".  And warm towels and lemon replace the post-meal ""wet-nap"". Nice.I ordered the St. Louis rack and tried all four excellent sauces; I enjoyed the mustard most of all -- it just seemed to mesh with the smokey dry rub. The ""smoke"" seems to pervade every dish (even the tomatoes in the house salad). The room is exceptionally well-designed and management has taken the concept of a barbecue joint in a fresh direction. The decor felt like a brasserie. Some of other reviews pointed out the spotty service and I agree this was the one weakness. It took a long time to get our entrees, even though the restaurant was nearly empty. Service aside, I'd call Q a must-try for food fans."
"This place is more about the ambiance and side dishes than BBQ.  The BBQ is sub-par, but all the other side dishes and food are great.  Trust me, there's better BBQ in Chicago.  I almost worked there as a chef, but I just wish the chefs focused more on BBQ-ing and leave all the side jobs to the prep cooks.  I could go on about what I didn't like about how they BBQ, but I'll spare you the time.  Go there if you're looking for a pleasant evening, good drinks, or a nice date spot, but don't expect good BBQ."
"DATE/SEATING TIME: Went last night, Saturday (3/10/2012) without reservations.  The place was packed, but they still got us a seat at a table near the bar after about a 40 minute wait.  It was about 7:15pm when we showed up and around 8pm when we were seated.FOOD: The served a bowl of some delicious chips and a bowl of sweet pickles.  Both were very good, especially on an empty stomach.  I think the chips were BBQ and the sweet pickles reminded me of the ones my grandmother used to make.We ordered the hush puppies for an appetizer.  They were good, not great.  The chipotle mayo they come with had a little kick that added some flavor, but overall I would not order the hush puppies again.For dinner I ordered the Kobe Beef Brisket and my wife ordered 1/2 pulled chicken and 1/2 pulled pork.  All 3 meats were very good.  Although I generally do not like vinegar, the pork with the NC BBQ was really good!  The brisket and chicken with well with their mild BBQ (big fan of the BBQ sauce!).On the side we each had the huge cake slice serving of Corn Bread.  Moist and very good.  Highly recommended.  We also shared the Mac & Cheese, which is really really tasty.  It was the perfect balance of noodle and cheese, so they blended perfectly.With all of the food we ordered, we had what felt like a 10 lbs. to go bag at the end of the meal.  I'm pretty sure we have lunch and part of dinner covered for today with these leftovers.PRICE: The price was really reasonable.  $80 with tax and tip (and a bottle of BBQ sauce to go).  Once of the best values I've had in Chicago.  I highly recommend Chicago Q!"
We've eaten BBQ all over and make our own. Everything from smoked ribs to cured pork belly. When we travel we carefully select where we'll eat in advance. Our first night in Chicago in February had us wanting to go a restaurant close to our hotel. Chicago q was one block down so we scrapped our plans and ate there. What? It's Chicago Restaurtant Week? Score!I ordered the St. Louis ribs with cole slaw and braised greens. Hubby ordered pulled pork with cole slaw. We started with the hush puppies. We knew we could throw caution to the wind as far as amount of food was concerned since we were in the Windy City to visit our college student and knew no left overs would go wasted. There were left overs for sure. Those ribs fell off the bone. We loved the choice of 4 BBQ sauces that come with dinner. The thing that made our head spin around was the braised greens. I think it may have been a race to see who could eat the most. On our last night we planned to take our kid to a yummy dinner at a place we ate at on our last trip a few months before but they wouldn't let us in cause she's under age at 19. We were on the late side and they don't let minors in after 9:30. Bummer but really their loss in the end. Because of this we ended up back at Chicago q. She didn't complain since she and a friend profited from the left overs last time. What we ordered is inconsequentional to what I'm about to say. Order the BRAISED GREENS. Did you get that? They are so good you can't stop yourself. I'm trying to recreate them this weekend. I will work on them until they are perfected. Because we ordered off the Restaurant Week menu we got homemade cookies. One of them was a bacon oatmeal cookie. I'm making those right now. I'll post the recipe. thedinnerplan.blogspot.c…. I can't wait until our next trip to ChiTown. You should eat at Chicago q next time you can.
"Yes, the barbeque here is fantastic.  And the mac n cheese?  Dreamy.  Read all the other reviews for more on that.  I wanted to write about the decor.  Whoever designed this place blew me out of the water.   The wait staff are outfitted in plaid shirts, but crisp and tucked into clean khakis.  That sums this place up.  It is the perfect combination of preppy cape cod, southern bbq, and gold coast dining.  The white beadboard-esque walls, wrought iron fixtures and hardwood floors, combined with the towering staircase leading up the GORGEOUS second floor... wow.  And the use of mirrors makes the room seem light and even larger than it is.  The patio space is small but lovely and comfortable.  Our group of seven was seated in a huge, clean booth.  The large opening dining room was happily noisy, as a good BBQ joint should be.  If I was hosting a rehearsal dinner in the city, I'd rent a private space here in a heartbeat.The aesthetic of this place and attention to detail are really stunning and refreshing, and just my style.  I'll go again for the decor and ambience alone, not to mention the life-changing BBQ."
"Don't believe the hype. Chicago q was recommended to me by a friend, that and all the positive yelp reviews I thought I'd give it a shot. Maybe the dine in experience is better but the carryout was underwhelming. Two slabs of ribs (1 significantly smaller than the other), baked beans, slaw and shrimp and grits ran a whopping $85! The ribs were tender (the only reason this was a 2 star review and not a 1) but had no sauce on them, all they have us was a 2oz container of sauce for a slab of ribs. The slaw was dry if you can believe that, the meal as a whole was very disappointing, especially for the price!"
"Kobe Beef Brisket!?!?!?  Need I say more??  This was the BEST brisket I've ever had, and standing on that alone, Chicago q deserves 5-stars.  The fact that my best friends wife went into labor just 3 hours after indulging in a heap of pulled pork and BBQ sauce here is also 5-star worthy, maybe even a little helpful hint to all of you expectant mothers out there!This isn't your typical food on a metal tray, beer in a mason jar BBQ joint, it's a dimly lit, trendy, upscale BBQ joint.  The pickles and chips to start the meal were absolutely incredible as well, and I wouldn't feel like I'm missing out at all if I filled up on these in lieu of an appetizer.  We did start with the Fried Green Tomatoes, which were just OK, and we also shared a  side of mac and cheese (it's BIG) which was among the best I've had--crunchy top and super creamy.  Overall, delicious food, cool atmosphere, solid place.My ONE complaint.  Why are the sauces served in dainty cups with spoons?  Isn't BBQ meant to be slathered in sauce?  I find it hard to slather when you are using a spoon and you are meant to share all of the sauces among the table.  Maybe it's not classy enough, but bring in the squirt bottles for the sauces!!!"
"I want to love this place. It's in my neighborhood. And it's BBQ! What's not to love? Am not going to go into detail about the chips and pickles, which are okay. The cornbread is out of this world. I've found their mixed drinks to be on the disappointing side, so usually stick with beer and wine. But we go there for the meat. Last night, both of our entrees were disappointing. Tough, chewy kobe? Ewwww. And the ribs were just not that good. That earns a 3-star review. The thing that prompted the 2-star review was our being completely grossed out by the service. The guy pouring the water was resting the lip of pitcher on everyone's glasses when he poured. We really don't want the germs of 50+ people on our water glass. Second, when he reached across my plate for my water glass, he dragged his sleeve through my food."
"I love BBQ from all over, and this was the best I've had yet. Really amazing. I came here with a party from work, and we were lucky to try a lot from the menu. We had chicken wings, brisket, ribs, pulled pork and more. My top recommendation is the 'competition style' ribs. Wow! As far as sides go, the honey glazed corn bread and baked beans were my favorites. We got to meet the chef, Lee Ann, who I actually remember from the Bobby Flay Throw-Down. She was really nice, and took us for a tour of the kitchen. The smokers were really cool. The high quality ingredients and effort in preparation are worth the extra money."
"Mixed feelings...cool decor, great comp set up with homemade b&b pickles and potato chips.  Service was slow and BBQ was just okay.  Decent food but Feel it was overpriced."
"This place is beautiful. First time I stepped in here, there were people all dressed like they were at the Kentucky Derby watching horse races and shouting. It was really exciting to witness. but OMG the food is amazing. I love their pulled pork brisket with the variety of sauces. I really wanna try the Ribs next time.  Be sure to Request Phil as your waiter, he rules!"
"Went for dinner with my husband and in-laws on a Saturday night. We all enjoyed our meals (ribs, pulled pork) as well as the sides. They even accommodated my father-in-law's non-menu dessert request (just a single scoop of ice cream). Our waitress was very friendly and we even had a table visit from the manager to make sure everything was up to par. Fairly priced and great atmosphere. Would definitely return!"
"I took 18 customers here after I had such a great experience and we had another awesome meal.  We ordered the full pork shoulder (305 dollars) and it was a very cool experience.  The sous chef and manager came out w/ the full shoulder on a rolling cart, did a little talking, and pulled all the meat w/ bear claws in front of everyone for serving.  The only reason I dropped it from a 5 star to a 4 star was the service dragged... A lot....By the end of the meal everyone was looking at their watches thinking... We have to get out of here.All in all, very good.Thanks,Joe"
This has been a favorite of mine for the last 3 years. Bonus points for the well crafted beer list.
"BBQ/Smoke Lovers Heaven in the City!!!What an excellent dinner we had last night a Q. My parents have been a few times (Which says a lot, as nothing gets them out of the burbs...) Both my Mom and Dad love the place- My Dad is an BBQ/Smoke addict and my Mom as well as loving the food, loves the ambiance. It really is the perfect male/female compromise!!! Excellent masculine menu in a setting that is casually beautiful. As far as my ""Gluten Free"" needs... There was plenty to offer on my GF menu. The Kobe Brisket was delicious!!! We had a party of 16 and we were well accommodated in our own private room up front. Our server was Otha, and he was really on top of everything as well as being truly enjoyable to talk to. This was the perfect place to host my parents 60/40 birthday/anniversary party. They LOVED it as well as all of our guests- Thank you Chicago Q, we will definitely be back!!!"
"I walked here with a friend from the Ogilvie Transportation Center (~2 miles)...in the rain.  BUT IT WAS WORTH IT!   The homemade potato chips and the sweet pickles were amazing!  I'm not normally a pickle person, but these pickles were so good - I couldn't get enough.  My friend and I started off with the smoked dry-rubbed wings.  So savory!  Whenever I come back, I will definitely get them again.  We then moved onto the q2 - we chose pulled pork & a half slab of St. Louis ribs.  It came with honey sweet cornbread (which I loved) and four sauces - BBQ, spicy, a vinegar, and a mustard - ALL delicious.  I especially liked the mustard and BBQ.  The pulled pork was really good with the sauces.  We also shared a side of the bruleed macaroni & cheese = yum yum yum!!!In the end, it was quite a lot of food and we had enough left over for a third person.  I am looking forward to eating those leftovers!"
"What's all the hype about here, people? Have any of you had barbecue before?I came here with the roomie for lunch yesterday, with fairly high expectations, given the consistent raving I've heard from friends. I'm a sucker for high class Southern food and barbecue, so that perhaps inflated my expectations even further. In general, the ingredients are very high quality (as the ambience suggests), but the end results are often disappointments. Pulled pork ($14.50 platter) is clearly made from high quality pork shoulder, and is pleasantly devoid of large globs of fat. However, it sorely misses an assertive dry rub, and furthermore, if I closed my eyes and didn't know the pulled pork was barbecue, I would never be able to tell that this had been smoked. The same comments can be made about the Kobe brisket ($15.75 platter); very high quality meat, but you pretty much know what you're getting with brisket when the cut surface of the meat lacks the essential pink smoke ring. You'd think that with four homemade sauces, it would be posible to drown out the lack of flavor in delicious sauce; were this the case, I'd give Q three stars rather than two. Alas, two of the four (standard BBQ sauce and ""spicy"", which just tastes like the former except garnished with crushed red pepper) are unidimensionally sweet, and the East Carolina sauce has so much sugar that I can barely detect that it's based in vinegar. The only somewhat redeemable sauce is the West Carolina mustard, which is still nothing special, but at least has a modicum of balance in its flavor profile. I'd much rather they'd have gotten one sauce right instead of getting four sauces mostly wrong. Side dishes are alright; fries are nothing special, and cornbread is good but far too crumbly. Complimentary potato chips are pretty decent, and the homemade bread and butter pickles are actually very good (probably my personal highlight). Some of the other sides look interesting, but I can't get jazzed up about dropping $7.50 on a side of baked beans, even if they do contain Kobe beef. Service is very attentive, and ambience is nice, but pricing is steep - about 30% more than I expect to pay for barbecue, and even more in the side dish department. Given the atmosphere and location, however, this feels appropriate. All in all, Chicago Q suffers from a case of cue cognitive dissonance. It's all fine and good to stock your smoker with high end cuts, but that's not the point. It's all about taking a humble, often ignored piece of meat, and smoking it, seasoning it, and (with restraint) saucing it into something sublime. At the end of the day, Q attempts to let its ingredients shine on their own merits, which in most other culinary endeavors is the right approach, but not with barbecue. I'll definitely quell my que cravings elsewhere, and I suggest that those of you who are raving about Q trek to Smoque, or if you're adventurous, to any one of a number of hole in the wall joints down in the numbered streets to sample what this kind of food should actually taste like."
"I went in here last night for dinner, and could not have had a better meal or better experience.Lee (the GM) and Brian (our server) were just absolutely wonderful.I am vegetarian, so I had the fried green tomatoes (omg, yummy) the poblano cornbread (outstanding) and mac and cheese (best I ever had).They have a very impressive selection of bourbon as well, I recommend ""Q"".My BF had the wing appetizer, and he said they were the best wings hes ever had.I will definitely be back here."
"Great place for a birthday, although we were seated about an hour after our reservation time (eek!). Started with home made chips and pickles (nom!). Each bowl of gnoshes was immediately replaced once finished. Cocktails came quick and were delicious. I had the ginger fizz, which resulted in a new obsession with dark & stormy cocktails.Pulled pork shoulder was insanely juicy and flavorful. Our server said it could be prepared as a plate or a sandwich-- choose sandwich because Q has amazing pretzel rolls. Sauce was brought out in four little pots and was a perfect way to sample and taste by the spoonful. Did I mention the MOUNTAIN of cole slaw? So good.  Also ordered the mac and cheese and corn bread to share. We scraped the bowl clean of the rich, thick creamy and sharp mac & cheese. Corn bread was tasty too, but more of a side note to the serious entrees and sides. For dessert there was cheesecake, kentucky derby pie, carrot cake, brownie, bread pudding and it was insane-- It was a birthday afterall! The desserts definitely stood up to the entrees. The manager even brought out a round of bourbon to make up for our rough start with the long wait. Well done! Had a great time and will definitely go back."
"Certainly not your typical bbq joint, but worth a trip.  Like my friend Kit mentioned, it is definitely more steakhouse than casual barbecue restaurant.  The chips and pickles that they bring to snack on are great-- and don't you love when there is food on your table almost immediately after you sit down?  I do!We ordered the hushpuppies as an appetizer and even my fiance who despises anything made with cornmeal loved them and the fact that they had a little kick to them.  The barbecue was great and they bring a selection of sauces to the table so you can decide exactly which kind you want on your meal.  Oh, and the side of mac and cheese was amazing-- I could have ordered it for my meal.  Although we really didn't have room, we ended up ordering dessert-- 2 to share between the 3 of us.  The key lime pie was amazing-- one of the best I have ever had.  The derby pie was so-so.  It's a little more like a pecan pie and as a personal preference, I am just not a fan.Overall, a great restaurant.  A little pricier than we expected so it's certainly not the kind of place we'll be going to every week (especially when looking for a casual bbq experience), but definitely worth the trip."
"Not sure what I can say that hasnt already been said.  Perhaps my favorite bbq place in the city, if not anywhere.  Pickles and chips are amazing, and the ribs are some of the best food Ive ever put in my mouth (and I put a lot of food in there).  And when a place can do pulled chicken that is SOOOOOO good it doesnt need sauce, well, thats a winner in my book."
"Nice restaurant and ambiance, but a little pricey for BBQ...though fitting for the location. Competition ribs were very tender and tasty.Overall a good white tablecloth BBQ restaurant."
"Classy bbq in a 'southern plantation' style atmosphere. Fried green tomatoes in chipotle aioli. Meat sampler was our other appitizer. Don't miss out on the pulled pork in the vinegar based sauce. The hot BBQ sauce is also great. The brisket was also very good, but the chicken I could leave.the 'Competition Ribs' were outstanding! I haven't had the regular ribs yet though to see if the extra $$ for the competition is worth it. Way too full for dessert, but I hear it's also great. Next time.Definitely the best BBQ I've had since Smoke Daddy, not sure I can pick between these two. Chicago Q - WineSmoke Daddy - BeerThat's about it. Awesome place."
"I'm crazy about q! The food is excellent and the look and feel of the space is a refreshing design twist on Southern BBQ style. From the photography and beautiful wood floors to the furniture and staff's uniforms. Every detail is considered in this 5 star dining experience!Great for dates or large groups.Big into: ""Competition"" St. Louis Full Slab, Mac and Cheese, Hush Puppies, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Martinis and beer listBut I recommend letting the staff guide your drink and meal choices."
"Great BBQ! The mac 'n' cheese is amazing, I getting hungry just thinking about it. They have large portions that are great for sharing. The atmosphere is upbeat and cheerful and beautifully designed.  I've been there a few times and always leave satisfied!"
"I went here because of a coupon I found on Foursquare. This place is just around the corner from my house, which helps too. The building looks really cool from the outside. It's located in this weird white castle house. Inside it's very warm and cozy. I had hesitated to try this resto for a long time because I had ""heard"" that: 1.it was overpriced and 2. the bbq wasn't great.I tried it for myself recently and... basically...  I agree with what I heard. The food wasn't bad, but wasn't great either, and it's definitely over priced. The interior is really nice though so I wouldn't mind taking family here."
"Is it dubious when the table chips and pickles are mentioned so frequently in reviews?  Why not the Bbq itself?  Having said that, the place gives you the choice of BBQ in a self assembly style. This is a nice novelty but does not fulfill the needs of somebody looking to be served excellent Q. Maybe I've over powered my own Q with smoke and ruined my taste buds. I don't know. But I do know when there is little to no seasoning used in the preparation of the meat.  The brisket is tender but is missing the flavor from a good fat cap and seasoning rub. The pulled pork is ok and the chicken is ok. The ribs were fall-off-the bone but not particularly flavorful. You can combine your own sauces from 4 ramekins of mustard, KC, KC red pepper and vinegar based. This is the novelty. When I think about my Q experiences, this one was average. The Bourbon list is awesome. The baked beans and Corn Bread are really good. The meat by itself was good quality but the preparation with lack of smoke and seasoning (never mind the lack of bark on the ribs) disappoints.Went to Chicago Q Feb 2, 2013."
"I'm a vegetarian so I am starting out w/that so you know I did not try the meat at Chicago q (what they're obviously famous for).  However, the other people in my party did and were very satisfied with the meat sandwiches they ordered.  I however, ordered the fried green tomatoes which was an ""off menu item"" and it was just okay.  Nothing amazing.The restaurant has a good vibe and great outdoor/front seating.  Pickles and chips they give you at the table were great-best part about the meal for me."
"I have to say, I was so excited to see a BBQ restaurant in Gold Coast of all places but it was a disappointment... (they took over Tsunami! I was shocked that they were gone!)Here's how it went down.Make sure to make a reservation because even on a Thursday night, the entire restaurant was packed! I noticed that there were a lot of business people, probably headed there right after work or something.It was however super loud with the place being packed and all. It was very hard to carry on a conversation with normal voice.Service was just okay. Not great and not bad...Let's get to the FOOD!The complimentary home made potato chips and pickles were tasty! Actually, I couldn't stop eating the potato chips!The disappointment came with my Kobe chopped brisket sandwich...Again, I have to compare the brisket to Smoque. I have yet to taste another melt in your mouth type of brisket. I've only had this at Smoque so far... So the Kobe chopped brisket sandwich that I got was on the drier side and not to mention it was a bit hard to chew with not much flavoring going on.  If you are going to emphasize that you are serving not just any beef but Kobe beef, then it should taste a little more special, don't you think?Thank goodness for their 4 sauces that they give you. I had to just smear the sauce on my meat and so did my friend. She had the pulled pork shoulder and she said it wasn't much without the sauce.The SIDES:My friend enjoyed her coleslaw. She liked that it didn't have mayo and it was more vinegar based. For me the slaw needed some more kick.To my surprise, the cornbread was actually pretty darn good!Another disappointment of the night was the Broiled Macaroni and Cheese. I actually read some reviews beforehand and I read that the Mac and Cheese was suppose to be amazing.  So I convinced my friend to order the Mac and Cheese with me.  After all, it was just ""mac and cheese"" but ""Broiled macaroni and cheese""! It was just mediocre. Nothing amazing and nothing you haven't already tasted before.Don't need to order this here. You wont' be missing much!We didn't get to the dessert. From our meal, I don't think that we missed much. I did end up taking half of my sandwich home though...This place isn't cheap. In fact, a bit overpriced for the quality of food we got but I guess you are playing for Gold Coast and the ambiance.We had 2 glasses of wine, 2 entrees, 1 side and the total was over $60.On a side note, I noticed that their lunch and dinner prices are the same.Not sure that I'll be back but I did like the location.I do have to give kudos to the hostess party. Very friendly and approachable!"
"My friends and I reserved a table for New Years Eve. It wasn't too crowded but it wasn't empty either. We arrived a little early for a few drinks. The signature cocktails, especially the Pimm's Cup were great. The bartenders are really nice and very attentive. There's an upstairs party section, the downstairs restaurant looking into the kitchen, and a front bar area. The food is delicious. It's basically trendy barbeque.There are chips and butter pickles waiting for you when you sit down. You're looking at some fried green tomatoes and hush puppies. The portions are generous and the barbeque sauces (there are four of them) are so flavorful. If you're looking into dessert after consuming your entire meal - share. I ordered the cappuccino peanut brittle ice cream expecting 2 scoops. No, it was easily a pint of ice cream in the shape of a cake slice. Excellent, but huge.I recommend this place if you're hunkering for some barbeque, particularly some pulled pork."
"I wish I could give it more stars, but the more I think about it, the more it really is a 3.  The atmosphere is relaxed, but a little too dark and the music playing a little too lous for a restaurant like this, it would be more appropriate for a bar typre restaurant.  The waitstaff was very prompt in terms of settin gour table, clearing, and bringing our leftovers, but our main waitress lacked a lot of personality and was not very attentive.The food was good though!  They bring out seasoned potato chips and bread and butter pickles where most places bring out bread, my friends and I could not stop munching on them.  I ordered the orange blossom martini, perfect, not too sweet, strong, and very flavorfull. For my meal I had the pulled chicken with a side of coleslaw.  The chicken had no flavor, and I really had to use a lot of the delicious sauces they brought out on the side.  The bun was too soft and too sweet for this type of sandwich.  The coleslaw lacked enough seasoning, but was crisp and refreshing, and nice ocunterpart to the other heavier parts of the dish.I will not rush back, but if someone suggests it I will return."
"so now that i've been here a few times i'm going to go with a three. i'd go back, only for brunch.upscale, overpriced barbecue is not my style, though the ambiance and decor of this place is quite a delight.being a texan snob about bbq, this just didn't cut it for me. barbecue is not about bread, and q is ALL about bread. order anything and get a brick of cornbread. the sandwiches have more bread than meat. the sauces are fine and the meat is cooked well, but this was quite a peeve for me.if i had it my way, i'd just drink on their patio. if food was free."
"Everything at Chicago Q can be summed up into one word big! Big portions, big flavor, and big personality! I came here with my family for my b-day celebration and was well pleased. We all ordered a BBQ of our choice and shared mac & cheese, cole slaw, and baked beans. Everything was tasty, but the corn bread is especially good! My only word of caution would be from someone who grew up eating this type of food all the time, it's not exactly special occasion food. I wanted desert to celebrate my birthday, but after having inhaled a ginat chicken BBQ sandwach and all the sides I definitely could not handle that. So in short it's good food and a great place to take family especially if they are coming in from out of town."
"I can't believe all the rave reviews for a place that was just OK. If I had friends tell me they were going to dinner at Chicago Q, I wouldn't try to stop them, but if someone asked me where they should go for BBQ, Chicago Q wouldn't even enter my mind. The ribs weren't bad, they just weren't good enough to be memorable or spark a desire to return. If I lived across the street I might be tempted to try other items on the menu to see where they really excelled, but since I don't live across the street, I will probably never think about Chicago Q again after I post this review.Ribs - OK Mac & Cheese - OK Cornbread - Very DryColeslaw - GoodBraised Greens - The ran out?!?!?Ginger Fizz - Tasty!!!Cheesecake - Fantastic. Oddly enough it is one of the best I have had in the city. I would have to say it is second only to Il Mulino which is right next door. Pecan Pie - EhKey Lime - Good. My dining partners thought it was runny, but I thought it was good.Price - I don't think they were overpriced, I just don't think it was worth my time or the calories.Service - Very Good. It was Mother's Day and even though the server was slammed she didn't miss a beat."
"I made reservations for four, three months ago and glad I did.  At 7pm, on a Saturdaynight, this place was packed.  I have problems with my knees and my back so climbing up a tall flight of stairs was the first encounter.  I was not happy about it, but I did it.So, if you are at any way, shape or form handicapped, ask to remain on the first floor.We first were greeted for drinks which took a while.  The bbq chips and sweet pickles were a nice touch to start off but don't eat too much of these!  You will be full before the meal comes.We ordered the hush puppies and the fried green tomatoes, and split the cobb salad.  Absolutely delicious!My husband ordered the ""competition"" ribs and my girlfriend ordered the regular ribs and both appeared to be the same.  My friend's husband ordered the pork chop which was HUGE!  It was cooked perfectly.  I ordered the ""competition"" Kobe beef rib.  It was cooked almost too well done because there was not a lot of meat and it was crunchy.  It was very good.The cornbread was delicious, the greens, the mashed potatoes and the slaw were were all very good.Not bad for Chicago in the rib scene.  However, I am still searching.  I prefer a ""wet"" rib to the ""dry rub"" ribs but hey, that is individual preference.  I only wish a Kansas City based rib joint would come to Chicago.  Is there one?"
"Chicago Q has great ""fancy"" BBQ with a fun atmosphere.  The service is always spot on and this is a perfect place to take friends and family."
"Holy BBQ, Batman! This joint takes it up not just one notch but about fifty. I went during restaurant week, and was excited to have the 3-course dinner to try a few things off the menu.You may miss the right door into the restaurant because there were a few, but if you smell the food, you know you're in the right place. Also, it was a perfect mood setting....dim lighting but bright enough to see and read a menu! (Which some restaurants can't seem to find the balance.)When we got into the restaurant, we checked in with the hostess for our reservation, and she offered a free coat check. During the winters in Chicago, it sucks to have to pay $2+ dollars for coat check when you're paying for the meal, transportation there, etc. So, I really enjoyed having this option.The bar area was pretty large with about 10 high top tables with seating along the bar's perimeter that sat 15. Additionally, there was a smaller banquet room right off the front of the restaurant. Once sat, a food runner brought complimentary, homemade pickles and spiced chips. DELICIOUS!!! Our server was great and very informative. And for you bourbon lovers, we were informed that Q is known as the best bourbon spot in town. As an appetizer, we got the bacon hushpuppies. The 'pups had a spicy dipping sauce that was perfect for the texture and overall flavorings. Needless to say, the appetizer didn't last long...For my Restaurant Week meal, I got the hominy salad, brisket and cookies & milk. I was expecting, like other restaurants, smaller servings of each course....WRONG! Q served up normal servings, which I couldn't eat, but I gave my best shot. The hominy salad was my 1st shot at hominy, and while it was flavorful, it wasn't my favorite. The texture of the hominy just threw me off. I think I would have enjoyed more blackbeans and peppers in to cut the over-hominyness of the salad. When the brisket came, however, I was in heaven. I'm not a bit red meat fan, but this was different. You didn't need a knife. The meat fell apart perfectly and the BBQ sauce was yummy. And my favorite part of the meal....dessert....was perfect. I do wish they offered skim milk as 2% is too thick for my stomach. Three cookies came out, perfectly plated to show which flavors:  traditional chocolate chip, oatmeal reaisin and sugar w/ bourbon sugar glaze. I had half of each cookie and felt an immediate sugar high!I cannot wait to go to Q next, and I will (and have) recommended Q for a nice, upscale BBQ dinner. I will probably try the mac-n-cheese next we go, because the table across from us ordered it and it looked perfectly cheesy, toasty from the oven and appealing."
"I may be biased because I lived in the south for a few years and was spoiled, but this was just average BBQ.  If you factor in the cost, I don't see myself going back.One positive was the pickles they give you.  Those were great."
"The thought of returning to q makes me fall out of my chair and begin having an orgasmic seizure on the floor. Step aside Smoque, there's a new sheriff in town.I went with a large group which allowed us to sample probably 80% of the menu. We got most of the apps, the pulled chicken, wings, both the regular and St. Louis style competition ribs, the Kobe beef ribs and a full pork shoulder. All I can say is wow. This place would bury establishments in Kansas City.I have three recommendations:1. Do whatever you can to get some Kobe beef ribs.2. Take as many people as possible to facilitate ordering the full pork shoulder. I mean, the chef comes to your table to serve it and pulls the bone out like it's a magic trick. Unbelievable.3. Wear elastic pants."
"Excellent competition barbecue and sides with a comfortable atmosphere.I was in town on business, and we found ChicagoQ using our online tools. When we first arrived, we were told the wait would be about 30 minutes (8pm on Wed night), but it was only about 10 minutes at the well-stocked bar before we found our seats waiting.Appetizers: The variety is just fine, we had the VERY good hush-puppies. You get 5 golf-ball sized puppies, very tasty with chunks of bacon etc. This was what everyone around us was ordering too, so I can't comment on other appetizers much.Entree: At our table, we had both types of competition ribs (baby back and St. Louis) as well as some pulled pork. The pork was fine, but not what I wanted. The ribs come dry-rubbed and smoked, without sauce. There's a side-cart with 4 sauces that are tasty enough, but you almost don't need them; the ribs are so good even without. This is the chef's competition recipe, and it shows.Sides: We ordered the Kobe baked beans. Apparently, they take the tips off the Kobe beef ribs (also on the menu) and make up a skillet that's about 40% beans, 40% rib tips, and 20% sauce. VERY good with not a small kick.We rolled ourselves out of there for about $120 for the 3 of us, though if you go for the regular ribs you could probably shave $30 off. Dessert? No chance... there was no room left."
"Great food, great service, worth every penny. Will absolutely go back."
Such a great place! The food is awesome.  The Poblano Cheddar Corn Bread and the Beef Brisket are the best I have found.  When you sit down they bring you great homemade pickles and chips-- a really nice touch.The ambiance is great and the place is always busy.  Really nice front bar and pretty decent service.  q clearly strives for exceptional service and they do a nice job.
"I recently spent a few days in Chicago visiting family and friends.  On one particular night, about nine of us decided to have dinner at the Chicago Q.  When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to see that we were given a private room, complete with a flat screen tv (a football game was on)!The BBQ here is delicious!  The meat is so tender and juicy it falls right off the bone.  And did I mention the macaroni and cheese and cornbread?  Delicious!We're a fun group, but full of strong personalities.   Anything we asked for, our server,  Lateef took care of.  He even anticipated several requests without skipping a beat.  He helped make our evening an enjoyable one with his attention to detail.This is a restaurant I definitely recommend for anyone who loves BBQ."
"Came here with a few girlfriends one Thursday evening. First must note that the main dining area is extremely noisy, which made it difficult to converse. As for the food- we started with the BBQ Flight and Hush Puppies; really enjoyed the Kobe brisket and the sauces that came with the different meats, but found the hush puppies to be too dry. We shared a mac and cheese, cornbread, slaw, and the ""Competition"" St. Louis Full Slab ribs. The sides were nothing special, and the mac and cheese in particular was disappointing. The ribs were pretty good- tender and meaty, and lots of them. Rounded out the meal with the espresso brittle ice cream, which was very sweet and rich. We were stuffed by the end of the meal, but while everything was fairly good I wasn't blown away by any means. My favorite food item was actually the sweet pickles and garlic that come as a side :)"
"This place makes my list of top BBQ restaurants.  Overall I enjoyed the ambiance.  The beef brisket sandwich melted in my mouth, no need for sauce perfect with just the rub they use.  May seem pricey, but the portions make up for that.  For dessert I had a Bourbon Milkshake, which was icing on the cake.  I recommend this place to everyone.  Also the service was great, our waiter always asked if we had any questions and tended to us as often as he could."
Great winter comfort food.excellent BBQPerhaps the nicest surprise is the cornbreada little pricey but there are some complimentary sides like the chips/pickles
"I've walked by here plenty of times and it wasn't until a friend suggested it for dinner that I knew the restaurant existed.  I came in with a group on a busy Thursday night.  Luckily we had reservations b/c the place was packed.   I loved the decor but admit that I felt a bit strange eating BBQ and mac n cheese in such a lovely setting.  No peanut shells on the floor here.The pulled chicken as absolutely delicious.  The coleslaw was also good and they give you enough to share with the entire table.  We had a good rotation going on the sides so I got to try a few different things.  The chili was yummy and the mac and cheese was good (not great).  I liked the variety of sauces that they brought to the table and the server was super friendly.  I'm not sure if it was a bad night for brisket but the piece that I tried was super dry.  Overall, this place is great and I'd love to come back for more."
"We came here for my daddy's birthday last night. Made reservations for 4 at 7:30pm. Thank goodness we did because the restaurant was pretty packed for a week night!We arrived about 20 minutes early and they sat us right away. As soon as we settled in, we were served homemade bbq potato chips and a bowl of pickles! LOVED them both! The pickles remind me of how bread and butter pickles taste (my favorite pickle flavor!).We skipped appetizers, went straight for the main course.Our waiter (forgot his name) was patient and very informative with all the items on the menu. My mom had kobe beef rib with vegetables. The kobe beef rib was ok. Vegetables were a bit weird to my taste. Ick..My dad, boyfriend and I shared an order of ""competition"" st louis full slab with fries (super tender, meat fell right off the bone!) and Q3- half slab of baby back ribs (not as tender as the full slab but still good), pulled pork (super yummy! esp when you use the sauces on the side) and kobe sliced brisket (mmm.. with sauces on the side!).We also ordered a few sides cornbread, coleslaw, kobe brisket baked beans and mac n cheese. I liked the coleslaw, the light flavor of coleslaw evened out the bold flavors of all the meat we ate, and kobe brisket baked beans, this is prob the best baked beans I've ever had!! It has so many chunks of meat and the right amount of beans.Mac and cheese was very cheeeeeezy, just the way I like it BUT it wasn't too warm.. it probably got cold during dinner because i eat super slow and i wanted to eat everything!I would definitely come back and order a LOT less. The restaurant is very spacious, nice atmosphere, prices are reasonable and service was excellent!"
"Not bad, not great, just... exactly what you'd expect. Don't let my indifference fool you, I'd gladly come here over Famous Daves any day of the week, but I just don't feel like it stands out in terms of BBQ.I came here on a Saturday evening before seeing a show at the Water Tower Place, and I easily secured a reservation for 6pm. We arrived promptly and spent a fair amount of time looking at their beer and cocktail offering. They don't offer descriptions for their beer offering, so we had to look up a lot of the beers to figure out what exactly they were, which was a bit of a pain.I ordered the New Fashioned Cocktail which was Chicago q's take on the Old Fashioned. This drink was good, but nothing spectacular... it basically just tasted of bourbon with no emphasis on the bitters, which was a bit of a let down. My boyfriend ordered the Mint Julep and seemed pleased with it, and the presentation on this drink was great in the classic metal cup and the large mound of ice.After we put in our order of food for the table, the food came out in literally 10 minutes. We were shocked at how promptly the food was assembled, but this made sense given the fact that the majority of BBQ is prepared beforehand and its just a matter of putting it on a platter or on a bun. Regardless, here is what our party of four ordered:1) Kobe Chopped Brisket Sandwich: My boyfriend's brother ordered this and seemed pretty happy with it. I didn't get to snag a bite, but it looked like exactly what you would expect of a BBQ brisket sandwich.2) q3 - Two Pulled Meats + Half Chicken or Half Slab: We split this between three people, and it was more than enough food for each of us having a ""moderate"" appetite. There were three ounces each of the pulled meat and we each got between two to three ribs from the half slab. We ordered the brisket and the pulled pork, which were just so-so. The brisket had a tough texture and you could see lines of fat in the meat which was a bit chewy. The pulled pork was incredibly moist and succulent, but the flavor seemed to be lacking a bit. Luckily the meat mopped up the sauce, so that helped add some flavor to the meat. The half slab of St. Louis ribs were probably the best part of the meat offerings. They had the right amount of fat to meat ratio, and they were perfectly cooked/smoked with a great flavor. I can't say anything bad about these, and I loved how the meat just fell of the bone with no work whatsoever (besides me hungrily gnashing into the meat).We got a side of a fries with the platter, and they were under-seasoned, nothing spectacular. We ordered an additional side of the Kobe Brisket Baked Beans which, next to the ribs, was the winner of the evening. We each got a few heaping spoonfuls of this goodness, and I had to force myself to not gobble these up.Lastly, I feel that the complimentary appetizers they give you upon seating deserve a special mention. Their house-made BBQ chips are fantastic, they're not quite kettle chips, but they have a nice crunch and seasoning to them. The housemade pickles were also delicious, being well seasoned and not overly pickled. I was hoping these would be an indicator for the rest of the meal, but unfortunately this wasn't the case.The service was great--very helpful, prompt, and knowledgeable, but this cannot outweigh the overall ""meh"" factor of the food. The atmosphere is nice, being cozy and upscale Southern, but again, this doesn't help much if the food is lackluster.If you're seriously considering giving Chicago BBQ a shot, I'd recommend going elsewhere off the beaten pack, such as Smoque or Smoke Daddy. If you're looking for a convenient meal downtown without a wait, then Chicago q is probably for you. I won't be back, but I'm glad I gave it a shot."
"I wanted to REALLY like this place but I would go to a lot of other places in Chicago for BBQ before I came back here.  I had the feeling like this place is set up for out-of-town business travelers, leaving all the ""good places"" for the Chicago residents.The food was okay.  We had the hush puppies and dry wings as appetizers and had better on both.  Then we ordered our entrees and they were brought out 90 seconds after we ordered . . . literally . . . 90 seconds.  We had the feeling they were either rushing us or that they were just dishing our food up from the steam table in the kitchen.The pulled meats were good but a little dry.  They give you four small ramekins of BBQ sauce to share for the table and they don't go far.  I would have rather they asked me what sauce I wanted and gave me more of my preference. Portions were large. The Mac & Cheese stood out as a side dish.For all the hassle of the reservations and the confirmation calls and the driving into that area and the parking, it will be a while before I go back to Q.  I would much rather go to Smoque on the north side and get better BBQ with less atmosphere and less hassle."
"Brought my boss and another sales rep-we wanted fun and great food (it IS Chicago after all).  Our waitperson (very energetic, nice and articulate woman) explained the different choices, that the portions were huge and kept us well hydrated in cocktails.  We ordered 2 entrees and still had tons to bring home to my grateful husband.  I'm a KC native, so love that bbq-and this was very good.  Great space, server, and just the right amount of ""attentive without intrusive"".  Will bring hubby back to pick his own leftovers next time."
"This place is fantastic at a pretty good price. The best course may have been the appetizers that they provide every table: chips and pickles. I was really hungry, but the chips were fantastic. I had the Kobe sliced brisket with just the right amount of fat around the edges. It was average, but the four sauces served with it were fantastic. I took half of the brisket home and they gave me a sauce cup to go with it. The sides of cornbread and coleslaw were better than the brisket, but I always tend to like the sides better than the meat. I left in a coma and I will be back."
"SO GOOD. Yum. Beautiful place, great food, good prices. Right off the red line. Parking looks hard though. Sides are pricey, but great selection of drinks, entrees and sandwiches. Great place for a date or night out with friends."
"I discovered this place over the summer and wish I had known about it sooner! What a gem-- upscale barbeque?! Yes please! Their outdoor patio in the summer is probably my favorite patio in Chicago. The food is also great-- the pulled pork slider is incredible, as are their bread and butter pickles. I love that they serve pickles and kettle chips as starters. I still dream about their bbq sauces. Next time I'm here, I'm going to buy a bottle so I can bring a little bit of Chicago Q home with me!"
"Went there last night after playing a bit at Dave & Buster's.  Found the place on Yelp so went in without a reservation.  Sat at the bar area in front and watched the Hawks game during dinner.  The decor inside was super cute, nice place for a date or girl's night out. Free chips and pickles were AWESOME. So delicious.  I was really hungry so I totally ate too many chips in the beginning.I got Kobe beef brisket sandwich + poblano cornbread.  I thought the beef was so melt in your mouth yummy.  But I wish it was warmer.  Especially the cornbread.Bf got the half slab of baby back ribs + regular cornbread. Dry rub on the ribs, good, not great. Also could have been warmer.  Cornbread was huge on his plate, but it also could have benefited from being warmerMac n cheese appetizer. Creamy and delicious with a bread crumb crisped on top.  Good stuff.We were too full for dessert.  Service was really good, even though we were sitting in the bar area.  On our way out we saw their little private room that would be great for a birthday gathering. But I just wish all the food was warmer =P"
"This place is serious about their BBQ.  I really loved it.  I came here with some friends for my 5th bday dinner, oh.. details, details.  Anyway.  This place deserves to be tried at least once if you like BBQ.DO NOT LEAVE HERE WITHOUT TRYING THE BBQ WING APPETIZER!!!I seriously think about those damned wings all the time, when running, shopping, bathing etc.  We loved them so much that we ordered a 2nd order and almost fought over them - ridiculous.Our waitress couldn't have been nicer.  We had to move to a larger table to accommodate the ever increasing group.  Our drinks and things were moved without a hitch.  She gave us a few minutes to get settled and we started ordering.  We ordered some apps, the wings and the hush puppies and both were delicious.i got the ribs for my entree and they were 'fall off the bone' fantastic.  I loved that the sauces were on the side because I could try the meat without the sauce to get the true smoky flavor.  The sauces were very good, but I found myself wanting more of it.  Sure I could have asked, but the tablespoon of sauce that they give you just isn't enough...come one, it's BBQ, afterall, fancy or not.  As my side dish I got the cole slaw and it was just...meh.  I tasted my friends BBQ pulled chicken and it was perfect.  Smoky, tender, just perfect.The desserts were nice and our waitress added a candle to each of them for my bday.  Again, she was fantastic.They have some really nice specialty drinks that rival some of the best new specialty cocktail bars.  I like this place and I will definitely go back.  I didn't find it overpriced at all.  Actually just perfect."
"I'm a Texan new to Chicago so of course I'm looking for a solid BBQ spot. I ordered the ribs, mac and cheese, and some fries. The ribs are good but not great. The mac and cheese was delicious and the fries are good. Service was excellent! All in all this was definitely a 4 star experience. Oh and I loved the complimentary pickles and chips!"
"I absolutely loved the charm of this place.  The tones of the dining room, white wainscotting up to the 2nd floor, and a  large scale picture box really warmed up the atmosphere.  Attentive service, some good beer choices, filling sides like cornbread, macaroni & cheese, and some delicious mashed potatoes.Pulled pork = goodnessAnd everything is very appropriately priced.  Would come again just to bask in the southern Q atmosphere."
Just simply awesome. We selected Chicago Q for restaurant week and it's the kind of place where you can't wait to take out your phone after dinner and start telling all your friends about.  They were just slammed and the service was still perfect fast and pleasant.  Drink selectionApsentreedesert (MILK and COOKIES)So cool that the Head Chef came out to talk to us too.  A Chicago must.
"This is a really great restaurant, located close to the clark/division redline. I ordered the bear hug by recommendation of the bartender and another patron sitting next to me at the bar, and it was a nice drink on a rainy evening. Dinner was good and the food was pretty tasty. It was nice to have the manager come by and check in on us, but I could have done without the garbage being dragged by me and through the restaurant multiple times while I was eating or the lady standing around taking tabs on how many tables were free and estimating how much longer each table would be eating."
"Ok, I am a transplanted Southerner and BBQ fanatic, so I am a bit picky about BBQ. That being said, I found the BBQ at Chicago q to be fair at best (pulled pork), with some of the dishes on the sampler platter I ordered arriving dry and tough (brisket) or cold (pulled chicken). Not impressive.The side dishes, on the other hand, were amazing (homemade potato chips- yum - grilled polenta squares - yum), as were the lemon shrimp, which were so perfectly prepared they tasted like lobster. If I ever went back I would order shrimp and side dishes."
"The food was fabulous and so was the service.  We'll definitely be back more than once.  The bbq chips and sweet pickles they put on your table to start are wonderful.  I had the pulled pork and it was absolutely delicious.  My husband had the salmon and he said it was the best salmon he'd ever eaton.  The kids had brisket, ribs and alligator.  They all raved about them as well."
"The free plates of pickles and potato chips as soon as you sit down are a great start.  The pickles were a little sweet for my preferences but the chips were fresh and delicious. The drink menu was average - some good cocktails (wife approved the Q Martini) but the beers were all bottled.  Luckily, the specials ($2 off about five different beers) made up for this.  Next up were the bacon cheddar hush puppies - crispy, warm, and infused with the delicious aroma of bacon.  So good I wish there were more on the plate.For the main dishes, I had the q2 with the pulled brisket and a half slab of baby back ribs.  The meat was amazing - tender, flavorful, juicy, and just enough spice.  Three different barbecue sauces are provided a la carte (spicy, regular, and a vinegar style) for your dipping pleasure.  The wife got the salmon special which was pretty good but the filet was a little small for the price ($25).  My recommendation would be to stick with the classics and you will not be disappointed.  Great atmosphere and food, a fun place for a date, family, or a large group of friends."
"Well, at the end of the day it's all about the food, isn't it? This is such a good looking restaurant; it's a whole townhouse done out in pretty whites with great use of original features. It's a lovely space and attractive bar. Super friendly staff. However the bbq...Kobe Brisket was simply chewy. I would prefer it if it had been slow cooked in a sauce, like a traditional brisket, for hours so it was fork tender. Instead it was dry and chewy. The sauces are served on the side and are OK. Spicy was nice, Carolina OK, one was gravy-like and there wasn't enough to make a difference. The St Louis Ribs were not very flavourful. Again chewy. Now compare with an ugly place like Carsons where the bbq is great. I would much rather go there.Coleslaw was OK, beans were good. Wine was well chosen and priced.I just have a feeling that the bbq isn't good enough and this space will morph into maybe a 'New American restaurant,' which would be just fine as I would like the excuse to go back to the building, but this isn't it.2 stars reflect the food, nothing else."
"Pros: This place is very good- good service, quality food, nice atmosphere.  The ribs were fall off the bone and the meat sampler appetizer was delicious. The pickles are my favorite!!!Cons: Skip the macaroni and cheese. It's sadly kind of bland. Also, expect to wait a while."
"Finally, I have found my go Barbecue Restaurant in Chicago. I ordered quite a bit and enjoyed each dish thoroughly.  I started with the BBQ flight which is a great way to sample the different types of sauces they offer.  The House Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies were every bit as good as they sound. My hats off to Chicago Q for finding a way to make Hush Puppies even better (not an easy feet). The Kobe Chopped Brisket (my entrée) was also excellent, despite having filled up on appetizers beforehand.  I definitely wouldn't have ordered two appetizers if I knew how large the entrée portions were (there huge).              While I would categorize Q as a barbecue place, the atmosphere is somewhat upscale.  The Entrees range from about $11-$35 and the dress would be considered on par with business casual attire (if you show up in a t-shirt and sweat pants you will feel out of place). Chicago Q is more of hip night life kind of place, as opposed to many Barbeque places that tend to cater more to families (I personally prefer the Q set up).  If I didn't have to wait 15 minutes to be seated (when I made reservations) I would have given Q a five star rating, as the service and food were both outstanding. I will be back!"
"I would love to go 5 stars and say its great but all the food was over-cooked, had way too much salt, and portions were skimpy. I will give them another chance because it is  Xmas eve and maybe that explains some of the problems."
"Two tries, still unsure of this place.  I like the concept, but have mixed experience with the place.  First time went with the Pulled Pork sandwich, second time with Kobe chopped brisket. The good: Choices of beef, pork, chicken and fish - so everybody is happy (except those weirdo grass eater friends....)The not so bad:  ate majority of it without any extra sauces as they did not appeal to me (most sauces do not).  Would like to see more options and healthier sides- sweet potato chips/fries would go well with q'ing!  Maybe a lighter cole slaw option- you don't need heavy mayo or excessive vinegar to make a good slaw (remember the BBQ joint on North Sheffield? They had the best cole slaw anywhere, light and flavorful- (healthy, too!)The ugly - Portion size?  Really need to reconsider larger portions my friends..........Terrific concept, execution is a little weak and inconsistent.  Gotta work harder, please!"
"Great barbeque place for many reasons.  Food quality is outstanding and the atmosphere/decor is superb.  white table cloths, comfy leather couches, and agrarian art makes you feel warm and comfortable.  Excellent value, too."
"Really cool vibe - unpretentious and about as laid back as you would want an ""upscale BBQ"" joint to be.  We were sat up front by a fire place (perfectly toasty on a chilly Chicago night) and pretty close to a television showing sports highlights.  Probably could have done without the television, but again, I don't think they are trying to be overly fancy.  It works.  One thing that bothered us a little was the closeness of the tables up front.  We had two people at a four person high top table and the two extra chairs were continually being bumped into and fumbled with.I've read a few times that the food comes very quickly, and I'll admit that it was a bit of a turnoff at first.  I'm not sure why, though.  Maybe the old ""holy smokes, they must have had this sitting back there waiting on the next idiot to order!"" concern.  Regardless, the baby back ribs were cooked just right - falling off the bone like you read about - and the pulled chicken sandwich wasn't dry at all. Mixed with the right combination of sauces that are brought to the table, you can have yourself a great barbecue meal.  I was happy and I was full.Quick tip - don't be afraid to try the sweet pickles they put on every table.  They'll knock your socks off."
"This place is so good! Everything I have eaten here has been delicious, from the barbecue-rubbed chips they bring you as you sit down to the Pulled Pork Shoulder/Pulled Chicken dinner plate. If you ever have friends or family in town you have to bring them here. It's nice, but not fancy, and also casual enough to where you can wear jeans and a hoodie. It's not too expensive either, which makes it even better. The place also looks deceivingly small, but it is a huge inside (there's even an upstairs). My boyfriend says Q has the best ribs he has ever had (""so good the meat falls off the bone"") and the Pulled Pork/Pulled Chicken is definitely the best I have ever had. I have a big appetite too and I always have left overs, so I'd say the portions are on the larger size. You must try the cornbread too. There's two kinds, the ""spicy kind"" and the ""regular kind."" Both are equally delicious, and it will hands down be the best cornbread you ever try. The staff is also very friendly and the service is great; you'll have your drinks refilled constantly. This place is a must!"
Probably the best ribs I have ever eaten.  7 of us had fantastic meals and service.  Capped off by a great tour of the kitchen.  Thank you Q!
"It's pretty good BBQ - not super great, but definitely better than average.  The chopped brisket is particularly good.  They bring delicious homemade pickles and onions to your table when you sit down.  The greens are also excellent, not least because they have bacon."
"Southern charm captured in the great city of Chicago. Pulled pork and beef brisket are great. Save room for some decadence at the end. Bourbon Pecan Pie, a la mode of course, was a great way to top off the meal. Fun atmosphere, great staff out front."
"My husband and I are just kicking ourselves that it has taken us over 2 years to find this place.   We walked up around 7:00 on a Saturday night and waited only 5 minutes to be seated outside. I loved the comfortable southern front porch atmosphere.  We were served chips and pickles as free appetizers.  I'm not usually a bread and butter pickle kind of gal, but these were quite good!  The bbq chips were gone in .5 seconds.  My husband and I both ordered the pulled pork and split an order of mac and cheese.  The meal came with a huge piece of cornbread.  The food was great--and the portions were so large we had enough for a meal the next day as well.  The service was a bit lacking, but I am pretty sure our waitress was new, and we weren't in a hurry so it was fine.  We will be back soon!"
"I love Chicago Q. I came here for a family dinner and everyone was in love with the food. The decor is really cool inside. They have some great specialty drinks. Their cornbread, pulled chicken sandwich, and fried green tomatoes are highly recommended."
"Ok, 5 stars for BBQ? Seriously?This was no everyday barbecue. In fact, there was nothing ordinary about this place at all. The building, the staff, the food, everything was amazing!I'm an average fan of barbecue, if it's good I enjoy it but it's not something I usually crave.  It was right down the street from our hotel so based on some good reviews I agreed to try it somewhat reluctantly. Oh what I would have missed if I hadn't gone!First, for the price in Chicago this is definitely a don't miss. It's in a cool old building that's clearly been recently remodeled to feel somewhat upscale but not pretentious.We had ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. All of this comes quickly (they warn you) and served with 3 different and unique sauces. Note: even the mild has a bit of kick so beware if you don't like spicy foods. Also, don't miss the macaroni and cheese. Not quite my grandmas, but pretty darn good!Last, but certainly not least, the Espresso Brittle Ice cream was UNFREAKINBELIEVABLE! Maybe it's because I have a severe weakness for ice cream, but oh-my. The brittle is home made and the perfect blend of buttery crunch and sweet melt in your mouth. Ok, just writing this is making me salivate... do I have a problem? Get this dessert!"
"I was pleased with the size and the interior of this place, but the positive aspects stop there.  We ordered the brisket and pulled pork.  Our food came out in--at most--five minutes, which should've made me suspicious before I began digging in.  Everyone's dishes came out the same: way too dry, and way too bland.  My boyfriend, who grew up in North Carolina, knows good BBQ, and he was quick to say that q's attempt just didn't cut it.  Good BBQ should not have to depend on sauce to make it stand out.  The cornbread was sweet, which we didn't care for, and the mac and cheese was salty and a little TOO smothered in cheese.  I was excited to try this place, but I'm sorry to say I will not be back."
"Pretty darn good BBQ. St. Louis spares are a good choice. The salmon salad was generous and tasty as well. One of our favorite parts of the meal was a surprise... they brought out bowls of homemade chips and pickles. Delicious and fun! The only food disappointment was the cornbread, which looked awesome, but was too dry to finish. We loved our waiter, who was super friendly. Although, I did discover when I got home that he had splashed red wine on my sweater. I wish he would have told me when it happened so I could have put soda water on it. The atmosphere was crowded and energetic, in a good way. We didn't know that a celebrity TV chef owned the restaurant until my husband recognized her walking out of the kitchen - even more fun!"
"Great little neighborhood spot with very good bbq, professional staff and a wonderful atmosphere. Prices reasonable, wine list solid, and patrons friendly. Wish they had draft beer, but no one's perfect."
"A few friends and I stumbled upon Chicago q and we are very happy that we did.First of all, the BBQ is reasonably priced and tasty.  I rec the Beef Brisket with fries.  The bun is simply amazing.  Be sure to liberally use their 4 bbq sauces!My gf had the Half rack St. Louis Ribs with cole slaw.  It was enough to satisfy her, which is saying alot.The decor was really classy for BBQ.  Almost too nice, but it made for a pleasant and enjoyable dining experience.The service was super attentive.  My water was never more than half empty.  Go here if you can!p.s. Love the (complementary) chips and pickles!  never thought iId say that."
"I have been here twice.  Once for lunch and once for brunch.  Let me start by saying the service was consistently good.  Both times the server was attentive and friendly.  No complaints in this department.The food....inconsistent.  When I went for lunch, the BBQ, mac and cheese, salad, hush puppies and homemade cookies were all fantastic!  We tried the different kind of sauces which was fun and delish.  The homemade pickles and chips on the table were so, so, so very good.Brunch....ugh.  Not good at all.  I had the southern eggs benedict.  The eggs were pretty hard in the center and not runny at all.  I figured I would just deal with it because I was excited to try this version of eggs benedict with fried green tomatoes.  Then I tasted the dish.  Tasteless.  Yep, you read that right...tasteless.  Cajun hollindaise ...how can it be tasteless?  Not sure how but they accomplished making a potentially delicious flavor-bomb completely tasteless.  It was so bad that I asked for BBQ sauce because I thought they do that well and at least I would have some flavor even if it wasn't great with the dish.  The vinegar sauce made it better but not good.So, would I recommend coming here?  For BBQ?  Sure.  For brunch?  No way."
"Love this place. As many reviews mention, this feels like visiting a friend's home (albeit a super classy, beautiful home with lots of seating). The atmosphere is comfortable and clean, with friendly service that enhances the cozy experience.The food is outstanding, and arrives quickly. In lieu of a complimentary bread course, everyone receives homemade chips and pickles. The chips are this outstanding, interesting blend of smoky-spicy and lightly sweet. I could eat an entire bag. For a kinda embarrassing taste-treat, dip your chips in the spicy barbecue sauce. For main courses, our party ordered baby back ribs, some other cut of ribs, a pulled pork sandwich and kobe beef brisket. Everything was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. The kobe beef brisket was my favorite, and the star ingredient in my ""best leftovers sandwich ever"" the next day. We also shared a milk & cookies dessert, which was highlighted by an amazing oatmeal-bacon treat. My only complaint is that they don't appear to have beers on tap. What? That's just weird. Get some taps in that bar, Q. Otherwise, keep doing what you're doing so well."
"We LOVE Chicago Q! They have captured the ability to offer great portions of delicious food, with a warm but trendy atmosphere. We have been here many times and always leave feeling full (and with leftovers) but without a dent in my wallet! I recommended the bacon-cheddar hush puppies, the kobe beef, pulled pork, and especially the mac and cheese. This is a great place to bring visitors from out of town or for a nice night out with friends or loved ones."
"I thought the ""regular"" (non-competition) baby back ribs were competition quality.  They were cooked to the right tenderness - easy to take a bite, but not so soft and mushy that  the meat falls off the bone - and well seasoned and smoky. Get the q3 to share so you can sample the kobe brisket, pulled pork and ribs."
"If one of the specials is the french toast stuffed with mascarpone, GET IT! Oh my god. Out of this world. It's served with cinnamon butter, some sort of delicious hash brown / home fry-ish concoction, and the freshest and most tasty orange slices I've ever had. Followed with ice cream and cheesecake, this would be my last meal on earth. Seriously, it's amazing. I love Chicago q!"
"It's decent barbecue, but what I really like is the classy feel of the place. On a cold autumn night, we were greeted by comforting smokey smells upon entry to the warm restaurant. The lights are dim, the kitchen is bustling, and the decor is very appealing. Outstanding service and comfortable chairs. BBQ good, pickles and chips outstanding, sides decent, sauces tasty. Very good. Don't be confused by the pretentious exterior - it is not a pretentious place."
"Me: ""Is it reasonable for two people to share the q3 (3 meats, $30) and a couple of sides?""Waiter: ""Yeah, a lot of people do that""Me: ""Ok, we'll do that""10 minutes later, two large plates of food arrive, each with our selection of meats and we are suspicious that we may have gotten two q3's.  We dig in.  A few minutes later, the waiter comes by and we thank him for separating our shared q3 for us.  What's that?  He ordered us two of them?Completely scammed by our obnoxiously smug waiter, I felt pretty peeved at this point.  But not as badly as later when I got home.  We had plenty of leftovers and asked them to box it up for us.  When I opened the box later, there was only about half of what we hadn't eaten!  They got rid of our remaining brisket and pulled pork.  Livid, I called the manager and explained our situation and she took one q3 off my bill.  This is a nice gesture of reconciliation, but still: be on your toes!To be fair, the food was delicious, the sauces are delicious (though the vinegar one was perhaps too strong even for me, a vinegar lover), and the house made bread & butter pickles and bbq chips they give you to start the meal are killer.  Nevertheless, this place is obnoxiously expensive, and I can't imagine myself at Division & Dearborn again with a craving for BBQ that I can't extricate myself out of the Gold Coast to satisfy."
"It was kind of just ok. Great setting - love the decor more than the food. Friend aw it on ""Check Please"" and wanted to go check it out.  Service was good - it was not crowded at all at lunch on a Tuesday,. I love pickles, so I loved the bread and butter pickles at the table and now I need to go home and make some. Also need to figure out the pickled onion served with the entre.. red wine vinegar, oregano and....???  The chips were ok. We had the hush puppy appetizer. May be it was an ""off"" day. They were very dray and fell apart. he chipotle sauce was way too spicy for me. I had chopped Kobe beef brisket with coleslaw. My friend ordered a side of mac-n-cheese to share. The chopped brisket just can not be eaten as a sandwich. The chunks fall out all over - and it is A LOT of meat on the bun. I just ate the meat. The meat is dry rubbed and you add your choice of sauce to it.  I tried the 3 not spicy ones. Did not like the vinegar ones at all, although I do make my own pulled pork with a vinegar sauce. This was too tart for me - a person who can suck a lemon. I settled for the mild sauce. HUGE helping of coleslaw that I could not finish as much as I love coleslaw. It was a lot of food for a very good price. And they have a great fixed price lunch special. But it was just mediocre. Not having the meat cooked in the sauce just does not give the meat a full flavor. The mac-n-cheese was watery, and I am not a fan of mac-n-chese anyway. Too full to even try a dessert as tempting as derby pie was. So, it's decent food for a good price."
This food was not healthy at all but absolutely delicious.  I had the brisket sandwich which was not too fatty and full of flavor.  Luckily you do not have to decide between sauces as they bring you a little bit of all of them.  The mustard and spicy bbq sauce were my favorites.  Prices were very reasonable and service was attentive and friendly.
"My whole life I've hated pickles. Nothing can ruin a meal as much as a pickle can, I've always thought.Then I ate at Chicago Q. And before you know it I'm eating their bread and butter pickles they start every table off with like they're candy. And that was before I had even ordered. I could tell this was gonna be good.I had the pulled chicken sandwich and others at my table had the pulled pork and ribs. The meat was incredibly tender and the variety of sauces were so good. Not to mention there was enough food for three of me.I'll be back, Chicago Q, and I'm gifting my whole family jars of your bread and butter pickles, because it's the right thing to do."
"Cue the meat, cue the sauce, cue the goodness and cue the Q! Oh dear meat Gods, you have come through yet again with some ridiculously yummy BBQ! I was blown away by this place - it's so cute inside (think Martha Steward Living cute) with the white and dark wood overtones. I love the upstairs area and the private dining room would make an ideal spot for a party. The whole place feels like a small castle with nice touches - and the sound level is perfect for dinner. The food is absurd. Smoked chicken + cornbread + mac & cheese? This is comfort food at its best. The beer selection is plentiful, great wine list and a bevy of alcohol. For dirty south comfort food, Q really classes it up. I cannot wait to return!"
"We went to Q for lunch early on a weekday and sat on the patio.  The patio is nice, enough room between the tables and plenty of shade.  The bus boys were on top of filling the water and the waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  My friend ordered the $15 Prix Fixe and subbed a salad for dessert (no problem) she had hush puppies, salad and a brisket sandwich.  The portions were more than enough and everything was delicious. (I had a bite of everything of course)I had the pulled chicken Cobb Salad and the BBQ Flight.  This is way more food than one person needs but I like to try a bit of everything.  The salad was HUGE and tasty, I took half home for supper and each of the meats on the flight was tender, moist and flavorful.  The cornbread was AMAZING and a big enough piece to feed a small family.  My favorite sauces were the spicy and the mustard.  Overall everything was great and I will be going back.  My favorite part was seeing how carefully and neatly they had packed up my 100 to go containers.  Not jammed all together into a styrofoam box but each and every meat, sauce etc had its own container with snap on lids!"
"In short: Delicious Barbecue, great service and chic design..."
"Q has a great atmosphere with attractive interior design. It's VERY reasonably priced for the quality and amount of food that you're served (bottomless chips and pickles, a strange yet addicting combination). The pulled pork shoulder wasn't my favorite dish, but I loved the wings, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The baked beans also had generous amounts of meat in them, which was refreshing and a bit different. I also enjoyed all of the sauces that came along with my meal.I definitely recommend the milk and cookies for dessert (candied bacon maple cookie... so good!!).My Tanqueray and Tonic was a bit too strong. Had to add more tonic!When I feel like loosening the belt a few notches, I'll definitely be returning."
"So I hate to admit when I first saw Chicago q on the Restaurant Week list I passed it up not even wanting to check out the menu.  But, I have to give kudos to my dining partner on making me take a second look.  I was sure wrong in not wanting to try this place out!  My mouth is salivating just thinking about the kobe brisket, pickles, mac and cheese, hush puppies, honey butter cornbread (more so the honey butter then corn bread was a bit dry) and the key lime pie.  A feast fit for a BBQ Queen!  Service was attentive and thankfully not over bearing and I didn't get an eye roll when I asked for more honey butter to pack with my cornbread.  I'm definitely coming back with the bf who loves bbq and was annoyed i left him out."
"New Year's Eve was our second visit to Chicago q. We knew we had to go back after our awesome experience at Thanksgiving and the phenomenal turkey, but this time go back for their regular menu. Great again.Some restaurants don't understand how service, above and beyond the food, can make or break an experience. Chicago q gets it. Everyone with whom you come in contact with is exceptional. I just love it and this place is a new favorite.List of greats:TurkeyCornbread (the spicy one)GreensBaby back ribsCocktails. Like burbon? This is the place.Mac n CheeseBBQ sauces. Cool that BBQ comes with servings of 4 to try.My only caveat is that the brisket slices seemed a slightly dry. Go for the ribs or the pulled meats, you won't be disappointed.Portions are large, unless you're Adam Richman you're most likely going to go home with leftovers... yay!Prices are reasonable. Service is flat out great. Ambience is wonderful.Here's hoping Chicago q adds turkey more often... not just once a year. That meal was a thing of beauty.Other establishments can learn a thing or two by coming in and observing how service is done. Let's hope they do."
"The food was okay - nothing special, but satisfying. The service was frustrating. We had a large group, so I made reservations a couple of weeks in advance. Our party was seated an hour late with barely an apology. I would have expected complimentary appetizers or at least the manager coming out to talk to us."
"We ventured to q because of a Facebook mama's recommendation, and went on Valentines Day with an 11-month old. I was very, very hesitant to do so. But the evening was wonderful (when I say evening I'm somewhat exaggerating because we had a 4:45pm reservation!). The staff made us feel very welcome and at ease when we walked through the door, while I was totally expecting a ""why did they bring a baby, ugh, annoying"". They took our coats, seated us quickly, and brought out a high chair and children's menu without asking. I like the decor and the vibe - especially the large wall art of the truck driving down the road. The complimentary appetizers of chips/pickles also made a great start to the night. Our waiter was very friendly, made many good recommendations throughout the night, and had an easy way about him. Our food came quite quickly (they brought our daughter's out in about 3 minutes much to my delight, even before our food which was smart on their part) and we enjoyed our meal and cocktails very much. I would definitely like to come sans kids, and while there weren't any other kids here (I wouldn't expect it on v-day) I wouldn't hesitate to bring our daughter back. The prices were good for what we were served, and we even brought home some leftovers which I just polished off and tasted amazing the 2nd time around! We shared a rack of ribs, mashed potatoes, pulled pork/chicken dish, and a wonderful salad with smoked tomatoes (awesome). I only wish we would have made room for dessert. {As a disclaimer, I think its important to dine out with kids so they get accustomed to how they should behave at a young age, and we are always prepared to make a quick exit if things take a turn for the worse.}"
"Was here for a work function a few weeks ago, so we got the fancy upstairs room all to ourselves.The service was great - even though they were out of some things, the waitress was extremely apologetic and somehow managed to memorize our orders, even though we were a really large group. Props to her!The food was delicious, too, although I rather regretted it as I was just coming off the flu and it was a bit heavy for poor sick me. It tasted reaaal good going down, though!I can imagine that it gets a little loud, although luckily it wasn't too bad upstairs for us.As other reviewers mentioned - it feels like someone else's beautiful home. The decor and ambience is really very nice.All around a solid place!"
"This is such an amazing BBQ place. My husband and I love barbecue and this did not disappoint. The service is great, the home made pickles and chips were great and the meats were smoked and so tender. I normally do not like cornbread, but this again was amazing. We brought my parents here and they were impressed as well. I like that they have multiple authentic sauces that can be used that are different from your normal: south Carolina honey mustard, a vinegar based BBQ sauce.  I would definitely recommend people come try Q"
"Came here for my bday yesterday and from the moment I walked in everyone was so friendly. I'll keep this short. The ambiance was perfect, the pulled chicken was amazing, the mashed potatoes are a must. Our server, I believe Brandon was his name was amazing, he knew the menu like the back of his hand, he made my experience amazing. And if it's your bday the cookies are amazing. Oatmeal and bacon?? Yes please.  My bday was a success"
"Take great quality BBQ, and I do mean great. Put it in some great upscale atmosphere. Add some great service. And then, once you did all that, you put some reasonable prices on it? How could you possibly lose?? Was there with a large group, the staff worked with us on appetizers so everyone got a taste. Quality was great, outside of a few minor glitches (Cornbread was a bit dry, Hush puppies a bit too long in the fryer) but the meat? fanfrikkentastic. Worth the trip, you wont regret it."
"This place is really great when the weather is nice so that you can sit outside. They do have heating lamps, so it's not bad in the fall either, but I'm not sure if the outside will be open once it actually gets colder. The food was really good, but the menu is small. If you're a picky eater, I recommend looking at the menu ahead of time to make sure that you can find something. The atmosphere is trendy/casual, so I would say it's a good place for a date or a get-together with a friend. It's pretty small, so I don't think it would be great for groups."
"Wife took me here for my birthday. We had reservations but chose to sit in the bar area, which I really liked. Beer selection was small, but did have some unique beers that you don't see at many places so that was a plus. I got the competition ribs and the wife got the shredded Pork sandwich. My ribs were good, not the best I have had in Chicago, but good. But the wife's shredded pork sandwich was awesome! That was one of the best I have had.  Enjoyed this place and would go back again."
"Chicago Q is an upscale white tablecloth BBQ joint, sounds paradoxical but it works. The interior is modern and upscale and they serve the whole range of BBQ favorites from chicken to brisket to ribs & pulled meats. I tried the St. Louis ribs with a side of the kobe beef baked beans. The ribs were served without having been sauced which I prefer so that you can really taste how good a job of smoking they did. And they did a good job giving the meat a good smoke ring. They did serve the ribs with a sample of four sauces that you could use including a tomato based mild BBQ, tomato based hot BBQ, vinager based Carolina style BBQ jus and a mustard based BBQ that was yellow. The ribs were tender and reasonably juicy with a good level of smoke and pulled apart easily so you could dip in the many sauces. All the fat was fully rendered off the meat so they were not fatty or greasy. The baked beans were good but could have used a little more punch from some vinager or a little more heat from pepper sauce or somthing somthing.All in all Chicago Q is a great addition to the area, has a nice atmosphere and the full range of BBQ classics. I will be back to to try the rest of the choices including the babyback ribs, the Kobe ribs, the competition ribs,  the chicken, the pulled xyz and on and on.... Yum."
"4.5 ? Go here for lunch. (For the price, portion size, and no wait)They give you free sides to start! Pickled cucumbers(I guess that'd just be pickles......lol) and bbq chips!I got the pulled pork sammich which came with a HUGGGGGGE piece of jalapeno something cornbread and pickled ... sliced radishes? Anyway, couldn't finish it so I took it home and heated it up and the cornbread. It somehow tasted 100x better microwaved, lol.Oh, the space is loveeeeely and the service is prompt."
"One of my favorite places in the city!  Every time I go I have an amazing experience.The service is spot on, the food is delicious, and they have a fun beer list!Definitely worth checking out!"
"This is, bar none, the best barbecue place in Chicago. And I would make the argument, and I know it would be controversial, that they hold their own with some of the best barbecue places in the country. And yes, I've been to Austin. I've been to Carolina. I'm from Virginia. I've had lots of barbecue. On their best nights at Q, the brisket falls apart in your mouth. Their sauces are the best in Chicago. And I once had a waiter insist on getting me a new, black napkin because he thought the white napkin I had been given would get threads on my dark jeans. The service is exceptional, top to bottom. In fact, I think their busboys can hold their own with any busboys in Chicago. To stop myself from interminably rhapsodizing about Q, I'll end with one gripe: why do they have to serve up Coke in those little mini, 'classic' bottles? C'mon, I'm eating your salty fries and meat. It's making me thirsty! And while your excellent beer selection helps to quench that thirst, sometimes I need to call in backup, and 4.2oz of Coke ain't gonna cut it."
"This place is freakin' awesome.  I am in love with everything from the homemade pickles and crispy, salty potato chips you get when you arrive, to the perfect cocktails, and to the unbelievably moist, falling apart meat.  When you walk in here, you feel like you're being invited in to your Southern great auntie's Kentucky mansion.  Comfortable and fresh, like a day at the derby.I enjoy sharing the q3: you get your choice of two pulled meats (pork and chicken are my favs), and either a half slab or half chicken.  The half slab of baby back is delicious.  DELICIOUS.  And I'm not even a rib person.I adore the spicy BBQ sauce the most (on its own), but I also enjoy the sweet mixed with the vinegar-y one.  The meat comes without sauce, which leaves the diner a little canvas on which to be creative with sauce combinations and meat/side mixing.Braised greens: yum.  Cornbread: YUM.  Mac and cheese: DOUBLE YUM.I've found a place to go back to over and over again.  Love it."
"Chicago Q has some good points, but during our visit more bad points were on display.  When we first arrived, the hostess told us that it would be a 45-minute wait because we did not have a reservation.  We decided to stay because the wait was about 45 minutes everywhere in the neighborhood.  After 45+ minutes, I approached the hostess again asking for an update.  She stated we were on the top of the list, and it would only be 10-15 more minutes.  All right, no problem.  I went back to the bar to wait with my husband.  After 30 minutes, I approached the hostess again since we were at the top of the list and had seen several couples seated already.  She stated it would be about 10-15 minutes.  I asked her if this was an accurate time since the last two times she has been completely off.  A different hostess took over, and she stated she would have us seated within 15 minutes.  After exact 15 minutes more of waiting, we were finally seated.  In case you were wondering, the 45 original wait actually was an hour and a half, doubling the time.  I suggest that they hire a hostess that knows how to accurately tell time.After being seated, our waiter was good.  He brought us the complimentary chips and pickles that every table receives.  The chips and pickles were fine; however, neither was anything to rave about.  Our water was never empty because the restaurant has a handful of people walking around to pour water.  I'm glad though that we just got water because the soda at Q comes in 8oz tiny bottles for $3 each, no refills.  We both ordered the pulled chicken sandwich, one with cornbread and the other with fries.  The chicken was great, better than most meat at other BBQ places.  Both of our sandwiches disappeared; however, the fries were mediocre and the cornbread was dry and crumbly.   The sides at Q seem to need more attention.After finishing our dinner, we went out to pick up our valet parked car.  It seemed quite fishy that our car was parked in the Pay-to-Park right in front of the restaurant.  I must say that it would have been nice to just be able to Pay-to-Park our car instead of $12 valet parking, but the valet were using it instead of allowing customers.  Overall, the double wait time and mediocre food weren't worth my time or money."
BBQ in the Gold Coast?  I was a little skeptical when we came for a birthday but became a quick convert because;- complimentary BBQ chips and sweet pickles. They must put crack in these!  We couldn't stop eating them!  The best part is that they keep coming. Our table must have eaten 4 bowls easy. Any places that keeps the food coming is tops in my book. - delicious shrimp and grits. Took a friend from the South here  and she raved about the home-made grits - decent portions for the price. Don't be fooled by the decor or location - they're real generous with the portions!
"Yelp led us to this place for lunch while checking out the Air and Water show. Great spot!Gorgeously decorated, very attentive, fast/efficient, friendly wait staff and wonderful food.More about the food: bold, smokey flavors with a rustic presentation.  For example, the kobe chopped brisket sandwich: tender chunks of meat about the size of dice served on what had to be a freshly baked bun, served with at least four sauces.  The greens were mixed with kale and seasoned with bacon--best I have ever had and our kids loved them too.  The kids split a pulled chicken s/w.  Without the sauces, the chicken might have been a little boring.I think the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and upscale style of the restaurant.  Our family of four (kids ages 6 and 4) ate for around $55"
"All the hype for Chicago Q set the bar a little too high. The menu is great, and the meats are delectable. The 'appearance' of country-style cooking is definitely not up to par though. The sides have no taste, very bland. The BBQ potato chips are definitely great though. Everything else could use a makeover. I think the most disappointing part was the fact that they didn't tell us our drinks were not free refills, so we were charged each one after being 'asked/pushed' into having more drinks. That their lemonade left a 'sour' taste in our mouth is pun intended."
"Honestly, if you have been to the south or had authentic, quality southern food then this place isn't anything to write home about. The food is good, but nothing special."
"I've been twice and am just going to say it. This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. So far, I've had the pulled pork and the kobe sliced brisket. Both were flat out awesome. The spicy BBQ sauce is my preference. Just enough spice.The service here is why this place earns five stars. Because, despite the affordable prices for dinner, the service is more reflective of a $100 a plate type place.Finally, this place has a fantastic assortment of bourbon, and makes a mean mint julep. You could just come for drinks and leave happy, but you'd be robbing yourself of the opportunity to try some truly  great food. I plan on going back as many times as possible before the the rest of the Gold Coast discovers it."
"Initial Disclosure:  I'm vegetarian, so I did not try a majority of the items.However, what I did try was above par.  The onion strings were crispy and salty--so very delicious, probably the best I can recall ever having.  The pig powder chips actually have no pig in them, they are just potato chips cooked til brown and seasoned, and they were ok.  The salad was way above average and great, and the macaroni and cheese was good, but didn't rock my world.  The cornbread was very delicious and not at all grainy and very moist.  The homemade lemonade was very good too.We had a sampling of all of the desserts, which were great too.  If you are vegetarian be aware that one of the cookies has bacon in it, and the pound cake club also has bacon in it.I realize that vegetarians are not the target customers, given that it is a bbq place.  However, I'll probably go back with other people, and it would be great to have a vegetarian entrée next time.  Seems like a black bean burger would fit in pretty well with the rest of the menu.  With an option like that, I would bump this to a 5 star rating.The atmosphere is really great.  It's definitely more upscale than an average bbq place, but does not cross over in any way into being prissy or pretentious.  I described the decor as how I would want my South Carolina summer house to be decorated (you know, should I ever have one of those).Service was very, very friendly.  Hopefully this place will be a great success!"
"Now I like to think of myself as one of those who doesn't go to the fancy, froo-foo places.  So when I first heard of Chicago Q, I told myself I wouldn't go because BBQ was supposed to be down home cooking.  I was wrong.Went for lunch today and I loved it.  First of all, the place looks good.  But more importantly, the food is great.  They start you off with pickles and BBQ chips, which is Thriftys on Wilson special.  I split the Q3, with half a slab of St. Louis ribs, pulled pork and brisket.  It came with the largest piece of cornbread I have ever seen and I also ordered some mac n cheese.  Honestly, everything was great.  I think the quality of meat they have is a notch above the other BBQ places because even though I'm stuffed, I don't feel fat.While it is pricey, the gas I currently have and the smile on my face prove you get your moneys worth."
"When this place was suggested to me, at first I thought ""Oh no. Of course, soon after I become a pescatarian someone wants me to go a BBQ joint where the pull of pork will lure me.."". But no fear, I was quite content. I started off with a SideCar, and when the waiter didn't know what that was, I told him to not bring me one if the bartender didn't know either.  Luckily, he sure did--I had two of them, they were nice and smooth, made with Courvoisier and reasonable at $9 each.  I wasn't that big of a fan of the bread and butter pickles, but probably just because this NY gal is more a fan of the dill.  The homemade potato chips were pretty good though, and this from a girl who doesn't usually eat chips.  The buttermilk battered onion rings were quite delicious and a good sized portion which we didn't finish. My friends polished off the wings appetizer and I believed they enjoyed the chicken. For my main course I had the BBQ shrimp over polenta which is actually an appetizer but was more than enough for a meal (I had plenty for leftovers today). Beware though: these were crazy spicy, not indicated on the menu.  I also ordered two sides: braised greens, which were excellent, and honey cornbread, also very good but I would have liked a little butter to accompany it. (Due to an error in Q wrapping up my friend's salmon with my leftovers, I also got to taste it, and it was also very well prepared with tasty brussel sprouts). My friends shared the apple cobbler and enjoyed that as well. They also offer bourbon flights, I assisted one friend in tackling his (after the 2 sidecars, I couldn't have done that on my own)Service was very attentive at all levels, from the host to the manager to the server to the runners."
"Soooo addictive Butter Pickles!  Came here for a good friends birthday, and once we sat down, two appetizers were put down in front of us...freshly fried potato chips and those delicious butter pickles!  I couldn't stop eating them, they were that good.  As for the dinner, the wife and I split the q3, which was a choice of 2 pulled meats (we chose the Kobe Brisket and Pulled Pork) and Chicken or Half Slab of Ribs (we chose the Half Slab of Baby Back Ribs).  Kobe Brisket was good and soft, of higher quality than other briskets I've tried, but was more leaner than I would of liked.  Pulled pork was okay, as well as the Half Slab of Ribs.  Three types of BBQ sauces and Ketchup were also served, I really didn't care for any of the sauces.  None really appealed to me.Overall, good food, great service (very attentive and courteous), and okay prices (slightly higher than the norm BBQ joint)."
Delicious meal. Eight of us had eight different dinners and they were all amazing. Cocktails fabulous. Wine selection superb. Side dishes yummy! Can't wait to visit Chicago again to try more of the menu!
"I was really pleased to finally be able to hit up this joint. A buddy of mine had been telling me about Q for a while and we were finally able to figure out a time to go. I was definitely impressed. First of all, I was really amazed at how big the place is. We went for lunch, and it wasn't crowded at all...we went right at Noon. We were seated right away in a booth in the back room. On the way back there you pass the main bar area, which is made for entertaining. Too bad it was lunch and we couldn't enjoy a bourbon or two.I knew I wanted a sandwich, and I ended up getting the pulled pork, at the recommendation of the waiter. I loved what they brought out. It was a generous portion of pulled pork on a pretzel bun. They serve it with 4 sauces on the side. The spicy one went the best with the pulled pork. The one sauce that is watery is too vinegary. The others were too sweet. The spicy sauce is the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. The cornbread that came on the side was also delicious - the perfect combo of sweet cornbread with the spiciness of the peppers. They have a pretty cool upstairs area as well. I can't wait to head back here some evening where I can kick back with friends, relax with a few drinks, and enjoy some amazing BBQ!"
"I'm definitely a BBQ girl through and through, but until I ventured to q, my experience was mostly with untainted hole-in-the-wall joints. Needless to say, I was a little skeptical of a place that was propositioning me a cloth napkin instead of a roll of paper towels.But in the spirit of restaurant week, I boldly went where every 5'3"" half-Jew has gone before - and that was in search of a killer brisket.q did not disappoint on any level. For starters the decor of the restaurant is just really pleasant: homey but modern. You won't find a single tin license plate or 8x10 headshot of an all-you-can-eat rib winner from 2002 hanging on the wall. It's light and airy, but cozy and chic. Truthfully, I don't know how they pulled it all together for a cohesive look, but it totally works.Now, onto the food: APP-hushpuppies: if heaven was a fried dough ball dipped in chipotle aioli, it would be the hushpuppies at q.ENTREE-kobe brisket: perfect.-pulled chicken: as per a headline I once saw on a porno in a gas station: a mount of moist, juicy meat.SIDES-cole slaw: bangin-corn bread: sinful-fries: should really be sweet potato, but okaySAUCES-four to a table, all unique and flavorful. I was rotating bites with each sauce for a whole different experience every time.DESSERT-carrot cake: where is Drake when you need him? Baby you da best, you da, you da best. Da best I ever had, best I ever had....No. Really. This slab came straight out of the oven, the icing was still melting on the cake. I would definitely recommend this place for anything from a date, to a guys night, to family-in-town. It's versatile in that you can make your outing at q as upscale as you want. They offer wines by the bottle, but also have ""Milk and Cookies"" on their dessert list. See what I mean? And the service was really great: humble and attentive.I'm really full."
"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and I was really excited because he's been there before and told me a lot of great things. Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies - it was delicious, better than other hush puppies I've had in the past. the bacon were in big chunks not small bits, the middle was creamy and yummy. The dipping sauce was really goodKobe Sliced Brisket - I got mine with coleslaw which was good, but I'm still not a fan of coleslaw overall (not their fault, just personal preference). Meat was good, but I think I had higher expectation. It felt a little dry (even though there was liquid at the bottom of the plate...so odd). It wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't memorable.Competition baby back ribs - my boyfriend ordered that with cornbread. Cornbread is really good! The ribs were also really good (should've ordered that instead!). The meat was nice and tender with great flavors.Sauce options:Mild BBQ - I felt it was too sweet, my boyfriend really liked itSpicy - not at all even close to spicyEastern North Carolina Vinegar - surprisingly pretty goodSouth Carolina Mustard Sauce - also pretty goodStrawberry Rhubarb cobbler with cinnamon ice cream - Ice cream was good when eaten together with the cobbler, eaten separately, the cinnamon flavor was so powerful it was actually unappetizing. Cobbler was really good, but the more I ate the sweeter it got.Pros: great service, very attentive (sometimes I might even say TOO attentive...), great foodCons: very loud (definitely not a date restaurant, very difficult to carry a conversation), our table was very close to the servers station/kitchen so they were standing nearby and at times it was very uncomfortable (felt like I was being watched while I was eating)Overall, a good experience. I'd probably go again and try other things."
"Went here for a a late-ish Saturday dinner here- two weeks after opening. Hadthe BBQ sampler, baby greens salad, pork-rub chips, mac n'cheese & some complimentary ""house pickles"" which were awesome!It was a great sampling of the menu and my boyfriend and I enjoyed every dish! Will definitely be back for the brisket!!The decor is also very nice, lage dining room and upstairs area.... looking forward to coming back after they get their liquor license- I heard something about Mint Julep specials?"
"The pickles and BBQ chips to start with were the way to my heart. I ate sooooo many pickles. So was having Daisy Cutter on the beer list. I wish every place I went did. I loved the hush puppies and they lived up to how I'd been hoping they would taste. The ribs were great and the cookies we had for dessert were also really good. The only low points were that the cornbread was really, really dry, which was a shame because if it hadn't been I would have enjoyed it. The taste was there but it would crumble into dry bits over my plate every time I tried to take a bite. Also, the cole slaw was not the best and as I always look forward to cole slaw, I was sad to not enjoy it.I loved the interior and the lighting and the staff were wonderful during the enitre meal. I'm looking forward to coming back for more pickles and trying out some of the pulled sandwiches."
"Awesome atmosphere - the pictures don't do it justice. Service was almost overwhelming - we probably had a total of four servers making sure we had enough to drink, to eat.As far as the food? Meh. Granted I went on a night where I wasn't starving...heck, I wasn't even really starving. We split the chili because it was a cold, windy and rainy night here and it was okay. A little too ""smokey"" for my tastebuds and too much sour cream (which is something I'd never thought I'd ever say). I might give it another go on a night where I'm more than hungry. But for the first time around, give me Montgomery Inn ribs any day of the week."
"Loved the food! Loved the server! Loved the atmosphere! Didn't mind the bill. This is a great place for some fabulous barbecue.  A bit more pricey than some bbq joints but well worth it. I have been looking for really good ribs for a long time, their's were outstanding. Cannot wait to go back!"
Nice experience. Staff friendly and attentive. Fast service. Food would be at table no more than 5 minutes after ordering. Not sure if its always like that but was surprising how fast they would get food out. Order the sampler appetizer. Chicken and brisket were ok while shredded pork was good. Brisket was a little chewy for my liking. Baby back ribs were the highlight of the night. Tender and the meat fell off bone. The different sauces added good flavor to the meats. Overall nice experience.
"This is a mini review for those with a point of reference:The food is 80% as good as Smoque (basically the same standard BBQ menu with same sides which is not a bad thing) BUT the ambiance, dessert and drink menu makes it a cooler place to dine out. The have a nice selection of bourbon and whiskey with a pretty extensive wine list (mostly California). The desserts are pretty inventive and a nice touch (bacon and oatmeal cookies, rhubarb pie with ice cream). This place is a great way to marry a fun time out with BBQ."
"This place is great! Went here with a bunch of girlfriends and we left raving! Alfredo was our waiter and couldn't have made our experience any better. He truly takes his job very seriously and provided exceptional service. Ask for him! The atmosphere is great, as it is pretty nice for a bbq place. You can still feel like you can show up in jeans, but you could still make it a nice weekend night out. We were thrilled to not only meet the chef, (a female, which we love, but she has some interesting creds too...was challenged to a throw down with Bobby Flay, and has been on BBQ Pitmasters a few times too), but we were given a kitchen tour! We also saw their private, upstairs room, which would be a great spot for a party or group dinner. You have the upstairs to yourself, there is an enclosed room with a wine wall, and then an adjacent living room area with a big screen TV.I'm even more thrilled to discover that q is now on OpenTable...even better! I'll definitely be back."
"I was a little disappointed in Chicago Q, but only because I'd spent a week reading the lavish praises of fellow Yelpers and had probably built my hopes up way too high. One thing I will say: their pulled meats are dee-li-cious! The boyfriend and I shared the q3, which includes 2 pulled meats (we got the pork and chicken), a half rack of St. Louis ribs, and honey-butter cornbread. We also got the bruleed mac and cheese, which wasn't nearly hot and gooey enough for my taste. Too much crumb crunch and spice, not enough melt-in-your-mouth goodness. However, I don't mean to sound overly disparaging. It's definitely a solid establishment. The pickles and bbq chips served as a pre-appetizer rocked my world. After I had tasted the cornbread and mac, I just gave in and turned my attention directly to the pickles, which are big slices of tangy, garlicky goodness. Definitely worth picking up a jar to take home, if they have them. Like I said, the meats were tasty. I recommend the spicy bbq sauce, which isn't really spicy at all but has a nice subtle kick, and the mustard sauce. Next time, I think we'd skip all the extras and just go for a big plate of the pulled meats and some pickles on the side :)To be fair, we went at a somewhat awkward time (2pm on a Saturday, neither lunch nor dinner). The service, however, was still excellent--we had a very cheery waitress who made our dining experience pleasant. The space is beautiful too--its tucked around a busy corner, so the area is lively but not overcrowded, and both the interior and exterior are charming and refreshing. Almost like you're eating at a friend's house, rather than at a restaurant. Just lovely. We sat at the bar area near a cute little patio at a high round table, where we could see the Manchester v. FCBarcelona final. Nice touch."
"Good barbecue is not difficult to find in Chicago. Great barbecue, however, is another story entirely. Chicago Q meets the ""great"" mark and then some. For those that are familiar with the prior establishment at this location, Tsunami, you will be shocked by the interior overhaul. A warm, contemporary rustic farmhouse vibe has replaced the once drab and dreary interior of the former establishment, and complements the barbecue experience. I ordered the St. Louis half slab of ribs with a side of cornbread. Q also offers ""competition style"" ribs which are reportedly out of this world, but you have to get there early as a limited supply is made each day. The regular St. Louis ribs were amazing, and fall-off-the-bone delicious. There are some seasonings on the meat, but the actual barbecue sauce is served on the side and includes 3 tasty options including a vinegar-based sauce, traditional, and spicy. The ribs can stand perfectly fine by themselves, but the BBQ sauce adds the extra variety. I've been to several rib joints where the meat is fatty and has the membrane near the bone. None of this is true of the amazing ribs at Q as they clearly take pride in selecting the best meat possible. The cornbread was among some of the best I've had, and includes a pad of some sort of sweet butter which makes it that much more delectable. Our servers were friendly and accommodating. Food took a little while to come out, but it is absolutely worth it and expected considering the restaurant soft-opened this week. I will absolutely be returning to Q, hopefully to sample some of the competition style ribs!"
"Went with a pretty good sized group of meat eaters from work (good sized as in they know their meat and can put it down) so I figured it would be pretty good.  I have to say being from KC I was a little hesitant when they told me we were going to a BBQ place.  Not that I'm a BBQ snob but there is no shortage of outstanding BBQ joints in KC but I tried to go in w/ an open mind.  Over all an outstanding dining experience.  Great atmosphere, cool vibe and VERY attentive staff.  We never waited or had to ask for anything twice, drinks were always full, great recommendations on how much to order (5 carnivores so we wanted to make sure we had enough to eat), very friendly, etc.Highlights; as most of the other reviews have stated, the Kobe Beef Ribs are a MUST; they are T-Rex sized ribs and def worth the price tag.  The Pulled Pork was tender and moist and the competition ribs (we got both the St. Louis and the Baby Back) were very good.  The Baby Back were a little dry (only complaint and it's minor) but all in all, very good.  The smoked dry-rub wings were outstanding and the house bacon cheddar hush puppies were a hit.  Enjoyed the sauce variety and if I had to pick one, would go w/ the Spicy (if you like sauce on your BBQ).  Had the opportunity to go on a kitchen tour w/ Chef Whippen which if you have the chance, I highly suggest.  It was pretty cool to see where the magic happens and the smokers are impressive.Side note, they have a very nice list of bourbons which was a plus!Def recommend Chicago q if you're in CHI and are in the mood for BBQ.  It's not cheap but it's worth it, even if just for the Kobe Beef Ribs."
"The ambiance is whats to be expected for the neighborhood with a feel of east coast, cottage interior.My ""q"" burger tasted like it was stuck in the fire rather than nicely grilled.  I was chewing off burnt embers; dry as a desert.  My dad is an expert on the weber, so I'm educated.  Medium rare is medium rare...and a bbq place should know that.  The smoked melted gouda on my dry, not-medium rare burger still  had the rind on it which made it difficult to bite through.  I just peeled it off in one full circle...kinda gross. Also, the waiter told me not to get the ""classic burger"" because it's equivalent to a mcdonald's burger.  wtf? this place is nice dining experience and he is using a mcdonald's reference.  i kinda wish i got it instead of the ""q"" burger.My sister had this maize salad that tasted like feet.  It's a type of corn feed, with black beans, tomato's that were wrinkled and other veggies that you could not taste because of the overwhelming taste of feet.  For all the shit that was in this ""salad"" you would think it would be tasty...not the case. also, i asked for a cappuccino which they did not have. wtf!? and instead i got cold coffee.  gross.fuck this place.  it's over rated except for the wooden siding on the wall and the lamp shades."
"I'm in love. And it's not the mint julep talking. Chicago Q is gorgeous. It's been said and I'll say it again - upscale BBQ and yet, completely unpretentious. The space is comforting and inviting. We had a party of 10, and they sat us at a large table in the private room upstairs, which was phenomenal. Our table was set up with plenty of homemade chips and delish homemade bread and butter pickles right when we sat down. I would come back here with a large group in a heartbeat; we were expertly served throughout the evening. You quite honestly haven't lived until you've indulged in the bacon cheddar hush puppies here. They simply cannot be skipped if you've made it through the front door of this place. I was lucky enough to be with a group of friends that were up for sharing, so I got to sample many different meats. The brisket is my front runner, followed very closely by the pulled pork. The pulled pork with a healthy dose of the Carolina vinegar sauce is sheer perfection; the dry rub on the brisket is so good that it's perfect on it's own. The St. Louis ribs fell off the bone with a mere nudge. And the mac and cheese.... oh the mac and cheese. The cavatappi noodles hold the cheese sauce so well..... the sauce is mild yet flavorful, with just a slight dusting of buttered breadcrumbs dusted over the top of the dish. As for the aforementioned mint juleps.... they give new meaning to ""Hello, I'm Drunk"". If you enjoy bourbon, order one, you won't be disappointed. If you're like me, order a ""weak"" one and you'll drink every last delicious drop. (I know, I totally just lost all my street cred by admitting I can't handle my whiskey anymore. *Sigh*)Chicago Q is the perfect upscale casual hybrid, the food is FAR above average, and the space is beautiful. Check it out, my friends."
"This is a pretty neat place, definitely don't judge it by the Exterior...It's kinda like you're in someones house!! ""Lounge"" area in the front with a smallish bar/Dining in back area. Very clean/classy look! Liquor Dept-- I thought the ""Beer List"" was definitely lacking big time, nothing on draft either? Beers served in shitty pint glass? Bad Move.... Food on the other hand, the food rocks! They start you out with some Homemade ""Chips"" and ""Bread &Butter Pickles"" I guarantee you, these are some of the best pickles you will ever taste in your life!! Next up, tried the Cheddar/Bacon Hush Puppies--Very Flavorful with a nice sauce! Entree-- I had the Kobe Beef Brisket with Habenero Cornbread... It was awesome, nice smoke ring/very tender. Really liked the Cornbread with kind of a ""Crusty"" top. They serve all their food with their 3 different types of BBQ Sauce--Original/Spicy/Vinegar.. I liked the Spicy the best. Menu also had some ""Competition"" style slabs of ribs that are prepared in limited batches as if in Competition... I wanna go back and try those for sure! Great staff and the girls are dressed up in cute little flannel outfits!!  P.S-- Great little ""Private Lounge"" Area upstairs-GREAT SPACE for a ""Meeting""or ""Group"", not sure what it takes to get up there..GTFJD"
"Let's see, I LOVE Barbeque.  I make it, I eat it, I LOVE it.  Was very skeptical of an ""upscale"" joint, but will definitely give this place a second look.  Brisket was on point, as was the mac and cheese, cornbread and  the smoked wings.  Non-competition ribs were so so, but was so blown away by the brisket that maybe I didn't give them a enough of a chance.  Nice bourbon selection as well and very  nice presentation to boot.  Going back to try the competition ribs...or may just stick to the brisket because...did I mention I loved the brisket?"
"Had a business dinner there ( 8 people) and everyone loved it.  Nothing better than Red Hooks and good BBQ.  Great food Good prices. My go to place until I find the next one. Wings and Shrimp and Grits appetizer was fantastic - Also had the brisket and ribs which where awesome. Had the meat sweats later, but it was worth it. I could see this as a really good guys night out place or good for groups who are not on diets...."
"My boyfriend insisted that I give Q one last chance, and I am glad we did.  I had previously complained about problems with their service, but they have hit their stride.My reservation was found immediately and we were seated right away.  The waiter came and took drink orders within 5 minutes.  Excellent.  The waiter was able to give a wine recommendation, and drink arrived promptly.I like that they give you pickles and chips to nibble on.  The first thing we noticed is that the chips have gotten so much better.  They are packed with spicy barbeque flavor.  It is a great first impression of the food.As others have noted, Q isn't a traditional BBQ joint. It is more like a steakhouse both in atmosphere and presentation.  The sides are a la carte, and it has a much classier decor than any BBQ place I have previously been to.  So know what you expect.I ordered an appetizer as my main course.  I chose the BBQ trio which has tastings of the pulled pork, pulled chicken, and bbq kobe brisket.  The three signature sauces are on the side.  It is definitely a solid amount of food, and a fun way to try a little of everything.My boyfriend got the q2, which is an insane amount of food, yet he ate most of it. He is a fan of the ribs, which is how he got me to give the place another try.  I like to steal the spicy fries that are on the side.For sides we got the greens and mac and cheese.  Personally, I am not into greens, but my boyfriend and friends like Q's quite a bit.  The mac and cheese is good, it has quite a bit of spice to it.Overall, my Q experiences have proved to me that sometimes it takes a new restaurant a little while to get going.  They have worked really hard to improve, and it shows.  These are people who really care about the quality of the service and food, and I really appreciate that.I also notice that they have prepared a large area for outdoor seating in the summer.  It looks like it is going to be great."
I had the beef brisket and was not disappointed. Meat was very tender and is supposedly cooked for 12-14 hours. Cornbread was also delicious. Hush puppies left a little to be desired and I would recommend trying a different appetizer.
"I figured I should revisit this review as I actually sat down and ate at Chicago q this time. I helped my friend move out an old couch and move in a new one on Saturday, so he said he'd take me out to dinner on Sunday and I picked this place. (Oh and when I use the word ""couch"", I'm talking about some ridiculous 3 piece monster couch. Just to set the record straight.)Anyways, upon walking into this place, my first thought was that it was much bigger than I thought it was going to be. It has a very prominent bar area in the front that is pretty well set-off from the dining area in the back part of the restaurant. The dining area is pretty open, with a large window into the kitchen. There's also a staircase in the center that leads to an upstairs dining area? I wasn't fancy enough to go up there though. Most everything is made of dark wood and the atmosphere is semi-casual, semi-fancy. One weird part, in my opinion, was the very large, two-story, back-lit picture of a gloomy day in the country. Why so large? Why so gloomy?? Overall though, the place has a classier feel to it, which you might think is weird for a BBQ place. It really isn't, especially once you sit down and are focused on your giant rack of ribs.We were seated and we started ordering. We got the cheddar/bacon hush puppies. They were good, but I didn't taste much cheddar and I didn't taste any bacon at all. The dipping sauce they came with was delicious though. We used the excess for our complementary (kettle?) chips. Soon, we all ordered the ""q2"". Between us we had pretty much everything: ribs, pulled pork, chicken, brisket. I had the baby back ribs and pulled pork. All delicious. This place has very good ribs. The pulled pork was the best of the non-rib meats, in my opinion. They also supply 3 different BBQ sauce, and I think they changed out the third and worst sauce from last time I had takeout with a better new one, so that was good.At the end, my friend paid and we walked out. On the way past the hostess desk, I was about to put my moves on the pretty, Winona Ryder-in-Beetlejuice-eque hostess, but right then we were chased down by our mustached waiter (a lot of waiters here had mustaches). He asked us if ""everything was alright"" because apparently my friend forgot to put the tip down. Super embarrassing. I knew I shouldn't have let him handle the bill... plus he blew my chance with Winona. Oh well, next time?"
"As I write this I feel bad for the experiences that Gary and Alan had because our lunch experience today was nothing shy of fantastic.  Trying to figure out a way to go back for dinner tonight-- it was THAT good!The reviews above are accurate and well describe the experience.  From our perspective, you really want to go when you are in a mood to enjoy and take your time.An upscale place, they will let you have all the time you want, so begin by enjoying the gourmet potato chips and pickles that they put on each table.  Both are very good.  I highly recommend the smoked dry-rubbed chicken wings.  They have outstanding smoke flavor, a great sauce, and are perfectly done.  You can nearly make a meal just on these, yet the order is perfect for two people to split.Their pulled pork is fantastic and made me a fan with the first bite.  It has a wonderful flavor and is very tender and juicy while having nice bits of char.  This is what I'll order again next time I go---keep the menus.I also highly recommend the corn bread as an option or as your side if they ask.  It is moist, creamy, sweet, and has the perfect texture.  Really a nice well done item.Service is excellent and very personal.Can't wait to return!"
"Never going back!  First we had to wait a half hour for our table. There is nowhere to stand while waiting and impossible to get to the bar. I was bounced around like a pinball by the wait staff going back and forth. We were finally seated in a ice cold room up front. We were so far from the kitchen that our food was cold. The BBQ sauce is a joke. Tastes and looks like it is poured out of a bottle from the grocery store. My sandwich was cold and full of fatty meat that I had to keep spitting out, cornbread looked good but had zero taste. We complained but nothing was Q's fault. They gave us some disgusting cookies that I swear had BBQ sauce cooked in them???  Pretty disappointing considering the price. Not going back"
"We went to Chicago Q today (opening day) at around 3:30 pm.  The exterior is understated and easy to miss, look up for the big Q between Il Mulino and Starbucks.We started with the complimentary sweet and crunchy bread and butter pickles, and then had the hush puppies, the sampler trio (chicken, pulled pork, kobe beef brisket), and the full rack of competition style St. Louis ribs.  Everything was super delicious, but the 2 things that we thought were simply AMAZING were the kobe brisket and the competition ribs.  The brisket had a great smoky flavor, and was tender and juicy whilst maintaining a beefy texture (we like the brisket at Smoque, but the texture of that brisket is a bit too soft).  The ribs.....I can't even begin  to describe how absolutely perfect they were.  Really great smoky flavor, extremely tender and juicy on the inside, with a slightly sweet mapley glaze on the outside.  The three sauces are also really good.  There's a spicy, a mild, and a vinegary Carolina one.  We didn't have room for dessert after eating all that food, but the menu looked great and I'm going to try to save some room next time!Definitely go and check out Chicago Q, you won't regret it!"
"The service is impeccable!  When going to a bbq restaurant, the last thing in mind concerns service but they were so attentive from every aspect: offering refills to the sweet potato chips to bread and butter pickles, always filling the water glass, and even noticing the white linen napkin shedding on my bf's suit, they gave him a dark napkin instead.  We are so pleased with everything this place has to offer.  We love bbq and waited to try this place since we had other favorites in town, but honestly, this place blew us away and we plan on returning often! The portions are generous and every bite is mouthwatering.  We ordered the Hush Puppies, Kobe brisket sandwich and their brunch special: pulled chicken benedict, everything was so delicious, words just cannot describe.  This place is highly recommended."
A ton of coleslaw comes with the brisket
"Hosted an event at Chicago q last night.  The food, staff, and assistance in planning could not have been better.  Thanks Chicago q."
"Great BBQ in Chicago! I went for a work event, and we started with the shrimp & grits and hush puppies, they were both delicious. Then I had the sliced kobe brisket which was amazing... the cornbread is delicious too!  My friend got the half smoked chicken and I tasted some, it was delicious as well.  We got the Mac & Cheese on the side, and it was incredible - could have had that as a meal! We were too full for dessert. They did a great job, though I wish they had draft beers. Also, our server mumbled and it was hard to understand what he was saying, though he was really helpful and gave good advice.  Great, great BBQ north of the Mason Dixon line."
"I wish I could give three and a half stars. The restaurant does a great job of dressing up down home food, but its not as though the food itself is amazing."
"Went to q over the weekend for dinner with my husband and parents.  It was a Sunday night and the place was pretty full.  The restaurant did not look at all like I expected for a BBQ place.  It was airy, somewhat open and elegant...a very nice atmosphere.We started with the onion rings, which were decent... not too greasy, with a touch of heat.  They offer a BBQ flight that includes 3 different meats and sauces.  We didn't try it, but will definitely get it the next time.We all ordered ribs.  They have baby back and St. Louis...we all had St. Louis.  The ribs are available ""competition"" style or regular style.  The competition style costs more and is available on a limited basis and as a full slab only.  The regular ribs are available in a full or half slab.  We tried both and wouldn't say one is necessarily better than the other... they are just different.  The competition style falls off the bone, whereas the regular style doesn't.  The flavor was also a little different.  I'd probably get the regular style again, as the extra cost of the competition didn't seem worth it to me.  The ribs came with 4 different sauces - regular, hot, vinegar and mustard. The hot isn't THAT hot, but does have a nice, comfortable heat that builds.  The vinegar was good, as was the mustard.  I didn't try the regular. The cornbread is BIG and yummy.  We tried both the honey butter and the jalepeno cheddar.  The one disappointment of the meal was the baked beans side dish.  The beans were way too sweet.    Overall, q is a solid addition to the seemingly ever-growing BBQ scene."
"My husband and his friends love barbecue, so we were very excited to hear that CHICAGO Q was opening in the Gold Coast. They consider themselves barbecue experts as they are all from Kansas City, so I was eager to know how they'd like the place.  From the street, Chicago Q is so cute. It's painted brick with a great Southern vibe. it reminds me a lot of Table Fifty-Two, but not quite as dressy/upscale.  We were excited from the looks of it. Upon entering Chicago Q, we saw the beautiful bar. With the white crown molding and butter yellow walls, the style was right up my alley. It was so cutely decorated. The deep mahogany wood bar definitely dressed up the bar area. We had a drink and had great service, despite the bar area being packed with people coming to check it out. We were seated right on time to our 7:30 Saturday night reservations - very unheard of in Chicago. Next up, the meal. We started with cocktails (**The wine list wasn't great, so we stuck with cocktails) and ordered the barbecue teaser platter as starters. This was a great way to try all of the different meats prior to ordering - as well as the sauces. Once we tried this, we all ordered our main course. I split the trio of meat with my husband (1/2 slab of Kobe Baby Back Ribs; Pulled BBQ Chicken and Kobe Beef Brisket). This was served with 3 sides of BBQ sauce, all of which were so great!  We ordered the Mac and Cheese on the side as well as cornbread and also loved them.  The Mac and Cheese is out of this world!!!!!  We didn't try the St. Louis Ribs, which were recommended by the server - but I don't like my ribs with a lot of fat, so chose the Baby Back instead and really enjoyed them.  We also got a special visit from the chef of the restauran, Lee Ann Whippen. She was so nice and came to our table to talk about the restaurant concept and make sure we enjoyed our meal.  Overall, we are really excited to go back.  It's a great vibe and also great food.  I highly recommend this restaurant for big groups, parents in town, out-of-town guests or anyone that likes barbeque."
"YUMMO!  Walking up to the restaurant, the smell of good ol' wood burning BBq filled the air.  The atmosphere inside was nice and cozy, as if I was walking into someone's cottage.  The BBq Flight of Kobe Brisket, Pulled Pork and Pulled Chicken was super tasty and the Baby Back Ribs and sweet cornbread were delish!  Next time I go back, I will try not to load up on the pickles and homemade chips they bring out when seated.  The milk and cookies dessert was a great way to end a very satisfying BBq feast.  The staff were very friendly and I look forward to dining here again soon."
"This was the first time Yelpers had led me astray.  My wife and I where walking through the streets of Chicago.  Being tourists, I looked up a place nearby with a great review and I found Q.  Ordered a sampler and the meat was a little dried out, especially the beef The Hush puppies were dry.I will say their dipping sauces are second to none.  In hindsight, I would have prefered to drink the sauces straight!!  Mac n Cheese was good and the sweet pickles were a nice meal start."
"This place will leave you breathless. As in, you'll be out of breath from scarfing down your plate, your friend's plate, and your friend's friend's plate. And don't forget to pig out on the pickles and chips. So good!Only down side was that they didn't pack the BBQ sauces in our doggy bag so leftovers weren't as good."
"We dined here yesterday for lunch as part of Restaurant Week.  My first impression:  Lovely, lovely white dining room and bar that was very welcoming and warm!  Love the attention to detail-  fireplace, computer for orders in the bar dining room was hidden in a cabinet, and the chips and pickles that were complimentary prior to the meal.  Service was excellent, helpful, and attentive.  Parking was easy in front on the street (not likely to be the case on evenings or weekends).Favorites:  Hush puppies (sooooo delicious), mac and cheese (husband loved this).  Brisket---love the spices/crust and the fact that it could be cut with a fork.  The pablano corn bread was yummy, especially slathered with butter.Decent:  The St. Louis ribs were OK but better with the house made sauce slathered on them.  The chicken wings had a nice smokey flavor.We got two desserts to go and have yet to try them!  Can't wait!We will be back!"
"With 4 other adults and 2 tots in tow, we headed to Q for lunch last Saturday for restaurant week.We had the hushpuppies, onion rings, kobe brisket, kobe brisket sandwich, pulled pork, st. louis style ribs, carrot cake, key lime pie, and milk/cookies.I understand that they want to be considered an upscale bbq place, but there are no free refills on soda pop.  It comes in little tiny bottles which was a disappointment and a little pretentious.Everything was overall pretty tasty, A-OK.  The sliced Kobe brisket tasted significantly different from the kobe brisket sandwich.  The sliced brisket tasted like your standard brisket, nothing that special.  The sandwich had little cubes of kobe beef that were very flavorful so definitely skip the sliced brisket if you go.I will return because I want to try the competition style ribs that have special seasoning and are ""made for competitions.""  Plus they are limited in supply which makes them even more intriguing to me...but for $35+ per slab, I'll have to budget some extra money for them.  Maybe next month?"
"A nice, tasty, inexpensive place in the Gold Coast. Good place for a group of guys to go watch a game as well- they have several tables in a rotunda with tvs."
"Just tried Chicago q for the first time last night.I would definitely come here again. Standouts include the bbq chips and sweet pickles that others have mentioned. Delicious. The bourbon ""flight"" was also an outstanding deal if you're a bourbon fan.My wife got the pulled pork shoulder which was outstanding. I got the Kobe beef ribs which were just so-so. Although they had great flavor, they were not ""falling off the bone"" as advertised. Pretty tough actually, but still quite tasty.I have to say I was underwhelmed by all four sauces. My favorite was probably the mustard-based sauce, which is a tough one to find at most BBQ joints, so if you're a fan of that type of sauce, Chicago q may be your mustard mecca.My only other point of contention is that when I asked them to package up my leftovers, they failed to include a whole Kobe beef rib which was untouched on my plate. At over $35 for this entree, this felt like a pretty big rip off for them to not include a third of my entree in the ""doggy bag."" (Of course I didn't discover this until the next morning when I unpacked the bag.)As I said I would go again. But next time I think I'd stick to a more traditional pork rib, and double check that all leftovers are actually in the bag before I leave!"
"BBQ Heaven! Do family style so that you can try a little bit of everything. Here's what you need to have: BBQ ribs - St. Louis Style, Kobe sliced brisket, and pulled chicken. Skip the corn bread and get the baked beans! We were even too full to eat dessert, and we were with the man who always gets desserts. They were also very gracious about giving us a tour of their smoker where the magic happens!One side note - if you make a reservation, it doesn't actually mean that your table is ready on time. What it means is that you move to the top of the wait list and will be seated at the next available table. We also had some issues with the host being able to tell us approximately how long we would have to wait - or anything at all. But we didn't let that get in the way!"
"ummm, amazing. enough said."
"Great BBQ with an upscale flair! We tried pretty much everything - mac and cheese, beens, fries, ribs, slaw, briscuit, etc.  It was all very good!  Well prepared, tasty and service was good.  As far as Chicago BBQ goes, I'd rank this up there with Smoke & Smoke Daddy - it's a wonderful fancier option to those Chicago BBQ staples.  And not terribly expensive."
"Chicago Q is absolutely delicious!  They bring an unexpected bit of southern charm to the Gold Coast.  When I walked in I felt like I had entered the home of Paula Deen.  The restaurant is very warm, welcoming and home-like.  I'd call it upscale bbq, but guests were dining in attire of all types from professional business attire to jeans and tennis shoes.  The servers were very attentive and friendly. Now onto the food.  Oh my gosh, yum!  They started by giving us homemade pickles and chips, which are included as free starters.  I ordered smoked chicken, which by no means was your average chicken.  It was very flavorful and served with three homemade bbq sauces.  My friend enjoyed 1/2 slab of St Louis style ribs, which were some of the most tender ribs I've tasted.  We enjoyed cornbread and mac and cheese as sides.  This mac and cheese is a brulee style served in a quaint skillet and is out of this world.      I would highly recommend making a reservation!  Q gets very busy, especially on the weekends."
"I'm lucky.  I moved in to an apartment down the street from Chicago q.  As I was setting up my furniture I looked out the window and saw the q sign.  It was getting hungry and didn't know the neighborhood yet so I ended up at q.  I'm happy I did.Immediately upon walking into the restaurant, I felt welcomed and at home.  This is a great place for groups and families.  The dining room accommodates large parties and the much of the menu is fantastic for sharing.  I absolutely love the pickles and freshly fried potato chips you get upon sitting down.  So yummy. I often get full off of these before my real food arrives.  I also love their drink menu, especially their whiskey flights.  I've been here enough times that I've tried a big portion of their menu.  So far I have yet to be disappointed.  Of course I would recommend getting some bbq- smoked chicken, pulled pork, or ribs- they are all good.  And if you can't decide, you should get the bbq flight appetizer.  I had that on my first visit with my boyfriend and it was delicious.Oh, and the cornbread.  I love carbs. I prefer the savory poblano cheddar cornbread over the honey butter one they normally serve you.  Be sure to ask for the poblano one instead, or try to ask for both!"
"I stumbled upon q while walking around in the Gold Coast recently. Intrigued by the exterior, I went inside to grab a menu. I returned tonight for dinner and now sit here, stuffed to the brim, with a smile on my face, while writing this review. The atmosphere and ambiance is cool - modern rustic. Staff in khakis and checkered dress shirts. They start the meal off with complimentary pickles and potato chips - just delicious, especially paired together. I had the pulled pork shoulder with cornbread and my BF had the q2, which consisted of brisket and a half rack of ribs. We also ordered the kobe beans and seasonal squash for sides. They bring you three different sauces for the table. I was blown away by the pulled pork, tender and succulent. The cornbread was also tasty. Even though I knew I should have stopped, it was just too good not to finish. I had a taste of the brisket and ribs, which were also delish. Those beans can't be beat. We did (embarrassingly) have dessert too and went with an espresso ice cream topped with peanut brittle, yum. The staff was VERY attentive. Our water glasses were refilled as soon as we took a few sips. The server was always ""present."" A manager even stopped by to ensure everything was ok. Yes, I will agree with others that the price will keep us from being regulars ($80 for all of the above plus three beers). We did expect this going into it though... But, it's a place we'll come back to some Friday night and bring family or visitors to. I hope this one sticks around!"
"I love me some BBQ and this place lives up to the hype.  We came here for restaurant week and holy sh*t they do not skimp on the prix fixe meal!!!  They put out these awesome chips and pickles to start.  For apps we went with the bbq sampler which is a meal in itself with 3 types of meat and big hunks of corn bread.  The lemon shrimp were huge and there were like 6 of them....the grilled polenta was just ok.  The full slabs of ribs were massive and I could barely finish half....although they weren't my favorite ribs ever.  We were with another couple who knew the GM so we got some extra desserts which put us all over the edge but YUM were they good....carrot cake, key lime cobbler and some espresso ice cream cake.  The service was pretty slow but since it was a busy Friday night and the first night of Rest Week I'll give them another shot.  Having slow service was probably a good thing anyway since we were stuffed after every course......my jeans were unbuttoned before the ribs were even served."
"Took my Dad for Father's Day.  We had a reservation and we still waited an extra half hour to sit because the kitchen was backed up.  Once we got seated, the dining room was not even that full.  The food was actually good and they gave you a lot of it.  I had the brisket, ribs and chicken.  Cole slaw and cornbread was good too!  I would certainly order take out the next time I go to avoid the wait."
"I'm not a huge BBQ person, but after a suggestion by a friend, I decided to check Chicago Q out. To start off, I really liked the classy, yet ""down-home"" atmosphere. The place is lively and fun, even at 5:30. We loved the bread and butter pickles and BBQ chips waiting on the table when we arrived! One of my favorite dishes was the BBQ Lemon Shrimp and Grits appetizer. The shrimp and grits were cooked perfectly; definitely a 5 star dish. The baby back ribs fell off the bone and had a very smoky flavor. We also tried the trio of meats, which I would recommend for an appetizer so you can have a ""taste"" of the different meats they offer. It came with 4 different BBQ sauces, and it was fun to sample the different styles. I thought the cole slaw could use more flavor; it was a bit bland. The corn bread had a good taste, but it was a tad dry-I've had better. The milk and cookies for dessert had good flavor but would have been a lot better if warmed up! Service was very attentive, and I would definitely go back. I'm excited to try more of their dishes!"
"Chicago Q is an interesting take on BBQ in a very comfortable restaurant in downtown. While the dining area is very well decorated and the service was very good on my visit there, the food is still a work in progress so I couldn't give Chicago Q more than 3 and a half stars.I have only been once so I haven't tried as many items on the menu as I would like. Once you are seated you are treated to a bowl of pickles and potato chips. The pickles are great and I destroyed the bowl quickly. The potato chips were good too but I felt needed a bit more seasoning.To start I had the BBQ flight and the Kobe brisket was the best out of the 3 items. The pulled Pork and pulled Chicken was pretty boring. I got a side of the cornbread and it was very good. It crumbled apart very easily but had great flavour. The different sauces that came with the appetizers were very good also.The smoked dry rubbed Chicken wings are great and easily the best Chicken wings in Chicago. For our main course, we tried the St Louis half slab and this unfortunately wasn't as good as Smoques St Louis Ribs. The fries that you get also aren't as good as Smoques, they are less seasoned and just don't taste as good.I had to rush to make an appointment so unfortunately we couldn't try anything else on the menu. Chicago Q is worth a visit and I expect on my next visit there to be rewriting this review and giving it 4 stars."
"I recently vacationed in chicago and of all the places I tried (including purple pig) this was my favorite. Keep in mind I dont have much experience with southern cooking but this place was great. The food and vibe of the joint was cool. I got a total southern society feel about the place and there was a def a 50:1 white people to nonwhite people, me being the 1. Anyways the food and alcohol choices were great and my only qualm was that the mac n cheese was average. Make sure to order a drink from their whiskey/bourbon list, its a trip."
"great lunch during restaurant week! hush puppies - good and crispychicken wings - the best! need more!beet salad - goodpickled cucumber - the reason why i keep on coming back!brisket - yum!!! tender and juicyribs - ok, slightly burnt but tendercornbread - too crumblycarrot cake - the best in the city!still the best!"
"Very nice inner decor and the outside of the building looks so adorable. Food : it is not as expensive as you think. And also, the food is not as very delicious as you think. Service: should be better. When I book a table by phone, they told me in a very strict way that your group of people have to be there within 15 minutes according to the reservation time; when I ask them to take a group picture, they just press the button and go; and when we still have a friend on the way, they always rush us to order food. Should make a reservation one week early if you have a group of people."
Great comfort food!!!! Excellent service :) I'll definitely come back to this place when I'm in Chicago
We went to q for the first time 2 weekends ago and absolutely loved it.  The service was amazing and we especially loved the spicy bbq sauce.  We tried 3 of their appetizers and enjoyed the chili and the bbq tasting the most.  Our waiter had excellent recommendations.  I had the 2 entree combo of ribs and their pork belly sausage (special for the night).  They were both really good.  The four of us had a great time - we liked the service and the food so much that my fiance and I are considering this place for our rehearsal dinner!
"Initial impressions at a recent lunch here: Nice space, friendly service, extensive menu, high prices. I was a bit turned off by the two different levels of ribs (regular and competition style); are they saying the regular is just okay? The waiter explained it that the competition style takes longer and has some additional ingredients, but that was odd. Nonetheless, once the meal began, I was confirmed as a fan. They start you with some pickles and chips, which is nice to whet your appetite. Service was fast (got baby backs and St. Louis--not competition style!), which was much appreciated at lunch. Bottom line is these are the best quality and best tasting ribs you'll find anywhere near downtown. Plump, tender meat, nicely seasoned, plus good choice of three sauces. Cornbread on the side was a bit above average. While the prices are a bit high, that is to be expected for the location, and the quality of the food and of the place itself more or less justify the prices. My only real complaint was the lack of extra napkins, which can cause some issues if you like sauce. All in all, a very nice addition to the area and a good place to get your barbecue fix. I look forward to returning for lunch and to trying for dinner."
"I love this place. We had our rehearsal dinner here and it was a huge hit! The food is amazing, the service was great, and the price was definitely right. Also, the tasting--so much fun! The event coordinator was helpful, but let's face it, this place is all about the food. Yum!"
"Came here with a few people from our bridal party the day before our wedding - we were staying at a nearby hotel (my husband-to-be at the time, and I have been here once before, our bridal party hadn't)! After all the planning and stress, we just wanted some good food - and Chicago q definitely delivered.  We made reservations last minute and they were able to accommodate us 10mins after I called, for 8 people (Thursday evening).  The staff was very friendly and recommend great drink options that paired great with our entrees (we mostly each ordered ribs and steak).  The different sauces each provide a unique taste to the meat, all great in their own way!  Portions were big, so it's definitely enough to share if you wanted to.  Everyone enjoyed the food and was hyped for the following day."
"This was our favorite restaurant that we dined at during restarant week. Fabulous food, great service and an overall excellent experience. To begin they bring you some of their delicious homemade bread/butter pickles which were addictive and some homemade potato chips that were seasoned with what dry rub rib seasoning that gave it a great sweet and spicy flavor. Our appetizers were excellent (cheddar bacon hushpuppies and BBQ wings). I had the Kobe brisket which was tender and divine accompanied by a huge slab of cheddar poblano cornbread. My fiance' had a half slab of baby back ribs which fell off the bone. For dessert Carrot Cake and Key lime pie.. we walked out stuffed... Definitely a spot we will go to again."
"Q was pretty damn awesome - the kobe brisket was incredible - the corn bread was great - hush puppies were perfect - st. louis style ribs - perfect and with 4 sauces. mac cheese was good not great - greens were excellent.... and on and on and on.... place was packed out. i'm not a huge bbq lover but man, they got it right..."
"My husbands law firm had their x-mas party here, cute place, they had the room upstairs, which was nice. Its a nicer bbq place and the place is very nice, looks like a home from the outside! Very cute!I am not really into BBQ food, and I usually get a veggie meal and I had the most amazing pasta dish here! It was soooooooo good, very flavorful, served hot not room temperature, usually if you order a veggie meal it sits under a heat lamp and its usually a bland pasta dish! I did have some of the sides, mac and cheese was good, not amazing but good, acorn squash was good, I am not a big fan of squash that is sweet, but it was good, and I think we had a 3rd side and I cant remember what it was. I did like the salad. The drinks are whiskey based-their specialty drinks are I should say, they were good but I do like a vodka based martini vs whiskey.Oh and the shrimp with the lemon grits was pretty good too, that was one of the apps.Fro dessert there was a choc mousse tart, which was good but the bottom tart part was thick and hard to get into with your fork."
"Best BBQ in the city!  OMG, everything was amazing!  Upon sitting down, we were served homemade bread and butter pickles and potato chips . . . both delicious!I highly recommend sharing because you get to taste everything and the portions are large.  We started with the hominy Salad (Smoked Corn, Black Beans, Avocados).  It was amazing (the theme for all of the food).  Even the half portion was hard to finish. U know what they say, life's an entree. . .We had the Q 3 for our entree . . . baby-back ribs, pulled pork and brisket.  For sides, we had cornbread and mac and cheese.  All the meats were dry-rub so you don't need sauce, but who can resist bbq sauce . . .  right?Overall, I was extremely satisfied.  I keep thinking about the food and it has been three days (that also could be because I started a 5-day juice cleanse the next morning and I haven't had solid food since).Don't get me wrong, Smoke Daddy and Smoque are good, but Q is by far the best!"

"The best part of the Holiday season= work Holiday party. Let's start off with the looks of this place. It's super cozy and everything I love in a place. I felt like I was walking into someone's old home in the south, like straight out of Paula Dean's show or something. Our party was upstairs, which is laid out a little funny, but comfortable. The servers were great, bringing non-stop drinks (which I guess ended up badly for a few of us in the end). The Passion Fruit Martini is strong! The Pimm cup is the way to go, refreshing, and crisp. We had a slew of amazing appetizers ranging from shrimp and polenta to wings. The dinner was family style and included Kobe Beef Brisket! Woah bear, so good! Overall, everything here was pretty good but I'm not too sure I would spend that much money on this type of food in the future."
"I visited right when they opened and the BBQ was better than I expected! The decor is more upscale than other BBQ joints, but it fits right in the neighborhood."
"Chicago Q blew me away. My sister and her boyfriend visited Chicago for the first time and a friend of hers recommended it to us. God bless, it was some of the best BBQ I've had anywhere. The ambiance and service were as good as it gets. I want to go back and hang out in the upstairs area with the leather couches and big screen. I'm also seriously interested in returning for brunch. Splendid evening!!!"
"Move over Smoque, Chicago Q is now my favorite BBQ in Chicago.  Though the decor was confusing (a little upscale, a little sports bar, a little call back to old school bbq joints) the food was amazing.  We started with the Bacon Hush Puppies which were amazing.  We then ordered two meats plus a half slap of ribs.  The pulled pork was terrific and the sauce for it was amazing.  The brisket was really good as well.  The only think we thought was just average were the baby back ribs (non competition).  The meat fell off the rib way to easy.  Next time we go we will make sure to get the competition style ribs."
"It was good, didn't know bbq could be so fancy :)"
"Wow.  Where to start?  How about the ""elegant"" or ""heightened"" dining experience.  Not even close.  The table was dirty with dried BBQ sauce on it.  My yet to be used small ""bread"" plate was dirty as well.  When I asked for a new one, the server simply took it away without a word and never returned with a new one.  When I payed the bill in cash, it took an inordinate amount of time to get my change.I thought that excellent BBQ would overcome the disappointment of the service.  The ribs and brisket were almost tasteless- no smoke flavor whatsoever.  And the side sauces were no help, in fact they were simply not good.I was so hopeful about this place, but now believe it is a hopeless cause."
What a lovely place to eat.  The service was amazing.  Almost the best I have had anywhere.  The food was good.  The menu was complete.   They were good.  They give you bread and butter pickles and chips as you are deciding on what to eat.  They were incredible. We started wtih the Hush Puppies as an appetizer.  Good and worth the money.  We had a q3 for lunch between 4 of us with an added portion of Kobe brisket.  Everything was amazing.  It was served with five different sauces.  We had a side of macaroni and cheese.  It was great.  The Cornbread....fabulous.  Fries...just OK.  Cole slaw was good but not outstanding.The menu is similar at lunch and dinner and the prices are very similar.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area.
"I felt like I was walking into a delicious smelling dinner party the way the host explained the place. He showed us the ""hip place to hang upstairs"" and showed us where the restrooms where, and where to hang out coats. Typically the host just shows you to your table but he took the extra step in helping our party feel comfortable.2 of us were gluten free - and the gluten free menus were quite extensive. We had pulled homemade pickles, pork with 3 types of sauce (spicy was my fav), coleslaw that we just perfectly creamy, not too much - and I was able to eat french fries because they only fry fries there, and no chance of cross contamination. what a dinner!!!Had plenty left over and the 2nd day it was just as good!"
"I came here on New Year's Eve with a group of 12, and we rented the Octagon Room, which was lovely.  The room itself was perfect for us, and they arranged it as one big table so that everyone could see and talk to each other. We did a family style dinner so that we all got to taste a bit of everything.  The food was excellent.  The oysters, alligator, and shrimp and grits stood out in the appetizers, and the variety of sauces for the barbecue made sure everyone was happy.  The only problem was that there was TOO much food, but they brought us boxes, and we took home tons of leftovers. Drinks were also wonderful with a good assortment of cocktails (the pins and needles is great), beer, and wine.  Our server (who was wonderful from beginning to end) even let us know when we hit the minimum, which was towards the end of our meal so it definitely wasn't an outrageous amount.  Overall the food, atmosphere, and service were top notch.  I highly recommend Chicago Q and especially the Octagon Room if you have a group."
The ambiance and service alone redeem Q five stars. They have brought fine dining to Southern BBQ.
"If you like barbque you must try q.  Had the Kobe brisket and enjoyed every second of it.  Although the meat was slightly dry, I greatly enjoyed the selection of sauces that come with the entrees; spicy BBQ was my fave!  If you are not into bourbon try the patron margarita, it was delish.  Don't be fooled by locatin and exterior of q; it's huge inside!  Also reservations are strongly encourage for dinners after 7pm."
"Last night was my second time there. My first time was magical - it was 8pm on a Friday night, the place was back-to-back packed, candlelight brought in an air of mystery, and my party of 8 ordered nearly everything on the menu. So I was extremely excited to go back. This time we ordered the bbq flight as an appetizer, the house salad, half slab of ribs, and the mac & cheese. But before I delve into the foods we ordered, I first have to comment on the free chips and pickles. I never liked pickles. Until I had these pickles. I couldn't have enough. The chips are also fantastic and seasoned so well. The bbq flight is nice, as you get to try all the different types of meat. The house salad was also delicious - I was impressed by the attention to detail - the subtlety of the dressing, the smoking of the grape tomatoes, the seasoning of the salad. But my favorite dish all night was the mac & cheese. I am a big fan. The breaded, caramelized goodness caused me to eat over my stomach's capacity, but I enjoyed every bite. I'd highly recommend this place, with its reasonable prices and tasty food."
"This ain't your hole in the wall bbq joint so if you're looking for wet ones on the table and plastic baskets of some ribs, go elsewhere.  What Chicago Q is all about is quality barbeque in a beautiful setting.  Now, some people may not be able to put bbq in a higher end establishment or justify a higher price but this totally works.  The place is comfy but beautiful without being stuffy.  It is a polished restaurant with pale yellow and white beadboard walls and hosts a gorgeous front bar area.  They have transformed the old Tsunami sushi restaurant that was more loungy and dark into something unique.   You walk into the dining area that's light and airy and a wall has a large mural that looks like a giant windowpane looking out to a country road.  The complimentary southern pickles and chips were addictive while we drank a fantastic Cabernet Sauvignon (can't remember the name).  We ordered an array of items to get a feel for the place.  The competition ribs are the ribs that Chef LeeAnn Whippen won against Bobby Flay in his Throwdown show and are truly the best ribs I've ever had.  They were baby beef ribs that FELL OFF THE BONE and were not fatty whatsoever. I loved that they were dry rubbed and didn't need bbq sauce even though they served 3 homeade and delectable sauces on the table.  We also a combo platter brisket, shredded pork and the chicken.  Now, let's just say bbq is not my favorite type of restaurant to frequent but these dishes were simply mouth watering.  The meats were seasoned beautifully and just the most tender ever.I'm a huge veggie fan so we ordered the roasted brussel sprouts with apple and walnuts, the braised greens and just had to try the brulee mac and cheese - yes, I know it's not a veggie.  Wow!  We were again not disappointed.  Desserts were out of this world and you must try the Derby pie.  It's a decadent slice of chocolate pie with nuts, bourbon and just a beautifully done dessert with for a chocolate junkie like myself.  The cookies and milk was a nicely done dessert with a chocolate chip cookie, a sugar cookie and a chocolate and bacon cookie.  Yup!  Chocolate and bacon is just about the best combo there is for sweet and savory and this truly hit the mark.  The apple pie with caramel ice cream is probably better than your good old southern grandma's and was in a nice sugar coma after trying all three.  It's a good thing that on the way to the upstairs restroom, there's a nice comfy couch and area to chill or take a nap for an hour or two.  Would I go back?  In a heartbeat and this place made me into a bbq lover.  I hear alot of hype about a bbq place having these types of prices but again, it's not your average bbq joint.  I only wish they had more seafood items on the menu and think they only have a salmon dish listed.  I think that offering some more seafood on the menu may make it more appealing to alot of urban dwellers that just don't eat meat but love bbq.  I'm a hankerin' for some Chicago Q right now!"
"The food is good, but they don't have beers on tap?  Come on...BBQ with a beer is a staple.  Yeah, they have bottled, but tap is best.  Also - and this is picky, but who serves soft drinks in bottles?  They charge $3 for diet coke and offer no refills.  Come on - get your drinks on tap.VERY LOUD"
"Sorry bro, gonna be a downer on this one: really, really not impressed by Chicago q. 1. It didn't seem overly busy, but the service took forever. If your restaurant can seat that many people, you should be able to offer all of them service without a long wait. Oh well. 2. Hush puppies: maybe they just aren't my thing: tasted like fried cornbread. Didn't get any real ""jalapeno"" or cheddar taste. Don't think I was that drunk, so unclear where these flavors were. 3. Kobe brisket: HOW CAN YOU HAVE DRY KOBE BEEF??!! Yeah, it was dry. And not very tender. I do not understand how that is possible with Kobe beef, but there you go. Sauces were fine, nothing special. 4. Everyone is all like ""oh mac and cheese mac and cheese."" Honestly it tasted like all other mac and cheese: a creamy roux with some added cheese tossed over noodles and baked with a bread crumb topping. So yes, compared to Kraft, better, But at a place like this, nothing special. 5. Coleslaw was good. 6. Good beer selection. 7. Free pickles and chips are nice, but fill you up. So there you have it."
Chicago q is a beautiful restaurant.  It is much bigger than it looks from the street.  I had a mint julep to start.  I love the southern feel of this restaurant.   You feel like you are right at home.   I like the pickles and chips they give you as a starter. I had the ribs which were delicious!   I am not sure where else you can have BBQ in the Gold Coast.  I really like this place.
"Already on guard to the pricey and crowded new bbq place in River North, wife and I ventured over for a Sunday 2:00 lunch.  We were able to sit and enjoy a delicious meal in the very nice bar area.  The dining room seats about 150 and there is an upstairs private room that seats 60 and a nice smaller one on right off the bar that may seat 15. But heck, you are reading this to get insight on food, service, prices and our experience.  I ordered the pork shoulder sandwich about $11.  Wife ordered the kobe beef brisket, about $14.  We agreed, mine was very yummy, hers just okay.   Kobe beef is so lean that you don't enjoy the taste that only fat can bring out of beef.The three sauces offer a spicy, mild and vinegar options.  I mixed up the spicy and mild on my pork shoulder sandwich and loved it.The cole slaw, for the cole slaw snobs out there, is one of the best I've tasted in Chicago.  Finally, someone gets it!  I even ordered a pint to go.  The cornbread is moist and wonderful.  Portions are generous on all items and sides.All told, the fare was about $35 before tip.  Not too bad for some very tasty Q.  We'll definitely be back, probably resisting the $35 'competition' ribs."
"Amazing BBQ has landed downtown! I love BBQ and I always find myself driving out in the city just to find a good Pulled Pork or Beef Brisket sandwich. Chicago Q has filled a void in the culinary makeup of downtown Chicago.The decor of what used to be Tsunami (overpriced sushi) has been transformed into a space that somehow takes me out of the city and into a chic southern BBQ restaurant.Oh the Kobe brisket is wonderful, ribs just as amazing. And the entry on the menu suggesting there is better BBQ ribs for competitions? Maybe next time I'll have to decide to have BBQ 24hrs in advance...Another great experience at Chicago Q, and it will be gaining a 5 star review from me."
Went with a bigger group (6) and they accommodated us very well. We all enjoyed our meats and their sauces are spot on. The dinning area is really nice!
"Wow. I didn't know what to expect in terms of elevated bbq, but I was shocked to say the least when I walked in the front door of the beautiful Chicago Q space. Gone is the dark decor of former sushi haunt, Tsunami. In its place is white wainscoting, warm country club-esque clean lines and modern art work that made me feel as if I was sitting on someone's porch down south. The staff is equally as friendly. I hadn't realized that this was a bit of a dressy restaurant and came to dinner from some last minute grocery shopping. The hostess kindly checked my bags in coat check and I chatted up the genial bartender while I waited for my friend. Our waitress couldn't have been nicer either and happily explained the concept of the Q and her favorite items on the menu.I left completely stuffed and carrying a box of leftovers. The Pimm's Cup is refreshing and a delightful spin on a classic. Great companion to the half bbq chicken, cornbread, macaroni and cheese and bacon fritters that I feasted on. Oh, AND they give you little butter pickles and homemade potato chips when you sit down. This place is great! Leave room for dessert too (if you can) I had the chocolate Kentucky pie which was decadent.I was expecting to go in liking Chicago Q but not loving it. I came out a devoted fan. The service, the atmosphere and the food are all top notch. Welcome to the Chicago bbq scene!"
"This place was pretty good.We had BBq Lemon Shrimp and Grilled Polenta appetizer, which, as our waiter had warned us, was nothing special. I enjoyed it, but would not order it again.The pulled pork sandwich, on the other hand was quite tasty.  As were the beers that accompanied it.  My table-mates enjoyed their meals even more than I did.Our waiter was extremely helpful, patient, and friendly.  I'm not sure if it was because he works for tips or wanted to hump me, but either way, he had a strange look in his eyes."
Great atmosphere great service. When we arrived we were seated in the rotunda. The soccer game was on the television.  They give you bread and butter pickles and bbq potato chips to snack on while u wait for your food. The bbq was amazing comes with four homemade sauces. Not to mention a stylish to go bag.
"BBQ is ok.  had the ribs, pulled pork, brisket, mac and cheese and chicken sandwich......Just ok and for the price no need to return.  I am sure going for lunch wasn't a great idea but the pulled pork didn't have smoke rings and actually was chopped.  Great service and layout but these pop up BBQ places are starting to get on my nerves like the burger joints over the last few years"
"Ambiance:  I really had no idea what to expect but a dear friend suggested the place to have our ladies' night dinner and so I  was open to anything.  I was a little hard to find since the lace has one letter but the inside was beautiful! It was cozy and has a nice warm and welcoming decor.  Everyone seemed to be in smart casual but I don't think they have a dress code.  I also like the fact that they have room upstairs for private dinners and a lounge feeling outside the dining room.The Good:  everything!  I love that they offered baked chips! They were yummy! And they kept coming!  They offer big serving so the dishes can definitely be shared.  I like that they try to be innovative by introducing their own sauces - there's a sweet with a kick, their own version, and a vinegar based BBQ.  The service was pretty good and friendly and they seem to know their stuff.The bad: I wished they offered their ""competition"" version of ribs in a smaller platter for individual serving or appetizer portion.   I had the louisiana style ribs and it was a little dry and not as tender as I was expecting. Other than that, I think it's kind of on the upscale joint so it's a bit pricey. The Bottom line:  It's a new BBQ place to try to those who LOVE bbq.  It has a nice edge, drinks, some yummy ribs, as long as you're willing to stretch out your wallet."
The BBQ was decent the restaurant has a great atmosphere. It's great for kids.
"Amazing service and delicious food! My boyfriend and I took advantage of Restaurant Week and it was amazing. We had at least five people who were waiting on us, the owner came by and asked our opinions, and we had a great table. The location is also perfect with it being a block away from the Red Line. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I wasn't entirely impressed with their bbq sauces, which is saying something since they give you three different kinds. I would certainly come here again if my budget will allow it."
"Being from Texas, I was a bit skeptical about upscale bbq, but excited to try it in hopes of finding a great new restaurant in our hood.  Boy am I glad we tried it.  The place was relatively quiet for a Friday, but I can only assume that was due in large part to it being the day after Thanksgiving, and most people wisely staying home to recover from Thanksgiving day gluttony.  Not us.Completely overwhelmed by what to order for a table of 5, we contemplated the menu over 4 bowls of chips and a bowl of pickles.  Both were delicious.  The poor waitress kept offering up suggestions, none of which we ended up taking her up on...oh well.  We had the hush puppies and the onion rings...and my goodness, the onion rings were so delicious.  The hush puppies were nothing special.  For dinner, we went family style with ribs, pulled chicken, and brisket, as well as cornbread, fries, mac and cheese, and slaw.  Everything was really delicious.  I think I could do without the slaw and the fries, but the mac and cheese and cornbread were a huge hit.  For dessert, we split the pecan pie...which really was nothing to write home about.Portions aren't super large, but we had more than enough food for 5 of us.  The restaurant is really pretty inside, and the waitstaff was terrific.  Thrilled to have such a great bbq restaurant so close by!"
"Chicago q doesn't have bad food, just poorly executed BBQ.  Let me preface this review with ""I'm from Texas"".  So maybe this is phenomenal BBQ in some other style, but it'd get blown out of the water by ""average"" Texas joints.The BAD:Kobe brisket: 1. Barely any smokey flavor2. Not cooked long enough -- I'm not sure how long this was cooked, but it wasn't enough.  It was chewy and the collagen between the meat fibers was clearly very intact3. Poorly cut -- Brisket is typically cut against the grain so it falls apart, this was cut along really long fibers4. This wasn't Kobe beef -- This is just a general peeve of mine, but people throw around the word Kobe all the time when its not.  Real Kobe is generally much more well marbled, and the cuts were very leanSt Louis Ribs:Ho-hum.  Very average texture, would have liked it a little more moist, but not the worst.  The dry rub is boring, and again, same issue as the brisket... give me some smokey flavor please.Pulled pork:Brutal.  It was dry and cold when it reached us.  As if pulled far in advance and left out to dry.  Tasteless and fatless.The GOOD:Hush puppies were excellent.  Expensive fried batter can't save a review for bad BBQ for a BBQ joint though.The bread and butter pickles -- Free bread and butter pickles at the table were OUTSTANDING.  Easily the best thing that was served to us.  Sort of sad that the free pickles were the highlight.More comments:The 2 star rating is strictly for food, but the service was abysmal.  We went on Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend at 2pm.  I actually suspect our server was just having a crappy day, but he was short, unattentive, and provided dismal service.  When asked for menu help, he clearly didn't want to help and wasn't very descriptive.  Never stopped by to ask how the food was.  We flagged him down once and he rushed off as soon as he could.  Keep in mind, we were the ONLY customers in the back dining room at the time and he clearly wasn't busy.  We had some food boxes and the contents of one of boxes was spilled into the bag so we had to ask for another bag.Service quality doesn't bear on my food review.This place is going to flourish in Chicago though because there are no nearby competitors, Lincoln Park types have a lot of excess disposable income, don't know the deliciousness that is real BBQ, and are suckers for nice decor (By the way, kudos for the great looking place.  Feel like I just walked into a governor's mansion in Austin)."
"Go, its fun, unique and pretty good food.  The food they use seems much higher quality that most BBQ joints.  It was all good except for their sauces.  Not one of their sauces grabbed me and as good as the meet was, it called for sauce. It wasn't  bad but the stuff I make myself is better.The chili there is an awesome order...get it!  the wings were good too.  I liked the beans  and enjoyed all of the sides.  Service was A Plus!  We even got to see the smokers in the kitchen by the beautiful blonde owner/ chef.  I feel like the owner should be a brother missing a finger, sweating  over his craft..like at  KC""S Arthur Bryants  or LC's, but it was a nice if not telling gesture.Perfect scenario...sneak  Smoke Daddy Sauce in with you and then you would have a 5 star experience."
"My wife and I went here a couple months ago and have a reservation to go tonight with her twin sister and husband. I like bbq more than my wife does, so I'm excited to go back, because I had the pulled pork and it was great. I like that they give you a big portion so you can have it the next day too if you don't eat it all. Good cocktails and big open restaurant make for a good evening out. Close to public trans too."
"OK, we went to q expecting great BBQ. we weren't necessarily disappointed. we ordered every appetizer. that's kinda how we roll. the hush puppies were dry. yuk. the fried green tomato's. yum. the ranch they served with them was great. we got the BBQ shrimp. it was kinda hit or miss, some were too burnt. we got the flight. yum yum yum. except for the Kobe. i expected better. My hubby loved the wings. (they were pretty good.) I would recommend this place to any Southerner visiting the windy city."
"Love this place!  Though the outside remodel had me thinking it was going to be a new Greek restaurant, Q had me pleasantly surprised.  Interior feels fresh and cozy - like home, and the atmosphere is bustling with positive energy.  Food was yummy!  BBQ ribs and Ribeye steak were done perfectly and the sides (cornbread, greens, mac n' cheese, and mashed potatoes) were delish!  One downside?  If you are looking for a quieter dining experience, be sure to tell them you want to eat in the dinning area - not the bar.  We will be visiting Q again very soon!"
"Chicago Q is a decent restaurant that, in my mind, originally had the potential to be rated as a 4 star restaurant. My husband and I have been there together twice. The first time was in July when we were in town visiting before we moved here. We went to the restaurant early on a weekday for lunch and at first, we were the only people in the restaurant. The food was out of this world! I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was so juicy and delicious. The bread was pretty amazing too...especially because the juice had seeped into it. I remember thinking the mac 'n cheese and hush puppies were awesome too. The only part of the meal that I could have gone without was the cornbread. However, we still could not wait to go back once we moved to Chicago.After being here for about a month and having time to check out some other restaurants, my husband was craving BBQ the other night, so we decided to return to Chicago Q. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was pretty busy. Once we were seated, we quickly glanced over the menu since we already knew what we wanted to get. The pickles and chips were both good, just like we remembered them. That may have been the highlight of the meal...Again, I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my husband got the half chicken/half pulled pork meal. Additionally, we ordered the hush puppies and the mac' n cheese. The hush puppies were okay - not as delicious as I had remember them being and the mac 'n cheese was a let down. Both of our meals were disappointing. The pulled pork sandwich was not as special since it had zero juice. It was so dry and therefore the bread wasn't as tasty this time around either. My husband's meal lacked flavor. For dessert, I ordered the milk and cookies. I figured the cookies would have been pretty awesome, however, they were mediocre and barely warmed up. I could've gotten better cookies at Mrs. Fields at the mall. I didn't feel like they were worth the calories.All in all, I would still go back to Chicago Q at a less busy time. My husband on the other hand said that he would first search for a better BBQ place in Chicago before returning the Chicago Q. Ouch!"
We started our gluttonous restaurant week  at q and were greatly pleased. Delish ribs and cornbread-- and they brought us a small bowl of the chilli to taste even though it was not the size offered.  Amazing stuff.  The waitstaff was one of the best I've experienced.   This place is casual yet fancy at the same time.  Liked it a lot.
"Food was great!  The only thing that is making me give 4 instead of 5 is that our waiter was not very good... the atmosphere is a bit loud, and I could not hear a word he was saying because he spoke so softly.  All four sauces were great, and the food was well cooked.  Will definitely be back!"
"Meh.  I've experienced better.  Smoque, The Smoke Daddy, and Lillie's Q are all MUCH better options.  Unless I was there on an off night, this was mediocre BBQ at best.  I really, really cannot understand the four and five star ratings. I had the brisket, which lacked any sort of flavor.  For a restaurant that bills itself as a BBQ joint, this is not acceptable.  The brisket reminded me of meat my mother would prepare, and that is not a good thing.   While it appeared to be of good quality, it was tasteless and required heaps of sauce. And as for the four offered sauces - spicy, sweet mild, mustard-based, and vinegar based - they are not terrible, but they are definitely not memorable.  Also, the macaroni and cheese was incredibly bland, as was the coleslaw.   I was soo disappointed. The best parts of my meal were the pickles and BBQ chips that are placed on the table as soon as you are seated.  The service, however, was great and the drink selection is varied, but service only takes you so far.  The next time I am craving BBQ, I will likely head back over to Smoke Daddy or Lillie Q's."
"Great spot for a night out with friends as the menu and King Kong sized portions lend themselves to family style dining so don't take anyone who's going to freak if you ask to sample something from their dish!Starters:  Bacon Cheddar Puppies - not bad, but think they're better sans sauce as I found it a bit overwhelming.Mains:  St. Louis Style Ribs - very tender and fell right off the bone.  I really like how you had the option of this style or the leaner Baby Back ribs.  Pulled Pork - holy pile of meat!!  You get a ton of it and its superb.  All meats are accompanied by a selection of 4 sauces which is a novel idea, but I wish the meat itself had a little more flavor to stand on its own.Sides:  Had the asparagus and mac and cheese which were both excellent.  Orderer beware - there's really enough to feed 4 people with a side!!Drinks:  I was pleasantly surprised to see two of my favorite regional breweries represented - Capitol and Founders - and went with the Capitol Supper Club which is excellent.  Wine and cocktail selection was also well represented.Ambiance:  Cool space, felt like I slid into a Pottery Barn dining room for a bite to eat.  It is a bit loud, though, and, after being here a couple times, I would recommend trying to get a booth as it seems to cut down on some of the noise.Service:  Server was super nice and was knowledgeable about the menu.  Only knock was that she claimed the hush puppies were 'AMAZING', which I found unsubstantiated (see above).Overall:  Having lived in Nashville for a number of years, I've eaten a fair amount of barbecue throughout the south.  While I can't say Chicago q lives up to the better joints down that way, it is good enough to keep on our 'playlist' of restaurants, so we'll be back when the mood strikes for some ribs!"
"Such a good restaurant.Nice atmosphere and excellent service!We had St. Louis ribs, pulled pork sandwich + baked beans.Everything was delicious!"
"I love good BBQ, and this place is actually gourmet bbq, the way it should be. Fresh, top notch meats, and an menu to satisfy anyone that knows anything about BBQ, and enjoys St Louis, KC, and Low Country cuisine. The bar is great, and sides are mouth watering good. Certainly the best Chicago has to offer, promise you that."
"The Kobe Brisket was overdone and our server was absolutely miserable, but they saved themselves with some of the best Mac & Cheese I've ever had."
"Easily one of my top 10 favorites restaurants in Chicago. The prices are reasonable, ribs cooked to perfection, and I can't get enough of their bbq sauces.  I WILL be back!"
"Really enjoyed my lunch at Chicago qit was our lucky day as they just got their liquor licensei had a Mint Julep which was very good, my friend had a belgian style ale and he liked his as wellthe complimentary chips were one of the best chips i have ever hadthey were still warm when they arrived, perfectly light and slightly salted, what a great way to start the meal! I had the competition st louis style ribs, i love them! i don't like saucy ribs so i was very happy that i can put the sauces on them separatelythe ribs were very tender and flavorful, yummymy friend had the brisket sandwich and he loved it as wellwe split the mac and cheese and those were polished off in no timeservice was friendly, our server took the time to explain each dish to us and checked on us many timesbeautiful setting, good bbq, i would be back for more!"
"Its kind of a fresh idea on BBQ.  The service was quite good and the food was not bad,  if the price point was a little lower I would give 4 stars.A friend and I split the ""championshiop"" baby back ribs and the hush puppies.  Everything tasted pretty good but I felt like a fat fat fat man when I left.Would recommend checking the place out at least once and give it a go for yourself."
Great comfort food.
"If you're looking for some good ol' fashioned BBQ in an upscale setting, this is your place. as my first meal in Chicago, it was not a letdown. baby back ribs and spareribs were fantastic. if you're looking for the best, check out the competition-worthy ribs selection - given that extra touch in the kitchen which is on par with the same ribs that have won the chef numerous BBQ awards in the area.downstairs has a very homey, upscale vibe. if  you have a group of 6, I would advise you to book the table with the couches upstairs. very comfortable to sit in with your friends, have dinner, down some drinks, and watch the big flat screen right next to you! it's almost like going out to eat in your own living room. very cozy!"
"Chicago q's was an experience!First, the pickles and chips were amazing: usually I'm not a fan of kettle chips, but these were perfect: they didn't get stuck in my teeth for hours, as usual.I split the pulled chicken and brisket sandwich with my brother: I have to say the chicken was very juicy, I just wish it had been cooked with the barbecue sauce.  The brisket was also great: a tiny bit dry since it was cut into such small pieces, but it was still one of the best brisket sandwiches I've had.  The cole slaw (my side) was great, but they gave so much I was getting sick of it by the end: but what did I do? Started mixing barbecue sauces with it in e end to switch u the flavor: it was amazing!  The original and mustard barbecue sauces were the best: mustard not too spicy/horseradishy (which I usually think it is) and the original was just right: sweet, smokey, overall delicious.The place was very interesting on the inside: clean and neat, and had a somewhat homey feel.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant, and will definitely be going back! 5 stars!"
Tried this place last week and I left happy. Good food and decent pricing. Cant ask for much more than that.
"Wonderful Mother's Day here - great food. Not the traditional boring Mother's Day brunch buffet, rather 3 fabulous entrees to choose from or their already excellent menu. I had eggs benedict which featured delicious, tender chicken instead of ham. Service is great - when we left the bus boy wished me a Happy Mother's Day - very nice and unexpected.This is my third visit there but my first on Sunday. Glad I live in the hood, I will be back."
"AMAZING COMFORT FOOD! Not too expensive for the Gold Coast. The only thing was that it was pretty hot in the restaurant, but they were very accommodating and raised the AC. It was a little crowded and noisy, so I would go there prepared to feel a little squished, but it is totally worth it!"
If you aren't getting ribs...go to smoque or another great BBQ option.  This is high priced and mediocre- good sides but below average meats. When busy- service struggles.
"Honestly, we are too full to write a proper review, but I wanted to make sure I get a couple of notes in. Very cute restaurant, two blocks from our hotel (PUBLIC). We made a reservation on OpenTable, and were seated right away. Water was offered within a couple of minutes and our server was at our table right behind the water. Ayana was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the food menu. My fiance had the kobe brisket sandwich and I had the pulled pork. Both were great, and tons of food.My only advice would be to have the servers learn a little more about the beer menu. We wanted local beers and ended up with one from CA (where we live) and one from Michigan....I think this was the best BBQ I have ever had!!!"
"We placed an order for pick up an were told it would be ready in twenty minutes.  We showed up in thirty minutes and the hostess was completely clueless about our order.  She first brought me the wrong ticket, then she said the order must be under the wrong name. Then she disappeared for a few minutes (likely taking so long because of her sky high heels) and brought back our handwritten order.  It was very clear to me that they never put the order in the system, but the hostess never explained the delay or apologized.  After another ten minutes of waiting, she brought me my bill and disappeared for a while again.  The next time I saw her I asked how long it would be and she said she was just going to the kitchen to bag it up for us.  Ten minutes later (now almost an hour since we placed our order) she brought us our bag.  The ticket stapled to the bag said IN HOUSE-ON THE FLY, confirming that they forgot us entirely.  We were very disappointed that we didn't get an explanation or apology for the problem.That being said, the food was OUTSTANDING.  I was very sad about our initial experience because everything we ate was wonderful.  I enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich with a massive piece of corn bread and my husband got the q2 with pulled pork and ribs with fries.  We also ordered a side of cole slaw and greens.  The cole slaw was average but the greens were outstanding.Pros:  The taste of the food, they cut the ribs for us, the barbecue sauce is delicious.Cons:  Take-out service needs some tweaking and the place was LOUD.We'll try it again, but they've lost a few points with us."
"I so wanted to love this place more than I did.  The decor is very nice and the service was attentive.  I like barbecue, but maybe I'm just not a connoisseur.  It was good solid comfort food, but I wasn't blown away.  I admit, I did love the pickles just a bit too much!The Bacon and Cheddar Hush Puppies were decent.  And I enjoyed my Pulled Chicken (super tender!) and Pork Shoulder entree.  However, my friend's Brisket might have been a better choice for me."
"Ask for Rachel as your server!  She was awesome and added to the entire dinner experience.  We had a great time, the food is bomb and the best is it's totally reasonable.  $12 for enough pulled pork to last you a dinner and following lunch.  You can't eat for less $ in the Gold Coast.  Great value, cool atmosphere, I give it 4 stars"
Ok so after reading a bunch of reviews here I couldn't wait to try this place out.1. After being a little late for our reservation we were greeted with a snotty attitude and stuffed to a secluded seat upstairs2. The stuff about meat falling off the bone? I'm not sure we ate at the same restaurant.3. Brisket was dryThe only good was:1. Our server--she was nice2. Pickle appetizer--This was nice.
"This place threw my date and myself for a loop. High end snootie bbq...?! Is that a pair...?Well food was goooood, nice decor and VERY attentive service. Almost too attentive. We must of had 5-6 different staff members check on our meal experience.  From the busboy, waterguy, server, wine dude, manager,  etc. etc. checking numerous times throughout our meal.Overall really nice experience. Gotta go back for the hominy app. Drinks were just that right amount of strong to take that edge off.  Will definately return, just gotta save some scratch cause it can get pricey if you do a meal from soup to nuts."
"Excellent service, food and drinks.  I enjoyed trying the sauces.  Very good pork and chicken.  I also noticed that they have great rooms for larger parties (like a bachelor's party for instance)."
"ugh, i live in california & i crave this place ALL THE TIME! hands down, my favorite restaurant i dined at while on my vacation in chicago (back in March 2012). it's pretty pricey but the food is worth it. i love their mac & cheese, ribs, pickle slices!, bbq chips, etc. i can't remember what else we ordered, but we didn't hesitate to clear the table at all. the food in chicago, i thought, was pretty mediocre & so i was so happy that this place ended up being our last spot before leaving for home the next morning. can't wait to go back!! service was excellent!!"
"Dined here last night with my aunt and girlfriend. Can honestly say that I spent most of yesterday afternoon reading every review under the sun about this place, and based on all the 5-star ratings I was excited to check how BBQ on the Gold Coast stacked up. Having had my share of excellent BBQ (St. Louis, KC, Memphis, Texas), I can come off as a bit of a snob. Hey, I disclosed it in advance.We each ordered an entree then did sides a la carte.Pickles and Potato Chips - FREE, endless, and addicting! These were a stellar way to start the mealPork Shoulder/Pulled Chicken - tender, slightly smokey (not enough, IMO), and plentifulPoblano Cheddar Cornbread vs. Honey Butter Cornbread - Go with the sweet cornbread. It blew the savory out of the water.Baked Beans w/ Kobe Beef - sweet with a kick, expect to sleep alone laterBruleed Mac-N-Cheese - meh, just okay. a little dry for my tasteKey Lime Pie - BEST KEY LIME PIE I HAVE EVER HAD! Touch of mint + homemade whipped cream + graham cracker crust + raspberry sauce plate treatment Service was quite attentive. Manager offered to get my aunt another glass of wine. Server assistants/bussers on top of refilling waters, boxing food, and clearing plates. Only complaint: Our waitress, while friendly enough, did not offer any advice/navigation of the menu to 3 bewildered first-timers. Next time I will try the ribs!The space is inviting, open kitchen gives a cool vantage point, but it gets LOUD to the point where I had trouble hearing my dining partners. Wood trim walls and ceilings + hardwood floors = poor acousticsWe will return when the weather warms so that we can take advantage of the outdoor patio. Very convenient location just steps from the Clark/Division Red Line!"
So yummy! I went for the first time a week ago and went back again within the same week. Everything I tried was awesome. The waitstaff is great-- very nice and helpful. It is entirely possible to eat yourself sick (I did!).
"q was great!  came here for a 30th birthday party, and my friends rented a private room for saturday night.  dinner was family-style, which was perfect because there were 15 of us and we didn't have to take all night to order.there were sweet pickles and cajun chips to start, already waiting out on the table.  i'm a dill pickle fan, but the sweet pickles were pretty damn good anyway.  for starters, we had the hush puppies and the fried green tomatoes - both were really good, although i really like lillie's q's puppies better.  our main meat came, and we had the chicken and the ribs.  the ribs were FALL OFF THE BONE!  the only ribs i've ever had that were fall of the bone were homemade by my brother-in-law, so i was really happy to see these were, too.  the chicken was juicy and flavorful.  the meats came with 4 different sauces on the side.  our sides included mac & cheese, baked beans (with kobe beef), and cornbread.  everything was really good.  it was hard not not finish the plate.dessert was phenom, too.  while everyone had the peanut butter brittle (im allergic), i had some sort of chocolate mousse pie with caramel and pretzels.  it was amazing.the decor is super cute - old country, yet modern, homey, clean.  i ordered the sauv blanc all night, but others had the mint julep (in sno-cone form) or pimm's.i am definitely going back!"
"Went for Sunday brunch. We tried the pulled pork sandwich, Mac and Cheese, and homemade lemonade. All were fantastic. The service was great- never had an empty glass. I recommend making a reservation!"
"This review is closer to a 3.5 star rating.A group of us went to Chicago Q last night for a friend's birthday dinner.  We had reservations, but it being a Monday evening, the restaurant wasn't terribly crowded.  I ended up ordering a half slab of ribs, fries and some mac and cheese.The positives:-The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious.-The ribs were quite tender.-The selection of sauces was diverse and flavorful.-Price was reasonable (not great but ok) especially for the area.-The  homemade chips and pickles at the table were a great touch.-The restaurant ambiance was very charming.The negatives:-The meat was room temperature.  I understand that you don't want the customers burning their hands, but room temperature was a major turn off.-The waiter was very slow waiting half an hour to first approach the table to take only drink order, then waiting another 20 minutes to take dinner order.  Only saw him 3 times in what ended up being 2 hours.-The fries were crisp, but subpar in flavor.  They too were barely above room temperature.All in all, I thought it was alright to slightly above average.  The kinks weren't too major, and could have been chalked up to an off day."
"Visited this past Sunday.  Used OpenTable to book a reservation.  Was promptly seated at a table of our choosing on the outside patio.  Very comfortable.  Waitress service was prompt and kindly.  Brother Thelonious Beer - nice and cold!   Ordered the 3rd Quarter.  1 qtr pnd of pulled pork, 1 qtr pnd of baby back ribs, and 1 qtr pound of pulled chicken.  Pulled pork was good.  Baby back ribs were pretty dry BUT, they were nice and soft and meaty.  Pulled chicken was a big disappointment.  It wasn't pulled.  It was literally a sliced chicken breast and super dry (understanding that white meat is dry typically - this was even dryer).  Their hush puppies and cornbread were simply amazing though.  Mac and cheese was delicious.  Greens were pretty horrid.  My take on greens - if you can't make them - don't make them.  They offer 4 sauces. If you've been to Lilly Q's, you've had some amazing sauce.  The sauces here were very disappointing actually.  This was really the weakest part of the experience.  Overall, good experience, despite a couple of overpoured beers.  Great portions for the cost, but if you're a true BBQ fan, not the most flavorful place.  It just lacked BIG flavor which is what ppl want with BBQ. Yes, I will visit again - but don't see myself frequenting this place as a top tier BBQ joint."
"I really want to give Q a great rating.  They do excellent ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket.  The selection of sauces is great - and love that they serve them in little bowls (rather than sticky plastic bottles!).  The portions are a healthy size, so I don't mind that their prices are higher than many other bbq joints.  The atmosphere is nice, and the cocktails are quite lovely.  They have a great selection of bourbons and some refreshing cocktails that pair nicely with smoked meat.HOWEVER, the service leaves a lot to be desired.  They stuffed our party of 5 into a booth with a chair on the end.  When we pointed to another more suitable (and empty) table, the host promised us that the 4-top next to us would be seated with 2, so our aisleway companion wouldn't be cramped.  He removed the chairs to make his point, only to bring them right back with a party of 4 about 10 minutes later.  Our server was completely indifferent.  He brought our drinks but forgot a glass for one of the beers - and it took him 10 minutes to come back with one!  He rarely came back to check on us, so we were left thristy for more drinks.  My husband never did get his 2nd drink.  We also didn't see our entrees for a full hour after being seated - pretty surprising for a place where the food is slow-cooked for hours...the one bright spot on service was the busboy, who did a great job."
"If there were more than five stars, I would give it. The ambiance, the location, the waiter (Phil was awesome!) and THE FOOD!!! I am from the South yet this place had the best fried green tomatoes I've ever had. The BBQ was out of this world delicious, and even the sides were amazing. We had the asparagus and mushrooms (seasonal veggies), the cornbread, and the BBQ Kobe Beef Beans. So good that I can barely even finish my sentence when talking about it. Go. Now."
"For the second time in a row, I made a reservation and still had to wait 35 minutes to get seated.  Furthermore, 1st drink order took 20 minutes from the time we ordered them.  A few items were cold including the mac and cheese.  I have been here 5 times now but this was the last straw.  Ribs were ok, cornbread is great, most pulled meats are good."
"We really want to like this place. We keep trying. They keep disappointing. Perhaps we set them up for failure, only going on traditional bbq holidays like Memorial Day and July 4, but it seems that on those days in particular they'd have their act together. The biggest word of warning I can give here is don't dare enter without time to spare. And, if you're starving, bring a snack, because it will be a WHILE before you get to gnaw any ribs--or anything else. The food itself used to be great, and distant memories of our first visit bring us back. But they are slipping more and more each time we go, apparently hiding behind linen napkins (actually polyester) and a good bourbon selection to get them through. We went in yesterday for July 4 lunch, and apparently their new reputation is catching up to them: they were pretty empty. Even so, it took 10 minutes for our water glasses to get filled. The complimentary bb pickles and bbq chips were long gone before any meals arrived. My husband's beer glass was empty more often than not, and my son's pulled chicken was full of squiggly skin and veins. What 4 year old wants to look at that, much less eat it? The baked beans were more of a soup, and full of fatty meat, which is supposed to be their kobe brisket. The braised greens were a little better than last time (when they were AWFUL), but still stemmy and tough. We were trying to think of a better place to go for our next bbq fix while we were waiting with the plates pushed as far as possible across the table to signal to SOMEBODY that we were DONE and would like to quit being held prisoner. Really--if you would please just bring us our check, we promise not to bother you again--ever!"
"who would have thought that upscale & bbq go hand in hand?!?they start you off with amazing bread and butter pickles & bbq chips - to DIE for. in my opinion i don't think you really need to order an appetizer.     i love there mac and cheese and baby back ribs.  the place is decorated very nicely and the service is excellent. the portions are huge- i have always had leftovers.   if you have room after your meal they carrot cake is excellent.  highly suggest this place, you wont be sorry."
"A note to my rating of 4 stars: I will go back to try the baby back ribs and if they meet my expectations, I would give this place 5 stars. It's about time we get a barbecue restaurant in my neighborhood. Great restaurants like Luciano's on Rush and Papa Milano's on State have come and gone, and still we have to go to W. Division to Smoke Daddy or the NW side to Fat Willy's to find some good BBQ.I think Chicago Q is off to a great start. Went for lunch and tried the pulled pork and pulled chicken. I think the sign to good pulled pork is that you don't need to add any barbecue sauce. And while the 3 sauces that accompany your meal are excellent, especially the classic sweet one, I did not find myself reaching for it to add to the sandwich. Cole slaw side was above average, baked beans are meaty and fantastic. Hush puppies are a must for an appetizer. They are good on their own as well as with the spicy dip they're served with. The cornbread was outstanding as well.The restaurant's decor is very nice and does not look like a typical BBQ joint. Obviously, the food is most important, but the atmosphere is great. I look forward to them adding a full bar - it should become very popular soon.I will be back and update my review once I've tried the ribs. To be continued..."
"Not cheap. Not really very good. I grew up eating great BBQ and was excited Q was coming to the neighborhood.  But after giving it two chances, now I just give it a pass."
"Been on a bbq binge lately tryin to find my favorite spots.  Have to give this place 4 stars because it wins in a few categories.  I immediately liked this place because of the pickles and chips they serve you.  Those pickles are the best pickles I have ever had!  Then came the food.I have to knock this place a little because the kobe brisket did not live up to the hype.  Being labeled ""kobe"", I expected a lot more.  But i found it to be very average brisket.  Personally, I found Smoques brisket to be the best with Honky Tonk being a very solid second.  However, Q's ribs blew away both places.  Their sides did too.Now, Q seems to try to achieve this more upscale bbq place, which is unique, but not my preference.  But thats all personal in terms of style so i can not hold it too much against them.  Their price point is definitely higher than the other solid bbq places in the city.  However, I do think its worth it in some cases.  Again, big fan of the ribs and pickles here.  I would get brisket elsewhere though."
"The excellent food started with the complimentary bread & butter pickles and BBQ chips.  These starters and all of the food that followed was excellent.  The prices were surprisingly reasonable.  To go along with the tasty BBQ, they have a diverse draft list of high quality craft beers.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  One of our meals was accompanied by the wrong side dish, but the correct side was promptly brought out.  The only drawback is the noise level in the dining room.  Next time I'm back in Chicago, I'll be going here again."
"Had a great experience all around here. I highly recommend it for any Chicago residents or visitors who might be interested in getting great barbecue at an attractive, lively upscale destination."
"First visit to Chicago Q and for the most part, very impressed.  10 of us gathered on a Friday night for a friend's b-day celebration.  We were seated in the round room right by the entrance.  It was nice, good space, but did feel sorry for the party of 2 that was sharing the space with us as we were a bit loud.  Of course, the noise level in the space is way above conversation level. To start with we had the bason chedder hush puppies.  Can I say gone to heaven!  YUMMO!  The house made pickles and chips were a nice addition, something to munch on between servings. I had the St Louis Ribs and they were good.  Not outstanding, but good.  I have them again.  All other plates looked fantastic.  On of our party wanted to mix up a little with the combinations and they were very accomodating. Desserts were good, the carrot cake especially.  One thing to note, it was a very busy friday night.  After we had ordered the desserts, the waiter and bus boy began to hover near the table, removing items the second they appeared to be finished with.  In addition. the check was brought to the table prior to the desserts being served.  MESSAGE loud and clear, we need your table.  As we were leaving to get our coats, there was a significant crowd waiting for tables.  Several comments being made about the large party ""finally"" leaving.  That was from the hostess to a party waiting. So, overall, the food was very good, I'll go back for sure.  Overall dinner service was fantastic.  Wrapping up the meal, not so much.  Just felt rushed.  Definitely will go again, probably with a smaller party and not on a Friday night."
"Really good ribs. The other bbq meats I tried were not exceptional, but the ribs were pretty much all I could have wanted them to be. Staff is very attentive and friendly, and their whiskey selection is a nice twist if you're looking for more than just food. Prices are also extremely fair for its location, and there is plenty to do nearby."
"I stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised when entering this barbecue restaurant.  The décor was tasteful and elegant but not stuffy.  The host was extremely nice and offered to give me a tour seeing that it was my first time there.  I ended up choosing a high top table in the bar section, near the fireplace which helped warm me up from the January chill.  While reviewing the menu, I devoured the complimentary home made chips and pickles; they were outstanding!   For lunch, they offered a Pre Fixed Set Menu for only $17.99 - what a great deal!  I chose the House Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies while my guest chose the Smoked Dry Rubbed Wings - both were delicious.  From there I moved onto the Pulled Pork Sandwich on a pretzel roll; I was provided with 5 different sauces to choose from - all were very tasty, however opted for the Spicy BBQ, which was not overly spicy, but had a nice warmth to it.  The dry rubbed pulled pork was great all on its own; you could tasty the spices and smokiness.  As sides, my guest and I split the cornbread and Fries - the cornbread was great, the fires however, could have used a little work.  As for the desert, we opted for our cookies to go as this meal was very filling.  I will be back for sure"
Great southern comfort food dining experience. 4 sauce options allow you to sample the variety. Will be back for sure.
Great food. Great service. Awesome sauces.
"I live only a few blocks away from q and couldn't be happy to have a real non-touristy steakhouse in the neighborhood.  I really loved everything about q.  The decor reminds me of a beach house in North Carolina and the servers' plaid shirts were friendly and crisp.  The prices were also incredibly affordable.  As for the food, it was delicious an plentiful.  The pickles and chips appetizers were a great and unique touch.  I had the smoked chicken and loved how the bbq sauces were brought out in separate dishes so you could try a bit of all of them (no spicy for me!).  I also had the cornbread (my favorite southern side) and tried some of the coleslaw, which was not too mayo-y.  The vegetable side was brussel sprouts will apple, mushroom, and nuts (if I remember correctly) and that was also wonderful and huge.  Definitely going back to this gem in the neighborhood!"
"Always on the hunt for good BBQ in Chicago, I was thrilled when a friend suggested we meet for lunch here on a Sunday.  We were one of the very few tables in the place and our service was awesome.  Attentive but not overly.  We both ordered the sample from the appetizer menu as my entree and split an order of mac n cheese.  Now the mac n cheese was awesome.  The sampler came with a small portion of the pulled pork, chicken, and kobe brisket along with a few slices of their cornbread.  Maybe for a big dude, the portion would be small but I thought it was perfect.  I also love that they don't automatically slather their meats with sauce and instead give you a choice of 3 different sauces.  I personally hate sauce so I happily devoured everythings sans sauce.The place is a little pricey but I think there's good value there.  The portion sizes that I saw at other tables looked large.  My only complaint is that when I ordered a Diet Coke, they gave me a small glass bottle of it.  Yes, I know it probably tastes better but I like my dt colas and like free refills.  They don't have that here.  However, they do have wonderfully square ice.  The space itself is pretty nice and would be great for large groups and parties."
"After having some great BBQ in North Carolina my husband found this restaurant.  We had dinner with a group of friends, the first impression of the restaurant when walking in is one of a more high end restaurant.  The decor of the restaurant is very nice, tables are spaced a bit apart and they offer your choice of napkin (black or white).I ordered the BBQ ribs and they were outstanding.  I decided to try the regular ones and was impressed with meatiness and taste of the ribs, they are also very generous with the BBQ chips that they place on the tables, when are bowl would get empty they would quickly replace the chips.Overall everyone enjoyed their meals and I will be back again.  This is a great place to go for a date or with a group of friends, I highly recommend."
Very good overall - great sauces.
"Where do I start...Service:Unbelievable, they have numerous servers, bussers, and managers floating around ready to jump when you say jump. They are on tables like white on rice! Now yes some people don't like to be pampered like this but I do and found it quite enjoyable. Food:  Simple menu which is good, they choose a few items to master and they did just that. This was my first time there and I had the pulled pork sandwich. This was by far the best pulled pork sandwich I had ever tasted in my life. With your sandwich they bring you a plate full of different sauces you can add but the pork is so flavorful you don't even need it. You will not leave there hungry. They serve you huge portions and they bring you endless homemade BBQ chips and sweet pickles from the start. Very impressed with my entire visit and will most defiantly be back!"
"I ate here last night and had a delicious pulled pork sandwich. But the dish that took everyone's breath away was my friend's Kobe brisket dinner place - sliced, not chopped.  That brisket was hands-down the best brisket I've ever had, just amazingly moist and fall off the fork tender.  Yum.  The chocolate cream pie with pretzel crust was also really, really, really good."
Went for restaurant week. Awesome vibe layout and overall ambiance. Food was just ok: overcooked bbq shrimp with slightly lumpy lemon-infused grits; good sliced kobe brisket but a disappointing plate.
"Thank You JESUS this place is good!!!! The championship ribs are as Jimmy Walker would say ""Dino-mite""!!!! Please do yourself and favor and pay the $10 for the up grade because it's worth it! I can't get enough of the championship ribs and the ginger fizz-icee drink-yummy!"
"Fantastic.  Very friendly staff.  You can tell whoever created the menu is a fanatic.  They know BBQ and want to prove it to you.  It's in the Gold Coast so it's a bit higher-end, but not too badly priced.  A pork sandwich was $12 and incredibly filling.  The dry rub on the potato chips you get when you sit down, just wet the appetite.  They have plenty of items on the menu if you have expensive tastes (e.g., Kobe beef ribs)."
"Damn those were some great ribs!  Went with a bunch of guys and pre-ordered the competition ribs.  They were the best ribs I have had in Chicago in the last 8 years.  Clearly beat out Smoque and Fat Willys and several others.  The Mac n' cheese was also the best I have had at any BBQ place.  We re-ordered that several times.  The brisket was good, but not as good as Smoque.  The sauces were actually a big disappointing.. but the ribs were so good on their own, they did not need any sauce.. so tender and meaty and smoked right through - I still dream about them.The restaurant itself is very appealing and women will like it way more than your average BBQ place.  You could host a nice business dinner her easily with the nice white limestone and big wooden beams in the main room.  The butter pickles were fantastic to start as were the hushpuppies.  Those went quite fast.  The other stellar side was the mashed potatoes.Be forewarned that this place does not have many vegetarian options.. but I don't necessarily think a BBQ place should.  The chef came to our table personally to see how we liked the ribs.. which was  a nice touch.  The private rooms upstairs looked fantastic as well.A great addition to the BBQ scene.. more upscale and very appealing.  Mouth- watering ribs.  Remember to pre-order those.. they are so worth it.  (big slab though.. so share with someone)... Skip the brisket.. small portion and only okay.  Pulled pork was also solid.. not amazing.  Do not miss the Mac n Cheese."
"Ambiance - Love it, especially upstairs. It's a great place to have a small gathering. You can request to be seated on the couches, and it feels like your at  home in your own living room.Food - THE BEST smoked chicken. I dream about it sometimes. I also adore the cornbread and the complimentary potato chips they serve with the meal."
"I love BBQ!!! This place does not disappoint.  We started with the homemade BBQ chips and pickles. Great way to start the meal. I couldn't stop eating! For apps we had the wings and hush puppies, excellent. The wings were perfectly seasoned and the hush puppies were delicious. For our main course I had the q2 pulled meat+half slab of ribs and cornbread. The ribs and cornbread are fantastic. I had the smoked bacon sausage- it was ok. I wasn't a fan of the taste but maybe I'm being to picky because everything else I ate (cornbread, ribs, mac and cheese, BBQ wings, hush puppies, BBQ chips and pickles) were great. My husband I had the q3- 2 pulled meats and half slab of ribs. He said it was excellent and I could tell he liked it because the plate was empty.  For dessert he had the carrot cake was excellent I almost didn't have room for dessert. But, I had to have dessert. I chose the milk and cookies (glass of milk with 3 different cookies) Again fantastic, the cookies were soft and huge. I think the oatmeal-bacon cookie is my favorite, the other two - almond cookie bar and double chocolate were awesome too.For drinks, I had the Southern Belle cocktail, it was the perfect drink to complement the meal.  The service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive. I will definitely be back!"
"We went to Chicago Q for my boyfriend's birthday last night...let's just say he was beyond thrilled!  He got the sampler of brisket and ribs, I got the pulled pork.  Each came with cornbread (OMG!).  We also had a side of beans and a side of mac and cheese.  Everything was amazing.  And, we had a ton of food left over, which makes excited to go home and eat tonight!  The other thing that made our experience so great was our server.  Ask for Amber.  She was excited about the menu, knew her beers well, and was super friendly.  Everything she recommended was fantastic!Chicago Q is definitely a do-over.  YUMMY!"
"This should be 4.5.I was very excited to try this place and it didn't disappoint.The food was 5 stars. Loved the pickles (so good I brought a jar home), potato chips, baby back ribs, key lime pie. I can't wait to go back to try more things (though it would be hard not to have all of those again). I love getting 4 sauces to choose from and the spicy one is great. I tried the brisket, which was good, but it didn't move me. Fries and coleslaw were solid too. I liked the braised greens with the vinegar, but that would be the first one I would give up the next time. The chocolate mousse pie was not bad, but a little disappointing.There are very nice drink options if you like beer and bourbon, and some interesting mixed drinks. I really liked the mint julep.My only complaint is the service was not very good. We had two waiters and half the service. They were nice, but took a long time to come around as the restaurant got more full."
"If you like BBQ, this is THE place to go.Amazing food.  The brisket and pulled chicken were my personal favorites.  The cole slaw was outstanding - not too much mayo and not too tart and sharp. Atmosphere is relaxed but also, upscale.  Waitstaff was attentive and friendly to our 6p table - no small feat!HIGHLY recommend visiting this place."
"We visit Chicago often but when our friend said she was taking us to a BBQ place I was a bit suspicious. I mean KC is for BBQ, Memphis, Nashville, etc. But it didn't take long for us to be won over. While we were seated I noticed the Chef/owner looked familiar. I asked our server if that was the girl from Food Channel's Pitmasters. Yes, it was Lee Ann Whippen. Lee Ann stopped by our table several times during our feast. She was very friendly, discussing our favorite KC spots. Her Dad is from KC and she is familiar with Arthur Bryants, Gates, and others.Q's ribs are dry rubbed and served with a choice of sauce on the side, my favorite way. We had a combo platter and an extra slab of the competition ribs. Both rib styles are excellent, the competion seemed a bit meatier. It was all excellent, great service, friendly staff. Pricey? Hey it's Gold Coast, it ain't Murpheysboro, but very reasonable. Try it."
"Admittedly, we did stop in on a Sunday night, which tends not to be ""peak"" timing for most restaurants. I was very impressed with the ambiance- this place has a great space. The fireplace in the bar area was epic. We watched a football game while we ate. Our food came out right after we ordered it, which was great. I had the brisket, which left a little to be desired- it was a little cold despite coming out fast and not very flavorful. The BBQ sauce selection was fun- you get four choices. My buddy ordered the ribs, which I had a few of- they were delicious. Next time, I'll order those."
"Far and away my favorite BBQ place in Chicago!You could easily have an entire meal of just appetizers and you would leave happy!  Highly recommend the cornbread, bacon cheddar Hush Puppies,  and wings.  Definitely big enough for 2-3 people to share.  If you arent up for an entire set of Ribs yourself, definitely get the competition style ribs for the table.  These wings are some of the best in town!  You will be sad if you leave without trying.Also, ask to get a tour of their kitchen.  Their prep and smoking process is impressive to see."
Nice place
"The restaurant is nice.  The bacon and cheddar hush puppies were yummy, but a lot heavier than I expected.  I was so disappointed with the brisket sandwich!  I've only had brisket once before - in Texas.  It was so good that I was hoping someone in the city could make brisket just as good.  It wasn't Chicago q.  It tasted like it had no seasoning.  It appeared as if it would be moist since something wet drenched my sandwich bun to the point I couldn't pick it up or eat it, but it was dry as well as flavorless.  Bummer.  :("
"Yes, I'm a fan. When it comes to BBQ in the city, you can either go old school or new school. Old school is more hole in the wall spots dotted around Division and Wicker Park or the near south side, new school is Chicago Q. With a beautiful dining room and thoroughly attentive service, ""Q"" has become one of our favorite comfort food spots in the city. From the pulled pork and chicken sandwiches that are accompanied by BBQ sauce flights, to the kobe sliced brisket, you really can't go wrong if you're craving some well seasoned, simmered, and grilled meat. Oh, and don't forget the massive slices of cornbread or baked mac and cheese. Outside of maybe the County Line in Austin, I think this is the best brisket I've ever had.  Bring your friends and family, great for groups, and generally just a really good time, Q definitely has a future as a staple in the Chicago restaurant scene."
"I'm a local and I frequently get take out from this place. I love the whole menu, kobe brisket and fries are great. If you don't like it, I don't like you."
"The food here is awesome! 3rd time been and all 3 great from food to drinks and dessert.  Good bourbon selection, martini with smoked olives off the hook.  This time I tried something diff, slow smoked salmon steak and it was crazy good.  Best wings around. I hope with becoming more popular they are able to keep the high standard.  Well worth a visit!"
"Great meats, great sauces, great sides. Classy but comfortable atmosphere, with friendly service. What's not to love?"
"I LOVE this place! It's like BBQ GONE CLASSY. The staff is friendly and professional. The interior design and decor makes you feel like you could be in a totally different city, more like on the East Coast. Everything I've tried is amazing! Pulled pork sandwich is a must- I mix the vinegar and sweet bbq sauces for the perfect, rare combination. I took over half of the meat off of my sandwich and used it to make 2 more large sandwiches at home the next day! SO GOOD. The brisket is fab, just as the sides are. The mac & cheese, beans, cole slaw, corn bread....MMMMmmmm. The pickles and chips they serve when you are seated are so delish too! This is a place is a true gem."
"I guess I realized that I'm just not ready for an upscale BBQ rib joint.  I say that because while deciding to sit at the bar with a friend I noticed the couple next to us scraping the meat off their bones with a fork.  Really? I thought you were supposed to pick the bones up and gnaw on them til all the meat comes off.  Even if you hear a slight slurping sound, it's OK.  Boy was I in the wrong place.  White table cloths, Eating BBQ ribs with a fork and knife.  LMAO!!  On a rainy Wednesday night the place was packed though.  We decided to eat at the bar because of the 1/2 hour wait for a table.  We were hungry I might add.  So we ordered a half slab of St. Louis ribs, mac +cheese and baked beans.  Our order came out pretty fast.  A little too fast if you ask me.  Also it showed up as a full slab of ribs.  We decided to take the full slab anyway.  The bartender admitted to the mistake and decided to take our drinks off our bill; very admirable.  Now for the food.       The St. Louis ribs were horrible.  I really expected them to be great considering their price.  They were dry rubbed but with little flavor. No char or burnt ends like real BBQ.  They actually looked like they were baked and then smoked with a tiny layer of rub on the top. I can't say for sure.  Yeah, Yeah, they had the little smoke ring on them for the BBQ aficionados. Big deal.  They still didn't taste good.  Something I found quite funny was their so called ""Competition"" St. Louis ribs cost $33.75 for a full slab.  If you notice on the menu it doesn't say ""Award Winning Competition"" St. Louis ribs. I think not.        So now, can someone please suggest a place in Chicago that serves a good mac + cheese without putting those fucking bread crumbs on top.  Where did that shit come from.  Black folk don't do that. You can ask any African American you know if they put bread crumbs on mac and cheese and I guarantee they'll look at you with a side eye.  So I won't even comment on how good/bad the mac + cheese was.        The baked beans on the other hand were delicious.  Nice chunks of brisket. Not to tangy and definitely not overly sweet.  The best thing we had there. The cornbread which came with the ribs was just ok. Nothing to write home to mama about. All in All I think places like Smoque or Lillie Q's is about as upscale a rib joint as I need to go, especially for the price.  But if you want some real ribs cooked the old school way head to Uncle John's bbq.  P.S.  Parking sucks, be prepared to pay $12 for valet."
"So freakin' good. Used to live right around the corner and smelled the delicious smell of BBQ all the time - if my wallet could handle it, I'd be here every week. It is expensive (bill for 2 was about $100), but amazing food. I had the brisket and the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese is beyond tasty, and the brisket was very tender. Not a huge fan of any of the BBQ sauces, but the meat is good on its own! The service is also great and I can't wait to go back again!"
"So the night started out a little rocky...my mom and I got their at about 8 for an 8:30 reservation so I expected to have to wait a bit.  We were greeted and told we would be seated in a couple minutes.  Then, while waiting, we saw about 5 other parties get sat and I'm like WTF?!  So I gave the hostess the stare down until she walked over to me with her tail between her legs and a stick up her ass!  She tells me...""I know you've seem me seating people before you (and mind you at this time it's 8:25) but they had reservations at 8:15...so technically they need to get seated first.""  I just looked at her and said, ""Really?""  She then smiled and said we would be seated next and walked away.  We were seated shortly after, but not after two more parties of two were seated before us.  BAD START!  Let me tell ya!  Front of the house staff that night...-5 stars...seriously.But from that point on...our experience was magical!  Our waitress was honestly one of the best I have ever had...EVER!  She was phenomenal...personable, funny, inviting...must I go on?!  The busboys were amazing and were always filling our water and refilling our pickles and chips...love them!  Then there was the food.  We started with the Hush Puppies with Chipotle Aioli...uh-mazing!  Sooooo good!  I went their for one thing and one thing only, the beef ribs.  And of course, in Angieland fashion, she regretfully told me they sold the last one about 10 minutes prior.  I almost died right their, literally, or killed the front of the house twizat for seating me all late and shit!  Sooooo...anyways...I wasn't messing around, so I ordered the Competition St. Louis style ribs with the cornbread and my mom had the combo with the pulled pork and the baby back ribs, also with the cornbread.  Everything was pretty amazeballs but honestly the highlight was the baby back ribs and the cornbread!  And my favorite of the three sauces served alongside was the spicy and my mom only tried (and loved) the original.  I definitely need to come back and try the beef ribs and possibly the competition baby backs!  This is def a must try for BBQ lovers!**And FYI, Claudio, the Asst. Gen. Manager came over to ask how our night was and I was blunt, like always, and told him how upset I was about not getting my beef ribs and about the front of the house, and he told me to give him a call next time before I come in so they can set aside an order of beef ribs and he said he will make sure to take care of us!  Yay!  Gotta love that kind of service!  I'll be back."
"The chips and pickles are an awesome substitute for pre-dinner bread, but I was almost too full to eat. Got the BBQ sampler as an app, and the pulled chicken sandwich as my entree. The sandwich was pretty good, until a waiter walked behind me, bumped into my elbow, and my water spilled all over my sandwich. I was pretty full already anyway, so I didn't make a fuss about it, but the waitress didn't say a word when she came by and saw a plate full of water. Not what I expect in terms of service. Food=4 stars, service= 2 stars."
"So I've been wanting to try Q for quite some time and finally had my opportunity.  It was a very underwhelming and disappointing experience.We started with the hush puppies and for entrees one of us had the beef brisket sandwich and the other pulled chicken with a side of fries, cornbread, and mac and cheese.  Cubed beef brisket on the sandwich??  Usually beef brisket is sliced and tender, a little odd and not very good and the chicken was nothing special.   I will say that the mac and cheese and cornbread were delicious but I don't spend $80 for good sides.  Service was good.Very overpriced for the quality of the food served and we left very unsatisfied.  Definitely won't be returning and wouldn't recommend to anyone."
"Heard great things from friends and reading reviews, and it truly was worth the hype!  I went during restaurant week, and everything was amazing!  Their ribs and brisket was delish!  I also thoroughly enjoyed the cookie assortment for dessert.  Have already pointed all my friends in their direction!"
"So my friends wanted to come here but I gave up meat for lent.  So I checked out the menu and found a few things I could eat.  First, they start you off with bbq chips and pickles, nice touch.  For my meal I had the hominy, corn, and black bean salad and the jalapeno corn bread.  It was DELICOUS!  For some reason I expected the salad to be warm, but it comes out cold, nbd.  And it was a large enough portion that I could bring it home for the next night.  The salad and corn bread warmed up, equally delicious. And my friends both got the ribs and loved it.  I will definitely be back...maybe tonight.  And maybe I'll save room for dessert this time...."
"How in the world does this place have such a high rating? I (finally) made it here on Saturday night, and for as busy as they were, the food should have been out of this world.  Or, at the very least, fresh. Let me say first that, even though I'm from the south, I am not particularly knowledgeable or picky about my barbecue. Until Saturday night, I didn't know the difference between a baby back rib and a St. Louis style rib, and I only know that pork shoulder and pork butt are the same thing because Google told me so 45 seconds ago. BUT. I know that when you order ribs and a pulled pork sandwich, and they come out literally 2 minutes later, cold and without sauce, that they've been sitting under a heating lamp just waiting to be served. Also cold? The soggy fries AND the mac & cheese. And can we talk about the mac & cheese for just a minute? Because you need to know that the crap that comes out of the Kraft box has more flavor than what I was served at Chicago Q. Even adding spicy BBQ sauce didn't help. The complimentary pickles? Can't opine on those because I'm not a pickle person, but the smell made me gag. The complimentary bbq chips? Hit or miss, depending on whether a given chip had enough seasoning.The service? Do you remember how I said the food came out in 2 minutes? Well from that point forward, the waiters and busboys were trying to turn our table. They tried taking our free chips when the entrees came out, and they tried no less than three times to take our entrees while we were CLEARLY still eating. I mean, fork in hand still eating. And when my friend asked for a beer recommendation, something ""like a blonde,"" our waiter said, ""well we have ___ blonde on the menu."" And then he just looked at her, expectantly, as if reading the beer list sufficed as a recommendation.The ONLY redeeming aspect to this entire meal was the dessert - chocolate mousse with salted caramel. And I think there were crushed pretzels in the graham cracker crust. Still, as tasty as dessert was (it saved this from being a one-star review), I will never go back to Chicago Q. I used to think that there were too many good restaurants in this city to allow a sub-par, overpriced restaurant to stay open for very long. Clearly I'm wrong."
"Q is one of the best places I have been for BBQ. Not sure what to get...do the BBQ flight and you can see what you like best! The baby back ribs were also amazing, along with the coleslaw which I think might be the best I've ever had! They even give you a tour of the kitchen which is just the coolest thing ever."
Food is excellent. Beers are cold. TV's in the bar area for football.  Highly recommended for great BBQ at reasonable prices in Chicago.
"The chips and pickles are excellent and made me excited like a 5-year-old boy getting his Nintendo 64 on Christmas.  The hush puppies ironically make you scream and the shrimp and grits channeled my inner southerner (well, south of Wisconsin).  The kobe brisket sandwich was solid and I recommend trying all 4 sauces at least once before making a commitment, otherwise you have a 50/50 chance of a divorce.  The pulled pork sandwich my cohort Dragon had was delicious.  I would recommend trying that on your next visit.  Highly recommend."
"We split a full slab of the ""competition"" St. Louis ribs.  Ribs are not supposed to fall off the bone.  I don't know why people keep saying that's how they're supposed to be.  Rub was okay, sauce was decent.  I wasn't in awe, but it wasn't bad, either.  I just don't know if a full slab is worth $33-35.  I thought the dessert was excellent, though.  We had the peanut brittle and espresso ice cream dish.  Very original, and very tasty.  We really liked the hush puppies appetizer, too.  Wine was a bit overpriced, and selection was not that strong, though.  So it was a bit expensive for a barbecue meal, all told.  I liked the concept of upscale barbecue.  I thought the space was great, too.  They put us in a quiet room in the front of the restaurant, which was perfect for a V-Day experience.  I thought the service was very solid overall.  They do the little things right at this place, no doubt about it.  I'm really at 3 and a half, but I can't go to 4.  This is one of those places that looks like it's going to knock one's socks off but doesn't quite get there.  Smoque is still the gold standard in Chicago for barbecue, to me anyway.  At the end of the day I have to ask if this barbecue should be going at such a premium over Smoque.  If I am just doing takeout, the answer is no.  Dining in, this place certainly has more going on, and that is a real premium feature.  This is Chicago, though, and it is pretty competitive for barbecue here.  The concept here sets it apart from others, but the food isn't quite what the other operations have."
"One of the best restaurants in Chicago. ""Gourmet BBQ"" with a great story behind the owner/chef. Whenever family or friends come to visit, this is where I take them and they're never disappointed. I've even used them as an example in a sales exercise when asked what restaurant would you recommend. High quality, great service, great beer and liquor selection and reasonably priced."
I just tried their fixed menu for lunch. The hush puppies are yummy but the briskets weren't really dry but there wasn't anything special aside from the apps. I am going to go back to try the competition ribs to see if its better than smokedaddy's.
"I've been here a three times now. The first two times were great, the last time was a bit iffy. The meat was uncharacteristically dry. First off, their complimentary, homemade barbecue chips are great. I am not a fan of pickles, but they also give you a serving of them as you sit down at your table. Anything you order comes with a side tray of 4 sauces. They do not put sauce on the food; you do that yourself. I love the basic barbecue. So much that I bought a bottle to bring home for $12. My husband likes the Kobe sliced brisket, but I prefer the barbecue flight appetizer as my meal. It comes with a small portion of the pork, chicken and brisket and some cornbread. It's the perfect meal and gives you a little of everything. I will definitely continue to be a regular at this place."
"We've been fortunate enough to have eaten BBQ in all of the major venues in this country, and we've had the good and the bad.  Excited to see that there was a BBQ joint in our neighborhood, we went in, Friday night, no reservation.  Sat right down at a table in the bar.  So far so good.  They bring pickles and chips.  Can't go wrong there.Our server was amazing.  Chatty enough to let us know what was good and great, but not intrusive.The chicken was amazing.  Smoky, moist, flavorful.  Needed no sauce.That's where the good ended.I ordered a Diet Coke.  I got, for $3 or so, an 8 ounce bottle of Diet Coke.  That's a little too twee for me.  The brisket was dry, like they had sliced off the fat cap before smoking it.  It had the nice pink smoke ring that BBQ has, but that was as close as it got to be being authentic anything.The pulled pork was neither here nor there.  Certainly better than Lloyd's bucket stuff, but not really all that great either.The mac and cheese was ""brulee'd"".  Thankfully, they did not actually brulee it, because burned mac and cheese would suck.  Broiled breadcrumbs were a nice touch, but it didn't make up for the fact that the cheese flavor was bland.  I tried salt, hot sauce, and barbecue sauce, and nothing could rescue that plate of mac and cheese.The ultimate insult was delivered as I ordered dessert.  They have on all their menus that Pappy Van Winkle is available.  Great!  One of the best bourbons in the world, about as rare as it is good, and they have it here.  This could add a few stars.  Until our server came back and said ""you should ignore the menu, we don't have that""  I suppose it is too hard to have one of the 3 hostesses take a Sharpie to the menus before handing them out.  Anyway....it's one and done for me and Chicago q.  I'll go to Melnick's if I want BBQ right now, or save up my craving for when I can make it to Smoque."
"The most impressive thing about this place is the atmosphere.  It's very old world fine dining with a southern BBQ twist.  We sat by the fire at a high top in the bar area and received attentive, knowledgeable service.  While I like the idea of this type of food done remarkably well in a ""white table cloth"" environment, I'm not sure the food really matches the atmosphere or the prices.  If your significant other doesn't like the super bourgeois food that comes with a typical date night,  try wiping sauce from their chin after sharing some succulent pulled pork."
"I'm from Texas, so it had to be good . . . and it was! From the complimentary serving of fresh potato chips and sweet pickles to the Kobe brisket - wow - perfect with just the right touch of urban."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant as I was expecting an overpriced BBQ joint.  Was I wrong!They delivered pickles and BBQ potato chips as appetizers.  I passed on the pickles (now I regret it!) but pigged out on the delicious chips so that I was a bit full by the time our food arrived.  But I didn't let that stop me.  The brisket and pulled chicken were very good.  We had St. Louis ribs that were meaty and tasty but just a bit too tender for me.  (I like a bit of a ""pull"" on my ribs.) The sides were good also - potatoes and cole slaw.  The slaw was not mayonnaise-based thankfully!   Had a choice of 4 sauces; they were OK. The service was outstanding.  Our waiters were helpful and pleasant and our food came out very quickly!  The ambiance was really nice and we just had a very enjoyable dining experience.I'll be back!"
"To the Brian who lives south of Lincoln Square and sat next to me in the exit row on the flight to Chicago from Washington D.C. - thank you for recommending Q.  Absolutely the finest BBQ ribs I have ever had.  I'm 54 and I've had quite a few in my day.  I even smoke them myself on my Weber grill then bake them slowly until they fall from the bone.  Anyway, the flavor of Q's ribs was soooo fine that I didn't use any of their 3 sauces they put on the table...didn't even taste them.  When ribs are this flavorful they don't even need sauce!We tried the ""competition"" ribs for $10 a rack more.  They were better than the normal ribs, but not $10 worth.  They are somewhat more moist and sweeter.  The chef uses apple juice in basting them according to the waiter.  The bowl of bread 'n' butter pickles were really yummy as well as the home-made BBQ chips they put on the table from the start.  We had three sides: coleslaw, baked beans, and cornbread -- all excellent.  I'm picky about coleslaw and it was super.  The baked beans have a couple varieties of beans in them and are somewhat spicy hot...delicious.  The cornbread was moist and had some whole kernel corn in it.The atmosphere was great!  We sat in the room which had the large skylight.I highly recommend this place for the finest ribs ever!  All three of us thought the ribs were the best we had ever had."
"Great BBQ. Between the BBQ Shrimp, Half BBQ chicken, and the great mac and cheese, it was great. Gotta live the cornbread too."
"How did I never know about Chicago Q when I lived in Chicago?  I visited while I was traveling for work - a colleague and I scored seats at the bar.  Nice decor, a little crowded and loud, but as to be expected.  The bartender was friendly, knowledgeable and didn't rush us.  We ordered drinks and decided on hush puppies for an app.  The sauce that came with the hush puppies was outstanding - I could have drank it.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich for dinner and we split greens and mac n cheese sides.  My sandwich came with honey cornbread, which was out of this world.  I LOVED that the pulled pork came with four different bbq sauces.  The meat was tender and smokey - one sauce was better than the next.  The sides were outstanding.  I will absolutely go back!"
"EVERYTHING about this place is un-freaking-believable! Allow me to enlighten you: 1.) Set in an old mansion...not the typical grungy, sloppy BBQ joint (not that there is anything wrong with those.) 2.) Insanely huge portions (as mentioned earlier everything is unbelievable) but the baby back rib meat literally fell off the bone when I picked 'em up. 3.) Service was some of the best I have ever experience, anywhere. The GM and MOD were walking up to tables engaging in conversation and refilling water glasses. The entire team works together and has a passion for this establishment. (Chef Whippen must be proud!) 4.) Fries, mac & cheese, onion strings & HOT wings were outta this world flavorful. 5.) I have recommended q to at least 3 other people--all of whom went and had nothing but rave reviews as well. 6.) Go. Seriously. (But park the wheel barrow in front cuz you aren't walking anywhere once you're finished. The food coma WILL set in.)"
Nice place. Good drinks. Not many options for vegetarians.
Yeah fav BBQ in chicago.  The carolina sauce is amazing.  Close to good southern BBQ as you will find in Chicago with appropriate quality bourbon selection.
"We went here for a birthday dinner.  I saw it featured on tv, I believe on Check Please, so I made sure I put it on my list of places to try.In summary, I thought it had good ribs, with 4 different sauces to try.I didn't really taste the difference in the signature competition ribs and the regular ribs, but maybe my palate is not refined enough.I also tried the brisket which was good.We had appetizers too, which were good.  Shrimp and grits were awesome."
"I went on a busy Saturday night and the building and atmosphere are both cool, but this seems to be bbq for people who don't know any better.  I had the ribs and brisket.  They were okay, but I feel that the ribs still having the tips on is poor practice and made them hard to eat, and generally the ribs were small.  The brisket still had a pretty significant fat layer and I feel was a little dry, I think it needed a little for time in the smoker to draw the fat layer into the meat.  I would expect better for the price."
"I had some friends in town visiting during Cubs Convention weekend and took them there.  Again, the food was amazing.  I had the pulled chicken.  It was unbelievably moist and tasty.  The chips and pickles delicious as always.  I tried the fries for the first time.  They were good, but wish they would come up with something more unique.  I had the Pimm's, which was a perfect drink for one of the few bitter cold days we had this year.  My friends both agreed that it was the best barbeque that they have ever had.  Between the three of us we have lived in about 15 different states around the country and had many different styles."
"I just had a very delicious experience at Chicago q. The décor of q has a modern country feel. The walls and ceiling are white detailed wood. The floors are wide planked with a medium stain and the tables are dark which serve to create a nice contrast in a very inviting way.The service is wonderful. The wait staff is very attentive and easy going in this gourmet BBQ restaurant. Instead of the automatic boring basket of bread before the meal that most restaurants serve, we were served intriguing sweet pickles and seasoned potato chips. That was a pleasant surprise. The artful presentation of the food goes against the traditional sloppy style expectations of a BBQ experience. Though each member of my dining group ordered his/her own items off the menu, we all tasted everything. So here is my take on the food: The hush puppies appetizer appealed to my eye in its display on the plate and to my taste buds.  For my main course, I had a very generous portion of the tender and flavorful pulled chicken sandwich that also included three different sauces in which to dip the sandwich for the full BBQ experience.  My sides were pickled onions and cole slaw. Both had a unique flavor twist to a common food item which made the lunch even more special.  One of my dining partners had sliced kobe brisket, which was very tender, with a side of the most delicious honey corn bread. The other, had a chopped kobe brisket sandwich, also very tender and flavorful. The only disappointment was the side of french fries that came with the last mentioned sandwich.  They were unexpectedly dry, heavy and flavorless. I am thinking sweet potato fries would have complimented this dish much better.  The dessert was a large piece of carrot cake which was a big hit all around.Overall, this is lovely place to grab a delicious meal with reasonable prices."
"They have sweet tea! :-DThe food here was excellent.  Joe and I just got back from having NYE dinner there.  We ate off of their special prix fixe menu, so that's what this review will be about mostly... Our waiter was great once we broke him in a little!  He started off really awkward and timid, but then loosened up.  The staff treat you like you're in an uppity restaurant, and I guess the q is considered ""upscale"" but at the same time, the wait staff wear khaki pants, boots, and blue plaid shirts.  Either way, we were treated great and were given anything we wanted - this included having my iced tea be half sweet/half unsweet because the sweet was TOO sweet for me.  The space is beautiful, like being in a Southern home. Since it was right after Christmas, there was still pine and lights around giving the space a really nice glow. The food.  Again, they have sweet tea (please see above).  As soon as we were seated chips and bread and butter pickles were brought to our table.  The chips were a good sweet/spicy and crunchy and still hot (nice touch!).  And... I don't like bread and butter pickles, but Joe said that were good...  We started with an appetizer (a la carte) of bacon cheddar hush puppies.  They came out piping hot with plenty of dipping sauce.  I didn't care for the dipping sauce so much because I liked the hush puppies just as they were.  Joe had the scallops for his first course and I had the shrimp bisque (shame on me, I know... but it was SO GOOD)... Scallops were also good - undercooked for Joe's taste because he likes just a little  bit of raw on the inside, but the scallops had a good sear on them nonetheless.  His entree was the 18 oz porterhouse steak.  It came with asparagus and fingerling potatoes... It was seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly at medium rare... It tasted like a steak should taste.  I had the chilean sea bass and I didn't want that piece of fish to ever end it was that good.  Desserts included a chocolate cake (not my favorite, but Joe loved it) accompanied by a shot of Goldschlagger and a creme brulee duo of maple syrup and butternut squash - that butternut squash creme brulee was excellent.  Alas, we talked with our waiter a little about what we'd read online -- that the pulled pork was excellent.  He spoke to the chef and quickly brought us a sample of the pulled pork.  It IS excellent and this guaranteed a repeat visit from us to eat their pulled pork with a vinegar based sauce (I overheard that they had this from another table).  The reasons this establishment only gets 4 stars are: their sweet tea costs more than their regular tea; sometimes the plating was sloppy (but who really cares?!  all the food was great!); and that some of the asparagus wasn't trimmed well (but maybe the high quality meat (no tough parts) makes up for it?) Anyway, you should go to this restaurant.  The chef is extremely talented and the wait staff isn't annoying, but they try to give you whatever you want."
"Love the atmosphere here!  Feels like you're in an upscale barn :)  The food is hit or miss, and the service is good (not great).  I enjoy going here for the vibe and in a small group, but much prefer Dragon Ranch and Smoque when it comes to the food."
"I have been on a mission to find a good BBQ restaurant in Chicago.  After trying so many (Smoque, Smoke Daddy, Fat Willy's, Lillie's Q, Twin Anchors, Honky Tonk BBQ, Risque Cafe) and feeling disappointed each time, I was almost ready to give up and say that I just need to fly to Chapel Hill, NC to get some seriously good BBQ.I have finally found my BBQ place - and am so in love with Chicago Q it is almost bordering on the obscene.We decided to try it on a whim and walked in without reservations.  They seated us promptly and then placed homemade chips and bread & butter pickles on the table.  Wow!  Unexpectedly delicious!  And I don't usually even like pickles!I decided to try the competition baby back ribs while my husband ordered the regular baby back ribs so we could do a taste test.  I am happy to say that my choice was the right one, but my husband's dish was also pretty tasty when comparing to the other restaurants we've been to.I'm usually not a fan of dry rub ribs, but these ribs were so damn good that I could have eaten them without sauce.  Btw, they give you 4 sauces that you can try, which is a cool way of trying different flavor combinations but also makes you realize how freaking good the ribs are because they don't even really need the sauce!  And I like sauce!Let's talk about the atmosphere - it's parent-friendly, client-friendly, and just friendly in general.  It's clean and simple but comfortable.Oh I also loved my gigantic piece of corn bread, which is hard to do because I usually don't like corn bread at restaurants.Can't wait to go back!  Will tell all of my friends to try this restaurant!"
"Just when I was starting to lose faith and tiring of the hype of the next big restaurant, gastropub, barbecue pit in the city that kept failing to meet the buzz and hype, Chicago Q has come along. I missed those days of being wowed by a meal, I honestly thought those days were behind me luckily the competition style babyback ribs were beyond excellent. The type of BBQ I only expect to find down south. There's good BBQ in Chicago, but i put the Q's ""high end BBQ"" on a whole different level. Finally some GREAT BBQ that has me itching to go back for more. My five stars is based almost solely on the ribs, which were tender and had a great chew to them at the same time, fall off the bone, with a great char/crust to them. The service was excellent and everyone (from the manager to the wait staff) seemed geniunely enthused about the new venture.. As for the other food, the kobe beans and jalapeno hush puppies were great, the cole slaw was good and the trio of sliders were a great sampler to try everything else (smoked chicken, pulled pork, kobe brisket). The pulled pork and kobe brisket sliders were good, but I didn't really get enough to really give a fair assessment of the meat (that is what my next trip will be responsible for). The smoked chicken slider was a little dry, but if you are ordering smoked chicken at a place with all these other offerings...well you deserve what you get.   They had 3 different sauces as others have previously mentioned, they complimented the sliders quite well, but honestly were not necessary for the ribs in the least.Yes the price points are higher (i.e. $35 for the premium slab of ribs), but I would honestly pay even more and with the ambiance, great service, decor of an upscale joint and BYOB (until they get their liquor license, although that might come to a quick end after we saw a table of five stroll in with 12 beers and 2 liters of Grey Goose, pretty sure someone dying of alcohol poisoning isn't good for the first week of business) I still think this place is a great value."
Glad to have this joint in the hood.
"Laughable wine list. Very dry hush puppies. Mediocre food (mine was fine, the other five at my table said their's were below average). Horrible service. I did like the ""country"" atmosphere. For reference, I had the ""Competition"" St. Louis full slab of ribs. The ribs were tender and meaty, but the sauces weren't that interesting.Crowd was mixed. Lively atmosphere."
"The ambiance was awesome and the outdoor patio was very cute. A lot of after-work people like myself. The prices were expensive but the food was pretty decent. The chips and pickles were yummy, the limeade drink was delicious, the cornbread was great, all the BBQ sauces were good, but my brisket sandwich (good size) was kind of fatty and almost had a spongy consistency which I did not like. I would come back to order drinks with co-workers and order something else. Not good for vegetarians that's for sure."
"Great food, great atmosphere, great service!   A must for any BBQ lover."
"I just have the most fabulous evening at ""Q"" and had to sit down to write my first ever Yelp review...This place is AH-MAZING!  We went for a girl's dinner club and have never had a better experience.  The food was fantastic, but the service and atmosphere really made our night.  The staff couldn't do enough to make sure we enjoyed our meal, especially our server, Alfredo.  A fantastic evening ended with a private kitchen tour from the Chef - WOW!  LeeAnn Whippen, you've got a home run here - ""Chicago Q"" is a new BBQ favorite and I'll recommend it over and over.  Can't wait to go back!"
"My favorite bbq place in chicago (which I think is a lacking cuisine in chicago)! FREE unlimited pickles and homemade bbq chips! YES! and the food is AMAZING! the bbq prok and pulled chicken platters are super affordable and delicious. The other menu items are a bit pricey, but it's bbq-and quality bbq, so it's not gonna be cheap. But theres definitely budget-friendly options. Get the mac n cheese! TO DIE FOR"
"Outstanding meal with top-flight service. I loved the aromas and flavors. They let you select your own sauce, but I can verify that the meat alone is good. It was moist in spots, not-so-moist in others (just shy of dry, but not in a bad way), and was the perfect tenderness."
"Amazing food and great service. We had reservations and were seated immediately. We ate the Kobe brisket, pulled pork, st louis ribs, and baby back ribs among the 4 of us. All of it was delicious. There was a mishap where they brought out the full dinner item instead of a sandwich but the waiter immediately recognized the mistake and brought out the sandwich and wrapped up the dinner item for us to take home free of charge. I will definitely go back."
"LOVE CHICAGO Q!!  Easily the absolute best BBQ in Chicago. From the corn bread, to the cole slaw, to the ribs, to the carrot cake - it's bar none the best around town. Only complaint is that the bar is a little small. The restaurant gets busy quickly, so make sure to have a reservation. The outside seating is romantic and a lot of fun!"
"Really enjoyed my trip to the q.  We were in a booth on the main floor on Dec. 22 so it was very busy and very loud, but fortunately service did not suffer from the high volume.  The BBQ Flight and the Hush Puppies (in addition to the pickles and BBQ potato chips) made for great starters.  The Flight gives you a great way to sample the sauces offered.  The Competition Baby Back Ribs lived up to their reputation as well.  The full rack (the only portion size the Competition ribs come in) is more than enough for 2 hungry people to attack.  The coleslaw on the side adds a nice respite in the middle of this carnivorous meal.  The Straight Bourbon Flight went very nicely with the meal as well.  Overall, a great meal at a very reasonable price."
"I just adored this place. Everything from the amazing photographs, the cute bar, the waitstaff, the food, the drinks, the price... I couldn't get enough. And come on - pickles that don't taste like pickles anymore but still have that awesome crunch?! The meat was fantastic. I got pulled pork shoulder (which was just as good leftover the next day) and a bite of my date's kobe. Melt in your mouth goodness there and I love being able to sauce it up the way I want it since the 3 options all come on the side. Mac and cheese was great, although I will say the cornbread was just meh. But Chicago q, I will come eat your pickles and chips any day of the week. You rock."
"The mac & cheese is good, the brisket was excellent.  The wait was cheerful & attentive.  I got a thumbs up from the wife and daughters for picking this place.  :-)"
This place was still awesome the 2nd time around.  Tried the competition style ribs and the key lime pie and they were out of this world.
"I wasn't impressed with the food.  I tried this restaurant for restaurant week.  My family is from Mississippi and I was soooo excited to try the barbeque.  The homemade chips were good and I had the BBQ flight (pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket) as a starter.  It came with 3 huge pieces of honey butter cornbread.  The cornbread was good but it tasted like it was a step up from Jiffy mix.  My boyfriend had the shrimp and lemon-infused grits as a starter.  What a disappointment!  I've eaten grits all my life and while these were delicious in flavor they lacked big time in texture.  They were gritty and seemed undercooked.  I really had to chew them.  The bbq shrimp was really good.  I enjoyed the BBQ flight because the meat was tender and the flavor was smoky.  I next had the St. Louis style ribs.  Now I would have expected the ribs to either be dry rubbed or bbq sauced but this was not the case.  It came with a small container of sauce on the side.  I enjoyed the texture of the meat.  It was tender and you could definitely taste the smoky bbq flavor but it was lacking in any other seasoning.  I asked for a cup of the seasoning that they put on the homemade chips and seasoned the ribs myself.  My son enjoyed his meal.  But the cinnamon ice cream tasted like big red gum.  The cinnamon flavor was overpowering rather than it being a subtle complement to the creamy ice cream.  My son is 7 and never turns down sweets but he wouldn't eat it.  All in all, this restaurant was just ok.  I would come back for certain items on the menu but I wasn't wowed at all."
"Q has not gotten enough Yelp hype.  This place is fantastic.  Most restaurants who participate in restaurant week forget that those people who are savvy enough to get key reservation times at their relatively good restaurant, probably are on top of things because food is their thing and they could, on a normal day, absolutely afford the regular menu.  Once restaurants forget this small tidbit, they usually skimp on portions, serve up cheap cuts and put out service that is decidedly more at home in a Denny's.  Thus, they generally don't reap the return on their investment and blame us.  Q is a huge exception to the general crapiness of Chicago restaurant week.  From the time we walked in to the restaurant the service was phenomenal, the host, the waitress, the busboys-- token steakhouse quality service, above and beyond.  We ordered one restaurant week menu and some favorites we'd heard about (hushpuppies and macaroni), as well as a bottle of white wine, between 3 small girls.  The portions were perfect and the complimentary pickles and chips a welcome addition.  THE BRISKET, oh the brisket, it was like I always imagined it could be.  I won't pretend that I can speak to the majority of the menu, but I do know there were no low points of our meal-- everything was absolutely delicious.  I cannot wait to drag everyone I know back to Q, for bbq worth the gold coast price.  The space itself is homey and upscale at the same time, the restaurant could just as easily serve as a casual weekday dinner as it could a hard partiers' birthday.Thank you Q, for the best restaurant week experience in recent memory (3 years).  I cannot WAIT to come back."
"I've been searching for some great BBQ in Chicago for a long time. I finally feel I have found the spot at Chicago q. They do things the right way, you can see the meat is slow cooked by the smoke line in the ribs. The meat comes to the table with no sauce on it to hide any shortcuts.The sides were large but still very good. The sauces can stand up on their own, and it was nice to be able to combine a few together for a unique taste.""q"" is not cheap but I  feel it is fairly priced for the quality of food and service. Very nice atmosphere, we will definitely be back!!"
"The food and atmosphere at this place are outstanding. Came here with a big group, and the service couldn't have been better. We ordered a ton of food (which we later discovered wasn't necessary due to the huge-ness of their portions), and we weren't disappointed with any of it. I'm not a corn bread fan, but even I had seconds of this stuff. I had the pulled pork and fries, and it came with an assortment of bbq sauces to choose from. ALL, were delish. Everyone was happy with their food, and the mac n cheese was the standout of all of the shared dishes. Go here and expect great food and service, but make a reservation. The place was packed!"
"Had a fantastic lunch here last weekend. The sliced brisket and cornbread were absolutely fantastic, just the right amount of moisture. I loved 3 or their 4 sauces. The service was excellent, polite and informative. This will probably be my barbeque place now on."
"Where I come from, fancy and barbecue are never found in the same sentence or thought. This place just destroyed that belief. The Kobe beef brisket is simply amazing, not to mention the staff had a certain type of hospitality rarely found up here. Can't wait to go back.. Oh and call ahead because it's byob for now as yet wait for their liquor license."
"Lena, executive chef, came to our private birthday room to thank us and ask how everything was---now thats what I call outstanding service! Lena, lets get down to your DELICIOUS menu and thank you for your kindness and BBQ bliss that is Chicago Q.....We snacked on sweet pickles and BBQ sprinkled, light, crunchy potato chips that were on the table waiting to be devoured as we walked in. The way to do it, is to make a sweet pickle sandwich with two chips and crunch your way to goodness. Next up came our appetizer order---you HAVE to get the smoked dry-rub wings; def some of the best wings Ive ever had in the city. Hush puppies?!?! Oh yes, bacon/cheddar hush puppies, and they certainly didnt disappoint, esp with the chipotle dipping sauce. The salad had elements of hominy, smoked corn and black beans, which also had a southwestern, savory smokiness to it. By this point, I was feeling pretty food drunk happy so you can only imagine how 'hammered' I was with the main courses we ordered. KOBE BEEF ribs.....I mean.....they were dinosaur bones and worth every juicy bite. One rib took me about 10 minutes to eat! The pulled pork and chicken were outstanding and tender.  I LOVE all of the dipping sauce choices so that each bite had a different savory flavor. My absolute favorite kind of coleslaw,  honey butter and poblano pepper cornbread, and creamy, gooey mac and cheese rounded out the sides.I am so happy this BBQ place popped up in Gold Coast--good 'ole BBQ comfort food that shouldnt be missed!"
"Although I do love my meat, I am not a big BBQ person. Which is why I was a little hesitant going to this place. But I'm SOOO glad I did!I ate at Chicago q shortly after it opened when it was BYOB (they since have received their liquor license..and I am excited to go back and try some drinks because they have a cool bar/lounge type area upstairs). While looking at the menu, my boyfriend and I munched on complimentary sliced pickles. We ended up ordering the bacon cheddar hush puppies, brûléed macaroni and cheese, house fries, and the Kobe sliced brisket. I LOVED everything! The brisket came with three different BBQ sauces. I cannot stand BBQ sauce so I figured I would just eat the brisket plain, but, to my surprise, it came with something I've never had before;  Eastern North Carolina Vinegar-which was amazing!! My boyfriend is originally from the south and said this place was the best BBQ he's had in the city!The atmosphere was cool. Looked like an old house that was turned into a restaurant, different from most places in Chicago. The head chef came over and talked to us and was super nice. The wait staff was also knowledgeable of the menu and was very helpful. I will definitely be back..that Kobe brisket is still calling my name!"
"Always excellent & tonight was no exception. I love that ribs/pulled chicken combo! And we tried the fried green tomatoes appetizer, they were firm (not soggy like so many are, it seems) & perfectly tangy. Service was always on target, as usual, always present but never overbearing. Perfect!"
I have come here a couple of times and I love it here. I always get the trio with 2 pulled meats and some ribs. It is always so good! The cheddar hush puppies are a must! They hit the spot! I would like to come here with a huge group and get that pig that they serve!
"Went this past Friday and was really looking forward to getting some BBQ without having to drive anywhere. My fiancee and I split the Q3 (pick 3 of their meats) got beans and cornbread for sides. We decided on the brisket, pork, and baby back ribs and I have to  say I was surprised by the result. Without a doubt despite all of the great food on our plate, the brisket baked beans were the best thing we ate. It seemed like we had more brisket in the beans than came with our meal which was a huge bonus because the brisket also happened to be our favorite. The 3 sauces (Carolina, Sweet, and Hot) were all good and Carolina was very true to that style but we both ended slathering on the sweet sauce as that's more to our taste. It wasn't their night with the ribs as we saw people sending theirs back but I didn't think they were that bad. Definitely our least favorite but they still had a very good flavor.For dessert, we had milk and cookies which was a simple and perfect way to complete our meal.All in all, we ended up having 3 courses for around 50 bucks which while I agree is kinda high for BBQ, given the quality of the meal, I didn't mind one bit.Would go back for sure. Very cool interior though that's never a selling point for me."
"Let me begin by saying that I LOVE the pickles that they put on the table at the beginning of the meal, it may be my favorite part of my meal! That being said I really enjoy how it is a great place to go to share, we always fill the entire table with mostly sides are all so delicious! Q is great because the ambiance is uniquely upscale and casual, I always fee comfortable. Overall Chicago q is a great place to go to eat outside and enjoy some good food with friends!"
"(Third star is for ambiance)  THE GOOD:  I first off want to give this place credit for having some pretty darned good ribs.  We had the competition style (non. STL), and it was really good, The sauces were also pretty good.  THE BAD:  The service was slow, I did feel bad, because it seemed like there was only one server in our busy area (MGT needs to address).   & THE UGLY:  The kobe brisket.   It was crap (OCB is better!).  I requested a moist brisket, and got the leanest pieces of meat to man kind ( I guess if you're into that kind of meat, it's good for you, but I requested it a certain way).  The meat was flavorless, and so was the coleslaw that came with it.  I don't think I've ever had anything kobe that was bad until I ate it....  In any event they do throw in some pretty good bbq chips, and pickles, and have some good beers and bourbon on the menu.  Come for the ribs, don't mess with the brisket"
"The BBQ, service and atmosphere at Chicago q is out of this world! My group ordered the bacon cheddar hush puppy appetizer which blew our minds with the slightly spicy and fluffy flavor. The picture on their website of these delicious puppies is enough to make you drool. You are also served a delicious pickel appetizer as well as some southern spiced chips. I ordered the kobe sliced brisket with a side of poblano cheddar corn bread and I couldn't have been more delighted with my choice. The beef was smoked to perfection and the array of sauces brought to table made for a fun mix-and-match of tastes. My entire group was highly pleased with our selections of food and drink.What truly made Chicago q stand out was the attentive, knowledgeable and passionate wait staff on a crowed Saturday night. Our waiter suggested pairings of food and drink, had extensive knowledge about each bourbon on the list and was prompt from us being seated to wishing us well as we left with full bellies and a positive taste from this upscale restaurant."
"Went here on a Saturday night - the place was packed.  Everyone seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their meals.  Bright white interior reminds me of my ole kentucky home. Seriously tho..this place offers excellent food.  Hand made chips, and the sweet pickles...to die for and unique.  Started with Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies, spicey but couldn't stop eating them.  Main dish - I had Kobe brisket and my gf had Baby Back Ribs...and 3 different types of bbq sauce to compliment the meat which was delicious on its own.    We also had a side of Mac N Cheese-Yum.  Finished off with the huge chunk of espresso brittle ice cream..omg was it awesome..people were stopping by our table asking what it was.  Drinks were good as well....and the service was friendly and attentive.  Overall bill for 2 people was about $100.  But it was soo worth it."
Went there for a quick lunch on a late Saturday afternoon.  We were promptly seated and welcomed by the wait staff.  The food was absolutely awesome.  I am a convert and will definitely be back!!
"Taking advantage of Restaurant Week 2011, I decided it would be nice to try a new restaurant in the Gold Coast for once (one can only eat at Hub 51 and Sushi Samba so much).  With my love of bbq and being skeptical of any place selling it that isn't named Smoque, I figured it would be a good time to try Q.Hidden on N. Dearbourn, the outside looks like someone's apartment only painted really nice.  Once we stepped inside, it sort of resembled an Off Track Betting establishment but way fancier and without and sleezebags walking around holding losing tickets.Our party of four was early for our reservation, but they front desk sat us right away in a comfortable booth.  From our view, we could see the kitchen, which was partially open and appeared extremely clean.Our server brought over some complimentary pickles and chips, and one could make a meal of this if they really wanted to.  They keep filling them up to as they seem to disappear within minutes of being set on the table. AKA: they are addicting!Three of the four of us took advantage of the $33 Restaurant Week menu.  We each tried a different appetizer: BBQ Lemon Shrimp with Grilled Polenta, BBQ Flight and the Hominy, Smoked Corn, and Black Bean Salad.  BBQ Lemon Shrimp with Grilled Polenta: The shrimp were plump and juicy and cooked perfectly with a hint of lemon.  The polenta was dry as ever and needed some type of sauce (bbq was applied later) to make it more moist.BBQ Flight: This could easily be someone's meal and was a very satisfying appetizer.  Three separate cups of pulled chicken, pulled pork, and chopped brisket along with not one, not two, but three slices of warm cornbread.  Each meat was juicy.  If picked to choose my favorite, the pork would be the choice.Hominy, Smoked Corn, and Black Bean Salad: served chilled, the salad was huge and would make for a better side dish than a salad.  Almost all salads have lettuce, but this one didn't.  What it did have was thick chunks of avocado and a aftertaste that easily made up for some dumb lettuce.For entrees, we ordered the Kobe Brisket and the Full Slab of St. Louis Ribs.Kobe Brisket: 6-8 giant slices of brisket served with yet another giant square of honey butter cornbread and pickled onions (these are phenomenal as well).  The brisket was succulent but could've used some type of sauce.  Luckily, Q serves all of their meals with three different types of sauces.  One was mild, one was more vinegar based, and one had chili flakes.  The one with chili flakes was my personal favorite and made the brisket that much better.  (Although ""Kobe"" and ""Brisket"" pretty much make that dish worth trying anyway)I couldn't eat more than two pieces without feeling like a bloated cow (Yes, I felt like a cow that would be considered ""kobe"").Full Slab of St. Louis Ribs: I have never been a big rib fan, but these were right in between the tender and meaty debate that every rib person loves to talk about.  They didn't fall off the bone with one little wiggle of the rib, but they didn't stay on the bone after one bite.  basically, the perfect rib.  The smoke ring on each rib goes to show the type of commitment Q has to cranking these babies out.  The best part was the presentation, as I have never seen a plate of ribs that actually has all of the ribs on the plate.  This one had about  three ribs on each side hanging over, begging us the eat them first.We also ordered the Pulled Chicken Sandwich.  The chicken was a blend of pulled white and dark meat and the bun held up very nicely to any sauce that was applied to it.Two side items were had to try included the Mac and Cheese and the Coleslaw.  The Mac and Cheese is loaded with breadcrumbs, and my sister who absolutely hates all things cheese actually ate it and enjoyed it!  The Coleslaw was addicting and hard to stop eating as well.For dessert, (and yes we were about to hurl but since three of us were guaranteed a dessert, might as well gorge ourselves) we chose the Key Lime Pie, the Milk and Cookies, and the Carrot Cake.Key Lime Pie: Plenty of taste and nothing beats a homemade graham cracker crust, but the slice was kind of small compared to every other item this kitchen cranks out.  I was expecting a ""Gibson-sized"" slice of pie.  My hips were happy, my eyes were not.  The pie was still great and I would probably order this again.Carrot Cake: A thick layer of cream-cheese frosting always makes me happy, and this cake had that and more.  The cake itself was kind of dry compared to every other carrot cake I've tried, but the frosting was spot-on.Milk and Cookies: the three cookies I believe were a oatmeal with bacon, a sugar cookie with caramel, and chocolate chip. After about five minutes all three of them had been magically consumed.Service deserves an A+ as our plates and silverware were replaced before each course.  The only negative was the policy on no free refills of soda.  Our water glass was never left empty though!"
"I had the pulled pork sandwich which was excellent and the portion size was huge. We also tried the hush puppies for an appetizer which was great. With your meal, you get free pickles and sweet potato chips which were awesome. The restaurant itself has a vintagey homey feel and was very welcoming. I don't know how much more you would want in a dining experience. 5 Stars."
"Love this place!  Favorite go to restaurant in Chicago!  Great food and customer service!  Try the baby back ribs, carolina mustard, & fried green tomatoes!"
"Service was good. When I went it was packed so we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated, but it's not like burning through 45 minutes is difficult on the near north side. When they seated us they gave us chips and pickles. Chips were okay, pickles were AMAZING. I don't remember how they were made, but they were really good. And having food while you wait for your appetizer/main course is always a plus.We were originally seated outside, but when it started raining the staff immediately made accommodations for us to move inside--greatly appreciated.The 1 star off is for the main course. The food itself is amazing: ribs were great and I've never had cornbread this good, also having the 4 sauces was nice. But, the portion size is ridiculous. I'm pretty sure I got more coleslaw than ribs...the side dish is way too big."
OMG! This place is awesome! I went here with my girlfriend on a Saturday and were lucky to get a table. Our server was Sarah and she was terrific. She was quick to answer any questions we had and was fast with the drinks. Always a plus. Lol. The food was so good. Pork was super tender and the different sauces were great. I tried fried green tomatoes for the first time and they were really good. We stayed until midnight and it was packed the whole time so they must know what they are doing. If you like BBQ then you want to check this place out!
Kobe Chopped Brisket Sandwich is awesome!!  Friendly bar seating and warm tall tops if you are up for more casual seating.
"I've been here at least 5-6 times since it has opened.  What a long overdue treat to get a great, reasonably-priced restaurant with a great atmosphere in the gold coast area.  And BBQ no less!  Having been here several times and having tried a lot of different things, here are some thoughts:(1) You do not need to spend a lot of money here.  The pulled pork platter is $14 and comes with a TON of pork.  I've ordered this at least 3 times and left happy and overly full every time.  It's delicious.  They also have these ""q2"" and ""q3"" platters that are more than enough food for 2 people.  The q3 platter is $27 and comes with two pulled meats, a half slab of ribs, and cornbread and fries.  You can order just that for two people and they are totally cool with it.  They also bring endless (and delicious) chips and pickles that you can fill up on.   (2) The baby back ribs are delicious.  And I am very picky about ribs.  I haven't had the St. Louis ribs here.  I tried the ""competition"" ribs once, which are about $10 more than the regular ribs, and I didn't think it was worth the extra money.  I like the hot sauce that comes with the ribs.  It isn't that hot, but it's really really good.  I do agree with some other reviewers who have commented that the other sauces are just so-so.(3) MIscellenous - The braised greens are really good, as is the cornbread and the wings appetizer.  My wife has gotten the hominy salad a few times as her entree and she really likes it.  I splurged and got the mint julep last time I was there, and it was really good, if you're into that sort of thing.  As a general matter, they have a really nice collection of scotches and tequilas.  (4)  Service.  The service here is always and uniformly awesome.  THe managers/owners do a terrific job of motivating the employees to make everyone feel welcome.  The front desk people, the bar tenders, the waiters, bussers, everyone - even when we come in on a Friday night without a reservation and just split the q3 platter!  This place really has all the elements of a great restaurant.  We're really really happy to have it in the neighborhood."
"4.5 for the food, 4 for the ambiance and 2 for the service.  Not what I would expect in this price range.I took my girlfriend there for her birthday.  When I made the reservation they asked if there was any special occasion I was celebrating and I told them.  I was expecting they asked because they were planning on bringing out a dessert for her and wish her happy birthday or even putting a little card on the table like they do at some nice restaurants.  The fact that they did nothing was just a small let down in a series of them at this place.Our waiter was not good.  It took forever for us to be able to order our food and drinks.  After 5-10 minutes he stopped by and apologized and said that he would be with us soon.  He was one of the least attentive waitstaff I have ever had.  We had to ask for the wet towels at the end because we were already paying our bill, they were nowhere in sight and our hands were sticky.The food was good and I love a good barbecue.  If you do go be sure to get the sampler starter and make sure it includes the beef brisket.  I actually prefer it in the chopped up form that comes with the starter rather than the main dish.All said, I would much rather go to Fat Willy's and get equally good barbecue, with much better service at a lower price."
"We went on a recent weekend evening.  We had made reservations and sat outside in the smallish, somewhat cramped outside dining area fronting on Dearborn.  It was a nice evening to sit outside. Shortly after we were seated we were presented with plates of barbecued potato chips and pickles (!).  The chips were very good and, we reluctantly, declined the restaurant's offer, to provide more.  Service was efficient.  The barbecued baby-back ribs were very good (meaty, fall-off the bone good) as was the pulled chicken.  A nice touch was to provide 4 different barbecue sauces for the table.  The Kobe baked beans are also recommended.  The wine list was larger than I thought it would be and there was also an interesting bourbon flight to choose from.  Portions are large and it would difficult not to walk out without feeling stuffed.  We would return."
"I can't say enough good things about this place. There's real bang for your buck - the food is excellent, and the decor is sophisticated, but there are some really reasonably priced menu items. The level of service is much higher than what you would expect for the price. The free chips they give everyone are the perfect blend of tangy and sweet. Everything my bf and I have tried here is delicious! Its a gem!"
"One word ... Delicious ! And resonably priced to boot ! My husband and I have been here three times now in a matter of a few months and it is consistently good. The BBQ is of course amazing, but the sides (mac and cheese, buttermilk mashed potatos, and two types of corn bread) are delicious as well. Plus you get free homeade BBQ potato chips and sweet pickles. Um yum, what's not to like (except for maybe the two pounds you'll gain stuffing your face LOL)"
"Sophisticated bbq with a reasonable price tag.  ahhhh-mazing!  They give you pickle chips and potato chips dusted in cinnamon as nibblers, I had to restrain myself from eating all of the chips.  We ordered the hush puppies with the spicy dipping sauce and they were marvelous, it was a sad moment to see them all gone.  I am not much of a meat eater so I ordered the bbq chicken sandwich with the poblano cheddar cornbread.  Let me warn you, THE SANDWICHES ARE HUGE!!!  I ate about 5 bites of that tender chicken and had to stop because I wanted to hold out for dessert.  Also, it is brilliant that they give you 4 different types of bbq sauce to try with your food; I like having options...  My only complaints are that the cornbread was not all my heart had hoped for (but it was good enough), I ordered a cocktail instead of one of the great beers they offer, and that I did not get the cookies and milk; these are all errors I plan on correcting the next time I frequent this gem.  (this will probably be pretty soon).  Service was fantastic, the ambiance is refined but welcoming (felt like I was at a southern country club with the Kennedy family eating in the private dining room next to our table), and the whole meal was less than $40.  Yes, you read that right...."
"I had heard so many good things that perhaps my expectations were too high. We were greeted & seated by a friendly hostess. Service from then on was a bit slap-dash. Waiter was fine, busser was a bit clumsy. It was a Tuesday evening, so perhaps the staff was being trained. Maybe the ""A"" team appears on weekends. Homemade chips and sweet pickles were delicious. The special limeade cocktail was refreshing. The pitcher was just the right serving for two. My lemon shrimp were quite tasty. The competition style St Louis Ribs - we split a full rack - were moist and came right off the bone. But even with the choice of 4 sauces we were each left thinking ""What's the big deal?"" Glad I went, but doubt I would return"
"Alright I'm giving this place 3 stars not because it wasn't good, but because this ""award winning"" BBQ was double the price of other places that I've been to with outstanding BBQ.  I had the pull chicken sandwich and my friends had the competition style ribs and both were very very delicious, but the price was just a bit too much.  For me BBQ doesn't mean it gets more expensive just because someone won some awards for their rub and BBQ style.  Overall a delicious meal, but if you're looking to spend too much for BBQ this is the place."
"Whenever a restaurant puts bbq potato chips and bread & butter pickles on the table when you arrive, you know that it is gonna be good!I went here on a Saturday evening with two other people.  We didn't know what to get and the server was extremely helpful.  We ended up sharing the q3 with pulled pork, brisket and st. louis style ribs. We also got honey butter cornbread, french fries and bacon cheddar hush puppies.  All of the bbq meats were delicious and had a great smoke flavor.  The ribs were by far the best, with a dry rub and falling off the bone!  Corn bread and fries were also wonderful.  I felt the hush puppies could have been more flavorful.  I didn't really get the bacon/cheddar flavor.The service was awesome!  Extremely attentive, maybe sometimes too attentive. The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because it is pretty expensive for what you get.  Almost $7 for 5 hush puppies...."
"Solid BBQ! The competition ribs are amazing! My mouth is watering just thinking about it...if it wasn't so cold, I would make the trip up there."
"A great pick if looking for a nicer sit down BBQ joint. The food was great, not outstanding. The best BBQ I've had in Chicago was Smoque. What's missing at Smoque however is the atmosphere. Our waiter John - amazing knowledge of the food and the chef and her passions. The bourbon mixed drinks refreshing but whoa powerful. We had the kobe beef and st. Louis ribs. I'm a pork ribs fan and they were delicious. The kobe a little dry but flavorful. Braised greens......who knew they could be so flavorful...I couldn't stop eating them. Had to pass on dessert, although if I had room the rhubarb cobbler looked amazing. No wait - made a reservation and we were seated immediately! Try it out"
"I wanted to like Chicago Q, mostly because this part of town needs some good BBQ.  Based on a late lunch this afternoon, however, I doubt this spot will make it.  The upsides - a pretty dining room and friendly staff (at least on this visit); great house-made pickles and chips served when you sit down; a very tasty array of sauces (two of them are actually BBQ sauce, one is ketchup, and the fourth I couldn't really identify); and a hot towel for cleanup after a meal that's mostly eaten with fingers.  The downsides - for starters, lunch time prices.  Even in the Gold Coast, you ought to be able to get a lunch entree for under $10, but there are no BBQ entrees at that price point.  I tried the classic burger (9.75), which was served with the aforementioned sauces and some fries.  The fries were piping hot,  and looked freshly cut, but alas not very crisp on the outside.  As for the burger: cooked precisely medium as requested, tender, but lacking in flavor.  If there was any seasoning here, it escaped my attention.  Adding BBQ sauce helped.  Service was friendly but I still don't understand why (in a deserted restaurant) it took more than 5 minutes to get the requested mayo.  I'd suggest a couple of strategies for this spot:  1)  Address the shortcomings on the food mentioned by others.  2) At lunch offer a different sandwich each day on special at 9.95 including a nonalcoholic beverage; and a full entree (not a sandwich) for 11.95. 3) Try some signage out front so people know what they will find inside."
I enjoyed q! It was nice to try a BBQ restaurant in the Gold Coast that also didn't cost an arm and a leg! That of course is if you don't get a Whole Pork Shoulder! That will cost you $305.00! I had the Kobe Chopped Brisket sandwich with Poblano Cheddar Cornbread. I like my meal but I like my wife's better! She was wise and got the Pulled Pork Shoulder. The pulled pork was very tasted. They have three types of BBQ sauces to try. I like them all and they were all good however they were not the best BBQ sauce I have ever had either. The service was great! Our waiter was very helpful and the our water was always being filled. I really enjoyed the homemade chips and bread & butter pickles they brought out before our meal. Be careful not to eat to much though. The meal is pretty filling!
"Very pleased with the service and atmosphere. Crowded on a Thurs night, and we weren't seated until 20 min after our reservation, but Q gave us a sincere apology and 2 free apps, which more than made up for the inconvenience in my mind. Had a good beer/wine/cocktails list. As far as the menu, I was a huge fan of the shrimp and grits, and the pulled pork. I'm normally not a big fan of South Carolina mustard BBQ sauce, but thought that Q's was really good. Everything else we had (fried green tomatoes, St Louis ribs, other BBQ sauces) were solid and hit the spot. I'd definitely return to Q for my next BBQ craving."
"Chicago Q taking BBQ to the next level!Atmosphere: I had no idea what to expect before walking into q. I was thinking it would be a typical bbq joint, with picnic like wood tables, etc. Yeah, it is quite the opposite. Q has got to be the nicest BBQ place I've ever been too. from the chairs to the decor, very minimal, but very elegant! I was especially blown away by one of their private dining rooms, the Wine Room. Amazing doesn't being to describe it!Service: We had Rachel our first night and she was tremendous! Very nice and had a great sense of humor! She checked up on us a few times, chatted with us, and overall all made the whole experience very memorable!Food: OMG their competition ribs are mind blowing! The first night I was here, I had the competition St. Louis ribs, the Competition Baby Back, the regular half slab baby back and the regualr half slab of st. louis. In addition, our table ordered Mac & Cheese, mash potatoes, cole slaw, green beans and corn bread. To start off, their competition ribs are just amazing, especially the St. Louis Comps. They are super moist and very flavorful! And their mac & cheese definitely hit the spot. A little crunchy on top, rich and cheesy in the middle, my favorite. On the second night I was here, we found out they had...wait for it...KOBE BEEF RIBS and KOBE BEEF BRISKET! We came back the second night in a row just for these two! Let me start off by saying that until you've had kobe beef, simply describing the rich, juicy texture does it absolutely NO justice. After inhaling 1 rib, I felt like having a heart attack! AND IT WAS GREAT! The meat came right off the bone and was soo easily swallowed that biting was effortless. I'm salivating as I'm writing this...Price & Portion:  While this place is not cheap like other bbq joints, the quality of food and the amount you get easily justifies the prices here. In fact, I'd be willing to pay a little more just to taste the amazing kobe ribs again....mmmmmmOverall: Great staff, awesome sous-chef Roberto, Amazing foood! I LOVE THIS PLACE. PERIOD"
"food is fantastic and very reasonably priced! great environment, loved the low key yet classy atmosphere."
"Went here with my sister last week. Was a bit surprised when we walked up, It definitely doesn't look like a restaurant from the outside. I thought the inside was so cute, reminded me of cottage. I love restaurants that steer away from the typical pre-dinner bread and butter, so kudos for serving delicious pickles and bbq chips. We started off with the pimms cup and ginger fizz. The ginger fizz was a tad strong on the bourbon. Got the bacon cheddar hush puppies, super yummy and they serve it with a spicy mayo-like dip. I got the pulled pork and sister got the brisket sandwich. Pulled pork was great and trying the different sauces was fun. Sister wasn't too big of a fan of the brisket, she was looking for more of a shaved texture rather than chunks/pieces. We got our leftovers wrapped, but wish they would have wrapped the sauces as well! Overall, good food and good service."
"I feel a little like the kid in the children's' story ""The Emperor's New Clothes.""  PEOPLE! THIS IS NOT GREAT BARBECUE!!  The place is exceptionally beautiful- fantastic building, decor, and ambiance. The chips and pickles on the tables and the guy who promptly refills the dishes as you stuff your faces...great.  But, the BEST part of a meal shouldn't be the beginning!!  The food was ok.  And that's an average between the ribs that were good- not great- and the brisket sandwich that was inedible. Pulled pork was more than could be eaten on a bun but mixed in were pieces so tough and dry. It was like eating fish with bones- hard to enjoy because you're having to pick thru and risk having something unchewable in your mouth. (The tough parts weren't that wonderful crispy crust of real BBQ- just hunks/chards of dried out end pieces.)  Flavors were weak- sauces were anything except bold-very one dimensional and not the complex flavors of well made sauce. Portions were HUGE but really a lot of something that's not great is still not great.  IF YOU GO: Portions are large enough to share 1 plate w 2 ppl. Avoid the brisket- the words Kobe and BBQ don't go together. Brisket on platter was fair to okay- chopped brisket on sandwich was left behind after 2 bites by the big man who eats anything.  Never saw that before. IF YOU WANT BARBECUE: Go to Smoque or Lillie's or hop the train to Lagrange and eat at Que. You wont find candles or cloth napkins and you'll have to order at a counter. We don't know which one of these places has the best meat and sides so we'll keep going back to Lillie's, Smoque, and Que(Lagrange)  til we figure it out."
Love this place so much my fiancé and I are contemplating having our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding.  To start they give you amazing homemade pickles and potatoe chips.  The hominy and corn salad is great with a slight smokey and spicey flavoring. The pulled chicken sandwhich is a great meal and plenty of food even without the generous side that it comes with.  Just once did we have the courage to sample desserts and they were all huge and delicious.  I have heard they have a seasonal key lime pie that is supposed to be phenomanal as well.
"Yum, yum, yum.  I went here on a whim with a friend of mine the other night.  It was a nice sunny evening and we wanted to do some al fresco dinning.  We stopped in at Chicago q and was seated quickly without a reservation.  The server was pleasant and the service was fast.   They start you off with pickles and BBQ chips.... all I can say is ""you had me at BBQ chips.""   The chips had great flavor and a nice crunch.  The pickles were fantastic.   The corn bread is to die for and the mac and cheese was, pretty much, a religious experience.  I loved my pulled chicken sandwich and I liked that I got to try all of the different BBQ sauces they had available.   I will be going back.... oh yes,I will be going back."
"Meh is right. It's early Friday night and I am going to take the mister out to dinner. We walk pass Chicago Q and there's no line outside. The valet guys are all standing around gawking at whatever female goes by. I'm thinking no problem. We walk in and the Host is very nice and asks how many? ""I say 2, I hope we don't need a reservations."" I can see several empty tables. Host says, 'i can seat you, but you have to be out in an hour and half?"" Seriously? Or you have to wait 2 hours. Right then and there i should have turned around and walked out. Wow! I'm like,  ""OK, we'll take our chances.""  We wanted to see if there was better BBQ then having to drive all the way out to Smoque since we live in the 'hood. Starters were a nice touch. Bread and butter pickles, yummy, and the chips with the BBQ seasoning were great. The second bowl of chips were nasty. Probably what they serve when you ask for seconds. They were overcooked, bitter tasting and were much darker. We ordered the Onion Rings, Hush puppies and split a dinner item of the 1/2 slab baby back ribs and pulled pork with cole slaw. The onions rings were OK. To me they could have been cooked longer and most were missing batter. They serve them with a sour cream dill sauce. i didn't like the combo, but I dipped  the rings in the chipotle sauce that came with the hush puppies that were good. Main course was meh, OK. Came with a plate of different sauce. The regular BBQ sauce was way to sweet, the mustard one tasted like honey mustard and the only one i liked was the spicy sauce, but it too was overly sweet.  The meat was typical BBQ fair, nothing out of this world, but it was edible. I prefer a little more smoke in my pulled pork. Ribs were ok. I still like Smoque better."
"I went here on a double date during Restaurant Week, and it was amazing!  The highlights:Food: Best comfort food I've eaten in Chicago.  The hush puppies and onion rings are my personal faves.  Service: Our waiter, Edwardo, was delightful.    Price: Very reasonable for an upscale restaurant. I will definitely be visiting Q again soon!  I'm already craving the hush puppies......"
"We dined here for the first time and more than likely won't be back.  The food was average and slightly over priced.  Fun sauces. My wife had the espresso brittle ice cream which I tried because she said it was fantastic.  It was.  I appreciated the many gluten free items.  Our server, Jonathon, was on top of his game and gave us enough attention but didn't hover of us.  Good beer selection."
"Love. I don't even love BBQ and I loved this place. The atmosphere was very lively and the food was unique. The meat is served dry with 3 unique sauces on the side, yum! Great place for groups."
"What a tasty little joint! Okay, not really a joint... actually it's quite lovely inside but not at all quiet - be prepared to shout a bit because the acoustics and clamor of other diners is a bit overwhelming.  But don't let a little noise spoil a good meal - just be prepared going in knowing that it's not the place for a quiet, romantic meal.  Hey, on the upside, you probably won't be the loudest person in the room!I don't normally seek out bbq but we were in town for the weekend and the bf has mentioned a craving for good bbq on previous trips.  So.... off to Google I went where i quickly discovered several options but the concept of upscale bbq (that accepts reservations) caught my eye.  The menu and online reviews were intriguing and I booked us a table.We arrived a smidge late for our reservation and they were ready for us - we were promptly taken to our table and attended to by a flurry of servers and managers ready to help us get settled.  Throughout the night service was wonderfully attentive but not overbearing.  Our server (Odessa) obviously knew the menu well and guided us towards appropriate selection for our palate.  We started with onion rings and then ordered baby back ribs w/slaw and kobe beef ribs w/mac n cheese for our entrees.  The onion rings were yummy - nicely breaded, not stringy but big, fat rings, cooked well, and served hot with a side of habanero dressing.  We weren't too fond of the dipping sauce (the dill threw me off) and opted for a side of ketchup - hey, it worked.  The kobe beef ribs were definitely the star of the show with a small amount of fat to give good flavor without being overwhelmingly rich, not too smoky, nicely balanced, didn't need sauce but they give you 3 options to try if you want to dip.  The babyback ribs were a little dry, especially in comparison to the kobe but still held their own.  The cole slaw was tasty and the mac n cheese was fine.  You'll have to forgive me, I compare all mac n cheese to what I consider the holy grail (Bouchon) and this didn't compete - but I've yet to find one that does... it's really unfair! The complimentary bread and butter pickles were tasty and fresh and the homemade potato chips seemed a little overcooked.  I did manage to pick out a few chips that didn't seem burned and they tasted like they had been sprinkled with bbq spices or something similar which was quite nice.We wrapped up with a slice of carrot cake and coffee/tea and then retreated upstairs to watch football and have a nightcap.Overall a wonderful night, I can't adequately describe the excellent service we received from everyone - they were all so very gracious and happy to help.  If we lived in Chicago I suspect this joint would become a regular in the dining rotation."
"Love it.  Must admit that the first time we tried this place, they just opened, and service was poor.  Went back this week to give it another try, and was very pleased.  Honest, tasty BBQ (I went to school in NC, and consider myself a BBQ expert), inexpensive, and fantastic atmosphere (whether just out for dinner or to watch a game in the bar area).  Also very accommodating for kids.  Happy to add this to our Gold Coast top five."
"I ate here on Thanksgiving Day, and it was great.  While they had a traditional Thanksgiving Day menu offered, I ended up ordering off the regular menu.  The quality of the food and presentation was great.  I mean, who offers four different kinds of BBQ sauce with one entree?  The variety was good, the atmosphere was nice, and the staff were all super friendly, even if they were working on Thanksgiving Day."
"Definitely will return here. Went in December for my boyfriend's birthday. We had great waitstaff that was very accommodating to my *ridiculous* allergies. I love the feel of the place, which is both fancy and relaxed. We even got a tour of the upstairs and the smokers after dinner. On to the food. Be careful with your appetite, because they give you complimentary bowls of house-made chips and pickles (both very yummy) and do not hesitate to refill them. As an app, I had the hominy salad, which was okay if not that flavorful and a little too cold. We both had the combo plates- I had ribs and chicken, he had ribs and pulled pork. The portions are gigantic and the meat is delicious. We loved all the sauces too. Overall it was a good experience. I kind of wish the menu was a little bigger or more varied, but this is a place for bbq, and they do it VERY well."
"We have been back to q for a 2nd time and have also ordered carry-out on 2 occasions, the BBQ has remained consistant and excellent......"
"This place is fantastic! The breadth of their smoked meat selections is only surpassed by the richness of their incredible bbq sauce. The staff is attentive, but genuinely seem to want to be there. The beer selections is impressive, but lacks certain local favorites. I highly recommend the competition baby back ribs, as they truly deliver on flavor and tenderness. The corn bread is out of this world, and literally melts in your mouth, not crumbles! Overall a great experience, and outrageous meats!"
"I have been here a couple of times when visiting the Windy City, and it does not disappoint. Tip: Make a reservation, it fills up quickly. The service is top notch and super friendly. Not sure what you want? They offer suggestions and are happy to swap it out if you prefer something else. Great drinks menu, and the sides are delish. Shout out to the pickles and the mac and cheese. Oh gah, I think I need another trip soon back to Chicago..."
"I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review! My husband and I took some friends here as a thank you for helping with our wedding. It was a rainy cold Sunday in November and the place was half full. Needless to say the service was amazing! (but not overwhelming) The Kobe beef brisket was even more amazing, tender and juicy still : ) We got a sampler platter for an app with different sauces, all were great. When we finished dinner, the manager came over and asked how everything was. We started chatting and before you know it, we were getting a tour of the kitchen and the smokers- and let me tell you- spotless!!!! Thanks Q- we will be back : )"
"This is the cutest little place, still with a high-end feeling without the terribly high costs.  They serve bread and butter pickles while you wait for your meal which are amazing.  I had the smoked half chicken, which may have been the best chicken I have ever eaten, no joke.  We also ordered the mac and cheese which looked amazing at the table next to us, but was only so-so in my opinion.  My bf had ribs and 2 types of meat, which he seemed to enjoy as well.  All in all I give this place big thumbs up.  Make sure to make a reservation tho, we waited for a table outside for about 35 minutes on a Tuesday night."
"Food ok.. BBQ is hard to master but should be mastered if you are a BBQ restuarant. This place has not mastered it yet. Usually, you can smell BBQ cooking and you couldn't here which was weird to me. The ribs were good but not great, the corn bread dry, and the fries left something to be desired. The portions were large so I suggest sharing an appetizer and an entree. Overall I would go back but may try something else."
"I cannot tell you how great this place is everytime I go there.  Thursday night, party of 7 and the chef took the time to give us a tour of the kitchen which was great.  Of course the food is the best and the atmosphere unbelievable.  This is probably my 10th time there and I continue to take clients and friends.  A great place for any reason and I highly recommend."
"Had great experience here. Great beer selection, and even better BBQ. Neat atmosphere with very good and well-informed server. Only minor complaint, if one at all, is the sheer number of people stopping by to check on the meal and how things we're going. YES! It's great, please stop asking :)"
"Yum! Q is a refreshing take on comfort food with the trendiness of the Gold Coast.  I would go back just for the corn bread!  Don't forget to ask about their brunch specials- I had the chicken eggs benedict and it was delicious! The outdoor seating is adorable, it feels like a lake house porch.  As a bonus they bring out chips and pickels for the table! The reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because their soda is served in 8 oz non-refillable bottles.  This isn't Europe- when I order a soda I expect free refills and I definitely don't expect to pay $3 for EIGHT ounces of diet coke.  Stick with an alcoholic drink or the iced tea."
"This atmosphere is not what you would expect of a bbq joint, with white tablecloths and an ""upscale feel"". We ate at the bar, and the bartender was awesome, very helpful and courteous. For sides, we tried the mac and cheese (I was super disappointed after all the hoopla in these reviews, it's just average liquidy mac and cheese) and 2 different types of cornbread (FYI an order of cornbread is gigantic, kind of dry, and I don't think the flavors between the two types were very unique). To dine we split the ""competition"" st. louis ribs. These were cooked perfectly, fell right off the bone, and were very delicious. The total order was a ton of food. I'd return and just stick to the meat."
Fabulous BBQ. Nothing more to say. Yes the building is cool and the decor is wonderful and the service is spot on but at the end of the day it's just some really good BBQ. You can taste the care that goes into this food - the sauces seemingly simple but each unfolds slowly on the palate revealing it's complexity. The smoke is neither overpowering nor timid. Smoked grape tomatoes on the salad? Sublime.  A decent whiskey list with some gems that might go unnoticed by the dilletante rounds out a great experience
"Upon stumbling past the old Tsunami restaurant, I discovered Chicago Q; a contemporary finer dining BBQ restaurant. I first thought, I will come back,but decided to venture in. I found not only the staff to be extremely attentive, but absolutely found the food to be phenomenal. Get this........Honey buttered cornbread, Kobe baked beans, St Louis Ribs, etc. This restaurant is moderately priced for what you are getting. They make their own sauces and am just in love. In addition, they have a remarkable whisky list and make delicious Mohitos. Highly recommended. Food and atmosphere is superb."
"Amazing, wonderful, delicious!Q is perfect addition to the Chicago. Virginia native Leanne is an amazing chef and has the perfect take on BBQ. Must be the womans touch.The atmosphere at Q is warm and welcoming. The food is even better.Ginger fizz cocktail, bacon cheddar fritters, pulled pork sandwich, cornbread, and oh! The pickles.Just go there and enjoy!"
"After reading other Yelp reviews, I had to try the Mac and Cheese!    WOW!  Truly the best Mac and Cheese my lips have ever tasted!  I loved the free bread and butter pickles and home made chips, salsa and chips will never taste the same. I tried the Beef Brisket with the Poblano Cornbread, my wife had the pulled pork. The Cornbread was delicious, the brisket was a little dry. The pulled pork was very good and I enjoyed the slaw. Each meal comes with four or five sauces for self indulgent, all were very tasty. I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars. The service was a 5 out of 5."
"I recently went here for dinner and just loved it!  The decor reminds me of an old Southern plantation house and the food is delish.  We had a large group and tried almost everything.  Favorites included: Kobe Beef Ribs (they are HUGE so get an order to share for the table), Pulled Pork Sandwich, St. Louis Ribs, Mac & Cheese and Cornbread.  The barbecue comes out with 3 different sauces on the side - I was surprised to find a loved the vinegar-based barbecue sauce.  This place is great for a large group, or, for when parents are in town!"
"I have been here twice - the first was the weekend around Valentines Day.  We reservations and a big group - we were sat about 45 minute late, our food took about an hour to come out - taking too long seemed to be the name of the game that night.  But thankfully, the manager apologized multiple times, gave us free desserts and a few bottles of wine.  All was forgiven.Then, my husband and I were here on a Friday night and sat on the patio - once again, it look a long time to get our food, a long time to get a glass of wine, and a long time to get our check and pay.  I do attribute it to one server for the whole patio - while not her fault, she should have had some help.The food is good here - I think the prices are very reasonable for the neighborhood; if it weren't for those two, Q would be getting a lower rating from me.   I just wish they worked on their timing."
"All I have to say is try the Competition Baby Back Ribs, a little bit pricey but well worth the price.  They where amazing.  Also the platter with Pulled Pork, Chicken and Kobe beef was great."
"Probably some of the best BBQ I have ever had.  If you come here, you better come hungry, the portions are really big.  The service was really great also, ask for Amber.  Overall,  an awesome experience."
"This was the final stop for Restaurant week and it was definitely the best for last!  The evening started off with pickles & BBQ chips that were brought to the table--was not expecting that and they were so addicting we were concerned about spoiling our dinner!For the official appetizer we were all going to get something different and share, but once we saw the shrimp & grits brought over to the table next to us, we all wanted that dish and it was a good thing we all ordered it because none of us would have shared it!For the entree, we each got something different: the kobe brisket (mine), the baby back ribs and the St. Louis ribs.  We each had a different side: the poblano cheddar cornbread, the honey butter cornbread and the coleslaw.  We all shared a taste of everything and it was all phenomenal!  They also brought 4 different sauces and I especially love the spicy BBQ.For dessert, we each ordered a different dessert as well: the key lime pie, carrot cake and the cookies and milk (for which you order 2 of the 3 cookies available...but they ended up giving us one of each for the full tasting without us asking!) .  Of all the desserts, the carrot cake was by far the best!  Rumor has it that it's the recipe from the chef's grandmother...if that had been my grandmother's recipe growing up, I would be 50lbs heavier!We each took home a doggie bag of leftovers which included them giving us our pick of a BBQ sauce to take home with the leftovers.  I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow night!I will definitely be going back here and will not be waiting until next year's restaurant week to indulge!"
"So close to a 5 star rating, but I think the Kobe Beef Ribs are a tad over-rated, so if I could, I would give it 4.5 stars. Decor: Appealing and comfortable. Reminded me of a newer steakhouse venue, but with a casual flair. Service:  Fantastic - from the hostess that greated us, to our waiter - Matthew, to the two different MODs that came by to see how we were enjoying our meal; everyone was great and sincere. Meal: Very good. They give you homemade pickle chips and homemade potato chips that are NOT greasy. Nice starters for your palate. We ordered the Kobe Beef Ribs with braised greens and a side of corn bread.  The BBQ or smoked flavor was great, but the meat was not as spectacular as I had hoped/expected or the price ($35) would have you believing. Wish we got the Kobe brisket, instead. Oh, well. It was still good. Three big ribs with a decent amount of meat, but not the pound of meat that our waiter had told us. But, that's ok, because we made up for it with dessert. The two BBQ sauces were tasty - did not care for the Carolina vinegar (3rd flavor) - not sure if that's what it is called, but it tastes like vinegar. Braised greens were good. Huge portion.  Corn Bread had good flavor, but was dry. Portion was adequate. Could definitely improve the texture/moisture.Though we were full, when we heard that their desserts are all homemade and made onsite, we decided we had to try the apple pie w/ cinnamon ice cream and the espresso brittle ice cream.  OMG - portions are huge and the desserts were AMAZING. We should have ordered one dessert and split it. The ice creams were fantastic and the apple pie was some of the best I have ever had. Apples were firm and overall it wasn't too sweet.  The cinnamon ice cream was the perfect compliment to the pie. The espresso butter brittle was very good in terms of texture and individual flavors, but I don't know that I would order the combo again.  Oh, we also had french press coffees, which were better than Starbucks coffee, but the beans still seemed over-roasted or slightly burnt. Two final notes: 1) We were told that everything on the menu is homemade except the hamburger buns. 2) The Belgium style beer  was quite tasty."
"Started out great with potato chips & bread & butter pickles, and it only got better.  We tried the hushpuppies, onion rings, BBQ shrimp with polenta & smoked chicken wings for appetizers.  They were all very good, but the wings were a knock-out.  The onion rings were crispy, even when they were no longer hot.  Good dipping sauces on the shrimp, onion rings & hushpuppies.  We ordered a half slab of St Louis style ribs & the pulled pork shoulder.  Both rocked!  The pulled pork is some of the sweetest, juiciest meat I've ever tasted.  They were served with slaw & cornbread and 3 different bbq sauces.  Liked all the sauces.  Didn't eat the sides because I was actually full after the appetizers, but I kept working on my food...For dessert, we tried both the carrot cake (the best we've ever tasted!) and the Derby pie which was also excellent.  Both desserts and most of my pulled pork made it into the doggy bag & were really good the next day, too.The service was pleasant & very attentive.  Beer & cocktails were tasty, and well-matched to the food.Definitely going back to Chicago q!"
"Had dinner here with some friends last night and it was awesome! Service was friendly, food was fantastic, and the space is cool too. Huge portions and it's pretty reasonably priced.We tried the pulled chicken, kobe chopped brisket, pulled pork, and St. Louis and Baby Back style ribs. I'm getting the meat sweats just thinking about it - and that's a good thing. My favorite may have been the St. Louis ribs, but the pulled pork comes in a close second. SOO tender and juicy. Everything comes with their 4 sauces - the spicy BBQ was really nice and had a great kick but you should obviously try them all. The mac n cheese was also outrageously good and the braised greens were really really good too. Corn bread was meh. You could come here for literally anything - dinner with friends, a date, your wedding. This place is a crowd pleaser!"
"I thought it was a little above average but more expensive than some other really great BBQ places.  I got the pulled pork sandwich which was good, but I wasn't a fan of their sauces. I like a little spice but two of their three sauces were a little too spicy and the vinegar-based one tasted like straight vinegar. I think a really good sauce would have made me rate this place higher and even convince me to go back.The Kobe steak was too chewy and not great and the mac n cheese was a little bland. Two things I loved: hush puppies and pickles (I don't know what they soak those things in, but I'm hooked)."
"Scroll down and look for bad reviews....there are none. Best BBQ in Chicago. If you are entertaining out of town guests, this place is a must. The atmosphere is brilliantly done for a BBQ place. You may think white table cloth is way too nice for Barbeque, but the food exceeds the decor at a reasonable price. If your looking for a fun place to go with a group or just on a date, this place delivers."
"My boyfriend & I live in the neighborhood and make it a point to stop in at least once a week and have done so since q opened their doors. Perfect service, amazing food. Never disappointed."
"Q for quality, Q for quantity.  This is one great restaurant!  We did not know what to expect, but the ambiance in this spot is fantastic. A cute bar area in the front with high top tables...walk a little further and a very large, bright, cozy dining space with regular tables, comfortable padded chairs and booths, an open kitchen area. Servers dressed in very nice plaid or checked shirts. Upscale BBQ.  The taste? Delectable. They bring out spicy potato chips and bread and butter pickles to start.  We ordered from the restaurant week menu. Let's just say this was Southern hospitality at it's finest. They did not skimp by giving an alternate, cheaper restaurant week menu or smaller portions. Surely, they will certainly be rewarded for this best foot forward approach with new customers. Our first time there....we will be back! We tried the flight of pulled meats. Every one a winner....LOVED the sauces, all different styles - something for everyone. The original sauce is noteworthy, as are all the rest. The brisket was melt in your mouth tender!!!!  The baby back ribs, great. Loved the BBQ shrimp. Even the french fries were noteworthy. The desserts were very good...with a little tweaking, they could be fantastic. The wait staff should be commended, as each and every one of them was great - they work as a well oiled team - and this is after what I imagine was an exhausting restaurant week. A special shout out to Otha(o?), who could not have been any nicer, or more helpful.There is one other 'Q' to be mentioned...the 'q'ute chef/partner, Lee Ann Whippen. I recognized her because I had researched the restaurant before making a reservation. She is not only pretty, but she was working just as hard in back with her cooks, while also keeping an eye on the house. That hands on management style insures things run smoothly. Q is a restaurant to be added to your list. You will definitely not go away hungry! You will be pleased you gave it a try....because you will want to come back again and again!"
"this place is unique because its a nice, reservation bbq place. so i mean, the food is good...but youre there for the scene, not the bbq. the service was good except they were a little TOO attentive (checking every 3 min) which was irritating but better safe than sorry. good place for groups and the atmosphere is cool. worth checking out."
"I am a fan, and will be back, but I wasn't blown away by it.  I love that they give you chips as a little snack while you are waiting to order, I thought the chips were delicious.  The service was wonderful, so quick I couldn't believe how quick we received our food.  I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with fries.  The fries were SO good, the chicken was a little dry, but with the help of the 3 sauces provided it was good.  We split mashed potatoes, because I heard I had to try them, and they were amazing.  I saw others eating the macaroni and cheese and that also looked amazing.  I thought the atmosphere and service was great, and the food was good, just not amazing to me.  I will definitely go back, because I love barbeque..."
"I can't believe how good this food was! I am not a huge fan of BBQ but this place was very good. All the food we had was fantastic. The hush puppies are to die for.  We had the competition ribs and they were out of this world!  Homemade key lime pie OMG!Chicago is full of BBQ joints but this stands above all the rest.  It's so hard to find a BBQ place that doesn't just slather their meat with tons of sauce.  Here all the BBQ is dry rubbed with the sauce on the side.  You can actually taste the superb quality of the meat and you don't even need the sauce.  My date on the other hand did add sauce, but it was very little.The service was great. Not too pushy and gave us time to enjoy the food and convo and our cocktails were always full. Our waiter Brian was so helpful and knowlegeble about the menu.  You could see that he enjoys his job.  He was attentive but didn't hover. He was friendly, fast and gave excellent service through the whole meal.  I was interested in the idea of upscale BBQ was new to me but now a huge fan and can't wait to come back!"
"Great place to get quality barbeque if you are looking for a nicer night out!The building and decor is really neat, and has classic southern style to really transport you. Was not thrilled with the host - a little pompous since we did not have a reservation - but still they accommodated us nicely. The homemade potato chips and pickles were awesome, especially since we were starving when we got there. We started with the hush puppies -- sooo good! Then I had the pork sandwich and my bf had the kobe beef brisket - we would have gotten the competition ribs, but we weren't looking to spend too much that night; those come highly recommended but are quite pricey. I highly highly recommend the pork, especially for the price. Tender and smokey on a delicious pretzel roll.. the bbq sauces were all also unique and very very tasty - they have a bourbony/rich quality to them and the carolina sauce was different than any other carolina sauce I've tried. My bf loved the beef brisket, but I didn't like it as much - though I'm not a huge beef fan. Overall, our amazing meal came out to $25 a person with a beer, sharing an appetizer, and an entree - a solid deal for such a nice/upscale place."
"Once I got over the idea of an upscale BBQ joint..or should I say restaurant I settled in.  The place has a comfy feel to it..and the wait staff was great.  The floor manager or ""Pit Boss"" ( no pun intended) was very attentive as well.  The complimentary chips were pretty good.  But the sweet pickles stole the show.  Delicious. Now to the meal.  I had the St Louis Half Slab. The meat was really tender but the sauce a little thin.  Rounded off with a tasty cornbread and greens side.  Very filling meal...not sure if it was worth the price though.  Maybe if I had to impress some clients from Kansas City then yeah??!"
"Love it there! Superior Service! Great BBQ, amazing sauces, meat was heavenly! Great Great Great!"
"Went on a Saturday night without a reservation and my husband and I were lucky to get a table right away. We weren't super hungry so we ordered the cheddar bacon hush puppies, a pulled pork sandwich, and mac and cheese. The pork was the highlight of our meal. It was tender and yummy and came on a pretzel bun (with fries). i thought the hush puppies were good (but super dry) and the mac and cheese was a little looser than i like my mac and cheese. our total- with a beer, a cocktail and a coffee was $50 which seemed like a great price for good food and such a busy atmosphere. I'd go here again but i wouldn't consider it to be super amazing."
"If you live in Chicago and haven't gone here, then you're crazy. It's the best BBQ in Chicago. The setting is awesome and the big lit picture on the wall is cool. Start with a dirty martini. The pulled chicken is to die for. YUM!"
"Love Love Love Chicago Q! Chicago Q is a fairly new restaurant in the area and is a great addition to the Gold Coast.  I Love the atmosphere. This restaurant is open till 2:00am on the weekends. I have eaten there at 1:00am, and I have eaten there at 4pm, it doesn't matter what time it is. Its perfect for any occasion at any hour. Chicago q always satisfies my BBQ cravings!  I cannot get enough of this restaurant. After old town fest on Sunday we decided to go to Chicago q for dinner . We walked in with a group of six without making reservations. The restaurant was pretty busy, but the staff was extremely accommodating and quickly pushed two tables together near the TV so the guys could watch the game. Their service  was outstanding. As soon as we were seated the waiters brought over the complimentary pickles and homemade BBQ Chips...  I am obsessed with their pickles. I always eat way too many chips and pickles.. I cannot help it, They are sooo good!! For our entree the girls decided to split the  q3 we chose the Brisket, BBQ ribs and pulled pork. We chose the corn bread for our side( ask for honey to drizzle on your corn bread!) We ordered a side of the baked beans.The baked beans have huge chunks of tender Kobe brisket in its unique sweet and spicy sauce, the baked beans are sooo yummy and its pretty much a meal on its own!!The BBQ ribs were falling off the bone. incredible . I would have to say the Kobe brisket is my favorite and cooked to perfection tender and moist. The q3 was more then enough for three girls. We even had left overs! The guys on the other hand needed more then just the q3 between three of them they ordered the appetizer flight,  chicken wing appetizer and the q3 with 3 sides. We all left super stuffed.  Everyone had a great time!!  This restaurant has consistent great BBQ. I cannot wait till the weather gets a little warmer to sit outside. I am already looking forward to returning to this restaurant!! Next time I am saving room for dessert!"
"LOVED this restaurant. I went there on a short trip through Chicago last week and just had a great meal. The pulled pork was fabulous, especially with the 4 different barbecue sauces they served with it. The pickles and chips which were on the table when I sat down were also very good. I can't wait to return."
"Could this be the best, valued restaurant in Chicago?  Well, if  BBQ is a cuisine of choice, it just might be.  That's a heck of a statement given the reputation and the current perception of the restaurant scene in our city, but let me point out some observations and realities that just might persuade your consideration.High quality organic meats.  Detail in preparation.  Savory tastes from top to bottom of menu.  Exceptional wine pairing list (Zin + BBQ = Fun)  Friendly/knowledgeable staff.  Great ambience.  Deference to the competition.  GREAT value.  Lee Ann Whippen.You're probably like, ""it's only a BBQ place, dude.  Chill out!""Well, you'll have to check it out.   That's all I can really say.  Sur la table:Smoked Dry-Rubbed WingsHominy, Smoked Corn, Black Beans SaladKobe Chopped Brisket Sandwich (ridiculous)Pulled Chicken Sandwich (extremely moist)Honey Butter Corn BreadColeslawHouse Cut FriesKobe Brisket Baked BeansHomemade Cookies (Oatmeal/Bacon, Chocolate Chip, Sugar Maple)"
"The food was amazing! Love that they give you a couple of options to choose from with their bbq sauce. The first time I went there the service was great. The second time, we were such a inconvenience for the waitress to come over to the table. I'm a server myself, so I try not to judge, otherwise it ruins the experience. BUT come on, the bus boy got my drink, she never once checked on us during the meal and you could just tell she could care less about us. I think because my mom didn't want a full meal. Get real. We are the people that pay your bills, you should know better!"
