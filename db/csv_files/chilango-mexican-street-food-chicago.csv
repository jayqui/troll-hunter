Chilango Mexican Street Food
"I wish I would have discovered this place earlier in my time here in Chicago. All the food here is excellent and even though I've never been in the restaurant (as I've only had them deliver to me)  I can say the customer service is excellent!!!! The tacos are great, I've had the shrimp, fish, al pastor, and chicken. Shrimp are my favorite, sooooo good. Empanadas are great I enjoyed the chicken the best but the chicken and mushroom are a close second.My favorite thing to order is the tortilla soup. Its phenomenal!!!!! I usually order 2 or 3 soups, I'll eat one at work and take the other two home for me and my girlfriend later. Also the corn is great, a definite must get. The green cream salsa is my favorite, i always ask them for a few extra because i put it on everything. Thanks Chilango for all the great food!!!!!!"
"I put an order in through yelp, and it never arrived. After an hour and a half later, I called them directly and they said they never received the order. I then ordered again on the phone with them. They quoted me 20-30 minutes, but once again after an hour of it not arriving, I had to call back. The guy on the phone said he was 5-10 minutes away, yet it ended up taking him another 30 minutes. Overall, it took 3 hours and multiple calls to get food from this restaurant.They get 2 stars because the burrito was actually good. If it hadn't, it would have been 1."
"Never been greeted here with anything less than a huge smile and a giant wave of enthusiasm. The food is amazing, especially the pastor, and the service is great to match. I highly recommend this spot if you're craving any Mexican type food, hands down best Mexican food on Taylor street. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner as well, and what can I say. He was so genuine, caring, and passionate about everything chilango. You'd be a fool to not try this place at least once!"
"Came in for a late dinner, place was blissfully quiet and no over-crowded. I got 3 varieties of taco: fish, al pastor & shrimp. Fish was my favorite: crispy outside & delicately flaky on the inside. Came with a mildly sweet sauce that paired nicely with lime juice. Al pastor was flavorful but not necessarily the best I've had. The shrimps were super salty. Wish I found the sauces earlier, guess I'll have to try them next time. We also got horchata which had a strong almond flavor, a bit different from the others I've had but still good & refreshing on a hot summer night. Empanadas seem to be what they're known for so I'll try that next time. For a cafe setting, service was very attentive: multiple servers checked in with us during our dinner. Good solid spot for Mexican!"
"Not bad a bit hot me me, had the  empanda my parents had the steak tacos which they enjoyed. Crowed but it means they are a good stop to eat at"
"One of the best Mexican restaurants I ever tried.  This one is a real jewel, we went there following Yelp reviews and guess what , They are real!!! We tried almost all-Tortilla soup -Empanadas (Meat, BBQ, cheese & spinach) the dough is one of the best balanced I ever tried, perfect, the filling was extraordinary in flavor and texture.- Chicken taco salad - burritos - tacos- elote (sweet corn) really something different and delicious And for desert empanadas , dulce de leche, and Nutela.Overall all plates just right, great service and full of smiles. BTW very good prices"
"This place sort of evolved from empanada place, and I think it was very successful.  I thought this place was definitely better than the other mexican place on Taylor street.I tried al pastor and carne asada.  They were very well cooked and portion was very generous.  it was very tasty and you can totally satisfy yourself below 10 bucks.  My wife's burrito was very tasty, then the portion was too big, that she had to spare half of it for the next day.For sure this will be a go to mexican place around the area."
"Recent lunch trip...excellent tacos and empanadas, worthy of the wait. Tried several delectable menu items, including the Nutella & Banana empanada, Chicken Taco, Fish Taco, and Al Pastor Taco. Nutella Empanada was fantastic; slightly crunchy and packed with melting hot sweet decadence. Fish Tacos were excellent; fresh, lightly breaded, sweet, mildly salty, and perfectly paired with julienned slaw toppings. Al Pastor tacos were solid; jam packed with meaty goodness, very tender, and seasoned well. Chicken tacos were my least favorite, but they were far from revolting. Well-seasoned and soundly married with purple cabbage slaw, but dry and the least pop of any taco. Have no fear, their superb side sauces made up for the arid short comings. Every taco was perfectly executed, extremely well balanced, and visually appealing.  Without a doubt, one of the best non-taqueria taco joints I've been too.Dining in: Small inside, very clean, friendly staff, probably safer off-peak if bringing a crowd."
"Awesome Mexican! Staff was super friendly and helped our group of four pick out some delicious food. Husbands tacos were great, and I loved my chicken taco salad. It had a really good house dressing on it that wasn't too overwhelming. Def recommend this place if you're in the Taylor st area!"
"This is a pretty cool taco place with a hipster vibe to it (Sugar skull and luchador theme). I came here for a snack the other day and ordered a beef taco and al pastor taco. The service was quick and it seemed to have a decent menu for the set up (order-at-the-register style), as there were also empanadas and tortillas. As for my tacos, they were delicious! They don't skimp on the meat, and it's served with just onions and cilantro (which is how I like my tacos). The meat itself for both tacos were succulent and tender.The best part were the three sauces they serve you in squeeze bottles. One is a mild, green avocado sauce. The other is a sweet and possibly soy sauce based(?) peach-colored sauce. The third is a spicy orange-colored sauce. The avocado and sweet sauce are delicious both combined and separate!I just wish I could have tried their horchata (I love horchata in general). It was not being served that day, but they had other choices of juices/drinks."
"I'm a big big fan of Mexican food, and this place has got to be my favorite. Lately one of the specials is the Fish Tacos, if you're considering going to Chilango- a) GO! b) GET THE FISH TACOS! It's a fried little fish strip with veggies and sauces and magic on it. All of the tacos are amazing (I've had fish, chicken, and steak), all of the empenadas are amazing (highly recommend Nutella /Banana) and the juices are to die for (I've tried hibiscus and passionfruit)The passion fruit juice is one of those that makes you wonder where it all went when you reach the end of the cup. I was trying to savor the goodness, but I couldn't stop sipping.I've been here 3 times now, and can't wait to come back."
"After living on taylor street for almost a year now and after hearing so much good about this place finally I went in chilango with bit of high expectations. But I was utterly disappointed by the food here. I ordered the steak burrito and the al pastor taco. Starting with the steak burrito, the quantity of steak was not so much as it was compensated by a lot of cheese and lettuce which affected the taste in a huge manner. The taco was good but not surprising overall it was just ok. I was about to give it 2 stars but the service was exceptionally good so they deserved that third one.At any day I would prefer de pasada or newly opened jarabe on taylor street over chilango"
"Everything is just simply delicious! All their tacos and empanadas are great, you can't go wrong!  Our neighborhood joint!"
"Went back a second time for the taco salad. I also ordered 2 pastor empanadas because I just couldn't resist. Didn't care for the empanadas all that much the second time around. They have a nice flaky crust on the outside, but the filling was pretty bland and over-cheesy. Now for taco salad... We ordered 1 chicken and 1 pastor salad. The overall concept of the salads was good, but they just didn't wow me. They're served in a giant pork rind, which is unique-I suppose, but I was hoping more for that giant unhealthy taco shell you see at most places. At least the meat was tasty and plentiful too. Alas, I'm sticking with my original 3 stars."
"Only for delivery but the food arrived fast, the guy apologized for the wait! Fish taco- bomb! The pickled toppings with cilantro was sweet and tangy at the same time- so yum!!  Beef tacos with corn tortilla yum!! Juicy meat, limes come with your order, I added avocado too, soo tasty!  I definitely need to go to this place and try it."
It is a tiny little hole-in-the-wall restaurant with extremely cramped seating. But don't let that scare you away. The food here is phenomenal. Everything we had was surprisingly flavorful and extremely affordable. The top notch service was a great bonus. I will be back! RATINGS:Chicken taco: 4/5Al Pastor taco: 4/5Chicken empanada: 4/5Chorizo Cheese empanada: 4/5Elotes: 4/5Guava agua fresca: 4/5Service: 5/5Ambiance: 3/5
The empanadas are very nice and they have quite the variety! The staff are nice and the atmosphere is awesome! Give these guys a try you won't be disappointed
"My go-to: A spinach / cheese empanada and shrimp tacos for dinner and the nutella / banana empanada for dessert. Not all tacos and empanadas are created equal at Chilango - so try a few varieties out before you give a review. I'm giving a high rating because I found my jam with these dishes and always order them, but understand some of the lower ratings provided by folks who weren't thrilled with their orders."
I think I might have found my go to taco spot!! Went there with my hubby on Fri night for a quick dinner. I ordered the chicken taco and the fish taco. Hubby ordered two veggie tacos. We also ordered the veggie and the spinach cheese empanadas. The tacos were divine. I loved the chicken and the fish - I cannot decide which I loved more. The chicken came with purple cabbage on top - and thats it. Simple - but oh so loaded with flavor. The fish came with a green salsa/sauce which was heavenly. There was a hint of coconut in it - and I totally loved the flavor profile. Hubby liked the veggie tacos as well. The empanadas were good - I just wish they are baked and not fried. All in all I loved this place and I will be frequenting this joint quite a lot this summer!
"I stopped in while driving by to grab a quick bite. I ordered 2 shrimp tacos to go. The staff seemed very friendly and the dine in area was comfortable to sit in while I waited. When I left I was surprised to see 3 different sauces in my bag with the tacos and they were much appreciated. Each sauce was as good as the one that proceeded it. They were rich, smooth and full of flavor(I tried a little of each per taco. The shrimp went pefect with the toppings and everything tasted super fresh. I will definitely be back soon with a bigger appetite!"
"My family absolutely LOVES this place. Formerly Litos empanadas... I love the fact that they still offer their famous little deep fried bundles of joy here. Ya gotta try their beef & rice... YUMM, they're sooo good!! My boys love their Nutella/Banana Empanada for dessert & My husbands go to is the Burrito. Absolute Perfection!!Great service, decor, location, menu. Not to mention they cater AND offer delivery!! Can't beat it. Only thing I don't like is searching for parking but hey what do you expect it's hot spot TAYLOR street."
"Believe all the hype about the roasted corn! It's sweet, savory, hearty without the mayo overload used by street cart vendors, and charred perfectly.Beef empanada with its raisins, potato and seasoned meat filling are deliciously authentic, and the meat pie's crust is flaky yet substantial. Excellent service; they were so good about checking on us and explaining all the flavors that we were experiencing. Husband had the agua fresca. I usually don't care for agua fresca; it took a great deal of self control not to swipe his agua fresca from him. He did share a few sips, though."
"This is the best place to get a chicken burrito or a fish taco! This is something from a guy that lives in Austin, TX that has tried endless combinations of burritos and tacos from Mexico, the border and Texmex! Also, the people there are always friend and ready to help you. Loving it, it's a shame we do t have one in Austin."
If your ever in the west loop go in and get some great Mexican food. I've tried almost everything on the chalk board menu and they are great.
"If you serve elotes, they will come...I enjoyed the fresh and lighter (compared to regular mexican taco joints) lunch I had here the other day. The elote was delicious and was served nice and simple. I asked them to cut it half and they also speared the cob so you don't have to get your fingers messy. The chips and guac also appeared to be freshly made. I had the taco salad with steak. The portion was large and included a generous portion of avocado and some other toppings like chickpeas and seeds. I didn't care for the fried bowl of whatever it came in. I would have preferred a regular fried or baked tortilla bowl. Also, it was kind of difficult to eat the steak with a fork since it was chopped up so small. The chicken empanada was okay, but I did like the green salsa it came with. I would have liked some more salsas on the side rather than the provided creamy sauces.Service is a little slow since they make everything fresh. So if you are in a hurry, don't expect to be in and out. We had to wait about 10 minutes for our food to come out."
I had the veggie tacos and veggie empanada. Not the best Mexican but good cheap food and at a great location. The staff is amazing and it has a great vibe. The cheese quesidilla was amazing ! .
"I had purchased a set of three Groupons after reading the positive reviews. I went to the restaurant and enjoyed their food. After meeting a friend at the Starbuck's across the street and telling her about the empanadas, I decided to go back and buy some for her with an additional group I had. I went in and the cashier stated that I could not use the Groupon since I was there several hours ago.  She indicated there was ""fine print"" language stating I could only use the Groupon once in 24 hrs. I asked her to show me where it stated this, but clearly there is nothing that states such a thing.  Clearly, I won't be going back here and neither will my friend, who I shared my experience with. I was just trying to get her to try this spot, but I did not appreciate the being treated like I could not read; especially, when i read contracts for a living."
"I love this place one hundred percent- I was so sad when I bought litos was gone forever! The sauces really do it for me, they remind me of home. The portions are really good sized, the quality of the meat is fantastic! The place doesn't look that packed or anything most of the time but I really think it's a little undercover taylor street gem! The champignon and chicken is delicious, al pastor tacos and the fish tacos are so good too! The quesadilla is huge! I've basically never ordered something from here that I didn't think was delicious!"
"I feel a little guilty for admitting that I didn't even realize that this place used to be Lito's, or that Lito's disappeared at all for that matter.  I just stopped in for the first time and am already hooked! I ordered a veggie burrito, per the cashier's suggestion.  Everything tasted pretty fresh and moderately healthy.  I also got some elotes...so good! The sauces they had at the table were also awesome.  The only real disappointment came from the apple and cinnamon empanada I ordered for dessert.  It kind of just tasted like applesauce on the inside. But that definitely won't stop me from coming back.  This place is perfect for UIC students looking to get a solid off-campus meal, or anyone coming from the medical campus.  I'm excited to have a good, quick and cheap place to eat on Taylor!  Now if only there were some actual Italian food in ""Little Italy..."""
"Man ! This place is a killer. Located amongst various other food places, but this place stands out. Whoa, you can go in there and can order in Spanish. Si, en Espanol. The food is fantastic. I am a big fan of Spanish food as it is closer to my native palate and I can tell the difference in the spices that are used in authentic places and in food chains. The menu is moderate sized but a lot of options are available, the food I ordered was spicy ( I requested spicy) and oh, la, la, fantistico !!! If I was living in that area, I would definitely go there every week."
"Great go to place for late evening bite to eat tried the Al Pastor burrito definitely s signature burrito and the ingredients taste so fresh unlike many of the burrito places in the city. Customer service was amazing and you even get advice on putting your hazards on because the police are giving tickets for parking by the bouncers at the nearby bars, I mean what more could you ask for!!!! I'm definitely a new client at this place"
"I got 3 steak tacos w/ avocado for lunch. The tacos were great, even though not very authentic, but taste great! Just be aware that it's very busy at lunchtime so it might take a little bit time to get your food, or sauce. But I would recommend this place for lunch for sure!"
"The steak taco salad was extremely delicious and felt borderline nutritious! I especially liked the unique ingredients like the garbanzos, sunflower seeds, roasted corn, and red lettuce. The steak was stupid tender and juicy. There was soooo much steak too! I ordered for pick up and I was shocked at how big the salad was for 6.99. It came well dressed, but I added both the salsas that were included on top and it was a perfect addition. The people inside were very nice and even proactively offered water to go even tho my wait was practically nonexistent. It was my first time, but I plan on going there next weekend during my break for work."
My favorite lunch place on Taylor Street and that is saying a lot given the great restaurants here. The shrimp taco and the fish taco are the best. The chicken taco salad is also delicious for a healthier option
This place is great! The food is outstanding along with friendly customer service. Must try's Elote Shrimp tacos Tortilla soup Guacamole Fish tacos Passion fruit juice Nothing less then 5 stars & I mean it!
"Its a decent taco and empanada joint,  but doesn't scream 'top of the class' on too many if their items.Setting: Small (25 people or so in occupancy threshold), quick serve, limitied menu (empanadas, tacos,  and a few other assorted items like Taco salad, Guac,  etc.), and good value for $ (2.5 tacos with generous meat portions)Food highlights: Generous meat portions. Al pastor was cooked perfectly, well marinated,  not dry. Steak quality was average. Sauces were good, rich in flavor,  with multiple spice level options. Bbq chicken empanada was mediocre at best - chicken was tough and dry, and it came with stock bbq sauce. Guac portions were small and served in a plastic cup.Service: Limited offering since you order and pay at counter upfront.  But they were very attentive and friendly in bringing out the food, beverages, plateware, sauces,  etc., despite being at near full occupancy. Overall - Good spot for Al Pastor."
"Empanadas are a must. I tried the veggie, been and rice, and bbq chicken and they surely didn't disappoint. I also tried their steak taco and it was good too. Service is prompt and attentive. Highly recommended!!"
Solid burritos and quesadillas and really great empanadas!
"I've been here five times. Each time I've gotten three fish tacos. Each time I've loved the fish tacos. In fact, I'm eating fish tacos right now (this being my 6th time getting three fish tacos). Yes I will be back again soon, and enjoy my fish tacos. No. I will not get anything else except their fish tacos. Jk. Jk. All of their food is great. This place is especially cool since my parents are Chilangos themselves, and El D.F. has a special place in my heart. Great food. Great staff. Great times. Provecho!"
"Fantastic. I had the pastor tacos and the steak tacos. They were both delicious, but the pastor were out of this world! Juicy, tender, sweet, salty, flavorful, OMG. I want more.Everyone in the place was tremendously friendly and pleasant. Service was fast (I took mine to go).They came with sides of green sauce and red sauce. The green was yummy (and very spicy), and (I'm ashamed to admit this) the red was so good that I ate the sauce I had leftover when I was done with my tacos on its own right out of the tiny, plastic to-go cup!Best Mexican I've had in a long time and DEFINITELY the best on Taylor St.Go there. Now."
