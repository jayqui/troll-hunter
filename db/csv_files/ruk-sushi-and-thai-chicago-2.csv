Ruk Sushi and Thai
"Had a very positive experience ordering from this restaurant. So happy they are in my neighborhood. I had a few questions regarding sushi when I called. The sushi chef actually got on the phone to make certain he was making what I'd like, and answered any questions I had. I ordered a snow dragon roll. Delicious. Miso soup delicious....spicy tuna...just ok. But I think they do a lot of things well. Great neighborhood spot. Looking forward to my next meal arriving tonight!"
"I've eaten here (well I've eaten their food, at my house) close to a billion times since they've opened.  I feel confident enough now to say that I love them. Their veggie sushi options are great. (My husband still pines for the sushi we used to get in Wicker Park.)  I think I finally found a place he won't complain about!  My husband was pining for the Hot Pepper Noodles that we used to get a Penny's in Wicker Park (Anyone seeing a trend here?) But neither of us were interested in driving all that way to get it.  So I browsed the menu and saw the Spicy Basil Noodles.  He decided to give that a try, and it was pretty damn close to Penny's Hot Pepper Noodles.  And 30 minutes closer.  They were really good.Here's what I can remember trying so far:Veggie Sushi: Everything we've had has been very good.Pad See Eiw:  Honorable mention.  My favorite still goes to Dao Thai.  But this is respectable.  I wish they used chinese broccoli. Pad Thai: Some of my favorite Pad Thai I can remember having in a while.Vegetable Fried Rice: I think this might be my favorite fried rice I have ever tried.  Its possible it tasted so good because it was free (grub hub coupon). I might have to try it again and pay for it just to make sure it is as good as I remember.Red Curry: Usually I'm not a red curry person but I tasted my husbands.  I think I might be becoming a believer.This place is WAY WAY better than Thai Valley. And Dharma Garden.  And I actually liked it better than Opart Thai House. Its only competition in this area that I have tasted is Spoon Thai.I really like their spice levels.  They have more options than ""spicy"" or ""not spicy"" if you order on grub hub.Every time I have been in every employee was very friendly.  I've also never had an order messed up.  I've yet to use the delivery since they are within walking distance.  (Although, ask me next winter if that's changed).I seriously have not had one bad thing from this place."
"Ordered delivery even though I live four blocks away, food still took an hour to deliver so I was better off just walking over.Pad Thai - Noodles were bland and could have used more green onion.  1/3 of the container was filled with cabbage as filler.  Pad Thai included shrimp for $2 extra and had 5 pieces total that were overcooked.  I would not order this dish again.Potstickers - The six potstickers were stuck to each other but were still relatively crisp served with a dipping sauce.  I would order this dish again.Crab Rangoon - Six pieces folded and crispy.  Came with a sweet and sour sauce that was too sweet and was not very thick.  Pass on the sauce.Sushi - Orderd a crispy shrimp tempura roll, it was in a small plastic container and looked beat to all hell when it got to me.  Surprisingly it still tasted good despite how beat up it was.Overall assessment - I would probably pick my food up next time, but I am neutral on that."
"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's the Godzilla Maki !!!! I've only been here twice but the food and the service was phenomenal both times. The presentation of some of these rolls is unbelievable ! No matter what you order, you can't go wrong..."
Great food. Wonderful presentation. Loved the Mason jars for the drinks. Sushi was awesome and the chocolate lava cake was delicious. Wife got the chicken pad basil and it was also delicious.Definitely coming back again.
"BYOB, no corkage fee.  Excellent value for $$.  A great addition to the neighborhood and a good option for commuters.  Standardize menu with a little twist on classic maki.LUNCH SPECIALS (M-Sat, 11:30 am - 3:00 pm) -- ROBATA $9-11 served with rice, miso soup, 2 gyoza and mixed green salad; WEEKDAY LUNCH $5.95, 9 choices with soup and appetizer of the day; BENTO BOX $9.95 with miso soup, house salad & California roll.SAKURA ($9.95) -- a roll for less than $10 in my favorite super white tuna that hardly shows up in a maki selection.  Decent fish portion.PAD SEE EIW ($7.50) -- serves 2.  Well done.  $1 beef upcharge.FRIED BANANA ($3.95) -- 5 petit perfect rolls.  Banana with small strips of coconut.  Caramel dip with sesame dip.  Addictive.VENUE -- clean, orderly, clutter-free.SERVICE -- pleasant.  Brown bag leftover for you.  Yay!"
"Mango fried rice is how someone today would say ""on point."" Sushi is always fresh and delicious. Pad Khee Mao is just as good can't wait to try the Pad Siew. Banana Rolls were also delicious, but not as I would have expected.. Banana anything from an Asian restaurant you think fried bananas and powdered sugar no ? This is basically an banana egg roll dipped in maple syrup. Different. None the less still amazingly appetizing."
"I was very happy with my first experience here. The restaurant was clean, the food was fast, and the service was friendly. My group ordered a mix of sushi and Thai dishes. The red curry was really outstanding and definitely my favorite! The pad thai was great, just a little bit dry to me. All of the rolls I tried were fresh and delicious. For Thai food in particular, this is my favorite spot in the hood now. Definitely cleaner and better food than Thai Valley. Very affordable prices and a diverse menu are also a win!"
I don't post these often. Great food. Friendly ownership. Awesome addition to the neighborhood!!Let an authentic Thai family cook dinner for you!This is a new weekly staple for me.
Awesome Tom Kha soup. Great fried rice - I got the Mango Tango with chicken. Am looking forward to coming back.
Wife and I had take out from there tonight. My wife and I enjoyed every morsel. Will definitely order from there again.
"This is truly a great place for some freshly made sushi. I dined there recently, there was only 2 other tables and service was really slow, but I noticed a lot of people ordering take-out, which is what we should've done also. However, the food was great, we will definitely be a regular at this place!"
"I love ordering delivery from here.  The food is delicious and always on time if not early. I usually order the pad thai, medium spicy.  The spice level is perfect and the peanut sauce is great.  I love the crab rangoon as well, made deliciously with peanut sauce on the side.  I've had a couple of other noodle dishes, too and they were also good. You get a great amount of food but not way too much.  The sushi is also good and tastes fresh!"
It's just ok. I think the hip hop music is way out of context. The star rating is generous.
"This place recently opened less then 2 blocks from my apartment, so I was very excited at the possibility of having sushi and Thai food so close by. My fiancé ordered steamed pot stickers and 2 orders of chicken pad Thai on Grubhub for pick up. There was a small issue with the restaurant not getting our order from Grubhub, but it wasn't a big deal and once they got it straightened out, our food was made very quickly. The gentleman (owner or manager possibly?) was very apologetic about the whole thing.As for the food...my fiancé and I loved it! The pot stickers were really delicious and I honestly could have eaten an entire order by myself. The pad Thai was also excellent. Good sized portion with plenty of chicken and sauce. The price for our order was really great too - under $22 total.I've only tried one other Thai place in the area (Hot Woks) and I think Ruk is leaps and bounds better. I will definitely end up becoming a regular since it's close, inexpensive, and delicious."
"First time trying and we were blown away! Great, delicious quality for great, low prices. We tried spicy shrimp maki, spicy scallop maki, spicy Cali crunch, and spider maki. All were fantastic. The free fried rice coupon we received was a generous portion. Our new go to, fave sushi place!"
"I always get takeout from their location on Milwaukee because I work right there, so I'm glad to see that the food is consistent from this location as well. I ordered some sushi and chicken pad thai for delivery, and it came really fast! Everything was very fresh and tasted exactly like the food I get from their other location. Great addition to the neighborhood!"
"This is a really good lunch spot. The prices are perfect. I have to be careful what I order though. Everything I've ordered (except the chicken fried rice and the free spring roll included in lunch specials) always comes barely warm. It was also the worst rama chicken I've ever had, so I won't be ordering that again. The wait staff is very nice. I like the look of the place and I love that xylophone."
"We had the veg potstickers, curry fried rice and spicy basil noodle. It was okay but a tad expensive and it took over an hour to deliver. There are plenty of places around with better food, better prices and quick delivery. Wouldn't order from here again."
"We were a party of 10 adults and two kids. The sushi were pretty good but not the steak teriyaki under the entree list. The veggies were undercooked and comes with regular rice, not the Japanese version. I think Renga-Tai restaurant taste better. However, customer service was great. She gets the extra star."
"I love ""Tom Kha"" so much and Robata Gill is very good. All of everthing the sever and chef are very nice."
"Well what can I say.. First time here ordered something simple.. Crab rangoons and something called spider maki, well I'm giving this place a one star because not because of there food but there sanitary habits, I happen to look in the back where there prepare the food and happen to see the older lady holding her phone and talking and then proceed to hang it up and continue mixing raw materials with her hands not even washing her hands.."
"Sushi is so delisios it just melting in your mouth,  salmon plate and noodle s is awesome too) definitely come back again, atmosphere is beatyful"
"A bit small - but delicious and well priced.  Extremely excited to get such a good restaurant within the neighborhood! Will be eating here again - hopefully soon!! Just a note, the Tom Yum soup was amazing - but the medium was incredibly spicy - so I'm sure the hot is crazy!"
The Pad Garlic with beef and brown rice is exceptional! Very tender and the vegetables are perfectly seasoned. The Red Bean Mochi is pretty tasty too. The customer service is extremely friendly.
I love this place but I don't like that the servings are smaller than other thai restaurants that I have been to. They are also very cheap with the hot sauce they only give one. And last time I ordered mild spicy and they assumed I didn't need one so they didn't add it on. I like to add my own spice and the taste when they cook it spicy is better that is why I like to get extra sauces..
"Really good food!  And a cute atmosphere.  My date and I shared the pad see ew with chicken, the rainbow roll, and two orders of the bacon wrapped pineapple.  The pad see ew is probably one of  the best I've had in awhile.  And the bacon wrapped pineapple was so delish that we got two orders.  And the place is BYOB!!  Very affordable date :)."
"Ate here last Saturday, food was good I was surprised. Happy to have a sushi spot blacks from my house. Will return. The only thing that bothered me was that I came home smelling like fried food :( not too happy about that, maybe carry out is best.Has any else had that problem or was it just that night?"
"I order a lot of noodles from here. Sometimes they make it delicious and sometimes not so good. Basically, no consistency. Also, their food proportions are ridiculously small. I'm a small person with a healthy appetite. So it takes 1 appetizer and 2 orders of their noodles (spicy basil noodles/pad thai/yaki soba) to fill up my tummy. :-) If you order their veggie dumplings, it's like they make it for little ants. :-) The smallest dumplings you'll ever see. The reason I keep going back here is because 1. When their food is good, it's really good. 2. There are no other Thai restaurants in my neighborhood. If they increase their proportions and work on consistently, I'd happily give them 5 stars."
"So happy to have a new sushi & thai restaurant in the area.  The food was delicious.  I really enjoyed the panang curry.  All of the vegetable were so fresh.  The best part are the ""robata grill"" options - tasty morsels similar to appetizers like bacon wrapped scallops and cauliflower with ponzu sauce.  Great variety in terms of thai and sushi options.  Look forward to coming back."
"Ordered carry out, really enjoyed my Basil Curry fried rice. Pad Thai was ok, needed a little something to put it over the top. I'm really hoping they do well we need more places like this to take off in Albany Park."
"Ordered delivery sushi, was fresh and staff is friendly. Also added in 4 eggrolls for no extra charge..so that's always cool. :)"
"If you order ""spicy"", be prepared to have your mouth on fire.  Besides that everything is pretty darn delicious."
"Very good, especially for delivery. We ordered sushi---it was all attractively packaged and expertly cut. The rolls were consistent and the delivery was even earlier than they promised. Very good tamago, unagi, and crunchy shrimp roll---the spicy tuna roll is chili and not mayonnaise (yay!) and the sweet potato roll is awesome."
Thank you so much for opening in this area. I ordered rainbow roll and tom yum soup for delivery. Cleared my sinuses right out. Great spice. Fish fresh. Will be ordering here now cuz it's closer than other sushi places
I ordered some tofu pad thai and tofu tom kha soup for pick up. My order was ready quickly in about 10 minutes. The soup was rich and flavorful. The pad thai was just the right amount of spicy and flavorful as well! I am definitely looking forward to coming back to eat in next time for sushi too!
"Really happy to have Ruk in the neighborhood. Food is good, place is clean and the staff are welcoming. I'll be back often."
