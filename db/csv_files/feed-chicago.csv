"I love everything about this place - the chalk board menus, the tacky table cloths, the framed pictures of chickens lining the wall, the americana decor, the fact that you (most of the time) order at a counter window AND I REALLY LOVE VISITING THE CHICKENS. It's completely all over the place, which somehow all ties together. Then there's the food - southern comfort at it's best. I dream of their brussel sprouts and become way too excited every time I see them on the specials board. Go here. Eat anything. Eat everything. Leave satisfied and happy."
"We stopped by Feed for a nice Saturday morning brunch on the 4th of July. It was beautiful sunny day, so we opted to sit around back on the patio, which had some cute strung porch lights, just enough shade, and 5ish tables. You had to walk around the block and through some people's backyards to get from the main front part of the restaurant to the patio in the back, but it wasn't too hard to find.  Lively, but not-overcrowded. We got to sit down right away without any wait.I got the pulled pork hash with 2 over medium eggs and a slice of wheat toast. The hash browns were a mix of Idaho potatoes and sweet potatoes, lightly salted and seasoned, and browned to perfection. Sweet onions and pulled pork were grilled into the potato mix and then everything was topped with the fried eggs and toast. I thought the pork had a bit too much gristle/fat in it and didn't have any nice crispy bits like you'd normally get in pan fried pulled port or carnitas. Pulled pork shouldn't be disappointing, but this definitely was (really, how can anyone do fatty pork badly?). Everything else on my plate was done really well though.My 2 friends got the chicken and sausage pesto hash and the blackened catfish benedict (both were summer specials). The pesto hash was delicious (and I mean delicious!), but definitely on the heavy side and a little too much oil for any one person to eat. It was basically potato hash browns, pan fried sausage and chicken thigh pieces, all coated in pesto and topped with eggs/toast. I should have gone with the catfish benedict, which was pepper cornbread topped with blackened catfish, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. This was by far the best of our three dishes and I would come back to Feed again just for this dish!"
"I really wanted to like this place but the service sucks so bad. I wouldn't come again or recommend it to anyone else based on that alone. At first we sat on the patio. After about 10 min of waiting to get a menu, I had to call over the waitress and ask her for one. This would be excusable if it was super busy, but it wasn't. We went inside because it was getting really windy so we had to go through this process again. The same thing happened. We had to wait a while to get our menus. Then had to wait a while for the waitress to take our orders. Then she forgot our coffee! Again, this would be excusable if it were busy, but it wasn't. I couldn't help but notice that some of the other people around us, who arrived AFTER us, were getting timely service. But I could also see that some people around us looked frustrated as well.I ordered the black bean cakes to be told that they were out of them. I ordered fruit and was told that they were out of fruit. No fruit?! I mean, it's 11am on a Sunday. Where's the preparation?? You know you're going to be busy today but you're out of things at 11am?? That doesn't mean they were sold out. That means there wasn't any prep. Ridiculous. To top it off, we waited more than an HOUR to get our food!! Never coming back again."
This is a cute little homey place on Chicago avenue. The food is ok and the space can be sometimes overcrowded. It's like a soul food diner. What's cool is the urban garden on the side of it which I'm sure provides some of the food that they serve. It's a hidden neighborhood gem bordering the west side. Check it out!
"Super chill place that serves comfort food at its best - soul food is food for the soul. The drive through Chicago avenue is a bit sketch, but nothing different than the streets of LA. By then, I already knew Feed was going to be a unique joint. Park on the street, then look for the infamous rooster sign. The first thing that my eyes were drawn to was the chicken. Turns out, fried chicken is only served on the weekends! I was a little sad, but Ryan (manager) was very welcoming and helpful in deciphering the menu. I still ordered the chicken (rotisserie style) with 2 sides. Ryan let me sample a few of their most popular/his recommendations. We ended up getting the regular French fries (they do offer sweet potato fries) and collard greens. All their sides are made in house except for the fried okra. The best way I can explain the rotisserie chicken is El Pollo Loco style. They serve it with flour tortillas and salsa. The chicken is tender and still juicy - perfectly seasoned chicken skin. The French fries are on point - freshly made, crisp, and salty. They have homemade ketchup as well!Collard greens are a must in my opinion. They are slightly spiced, tender but not fall apart - a skill that is difficult to master. The greens are cooked with ham for that slight pork flavor we all love. For dessert, we were able to sample the banana pudding! Good bread to pudding ratio and a great way to finish the meal. They offer specials everyday day after a certain time so be sure to check that out. Otherwise, both the food and service will has me as a returning customer."
"Great food. Got the 1/4 Dark Chicken with 2 sides, collared greens and mac-n-cheese. Hit the spot. I went in the midafternoon so it was empty but its a cozy restaurant with a distinct grandmas kitchen type feel. Ordered and came out within minutes. I asked the gentlemen at the cashier some suggestions for sides and instead of just giving me a suggestion, he gave me samples which was an awesome touch and made the decision easier. I think there were well over 10 sides or something so for an indecisive guy like me it can get difficult haha. The food itself was delicious, juicy chicken with nice skin on it, and the collared greens mmmm, mac-n-cheese was good, standard stuff. There was also some flatbread type pitas that came with it along with a special salsa. It was a great combo, dip the sauce in chicken or bread, mmmmm. Look for my picture in this section! Definitely would come again."
"Excellent breakfast, and we're told lunch and dinner are even better.I had delicious French toast, four pieces, plus two big flavorful slices of ham.  It took a while to get our food, but it was worth the wait.    Décor is a word which has no application here.  It's a comfortable place, with great food, but very casual."
MMMMM comfort food!Tasty and not greasy chicken.  The corn pudding reminded me of crumbled cornbread with corn kernels added.  Wish it was a little more moist but it was still tasty.  I've had better mashed potatoes and gravy yet these still hit the spot.  Efficient order taking over the phone when I placed my workplace's order.  This will be a new regular place for us!
"Some things I'd recommend to try is the chicken duh and especially the catfish sandwich which I liked even better than the chicken and I'm a chicken guy so that says something. The fish was buttery silky juicy crusted to perfection and just perfect. Comes on a sandwich with this amazing sauce on the side which can get messy so be ready to lick your fingers. And the fingers of your friends who are also eating there.Chicken was good. No surprises there. Moving on...The sides were a let down unfortunately.... the corn bread pudding was too dry, the biscuits were dry AND flavorless, the fries were ok, the slaw was ok too but not the best out there so I wouldn't get too excited about the sides. Focus on the chicken and the fish. The heavy hitters here. Apple pie was da bomb though. It was hard sharing it bc it was just sooo good. Get extra."
"We came here while visiting Chicago for the weekend. Our airbnb was right around the corner so we thought we'd stop by for breakfast our last day here. The atmosphere seems a bit uncleanly and crowded but it in a intimate, homey kinda way. Our server was a sweetheart and was very helpful explaining dishes to us. I orders a spanish breakfast dish. I can't remember the name but I was very disappointed. It did not taste good at all and was very inauthentic. My friends seemed pleased with their meals and finished their plates but I would not have been able to stomach the heavy plates they ordered. I don't think I would go back again and I probably won't recommend this place to anyone."
Such a good find!! The roomie and I came over and split the fried catfish and the pulled pork sandwiches.  Sooooo glad we split it cause I couldn't decide between the two. The decor us awesome! The guy behind the counter wasn't friendly but he wasn't rude either. I wish this place was closer to home!
Fabulousness! Huge portions and great prices. Ryan is a true southern gentlemen. This place knows how to do great food and better customer service. We had the three sides for 5.49. That alone was enough for two people. I also had the BBQ chicken sandwich. We should have brought a 3rd person. Bringing home tomorrow's dinner too!
"Just left Feed. Tried to have brunch here this morning and walked in there were about 5 tables in the restaurant. Waited almost an hour for food. Waitress kept having to come back to tables asking what they ordered. Table of 4 next to us ended up leaving because they were waiting so long. When we finally did get our food, it was gross. Sausage patties were like hockey pucks and pancakes were cold. I was hoping for this place to be good but it was an absolutely frustrating experience. The manager comped our meal (that we didn't eat), but he blamed a new server for everything, which I thought was inappropriate. You're  running the place, take some responsibility. Anyway, would not ever come back here again."
This place is a great place to sit on the patio and have brunch in the sun. The service is friendly (not hipster) but not annoying. The food is farm fresh...like you can see the chickens. They cooked my weirdly specific egg order perfectly. And it's quaint. Also they open at 8 on weekdays and you can pop in to pick up a quick egg sandwich on the way to work.
"I've had some meals here that were spectacular like the black bean patties and fried chicken, but I've had other meals served to me cold.The staff isn't as friendly as id like them to be. I've been here over 10 times and have definitely spoken to everyone except the cooks. But I still give this place 4 stars because it's independently owned and places like this are needed in Chicago. In the summer it's great to have a beer and chill out back in the hidden patio.If people learned to not  have unreal expectations about restaurants they won't be so sour about their experiences. I'm down with feed."
"LOVE the vibe of this place.  Hidden back patio is great too, especially when you're having brunch and chickens are crowing next door, feels like a rural town.  The poultry themed decor inside is effing amazing too.   Great date spot if your girl isn't pretentious."
"Pretty disappointing. Biscuits and gravy- gravy was already sitting on the skillet waiting for a customer to come through the door and order, hence had very burnt flavor. It also had too much flour and not very good. Grilled chicken was moist but lukewarm. Collard greens- very clean, healthy taste but they didn't kill the bitterness at all. Instead they tried to cover it up with spices but it didn't work too well. Fried okra- dry, boring served as tater tots with ranch salad dressing out of the bottle. Coffee- watery, lukewarm. There's obviously no professional chef in the back, and the person doesn't have natural talent."
"Just left there. Pulled pork sandwich and French fries were great! Cole slaw tasted more like vinegar & lettuce. They closed at 10pm and we were rushed out like we were qualifying for the Grand Prix! Then were asked to bus our own table. Just based on this alone, I wouldn't come back. Save yourself the long trip out of the city, not worth it. Now I have to go somewhere and really FEED."
I lived in New Mexico for nine years but this place has the best huevos rancheros I have ever had. Really nice patio.
"There's a toy chicken egg vending machine here! Remember those from the grocery store, you would ask your mom for a quarter and then you put it in and the chicken would spin and cluck and spit out a ring that would get stuck on your finger? Yup I had a doctor cut two of said rings off circa 1988.Oh very important, they are CASH ONLY! The ATM is next to the chicken machine.Now... we went around 1pm on Sunday and there were only 4 or 5 other people there. Feed puts the shabby in shabby chic(k). Actually it's just shabby. But that's ok, we came to eat. The menu was small, but our waitress mentioned several specials and she pointed to a few blackboards with lots of things on them, probably more than what she listed for us. It's too bad they can't have them written down and inserted with the menu. I opted for the eggs benedict and bf got the pozole. I regret not getting one of the specials because the eggs benedict was just marginal. Instead of English muffins, the eggs were on cornbread. The eggs were cooked perfect! The fried green tomatoes they sit on were ok, but the cornbread was blah. The corn pudding which I subbed for the potatoes was pretty good. The bacon I got on the side was awful- cold, dry, flaky, not good.Bf wasn't psyched about the pozole since it was a really thick stew instead of a soup and was fairly bland. We each had a side of Palmolive with our waters, I think the cups needed another rinse cycle. It even was in the coffee mug.Our waitress was incredibly sweet, and including tax and tip our 2 drinks and 2 entrees were $35. The food just wasn't that good for the drive we made out here. I would consider giving this place another try, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way or wait for a table here."
"I couldn't find anywhere on their website that, although this is considered a ""Southern/Soul Food"" restaurant, the chicken is broasted/rotisserie style, and not fried chicken. When I think ""chicken"" and ""Southern,"" there is no alternative but ""fried.""With that said, the chicken is good. The sides were better than I expected (having been surprised when I ripped open a bag, discovering broasted instead of fried chicken) and I would definitely eat hear again.Two things keeping me from eating here more:1. The chicken isn't fried2. The price is a little high for broasted chicken. If you can make your own roast chicken, you will have a hard time swallowing the price."
"Cute cute cute! My girlfriend moved into this area and every time I visit, this is our joint! So super cute...nice folks and the food....yum yum! The catfish is fried to perfection and juicy! All the sides just scrumptious! Southern comfort done cute!  And I dig a lil BYOB joint er'now and again! Hits the spot!"
"Southern style fried chicken, sweet and savory pulled pork, sweet and charming staff...but honestly, I just come here for their sides. A very picnic-blanket looking interior, lots of Rooster and Chicken memorabilia. A place for rooster fans. Definitely."
"Service was subpar.   Food was lukewarm and we were rushed out, had to buss our own tables. Just left and would not go there again. P.s. The macaroni and cheese was not ok!!"
"I would recommend over and over. The staff is incredible. So helpful, like seriously can explain every option on the menu and how it is made.Had a large group and the place was very accommodating. The place is cute and looks as you would expect.Everyone ordered something different so we were able to try all sorts of things. I have to say, there was nothing I didn't like (my favorite was the mashed potatoes). Highlight of the night was the desserts. I have dreams about that banana pudding. I could go on and on, but it's great, try it. The end."
"This place is great. The food was great. My Pulled Pork sandwich was juicy and delicious and my hotman's cheeseburger was also tasty and delicious. The vibe was friendly, and nice. Not much else to say except TRY IT!"
"breakfastrules.blogspot.…Feed's breakfast was near perfection. There are only a few minor complaints: 1.) Frank felt his chicken fried steak was a little light on the gravy. 2.) I felt one of the fried green tomato slices on my eggs benedict was way too small. I had one fat juicy one and a sliver. We could have done better there. 3.) Brent's eggs were a bit runny. (Although, that could be his slobber.)Oh, and they forgot to put Mean Tom's order for two whole chickens that he placed at the beginning of the meal, so we had to wait a while longer while they scrambled to get that in. But, overall, the service was great, considering the small staff and lack of technology. We were more than willing to help them out as well.Feed in Humboldt Park earns a very, very highly recommended rating of 4.75 Brent Chicken Faces. It's worth the drive and worth wait. Tell your friends and neighbors."
Pulled pork hash.......I'll say no more.
"This place is a great little hidden gem. Really classic, American vibe and TASTY breakfast. Eggs, hash, and chickens clucking in the back."
"Dear Feed give me all your mac & cheese please!Feed is dangerously close to my house.  I go there regularly and order 3 sides.  This is about 6 dollars. The portions are pretty large.  I usually end up with a few left overs to take back and enjoy the next day.  The mac & chesse is delicious. The collard greens are also really amazing and spicy.  However, I am not a fan of the fried okra (I grew up in Missisippi, I know how that is supposed to taste) theirs are a little tasteless, not the worst but I don't ever order them.  Feed is cash only and BYOB.  If it is nice outside there is a fantastic little patio out back."
"Called ahead of time to order for dine-in since we were short on time. At that point I was told they were out of chicken. When I asked how long it would be he said 10 minutes. Well 50 minutes later the chicken wasn't ready. In addition, they were out of many of the sides. Food was just ehhh. Too much garlic in green beans. Lets just say we won't be back. Im a stickler for good service."
I just left the restaurant and all the food was pre-cooked...want come back again because I like my chicken hot off the fryer...
"Amazing southern comfort food.  I have dreams about their sauteed spinach... So very good! Quirky cute decor, friendly staff! We are repeat customers!"
"I really enjoyed this place. The ""down -on-the-farm"" feeling made the experience memorable and complimented the tasty lunch. I would like to go back and try other things offered on the menu. I would encourage a visit to this little gem."
"I really hate the word ""vibe"" and its current overuse with people my age, but the best/only way to describe this place is that it has a very relaxed/comfortable vibe to it. Their decor is quirky and the menu is straight-forward...simply delicious. I've only come here for breakfast, but their omelettes, bacon, biscuits and gravy...all on point. Try their cornbread. Just do it"
"Love this place.  Great food, good prices, consistent service and wonderful atmosphere.  I have nothing but good things to say.  The Smothered Fried Chicken on Sundays is some of the the best chicken I have ever eaten.  The greens are amazing and grown in the patchwork gardens to the west of this little urban country gem.I give this restaurant two thumbs up."
"After reading solid reviews of this BYOB soul food place, I invited a group of co-workers/friends for dinner. Food and service were excellent!Feed is a nondescript place near the intersection of Chicago & California with a rooster sign out front.Though they don't technically take reservations, I called ahead to see if we could get space for 12 people. Ryan, the manager, was very accommodating and appreciative of the heads up that a large group was coming in.Ryan had our table set up and we arrived with our BYO supplies. He came over to our table to help us put together a group order with roasted chicken, pulled pork, pulled chicken, and catfish along with sides of Mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, sweet potato fries, collard greens, and cornbread. Even though only a few people were interested in trying the catfish, we ended up ordering two more servings! Everything was very good, but I think the cornbread battered fried catfish was the biggest hit.We wrapped things up with some banana pudding and chocolate cake, which were delicious.All told, with a 30% tip included (great service and efforts to accommodate us), the bill came to $12 a piece (cash only). Can't beat it. Definitely worth a visit."
Feed's fried chicken is like crack! Seriously. I'm one of those fried food snobs. I never eat the stuff. But if I take a bite of this chicken I can't stop.it's crispy. It's light. It's everything you want fried chicken to be. Better than Mom's. The pulled pork sandwich is good too. One star off for serving some of the sides in Styrofoam.  All round good Southern style food.
"Solid place, with solid food. Service is polite and with meaning.Great home cooking vibe, and you don't leave feeling hungry.The chicken is stellar and you should definitely opt for a mystery egg on your way out the door.Easy parking and a cozy cafeteria style atmosphere."
"Visited Feed with a few friends on a muggy weekday night with a cold six pack (BYOB) - the setting of a small joint with homey decor and cowboy movies on the TV was ideal for this kind of night.  The service was great, the woman working the register was friendly and helpful - we even got a few extra sides. It's cool seeing the chickens strut about next door, which is about as fresh as it gets.  Funny how much more ""farm-to-table"" this unassuming place is as apposed to haughty artisan spots like Uncommon Ground in Lakeview.  I'm sure it will get kicked out and replaced by a similar restaurant when Humbolt is inevitably gentrified in the coming decade.  In the mean time, this place proves local food doesn't have to have a stick up its butt and cost a ton of money.  But I digress.  Me and the lady split a full chicken with three sides - a TON of food for 14 bucks.  And it was delish.  Nothing crazy special, but everything had the feel of an excellent home cooked dinner."
"I used to love Feed, but now they are just alright. I don't go as often as I used to. I stopped by on Friday. I brought someone who had never been and we ordered for dine-in, but I had to change the order to carry-out.  Although it was almost 40 outside, it was very cold inside. We couldn't take off our coats. She ordered a lemonade. It was morning and the container that held the lemonade had very little in it. It looked as if it had been leftover from the night before and tasted like it, also. The breakfast was very good."
"Feed was solid. I met a couple of friends there on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded, which was nice. Parking wasn't a hassle either. So, I had the roasted chicken, corn pudding, and mashed potatoes. The chicken was tasty and seasoned well. The corn pudding was disappointing. It was dry and hard, I guess from overcooking? One of my friends had the chicken fried steak and she said it was very tasty. My other friend had the catfish sandwich and she liked her sandwich as well. Our waitress was very friendly, which is a plus. They have one of the old school egg vending machine too........super cool. All in all, I would try Feed again"
"""OH MY GOD! CHICKENS!"" - Just a heads up, if you're walking up to their door from the west you're going to stumble across their chicken herd where they get all their eggs. The three year old little boy in front of me announced it to the world and it was easily the best introduction to the restaurant I could have asked for. I walked in and didn't really know if I was supposed to be seated or just seat myself. It took a minute for anyone to let me know just to grab a table. I'm usually pretty early to places and I had three other people joining me. So don't get on your soap box about sitting before your entire party is there because I was one of probably six people in the entire place. But the waitress did give me the stank eye pretty hard for sitting at a four top without seeming to need one. The food and coffee was fine. Not a ton to write home about. I got the sweet potato hash and I'm sure if it were hot I would have been all about it. I did have to give it quite a bit of salt and pepper but the idea was a good one. I'm not really sure if I'd go back. There are so many great places in the city for breakfast that I don't know if I would use another breakfast on this one."
One of the rare times I really wanted a refund for food. The offerings were sub-par and seemed to be comprised of a few things left over an actual meal. Nothing had any kind of seasoning or flavor. The service was unwelcoming. The atmosphere is pretty shabbily put together with no real effort into creating an inviting space. Checkout Porkshoppe or Fatwillys for a really good southern style meal.
Food was good but not spectacular and service was not that great. It is small inside. Prices are not horrible but it is cash only.There is street parking. The neighborhood is not the best. The restaurant was not that busy and no one came to check on us the entire time we were there. The food was not bad but its not like I cannot get similar food at another restaurant. A combination of good food and service are the two things that make customers return. I don't think I will return.
Crazy relaxed with unbelievable food. After my fried catfish dinner with two sides consisting of mashed potatoes and gravy and mac and cheese I knew I was full...but I definitely wanted more. The steak dinner is unreal and you might end up having dreams about it. Service is friendly and quick and there's outdoor seating as well. They even do take out. I would go here every day if soul food was good for you.
"Good food here,not too pricey. The chicken is best. Lost a star due to being cash only."
"Girlfriend took me to feed for steak night.  We got there right when they started serving, 5 PM- the early birds.  For fifteen dollars you get a hangar steak and 2 sides.  The steak is smaller but that means there's crispy edges in every juicy bite.  The tail end was so caramelized and lustrous.  The blue cheese butter was tangy, rich and satisfying.  For sides I got macaroni and cheese and French fries.  The fries were handcut- damn good.For dessert I got one banana bread pudding for there, 2 to go, and 2 slices of confetti cake to go as well.  The server asked if I was stocking up the for week.  Not that I won't pay $$$ for good cake, but my point is when do you get a piece of good cake for 3.50.  You got to stock up."
"A good, solid, unique and delicious place for breakfast and dinner. Food is hearty, people are interesting and location is obscure but accessible. Had breakfast there a few times. Went there for dinner for the first time yesterday and had the spinach salad which was huge and pretty yummy. Not what I think of when I think of going to Feed but I was chickened out based on too much consumption a day earlier. Friend had the rotisserie chicken with collard greens and mac and cheese which looked great too! They have outdoor seating in the back which is very cute..highly recommended if the weather is nice. Also BYOB so the night just got much cheaper.There's plenty of parking in the area so there's no excuse not to stop by, even if its out of the way."
"My friend suggested this place, and I am glad he did. All the sides (collard greens, sweet potatoes, macaroni and cheese) were on point, and the chicken was the bomb diggity. We got gluttonous with it and tried all the desserts (root beer float, peach pie, and banana pudding) and these too were fabulous. The guy at the counter was super nice, and didn't look at me like I was dumb when I didn't know where the pops were. Even though they were busy they didn't try to rush us out of the place. My mother has required that I bring her here, so I'll be back!"
I want my money back! Had the biscuits and gravy talk about gross.. food was cold and had no flavor! Sausage patties taste like they are from aldi's! Dont waste your money on the fried green tomatoes either! I wish I could give them no stars!
"I've got nothing bad to say about feed. Southern cooking at its best, simple, cheap, very tasty, and great outdoor patio that is never too crowded. Love it so much."
Recently stopped in for a Sunday funday for some brunch and left full as well as happy with everything.  Though I showed up happy since I was already a six pack in I was indeed hungry.  We were able to enjoy the back patio and it was BYOB. I kept it tame and built an omelette but tried a pulled pork brunch plate and a special of chilequiles which I wish I had ordered for myself but I polished off that persons plate too.I am highly interested in Feed and would like to come back to explore a lunch option sometime. We had a friendly server and she waited on us perfectly.  Love sitting outside but conflicted for whatever reason that I didn't get to see what the inside was like. I thought I was inside too but not thinking since the restaurant isn't accessible to diners from the patio.  You have to walk out and around the corner establishment which was a bar and I kept going in there to empty the reserve for more beer and never put two and two together that I was never in the right place.  Must happen often though because there was a bunch of people by the door who would just let me do what I do and even chat with me.  Pretty funny when I think about it but damn okay in my book.
"What happen to you Feed?  You used to be my boy, my partner in crime.  I used to dream about your pulled pork hash.  Now, you are just, okay.  I'm not sure what has happen to this restaurant in the last 2 years but the quality of the food has gone down hill.  Things just don't taste the same.  Like the a fore mentioned pulled pork hash, the flavor isn't the same.  The medley of flavors that you once were have turned into over cooked potatoes with pulled pork  thrown on top with an over cooked over easy egg.  Just makes me sad.  The lunch stuff is still good,  You can't go wrong with the rotisserie chicken,  But to me Feed was all about brunch. I am sure I will head back to them again, I owe them that much.  But please, be aware this isn't the same Feed you have grown to love. :("
"Amazing. If you want to go somewhere low key with the ultimate comfort foods of childhood, go to feed."
A great deal on tasty food. BYOB. Nice place to hang out. Good people work there.
I recently went to Feed for dinner with my family. It is a cute little restaurant and I will be going back. The lady helping us at the counter was very friendly and she was willing to answer all our questions. It was our first time there so we had quite a few. The food was good. I had the chicken. It was seasoned good and was moist. I had the collard greens and Mac and cheese. The collard greens were ok. They just were not seasoned to my liking. The Mac and cheese was pretty good for restaurant Mac and cheese. It tasted homemade and not from a box.
Are here for the first time today after living in the neighborhood for years. I don't know what I was more impressed by: the food or the service. The guy working totally took care of us above and beyond!! Could not have asked for a better dining experience.  Keep up the good work :)
I'm originally from the south and imagine my delight when I discovered Feed with all of my favorite stuff from home!  Their corn pudding is ridiculously delicious but nothing was disappointing.  Thanks for bringing me a taste of home all the way up here!
"Out of the way, cash only and high chicken camp.  Best country food for miles.  Perfect for breakfast."
"Big shout to the staff at Feed for fast service and helpful facts on the menu as our group of six shut this place down last night.  BYO makes the world go round, so if you add that to tasty catfish, great fries (both regular and sweet potato were great), and two incredible desserts (rhubarb pie and banana bread pudding), I will be back.  Some of the sides we tasted were just OK or slightly above average (mac-and-cheese and the mash/gravy), but overall a great experience.  So thankful I don't live close to this place, otherwise I would be a much, much heavier man."
"Holy cow. This place is like the disney world of food.They have sooooo many sides to choose from and they are all incredible.Went with a group of six on a thursday and there was space for us.We each got an entree and each entree came with 2 sides which was amazing.We all got different stuff and tried each other's sides and there was not a single complaint about any of them. (We tried the collard greens, cornbread pudding, fried okra, succotash, bean of the month, coleslaw, sweet potato fries, and the mashed potatoes and gravy.)All the entrees were delicious too. I had the quarter chicken and it was perfectly cooked and put on a tortilla which was a nice little added bonus since it soaked up the juices. It also came with an unexpected side of fire roasted salsa which went really well with the tortilla and the chicken.The food alone was worthy of five stars but Ryan kicked it up a notch and made it a 7 star dining experience. He was extremely helpful with giving us recommendations for sides and explaining how all the food is prepared. You could immediately tell he loved his job and took pride in what he did and it definitely came through in the food.For dessert we let Ryan choose for us and he nailed it. We got banana pudding, two slices of their home made pie, and a big bowl of ice cream. It was heaven, especially the banana pudding.You can bet your ass I will be back here in the future."
"Great food. Homey decor and a very relaxed atmosphere. A whole wall of chicken pictures. I ordered Special of the day steak and sides of Mac N Cheese and Collard greens. Since we were done eating almost at closing time, our cashier gave us each a banana pudding."
"The one thing that stood out for me was the service. Food tasted great and the gentleman at the counter definitely took care of us. When we arrived breakfast had just finished but we really wanted biscuits, so he went into the back and had the kitchen heat some up. My only gripe was the lack of air conditioning, so on a nice day count on it getting fairly warm inside."
"I like this place. When a friend reccomended this place for a Sunday brunch I was a bit worried about people traffic . Luckily there was plenty of free parking and plenty of table space available.  The menu had standard fare: omelettes, pancakes, typical sides, etc. It was about $25 for 2 people. This place is cash only which fits in with the overall quaint, down home style they go for along with roosters everywhere.  Service was good and it's a bit of a trek for me,  but I'll go back to enjoy another Sunday brunch."
"Good brunch and tasty dinner. The chicken is good, but not extraordinary. The patio is pleasant (and makes for good people watching) in the summer. The price is excellent, and the hipster-ish staff is friendly. BYOB available, but rarely seen, as this is more of a quick meal type of place."
"This place was great! Haven't been there for brunch yet but my husband and I had the whole chicken dinner with 3 sides (so cheap--$16!) and had plenty to take home for leftovers.  The mac&cheese, fries, and mashed potatoes were all delicious and the chicken was perfectly seasoned and moist.Overall, the prices are great, the decor is perfectly kitcschy, and the customer service (Ryan) was superb.  Incredibly nice, had good tips about reheating our leftovers, and made me a ""chef's mistake"" dessert which consisted of a slice of their chocolate cake topped with their delightful banana pudding.  All in all, a perfect dinner.  I will definitely be back to try out brunch, other dinner items, and that richly perfect banana pudding."
"Home cooking at it's finest. I come here when I'm craving comfort food, I've only been for dinner, but I definitely recommend trying the succotash as a side and don't forget banana pudding for dessert. You won't be disappointed. I look forward to coming back for breakfast/brunch to try those biscuits and gravy!"
"The best chicken place I've found since moving here a year and a half ago from Atlanta. My boyfriend and I both got a quarter chicken, had the Mac and Cheese, collard greens, corn pudding and fried okra. Would order it all again except maybe skip the okra and get more chicken. Loved it!"
Feed is qual. Friendly folks and comfort food. I dig the mash and the mac. I love the BYOB action. Prices are very good and the decor is fun. I live close and its kinda dangerous as I want it more than I can allow my belly to have it.
"My husband and I drove by this place on our way to dinner in the adjacent hipper, cooler neighborhood, when he said, ""I've heard good things about that place.  I want to try it.""  Surely he didn't mean that little hole-in-the-wall? That evening, I did a Yelp search and you folks have been raving about this place, so I decided it was worth a try.Walking through the door it reminded me of a cozy, country kitchen.  I can't say too much about the decor because we decided to sit outside on the patio.Just follow the chicken footprints...The patio was packed.  There were only two empty tables when we got there.  Service wasn't the best.  No one was in the patio area to greet us or tell us what to do so we sat for a few minutes then I thought, maybe we're supposed to get our own menus, so I grabbed some, then about 15 minutes later a server came over to give us menus.  There seemed to be only one server working the entire patio, which was probably the reason service was slow.We were there for brunch.  I got the pulled pork hash and both my companions got the chicken with collard greens and mac and cheese.  I loved their food (greens were well-seasoned, mac and cheese creamy and the chicken was juicy).  My brunch items were just okay.  I believe the idea is that fresh food should speak for itself and you shouldn't need to alter it much, but everything on my plate could have used some seasoning.  I really wish I could give this 3.5 stars because that would be more accurate.  I wasn't thrilled with my meal, but I would definitely go back for dinner and give it a second chance."
"I decided to try this place after I saw the live chickens in the back. Yes, I know kinda crazy but it caught my eye. I got some chicken, collard greens, okra and mashed potatoes all to go. The good was delicious to me. The chicken was juicy with a nice flavor. The sides were also good. Next time I go I will try their desserts."
First time eating here.  Ryan was as nice as anyone I have meet working at a place like feed.  I had the half dark with spinach and coleslaw.   The chicken was juicy and deliciius.  The spinach was better than what I make at home and that's awesome.  Very nice clientele and atmosphere.   Reminds me of places I've been to down south.  I will definitely eat here again.
"The only reason I have this place 2 stars was because the clerk was so friendly.  The food was disgusting. I ordered the catfish sandwich with collard greens, amd mac n cheese. Our food was ready quickly, which I thought was great until I bit into it the fish was not cooked thoroughly.  I told the clerk/waitress and she apologized and said she would bring me a new piece.  Well another 5 minutes later another piece of catfish was brought out. She cautioned me that the cook did ""the best he could to cook it all the way through"" when I bit into it, it was still not done.  Very mushy, soggy, and almost raw.  VERY DISAPPOINTED and left hungry.  SMH"
"It is a small cozy place that one can easily miss. I got their roasted chicken dinner with sides including- mac n cheese, fries. Roasted chicken- very very good.. the fat was trimmed and the chicken was baked so well! It comes with a dipping sauce ( that i cant figure out what it is, but its yummy!) and 2 tortillas ( that i did not end up using :( Mac and cheese- it was reallly dry and i did not like it one bit ( unfortunate for me b/c i love mac n cheese!). The fries were really very fresh and tasted great! Whats worth writing about are their desserts- the banana one in particular! i forgot the exact name of it, but its a banana pudding type thing and its DELISH!! Its better than banana pudding ive had anywhere! They also have a white sponge cake marinated in evaporated milk, its very sweet and also good. Their whipped cream is HEAVENLY! It is sooo light , maybe this is what a cloud tastes like in heaven.. idk.. neither do u.. but try it!!This place is also really cool for another reason - they have veggies that u dont really get commonly- fried okra, socatash ( spelling?), collard greens, beets.. im not a veggie gal, but the bf GOBBLED up his veggies like a pro!Its a very friendly place, our dinners came out in 15 min and its CASH ONLY!!!Im not sure i will return for dinner since i want to try out more places before i leave c-town.. but i suggest u come and give this small, homey southern style place a try!"
"It saddens me to give only 2 stars to a place I would have given 5 on any day, just a year ago. A couple other reviews mention the quality has gone down recently, and I have to agree. What happened to you, Feed?When I went for brunch a few weeks ago, Feed just didn't bring it. Not a huge deal breaker, but to start, the coffee was cold, old, and weak.  I ordered the pulled pork hash, an old favorite of mine, and it was pretty flavorless. I can deal with flavorless, but my boyfriend ordered an omelette that was served watery and not fully cooked. Gross. We returned it and the server brought out another... wait for it... uncooked watery omelette. At that point, appetites had pretty much disappeared. How do you screw up an omelette?Is there a new kitchen staff?Hopefully they can get their groove back, since I'd really like to return to the old neighborhood fave."
"This place is a total gem.  The atmosphere is friendly and very laid back.  The prices are unreal -- $15 for a whole chicken and three generous portions of sides? The food is incredible.  Between four of us we tried 6 different sides and each one was delicious.  Ryan's service could not be beat, he really made the evening.  New favorite spot for sure."
"Go for Sunday brunch. I went on a weekday for breakfast and it was totally disappointing. Sunday is a quaint with tasty interesting choices, weekday was a basic take out place with basic choices. Had a 1/4 Chicken that was perfectly cooked but so-so tasting."
"I am giving feed an extra star (when it should be one) because I remember how it used to be.   - Seriously what happened?  I went there last weekend after church, all excited to eat their memorable side dishes and juicy chicken (with the tortilla).   I talked it up to my girlfriend who had never been there and so we went on to order a whole chicken with 3 sides (and I ordered an extra side)...bad move on my part.  I think the only thing that I liked was the hotsauce.  Hungry, I attempted to eat the corn bread pudding (which was dry and just plain bad - I don't remember it that way) - the mashed potatoes that tasted like the instant kind - the rice was bland and so was the mac n cheese...it was like they ran out of cheese. The chicken was ok but that even didn't seem as good as a few years back.  I think Feed should now be called Fed because it's time has passed.  So sad to see this place slip away...maybe if they took credit cards, got a new chef (or find the one who was there before again) or had a magic golden egg in their chicken machine that informed them to add some flavor to their food, this place can be revived."
"I've been to Feed quite a few times over the years and it's always been a solid Americana food joint. Plus the restaurant looks fun with all the chicken photos around. My 3 yr old loves it. They even have the egg machine!  It's one of the closest legit restaurants to my work, so I appreciate it being solidly reliable. BUT! The real inspiration for me finally writing a review is that I was in there yesterday and was blown away by the customer service we got from the cashier, a guy named Ryan. He was awesome. Truly great people person - was witty and friendly, very attentive, and even let my buddy sample the pulled pork. I don't know where this guy came from because I had never seen him there before, but they need to clone this dude and spread him around Chicago!(I give 4 stars because it's cash only.)"
"I've been going to this place for years and couldn't believe I hadn't written a review yet. First food. I love the burgers here. They are juicy and big. The chicken is well touted. But I mostly stick to the burgers and breakfast. Breakfast for me is two scrambled, bacon and potatoes. Delish everytime! The spinach salad though I did find to be a bit dry and the chicken on it not that tasty.  They also have Filbert's Sodas!Service: Depends on who's working the counter. I do think some extra help on Sunday's would help as the counter seems to get overwhelmed. Some of the new girls need to work on relaying the orders to the cooks(found a few things in some orders that shouldn't have been there) There is a tall guy with glasses and a cap who seems the best at controlling order back there. And also a very pleasant brunette with glasses who also is great at the counter.Price: Fair and decent for the portions you are given. Very southern portions that is. CASH ONLY. Though there is an ATM near the front. And you must pay at the counter after your order has been taken. Parking: Street parking. No valet. Chicago #66 and California #52 buses let you out right in front.Will always be back. I also bring my family when they are in town. They love this spot as well!* Also if you have a fear of chickens and roosters, this is not the place/decor for you my friend! Lol."
"Adorable place. All of the chicken and rooster décor reminded me of my Grandma's kitchen (she grew up a Nebraska ranch girl). You really do feel like you are in someone's home.I was there for breakfast. My breakfast was pretty standard (poached eggs, bacon, breakfast potatoes), nothing blew me away. My friend says she always gets the Fried-Green Tomato Benedict. Perhaps I should have ordered that. I did sample her cheesy grits and they were quite tasty.In any event, my coffee cup was always full (nice plus!). As others have pointed out, be ready - Feed is Cash Only."
"I give Feed 5 stars for consistency.EVERYTHING is consistently good. I don't think I've ever been disappointed there. Yes sometimes the corn pudding isn't as creamy as I would like it to be but whatevs!I've had some of the best brunches / lunches ever in Chicago at this very restaurant. Their special Pizole is worth writing to mom about. The Black Bean cake special almost had me in tears. TEARS OF HAPPY HUNGOVER FOOD TIME. Everything I could ever want on a sunday afternoon.The usuals are just as good. The cat-fish sandwich is right up there with Fat Willy's. Some may even prefer it, I'm still undecided. They are both excellent with the kittyfish fry.Basically anything on their menu will be good. I can't go through them one by one because I have a life people. Really...I do...LOLSides; corn pudding, spinach & garlic, collard greens, sweet potato fries. My favs. Just pure yums.And what will keep me coming back again and again, at any random hour of the day?BANANA PUDDING. The holy grail of all banana cream puddings. We've tried to reproduce this at home but nothing comes close. Maybe one day they will give me the recipe, perhaps for my first born, what a hard day that will be my friends.The staff is great. Very nice people. Good folk and deliverers of my yums.BYOB OMG PERFECT...FEED is what food is all about."
"I really wanted to like this place, but was disappointed with my experience. My husband and I went in the early evening to sit out on the patio and have a burger and fries. I ordered a lemonade and it was that neon pink color that's made from powder...not fresh at all. Both of our burgers were well, well done (I ordered medium) and the french fries were also burnt. Maybe brunch is better...but I don't know that I even want to try and come back again..."
"I stumbled upon this place recently by complete accident.  It's a no-frills type place but the food was delicious.  Their service was amazing too.  The gentleman at the counter let me try a variety of foods since it was first time at Feed.  All the food was great.  It was hard to choose.  All the meals come with Slaw.  Slaw is a dangerous game to play, especially when it's a staple of all your meals and they nailed it.  I also had the collard greens and it was delicious.  I plan on taking my dad here who loves places with great soul food, is in an edgy neighborhood, and is BYOB.  This will be my new hidden gem that I will try to frequent anytime I'm in the West Town/Humbboldt park area. Not that it matters, but this place is hipster heaven."
"Really, really nice and pleasant staff. The woman working behind the counter greeted me with a beautiful smile and helped me pick out my meal. I got the feta omelette which was phenomenal. Perfect amount of cheese, tomato, and spinach. The home fries were done just right and the bread came without butter which I love!! Very enjoyable atmosphere. I will keep coming back and bringing friends here! Great spot."
"Super friendly staff. Consistent, having said that the food can always be enhanced by adding some seasoning as you like. Great neighborhood joint."
"Southern roadside diner comes to Chicago. I always get the same thing: Quarter chicken, dark, mashed potatoes and gravy, and collard greens, Dr. Pepper. The only thing I don't like is instead of bread or corn muffin they give you a couple flour tortillas. I HATE flour tortillas. I also had the pulled pork which was awesome too. A fun hip place. Cheap!"
"One star for customer service and one star for the food. Service is terrible and always is. Rude, impolite, sarcastically judgmental counter woman.  Food was sent back due to the bacon being completely and 100% disgusting. It crumbled in my fingers and was so burnt and over fried in fat, probably had been sitting for a while as well, it was ice cold. When returned bacon and asked for sausage (of two different orders of bacon) one side of sausage was given. When I questioned the other side of sausage they brought out a side of BACON that was UNDERCOOKED! I mean really! Under-freakin'-cooked! No more to really say at this point...this is the second try I have given this place after LOVING it for years and having two terrible experiences, I will not go back."
"I love Feed! especially their shrimp grits which they only have for brunch once in a while.  But the fried okra, cornbread pudding and chicken are great too.  I love their weekend brunch."
"Holy crap. I can't even believe the prices here. Especially for the quality of food! Chicago is a city that prides itself on steakhouses and I bought possibly the best Hanger Steak I've ever eaten here for $12. TWELVE DOLLARS! And the chicken was delightful too. BYO, no frills, but they are great cooks! If you're not afraid to venture out W of Western, you should eat here now!"
"The food was pretty good. I got the crab cakes and eggs and my boyfriend got biscuits and gravy. The portions are huge, and we sat on the back patio, which was perfectly delightful. I am, however, perplexed by the rave reviews of the service. We were there for almost two hours (not by choice) because the service was soooo slow. There weren't even that many people there. It took half an hour for the waitress to take our order, another half hour for us to get our food, and then another half hour for her to give us our check after we asked. We ended up going up to the counter to pay because we weren't about to wait another half hour to get our change back. I'd go back, because the food was good, but will be sure to bring a book next time."
"Excellent broasted chicken. Fabulous cheesey grits, fried tomatoes and collards greens. Friendliest service in town and at a great price."
"Feed is home cooking / soul food / Southern type place in Humboldt Park.  It's got a comfortable diner feel and the food is delicious.  They have various options ranging from pulled pork sandwiches and burgers to fried chicken.  There is a slew of sides to choose from - fried okra, cole slaw, beet salad...  I had a wonderful fried catfish sandwich, fries and slaw.  It was a large portion and, at under $9, a great deal!"
"I'd give them 5 stars, but went there for breakfast. Not a stellar showing. Good for the price and value especially for lunch/dinner and it's byob."
"Excellent little southern-style diner. Big fan of the fried green tomato benedict. Food is 4.5 stars, service is 5 stars. Our server was super nice and accommodating for our large group that included two toddlers. Would absolutely go often if I lived nearby. Hell, I'll probably go often even though I live two or three miles away."
"Awesome spot. I can't say enough good things about my experience, but I'll try to be to the point:-Great food and great value. I had fried chicken w/ a biscuit (special), mac'n'cheese, and sweet potato mash. Finished it off with peach pie + vanilla ice-cream. The fried chicken was some of the best I've had in the city. I was happy with everything and the value was great.-The service was terrific. I got my food within 5 minutes and the person that took my order was extremely courteous and helpful. It was Easter Sunday, so I am sure this played a part, but I was pleased nonetheless.-It's BYOB. Nothing more to add there."
"Wow! The chicken is amazing!! It came with tortillas too which was the Icing on the cake. Food was absolutely delicious, super friendly staff! I will be back!"
"Donna and Liz sold and moved on, but their crazy chick vision still vibes.  And now there are live chickens in the farm just west of the restaurant!"
"I used to live a couple blocks away and always wanted to stop by here, but never found the time.  I had Easter brunch here.  It wasn't too crowded, the servers are nice, and the decor is spectacular.  There were three in my party, and I believe that all of us were quite pleased with our meals.  It's definitely the type of place that would be awesome to have nearby for breakfast or brunch... they have lunch items as well.  I look forward to going back and trying some of those items.  Cash only... but they have an ATM inside."
"This place is so hard to notice! I have been living here for about 3 years and I finally noticed this is a restaurant.About a few days ago my fiancé and I went to go try it. We went in for the brunch. It took about 10 minutes to be seated. We were seating at the same time as this couple was. The couple got their food before we even ordered ours. I was pretty upset and was almost certain I wouldn't return. Once the waitress finally noticed she was really sweet, she gave us drinks on the house and apologized for not being serviced. I got a biscuits and gravy and my fiancé got the pulled pork hash I believe. The biscuits and gravy was pretty good. But the pulled pork was awful. It had an odd taste to it and the veggies that go on the side didn't complement the dish at all. We told the waitress and she replaced it to whatever he wanted. Overall the food is mediocre and the service phenomenal. Not sure if I'll be returning yet."
Very nice food. Felt very welcome. We were visiting from California. Fresh chicken too. Love it.
DIESO
Great great great restaurant. I brought my mother and wife here and we all loved it. I will definitely be back for some more of that good old down south cooking.
"Feed is one of my favorite spots in Chicago. Their back patio is great on a nice day. The corn pudding will blow your mind, and the service will make you feel right at home! I went at a slow time and Ryan took great care of me. He brought me banana pudding and chocolate cake just because."
I thought this place was great and a hidden gem.  very casual but all homecooked food and cheap food for the portions you get.  Fried green tomato benedict was amazing and carnitas were very tender.  BYOB too.  Definitely want to try their chicken.
"I was underwhelmed by my meal here.  This is a cute enough spot but the food was lacking. I ordered mac and cheese , barbecue pork chops and squash and for dessert banana pudding. So the main dish really didn't have any flavor. This is coming from a person who doesn't really season her food. The mac wasn't really cheesy to me. The banana pudding was a whipped version similar to Magnolia Bakery's. It wasn't bad but I like my pudding done a certain way. Whipping it takes away from the idea of the dish as well as it's flavor, in my opinion. I wish them well though."
"Went there for brunch and had their chicken fried steak, while my lady had a pulled pork sandwich. My steak was good, nothing special but just like a chicken fried steak should be, crunchy on the outside and tasty on the inside. The pulled pork had more of a vinegar style sauce, I'm more into sweet sauces but it was still good. I bet the chicken meals are their go to, but since this was brunch, I didn't go for it. I regret it a bit. However, I really have no complaints, the service was great. The place has a pretty cool decor filled with chickens and the meal was well priced."
"I wanted to like this place so badly based off the decor and the fact that they have their own chickens out back, but the food was just so bland and mediocre. I am a big fan of American comfort food but my catfish sandwich and side of mac and cheese tasted like it was straight from a hospital. NO FLAVOR. It was pretty impressive how flavorless the whole meal was. I ended up dumping a ton of salt on everything and then leaving more than half my meal uneaten. My boyfriend's meal also had the same issues so I couldn't even mooch off him. Such a shame because it looks like it has such potential to be great."
"This place is super cute and yummy!The fun egg machine is always a good thing to try your luck on.  If you get a golden egg, you get a free meal or something (I know, I know, you get something but I forget what it is).  All I got was a lame eraser but the experience of possibly winning was fun.The servers were funny and witty and they never hesitated to fill my coffee cup and keep me way over-caffeinated I was here with 3 other people for breakfast/brunch and we all loved our food!  Plenty of choices for sides, big portions, and reasonable prices.  Give it a try!"
"Baaa-Cawk! Roll up into this rooster and hen den and you won't be disappointed...UNLESS you were expecting to have a 'cock' tail (the kind with out feathers). In other words it is BYOB my little chickadees so come strapped with your favorite libations..if you are into that sort of thing. The food here takes me directly back to Texas. Even the portions reflect Feed's southern roots so you definitely want to bring an appetite to the fight. I've had the Chicken Friend Steak and the Pulled Pork Hash and if you order the steak you had better be ready to EAT or it will make you its little hen. My only complaint is that  they should upgrade the coffee to match the heavenly food, but this will definitely not stop me from returning again and again.Feed is completely unpretentious and if you have friends or relatives visiting from a small town they will feel right at home here. Their patio is a hidden gem and, yes, there are representations of chickens everywhere so insert your favorite cock joke here__________________."
"I think FEED might be my next favorite brunch spot.  Anywhere that has an old-fashioned Chicken Egg Laying Machine wins my heart.  Too bad the chicken didn't feel pressured enough to lay a gold egg for me to earn $6 off my next meal.  I guess I didn't push the quarter in hard enough!  FEED sure praises chicken and laid back barn lifestyle.  Just look around you.FEED is hella reasonable too.  No place exists where you can get something for a quarter, not even for 2.  But at least there's FEED where for 3 you can treat yourself to a cup of hot cocoa with tons of whipped cream.  They have sweet potato hash with 2 eggs and toast for $7.  Their hash is super yummy with a little kick: sweet potatoes, tomatoes, green peppers, onions, something, something, and some type of surprise shredded pork that may be BBQ.  D-Lic!If that's not enough, add in an old fashioned Juke box that you can play songs on for FREE to keep the quirky, clumsy waitresses kickin'.  Then add in a Jackalope on the wall and you got FEED!  Now I just gotta get me one of their shirts and hopefully I'll get fed for free then too!Note: CASH ONLY but an ATM is in store just in case.  It can get kinda busy so there's a sign-in list at the entrance."
Great pulled pork and awesome sides to choose from. We went for dinner but I definitely want to come back for their breakfast!
"We love coming here for the wonderful flavorful chicken which is seasoned well and really moist. They are served with fliur tortillas and a delicious salsa. My son loves the mac n cheese which is pretty tasty as well. Not the best mind you, but good enough to complement the chicken.  We had the beet salad today for the first time and that was also delish. Great food!"
I went to Feed last week on the strength of all the great reviews here on Yelp. I had a hankering for some greens and I am so glad I went to Feed. OMGTHEFOODWASSOGOOD! I had the quarter chicken with greens and mashed potatoes. mmm Mmmm MMMM! The tattooed guy behind the cash register was cool and the decor was awesome. Everything is rooster themed. The bathroom has pictures of everyone who won the coveted golden egg from the machine in the dining room. I think I found my new favorite restaurant.
"this place is awesome. my almost 3 yr old goes nuts everytime we go. So the fact that his dad and I can eat comfortably while our kid is entertained is a huge plus. It's a casual joint, byob, cash only, seat yourself..get your own drinks, etc. It hasn't been too busy when we've gone usually in the evenings. We haven't tried brunch yet but I'm hoping to soon. The chicken is awesome and I like the flour tortilla and salsa included. the Hangar steak is a STEAL at under $15! We've only been twice so haven't had a chance to explore the menu much but what we've gotten has been delicious. Staff has always been super friendly. The decor is awesome and our son is facinated by all the pictures and chicken knick knacks! He also loves the antique egg machine and we easily spend $5 on getting him eggs from there and he goes home with a handful of erasers or silly little toys and is happy as a clam. It's a win-win all around. Those of us with small children are often limited to where we can eat and this place fits the bill perfectly! We've usually been too stuffed to have room for dessert but from the other reviews it looks like we may need to try that too!"
"Pulled Pork sandwich had a nice sweetness to it, and the meat was flaky and tender, but the bun was too weak to support it! A pet peeve of mine with pulled pork, people! Toast that bottom or get a better bun! Peach pie with wheat crust and ice cream was tasty, but microwaving it to serve it warm made the crust fall apart. Serve it cold and flakey, I say!I still like Feed, but I'm demoting it to a strong Four stars."
"I've been to Feed twice, and it's nice to see in 6 years they haven't changed a bit.  Seriously, I think every chicken in the joint was in the exact same place as it was 6 years ago. Kyle H and I had lunch at Feed and since I want to be just like him when I grow up I ordered the exact same thing he did: Pulled pork sandwich, fries, and cole slaw.  (If you're keeping up you might have noticed I ordered the same thing Renita did at lunch the day before.  I'm a copycat.)  The pulled pork was good, a little sweetness to it and just the right amount of bbq sauce.  The fries and slaw were pretty good.  I think I could've just ordered sides and been happy.  Fried okra, collard greens, corn pudding, sauteed spinach, and beet salad all sounded delicious.  I hope it won't take me another 6 years to go back."
"I finally made here after wanting to go for quite some time and glad I made it.  Not having any idea what to expect, I had eerie childhood memories of my grandparent's farm down in Kentucky popping up as it is smeared with country kitchen cows and chickens all over the place.   The food is good, but I can't say it topped my Mamma's cooking.  However, it was close!   I like the fact that their menu was simple and easy to run through and you won't find anything complicated.  Here are the goods:*  The down home southern décor.  Some call it hipsterish, some call it cool or vintage...I call it decorated with stuff I can find in my grandmother's basement.  *  Big cup of coffee.*  Great omelets.  Since ""doing brunch"" is such a cool thing to do, you'll have to battle your way in the door so you can write your party's name on the board.  I spent 12 bucks on a plate and coffee.  If you go on a weekend, expect a small wait.  It's worth the wait.   The only thing that annoyed me is that they are cash only.  Feed needs to get with the times and bring in a credit card machine."
"Loved it. Amazing rotisserie chicken, fresh okra and out of this world home style mashed potatoes. I also tried the corn pudding, very moist. BYOB but their cans of soda are only a buck, can't beat that. Banana pudding of the gods. This place will not disappoint."
"I've lived a few blocks from Feed for, like, 4 years now, so I've eaten here countless time. The service is great! The atmosphere is great! But I've become less enthralled over time with the food. My hands down favorites are the fried green tomatoes eggs benedict (YUM!!!), the catfish sandwich (that sauce is EVERYTHING! and the catfish is fried perfectly!) and the corn pudding. The specials have been less successful. My husband nearly cried tears of disappointment after trying their chicken pot pie, which was very bland and didn't have traditional pot pie ingredients (like peas, carrots, etc) and their biscuits and gravy, too, wasn't anything special. So how does Feed still get 4 stars? Because the catfish sandwich, fried green tomatoes egg benedict and corn pudding are so REMARKABLY outstanding!! The best I've tasted in the city. So now I go to Feed (pretty frequently) for those three things alone :)"
"I came here for Sunday brunch on a quick weekend trip to Chicago. We sat on the back porch area, which was lovely, and fun to hear the chickens who would be providing the eggs for my breakfast clucking around in the yard next to us. Food was delicious -- I had the sweet potato hash which was SO much food I could have eaten off it for 3 days! I consider this a plus as I love taking leftovers. The hash had chunks of sweet potato, green pepper, mushroom, broccoli, regular potato, onion, and I'm sure a few others things. One of the other folks I was with got the fried green tomatoes benedict, and it looked amazing. All in all, super quaint and cute place, good prices, great food. I would love to go back next time I'm in town."
"I don't brunch, I do however ride home from a long day of work, and when I'm not in the mood to cook, I get the awesome chance to visit Feed.  Not going to go into what I like.  I like most everything.  Boom goes the Collard Greens!  Blam goes the Banana Pudding, Zoinks goes the awesome Chicken... Ok, I did go into what I like, at least it was a tripped out way of doing it.zap!"
"I've only had the fried green tomato eggs Benedict, but I've had a LOT of different fried green tomato eggs Benedict and this place has the tastiest one. I think it's the sauce."
"Not sure about this place. After looking it up and checking out the menu online, I was totally looking forward to having some bfast here. Came here on a Wednesday morn and walked in. Looks like a something you might find in the south with its picnic table and kitschy tablecloth.  There were about two tables with folks eatin.  It wasn't entirely clear if we were to seat ourselves, be seated, or as it turns out, head to the cashier and place your order. The chick behind the counter had a pretty indifferent look and by the wide eyed looks on our faces, it should have been clear that we weren't aware of the ordering process. Soooo....lunch menu is above our heads but we were looking for some bfast since it is about 10:30am. She pulls out a small board with some specials and we proceed to make a decision. I end up getting the biscuits with gravy and 2 eggs. It was pretty inexpensive about $5.95 for the whole shebang.  We order and then we pick a table and wait. The process is then our order is called by the cashier and we go pick it up cafeteria style.  I get my order and quickly realize that my biscuits and gravy are lukewarm.  No like. I eat and into my second of four biscuits, I have difficulty breaking a piece of the biscuits off. I mean, I don't want to have to struggle to eat some biscuits sopped in gravy!  Sigh...disappointed.  I think what happened was that they were waiting for my dining partners chicken fried steak to be done ( her dish was piping hot!) and mine sat there for a minute.  That being said, they have a Golden Egg machine which I haven't seen since I was a wee one!"
"I was excited to try Feed because of all the positive reviews, but I feel as if I missed something. The food was bland and cold. It came up short of my expectations. The spinach was greasy and too garlicky, the mac and cheese had no flavor, and the pulled pork had a weird aftertaste. I ordered a well done burger and it was burned on the outside and pink in the middle. My husband and I might give it a second chance, but not anytime soon."
"This place was recommended to us a few years back for 1 amazing dish. Every time we come here, at least one of us gets it and we are always impressed at the simplicity and goodness of it. What is it such wonder, you may ask? PULLED PORK HASH. What genius decided to combine their perfectly smoked pork (can sub with chicken too) with sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, onion and peppers + top it off with a few eggs??? Its perfect. This time around my husband ordered the hash with chorizo, which had a totally different taste profile to my (you guessed it) pulled pork hash. Feed to me is more of a winter dining brunch place (even though they have a great patio), so they will be seeing us a lot more... The place inside is always a riot (love those chickens!) and the waitstaff is interesting, to say the least :) Go enjoy! Its on the list for us to try to come back for dinner and try some more serious bbq...mmmmmmm"
Have been here many times over the years and it is always a pleasant experience. The food is solid good comfort food with a southern twist. My favs are usually the specials like this past weekend fried trout for breakfast. Their fried green tomato eggs benedict is pretty killer too. Oh and I think they are BYOB.
"Funky diner with ironic hillbilly decor with some inspired dishes.  I think they could stand to improve the tastiness of their food a bit, but other than that, it's a neat little place."
"I've now eaten in once and lunch today was take out. To be honest I can't remember what I even ate when I ate in. The restaurant itself was cutely attired though, that I do remember.So today I ordered the 1/4 dark Chicken with 2 sides. My sides were the mashed potatoes/gravy and the beet salad....I have to say the chicken was only- good. I felt it could have roast a little longer on the spit (meat was a little to clingy to the bone). The mashed potatoes were pretty darned good, but that might have been the gravy's bragging rights. Then there was my little star- the beet salad. Not only is it the prettiest pink it could be the magic bullet to make adults eat their vegetables. I wouldn't be against getting this to bring home and douse it with my own walnuts and goat cheese. I shudder with delight!"
"I don't know why it has taken me so long to review this joint.  Big things are poppin' over here.  Most of the best Southern food is offered here.  The closest reminder to my beloved comfort greasepits in the Dirty Dirty.The fried catfish sandwich and the pulled pork are my favorites.  The pulled pork doesn't get too sloppy, yet maintains an excellent flavor.  They do a pretty decent job at emulating Southern-style entrees and sides (or vegetables, if you're regionally speaking).  The portions are huge and in a major win for this place, they let you replace the cole slaw with extra fries.  That, reader nation, is what I call ""boogielicious"".  It's kitschy and hip inside, and it's quite inexpensive for the amount of food you get.  Add BYOB on top of that, and you have success.  I wonder if they ever thought about capitalizing on drunk and horny hipsters filing out of the Continental at 5am and serve them drunk food, just a thought.What does this all mean? DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAY!joemygod.blogspot.com/20…"
"I tend to give credit when it is due and give restaurants the benefit of the doubt and in the case of FEED a review is much over due.I have been dining at feed for the better part of the last 3 years sometimes going multiple times in a single week.  Everything I have had there has been beyond exceptional.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner if you like homestyle cooking this is one of the best.  On the weekends they have specials for brunch, one of my favorites being chicken fried steak and eggs.  Make sure not to miss out on their fried ocra if it is in season.Delicious-ness!"
"Feed reminds me of my time in Texas, driving long dusty roads in search of civilization and good food, except that with Feed, you get your funky civilization and juicy chicken without driving two hours for the next gasoline and BBQ stand.  And for that, we thank you.The chicken here is amazing - so, so, juicy and tender, with a crispy spicy skin.  How juicy, you may ask?  So juicy that my hands were soaked after eating it.  And yes, you should eat this with your hands.  Who are you, Donald Trump?As sides go, ask for biscuits, even if they aren't on the big board.  The owner may be able to ""make that happen"" for you, as he did for me.  Its worth it, they are fresh and flaky and delicious coated with the house honey.  I'm not sure where they get their honey, but it tastes a lot better than the store bought honey bear variety.The decor is rustic farmhouse, evoking an Elvis soaked tour of Route 66.  Bring a six pack of Lone Star and dive in.  Highly recommended."
"Number one problem....walking 2 miles to get to Feed in 100 degree heat...and finding that the patio was CLOSED.  Apparently it was just too damn hot.  Sigh...well, at least the air conditioning worked - well, sort of.A nice thing about Feed is that it's BYOM - that's Bring Your Own Mimosa for you folks.  They gave us a huge glass of juice and we brought our champagne - quite good.I'll continue with pricing....this spot is really reasonably priced and portions are large.  No complaints there - $60 for 5 people?  That's a good deal.However, I thought the food was just ok.  I had eggs, sausage and potatoes.  They were good, but nothing spectacular.  The corn bread that I got with my meal was dry.  The flavor was good, but I couldn't finish it due to the dry texture.  I also tried one pancake as a side.  I wasn't super impressed with the pancake - I had to douse it in syrup to eat it because it was also dry.  I think that had it been slightly less thick, it would have been better.  The bathrooms were ok, pretty clean and had interesting pics up.As to atmosphere, we really wanted to eat outside and we weren't able to.  Inside was ok and had some funky stuff, but it was just ok.I wouldn't make the trek out here just to eat, but if you're in the area, it is ok."
"I love Feed.  We go to Feed at least once/week.As long as Ryan or Ian is there, I am happy as can be service-wise.  We usually get a whole chicken with 3 sides and banana pudding for $20 for 2 (how could anyone possibly beat that price?!?!).  And I have leftovers for lunch for the next day.  My favorite three sides are the SPINACH, the mac & cheese and the broccoli.  My husband loves the hand cut fries.  The succotash, corn bread and parsnips all have been winners as well.The brunch is the best in the city.  My favorite is the fried green tomatoes eggs benedict.  My husband thinks that the biscuits and gravy is the best he's had ever.  The chicken fried steak was one of the best.  The meatloaf was the top two of his life.  Its BYOB, kid-friendly and just down-to-earth awesome.  The music changes depending on who is working but we almost always are happy with the selections.  I still have not gotten my golden egg yet but I can be patient.I probably should mention the banana pudding another 800 times because its that good.  But if you are not interested, thats fine.  More for me ;)  Go to Feed!  You can't go wrong."
"My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner at Feed a little over a month ago. The entire experience, from calling to inquire about availability through to the unbelievable banana pudding for dessert, was really excellent. We invited 45 people to eat on the back patio, and Feed's staff helped us come up with a set selection from their menu that gave our guests lots of options and more than enough food. Everything was as good or better than it always is when we go on our own for dinner--cooked exactly right, full of flavor, and served by warm and friendly staff. We'll be back soon for more."
"Are you an unpretentious chicken hawk, who likes to hang out at original little places that feel like they're on the edge of town? Do you have a manly appetite and a love of big food and Texan retro-rustic roadhouses? Then you need to dig in your talons here and set for a spell. Feed is a place which will make you one happy hawk.And make sure to bring your appetite. The 1/4 chicken dinner with two sides is enough to feed the haven't-eaten-all-day predator. The chicken seems so fresh that it may have been raised out back. Tender, fresh and flavorful. And the sides are copious and bursting with flavor, too. No coleslaw in a thimble here, kids. Have your dining buddy order ones different from yours and you can get taste of 4 sides: in our case, the greens, the mac 'n cheese, the beets, and the corn pudding. I could have eaten a large bowl of those beets, which must be flavored with fresh ginger. They are superb. They also offer a 4 sides for $5.49 choice, which would definitely fill you up by itself. And a nice vegetarian option (if you pull the big chunks of meat from the greens.)This is a great little family spot, too, as there were a number of these, presumably neighborhood folk, packing the place by the time we left. The friendly and unassuming staff, the poultry-phernalia and pics everywhere, the whimsical decor, it;'s all good. And what a great value, too. I'd make the trip here anytime for an instant replay of last night's meal. And put it on my breakfast/brunch list. BYOB, too!  I'm going to be squawkin' up this joint for awhile. Big food. Small tab."
Excellent food. Excellent service.
No frills but solid.  Check the menu ahead and if it looks good- pay this place a visit and you will get what's expected.
This place is awesome...5 stars every time.  Nice staff that looks like they work their butt off.  It's clean place that gets the job done every time.
"I had the best, and my first ever, pulled pork sandwich here. Divine. Wet back for a second and literally saw a teetering dying tiny mouse sitting on their dining room floor. Was told by the staff that it was due to some chemicals being sprayed next door...unfortunately couldn't eat one bite of my food that night and will never go back again."
Love this place.  Best chicken ever.  Also love the jumbalaya or however you spell that stupid word
"Service was amazing, food was wonderful and they gave everyone complimentary desert at the end of the meal. Super accommodating with all requests and questions. They had the foresight to make sure vegetarians weren't accidentally eating meat. great place."
"This place rocks. My only regret was that I was NOT hungover when I went to brunch here, because the Shrimp cakes that I had would have been the most suburb remedy ever for my non-existent hangover. I got the shrimp cakes with spinach and potatoes (subbed for grits) and was very pleased with the whole experience. A tad disappointed the spinach wasn't hot/cooked, but not enough in this case to warrant any reduction in points. Co-eater got the sweet potatoe hash topped with scrambled eggs, and he seemed pretty happy as well.Next time will definitely bring some beverage supplies and make a full morning of it. Service was fantastic, friendly and fast. Side note, I left a chapstick on the table, and the server literally chased me down Chicago avenue to return it to me! Now, that's service!"
"Decent, solid, fun, eclectic are what fed my thoughts about this restaurant. I've been trying to drive more and get out to some different places to eat and this is one of those places that I was excited to try and am glad I did. The food is definitely more Southern style (just don't get it mixed up with Soul Food, which is my favorite and doesn't even compare). I must say, the best parts of my meal were the cheesy grits (yumm!) and the Eggs Benedict which is served on top of their cornbread. I don't know if the cornbread would stand on its own, but underneath all that yumminess, it was delicious! The rest of the food was okay, not totally outstanding, but definitely not bad. The service was good and the everyone was nice. It's definitely a homey comfortable place to go. No need to dress up and no need to put on a fake face; just come as you are...Oh, and bring CASH only!"
"My husband and I loved feed. We both love ""comfort"" food and grew up with chicken, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, etc.. Feed was a big hit for us. We went in on Sunday for dinner. I had the 1/4 Chicken light. I don't often eat bone chicken (high school job at KFC kind of ruined it for me). Bone Chicken...I am back. This was the best chicken ever!  The rub on the chicken was a little spicy and the sauce you get with it is like a fire roasted salsa almost. Dang, it was delicious. For my two sides, I got mashed potatoes and gravy and mac and cheese. The gravy was sooo good. I usually am only a breakfast gravy type girl, but I was glad I went with gravy.  The mac and cheese is a drier type, but I like mac and cheese any and all ways. The lemonade was soooo good and free refills!My hubby got the hamburger. I had a bite and it was good, but he was definitely jealous of his wife. It's cash only, so think ahead. And don't forget change for the egg machine. I did, and I was crushed :(I need to try soooo much more stuff here. Fried Catfish. Okra. Etc Etc Etc. We will be back soon."
"Love this place! The food is never a dissapointment and cole slaw and lemonade are amazing. My only problem is the fries, they taste odd and are almost always not edible."
"This is why I love Chicago. There are so many hidden gems out there, I've lived her for 10 years and am still finding new places to eat. Had the 1.4 light with house salad and yellow rice. Chicken was perfection.....amazing. Food came out fast and with a smile. Nothing fancy here, but no need, this place is all about the food. Reasonably priced as well."
"I really wanted to love this place but my experience was one of the worst I've had a in a long time. We arrived at Feed around 11am, there was plenty of seating inside and out. We sat in the back terrace and quickly noticed that there was only one waitress for the whole restaurant. Honestly, I felt really bad for her, there's no way that one person can handle the whole restaurant on their own. I ordered the fried green tomato dish was a great when it finally came. However, I got my food but nothing to eat it with. After 10 minutes I got the waitress to give me cutlery. My boyfriend ordered the Denver omelette, which I kid you not came at least 20 minutes after I got my food! We weren't the only ones having a bad time, I saw at least 2 tables get up and leave because the service was so bad."
"Oh Yum!After a failed attempt to have brunch at another spot which had a 1+ hr wait, we fell back and went to Feed on the recommendation of one of our brunch goers.  Couldn't have been happier with the results. We walked in and sat down, no wait! Not bad of a group of six + toddler. I figured I was going to like it when I saw the sign, simply a Rooster in silhouette, and being a fan of Foghorn Leghorn, it was a shoe in!We waited for a little bit for our third party to arrive but then the game was on, a great Southern style menu that included cheese grits, which were light and fluffy and not overly cheesey! My pulled pork has was a nice surprise! And our friends one-year old was too funny as he snuck pieces of potato (red and sweet) as well as green pepper and pulled pork from my plate. I guess I was having so much fun with the little guy, I didn't pay attention to anyone else's meals, but everyone seemed happy. Should also mention our great server who was great as we waited for another friend before our order. She was on top of everything and thus got a 25% tip! I really need to go back here for lunch! :)Shaun"
"Hipster kitchen delight meets tattooed chef with a dash of Southern comfort farm food in Chicago. How is this possible?! I don't know, I don't ask questions, I just eat their delicious breakfast and let the cheerfully warm atmosphere wash over me like a gravy bath.Speaking of gravy baths, they have great biscuits'n'gravy here. In fact, I don't think you can go wrong with the breakfast items here. They serve it seven days a week, but the fun stuff is on the weekends. My friend got the Red Flannel Hash, and there was some serious beet lovin' going on in there. (There's a joke in there somewhere...)I never seem to make it here for lunch, but the sides alone sound amazing: cheese grits, fried green tomatoes, fried okra, etc. It's like Momma's kitchen from Alabama somehow made its way to Chicago's Ukrainian village.I always have a hard-on for restaurant decor, and this one really tickles my fancy. The entire place is outfitted with chicken tsotchkes: paintings, figurines, you name it. Plus the color scheme is really relaxing and cozy-riffic. AND they have a working jukebox. Slap me Sally, I'm sold!I've never had a wait here either, but the place is super small. Great for a post-one night stand when you're feeling vulnerable. It has to mean something when a Texas girl says, ""Get on down to Feed, y'all."""
"I wasn't entirely impressed.I came for brunch and ordered the Fried Green Tomato Benedict, one of their most popular dishes. It was bland and uninteresting. The cornbread pieces were small and chewy. My boyfriend ordered the french toast, which was pretty delicious BUT it didn't come with any sides. So, when ordering your breakfast make sure a side or two. Due to a mix-up in the kitchen, our food arrived cold. I didn't discount any stars though, because surely it was a one-time mistake. I hope.Feed was mediocre, but I suppose the kitschy, chicken themed decor was slightly amusing. Feed was hardly worth the trek (when there are so many brunch destinations in Chicago), but there's plenty of free street parking available if you're so inclined to visit."
a little place with difficult street parking. we ordered fried chicken and some sides. the chicken pieces were over fried and dry. i was very disappointed with our food.
"Good, service, atmosphere... everything was perfect."
"The first time I came here was on a friend's whim. It was on the later side, and Feed was virtually empty, with counter service only. Sitting on the bus bench just down Chicago, I sampled 1) the best spinach I have ever had, 2) some fried catfish that was just ok, 3) pretty good black beans, and 4) pretty good french fries.I came back for brunch and had a similarly uneven experience. This time, there was a waitress, and the place was full but not packed, necessitating a wait of about ten minutes. Once we were seated, the service was brisk and moderately friendly.My fried green tomato Benedict was delicious, featuring perfectly breaded and fried slices of tomato atop moist slices of cornbread, complemented by an unconventionally thin and mustardy Hollandaise sauce drizzled over the poached eggs. The fried potatoes that came on the side were some of the best I've had, but they were, like several other elements of the meal, somewhat less than hot.My spouse bore the brunt of this uneven attention to temperature: both her bland cheesy grits and her biscuits and gravy, the former of which were dry and the latter lacking substance, were little more than lukewarm."
I really wanted to like this place. I liked the decorations and the people working were very nice. The food was bleh and not very hot. I left wishing we hadn't eaten there.
"For months, while my friend lived on Chicago Ave, we thought the Rooster sign was for the bar we'd hit up late night. Every time people asked how to find us, we'd just tell them to look for the rooster. Through my yelp searching, I found Feed and laughed when one of the pictures was of the rooster sign. Changed my world...Feed's about as cozy as it gets. It reminds you of a down home restaurant in the deep south, maybe even someones kitchen turned into a restaurant. Great breakfast. I went on a week day, so I didn't get to see them truly shine. On Sunday's they do brunch, which had a lot of desirable items. Never the less, the breakfast I had was awesome. Standard fare, but done right with no mistakes.I also recommend checking out Feed for lunch or an early dinner, they have an impressive menu of Soul food. This is going to have to be my first of three reviews for Feed, because I truly haven't experienced them to the fullest quite yet."
"CASH ONLY!  CHEAP!  BYOB!  (don't forget your corkscrew)EARLY KITCHEN---CLOSES ABOUT 9 PM MOST EVENINGS.The family and I have only been here for dinner.  We've never yet tried brunch, breakfast, nor lunch.The best deal here is to get a whole chicken with three sides!  3-4 people can share it.  That's about $16 plus tax and beverages, etc. divided by the number of diners!  NO ONE can beat this!You enter, order, go to your table and wait to be called to the counter to pick up your plate(s).  After eating, you bus your own table.BTW---everything is served with plastic dishes, plastic cutlery, plastic glassware.The decor is chicken---every type, age, color---and country.  Every time we enter, there's a new something---painted on the wall, on display, something has been added.  There are some tables covered in old-fashioned patterned oil cloths.  Nothing fancy.  Tons of plants in the one front window.  This is rotisserie chicken at it's best.  Moist, succulent and deliciousness served simply.  Their sides are very good.  Our favorites include the beet salad, mashed potatoes with gravy, and sweet potatoes.  We simply don't understand the flour tortilla that is underneath every order of chicken, nor the peculiar salsa cum sauce that sides every order of chicken.  We use the bottled hot sauce on the table.The greens are TERRIBLE.  We've tried them more than once and NO ONE in our family can finish them---very disappointing because everything else at Feed is good.Every day they have special sides and a special dessert-homemade pie, homemade cake.  Sometimes these are unusual---like a green tomato cake with green tomato butter cream frosting---DELICIOUS.The beverages----you order, they give you a glass & you fill it from the pitcher out near the tables.   If you BYOB, request glasses, there'll be no problem.  If you want water, request glasses & fill them with ice water from the pitcher on the table.They have an outside patio in the summer, but we've never tried it.Street parking is no problem."
"This place is pretty remote. My GF and I rode our bikes over here on our bikes and went in. The menu is fairly simple and other than Chickens roasting there are slim pickings when it comes to the menu which is basically just sandwiches. If you are looking for a real BBQ (ribs, beef brisket, etc., you won't find it here). We ordered a couple of pulled pork sandwiches which came with giant heaps of hand-cut french fries and a good, but not great slaw. The pork was well prepared and yummy, and the fries were amazing. Other diners were eating a pile of sides like tapas and drinking beer. We had sodas, and were pretty happy with our meal, but it seems I would only come here for the chicken since it seems to be the only thing they focus on. I kept wondering if we might drive further west and find some real Southern BBQ. Overall, a good place to have a solid sandwich with fries or a ""sides as dim-sum"" experience for under 30 bucks. BYOB."
"This is my first Yelp review and I felt like I had to write up this experience as it was one of the worst restaurant trips I've ever had. My roommate and I went to Feed for brunch and sat in the patio outback. It was a nice day and the menu looked interesting so we were looking forward to our food. I ordered the puller pork hash and my roommate ordered the eggs benedict. After ordering, our food was taking a while to come out. I noticed that another table had received our same order but wasn't eating it. Our waitress had disappeared for about 15 minutes and when the other table was finally able to get her attention, they let her know that this wasn't what they had ordered. She proceeded to bring the food back to the kitchen and then reemerge and ask us what we had ordered. When we told her, she went back and brought the same food out that had already been sitting out for 20 minutes and was cold. We didn't have silverware so she said she would go get some for us. Another 10 minutes pass and we still have no silverware, our food is cold, and we could not even get her attention to let her know that we were walking out. Service that bad is unacceptable and everyone on the patio felt the same way. Another table who had not received their food, gave us their silverware because it was that apparent we were trying to get her attention."
"best collard greens i've had in awhile...and the hot sauce for the chicken is amazing.  if i could swim in a tub of it, i would."
"If you are addicted to ""coqs"" (which is really much better and not as worrisome as addictions to its two English homonyms.......yes you know what I mean), Feed is definitely your farmyard dream come true.They are everywhere!!!!!!!!!!!But if you prefer chicks - well, you are in luck too.This place is really cute and low-key, very un-Chicago-brunch-scene like. No pretense, no fancy menus - you are here to be fed. Period.My plate of fried green tomatoes benedict did a good but unimpressive job. Tasty but too unidimensional and rather on the dry side. Fortunately coffee was flowing and the service was nice with this ""thanks sweetie"" vibe that I like.PS - Coqs = roosters in French. PM me if you want to know the translations of its, um, two homonyms."
"I'm always on the lookout for a new place for breakfast, and Feed has become my new standard by which all others will be judged. I loved it. I had checked out the menu online and had already narrowed my choices to the fried green tomato benedict or the sweet potato hash.When our server reviewed the specials, she totally had me at roasted beets. Yes, my friends, roasted beets...deliciously and boldly enveloped with spinach in a perfectly seasoned and tasty fritatta with two slices of deep red and flavorful roma tomato and fresh basil.I know. I know. Beets are kinda like Patti LaPone--you either love 'em or hate 'em. Faced with three choices, I left the decision solely to the server. Hands down, the fritatta...her very own creation, she shared. The food was outstanding. Just realizing I didn't even consider salt or pepper. My only fraction of a point deduction from a perfect score would be that the coffee could have been hotter, but that's just my own preference. Will definitely be back...soon!"
"Oink goes the Pig... Moo says the Cow... Cluck, Cluck from the Chicken... And you too can silence all those little bastards by shoving their tasty goodness immediately into your mouth at the uber-cute and kitschy Southern comfort digs of FEED!! Thank heavens for the sweet Miss Becky W. who led the way to this amusing little shanty, because I guarantee I would never have stumbled upon this casual chicken coop on my own. On an unassuming and eerily quiet stretch of Chicago it was certainly a surprise to find such a kooky, tasty, fun little hideout. Buzzing with couples, kids, cops and our fab femme posse, Feed is obviously a hot choice for a fantastically affordable meal when you want some down home cooking in your belly. Munch on everyday Southern favorites like succulent fried green tomatoes, yummy collard greens, creamy mac 'n cheese, crispy fried okra, sufferin' succotash and tangy, tartar-y catfish sandwiches. Mmmm Mmmmm, it was quite easy for these 4 delicate flowers to decimate this menu!! Looking for a healthier bite? The signature Feed rotisserie chicken comes with an amazing house-made salsa and can be paired with a side green salad, perfect to keep you trim and totally satisfied! Zexy! Also not to be missed: their famed pulled pork sandwich. So rich and tangy piled all high and beautiful up on a bun... it's the perfect item to saddle up to their homemade cole slaw and the most delicious corn puddin' I've ever had! Feed is delicious, cash-only and BYOB... an ideal trifecta win!"
"Feed is a tiny restaurant featuring Southern comfort food like rotisserie-grilled chicken, grits and fried green tomatoes.  It's good, but hardly incredible.The place was fairly packed when I arrived on a Friday night.  There are no waiters, you just go up to the counter and order off the chalk menu board.  I had 1/4 chicken (light) with fries and mashed potatoes.  Honestly, the highlight was the fries.  They were crisp without being crunchy or burned.The chicken was moist and tender, but I would have loved some sort of barbecue sauce for it.  It was screaming for something extra.  The plate came with tortillas and a tiny cup of salsa.  Not sure what I was supposed to do with that.The beverage situation was disappointing.  If you order a soda, things are great.  You can go up to a cooler and grab a fresh 12 oz. can whenever you need a refill.  But I ordered water.  When it came time for a refill, I had to choose between one of two fairly unclean-looking pitchers sitting near the front.  Also, there was no way to get fresh ice, aside from asking for a new cup at the counter.  Lukewarm refill of unfiltered tap water it is!Feed isn't bad.  It's pretty good.  But unless you happen to live in the neighborhood, I don't see why you'd make the trip."
"Whoever said that this place is a rip off must be CRAZY.VERY generous portions of home-style southern cooking for what they cost.Any time my guy and I can stuff ourselves silly for under $20 is a damn fine deal.The pulled pork is superb, the chicken is falling-off-the-bone juicy, and the decor is so fun and funky!I live only 2 blocks away so I have to be careful how often I come here - or I wouldn't fit through the door any more.  Mmmmmmmm."
"If you're craving delicious, indulgent, semi-Southern soul food, this is THE PLACE to get it on the Chicago west side! I grew up in Kentucky, so I know chicken and southern cookin' - this place really gets it right!Feed's magical array of sides include: corn pudding (the best option), hand-cut fries, collard greens, mashed potatoes and gravy, and much, much more. The patio is a wonderful place to eat dinner in the warmer months, and the place is BYOB!Feed is equally delicious for brunch, lunch, and dinner, but keep in mind that their delicious birds aren't usually served until sometime after noon."
"Holy Hell! I now know where I need to go when I'm feeling a Calorie Fest coming on. Enter into Feed: The decor is totally kitschy. There are loads of chicken and rooster pictures on the walls, there's a vintage juke box (broken today, they're waiting on a part) that's free AND has good music like Bread and Patsy Cline, a weird little electric piano and a chalkboard showcasing the menu. And that menu only has, like, 7 choices, including fried chicken, pulled pork or chicken and catfish sandwiches and a burger thrown in for good measure. The sides are Southern cooking staples like mac n cheese, greens, okra, corn pudding, rice, succotash, etc. You get the picture. The lovely gal behind the counter, who looked straight out of Tobacco Road, but in the best way possible, told me the menu was small, so everything on it is great. She offered up a sample of the pulled BBQ pork, which had just been taken out of the smoker, to convince me. Um, yes! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with fries and slaw and I added a side of mac n cheese to try. Add a can of diet Coke that I pulled out of the vintage Coca-Cola Classic cooler and my total came to a cool $11. Not bad, not bad. Our number came up very quickly (you order at the counter, at least on a Monday afternoon) and my friends and I dug in with gusto. I consider my friend Angela a Southern cooking expert, so I knew when she was loving her greens, BBQ pork sandwich and cole slaw that Feed was the real deal. My pork sandwich was awesome, as mentioned before and my other friend's catfish sandwich rocked. My one teensy complaint was that the mac n cheese could have been served a bit hotter, temperature wise. Although we initially declined dessert, Ms. Tobacco Road brought us a complimentary sample of the banana pudding, which was HEAVEN. Honestly, so fatty and yummy that it left that coat of lard on the roof of my mouth after I finished it. Again, I say this only with love. Not the lightest lunch I've ever had, in fact, probably the most out-and-out calorie-ridden feast I've partaken in in quite some time. But I emerged from Feed full and happy. And then promptly fell asleep on my couch for an hour...."
"After avoiding this place for so long (more on this in a second) my boyfriend and I headed over there one morning after our go-to brunch spot was unexpectedly closed for the day. And boy oh boy am I glad that our typical place was closed that day.My dude and I both are pescatarians and ALL we had heard of Feed from local friends was CHICKEN CHICKEN CHICKEN. So, we never ever went. But, we sauntered over there to see if we could just get some eggs (funny enough, related to chickens).The inside was small and adorable but crammed with people. After awkwardly waiting around they finally told us and the other two small groups of people eyeing the tables right next to us that there was a patio open out back. Out we all go to find an adorable semi worn down patio full of little tables and chairs.We were greeted and were surprised and delighted at the menu- I got the fried green tomato egg benedict and he got a feta/tomato/spinach omelette. I devoured...DEVOURED that benny...so so good. Bummer and big thumbs down that its cash only. That's half of a star that I take away. Both of the times we went the severs were eh-okay. Very nice, but pretty slow...and as most of us Chicagoans are hungover on Sunday, way too slow on those water refills.Go, but don't tell too many people. It'll be our little delicious secret."
"I went there for my birthday and they gave me a free piece of pecan pie! Yum! The corn pudding has changed a bit as well as the mac and cheese...I don't care for the change in the mac and cheese and I am still unsure about the change in the corn pudding. I do like the change in the fried green tomatoes...super crisp-not a soggy section and not super greasy either. Spinach is still awesome and instead of red beans they had black beans which were tasty and spicy! Everything else stayed the same and was wonderful! And as always, super friendly staff!"
"Good sides, burgers, fries, sides and chicken. The staff sometimes appears aloof, but it's a fun place and consistently delicious."
"Full disclosure: I have never been here for dinner.BUT their brunch on the weekends is absolutely amazing. The Fried Green Tomatoes Benedict is what dreams are made of. I've become hooked on eggs benedict since tasting this dish, but I have yet to find one I love quite as much. Everything I've had here has been great but I always come back to the benedict.The service is always fast and super nice. In the summer they have a great back patio, but the interior is cute and kitchsy as well. Only downside is that it's small so sometimes there's a bit of a wait. It's also BYOB!"
"I had no idea i was capable of eating that much food. And I eat a LOT, generally speaking, but at FEED I gobbled with so much gusto that I scarcely remembered to breathe. I had the plate of 5 sides, which is really enough food for 4 people. I also sampled my friends' meals... so all in all, I tried salty tasty sukkotash, sweet potato mash, home-style mac & cheese, fried okra, grits, meaty collared greens, melting fried green tomatoes, spiced hand-cut fries, chicken-chicken-chicken, pulled-pork, ginger ale, root beer, apple pie, banana pudding, chocolate cake, aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Crikey. Damn it was good. Cheap, cheerful and delicious. I'm coming back! (Eventually.... after I've had a major detox and eaten lettuce for three months, that is.) This place is casual, don't expect nothin' fancylike - but it's just perfect to take travellers to, especially if they aren't familiar with southern-style cuisine."
"A favorite. Consistently tasty, well priced, good vibe, and friendly. If the bowl of shame ever makes an appearance on the brunch menu, GET IT."
Brought our own champagne and has mimosas all morning. Great service and cash only with ATM inside. Great breakfast. Recommend to everyone!
"Pumpkin french toastGreen tomato eggs benedictRotisserie chickenCheese gritsMac and cheeseFried OkraSo I've decided to revamp how I review places, putting the things I ordered first b/c I've noticed when I go to places I've read on Yelp, I'm frantically trying to scan all the reviews to find out what people ordered. I hope this works (comments welcomed)French toast- couldn't really discern the pumpkin, but it was good, not too eggy french toastGreen tomato benedict- very tasty, tangy green tomatoes, good lil comboChicken- I just clump all rotisserie chicken into the same, I was expecting fried like Laela did. Cheese grits- umm, could lay on the cheese a bit moreMac and cheese- I think this was the place that had some kick to the mac and cheese? refer to othersFried okra- standard. Waitress was fantastic, she was so sweet and fun. She made it a good visit. Another pro: no parking drama. Tons of free street parking."
"Similar to a roadhouse diner in decor, Feed is a no-frills, byob spot that focuses on one thing most animal-eating people consume: the mighty chicken.This place has lots of personality, and is next to the Continental.  For a while they served the chicken with flour tortillas.  Ignore those tortillas and just eat the chicken, with some sides, and you'll be happy!SIDE TIP: A whole chicken with 3 sides is a great dinner choice, however, if you like vegetables and are splitting the chicken with more than 2 people, I strongly recommend getting an additional side or two.The desserts are pretty nice, and I also enjoy the beet salad, corn pudding, and broccoli when they have it.  The corn pudding is something that not everyone will like, but I enjoy it.  Sometimes they have fried okra.  If you like fried okra, or if you've never tried it, please go to Honey1 BBQ, unless you want to eat breading that has okra in it.Overall tho, this place is nice, and of course, I will be back."
"Great atmosphere, fun cartoons, nice servers, good food. Chicken fried steak is delicious. Also like the BBQ chicken sandwiches. Good mashed potatoes. You can't go wrong here."
"They really try hard to mock a backwoods southern redneck truck stop, or at least something from a Tom Waits song. What they succeed in doing is creating cafeteria food in an urban thrift store. I love country, redneck, truck stop food. I think Tom Waits does too. Maybe that is why I hate this place. They took something holy and destroyed it."
"When you are hungover and want a big plate of gluttonous food, this is your place. They are a southern-themed restaurant serving brunch and dinner. I've been here 3 times for brunch and it was always excellent. The staff was friendly and refilled my coffee over and over, which is what I need on those weekend-after mornings. I've tried some pancake specials which were good, but nothing spectacular. I am, however, addicted to the pulled pork hash, which has large chunks of pulled pork and instead of the typical plain potatoes, it has sweet potatoes. Hallelujah! Of course, there are the eggs on top, which I get over-easy so that the goo from the yolk pours all over the hash to make it one big mass of deliciousness.  I've also had the biscuits n' gravy and the chicken-fried steak, which is drenched in gravy-goodness. Both are excellent. Oh, and they always serve toast, but it always just sits on the plate looking quite simple compared to my mound of hangover-helper.Oh yeah, and there are cocks all over the place..."
"You can't go wrong with places that serve breakfast until 3p. My spinach and feta omelet was flat with crispy edges and pretty average. But I was likely asking for it having ordered the healthiest thing on the menu at a southern restaurant. I snagged a bite of the hash and had delish sweet potatoes in it. Game changer. My table also raved about the cheese grits and biscuits and gravy. If you are hungover and in the mood for a meal of fried carbs with a side of meat, this is your place. I've always said I wanted to be raised in the south but maybe I'll take that back. Cute place though."
"Wow, I last wrote about Feed in 2007. As one of my very favorite places to eat I feel it's time for an update. I am a huge fan of their brunch. They always have several specials and I almost always order one of those. Someone needs to tell their cook how great he is... he has come up with some seriously amazing dishes (the Louisiana Scramble may be in my top 5 breakfasts). I want to hire him to come to my apartment and make me breakfast every morning. So yeah, brunch is probably my favorite time to go to Feed. Since it's BYOB you can bring champagne, order orange juice and make your own mimosas. Or you can just sit on their lovely patio while enjoying your delicious breakfast. It's one of my favorite weekend activities in the summer. Of course since I would hate for them to get too busy during brunch (lest I need to start waiting to get a table on the patio) I will also continue to sing the praises of their lunch and dinner foods. It's comfort food, pure and simple. Chicken, mashed potatoes, corn pudding, sauteed spinach, pulled pork, black beans... I mean what more could you want? Fried okra?  Ok, fine, they have that too.As always, save room for pie.  It's served warm with ice cream on top.  As I write this though I'm reminded of why I didn't update this review sooner... whenever I think about the food at Feed I want to go there and gorge myself."
"I promised my mentee I'd take her to brunch. The initial plan was to go to Bongo Room or Hot Chocolate, but I quickly decided I wasn't up for the wait today. Enter FEED. I live fairly close and I've eyed the place a zillion times while at the Continental. I was a little hesitant about taking her to Feed b/c she's 10, and well...most 'urban,' 10 year olds wouldn't exactly appreciate the exquisite decor :) that Feed boasts (and urban isn't synonymous w/ Black--by urban, I mean....""cityish?""I just knew she'd side-eye the decor and theme. And despite me ""warning"" her that ""...the place isn't fancy, but the food will be delish,"" she indeed, made a snarky comment about the place. UNTIL...we saw Ryan. Oh Ryan. He opened the door for us and made us feel welcome right away.  I can't explain it, but he kind of had this mechanic look/swag going on. It works. He was sooo pleasant. Pleasant demeanor. And def pleasant to look at (ha!) He told us to have a seat and he'd take good care of us. And he did.He helped choose a dish and was very accommodating and nice. He seemed like a natural w/ children and my mentee loved him (about as much as I did.) Everyone's dish I eyed, looked DELICIOUS. I wish they had more dessert options, but maybe next time, I guess.Oh...and they have sweet tea. :) He somehow guessed on the 1st try where I was from. I think my asking for sweet tea may've tipped him off?? :-/In any case, I enjoyed Feed and will DEF go back. Good food and more than decent prices. She *loved* her chicken. It's not often that kids like rotisserie chicken, but she raved about it. I shall return soon. And give it its extra star. But, only if Ryan is working.  *black girl blushing* *hangs head in shame.* :-/"
"I can't say that I was totally Wowed by Feed, but I walked away from my brunch with nothing bad to say about it. The food was great, the staff was awesome and the dinning experience was fun and relaxing. The wonderful and beautiful Kate W. took us to feed for our Yelp Charity date. It turned out to be a beautiful morning to sit outside, drink Mimosa's, have some good grub and enjoy some wonderful company. The inside of feed is quite artsy and loud, but the outdoor dining area in back is beautiful. I wish I had a place that nice in my back yard where I could just chill out and decompress after a long work day. The food was wonderful. I ordered a artery-logging,Country Fried Steak that was smothered in Sausage Gravy. It was served with Eggs, Toast and taters. Not only was it delicious, the portions were huge. I rarely take home food when I dine out. I have a pretty hearty appetite, but I got a good two days worth of food from my brunch at Feed. The bottom line on Feed is this: If you are looking for a good, hearty meal in a comfortable setting served up by some good, hard working people, head on down the Feed. They really made a good first impression on me. The staff was fun, helpful and prompt. I can't wait to go back."
"I had been looking for a real brunch place for some time now...you know the kind, where the atmosphere is laid back and comfortable, the food is simple but amazing, and there is little to no wait.  I believe I have found this trifecta of awesomeness here at Feed.The back patio is a tiny oasis - in fact you probably would forget you were even in the city once back here.  Quiet, shaded, easy.  Then the food comes out. I had the special, which was the Louisiana Scramble. Basically it was like a jambalaya (chicken, fish, shrimp) mixed with egg and nicely spiced. This came with a thick, hearty side of grits where the corn flavour just exploded in your mouth.  A hefty serving too that provided me with breakfast the next day.  Amazing coffee and doting service too ensures I will be making a second, third and fourth trip here.  Oh! And BYOB too!"
"i came for a visit here one saturday morning when my parents were in town.  they were a little sketchy about the appearance on the outside - not the nicest of neighborhoods - but were put at ease upon entering the homely establishment.the food was pretty standard - nothing exceptional stuck out in my mind, but it was exactly what you expected to get when ordering.  the vibe inside is just really comfortable.  there's a chicken + plastic egg machine that blew my mind.  my 5 year old self wanted to go play, but it's hard for you to get your parents to view you as a grown up when you don't act like one....**cash only**"
"A cute, casual restaurant, Feed is the perfect place for a casual southern food experience that won't break the bank.The dishes are authentic and very flavorful.  I love the variety of available sides.  The atmosphere is super casual and great for groups (I think we brought in a group of 10 for a mid-week dinner).  I have been there for dinner only, but am excited to try out brunch.It is CASH ONLY, but there is an ATM on site."
"Hands down best Chicken in Chicago. (Better and healthier than Harold's)  If I was only rating the chicken, I would give it 5 stars!!! This is tiny diamond in the rough and I am only dismayed that I have only recently unearthed it. My quick dish: I go for the chicken. End of story. And I can only rate the chicken and all the sides, because that is all that I've tried.  The sides unfortunately just persistently leave me unsatisfied for not tasting really fresh or seasoned to my liking (with the exception of the greens and the fries). The ambiance is adorable.  I feel like I'm walking into a country store front in the middle of Iowa.  Roosters abound!  So, given that I am not impressed with the majority of the  sides and I still return pretty consistently, you should definitely check this place out! ESPECIALLY if your local.  I'm on this kick of doing my best to find local gems to support so as to keep my neighborhood growing and thriving."
"Don't come here if you're afraid of the cock. There are literally hundreds of roosters in all forms scattered around this place. Feed has a very unique/interesting decor despite the all of the roosters, though. The only time I felt uncomfortable was in their bathroom. Mostly because of the egg pictures.Anyway, I've tried a couple different dishes here. I've had the pulled pork and it was fantastic. The cornbread pudding was fantastic as well. The slaw is pretty good but a bit heavy on the acidic side. The fries are mediocre but there aren't many places I've been to in the city yet that have initiated an out of body experience.Aside from being cash only (which isn't a huge deal since their prices are low), there really isn't much around this place to bounce around to unless you're looking for a couple packed bars on the weekend to visit afterwards. I'll just qualify it as a Humboldt Park diamond in the rough. If you're in the neighborhood you should give it a go."
"I have yet to have something here I wouldn't order again. Pulled pork sandwich, pork chops, the chicken, coleslaw, fries are all great. Try the MAC-n-cheese, I think they put chorizo in it, very tasty. Also Love the brunch from here, the potatoes it comes with are delicious."
"Very much enjoyed my time at feed. I had the hash, which was my first experience with hash (of any sort), so I cannot compare, however I enjoyed every bite of it. It wasn't super greasy, so it deceivingly permitted me to not feel as guilty when I looked down and my plate was empty. The fresh squeezed orange juice was the perfect addition to my BYOB Brut AND I got to relive a moment of my childhood by putting a quarter into the chicken machine and earning my very own egg. I can't wait to come back and try one of the mammoth sandwiches I saw being taken to tables around me. Service was great too.CASH ONLY!"
Lucky they don't serve booze or else I would've hung out and ate all day!
"Feed is a revelation. This place exists at the far edge of Ukie Village, just far enough that you probably won't pass by it unless you work or have band practice near there. However, it's absolutely worth seeking out.The big draw, for me, will remain their pulled pork sandwich. I love a number of BBQ places in town, but the sandwich here satisfies more than anywhere else. I recommend subbing out a side for the mac and cheese - it's an honest version of the classic with a little spice. There's plenty of good places to get mac and cheese in town, but at Feed they don't fuss with the bread crumbs or peculiar ingredients. If you are looking to get adventurous, though, Feed is still right there for you, with a substantive list of daily specials and unusual Southern dishes (well, unusual for a lifelong Chicago area resident.)Finally, I'd be remiss in not mentioning how wonderful brunch is at Feed - especially in warmer months. They've got a fenced-in back patio area where you can eat when it's nice out, their adventurousness extends to their brunch specials, their fruit pancakes often include fresh fruit with its city of origin listed - what's not to love? The prize for me, though, is the chicken fried steak. Not fancy, but a serious meal - a big steak, two eggs, potatoes, and toast. It's a A+ #1 hangover cure. It can raise the dead, and kill the living. Enjoy!"
"What makes this place unique and keeps me coming back:A. Chicken -- I'm sad there's no fried chicken, but the chicken that they have has a nice broiled flavor and is very juicy. B. The sides/dessert -- Corn pudding, greens, beets, banana pudding...it's southern and it's awesome. The last time I went in, they gave me a sauce for the chicken -- I have no idea what's in it, but I've never had anything like it and it's great :)C. Service -- every time I'm here, the people are friendly. It's almost odd, but the employees seem genuine about making small talk and giving you recommendations on what to order (because it's hard to pick!).D. The decor -- Admittedly, this place is ugly and as campy as can be, but they get an A for creating a fun atmosphere. E. A southern-style brunch with unique dishes. The sweet potato hash and shrimp cakes are AMAZING.Great comfort food and I love supporting a local business; always leaving with a smile on my face."
"Great place with good food and a cool, out-of-the-ordinary feel. And the BYO factor is awesome too! If you've never been, you really should check this place out. Spinach salad is a great (albeit HUGE) thing to start with.  However, I'm writing this (my first) review for the humanity I saw last night there while eating dinner. A not well off woman (homeless??) came in to eat, it's winter mind you, and cold; my GF and I watched as she appeared to be pulling coins and some paper money from everywhere on her person to pay. My GF went over to engage her and offer to pay for the meal. The woman thankfully accepted her offer; she went to pay, but was told that it was already taken care of, as in the staff was paying for it.   Moreover, the person who was taking orders (Erika I think?) and running the show, sat down and talked with the woman as she ate, getting up four or five times, with lightening speed, to help customers, then coming right back to talk, and probably more important, listen. Good stuff...was happy to have seen that little bit of kindness and generosity play out in front of us."
"Consistently good food food in a place that looks like a shack in a small Texas town.   Love the BYOB options and the weekly specials are the true secret in this place. Hanger steak with blue cheese butter..... Is this heaven?     If you love just a good meal, head to this little corner of goodness."
"I really like brunch. No wait. I LOVE brunch. I also love eggs Benedict.  Eggs Benedict for brunch is just about perfect. Feed's version of a classic was my version of brunch heaven. Replace the English Muffin with some corn bread, add some friend tomatillos, poached eggs, and Hollandais sauce. WOW! This was so freakin' delicious. Oh the gooey yolk mixing in with the sauce and the bread.......siiiiiiiiigh. My companions swear by the pulled pork hash. Which I tasted. It was pretty amazing too. Add in some never ending coffee, fresh squeezed OJ, and a super nice waitress. This was a lovely breakfast. There is also a stack of kids books in the front if you come in with mini people.  We (being a full table of adults) thoroughly enjoyed one about rock and roll babies. I would love to eat my way through their entire menu at some point as I hear their non brunch fair is pretty rockin' too. So, next time Feed.  Meanwhile, keep doing what you do."
"I'm too tired to give a strong and long-winded review Feed.  Maybe it's because I'm still digesting the 5 pounds of Louisiana Scramble they served me for brunch and I have no blood going to my brain.  Maybe it was ALL THAT DAMN MEAT they fit in there between bits of eggs, creamy grits, and fresh veggies.  Maybe it was the biscuits, so full of butter that they melted immediately on my tongue.  Maybe it's the 45 minutes of standing with a 50 lbs bag strapped to my back while waiting for a table in this 40-seater.  Maybe it was the service with a smile that lulled me to sleep.I don't know.  But it was good."
"I just added this place into my book of places that are A-ok.  I had no idea walking in that this place was going to have the whole farm theme going on.  I grew up on a farm so I felt right at home.  It was a Sunday afternoon and there were only two other patrons in the place.  Two men who looked like they belonged on a farm, which added to my comfort.  I decided to get the BBQ sandwich which came with fries and coleslaw.  Upon picking up my s'wich the thing fell apart.  It wasn't sopping wet with bbq sauce, so I'm not sure the bun was exactly uh fresh, but I only complained in my head and continued eating because it still tasted good.  And let's face it, I'm not really that picky.  The fries and slaw were pretty good too.  This is the kind of place you should go to if you are craving some good, down home, comfort food.  I am looking forward to returning and trying the pulled pork.  Oh and maybe some of that mac n cheese."
"My love for Feed just continues to grow.  First and foremost, props to a successful business in my neighborhood.  I love to see Humboldt Park grow, and draw people to it.  I also stand in front of Feed every morning while I wait for the bus.  It's right before opening time for them and I get to smell all the delicious smells of their breakfasts.  Monday is my favorite night to go.  I get to fill up on yummy broasted chicken and comfort food sides and then head over to ""Bike Night"" at the Continental Bar after.  I'm a biker chick, get it, har har!The sides have come a long way, when I first came here they were ""eh"".  Now I can't get enough of them.  My faves are the sweet potato fries, mac and cheese and cornbread pudding.  Don't forget to try some of the sweet tea or lemonade.  I'm pretty sure this place is BYO, which just completes me.I don't even mind that the place is CASH ONLY."
OMG....this was the best food I had all weekend in Chicago!  The mac-n-cheese was the best I have ever had.  My husband had the pork hash and hasn't stopped talking about it.  Whenever we come back to Chicago.....this place will be a must.
"Food. Damn good food. Lots of damn good food. They have a fairly limited standard menu: 1/4 chicken, 1/2 chicken, burger, pork sandwich, chicken sandwich, catfish sandwich. All of these are great. Where you want to be looking though, is to the left and the right of the standard menu. Every day, they have about 3 specials that range from shrimp and grits, to the ""workin man special"", which gets you a quarter dark, a side big enough to feed a room full of preschoolers, and a drink, al for about 6 bucks. Trust me, it's plenty of great, happy, homecooked food. To the right is the extensive list of sides. They have about 15, but the mashed potatoes, collard greens, mac and cheese, and CORN PUDDING is where it's at. It's a very casual ""walk up and order, sit down and we'll let you know when your food is ready"" type of place. On the weekends, they have full service brunch until mid-afternoon, and that specials board just LIGHTS up with all kinds of great stuff. On brunch-days, you'll find things like (real) chicken-fried steak, turkey benedict (think thanksgiving dinner meets eggs benedict... yum), pumpkin french toast, or a Louisiana. Every. single. one. of these items will knock your socks off. The prices are decent, the food is great, the staff is friendly, and you leave feeling like you ate a REAL meal... This place really is as good as it gets."
"So homey and freindly and warm.  Talk about comfort food heaven!We had breakfast after a long night out and it was just what we needed.  Chicken fried steak with cheese grits, biscuits and gravy, and an apple compote pancake.  I can't wait to try it for dinner!"
A nice gentleman took me here for lunch and I have to admit the atmosphere is inviting....unfortunately the food did not really deliver. I had the 1/4 white chicken and it was average. I say that because the chicken is called Wonderoast and we can buy it in grocery stores in Iowa so it seemed like nothing special to me...the mac and cheese was completely overdone and soggy. The cheese seemed to be a cheese flavor and they definitely did NOT use real cheese.... The sweet tea was days old with little to no flavor. The fact that they were so nice and that they don't let kids touch the jukebox give them the only two stars deserved....
"COCKADOODLE DOO!  Your pet rooster would be proud.  The atmosphere was warm and fun: torn booth seats, hideous mismatched plastic table cloths, an old jukebox, and posters of the life cycle of a chicken on the wall really set the tone for a hearty meal of comfort food. The indie chick at the counter took my order for 1/4 light chicken, sweet potato fries, and collard greens.  They came atop a few tortilla shells and two dippy sauces.  The dippy sauce was too cold, but I liked the yellow creamy-looking stuff.  The chicken was OK, but come here for the sides.  Collard greens, corn pudding, cole slaw, and sweet potato fries - yummy southern goodness.  FYI: Cash only, Counter-service, BYOB."
"Post-hangover brunch? Check.  Post ""surely we can drink enough coffee to stay awake until the kitchen opens?""  Double check.  ""If it ain't meat, it must be a vegetable""? Triple check.  I head to Feed when I crave a Midwestern take on the food I grew up on - black-eyed peas, chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravy, collard greens, et-deliciously-cetera.  One can, too (and I have), make a meal out of their vegetable sides, too; the garlicky braised spinach is amazing.Props for the ever-friendly table service on weekends.  More props for the poster advertising a Freakwater show at the Earl.  Also: sweet tea! How can you beat it?  You can't."
"Very good food.  Consistent quality.  There are so many exciting restaurants in the city, but if they can't bring their A game every night, a single miss counts way more than a hit.  These guys give a consistent effort, and it's great to have places you can count on whether it be a craving of your own, or wanting to impress guests.  Too many times I've raved about a place only to bring a group on an off night.  Not so at Feed.They don't have an enormous menu, and they do everything on it well.I often go for their special menu items.  Some are a little funky, but I like that they continue to experiment, yet still within the realm of the restaurant's cuisine.  Best thing I've had off the special menu: Crab Cakes Eggs Benedict."
"Feed has -- by far -- my favorite brunch in the city,  but only if it's summer and their patio is involved. I've never had the foresight to bring anything extra to put into the lemonade, but it is byob, and it would probably put Feed's brunch lightyears ahead of anyone else in the area. I love their version of the eggs benedict ... a cornbread muffin with spinach, fried green tomato, poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. Overall, the food is of the 'comfort' variety and leans a little toward southern, or even soul-food cooking (if you ask The Reader at least), so dinner is a can't-miss, too. For dinner, opt up for the half-chicken and the two sides, you won't regret it. The place is a little small, so it can get cramped in the winter, but the free jukebox and country-decor make a wait bearable. Go. Feed."
"Feed is one of my favorite neighborhood eateries. I actually have one of their t-shirts and have worn it while eating there (which I think might have weirded out the employees a bit).  The chicken is always juicy and delicious wether you're getting light or dark, and the sides and specials are fantastic too. I've had brunch there a few times on weekends and despite the fact that it tends to be busy at those times the food remains great and arrives in a timely manner. I could go on forever...but will leave it at the fact that Feed is one of the reasons why I won't leave Humboldt Park."
"Even when I'm unimpressed by a restaurant, I try to give it another shot, to make sure that I wasn't just there on an ""off day"". After tonight's meal, I know that's not the case with Feed.I love comfort food, and roast chicken is at the top of that list. I was so excited to try Feed, as I had only heard good things. The fact that it's within walking distance from my new apartment was the icing on the cake. I've ordered the 1/4 dark meal twice, and the chicken is somewhat bland. I think it's well cooked and does come off the bone easily, but there's not much taste.The sides were really disappointing. Tonight, I had mac n cheese and corn pudding. The mac wasn't very cheesy or saucy at all. In fact, the noodles were dried out as if it had been sitting out for some time. The corn pudding would be best described as ""corn bread crumbs"". Seriously, there was nothing pudding about it.The place is cute and service is nice enough."
"Delicious southern comfort food.Bring cash.Order at the counter, table service on the weekend.Take in the country decor.With an emphasis on chickens.Go Figure.Play a song on the jukebox.Wait for your food.  It'll be up soonEnjoy your dish.  It's all good.Do sit in the outdoor patio during the summer.Return soon.  Bring friends."
"i've been back.  those chicken dinners are something amazing, indeed.  huuuuuuuuge sides and just simple, finger-licking good meat.  go with a bottle of wine on a hot night.  sit in the backyard and hold hands with your sweetie.  or, you could do as i did and bring the new york times and read that instead of talking to your boyfriend.  what??  i'm a slave to current events (and that chicken!).don't forget that it's cash only!"
"I love the decor in this place! It's just... It just reminds me of going to grandma's place in upper Michigan. All the little things around. I don't feel that it was a corporate endeavor, but someone who really thought it out. Pictures of roosters all over the place.So what about the food? Well, of course, I tried the chicken. It was excellent. It's the sides that were leaving me a bit meh, which gives it my standard three-star review versus the four-star it deserves. We had the corn pudding and the mac 'n' cheese, which I believe is a deal breaker.It's BYO and a great value for what you get. It's one of those places I can take my dad and he'd love, so that says a lot. And we've never had a problem parking, usually on California."
"as a disclaimer, this place was sold to me as having incredible southern food................ and i was incredibly disappointed. the food was not awful, but from how i have heard others talk about it, this place is overrated. the chicken was pretty good, but i thought the mashed potatoes were mediocre and the mac and cheese was disgusting. however, they have AMAZING fried okra. i would go back to eat all of the fried okra. and to chat with the employees because they are REALLY nice."
"Feed might otherwise be a 4.5, thanks to its relative distance from what some might call the ""beaten path."" However, the wall of framed prints from the book ""Extraordinary Chickens"" tips the scale solidly back into 5 territory. Coupled with extremely friendly service, no wait for weekend brunch, and some devilishly delicious pulled pork hash, Feed is a great spot for some breakfast that'll stick to your ribs."
"nothing beats a juicy smokey chicken and Feed does not disappointhad the whole chicken with fried okra (little pieces of heaven), beet salad (like the pickled onion in it) and corn pudding (yum)service was friendly, definitely one of my top choices for comfort food"
Ate here twice and was disappointed. Ill try again. Maybe it was a bad time of day.
"I'm a Southern girl, raised in Virginia. My whole family is from Alabama. I know Southern cuisine, and Feed was good, but not ""slap yo mama"" good. Just good. I've only been here for brunch so far though. I had the fried green tomato benedict and cheese grits. The benedict was layered with cornbread, fried green tomatoes, the usual poached egg and hollandaise sauce. Decent; the cornbread was the best part. The cheese grits were eh. I tried a bite of the biscuits and gravy; also decent but not great. The lunch and dinner menu looked really good though. I'll probably be back to try out the fried chicken. It smelled delicious. But overall, this place has nothing on *Dear Dear's cooking... I was a chubby kid :) (*translation for all the Midwesterners... Dear Dear is southern term of endearment for grandma)"
"My friend and I went to Feed for brunch this afternoon and we really had fun! It's a really kitchy place with photos of chickens all over the walls- some were actually kinda frightening!When you go, be aware it's cash only and when you get there you have to sign yourself in on a list. Don't stand around there like an idiot all day wondering where the hostess is- you'll be waiting a long time. When our name was called the option was to either share a table with 2 other girls or we could wait for our own table. We decided to share and wound up with some really hilarious table mates! It made the experience really fun! The waitress (I don't recall her name) was awesome! She was so on the ball and so funny- I felt like I was watching a comedy sketch show or something. I'm pretty sure the girl could sell a ketchup popsicle to a woman wearing white gloves. I mentioned to the waitress that it was my friend's birthday and she brought us a big bowl of banana pudding and the whole restaurant sang to him- I loved it (he may have been embarrassed). As far as the food- I have to say it was quite good. My only complaint was that my pulled pork sandwich hardly had any bbq sauce so I had to get extra to slap on there- but not really a big deal. I actually liked the coleslaw- it was light and fresh tasting- not a heavy super creamy mess.The friend had the biscuits and sausage with gravy and he got fried okra and collared greens. He said the fried okra was ""very low on slime"" and very good. He thought the gravy was really good. He wasn't blown away by the greens however.More than anything, they have a really nice selection of food. From collared greens to french toast with bananas to bbq pulled pork sandwiches. Lots of traditional down home cookin- quite good! Tons of sides to pick from- in fact you can make sides your whole meal! And try the cake! I got a big slice of yellow cake with yummy chocolate frosting! SO good!"
I was brought here by a fellow yelper.  I love the fact that the jukebox was free but they specifically said NO KIDS :-)  I love the southern food selection.  I ordered the big burger but keep in mind that they also serve a really big burger. Yummy is the best way to describe Feed.  YUMMMYY to my TUMMMYY
"yum yum yum yum- my favorite type of restaurant.  Zero pretention, great atmosphere and amazing, southern-style food.  Delicious every time- the biscuits are perfect, the fried green tomato benedict is always a crowd-pleaser, and the staff is always friendly and attentive- your coffee cup is never empty.  This is a good place to go with a few friends if you all have some cash and are hungry for a quality brunch.  I've never tried their lunch but man, it looks great too."
"FEED me!and they did! I got the quarter chicken with a side of fried okra and the collared greens. I'm picky about my chicken. I hate that slimy banquet style fried chicken and I can't stomach it if it's too dry. Feed did a pretty good job of hitting it just right. I usually peel the skin off and just go for the meat, but the fried part looked home-cookin' to me. Not that thick breaded stuff like KFC but still enough for some crunch. The fried okra rocked my socks back on. I got a grapefruit soda which was really light and refreshing...not as fake sugary as I was expecting. If you get that and like the soda, tell em! The girl at the counter told me the big boss was thinking about not ordering it anymore.Only thing I didn't like was the collared greens. They were WAY peppery. I hate pepper. Gross. I like em more on the vinegary side. Anywho, good place. Very cute farm themed decor. A full belly for around $8. Can't complain!I gotta go back and get the gravy and biscuits to see if they can even hold a candle to mom's.What are you...chicken? Try it out for yourself! baaaawk bawk bawk gulp!35/52"
"Went here with a few friends the other night. It was a return visit for me, though I don't remember a ton about my initial visit apart from just enjoying it. I had a burger with blue cheese, as I wasn't much in a chicken mood. It was massive and tasty, and the bun was toasted to perfection. I also enjoyed the yummy lemonaide/iced tea mixture. The place is cute, the music maybe a little loud for comfortable conversation. I liked the communal dining feel of the long bench seating on the side of the room. One major drawback, they do not accept credit cards. I so rarely carry cash, and though they have an ATM right there in the restaurant, it is a bit inconvenient in this day and age. I would like to check it for brunch; it's a pretty cute place!"
"We originally went to the Flying Saucer for brunch and quickly realized that we are not vegan kind of eaters.  Fortunately, our handy dandy Yelp application came to the rescue.  At first we were skeptical solely based on the appearance of the building.  The first thing that catches one's eye is the big black cock sign.  Once you enter the place, it's a world of chickens and roosters and one sole picture of the Virgin Mary of Guadalupe.We ordered the Pumpkin French Toast, the Buckeye and the Eggs Benedict with Fried Green Tomatoes.  The pumpkin French toast was not too pumpkiny or cinnamonny....it was just perfect with syrup.  The Buckeye was okay.  The butter loaded bread is what made this dish.  The sausage has a nice spice to it.  My favorite dish was the Eggs Benedict with the fried green tomatoes and ham.  They are, by far, the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had.  The combination of cornbread, ham, eggs and fried green tomatoes was out of this world delicious.  The corn pudding was also good.Good southern comfort food."
Went here recently based on all of the positive yelp reviews.  Ordered fried chicken with two sides. Very disappointing. The chicken was rather bland. The collard greens on the other hand were very salty. The mac and cheese was just OK. There are better places in Chicago for fried chicken.
"Feed, Feed, Feed...where have you been all my life? I have always lived in the Midwest so I can't really say if this is proper Southern comfort food -but it sure keeps my belly happy so I have to give it a thumbs up! I've been to this fabulous joint about two times now with friends and have to say that it's pretty fantastic.  The sides are really good - the ones I recommend and have tried are the:  Brussel sprouts, fried okra, fried green tomatos, corn bread pudding,  and roasted parsnips.  The Mac and Cheese and the Collard green's aren't my favorite.Their chicken is succulent.  If you don't go early, they may even be out of chicken!  My friend had their pulled pork and loved it - so I gues that would come recommended as well.  The day we got the red velvet cake - it was a bit less fluffy than it is normally but the guy at the counter threw in a slice for free when I got a slide of the apple pie.   DELICIOUS.  Despite scarfing down a quarter chicken and two sides, the three of us ate two desserts as well.We also tried fried mash potato balls that one of the chefs came up with - it was crispy on the outside, not at all greasy, and filled with pieces of bacon and 3 types of cheese...not on the menu but when they're experimenting - you should try it!The service is always with a smile and it's just a great low key place to hang out.  I know i'll be back again for sure!"
"Feed is comfort food at its very best. My roommate and I cruise over to Feed on our bikes when we're craving some good ol' home cookin'. We like to think the bike ride makes the whole excursion more healthy, but...yeah, the fried okra kind of cancels out the bike ride.Speaking of fried okra. OH-EM-GEE this stuff is ridiculous. Served with ranch dressing- I don't think it can get any better than this! The collard greens are quite delicious too.The chicken is served with two sides, as well as tortillas and a little cup of salsa so you can make your own  ""kind-of taco"" as I call them.I'm also a big fan of Feed's expansive hot sauce collection. My mission is to alternate hot sauces with each bite of my kind-of taco. The atmosphere at Feed may not be for everyone, but I'm amused by the no-frills, diner style and old-school chicken decorations everywhere. My kind of place."
"Great inexpensive restaurant, my bf and I are regulars most weekends, more often in the summer when the back patio is open and there is no wait time! That being said if you come on a Sunday during the winter be prepared to wait about 20-30 min. The fruit pancakes are always a favorite, the fruit actually tastes like fruit and not some awful sugary mess pretending to be fruit. Very filling so we generally split one (about $3) and then each get our own egg/potatoes and toast combo's ($.4.75, add $2 if you want bacon or sausage).The Big Ass Breakfast Burritos are also amazing! But split it because you will never ever finish it by yourself. They are also really good about subsitutions, I don't eat meat and they are always willing to change up whatever I ask them to.Last but not least we always get a banana pudding to go! YUM!"
"FEED.  And that is exactly how I use this restaurant - to FEED my family when they are in town.  The chicken, mac 'n cheese, excellent mashers all add up to a satisfying gathering! Y-U-M. Only knock on this great in-the-know-find is that they pack up the take-out portions in a whole lotta styrofoam. It does impact my desire to order out from here as feeding a lot of people = throwing away a lot of styro.  Not good for the ju-ju."
"Usually only go here for breakfast but they serve lunch, dinner and brunch. Relaxing atmosphere with no thrills except for the farm and rooster theme going on. Friendly and hard working staff go out of their way to make you feel at home. Foods great and not expensive. If the place gets packed and you're a party of 1, 2 or 3 there are some larger tables where you may be sitting right next to strangers.Oh and get the side of ham when getting a breakfast. Their ham is thee best."
"I normally would never say this, but Feed has the best breakfast around.  I usually get the two eggs with potatoes and sausage, it is heaven.  The sausage is the key, I don't know what kind it is, but it is good.The prices are wonderfully low and the service has been nothing, but excellent.  The best time to go is for brunch on the weekends."
"I really wanted to like this place.  It reminds me of my favorite down home places I use to frequent while living in SF.   But unfortunately the food just did not live up to the hype.  It's sad when the side of fries was the best part of  the meal. The mac & cheese was dry and bland.  The barbecue sauce was way too sweet.  The burger was over cooked. Not one of the three dishes (pulled pork, fried catfish, burger) we ordered and therefore sadly we will not be making a second trip back.  I don't think we'll be missing much.-the second star is for the nice lady behind the counter"
"Love this place for Sunday brunch.  Walking distance from the Ukrainian Village and amazing food.  They have weekly specials that are always creative and very tasty.  I've recently add the Scottish Eggs, Chorizo & Egg Toastada, Pumpkin French Toast & Biscuits & Gravy. The staff is super friendly,  the prices are good, and they have an awesome outdoor patio."
"This would have been five stars, but for a place that's got such punk rock waitresses I would have expected a few more vegetarian options. I heard way too many complaints from my stick-in-the-mud dining partner (who doesn't like eggs and doesn't eat meat) to be allowed to return, which is a shame as I really enjoyed my meal.I had the green tomato eggs benedict, which was a reasonably portioned rich plate and glorious, and he had the caramelized banana french toast which was generous and very sweet. I also had a fine slice of blackberry pie and a coffee, and the check came to like $22. Nice.ALSO! The meal of five sides is an ungodly amount of food for $8. Fried okra, mmmm."
"First Place I ate as a chicagoan. Fantastic Little round the corner place. Infact so perfect / fantastic this is the go to for brunch with visiting friends and family. Never disappointed. It is as if my granny is in thier kitchen turning out the most spectacular old timey food in massive portions urging you to eat it all. Clean Plate Club kids. Seriously it as if the Kitchen staff has been making these dishes for something like 75 years. The most perfect over easy eggs I have ever seen came from that kitchen. So perfect in fact they appeared to be totally fake.  I was assured they were the deal and indeed perfect,. Now If only I could win a golden egg from the chicken vending machine a la my youth."
"I love this place.  Went back today and got the fried green tomatoes egg benedict again..because it was so delicious the last time, and again this time.  My friend again made her own omelet, and she again was not disappointed.  Not that there is anything spectacular about a make your own omelet, but it was nice and fluffy and very inexpensive.  Last time we shared an order of biscuits and gravy - which i wasn't crazy about.  This time we shared a blueberry pancake, which was more of a buttermilke pancake smothered with blueberry topping.  Nothing too exciting.  They did have Chorizo chilaquiles as a special which i'm sure would be amazing, but i dont really like chorizo.Overall - super cute little place, haven't head to wait, but i'm sure it could get crowded since it's small.  New favorite brunch place.  I've yet to tried their lunch options."
"Feed...you stepped yo game up with the Lousiana Scramble. My bro, daughter and I popped in for brunch yesterday and when my bro saw that the LS was the special, he said I HAD to have it. Boy am I glad I did. Juicy chunks of marinated chicken, andouille sausage, catfish bacon bits and scrambled eggs had me in another world . The grits were a perfect, creamy and thick consistency and the biscuits were to-die-for. LOVED IT!!!"
"I love their breakfast potatoes with  a passion.  I've had some misses at Feed including a banana fosters pancake which had a sauce that tastes like pure tar, dry blueberry pancakes, and a very dry red velvet pancake as well.  All is forgiven though as their biscuits in sausage gravy are the best breakfast food i think i've ever tried.  I can't say how incredible it is to have a low cost and ultra fresh/tastey breakfast joint like this- if only there were 20 more like it around the city."
"This is a nice little diner to go to when you need some good home cookin'. I really like the feel of this place. The lighting isn't too bright and everyone is super relaxed. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, corn pudding and french fries. Everything was delcious, especially the corn pudding! I love that stuff! My only complaint is that their plates are a little too small. It was really hard to eat my food and keep it all on the plate, let alone find a place to put the ketchup!"
"Excellent rotisserie chicken-moist and delicious! Had fantastic mashed potatoes. I'd skip the cornbread. Maybe it was because it was later at night, but it was quite dry. But other than that-chill, easy, and yummy."
"I went here for breakfast a few days ago, and I was extremely impressed with the quality (and portions) of what I got.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of ham.  The biscuits and gravy came with 2 eggs, and I figured the ham would be a small sliver of the stuff, but I wound up with two enormous plates of food.The biscuits and gravy were very unique, as I think the gravy had sour cream or cream cheese in it to give it a light tangy taste, and the biscuits were somewhat crisp on the outside, yet flaky and soft on the inside.  I will definitely get this again.The side of ham came with two grilled ham steaks!  I only wanted a taste of ham alongside my eggs, but they gave me a whole meal on top of my already giant meal.  The ham was thick-cut, which I wasn't expected, but it was still delicious.  A very easy five stars!"
"Best of the neighborhood. If you live in West UK Village or South Humboldt and you like southern comfort food, this is for you. The kitschy chicken theme is either cute, trendy, or weird, I can't decide. I love the easy going feel of the place, though. It can be a super cheap meal if you just order a sandwhich or chicken, but it can add up if you want their sweet tea, amazing sides, and desserts. I found out that although their fried okra is perfectly done, I don't really like fried okra. I loved the pulled pork sandwhich, my husband loves the chicken. Best thing there is the corn stuff... yum."
"Five stars? Oh yes, I did. And if you eat there soon, I'm willing to bet you'd wahoo too. So long as you know what you're walking into. And here's what you're walking into: A lovely, eclectic, counter-ordering, cash-only comfort food slice of heaven; a heaven that serves roasted chicken (mostly) with a plethora of southern cooking sides. Checkered table cloths, serve-yourself water, and chalk boards! It's BYOB - the final touch to a perfectly affordable, tasty evening. And if you are tempted to go, go soon! They have Brussel sprouts as a special side -- and mamacita, that was amazing."
"Minor & mute points are; the coffee wasn't very hot & you have to hold the bathroom door wide open to try to find the light switch. Clue; the light switch is on the left wall just before the sink when you walk in. Don't light a lighter because it's against fire code!I ate a broccoli & cheese omelette with a bacon side at 1 PM (Saturday.) I probably will not eat until Monday as it was so good & it was so filling. A very nice waitress served so I don't know what the ""no waiter thing"" is on lots of the reviews unless it's the time I was there. It's a very comfortable & pretty room. I live pretty far away but if I am close to Feed I will eat there again. I love breakfast for breakfast, lunch, or dinner."
"I had heard about this place many times before actually ordering for myself.I have only ordered take-out, but every experience has been top-notch.""Stick with what you like.""  My friends and I have only every ordered the Spinach Salad with Chicken, and it's AMAZING!Salad contains: large fresh spinach leaves, blue cheese, cranberries, walnuts and their original dressing (mustardy vinaigrette -delicious-).  Made to order, with or without Chicken.  The chicken is cut fresh from the bone, and cooked to perfection, always moist and delicious.Salad is best when brought home, and tossed in a skillet for a few minutes on the stove.  TRY IT!Portion sizes are large, price is right......  ALL experiences with staff have been great.  Everyone is very friendly and kind.The place is cozy with plenty of space to sit down.  I look forward to dining in one day.  Kind of off the beaten path, so not much foot traffic.CASH ONLY!!  ATM inside.This place is perfect for some good ole fashioned wholesome food at a good price."
"This place rocks. My only regret was that I was NOT hungover when I went to brunch here, because the Shrimp cakes that I had would have been the most suburb remedy ever for my non-existent hangover. I got the shrimp cakes with spinach and potatoes (subbed for grits) and was very pleased with the whole experience. A tad disappointed the spinach wasn't hot/cooked, but not enough in this case to warrant any reduction in points. Co-eater got the sweet potatoe hash topped with scrambled eggs, and he seemed pretty happy as well. Next time will definitely bring some beverage supplies and make a full morning of it. Service was fantastic, friendly and fast. Side note, I left a chapstick on the table, and the server literally chased me down Chicago avenue to return it to me! Now, that's service!"
"FEED ME!I thought I wasn't that big of a ""southern food"" girl but I guess I was wrong! Ever since my visit last week I cannot stop day dreaming about mac 'n' cheese, cornbread dressing and pulled pork.  If you don't ""do"" pork they have rotisserie chicken served with house made salsa and breaded catfish sandwiches.  If you are a fan of the southern sides you can order five as a meal- if you can narrow it down to five!  Remember Louisiana hot sauce makes everything you order taste even better!PS- no one spent over $10 and we all left stuffed!"
"i just had a very tasty, cheap, and satisfying lunch at feed. a full plate of 3 sides for less than $6 + choices of corn pudding, beet salad, fried okra, spinach, and succotash? sounds good to me. they were out of the beet salad when i showed up, which was sad. my mood was immediately lifted when i took a bite of the spinach. the spinach was fresh in that special way, that way tastes pristine alongside the simplest of ingredients. it was warm, but crisp, not wilted, probably tossed in some garlic and olive oil hot from the pan. the garlic cloves were also freshly chopped. the corn pudding was some of the best i've had. i washed it all down with a glass of creamy delicious thai iced coffee.i will definitely be back for dinner, breakfast, and future lunches."
"ok, i don't know what they put in the food because there was a freakin LONG and SLOW line. we went for brunch and didn't think it would take almost two hours to get seated. the patrons are nice and interesting which is prob why we didn't notice all the time we spent in line waiting but once we sat down the food was not all that. we were there for brunch. it's tiny, too."
Southern Yum.You had me at the oilcloth table coverings.  The banana pudding is the true star.  But the side salads are delish too.  Corn pudding and beets please.The okra disappointed --the batter was too much.  I prefer my okra with a light cornmeal dusting.  And the mac and cheese was so/so.I'll come back--but am in no rush.
"I think I really dig this place. I came back for brunch and not only did they have delicious southern foods for breakfast, but they thought it was awesome that I brought a bottle of champagne and encouraged me and my guyfriend to stay and finish it. (Twist my arm.)I had some pulled pork hash with poached eggs. It was delicious, sprinkled with sweet potatoes, and it was at least 3-breakfasts worth of food. I took home like 4 pounds of pulled pork hash and it only cost like $7 or something. They refilled our OJ for free and let us hang out on the patio on a beautiful later summer day for a few hours.My only beef with it was the potatoes were waaaay too salty, both in my hash and accompanying my friend's omelet. But I still think its a great, charming find in the neighborhood. Service is good, even though apparently the girl next to us ordered the last of the fried green tomatoes Benedict. Dang!I heart Feed. I want to steal all their wall signs."
"i Heart Feed! The chicken is ALWAYS bomb. Brunch is always yummy (pulled pork hash!). It's literally half a mile from my house, and it's got a cozy back patio! Having a private patio always bolsters my love for an establishment. Also, BYO!"
"Delicious brunch and lunch! I highly recommend the pulled pork hash, you will bust your gut if you try to eat it all! You also can't beat the price. Great food, no pretense, and that back patio is awesome on a Sunday morning."
"I've only ever been here for breakfast, but I think the food is delicious and good for a soul in need of some ""down home"" lovin'. I always get the fried green tomato benedict and it never disappoints. Brought some of the family there yesterday and they were all big fans. There was much talk of which other of our family members would enjoy the quirky decor and huge, scrumptious meals and all agreed that this place was special.On Easter they had this amazing crab meat, ancho chili hollandaise benedict masterpiece-it's the stuff of dreams. Maybe if I'm lucky they'll have it again on Easter 2011. Crystal? Are you listening?It's cash only but they do have an ATM on site. Lots of easy parking and, if you go late enough, you can waddle over to the Continental after dinner."
"YUM!!!!  Cute, kitschy place with cheap, delicious brunch!  I had biscuits and gravy and house potatoes, my friends has sweet potato hash and chicken fried steak - none of us were disappointed!  Bonus points for having diet dr. pepper and free jukebox!!"
"I love Feed.   I've been going there since 2005 and it is by far one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago ...  because it is:  super cheap, delicious, and has character.  The reason I originally went is because I googled ""corn pudding chicago"" and FEED was the top hit, recently I had moved back to Chicago from The South... I'm a big fan of the side dish.   However Feed's is a hit and miss... sometimes it is overcooked and dry... however all the other sides are delicious.  Its super cheap because my girlfriend and I can go there, get two complete meals and a couple sweet teas for under $20.   I particulary like the catfish sandwich.... the fries are awesome but the sweet potato fries are probably the best I've ever had anywhere. The dining room is small and decorated with portraits of chickens.  Cool to me.  I am not living in the damned restaurant people... what do I care if there are chickens on the wall. Its different and that is good.  It feels like going into a tiny hole in the wall shack in the south and sitting down in a laid back place to eat some good food for a cheap price.   Its a great place to take a date as well because if she/he doesn't like it.. then you know they are total stuck up douche with$*#* for taste and not worth your time. Summertime they have outdoor seating, brunch is good as well.   Dinner always has counter service so you just pick up your food when called at the counter.   This can help you save a few bucks by just tipping the cook/cashier a couple bucks rather than tipping more for full service... which eating cheaply helps keep it down....   brunch they have servers... but they are good and friendly.   I must say, most of the food is not ""mind blowing' but it is for the most part PRETTY DAMN GOOD FOOD.I LOVE: catfish sandwich, collard greens, sweet potato fries, sweet tea, succotash, spinach, beets, bean of the month, chicken, bbq sandwich, fries...I didn't like: mac n' cheese - dry , corn pudding - dry"
"Really great place. Good food. Super nice staff. Nostalgic/family type place if that makes any sense.  I only give four stars because it comes off as a little dirty on the inside. I know they are going for a certain look but there has to be a line between aesthetic and practicality. Overall though, highly recommended."
"I have three basic criteria I judge a restaurant by:1. The quality of the food2. The helpfulness of the staff3. The number of chicken pictures hanging on the wallOne out of three ain't bad?We went there for brunch, and I asked our server to help me decide between three dishes, one of which was a special called ""Welch Buck Rabbit"".  I told her that I was leaning toward one of the other dishes, but rabbit sounded so interesting.  She recommended I go with the special, which I did.Once I had ordered, I was BURNING with curiosity.  How would it be served?  Would it be spit-roasted and laid out on the plate like a chicken?  Would it be chopped up and prepared in some sort of rabbit stew, then served sloshed over the eggs and toast?  Would it be sliced in tiny, rabbit-sized slices and laid out  like a turkey dinner?Well, the dish finally arrived, and as it turns out, there was no rabbit.  It was just a couple of eggs with toast, slathered in cheese sauce, plus a side salad.  You simply can't imagine my disappointment.Welch Buck Rabbit was just the name of the dish.  The other (and much more helpful) server explained it to me.  Something about poor Welch people giving their dishes names that reflected ingredients they couldn't afford.  I don't remember the details--I think they used it as a means of taking advantage of unsuspecting tourists.  Seems pretty effective, actually.So I guess expecting them to have a group of fresh bunnies (or ""kindle"") stowed away in back, just waiting to be slaughtered, spitted, roasted and served to greedy, selfish yuppies like myself was probably a bit of wishful thinking.  But someday I will find such a place.  Oh yes.  Someday."
"The five stars are for the chicken, the burgers, the breakfasts, the service, the atmosphere, and the portion sizes!  The desserts are always worth a try too.  We once had a cinnamon cake concoction that was created by our waitress - it was awesome!I agree that the sides have seemed bland and dry lately, which is a bummer for me since I'm a big fan of the ""meal of 5 sides.""  The last time we went in they said that they just took mac & cheese off of the menu for good - which was devastating to hear. I never *loved* their mac & cheese, but I sort of require mac & cheese in the winter and it seems just nutty that they wouldn't have it.  Oh well, I'll still go for the rest!This has been a big hit with out of town guests who want to get some ""local flavor,"" and it's very family friendly.  Fun spot!"
"Southern comfort...these are the words to use when describing Feed. This place is adorable! The decor and staff is just so warm and friendly. I was happy to try this place with a couple of lady friends. We didn't realize this place was cash only, so my friends had to go get some cash before we could order. I, as the bad friend, was too lazy to join them.As I wanted for their return, I played around with the free juke box...perfect for the soundtrack of the place and scanned the menu. If they would only add some Etta James....When ordering, I was so torn between the chicken fried steak and the shrimp and grits...however, my wallet dictated that I choose something cheaper so I'd have enough $ for a decent tip. The chicken it was!Highlights:*1/4 chicken, dark meat--rotisseried with delicious skin. Yum. How I do love dark meat...tho it can be bad for you (enter chuckle here).*Collared greens--were good with bits of pork in them, but now I know that I am not a fan of collared greens. You would have thought I would have realized sooner since I'm from the South....*Fried okra--wow, perfect. Not greasy at all, and even when I was full, I wasn't able to quit popping these little balls of deliciousness into my mouth.*Mac & cheese--pretty tasty but I was a bit sad it wasn't baked.Down Sides:*Coffee--It just isn't hot. Hot coffee in brunch places is just a requirement.*So...close...yet....so....far....I'm too lazy to try the buses in the cold. Someone give me a ride.I am anxious to come back to try more. My friend got the Fried Green Tomato Benedict...it rested on a huge piece of corn bread. It looked ahh-mazing...so I have a feeling next time I will be faced with a tough decision....what am I going to eat? Another bonus? It's BYOB! I'll for sure come back for a Saturday or Sunday Fun Day...I just need a ride there."
"Basically anytime I try to go to some trendy dinner place and find out theres more than an hour wait, I come here.There's never any wait for dinner. (Brunch? Another story!) The food is great. And I usually end up feeling like I had a way better dinner than I would have at ______ (insert trendy place where I can't get a table).I just order the half chicken to split with someone, get the two sides (fried okra and corn pudding, DUH) and there you have it. A dinner for two for about $11.Cash only, no servers at dinner, just delicious food."
"I have been going to feed since 2006! and i stilll looooooooooove it. The staff is great, the owners are wonderful, and the food is delicious.Love the five sides!"
"Finally!  Jeez, we've wanted to go check this place out for a while now and tonight was the night.  My folks came in and the four of us headed on over.  It was totally empty on an early Sunday evening, but that's fine.  Well, probably not for Feed though.Heh, love that they carved ""eat Feed"" and little chicken foot prints into the concrete sidewalk out front -- clearly these folks have a nice sense of humor.Totally cheep cheep eats and the 1/4 light chicken is mighty darn tasty.  As a matter of fact, I don't think I've have better chicken in a restaurant anywhere. Mom, who was derailed by all the tattoos, and the hubs had the fried chicken special which they both really enjoyed.  Dad had the BBQ chicken sandwich which he loved.  Think that'll be the way to go on my next visit. Everyone's right -- the sides are pretty so-so which was disappointing.  The mashed potatoes are indeed heavy on the pepper and are crumbly dry, not creamy at all.  The cole slaw looks kinda gross and unappetizing, is not mayo based but tasted eh, ok-ish.  The mac and cheese was all dried out, nothing gooey creamy about it at all.All in all, I'll go back but will probably limit my sides consumption."
We went for brunch. pancakes were classic and fried green tomato eggs benedict were delicious with an especially good hollandaise sauce. we loved the atmosphere  and definitely will come back.
"Great local hole in the wall.  Its a bit out of the way but well worth it.  I only go for brunch but have been wanting to try them for dinner for some time.  The cheesy grits are the best.  Any of the benedicts or omelets are good too.  They change the menu and specials pretty often so I like seeing whats new.  Now that its summer, the out door patio is key.  All around great experience.  Friendly staff and prompt service.  I definitely recommend this place."
"i can't believe i've waited so long to yelp this place, my bf and i went again today and it was so good i knew i had to finally do it. i LOVE feed, we don't go as often as i'd like because it's kind of farther west than we go for anything and it's cash onlymy bf loves his omelets, and i think he's tried most of the different options at this point and has said they've all been great. today i tried one of the specials, the green eggs and ham. i assumed it was going to be eggs, pesto and ham, like i've had other places, but it was a spinach cream sauce, poached eggs and a slab of ham on cornbread. almost like an eggs benedict, and it was damn good. it also came with a side of red potato home fries. my only complaint ever is that the home fries aren't as crispy as i like, i never remember to ask for them crispier until after my food comes so it's my bad. they have some awesomely good specials there, last time my parents were in town my dad had the corn cakes, which were these light, sweet corn pancakes with just a little of the corn meal grittiness and corn in them. they were delicious, i had instant brunch regret when i tried them. the first time we were there they had red velvet pancakes as one of the specials, and a lady at the table next to us ordered them and said they were fantastic. i love the pulled pork hash, that's my stand by, its full of pulled pork, carrots, onions, red potatoes, and usually all kinds of goodies left over from dinner the night before. my step-mom had the sweet potato hash, i'm not a sweet potato person, so i didn't try it, but she was a fan. the servers here are always super friendly, the service is slow paced, which i don't really mind, the inside is fun with the wall of famous chickens and i love the shaded little kitchy patio in the summer time. one time we were here our waitress had brought in some homemade strawberry jam and shared it with us. so friendly. AND i am totally taking home one of those whole chicken dinners with 3 sides for less than $16 one night this week and am pretty excited to find out how good it will be."
"I LOVE THIS PLACE!what a find! its in the middle of nowhere, but i will happily commute from logan square to get their breakfast! the sweet potato hash is to die for! and the pulled pork hash too!it is fairly cheap, considering they give you a mound of food big enough for 3 people. its the perfect mix of the corner diner and a fancy breakfast. it is officially my new go-to."
"I know it's cliche...but I REALLY want to like Feed. Comfort food is my favorite. But their food is SO incredibly inconsistent , I can't like it. That is the main problem I have with Feed...and I just can't get past it. I've had their food at least a dozen times...there once, at a party another time, but mostly carry out. The mac and cheese is different EVERY time I've had it. As others have observed before me...it's mushy and lacking flavor. That is consistent. Mashed potatoes are too peppery, and have a funny flavor that I can't figure out. The pulled pork is just ok. Their burger is pretty good, but usually charred on the outside...which I don't like. I sometimes like the corn pudding, but lately it's been painfully dry...even burnt...as if it's leftovers reheated. The chicken is usually pretty good, but often not very hot...which is worrisome to me. While they're not known for desserts necessarily, I'm still a sucker for them...and every one I've had has been bad. Red Velvet cake-dry and awful. Pies, terrible. Banana Pudding, downright foul. Can't really recommend, I'm sorry to say."
VERY recommended.Eat the pie.
"Lemme start by saying, I'm born and raised in Louisiana. I ate my grandmother's fried okra, squash casserole, cheese grits, fried chicken, biscuits, pancakes and mac and cheese at least once a week for 18 years. Point is, I'm qualified to review Feed.That being said...FEED IS THA BOMB! I've had my fair share of chicken fried steaks in my day and Feed's ranks near the top, which is saying a lot considering my roots. This ain't no truck stop slop.The home cooking style portions are generous without being overwhelming, the food is fresh and expertly prepared, the prices are reasonable, they know how to lightly fry a piece of catfish and the chicken picture covered walls all add up to some serious charm. The service is 95% great 95% of the time; they are friendly and chatty and saucy and interesting. The place is usually bustling on a Saturday or Sunday mid-morning, but the crowd always seems relaxed and sort of in-it-together.Pumpkin french toast, fried green tomato eggs benedict, vegetable hash and a Chicken machine that lays golden eggs, plus a free juke box. The mac and cheese ain't nuthing to squawk about, hence the four stars."
Breakfast was terrible today. My gravy on my Biscuits and Gravy was cold.
"Love Feed. Need to go there more often.The servers are soooo nice. Great atmosphere.The chicken is some of the best anywhere. The pulled pork is amazing. Breakfast/brunch is always good. This is the first and only place I've eaten grits, but if other grits are like this, then I love grits."
"When my loved ones took us to this place for breakfast/lunch, I thought it was a dive bar based on outer appearances.  A real hole-in-the-wall, in fact.  I ordered fried catfish, a Ceasar salad, and sides of mac&cheese and collard greens.  My loved ones were pleased with their meals as well.  Delish!  Our order was quick to arrive and service was nice and friendly.  I'd certainly return in spite of outward appearance."
"First, I'm a southerner by virtue of my father's side of the family and lived in the middle south for 12 years.Second, the fries are just fries. the cole slaw is below average, not southern style, the pulled pork is good, not excellent, the beets are good, not southern style,  the corn pudding is good, but it's east coast amish - southerners don't eat puddings made from vegetables!  my gran was Mennonite so i know about meat and veggie puddings.Third, it is cheap with easy parking.Finally, when we left we smelled like a McDs all the way home."
"They always have awesome desserts...frequently pie!You can order a dish called 5 sides...where you just get 5 side orders not an entree.  I love that...they usually have collard greens, mac & cheese, brussels sprouts, cheesy grits and lots of other good things.Decor is funky and fun...and they collect donations for the Red Door Animal Shelter which is very cool"
"I knew I had made a mistake the second I bit into the pulled pork sandwich.  Why did I ever offer to split this with my friend?  It's amazing-- full of heat and vinegar, but with neither flavor overpowering.  And it was so tender, it must have been marinated and cooked for hours.  I seriously considered spitting on the other half of the sandwich, just to keep it for myself.  But, if I had I wouldn't have gotten to try her side of corn pudding , which was simply heavenly-- the texture was light and the outsides were a little browned.  Just perfect.  The one improvement they could make is that all the sides were served in styrofoam, which seems a little wasteful considering we didn't get takeout."
"Awesome!!! Brunch and Dinner never fails to delivery enjoyment to the taste buds. This hole in the wall southern style joint is not in it for the ambiance, but for the pure satisfaction of pleasing the taste buds and ensuring you come back for more. Will keep coming back and will keep recommending. Don't ever change."
"For Feed's 137th review, I just want to say that I love the outdoor seating area - makes you feel like your tucked away, very comfy.There were five of us and I think we sat there for a couple hours (it wasn't busy) and our waitress was so pleasant and accomodating.And of course the food is friggin delicious and I can't wait to go back and really tackle that menu (pulled pork sammich was a good place to start)."
"Well shut my mouth and slap me silly!  That was the response I wanted from the bar-be-que at feed.  Instead, all I said was, ""hey, this is good.""  Really, the ranting and raving about the fine southern cooking by my neighbor had me so excited that the food was a bit of a let down.  It was oversold.  So what if I am from the south and a very tough critic.  On a positive note:  will I be back?  Probably.  It's more than acceptable.  But if you are from the land of grits and cornbread, be warned.  It's good, but it's not your mama's cooking.BTW, bring cash."
"I've tried Feed a couple of times, and always had a decent meal. The BBQ chicken sandwich is good, mac and cheese is not as good as you'd expect, and the collerd greans are YUM. I was never blown away by it, but something about this place appeals to me (perhaps the nice people or the eclectic atmosphere), so I've persevered.  And last weekend, I was rewarded for my efforts. I had the great fortune to finally order....wait for it....the pulled pork sandwich. It pretty much rocked my world. Crazy good. Now that I know what to order, I'll be back much more frequently.Oh, and diner (or diner's dinner companion) beware...the cheese grits should really be called garlic grits. They're really good. I'm just sayin'...you may end up sleeping alone."
"I strongly disliked eating here, and haven't had anything good or memorable here.  I've been here two or three times for lunch with someone who likes the place, so I gave it another chance.  I have tried the side dishes and the selection was limited, some were ok, some were bad.  The lemonade was a BAD lemonade mix, and there was no iced tea.  They give you a glass of ice and you pour your own drink from a plastic pitcher that sits on a table for everyone.  The pictures on the wall are not just cute, they are unappetizing, all of chickens.  Must we be reminded of exactly what the bird looked like before it was killed and de-feathered?  Sorry, it looks ""funky"" but not in a good way.  The whole places looks too kitchy.  It's dumpy and in need of updating, I think they're going for a run-down country barn look.I really don't know what people like about this place.  The food was just not good here.  I think it's just that people in Chicago like to think they're eating Southern food."
"Great brunch. A bit pricey, but the food is overall pretty solid."
"I love their chicken! The chicken is what I really go there for. I often find myself craving their chicken at the most random times. The sides are okay, some are better than the others but my favorite is the potato salad. Yet another item I find myself craving. I havent had the chance to partake in the brunch or breakfast but the menu sounds fantastic. The prices for everything is so reasonable and you gotta love the BYOB!"
"Feed is the kind of restaurant that I've been to and thoroughly enjoyed, yet haven't found my way back there since.  That was a couple of years ago, mind you.The chicken was great and, as a Southerner, I really like the sides.  However, I live in Logan Square and am just as happy getting rotisserie chicken from South American restaurants.  It's all the same, really.In short, if you're in the area, check out the food at Feed.  If not, chances are there are other options around you that will have equally delicious chicken."
"Love it. Simple, fresh and tasty. Great variety of sides. Chicken is always done well. Burgers are amongst the best I've tasted. Desserts are always divine."
"My human loves this place. On rare occasions she brings home some left overs of their delicious chicken for me. I hear her tell friends how fantastic the hanger steak with bleu cheese butter is. My human's friend, who crocheted me toys, lives for Feed's catfish sandwich. That's all she ever orders, so it must be good!Sweet potato fries, fried green tomatoes, and corn pudding...oh my! My human REALLY likes mac and cheese, if fact I believe she fashions herself to be a connoisseur. Feed's mac and cheese is okay, and that is the worst thing she has to say about the joint. You can order your food to go and eat a swell meal in the comfort of your own home, or dine in their cozy, chicken clad, awesome jukebox playing living room that is Feed. Oh and when it's nice out they have a lovely patio that seems to accommodate larger quadrupeds."
"This place is so full of win. The one thing I can't get my mind around is that the very first time I went, the pulled pork sandwich I had was really spicy, like eastern NC style. I haven't gotten that since. The spinach is really good and edges out the collards. Fries are good, too!Thumbs down for cash only but whatever."
"I've chosen Feed for brunch on multiple occasions. So, yay! I'm a fan.My tastes only really bring me here for brunch. Southern-style dinner isn't something that makes me start drooling, so I likely won't be visiting again for dinner. Either way, the rooster-themed atmosphere and tin roof motif set the mood quite well.Back on brunch though! My chilaquiles, a daily special, were far spicier than I expected and this was to my delight. While I was enjoying my course, I found my head spinning every time that my server brought out another dish. I will be back to try more of the menu items, so long as the specials don't keep distracting me."
"Be honest with yourself, everyone: the food here is not so great. It's OK, you can admit it. I like Feed too--I like going, I like the atmosphere, the cheerful decor, the counter guy who has the same voice as Emo Phillips, the cheap prices, and  Wanda Jackson on the free vintage jukebox. But I can admit it and you should too: the food (especially the fried catfish) is pretty bland and some of it is straight-up cafeteria gross (floury, taste-free, congealed mac-n-cheese, I'm looking at you).I go because the place is pleasant, the food is reasonably priced, and it gives me that  druggy, sated, ""I just took in 60 grams of fat and now I'm going to lay around like a fat little turd for two hours"" feel. Delicious cuisine it ain't. But I don't really care if I can happily get an egg out of the clucking hen bubble gum machine and eat off a plastic tablecloth."
"Southern brunch?! I am in love. No line and the southern-style eggs benedict (cornbread, fried green tomato, ham hock, with poached eggs and a side of grits) hit the spot and cured my hangover.I MUSt go back back to try all the fabulous sides I saw on the chalkboard: fried okra, mac n cheese...drool..."
"Their breakfast is good, but their chicken dinner is better.  I love the quarter chicken dinner with any of their sides.  The succotash is great, beets, collard greens, again all sides are delish.  The have one of my absolute favorite desserts here, and that is the banana pudding.  OMG I wish I had one right now to go with my morning coffee.  Yum."
"Ohhhhhh Feed.  Why are you not located around the corner from my apartment?Let's talk chicken.  I always get the whole chicken with two sides (succotash and corn pudding.  Maybe some greens if I'm feeling extravagant), so that I've got food for a couple days and can whip up some chicken stock when it's all gone.  It's incredibly moist and succulent, and I like that they give you some tortillas and salsa for tacos (flour tortillas, though? C'maaaaaaaahhhhhn).Then there's the dessert.  In addition to the chicken and sides, you are missing out if you don't get the banana pudding.  It's light, it's fluffy, and it's got nilla wafers studded throughout.  It tastes as good as any pudding my grandma made.Chickens everywhere makes the decor homey.  I also like that they have old TNT running off video on the tv in the corner; even more nostalgia on top of that.One of my favorite memories is buying some Feed to go with a friend, and eating it on my rooftop (with plenty of beer) on a warm foggy night.  She was so impressed, she bought a shirt to take with her back to LA.But it loses a star for not taking credit cards, for using flour tortillas (I mean, REALLY), and for being two miles away from me."
"My colleagues and I ate lunch at this place today and oh boy, did we all have the ""itis""...can I say that?....I indulged in the sides platter, 5 sides for 7.29 I think... salad, spinach, okra, fries and rice... very soulful and full of flavor... others were raving about the catfish sandwich and smothered chicken which were just under $10...but the portions are ridiculous and you will definitely have enough to take home if you dine in... the atmosphere is laid back, you order your food, wait for your number to be called and have a seat...its just that simple... please bring CASH as they dont accept the card but there is an ATM of course available for a small fee.  In addition, be prepared to bus your own table! Oh, one more thing, you can't miss the place because there is a big black cock on the sign outside...look for it : )"
"I've been twice now for dinner. It's basically heaven on earth for us southern transplants to Chicago. The prices are great considering the epic proportions they serve up. It's too bad we somehow leave without any food leftover...Anyway, it would be 5 stars if I could handle a little sass... but I can only dish it out. Plus- I was promised coffee refills! I thought this was America!"
Bomb ass food on the cheap. I don't write long reviews in Chicago because what can I say that 330 people havent already said? Go.
"Well, I fed at Feed... and it was amazing!!Simply not possible to try all the deliciousness available in one trip... so I will be back soon-ish... after I come out of my food coma. I suggest a mini-fast before heading in!"
"Did I treat myself to a double brunch after discovering Feed? You bet I did. I totally fed my face both Saturday and Sunday and enjoyed every minute of it.Feed is my new favorite brunch joint thanks to the fried green tomato benedict. Granted, the red flannel hash I tried on my first visit was delish-- Who would have thought eggs, potatoes and beets could be so yummy?-- But I made the mistake of tasting the Mister's fare and I was distracted. Hence the trip back to make it mine. On the second trip we brought the neighbor to join the feast. I grabbed the benedict I had been dreaming about, the Mister opted for the shrimp and grits and Neighbor Jim took on the chorizo chilaquiles. Everything was great.I don't know how the the lunch and dinner fare tastes, but they looked good. Hmmm... does that mean the trifecta hits with dinner tonight? We'll see."
"This is my buddy's favorite brunch place so I finally gave it a shot. This place has a killer brunch menu, and the off-menu specials are quite tempting. I got the fried green tomato benedict, added cheese grits on the side, and couldn't have been happier. The place is rather small but cute (ignoring some creepy rooster pictures on the wall!). Can't wait to return."
"I am sad inside. I love Feed. I have been going for several years now and it is the best for comfort food on a lazy Saturday. However, their new breakfast is terrible. It was sooooooooooooo bad. I coulcn't believe there would be such a difference between breakfast and the rest of the day. My friend and I had cheese grits. They tasted like box ,watery cream of wheat with no flavor at all. It was runny and gross. I had the green tomato eggs benedict. It's really not a good combo. You have the creamy hollaindais, a nice corn cake (the only tasty part) and eggs. That's it. There was nothing really holding those flavors together. My friend got the chicken fried steak and it was only ok. Not normally as good as Feed food should be with some eggs. It made me sad. So Feed gets a FOUR for lunch and dinner and ONE for breakfast."
"This place makes me happy for so many reasons (I second most everything in the positive reviews here), but I'd like to this opportunity to dedicate a few sentences to the highlight of my visits:  Banana Pudding.There's no better way to end a gut-busting Feed meal than with some ridiculously rich dessert.  That's how I roll.  They do this pudding up right by swirling in chunks of actual banana (proving this is the real deal and not some weird artificial banana junk) and Nilla wafer pieces.  The beautiful creation is topped off with a thick layer of real whipped cream.  All I need is a few bites before I drift blissfully off into a food coma.      Try it."
"Eat here its good!  Thats all I really need to write about this place.  Good BBQ and Roast/Grilled chicken.  The brunch is suprisingly good too.  Sides are delicious.  The interior is fun and the outside patio is a nice spot when there is good weather.  Parking is good too since the street is not too overdeveloped yet.  Go, eat, support non-chains."
"This unassuming little restaurant packs a wallop in taste and charm but leaves your wallet rather unscathed. Another great suggestion from my hairstylist (thanks, Alex!), I stopped at FEED for dinner on my way home from a Saturday at work. The counter staff welcomed me so warmly I felt sure he was mistaking me for someone he knew. I quickly felt at home, so I didn't hesitate to take FAR too long to decide what I wanted, but there was no hurry on the staff's part. I deliberated over the signature chicken dinner with sides, the sandwiches, or a 5-sides meal before deciding on a BBQ chicken sandwich, which was served with homecut fries and coleslaw. Being a sucker for cornbread, I also had to order a side of cornbread pudding. I got a glass of water and found a seat at one of the booth seats lining the walls.There was a young family sitting at the table across from me, with a one-year-old who took a liking to me... smiling, throwing banana pudding on the floor at my feet, all that. The casual atmosphere lent itself well to a friendly exchange with her parents, and I noticed other customers chatting to people seated at adjacent tables. I always like it when you can meet someone new and have a random, enjoyable conversation without feeling like you're intruding (or being intruded on). The decor and restaurant set-up make it almost seem like an old-fashioned neighborhood picnic!My huge plate of food was ready quite quickly and was probably too quickly consumed, but it was irresistible! Tender pulled chicken with just-the-right-spice BBQ sauce on a big kaiser roll, clearly homemade fries, zingy coleslaw, and delicious, warm, buttery cornbread pudding... what more could you ask for?Dessert? Well, I would've loved to try the sarsaparilla cake, sweet potato pie, or banana pudding, but I was just too full. I'll be sure to save room next time, when I think I'll go for the 5-sides meal (because it's just too hard to choose between them all)!"
"dude this place is awesome, you're an idiot not to check it out. friendly & quick service; good menu. super good food open late at night is easily worth a five star review."
Great chicken more sides to choose from than you would expect. I hAve not had anything that wasn't good and I always feel like you are sitting down to a home cooked meal when you go to feed. It is cash only so come prepared and I have heard a rumor that they have fried chicken on Sunday's (only). There is no doubt I will be back again.
"I had the day off for Veteran's day and was out running some errands and thought I'd swing by Feed for a quick lunch since I hadn't been there in awhile.Boy did I pick the wrong day to stop in.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with Fries and decided to go tubby style with some mac n'cheese as well since I hit the gym hard this morning.  Well the mac n'cheese was dry, overcooked. and not cheesy at all. The fries were so undercooked that they weren't even edible.  My pulled pork was ok, but I've had much better, even at Feed.  Hopefully this was just a one time miss, but it's definitely gonna make me think twice about going back for awhile..."
"Make sure you sit out back when the weather is nice.  They've created a really nice little area back there.  The chicken is good.  The sides are good and you have a lot to choose from.  However, the Eggs Benedict is what really makes me happy.  They have a really creative take on it.   It's fried green tomatoes over corn bread with the usual poached egg and hollandaise.  Excellent!  When all is said and done though, I can pick up a rotisserie chicken on my way home from work and make some pretty great sides on my own.  I don't have any real need to go back there for the chicken.  I do and will go back for the Eggs Benedict!"
"Feed is one of the best, casual BYOB places in the city.  It's similar to Fat Willy's Rib shack with the ""casual country"" atmosphere and vibe, but the center of the menu here is chicken.  I usually order a 1/4 dark chicken with two sides and ALWAYS pick the corn pudding (so good).  The spinach is a simple and perfectly cooked accompaniment as well. Usually you order at the counter and wait for them to call your order up, but on the weekends they also have sit down service.  I would recommend going on a weeknight, since the waitresses are not the best. Great hangover food at a good price!"
"I've had better service here than at most similar restaurants in the city. The first time I went (a year ago), there was a waitress. The most recent time we just ordered and picked up at the counter. I think most cheap food places assume that they have to be fancy to be friendly. The people at Feed definitely did not seem this way. After all, it's hard not to be inside that place and not just smile. The hideous decorations are a nice touch, everything having to do with chickens. If you're a vegetarian/vegan, this place will probably give you nightmares for weeks. If you're a fake vegetarian, like me, and eat chicken and fish, you'll love this place.And it's BYOB!"
"Indie, Ag, and Kitch reign supreme at this spot, paying homage to down home cooking like grandma used to do. Unbelievable Rotisserie Chicken, check!!! Pork BBQ, check! Fried Catfish or a Burger, check. That's about it but that's all you need...well, that and some of the best Homestyle sides chi has to offer (i reco the mashed w gravy and the utterly divine corn pudding) in short, the look and feel is minimal, kitschy but the food is maxed.comBTW, this whole ""cash only"" malarky is borderline inexcusable.  So the other day I just had to ask, why? In this day & age when debit cards act as cash to most people...""well, the owner wants to keep things simple and easy"".  Simple and easy? For who? Certainly not the customer, many of us who use debit/credit cards for convenience and safety more than anything else.  Sort it out i say, it really cost you as an owner, nothing....hell, even put a minimum on it if you have to, just make it happen.HOWever, It still gets a 4 star bc it's just toooo damn good!!"
"So is this the best fried catfish I've ever had? Probably not (that would be in Paducah KY), but it is probably the best food of this type to be had in this particular neck of the woods, and Feed enters 5 star territory based on the perks: BYOB, cheap, the Golden Egg machine, some of the friendliest (and quick) service in the city, and a shady patio that gets a nice breeze in the summer. Feed is the kinda place that whenever I don't feel like cooking I'm ALWAYS in the mood for."
"Now that I've tried brunch and dinner at this west town spot I can recommend it without reservation.  For vegetarians and soul food lovers the 5 side dishes for 7.50 is an awesome smorgasbord.  Juicy collard greens, mash potatoes with expert gravy, and perfect just crispy enough okra are stand outs.Brunch today was awesome.  Follow the big red bird sign around back and you can enjoy table service in the lovely backyard patio.  Both of my friends tried the fried green tomatoes benedict and raved about the hollandaise sauce.  Corn pudding with whole kernels of sauteed sweet corn was definitely a huge step up from stovetop.My biscuits and gravy were completely satisfying if not wow.  The gravy was perfect, but the sausage was bleh and i seriously doubt the biscuits are made fresh.  But a big portion with eggs for 5.50 is still quite a steal and would happily order it (with grits and okra on the side) again.  Our server was really nice and had me laughing.The banana pudding is ur-craveable."
"I really like Feed. Prices are great, yummy, simple food. My favorite is the sauce that comes with the chicken. It's a blend of veggies, smoked poblanos, cilantro (?) and other magic stuff. You might think this type of sauce will leave your mouth on fire, but it is very mild and delicate. Oh, it's soooo good! If they sold that in a jar I would  drink it by the cup. Kudos to the sauce maker!I like the outdoor patio, also decorated with chicken paraphanelia."
"LOVE the FEED! The pulled pork sandwich is awesome, a bit spicy for me, but I take small bites. they have different beans each time i go and I've dug them all. But the absolute best item at FEED? the banana pudding. If I could shrink myself, jump into that pudding and whipped cream- I'd be in heaven. Check out the patio in back, very cool."
"FEED yourself rotisserie chicken, homemade mac'n'cheese, collard greens,  wash it down with sweet tea, and tamp it down with from-scratch red velvet cake.then call a friend to cart you away."
"I LOVE FEED.That said, be aware that I am from Central Illinois/Northern Missouri, where the majority of restaurants look like Feed without even trying. THEY JUST DO.The breakfast is fast, good and the coffee is above par. And god damn, do I have a girl crush on the waitress we see every Saturday. She is a sweetheart.Plus, I love a jukebox. I'm a hillbilly, what can I say?"
"Went here on a Sunday for dinner. Chicken was good but super small piece! Had 1/4 Dark with mac n. cheese and mashed potatoes for sides. Chicken was the only edible thing. Mac and cheese was cold. I told the girl behind the counter and she was very nice about it. Saying that it was 'probably left over from brunch.' Um...OK...this was 6pm... ew. So she said they'd heat some more up. Got a warm plate but it tasted just as old and un-cheezy as the cold mac n. cheese so I didn't eat it. Potatoes were lumpy, tastless and luckwarm. The chicken was good but small. The bathroom was flooded and there were teeny fruit flies everywhere, especially around the tea/lemonade dispensers which I thought was kind of gross. I woke up this morning sick and running to the toilet every 5 mins. So thanks for that, Feed. Won't be going again. Ever."
"I am very keen to the decor at Feed. I took some photos of the fish in the bowl w my camera phone - he looked like a friendly guy. Feed certainly makes you feel like you're off in the country in some small town. First time there wasn't sure what they'd have on the menu and since I don't eat meat, I ended up getting 2 sides - the beets and the spinach.If you're not a meat eater I'd say don't bother however, I thought the beets were super tasty - very interesting flavor, perhaps cinnamon?? I wasn't sure, but they were very, very good! There are not a lot of places that serve beets and when they do, nothing special about them. Well these were stand out beets!!The spinach was also very good although drenched in butter, but that is kind of to be expected. If you like your spinach raw, in its natural state then this one is not for you. But for those that don't mind some butter, these are superb!!My boyfriend ordered ordered the pulled pork and seemed satisfied although commented that there are loads of other places where you can get the same thing and better tasting.I enjoyed checking Feed out, but it's really not the place for me if I want to have a meal. That said, I'd do a pick up order just so I could get some more of those beets!!"
"Let me start by saying Im from the Tennessee so I'm a little picky about southern food. .Overall I like Feed, the decor is cute, the chicken was juicy, not too pricy, and they have sweet tea!! However I was most excited about the fried okra but I was dissapointed because the batter was too thick and I couldnt really taste it and I thought the mac and cheese had an odd smokey flavor. .I will most likely return to try the other sides though and the banana pudding looked tasty I was just too full."
"Yum! Tonight was my first trip here and my boyfriend and I liked it a lot. The chicken is tender and delicious (it's rotisserie style, not fried FYI). They give you 2 small tortillas and salsa with it and I made a couple tiny chicken wraps that were tasty. I really liked the corn pudding but I'm a sucker for corn dishes. The fried okra tasted fresh and good. The only reason I took a star off was because the collard greens were kind of off. They were pretty spicy and I couldn't tell why. Didn't taste particularly collard-greeny.I was totally stuffed by the time we got done so I plan on trying one of the desserts next time I go. A root beer float for $2.50 sounds good too."
"Came in looking for the yummy southern breakfast but since it was 11:00 AM they stopped serving it so I ordered the workingman's special for $5.99 - 1/4 roasted dark meat chicken with fried okra and sweet tea.  They served the chicken with a rolled flour tortilla and a vinegary, peppery sauce which was a pleasant surprise.  The fried okra was little nuggets of crunchy goodness alongside a ranch type dipping sauce.   Also ordered the breadpudding for dessert which seemed more cakey than your typical bread pudding but was still pretty good.  My friend had the fried catfish sandwich with fries and coleslaw and the cornmeal crust was awesome and the fresh cut fries were also a winner!   Will come back for the brunch which is served on the weekends from 9-3 and heard it has more eclectic items ...Overall a hidden gem don't miss this place!!!"
"I've been craving the sides meal at Feed for months and I can't wait to go there again, hopefully some time soon.Feed has so much going for it. The ambiance and decor are both great and very inviting, the staff is friendly, and the food is outstanding. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal there, but I must admit that the meal I have just about every time is the 5 sides platter for just $7! All the sides are great, but I particularly love the corn pudding. The lemonade is also great and, with unlimited cup-fulls, could almost get me drunk."
Best chicken in Chicagoland. Cash only and byob.
"Slightly understaffed, but our waitress was as good as three so no harm. Best...Coleslaw...Ever."
"I'm a fan. Good, well seasoned food. Personality and helpfulness of staff, phenomenal. Doesn't accept cards but has an ATM."
"We end up going here from time to time. I think I actually like the place more than the food, and I do like southern comfort food. I usually get pulled pork, but the 5 sides option is probably the best deal.I'd give the room 4 stars, but the food 3.The decor is great, and I like the attitude of the place.Every now and then when someone suggests going to Feed, it just sounds like a great idea.When we first started going here the area was desolate, now it looks as though they are building all around it."
"Does Feed really need another 5 star review?  Don't know, but I can't abide giving any less.  Recently went to Feed for my boyfriend's birthday, cause it's our fave.  While we were eating, there was one table of police finishing a meal.  As we ate, I kid you not, at least four more squad cars showed up.  Some of the officers had stars on their sleeves.  When brass is chowing down a table over, you know the place has legs.  Outside, it looked like the place was being raided, there were so many cars outside.Even when it's crazy, the staff has always been sweet and helpful.  When you don't feel like regular chicken, try the barbeque sandwiches or burger.  Really great.  Also love the beet salad and corn pudding.  Banana pudding is worth the hype."
"This restaurant is set in what was going to be an up-and-coming yuppie playground-neighborhood until the economy hit the wall.  Now, it's a sort of desolate corner of Ukrainian Village/Humboldt Park.  Kind of creepy, but I've parked there multiple times for free, on the street with no problems.  Once you leave the coarse urban streetscape - voila!  You are inside a really friendly, fun space with kitschy barnyard decor, a plastic egg-laying machine, awesome country-music and blues jukebox, cute tables and the very nice people who work here and run the place..  The food is excellent, simple fare - roasted chicken, collard greens, home-made pies... and it's so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Anyone who claims that they didn't get their money's worth is a fool who must eat McDonalds' dollar menu every day.  I also love the complaints here from the haute cuisine connoisseurs of ""le mac et fromage"" - give me a break!   Everything here is home-made... I doubt very much that the mac and cheese is ""not made with real cheese"" as at least one idiot suggests, not even having bothered to ask the cook what kind of cheese they use!  ""The mac and cheese was soggy""; ""the mac and cheese was overcooked"" oh how they love their mac and cheese!  I bet if these fools went to Paris they'd order mac and cheese, and find it not to their liking.  And I'm sure that when these simpletons ""make mac and cheese at home"" (yeah, right!) they use only the finest hand-made macaroni, perfectly curled by the fingers of elves, and dipped in $25.00 a pound organic swiss and oregano cheeses, carefully baked at 349 degrees... GFYS!I mean, here at Feed you can get, for example, a half a roasted chicken, the most delicious collard greens, barbecued beans and a drink for about ten bucks!   I make chicken at home all the time and I don't think I could beat that price by much, never mind the quality.  I guess that some roast chicken connoisseurs find that this chicken is only ""average""?  What are you talking about?  Chicken is chicken; you can cook it in a number of ways.  You roast it, it comes out roasted!  And if you think that this chicken is ""average"" then please suggest a place in Chicago (not back home in Iowa) that can make a better roasted chicken at this price.  What kind of roast chicken dinner have you had that was ""magnificent"" or ""superb""?  The chicken served once a year at the State Fair or something?  So many stupid people in this world!I like vegetables, and I confess I even like spinach.  The collard greens here are fantastic, one of the tastiest, spiciest, most savory dishes I've ever laid my tongue on!  I would go back to Feed just to have a bowl of these greens.  Very, very tasty!I also had the wisdom to try the blackberry pie one fine day, just because it looked so beautiful, as if it had just come out of the oven.  It was perhaps left in the oven for a minute too long and had browned a bit too much... just like when you make pies at home - which I do.  No two pies come out the same, unless they are made in a factory, and these clearly were not made in a factory.  I usually don't like blackberry or blueberry pies offered at restaurants because they usually ARE mass-produced, and the filling is invariably some bland, flavorless dark-blue mush that seems to bear only a faint resemblance, flavor-wise to the actual fruit.Feed's blackberry pie was excellent!  Sweet, tart, tangy, flavorful... without question one of the best blackberry pies I've ever had!  I'll never forget what a pleasant surprise it was to taste that wonderful filling ensconced in that unpretentious homemade crust.  Wonderful!  I wanted to thank Aunt Bee personally.If you are a ""Wonderroast chicken"" or mac and cheese ""connoisseur"", avoid Feed at all costs, as you'll be disappointed because it isn't going to satisfy your quirky little palate, won't taste like the freshly killed chicken that the local 4-H Club serves at their annual picnic, and you are an insufferable idiot anyway and I don't want you around moaning and picking at your food when I'm trying to enjoy my dinner!  If you are a normal human being, who appreciates decent home-style cooking at a cute, humble little neighborhood restaurant that won't leave you crying when the bill comes, go to Feed, and bring the kids, because you'll all love it!"
"About blasted time I visited Feed. It was good. I liked the decor, and the service was fast and while not overly friendly, it did the job. I got the pulled BBQ pork, and my companion got the pulled chicken. VERY peppery! And very good. The fries were pretty good; hand-cut, which I always like, but the little slivers were nearly burnt, while the thicker, ""normal"" sized ones were still pretty pale and starchy. The buns for the sammiches were low-quality - they fell apart from the juicy pork and chicken - but the star of the show is what's between the bread, so that was forgivable. The corn on the cob looked divine, and the mashed sweet potatoes made my mouth water. We each got a filling dinner with tasty sweet tea and lemonade, all for just under $20. Helluva deal! I will be back. :)To expand on the cash only thing - the bar next door - The Continental - has an ATM. Handy!"
"This place has some great BBQ. All the sides are unique yet traditional and everything is served in large portions. The pulled pork is killer! Can't go wrong here. The people who work are cool and the place is cozy and colorful. If your driving by West Town or Logan Square, this is a great stop-n-go. (favorite side: The Potato Salad)"
"Feed is a hip place to grab brunch on a Saturday morning. I've been twice now - once for brunch, once for a late afternoon lunch.  I was not all that impressed with their lunch/dinner menu.  The pulled pork sandwich was dry and the meal was pretty uninspiring. The breakfast food - man, that's where it's at.  The chicken fried steak and eggs might be the best in the city.  Now, I am not a big 'chicken fried steak and eggs' guy and I have not had chicken fried steak and eggs at many places in Chicago... but wow is it wonderful at Feed.  There were like 6 of us at brunch and everyone kind of shared what they were eating... And everything was FANTASTIC!I'm willing to give Feed another shot at lunch/dinner.  I'll keep you updated... :)"
"I really, really like Feed.  I like the food, the atmosphere, the employees, the clientele.  With that said, I didn't like the sick feeling I have when I leave.  I can't blame Feed for that, though.  I can only blame my inability to stop. freaking. eating.The chicken is great, as are all the sides.  They do give you controllable portions, I just always over-over, and in turn, over-eat.... but it's worth it."
"I LOVE Feed. LOVE. IT. Where else can I defeat my craving for grilled corn on the cob, a huge pile of mashed potatoes AND banana pudding all in one place?But this isn't gonna be so much a review, as an etiquette thing.Feed is communal seating. That big table at the back? IT ISN'T ALL FOR YOU. There are 10 of you? Guess what? THAT TABLE SEATS 16. SCOOT OVER.My last trip here last week had me and my pal Molly McButter battling a roving pack of trixies for 3 seats at the end of the table. The place was packed (even the outside tables were all taken), and they about had a fit when we deigned to sit at the end of their coveted table that they had ""Reserved"". ""But the OOOWWWNNEEERRR said we could have the WHOOOLLLEEE TABLLEEEE.""Um. No. Ms. McButter saved the day when she went and talked to the super sweet (and super slammed) manager, who told her ""There are enough chairs for everyone.""All I wanted was to dig in. We did, and they did, and everyone was happy.The moral of this story? If the place is packed, you're going to probably sit elbow to elbow with people you do not know. Deal with it. It's not a bad thing."
"I was really looking forward to trying out Feed after all the promising reviews. I don't mind and in fact enjoy these 'hole-in-the-wall' type places, but was HIGHLY disappointed. We had a pulled pork sandwich and 1/2 chicken with mac and cheese and the infamous corn pudding. The sandwich was alright, the flavors were good, but for almost 8 bucks, I expected a lot more pig. As for the chicken...for some reason I was expecting fried chicken, which this is not. It's a broiled chicken. The meat was pretty moist but not much taste. The skin....come on, if you're gonna eat chicken skin you expect salty crispy fatty goodness. This bird had minimal flavor and sadly I had to forego the skin for a better investment of my calories. As for all the rave reviews of the mac and corn pudding? Come on people! The mac had NO cheese flavor. Just kinda bland and mushy. The corn pudding was so-so. Again, could have used more seasoning. SO disappointing. Definitely do not recommend. My hunt for awesome cheap eats continues."
Great service and food - but the banana cake is awesome.Go FEED!
"Feed has a simple and basic menu, unique laid back decor and a refreshing out door patio.  Our server was kinda rude but redeemed herself later on in the meal.The burger and mac and cheese were decent, solid eats. The price can not be beat.  Nothing spectacular, but nothing horrible either, Feed is a solid 3 stars. A-ok by me."
"True definition of comfort food....go to this place to feel great. This is my kinda place, fast and good. Also they got these little eggs that have prizes in them. And I really like the vibe in there its cool. I get a sense that a lot of bike enthusiasts would come here.I love the rotating specials and the fact that they make their own pies. A La Mode? Yes. I love the working man special which is INCREDIBLY reasonable, liek around $5 for a full meal of chicken and sides. I get my co workers to come here and now they consider it ""their place"" even though they live in lockport and plainfield. Whatever, I am always glad to throw this place some biz. I think my favorite dish is the biscuits and gravy, which are home made."
Great service and great food!  The waitresses were super friendly and attentive.  Brunch was delish too.  Highly recommend the pulled pork hash and the chicken fried steak with sawmill gravy.  We'll definitely be back for the chicken dinner!
"Fried green tomato benedict. I want to eat it again and again. It's too bad, because I bet I'd like other stuff there too. Alas, fried green tomato benedict. Again. And again."
I've only been twice.  I've only had the pulled pork sammich.  Yet Feed is my Favorite restaurant.Try the eating outside in back.  It is very nice.  Remember to BYOB.I have to get back there and have some chicken.  I wish they'd open a location on my block.
"Never go grocery shopping hungry, mother always said.The other night I was grocery shopping hungry. Stanley's market at North and Elston to get veggies for the week and some fruit to keep the scurvy away. It was painful to go through all of their wonderful produce while I felt like my stomach was digesting itself. Three different kinds of cauliflower! Gosh, I'm so hungry I don't think I could bare waiting to get home. The friend I was shopping with suggested Feed. Feed! Why yes, I had take out from there a few months back and took a date there...a few months back.So to Feed we went for feed! A reason I like this place is that the sign reminds me of the neon cock sign at the bar Cock in the East Village NYC. Over the summer when I dined at Feed, the porch was still open, where there was table service with a bouncy waitress and it was very festive with the cute strands of x-mess tree lights and little tin signs everywhere and rustic little tables with every seat full and people laughing and drinking and doing whatever people do while they eat. Very comfortably, in fact. The carry out experience was different. Same price much smaller portions, which is a shame. I tend to like my slaw after a day or so of maceration in 'da fridge'... It never saw the light of my ice box. Additionally, an establishment that touts free range this and organic that would not really use, if we are holding the same standards to the entire experience, Styrofoam anything. This time around was quite festive, as well, but indoor style. My friend, as it turned out, had chatted up the fellow at the counter on the train at some point and he was very friendly towards us. The full force of hunger had hit me and I was feeling very pensive. As they chit-chatted I scoured the menu and settled on the whole roasted chicken with three sides. I planned on eating the sides and the legs of the chicken, which I did and which were really quite delicious. The special cheese grits were creamy and sublime, the cooked spinach contained enough garlic to make my stomach feel very fulfilled and content and digestion hardly a chore. The collards were succulent.The rest of the chicken I had wrapped up (in Styrofoam!) to take home for making chicken and dumplings with the meat and chicken stock from the bones and whatever meat was left on them. I really enjoy that I can use nearly 100% of a meal that will last me for a good couple of days in meals and frozen stock for months for under $20.Casual, pleasurable, swell place to people watch and nibble -- summer and wintertime."
"I toyed with the idea of giving it just four or four and a half stars but there are too many awesome things that I believe Feed truly deserves all five stars, here's why:*Very reasonably priced, you can get a lot of food for around $10.*Everything I've tried has been good or very good*But more than anything the desserts are out of this f*cking world. The red velvet cake and banana pudding are to DIE FOR, even the fruit pies, and I don't even like fruit pies are amazing.*It's byob, which doesn't make it a great place automatically but it's definitely a nice perk. The only downside is I wish the food was served hotter sometimes (not all of the time) sometimes it's just barely warm."
"The food is delicious, the prices are cheap and they have corn pudding, for crying out loud!I first went here a few months ago when I demanded fried chicken in celebration of my birth, and my friend only belatedly realized the birds here are roasted and not fried. It did not matter. I don't even think about fried chicken anymore, I just pine for Feed.I also love the corn pudding, but I've always been a sucker for a corn product.This is the kind of comfortable eatery that quickly becomes the go-to option when you're feeling happy but casual about being born, dirty and smelly and tired after moving, or just plain in need of good take-out that doesn't cost a fortune."
"Every time we go there, we have amazing service and incredible food."
Good Lord that is good Chicken Soup. Way Way Way above the rest - the people that own Feed are total professionals and Have their shit together.Have you seen where this place is? It is more reviews than most and is in a word of mouth location.The ambience is AWESOME inside or out on the patio.The staff are the cutest.The only thing I wouldn't recommend is their baked goods with the exception of the banana pudding- head down to TipsyCake (shameless plug!)Everything else is Amazing and fresh and you can see the tons of chickens roasting in the back!
"If you're looking for delicious homestyle chicken this is your place.  When we went we tried the light chicken and the pulled pork - both were moist and full of flavor.  The side dishes, however, were not of the same caliber.  The mac 'n cheese was especially disappointing - the texture was dry and despite the heavy-handed use of chili powder it was completely bland.  The other sides that we tried - coleslaw, corn pudding, fried okra - were merely average.  Chicken alone: 5 stars!  Overall rating: 3 1/2 stars."
"Finally got fed at Feed!Attempt number one,one foot into the place we're closed someone shouts! Minus the one star, I will admit it was close to closing. I love places stay open exactly to the time posted. Just my picky thing I guess.Attempt two, late Sunday afternoon, our fault for not checking out the hours.Third try is a charm and it was.The food was very good, I had the smaller burger and they cooked it medium rare, just the way I like it. My husband said the pulled pork was equally as good, we both ordered the mac and cheese, I thought it was good, however I like mine with more of a sharp cheddar bite to it, this was more of a smooth mellow flavor, hubby liked it more than me. The decor is definitely down home county with a side of retro.The menu is just good ole  home stuff, chicken, taters, pie and cake. Stuff like that.The atmosphere well, I have to tell ya, it made me feel like a kid again. I generally dislike a TV in a restaurant, but it worked in here. It was afternoon and they had cartoons on. I sat there eating my cake while watching the Pink Panther. Yes, made me feel like a ten year old. YAY!"
"I'm very annoyed with myself for not trying Feed earlier.  I really enjoy chicken.  I don't know why it took me so long.We got a whole chicken dinner to go.  Everything was delicious, and cheaper and fresher than KFC or Popeye's (hush, you love them too).  I wanted to pick the chicken carcass the next day..  but my roommate had beaten me to it.  4 stars, because the food is so good that you will end up gorging yourself on it and afterwards, feel deliciously fat and full and awful, all at the same time."
"I love everything about this Southern cookin' place.  From the free jukebox playing the pop romance hits of 1974 to the collard greens with gristle (must have) I heart Feed.  When I was sick and my chickensoup making girlfriend was out of town, I went to Feed. When my mom was in town and we wanted something casual and not to heavy I took her to Feed.  It's for all occasions and it's BYOB.  Time Out rated their burgers, which I haven't tried yet, as one of their top 25 in Chicago.  The chicken is rotisserie, has crisp flavorful skin and is moist, but not greasy.  It's served with a mystery, spicy near chipotle sauce for dipping and 2 tortillas for wiping up juices.I always get the succotash because it's perfect.  The mac n'cheese was too dry for me, but the mashed sweet potatoes were pretty good.  The desserts are home made, often with fresh fruit, and can be ordered a'la mode. Also, you can get dinner for 2 for $12.  Seriously.  When I'm broke and want something healthier than a bag of chips from the vending machine, I go to Feed, chat with the sweet & friendly owner, check for any new rooster pictures on the wall, spend $2.00 and get my daily dose of vitamins from the delicious succotash."
"Had an amazing breakfast after practice last weekend. I had the Fried Greed Tomatoes Benedict which was delicious. My friend had the Scotch Eggs which I would like to try next time. Parking is easy.  They only accept cash, but there is an atm inside."
"This place is lovely if you like okra and garlicky greens like I do. And I love smoked meat, and that is some nicely smoked chicken. Cash only. It's great for the price. Mmm.. I go back to this place and bring new people there, when they say they don't want to spend much money. great food for good value. yay Feed!"
"We took a trip out here from work one afternoon. Getting out of the loop for lunch is a treat alone. We scored a parking space right out front so that was awesome since it was chilly out that afternoon. When you walk in the decor is great - chickens everywhere. I ordered a very tasty pulled pork sandwich for lunch, maybe not as good as a BBQ place but still worth it. The sides you can choose from is what makes Feed a home run."
"I don't know why I avoided this place for so long.  Yes, I avoided it.  Why you ask?  Because of its strange, remote location and I'm just kinda of a chicken sometimes when it comes to places off the beaten path.  Speaking of chickens, this place is kitschy chicken heaven.  Truly, I love the interior.  Warm, homey, relaxing, country, and so kitschy.  Chicken figurines, signs, etc.   And the food!  Like country magic.  I ordered the fried green tomato egg benedict with a side of fried okra.  Well prepared, large portions of country goodness.  The service was also really friendly and casual.  Prices ain't half bad considering all the food I received.  Too much food for me to finish.  I can't wait to come back."
"I'm not sure I buy into all of the hype that seems to surround feed...I have been there numerous times, but only for lunch...Its good, but I can't say that it is great. The menu is limited, but I am completely fine with that...stick to your guns...I think the sides could be the best part as the chicken is delicious, but nothing mind blowing...fried okra is amazing, the veggies are usually solid as wellOther tidbits:-Salsa/BBQ sauce....not a fan-People are nice and self serve is fine by me-The salad is huge and satisfying if you are contemplating that (although it is really just a giant bed of lettuce with a bunch of chicken on top)-Have not tried the desserts, but have heard good things-Price for a lunch can get a little pricey (nothing crazy, but for self serve I like to keep it at around $5, not $8)It gets an extra star for the interior decor (really makes this place) as well as potential for BYOB dinner (have not tried,) as the cost benefit equation would make this place a hit in my book."
"After my somewhat disappointing experience at Table Fifty-Two, I was still in the mood for southern home cooking.  Feed delivered at a fraction of the price.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because the menu is a little limited, but I give them props for sticking to what they do well and not trying to stretch beyond what they can handle.We split the pulled pork sandwich and the chicken.  The chicken was a little bland, but it's served with this salsa that is truly unique -- sweet and a little spicy.  The pulled pork was AWESOME!!!  It's the style of pulled pork that is made with vinegar and spices, not a red bbq sauce.  It was really spicy and really tasty.  It comes with slaw and handcut fries.  We also got two sides with the chicken: corn pudding and beet salad.  The beets are pickled!  Pickled beets have always been a favorite of mine.  The corn pudding is superb.  All in all, a wonderful meal with no wait on a Sunday.  A truly wonderful find."
"you come here for only one thing and they do it well: comfort chicken! .... and brunch apparently according to my beau. i've got summer ahead of me still to update this of that branch.i've only eaten on the patio when it's nice outside after long bike rides. the lemonade hits the spot! i have them water it down a tad cuz im a snob and don't care for my lemonade too sweet, but really it probably doesn't need it. - came to that realization my last meal there. i've never taken advantage of the byob deal which is always brilliant - but no qualms i shall.i split the whole chicken with my beau and you get three sides our last dinner. we chose mac & cheese, succotash, and beet salad all of which hit the nail on the head enough to make me not wanna try and venture onto their other great choices. they give you two tortillas with the chicken so i peel a bit and douse it with louisiana hot sauce - even though it stands alone quite well. it's a gem! you gotta come out of your neighborhood shell and find this place and try for yourself."
"I stopped into Feed on a whim as I was passing by on foot, and found a pleasant little place with a do-it-yourself cafeteria vibe, and a small, unpretentious dining room. I was there after lunch, but before dinner, so they weren't crowded at all, and when I came out of the bathroom after washing my hands, my food was already up on the counter. I got a 1/4 dark chicken with two sides for about $7, and it was just what I expected. The macaroni and cheese was a little bland, but hot and comforting, and the mashed potatoes and gravy were very chunky and seemed homemade. The chicken was fine, though I'm not sure what ""wonder roasting"" involves, as it was a pretty straightforward preparation. The leg and thigh were of average size, and came with a couple flour tortillas and a ramekin of garlicky, spicy vinaigrette, while the side dishes were of slightly larger-than-average size . The counter person was friendly and responsive in taking my order and handing me a plastic tray, though she didn't actually come around to serve or clear anything, so I can't comment on the waitstaff aspect, but overall I was pleased and thought the meal was a good value. Re: stuff I didn't order, the cornbread next to the register was uncovered and looked kind of dry, as did the biscuits, but the people to my left got a gorgeous side of sauteed spinach that gave me a definite case of diner's-envy. By the time saw it, I was too full of carbs to add anything else to my meal, but I would certainly make it a point to try the spinach, if I ever happen to return."
"consider this a 3.5 star review. Its not my favorite place in the city, but i come here often. The good:- brunch on the outside patio - its super cute and charming.- the crab cakes -some sort of special i got once- the corn pudding-the wilted spinachthe ok:- the mac and cheese- kinda greasy and too peppery- the mashed potatoes- too peppery- salad (what was i thinking ordering that though, anyways?)- mushroom cheese omelet - it was a fine omelet, just didnt really thrill meIll keep coming back. Theres lots more stuff id like to try and its super cheap. Cash only. BYOB."
"One of my favorite brunch spots, and the best southern/american style breakfast I've found in chicago."
"Love, love, love Feed.The food is delicious (though not always hot), the atmosphere is amazing and will make you feel like you are on psychedelics, and the staff is always a delight to interact with. This is the sort of place I like to take my friends and family from out of town. It's crazy if you live in Chicago and haven't been there yet."
"If you like your rotisserie chicken, this place is it!  The chicken is cooked just right.  The owner is always there to make sure it's cooked to perfection..just enough juice.  The sides are a little bland but they are still delicious.  This place is BYOB so make sure you come with your favorite beer in hand.  They also only accept cash, but they have an ATM machine so just make sure you have your debit card on you. :) Also, they have a plastic egg machine..if you get the ""golden"" egg, you may be famous at Feed.  Go with an empty belly because their comfort food will fill you up perfectly!"
"Went there Saturday, after watching U of I lose to Gonzaga -- Loved this place!  I had a BBQ chicken sandwich, corn pudding & beet salad -- the price is very reasonable...  The food is VERY good.  They served far more than I could/should eat.  I will go back there..."
"one of my favorites in Chicago,  best chicken, okra, mashed taters, and pulled pork.  This place is so comforting and has wonderful customer service."
"Liz and Donna truly offer up some down home comfort with Feed.  For family style home cooked food search no further.  The chicken is always fresh and moist, the sauteed spinach is amazing and the decor is warm and relaxing.  Great deserts made fresh daily add the final touch to an already wonderful experience.  My only criticism if I had to offer one would be the cash only aspect.  Other than that it's all good!"
This place is a dream!  Everything from the down home waitresses to the hundreds of chicken portraits on the walls made me feel like I was on the set of Green Acres.  I half expected Mr. Haney or Arnold the Pig to come out of the back.  The juke box is free to pump out sounds of Nashville and Memphis.  All a great atmopshere to eat your meal in.  They have specials for the light to heavy appetites.  The Fried Green Tomatoes on Eggs Benedict was fabulous.   Other meals I saw around the place were catfish sandwich that looked mighty tasty.  I reckon the corn pudding was about as good as granny made.   This place is definitely going to be one of my number one choices on a lazy saturday or sunday afternoon.
"I had a dream once that I was in feed, bathing in their mashed potatoes. It was an awesome dream. One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Real southern cooking, just like grandma made before we sent her to the home. Fantastic chicken. Spectacular burgers. Actually good BBQ pulled pork!! (A rarity in Chicago) Homemade pie. Delicious sides and yummy vegetables. This is where I discovered that, believe it or not, Brussels sprouts can be delicious. Sure, like others have said, it's unhealthy. Lots of butter. But it's real butter and food actually made in the kitchen, not frozen across country and shipped in. Which counts for something major. The atmosphere is great, full of roosters and Christmas lights, kitsch, friendly, and counter staff who love their food and would love to talk to you about it. In the summer, they have a really lovely back patio and a regular waitress who I love. It's a pretty spectacular night for my boyfriend and I to pick up some booze and dine in their backyard."
"The hubs and I came here this morning for brunch.  We walked in and were unsure if we ordered at the counter, sat down ourselves or had to wait to be seated.  I walked up to the counter and a server asked if we would order out.  I told her we wanted to eat in and she said to take a seat anywhere.  No problem.  I just wish someone would have informed us when we walked in and the cowbell rang.  Anyhoo, we sat down and the server brought us water and menus.  The specials were written on a chalkboard above the kitchen.  I ordered the fried green tomato benedict with bacon and the hubby got the special blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon.  We love bacon.  Anyway, the food came out fairly quickly and boy, did it look good!  I enjoyed my benedict but wished for a few things. More hollandaise sauce please!  I think there was a drop of it somewhere.  One of the poached eggs was overdone.  The yolk was not runny.  Other than that, the meal was delicious.  The cornbread was fried a little but crumbled when you dug into it.  The potatoes were yummy but after eating the benedict, I couldn't eat anymore of the potatoes.  The blueberry pancakes were awesome I hear.  Hubs was expecting to have blueberries in the pancakes and not just smothered in sauce but he loved them anyway!  This was a great spot for breakfast.  Two meals, a coffee and a large oj was around $26.  Cash only!!  I can't wait to come back for dinner and try some chicken and sides!"
"I really love visiting Feed!  There is something about collard greens and homemade mac and cheese that just can't be beat!The food is yummy, the prices won't break the bank, and the atmosphere is part vintage, part southern, with a dash of hilarious-ness!For a cool Chicago experience, check out Feed.....today!"
"The owner Donna has it right with this place.  Also running Bite, she has the perfect and simple formula of decent prices paired with made with love, from scratch dishes.  The main dishes here are all meat (country fried steak, slow roasted chicken) and while they look delicious, I am a vegetarian so I stick with the ""five sides"" meal for 7.95.  I AM PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH THIS!! Yesterday, I got the fried green tomatoes (oh my god), succotash, beet salad, brussel sprouts (perfectly shaved) and corn pudding.  The corn pudding is to die for as well.And Donna, being the sweet woman she is, sent out a piece of the fresh fried figgy pie served with vanilla ice cream.  It was hot and flaky.  Donna also bought the restaurant goers a game of Scrabble in case anyone is into it -- because she saw my friend Dmitry and I play it every time we come in.  hahaThe decor of this place.. is no less than farmer/hometown.  I am sheerly DELIGHTED ... because I am kind of obsessed with chickens.  Every wall is plastered in varieties of chickens, cocks, roosters, and chicks.  Perfection."
"God, I was excited about this place. Being from Virginia and having a roommate from Kentucky officially makes me a Southern food expert. At least in my mind it does.The chicken was good, I'll give it that. But the sides... now, if you are a Southern food aficionado like I am, you know that the sides are the true testament to a good meal. To maximize our sides intake, my roommate ordered the half chicken with 2 sides, choosing the beet salad and the spinach. I ordered....every other side on the menu that day. I like food, what can I say.My biggest disappointment was with the mac n cheese. It looked quite cheesy, but really had very little flavor. The corn pudding was ok, but I've had better in many other places. The cole slaw was interesting, but true southern cole slaw is loaded with mayo, unlike this vinegar based variety. Mashed taters were very peppery, which I liked, but they, like everything else on my plate, were lukewarm. The fried okra I'm pretty sure came out of a bag. Oh, and the sweet tea is not sweet- at all. The spinach was probably my fave. I was expecting it to be like the spinach that comes on your middle school lunch tray (like most southern spinach is) but really it was quite good...only moderately wilted and very garlicky without having cloves of garlic in every bite. Really really tasty. Overall I left stuffed and for only $10 a person, but I'd only eat here again if I were in the neighborhood."
"From the super chill out door patio, to the no holds barred take on southern food, this is one of my faves!  Brunch is a no brainer, I have worked my way through almost the entire menu and have found no week links.  Shrimp and grits, always perfectly moist swimps and rich creamy grits, the biscuits are flaky and the gravy is wavy, in a good way.  Had an arepa special, I will not deduct for authenticity, because these were more pancake like than arepa like, in all honesty better than real arepas,  chock full of corn and other goodies, served with a really nice ancho chile sauce and pulled pork, the kitchen constantly turns out excellent food, for a bargain price.  The service, tatood and pierced to the max, with an attitude of pure friendlyness, I have seen them a little stressed but they did not let it detract from the experience. As for another reviewer wanting more vegetarian options, the sweet potato hash covers it all, mine had broccoli, peppers and spinach, the menu doesn't list all the ingredients so they can be market flexible, you just have to trust them.  Any restaurant can throw some veggies into hash and move on, but this dish has love in it, someone in the kitchen loves food and it shows, and I love them!    I still haven't made it out on a week day so I can only write about brunch."
"3.5 stars.  I really like this place.  The banana pudding is fantastic, as are the sides of black eyed peas, collards, mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, pickled beats--if they have a gumbo or jambalaya special consider it your lucky day and go for it!  BYOB and make an evening of it, or grab something down home and tasty in a hurry.  The chicken/rooster/egg decor is out of this world."
"Love the place, have been going there over a year now. I guess I could say I was a fan since ""before it got popular,"" but that wouldn't be true; it seems like they've been hot since day 1. The owners Donna & Liz are a lot of fun; they have a bunch of 80s-era   TV shows on video, which play on their only TV set. If you've never hung out with them, I can also tell you Liz is a real good singer & decent guitar player - maybe some mandolin, too? They really like quality musicians, which is good thing, as Superior Street rehearsal studios are just around the corner, and Feed has a steady stream of customers from there. Again, any place like this in Humboldt Park is an oasis, but they'd do well anywhere. In this review, however, with all due respect to Donna's skill as a chef & restauranteur, I want to put the spotlight on my pal Dan Pearce, who also cooks there. Dan is not only an excellent musician &  fun guy (Berklee Music School, plays bass & guitar), but a VERY talented chef. I say the c-word because, if he weren't working for Donna, he could be a chef at many, many places. FYI, Dan has been there over a year, they seem to get along pretty well, and it's actually quite a compliment that Donna trusts him with her food when she's not around.The thing about Dan (he'll tell you): Just like me, he loves playing music at least as much as he likes to cook. And that makes it hard for him to really bear down on either vocation. Again: I understand. But as this is a food review, I'll tell you a few things I've noticed about Dan's cooking: S K I L L. If you judge things by the side dishes, Dan's a killer. Don't get me wrong: the rotisserie chicken, the burgers, their gumbo - all great. But when you see a PERFECTLY sauteed/seasoned side of spinach sitting beside the soup (say THAT 5 times fast)... that's what gets my attention. And yes, I always tell Dan to his face how much I dig his cooking.On a final note, Dan tells me metromix was shooting video of them recently for a segment somewhere; Donna being Donna, she didn't want to be on camera, so they highlighted Dan instead. He's good on camera, kind of a rockabilly-looking kid; did I say ""funny?"" And, I'm told, Liz was running around (again) in this big yellow furry chicken costume. Should be an interesting segment...."
"Feed has never let me down.  Brunch, lunch or dinner, the food is always excellent, and it always hits the spot."
I like this place but don't LUV it.  The chicken is pretty good.  The patio is fun in the summer time.  It's reasonable price...meaning you get a lot of food for around ten bucks.  I don't like that it's cash only.  I have gotten the mac and cheese a few times and did not think it was that great.  I do think the veggie sides are the way to go.  The decor is awesome and typically a cool crowd is in this place.  Ohh and BYOB.  Yes!
Amazing place & food. It has this family atmosphere here. Really like it a lot.
"Everybody seems to love this place, so I guess I'm in the minority when I say it's just ""ok"".  The thing is, I've had some good stuff here.  The collard greens, the mac and cheese, the chicken.  But none of it was memorable.  I feel like I could do just as well in my own kitchen.  My boyfriend loves the pulled pork, so it gets an extra half star for that.  And it's one of the few takeout options in the area.  But it's not something I'd go out of my way for."
"Ok, I went  to feed not to long ago and I had a horrible experience there! some colleagues and I went there to bid one employee farewell. I ordered a grilled chicken salad and lemonade. First off the lemonade was sitting in a pitcher with no covering or lid on it. So, it looked a little ""iffy""! But, I drank it any way! I figured if I got sick I know who to blame. Anyhow, one of my colleagues is a vegan so she ordered a salad and lord in behold, she found a bug in her salad!!! OMG!!   She took her food back to the front and they gave her her money back as well as a thing of macraroni for free! They looked so embarassed and apologized a kazillion times! Needless to say, I couldn't eat another bite of that salad. HMmmmm....Now that I think about it  those croutons were pretty suspicious tasting!Yeah, you won't catch me dead in that place again!! Gross!"
"we went to feed on mother's day.  they were busy.we'd never been there and we stood around for several minutes, fully in the way of the tiny man changing the trash and pretty much everyone else. then we finally asked what the hell we were supposed to do.  is there a list somewhere? what's going on?  it seemed that the waitresses addressed most other people that walked in and told them to add their name to the list on top of the garbage can.  to be fair, as a twenty-something couple, we probably looked like we'd been there before. and they were busy.  we were seated in the middle of the room, which made me happy because the outer edges were being surveyed by everyone waiting to eat. we got menus.  then we sat there. and sat there. watched the people around us inhale huge plates of food.  the portions are quite generous. its cool, a lot of people are into that, we're just... not, really. the waitress apologized that things were taking so long when she took our order.  we didn't have anywhere to be since our moms are very far away.  i wanted to order the flannel hash (which sounded awesome) but i couldn't commit to that much in brunch leftovers, so i got a pretty simple eggs/toast/potatoes combo while my companion got biscuits and gravy with eggs, which i'm pretty sure i talked him into. we couldn't both get the same thing. bor-ing. the food was good. the eggs were the standout.  i usually think that restaurant eggs are little too greasy for my liking.  its a thing: wet eggs are gross. these were cooked cleanly and evenly.  fluffy eggs.  major points from me.  when we were done eating, we sat there.  and sat there.  there was a lot of sitting and waiting involved in my trip to feed. when the server came back, she told us that somehow we'd gotten lost in the shuffle and she felt really bad. she gave us two sides of banana pudding to go as penance. feed, you are forgiven because i wasn't even mad and that pudding was awesome. i will definitely go back to feed at some point.  i saw someone else get the mountain of hash and i need to try that.  i'd like to come back for non-brunch, even. i love me some sides and the list looked delicious.  the servers were really nice and food was good. fluffy eggs alone will bring me back. that, and banana pudding.  seriously guys... banana pudding."
"I had heard a lot about this place from others and I'm happy to confirm that it is all that it was built up to be:  limited but well done menu with a fun atmosphere, reasonable prices, hefty amount to eat.   Very cool place, somewhat isolated but worth a side trip!   The chicken was great, fun southern-style sides."
"I must have gone on an off day... The food was just ""ok"".I took a taxi and was a bit worried because the neighborhood was looking questionable.   Make sure you get a taxi number for the ride home because there aren't very many taxi's driving around there.  The decor was adorable.  Red and with lots of chicken decor.  The cashier/waitress was really friendly and helpful.My friend and I ordered the two 1/4 chickens, corn bread pudding, fried okra, beet salad and greens.The corn bread pudding was dry. The fried okra was from frozen and not made fresh.  The greens were missing the hamhock flavor.  The chicken was on the dry side but the skin was yummy.   The best thing was the beet salad.Dessert time - had the banana pudding and blackberry pie.  I LOVED The banana pudding and my friend liked the blackberry pie.  The crust on the pie was excellent, but the reason I didn't really dig it was because it was on the tart side for me.  I'll have to try other things on the menu when I come back and try to figure out why so many people gave it 5 stars."
"NOT OVERPRICED at all, just got lunch there with a friend, we split the 5 sides for $7.50, and a soda, for under $10, and we were stuffed....great dealthe sides are great, and the sandwiches are like $8 with 2 sides, i totally recommend this place, great homestyle cooking"
"I hope you love chicken. And don't mind staring at five dozen photos and images of it (them) as you eat. For its kitschy-creepy decor, Feed is a nice little spot to get some good farm-feelin' eats. The chicken, obviously, reigns supreme here, but the sweet potato fries should definitely find their way into your order. Other sides like macaroni and cheese were standard, but good. Feed is cafeteria style and cash-only, so it's the most casual of eateries. Go there on a freezing cold day after you've skipped a shower or two and have nothing but a few tatty dollars in your pocket. You'll leave feeling pretty good."
"Ok..so the cornbread pudding/stuffing was pretty good. My breakfast potatoes were greasy and salty--not a decent combo! The eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese was just ok. The toast, hot chocolate, and apple cinnamon marmalade were good..hence the 2nd star I've given this place. Don't know If I'd go back to 'feed' myself..and that's a big IF."
"Brussel Sprouts. Don't care if you love 'em or hate 'em. You have to try them here if they are available. Bliss, pure bliss. And brussel sprouts and bliss usually are mutually exclusive. Pie. Save room for pie.Oh yeah, and the chicken isn't bad either. If you are waiting for your takeout order, read the book on the organ about chicken varieties. You will be amazed.Very sweet counter help, too.When boston chicken really was boston chicken and not boston market, it was a modest chicken restaurant in Boston. Go figure. Feed's food reminds me of the food they used to serve when Boston chicken was still a tiny local boston chain.Oh yeah -- it is definitely the safest restaurant in town. Last time I went, there was a table of about 12 local cops, chowing down. And if that ain't a ringing endorsement for chow value, I don't know what is.Update 12-07:Caped Wonder and I went for brunch. Despite losing our ticket (how they did this I still do not know), they somehow managed to make up for it with obsequiousness and the bottomless cup of coffee that made us both hungry and jittery. At one point half of the restaurant was filled with hungry patrons angling for a seat, and the Caped Wonder and I felt a bit as though we were on stage in a sad unscripted dramedy. Brunch was OK - cheese grits needed a lot of salt to make them taste good. I prefer the chicken at dinner and the sides....."
"It's a strange place but not in a bad way. It's different and cool in it's own special way ,but the food is great. A great place for cheap eats..."
"There are several things I like about Feed: first and foremost, the CORN PUDDING... so to die for! The decor is super cute and they have a great jukebox. However, the last two times I have been there, my food has been cold. Just flat out cold. Also, it wasn't very fresh. Another Yelper mentioned the overdone mac and cheese and that's certainly been my experience lately. I can't say I will abandon them yet though as they have 3 of my most favorite things in the world - dark meat, mac and cheese and that delicious (even if it is cold) corn pudding."
Awesome American Style restaurant!!!!!
"Probably my favorite restaurant within walking distance.  The chicken may be the best in the city and the side dishes are great.  If you're lucky and they have sweet potato fries as a special, go with that.And definitely get the banana pudding.  Well worth it."
"I brought my whole family here for an early dinner in the Summer. Totally awesome country order at the counter and sit, eat with your hands and loads of napkins gooey comfort food like Mac n Cheese, BBQ Chicken, Fried Okra, Pulled Pork, Black Beans, Collard Greens, and possibly the only place in the CITY to get a decent slice of Pie.I'm sure it's severely unhealthy, loaded with butter and oil, but it feeds a family of 5 real cheap, and its easy to enjoy the FREE jukebox of Old 45s. I could go for those hand cut fries right now."
The catfish sandwich is amazing. It's really hot in this place in summer but bringing our own beer helps us forget about that. The staff is super friendly and the bbq chicken is really good. The sauce on it was sweet and spicy. I can't say enough good things about the catfish though. Yum. We keep coming back for it!!!
"I dig this place.  The food is delicious, and it's very authentic down home cookin'.  The chicken is delicious, also try the mac & cheese, the okra, collard greens, coleslaw, and any of the freshly baked pies.Definitely a good addition to the neighborhood!  With the condos going up across the street and Humboldt Park's gradual emergence as a nicer neighborhood, this restaurant or some incarnation of it should be a staple for years to come.  This is the kind of new restaurant in a working class neighborhood that I like (unlike Treat at North & Kedzie).It can get a tad cramped when it's really busy, but that's about the only thing that sucks.  Oh yeah, and I liked the old Pizza Lounge next door much more than the new Continental.  But that's another review altogether..."
"Overrated..Overrated!  I am happy that this place exists, but I think they have a few issues: 1.) Inconsistent sides 2.) often times surly service.  I went in to gwt take out a month ago and the girl at the counter did not smile or echange any pleasantries.  I think she just thought she was hot sh&t for working there.  Chicken is good, though, and the iced tea/lemonade self serve station in awesome.  Again, I'm happy that a place like this is in the neighboorhood, but there are some tweaks needed."
"Are you kidding me?! I went back to feed for a second time after they forgot 3 of my sides last time. I asked them to really double check the bag before they gave it to me because they forgot three sides last time. I didn't even get a ""sorry!"" and it was the same girl who forgot them in the first place! She caught that they forgot both of our deserts. We get home and they forgot the pitas for the whole chicken we ordered. Funny thing is, the pitas were the deciding factor to coming back in the first place. The take out packaging also sucks. They stuffed the whole chicken into a Styrofoam container and it was ripped, cold and dripping everywhere by the time we got back."
Great breakfast. Real homecooked food. Awesome.
"I really want to enjoy Feed. It has everything I could ever want chicken and a lot of sides. And it's all Southerny too, so what could possible go wrong? The correct answer is service. Yes the service, and all those little small things that piss you off in life. If I was just rating food and nothing else they would easily get 3.5 stars, maybe even 4 if I'm feeling generous. And their banana pudding is easily five stars, for serious. But I've had take out from here multiple times and they always forget things. And the way they package their take out is also miserable. Because they just throw everything in styrofoam three section containers. And that is probably the worst possible way of packaging take out food. I realize that packaging take out isn't the most important part, but it is not a step that should be over looked completely. And if my review was based on their food alone it would be higher. But they need to stop forgetting shit on take out, and rethink their take out procedure."
"The Metromix review of Feed states that ""Feed is courtesy of Donna Knezak (ex-Leo's Lunchroom and an original partner of Bite Cafe) and partner Liz Sharp."" When you add this information together, Feed makes a lot of sense, if you've been to both Bite and Leo's Lunchroom (RIP). The decor is made up of images of chickens as well as a stuffed chicken. It's homey yet funky. It actually reminded me a bit of a larger place in Austin, TX that I went to during SXSW called Pok-E-Jo's Smokehouse. If you are a fan of southern side dishes, the selection you have here will leave you salivating, even after you've had your fill. Other reviews have said that the spotlight here is chicken, but I disagree. The sides stand out for me. The chicken was good and tender, but the seasoning wasn't there. I may be biased, but the best  rotisserie chicken I have ever had is at Crisp 'N Juicy in Arlington, VA. The rotisserie chicken at Feed doesn't hold a candle to C 'N J, but no place else comes close either.I ordered a quarter chicken dark, with sides of fried okra and mashed potatoes. I didn't like the dipping sauce for the okra since it seemed tp be mayonnaise, but those little guys were delicious on their own. The mashed potatoes were delicious and the chicken gravy on them was great. I'd imagine this would be a tough place to be vegan and dine at, but vegetarians could easily put together a delicious meal here. I was so full that I could not order dessert, so I helped Kris eat her banana pudding, while we pondered what makes 'nila wafers and banana pudding go so well together. From now on when I feast at Feed, I'll save room for sweet tooth sustenance to attempt to answer this age old question."
Four of us had brunch here recently and it was great all around.  I had the green chile pork pozole special which is basically a bowl of spicy zesty pork soup.  It came with eggs and tortillas and was fantastic.  I also sampled the pulled pork hash and b&g and all was very good.  Finished it off with their fantastic banana pudding.
"Feed was the first meal I had since getting my wisdom teeth out.  My friend Leigh knew they had mashed potatoes here and thought it would be a good place to eat some soft food.   It was.Feed is an order-at-the-counter type of place so I asked the girl at the counter what she would recommend as far as soft food.  We decided on the Mashed Potatoes and Banana Pudding.  They were both awesome.  The mashed potatoes were perfectly spiced and the Banana Pudding was awesome.  The decor here is totally festive with portraits of chickens all over the restaurant.  Its' a great place.  The best part about this place though is the price.  You can get a quarter chicken and two sides for $5.49 which a great deal.  Heck, those prices beat KFC.   ** Keep in mind that this joint is Cash Only."
"Ive been quoted as saying that feed is the best restauraunt in North America.I probably go to this place at least twice a month. Hands down my favorite restaraunt in Chicago. Ive only gotten the burger once and it was great but The chicken is a must and addicting. What really makes this place amazing is the sides. I used to get fried okra and mashed potatoes everytime but been trying to eat a little healthier so now I go for the Collard Greens (which might be the best ive ever had) or Spinach. Corn pudding= facemeltingly good. I reccommend sharing sides with friends to make a franken-side taco with the tortilla's they give you. Portions are generally huge, I usually end up taking half of it home, price is right. byob is cool, sometimes its nice to have a drink at the bar next door afterwards.Only downside to it bieng so good is that its been pretty packed for a while now (extra unfortunately is that sometimes its with crying babies and freewheeling 4 year olds.  With types moving in to the surrounding neighborhoods my beloved feed transforms into a chuck e. cheese every once in a while) Best to hit it on a weeknight or early if you want to easily grab a seat."
"as i read reviews of feed --  a very local gem for me - i've been surprised to read that people don't find this place absolutely stellar.  based on negative comments, i will write a few reasons why you might be a person that would NOT like feed,1.  you hate chicken and you came here anyway, planning to punish yourself.2.  you dream of chickens haunting your under-bed every evening3.  you type with your tongue and therefore have lost all sense.4.  you are an extreme yankee (having fought in the civil war yourself) and can't handle the idea that the south might have some culinary prowess."
"Picture Boston Market done Right.All the food is fresh, hearty comfort food.  There are several choices and several fresh homemade desserts.  The Chicken I had was great, the mac and cheese was light on cheese, but otherwise good.  The green beans were great.  Pork chops smothered in onions were also excellent.  This place is like all of White Fence Farm crammed into a storefront.  It's also hipster city.  There were a couple moms with kids, but the rest of the people were very much of the ""Can you believe how kitschy this place is?"" set.  Lots of soul patches, vintage sweaters, and vintage glasses.Regardless, the food is great and cheap.  Definitely worth the trip."
"i ate here for the first time last nigh. WONDERFUL!! great chicken, had the white meat, and it wasn't dry! the salsa is great and so are the mashed taters and the grilled corn on the cob was awesome. my friend got the 5 sides, she didn't like some of the things, but i tried them and they were AWESOME!! she doesn't like pepper in things. (i know! she must be insane (jk) i love her!)a little hot in there, but it added to the ""southern-ness"" of it all. i'll be back FO SHO!"
"Kitchy, chicken wire joint in Humboldt Park brings the down home flavor to the Humby. I am a huge Harold's Chicken Shack fan and this chicken competes. I wish that there was a little hot sauce. Not much choice here. You get Chicken, a few sides (as an OK outlaw, I loved the okra), Iced Tea (serve yourself), and to top it all, a styrofoam cup of the best banana pudding in the world cover with some nilla wafers.You may not have the glitz that comes with Northside dining, but you get easy parking and a cup of the banana pudding."
"This IS what the original Boston Chicken was like practically a lifetime ago - only Feed has an even better selection of sides (I hold up the line trying to decide which to choose) and the bird is still better than most. Good desserts too - though I'm usually too stuffed.Not exactly a convenient location for us - but a good choice when we're in that neck of the woods, hungry and not concerned about having a ""dining experience."""
"My friend Shane and I were on our way to Bingo Night at the California Clipper when he called from work in Darien and asked if I wanted to meet for dinner. Although I had never been to Feed, I knew that it was right around the corner from the Clipper and decided it was high time I tried this cult favorite in West Town. I must say, I'm very glad that we went. The entire place it funky and fun. Shane and I were super excited to cue up the free songs on the juke box, although, being limited, we heard ""Benny and the Jetts"" about three times during our meal. I was completely mesmerized by all the photos of chickens on the wall. ""That one looks like a lion! That one looks like Liza Minelli!"" I ordered the five sides for $7.49. Out of the many tempting options, I selected beet salad, black beans, corn pudding, mashed potatoes and gravy, and spinach. Shane ordered a quarter white chicken, french fries, and mac n' cheese. The beet salad was incredible! It was creamy without having cream, if that makes sense, and had this addictive hint of cinnamon...or was it cloves? The black beans were delicious too. The spinach, while very simple, was fresh and satisfying. Shane raved about his chicken. The mac n' cheese improved after it was seasoned with the hot sauce on the table.  The corn pudding was a little on the dry side. I will definitely come back, hopefully for brunch. The menu, with its sweet potato hash and fried green tomatoes, looked fantastic! I am also interested in the pulled pork sandwich. In fact, the only item on the menu that does not catch my fancy is the okra, but that's because I hate all okra. Great atmosphere, comfy and edgy at the same time. A winning restaurant you can go to and then walk to the California Clipper---it's as if  Flying Saucer were open for dinner or something."
"i loved walking into feed at 7:30 pm on a friday night to a relaxing, just busy enough atmosphere where my friend and i could kick back and have a great session catching up while working our way through a six pack.  god did this beat the hassle of eating out on a friday night in chicago.  i guess i'm pleased as punch to be ""in the middle of nowhere.""  i feel like there was definitely music playing but it was not a distraction.  christmas lights adorn the cute little inside restaurant with a short order cook type order counter and vintage chicken theme collectibles are the main decoration.  my friend and i ordered some food from the counter (i kind of like not having table service because then you aren't interrupted every five minutes or so) and i have to say, picking from the wide selection of sides was a little stressful - they all sounded so good!  i ended up getting a pulled pork sandwich with fries and creamed spinach.  the sandwich was spectacular and so was the creamed spinach.  i was a little disappointed by the fries, a lot of them were undercooked but aside from that, a spectacular meal.  i had a bite of my friend's mashed potatoes and was jealous so i think i'll get that next time.  anyway, i think feed is a perfect place to go fill up and also enjoy being in good company.also, if i can say so (turns out i can!), i think its great to have a restaurant where people learn to clean up after themselves.  how hard is it to put your dishes in a tub and throw away your garbage?  chicago is the only major city i've been in where littering seems second nature.  it digusts me."
"Loved the pulled pork sandwich. Mac and Cheese, eh, but boy that potato salad, WOW! I think next time I come ill take some potato salad to go. It is quite warm in there so dress lightly. BYOB is nice though. Can't wait to try the chicken, my friend had it and it looked really good. Hope to also try out brunch since it has so many rave reviews. Come here, its cheap, the staff rocks and its all around great comfort food!"
"Oh Feed how I love you. Let me count the ways... Feed has great food. I have to seriously put a limit on how much I go there because its going to go straight to my thighs. They have a good but concise menu. The roasted chicken is really good. The skin gets really crispy and is seasoned well. The mac and cheese is a little spicy, the corn pudding as well. The corn pudding is like the best mix of two foods - cornbread and stuffing - but better than you can put in words. They do have some salads on the menu and succotash, but really? Who can go and not get the bad-for you ones, like mashed sweet potatoes. They also have sweet potato fries as a special M-T, which is awesome!  And the red velvet cake is to die for. The jukebox with old johnny cash and other old favorites on it is free, and I love the clucky chicken vending machine that spits out little plastic eggs with toys inside. Its definately one of my top restaurants in the city. The brunch is good too, with cheese grits and crunchy potatoes. Only downside is that it can be a little inconsitant. Sometimes the mac and cheese is different, less spicy, and the potatoes not as crispy. But usually its pretty damn good.----------- edit 6/30/08Have you been on the patio? Flippin fabulous. I went for brunch on saturday and its so cute with lights (good at night I'm sure) and cute tables and hidden away. Its so great! And they were  playing elvis costello. Could I love this place any more? Another good thing? I ordered a denver omelet minus the ham, and she gave me cheddar cheese as a replacement. sweet! most places are just like... whatever. I  LOVE FEED!"
I definitely didn't know what to expect when I pulled up here.   I put away my weird meat issues and dove in!  I shared a pulled pork sammy and mash potatoes with H20.  Very much a home cooked meal.   one MUST LOVE MEAT to eat here and have a blind eye at all the chicken paraphernalia on the walls.
"when i first walked in here, this place reminded me of a mess hall from a rob zombie movie...the clucking noise of chickens and the general kitsch just added to the bizarreness. is that even a word? being surrounded by loud families and hipsters, it felt like a family reunion of unknown sorts. anyway, i ordered the five sides for $6.99. the mac-n-cheese (it seemed like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours) and the coleslaw (no flavor whatsoever, kfc has better 'slaw?) were such letdowns but the other sides made up for the disappointment. i swear, the corn pudding (and the beet salad) gave me a food orgasm. and just for that, i will come back frequently.i will get that golden egg."
"If you're from the south and you miss it, go eat at FEED.  It's like walking into your granny's farm house and having a good old home cooked meal.  They have THE BEST southern food in Chicago.  Be sure to try their banana puddin'.  It's just like grandma's."
"Came here with the intent of getting white chicken and broccoli trees and they were out of both.  Ended up getting two corn cobs and fries.  Was cheap, but a horrible excuse for a dinner.  Pass."
"mmmmm, good.i wasnt expecting a whole lot out of this place.i really enjoyed it though. staff was friendly. small vintage space. order at the counter and bus your own table. prices were pretty good.i ordered 1/4 chicken with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.was good. the chicken was very juicy and tasty. the sides were good but a tad cold. my cousin got the corn pudding, which was great. ate some banana pudding, which was great too!oh and played a little bit of music on the vintage juke box.all in all, pretty basic food. pretty good."
"Bawk Bawk!  Feed is like chicken paradise.  I'm a fan of rotisserie chicken, Hell sometimes I will make my own whole chicken, but sometimes you feel like being lazy.  I got the quarter white meat chicken and I like the mac and cheese.  The decor cracks me up (yuk yuk yuk) and I gotta say it, I bought not one, but two eggs from the cackling chicken quarter machine.  I've been wishing for one of those babies since that stupid Target-esque store Venture closed.  Remember Venture?  The only complaint is that I wish there were more healthy veggie sides."
I've been dining at Feed since they opened but what made me want to write a review was the shrimp and grits special I had last Friday. The shrimp were large and deliciously seasoned mixed with bacon and an amazing sauce. The grits were creamy without being chunky and all this came bedded atop fresh spinach. I will put hot sauce on anything but not this. It was flavorful with a hint of spice and made me so happy. I regularly order the pulled pork or a half chicken but that shrimp should be on the menu for me to enjoy every week!
"We've all eaten at Feed for dinner and everyone knows it good, but they do an equally fantastic brunch too plus they have a nice patio out back (and allowed Lola my dog to hang out... check plus!). I've only had the hanger steak n eggs or pulled pork hash and both have been perfection in my mouth. If you're looking for a brunch option away from the trendy hub-bub of you know  where with straight up hearty meat-heavy brunch fare, check out Feed. Bring cash too."
"one of the coolest spots i've been to in chicago for breakfast. really comfortable atmosphere with a semi-diner type feel to it.never had a southern style breakfast of it's kind in chicago. sweet-potato hash, corn bread, apple smoked bacon, chicken fried steak.. the menu for weekend brunch is delightful & cheap.definitely going back.----------------later added: could have let me order breakfast at 10:55 gimme a break."
"just got home from feed and still smell like chicken. first and foremost, i can't believe how good a value feed is. my sister and i both ate for $13 including a tip. be prepared... there really isn't any service here, which i think, may be why it's so cheap. there was a woman taking orders and two cooks. no one brings you your food, no one takes your plate away or cleans your table for that matter. it's pretty bare bones, but again, the prices are so great i couldn't complain. as recommended, we shared a half chicken that was finger-lickin' good. so juicy and tender. the chicken came with two sauces... both were great. one almost like a chimichurri sauce and the other some sort of honey mustard type of thing. we also had the mac and cheese, which i actually don't recommend. it had a little too much of a smoky, spicy taste that i don't care for with my mac and cheese. we also had the sweet potato fries which were great.i left full and happy.must eat: chicken!"
"If you keep heading west on Chicago Avenue past Flo and past Sunrise you will run into this great little hole in the wall.  Quirky, cute, and yummy makes Feed a great spot to get your lunch, brunch, or both on.On this trip we had five adults and two itsy bitsy twins hungry for some home cooked goodness.  Three of us ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, which is served with fries and coleslaw.  The pork is well seasoned and tender. I'd like to see a little more pork and a little less bun, but the sandwich is still a winner. The fries are solid and the slaw is more vinegar based and has green peppers in it. Green peppers...hmmmm. Mike ordered the Chicken Friend Steak with Gravy.  This dish was served with eggs, potatoes, and toast.  Mike literally scraped the plate clean. It's safe to say the Chicken Fried Steak was a winner.  Audrey ordered 5 Sides. Basically, they slap five of their sides onto a plate and bring it out to you. Audrey's plate was filled with Fried Okra, Corn Pudding, Mashed Potatoes, Collard Greens, and Mac n' Cheese.  I could have done without the Mashed Potatoes, but everything was on the money.  The table also split an order of biscuits and gravy. I'm a stickler for biscuits and gravy and these were just ok.  I would have increased the amount of sausage in the gravy and once I did that I would have put a lot more gravy on the biscuits. But that's just me!Feed normally has Red Velvet Cake and Banana Pudding, but on this visit the desserts were Chocolate Cake and Cherry Pie.  Three of us had the Chocolate Cake, which was ok. Mike was the big winner with the ooooey gooeey warm Cherry Pie.  Despite the fact that they were out of the vanilla ice cream they normally serve it with, the pie was yummy on it's own.The decor at Feed is straight up down home fun.  From the kitschy pictures that are slapped all over the walls to the old school 45 jukebox, Feed is a bunch of fun.  The service is always spot on and the staff actually seems like they enjoy being there.  I really like this place and I hope you all will respect my wishes and stay away between 11:30 and 12:00 on the weekends so I don't have to wait.

"I live very close by, and when we moved in, I thought we'd be eating here all the time. The chicken and sides are good, not great. The staff is very friendly and warm. The one thing that is GREAT at feed is the breakfast and brunch. We make it a point to take people when they come in from out of town. Great backyard patio in the summer time."
"I had dinner here last night and am sure I will be back.   The chicken was crazy delicious... perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, moist, not too greasey.   The fried green toatoes were great too.  I will definitely be returning to Feed for the chicken and look forward to trying their other side dishes.My meal had one major flaw I have to point out:  the Mac&Cheese.  It sucks.  Mainly because there is no cheese.   Instead of Mac&Cheese what they gave me was a pile of half dried out macaroni noodles which had probably been laying in a warming pan the entire day.   They were slightly buttery but definitely NOT cheesey.   I checked with a couple of friends and they said they've had the same experience... so it seems the Mac&Cheese is consistently bad."
"Unbelievable and too close. Some of the best southern style around here, not to mention a great place to relax and an amazing staff . Red velvet cake, spaghetti, pulled pork. it's all good."
"Okay. Now I am a man who likes to eat. I like to eat chicken. I like to eat pork chops. I like to eat sides. Now these are all things that FEED has and is good at making. The staff is super nice and the decor is delightfully tacky. I quit eating meat since the last time I was there but am even more pumped to go back because it gives me an excuse to eat more sides. as a drink you can just get a bottomless cup of lemonade or iced tea. I prefer to mix them together. If you haven't been there, please try it. For the kids."
This place has great food. I loved it better before they raised the prices. But we still go there. They once has this rib-eye that was delicious!!!!!! Their fries are unbelievable. Their mac and cheese is way better than it once was. I would recommend it.
"I don't get the raves about this place.  The food is about as good as your average Boston Market.   It tastes nothing like real southern food.  I had the chicken, mac and cheese and collard greens and it was all pretty bland.  Not gross, but just not real flavorful.  We got the bread pudding for dessert and it was pretty decent, but again-not spectacular.  The sweet tea wasn't sweet.  I will say that the service was speedy and friendly.  And the cash only thing sucks."
"Being from South Carolina, I regularly enjoy good comfort food [and crave fried okra on a regular basis.] Feed is in my neighborhood, street parking is plentiful, food is pretty good and it is VERY cheap.            I've been there 2x in the last two weeks; once for dinner, once for brunch. For dinner, I got five sides which were mashed potatoes with gravy- perfect; spinach- not southern-style, instead wilted with garlic, but good nonetheless; beet salad -a standout ang big enough for leftovers; corn pudding- delicous but a little dry so I dipped it in gravy ;o) and the famed fried okra- which may be the the frozen, then fried kind, but I'd still order it again. My partner got the chicken, which he said was very tasty. We brought our son, who's about ten months old, and he happily munched on the mashed potatoes and corn pudding. (It felt family friendly, but we weren't sure if they'd have highchairs, so we brought our own that attached to a chair. For those of you with kiddies, feel comfortable bringing them.)           Brunch was good, but not as good as the dinner. Our waitress was sweet, but slightly frazzled as she may have been the only server.  We got the banana hazelnut french toast, which was more regular toast covered in bananas and nuts which was okay. We also got the cornbread, fried green tomato eggs benedict which was GREAT, but small considering the sizes of other items.            Oh, and did I mention that this place is BYOB? Chicken, okra and beer! YAY! The bottom line is that you can get a solid, Southern meal for $10 in Chicago, which is hard to beat."
"Don't you ever eff with feed, cause i'm in the hood and I'll know. There aren't a lot of restaurants around here and i wouldn't have it another way. I eat here about twice a week and No Im not fat. But I have had everything on the menu and you really can't go wrong ever. My favorites are the chicken dark, the catfish, and the banana pudding.  Unlimited sweet tea is pretty important too.  I'm from the south, and every time I think about going crazy, getting on the highway and heading back down to Georgia to have my grandma cook for me, I just roll out of bed (again no I'm not fat) and walk here instead. You have my heart now FEED me!"
"We've been enjoying the food at Feed - breakfast &amp; dinner - since we moved down the block about a year ago.  My favorites for breakfast are the fried green tomato eggs benedict and the sweet potato hash.  My husband likes the chicken fried steak. For dinner, the whole chicken with 3 sides is a great deal at just under $15: when the chicken is great, it's really great.  But from time to time, it's just been on that rotisserie a little too long.  It's still a good deal, just not quite as tasty.  Our favorite sides are the fried okra, spinach and beet salad.  Oh - and I forgot the corn pudding and cheese grits. My only complaint is that I wish there were less styrofoam containers used for the sides."
"Yay, Feed!  You won't often hear a vegetarian jump for joy at the idea of going to a chicken joint for dinner, but this place is great.  There's always a long list of sides that are clearly denoted as veg or non-veg, and there's the option of the ""meal of sides"" where you get ~5 sides for dinner!  Beet salad, cabbage, sauteed spinach, tasty mac n' cheese, corn pudding (not to be missed- it's basically cornbread that's smooshy), blackeyed peas.  Really, don't be turned off by all the chicken decorations (chicken art watching people eat chicken... i never understood... it's like the bbq joints decorated in pigs).  The red velvet cake is tasty too.  Don't forget to byob- the Nevada market two blocks east on Chicago can help you out with that."
"I just moved near this restaurant (a far cry from Wrigleyville where I was) and have been determined to find some new, great spots for which to eat in the new 'hood.  I had read a few nice reviews on Feed, and also got a few stellar word-of-mouth reviews.  Naturally, Feed was one of the first places we tried in the area.  We went with my BF's dad on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and enjoyed being able to sit on their wonderful back patio.  It was very cute back there, although they blared their music WAY TOO LOUD that day.  After being told so many times about all the different sides, I decided to make a meal of five sides, which was a great option on the menu to have.  You could definitely tell everything was homemade.  The mac n' cheese was creamy, thick and delicious, but also was a tad bland.    Surprisingly, one of my favs was the corn pudding, and that was my last choice in choosing sides.  It had just the perfect consistency and combination of sweet corn and spicy peppers and seasonings.  I also had fried okra, mash pots, and spinach - which were all quite tasty!  My boyfriend's pulled pork (which we had all read so much about) was dry and disappointing.  He was mad about that.  I think it was just an ""off"" day for that dish.  His dad's chicken and beet salad were highlights, as was the banana pudding I took home with me!  Yum yum!We had the opp to go back last weekend for Sat morning brunch, which was sooo excellent.  I would DEFINITELY recommend going for your first meal of the day.  The food is so heavy that you really need the day to digest it.  I remembered that the time before, my boyfriend's pork was dry and disappointing, but decided to give it a second chance and have the pulled pork hash for breakfast.  Wow was it tasty!  The pork was amazingly tender and perfectly seasoned.  The eggs were buttery, and the little bit of hot sauce I splashed on helped pull it all together.  Others in my party had the french toast, apple pancakes (those got rave reviews) and chicken fried steak - which was also so very good!  I really wanted to take home a slice of their famous red velvet cake, but they didn't have any in house that day - boo hoo.  I know I'll be back though, so next time, ahhh, next time.To make a long review even longer...Bottom line, the food is good, although heavy at times.  Go for breakfast.  Enjoy the chicken decor.  Cluck cluck cluck!!"
"Liked it alot!  The mac n cheese was spicy and yummy.  The mashed Potatoes were real, after I added a bit more salt, they were perfect.  The corn pudding was a bit spicy (due to chiles), but oh so yummy and buttery.  The chicken was a bit bland, but after I dipped the chix in some bbq sauce and salsa I was good to go.  I also liked the Black Cherry soda.  The owners or somebody are huge fans of Red Door Animal Shelter and bunny ownership (which I really find awesome).  All in all...a nice inexpensive place to visit!  I will be back many more times."
"Oh so kitchy and smarlty decorated- but the compliments end there.Like the others who have rated this joint poorly, the lack of flavor trumps any warm fuzzies you'll get from the atmosphere.  It's kinda grungy but but not cheap enough to coincide.  Plain and simple the food is BLAND!  I have given it three tries because I want to like it so much but it always underdelivers.  The mac and cheese is very dense and creamy but without any cheddar flavor (or cheese flavor period, for that matter).  The corn pudding is similar: cornbread with lots of corn kernels and a pound of heavy cream- again, rich, but no flavor.  Last time I had the catfish sandwich and what do ya' know?  Flavorless! Gummy bread and dry cornmeal crust.  If you have a little extra time go round the bend to Calvin's.  Everything is homemade so you'll just have to enjoy the salad that comes with your entree (along with 1-2 sides) while waiting the, on average, 20 minutes for your main dish to be prepared."
"I really wanted to like this place, but...A funky interior and friendly service cannot compensate for the food, plain and simple.  I had the half chicken dark with 2 sides, and was simply not impressed.  The chicken was juicy and of course better than what you would get at, lets say, a boston market but it was not seasoned enough and you really have to add your own hot sauce or salt to make it somewhat tasty.  The sides were decent.  The mac and cheese was somewhat plain but it wasnt too cheesy or greasy, and the sweet potato mash was somewhat runny... The standout was the corn pudding, a very dry, bread like stuffing that was so good that I may come back just for that, and try a non chicken item.        If you like southern food It's pretty safe to say you will enjoy your meal here, especially since you can get stuffed for around ten dollars, but for me it's not worth the hike because I simply won't crave the chicken and since this place is so chicken based I expected it to be the standout item."
"If I'm talking about how I need to bring my friends from down Tennessee way to a place before I've even tried the food, there's a good chance it's going to rock my taste buds and my sense of home.  Feed certainly didn't disappoint in either of those categories.More discerning transplanted Southerners will notice rather quickly that the place is a little more Texas chicken shack than it is Tennessee meat and two.  It's not easy, but there are clues. Note that the corn casserole is spicy, not sweet, complete with jalapeno peppers, and the chicken comes with tortillas, not a biscuit.  Still, it reminded me a lot of home.First of all, I LOVE the theme.  Nothing is more fun than confronting you with large quantities of near religious iconography of the very bird you are about to consume.  Okay, sure, they have burgers, and bbq, and veggie plates, but unless you're an herbivore, you should be here for the bird.  And Feed's bird does not disappoint.I've been there twice now and I've had the fried chicken twice.  Both times I polished off 1/2 a fricasse by myself, including the majority of my sides.  The first time, it was mac and cheese and fries, the second time, corn pudding and mashed potatoes.  I liked the fries quite a bit, the mac and cheese was good but not great, the corn pudding a bit bland, and the mashed potatoes good.  The gravy has a very strong flavor though, so if you're not a big fan, ask 'em to leave it off.As for the bird?  Well, let's just say it was damn close to ""slap yo mama good.""  And coming from a boy whose grandmother used to make homemade (yes, from chickens they kept in a coop out back) fried chicken at every gathering, regardless of how much else she'd already cooked, just because she knew how much he loved it, that's saying a lot.  Before anyone gets in an uproar, or Memaw, rest her soul, does a Dorothy Hamill in her grave, I can't say that it was as good as hers.  But it was damn good.  The skin is very lightly fried, so it has that perfect crisp without being too crunchy and thus eliminating a lot of the juice, and thus a lot of the flavor.  It accentuates the flavor of the bird and gives it a perfect texture, rather than overpowering your experience with CRRRRRUUUNNNNNNNNCH.  That's what real, un-mutated, Pamela Anderson doesn't speak out against it fried chicken should be like.Now for dessert (make sure you leave room for dessert) we have banana pudding.  Oh, they have other desserts, but unless you just can't stand bananas, if this is on the menu, get it.  It might have been the best banana pudding I've ever had.  Scratch that.  It WAS the best banana pudding I've ever had, and I've had a lot, considering it is my favorite dessert in all of the world.  Hopefully when you order it, one of the absolutely lovely and super friendly girls working the counter will flash you an unbeatable smile and then call you darlin' when she hands you the mountain of pudding and whipped cream goodness you are about to imbibe.Oh yeah, the staff?  Fantastic.  They're all super nice, they seem to get along well, they put off a wonderful vibe, and they're always smiling.  And the cooks, well, obviously the cooks are great too.  Tip 'em well, damnit, even if you are just carrying out.  And make sure to play ""That's Alright"" by Elvis on the free jukebox.  They all seemed to like it a lot."
"As an official West Town old-timer, I fondly remember the original Wishbone on Grand.  Back in the early 90's, the hipster community was so small that I would constantly recognize other customers from seeing them elsewhere. You know...""that's the guy who bikes up Damen smoking a pipe!""  That kind of recognize. This lovely little place shares a lot of the spirit, as well as culinary influences, of the original neighborhood Wishbone.  The sides are all southern comfort food: macaroni and cheese, collards, and fried okra, among others.  Despite the   vintage-y hen 'n' rooster decor, I got the pulled pork sandwich.  It was very good, and the meat, which was only slightly shredded but very tender, was barely moistened with barbecue sauce.  More sauce was added on top for flavoring.  It was a very careful preparation of a mundane sandwich, and it made it easier to eat without compromising flavor.  My goodness. I didn't think I was capable of raphsodizing so about pulled pork.  Well, it won't change your life, but it's a damn good sandwich.  The previous thumbs up about the mac and cheese are right on, as well."
"the chicken was juicy and tasted great.  the bbq pulled pork sandwich sweet, with tangy bbq sauce good but not anything to write home about. i had been looking forward to the sides.. but was left unsatisfied. theres a lot of choices , so maybe i tried an unflattering sampling. we had the mac and cheese, which was not cheesy or fresh or tasty. just carb flavor. normal fries, not salty at all, coleslaw which was good and the brussels sprouts which were crisp, and green , but sadly so much oil.  if they pulled back on that, it would have been a so much better. if there is a next time im going to try and go more home style with the mashed potatoes and gravy, maybe the corn pudding.  a plus is byob, so bring some booze."
"It's such a cute, quaint little place-- and the name just makes you want to eat . . . but I was greatly disheartened by the food. It was a shock to find out that such an acclaimed place could so thoroughly mess up basic, beloved comfort food. I almost wanted to cry. Anyway, I'm hoping it was just an off-day that my friend and I stopped in for some brunch. I'll give Feed another shot. Maybe lunch next time. Let's hope for the best . . ."
"BYOB. Awesome food. Down home cookin'. Corn casserole, mashed sweet potatoes...Quiet patio out back for outdoor dining. You and your sweetie can bring your own beer and stuff yourselves for $20. Free jukebox. Chicken paraphenalia galore. What more could a diner ask for? Probably not the place to bring a first date since it is ""down home"" but a cool neighborhood eatery."
"My girlfriend and I went here because I live close to it and we were too lazy to cook in. The march 1st snow storm kept us from going far. I have been there a couple times before. The decor is very cute. The price is right, and the people there are friendly. We both had a quarter chicken with dark meat, which was AWESOME. The meat was so moist and flavorful; if I were rating the chicken alone, I would give this place a perfect 5 stars. What I found disappointing were the sides. I am used to the sides being equally as great as the chicken, but I feel like things have been changed recently. I think the sides used to be served in cups that helped keep them warmer; sitting on the plate, although it might look better, cools it down quicker. You get two sides included with a quarter chicken, which is part of the great value of Feed, but I found the corn bread (only available occasionally, to my understanding) to be drier than average, and the mac n' cheese my girlfriend got was cold resulting in clumpy cheese. Her house salad wasn't anything special either. I have to say that my corn pudding, though it was luke warm, was still pretty good.I also want to add that there was a group of about 6 Chicago Police eating dinner while we were there. The only policewoman of the group carried a tray of food over to her police-friends' table and, just as she was about to put the tray down, it slipped out of her hand and she spilled her newly bought food onto one of the chairs next to her. It was hilarious!"
"Excellent. This is what Wishbone might have been had they got the big end of the bone. We stopped in for the first time last night. Got the 1/4 chicken, collards, mash, mac n cheese. There was absolutely no talking after the first bite because we were just absorbed with the food. The chicken is the best. The greens were out of this world.  Everything had tell-tale signs of being home made.Get there before 6:30 if you want to sit. We got there at about 6:15, then saw they were cash only. After digging through pockets, we realized we needed to hit an ATM. By the time we came back, the place was packed. But... it was soooo worth it. My stomache is grumbling right now for more."
