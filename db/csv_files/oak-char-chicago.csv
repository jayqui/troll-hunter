Oak + Char
"This place is amazing!!! Every single dish we ordered was DELICIOUS! See list below (we  really like to eat...):-MSG Chicken Wings-Warm Stracciatella-Baby Carrots-Ravlioli Doppio-Tandoori Octopus-Slow Roasted Pork Belly-Prime Double Cheeseburger-Smoke Roasted Chicken-Cider DoughnutsIf I had to pick my top three favorite things that you SHOULD NOT miss out on, they would be the MSG Chicken Wings, Slow Roasted Pork Belly, and the Prime Double Cheeseburger. Yum, yum, YUM. I'm still thinking about those wings...Also, I really enjoyed the interior of the venue - I thought it was really unique. The light fixtures are what caught my eye immediately when I entered. It looked like someone just threw a bunch of fabric on them and was like ""Welp...that looks good"". And it does look pretty awesome.I would love to go back to Oak & Char soon and try out their brunch menu!"
"I seriously think ppl that enjoyed eating here must have destroyed their taste buds.I live close by and the place looks super cute so suggested this place as a girls night dinner spot. I am filled with regretStarted with the MSG wings, which was the only edible thing on the menu, which was over fried and sweet in a nauseating way. Next we had the Smoke Roasted Chicken. The bird was completely dry and overcooked, they forgot to provide a saw to hack with the meal. Finally, saving the worst for last, the short rib. Let me first say, I have never tasted disgusting shortribs. And i mean truly disgusting. They had a mucusy texture, and when we asked the waiter about it, he described an ""elaborate"" process where the meat soaks in its own fat. It tasted like sweet tar and absolutely dry. What a waste of meat. Needless to say we did not attempt to finish our orders."
"Food was delicious and the company fantastic.  Everything was delicious. Burrata + hamburger - tomatoes and cheese were so fresh and delicious. Gnocchi Ravioli - tasted like fresh pasta. Short rib - no bone, like the pot roast you wished your mama could make Wings - they ate them like escaped convicts. $20 cocktail for 2 and we ordered 3...never tasted cinnamon so deliciously. All of the food was exceptionally pleasant. The portions very small plateish.  The cheeseburger pp like a Big Mac made by God. Very tender, tasty and amazing."
"Unfortunantely, I have to agree with a lot of other reviews. I really wanted to love this place but the food is really inconsistent. Very cute restaurant. Love the patio. Good service. + valet. Frozen sangria!  No waiting on a saturday night. However the food really missed the mark.The good was really good....mainly the wings. I'm not a wings person, but I highly recommend. So flavorful, spicy, sweet and some thing more.Everything else was mediocre. Pasta, squash blossoms, doughnut dessert.And for the bad. The tandoori octopus was inedible. So tough we barely touched it. I hope you have a better experience. Or maybe come here just for wings!"
"I really like this restaurant.  You feel good when you're there and the food is fantastic.  Make sure to ask your waiter for details on what you're ordering, that way there are no surprises!"
"The food: 3.5/5. The waitress told us that their portion sizes were comparable to small plates, but were actually quite large. We ordered a snack, an app and one entree for two. We started with wings, which were very impressive. Generally, I don't care for wings but these were a little sweet and perfectly crispy. For an app we got burrata, which was probably the most lackluster cheese I've had in my life, aside from string cheese. It came with a lot of tomatoes, which weren't ripe enough, and two small pieces of burrata on two slices of toast. Forgettable at best. As our entree we ordered smoked chicken, which came with a very delicious sauce. My biggest complain about the food is the saltiness, which was overpowering every dish. Their cocktails are on the sweeter side, so if you like dry drinks, you're better off ordering off the menu.The service: 5/5. The service was fast and attentive. No complains there.Overall: 4/5. A solid option downtown. I'd probably pick it as a great option for happy hour drinks and apps after work, rather than a full meal."
"I'll admit, I'm a sucker for hip and new modern american restaurants.  That being said, the wife and I ended up at Oak + Char on a Friday night.  At first glance I really liked the vibe inside.  It was busy and the wood accents all over gave it a rustic but still modern feel. Not to mention the light fixtures looked like someone threw some bedsheets on them.  I could see that getting a love/hate response.As far as their menu, most of their items are meant to be shared.  I find that to be a cool trend at a lot of places around the city lately.  We unintentionally started with the wontons as a food runner dropped it off at our plate since they made extra.  The chili honey on the plate made them interesting but not sure if I'd get them again.  I also tried the salt baked beets.  I feel like I'm a sucker for beets, if they're on the menu they are going to be on my plate.  In this case they were some of the better ones I've had.  They came with hazelnuts and these little rye bread crisps.  It reminded me of picking the rye crisps out of the bags of Gardettos.  If you're looking to get some vegetables that you wouldn't normally get I'd recommend them.We got the burger and crab legs as our mains.  My burger was solid all round, cooked well and had this sauce that I couldn't quite put my finger on but it was almost like a thousand island.  I also snuck some of those onion rings into the burger because why not?  The crab legs though were the star, I really wish I had ordered a full plate to myself.  I imagined you would get a tiny portion but for getting king crab in River North it was well worth it.  They even split them in half for you so getting the meat out was a breeze.  Not to mention the crispy rice and coconut sauce.  It was definitely the winner of the night.  Overall I thought Oak +Char is definitely worth a visit.  It's not going to blow you away but everything from the food to the service to the ambaince made for a great night out."
"Oak+Char+Me 4everAmbiance & Theme: * anchored in urban-loft style, yet softly transcendent* a cloud ride to some tasty destinations, * attentive and knowledgeable service. I appreciate the nod to Chicago's past (char/The Great Fire) and present (wood from neighborhoods & steel to mimic the L.) Check their ""about"" section on their website for other details. Menu: changes very often, depending on season, availability and customer feedback. Last month, we'd had the warm burrata but I wasn't a huge fan (the oiliness of the tomato base) but it turns out that it's already being prepared with a different approach. Similarly, I'd 4ever thought I could love getting the tandoori octopus with eggplant however it's now offered with in-season rancho gordo beans. Today, I was in for lunch (L&D menus differ) and I had ""The Cuban"" which was tasty however I did encounter more fat in the prosciutto cotto than I'd have liked as it wasn't edible. Overall, I'd have loved more pork in the sandwich as well. The sandwich was good but unlikely I'd order it again. They did a wonderful salad instead of chips which pleased me so I could enjoy an order of the beef fat onion rings. Lunch, coffee & cocktails or dinner - I've enjoyed all three. Good for a group or a nice bite on your own...I especially enjoy lunch and then lingering with a coffee and free wi-fi.Five stars for service and atmosphere and 3.5-4 for the food. The drink list is accommodating - extensive whiskey selection. TVs nicely situated above the bar. I'll give it 4ever stars overall."
"I came in with low expectations tbh due to a few mixed reviews, but left extremely happy and pleased w the decision to come here! (Hay it's a hard choice when ur only visiting Chi for a few!!)They were out of the msg wings and I was sure that the evening was ruined lol. But far from it. We tried the saffron tail pepper carbonara with lamb neck merguez- absolutely amazing.  Then onto the tandoori octopus, which was good (not great tho).  Next the Korean braised beef shortrib- melts in your mouth- whatever you do, you must order this! Also another must order is the double prime cheeseburger with beef fat onion rings. Omg. I have no words. And of course dessert- the cider doughnuts were good, but the maple foie syrup and chai milk jam that came with it- SO good. Lastly I must give a s/o to our awesome and super funny server Jerrod. It was honestly so fun talking to him and he made our night even more great! Amazing service, nice ambiance, awesome food. Will definitely be back!"
"WTF? I didn't order Salmon!That's what my MIND said, but me MOUF was smart enough to pose that in a form of a question.  Is this not Salmon???Yes, me dearies... They've gone and fished out a trout that LOOKS a helluva lot like a chunk of sexy Salmon with a hardened caviar crust, but it's skin. And it's really small farm oriented. And it is fucking DELICIOUS. This beaut was flanked by fresh, red beet quarters, pickled lemon and a smear of sour cream?Well it all started when I sat down at GT Fish & Oyster's bar a few minutes before lunch opening but a crying baby quickly had that idea punted until a return visit.  If you're familiar with this west part of River North, it gets all skank-licious easily with the likes of Hooter's and such BUT luckily Yelp helped me find the spot that replaced Graham Elliot.  Tom Mendoza dazzled me at the door with a big, bright smile that almost seemed glistening Speed Racer-esque... and though I was the only one there, we eventually got things off to a very nice start.Oak + Char was out of the Pinot Gris I selected, but that worked to my advantage because the Sauvignon Blanc is a tight little, citrusy fabulous drinkable velvet that I hope to find in a bottle shop soon. Chateau De La Roche, Sauvignon Blanc, Loire Valley, France, 2013My server was quite attentive, the atmosphere was a great mix of natural sunlight and dark, curious bow-ties for the lighting and dark, chocolate vevl-eather booths. My like it!"
Went back for brunch- was just so-so... Had the mushroom goat cheese scramble which sounded good but needed flavor ( including salt)... We got a round of donuts to share which were yum and definitely the saving grace for me.
Love this place. Great Service and delicious food. I'm addicted to their wings.
Love this place. Ate and drank during a business function on Wednesday night. Decent wine list. The prime rib and warm crab legs were excellent. So many appetizers that I cannot distinguish them anymore. Service was awesome.
"We came here on a Sat night with OpenTable reservations. They seated us immediately and we sat close to the bar. As far as interior goes, tables by the bar were high top and ambiance was kind of a modern dark paneling with subtle creamy deco and sort of a romantically trendy feel throughout. Service was very good. Personable, friendly. They have a pretty good drink menu and had a few notable whisky options. Food was good and tasty. Portion sizes were good. We had a meat dish w a bone marrow - both food and savory. Though while this bone marrow was definitely larger, the one I had at Longman and Eagles was more memorable. Oak and Char is closer though. Parking is metered streets mostly at $4/hour with lots nearby. Parking north of Chicago Ave and west of Orleans is mostly free, but that'll be at least 3+ block walk away.I liked this place. I would definitely come back and recommend trying it out if you haven't been! It can sometimes fill up fast so make sure you get your reservations in."
"Went to Oak + Char for dinner on a weeknight. Reservation was made a week prior, to seamless results.Oak + Char specializes in American cuisine with a midwestern twist. In my experience, they fulfilled their mission! The crispy broccoli was crisp, the gochujang wings tasty, the gnocchi rightfully cheesy. They have rows and rows of what I believe are fluffy, clothed chandeliers, which add a warm touch to an otherwise understated decor (pictured). Each table provides ample space without forgoing intimacy. The restrooms are very clean as well.We had a great time at dinner. Our helpful server gave pertinent advice on the menu and drinks. 4 stars."
"Great place for a group dinner.I didn't have anything that was out of this world, but the place as a whole deserves four stars. Service and ambiance were superb.As a group of six, we got to try plenty. What stood out most was the Basil Gnocchi, Korean Short Rib, and the Beef Tartare.  Everything was good, although the burger looks a lot better than it is.I will say we never ordered anything off the Chef's Board menu which sounded fantastic."
My wife and I came here to treat our good friends to a celebratory dinner for their recent engagement. The wifey discovered the new restaurant on a food blog. We started off with the pork trotter spring rolls and ravioli doppio which were both absolutely delicious. The spring rolls were perfectly crispy and the ravioli was al dente. This was followed by msg wings which was bomb bomb and reminded me of Bon Bon chicken in nyc. So yummy. This was followed by cold smoked oysters which my preggo wife appreciated since she cannot have raw oysters until the baby arrives. Beef tartare was great and uniquely served with chips. The only miss of the night was the octopus that felt burnt and may have been cooked from frozen. The highlight of the meal was the goat strozzapreti which was out of this world fresh. We ended the meal with the lamb sweetbreads which we pleasantly discovered came with black pudding that we have missed from when we lived in London.The beer and drinks menu was great. The restaurant when we arrived was not overly crowded and the beginning of our meal we almost felt like the service was too attentive but that happens at restaurants with great service that are not yet full for the evening. When we left the restaurant was much busier.
"I went here with my boyfriend last night to celebrate my birthday, and I couldn't be more pleased with the choice. The atmosphere in the restaurant was modern yet romantic. We also saw that they have a cute patio seating area, and a cool private room which would be great for groups. We started with the MSG wings which were delicious. The sauce was amazing, and the wings were topped with green onion and cilantro which added a great note of freshness. That was quickly followed by the beef tartare served with homemade salt and pepper potato chips. The addition of the potato chips was fun and made the dish interesting.  We also tried the charred burrata with green harissa  and homemade naan. This was so good, the warm burrata was gooey and cheesy  and the harissa added a peppery note that was not too spicy. Some other favorites were the ravioli doppio, and the fish tail carbonara. Both pasta dishes were very tasty and very well prepared. I especially recommend the ravioli. For our last dish we ordered off the ""large"" plate menu and we selected the fjord trout served with creamed nettles and sunflower seed risotto. The trout itself was amazing. Our waiter informed us that the fish was sushi grade and the chef recommended that it be cooked medium rare. We accepted the suggestion and the fish was cooked perfectly. The skin was so crispy and just the right amount of salty. My only possible complaint (and it's so small) was with the creamed nettles just weren't very good and were also a little cold. Other minor issue was that although this was labeled as a large plate, it was not actually much larger than the small plates but it was twice as expensive. We ended the dinner with the chocolate pot de crème with pistachio cookies, which was a great little dessert especially when you dipped the cookies in the chocolate. Overall a great dining experience and not too expensive. We got all of that plus two cocktails (which were great) and one beer for around $150 (before tip). I am a huge fan of the shared small plate experience and every dish that we tried was fantastic. I'd definitely go back!"
All in all it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be but not awful either.  Average! Food & drink were ok. Need tartare was a little bland but like the salt & pepper chips that came with it. Frankly I think the beef tartare at Sienna Tavern is better.  Ramp & potato salad didn't have many ramps in it and the ones that were there were the size of green onions. My biggest complaint was on the service. Manly because it was SUPER slow. Took 10 minutes for server to come over and say hi.  Another 10 minutes before he was back to take drink order. Almost 20 minutes before we got drinks.  If you don't have all night to kill on dinner you might consider somewhere else.
"Do not miss out on this gem!  From the service to the food to the atmosphere, this place is a 10.I've been here a few times and I've loved each  experience.  The short ribs are incredible, and i highly recommend the chicken wings.  Honestly i have yet to try a dish i didn't enjoy.The service is impeccable and I'm always impressed when servers are well educated about beer and liquor.  They offer a hearty wine and spirits list and a great menu of cocktails."
"We came here for our latest supper club and had a wonderful time. Although, I have to say, the lighting fixtures/cloth were a bit strange. We decided to order a few things and share. Everything, I thought, was tasty!1. Wings - they were super tasty!2. Burrata - this was very interesting and not what I had expected, but good!3. Ravioli doppio - eh, didnt necessarily stand out.4. mussels - very good, broth was super tasty!Our waiter was great, and I did love the atmosphere, but with so many restaurants in Chicago - Im not sure this one stuck out ALL that much. If you're in the area, definitely check them out for maybe a snack/small bite and a drink."
"Pretty good! I don't think I was blown away by anything but the interior decorations are really nice...Probably a nice spot for a date! I came with a friend and we tried the beed tartare, wings and burger. I would say the wings were the best out of the bunch."
"Cool space, pretty good food, however it sort of runs together with a lot other restaurants in the area. The place has a great vibe and was definitely packed on the Friday night we were there, so if nothing less, it is a good weekend dinner destination.I don't have many complaints, but I don't have a ton of praise either. We enjoyed the wings the most out of everything we ordered, so I would recommend getting those. The service was perfectly fine, and prices matched my expectation for that area.I would go again, but only by someone else's invitation."
"Lovely new restaurant in the old Graham Elliot space. Shared plate style is great for groups-I'm a big fan of trying as many dishes as possible.Likes:-Jefferson Park Sour-any cocktail with egg whites and Becherovka is going to get me excited, and this one definitely delivered-MSG Wings (not what you think)-Duck Fat Onion Rings-Beef Tartare (one of my favorites)-Scallop special (my other favorite)-Beef Shortrib (lots of flavor, fork-tender)-Coconut Mussels (very tasty broth and loved the bacon samba)Misses:-Pork Collar...we were super excited about this dish but it ended up being a major letdown. The meat was tough and there was quite a bit of chewy fat that made it really difficult to eat, a sad end to an otherwise delicious meal.Overall we had a great dinner with friends and I'd definitely love to return."
"Really enjoyed this place!! Good drinks, good food, good service, good ambiance. Husband and I had the beef tartare, msg wings, Korean braised beef short rib, and pickle brined pork collar. The wings and beef tartare were really good! Pork collar was also very tasty, a few pieces kind of chewy, but good dish overall. The braised short rib had good flavor, but was overcooked so on the dry side. I tried a cocktail named the Jillian and I loved it! Wish I knew how to make it at home."
"The wings are fire. Some of the best in Chicago. I'm also a big burger connoisseur, so I loveddddddd the burger here. Sort of pricey but it's Chicago so most of it is! Cool ambiance also."
"Came here last night for dinner. Arrived early and got seated right away. Our server was impossible to understand and the 10 substitutions (due to out of stock ingredients) was confusing.Food menu was small & easy to choose from. We started with the fennel salad which was bland & octopus which was very tasty but over salted.For our main course we tried the infamous Korean style short ribs. Yes they melted in your mouth but again super salted almost to the point that one bite left a sting on my tongue. The trout dish was no different.I'm a smoker so, if it tastes too salty .... It must be overboard. Gosh, I wish this was as good as the reviews but I simply cannot agree."
"Oak + Char came highly recommended by a close friend. Maybe it was an off-night, but I would have to say, aside from the cocktails and company, I was disappointed. The main issue was the inconsistency of the temperature's dishes. In a place commanding a rather high price point, this seems unacceptable to me. Additionally, it's advertised as a 'tapas style' place where dishes come out when ready, which seems to contradict the issue with temperature. If it was hot and ready, why was there a lag in coming to my table? If Little Caesar's can do it, surely Oak + Char can too.We started with the Charred Burrata which was delicious. Unfortunately the Ravioli Doppio was lukewarm at best, which detracted from what likely would have been a tasty dish. The Ramps a la Planxa was also disappointing, albeit hot. It was essentially a large bowl of potatoes for 11 bucks. Our main course, the Wood Grilled Pork Collar, which was tender and full of flavor, was ruined by it's cool temperature and the smoked clams and farro that accompanied it were actually cold. Whether an issue with the chef or the runners, to have food temperature cloud what potentially could have been an enjoyable eating experience, is unacceptable. No way I'm giving this place another shot, but from reading the other reviews, sounds like an off night."
"I went there for lunch in the weekday and there was only a few table. The decor and ambiance can be described as ""oak and char"" with wooden table and wood decor on the wall. For 2 people, we ordered the apple pomegranate salad (with microgreens ) which is presented nicely and refreshing. We really enjoyed the chicken panini with apple butter, melted cheese, and house bacon. It was crispy and there was a tad of sweetness to the panini, Thanks to the apple butter. The Cuban was okay and thought that the horseradish sauce was too overpowering. I ordered the cotton cake which was unavailable  and the chef offered to substitute with the cider doughnut. The doughnut was freshly made and dipped with apple sauce?   Unfortunately the lunch menu was limited and the msg chicken wings was not available to order. Our waiter was very attentive and I had a good experiene."
"Overall: Trendy place that's great for drinks and sharing foodLikes:- Unique, modern, and trendy atmosphere- Innovative menu options - interesting spins on traditional dishes and cocktails- We got the mussels, short rib, and beet salad - everything was solid and flavorful- Value of dishes - quality and quantity - seemed totally reasonable given neighborhoodGripes:- I told them I was gluten free - they knew which items could be made gluten free, but when they brought out dishes they had not been modified (eg bringing out barley with short rib without separating onto another plate)"
"I had the Cuban. It was very straight forward and classic and tasted fine. However, it was a little too boring for my taste, bring something new to the table."
"I read about this recently opened restaurant on Eater Chicago, and decided it would be a great spot to try out for my husband's birthday dinner on a weekend visit to Chicago. I'm very happy we did, because it turned out to be one of the highlights of a weekend filled with plenty of other food and drink. We were greeted in the entryway by two very friendly hosts who took our coats and took us to our table, even though we were a bit early for our reservation. Although reactions seem to be mixed, I myself really enjoyed the decor and in particular the pillowy lighting. In a world where Edison bulbs abound, it was nice to see something different. Oak + Char recently got their liquor license and there is no shortage of options in any category, but we decided to go with the Jordo (Jim Beam Black, Averna, Tawny Port, Becherovka) and Dolly (Rittenhouse Rye, Campari, Maple, Lemon, Egg White, Cucumber, Salt) cocktails. Both were complex, nicely balanced cocktails that we enjoyed throughout our meal. The menu is set up in several sections - snacks, small plates, large plates, and chef's boards. After reading other reviews where parties seemed to order several plates to share across the categories, we decided to do the same, ordering 4 dishes total. Our waitress asked if she could course them out for us, which we really enjoyed as it elongated the meal and allowed us to taste them in the order that made most sense. From the snacks, we ordered the burrata and the pork spring rolls, both of which were very nice small plates to start the meal. It's hard to mess up burrata, but we really enjoyed the eggplant sauce it was paired with, and also liked the crispy texture of the spring rolls and the tahini sauce they were paired with. From the small plates, we ordered the ravioli doppio, which had a celery root puree filling on one side and a maitake mushroom filling on the other side. Impressive technique, a unique approach to ravioli, and both sides were delicious! We also ordered the beef tartare from the small plates - having never had tartare before, we were a little hesitant, but this actually ended up being my favorite dish. The dish was extremely fresh and I loved the flavor from the accompanying uni aioli, mustard seed, pine nuts, and pickled pears. I felt that the 4 dishes between the two of us were filling but not overwhelming. Next time we go, I'd love to order a chef's board, as we saw a few come out that looked wonderful.For dessert, I highly recommend the cider doughnuts with the maple foie syrup. Again, was a little hesitant going in, but we loved the sweet-savory combo that this dessert delivered. Very happy we were able to try this new spot during our visit, and hoping it succeeds so that we can head back there again next time!"
"My dinner could consist entirely of charred burrata, eggplant muhammara and naan, and I'd be satisfied. Waiters suggest you ""smush"" the muhammara - a sweet and subtly spicy eggplant and red pepper spread - into the burrata and then slather it onto the warm chewy naan. This is delicious advice, though I don't know that there's a wrong way to enjoy this dish.Despite my love for the charred, almost smoky burrata, I did manage to diversify my plate. Chewy cheesy arancini. A crisp apple-pomegranate salad. Tandoori octopus (that wasn't the least bit tough). Luscious ravioli doppio. Each dish lent different flavors, textures and techniques, creating a meal that was diverse, yet unified by its Mediterranean influence. Luckily, plates are designed for sharing, so you don't have to choose just one, either."
Made a yelp-account exclusively to post a review for this restaurant. Sensational food.Borderline best asparagus I've ever had.
"Was it our server?  The night we were here?  What we ordered?  Not sure but based on the reviews on Yelp I thought we were in for a real treat at this newest addition to River North.But what we got was a hodge podge of experiences some good (most of the food) and some not so good (like the spotty service and being told they were out of things)So let's start with the positives.  The space is lovely.  We all commented on how interesting it was with the billowy light fixtures contrasting with the rough hewn wood that is all through this place.  We opted to sit at the high tops that were a little closer to the bar as we were looking for a little energy that even on a Friday night this place seemed to be lacking.Given we had a sizeable group, we had a chance to try a range of the food.  The winners seemed to be the apple pomegranate salad, the crispy broccoli, the pecorino arancini, and the grilled octopus.  The losers were the double cheeseburger (tasted like a white castle burger stewed in onions with a cheese whiz type sauce) and the acorn squash (felt like it should have been warm).  Now I understand that this place is meant for shareable plates, but the plates came out so randomly for our group that we didn't know what was what.  We ordered two orders of the salad and the octopus and one order came up at a time.  So some of the table was eating and the others were not   Maybe this concept only works if you are sharing food?  And our table wanted their own due to some dietary restrictions.  And because they use food runners instead of the server bringing the food, it just got tossed on the table.  And another pet peeve of mine is that if an order comes with 4 things and there are 5 people at the table, throw in a 5th!  We ordered the cider donuts to share at the end, asked how many were in the order, were told 4-5 and then 4 came out.  Sheesh!  Seems to be that they are suffering from some of what I call ""new restaurant blues"".Another symptom of that is when we went to order the wine.  The bottle of wine, that the server recommended, they were out of.  As was our second choice.  So we ended up going with wines by the glass.  Know if you go that route that wines by the glass are served in stemless glassware.  If you want a decent glass you need to order the bottle.  When one in our group asked for a stemmed glass (we saw them at the next table), we were told there were ""none clean right now"".  And we ended up sending back one glass of wine as it was about a 3 oz pour.  They immediately rectified it but it was just one more hiccup in our evening.All in all, we walked away a little puzzled as to what this place was trying to be.  We loved the space.  Most of the food, had it come up more systematically was pretty good.  But there was just something off on the night we were there.Maybe I'll give it another go in a few months to see if they have worked the kinks out.  And that's more generous than the group I brought who basically shook their heads surprised that I had suggested this place to begin with."
"I dined here on Sunday night and despite the fact that the restaurant was fairly empty, I really enjoyed the ambiance. We ordered the wings which were perfectly crispy with a tangy sauce. The octopus was tender and paired with a charred eggplant salad, went well together. The raviolis had capers and hazelnuts on top which was a surprisingly yummy combination and gave a bit of texture. We had the mussels for the main dish with a coconut milk sauce and naan, definitely different but I would order again! Only complaint was that the food came out room temperature (besides the wings) and since the restaurant was so empty we thought it would come out hot off the grill."
"We went to Oak + Char on a Thursday night and we had extraordinary service from everyone in the restaurant. It wasn't slammed, but steady. The vibe was relaxed and the ambiance of the restaurant was really cool. We ordered several things to share:  Chef's Special Charcuterie Board and Shishitos to begin, followed by Tandoori Octopus and Beef Tartare, and ended with the Saffron Roman Roman Gnocchi. The octopus was prepared perfectly and probably my favorite dish, although all were quite good. We also splurged for dessert and ordered the tcho chocolate pot de creme and I about fell out of my chair!  Don't forget to try the Margot dessert cocktail if you're not feeling actual dessert. It's an adult frostie and so tasty! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and look forward to visiting again."
"I really wanted to love this place.  Walking in on a bustling Friday night, I thought this would be a regular spot for me.  However, the food just didn't hit the spot.  - Pecorino Arancini - your standard arancini.  prepared well but felt the sauce could've used a kick.- Beef Tartare - below average.  I found the meat to be rather dry and bland.- Rye Aged Duck - my least favorite.  the meat was so tough and chewy, I could barely eat this dish.- Ravioli Doppio - my favorite dish of the night.  wish this was served first.- Kicthen Coffee - we ordered a 6-pack for the kitchen and were escorted by our impatient waiter to meet the staff.  everyone was incredibly friendly and the kitchen was pretty much untouched since the Graham Elliot days.I will not be back for the food, however, I would come back for drinks and the scene -- bar area was packed up until midnight."
"What a great new place in River North!!! In the old Graham Elliot space, Oak + Char really embodies the natural elements in the ambiance.  People were in sweaters or suits.  Any attire seemed to be ok!   Its like a gastro pub space, but they do not have their liquor license yet.  All small plates that are grouped by size.  Food was fast, innovative and fresh! Very reasonablly priced too! We had: Charred burrata, eggplant muhammara, naan -- we are still thinking about it! Pecorino arancini, braised rapini, red pepper vinaigrette -  order came w/ 4 - yumBeef tartare, uni aioli, smoked pine nuts, pickled pears - the only one that did not wow us...Cold smoked oysters, pickled lemon, piparras, butter crackers - very good Ravioli doppio, celery root, maitake, hazelnut, truffle fondue - 4 pcs and YUMCrispy broccoli, white anchovy, parsnip aioli, calabrian chili - will make you love broccoli...perfect crunch and not too fried! Skate schnitzel, cauliflower remoulade, benton's country ham - perfectly prepared and delishCan't wait to return. Great service, robust flavors, warm setting...what's not to like?! Only one item was sub par otherwise we were soooo please with Oak + Char and incredibly happy they are in our neighborhood!"
"We live about three blocks from Oak and Char, but had not tried it until last night.  We were a little skeptical of the dinner menu because it is not our usual fare.  We stopped by after all the rain last night and snagged a table on the patio.  The patio is really nice on a tree lined street where many of the trees block the beating sun from you.We started with a Pinot Gris and I had a Lucy Goosey - which is based on the owner's (or chef?) daughter.  Both drinks were really good and refreshing on a summer night, and my husband and I ended up ordering two.We started with the MSG Wings - which is as good (if not better) has everyone writes.  The flavors and sauce were a good combination for the six or seven large wings that you get.  We then had the Octopus - which was also good, but not our favorite.  We've gotten on a octopus kick at most restaurants and this one at Oak and Char had more of an octopus flavor than we liked.  I then had the Double Cheeseburger and my husband had the Tempura Soft Shell Crab.  The cheeseburger was delicious.  My fear was how large it would be, but it was two smaller patties and the bun was a nice size.  Everything about the burger was good - and my husband who also had several bites - agreed.  It came with chips, but I only wish there was a sauce to dip the chips in.  My husband liked the Crab as well - it was just a different experience with the tempura.We will definitely be back to Oak and Char to try their other menu items!"
"Great drinks, nice wine list, and generally very good food.  I'm definitely a fan.I have to admit that I've been here 3 times already in the 2 months or so since they opened so I think that says something.  My first visit with a friend was awesome (despite the lack of liquor license), then a large group from work was okay but I didn't love the food as much and made the mistake of ordering Skate Schnitzel for my main dish which wasn't at all exciting.I like the atmosphere despite the strange light fixture covers, and the service has been pretty good on each occasion along with good food & drink.  I hope they stick around, this is a nice new resident in the old Graham Elliott space."
"I dined here the other night with a friend. I think the ambiance and service were both great. The waitress explained the menu in detail, was attentive and tried to assist to the best of her ability with the below:The reason I give 3 stars is because everything we ordered (while all good flavor alone) came drenched in a bed of sauce that wasn't necessarily described that way (or at all) on the menu. The broccoli was great-but was soaked in a bed of white aioli. The wings were great-but drenched in some sort of white yogurt sauce so I could only eat one that wasn't full of the sauce. The burger (after being reassured there were no added sauces & asked for pickles on the side) came out with some sort of butter all over the top bun and some sort of horseradish aioli mixture all over the bottom bun as well as pickles inside the burger. The waitress had told us our burger was taking longer because she already had intercepted it and asked them to correct it...the 2nd time it came out the same. It was getting late and my group was getting irritated so I just asked for a new bun.As someone who enjoys eating food without a ton of added/unnecessary sauces, it would be helpful if these were listed with each item in detail or put in a cup on the side so they don't infringe on what someone believes to be ordering."
"It's a bit of a hike from the loop but the service was pretty quick so it made it doable for a Friday lunch. This is in the old Graham Elliot space. It looks very similar- lots of hard wood. Interesting high chairs and kind of an odd ceiling design. For food, we split the burrata salad. This was delicious as most burrata's are - though it didn't necessarily need it I wish it had been served with little toasts. But maybe because it was technically a salad it didn't qualify for toasts. I had the apple upland cress salad. This was great and didn't feel toooo unhealthy :) minus the cheese and the grains. My friend had the roasted acorn squash salad. Which was good, a bit heartier than mine with the squash/goat cheese combo. My third friend had the fancy grilled cheese. It looked great but not as good as croque madame that I saw being delivered to another table. Would go back and try them for dinner too! Thumbs up."
"Four of us dined at Oak&Char for dinner.  None of us had been there before.  The decor is sort of strange.  I'm not sure what is going on with the massive white blanket-looking things.  However having the large window that can be opened when it is nice out is a bonus.  The bathroom was also sort of an issue.  There are only two stalls and one of them didn't lock.  My friend had to put the mobile toilet paper holder in front of the door to use it.  Also the sinks are not sensor, while they appear to be.  I literally couldn't figure out how to use it (fortunately I had hand sanitizer in my purse).  My friend advised there is a lever underneath.  Overall vibe is not great.  Also, on the way out, there is a clear door that looks like you're walking through a doorway but there is glass.  I literally ran into it.  One bright spot was our server, who was outstanding.Onto the food...there were some hits and some misses.  They had a special pastrami dish that was underwhelming.  The burrata was actually very good.  It is burrata but over some green salsa (not spicy but tasty) that you mix together and the burrata sort of melts into the salsa.  Excellent idea.  We also tried the wings, which were decent.  The ramps were disappointing.  They aren't like whole ramps that you're used to getting charred, which is what I was hoping for.  In fact, most of the dish consisted of bland potatoes with small pieces of ramps.  The beef tartare was okay but nothing special.  I was instructed to get the tandoori octopus and that was very good.  We tried the pork collar as well, which was okay.  Overall the food to me was average other than the burrata and the octopus.  I'll definitely try again and hope that some of the creative dishes are as tasty as they are creative."
"Came here with a group of six for brunch. The brunch selection wasn't huge, but there was a nice variety. The coffee was great, and the other brunch beverage selections looked good, too. Ordered the donuts and crumpets to start, which were both what we all expected. I had asked before about the size of the salad in terms of whether I'd need to order something else--was told it was a pretty large portion. This was not the case. Was a tiny side salad! It was okay, but overpriced in my opinion for the portion and quality. Next time, I hope to try the pancakes, as someone else in our group ordered them and they were fantastic. The breakfast potatoes that come with a lot of the dishes and that you can order on the side were also solid. Would be interested to return to try this place for dinner. I think the ambiance would be nice for a dinner."
"Not sure I understand all of the positive reviews. Enjoyed sitting out on the patio for lunch but the food and service were not great. Everything was so over salted to the point of needing to drink a gallon of water afterwards. Started with the Alicia cocktail which was good but tasted like fruit punch with minimal alcohol. When the waiter asked, I kindly mentioned it and he just shrugged. The wings and ham hoc soup had good flavor but loads of salt. Similar but better wings can be found at Mott St or Parachute. The Cuban and homemade chips were well executed. The shot rib was well cooked but could only eat a 1/4 before surrendering to salt. The barley on the other hand was bland which I needed, but served over oil which made it heavy. The dish was missing balance.There was no point mentioning the salt to the waiter since he probably wouldn't have done anything about it. The restaurant has potential but had too many misses and was not worth $80 for lunch."
"Simple sounding but boldly flavoured food, excellent service, very highly recommended!"
Love this place! From the decor to the yummy plates...im hooked! Heard great things about this place so got a few friends together and finally tried it.
"My friend Nichole recommended this place and it did not disappoint! The ambiance and atmosphere was great; low key and relaxed. They had a great wine and cocktail selection. I recommend getting a variety of dishes to share with the table, tapas style. We started off with some ""snacks"" including the pecorino arancini, the charred burrata, the MSG chicken wings and the pork trotter spring rolls..(we were hungry). The portions were petite but the flavors were all so rich that it ended up being the perfect amount of food. The chicken wings were way better that we expected! Paired with a great creamy cilantro sauce. All were very good.For ""small plates"" we tried the ravioli doppio. It had a nutty flavor, pretty good. We really wanted to try the goat strozzapreti but they were 86'd so that gives us something new to try the next we go in! For entrees we got the double cheeseburger.. It was good but not necessarily anything special and the cider brined pork collar with turnips, chorizo and fermented apples. The flavoring of this dish was great!! Definitely recommend it. Overall this new spot is definitely on my list of favorites in the area!"
"I really like this place.I'm vegetarian and I chose here for two reasons, 1, they had food I could actually eat that wasn't just salad and 2, the romantic lighting. It's actually really dark, that's why I chose it ;). I didn't think it appropriate to take pictures because a flash would've looked light lightening in the night sky in this place. Ok so the food, I had the: --charred burrata, eggplant muhammara, naanLol the only thing here I understood was eggplant so I didn't actually know what I was getting, I just knew it was vegetarian *with cheese*. It was like an eggplant and cheese dip/spread and pita bread. The spread was really good, I was surprised. I'd give it a 9 easily. Not to jump around, but I was asking the waiter about the items and he stressed that the majority of the items were small snack like items and there's only 6 actual entrees *none of which are vegetarian*. So snack.. I'm thinking it's like a little small bite of food. I WAS STUFFED from eating just the eggplant, like seriously ""oh my Yoda we just got here and I can't eat anything else"" stuffed and I hadn't eaten anything really all day. I had two PIECES of pineapple at school that morning and a small cup of coffee. So, you can easily be satisfied from the ""small snack"" items. As a matter of fact, lets say they give you 8 pieces of the pita *I didn't  count* I could only eat like 4, I gave 2 to my fiancé and took the other 2 home because it was so good I didn't want to waste it. I planned on trying two things, so the second item I ordered was the: --crispy broccoli, white anchovy *made with cauliflower for me*, parsnip aioli, calabrian chili This was good too, except vinegar seemed to collect in the middle of the plate and I hate strong vinegar-y tastes so I avoided that middle section like the plague. I honestly could only eat like two pieces of this, one piece of broccoli and one piece of cauliflower *subbed for the anchovy*. I was so stuffed, but I just wanted to try it *being a food lightweight is so lame*. Given that I was stuffed, and it still tasted good, it had to have been really good lol. My fiancé had the:--msg chicken wings (maple+sherry+gochujang chili)I asked him what would he rate it, and he gave it a 6 out of 10 so I'm not sure it's as delicious as what everyone claims. I mean really, with chicken wings, the money is in the sauce..I had the waiter bring me a side of the sauce because I wanted to see what it tasted like given I've never had Korean gochujang and I heard it was really spicy. The sauce wasn't spicy at all :( it was sweet. It kind of had a sweet oaky flavor..with like a low sodium soy sauce taste. I give the sauce a 6 too and the sauce makes the wings... so I trust his rating. He also had the:--apple pomegranate salad, pumpernickel, aged cheddar, walnutsNow this WAS actually small lol. I tried a bite of his, it was good. Flavors were well rounded. It was the perfect little salad. I'd give this salad a 10. We both could only just barely eat our food so there were two more items we have to go back and try. The drinks.In my opinion, it is uncouth to get sloppy drunk at a restaurant like this... but I had no idea...We both had the:--Alicia - Sipsmith Sloe Gin, Grapefruit, Lemon, Simple, Bitters, Soda and--Mandy - Laird's Bonded Applejack, House-Made Grenadine, LimeThat second drink was my fault. The Alicia didn't seem to have any alcohol in it and I was like ""man what is this?! I need something stronger!"" Completely ignoring that drunkard look in my fiancé's eyes... He only ordered the second drink because he didn't want me to one up him.By the time we finished the Mandy...good lord... I don't think I've ever been that drunk in my life. No, I'm sure I've never been that drunk in my life. I couldn't even walk. I don't think of myself as someone that has like a low tolerance or anything so I was really surprised.Overall, we had a nice time. I really like this place and we'll be coming back soon for the ravioli and the smoked chicken.I'd like to add, the couple next to us had this really cool fish thing! It looked so awesome I wanted to sneak and take a picture of it. It looked like if you grabbed a fish out of the ocean and deep fried it on the spot. It was the fjord trout. I don't know how it tasted, but it looked super cool. They ate it really fast, not to be nosy, but they had like 6 other plates before that so given that they ate it in less than 10 minutes I'm guessing it was tasty."
"Small menu that's all farm to table. Excellent cocktails and beer selection. I have been for lunch a half dozen times and loved every soup, salad and sandwich I've tried. Check it out!"
Wonderful dinning experience. A friendly face from the time we walked in the door until we walked out. Customer service was dead on. We had six plates and dessert for 3 people. Right amount of food & everything was delicious. The king crab dish and short ribs were outstanding.
"As someone who keeps up with the restaurant scene in Chicago, I was kind of curious to see what it was like. I had heard it was ""Modern Midwestern"" and not being a huge fan of most American food, I still came here having read many strong reviews.The decor is pretty nice - dark and nice with some cool re purposed things in here. Our server (I forgot her name) was really good. Fun, knowledgeable and passionate. I'd say throughout the experience we had strong service.Now onto the food. It was described as modern midwestern, but with a global flare to it. I can go with that. A lot of the plates here are the more small to medium sized shareable family style/tapas type. We had the shishitos, Burrata, MSG Chicken Wings, tandoori octopus, beef tartare, ravioli, 32 oz bone in ribeye, and some cider donuts. Everything was good here - not a bad spot at all. I think we all agree that the octopus was the weakest dish, but it was still pretty good. The burrata was awesome (though the naan could use a little work) as was the ribeye. I really liked the sauce on the chicken wings and how they were cooked. The beef tartare was really good and it made a believer out of someone who was always afraid to try it. Ravioli? Very good. We really loved the rib eye as it was very good and the bone marrow was delicious (as bone marrow usually is). The cider donuts were really good too - the sauce that had foie gras in it definitely made it (no it doesn't taste like foie). Rich and maple syrup taken to another level for sure. Although I can usually eat a lot, I came out of the meal very content. Not too full and not too hungry - just right.I didn't have anything to drink besides water, but there seemed to be a sizable wine list and the cocktails looked good. Someone in my group described her cocktail as strong and good.To me, I didn't feel like I was eating exactly midwestern fare. There are some things on there like the ribeye that you could attribute to people in the midwest eating, but it definitely has another lean to it. Or maybe I don't know what true Midwestern eating is. Regardless, I have to say I was surprised. I went in thinking it would be a good meal, but it still exceeded my expectations. Strong restaurant and I'll be back for sure in the future."
"I visited Oak + Char on a Friday night in February with a friend (Lisa). We were able to be seated at the bar immediately. The staff at the host stand was very welcoming and accommodating finding us a spot at the bar. However, once at the bar the service was not as attentive. The restaurant has a romantic and whimsical feel and manages to have a decent amount of comfortable seating for what seems like a somewhat smaller space. The restaurant was filled with a lot of laughter and conversation. I wouldn't call it loud or disruptive, just lively!My friend and I each had a glass of wine before ordering two small plates. I had a glass of the Bodegas Ercavio tempranillo which I really enjoyed. Lisa had two glasses of the Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon (good, but nothing special). While at the bar we ordered two small plates; the ravioli doppio and saffron roman gnocchi. The gnocchi was good; the flavors were earthy and clean. The ravioli was probably my favorite. They were light and the truffle fondue was amazing. You know the moment you're splitting food with someone and there is one bite left and you always offer the last bite to the other person? Not here, that last bite of ravioli was mine!The reason for the three stars really came down to portions vs. price; $16 for each small plate which were on the smaller than small side and my annoyance for being charged $2 for frozen water. I ordered a glass of bourbon (Basil Hayden $12, a personal favorite). I am someone who feels a splash of water or a rock nicely opens the flavor. However, here you need to pay an extra $2 to enjoy the flavor of your bourbon. Even though it was only $2 for a large piece of frozen water it was disheartening. Overall, the restaurant has a beautiful look. The staff is friendly and accommodating, however, the prices were on the high side for the lack of food given."
I was there with my company and absolutely enjoyed it. I especially liked the smoke-roasted chicken - possibly among the best chicken I've ever had. The octopus was nicely done as well. I was satisfied with all of the dozen or so dishes we ordered!
"This is my new favorite Chicago restaurant. The 32 oz bone-in Ribeye served with bone marrow is one of the richest and most delicious dinners I've had recently. It comes HIGHLY recommended, although it should probably be split unless you're hooked up to an IV of Lipitor.The chicken wings were also notable, as was the dessert we ordered; the cider donuts. All in all Oak + Char is a place I'm very excited to return to!"
"This is a belated review but we came here for NYE dinner.  They had a pre fixed menu.  The waiter was super friendly and attentive.  He was able to substitute my main course since I don't eat red meat from beef to duck.The food was amazing, tasted wonderful.  The only downside is that we did spend around $200 and I didn't think it was worth that much.  The portion sizes were super small so I was actually still hungry after our 5 course meals lol."
"We checked out this restaurant shortly after it opened and were pleasantly surprised at how smooth the service was. We got a selection of starters (chicken wings, shishito peppers, and octopus) that were all very good, particularly the wings. We were, however, disappointed in our main course dishes. I got the pork collar and my husband got the duck. Duck is usually on the rawer side, but this preparation was essentially completely raw. My pork collar was also bright red in a number of places. We took most of the duck home and I cooked it in the microwave just to see what would happen and it actually tasted delicious after being nuked, so I'm not sure what that says about the chef's skills or my talents with the microwave.  I am hopeful that this was an opening month misstep, as the preparations for these dishes were not correct (and if they were, the dishes just didn't taste good)."
"After reading about this place on Eater, I decided I had to come check it out. It was fairly easy to get a reservation so the hype hasn't caught up with this place yet.First, the atmosphere of the restaurant is very cozy, kinda of feels like a warm log cabin with a rustic design to it. We were seated right away and told about the drink specials. They had some rum drink special cocktail for $8 which was amazing. I highly recommend it if its available.Here's what we ordered:Shishitos - peppers sitting on top of a peanut sauce. The peanut sauce was the best part, I give this a B.MSG Chicken Wings - Awesome wings, A++Ravoli doppio - So much flavor, small plate though. ACheeseburger - Very good and filling. A-Rye Aged Duck - Haven't had too much duck, wanted to try it out, it's kind of chewy, good amount of fat. B+Cider Doughnuts -  Just some cinnamon doughnut holes. B+tcho chocolate pie -  Great all around. AI'd definitely like to go back to try their prime rib which is listed at Market price? Why can't you just put an actual number on it, does that mean its $30 or $100? Literally every single Chicago steakhouse prime rib place has a price on their meat but you guys can't figure one out? It's just annoying when restaurants do that."
"I had heard my colleagues talking about this place so I decided to check it out with my fiance. We came on a Sunday night, so it wasn't too busy and our food arrived pretty quickly. We got the MSG Chicken, Tandoori Octopus, Venison Tartare (one of the specials of the evening, not on the menu), and Pork Collar. Every dish was DELICIOUS with lots of different flavors, and the flavors were very unique. The portions aren't massive but if you take their advice & order 1 'snack', 2 small dishes, and a large dish to share, it's just perfect. For dessert, I ordered the Cotton Cake - a Japanese style cheese cake with pomegranate jam & basil strudel. Unfortunately, I didn't like this very much because 1. I've had Japanese style cheesecake and this didn't taste like it. It just tasted like pound cake (which isn't what Japanese style cheesecake is)2. The basil strudel was really really hard/crunchy, which I thought didn't go well with the dish3. The dish was room temperature, almost a bit warm, while I was expecting it to be cold (as cheesecake usually is)In any case, overall it was a good dinner and I'd recommend checking it out!"
"Wow. This place was SO GOOD. The wings were the best I've ever had -- make sure to get two orders when you go. Also had the coconut crab which was wonderful, and the burger (good but not my favorite). Donuts were the perfect dessert!"
"Please note, I came for lunch not diner so limited menu. We had the cheeseburger and trout. The trout was better but both just okay. The service and atmosphere was great but I'm not in a hurry to go back to try more just yet."
"As a long time restaurant server, I usually like to give a restaurant a few months to work out the kinks when it opens before I go there. But apparently I wasn't paying attention when my husband and I took our in-laws to Oak + Char. We thought they'd been open a few weeks, turns out we actually were there on the first night! And they absolutely blew us away. The most unique thing about Oak + Char is their big big big plates - either a prime rib or a whole foie gras to share. We were apparently the first people to ever order the whole foie gras, and let me tell you it was amazing! If we could have licked the board it was on, we would have.In addition to that, some of the highlights of the meal were the ravioli and the apple cider they served on a cold fall evening.Recently, we joined them again for a seven course meal with wine pairings on New Year's Eve and were once again blown away by Chef Joe Heppe's talent. The food was tasty, but also thoughtful and told a beautiful story. The pairings were excellent, and really innovative to pair not just wine, but spirits and beer in some cases as well.Tyler Mendoza and his father, the owners, are the sweetest people. They made us feel incredibly welcome and like they're a great part of the neighborhood! Can't wait to have many more meals with Oak + Char!"
"My wife and I came here on my birthday this past weekend.  Not being from Chicago, we had read that this restaurant was opening in the former Graham Elliot space, and was focused on ""Midwestern"" cuisine.  Growing up and living in the Midwest, I knew that we needed to check out Oak + Char during our vacation.  While we arrived off of the L a little early, our table was still ready for us when we walked in.  The first things I noticed when we arrived were the oak leaf door pulls, which I found to be unique, but appropriate, given the name of the restaurant, as well as the lighting inside.  The lights looked like massive bed sheets hanging from the ceiling.  I'm not really sure how to explain it, but I really enjoyed it.  It's nice to see a place do something different with their interior lighting.  We were seated at a two-top by the bar.  I'm not sure how many two-tops are in the main dining area, but our seats seemed a little more like open bar seating, versus having an actual reservation.  I didn't mind the seating at all, just making an observation.Our server did a very nice job and was very knowledgeable about the menu.  We started off the evening with cocktails from the bar, as we knew the bartender used to be at Longman and Eagle, so we knew they would be good.  I had the Dolly with Rye, Campari, Maple, Lemon, Egg White, Cucumber, and Salt.  It was a great take on a whiskey sour.  I thought it was well-balanced, and not too sweet.  My wife had the Jordo with Jim Beam Black, Averna, Tawny Port, and Becherovka.  I had a sip of hers and really enjoyed it as well.Now, on to the food.  Having dined at Girl and the Goat the previous night, I was excited to see that Oak + Char also did small plates, meant for sharing.  Wanting to get a good sample of the menu, we decided to go with four different options: burrata, pork trotter spring rolls, ravioli doppio, and beef tartare.  Our waitress was kind to ask if we wanted the meal coursed out, to which we agreed.  before I get in to each of the dishes, I just want to say the the pace of the meal was outstanding.  I don't feel like we ever waited too long between each course, but we also never felt like we were rushed.  With cocktails, four main courses and dessert, we were there for right about two hours.  I also enjoyed that we also had the option (should we wanted that) for our food to arrive all at once.  I would not suggest that, as everything we had was meant to be savored and enjoyed, so if you are in a rush, head someplace else for the night.Now, let's be honest, I've never met a burrata that I haven't liked.  I mean, seriously, who doesn't love burrata?  I would have to say that the eggplant sauce it came with really matched nicely here, even though I'm not typically a fan of eggplant.  The two of us had no issue finishing off both the burrata itself as well as the sauce.  The spring rolls were delicious as well.  They were crispy on the outside, and cooked to perfection on the inside.  They were the perfect little bites to start the meal.  It's important to note that you should not expect full-sized spring rolls.  The are four bite-sized spring rolls.  It's also important to note that both this and the burrata were under the ""snack"" portion of the menu, which was separate from the ""small plates"" that the rest of our food came from.  We knew what we were getting ourselves in to, but I just wanted to make it clear for anyone reading this.Course number three brings us to the ravioli doppio.  I really enjoyed this a ton!  Each of the five raviolis had two little ""chambers"", which I had never seen before.  One side had a maitaki mushroom filling, and the other side had a celery root filling.  The way this ravioli was set up, you could eat it a couple of different ways.  You could either split the ravioling length wise, which would yield you one ravioli of each filling, or you could split it width-wise, meaning you would be trying both sides of the ravioli in one bite.  I did this both ways, for comparison's sake, and I really enjoyed each one.  The fillings played nicely together and it all really worked well!Course number four was the beef tartare, which I had never experienced before.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I honestly never knew that raw beef could taste so delicious!  The uni aioli also was especially delicious.  Finally, we decided to opt for dessert, which was an outstanding choice, if I do say so myself.  We went for the cider doughnuts with this delicious maple foie sauce.  Trust me here folks, it was worth every last bite!I'm so glad we decided to check out Oak + Char!  The place was packed the whole time, so make sure you get a reservation before going!  I can't wait to see how they do and am wishing them nothing but success!"
"The old Graham Elliot place looks totally different!  Its nice and cozy with mostly high-tops but all of the chairs have backs.  And I think there were purse hooks which is a big plus in my book.  The decor is cool but unusual.  I wonder if they have to take all of the puffy things down to wash them?  We thought they were either dust ruffles, jellyfish (which is not at all Midwestern), or specific body parts that are not good dinner discussion.  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  She answered questions about the drinks and food and was around just the right amount.   I started with the Dolly which was lovely.  A great color and a great mix of sweet and sour.  Like a rye margarita.  My friend got the cinnamon cocktail and it was interesting.  He ordered two of them so he liked it!For food it was somewhat slim pickin's for me.  The only fish option that night was trout.  I usually don't go for lake fish so I didn't try it.  So to share we had the burrata which was lovely.  It has a nice smokey flavor and the puffy warm bread is very nice with it.  My friends got the wings which I don't eat.  They cleaned their plates so I assume they were a hit.The #1 hit of the night was the broccoli.  It was like a very light tempura with this lovely mayo like sauce and fried anchovies.  We could have ordered three more rounds of that!  Since I was missing a few dishes I got the apple pomegranate salad which was great.  Very well balanced and not too much of anything.  The cold smoked oysters were great.  I wasn't expecting them to be in a Mason jar.  I've never not slurped them so it was weird putting it on a cracker.  The butter with lemon was an excellent touch. We also shared the ravioli which was delicious as well.  Everything is very nicely balanced.  My friends got the pork collar and they licked that plate clean.  Dessert was disappointing for me.  I should have fought harder for the cheese plate.  As it was I didn't have anything but my friends got two of the dishes.  The doughnuts and the pot de creme.  I would come back only because what I did have was well made.  I would avoid this place because there's not a lot that I'd eat.  Midwest food doesn't have to be so dang meaty!  IMO there is no need to put meat on a doughnut.  This Iowan prefers to cover things in either cheese or chocolate :-)"
"Food was good. Had the burger, tartare, trout and wings. Plenty of food for 3 people. Will definitely will be back."
"Food was GREAT!My reason for the four stars is for the following reasons:1. The front door is inside the building, across from a hair salon. There is a ton of foot traffic in and out on a busy Friday night. This wouldn't be an issue, however there are many tables awkwardly placed right in the front area. I made a reservation weeks in advance and was placed at one of these undesirable tables. When I asked the hostess for something else, she was EXTREMELY rude and acted like she was inconvenienced by the idea of moving me. Thankfully, our waitress redeemed the place because she was awesome! Super upbeat and knowledgeable.2. The food is great but not outstanding. There are many other places I would go in Chicago for better food."
"Went to oak + char for my birthday dinner on a Friday night. We arrived early for our reservations and had a drink at the bar. I got the Alice and felt the drink tasted like kool aid more than a cocktail. My husband got the Dolly and it was delicious.We were seated in the cozy back area. The atmosphere of the restaurant was trendy and similar to what you find in river north. We started with the shishito peppers, which were bland but the sauce that accompanied it was delicious. The charred burrata wasn't impressive and the homemade naan was too thick and hard. But the chicken wings were amazing! I would definitely come back for the wings alone.Then we shared the ravioli, which were really flavorful, and the crispy broccoli, which was glorified veggie tempura.Finally we shared the half smoked chicken. The chicken was salty but the skin was crispy. My husband loved it. The side of potatoes flavors were a little overwhelming but overall good. The hostess mentioned my birthday when we arrived. As most restaurants present a complementary dessert, nothing was offered. I do think when customers choose to celebrate a special occasion, it's the restaurants job to make the customer feel special. It would have made the experience better.There are a lot of good restaurants in the city so I don't think I'll return to Oak+ Char soon."
This place is cool.  The Wings Rock!  Great staff and really friendly bar tenders.  Nice addition to the neighborhood.  Great time
"For my husband's 30th birthday last night we went to see a show and decided to check out Oak and Char since we live so close. We didn't have reservations but the hostess was extremely welcoming and friendly though the restaurant seemed busy. We must have switched tables at least three times but she was very accommodating and professional despite my husband's picky requests but he does have a back problem!  The tables are very high and others don't have backs - next time we will make reservations at a normal sized table. My only complaint is that the chairs are very high and look uncomfortable! Other than that the space is very different from what I remember GE looking like. It is much more romantic. Our server, though I do not recall his name, was very funny and knowledgeable. We might as well have let him order for us! He explained that the plates are meant to be shared so we ordered several that he suggested. I LOVED the burata so much I didn't WANT to share it but it was my husbands birthday so I had to ;)) It was very tasty and well seasoned I will have to find a recipe to make it at home! The wine list was a bit overwhelming but our server helped us pick.Though the food took a while longer than we expected to come, it was well worth the wait. We had a ""Chef Board"" with fish that was incredible. My favorite fish was the ""spicy"" fish that our server explained is to be cut down the middle.Usually I shy away from fish at restaurants but my husband insisted and I couldn't have been any happier. The meal was plenty for two people but I would've ordered another just for myself if I could! Will be going back!"
"Went here on a Saturday night. We ordered 3 snack plates, and two small plates as well as two cocktails. The bartender made me a great cocktail off menu. We ordered the spring rolls, burrat and the MSG Chicken wings. The wings were honestly some of the best that i have ever had -- sweet but great flavor. They were so good that we ordered a second order. Our server, Leah, was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu.We also had the crispy broccoli which was extremely on point. Only reason this place wasn't 5 stars is b/c other than the wings, nothing was knock-your-socks-off good, but overall it was a very solid meal for a new restaurant."
"Great small plates spot. I heard they're opening their patio for the summer, so I'll definitely be back to check that out. We literally ordered one of everything off the menu, and really enjoyed everything. It wasn't knock your socks off good, but the bar is high in the Chicago dining scene! My favorite was the burtata dish, highly recommended. We also loved the service, very attentive and our server was friendly and really helpful."
Attended the soft opening. Great ambiance and vibeFood was fantastic and service was great!  Can't wait to come back to check out he drink menu soon!
Lovely cocktails. Exciting yet approachable food menu. Friendly staff. New favorite!
"We invited our friends here to celebrate their engagement and the four of us left this restaurant raving about the restaurant. The ambience was great and I loved the decor of this place with its exposed brick and puffy fabric light fixtures. The service was very attentive and we especially like how they kept a jug of water on the table. Our server described the cuisine as Midwestern dishes with a global twist that supports local farmers. Between the four of us, we shared the following:- Pork Trotter spring rolls- delicious and crispy- MSG wings- perfectly cooked. Crispy, sweet and savory- Tandoori octopus- the only dish that we felt wasn't as good as the other. We couldn't figure out if the octopus was overcooked or not that fresh- Beef Tartare- I couldn't eat this but the table enjoyed it. Love the potato crisps it came with though and they used it to scoop the tartare- Cold smoked oysters- yum! I loved the consistency and flavors of the oysters as well as the cracker and creamy butter- Goat strozzapreti- the pasta was cooked to perfection. Very al dente and the sauce was good. - Ravioli Doppio- probably one of the best ravioli I've ever had. One of our friends said that if we had to order another dish, he'd order this one again.-Lamb Sweetbreads- excellent and we all loved that it came with blood sausage. Beautiful presentation and great flavorsSo the two appetizers and six small dishes were the perfect quantity for the four of us. We each enjoyed two drinks each (hooray for their liquor license!)."
"Decor is great and the staff was amazing.  They were all friendly and had great attitudes which made the experience 4 stars for me.  Overall, the food was great and I LOVED the beef tartar.  The cocktails were fine but were all too sweet for my taste. Overall, I'm looking forward to coming back soon."
Excellent food with unique drinks. Great service too! We tried many different dishes & all were exceptional! A must on my Chicago list of eateries!
"Like some of the other reviews, my group and I had an average to mediocre experience. The space itself is comfortable- dim lighting with nice furniture. We found the lighting fixtures to be odd, though. Regardless, between the five of us we had a variety of drinks and food dishes here. We began by ordering a bottle of wine. When we ordered, our server said, ""Oh, is that a red or a white?"" I understand if you're still learning the menu, but at least try to be less obvious. His service was spotty throughout the rest of the meal- didn't check on us often, ask how we were enjoying the meal or explain to us what was coming out of the kitchen. We also had a bus boy spill an entire carafe of water onto our table, but that was really the least of our concerns at that point. As for the food, we ordered shishitos, smoked oysters, lamb sweetbreads, spring rolls, octopus, beef tartare and donuts. The only dish we truly enjoyed was the octopus, which was flavorful and cooked well. The spring rolls were just phyllo dough filled with trotter (no veggies or anything exciting), the sweetbreads were bland (the sausage accompaniment was good, but we had no idea what this was prior to asking (again, explain the dish when it has multiple components), the beef tartare was flavorful enough, but not chopped finely and was unappetizing. The chips which are served with the tartare tasted like they came from a bag of stale Lays. After the bus boy spilled water toward the end of the meal without apologizing, the manager stopped by our table. We told him about the mixed experience and he was receptive to the feedback. To the restaurant's credit, after speaking to the manager Executive Chef and Partner Joseph Heppe also came to our table. He said they appreciated the feedback and will be striving to improve the service and the menu. Assuming this is true, I would return, but not for a few more months. This restaurant still has a lot of kinks to work out if they want to survive."
"I heard about Oak + Char opening up in Fall of 2014 and looked for a good opportunity to check it out - we finally had a celebratory moment and we decided to try what sounded like an interesting and provocatively themed restaurant (i.e. a fusion of the ethnic cuisines found in the modern Midwest). We loved the presentation, service (both attentive and helpful in terms of guidance), and the ambiance was very appropriate for larger groups (a social scene). Nearly every item ordered was a hit with our group. Appetizers: Beef fat onion rings (delicious, salty, crunchy), MSG Wings (a must have, the right amount of sweet and savory). Main: smoke-roasted chicken (the smokiness is incredible and the egg is a true flavor enhancer), Korean braised beef short rib (texture is perfect), and the best item of the night: 32oz bone in ribeye with bone marrow (this was a true treat and the presentation was amazing - on a chef's board with a cow pourer for the sauce perigueux). Dessert: A Japanese inspired cake, moist with pistachio and jam. Overall, a great, semi-casual group spot that I will be frequenting in the future."
"Simply fabulous!!!!  My new favorite.  Farm to table, great ambiance & a memorable meal.  Lauren, our server was phenomenal.  A must go to place."
