TWO
"This might just be the best meal I've ever had. Such an enjoyable experience too. Great food and presentation, without the stuffiness or snobiness of downtown. Parking was decent, and there were families with pre-teens, a first date, etc. Fun people watching.When you walk in it appears you are in a bar with a table set for a private party. I was so confused. And we got a super (!) warm welcome from the host who brought us to the back and left to the host stand--- oh, ok, I see the kitchen now.Seating is cozy without being squished. Water is served chilled without ice (my super favorite). Fun cocktails and booze selections--- I asked for something sweet and fizzy and the waitress ""knew just the thing."" Indeed! It was ah-mazing: procheto.Each ""small plate"" wasn't too small (good!) and perfect for two. So my husband and I each ordered 2 things, which came out 1 at a time, and offered a few bites for each of us. We totally were stuffed- in a good way.Food was fresh, and such a fun blend of tastes and textures. We luckily saved room for dessert-- banana bread pudding. WUHHH! Excellent."
"A couple months ago, my boyfriend and a group of my friends came (without me) and got the chef's menu. They called it ""the best meal of the year"", which prompted me to be so disappointed that I couldn't go that I cried the next morning as my boyfriend raved on and on. So yesterday I finally got the opportunity to go to TWO for their chef's menu. I was expecting it to be a religious experience of food, and because of that I was slightly underwhelmed. That being said, it was a very solid and delicious meal. We got a huge amount of food for a VERY reasonable price. There were TWO options (get it? haha...I'm not funny): a $50pp and a $45pp option. We chose the $50 per person meal and ended up with 10 different dishes (2 plates of each to share between the 6 of us). I walked away exploding. The best part about the chef's menu is that you have no idea what's coming next. You tell them your food allergies/restrictions and they bring you out whatever they create. We received:Appetizers:* Potato Croquettes - Very tasty, but not terribly special or flavorful. I wish they had been smaller so that it wasn't such an overwhelming amount of potato* Spring Salad - Fresh, delicious...loved it. They had these awesome fried cheese balls on them* Mussels - YUM. Great broth. * Green Beans - Decent. Nicely cooked, but the spicy red sauce on top wasn't my favorite. Entrees:* Chicken - AMAZEBALLS. Yes, that amazing. Hands down the best dish. We fought over the last pieces it was that good. I would go back just to eat more of that chicken. Mmmm it's what dreams are made of. * Steak - Not good. Really tough, kind of a weird flavor. * Short Rib Risotto - Second best dish. Rich and delicious.* Halibut - I wasn't a fan but other people liked it. There was a lot of flavor, but it just wasn't for me. Dessert (My boyfriend is making me preface this with the fact that I'm a pastry chef so I'm pretty picky with desserts):* Banana Bread Pudding - The banana-bread bread pudding was my favorite of our two desserts, but it needed more spice and moisture, in my opinion. That being said, I ate quite a bit of it and my boyfriend's family devoured it.* Chocolate Mousse - I was not a fan at all, but everyone else at the table loved it. I thought it was a bit too bitter (and I'm a dark chocolate lover) and the texture wasn't creamy...it seemed overwhipped. But then again, I was the only one that thought that. Everyone else loved it.THE BOOZE: The May Weather (kind of like a dark and stormy) and the Gleaming the Cube. LOVED the Gleaming the Cube. It started off a bit sour and as the cube melted, turned a bit sweeter. Delicious.Overall, delicious meal. Definitely worth a trip :-)"
"Everything was hit or miss. Service was a tad on the slow side. Dessert was good.Ordered bacon jam butter and toast and and toast was slightly chared. Ordered a duck mousse with toast as well and it was the same dish, and did not taste like anything but butter.The risotto was good as was the salad but many of the meat dishes did not leave a lasting impression. Menu online was outdated."
"Overall: A great experience, but was ultimately expecting more. 3.5 if I could, but still, a great meal.The good: Excellent service (it was a Tues night). The atmosphere is fresh and clean. Some of the plates were amazing, standouts included brisket and peppers. Other plates were either good or disappointing. Portion sizes are decent, obviously to be shared tapas style. The bad: The food was hit or miss, was really expecting more. The pork tenderloin and sausages were a big downer. The duck egg fettuccine was good, but the duck wasn't fantastic. Big charge on the sparkling water that was offered next to tap water.Atmosphere: 8.5/10Service: 10/10Food: 7.5/10"
I had the ramp risotto and the roasted cauliflower with fondue cheese. I died. Feast in my mouth.After party in my taste buds.Best spot we dined at during our Chicago stay.
"My BF and I came here to attend a lovely business dinner meeting and we enjoyed our visit very much. We opted for the tasting menu which were dishes chosen by the Chef. This is a good choice to have if you have large parties. We had so many dishes I cannot remember most of it. We had salmom, steak, pork belly, green beans,  mussels , pasta with pesto sauce, salad and many more. I believed there were like 8-10 dishes that we shared and three  desserts. All I can say is that everything was super delish and the service was really good.  The decor was industrial and hip which reminded me of SF. I would definitely come back  here when I visit Chicago again."
"My parents were in town, so I wanted to take them somewhere impressive. TWO seemed like a restaurant they would enjoy. The entrance to the restaurant is on the corner. We saw a group of people waiting outside, and later we found that they were a bachelorette party. We walked in a bit apprehensively, but we were seated and unbothered by them for the rest of the evening. Our waiter suggested ordering around 6 dishes to share. We got the mixed salad, duck fat croquettes, bone marrow, cheesy cauliflower, prawns, and duck egg fettuccine, and special wagyu. Our favorite of the night was the prawns. They had an asian spiced influence and were cooked perfectly. A close second was the duck fat croquettes. The wagyu was also cooked perfectly and melted in our mouths. The cabbage accompanying it was meh. We weren't too impressed with the cauliflower. Also, the pasta did not meet my expectations. Perhaps it's because everyone raves about it, increasing my expectations. I wish it were served warmer and perhaps cooked a little longer. While there were some hits and misses, the service was impeccable, and the hits were hits. The casual atmosphere and good company made for a positive experience."
Came here with the family and had an incredible experience. You order 2-3 small plates per person and with 3 or 4 people that means you end up tasting most of the menu. Mostly local and sustainability raised meats and everything is done perfectly. Don't shy away from the bone marrow dish as it is amazing. The lamb belly was one of the best dishes I've had anywhere. The staff is great and the manager came by frequently to check on us and tell us more about the dishes...it doesn't hurt that he is pretty hot as well. ;) We were blown away by every bite. Totally in love with two.
"Found this place on Chicago's Bib Gourmand list and decided to make a reservation for 4 on a Sunday night. The place was pretty packed but we were seated right away and service was really good. The dining experience is served tapas style and dishes are staggered and meant to be shared amongst the table. Our server recommended that each person order 1 appetizer and 1 main dish to share. Since there were 4 girls with relatively small appetites, we decided to order 4 main dishes, 2 appetizers, and 1 dessert instead. For our appetizers, we ordered the duck fat croquettes and the bone marrow. The duck fat croquettes were delicious and literally melted in our mouths. Picture the most gourmet tasting tater tot you can imagine- that's exactly how it tasted. The bone marrow was also good and seasoned very well. Between the two appetizers, I would recommend getting the duck fat croquettes more than the bone marrow. Although the marrow was good, it wasn't anything amazing. Also make sure everyone in your group eats marrow because the consistency is not really for everyone (slightly gooey and actually kinda like lard but GOOD!.)For our main dishes, we ordered the amish chicken, wagyu beef, ramp risotto, and ribeye (ranked from best to meh). The amish chicken was AMAZING - best chicken I've had in my life thus far. The chicken was so tender and flavorful and the skin had just the right amount of crispiness. We cleaned off the plate and was tempted to order another serving. The wagyu beef was also super tender. The meat was practically falling off as we sliced into it. My only complaint would be the seasoning and how it was slightly too salty for my liking. Since we were eating the wagyu beef plain, the sauce was a little too overpowering in certain bites.We ordered the ramp risotto with the duck egg add-on, which was definitely a good idea. The risotto also had an overpowering herby taste from the ferns however the yolk from the duck egg was able to balance it out. I appreciated how the risotto wasn't too creamy and packed a good flavor. I would've liked it to have more depth since compared to the other dishes we ordered, the ramp risotto just seemed way too plain. It probably would have been better mixed/eaten with another dish.The ribeye was definitely the most disappointing dish of the night. The meat was SO tough and we were shocked at how poor the quality was given how impressed we were with everything else we ate. I'm not sure why the ribeye came out like that but I had such a hard time chewing. The serving size was also much smaller compared to the other dishes (4 small slices). The fries were good though and tasted like a better version of In n Out fries. The compound butter that was served with the fries complemented it really well. For dessert, we ordered the banana bread pudding with bourbon caramel ice cream which was also good. Not the best bread pudding I've ever had but it did taste good :)Overall, I would definitely recommend and would also go back just for the amish chicken!"
"My sister and I were looking for a place for an early dinner before our show that was fairly close the Bank of America Theatre.  We didn't want to eat in the heart of downtown due to the horrendous search for parking, so we opt for the surrounding neighborhoods.  TWO seemed like a good choice because it was only about 15 minutes away, parking around there isn't too bad (meter parking on the main street of Grand, but free parking along the side streets), and was participating in Chef Week.When we arrived, we were greeted immediately by the hostess.  I stated we have reservations for 2 at 5:30 pm.  She tried to look up the reservations, but became perplexed soon after.  There seemed to have been a mix up because my reservations were pushed back to 6:30 pm.  It didn't take long for the hostess to resolve the situation.  She found us a table and sat us down.For Chef Week, TWO offered a 4 course meal for $44.  There was two items under each category, so we opt for one of each entrée to share among the two of us.First Course:Porchetta Di Testa: served with pea shoots, Greek olive oil, and grilled bread.  The thinly sliced porchetta had a good ratio between meat and fat which made the porchetta tender and succulent.  The bitterness from the pea shoots was a good compliment to the slight saltiness of the porchetta.  The only complain I had was the ""grilled"" bread was more like burnt bread.  The overly charred bread overpowered the whole taste of the dish, but without the bread the porchetta was too salty to eat on its own.Warm Asparagus Salad: served with anchovy butter, sheep's milk feta, and a fried duck egg.  I was a little iffy about this dish because I'm not a huge fan of anchovies, but this dish was really delicious.  The cook on the asparagus was at the perfect crunchy texture and the butter, feta, and egg gave the dish an overall creamy consistency.  Second Course:Gulf Prawns: served with wild mushrooms in a shrimp-sherry bisque.  I was really disappointed with this dish.  The shrimps were overcooked and it was overly salty.  Slagel Farms Suckling Pig: shredded meat from the shoulders cooked with green garlic topped with a pork belly; all on top of a turnip puree.  I didn't really enjoy this dish at all probably because I'm not a huge fan of pork, but my sister really liked the flavors and the cook on the meat.  She said the pork belly really was the true winner of this dish. Third Course:Ramp Risotto: made with bacon, roasted ramp bulbs, and a fried duck egg (additional $3).  My sister and I were both not huge fans of this dish.  We felt like there was no flavor but for the bitterness of the ramp bulbs.  After one bite, we didn't go back for a second helping.Homemade Duck Egg Pasta: made with duck confit, scallions, duck skin cracklins, and parmesan.  With the first bite, you can taste the freshness of the pasta.  It was cooked to a perfect al dente and well-seasoned.  The duck was also cooked perfectly to a moist and tender texture.  Overall, this dish was delicious.  Fourth Course:Banana Bread Pudding: topped with bourbon caramel sauce and Chantilly cream with a side of ice cream.  I didn't get a chance to taste the bread pudding (which I heard was amazing) due to the fact we were running really close to our show time.  We had our desserts packed to go and my sister went home with it.Honey Ricotta Cheesecake: topped with honey and macerated strawberries.  The cheesecake went home with me and I found this cheesecake to be one of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted in a while.  The texture was rich and creamy and the acidity from the strawberries was a great compliment.Overall, I thought the service was impeccable.  TWO offers a full service experience: assisted with your coat, switched silverware between entrees, and checked if everything going well.  Everyone was really attentive without being too pesky.  For the food, I thought only a couple of dishes stuck out and truly exceeded my expectations.  I was surprised how poorly/overly seasoned some of the entrees were.  Since TWO was rated Michelin Bib Gourmand, I had expected more."
"My friend and I came in for a special dinner after I moved to Chicago. At 5:30 on a Friday, the restaurant was almost empty, and our servers were very attentive. Their attentiveness continued throughout the evening, however, as the restaurant filled up; they replaced our silverware and dishware several times between dishes, filled water glasses before they approached half-empty, and frequently stopped by to check on our dining experience.The food was just as excellent as the service. We started off with the duck fat croquettes, which were pillowy and light in the center and delightfully crispy on the outside, with exquisite flavor that was only boosted by the spicy aioli. The suckling pork had gorgeous caramelization and fantastic flavor, though it seemed a little dry until we realized that each mouthful should be accompanied by a bit of the bacon wrapping the chop. The duck breast was a little rare for my friend's taste, though I found it tender and perfectly cooked; its accompanying bed of potato and apples were exquisite.The lamb belly was the only disappointment (and I'd still call it a medium-point, rather than a low-point). The flavor and fat layers were a little too strong for both of us. This is the only dish we didn't finish on the spot or take home.We finished off with the wagyu brisket, which was exceptional; smoky, melt-in-the-mouth, and intensely flavored, with a sour cherry chutney that elevated it over the top. And after all that, we somehow found room to share a honey-ricotta cheesecake with macerated strawberries and fresh cream, which was one of the best cheesecake experiences of my life--not too rich, with a creamy but ricotta-soft texture. The decor was a comfortable rustic-chic, and we loved the music choices as well (they actually played several of my favorite songs). We've been talking about this meal all weekend. I look forward to coming back!"
"I loved the casual, yet refined, ambiance at TWO. Our waitress was great and she admitted to having actually tried every item on the menu. I appreciate it when staff can give you honest and personal recommendations. The manager or owner was also present and making rounds at the tables, which is always nice.I don't remember exactly what we had for appetizers. It was an off menu recommendation from our waitress that included fried pastrami, so obviously I was on board. We had the prawns, which were my favorite item of the night. I just wished the portions were bigger because it was difficult to share. We also ordered the duck egg fettuccine with duck confit and duck skin. Triple duck? Yes, please.I'm going back this weekend and I can't wait to try some of the other menu items."
"Wow! This place does not disappoint! My boyfriend and I came here for a last minute dinner during Chef Week and it was AMAZING. My boyfriend actually lives around the corner from this place, but we had never been because it seemed so pricy. The Chef Week menu was definitely worth the value ($44). It came with four courses and each course had two options. My boyfriend and I decided to just order one of each option and split everything.The first course was a pork type dish with bread and a warm asparagus salad. I really enjoyed both, but I absolutely loved the asparagus. It was cooked and seasoned extremely well.The second course included prawns and another pig dish with pork belly and a pulled pork-type thing. This course was probably my favorite. The pork belly was too good for words and the prawns....man..my mouth is watering just thinking about them.The third course was a ramp risotto and a duck egg pasta. This was probably my least favorite course, especially after the second course. Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious, just not as delicious as the second course in my opinion. The ramp risotto was interesting and probably my least favorite out of all the food. The duck egg pasta was nice though.The final course was dessert and included banana bread pudding and cheesecake. Holy cow. The bread pudding was to die for! I could have eaten about 10 more orders of that thing and, honestly, I would come back JUST for the bread pudding. The cheesecake was also good, but I was so full at this point. We also added in an extra item, which was wild boar. We definitely would have been full without the boar, but man, I'm glad we ordered that too. It was similar to a pork chop, but it was seasoned to perfection and basically melted in your mouth.The service was immaculate and even though the restaurant got really busy, we never felt ignored. Our server was very nice and took great care of us.Overall, I loved eating at this restaurant and hopefully I will be back soon!"
"I had a reservation here on a Saturday date night with my hubby and after hearing amazing things about this place for so long I knew that we had to try it. Upon arrival around 6:30pm the restaurant was packed and I was a little annoyed that the host said that we had to wait for our table. So we waited an additional 15 minutes before getting sat. However, we did get a nice corner table by the window with little pillows around us making it super comfy. I guess the table was worth the wait. We got a few wine glasses to get the evening started and waited upon our food and this is what we got.Ham board: Jamon Serrano, duck rillette, stone ground mustard, pickles, herb whipped ricotta. We got the 2oz portion for $20 and it was superb, make sure you get this, the bread comes out so crispy and warm and everything on that plate is delicious. Duck fat potato croquettes, chili aioli, parmesan. I'm normally not a big fan of potatoes but these were amazing, you should definitely try them and ask for extra dipping of that spicy sauce. Homemade duck egg fettuccine, duck confit, scallions, duck skin cracklins, parmesan. We each got this dish since it was so talked about and I wish we only got one since it was just average, the actual pasta was way too chewy in my opinion not how I normally would eat it or prefer it and I wish there was a tad more duck confit.Banana bread pudding, salted bourbon caramel sauce, chantilly cream, homemade ice cream. Because how could we pass on dessert and I'm not the biggest fan of bread pudding but this one is insanely delicious. Super flavorful and just melts in your mouth.Overall, the place had a great atmosphere, perfect for a date night or a girls night, the service was on point and they really know their stuff. Most of the dishes were super tasty, wish I could have liked the pasta dish more, but I will definitely be back when I'm in the area. Prices aren't cheap, but worth it for this place."
"I came here for Chef week menu for dinner. It was 4 course for $44 and it was very filling and generous portion. The service was very attentive - assist your our jacket removal, water was always filled,  new plate and utensils. Few dishes were very memorable: the suckling pig, warm asparagus salad with poached egg, and the banana bread pudding. Other dishes were okay. Porchetta with olive oil and arugula - typical dish with generous portion of porchetta with the house bread. warm asparagus with poached egg - lightly cooked/crunchy asparagus atopped with seasoning (garlic chips?) - this was very simple, but it was delicious and one of my favorite!Gulf prawn with sherry bisque/salsa verde- A generous sized prawn that was de-shelled (thanks!) atop of sherry bisque. The bisque had a tangy flavor and I really like it as a dipping sauce. It was good and ok.Suckling Pig with parsnip puree and green garlic - My favorite! The dish was topped with suckling pig's skin which was crispy. The meat was shredded and the flavor was well balanced with the garlic. Somewhat reminds me of a better version of the kalua pig. The meat was very tender and the parsnip puree was more like a mash potato. SO delicious. Housemade pasta with duck and confit - The pasta was al dente and full of flavor! The duck was toasty and compliments the pasta. However, i thought the seasoning was tad too heavy with pepper, garlic, and salt. It would be better if it was less seasoning and I would probably enjoy it better. Ramp risotto - additional $3 for fried duck egg. This is more of a vegetable based risotto which i enjoyed and it was a twist from the typical risotto. Like my brother said, it reminded him of drinking the fresh made green juices. Therefore he didnt quite enjoy the entree as much as I did. Banana bread pudding with ice cream - Favorite! The dessert wasnt as sweet a I thought it would be. The banana bread was soft on the inside and the outside was toasty/ crispy. It complimented the housemade vanilla ice cream really well. Ricotta cheesecake - The cheesecake was soft and fluffy. The crust was not too sweet and good. However, I felt like the cheesecake lacked that Cheesecake taste,possibly because it's ricotta? I will pass on this dessert..."
"We discovered this tapas restaurant on Groupon and purchased a deal for a date night. The Chef's Selection Menu for Two included a 5 course meal with a bottle of wine (a $139 dinner for $89). This restaurant reminds me of home, and by home, I mean Texas. We were greeted with friendly smiles and handshakes by the hostess the moment we walked through the front door - that was a first for us. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. They time each dish perfectly - from the moment we sat down to the time we finished each dish. We barely had time to think about the next dish before the dish was served. In addition, we were given a new set of dishes and utensils for each course. We loved how they cleaned the table after each course and the way they presented each dish. My favorite dishes were: the Banger Island Mussels, Ramp Risotto, Banana Bread Pudding. The bread that comes with the mussels is to die for. I wish I knew the secret of how they toasted and flavored each piece. The ramp risotto melts in your mouth. Don't be afraid of the green color; each bite comes with an explosion of flavor in your mouth. The banana bread pudding is so moist. I love that it comes with a side of ice cream. I'd highly recommend trying this restaurant out with the Groupon deal. It's totally worth it if you haven't tried out this place yet."
"I really liked this place!We went for a large client dinner, did a prefixed menu & the whole crew was happy. Great place for a group - very attentive service. The drinks here are awesome, treat yourself to a cocktail or two.My favorite dish was the chicken - seriously incredibly juicy and I'm not one to order Chicken at a restaurant. Can't miss the bread pudding for dessert. YUM!"
"As always, I get a woodie for 4.5 stars on yelp.  This time, I was left scratching my head wondering which restaurant everyone else went to....The food was bland at best.  The beer was good, but I doubt they make the beer.We started with potato croquettes.  Those are actually fried mashed potato balls.  Igg.  Imagine weird tater tots. I would have preferred some of the golden arrows from Mickey ds. Then we had the grass fed tri tip.  First, they served it cold.  We sent it back, and the second dish was flaming hot (read too hot like they did something to warm it up), but, it was fairly bland steak with a weird shaved vegetable concoction under neath.  Not horrible, but if I cooked this at home I would try a different recipe next time.  The risotto stood out the most.   I think it came from a can, but my wife believes it was fresh.  But we both agree the risotto was no good.  The sauce was overly thick and bad.Overall, I prefer a burger from tgi Fridays.  Also, the service was horrible.  They were kind.  In fact, the busboys were actually quite attentive, but the server was no where to be found.  We didn't get our drinks until AFTER we ate our first dish.  The only explanation for the cold tri tip is that server let it sit for 20 minutes.   Finally after we were done, we sat there for 20 minutes waiting for our check/attention.  We finally had to flag someone down for the check.  Horrendous.  There is must be another restaurant called two because I do not understand all the highly favorable reviews.  I was left flacid."
"Spectacular! Right up there with MK as the best meal we've had in SF.  Everything was impeccable from start to finish:1) Homemade bacon jam, herb ricotta, grilled bread  - unbelievable combo of textures and flavors, the bacon jam was off the hizzy2) Nichols Farm roasted  cauliflower, pickled red onions, white cheddar fondue  - you had me at white cheddar fondue3) Gulf prawns, oyster mushrooms, shrimp-sherry bisque, Espelette pepper  - incredibly rich, almost too much -almost4) Homemade duck egg fettuccine, duck confit, scallions, duck skin cracklins, parmesan  - needed a touch of pepper to make it epic but damn, it was good5) Risotto, homemade bacon, garlic, fiddlehead ferns, fava beans  - best. risotto. ever.Service was perfect.  Interior was both cozy and open, great balance.  Just a fantastic meal overall."
"The service was fantastic and the food was really good.  We weren't sure what to expect since we had purchased a Groupon deal, which can be a hit or miss proposition; Fortunately for us, it was a huge hit and it made our anniversary dinner even better.The deal was a chef's menu that is already set in place, much like a pre fixed or tasting menu.  I have always like this concept since it takes a lot of the guess work out in determining what to get the first time at an establishment.The shared plate meal also came with a complimentary bottle of wine, which was an unexpected, but welcomed  surprise.We started off with a nice garden salad that was peppered with small little breaded cheese balls along with bits and pieces of pancetta.  A great start to our meal.  The next dish was PEI mussels with some leeks and garlic.  The broth was a bit salty, but when you had it with the mussels and  the toast, it was just right.The low point of the meal came in the form of the lamb dish with mushrooms which was very salty and was almost non-edible.  The lamb wasn't too bad, but we avoided the shrooms and potatoes as they seem to have sucked up all of the salt in the dish.Going from the low point, we went straight to the high point; the Ramps Risotto.  Perfect combination of onion and pepper mixed up with perfectly cook risotto.  This dish was truly a highlight of our night!We finished off the night with an order of the delicious Duck Fat Potato Croquettes that were crispy on the outside and creamy middle.  And for dessert, the Banana Bread Pudding capped off an amazing and memorable meal.I have to say, the service was fantastic.  Everyone was knowledgeable and helpful.  There wasn't a time that I had to wait very long to address any of our needs.  Overall, this was a very memorable and enjoyable dinner experience we had, especially for a Groupon deal!!"
"We had a group of 14 and did the tasting menu, which was a family style multi course meal. Everything was fantastic. They accommodated a vegetarian and served up a selection of delicious meats and vegetables to the rest of us. My personal favorites were the chicken and risotto. Great specialty cocktails and craft beer selection. The only complaint I have is there is only 1 ladies bathroom, so be prepared to wait in line :)"
"Our group ordered the tasting menu.  They had 2 options for the tasting menu: the $45 tasting course which they said had a mix of veggies, grains, and meats. Or the $50 version with more meats.  We opted for the $50 version which included:Duck fat croquettes: These were okay. Perfectly fried, but they were not all that flavorful.Mixed greens salad: The ricotta fritters were great. The bacon bits also helped make this salad tasty.Wagyu Brisket: The briskets were pretty tough but the overall flavor of the dish was good.  Also of note, we had noted to the waiter when ordering that one of our friends does not eat beef, but they still served this dish.Alaskan halibut: One of my favorites of the night! Fish was cooked perfectly and the sweetcorn and puree complemented the fish well.Risotto: A bit too lemony for my liking, but overall it was pretty good.Andouille sausage with pork loin: I liked the sausage, but didn't care too much for the pork loin.Duck egg fettuccine: The duck was very salty, but I really liked this dish regardless. The homemade fettuccine was excellent and helped to mitigate the saltiness of the duck.String beans: Basically just string beans with some sauce over it. Somewhat uninspiring.Banana bread pudding: Absolutely AMAZING. The homemade ice cream was creamy and just sweet enough and complemented the warm banana bread so well. The banana bread was nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Just amazing.Cheesecake: Fantastic and creamy. Every part of it was well-made and the raspberries were a great addition.Puppy chow: Was not expecting much from these but they were pretty good. A bit too sweet for my liking, but that's just me.Overall, I enjoyed the meal, but I'm not sure if I would say it was a $50 worthy meal."
"Great first impression, my cousin dragged me to this amazing spot. The decor is clean, open, and fresh. We ordered a few dishes and each plate was tasty.  I really enjoyed the pork belly with quinoa. The waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. My cousin stepped away from the table and the waiter came by and grab her napkin off the chair. She folded it and placed it gently on the table! Good stuff! I would go back"
"I took my husband to TWO for his birthday dinner this past Saturday night. The staff was really friendly, especially the owner, and the food was really good. We went with the restaurant week menu, and also ordered the duck fat croquettes from the lregular menu. They were delicious! Definitely one of my favorite dishes from the night. I would highly recommend them! They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, served with a side of aioli. Perfect combination! The restaurant week menu consisted of four course: soup or salad, bonus dish, main course and dessert. For the first course, I chose the soup - roasted cauliflower bisque with cured mushrooms and a ricotta crouton. It was very light and flavorful! However, the bonus course was definitely my favorite! It was sort of like a soup that consisted of a porcini polenta cake, wild mushrooms and garlic jus. I'm not sure if this is on the regular menu, but I would highly recommend it, especially for mushroom lovers. The main course I picked was sea scallops, served on a bead of sweet potato purée, a drizzle of herb vinaigrette, and rutabaga chips. The scallops were perfectly cooked, but I thought the sweet potato purée was a little bit too sweet for me. Last but not least, I ordered the dark chocolate brownie and my husband got the honey ricotta cheesecake. Both were excellent!  I'm giving TWO only four stars because they didn't do anything special (not even a candle on the dessert or a simple ""happy birthday"") for my husband. I put a note in my reservation when I made it online, and the hostess confirmed that they knew it was a special occasion when I called to check on the time the day before. I just wish they had made the dinner a little special for him. Everyone wants to feel special on their birthday! I'm not going to lie, I was disappointment."
"Two is a great place for a local, farm-to-table meal.  We went with another couple and were able to order quite a few items.  All of the meat dishes were fantastic, and definitely my favorites.  I would probably skip the shrimp and potato croquettes next time, but they were still very good.  The risotto was also great, and a very large portion.  Space is cute, and would be great for a group as the tables can be pulled together.  Prices were very reasonable for the amount and quality of food."
"Highlights:  Delicious duck pasta and great service.After seeing this restaurant on Check Please, I was determined to come for dinner to have for myself the ""creative, fun, unexpected and unpretentious"" experience.  It certainly lived up to most of those adjectives, so I hesitate to give it 3 stars.  The food was definitely good, there's no arguing that.  The real question is, was it THAT good for the price?  For me, I feel like I wouldn't come back because it was overpriced.  FOODP.E.I. Mussels, Saffron broth, leeks, grilled bread $16 - It was good, but I wasn't blown away.  My favorite mussels from a different restaurant cost less for more.Nichols Farm Brussel sprouts, Pickled red onions, roasted apples, white cheddar fondue - $10 - They were good on their own, but doesn't play well with other dishes.  I actually do like the taste of Brussels sprouts so having them so strongly seasoned with other flavors isn't my thing.Butternut squash risotto, homemade bacon, baby spinach, fresh thyme, Wisconsin parmesan+add fried duck egg - $20 - I like the creativity of this dish.  It was good, but I wouldn't order it again because it's just risotto.Homemade duck egg fettuccine, Duck confit, duck skin cracklins, scallions, parmesan $17 - My favorite of the night.  The pasta was chewy, which I like, nicely seasoned and slightly greasy.  Pumpkin bread pudding, Salted bourbon caramel, homemade ice cream $7 - It was good.  The bread pudding was denser that what I was expecting but the ice cream was fantastic and I wish there was more of it.Service:  Excellent!  The host greeted us and seated us promptly.  Our waiter asked if we have been to the restaurant before, explained the menu, was attentive and informative.  My water glass never went empty.Attire: Causal, jeans and t-shirt will do just fine.Parking:  There are paid parking on Grand and free parking on side streets (e.g. May).  I came on a Sunday night and parking was really easy to find."
"We oohed and ahhed over literally every bite of food here.While I've participated in Restaurant Week with varying degrees of consistency during the five odd years that I've lived in Chicago, it wasn't until this year that Chef Week was really on my radar. I'd heard it mentioned before but never bothered to partake. This year, with my departure from this great city on the horizon, I figured it was time to strike.How we got from there to TWO was actually a complete crapshoot. I looked at the list of restaurants participating in Chef Week and randomly chose one that had its menu up that early (this was several weeks before the actual event). The TWO menu looked pretty intriguing to me, so I sent it to a friend and we made a reservation for a Friday night dinner.The Chef Week dinner at TWO was a $44 prix fixe menu with four courses. Both of us were sure of what we wanted for the first and third courses, which happened to be the same two dishes - a warm asparagus salad and a duck-egg pasta with pork ragú sauce respectively - but were torn over the second and fourth courses. We decided to get one of each for those two courses and split both. For the second course, this meant one serving each of the gulf prawns and the Slagel Farms suckling pig. For the fourth (dessert), it was the banana bread pudding and the honey ricotta cheesecake.I can very honestly say that there wasn't a single thing I ate that wasn't delicious. For someone who's usually pretty allergic to vegetables (not actually), the asparagus salad was awesome - so flavorful and with a nice char on the stalks themselves. The second course was one of our favorites - both the prawns and the pork were amazing. I wasn't sure what to expect with the suckling pig since they don't specify exactly what cut of pork it is, but it turns out that they used my two favorites - the shoulder and the belly. The duck-egg pasta had perfect texture and cook, and the sauce was really tasty as well. And finally, the banana bread pudding was by far my favorite of the two desserts - warm and cinnamony and with a scoop of ice cream on the side (I like all my desserts a la mode!) - though the cheesecake was nice as well.Portion sizes were also very reasonable - I was pretty stuffed by the end of the meal. Service throughout the meal was super friendly and helpful - food came out quickly, pacing was good, and servers were easily reachable but didn't hover over us. The ambiance of the restaurant is also really nice: kind of rustic and cozy but still plenty of space (there are so many restaurants these days crammed into tiny spaces where you can barely walk in between the tables... I'm sure you know the feeling).It's actually been quite a while since I ate at a restaurant that really knocked it out of the park. TWO was one of these experiences."
"Although this review was long overdue. I felt that it would be an injustice not to post. My husband and I went to this restaurant for our 23rd anniversary. We had purchased a Groupon (in a quest to save money). So there was a bit of trepidation about how it would be. However surprised we were!The staff was very attentive from the moment that we entered the restaurant. In fact the manager greeted us both and shook our hands. He then led us to the main dining room. We had a table near the window so that we can people watch!Then began our four course tasting menu. Each course out doing the previous. After the four courses came a lovely dessert!  And to top it off, a full bottle of wine! I definitely would recommend this restaurant. And if you can get a Groupon, it's even a better deal."
"We grouponed and the service and food are both great. I have to repeat: the service is so good, warm, friendly but not too much. The only thing is about the groupon: it includes a bottle of wine and we are not really drinking people and so it's a little bit of a waste"
"Two is fantastic! I've been there twice and the first time it was the best meal of the year. The second time was really good, but not great. We did the chef's menu and the food options are endless. We had chicken, fish, steak, duck fat croquettes, salad, mussels, risotto, green beans AND two desserts. My stomach was in a happy place albeit I needed a wheelbarrow to take me home. I left happy and stuffed. The chicken was hands down the best dish and one that I'm still talking about today...I will definitely be going back"
"I've been there a couple of times and I've never been disappointed. The menu changes seasonally and the food is fresh and well seasoned. On top of the great food, the cocktail selections is great. They recommend to share entrees tapas style. I'm not big on sharing, but the portion sizes are large enough to share with another person. Staff is great and bright and open atmosphere in the dining area."
"Props to my friend for randomly deciding to make a reservation here for Chef Week way in advance. But I'm so glad she did because the menu was amazing. Once she asked me if I wanted to join her for a Friday night dinner, I looked at the menu a few days before and struggled to decide which of the two options I wanted for each course and continued to struggle up until we actually ordered. We ended up both getting the asparagus salad and the duck egg pasta for the first and third course, but ordered one each of the gulf prawn and suckling pig (second course), and the banana bread pudding and honey ricotta cheesecake (fourth course). The portion sizes were great, especially for a Chef Week/Restaurant Week type menu and each dish had a wonderful mix of flavors and textures that I don't know how to describe other than using words like amazing and tasteful. I personally loved the prawns, suckling pig and the banana bread pudding the most but that's definitely more of a personal taste preference rather than how the dishes were. Definitely loved it here and want to come back to try out many of the options on the full menu."
"Ok, I've been a yelp member since 2011 and every time I go somewhere really good or really bad I always say...Oh man I'm gonna yelp em!  Well the day has finally come...yes TWO was so bad it sparked me to write my very first yelp review.I live in the area and like to try new walk able places so I was excited to go here.The gentleman that greeted us was super nice and shook all of our hands as he welcomed us in which was impressive, we thought wow this place is great...it all went down hill from there.First off I didn't realize it was a small dish share type place, my group of four were not in the mood for sharing so we each ordered 2 dishes with one ordering 3.  They let you know that the food will come out as it's prepared but the service was sloooow and the pace of the dishes were awkward with one person not getting any of their food until last.  Onto the food itselfMarket Salad--just a plain salad on a tiny plate nothing special, I can make a better salad at home, the only good thing about the salad were the delicious tiny ricotta fritters, actually the ricotta fritters were the only delicious thing I tasted here and there were only 3 of them on the salad, go figureAlaskan Halibut--a child size sample for $21 on a tiny plate btw everything here is a tiny portion served on a tiny plate.  The fish itself was ok but the corn puree it was prepared with was overpowering and not tasty.  I would rather pay double for a normal size Halibut filet that tasted amazing. Wagyu Brisket--$20...really? A small chunk of meat with no flavor, a little tough, lots of fat marbling.  I could buy a good quality brisket at whole foods for $6.99LB throw it in a crock pot with a little seasoning that would blow this away and I could feed a few people off of it. Duck Fat Croquettes--basically tasted like boxed mashed potatoes deep friedAmish Chicken--was probably the best tasting of anything ordered but it was just a plain piece of chicken, yes it was juicy but flavor was minimal and nothing special.The Tri-Tip--was ok, a little chewySuckling Pig--yuck, after tasting we actually didn't eat this Oh and of course there are the green beans that were so bad we sent them back, that came out last...yes last you would think hmmm green beans probably don't take that long to make why would they come out last? We even asked, the server said because the sauce is spicy they serve it last so it doesn't overpower the other food.  Interesting we all just sat there in awe contemplating that one.  Anyway the best taste description of these are frozen microwaved green beans mixed with some store bought bottled szechuan sauce.  On a positive note the bottle of wine we ordered was great, although we waited for what seemed like forever for it.  I'm completely surprised there are so many positive reviews; I have absolutely no idea how this place stays in business.  Out of 4 people we all thought it was a bust and a ruin of a Friday night dinner.  $230 later we left sadly disappointed and hungry."
I went here almost a year ago for the tasting menu. I have to say it was pretty forgettable. My neighbors food looked more interesting. This review has been sitting in draft for almost a year because I just didn't have anything good to say. I wanted to like Two but it was just not happening. Kinda like the last guy I went out with.
"I'm writing this review as I sit waiting for our check for two reasons. 1. I'm devoted to YELP 2. I'll forget what I had by the time I get home due to the underwhelming experience. Duck fried croquette-good, Beet salad-excellent, salmon-over cooked, brisket-skip or order with a gallon of water because you'd think Morton Salt company owns some shares here with the amount of salt in this small dish, duck egg risotto-delicious, dessert, skip the bread putting because it's like eating bread with ice cream. No flavor at all. With that said, waiter was wonderful, intelligent, knew his stuff, friendly and made jokes which we love.I was excited for this place based on reviews, but as a foodie whose eaten at a lot of similar, tapa/small plate trendy establishments, this places is average and classifies as good in my book but not great in any way."
"In an area of great elaborate restaurants, this simple one was one of our favorites. It's very midwestern farm focused. Interesting but comforting homey dishes. We got potato croquettes (mild but very good), green beans (good, a bit spicy), duck fettuccine (good), and brisket (great). We also got banana bread budding and puppy chow for dessert which were both really good too, especially the puppy chow. The place is a nice mix of classy but casual and unpretentious. This is one I could see coming back to repeatedly."
"I came to TWO with four other girlfriends.  It was the start of a Bachelorette evening.  We elected to all do the Chef's Tasting Menu for $50/person so that we could try a lot of things and didn't have to come to mutual decisions.  It was definitely the right way to go for our group.  They accommodated our requests of not a lot of pork for one guest, gluten items on the side for another, and no cilantro for another.  We ate salads, tri-tip steak, peanut green beans, mussels, roasted amish chicken, cheesecake, and bread pudding.  All was delicious!  There wasn't a thing we didn't like.  Our server wasn't real lively, but she got the job done.  She, as well as the workers who brought out our food, were pretty soft spoken so sometimes it was tough to get a full description of what we were about to eat.  The space was comfortable. I'd go back next time I'm in town, for sure."
"Excellent service. I mean, I know you get what you pay for but lately I've had so many bad experiences with service that this place was doing something right. Food was excellent. Perfect sizes to share with one other person. Pricy in my opinion, but worth it. Only complaint was the lighting was inconsistent. Was very dim at some tables and bright at others; we had to use flashlights which is kinda not cool. I will come back fa sur."
"The food was delicious and very flavorful but very disappointed by the hassle my table of 9 got because we didn't want to do the chefs dinner. Not only did the server mention it to us twice but the general manager came over and mentioned it to us again. We understood it may be easier for the kitchen to do that but what about what the customer wants. They questioned every order because they thought we wouldn't have enough, but we ate exactly what we wanted. Felt very awkward the rest of the meal.All of us gave Two, two stars."
"Fantastic place for mid-west small plates.  The atmosphere is relaxing and lively.  The food is always amazing.  I recommend the duck fat croquettes, halibut, and bread pudding.  Highly recommended."
"I've been here 3 times now and it has never disappointed. Food tastes fresh and on point in flavors. Don't miss their duck-fat croquettes, their mussels and their salad. The service was very attentive. Their concept is tapas-sized portions so each person will probably need to order 2-3 plates to get full."
"My fellow pregnant friend and I tried this place out for Restaurant Week last month, so I can only comment on the food and not the drinks.  We were seated immediately for our early reservation.  Everyone from the host to the our server and the waitstaff were very friendly and welcoming.We both decided to go for the tasting menu and got the exact same appetizer and entree but different desserts.  The cauliflower soup was delicious and perfect for the cold wintry day.  The Berkshire pork entree was good, but nothing special.  Props for using Berkshire pork though!  It came with two thinly sliced pork cuts, which was likely equivalent to one whole cut of regular pork.  Dessert was my favorite part because I tried the awesome Chocolate Brownie with the homemade Nutella ice cream, graham cracker toffee, and toasted marshmallow.  The toffee was crunchy and contrasted well with the chewy brownie and marshmallow.  My friend is allergic to Nutella so she had the Ricotta Cheesecake, which she said was good, but not exceptional.  It was great to sample what TWO has to offer via the tasting menu."
"We went here as our one and only Restaurant Week destination. There were many contenders for our new restauant adventure night, but this appeared on Check Please as we were making reservations elsewhere. After hearing the raving reviews, we had to change up the plan and head to TWO. From the phone reservations to the friendly farewell as we left, five star experience all the way around. We were slightly early for our reservations so we hit up the bar. I had a hard time choosing from the cocktail menu, but in the end, I always judge a bar by it's Old Fashioned (namely looking for a good ice cube) so I had to start there. Yes, yes, yes! Got my sphere ice cube and the rest of the beverage was just as swell! The greeter/owner was overtly friendly and warm. Space was trendy and quaint - we learned that there were two reasons the restaurant was named TWO: 1) all of the decor and interior furniture has been re purposed and 2) there are two chefs. Both were good calls. Decor was comforting but on point with what's cool and the food was outstanding. We had the following:Cauliflower BisqueBeet SaladScallopsPork ChopBrownieRicotta CheesecakeIt was all good. All of it was ""lick your plate"" worthy. Brownie was a bit much for me, but I'm not a huge chocolate fan. The cheesecake, however; was the most wonderful consistency. I make cheesecake at home from time to time and can't wait to alter my recipes to include ricotta. Thanks, TWO!"
"Delicious tapas style meals.  If you are hungry you will pay quite a bit to get filled up, but the food is defiantly worth  it.  The Duck Fat Potato Croquettes were amazing, i could eat them for every meal.  I recommend 5 small plates to share between 2 ppl.  The decor was elegant and homey.. quite literally homey.  There was a wall decorated with a white picket fence and another that had siding.  It sounds strange but it really works.  Makes the place very warm and inviting.  Its a trendy spot and you would feel comfortable in a dress shirt and jeans or a nice T-shirt.. just dont get too casual.  Great for a date."
My new favorite restaurant! Everything we ate was AMAZING. This place is a must try.
"Wonderful Experience! My hubby, 13 month old and I went here for Father's Day today. It was a great choice.. I was told. We are foodies so it's always a challenge to find a new resturant we've never been to. So the pressure was on. I did great!Cool vide, strive was excellent! They were extremely attentive to our 13 month old! Food was amazing! We did the chefs tasting and it was superb !They don't have a kids menu (not really a kids resturant) but we have a kiddie foodie already so he was fine. They also don't have a kids cup with straw, so just bring your own. Our 13 month old loved loved the risoto and the bananna bread pudding! :)We will be back.Thanks TWO for a wonderful evening!"
"The reason I'm downgrading from 5 to 4 stars on my second review is the service. The staff was still friendly but not as attentive as last time. I'm not sure if maybe this is because we were using the Groupon deal but even if that's the case it's unacceptable to treat customers differently. Usually the purpose of a groupon is to get new customers coming back. Not once did the server ask how the meal was. I asked for a lemon twice and it never came. It also felt like we were being pressured to order additional food, which we ended up doing but was completely unnecessary. Their service wasn't bad by any means, just not up to par after my first dining experience here 2 weeks earlier. Now on to the food...I'm gonna start with dessert because the ricotta cheesecake was probably the best I've ever had. Definitely failed last time not ordering this! The texture is so soft and light it like a sweet little cloud. The honey complimented it perfectly and of course you have to strawberries and whipped cream in cheesecake. Dreams now consist of the Duck Egg Fettucine and Ricotta Cheesecake!! Rabbit with mushrooms spinach and fingerling potatoes. I loved this! Flavor was great, rabbit was well cooked and tender, not as gamey as rabbit can sometimes be. The only issue here was that with the groupon we didn't get to chose what we ordered. When the server asked if there was anything we didn't eat, my friend told her based on the menu items. This was a daily special and not a regular menu item so she didn't know it could be served. She doesn't eat rabbit. I offered to ask for a different dish but she isn't the type to want to complain and bring attention to herself. So I ate rabbit for two!Grass fed Tri Tip with slaw- perfectly cooked! We both enjoy a good steak, but aren't huge steak lovers. We certainly enjoyed this! The zucchini (i think) slaw was wonderful and had a unique texture with great complimenting flavors. Whatever bits of crispyness were on the meat was delightful! The Market Salad, Squash blossoms, and Duck Egg fettucine were all in my first review! Squash blossoms and duck fettuccine are MUST haves."
"Some days are rainbows, puppy chow, and the very best mussels in red sauce you've ever had... and some days you biff it and accidentally ingest a portion of a cat chemo pill, break out in a gnarly rash on the top half of your body, and feel nauseous as all get-up.Today was 50/50 both of those scenarios for me, but I'd already gone through the effort of showering and putting on make-up, so chemo rash or no chemo rash I was making my damn dinner reservation time. Regrets? Mehhh... I'm still alive at the moment, so for as long as that holds true I have to say I think it was worth it.I'd made reservations for dinner for myself and my Dad at 7:00 on Wednesday evening and we started with a few cocktails, including TWO's take on a Moscow Mule, only theirs is playfully named after Russia's own Pussy Riot (Neon Balaclava). Throughout the night we also partook in the Wet Hound (Great), Austrian Margarita (OK), and a Rosa from Revolution (Always Delicious).I was told by several friends that both the food and the service here were phenomenal but by the end of the meal I think I could really only agree with one of those being true. It wasn't that our server was bad, but the overall vibe was unfriendly, I felt. I dined with my Dad and we're pretty fun people, not stiff in any sense but our server seemed distracted and had the general vibe of a guy who had better plans for the evening but then got called in to work. At the tail end of our meal things did perk up when he brought a complimentary dessert wine digestif, but otherwise, I was a little bummed to not get the rave service experience that a number of my friends had gushed about. Even, when we walked in and weren't really sure where to go because the host stand wasn't right up front, we walked across the first dining room and just waited while the bartender side-eyed but said nothing until one of the guys who ended up being our bus boy sat us. When we left it was the same deal. Empty up front and the bartender side eyeing us but saying nothing... so that was odd given all the great things I'd heard.Our meal was exactly as friends had warned: Outstanding! We ordered (of course) probably more than we should have, but we finished everything less the puppy chow, which we'd preemptively ordered to take home.Here's the run down:// Klug Farms Asparagus Salad // asparagus, celery, pea shoots, smoked salmon, poached potatoes, fish sauce aioli - $11-- I kind of just ordered this for the heck of adding another pescetarian--friendly dish and it ended up being one of my favorites. It's a lot more interesting than you'd think from the description. The salad is perfect if you crave salty things (I always do) and you can think of the smoked salmon as thick, salmon bacon with that extra meaty, jerky-like flavor.  // Roasted Broccoli & Cauliflower // sauteed red onion, chile flake, aged white cheddar fondue - $8-- We chowed down and it was delish, but not a standout among the rest of our meal.// Banger Island Mussels // San Marzano tomatoes, shaved fennel, absinthe, grilled bread - $16-- GET THIS. Get this. Get this. Get this. The best I've ever had and that grilled bread and sauce?! F*ck. Why is it so good?// Roasted Alaskan Halibut // halibut, asparagus, pickled red onion, shiitake mushrooms, broccoli puree, toasted pecan pesto - $22-- GET THIS. It's one of the pricier items on the menu but the portion size is very fair and it's another standout that I don't believe you can find on the menu year-roud.// Ramp Risotto // homemade bacon, ramp puree, Wisconsin parmesan with a fried duck egg - $20-- VERY filling, but an excellent menu choice. Absolutely splurge and get the $3 fried duck egg on top. // Puppy Chow // -$6-- This was one of the things I was most excited about, but just a little let down by. It didn't live up to my memory of this lower-middle-class girl scout delicacy. Pretty sure I know a few scout moms who make it better. // Banana Bread Pudding // Salted bourbon caramel sauce, homemade ice cream - $7-- Well, sh*******t. GET THIS. Nice portion but still (somehow) light enough to devour even after all our previous drinks and courses.// Homemade Biscuit Donut // maple ice cream, maple-Templeton rye syrup - $8-- Really delicious. Donut was very much like a tiny Krispy Kreme. I know biscuits are really hot right now, but this tasted like straight donut, no bisc to me. Still a treat that I don't regret. Overall, this was one of the better meals I've had all year and I really enjoyed the 'medium plates' concept because we were able to share everything, but nothing was embarrassingly small-portioned that we felt awkward infringing on extra bites of any one dish. The atmosphere is rustic and masculine- think Farmhouse James Bond- and I LOVED that I could get this caliber of meal while still being able to dine comfortably in jeans.I'd go back in a heartbeat... granted I don't accidentally OD from that aforementioned cat chemo sitch."
"We are visiting from California and wanted to go to a new, trendy Chicago restaurant.  We picked Two from online reviews.  Four of us arrived for our 7:00 reservation and were promptly seated.  The menu had so many great items to choose from that we were delighted to find that it was Tapas style and plates were shared, so we all got to taste several items.  We started with grilled bread with a delicious paper thin sliced Italian prosciutto, next we had Duck Fat Potato Croquettes roasted garlic aioli, wisconsin parmesan  $8, Mixed Greens Market Salad homemade ricotta fritters, hampshire bacon, cucumbers, radishes, tomatoes, grilled red onion vinaigrette  $10,Nichols Farm Squash Blossoms tempura fried, sauteed baby squash, roasted garlic aioli $15,  prawns (kind of mushy with heads on and strong flavor), Roasted Broccoli & Cauliflower sauteed red onion, chile flake, aged white cheddar fondue  $9.  Waybu brisket with bbq sauce and spinach $18?.  For dessert we shared a banana bread pudding and ice cream sandwich on snicker doodles.  The bread pudding got our vote for most delicious.  We enjoyed each course, our favorites being the croquettes, bread with prosciutto and brisket.  We also had 3 beers, a Moscow mule and. A glass of wine.  Total bill was $158.00...not bad!  Chelsea was our very sweet and professional server.  We would recommend a visit here."
"Dont get me wrong. This place is pretty good. The entrance is really awkward. You walk through the door and there is this huge heavy curtain you have to walk through.  Now listen here, if i had a few cocktails that thing would have swallowed me whole and i may never have gotten out.  Then there is a bar, do i talk to the bar tender? Who sits us?  She directed us kindly to the host to the left of the entrance he shook our hands, made us feel really comfortable from there on.Had a seat with a cool sightline into the kitchen. Waitress was really attentive and nice and informed us about the portion sizes.  They recommend 5 to 6 dishes for two people. The food is awesome, taste amazing. But they are very small and pretty expensive.  With a few cocktails this can be a seriously expensive time.  Id rather spend that money and go get really full elsewhere. Duck fat croquettes (good)Duck egg fettucini(wish i had a huge bowl of this then nap)Arctic char (i dont do fish, but was awesome)Puppy chow (addictive)CheesecakeFor the money though, im not sure if id be back.  Doesnt take anything away from the service or quality of food"
"I loved everything about TWO!  We met some friends in the city for dinner and decided on TWO after seeing the ""Check Please"" episode.  Everything they said about this place on the show is true.  I felt a good neighborhood vibe the minute we walked in (and found street parking right in front - score!), we sat at the bar and had a drink while we waited for our table.  The bartender was friendly and answered questions about their extensive wine and cocktail menu - one of the drinks had a round ice ball which looked interesting.  I ordered a Manhattan and my husband ordered a drink with a fruit cube in it made with gin that was fabulous - so far, TWO is on a roll.We were seated at our table and greeted by the friendliest and most attentive wait-staff I have experienced at a city restaurant.  They explained the menu and the concept of smaller portions intended for sharing (reminded me of ""Girl and the Goat"" but without the pretentious attitude).  We started out with the Beet Salad and a few items and then ordered more. Here's a run-down of our choices...NIcholas Farm Golden Beet Salad +++++ so fresh, delicious and a portion size big enough for four people to shareP.E.I. Mussels ++++ delicious plate overflowing with mussels and grilled bread that was perfect for soaking up the amazing broth (one of our top TWO dishes of the evening).Bershire Pork Kalbi Loin Chops ++++ the flavor of this pork was unbelievable and the side of cauliflower was tasty enough to prompt us to order more.Aged Grilled Hangar Steak ++++ tender, juicy and full of flavor.Black Truffle Risotto +++++ this was my favorite dish (topped with a fried duck egg), it was creamy, and the egg melted into the rice and the subtle flavors merged beautifully.  I would come back to TWO for this dish alone.Duck Egg Fettucine +++ I had high hopes for this dish and while everyone at our table thought it was tasty - I felt it lacked flavor and was a bit dry.We also had a duck dish that I can't recall the name of - duck is not my favorite so after a small taste I passed on a bigger bite.  For dessert we ordered the Puppy Chow and Gingerbread Pudding and enjoyed them both.  The ambiance in TWO is comfortable and inviting with several big tables - great for large groups.  We had a wonderful ""first"" time at TWO will visit again and again."
"An incredible dining experience. My husband and I both put this meal as our top 3 memorable meals ever. Excellent meal, service, and very reasonable priced for the quality! Our server Dimitri was really cool and the owner also popped by and spoke with us a couple of times, and we ended up watching the last bit of the Miami-San Antonio basketball game with them at the bar between dinner and dessert!Where to start? You must try the pork belly pastrami and the duck leg confit. We even placed a 2nd order of the pork belly pastrami, it was that good! They don't have hot plates so the meals come out when ready. Everything was great, the salad, halibut, duck egg fettuccine (wow!). But...Let me tell you about the half chicken...it...was...amazing...and just kept getting better. A crisp skin with a juicy centre.  Even the white meat was so moist! At the end of the meal, I really wanted to order the banana bread pudding based on yelp reviews but also decided to get the ricotta cheesecake since they make their ricotta in house! I ate most of both...but it was so worth it! We bought the kitchen staff a six pack of beer and the chef (Brian) came out to chat with us while we picked his brain on got some tips on how to cook such an incredible meal. What a great guy and so passionate about his work. Love to see that!The 4 of us had a 7pm reservation on Sunday night and closed the place down at about 11pm feeling utterly satisfied.Next time we are in Chicago Two will be a must!"
"This place should be called Bacon. Nearly everything we ate had bacon on it or in it. If you like bacon, good for you. If you don't, bad for you. I don't like bacon- bad for me. I came to use a four course tasting groupon with a friend and the server did ask us if we had any allergies to any foods, because the chef chooses your dishes. Maybe I should have mentioned bacon, but then what would they have served us? I really liked the wine that came with our meal- I selected the pinot noir. I wish I had taken a picture of the label so I would know to get it again. The atmosphere and service were nice too- intimate and classy.The first course was salad, with bacon on it. The second course was fish, encrusted in bacon. The third course was fried chicken- delicious- no bacon. The fourth course was risotto with bacon in it.  The dessert was an apple pie cheesecake- no bacon- and was good. Really, everything was good, I just think it would have been better without the bacon. Hasn't bacon been overdone? It's such an overwhelming flavor that it kills the rest of the seasonings and herbs. And if you like bacon, you don't really have to like anything else on the plate, because you will like the dish for the bacon itself. I just think it's kind of a cop out. How many times can I write the word bacon in one review?"
"Here is my issue with TWO:  TWO is kind of a one-trick pony.My husband and I came here on a Sunday night after he returned from a biz trip.  We were on time for our reservation, but it took a few minutes for us to be a seated.  Restaurant seemed busy and pretty full--although, this is to be expected the week after they aired on check please.  The food:  Here is what I mean when I say one-trick pony.  The food is good, but it's the same thing over and over and over again.  Everything we ate (and much of what we saw on the menu) involved some combination of:(1) parmesan cheese(2) duck / duck fat(3) mushrooms(4) salt salt salt(5) bacon / pork bellyThis is just fine (good, even) for a dish or two, but overall, the meal felt heavy and unbalanced.  It was a lot of fat and salt, even on dishes that we ordered to be lighter (the brussels and the scallops, for example).  Perhaps this is part of the problem of being tethered to only fresh ingredients (which were great, don't get me wrong), but we left the meal craving some brightness and acidity in our food.  My husband also commented that he felt that the individual components on the dish were fine on their own, but didn't seem to taste as good eaten together (his example, the pork belly + parsnip puree).  They also were out of the mussels by the time we got there (not too late-- 7:30), which was a bummer.The space is very attractive, and the wine list looked great and not too outrageously expensive.  I'm still on the fence as to whether or not we will be back--for the cost, we wanted a meal that was more complex and less one-note.  Overall, though, the meal was just fine, a bit heavy, and I would suggest it for those who really want to indulge.  Maybe not again for a while, though, unless things brighten and lighten up a little bit."
"Match made in Heaven - I can't wait for round Two here. The chefs (Two of them) and I must be on the same page, because everything on their menu is something I like. If you too like complex flavors with an often meaty, creamy, American twist, you will love Two. Excellent wait staff and attentive service. Someone shook my hand when I stepped in the restaurant. Despite the quality and creativity of the food, the decor and environment is not overly pretentious like Michelin-rated restaurants in this city often are. The only thing remotely negative about this restaurant is it may be difficult to get to for some. The 65 bus or the Blue line Grand stop are the public transit methods of choice to get here."
"Enjoyed our meal here and shared a few different dishes.  Menu had some standard favorites (i.e. a steak option, a goat cheese salad, risotto, salmon) in addition to some that are more unique.  I like the farm to table concept which is executed well.  My favorite by far was the pumpkin bread pudding which inspired me to (try to) make my own version for the holidays.  Definitely a neighborhood gem with street parking available for those that comes from a bit further out."
Had an amazing business dinner with clients.  The service at this spot is amazing.  Everyone works together and you can ask for more than that.  The owner came to the table and was super nice. Now on to the best part - the amazing food.  The dishes are pretty much tapas style.  We tried 8 different dishes between 4 people.  Out of all the dishes we couldn't figure out what we liked the best.  It was nice to see farm to table.  The chef made amazing dishes.  The fettuccine was one of my faves.Desert was amazing as well.  Banana bread pudding... Wow!Check this place out-  you won't be disappointed at all.  I can't wait to get back to Chicago.
"Great service. Our waitress was real knowledgable on wines to help us choose wines we would like. The bacon jam was great.  Tastes like a textured pate/mousse.  A bit salty if you don't have something to pair or wash it down with. Duck fettuccine was spectacular.   The texture of the pasta was sublime. Ask for extra duck cracklings. The Amish chicken was relatively larger portion.  Excellent texture. Not overcooked/undercooked.  The skin was crispy/salty...just the way I like it.  Though I've had better elsewhere, I would definitely consider ordering this again. The lamb belly was good.  My wife loved it.  Wagyu beef sooo tender and so much flavor. Banana bread pudding: we finished it on 2 breaths."
"Two was just too good. The potato bombs are just as amazing as others have said. If they have the heirloom tomato salad, this is a great way to lighten up the meal. The standout was the duck breast fettuccine. Perfectly cooked duck breast, al dente and fresh fettuccine, and duck skin cracklins. Two is chill, down to earth and a great place for dinner away from the hustle and bustle."
"A delightful experience from start to finish. I don't live in Chicago, but I plan to return here when I'm back in town.First, it goes without saying that the service is impeccable. Warm and friendly but not fake. Attentive but not overbearing. The pace of the meal was exactly right, and we never felt like we were being encouraged to rush along.I came here with my mom on a rainy Sunday night. We snagged a last-minute 5 pm reservation and came into a mostly empty restaurant. We ended up order four dishes and a dessert. All were strong, but a couple felt just a bit off to me (I found the ramp risotto a bit overwhelmingly rampy (probably my fault for ordering)) and the asparagus salad to be delicious but not spectacular. In contrast, a bone marrow and ham/onion appetizer with grilled break was out-of-this-universe good, and the wagyu brisket was probably the best I've had. For dessert we had a ridiculously sinful chocolate chip blondie, which was perfect in every way except they went a teensy bit overboard with the salt. All this plus a glass of syrah for $112 including tax and tip. Overall, an excellent meal. I hope to return very soon."
"Kicking my self for not eating at TWO sooner since they've been open for a few years now. Hands down one of the best meals I've had in a long time. To start we ordered the Duck Fat Potato Croquettes, Nichols Farm roasted cauliflower, Manila Clams, the Suckling Pig special with braised pork belly on top and finally the Chocolate Brownie....I can not wait to come back again and try everything on their menu."
"We came here with the Groupon as others have mentioned.  My first impression was excellent- I was greeted with a handshake even though we were extremely late for our reservation (I did call to let them know).  I loved the vibe of this place, sort of earthy and very comfortable. Service was great. Our server was all over it. We enjoyed almost all of the dishes: the mixed green salad with these amazing fried cheese balls, jumbo prawns (with heads attached- watch out!), and a nice pork belly dish. Then came the ramp risotto. Our server asked if we had heard of ramps and we both shook our heads no and looked a bit confused. She described them as being wild onions with a strong onion/garlic flavor. Then I grew concerned. After all, it was a friday night and I didn't want to taste onions all night. Our faces should've tipped her off that ramp risotto wasn't our thing, but the dish came out anyway. My husband thought it was horrendous. While I thought it was tasty and enjoyed the bright green hue, I could not eat my fair share of the dish out of fear of the after-stench. All in all, I really liked this place, but ramp risotto is a polarizing dish to serve to people who have no say in the matter. Perhaps they could offer an alternative to future diners."
"I don't like pasta. The duck egg fetteccini changed my life. It is mind blowing delicious.  So rich and flavorful, the noodles are chewy and so toothsome, just amazing.Potato croquettes: MUST GET!!!! You can really taste the duck fat and it is addictive. We had some snacks before we got to dinner and despite that, ate way too much.The charcuterie plate is delicious, the homemade pimento cheese is outstanding, I've never had one I like this much. P.s. you HAVE to get the pork belly. People say this all the time...but literally the pork melts, melts melts meltsssss!!!!! There's only about 4 pieces of cured shiitake mushrooms so don't expect too much but the two huge pieces of pork belly is out of this world. Drinks are amazing here too. Love the New Style and the Sake cocktail. They have a great beer menu and I'd definitely getting one of the flights. It's great that the chef picks for you and you can't go wrong with it. A night filled with delicious food, way too much cocktail and beer is the only way I will spend my birthday.p.p.s. BUY THE KITCHEN A ROUND!!!!! Any place that offers, you MUST take them up on it.  The kitchen more than deserves it."
"Went there on a Friday night with a Groupon and a last minute reservation. It was half empty aount 8.30pm(that is the good thing of being European in the US, You can always find a spot in a restaurant at the time you want to have dinner :-) )Anyway, the Groupon dinner came with dishes picked for you. But, since my boyfriend does not like cheese, they adjusted the dishes. That was nice! - Mixed greens SALAD with Bacon: It was reaally really delicious and a good way to start a dinner! - Salmon: a nice piece of fish beautifully cooked! Moist! - Fettuccine with duck: As an italian I was very skeptical about this dish but believe it,it stood out! The fettuccine were slightly overcooked for me but the crispiness of the duck was amazing and overall a very nice flavor in your mouth! -Donut with vanilla icecream: My favorite! I cannot explain how many more I could have eaten... It was soo good. The donut was crunchy and warm. The icecream was soft and not too sweet! The best! Please, ask for it if you go there! - We placed and extra order of mussels (because I love mussels and I could eat tons of them...). But, I didnt like them very much! there was too much tomato sauce that was covering the mussles. Not the best for sure! Moreover, the Groupon came with a entire bottle of wine that we brought home! We could not drink all of it without getting wasted! But, it was nice that they offered to bring it home. Overall, a nice experience. I think I will go back to try other dishes even without a Groupon!"
Must haves:Drink: New Style...old fashioned but notFood: Bison Carpaccio...where the buffalo roam...in ItalyDessert: Puppy Chow...nothing like a throwback thursday on a friday nightService was great and food delivery was timed perfectly. My only suggestion would be add some more starch to the menu aside from the cavatelli (which was good).  When your drinks pack that kinda punch you need a little something heartier.
"This review is two months in the making. I kept forgetting to complete the review, but I assure you I remember the experience.My husband and I made reservations for a special Christmas Eve dinner since we would not be able to spend Christmas together (he's an amazing fireman). We were seated immediately for our reservation at 6:00 pm. At that time the restaurant was quiet but soon became busy.When we walked in we were a little confused as there was seating to the left and a bar in front of us but the host stand was past the seating/bar area to the left. No biggie, but if it were busier it may have been more confusing. The dining area was very relaxing with a clean look. I found the lighting unique. The bathrooms are also very stylish and clean.We both started out with a handmade cocktail. My husband chose a bourbon based cocktail and I chose a tequila based cocktail, both very well made and different from my usual gin and tonic.We began our festive dinner with the beet salad and mussels. The beet salad was very fresh and the dressing was light and flavorful. The mussels smelled amazing. The garlic bread that accompanied the mussels was the perfect mix of warm, soft and a little crusty. We debated finishing the broth like a bowl of soup, it was that good.We then moved on to the ""dinner"" portion of the evening, accompanied by a glass of wine for me and a beer for my husband. We shared the black truffle risotto, duck egg fettuccini, and scallops. The duck egg fettuccini was by far my favorite. The duck was melt in your mouth amazing. The risotto was the perfect blend of creamy with a good bite to the rice. The scallops were clean and cooked perfectly. My husband really enjoyed his beer (stout).For dessert we, well I, had the banana bread pudding. I was in love. I am a HUGE fan of bread pudding and love bananas, how could this go wrong? The restaurant also provided us a glass of sparkling wine with our dessert, which was very much appreciated.After dinner we moved to the bar to enjoy an after dinner drink. We both had a glass of Eagle Rare while we had the opportunity to talk to the bartender. She was extremely nice and explained some of the handmade cocktails and the concept. Very cool.Our overall experience at TWO was wonderful. The staff was very attentive and polite. The food was a great mix of fresh, clean flavors. TWO also has the opportunity to buy a six pack for the kitchen. To show our appreciation for our special holiday dinner we made sure to 2 six packs for the kitchen. If you enjoy your meal as much as we did, it's nice to show your appreciation."
"I enjoyed a wonderful meal at Two.  This is an example of a restaurant where a seasonal menu works really well and actually utilizes seasonal and local ingredients.  The service was also excellent and the staff seemed genuinely pleased to have us as customers, which is not often the case.  Foodwise: The salmon with local corn was amazing.  There is nothing like homegrown midwestern in season corn.  The sirloin was also great and again, accompanied by some amazing corn.  The best item we consumed was the banana bread pudding: just an excellent rendition of bread pudding, great texture and perfect sweetness A+.I'd highly recommend Two as a great alternative to some of the more faddy and difficult to get in Chicago restaurants.  You will not be disappointed."
"Just wanted to say that this restaurant has become our favorite in the West side, indeed, any side of town.The meat and seafood is **always** top class, the servers very helpful and we have eaten everything on offer and do not get bored with it.Keep up the good work Two"
"Although it was a bit empty inside, I thought that the service was spot on, the food was pretty damn tasty and the look of the restaurant was quite nice. I am a fan! The banana bread pudding was AMAZING. Order it, if that is your sort of thing. Also, the halibut was pretty freaking delish. Yum yum yum. I give this place 4.5 stars. I wish it was a bit more lively, but I guess on a positive note, it just made the restaurant more intimate and more personalized service."
Service was great and drinks were spot on but the food was far too salty (and I like salt)!
"Surprised this place is 4.5 stars. It was a fine establishment but not a single dish was worth writing home (or on yelp) about. On the plus side, it was relatively easy to make a same day reservation online for later in the evening and there was some open seating at the bar."
"Honest I never write a reviews but, 8 of us, as we got up from the table the conciseness was NEVER AGAIN, over cooked under cooked over priced and they call this American Tapes, I'm thinking ,maybe its time to stop killing pigs and eat more veg, never again."
The great bar staff gets them to the 4 star. They are great to chat with and can create an off menu cocktail to match your taste. I had been there for drinks before and was looking forward to dinner. I had tried the amazing duck fat potato croquettes before and was looking forward to dinner.I might not be enough of a foodie to appreciate what was served for dinner. The staff was great. We tried the apple risotto which was good. My friend ordered Amish Chicken (no it didn't come out with a beard or hat) which he said was average. I ordered a $24 filet which was literally 6 tiny slices of beef. I mentioned to the server that I was really disappointed in the entree and she just said thanks for the feedback.The decor is trendy industrial which I like. When I am back in the city I will come back to have a cocktail and croquettes at the bar. No more dinner.
"The ambiance, service, and food were all on point at TWO. We both really enjoyed the oyster dish (served like mussels usually are) and the cauliflower. Nothing we had was lacking though, and since they change their menu often you can expect to see a completely different selection than we did. Be adventurous! We also loved the cocktails, which were light and not too boozy (just how I like them!)"
Perfectly executed dishes that leave you happy and not stuffed. The staff is very attentive and environment is cozy.
"This place was amazing.  Great farm to table food.  Menu changes multiple times during the course of the week.  The food was very fresh and not very filling which was great.  We sat the bar and warmly welcomed by the bartender, I forget his name, so don't want to screw that up.  I am in the area once a month and I will be going back because of how the menu changes.  Drop in and give the place a try, you will not be disappointed."
"Came here for restaurant week. I was looking for a smaller, contemporary place near west town to eat and this place popped up in my search results. I saw the photos, read some reviews and though OK, let's do it. The wait staff was really awesome. Everyone was friendly and welcoming, took our coats and sat us quickly - the whole deal. Great job guys. The food was good too. For the first course we got the cauliflower bisque - so good. For the second course I had the scallops and my friend got the pork chop. Two measly little scallops compared to one ginormous pork chop. Don't get me wrong, they were both delicious (especially the puree that the scallops come in) but the difference in portion size was confusing. One was a ""small plate"", the other was an entire meal...Bonus course of the Pocini polenta cake - eh. My friend and I both agreed that by far, the best part of the meal was the dessert. Cheesecake was so. damn. good and creamy and sweet and just everything you wanted it to be. So my biggest issue with this place came at the end of our meal when someone (manager, owner?) who didn't introduce himself, came over and started talking to us...excuse me, talking exclusively to my friend only, about how we heard about the place. So, I'm thinking why is this guy not even making eye contact with me? Then I realize that he sees my friend, notably more hipster than I, and he must view my friend as his target audience. So, my friend goes ""actually he found it"" and points at me. You could hear the gears churning in the guys head as he tried not to skip a beat and act as if he cared about my opinion our interest in his restaurant. Yea, weirdo, non-hipster-looking humans like to explore new restaurants too and you should probably try to keep their business as well. My friend and I both agreed that it was a fine experience overall but it wasn't great enough to warrant a repeat visit. Oh yea, I had a couple of craft cocktails too. I could name at least 4 other cocktail bars in the city who do it better."
"I first heard about this place on Check Please! and I was immediately interested. The in-laws were visiting and finally was able to get out of the house with the hubby on a Saturday night. Boy, was I looking forward to this. I was afraid that I had already over-hyped it in my mind. Fortunately, it met my expectations and exceeded it in some areas. This place is delicious! You can tell the pride they take in their food by how nicely this place is put together. The staff are super professional and the ambiance is perfect. The place hummed with enough noise so it's lively but it's not a cafeteria. The lighting is just enough for a romantic meal but bright enough so you can see who you are eating with.I started with cocktail and went on to try there market salad, croquettas, mussels, pork loin, duck 3 ways (special of the day), and pumpkin bread pudding. The salad was very fresh and I loved the small fried ricotta fritters. You want to be a glutton and scream give me bigger fried cheese balls!!! But ultimately, it is a perfect compliment to the delicate and fresh salad. You didn't order mozzarella sticks. This is not that place. The croquettas was like eating a perfectly fried ball of mash potatoes. Except the crisp layer is perfect and the inside is just as perfect. Yup, that's the word for the croquettas, perfect. P.E.I (Prince Edward Island) if you must know, was divine. The saffron broth was just a touch creamy. The mussels themselves were plump and succulent. (You hear that Dusek's?) The bread that came with it was perfect for soaking up the broth. At first you think, that's a big side of bread but once you taste one, you silently wish they gave you the whole friggin' loaf. The server saw our empty plates with just the broth, came by, and said, ""would you like more bread for the broth"". In that moment, we knew we were tipping at least 18%.The pork loin was cooked just right so that it was nicely moist and we could taste the delicate flavor of the pork. The cauliflower side was nicely seasoned and crunchy. The off menu item was a seared duck breast with parsnips cooked with confit de canard. Fabulous! We lived in France for 6 years. So we have had plenty of confit de canard and seared duck breast. This brought back many happy memories. We really didn't have room but we ordered a dessert anyways. We had the pumpkin bread pudding. It was dense and lacked flavor. The vanilla ice cream and whipped cream helped. But it was not what we were hoping for. Overall, this place was great and I would love to go back soon to try out the rest of the menu."
"Sustainable, locally sourced and unpretentious.  I am usually skeptical about shared plate restaurants, but Two executed the concept perfectly.  As the menu changes regularly, I can't speak to how long the following dishes are on the menu, but I would be remiss if I didn't describe them to you.* Mixed greens market salad.  Ricotta fritters, bacon, grilled red onion vinaigrette.  The ricotta and the bacon were made in house.  Very balanced flavors and textures.* Duck fat potato croquettes.  Garlic aioli and Wisconsin parm.  Crispy on the outside smooth on the inside.  They nailed it.* Roasted broccoli and cauliflower with onion, chili flake and white cheddar fondue.  Roasted crisp tender and not overly seasoned.  * Pork and green garlic sausage, also made in house.  Charred sweet onions and local Melrose peppers.  * Risotto is, by all Yelp accounts, always fabulous.  Get the duck egg.  * House made ricotta cavatelli was tossed with sweet onions, bacon and parmesan and served with a poached egg.  Wow. The space is very comfortable, and the staff put me at ease immediately.  One of the owners even sat down and chatted for a bit.  I loved the fact that I could buy the chefs a 6 pack of beer to thank them personally.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit."
"Without doubt, the best meal of our visit to Chicago.  Two is a little removed from the central business and tourist district, about 1.5 miles west of the east/west divide.  The recently renovated space is a bit of an anomaly in the area.  Two offers a shared plates format of local and seasonal ingredients, prepared with imagination and sensitivity to bring out their inherent taste and seasoned in a way that enhances rather than overpowers.  Our server, Brian, was attentive and engaging, offering full explanations of the various menu items.  Given my limited knowledge of American wines, I asked him to recommend a Pinot Noir.  He brought three bottles to the table, explaining the qualities of each.  We chose the Witness Chain Saw - a scary name but a full and robust Pinot Noir.The shareable plates are served in sequence.  We started with a mixed greens market salad, featuring ricotta fritters, bacon, cucumbers and radishes.  That was followed by grilled salmon on a corn purée base, topped with green tomatoes from the chef's garden and pickled corn.  Even the skin was delicious.  Then we had roasted cauliflower and broccoli topped with a cheese fondu sauce.  The meat course was slices of pork loin on cauliflower purée with summer squash and black pepper seasoning.  We finished with a peach bread pudding.  One other dessert item was puppy chow which, we were informed, consisted of Chex cereal, mixed with chocolate and peanut butter and serve cold.  We decided to pass on that one, but Brian brought us a little sample portion anyway and I have to say that it was great.All in all, wonderful food, great service and quiet, relaxed atmosphere.  As a final plus, they have a great selection of background music.  A dining experience not to be missed."
"From the instant we walked in, we were treated like royalty.  So were our tastebuds.  I highly recommend you wander off the beaten path to TWO ... it's worth the extra bus ride.We arrived right around opening time on a Saturday.  We were promptly shown our table, and, soon after, the owner walked over.  He was funny and welcoming, and wanted to know how we'd heard about this place because ""we have a neighborhood following"" (which may have been a polite way to say ""you're obviously a tourist"").  Of course, we told him we'd found it on Yelp, and the (lack of) proximity to any typical attractions didn't dissuade us -- ""We travel for food.  It's what brought us to Chicago, after all.""With how frequently the menu changes, I can't provide any suggestions on what to order, with one exception:  try it all.  Seriously!  Every bite I ate was at least 9.5 stars out of 10.  The one caution is that the portions are quite small, even for a sharing place.  Splitting one deck leg between two people was fine; with four, it might be a bit odd.  The ramp risotto was the exception; it was hearty (and strongly-flavored) enough to share with five other people, but we licked the platter clean nonetheless.  I'd definitely recommend 2 - 3 dishes per person.Definitely get the dessert.  I didn't know happiness until I tried theirs.And after the meal, we were chatting for a bit (the restaurant wasn't full yet; they get their crowd in the 7-o'clock hour), and our waiter brought us two after-dinner-drinks, free of charge!  I have no idea what we did to deserve them, but it was a splendid surprise to end an absolutely perfect meal."
"We have never had a bad meal or experience here. From the amazing bartenders to the friendly owner and the knowledgable chefs, they do it right. The wait team are amazing and fun, the food is amazing and the drinks are perfection. The owner has an extensive knowledge of wine and will happily guide you should you need help, we keep going back as often as possible. Try the ribs and the duck fat potato croquettes, you will not be disappointed."
"Every once in awhile you find a restaurant that you would give 6 stars to if you could, and Two was that restaurant  for me.   We were in town for only two nights.  In a town like Chicago, where there is so much good food, if you have only two nights and you love your food like I do, you do some research.  You check out reviews.  Read menus.    Anticipate dinner.   Two exceeded my expectations - and I had a lot of them.  First, the restaurant buzzed on a Friday night at about 7.  I like my restaurants buzzing.  There were a few empty tables when we got there, but none that I saw when we left.  Second, our server was just great.  Very informative, helped us with the process as first-timers, all good.Third, the food.  Let me explain.  They serve dishes meant to be split amongst your table.   I love that.  More to try!  Our server suggested, since it was just the two of us, we aim for about 4 plates.  We split the charcuterie platter, the roasted broccoli and cauliflower, some sort of sausage, and ramp risotto.  Wow.  Yum.  Amazing.  All with some sort of just luscious red wine my husband picked out.  And then, quite possibly the best dessert I have ever had happened.  Biscuit doughnuts with maple ice cream.  You absolutely must eat this.  I absolutely must eat this again.  More than once.Seriously, our experience was just beyond great.  Eat here.  In a town of great restaurants, this one is worth a repeat visit."
"Nice spot.  In the famous ""up and coming"" Ukrainian Village.  Easy to find a parking spot though!Great service, really well attended to.  Food was good.  Not a creative menu but good fare.  Risotto was amazing.  Muscles in Saffron broth was also great.Enjoy the beer list and let the server pick your meal, you'll enjoy."
"I would give it 3.5 if I could. I don't think it quite makes the 4 star cut for me, but I think it deserves more than 3. I went here with my friends for one of our monthly foodie dinners and was super excited to try out a bunch of ""medium plates"". When we arrived, we were greeted by  owner who showed us to our seats. He was super friendly, so I feel bad saying this, but maybe a little too aggressive? It was a little uncomfortable. Anyway, I was a little disappointed when I looked at the menu that it was slightly different from the menu I had creeped online. I always look at the menu beforehand and some of the items I was excited to try were not there anymore (specifically the cauliflower and the asparagus salad). The menu online should be updated when the menu in restaurant is to avoid this. They suggest 2-3 dishes per person so we decided on 7 dishes for the 3 of us plus 2 desserts.Housemade Bacon Jam--Yummy, nothing spectacular, but still goodDuck fat potato croquettes--My friend told me these were just glorified tater tots but they were good! like fried mashed potatoes. The chili aioli dipping sauce was great.Shishito Peppers--These weren't on the menu online so they were a spur of the moment decision. Very flavorful. My semi-vegetarian friend loved themLamb Belly--Another spur of the moment decision.My other friend and I both thought it was pretty good. Very melty and good flavor. Semi-vegetarian friend was grossed out by it but she did like the potatoes that come with it lol.Black Pepper Cavatelli--They liked it, me not so  much. I thought the flavor was a little too intense and basillyDuck Egg Fettuccine--Delicious. As some other people have mentioned on here, I think the noodles could be a little more cooked, but that's a matter of preference.Ramp Rissotto (with fried duck egg duh)--My one friend was really excited to try this and she was disappointed that she thought it was too salty. My other friend and I both said this was our favorite dish. I loved it, definitely get the fried duck egg with it.We couldn't decide what two desserts we wanted, but we knew we didnt want puppy chow since we could make that whenever. The waitress wasn't much help when she said the puppy chow was her favorite so we just decided on the banana bread pudding and ice cream sandwich (also not on the menu online). Both were awesome. The owner came back to talk to us after our meal which was very nice. You can tell he really has a passion for what he does."
"I've been to Two two times and it never fails to impress! The menu is very creative- from the duck fat croquettes, to the risotto, to the scallops- everything is delicious. The staff is friendly and helpful. Oh and they have puppy chow for dessert :)"
Very fun and vibrant restaurant. The drinks were delicious and the menu was very interesting which made us want to order more and more. Loved it and will definitely come back
"I don't understand all the love this place has been getting.We went there on a Saturday night and the place was quite full. Clearly it is popular and one of the 'it' spots to have dinner at. The service is very friendly and helpful. Their menu is basically shared plates and there are quite a few vegetarian options available, which is always a big plus. We started with the salad with the ricotta fritters. It was a good salad with fresh ingredients and the ricotta fritters tasted great. But the ricotta fritters didn't feel like it belonged in the dish. Next we ordered the roasted purple cauliflower dish - this was great. The flavor profile was great and it was a burst of flavor in every bite. But, the dish was a tad salty. For the next dish the waitress recommended a pasta dish not on the menu. She said the chef will whip up a vegetarian pasta dish and blow your socks off. The pasta dish had purple cauliflower (again!) and mushrooms. The purple cauliflower felt a bit repetitive after the second dish. But my main problem with the dish was the salt - it was exceedingly salty. There was no sauce to the pasta dish so it was a bit on the dry side and overwhelmingly salty. For dessert we ordered the chocolate brownie and ice cream. The brownie was delicious, so was the ice cream. But the dessert didn't feel cohesive, nothing on the plate went with each other. It didn't feel decadent or luscious. There was toasted marshmallow and some graham cracker toffee on the side which all tasted great individually - but failed to work as a dish. Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed with the food in this place. I am very surprised by all the rave reviews. The atmosphere and the service is great though."
"Very cool ambiance. Not very loud. They had some great beer options. My date and I had a reservation for 6:15pm, arrived at 6:15pm and ended up waiting about 15 minutes to be seated. Not a big deal, but the host kept popping by saying it will be just a minute. So we didn't order a drink at the bar. I would have preferred they say they are waiting for a table to clear it may be 5-10 minutes and feel free to get a drink at the bar, but not the end of the world. Our server told us that everything is small plates, comes out as its finished in the kitchen and two people usually order 4-6 items. I'm a fairly big eater and always cautious about tapas and small plates being enough to satisfy. We ended up ordering 4 items (1 app, 2 entrees, 1 dessert) and it was almost enough. I think 1 more entrée and we would have been stuffed. All of our choices were good, but not great. I couldn't tell you that anything was wrong with anything because nothing was wrong. It just wasn't great. All in all, this place was ok, which is a little disappointing because I've heard good things. Service was ok, food was ok, price was ok. We left and felt ok about the dinner. Just ok."
"A small group of ladies went here for our friend's birthday. When I made the reservations, I left a comment regarding her birthday. They did pay attention to the details and wished her a happy birthday. I have to say when I make reservations for a special occasions, I always leave a note about it but rarely does the restaurant pay attention to that. I very much appreciated their acknowledgment. Overall, the service was amazing. This was all of our first times eating at TWO. I had a friend that went here and his comment was the food is amazing but the portions are small for the price point. So when I made the reservations, we made late dinner reservations because we tend to need a super filling dinner when you eat late. I have to say the portion sizes were similar to The Girl and the Goat if you have ever been there. You will need about 1.5 to 2 dishes per person and that will also help you save room for dessert. For dinner we had roasted cauliflower with white cheddar, bacon jam, duck fat potato croquettes, amish chicken, and duck confit fettuccine. I will start with our least favorite which was the bacon jam. The jam was definitely done well but not for our palate. Our favorite dish was the amish chicken but the duck confit fettuccine was a close second. The chicken was expertly cooked and the sauce it was cooked with is plate licking good. The flavor of the duck was all over the fettuccine which is why I enjoyed it so much.  Personally, I really enjoyed the roasted cauliflower with white cheddar. The roasted flavor with the melted cheddar cheese on top just was so delicious.  For dessert we had the bread pudding and the ricotta cheesecake. Both were so delicious. Overall, we enjoyed our experience. I do agree the price points for the plates is a little high. At those prices, I think about all the other amazing things I have eaten that cost the same or less. For the amount of plates we purchased and the drinks we had, I have spent less at other restaurants. However, I still recommend trying this place at least once!"
"Deeee-licous!This place is a hidden gem we stumbled upon accidentally. A group of 7 of us sat at the bar with Graham as our (awesome) bartender and ordered the chefs tasting menu. Oh my goodness, Chef Kevin provided the perfect selection of shares plates. The mussels and duck fat croquettes were to die for. However, the risotto, cauliflower & brisket plates were so soooo good. It was hard choosing a favorite. Graham personalized each drink for us by creating unique cocktails based on each of our liquor preferences. The entire experience, which was exactly that, AN EXPERIENCE, was well worth the $45 per person for the tasting menu. We will definitely be back!"
"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner today, and had a great experience overall. Had reservations set for 6:45 pm and were running late by about 15 minutes (major traffic), but were still greeted courteously and very warmly. In fact, we were both given handshakes upon entering! Great first impression.Upon getting seated, my white cloth napkin was switched out for a black one (I was wearing a black dress). I've seen other restaurants do this before, but I love attention to detail and appreciate their effort. For two people, we ordered 7 things:- Duck Fat Potato Croquettes: I was surprised at how light and not overly oily these were. Delightfully crispy on the outside, warm and soft on the inside. The chili aioli provided a nice, tangy contrast to the heavier, fried croquettes. This was actually my least favorite dish (although it was still good) - flavors weren't too interesting. - House smoked pork shoulder: Came on a bed of sweet corn, heirloom tomatoes, bacon, and two crispy slices of bread. Delicious! I like how the pork shoulder was pre-shredded to maximize juiciness. Most places I've been to serve it as a chunk of meat, and the inside gets rather dry. However, every bite of the pork was very tender, moist, and flavorful. The corn/tomato/bacon mix was also great, as it soaked up all the extra juices. The bread was the perfect addition as well - a nice textural contrast and really pulled the dish together. - Housemade duck egg pasta: I was afraid this dish would be overhyped... but was not disappointed! I was obsessing over the noodles during the meal - thick, chewy, and delicious. The duck was also very flavorful and there was a nice tender vs. crispy texture balance going on with the duck confit and the cracklins. This dish was a little too oily and salty for my liking (especially near the end), but flavors were delicious and definitely worth getting.- Scallops with parsnip puree, roasted shiitake mushrooms, arugula: I am obsessed with scallops. Pretty much order it at every single restaurant that offers it (I'm the weirdo who gets scallops at a steakhouse), and I'd say these were some of the best I've had. Three giant, juicy scallops with a beautiful sear on the outside. - Beer flight: friend got this (not a fan of beer), so can't comment- Banana bread pudding with caramel and vanilla ice cream: The bread pudding was a bit burnt and dry on the outside, which was disappointing, but it was made up for by the fact that the inside was warm, gooey goodness. - Pumpkin donuts with cinnamon ice cream and caramel: Omg.. not a big fan of sugar donuts, but these were absolutely delightful, especially with the ice cream.Spent $100 (with tax and tip) for 2 people. Portions are a bit on the smaller side for the price, but I'd say flavor makes up for it. I only had two minor issues with my experience:1. Waiter was great when introducing himself, but he pretty much ignored us during the rest of the meal. Never came by to ask how we were doing. We had to flag down a busboy for the dessert menu, who in turn flagged down our waiter, who gave us the menu without a word. I don't like it when waiters are over-attentive, but this was on the other extreme. Fortunately, the other staff were great at clearing plates and refilling water. 2. I made reservations through seat me, and mentioned in the comments section that it was my friend's birthday... Looking through yelp photos, it seems like they do acknowledge birthdays (customized menus, candles in dessert, etc), and we got absolutely nothing. Not asking for anything free, but any sort of acknowledgement would've been nice (at least stick a candle in the dessert I'm going to pay for anyway...)Overall still had a solid experience."
"I came here with my boyfriend for my birthday. Offered to take my jacket at the door. Cute, rustic/modern style. The potato croquettes and scallops were awesome! The pork chops were gone when we tried to ordered them. I ordered hanger steak instead but didn't get to have it. When we were done with scallops we sat a while and the server asked if we wanted dessert. When we reminded her about the steak she went to the kitchen to check. About 20 min later still no steak. I decided to cancel it and when she came back she said the cooks still hadn't started it. It was after 8pmOn a Sunday so they weren't terribly busy. The table I was at I could directly see the kitchen staff standing around the entire time we waited. The server just brushed it off. The server insisted on a dessert even though I didn't want one. Pumpkin bread pudding was tasty though. The food I did have was really great. Unfortunately, food I wanted I never got and that was disregarded."
"Another great ""Medium Size Plate Tapas"" joint.I'd honestly order everything on the menu. The decor is all repurposed materials which is a nice touch and the dinner we shared was up there on the top of my list of places people should get to immediately in the city. We went with the following:Duck fat potato croquettesBBQ Ribs (which was a special)Day boat scallops21 day aged grilled hanger steakBlack truffle risottoGingerbread puddingGet here, I can't wait to come back"
"Listen, if you want good food then go ahead and do it. It is good. But there are nuances that you may want to consider before you take the bait. I can't say I'd return.Food: While I'll admit that the Butternut Squash Risotto was stick-to-your-ribs gooey good, there was not a hint of butternut squash flavor at all. AT ALL. The bacon really took over the flavor of the risotto. That was disappointing because I was expecting the food description to better match what I was served. And the same misnomer issue came up with the scallops. There was a black truffle sauce on it, which is one of the reasons it appealed to me, but we did not taste any truffle in the dish at all. And can I say we paid $20 for 3 scallops? These were not overwhelmingly huge scallops either. Now I just felt disappointed AND ripped off. The price point was high for 'medium plates' when half of the dishes we had would definitely be considered 'small' plates.On the good end: we also had the pan roasted chicken which was amazing. The portion was very generous- the skin was crispy and there was so much yummy jus for us to finish with our spoons. We also loved the lobster ricotta cavatelli- rich and balanced, you can tell the pasta is homemade. The chocolate pave dessert was a nice finish, though nothing special.The other stuff: I feel the entrance was awkward. We pushed our way through the curtains, right into the bar patrons, and we had to look around walk through a first dining area to get to the host station... the host kind of walked up to us and we met half way... was I supposed to have just stood there at the curtains? Was I supposed to walk up all the way to the station? Why are we meeting halfway and talking in this dining and walking area? It felt awkward. And while it was very nice that they took our coats, trying to get our coats back and put them on again made us feel strange. We were standing in the middle of a walking area, having the host put our coats back on us. It's a lovely thought, but awkward as hell. Next. Decor was nice and minimalist. I wouldn't call it romantic though... there were many larger group tables, and perhaps if there weren't just two of us dining, it would have felt more comfortable. But there was no candlelight at the tables, there was no bread or anything set out to set a more intimate mood between two people having dinner. And I'm a newlywed and I'm all about the romance... but I wouldn't feel comfortable if I came here on a first date. 'Comforting and approachable' are not the words I would use to describe what goes on here. It was very odd, there was another couple near us and the girl had gotten a little dressy with a nice blazer, blouse and statement necklace, while her date was in jeans and a college sweatshirt...??? People were definitely on the dressier side but... I found the vibe confusing. I have to say we will drop $100 regularly on a nice dinner, but I really felt this place was ultimately $20-$30 overpriced for what we got. I felt like I was paying for trendy. And I won't be doing it again."
"It was ok.  The online menu doesn't include prices (a pet peeve of mine), but we ordered the charcuterie plate ($20), mussels ($17) and the spare ribs from the specials menu ($26).They're not small plate prices, but they don't have the flavor and texture balance of entrees (no starch and veggie sides).  Without the balance, we had a meat overdose and felt a little sick.  Most dishes are entree-sized, and my husband is a big eater while I'm not, and it was too much food for the two of us.The charcuterie plate was disappointing.  The mussels had a great flavor, but really not $17 worth of flavor.  The short ribs were really dry and I ended with mouthfuls of barely chewable meat and gristle, and the tiny cupfuls of sauce really didn't add much flavor.On the other hand, the service and ambiance are fantastic, but that's just gift wrap."
"Incredible beer menu, perfectly paired to the breadth of tasting dishes. Shared a fantastic meal with coworkers and a great discussion with the bartender and exceedingly hospitable owner. Experiences like these are becoming too rare in NYC, made the trip to Chicago memorable."
"Went for a birthday dinner and the staff was very attentive and they gave us one of the best seats for two, very romantic. Food was superb! I enjoy small plates, but my boyfriend was still hungry when we left. All in all, great experience. Would return for the risotto alone!"
"This place blew me away. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and wanted to go somewhere fantastic. We found a Groupon for Two and it was sounded too good to pass up. Let me break down our experience.The service:  It was incredible from the moment we walked in until we walked out. Everyone was attentive, but gave us space. The courses came out at the perfect pace, and our server was always refilling our wine glasses and water, almost without us noticing!The ambiance: The whole evening felt so cozy. The decor is pretty modern, but with a really nice homey, Midwestern kitchen feel. The music was fun and playing lightly in the background.The food: HOLY COW. The food was intensely delicious. Our first course was the most delicious salad I've ever eaten. It was so simple with simple and fresh ingredients, but it was fantastic. The bacon was crisp and flavorful, the ricotta balls were PHENOMENAL(!!!), and everything aspect was divine.The mussels with the tomato leek sauce came next. I'm not a huge fan of mussels, but the rich and flavorful sauce and the toasted bread made this my second favorite dish of the meal. It was rich, but light and packed with flavor.Our third course was comprised of three pork tenderloin medallions with peppercorn (if it's meant to share, why do three and not two or four?) that were perfectly seared on the outside and so juicy and tender on the inside. I could cut these guys with a fork! The sauce was added a slight spiciness (not necessarily heat, but definitely flavor) and was an incredibly tasty accompaniment to the carrot, potato, and apple hash that was served with it.Our forth course was my absolute favorite dish of the evening. Risotto is so easily messed up, but MANNNNN, I could eat this risotto forever. Like, every single day for the rest of my life. It was so rich and filling and flavorful. I almost ordered another plate just to eat by myself, but I would have hated myself (risotto is filling!). I cannot recommend this dish enough!Finally, our dessert was a sort of deconstructed nutella s'more with homemade graham crackers. The brownie/cake was perfectly rich, but not really sweet, which was great against the nutella ice cream and marshmallow. I was super impressed by the whole idea.The drinks: We received a delicious bottle of wine of Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir 2011 with our meal and it was the perfect wine choice for us. We also ordered two of the seasonal cocktails (Bourbon and seasonal fruit and mint) and it was good, but not my favorite. So yeah....TL;DR: Eat here. Get wine. Enjoy yourself. It's worth it and it's incredible."
"Two was Very good. 4 star. Enjoyed it a lot. Potato croquettes- fantastic adult tAter tots. Artic chAr- great flavorsRisotto- rich and flavorful.  Very goodCavatelli- decent, more boring.  Least favorite. Dessert was amazing- banana bread pudding w homemade whipped cream and ice cream"
"Would have been a higher mark if not for the heavy price tag for the food. Our group of 4 over ordered 15 out of the 21 items in the menu and all four deserts. Food was very good -- Amish chicken, Wagyu beef, duck risotto, duck fat potato croquettes among my favorite. Deserts were good, but the poorly named Puppy Chow isn't deserving of the menu. Drinks were expertly prepared -- highly recommend the Aviation. Outstanding!"
"5 star experience! Food melts in your mouth and service made you feel like you were in an episode of cheers. Even the concept was awesome. The name is Two...two partners own the restaurant and everything in the restaurant was given a second chance. Chairs from a library, table tops are repurposed science tables! I will be back!"
"Service was excellent and owner was super nice but I'm not a big fan of small plates for high prices especially if the three bites I'm taking is not the best thing I've tasted. Went here with the bf for our anniversary and was very excited.  To his surprise, they pulled out his chair and was removing his jacket for him and he was very impressed.  They recommended that we order about 4 dishes for the two of us.  The fritters we ordered was delicious but the special tomato pasta and our pork belly was just average.  Great ambience, excellent service,  average food."
"A group of friend and I took a weekend trip to Chicago and had dinner at Two one evening. We made reservations about 1 month earlier because it was the same weekend as the Chicago marathon. There were 7 of us and we decided to leave it up to the chef to choose our food. For $50 each we ordered the 'chef's tasting menu."" We tried so many dishes and they were all so good. My favorites were the sea scallops and the risotto. They brought us so many dishes it's hard to remember it all. We had a vegetarian with us and they catered very well to her needs as well.The experience and food was well worth the $50!"
Amazing service and amazing food. Had a such a great experience and definitely am going to go back sometime soon! Beautifully done
"Went in last night for restaurant week. Food was amazing (we did the set menu). Scallops and the dark chocolate brownie were the highlight. Bonus polenta cake was also fab. We got the Pinot that was on special with the fixed menu- great deal. I can't wait to come back for the regular menu.Service is so friendly. One of the owners came and sat with us a few times, chatted it up. Free moscato from the bar to end the night. This is an unpretentious, warm, casual, delicious place. Go!!"
"Started with a short wait at the bar.  Bartender was very helpful explaining the menu and providing helpful suggestions - e.g. ordering 2 plates per person and all at once.  She transitioned to our table before leaving us in good hands with the wait staff in the dining room.  BTW - cool decor throughout the place.  Waitstaff/service was team effort and perfect! Just the right amount of attention.  Beer selections were interesting.  Really liked the Bockness Monster and have always been a fan of Moody Tongue.  Food was excellent! Loved the foie gras (with delicious toast points), green beans (nicely spiced tomato-based sauce!), mussels (excellent broth!), baby back ribs (falling off the bone, NC mustard style sauce), shishito peppers (nicely spicy with chopped peanuts)  and liked the salad, squash blossoms and cavatelli.  Everything was very good, it was all about degrees of how good! We left the sequence of dishes to the staff and it was perfect.  Absolutely will be back!  Can't wait to go back! This is one of the best in Chicago.  Only problem is I can't order everything on the menu at one meal!"
"TWO is one of my favorite restaurants! The staff there is friendly and knowledgable, and the food there is really good. They serve their food in small plates, perfect place to go on a date or with a friend - probably not the best place for big groups unless you're not planning on sharing."
"I took my foodie boyfriend here as a surprise, and let me tell you, you won over his heart and stomach!  The wait staff is amazing, and we were early for our reservation and fully prepared to have a drink in the bar.  Without question, the GM was able to seat us right away.  The decor is far from pretentious--yet as far from ""family restaurant"" as you can get.  Loved everything except for the one stall bathrooms...that is a challenge for sure, especially for the ladies. The food was wonderful...we had the pork belly to start which was among the top incarnations of this dish that we have had.  Crispy and smooth in all the right places.  We noshed on the Butternut Squash Risotto even though I am not a big fan of rice dishes.  It was so perfectly cooked that I could swear I was eating a pasta.  We finished with the chicken breast over polenta cake, and I basically died and went to heaven. The mushroomy-peppery gravy was just the right ending to this meal.  For dessert, we had the Nutella Ice Cream Pave with Marshmallow and Toffee Graham Crackers.  Sweet and served promptly and freshly!The best part about this place is that every employee seemed to be enjoying their day...not a scowl or bad attitude in the place at 7pm on a Saturday night.  My boyfriend's parting words that evening, ""You've gotta stop raising the bar like this.""  Thanks Two for making me look good. ; )"
"The owner will be waiting by the door to shake your hands, which immediately makes look like a VIP. The place has a hipster-ish vibe and food there is mostly comforting food which could be excellent for late night craves or night club hungers. I would say it could also be a good choice for your first or second date. If your date annoys you, at least the food there is comforting. We had this couple sitting next to us. Judging from how uncomfortable the girl was in her dress and the length of the awkward silence during their conversation, they were having the first date. I could see that the guy had lost his interests in the conversation but after a few bites of the Berkshire pork belly, all of sudden, he looked like a fully charged Energizer Bunny, he just kept going. So we ordered the pork belly, too. The tenderness and the great balance between the fat and the crispy skin did help you to bring a new topic to the table. Because the girl sitting next to us then was like ""Mmmmm, it tastes great, but I am not supposed to eat fat, do you think I look fat?"" and it just went on and on and on....But seriously, the pork belly is good. Order the pork belly, you will need it at some point."
"Looking back at our best dozen meals in Chicago the past couple years, the best two were at TWO: One in March that I already reviewed, and again tonight. They do such a good job - Order the Chef's tasting and let the staff at TWO take great care of you! Nice people, excellent staff, and great food. Tonight we had a salad with heirloom tomatoes and ricotta fritters, followed by a beef course with celery root, halibut with mushrooms and a pea pesto, risotto with bacon, mushrooms and peas, and a ricotta cheesecake with honey and macerated strawberries - All pretty much to die for. If two reviews in four months is too much, my apologies... But what a great meal. We go out to eat a lot, probably too much, and TWO is as good as it gets for me in Chicago."
"A must try restaurant, with the warmest service and absolutely delicious food!!!It has been a while since I was here so I can not give food choices because I do not remember what everything was called, but everything was soooo tasty. mmmmI will be coming back for sure!"
"We stopped by tonight after purchasing the groupon. Really glad we did, it's a great spot. Very cool decor inside. We started off with the salad which was very fresh. The salmon was brought out next and was cooked perfectly! Whatever the green sauce that was on the plate was delicious too. Then we got some pulled pork/pork belly which was so tender and juicy. Finished it off with the risotto. It was good but probably would have tried something else if I came back. We got a bottle of wine which was very good as well. Worth the groupon for a great meal!!"
"If you are looking for a nice place where you can share small plates, this is the place to go! Perfect place for couples! I was taken here on a first date, and it couldn't have been a more perfect place. We had the mixed greens market salad, duck fat potato croquettes, and the homemade duck egg fettuccine. All of the dishes were amazing. For dessert we had the banana bread pudding (I have a slight obsession). It was amazing but if you like banana bread as much as I do you might as well buy a whole one for yourself . Amazing service, they don't rush your dining experience, and they don't bring all your food out at once. Overall it is an excellent restaurant and I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
"I'd never heard of this place, so went along with a friend who just adores it.  I foundt it charming and a great space.  Really though, who dosen't love a restaurant that serves puppy chow for dessert.  Apparently, I'm the only person in the midwest whose mother did not serve me this odd, sugarie dish of deliciousness.  The bar area is cute and has some great craft beer selections while you wait and you can bring your own wine, even though they have a list and pretty good selection there.  I may not plan a trip here on my own, but I'd certainly be excited to go again if invited."
"Had a wonderful experience with exceptional appetizers (porchetta di testa and Slagel Farms suckling pig), main course (duck egg pasta), and dessert (banana bread pudding)."
Great date night spot! Really enjoyed the dinner except the bread that came with our bacon jam was burnt. I recommend the homemade duck egg fettuccine and the ricotta cheesecake!
"Oh my mouth is watering. TWO has terrific staff, on top of unbelievable food. We got the pork belly, Brussels, fettuccine with duck egg, house salad, duck croquettes, duck risotto, 60 day dry rubbed meat. And all of the dishes were delicious! I felt like everything was reasonably priced. There were 4 of us and it was about $60/person with wine & cocktails."
"TWO is so good! I have been a few times and it never disappoints. Each part of the experience is pleasant from the welcoming and friendly staff to the decor, drinks and food.Every item of the menu looked delicious and we decided  to go with the heirloom tomato and watermelon salad, pork bell and duck pasta. Every bite was so tasty. The pork belly may be the best thing I've had. The chocolate pave dessert was the perfect end to the meal.I can't wait to go back to try all the new fall items. If you haven't been yet you are truly missing out."
"It was a great restaurant, super friendly staff. A very nice wine selection, they helped us pick a nice wine. Their tapas are a really good size which is nice. For to people you will be fine ordering 4. We had the duck fettuccini and it was amazing, the bacon jelly is also superb. If back in Chicago I will definitely go again."
"I was deeply enthralled in conversation during my entire meal at Two so the food played second fiddle to great company, but the food was a very close second. ;)My dining companion and I shared a few plates and I left completely satisfied in my belly. Their dishes are constantly changing to stay fresh with the farm to table theme and on the night we went asparagus was on the menu. It was done well and I enjoyed it. The hanger steak was surprisingly a big plate and really tasty. We had to get the duck egg pasta that everyone raves about. Yep, it's everything everyone says. Our dessert was a trio of sorbets and on the night we went the flavors of the night were intense! Intense in the best way possible, really strong flavors.My favorite dish of the night was the ramp risotto. We learned what ramps were and when in risotto filled with bacon, cheese and topped with a duck egg, ramps are fabulous!Our server was fantastic the whole meal through, explaining each dish, giving recommendations and I think the manager brought out our dessert which was a nice touch. Loved the ambiance, food, service and company so had a great night at Two!"
"Awesome Experience!I'm a sucker for traditional American dishes reimagined and they've accomplished this at Two!  The food was amazing even though I feel portions could be larger.  The waitstaff was courteous, attentive and very knowledgable.  I would def recommend Two to anyone looking for another Chicago hidden gem!!"
"EVERYTHING here is delicious. If the fried chicken and cornbread is available, get it, if nothing else because it will be the best cornbread you've ever had. This is my boyfriend and I's favorite date spot. The service and food are great, no ""fancy place"" attitude and no crazy waiting for tables or reservations (also close to my house). I really appreciate that Two is all quality and no hype unlike many other places in Chicago."
"To begin with, the restaurants decor was quaint and inviting. We were sat down immediately and the server was great. I had really high hopes for this restaurant as the reviews were so great. However, I am sad to say that food was subpar. We began the meal with the croquettes and they lacked flavor and texture. Then we went on to the duck fettuccine and I was again let down. It lacked flavor and the duck resembled leftover Chinese food. On a high note, the best thing I ate was the cavaletti. It was very fresh and flavorful. The drinks were also very good(old fashion and new hound.) It was a shame the rest of the meal couldn't have been this way.The night once again ended on a poor note because the porterhouse was almost inedible. The porterhouse was drenched in salt and over cooked. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant and I would not come back. The food was over priced for such a lackluster experience."
"We got the chef's tasting and sat at the bar.  Win and win.Duck fat croquettes - fried mashed potato ball goodness with a hint of duck fat flavor.Mussels - a really nice change from the white wine sauce.  These were in a hearty, flavorful tomato sauce with amazing grilled bread from Damato's bakery down the street.Duck egg with shitake shrooms and risoto.  By far the most interesting dish and tastefully rich.Bacon sausage - I was not looking forward to this but OMG.  Served with a mashed potato and chive creme fraiche (sp) - My most favorite ""savory"" dish of the eve.Bread pudding by far the best dessert I've had in a really long time.Good wine, great beer list, good cocktails, and nice atmosphere.  Our bartender, Graham, was super nice and made our dinner even more enjoyable. We'll definitely be back..."
"Let's play two!So I chose Two as a restaurant yesterday,for another couple my fiancée and me, based upon the consistently excellent Yelp reviews.  The recommendation was superb!The food was a combination of eclectic contemporary American small plates.  It included appetizers, salads, entrees and desserts.  Everything we ordered was terrific.  We shared a standard salad, a beet salad, the duck- fat croquettes app (think tater tots-but better), a sausage entree and a sausage entree.  All were flavorful and has a unique taste.We had two (no pun intended) desserts.  One was called ""Puppy Chow,"" and included check mix, powdered sugar chocolate and peanut butter.  I don't like peanut butter in sweets; but I liked this!  We also got a bread pudding with whipped cream and cinnamon ice cream.  I like good bread pudding, which this was.  What made it a special treat was the ice cream.Everything in the menu is accessible and appealing.  We only were able to sample about a third of it.  We want to go back, not even to have everything again but to try everything else!"
"I can't believe this place has been open for over 2yrs and I'm just now finding out about it.  I've been eating as sustainable as possible (no factory farming meats for me) - so when I stumbled upon TWO's farm to table inspired menu I was delighted.  The meal was stellar.My husband and I had:duck fat croquettes - 4/5Broccoli & cauliflower - 5/5Cavatelli w mushroom & bacon - 5/5Sweet corn risotto & beef cheek - 5/5Peach bread pudding - 3/5I love roasted veggies in general, but the broccoli and cauliflower was amazing.The fresh pasta was some of the best I've ever had.  The risotto was great, the combination of sweetness from the corn with the saltiness of the beef cheek -- YUM.  Quality of product really does make a difference in taste and the staff at Two honored their ingredients by serving thoughtfully crafted cuisine."
Went for restaurant week & ordered from the menu.  It looked quite nice for our taste.  Beet salad - delish 5/5Char - too salty 3/5Mushroom polenta - hearty and amazingRisotto- filling.  Good portion.  Tasty.  5/5Duck fettuccine - 5/5.  Hearty & memorable.  Get a fried egg on it.  Both desserts.  Loved them both.  5/5 Would give them 4.5 if I could.  We will be back for the real menu.  Great deal & RW week menu.  4 full courses for $33!Great service.  Highly recommend.  Everyone loved it!
"This was a little out of the way. Still, amazing! I will Food 4.5 stars.Service 4 stars.So they source for natural ingredients from Chicago, and it really shows. Their restaurant week dinner menu is a steal, you get practically four courses.Both the partner and I got the smoked char starter, amazingly smoked and WOW. Perfect balance. It's supposed to be salty, if that isn't your thing you can swing the other way.The polenta mushroom second course was great too.Third were the mains, duck fettucine and braised pork shoulder? MMM. Both winners IMO.Fourth were beignets (nothing that outstanding, tiny) but partner loved them and olive chocolate cake. Go with the latter.We'll be back in a heartbeat, just the Two of us."
"Great food, atmosphere and staff!!It was my b'day. The first one after I had my daughter. I have an awesome husband. As a fellow-foodie, he understands my love for good food. He surprised me by taking me here and had called them to tell them that we'd be bringing a one year old. As you can imagine, a one year old at a fine-dining place screams trouble. But I guess, my stars aligned perfectly.. my daughter was in a good mood and the staff was super accommodating.  Our waiter Brian, was extremely hospitable, made us aware of all the different options that can be customized to be made vegetarian and took pictures for us too. Now, on to the most important part, the food. The menu changes seasonally, which is the way it should. We tasted 4 of their cocktails and very impressed with the variety. The salad was refreshing with delicious ricotta fritters, the cavatelle with mushrooms and truffle oil was heavenly, the roasted cauliflower n broccoli was scrumptious and the risotto was the best I have ever tasted. For dessert we got the cheesecake and banana bread pudding. Needless to say, we were in a blissful state of food coma!!"
"Banger Island Mussels- I'm usually not a fan of mussels but these were awesome... The sauce was so addicting. Homemade pork & green garlic sausage- Very tasty plate Ramp risotto- not my favorite dish.. It may have been better if we added the egg but it was too salty for my taste I love the concept of this restaurant.. Everything is seasonal, fresh and local!"
"DELICIOUS. DELICIOUSDecided on a whim to try Sunday night for restaurant week. What a great decision to get out and trek through the cold and snow. We lucked out with reservations as it seems the restaurant fills up fast. I ordered the beet salad, pork shoulder and chocolate cake. We even got a ""bonus"" dish of polenta and mushrooms which melted in my mouth. I love how the ingredients are sourced locally with great flavor. Additionally, all the wait staff from the server to host were very attentive. The host even grabbed us extra plates asking us if we needed anything instead of saying ""let me get your server."" It definitely seemed like a ""family"" and team effort to make sure everyone was having a great time.Recommendation: Call ahead and make reservations!"
"I made reservations here for a group of 4, all our first times ever eating at Two, for their restaurant week menu. I must say we were all very impressed with the food. Everything was perfectly cooked and the flavor combinations were always unique and amazing. The only downside, and why I do not give Two five stars, is that is took a very, VERY, long time for us to get each of our courses which were also a bit on the smaller side in general but that's what I expected anyway on a $33 per person fixed menu. We arrived at 6pm and didn't leave until after 9pm and not for lack of trying. The restaurant made up for the slow service by apologizing as well as buying one of our bottles of wine we ordered, bringing an extra dessert, and 4 glasses of sparkling red wine was also brought over to us as well. This definitely made up for the slow service but after speaking with friends who have also visited here, and reading through some of the yelp reviews, I can see slow/delayed service or forgetting to bring courses seems to be a regular problem here and, with that in mind, I will hold on a possible 5 star review until my revisit experience and see if that improves.What we ordered:Apps:Beet SaladSmoked CharPolenta Mushroom 'bonus' dishEntrees:Smoked Pork Belly with sweet potato pureeDuck Egg FettuccineDesserts:Chocolate olive oil cakeDonuts with drinking chocolateBanana bread puddingThe only thing of all this I might not ever order again is the beet salad appetizer and only because I'm not the hugest fan of beets and it was a fairly simplistic dish. I'm serious when I say I loved everything else and would highly recommend trying each of these dishes! I was most surprised, I think, by the smoked char dish. It's a great non-overpowering, light, fish dish that reminds you of summer BBQ's with friends with that yummy smoked hickory flavor! The pork belly was melt in your mouth tender and puree delicious. The fettuccine was by far my fav dish it's just sooo good! I was also surprised by the banana bread pudding - I'm usually not a fan of bread puddings in general but this was just SO AWESOME!Final Verdict:Oh yes. I will be back my friends. Must. Have. Duck Egg. Fettuccine."
"Our server brought us out a complimentary champagne glass of rose and told us to warm up before we left...and every single person working said goodbye and thanks as we left. AWESOME service! We began the meal looking for a reasonable bottle of wine to share...but there wasn't one. Our server suggested we get a bottle that was on special, $65 instead of $85 and we almost giggled. This wasn't a romantic meal, and we just wished there was something more affordable on their extensive list, so we opted for beers instead. Our meal was incredible, and we were feeling full after sharing 4 plates-charcuterie, cauliflower with cheese fondue (YUM!), apple risotto and the duck egg fettuccine, but decided we couldn't pass up the banana bread pudding. I personally like my bread pudding to be gooey, and this was more like a banana muffin, but it still hit the spot. Bravo, TWO!"
"This place is a gem of Chicago's Near West Side. The flavors and dishes are fresh and superb. Most of the menu rotates on a regular basis, but the duck egg fettuccine is a signature dish and should be on your list. The service is excellent and responsive to pretty much anything you need. So the next time you're looking for locally-source cuisine, skip River North and head to Grand and May Street for the quiet elegance of Two."
"We came here for my sister's birthday dinner. Finding street parking wasn't too hard on a Saturday night. The bus boys were very good about removing plates that were finished and refilling drinks. Our waiter was average.We had a party of 8 and ordered about 18 dishes. Everything is meant to be shared. 18 plates was a little more than we needed. We started off with the mixed green market salad and the beet salad. I loved the mixed green salad. The beet salad was good too...especially the fried little balls of sartori cheese. Other food we ordered: sea scallops, pork belly, hampshire pork shank, roasted chicken, hangar steak, duck egg pasta, risotto, mussels and brussel sprouts. Pretty much all the dishes were great. My favorite dish was the pork belly. I love fatty meats. The creamy polenta it sat upon paired perfectly with it.  I loved this dish so much I ordered a second plate of it halfway through the meal :)  The brussel sprouts were delish. My siblings loved the mussels bc of the white wine reduction. The sea scallops and chicken were nothing spectacular. I could do without those next time.Once the dessert with a candle was place in front of my sister, a bus boy dimmed the lights in our half of the dining area so we could sing happy birthday to her. How cute!"
"We randomly grabbed a groupon for this place and booked a reservation for just a couple of hours later. It's a very casual environment, I even called ahead to ask if there was a dress code (there isn't) so the environment surprised me a bit. That being said, I thought the food was phenomenal. It's literally the best bacon I've ever had in my life, and I devoured the salmon despite the fact that I am not a fish eater and find salmon to be one of the more offensive types of fish. The groupon experience is interesting. You book your reservation through groupon so they know when you walk in. Our server asked about dietary restrictions and when we said we had none, just kept bringing out food. We never even saw a menu (though we were offered one if we wanted anything additional) I find this to be a fantastic way to dine. I highly recommend Two."
"In town for the Eye Convention and made last minute reservations at Two. Skeptical when people said ""you're going where?"" Shipping late so restaurant graciously changed our reservation that afternoon. Experience was so much more than we expected. The staff including one of the owners was outstanding. Attentive, caring but unobtrusive service. The food was so good. Among my wife, daughter and me we had just about everything in the menu and each dish was better than the last! Some how we managed to find room for dessert. WOW were we glad! The cheesecake, bread pudding and doggy chow were exceptional accompanied by incredible cappuccinos. We will be back!"
"Discussing restaurant week plans:Me: I'm going to TWO on WednesdayFriend: Oh, wow what are they?Me: just going to TWOFriend:...Me: The place is called ""TWO""Friend: Oh.Aside from the Abbott-Costello routine, I thoroughly enjoyed the four-course dinner extravaganza at TWO. Great refined-rustic cuisine with a wonderfully warm ambiance to match. Despite it getting progressively loud, we were still able to catch up in our corner window seat. We ended up sharing everything off their prix fixe menu. Oh-so-scrumptious eats: hearty onion soup w/ tender short rib, crispy duck fat croquettes, rich risotto w/ egg, arctic char, wild boar sausage with a sauce I could bathe in, plus like James Z-- the banana bread pudding was a great way to end the meal. I was having trouble sharing the scoop of banana ice cream with my friend. The pretzel doughnuts were also equally delicious: sweet, warm and airy. On the flip side, the duck pasta was a little dry and the ""grilled"" bread was overly charred. Too burnt-tasting for my liking. We had a great dinner experience with friendly, appreciative staff. Definitely a place warranting a repeat."
"Brought my sister here for her 32nd birthday - what a truly delicious and special night.  The waitstaff advised us that these were medium sized plates for sharing, so we decided to go with four savory dishes and one dessert to round off the meal.  Had the octopus with crispy potatoes, the duck egg pasta with duck confit and crispy duck cracklings, the creamy polenta with chanterelles and a fried duck egg, the seared scallops with shitakes, and dessert was a slice of chocolate angel food cake with an espresso saybayon.  So. Damn. Good. The only low point of the meal was that the octopus was a little overcooked, however my sister said that the potatoes that came with it were the best potatoes she had ever had. EVER.  My favorite dish by far was the creamy polenta with chanterelles and duck egg. After my first bite I looked at my sister and exclaimed ""I feel like I just got hugged by this dish."" So warm. So comforting. So incredibly delicious.  Another highlight was that the staff was incredibly friendly and attentive while still giving us our space to enjoy the food and each other's company.  From the moment we walked in, the front of the house manager was charming and helpful (and if I may, quite handsome).  The team serving our table worked flawlessly together to bring an incredibly well executed dish to a truly fantastic dining experience."
"Yum.My husband and I were looking for a place to celebrate our anniversary and I stumbled upon Two in my Yelp review search.  All we were looking for was good food.  No need for the fancy schmancy.  Just good food.  We got to the restaurant and realized that Two replaced May Street Market, which was the restaurant that introduced us to good food (prior to that our idea of good food was cheesecake factory-yes we are now food snobs).Loved the decor and the ambience.  The menu changes often and has enough choices but the list isn't exhausive, which is nice on both accounts.  It's small plate style.  We tried the following:Potato Croquettes- very light and delicate in flavor.  Wish there was more of the sauce.  We tried to flag our waiter down to get more but gave up after awhileOctopus- was ok, probably wouldn't get it again.  It's one of thpse dishes that needs to be cooked perfectly and it wasn'tPork Belly- my husband loved it, i thought it was a bit salty and overcooked.  Duck Fetticuine- so good.  A tad on the salty side.  the pasta texture was perfect.Bread Pudding- good.Overall, I don't think anything on the menu was super creative, but nevertheless, still good.I would definitely come back, especially given that the menu changes frequently."
"We recently purchased a groupon for the Chef's Tasting Menu for 2. Unfortunately, with groupons, and other discounted sites, I've grown accustomed to expecting mediocracy.  We were pleasantly surprised by Two.  Service is always something I take note of, as I've spent so many years as a waitress, Two was on point. From our hosts and attentive server, to all of the prompt and friendly waitstaff who helped present each of our delicious courses.  The wine that came with our meal was nice also.  Got the impression that they only schedule the groupon crowd earlier in the evening, reserving prime time dinner  accommodations for those who are paying full price.  I could be wrong, however I noticed that 6-6:30 were the only available times when I tried to book on three separate occasions through groupon. Other than that, food was fresh, pasta homemade (or tasted very much so), all surprising and well above average. With so many options in the city, we don't have too many restaurants we like enough to make repeat visits to. We will surely return to Two again!"
"Four of us dined at Two at seven. Confusing, right? Imagine the call when they confirmed the reservation. It's yet another small-plates concept. I no longer openly chafe (at least not in front of people) at this never-going-to-die trend in dining. I can bitch all I want, but since it doesn't show any signs of letting up, I better get used to it or be relegated to eating only at steakhouses (on second thought...).How is this one different? It's tapas-sized portions but with entrée-sized prices.In all fairness to Two, I did like the food. I just thought everything was overpriced across the board by a couple of dollars.We were ""encouraged"" to order 8-10 items on the menu for our group of four. In the end, I think that was a perfect amount of food; none of was stuffed by any means, but we were all satisfied with the amount of food. The disappointment comes with the fact that if I enjoyed something, I was only getting one small bite so there would be enough for the others. Oh how I wish this trend would die a slow death. It's really hard to share small portions amongst four people. Yay, I got a third of a scallop!So I'm exaggerating a bit. I actually got one whole scallop (and only because the waiter was proactive and added a fourth scallop to the order). And it was delicious. It had some shitaake mushrooms and a light sauce.We also ordered a charcuterie plate that had a small hunk of parmesan (that we were all fighting over), several cured meats and jerky, duck rillettes, homemade pickles, stone-ground mustard (I LOVE stone-ground mustard!) and slices of baguette.The mixed greens salad stole my heart. It had lovely greens, soft herbs, smoky bacon, and little ricotta fritters that melted in your mouth.We also loved the pasta special of the night, a ricotta cavatelli with roasted butternut squash and sage brown butter. The pasta was nice and toothsome and the flavors all reminded me of autumn.Other standouts were the sirloin, roasted chicken, Berkshire ribs and charred broccoli. The broccoli was exceptional. It had a great texture and subtle lemon flavor, and was tossed with some toasted pignoli. I could have eaten all of this myself. Like I said, we all enjoyed all of the food, but therein lies the rub with small plates: you never get more than a bite of any one thing, so I didn't want to get too ""attached"" to anything I was enjoying, because we'd just have to order a second plate of everything!Desserts were off the grid and well-executed: Templeton rye cheesecake and pumpkin donuts with cinnamon ice cream with salted caramel sauce. Other offerings were a sorbet trio (if you relish something lighter) and banana bread pudding.The food, excellent. The drinks, tasty (try the Wet Hound!). The service, gracious.It's a fine spot; well worth visiting. I'm just not the biggest fan of tapas-style dining. If you are, then you definitely need to give Two a try."
"Excellent food, good drink selection, and really quite a good value.I won't comment on specific menu items, because the menu changes regularly.Valet, metered parking on Grand, and free parking only a block away."
"Two is the new kid in town, and it definitely has it goin' on! I keep hearing that the whole ""farm to table"" concept is becoming overplayed. Perhaps there's some truth in that statement, but either way, Two executes on the concept beautifully and deliciously. Our table of 4 ordered a quite a few dishes and left very satiated. For ""small"" plates, the portions were generous and matched the prices charged. The favorites were the duck egg pasta, banana bread pudding, and the homemade jerky on the charcuterie plate. As for the beverages - super delicious, super unique, and there was definitely no skimping on the booze.Dishes for Four....// Duck Fat Potato Croquettes// Charcuterie Plate// Roasted Beet Salad// Berkshire Pork Belly// Sea Scallops// Ricotta Cavatelli// Duck Egg Pasta // Banana Bread Pudding// Homemade Pretzel DonutsThe decor was simple - industrial fans served as light fixtures, there was a mixture of woods, and simple - yet beautiful art hung on the walls. The restaurant is fairly small and they definitely pack in the tables, so if you're looking for a quiet, intimate gathering this might not be the place. Expect laughter and loud conversations, even some 'oohing' and 'ahhing' over the food.Service was good. However, my one complaint was the speed that the dishes were brought out. Within 5 minutes of ordering, our dishes started being brought out. After a whopping 40 minutes, 10 dishes were devoured by 4 people. It somewhat put a damper on the dining experience when the dishes are rushed out - and not always piping hot. Aside from that, the server was knowledgeable and friendly. Final thought: Two is definitely a must. And make sure you get an order of duck egg pasta...or maybe even two."
My favorite restaurant in Chicago! Amazing food and great service. My husband and I had the greatest experience.I wrote about our experience and what I'd recommend to order in my blog: fromchicagowithlove.weeb…
"Loved this restaurant! Went here a few months ago (delayed review!) and really need to get back. Because the menu is seasonal, what we had isn't on there anymore except the duck egg pasta which is unbelievable. I know my friend also had something with pork that was great - but alas not on their current menu. Our service was perfect. From the moment you walk in the door you feel like you are part of their family. We got beer recommendations to go along with our food and the recommendations were spot on - perfect compliments to the food. For desert we had the homemade donuts - they were incredible! I recommend this restaurant to so many people as one of those hidden gems that you don't hear enough about. Love the concept, love the food, love the service."
"Amazing drinks, food and service! This is yet another small plates restaurant, but the portions are a good size. Dishes are perfectly timed, so you never feel rushed to finish something because another dish just came out.We had:Charcuterie plate: I loved the home made jerky! This was a nice start to the meal, although it could have used a little more bread.Potato croquettes: I expected maybe four croquettes, but there were quite a few in this bowl! These were tasty, especially with the chipotle aioli sauce.Octopus: Perfectly cooked with a nice char flavor.Duck egg pasta: AMAZING! That's all I have to say. The crispy duck skin was a great touch and added a nice crunch and flavor to this dish. Fig ice cream: This tasted like I was eating real figs, but there was also a weird freezer-burn after taste. This was more than enough for two people and we were stuffed! As for drinks, I had a fruity martini that was good, but the pumpkin whisky drink was my favorite!"
This place is amazing. The staff is so nice. It was our first time in Chicago and our waiter even helped us pick a bar to go to after. The food is amazing you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. I'm a vegetarian and they can make almost every plate vegetarian if you ask. The food comes out in family style and we had four dishes for 2 people and it was the perfect amount. The prices are very reasonable. The neighborhood is a cool Italian area. I recommended this place to everyone!!
"Service was impeccable. 3 of us came here for a friend's birthday.  I called ahead to ask if they could light some candles if we brought in a cake. When we walked, the host remembered me from the phone call and asked for the cake immediatly to save in the back so they can bring it out. we had:bone marrow - very nice, the bacon jam was greatscallops - 3 sea scallops cooked perfectlymussels - I am not a fan of mussels but it was actually very good. the order came with a few pieces of toasted bread. I really wished they brought more bread because the there was still so much yummy broth left.duck pasta - was tasty but not sure if i'll get againpork chop - very meaty and tasty as well. not too salty. We ordered 2 cocktails as well with the right amount of spirits.I liked how they brought out each dish one at a time. they even cleared our plates and gave us clean plates in the middle of the courses. They did bring out the cake after our meals were over. No..we didnt sing...it's not that kind of place. This is place is a must try."
"OK, I had the most INTENSE meal I've ever had at Two.  Even the salad was intense ... and I hardly get excited about salad.  It was dotted with four little homemade marble-sized fried balls of homemade ricotta that gently oozed out when you bit into them.  Not too hot, not too cold.  And the ricotta flavor ... well, if you're like me, you've never had ricotta with flavor.  So it was pretty eye-opening.If I focus on every ingredient, this review will be 500 pages a long, but clearly there's a lot of attention to detail here. I had broccoli and cauliflower, which I can still taste in my brain hours later.  The overlapping fondue cheese sauce had a bite which brought out the personality of the vegetables.  (Vegetables have personality?  Who knew?)  And the ramp risotto ... ah!  I shoved my face in the steam and just sat there for a minute.  Rapturous!  The servers were fantastic and attentive, and they really, really like food.   They share their opinions about what they like in certain dishes, and explain the ingredients and cooking process well.   I find the whole farm-to-fork trend fascinating, and Two is a restaurant that really does it right.  They make you re-think food. And they leave you with a warm, gentle glow afterwards.  If you're jaded about restaurants, I'd give them a try!"
"I am here once a week, literally.It's just too good. Their drinks, salads, risotto and pastas. Everything here is excellent, especially the service. The waitstaff is so in sync everything feels so natural. I must add, their desserts are amazing. Specifically the butterscotch bread pudding. It hasn't been around long and it's such an impressive spot. I can't say enough great things about it. I have referred so many people here and every single time I get a wow response.Keep up the great work. What an awesome restaurant."
"Wonderful servers.   Friendly knowledgeable and not obstrusive.  Food is good.  Living in Seattle, I think the farm-to-table idea is better executed out west, but Two does a good job.   We had the salad with ricotta fritters (could have had a few more fritters than the three on our plate), the duck pasta (well cooked pasta, flavourful) and the halibut (an excellent piece of fish).   Donut was delicious.  Overall we were really pleased with our meal.   Not blown away, but very pleased, particularly at the pricepoint."
"Average food.  SLOW SLOW SLOW delivery of dishes. Terribly loud. Unpolished in most facets.I was in a group of six and we ordered two plates each thinking that we would all get our appetizer and then all get our main. We got ONE plate at a time for SIX people roughly every ten minutes. One small beet salad ... Ten minutes later ... A small cauliflower dish ... Ten minutes later ... Another beet salad. At least mix it up?!?Way WAY too much waiting around for food. We asked three separate times for them to bring out our plates faster, which only marginally made a difference. Still, it was slow and the food was so average to the point that I won't return or recommend it. The food is just not that high quality/gourmet enough to require so much time. It simply isn't. Speed it up. Three hour dinner for two courses each. Unacceptable. I also had two old-fashioneds. They use a single two-inch diameter spherical ice cube, which is trendy these days. But they also use tap water, rather than filtered water, which creates cloudy ice. It's very unsightly for a craft cocktail and feels very amateurish. It just felt like it was someone's first attempt at a restaurant.Meh. Skip this place."
Everything we had was delicious. Seriously. Go now.
"So happy I found Two! We came in for dinner on a Thursday evening and as soon as we arrived we were warmly welcomed and seated by Yamandu, the owner. Immediately we noticed all the character packed into this small space. The meat cleavers hung behind the bar and the reclaimed wood throughout give you a glimpse of what they're all about-in a nutshell, quality ingredients sourced from small Midwestern farms used create a seasonal menu of delicious dishes. Throw in fantastic service and some strong, tasty cocktails and this, my friends, is the place to be!First things first we started with cocktails. I opted for the Blood Orange Marg-a tasty twist on the standard margarita. I could drink a lot of these (although I might regret it the next day).  My fiancé went for Brasky's Revenge-a Templeton Rye cocktail poured over a coffee ice cube. As the ice cube melts the flavor profile of the drink changes. The boys also sampled a few microbrews while the ladies opted for a second round of cocktails with the Wet Hound. A combination of a Greyhound and a Mojito, this was by far my favorite drink of the night. Grapefruit and mint is definitely a winning combo!As soon as our drink orders were place we dove into the dinner menu. I think the ideal group size for Two is 4 people. The plates are smaller and meant to be shared-we found they were the perfect portion for a group of 4 to split and each get a taste while maximizing the number of different dishes you can try. Whatever your group size, the staff at Two will go above and beyond to accommodate you. One of the desserts we ordered only came with 3 pieces and they suggested adding an additional piece so everyone got their own. Outstanding service was definitely a theme of the night-Yamandu even took me out back to see their smoker after I asked if they smoked their own meats!We ordered 7 dishes and 2 desserts for our group of 4. First up were the Duck Fat Potato Croquettes served with a chili aioli and topped with parmesan cheese. Yes, these were as good as they sound. Crunchy, fried goodness on the outside and smooth, creamy potatoes on the inside...get. in. my. belly. (They did, and they were awesome.)Next up we had the Red Wine Braised Beef Cheek and the P.E.I Mussels. The beef cheek was topped with homemade ricotta cheese, apple, and chives and served with crostini. The crostini was a bit over-grilled but top it with the tender, flavorful beef cheek and all is right in the world. The mussels were swimming in a lovely white wine sauce that we happily sopped up with more slices of grilled baguette until the bowl was dry.Next were the Sea Scallops and Roasted Bone Marrow. The scallops were perfectly cooked, served on roasted parsnips and sweet potatoes and topped with crispy coppa. The marrow was rich and delicious and was served with a 5 hour bacon jam that I could eat by the spoonful. Our final 2 non-dessert dishes were the pastas, and these were definitely my favorites of the bunch. The first was a homemade cavatelli with pork neck and sausage gravy and herb whipped ricotta. This ""gravy"" was sooo good (their gravy=a thick meat sauce to me). It was so flavorful and topped with the whipped ricotta it was just a really great dish.Our second pasta dish was the Duck Egg Pasta with duck confit, duck skin cracklins, scallions, and parmesan. Duck, duck....and more duck! (You were ready for goose, weren't you?) This dish was equally as delicious as the cavatelli but so different, in a very good way. The noodles were perfectly buttery and the dish actually felt light, like I might enjoy it on a patio on a spring day, if we ever end up seeing one of those around here. Everything just worked so well together, including the duck skin cracklins which I think may be my new favorite thing-partly just because I like the word ""cracklins""!Finally we made it too dessert. Yamandu clued us in to the fact that they make their own ice creams so we definitely had to try those. We also ordered the Homemade Pretzel Donuts based on his recommendation as well. The ice cream was exactly what you'd expect from homemade ice cream- a whole lot of creamy goodness. They had banana, butterfinger, and chocolate/coffee flavors-my favorites were the butterfinger and the chocolate/coffee. The pretzel donuts were warm and sugary, filled with a little chocolate and served with a warm chocolate drink for dipping-they made for a very sweet ending."
Definitely going to be a regular place.  The croquettes are to die for and the pork cutlets had such an amazing smoky char.  I am craving both as I write this.  Great service and nice atmosphere. It deserves its popularity I just hope I can get in when I want to.
"I enjoyed the atmosphere.  All the dishes I tried were very good but nothing so great that really impacted my life or stuck in my memory. I wouldn't go back for a specific dish, but would go back. A solid choice for a date or nice dinner, but not really ""an experience."" Not to say everything has to be so special or that they claim to be but it is around that price level where you start expecting it."
"Can't miss the duck fat potatoes, skirt steak, half chicken, or cavatelli.For ""share plates"" the portions are rather large, so for 2 people, 3-4 dishes max and you're good. Wish I had room for dessert; I saw ""puppy chow"" on there!My only concern is the lack of patrons. We were there from 5:30pm-8pm on a Wednesday and only 3 other tables were in there. It was empty for the first hour we were there. Hope TWO makes it!"
"Typically, I reserve 5 stars for food that is out of this world (only have given out a couple), but for this location I've made an exception.  The food was a solid 4 stars, but the service pushed the review over the edge.  First off, when I called to make the reservation, they asked if we would have any allergies/concerns in our group.  I mentioned that I was pregnant and they immediately went in to how safe their food was (pasteurized cheese, etc.) and which food that I would need to stay away from.  They were very accommodating in getting in our last minute reservation for 5 ppl and even more accommodating when I called 10 mins prior to arriving stating our group had grown to 8.  They said they would make it work.  Upon arrival, they greeted us promptly and took our jackets. Very personable staff and all were very knowledgeable.  We spoke with one of the owners for a bit who was very passionate about food and the quality of food served.  The passion showed in the dishes.  The food was impressive, but as seen in some other reviews some of the flavors were diluted or overpowered by others.  We opted for the Chef's Specialty Menu for $45 per person which was 6-8 courses including 2 desserts and it was perfect.  We were served a great portion of food with good variety and our bill was less than it would have been elsewhere with a group of this size.  There were for sure some stand-outs on the menu - the beet salad, fried chicken, black truffle risotto, and the nutella ice cream on a brownie.  Overall, it was a great experience with the customer service being the true highlight - not only super attentive and accommodating staff, but also genuinely suggesting items that we might like (an amazing mojito mocktail for me which was super nice - most other restaurants just accept my order of water without a second thought) and ensuring we received items that we mentioned we like.  I would return again and again to try new menu items and for sure would recommend it to others.  Thank you for not fitting into the mold of so many other up and coming trendy restaurants that tend to be distant and cold."
"Fave food spot in CHI right now. We went for the second time last night and dreaming about the ramp dankness. Great drinks to start. Great/attentive non pretentious Midwestern service. Awesome drink list from beer to wine. Come for the drinks and stay for the food.For the food the chef is on fire. Ramp bruschetta -super dank, ramp raviolo-dank, ramp-rissotto dank, half chicken-dank, mussels-dank, and the banana bread pudding-super dank. Get here ASAP for the ramp specials while they are still around with all the ramps sourced from @theplant. Less then 24hrs later already need to go back. Keep killing it guys."
"We first encountered the offerings of Two at Baconfest. We were impressed and eager to try the full menu. Our official visit did not disappoint. The food was fantastic. We ordered the special pasta of the evening, the market salad, the steak, the creamed corn and duck fat croquettes. The steak renewed my faith in steak after the let down of Longman & Eagle.The only issue that I had with our experience was the service. Our server was very uneducated about the menu. When I asked for a recommendation of how we course out our meal, the service proceeded to simply read off the menu items. BIG PROPS to the bus boy who became my go to for questions, recommendations, etc. That guy (whose name I sadly cannot recall) deserves a promotion big time!"
"From the very beginning, this place was two thumbs down. My friends waited 30 minutes for drinks to come. When we asked for bread with our meal, the waiter told us they were short on bread and couldn't bring it out unless it specifically came with our dish. And the worst part (in my opinion) is that they are extremely unfriendly for moms who are breastfeeding. They only have 1 women's bathroom. Before going in, I let a waitress know that I will need to use it for 10-15 minutes in order to pump for my daughter. Half way through 4 crazy ladies were banging on the door telling me that I'm not the only one here and can't be in there that long. They yelled other obscenities, that I won't mention here. But the experience was beyond upsetting. Two thumbs down."
I'm a little late on this review but my wife and I loved this place.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a handshake and we were early for our reservation so we hit the bar.  Good wine and craft beer selection.  Food was amazing.  The chicken leg was by far the best of our choices.  Not saying the others were bad but damn...I'm thinking about that chicken leg again.  A close 2nd was the pork belly.  Yum!  Service was on top of everything with a water and clearing the dishes.  I even dropped my water glass on the floor and they cleaned it up really quick.  Can't wait to go back!
"I think this is one of those places that people think is much better than it actually is because it is very trendy and moderately expensive. The dishes were prepared well (with the exception of extremely over-brined duck) but everything was fairly tasteless. Presentation was okay but not very utilitarian. I'm not sure if I just came on a bad night, but it wasn't great, definitely not worth the price. Prawns tasted as if they'd gone bad. Drinks were good though."
"I don't know why this place is named Two. It should be named Eleven. Because this place goes to Eleven.We went for the chef's tasting menu and we had a groupon which was a terrific deal, but even without that, you can get the tasting menu AND a bottle of wine well paired with the meal for $140 before tip. I think THAT is also a great deal. We got a light California pinot noir to go with the menu. It started with a light chilled asparagus salad in aioli. Light and delicious. The wine wasn't the best with that. we might have waited until the next thing to start drinking it, but who's going to wait to drink wine?  Anyway, next we got a grilled octopus that was so so flavorful. Very very good with the wine.  Third was a porterhouse pork chop with a spicy rapini that was OH MY GOSH. With the Wine! and the Pork!  OH MY GOSH!! Wow!  so good. That was probably the high point of the meal for me. Finally, though, came a creamy risotto with garlic and some kind of onion/shallot thing (I can't remember what it was called) in which they used the green part to give it a color and such flavor! Wowwsa!The staff were friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Knowledgable but not stuffy. Nice guys who just made our evening great.It was our anniversary, and they put a little candle in the dessert, an apple tart that was very good. Just right for the end of the meal. Such a lovely evening. I highly recommend (obviously.)  And do the tasting menu. It was such a fun surprise for each dish. (And the chef personally brought the first course. I thought that was cool.)"
"Everything was delicious and the staff were lovely!We went for my birthday, which was a Thursday, and the place was pretty quiet, which was nice. Every staff person greeted us and was friendly when we came in and they seated us and took care of us quickly. The whole time they were attentive and nice, never pushy or anything. We had 4 delicious course plus desert, all of which was great. Highly recommend the duck egg noodles, pork pastrami and the pheasant! Everything was again really good and the portions were perfect for small plates to share. The cocktails were creative but also tasty and the bread pudding for desert was really yummy.We would definitely recommend this place!"
"Really enjoyed my dining experience. Our waiter was wonderful and very helpful with the menu. Highly recommend coming with friends or for a special occasion. Some standout favorites were the New Style Cocktail, Mussels, Arctic Char and Scallops. Highly recommend saving room for dessert as the chocolate brownie with homemade Nutella ice cream was amazing. I will be back for sure!"
"Solid, farm-to-table type restaurant that is unpretentious, high quality, and reasonably priced.Came here in October and then again in December of 2014.  Both times parties of 4.  Both times made reservations which were honored promptly (some restaurants might make you wait for your reservation).  Both times dining area was lively but not uncomfortably full.  As the menu changes monthly, or even more frequently, I think you might find different dishes, but I thought the following were excellent: (1) duck fat taters, (2) port chops, (3) rib eye, (4) sirloin stake, (5) arctic char, and I can't remember a few more.Tried a few drinks, including beers, wine, and cocktails.  Beer selection was great, and I was able to find exactly what I wanted.  According to my friends, cocktails were from good to great.  Both times had dessert, and desserts were good, but not great.  Tried chocolate based desserts with ice cream, nothing fancy.I thought service was pleasant, helpful, not too pushy, and very responsive.Clarification about price.  First time, our bill for 4 was around $220 but we definitely ordered too much food, and each of us had at least 3 drinks + desserts + coffee/ tea.  Second time around, it was $190 including tip, and we ordered 6 savory dishes, 6 drinks, 2 desserts, and coffee / tea. Overall, great restaurant."
"Really, I might give this 3 & 1/2 stars. The service was very good, with the exception of a few weird things (2 separate servers referred to brussel sprouts as beats and, on our way out, someone got really aggressive about our coats. Admittedly this is a pet peeve of mine, but I also do not think it is ever appropriate to try to take someone's purse off their shoulder without consent). My problem with it is that I felt the food was overpriced. Everything on the menu seemed like an attempt at trendy, but without much behind it. The beet salad was good, but calling it a beet salad is a little disingenuous-- there was about 1 beat and the rest was spinach. Still very good, but the menu did not make this clear. PEI Mussles were good, but the real star of the dish was the broth and bread. Again, good but not great. If I had known that the best part of the dish was the bread, I would have opted for something else. The arctic char was very good and I would definitely get it again. For dessert we had the puppy chow-- which was easily the most regrettable part of the meal. You'd think at this kind of restaurant the puppy chow would have something special about it. Well, you'd be wrong (as I was). It tastes exactly like the stuff the girls lacrosse team used to bring to my high school for birthdays and bake sales. Nostalgic? Sure. But damn, I can make that stuff at home with minimal effort. It did not have any place in an expensive-ish meal.In all, I will not be returning. It's far from a disaster, but I don't think the value is there to justify the price point."
"We had a great experience at TWO for our anniversary dinner...almost. Parking on Saturday night was an absolute nightmare that threatened to make us late for our reservation (thankfully we got a rockstar parking spot just before we were about to lose our minds). Everyone was was friendly on our visit, but let's talk about the food.  Because THE FOOD. The artisan cocktails were outstanding. I especially enjoyed my ""Great Pumpkin"" cocktail. The duck fat croquettes that everyone raves about were good. Crispy, tasty and all, but I wish I tried one of the more interesting things on the menu because everything else was SO amazing. The mussels were perfect, about half the brussels sprouts were a little underdone for my taste but they were so yummy. And the butter poached lobster pasta, my god, I want to live in a bowl of this. It was to die for. But let's talk about steak, shall we? We ordered it mid-rare at the recommendation of our server. And we waited. And waited. Every course before this had come on the heels of the last, and it was perfectly timed. But this time, we waited. And waited. It wasn't until I think our server heard me whine, in jest, to my husband ""I want my steak"", that he scrambled to check on it. When it arrived, well, on no planet could it be considered medium rare. We don't mind ultra rare meat if it's well-seasoned and tender, which this kind of was? It was such a let-down after an amazing meal. The bread pudding we ordered at dessert was also *really* dry, so after a really great start it left us wanting. I didn't predict that from the first few courses. I did cap it off with the most amazing cappuccino, so that was helpful, but I was left thinking, would I come back? The good was so good I think we'd give it another go, but through the middle of the meal we were sure it would be a new favorite place. Bummer that it fizzled at the end."
"Finally made it here last week and loved it. It was a special night they gave us the corner table, huge bonus. They menu is great, offers some really interesting dishes that are so darn good. The best Pork Belly I have had anywhere for sure. The Risotto was very good too, creamy and lots of flavor. The staff and service was excellent too..."
"Excellent food! Tapas portions-friendly & knowledgable staff. Everything was great! Salmon, duck fettucini, banana pudding were the favorites. Bar and wait staff were very friendly, helpful and made for a great experience. Presentation was excellent."
"Two has been on my hit list for awhile. With its focus on small plates, compelling beverage program, and constantly shifting menu, could it live up to the hype? The food was definitely there and their parsnip risotto was fantastic (duck egg optional but I thought the duck egg really completed this dish). Because of the group I was with we ended up going with wine but I made sure to check out the beer list and it was great as well. The only odd thing was the service, our server was a bit hard to track down and seemed a little out of it. However, the staff in general was very attentive and the food was coursed and paced exceptionally well. Two was a great place, well worth checking out, and I could easily see myself going back soon especially with how often they claim they switch up their dishes. I'd love to pop in again soon and see truly how different the menu."
"I wholly enjoyed the Market Greens Salad w/Homemade Ricotta Fritters and the Duck Egg Pasta w/Duck Cracklings (tasted like bacon--yum!) and Parmesan. The Strawberry Shortcake w/Strawberry Gelato and House-Whipped Vanilla Bean Cream was supposed to be great, but the shortcake (that I was assured was made with butter) was a rather dry and bland. Maybe it was an off batch... Next time, I'll try the pretzel doughnuts.All in all, it was good, fresh, local fare, with friendly, warm, helpful service. Sounds like a winner to me!"
"Two occupies a really nice space with great ambiance - bar and a few tables out front, and a small dining room in the back. When all the tables are filled, this place gets really loud - like lean a foot from the waiter and shout to converse. The tables are also very close together, which only worsens that effect.We went for a Chef's tasting through a special deal, so it only cost us a fraction of the listed price - but I can't imagine anyone paying the $200 list price for the meal we received in particular. The meal was 2 glasses of champagne, 5 courses (4 + dessert), 2 glasses of wine with dinner, and 2 after dinner drinks. I really can't help but feel like they cheaped out for the tasting, maybe this was a special menu for the special deal... but I can't imagine that this is the ""best"" of the restaurant that they choose to represent in a ""tasting""Salad - boring dressing, boring components, could have built it at home, and I'm not exaggerating.Duck fat potato croquettes - really delicious. However, the couple next to us remarked that ""these are just like glorified tater tots"" and they were so right. Aka yummy but not too special.Mussels in tomato/absinthe sauce - this is the only dish that I thought was worth getting out of the whole menu. Really smoky interesting sauce that complemented the mussels without masking their natural flavor. The bread that came with it was delicious and grilled (even better!)Chestnut risotto - unoffensive flavor, nice execution, but altogether not memorable. Dessert - brioche donuts with cinnamon sugar and drinking (aka dipping, honestly) chocolate. ...I actually made a better version of this at home a few days ago, making this utterly unimpressive. However, that slightly bitter and mildly sweet chocolate is a perfect counterpoint to the donut... - *that* part I'm definitely stealing.Duck egg pasta - I ordered this off our menu, since it was so popular I felt like I had to try it. And it was SO greasy that right off the bat I was repulsed. The duck was confit'd in an unpleasant sort of way that I didn't enjoy. The pasta was just a tad undercooked. I was more than disappointed by this dish. If you talked this dish down before I tried it, I would've still disliked it. The two tables near us got charcuterie, and I think that'd be worth trying since it looked great. Roast chicken smelled great, almost like fried chicken =0 but at the end of the day... it's roast chicken.I don't think Two goes for innovation (there was very little), but I believe in their execution and like their farm to table concept. It was a perfectly pleasant meal (except for how loud it was), but in Chicago it might tend to get a little lost.The Friday evening population here is almost all 30s-50s it seems like, so maybe I'm just out of their target audience to enjoy their food as much? Could be. Maybe I'll come back in the spring/summer and see what they do with the plentiful bounty of fresh produce."
I was very please with Two... I'm not a big fan of small plates though UNLESS you order enough right from the start. The two of us started with a nice salad which was fine to split. We then had the mussels which were excellent but I would have preferred we each had our own. The duck egg fettuccini with duck confit was probably the tastiest of all but again I would have preferred my own... We also had a pork loin which was delicious and that was enough for two. Nice to mention also a wonderful wait staff and our food was timed and brought out perfectly... Also had a  nice cheese cake for desert which ended up being the right amount of food for dinner But when I go back I'm still ordering MORE..
"My co-worker and I went there using a Groupon and it was fabulous.  The staff was fantastic and their attention to detail and communication excellent.  Some restaurants treat Groupon customers with disdain but these folks were welcoming and embraced us. Top scores for the mussels, the duck fettuccine,  and the fluffy banana bread pudding."
"We celebrated our anniversary last night at Two, and loved it!We were a bit nervous when we got street parking right up front, and there were only two small groups in the restaurant. Well, that turned out to be a quite a blessing. Our waiter was perfectly attentive, and went above and beyond. One of our phones fell into a puddle on the way in, and our waiter was great to get us a bag of rice to dry it out. Saved our phone!!That was great...then we tried the food. We had the mixed green salad, the mussels,  and the chicken. Each was better than the next, and we enjoyed all of it!Great experience, great food!"
"Mediocre - good drinks, some hits and some misses on the food. The lobster risotto was delicious, but the fried chicken leg and pork chop were both subpar. As far as creating courses with the food, the only order was batching things to come out of the kitchen together.  Plates were whisked away well before we were finished, which after the first couple times got quite annoying.It's a safe spot for a date but not somewhere we plan to return."
"Celebrated a friend's birthday and ordered pork belly, chicken breast, Brussels sprouts, risotto, beet salad and chocolate brownie and ice cream dessert. Everything was amazing just wish portions were slightly larger. Would definately return! Love the seasonal menu idea, rustic interior and overall vibe."
"I have been here a couple times and the duckfat croquettes are amazing.  Overall excellent service and delicious small plates - great for sharing.  Cocktails were about average, and it was a little pricey for what you get, but overall I would definitely come back."
"Good stuff man.  The food is the focal point and basically what you're getting is a very filling dish on a small plate.  Fat, pork and sauces are plentiful on just about every dish.  The dishes are pseudo tapas style (if I can compare to something) but they will fill you up.  Some folks like it, others don't...but I'm a fan.  Service was professional and good.  One of the folks at our table had an issue with something non-food related and the manager was prompt to come over and check in.  This may be an odd thing, but I'm big on water glasses on the table.  For some reason I hate when it runs out and anyone in the party has to wait to have it refilled even if we have cocktails or wine.  But here, the glass was never below half full before someone would refill it.  Nice place, nice food and I have no problem coming here again and again."
"I don't understand where these 5 star reviews are coming from...the food is good, but it's not GREAT. :\My bf, his brother & his family, and I came to Two for an early dinner on Saturday.  The meal was honestly very mediocre, and for the prices Two charges, not worthy of 5 stars.  The breakdown of food we tried is as follows:- Charcuterie plate: the bf thought this was the best plate that we tried.  Our table's favorites were the chicken liver mousse & duck rillette.- Duck fat potato croquettes: these were among my favorites.  The croquettes are tater tot-sized.- PEI mussels: it came out and smelled really funky, sooooooo..I lost my appetite and didn't even have an interest in trying them.  I was told they're just meh.- Hampshire pork belly: it's kinda diff from the other pork belly I've tried, I think maybe bc the cut is thicker?- Ramp risotto w/duck egg: it was SO SALTY that one of the members of our party reported it to the waiter as ""inedible"".  No apologies whatsoever for the extremely over-salted dish, just a suggestion to mix everything up.  Doing so didn't curb the saltiness one bit.  Do yourself a favor and don't even bother.- Duck egg pasta: my fave dish of the night!!  I like light, non-creamy pastas, and the crispy duck skin really did something good for it.  For anybody who's had the Vitenamese dish mi vit, the pasta tastes almost exactly like mi vit broth.- Fazzoletti pasta: another favorite...and I'm not even a pasta person!- Homemade chorizo stuffed squid: I didn't try this, as I'm not a fan of stuffed squid, but it was reported that this dish was also average.- Sea scallops: I really enjoyed this, but if you want to pick at the salad it comes with, be warned that it's kinda salty. I didn't mind it too much bc I happen to like bacon haha.Drinks we tried:- Peach wheat beer (""Wheach""): yummyyyy.- Southern Tea: whatevs.- Strawberry something: as a fan of strawberry drinks, I enjoyed this.Service was friendly at the beginning but kinda lacking towards the end (from our waiter specifically, only bc he didn't really seem to care that we found our risotto to be inedible). Other helpers were on standby and were friendly and prompt to refill drinks, provide new drinks, provide new/clean plates.I won't be back to Two, and if you're undecided between Two and another restaurant, I'd recommend choosing the other restaurant.  Nothing here is particularly memorable or amazing."
"Some people have wisely pointed out that the target audience for Two seems to be in the range of 30 years old, and the mainstreamy pop music and the moderately uncomfortable wooden chairs are evidence of that--the chairs come from a library: like all the decor they are re-used or re-purposed (hence Two). But the people at our table averaged about 60 in age and we were surrounded by similarly mature diners. The four of us went to Two for restaurant week, but ended up ordering a la carte anyhow because it wasn't much more expensive. It was our first time and we all agreed we'd go back. What overrides the youth-oriented elements of the atmosphere starts with the incredible attentiveness of the staff--all of whom seemed to feel empowered to respond to our requests or to check on us, never saying ""let me get your waiter."" More importantly, things are served one or two dishes at a time for the whole table to share, which really promotes conversation and community at the table. I read a couple of reviews that complained about the slow progression of the meal, but I found it to be a big plus and, judging from the social engagement and general cheerfulness of the people at all the tables I could see I imagine the system works for most people. And then there's the food itself. We shared 6 dishes and two desserts, mostly small but never leaving anyone unsatisfied. Roasted beet/goat cheese/arrugula salad; polenta with mushrooms and a big fried duck egg; arctic char on barley; hangar steak (soft like butter!); the amazing potato puffs fried in duck fat, and brussel sprouts in cheddar cheese and bacon sauce. Without going into too much detail and ranking these, I can say that each dish merited a conversation, with some being more interesting but none being unwelcome. Desserts were the weak point--hence 4/5 stars here. Two could use some sprucing up in that department. We had a banana bread pudding that was a bit dry and an olive oil chocolate cake that was also not quite right in texture and combination of flavors. With drinks and tax/tip the bill was just over $200 for four. That's another reason folks on fixed incomes might be found frequenting Two."
"Really nice folks, plus good food all around. Fancy variation on smores for dessert was out of this world."
"Fantastic, out of this world food! Plates are portioned perfectly for sharing ""Midwestern tapas-style."" Liquor/wine selection is outrageously awesome with fun cocktails, to boot. ""Second life"" decor is a perfect fit for this awesome location. Chef Kevin & server AJ made sure our first visit was one to remember. The duck pasta & butternut squash risotto were beyond incredible. We left already looking forward to our next visit!"
"Sweet Jesus, this place was insanely good! I walked a decent distance from my hotel on Saint Clair after reading good revises and checking out their intriguing website. It doesn't necessarily look like much on the outside, but step in and you've got one of the coolest places with reclaimed and repurposed decor and furnishings around. I entered at the bar area and decided to eat bar side since I was solo. I could see into the main dining area and it was bustling and noisy. I was a little apprehensive because I was the only customer at the bar, but the bartender was friendly and put me at ease, which isn't as common as it should be between women.Loved the eclectic mix of music, the barstool I perched on which was made from old shipping freight boxes, and the old fans, repurposed into light fixtures. The bartender shared the history of the place and mentioned the fresh-made everything including house-cured meat, beef jerky, and even their own Two liquor. I ordered the halibut which was a perfect portion for a lighter appetite and perfectly prepared. I also had two good glasses of wine. The bar didn't fill up in my visit but a regular stopped in and we struck up friendly conversation. Then the charming owner stopped by to chat with us both and offered me a ride back to my hotel whenever I was ready to return. He was kind and not pretentious, as he didn't let on his status until after I asked if he worked there. The chef made a few appearances too, and I quickly felt like one of the regulars.The other diner ordered a couple of delicious items and although I was full, I agreed to taste his risotto dish which was incredible. The owner claims the magic ingredient is ramps. This proved another lucky stop as one of my two glasses of wine didn't hit my bill and because I was not hungry for dessert, a glass of Lambrusco was provided me complimentary.My halibut was $22 and my wine set me back a mere $8. Had I been especially hungry, I would have wanted a side or two to compliment the halibut, but overall the prices seemed more than fair for the quality of the food.This place proved an excellent option and I hope to return. Even better would be reconnecting with the personable staff and patrons I met. Thank you, Two for a fantastic dining experience for one that was anything but lonely!"
"Had a great dinner with friends at Two last night. Food was excellent and service was impeccable. One of the owners came by our table to introduce himself and chat, and then later sent over complimentary after dinner drinks. I can't believe I didn't know about this place before, but we will be back.  The price seemed very reasonable for the sophistication of the food and level of service. And I loved that the the atmosphere is upscale but still casual - definitely not stuffy or pretentious.Bonus: it's just a short (less than 10 min) walk from the Blue Line Grand station."
"Two was great. We had a few different wines and a few entrees as well. The truffle and lobster risotto, cheese plate, ribeye, and chocolate pave were amazing. This restaurant is off the beaten path but is a great place that has wonderful food in a nice casual environment."
"First off, I want to say that everyone one here was extremely nice and welcoming. Walked in and got a ""hello, how are you"" from everyone I passed, as I made my way to the hostess stand. I've visited my fair share of ""nice"" places where the people just seem like you are an inconvenience or you are below them. This is NOT one of those places. The person looking up our reservations greeted us with a big smile and a firm handshake, and pulled my chair out to seat me.Our server was also very nice and attentive. We ordered the Brussels sprouts, potato croquettes, pork belly, hanger steak, and puppy chow. Everything was delicious, perfectly portioned, although the puppy chow wasn't any different than the stuff I make at home (still ate all of it though). My friend also ordered one pumpkin beer and I had a beer flight. Total with 20% tip was just over $100.As I stood up to put my jacket on, a different server noticed, offered his assistance, and held the jacket for me to put on. So nice!I really enjoyed my experience here. Staff and food get 5 stars! I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu."
"Just finishing out dinner at this wonderful spot! We heard about Two from several sources that have proved to be right-this place is da bomb!! Used to be May St Market - not so good. This place is a complete 180! To add to the wonderful taste it is all local, organic, healthy, etc. it really is the best of many worlds. We ordered the heirloom tomato salad - delish and oh so fresh! The croquettes-mmmmm finger lickin yum - a bit greasy ill admit but its local grease ;))We ordered the thyme halibut w sweet corn and the ox tail. Ox tail is very rich in taste and again kind of greasy. I liked it, I didnt love it. The halibut on the other hand was da bomb! The sweet and buttery corn goes perfectly with the halibut. Then the dessert: the banana pudding and the peanut butter cream puffs w red currant preserves! What a perfect ending to our dinner! Oh and the owner of the place actually came by and asked us how the food and service was n stayed a bit to chat w us-great touch. The service was superb, the waiter came by to check on us throughout dinner and made great recommendations. Overall, highly recommend this place! It is also very reasonably priced."
"This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in Chicago. The food is served similar to tapas style. I went with 5 girls and we shared a total of 7 plates: 5 for our meal and 2 desserts. We ordered the duck egg fettuccine, risotto with duck egg on top, duck fat potato croquettes, pei mussels, and the ham board. Everything was delicious but my fave was the fettuccine and the sauce on the mussels was outstanding.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The service was good at best. My friend made reservations for 9:30pm but we didn't get seated until almost 10pm. We hung out by the bar area and bought a few drinks. The ambiance is trendy casual. Overall, good experience. Their menu changes so I'll be back."
"Dinner does not get better than when you enjoy it at  TWO.  Small plates pricing is a great value for the quality and quantity of food served. Service was attentive but not over baring. Our party of 3 ordered 11 of the 18 items on the menu (including charcuterie, salad, sides, main and dessert courses) and at least 6 different cocktails, all where phenomenal. I cannot wait to go back and try the 7 dishes we did not order and 6 more unique cocktails.  There is something for everyone: vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, decadent desserts, strong, aged scotch or gentle vodka.  If you have not dined at TWO yet, get there while you still can with a reservation a week or two in advance and not a month or two in advance."
Fantastic meal with a great atmosphere. Delicious drinks too!
"Maybe TWO is for TWO THUMBS UP because that's what ""this girl"" gives it.  Two of us got cozy last night for an after-Christmas dinner of someone-else-cooking. It was the perfect relaxed environment to take in extraordinarily fresh share plates in West Town.I can't believe TWO has been open for a year and a half and I've never heard of it!  What a great restaurant to randomly discover (a colleague's recommendation).  I almost don't want to tell people about this because I was able to make a same day reservation.  But Yelp I must...5 dishes were all delicious: - Market Green Salad included lightly-fried ricotta balls that were heavenly! - Octopus with potatoes, and scallion vinaigrette was super tasty despite a strange consistency- The Salmon special was the most perfectly cooked medium-rare salmon I have ever had, with crispy potatoes, a odd choice but it worked- Duck egg fettuccine, just order this because you have to!  Fantastic and fresh, not heavy.- Banana Bread Pudding with homemade vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce, holy h*ll that's good.The server was great and really knowledgeable about the wine list (I ended up with a great pinot noir) and cocktails (BF had TWO new old fashioneds).  It was a treat that they threw in two small red dessert wines after dinner for a perfect end to the evening.The General Manager Yamandú Pérez stopped by our table to recommend we eat the garlic sprouts that were on the side of a plate (we thought they were just added decoration).  He talked about their ingredient sourcing, brought two more kinds of sprouts for us to try, and overall just seemed really passionate about what they have going on in this little kitchen in a corner of Chicago.  We loved it!TWO definitely hits the spot... I will be back for seconds as soon as possible."
"I came here for my Birthday dinner and was beyond impressed.  The place itself is physically a bit cramped. Once you sit down though, you completely forget about that.  It's such a warm inviting experience and everyone is so friendly. I was completely taken back by how excellent the service was.  If you are opening a restaurant and you want advice on how to completely satisfy a customer in regards to service, head to this place and bring a notepad. Ok so you have gathered that I was very impressed with their service. Now on to the food itself.  It was AWESOME! We started with the market mixed greens salad, it was awesome. Fresh greens and vegetables, the ricotta balls that came with it were creamy and so tasty!  The duck fat potato croquettes were really good! Then onto the entrees, duck confit fettuccine, hanger steak, the superior white fish, the honey chicken leg, the pork belly. I literally loved every single dish.  They are medium plates so you order multiple plates and share them with the table (if you wish).  The party I was with couldn't stop raving about the duck confit fettuccine. The hanger steak was so juicy and melted in your mouth!Dessert was a must.  We ordered all of their dessert options. The ones that stuck out were the puppy chow (mmmmmmmmm puppy chow) and the chocolate pave with nutella ice cream. Great date spot or place to bring some friends. 5/5 will definitely be back."
"Had a nice dinner at Two months ago, and will reiterate what most are saying- Two is a lovely spot to get farm to table small plates, good service, and great drinks.Specializing in mixed drinks, I had the Blueberry Surprise (Buffalo Trace bourbon on the rocks w/blueberries) and it was very good. It's small plates for sharing, here. The way to go here, is to come hungry, or don't come at all; and try a variety of dishes. - Beet Salad- it's a ""Beet Happening""! Mixed greens w/sweet peppers, I love a salad to keep it healthy- Duck Egg Pasta - loved this dish. Just the right amount of duck, a can't miss.- Braised beef check- served on crostini, w/apples and ricotta. pretty good.- PEI Mussels- nice broth, served with bacon and fingerling potatoes. I would say another can't miss dish.- Red Grouper- a nice dish with leeks and again fingerling potatoesDidn't get dessert because we were too stuffed. There are two rooms here, with a bar in the first room. The second main dining area is comfortable. I could see coming to Two for a special occasion night out, or with a small group to try a bunch of plates! I'm a fan!"
"Really, really enjoyed this place.  It feels as though I had to trek to no-man's land to get there (Yes, I am being a little melodramatic), but I cannot think of anything bad to say about my experience.  We had delicious wine, great food and fantastic service... This place definitely deserves a visit!"
"Made reservations for 8 at 730pm on a Friday. Made reservations about three weeks in advanced. Super easy. I was so impressed by the ambience. It's like an urban farmhouse. The details of the decor made it rustic but the layout, tones, and mood was very urban. Classy place. Each of us ordered 2 plates from them menu and shared family style. It was a wonderful way of tasting a lot of delicious food! The beer salad and hanger steak stood out. Our fried chicken thighs came late so we cancelled the order because we were too full. Each of us paid $60 with tip to split the bill. Which I think is reasonable since we left feeling full, satisfied, and had cocktails and wine in our bellies. I would definitely go again! Parking isn't tough around there even though most of us biked. Great dining experience!"
Really great place. Duck fat croquettes are amazing. Service was attentive and helpful with gluten free needs.
"Tapas-style plates, each unique. We didn't really need two plates per person, which is what they recommended. Pasta especially good. Seasonal white asparagus salad was our favorite."
"Went to Two for an anniversary dinner and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves - the food AND service were outstanding. I had made a reservation here before I found out about the current groupon they were offering. When I looked to see if there was an opening to use said Groupon on the night and time I wanted there was not. When I called and explained that I had a previous reservation but could we apply the Groupon to it they were more than accommodating and helped to explain how to book the Groupon and then they would approve it and change it for me on their end. I've been to a lot of restaurants where they treat you less than great for even using a groupon there (which just makes no sense since no one forces them to participate) much less go out of their way to make it work for you. Not only that but this Groupon was pretty amazing. I haven't bought many groupons in a while now but this one seemed to good to be true - and yet I was so glad to find out it was even better than I could have hoped. For $80 we got 5 courses and a bottle of wine - which they gave us 3 options on and was actually delicious. Truth be told we expected them to put down a bottle and essentially say deal with it but we were walked through the choices and really enjoyed the one we went with (Sangiovese/Chianti blend). The food was perfect for us and we were definitely full at the end. The 5 courses consisted of:Seasonal salad with bacon vinaigrette - bacon was amazingMussels in a tomato broth - very good, bit spicyHomemade pork sausage with a cherry bourbon sauce - again, the meat was really niceRamp risotto - I'm 100% obsessed with ramps and was so happy to see this on their menu still. I saw reviews on it from spring and was thrilled they had puréed and froze some of the leaves to continue using into the summer. Our waiter said they were almost out - so hurry if you love ramps as much as I do! The risotto was done perfect, al Dente and the cheese to ramp flavoring was sooo good. We pick (and eat) a ton of fresh ramps from my bf's family farm and from experience (and again, obsession) I can say this was one of the best ways I have had ramps done. Banana bread pudding cupcake and homemade ice cream (can't remember what kind - sorry!) for dessert - very yummy. The bread pudding was be perfect mix of warm, soft and a little crusty in parts. Beyond the food I can't say enough for the service. I had noted when I made the original reservation on Yelp (not through the groupon) that it was our anniversary and they mentioned this several times through the evening and gave us a candle on our dessert. Cute. They explained the dishes without being overbearing and we're super knowledgeable on any additional questions we had (like how exactly do I copy this ramp risotto)?! We love eating out and set aside money each month to do so often and I love when we find a gem like this where the meal/experience is enjoyable from start to finish. I would 100% come back and pay full boat sans groupon and try some more of their food and enjoy being at Two for an evening. I do think it's starting to really pop off (especially with the Groupon offer) which always worries me a bit if quality of food or service will suffer but I'll definitely be back again to find out. Yay for Two!!"
Instantly one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Every dish we tried was extremely well-executed and delicious. The most memorable course was probably the duck fat potato croquettes - so amazing! The service was top-notch and the atmosphere was simple yet elegant. I will absolutely be visiting again!
"[ Visisted January, 2014 ]Really enjoyed the food and service at Two, and highly recommend the suckling pig and the brisket dish. My only beef was that we had a reservation made for 7:30pm and didn't get a table until 7:45pm. For that, Two loses a star."
"A last minute decision to dine at TWO before a concert ended up being the best decision! The owner welcomed us with warmth and a handshake, we were seated in the vibrant environment and proceeded to enjoy a most delicious meal. Plates are small so my husband and I were able to share bites of a variety of meal options that did not disappoint. We ended our meal with two tasty desserts and cappuccinos. Did I say how great the service was?"
"Took my girlfriend here last week. Cool entrance, very quiet bar with a TV on with no sound. Waitress was very nice but for the price the food was just mediocre. Nothing terrible. I finished all my plates but the portions were small and nothing exceptional. The risotto was probably the highlight of the meal so if you do choose to go I would recommend that dish."
"Went here Last night for Restaurant Week! I had the Beet Salad, Polenta, Rissoto and the Brioche Donuts. I loved it, the flavor was good and portions were also a decent size. I would highly consider coming here for Restaurant week, its $33 for dinner and you really get 4 courses.Only negative thing is how long it would take each course to come out. I arrived at 10:30 and didn't leave til 12:30 am."
"Hot damn, this place is GOOD. Came here with my monthly dinner club and its definitely one of our Top Two (maybe even #1!). They get A+ for Food, Service, Decor.It's meant to be shared plates so with 5 of us we ordered 12 dishes (almost the entire menu....). This style of dining is so popular now but many places tend to be heavy handed with flavors and salt. They managed to find the right balance of comfort without over flavoring/salting their dishes.Everything was tasty, but here are the MUST TRYs IMHODuck Egg Pasta - read a ton about it. Didn't disappoint. Some of the best cooked duck I've had and the dish has a whole was really well balancedDuck Egg Risotto - We almost got a cavatappi instead but our server steered us towards the risotto and it lived up. Maybe some of the best risotto I've had! The richness of the duck egg was so dreamy with the rest of the dish. Again, really well balanced.Hanger Steak - Not only perfectly cooked but extremely flavorful and well seasonedBanana Split - Server talked up the ice cream and again she did not steer us wrong. We ended up ordering all 3 desserts actually :oP and this was my fav because it had all 3 different delicious ice creams! (Pretzel donuts were a close 2nd).Other highlights for me - Scallops (paired with a delicious thyme veg medley), Beet Salad. But honestly, cannot go wrong with anything here.AND, to top of it off they had a great beer list at reasonable prices. I loved the rustic decor as well. I will definitely be back here!"
"We ate here last night with another couple.  It's tough to eat here with just two because you want to try so many of the choices.  Our favorites were the duck pasta, risotto, tomato burrata salad, broccoli, and bread pudding.  We did not have one bad dish -- all were so good.  Great drinks too.  Service was perfect.  Owner was really personable too...shaking our hands when we came in - obviously cares about the customers."
"What a neighborhood gem.  Two brings in seasonal ingredients from nearby places like Nichols Farm (asparagus) and then layers in bright and rich notes (foie, pinenuts, lemon zest.)  The charcuterie plate featured delicate smoked char and chewy tender beef jerky.  The halibut with early summer vegetables was amazing, one of the best fish I've had all year.  Hangar steak was intensified by a dark chile crust and a slaw of cabbage, radish and red chiles.  The dogs of dinner, and they don't deserve to be in the doghouse, were the fried dishes: the croquettes and the pretzel donuts.  Frying felt out of place amongst the vibrance of the meat and produce on hand.  Two couples the great cooking with on point service: I'm coming back to eat flavorful and seasonal food in the neighborhood."
"Thankfully better than May Street Market!I'm breaking my two visit rule before review, but since this was such a good experience let's get crazy...First of all the Old Fashioned which is called a ""New Style"" was really good.  Top five in my book.  So if anything, grab a ""New Style"" and have at it.  Dinner was very solid, and didn't blow me away, but was very very good.  We ordered four things...steak, veggie, octopus and something else that I can't remember.  The octopus was just so-so, but the brussel sprouts were fantastic and the steak was solid.  We walked out thinking, yeah we'll come back.  It didn't break the bank and we really enjoyed our dinner.I wanted to try so many other things, so it merits another visit.  I'll update if anything changes!"
"The menu is clear and sweet, the atmosphere there is very good. The serving pace is smooth and comfortable. Also, the cuisine make us surprised."
"My review is based on the food for restaurant week.  The menu for restaurant week sounded so yummy. Since we have never been there before, why not try it out during restaurant week?  Maybe the food would have been better off of the menu.  The portion was extremely small. My scallop entree literally only had two scallops which was served in a small soup bowl. No bread came with the meal. Other folks ordered the Berkshire pork chop. It was cut so thin. Probably a quarter of an inch with 4 small roasted potatoes on the plate. The only full size portion of the 3 course meal was desserts. Serve was wonderful but i will skip on going back. Our meal was $33 pp not including tax or tip and we were all hungry after dinner was over!"
"I've been to one too many places during restaurant week, only to be disappointed by the places selections for their special prix fixe menu.  Most nicer establishments tend to serve the cheapest of the cheap to protect their margins.  Ever notice how pasta makes it into the lineup?  Anyway, enough with my rant.  Two's restaurant week menu was absolutely outstanding.  I didn't order the duck pasta, but my friend did and I ended up eating several bites of her dish.  Wow, the pasta was prepared to perfection, and the duck........crisp duck skin and meat with the perfect amount of fat!  I was in heaven.  My risotto I opted for was a damn good dish.  With pancetta and topped with a fried egg, what's not to like?  I was thrilled to see that both of these dishes are on the regular menu, since I plan on returning next time I'm in town.  Service was excellent and the atmosphere was cozy, which was perfect on a chilly winter night.  We sat in the bar area at one of the communal tables.  All in all, the whole experience at Two was a memorable one.  It, seriously, was one of the best $33 I've spent on a meal.  Furthermore, the portions were HUGE!  It's a rarity for a meal to defeat me, but I'm ashamed to say that I left some banana bread pudding on the plate - not because it wasn't tasty but because I was ready to explode.  And yes, the desserts alone are worth paying Two a visit!"
"Very good, very cool. Almost trying too hard to be cool but hey that's Chicago in your twenties. Dined here during restaurant week so with two diners we were able to try 6 items.Duck noodle dish was out of this world.Good to check out if you are looking for something trendy, not so much homestyle, but flavorful."
"What an excellent dining experience! Every single dish was exquisite and left us longing for another bite. Some of the best mussels we've ever had, and the sauce... To die for! We thought about asking for more bread with the sauce, but before we had the chance to ask, the server brought an extra plate of perfectly crisp slices of toast. Even had a visit and chat from the owner. Needless to say, the service was phenomenal. The selected music playlist added to the relaxing, upscale ambiance. It was an unforgettable beginning to an excellent evening."
"Well, I think I just found my new favorite restaurant. I love food (as do many of you out there), and to call this my new favorite is quite the acknowledgement... Let me explain why I'm Two's newest groupie...I recently had an 8:30 reservation. Saturday night, to be exact. I walked in with my date and as soon as we walked through the door, I noticed 1) a vibrant, busy bar (usually a good sign that this place is going to be delicious) and 2) an open, airy space with decent lighting. (Lately I've been noticing restaurants getting darker and darker, and I cannot see a thing! [Or perhaps I'm just getting older... Womp. Womp.]) Anyway, the owner/manager checked us in. He introduced himself and he told me his name twice but I still cannot remember how to spell it. (Forgive me, kind sir!) Either way, he was incredibly friendly, shook my hand (I respect that gesture a lot.), and welcomed us to Two. He asked how we found out about Two, and I said ""Oh, probably something I read online or Yelp."" I joked I'm a ""Yelper,"" and he chuckled when I said, ""So I'll be EXTRA attentive tonight!"" It was also my birthday and he said he'd sit us at a prime table. He gave us a table for 2 with a window view. (It was a fantastic table for people watching both inside the restaurant and folks walking down Grand Avenue. However, it was a *little* cold being right on the edge of the window...) Anyway, we were greeted immediately by our server. I love that all the waitstaff wear casual black tees with the restaurant's emblem on it (nice logo design by the way!). We ordered (by the way, they ran out of the Berkshire pork belly and pork shank that night. I really wanted to get in that pork action too! But oh well...):(For my cocktail, I ordered ""Rosemary's Baby."" It was a bit citrusy with a rosemary garnish. The garnish was a tad too big. Sometimes garnishing with herbs can run the risk of looking like a small garden plant so I'd cut the size an inch or two... Nevertheless, it was mighty tasty!)1. Homemade Andouille sausage: Delicious. Quite spicy (in terms of flavor and heat!). It was pretty much a deconstructed hot dog in my opinion. It was fun to eat!2. Duck egg pasta: The noodles were beautifully cooked. Al dente. The duck cracklins (similar to Filipino pork chicharon) were a nicely added crunch to the otherwise delicate dish.3.Homemade ricotta cavatelli: A bit on the rich and oily side, but nonetheless, the flavors were on point. The subtle sage flavor was a lovely touch. 4. P.E.I. mussels: Probably my favorite of the night. I love mussels and though most high-end places cook them quite similarly (white wine base, some bits of meat, blah blah blah), Two added homemade chorizo, shallots, and for me, it was the mint that gave this dish a lot of depth. It complemented the mussels beautifully.5. Banana bread pudding: Alright... and the pièce de résistance! Since it was my birthday, I find birthday cake to be a bit overrated. (Personally, I'd be happy if you stuck a candle in a doughnut or a piece of apple pie instead of a slice of plain cake, but that's just me.) 9 times out of 10, when I see bread pudding on the dessert menu, I order it... so, I did. The banana bread pudding was my other favorite of the night. It resembled the texture of moister banana flavored baguette croutons. It was also slightly charred on the tips. Sometimes bread pudding can be mushy or too moist. This had some moist parts and crunchy areas. So nice! The salted bourbon caramel and vanilla ice cream completed this plate of sugary heaven. A must-order! The service was great, and the pace/order of the food coming out was just right. The owner/manager came back out, sat next to me, and asked for my opinion. (I thought that was a personal, but welcomed encounter. Most of the time, owners and managers don't show face or aren't even present. I love that he was there and engaging with the diners.) I told him how much I enjoyed the meal, and that I could not have imagined a better place to celebrate my birthday (or just life!). I wouldn't mind coming again for a special occasion or just because it's Tuesday. Both he and the server mentioned they started serving brunch as well and they have a connection with Revolution Brewery in Logan Square. (Nice!!) I intend to make this a regular place to dine. West Town continues to rule my epicurean world. Two Restaurant solidified my appreciation for West Town's culinary gems. GO. TO. TWO. NOW."
great unique cocktails. Well thought out food choices. Lots of bacon.I'd recommend it and for sure will be back!
"Went here to celebrate my boyfriends 30th. Wonderful experience - Great food, Great service and welcoming atmosphere."
"From the grilled octopus to the age sirloin steak, the homemade pasta to the banana bread pudding - this restaurant was fabulous. Each of the dishes was simple, yet extremely flavorful and was seasoned perfectly. The beets with burata, broccoli, and espresso martinis were all delicious as well. Our server was a doll and the entire restaurant team made sure we always had fresh share plates and water. Great attention to detail on every level!"
"Go here.  Go here now!Okay . . if I wasn't so verbose- this should be enough to get my friends to try this newest reincarnation of what used to be May Street Market (you know where I'm talking about- that crazy little stretch of Grand Ave that seems an odd choice for a great restaurant!)  But since I have been raving to anyone who will listen since I ate here last week, I will tell you just a little more about this place.Open for about 4 months, Two is named because of the reused items that line the walls to create the ""homey"" feeling of the space.  The bar, while small, has a mix of micro brews, a very nice wine list and a cocktail menu that will satisfy even the pickiest cocktailers.  We arrived early for our dinner reservation and received outstanding service from Sean behind the bar who was eager to tell us about the space and the team that put it together.Speaking of that team, when I walked in, I was warmly greeted by the host who looked familiar to me.  Turns out he is also the owner and I finally put two and two together as to who this was.  Yamandu Perez used to be the chef/owner of Zak's out in Hinsdale which was one of my favorite places in town.  Two is his new venture although he is not cooking here- leaving that to two other local talented chefs.Well, enough of the background.  On to the real shining star of the night . . . .THE FOOD!  The menu is full of mid sized plates- plenty big enough to share.  And since so many things on the menu looked so good- we went with all the suggestions that our server suggested.My friend started with the market salad which was a nice mix of greens topped with fresh Parmesan and a dressing that was very different but delicious!  We them moved on to the ""duck fat"" potato croquettes.  These are a must have as the sauce that is served with them perfectly complements the Parmesan dusted golden sticks.  Next up the grilled octopus, half chicken and sausage.  Wow!  While I took enough food home for the next day- I loved it all.  The sausage has to be made in house and is the size of a knock wurst and that chicken so tasty- I just kept eating it.  And I am one of those who scoffs at the very idea of eating chicken out since it's one of the few things I can actually make myself.  But trust me . . . it is order worthy!And if that wasn't enough- we ordered the banana split (be still my heart) for dessert.  This is no Dairy Queen treat.  Oh no, my friends, this is a caramelized split banana topped with three kinds of homemade ice cream (banana, vanilla and I'm still not sure what the final flavor was . . .maybe coffee?) and then the whole thing is garnished with a couple of thin cookie wafers and drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauce.  If you are not hungry yet you must be sitting at Two with one of these decadent delights in front of you!!!A couple of functional points for you:  They do have valet parking for $10 but depending on the night you are here- you will probably be able to find street parking on Grand given many of the store fronts are empty and this location ends up pretty much being a destination as there is little else to do around it.  Dinner for two with enough food for three ran about $110.  They take reservations so make them or you may find yourself waiting or sitting at one of the communal tables in the bar area.All in all- a great new addition to the Chicago dining scene!  Terrific food, outstanding service (wish I could remember my server's name- my receipt says Nishi but if that's the case I called her the wrong name all night cuz that doesn't seem to ring a bell . . . .hmm . . . .how much wine did I drink???)Go here.  Go now.  You can thank me for the suggestion later!"
"This place is absolutely incredible. In November, we ate dinner here for my 30th birthday and had amazing service and delicious food. They accommodated our large party expertly and warmly welcomed us to the restaurant. Whenever I want to impress out of town guests, I take them to ""Two,"" where I know they will be wowed by delicious food and hospitality."
"""Wow...just wow.""  That's what I said after eating one of the dishes at TWO and believe me, I will be back.About a third of time, when I buy a voucher to use at a restaurant (via Groupon, Living Social, Gilt City or in this case, Bloomspot), I come away with a new restaurant to add to my rotation, and TWO's deal through Bloomspot of $20 for $40 worth of food got me in.  Damn, this was great food.My wife and I had the market green salad, the pork chop with mashed potatoes, and the duck egg pasta, which led to the comment that led this review.  All three dishes were perfect, seasoned but not overly seasoned, served with care and priced reasonably for the portion size.  We had to run to a show downtown so we didn't stay for dessert, my only regret of the evening.  Otherwise, I can't wait to go back!!"
"If you're a fan of farm to table American-fare, this is the place for you.This has to be one of my top 10 favorite places in Chicago (and I eat out a ton). I liked it so much, I had my birthday there. The drinks are amazing and every dish is good. The service is great and the manager has always come to say hello. Definitely try this place out."
I was extremely disappointed in the service and the food.  It was a mediocre experience.
Everything cooked well and portioned to share. Split 5 dishes and left there full. Shrimp grits was hearty and risotto was perfect. Pasta duck leg confit was lacking duck but can't really complain when it comes with a cocktail for 13$.
"I came to Two with my family and we had a great experience. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, making dinner very enjoyable. We ordered a couple of different plates that we all shared; the ingredients were fresh and the food was solid, but did not blow me away. I won't forget the bread pudding though, that was amazing!!"
"I have nothing against the farm-to-table movement, but it's not a reason for me to choose one restaurant over another.  I'm just interested in great food and great service.  Two offers exactly that.We tried the mixed greens salad (good), the roasted broccoli and cauliflower (I don't care for either of these vegetables, but they are great here), the duck breast served on a bed of barley and chili peppers (wow) a ramp raviolo with egg (excellent) and the donut with ice cream (I could eat that as a main course).My wife has a food allergy.  The staff at Two took it seriously and adjusted the entrees to meet her needs.  I know it's a hassle for them, but it really shows off the quality of the team."
"Went here last week on a Thursday and had the best dining experience! The chefs know what they are doing as well as the servers. It has to be the best service I've ever had and great selection of sharing plates, which is another favorite thing about this place. Will definitely come back!"
"So two caveats upfront -- 1) I am a vegetarian and this place isn't 2) we were a party of 18 and they had no idea what hit them tonight. First, our cocktails came out all mixed up and for some, even not what they had ordered. The ones ordering wine had an easier job. Second, our server was totally helpless and clueless. She didn't know what they could make vegetarian, she didn't want to check, she wanted to just be done with her shift and go home. Break -- the manager came out after a whole big mess with cocktails and took it upon himself to order for the table. Third, food started to come out but in random orders of same thing twice or more/less order without keeping it consistent across the table. And then the server says, oh this is vegetarian except for the duck fat it was cooked in. That's not really vegetarian, is it? Break -- the manager tried for me, he sent some potatoes, brussel sprouts and a salad. It was a friend's birthday and at the end of the day, the company matters and we all had a great time with each other."
Great experience all around. Table was ready as reserved and the greeter was personable. The food was superb! A lot of fun items to share and wonderful bar drinks. Well with it!
"Two is quite the find! The food is excellent. Went here with a group of 10, so the staff suggested (rather strongly) that we go with the price fix dinner for $40. Hesitant at first, we were glad we went with the recommendation.The Smoked Trout on Crostini, the Roast Pork Belly, and this divine roast chicken were all standouts. Dessert included a good bread pudding, and a rather special fresh fig sorbet. Fig. Sorbet. And I don't even like sorbets. But this one was memorable. The menu here changes often, but go with it. It's hard not to enjoy this place.Note - A tad on the noisy side."
You must go to this place.I probably have passed this place on the way home from work over a 100 times and I finally got around to trying it with 3 of my friends.  Between the 4 of us we ordered 8 items and everything was amazing.  You can order all at once and they space out every dish for you.Server was super helpful with the wine selection and knew alot about each menu item we chose.The banana pudding was the best and probably sealed my food coma fate.
"The space is comfortable and not too serious and the service was outstanding. The boyf and I didn't speak until we finished the risotto with a fried duck egg on top because honestly, there are no words for that kind of goodness. Everything we had was delightful, and I wish I could come back to try everything else. Four dishes for two people plus a little dessert if you're feeling indulgent is perfect. The cocktail we had was fantastic (eleven twenty two?) and was a no-frills, plain good bourbon drink. Parking is easy and everything is reasonable priced for the amount of flavor and imagination you get with every dish."
"Came here for an early dinner with a groupon. I was a little leery of what we might get because the groupon was for a set chef's menu. Being of picky taste, I was worried I would be fed a bunch of food I didn't like. Boy was I in for a treat! The food was sooo delicious. I think I might even like mussels now. The service was terrific and even their house wine served with the groupon was good. I will definitely be back yo try things off their regular menu!! I kept looking at the tables around us scoping them out! Looked amazing. I love the small shared plates because that means I get to try everything."
"I highly recommend Two.   We went during Restaurant Week but actually just ordered dinner off the regular menu.  The mixed greens, golden beet salad and cauliflower were all excellent.   The risotto was good but a little too rich for my taste though the black truffle made it impossible to stop eating it.   Desserts were outstanding.  Service was also superb with all staff very attentive."
"BF and I bought a couples date on howaboutwe at Two, for $100. It was supposed to include 5 shared plates and three glasses of wine each. Two had stellar reviews on Yelp, and it seemed like a pretty decent deal, so we very excitedly went there. To our surprise, we were served the cheapest and most carb heavy food they had. We can't judge the whole menu, but here is what we got:- a simple salad, blah. - potato croquettes: good but very filling- polenta with mushroom: very good, but polenta after potato croquettes??- chicken, quite good, but yeah don't go try to give us something fancy. - and for dessert, mini donuts with some chocolate sauce. Yes seriously mini donuts, after the polenta and the potato croquettes. Was not great either.The wine was okay. Overall, we were extremely disappointed and felt cheated. Well, we won't go again. There are a lot of great restaurants in Chicago where one can drink and eat for $100. We will go there and make sure to avoid Two in the future."
"Impressed. As was my date who does not reside in Chicago. The name made sense after the waitress explained we should each order two dishes and share them all. I'm usually not big on sharing, but for two people this was perfect, ample portions for a nice dinner.Duck fat croquettes - fried mashed potatoes with with a spicy sauce. Good way to start and they melt in your mouth.P.E.I Mussels - can you ever go wrong with white wine and butter? No, and you will need to order more of the grilled baguette to sop of the rest of the juices. Mussels and chorizo = winner.Fried chicken thigh - a little on the skimpy side. I say that because I often grill chicken thighs at home (cheap meat, on the bone, and juicy). Although good, maybe its the over indulgent American in me wanting a larger portion (and I know how much they cost). Berkshire pork belly - slap me and call me a bitch this was the best dish we had. The gal from Texas said this was the best prepared pork belly she had ever eaten. That should tell you something right there.Clean decor and they take reservations online. Strong drinks, the Habitual Manhattan was our choice, and only gets better as it melts into the evening. Price was reasonable, atmosphere was calm but buzzing, and the service didn't skip a beat. I will be back in the near future. I really don't have anything poor to say about Two. It would be in your best interest to grab a friend and try some of their creations."
"Came to TWO for a date night because we wanted to try a new place. The experience started out slow because even though we had a reservation we had to wait 25 minutes for our table. After that the service was great, but the food varied. The potato croquettes were cold and the sirloin was SO salty. But the bruschetta, the cream corn risotto, and the half chicken were all delicious.I really debated whether to give them a 3 or a 4 but I think that overall, it was a good experience but it didn't stand out. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go back again."
"Never heard of this place before going, but since I'm a huge farm-to-table fan, this was my cup of tea. We ordered the market salad, octopus, scallops. Octopus was by far my favorite. The scallops were cooked perfectly but for some reason I wasn't completely crazy about them. We ended with pumpkin doughnuts and fig sorbet. I LOVED the sorbet but not being a fan of doughnuts in general, can't comment much on those."
The food was awesome.  My family enjoyed the food as well as the wonderful service.  We enjoyed picking from the menu
"Great place with an awesome interior design all made from recycled items and materials. We came here for a private event partnered with Revolution Brewing for a 5-course pairing, so I can't speak too much to the regular menu. But it's mostly a farm to table menu with all fresh ingredients. Great food! Very fresh and very interesting menu! I'd definitely come back for the regular menu!"
"What a find! I made reservations here after reading an esteemed yelper's rave review of this place, and was very impressed! Excellent food, and excellent service.Some of the food was absolutely amazing. The croquettes and the pork belly were outstanding as was the banana split (it's hard to turn down different flavors of homemade ice cream with caramelized bananas).The place is also a good size. It's big enough that the noise of other tables is muffled, but small enough that you can have a nice intimate meal with the company you are with and not have to yell to each other.The service is definitely good. Our server gave us some good tips (and didn't judge us when we kept ordering more and more food), and everyone was genuinely happy to be there serving us. The owner even came by to make sure we were happy with our meal. I don't always love this part, but I suppose I appreciate that he cared about our experience. Tip - Location is kind of on its own so getting a cab was not the easiest after the meal, but it wasn't impossible. The place is definitely worth the trip."
Awesome service. Really down to earth feel for the west loop. Scallops are a must. Also the duck fat croquettes. Wow. We'll be coming back. Two is fantastic'
"Went to Two last night with my girlfriend and another couple, who are avid foodies and always game to try new places.   We both had purchased the Groupon for the Chef's tasting menu, which turned out to be a really good call.  We both got there right at the appointed hour and were met with a warm welcome and seated quickly.  The staff there is uber casual and a bit unpolished despite the fact that the menu/prices are a bit upscale, but that is fine by me as no one in our party is uber formal.   The Groupon deal consisted of a 4 course dinner (4 savories and 1 dessert) plus a full bottle of wine for two people.  Since both couples were getting this, or waiter suggested we might like to just have the chef prepare 6 different saviors and 2 different desserts that we all would share.  Despite a bit of hesitation from my girlfriend, we accepted this recommendation without knowing what lay ahead.  We also decided to get two different bottles of red wine (1 pinot and1 meritage) to mix things up there as well.  As it turns out, both leaps of faith proved to be rewarded, as all of the dishes we  had were well thought out and prepared to perfection.  The first two dishes to come out were a mixed green salad and grilled asparagus with a poached egg.  I'm personally not a fan of asparagus, but my companions all loved the dish.  The salad was excellent and well balanced, so much so that my friend's wife actually said that was her favorite dish of the evening,  Next up were the seafood courses, which consisted of sautéed mussels with grilled bread  (delicious) and grilled prawns.  Both were excellent and I was particularly happy that the prawns were not over cooked, which seems to happen all too frequently.  Next up were the meat courses, which consisted of some pork medallions in a very nice puree and a roasted Amish chicken.  Both were outstanding and I was particularly impressed that the chicken was juicy throughout.  Last up for the savories was fresh duck egg pasta with duck confit and a ramp risotto.  Again, both dishes were well prepared and had lots of interesting flavors.  At this point we were all pretty full, but a slice of riccotta cheesecake and some banana bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream came out as soon as the plates were cleared.  Despite our stomachs saying ""No Mas"", we managed to put away both as we finished our second bottle of wine.  All in all, a very nice meal.  I'm not sure I would travel long and far to go here, but it is certainly a ""neighborhood gem"" and worth traveling from Lincoln Park given the value."
"What a great experience!  The food was so good and the staff was so attentive, but not so much they bothered us.  Our drinks were never empty and we never had an empty plate in front of us!  The food is full of things that you can't find everywhere and have lots of unique twists.  Everything we got was amazing!"
"Had a pre-paid dinner from a discount site.  Usually restaurants will treat you like a second-class citizen, but TWO gave me ultra premium customer service and a delicious meal.  I was there on 5/08/14 and the maitre d and bartender were exceptional.  Food was very good."

"I was so excited to try this place because I had heard nothing but good things, but alas, it was just okay.  The overall meal was hit or miss:Duck fat croquettes - Miss.  Needed more salt/flavorDuck egg pasta - BIG hit! Overall the best dish of the night.Scallops - BIG miss.  Laughably overcooked. Sirloin - Hit.  Delicious, the duck fat fried potato/onion hash with the sirloin was amazingBanana bread pudding - HitHate to say it, I won't be coming back, too inconsistent of a meal."
"As fantastic as the food and drinks were, the service was even better. Loved this place and I will be back"
"My friend chose Two for our monthly get-together and I was ready to give it another try.  You see, hubs and I dined here during restaurant week earlier in the year when they were new and working some things out. Fast forward 10 months later and I think they definitely did.Ambiance: the entire place had good energy - it was comfy, very lively and easy to hold a conversation. Food:  Delicious!  Some faves: duck fat potato croquettes, the mussels, homemade sausage and duck egg fettuccine.  Don't miss dessert... the brioche donuts with spiced cider was sweetly satisfying.Service: was great from the moment I walked into the door until the time we left - full and happy.  Everyone was very attentive - from the bar, to the host and service throughout our meal.  A welcome surprise was that the owner sent over some dessert wine as a way to say 'hello', as it was clear we were having a good time and he did not want to disrupt; though he did make sure to greet us before we left. Overall, this is a gem of a place that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great place to gather and have a great dining experience.  I'm looking forward to my next visit very soon!"
"Received a recommendation from a co-worker and this place did not disappoint.From the cocktails/win to dessert, this place was amazing.  Each dish was gastronomy experience.  Whether it was the Pork Ribs, the pasta, Scallops, or the Summer bruschetta and finally the homemade Pretzel donuts, it was delectably delicious. My wife and I thought this was the best meal we had in years.  YEARS!"
"Wow - this place was amazing. The owner (I think?) greeted us at the door and even made my friend who is a preggars a mocktail, which was delish. I'm pretty sure we sampled the entire menu and literally everything we ate was phenomenal. Everything was so well prepared.  Stars of the evening were definitely the white fish and the chicken as well as the risotta. My boyfriend loved the pork ribs. There were 7 of us, which afforded up the opportunity to order a lot of food so I would highly recommend coming in a group so you can sample more than a few items. I will definitely be returning!"
"Amazing food, and great experience overall."
"One of the best restaurants I've been to in a long while (and that's saying something).  There isn't anything revolutionary on the menu, nothing is going to blow your mind, BUT everything is VERY well executed.  We did a 'tour' of the menu and ordered an obscene amount of dishes for two people (including two desserts).  Everything was perfectly seasoned and balanced...very much our flavor palate.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the service, which was outstanding.  Our server was very attentive (they noticed I was left handed) and we felt well taken care of without it being overly intrusive.We went for dinner labor day weekend this year and need to go back to make sure the consistency is there, but definitely go check it out!"
"My husband and I had a late night dinner. We thought the duck croquettes were ok. Really loved the mussels & chicken! Save your appetite for something  other than the duck egg noddles. All in all, nice, unexpected dishes & definitely worth an experience!"
"We went here last weekend and we enjoyed our time here. AtmosphereWe came here on Saturday at 8:00pm. The restaurant was full of people and it was not quiet but not too loud. The inside decoration was nice and seats were comfortable. You can see the lively kitchen from tables.FoodWe had cider, which was very good. Not too tart not too sweet.We ordered1. Duck egg pasta2. Roasted bone marrow3. Warm Berkshire pork cheek4. Grilled OctopusAll of them were delicious. Jam that comes with bone marrow was really good. Duck egg pasta has lots of duck and delicious. Grilled octopus was perfect!! Pork cheek was also delicious, but it was so flavorful that you may not taste the actual pork much...ServiceService was very nice. The young owner welcomed us at the front, and seated us. He sometimes brought our food. One time, he sat next to me and we had a small conversation (i did not expect him to sit). Our waitress was very helpful.Overall I had a great time here and would like to try other dishes!"
Delicious and very helpful staff! Very farm-to-table feel and everything we had tasted fantastic.
"This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in Chicago. My girlfriend and I went for a Saturday night dinner and everything was top notch. It's in a very cool space and the service is tremendous. Very personal and attentive. The host shakes your hand as you walk in and every member of the wait staff will pull out the chair for any woman as she approaches a table.Beyond that, the food was also five stars. The plates were hearty portions for small plates; this isn't one of those ""New American"" spots that give you a little taste of some fancy foofoo dish. We had the duck-egg pasta, which was amazing, and the pork ribs, which fell off the bone. We also had a special of suckling pig, which was great. Finally, the banana bread pudding was one of the best things I've tasted, ever.Highly recommended."
"Farm to table concept with white glove service. We were greeted by the owner when we came in. Very friendly with an appreciative tone that we were there to dine at his restaurant.We had a tasting menu from howaboutwe which included 5 shared plates and 3 drinks each (champagne, wine, dessert wine). The server timed every dish right as we received it one at a time. After each course, another would replace with clean plates and utensils. There were at least a team of 4 working hand in hand to serve us.A couple of dishes I was particularly impressed with: 1) PEI mussels- probably the best I've had in the city. The white wine broth  is so savory because there is a touch of bacon. We got extra bread as well. 2) Risotto- perfectly cooked and my favorite dish 3) Cheesecake with homemade vanilla bean whipped cream- I don't have a sweet tooth but this was amazing. I looked at the menu and it wasn't in there so you may need to ask for it.Overall, a fantastic dining experience!"
"Our fifth visit to Two. We couldn't miss celebrating Two's one year anniversary. We brought another couple to share this gem of a restaurants celebration. From the octopus,  tomato salad, ribs, to the special slow cooked pig there was not a plate we did not enjoy. I believe we left no stone un turned on this visit and still found room for dessert.  The service was over the top always keeping our plates and silverware clean and our drinks full. Even with all the options in the West Loop where we reside this is still our go to spot to enjoy some of the freshest plates you will ever experience. If you have the pleasure of having a conversation with the GM Yamandú or Chef Tom you will appreciate the passion that they put in to their restaurant. We wish continued success.."
"Really nice. Not blow your doors off awesome, but very pleasant.  None of the dishes are terribly inventive, but they're really well executed.  The golden beet salad had exactly the right balance of ingredients.  The chicken breast with gravy sounded like a yawner  on the menu, but it was perfection -- very few restaurants in my experience know how to cook chicken exactly right so that it's fully cooked but juicy, but these guys did.  Same thing with the risotto -- meh in concept, absolutely perfect in execution, creamy with little al dente nuggets as opposed to the library paste-like concoction that many lesser restaurants serve up.  Nice wine, beer, and cocktail list (the cocktails were more inventive than some of the food).  All in all, you can't go wrong.  One bit of advice -- cruise for parking one block south of Grand.  There's no valet parking, and you're not likely to find anything north of the restaurant."
"When was the last time you walked into a restaurant and were greeted with a handshake?  Um, never!  From the minute we walked into this place to the minute we left it was 5 stars the whole way.  Everyone was super friendly....even the table next to us.  The drinks were awesome...the food was awesome.....service was awesome.  The grilled leeks were so tasty we actually grilled some of our own the next night at home.  They weren't nearly as good sadly.  The ribs were phenom.....we said to ourselves we should have ordered 2.  The chorizo stuffed squid was really good too but probably my least favorite of what we ordered.  Also had the scallops and duck fat potatoes.  Serving puppy chow for $6 is a goldmine considering I can make a huge batch for about that.  But who doesn't love puppy chow?!?!  Smart move Two.    My husband and I are already planning out next visit because there was so much more on the menu we wanted to try.  Thank you for the best meal out we've had in a long time."
"Went Sunday during Restaurant week after scouring the menus of all the participating restaurants, and the four of us were not let down.  Great quaint place, beautiful decor (all '2nd life') and a nice small bar with great whiskey and beer selection.  Between the 4 of us, we sampled all the prix fixe menu.  I had:House Smoked Ivory CharPolenta with Mushrooms (bonus course)Duck Egg Fettuccine (w/Duck Confit, Duck Skin Cracklins)Brioche DoughnutsSmall plates...huge flavor.  The smoked char was unbelievable.  Served over a small arugula salad, this was my favorite dish.  The polenta and shrooms was fantastic also.  Duck egg fettuccine with confit and cracklins?  How could that not be awesome?  Uh...it was.  Also had a couple of big fork fulls of the parsnip risotto.  Was slightly disappointed to see the menu was changed from a chestnut risotto I read about pre-visit to the parsnip...but WOW....I actually googled parsnip risotto when I got home.  It was that good.  The desert I had was kinda meh, but the other choice of some kind of chocolate cake thingy with a raspberry sorbet was crazy good.  Everything was prepared to perfection.  Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, suggesting drink specials and wine parings with dinner.  Decor was unique and the kitchen looked like a small matchbox.  How they serve people with such speed, originality and quality out of there makes it even that much more special.  I am a foodie and a culinary student who is very hard to please food wise.  Can't wait to go back for the full menu.  Highly recommend!"
"Chefs menu for 8- YUM! $40 per person and you get a selection from the menu.  We enjoyed everything that came to the table, perfectly timed. It is a trendy place where the house cocktail descriptions are a paragraph long, but these are actually strong and very good. Because its trendy its really cute, but its also really friendly, really tasty. Enjoyed the whole evening. Will definitely be back!"
"From ambiance (interior design, mood, open kitchen design) to the details of the service (pulling out my chair, check-in, staff) all the way to the most important part.. The food!  The most detail is here.. Delicious and unique flavors.. A bit of an adventure as we ordered in wondering what unique spin they would have on some favorite dishes of ours.  Fantastic establishment!"
Great evenin . . .we were running late (party of 4) ... they were most accommodating.. . . ..and we were delighted with the meal . . ..between the four of us we tried almost the entire menu --- no bombs and lots of arguing over which was best.  Great value for the quality as well.
"One word: Excellent. I love their seasonal menu. Great, laid-back atmosphere with 5-star food. I already made reservations for when my out of town visitors come visit."
"I went here back in February during restaurant week. I was a little apprehensive given the initial reviews. But, it's restaurant week right? So why not. I don't know if they read the reviews here or not but, what I experienced was different than what I had been reading. During the prix fixe, I had the risotto and holy guacamole it was delicious. I wish I had more of it. The waiter was helpful and patient. The FH manager/owner made his rounds and was very friendly and even saw us out.The only downside is that the drinks, depending on what you get, are a tad pricey. I had a Templeton Rye neat for $9."
"Four of us popped in here on a Thursday night and were able to sit down immediately.  We were kindly and enthusiastically greeted right when we walked in.  All in all, the staff are really personable and attentive.  The restaurant also has an awesome vibe, the decor definitely works to provide a hip, cozy environment.Since there small/medium plates meant to share, we were able to order a good amount.  We started with the duck fat croquettes---get these!  They're little deep fried mashed potato balls, so there's this awesome outer crunch leading to this whipped potato heaven. And to top it off, they come with aioli sauce.  Definitely can't go wrong with that.  We also got the homemade bacon sausage, which was banging good, so flavorful.  The pork loin, hanger steak, parsnip risotto, and the duck fettuccine were all delicious as well.  The risotto and fettuccine noodles were cooked to perfection, not mushy at all.  Seriously every dish was tasty.For desert, we ordered the donuts and bread pudding.  Of the two, my favorite was the bread pudding hands down.  The donuts were fine, but the chocolate sauce they came with didn't really come together for me.We all really enjoyed our dining experience here and will definitely be back!"
"Good food but definitely not great. Unfortunately our top 3 menu choices were unavailable due to a busy weekend.  The 4 dishes we did order (beef cheeks,  beet salad,  duck pasta,  and pork sausage) were good but lacked creativity and noteworthy flavor. The beet salad was especially mediocre. Service started very friendly -  I got a hand shake and a hug when I arrived -  quickly deteriorated. Eg I asked our waiter for a cab sauv recommendation,  he said he'd bring a few over,  and one was brought by a kitchen hand that knew nothing of the situation or even the wine."
"Love this place. Food is excellent, staff is awesome. And it's not super expensive either. You should definitely give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"
"A great experience a Two: the server was helpful and attentive, the manager even came to welcome us! Basically everything we ate was delicious: the chicken with the duck fat biscuit, the creamy polenta with mushrooms, the croquettes, the risotto, the list goes on! And for the dessert, the best was definitely the angel food cake, so creative!We will be back :)"
"Like other reviewers, I was impressed with the food, but not so much with the service.  Typical hipster service, which the amazing dishes helped us to overlook.  We did have a food poisoning issue from one of the mussels (the red sauce isn't really all that spectacular, certainly not worth getting sick over), which was handled well from a food safety perspective. They did note the batch of mussels that were served to us and put a warning out to other customers of their mussel supplier to be on the lookout for bad mussels.  They also stopped serving mussels the rest of the night, so my apologies to any diners that came after us who were hoping to try them, but we might have saved you from a really unpleasant night!  :)  Their only offer to us was to treat us to free mussels should we come back, at least take the offending items off our bill, because we're certainly not coming back for mussels!  We were at Gilt last night and the wait staff was much nicer there, so with all of the options in town I doubt that we'll be back to give Two and 2nd chance."
"We decided on Two for our anniversary dinner.  We were very pleased with the choice!  It has a great, lively atmosphere.  The food was stellar with beautiful presentation.  You can tell they have a very fine tuned operation going on there.  Our waters were always full, the food runners described each plate, and our server touched base with us frequently to see how we were doing.  We loved the homemade ricotta cavatelli as well as their scallops and salmon.  I believe their menu changes often, but I trust it all to be delicious.  The banana bread pudding was also fabulous!  My husband wanted to try the puppy chow, which was good, but it was just puppy chow.  The server then gave us a complimentary glass of Banfi Brachetto sparkling rose.  Very nice touch!  Highly recommend this place!"
Everything was pretty awesome on Friday.  Great service.  Really nice place.  Woke up this morning craving the risotto.  Ramps and bacon.  Will go back and crush again soon.
"The best whitefish in Chicago, awesome pork belly, perfect scallops.  Bits of yummy bacon made the presentations sparkle. But please, up the veggies!  There was just a teasing spoon of turnip puree on the pork, and the pea shoots and slivers of radish were too good to be so sparse.  The market salad needed less dressing, crisper greens.  It was the only disappointment.  Nice atmosphere; noise was very bearable, unlike in too many restaurants."
This place is so good I don't want to tell anybody about it! Duck confit w pasta is super good. Atmosphere and service the best.
"Fun! Slightly off the beaten path in terms of location and cuisine. It's pretty well lit for a ~trendy place... no holding a tiny flickering candle up to the menu here. You can see all of the recycled decor and your dining mates easily. Hooray! There were a lot of large parties celebrating special occasions, but it still fit the bill for an intimate dinner for two. The staff was noticeably interactive without being overbearing. It's all about a love of food here. Two does small plates--but they are larger. Standouts were the hanger steak and duck egg pasta. While it's true that a lot of the menu selections are the same stuff you'll see all over the West Loop and River North, Two does it all very well."
"Food is outstanding, service is impeccable and the place is truly sustainable to match the menu. We went for Restaurant Week and were very pleased! Pork shoulder and chocolate cake were my favorites - and the mushroom with polenta - holy moly. The staff were all very gracious to answer our questions, and they even helped take our costs and help us get back in them! I just wish I lived closer to this spot. Looking forward to going back."
"If I could give 6 stars I would. Went last night for the restaurant week menu. Four courses for 33 bucks, and every one of them spectacular. The Duck Pasta was the standout, but every dish from the Onion Soup (I typically think Onion Soup is kinda gross) to the Donuts and Sipping Chocolate (gives Xoco's Churros and Chocolate a run for their money) were unbelievably good.The owner was there shaking hands and being just a generally cool dude, and the service was impeccable. Awesome experience for the second time at Two.. If you haven't been, you need to go."
"I can't say enough good things about Two, from the delicious food to the excellent and friendly service.My favorite items on the menu were the duck fat potato croquettes - they simply melt in your mouth - and the hangar steak.The service was impeccable - very attentive, they never let our drinks run out and even brought extra bread for the charcuterie without being prompted.The bar has a very nice selection and I had a lovely chat with the friendly bartender while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.I also enjoyed the clean farmhouse styling of the dining room. I am looking forward to the next time I can visit."
"Customer service was the least of my concerns here! The waitstaff was uber attentive! I also have a personal appreciation for menus most conducive to sharing, as I can be terribly indecisive when choosing an entree. Thankfully, our party of 4 had a mutual palate. As others have shared, the duck egg pasta is a must try and the banana bread pudding was the best I've ever had in my life! We used a 30% Blackboard Eats (BBE) discount which gave us more incentive to indulge ourselves :) I can't wait to go back to try items we didn't have room for...we were stuffed by the time we left."
"I've dined at TWO with my wife and had such a great experience, that this time I decided to bring clients for dinner and it did not disappoint.  The Duck Fat Croquettes are a MUST as well as the broccoli with the cheese sauce. My colleague was talking about the Hangar Steak for a few hours after the meal.  I can't wait to dine here again."
"Recently had dinner at Two on a double date. Great atmosphere, awesome cocktails, excellent food. TWO thumbs up!"
Went there for Restaurant Week and that entire menu is amazing! It's more comfort food style and everything was great! Specifically the duck fettuccini is out of this world! We will definitely be back to try to regular menu!
Two is a place that I hadn't heard a lot about. After walking by here several times and really liking the interior we decided to give it a shot. Wow. So good. I really am having a hard time thinking of a place with better service. There was always someone there with a smile. The drinks were great and they have an excellent beer list.The grilled leeks with burrata - fantastic! This made me want to run out and start grilling leeks all the time. This dish was amazing. The lamb ribs were also great as was the chicken dish for two that we tried. The menu was full of things I would have loved to try. They said to order two-three dishes per person and we found that we were both completely stuffed with just the three above and cheesecake for dessert. Word must be spreading about how great this place is because it filled up fast and we sat down around 5 PM on a Friday. If you love places like Publican and Girl and the Goat then you will feel right at home here. I left with only good things to say and excited to return. They also have a great bar area.
"We decided to walk into this place one rainy night. We were greeted warmly by the host and got a great table. All the dishes were amazing, especially the duck pasta. So rich and creamy. We must have gotten about 5 small plates...seemed like we just kept ordering stuff since it was so delicious! The banana bread pudding with cinnamon ice cream was also delish. Very good find and we will be going back :-)"
"First, let me say that I've eaten at many fine establishments across the country that have a similar concept as Two - farm to table, sustainable fare with in-house charcuterie, pasta, etc. However, Two is among the best at actually executing this concept with friendly, eager-to-please, Midwest kindness. My wife and I ate here on a Friday night for a dinner before going to the theater. I was immediately impressed by the ambience - nothing fussy for sure, but warm, comfortable surroundings and each design feature having a story to tell. Two prides itself on using materials in their restaurant that are on their second life and the rustic nature is pleasing to the eye. The other thing that stood out before we even found our seats was the service. Multiple staff came to greet us upon entering the restaurant and the person that sat us at our table helped us both off with our winter coats. They actually acted like they were happy that we were visiting for the evening. This type of service continued on throughout the night. Beverages: Two rocks an impressive wine list, although, I wasn't in the mood for wine. They also had some really interesting looking cocktails, but I decided to go with the local Revolution Brewing seasonal beer. Outstanding. What also stood out was that our water glass never got close to reaching empty. This kind of service can come across as overbearing, but I never felt interrupted or bothered. Food: The other part of this concept includes small-to-medium plates, which makes it great for ordering a bunch of stuff and then sharing it with others. My wife is a bit more picky than I am, so we had to make compromises, but the menu was not short on enticing options - Pork Belly, Mussels, Pork Cheek, Local Trout, Rissotto, Housemade Andouille Sausage, Bone Marrow, Scallops, etc. Everything looked great! We ended up with a Market Salad, Rissotto with Sunny Side Egg on top, P.E.I Mussels in a fantastic broth (white wine broth, mint, chorizo, etc.) and the housemade andouille sausage with a pepper and onion soffrito. Everything was delicious. My only minor complaint was that the rissotto was just a tad undercooked, but still wonderful. Dessert: We could have ordered one of everything, but we decided on the Housemade Pretzel Donuts and drinking Chocolate. So Good!The bill was $75, which is ridiculous(ly good) given the quality of the meal, the outstanding service and the overall experience. My only regret is that we don't live close to this place, otherwise, we'd be here every month. When I am in the city, I'll be making Two a regular destination. You HAVE to go."
Simply amazing. The service is great. The good is awesome. Yes!!! I recommend
"I really enjoyed the Two experience. We came because I had a Bloomspot coupon, and I wish I bought a few more!We had the following dishes for myself and my husband: duck egg pasta, lamb ribs, halibut, mixed veggies, and hanger steak. If I were to go again, I would get the duck egg pasta and lamb ribs again but pass on the others because the were not a surprising in flavor. The duck egg pasta was wonderfully done, mostly because of the crispy duck skin and how flaky the duck meat was. The lamb ribs were astonishingly filled with spice without overtaking your mouth. The halibut was well done, but extremely overpriced for the size of the filet (if you ordered that one dish for one person, you'd prob need 3-4 of them). The mixed veggies were fresh - zucchini, mushrooms, tomatoes, etc. - and the hanger steak prepared at a nice medium rare, but both were standard and underwhelming. The hanger steak did come on a nice bed of cabbage that was very refreshing. At the end, I felt really satisfied about the meal. Everything was done well, and certain dishes exceptional. However, my husband left feeling not full. So, I think these small shared dishes are great but male patrons will need to order even more. The last thing that would not have me coming back to Two on a regular basis is price. Like I said, everything was of great quality, but the meal was $130 and when you think of the dishes, they had very high margins."
"Wow, I was quite impressed by the unpretentious deliciousness offered at Two. Simplicity at its best!We ordered the P.E.I. mussels which, I will be honest, were just okay. The leeks/burrata/salsa verde dish was a fabulous dish in an unassuming disguise. The pork belly was just magnifique! It did not have that usual layer of fat attached to it; there was barely any fat. It was perfectly and modestly seasoned which allowed us to fully savor it w/o any distraction.Service was perfect, kind and warm. The GM (maybe owner?) came by to chat which is always nice. All-around excellent experience at Two.  :-)"
"Had a great dinner here with a group of 4.  The host sat me even though my full party hadn't arrived... A real treat these days.  He suggested a great Pinot Noir, which I enjoyed as my remaining party arrived.  Sexy, warm atmosphere with a very friendly staff... Each dish was delicious.  Some favorites were the scallops, mussles, and one of the specials of the day.  Dessert was yummy and overall a great experience. I would highly recommend!"
"Holy crap this place has mind-blowingly delicious food.  The Farro salad was light yet very complexThe risotto was cooked well and very flavorfulThe homemade chorizo stuffed squid was very interesting, but overall the worst dish I ate, however it's still a solid B+Pork ribs were good, this wouldve been an A+ dish if the cherry bbq sauce had a little more acidity to it, but the radicchio gave it a touch of bitter to really bring out the flavors.The bourbon cream cheesecake made with buffalo trace cream was magnificent.Ambiance was cool, very modern with smaller tables and close quarters.  Service could not have been better.  Locales of all the food were prominently displayed on menu and wait-staff was very knowledgeable.  Best meal I've had to date in Chicago."
"Have been here three times and each one was as good as the prior (excellent) experience. Absolutely love the small plates concept (at any restaurant), and Two delivers some absolutely delicious combinations. On top of that, we've had fantastic interactions with the owner and sommelier. Highly recommend this spot."
"This was our second time in Two, and it did not disappoint. We will definitely be back when we are back in Chicago."
"Spot on.  Also, while I am typically not a fan of small plates, the servings were large, which makes that format acceptable."
"I had a very good experience here. The service was by far the friendliest I have ever experienced at a restaurant. I got the sense that anything I asked for would have been accommodated -- but not in the ""white table cloth"" fashion more like the ""you're a fellow human and we're super chill"" fashion. Of what I ate, I would order the mussels and scallops again if went back."
"The food is excellent and the menu ever-changing. The environment is laid back, and the owner makes it his priority to meet and chat with his customers. It's a real gem of both Midwest and Chicago cuisine. This gives 'Girl and the Goat' a real run for its money! And the best part is that you don't need a reservation three months in advance."
"Fellow Yelpers, and yummy food seekers, TWO is not the place for you.  Visited this place last night for my birthday.  Everything we ordered was bland.  Mussels, pork shank, flank steak, bone marrow, chicken thighs, our table tried it all and survey of 6 was ...""meh"".  We specifically asked our waiter to order meals as individual plates and spent over an hour waiting for all of our food to arrive.  Dear owner, we were fully aware of the sharing style of the restaurant - it's pretty common amongst the loads of imitation ""farm to table"" themed restaurants in this city.  There is absolutely nothing original about this place (see Publican, Acre, Erwin, the list is rather long).   The owner is as transparently flaky as any of these new young restauraneurs I've met.  He takes a break from his ""we've been open for 2 months"" hand shaking at the door act and finally becomes aware of our expressed dissatisfaction.  The young pup doesn't come over to ask what he can do to make our night a bit more soothing, he instead defends his restaurant style (as if we're those idiot diners that don't research a restaurant before dining despite making a reservation) and then we only see the young guy come by our table again to pick up the check.  If there's anything I'll remember, it won't be the rubbery mussels actually, it will be my lingering shock at the treatment and downright arrogance of the young owner.  Just poor taste."
"This place was great!I really loved their seasonal menu, their drinks were delicious.  Like really really good and well thought out.  My guy ordered a whiskey drink with coffee ice cubes, and as they melted the drink changed flavors.  I mean. Come. On.  That's awesome!The food was great.  We shared the trout which was incredibly delicious, the beet salad which was pretty much the tastiest beet I've had in a long time (I'm a Russian... that's a big deal), the raviolo in browned butter (hello!!!), and octopus which was really super tender and served over beans, and then the butternut squash risotto.Everything was done really well, the service was superb, we were really well attended to, and I just loved the general vibe of the place.  Stone, wood, metal, and edison bulbs.  :) Sigh.Very romantical, very tasty, very very good."
"If you're looking for a more 'upscale' evening out, this place is a cute place to entertain yourself and a handsome date.  The atmosphere was pretty and  a bit rustic, almost as if to be have been designed with 'sustainability' in mind.  Even the menus are made from recycled paper.  Everything was quaint and perfect... my only recommendation would be to consider rearranging the tables in a way that may allow more 'intimate' seating, or perhaps create spaces using barriers, or drapes of some sort to lesson the noise or interactions from the neighboring table.The staff is active as they move from table to table ensuring your water is full and your place settings set up for for your next course.  They recommend two 'meals' per person as they serving sizes are smaller than you would expect at a more 'traditional' restaurant, and they bring you on course at a time, which allows you to enjoy each meal to it's fullest.  We purchased only three total between the two of us and were very satisfied by what we had.I recommend getting the scallops.  Three to a plate, but they are so delicious and juicy.  The chefs pay great attention to detail when they present the course to you.  As for reservations... if you're going on the weekend, get one!"
"My husband and I dined at Two last night and really enjoyed our experience. The staff is very attentive, service was great, and the atmosphere is inviting.The menu is set up to be a sharing experience, following the trend of small plate dining. However, their plates are more medium sized rather than small. Three to four dishes are more than enough for two people. All of the produce used at Two is from a local vertical farm, and you can taste how fresh everything is. The food is prepared well, without any bells and whistles - the chef focuses the natural flavors of the food. We ordered the leeks, which were nicely grilled and seasoned; the halibut, which was well seasoned and simple fare; the scallops, which were cooked perfectly; and the hanger steak, which was cooked well but a little salty for our taste. I had a glass of red wine, which was served at perfect temperature, which I always appreciate.We had the pretzel doughnuts for dessert, which were the only thing we were underwhelmed by. They are supposed to have a chocolate filling, however ours had maybe a dollop in each. We didn't really get a pretzel taste either. I would stay skip these and put your calories elsewhere.In summary, Two is a great place for date nights, friends getting together, or large parties. I would absolutely recommend Two to anyone!"
"This little space is a GEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The space is cozy, grey undertones, nice.  The service was down to earth, attentive, and personable.  I like that about a place.  It makes a big difference when you are looking at a restaurant as a whole.  For me, service is everything...of course, they have to have good food as well.  The waters never went empty, drink glasses always full.The food is where its AT~!  Man, the dishes are the smaller to medium plate style, which is nice for trying out multiple dishes.  The grilled octopus was fantastic.  Sweet/spicy sauce grilled to perfection.  The Croquettes were like a little fried heaven on the plate.  Mussels were done amazingly with the spicy sausage and great broth.  I wish there was MORE!  The homemade sausage was some of the best I have had and I LOVE a good sausage.  Raviolo was good, could have been a titch better, but it didnt stop us from almost licking the plate.  The flank steak was cooked and seasoned to a level that made my mouth water!  The brussel sprouts were fantastic.  It went so well with the sausage!  YUMMY!  The risotto was a little chewy, but still had a rich and buttery cheesy flavor.  Again, it was pretty darn good.  Desserts, we had the whoopy pie and the homemade candy bar.  The whoopy pie was a little too dense for my liking.  It was good, but just OK.  The candy bar had great flavor.  Again, nothing too special, however I would order again!Drinks-they had a fantastic pumpkin spice cocktail?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!  And it was delicious.  We also had beer and wine.  Overall, good selection of cocktails.There is metered street parking or valet...which the valet was a little annoying because the guy took our keys and then parked it right there in front of the restaurant and handed us back our keys...haha, thanks for the $10 parking job.  I could have done that.Overall I liked Two a LOT!  Go and see :)"
"Food was very inventive & delish!  Service was outstanding!!!   Nice atmosphere, great neighborhood Restaurant !"
"I came to Two for Restaurant Week since it has been on my list since it opened. My only disappointment was that I didn't visit sooner! This has to be one of the best first impressions of a neighborhood restaurant that I've had in a while. We were warmly greeted by one of the chefs/partners who was working the front of the house and also kept apologizing for having us wait (we had a reservation but some other tables were taking their time leaving). This might normally bug me but the way it was handled really put me at ease. And let's be honest, I really only waited an extra 10 or 15 minutes as opposed to an hour! I loved the food and appreciated all the choices that they had to offer, even on the regular menu. The duck fat croquettes were, in my opinion, perfectly made with the right amount of crunch on the outside and a warm, soft center. The aioli really made the dish too and I kept wanting to find other things to dip in it! The Arctic Char was also delicious and I loved the preparation. But perhaps most surprising was the banana bread pudding dessert with salted bourbon caramel and homemade ice cream. I tend not to big a big dessert person (or love banana flavored things for that matter) but I could have just about licked the plate. I only wish that I could have tried the PB&J profiteroles when they were on the menu when the restaurant opened!  The rest of the staff and service was great and they all seemed genuinely friendly and not over-the-top or intrusive (which has happened to me in a lot of places and can sometimes be bothersome). I'm so glad to have finally gone to Two and look forward to returning to me new neighborhood spot soon!"
"Oh My God. This place was amazing and I cannot wait to go back!I had been wanting to try it, so i thought i would give it a go during restaurant week. Their menu sounded delicious and i was sold by a bonus course :) no, but really, restaurant week is tough because some places don't take things off their regular menu, and are generally not up to par with how they would operate on a normal night, so while its great to get a taste somewhere you have never been, its not always the best judgement of somewhere.Two was completely different and exceeded all my expectations. The entire restaurant week menu was based off of their regular menu and the portions had to be normal size because we could barely finish what was brought to the table! The service was phenomenal with attentive and knowledgeable staff. We didn't feel rushed and the food hit the table with just enough time between courses and always hot!  Seriously, everything was great.I went with a friend and we ordered opposite menus, so we could have a taste of everything... On a normal night, this place seems like it would be great to share lots of dishes, which is my favorite way to dine!Some of my favorites that  I enjoyed were the arctic char, duck egg pasta, and risotto dishes. so yummy!I live up the street and have seen this location be more than a few restaurants, without much success. Let's just say, I hope this one is here to stay!"
"I thought this place was really good!  Lots of good small plates here and I was not disappointed in one  They also have a pretty good beer selection, though maybe a bit overpriced.  All in all, very good and I plan to return as it is right down the street from me as well.Oh, get the duck fat croquettes... they are awesome!"
I wish restaurants that charge what they do would turn around and invest a few bucks in some sound panels.  Pretty good food.
"I was pretty ambitious for restaurant week. I went to 4 different places and  despite the horrible name was easily the best one. I had read online that they seat you in two large communal tables, but luckily for us that wasn't the case. We had a small little table to ourselves and Graham D. got to peak right into the kitchen. The waiter suggested we just try everything on the restaurant week menu. There were two options per course and they threw in a bonus course. So 4 for the price of 3. Everything was amazing. Some of the highlights were the duck egg pasta, Artic Char, and pretzel donuts (WIN). I walked out with a warm happy food buzz, that cut through the blistery Chicago winter. I hear they are starting brunch soon. I'm pretty pumped."
"This is more of a 3.5 than a 4...We came here for my husband's birthday with a bunch of friends. Since we had a party of 6, we decided to order almost everything on the menu. FOOD:We had the charcuterie, arctic char, pork belly, bone marrow, pork cheek, duck egg pasta, another type of pasta with a pork ragu, amish chicken, scallops, mussels with bacon, duck fat and potato croquettes, and I'm probably forgetting something...Anyways, our server was very friendly. We are glad we ordered a lot of dishes, because they came out at a good pace, so we were able to try everything without getting too full. The best dishes were probably the charcuterrie, amish chicken, pork belly, scallops, and the two pasta dishes. All of the serving sizes were kind of small, but we appreciate that they try to use mostly local ingredients so it was fine. One thing we did not care for, was that all the bread that came with the dishes was thin and toasted. A bread that is not toasted would be much better at soaking in all the juices from the mussels or the bone marrow for example. Also, we were only given a few pieces of bread with each dish, so sometimes there wasn't enough bread for everyone to have a slice. However, when we asked our server for more bread, he obliged. We also found the size of bone marrow dish to be a bit on the skimpy side, so we got 3 orders so everyone at our table could get some.DRINKS:We had the white umbrella, rosemary's baby, some type of blueberry bourbon drink, the brooklyn and a few others. Everyone at our table loved their drinks, especially the white umbrella and the rosemary's baby.We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and did not feel rushed at all. Some of the dishes were fabulous and others were just average, so as long as you know what to order you should be good. Aso make sure to order a lot of food since the portions are small. I also brought a homemade cake for my husband they were kind enough to bring it out with candles and dim the lights so it was a very sweet touch."
"I fly all over the U.S. and my biggest perk is doing customer dinners every week at the best restaurants in each city.  I was SO impressed by every bite of food, that I'm compelled to write my first review ever on yelp.  For appetizers we did the charcuterie plate....not your average plate....pork mousse, homemade beef jerky, great salumi....all fantastic!  We also did the potato croquettes..... flavorful and melted like cotton candy in your mouth.  For entrees, we split the chicken, pork belly, ramp risotto, and hangar steak.  The chicken tasted like it was brined forever and had a great sauce.  Great sauce w/the hangar as well. The pork belly( and I'm a freak for pork belly) was some of the best I've had in the last 5 years.  The risotto was incredible...make sure you do the egg on top! This place truly is a 10 out of 10. The chef came out after the meal to check in to ensure everything was outstanding......I thought it showed they really cared and are trying to be the best in Chicago.Oh yeah, great bar as well.  Nice draft selection.  Great bartender and waiter too.  You truly can't beat the overall experience at TWO.Standout restaurants for me over the last few years...... Bazaar in Beverly Hills, John Howie Steak in Bellevue, Cholon in Denver, and now... TWO in Chicago!"
"This place is BANANAS and I mean the good kind :)I came here with my dinner club on ""Tito's Tuesdays"" where you can have a dirty martini made with Tito's for $5.50......what a deal! We pretty much ordered the entire menu, and while everything was good there are a few MUST haves.The Risotto was by far and away my fav dish of the night.  Breaking the yolk of the duck egg and mixing it in with the perfectly seasoned risotto was magnificent!Duck Egg Pasta- light and delicious, make sure you get everything in one bite......the duck, with the pasta, scallions, and cracklin is a real treat for your palate.Brussel Sprouts- with apples, bacon, and lemon juice. Cooked perfectly, and the lemon juice on the sprouts brought in just the right amount of acid that didnt overwhelm the plate.Beef Cheek- mixed with ricotta and apples, was a beautiful smear for the crostini they provided with the dish. A rich, deep flavor with the crunch and brightness of the apple.The mussels were delicious as well but I found the bacon in the dish to be too smoky and that overpowered the taste of the mussels.Overall, you really cannot go wrong with anything here. I suggest if you are undecided as what to order, as your server and trust them.......they won't steer you wrong, that's how we ended up with the risotto and finishing off the meal with the banana split. The service is top notch, I really liked that our plates and silverware were switched after every dish so flavors were not able to combine.I venture to guess I will be back here soon, and many more times after that....the risotto haunts me in a pleasant way."
"The food is excellent, the atmosphere is just what I look for. The food was delicious. Menu has lots of choices for vegetarians. This restaurant is an excellent date spot. Very romantic and also has a unique decor.Great variety of cocktails."
"We went here last night and had a great meal & a fabulous time with our friends.  The restaurant is farm to table with everything decorating the inside on it's second life - hence the name two.  There were 3 couples in our party so we ordered a lot of plates and they were all really good.  The restaurant recommends 2 plates per person - they bill them as ""medium sized plates.""  Things we had listed in somewhat of an order of my enjoyment are as follows:Duck Fat Potato Croquettes - so good!  First thing we had and a sign of things to come.  Such good flavor! 5 in an order, so we had to share - bummer!Risotto - really good butternut squash flavor.  The rice was crunchy inside - would've liked it done more.Scallops - wish I had gotten more of this dish but alas, we were sharing!Duck Egg Pasta - the cracklins were yummy and there was a lot of duck in the dish.Beet Salad - loved the shaved Parmesan with it.Pork BellyPork ShankGritsPork CheekGrilled Octopus - not my favorite food but was well prepared.  My BF really liked it.Sausage - was smokey and everyone else really enjoyed - it's just not my favorite foodBrussels Sprouts - not my favorite as they were seasoned with citrus but the brussels sprouts lovers at the table loved themWe were STUFFED after all the food so we couldn't try the desserts.  We will definitely be back!"
This place is really overrated on here considering the price. We had 6 dishes and pretty much every one was bland overall. Definitely will not be returning here.
"(+0.5) I really like the atmosphere and the service was incredibly personal. Everything we ordered was top notch. We had pork shoulder, duck egg pasta, duck fat potato croquettes, and chicken. The chicken is probably the star. The price point is surprisingly reasonable. New favorite no fuss restaurant in chicago."
"First impressions were great.  The space is very nice, rustic with old oscillating fans as lamps above the bar.  The bartender was really nice, explained their gin and scotch focus.  We tried several of the cocktails through the night and loved them (especially the seasonal pumpkin bourbon drink and the gin and mint drink).  Sidenote: don't order off the menu: the Manhattan was really standard, nothing special at all, it even had the fake maraschinos!  Get the Brooklyn with real brandy soaked cherries.The dining room was almost empty at 6pm but filled up throughout the night.  The menu is pretty extensive for sharing plates, so that was nice.  We fared much better as carnivores than my vegetarian friends.  They were more than willing to make existing dishes veggie-friendly by removing things like bacon, chorizo and pork broth.  Here it is, in order of yumminess:The Great-fingerling potatoes - random favorite dish, but these were phenomenal.  Perfectly salted with a unique salsa verde on them.-friend chicken thighs - I was not excited about these, I'm not a fan of thighs and had just had friend chicken recently.  My friend insisted, however, and I'm glad he did.  These were really great!  Not your typical batter, I'm not sure how to describe it other than to say it was really tasty.-Candy bar dessert - sinfully chocolatey and rich, you must get this!The Good-mussels - these were good and they were happy to bring us extra bread to sop up the tasty broth.  The best part was the chorizo which we had on the side.  One friend said this was the best chorizo he's ever had!-pumpkin whoopy pie - not typically a fan of pumpkin, this was really tasty, especially the cinnamon ice creamThe Ok-roasted beet salad - this would have been higher because it was very good, but there were globs of sea salt randomly sprinkled so I kept getting a big bite of salt and making a sour face.  -thyme cavatelli - this was SO CLOSE to be really good, it was just missing some kind of seasoning.  It appeared there was so thyme sprinkled, but you couldn't taste it.  We had to steal some salt from the bus station (pet peeve: put salt on the tables!  Don't make me feel bad for pointing out your food is underseasoned!).  The pasta was very fresh and tasty, though.-duck fat potato croquettes - these sounded so good, but were ultimately just big tater tots stacked up like Jenga.  Nice and soft on the inside, but not overly flavorful-Berkshire pork shank - the bourbon braise was really nice, but I was not wowed by the meat.  It was served kind of lukewarm and wasn't as tender as I've had-banana bread pudding - good flavors, but the mushiness of bread pudding is not my thing-cream puffs - I was excited for these, and the pb mousse was great, but the pastry was more cakey than anything and kind of ruined itService was an issue.  Plates were forgotten, orders were not written down (ie: our server asked if we had made decisions about dessert and we reminded her we had already ordered it 10 minutes ago) and we had multiple servers throughout the night so that was chaotic.  Also, we made it clear we had two meateaters and two vegetarians that would be sharing dishes.  Instead of staggering the dishes, they brought out all the veggie stuff first (they were nice enough to let us have a few bites), then all the meat dishes after the vegetarians had finished eating, so they just sat there and stared at us dig in.  Awkward timing."
"Had our holiday company dinner at Two last night and everything was amazing. Great cocktails and wine selections and the food was awesome. Duck pasta and pork belly were personal favorites. The staff was spot on and very professional but still had an approachable, likability factor that can be lost in some places. We will be back."
"If you're going on a Fri or Sat night, make sure to make reservations.  This place gets packed!  My party of 4 showed up w/o reservations on Sat night around 6:30 and the only seats that were available were at the bar.  Lesson learned.  After getting settled, we ordered bone marrow, hanger steak, duck egg pasta, risotto, garlic mashed potatoes, mushroom medley that was a special for the night, and a couple desserts.  All in all, the dishes tasted fantastic!  The duck egg pasta and the mushrooms seemed to be everyones favorite.  The mushrooms were simply salted and roasted but executed perfectly.(the chanterelles were especially good) I especially loved the crispy duck skin cracklins in the pasta.  There were only a couple things we thought were a little off.  The egg with the risotto was cooked a little too long so the yolk wasn't runny all the way through.  Maybe that was intentional but I don't think so.  The other minor issue was that the mashed potatoes came out last, after everything else had been finished by me and my cousins. I would have preferred the kitchen send it out with the steak at least because it felt odd eating just mashed potatoes without anything else.Everyone was nice and I noticed that there were a lot of patrons who knew he bartenders by name which gave me the sense that this is a place that the neighborhood has embraced.  With the excellent food and friendly service, I can understand why."
"Been there 5 times and enjoyed every meal I had there. They change their menu seasonally so i got to try new dish each time. Duck fat potato croquettes- Really smooth. Roasted wild mushrooms- One of my favorites! Grilled octopus with fingerling potatoes- So good! Duck egg fettuccine- Like the duck skin. Mussels - Ordered 3 times. The first time was awesome, but the 2nd and 3rd time were both way too salty. Some duck egg risotto they had before and not anymore- Too saltyOverall, their food is decent. Service- Really friendly service and that's what makes a restaurant stand out. (Also the reason why I think they deserve a 5 stars instead of 4) Owner is really nice too, always there to make sure every customer is happy. I also came here occasionally for a cocktail or a glass of wine with my roommate at the bar area. Bartenders were all super nice and we always enjoyed it."
"Wonderful food.  Professional, friendly service.  Great atmosphere."
"Fantastic cocktails, wine list and well-executed dishes were a wonderful surprise at this West Town restaurant that's managed to stay under the foodie radar. The decor and menu reminded me of the best San Francisco neighborhood restaurants -- something I wish we had more of in Chicago.Dishes are easily shareable between two people. Bone marrow with bacon jam and duck fat croquettes were great starters, and a pulled suckling pig over carrot mash with bourbon glaze special was a highlight among the larger dishes. Scallops were cooked perfectly and complemented by a leek/ramp confit.Banana bread pudding was a great finish -- moist and paired perfectly with salted caramel ice cream. The manager even sent over two glasses of complimentary moscato!"
"Farm to table, farm to table.  This idea is so tired but no restaurant seems to have gotten the memo.Two is a huge space with small plates.  Small plates!  Seriously, the concepts of this place are so played.My friend and I shared the beet salad which was a decent size for an appetizer.  If you try and order this as a main, you're gonna need at least 2 other dishes to feel full.  I also ordered the duck egg pasta which I really enjoyed!  The waitress recommended this dish because of the duck cracklins which were tasty.  I did enjoy this dish and I would say yes to it again.On a sidenote, my dining partner ordered the mussels and she got really bored of eating them and had to order another dish.  I don't know what this says about the rest of the menu.I'm not so sure if I'd return because I thought the prices were a bit inflated for the portions.  Service is good though, host was really sweet.  So maybe again but won't be at the top of my mind."
"I could sit here and type all about how incredibly amazing and flavorful the food was, or how incredible the servers attention was from the moment we walked in the door, or the half priced craft beers on tap on Thursday night, but that would take time away from hailing a cab and getting over there. Seriously, the risotto will blow your mind. AMAZING! Everything else we had was pretty close behind. Come hungry, you will not want to stop tasting dishes and savoring the flavor. F'in incredible. I can't wait to go back!Thanks Two. You ROCKED my pallet. Oh and the board where you can buy someone a drink who isn't even there, but they can stop in and redeem it anytime by showing ID that matches the chalkboard, very unique concept!"
"Impeccable service, amazing food, fun atmosphere, great wine. A must go for any Chicago foodies.We ordered the duck fat croquettes, pork belly, sausage, the cavatappi with pesto, and the banana split. Everything was out of this world good but my favorite of the night was the cavatappi. The pesto had great flavor and the cavatappi pasta (which I believe is homemade in house) had the most delicious and appealing texture of any pasta I have ever had.One thing to note-the portions are pretty small so you may even want to order more than the recommended 2 dishes a person if you are super hungry.I will definitely be going back to Two!"
Had a great date night here a few weeks ago:The maitre d was extremely friendly and made us feel right at home.  We had an amazing table in the corner of the dining room and it was the perfect setting for a quiet dinner on a saturday night.The food was really good and there are many more dishes we want to come back and try!  Two is solid -- great for a group or a date!
I had a groupon for this place. I food wasn't that great - I can only recall a super garlicky risotto. Service was really good. The people next to my table seemed to really enjoy their food so maybe the prefix dishes were the problem.
"I do not understand all the fuss. We ordered:The duck fat croquettes: the only thing we really enjoyed were these little babies. They are basically fried mashed potatoes.Duck Egg Pasta: tasted more like hamburger helper. I actually would have enjoyed hamburger helper more as it is less oily and salty. Brussel sprouts: very acidic taste. We ordered them without the chorizo and they were whatever. The ice cream sundae: over ripe banana, two scoops of good ice cream, not worth the price and I can make a better sundae at home.For cocktails the pumpkin spice burbon was great.Overall, for the portion size, flavor, and price go somewhere else. I should also note that we got the duck egg pasta without pork. We cannot eat pork and informed our waitress of our dietary restrictions before ordering. The restaurant was not busy at all when we ordered and it was disappointing to have to send our main course back because it was covered in pork."
"$12 raviolo = yes, that is going to be the most expensive single piece of pasta you have ever had. Tiny portions; earnest but terrible service. This would all be fine if the food were amazing--but it is truly mediocre. The croquettes amounted to nice cafeteria food; the octopus tasted like octopus I have whipped up in minutes at home. Had five or six dishes but I can barely recall them. It took 10-15 minutes just to get our beers, and our waitress disappeared a quarter the way through, wordlessly replaced by someone who randomly slapped things on the table. I can't help but feel the five star ratings for this place are completely rigged. I signed up for a yelp account just to write this first-ever review. That's how annoyed I am by the outrageous reviews."
"I'm sorry but this is a no-go for me.  It started out strong but finished weak.Since I was there first I hung out at the bar.  The bartenders were great!  Really nice and friendly.  Then the others from my group arrived we moved it to the dining room.  It started strong with our drink orders but then it got strange.  There were 4 in my party, 2 meat eaters and 2 non-meat eaters.  So we asked for mussels to share with the meat on the side.  Then the meat eaters ordered a few meat dishes and my friend and I got the beets, egg ravioli, scallops with the pork broth on the side and the bacon on the side.The beets came out right away so we shared some bites with everyone.  It was not evenly seasoned so one bite was super salty, another bite was heavy with black pepper and some bites had no seasoning.  The others at the table said the same thing.  Then our ravioli came out.  So the meat eaters got to watch us eat more food.  It was an ok ravioli but kind of expensive for what you get.  The Bristol does something like this but its worth every penny because its rich with cheese and egg.  This one kind of had too much bite and not enough cheese.  Then our mussels arrived!  They were pretty good.  The meat eaters said the sausage on the side was amazing.  But they give you like 4 crisps on the side so we needed another round to soak up the delicious sauce.  We could have had one more round of bread but then we felt kind of silly about it.  I was using the bread to soak up the egg on my ravioli.  I think everyone who works there tried to take that bowl away.  No exaggeration I said 3 times to please leave that.  Not once did anyone ask if we were finished with it.So then it was the veg's turn to watch the meat eaters eat.  They got the pork shank which looks like something from the Flintstones.  They said it was just ok.  Then they had the chicken thighs and that was a major hit.  They also got the duck pasta but I didn't hear how they liked that.  I think the dish was clean.  At this point we're thinking that the scallops were forgotten.  We asked for a status a few times.  Then a friend of mine popped in to say hi.  She got a drink and we got the potatoes which were very good.  She got some duck croquettes for herself.Still no scallops.Then then arrived and they were magnificent.  No pork broth on the side or bacon so anyone who wanted to see what that's like was out of luck.  I loved my scallop.  It was cooked perfectly and didn't need that other stuff.I should note that at this point in the dinner the drinks are empty and we've been wanting to order more potatoes.  No one stopped at our table.Then we reminded them (for the 2nd time) that we wanted to try all 4 desserts.They finally arrived.The ice cream was the favorite of the crew.  My friend had never had puppy chow so she was in love.  We all liked that candy bar dish.  The puffs were ok.  The bread pudding was a def hit and the whoopie pies were just ok.  I think the ice cream over shadowed it.The drinks from the menu were very good.  If you stray from that its at your own risk.  We got a Manhattan that looked like something you'd get at a bar in a Holiday Inn.  On our way out one of the owner type guys was standing there and shook our hands.  It was weird.  We noticed him working the room and talking to everyone but our table.  What a miss!  It was a table full of foodies."
"Had dinner last night at Two for a birthday dinner which was fantastic. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the owner (who looks like tiesto) and took us to our table.Decor was very warm, exposed brick, exposed vents. The portion size falls in between appetizer and main so order 4-5 for TWO(pun intended)So what we ordered;1. Duck fat potato croquettes: since everyone was raving about it, decided to see what the hoopla was about. Was not disappointed. Garlic aioli was perfect2. Salmon: Best dish of the night. Was cooked perfectly on a bed of arugula3. Half chicken with mashed potatoes: chicken was tender and not over cooked. 4. Grilled octopus: awesome!!!!5. Duck fettuccine: my only irk with this dish was it was slightly over salted, that being said, we were pretty full at this time.6. Chocolate bourbon pudding: in house raspberry sorbet, pudding and whip cream was a great way to finish the night."
"I went to TWO for Restaurant Week.  My boyfriend and I were a little split on it - I liked it more than he did.  I'd say the food was more 3-star worthy, but for the overall experience - I'm giving it four stars.  1. Ambiance/Decor - I think this place is super cute!  They took the ""farm-to-table"" concept once step further by giving it a farmhouse feel.  2.  Drinks - I had one cocktail and it was very good - their cocktail list is creative without being intimidating.  They have a good craft beer selection and I thought drinks were reasonably priced.  3.  Food - Onion soup was rrrreally good.  The duck-fat croquettes were alright, nothing to write home about.  The risotto was a favorite for both of us!  The duck egg pasta and wild boar were both pretty big let downs.  The arctic char was super good!  I'd never had arctic char before, but it was one of the most succulent pieces of fish I've ever had!  I wish that the sauce had been on the side - it was a bit salty for me.  I think they could find a better accompaniment for it than the fingerling potatoes.  Desserts (banana bread pudding and pretzel doughnuts were alright - nothing special.  They had a lot of really interested menu items that we did not try.  If you're looking for something a bit ""out of the box,""  this might be a good place to try! 4.  Service - The wait staff was very attentive and courteous.  There was also a man (I'm guessing the owner?) that shook your hand when you walked in and went by every table to check on them during their meal.  I thought that this was a very nice touch and is one of my reasons for the four stars.  Overall, I'd for sure go back... but I don't know if I could get my boyfriend to!  Different strokes for different folks?"
"I roll my eyes whenever a meal starts with a waitperson explaining their restaurant's ""concept"".  Especially when it involves a table sharing small plates.  It is code for you will get a serving size slightly larger than an appetizer for the full price of an entree and no matter how many you order, you will go home hungry.  Such was our experience with Two.  Yes a dumb name and tired concept. Still, the food was so damn good that I have to give it five stars.Food:The most simple pile of parsley greens next to the coho salmon were so wonderfully dressed I wanted to eat every single little leaf.  The homemade jerky on the charcuterie plate was to die for and the piles of thinly shaved meat next to it literally melt in your mouth.  Most incredibly fresh yellow tomatoes with a nearly obscene load of fresh cheese on top (only generous portion of the meal).  Cavatelli was rich and delicious.  Friends liked the octopus.  The chicken was less memorable.  The market veggies, I am still craving a second portion.Booze: Unimpressive beer list. Drinks were nothing to rave about.Service:So willing to work around a dairy allergy.  Thank you.  The place was only half full and there were odd moments where we had two people seating us, two people starting us off with water, two waitstaff.  The staff gives off back up chorus members in a dress rehearsal, nervous, charming.  They probably need some fine tuning before the grand opening.  Atmosphere:Hurray Larry Vodak from Scout.  Everything you touch turns to gold.  So unpretentiously beautiful.  One tip though, while the napkins are super charming, they left white lint all over my dress.  Not only could I not get it off for the rest of the evening, but I will be needing to do a special cleaning job."
"Dumb name, tired concept, but This. Place. Is. Awesome.Yet another, oldey tymey farm to table/farmhouse-esque restaurant in the west loop/west town/river west neighborhood, once I got over my eye rolling (but admittedly I'm a cynical bastard) of the look and concept borrowed from the heavily traveled trail blazed by Gilt Bar, Maude's, Publican, Longman & Eagle, etc. I was pleasantly surprised with the fact that Two may be the best of the bunch (ok, maybe not better than Longman & Eagle, but still fantastic.)My dining companion and I were quite hungry and sampled several dishes all of which were home runs.  Heirloom tomato salad was perfectly fresh and light, Salmon with radishes that I used to roll bits of salmon up into a little taco (I have no idea if this was how it was supposed to be consumed, but I did it anyway, and it seemed to work), the steak which you could just pick up with your fingers and melted in your mouth, and the excellent chicken thigh with farmhouse vegetables were all absolutely delicious.  But my favorite was the seemingly innocuous side order of creamed corn, which was extraordinary.  Fresh, and just lightly tossed in some cream and butter, not mushy and heavy, crunchy and delicious.  The portions are small, so definitely order more than you think and they are for sharing.  What I really liked about the food was that instead of taking the whole farm-to-table concept and making these really robust hearty dishes like the aforementioned Gilt Bar/Maude's/Publican/L&E, Two goes the other direction and all their dishes were really light and flavorful without being heavy.  Now maybe this is a seasonal thing, it being summer and having been a million degrees for the past 2 months, and the dishes will get heartier in the fall/winter, but in any case I really liked it.  I love good food, but I don't want to be rolled home afterwards. I live in the neighborhood and  my hope is that Two continues to improve what it already seems to do extremely well.  It's only been open a couple of weeks, and there were a couple of bumps in the service (our chicken thigh came out late and well after the steak, so the order got  screwed up a bit there), but our server could not have been nicer or more knowledgable and offered great suggestions.  The beer list had some great stuff that I hadn't heard of before.  Again, true to concept, my beer came out in a handled mason jar, but I still liked it.The location (May and Grand) is seemingly cursed, in the same spot as the charming, but uneven May Street Market, and then the ambitious, but unholy disaster that was Black Sheep.  I really hope that Two finds the right balance of fine dining and laid backness (laid backedness?), that should fit the neighborhood nicely, and hopefully allow them to stick around for awhile."
"If you are waiting to try this place, don't. Two was the perfect place to celebrate my 29th birthday. To be honest, many people thought it was a great place to celebrate, we were surrounded by birthday girls.We were greeted with a hand shake and were quickly given a table. The menu was easy to understand and made our mouths water. They recommend about 2 plates/person, we got five (one extra) to split. We didn't try the dessert, but opted for a second bottle of wine. The drinks were fabulous. Bourbon Blueberry smash...to due for!The plates were brought to our table separately, giving us time to enjoy each experience. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu...and I know they will be waiting. Get reservations for the best experience."
"Two is a great find, highest quality fresh food locally sourced as much as possible.  Small plates - chef choice or see the menu.  This place is a gem and 5 star.  Almost hate to spread the word because the whole family loves coming here.  Chef and his kitchen are a great team who obviously know their craft and love their careers.  Recommend everything!  Nicely paced meal, very very good service, not pretentious; a foodie's paradise at a most reasonable price.  Go Chef we love Two!"
"Came here for my 30th birthday on Saturday with a group of 7.  I had an amazing time and the food and service were great!  Started off with the Brooklyn cocktail...so delicious!  I'm a Manhattan fan myself, and this was a tasty twist on the classic.  Other cocktails we had were delish as well (had to take a little taste of everything!).  For food, we ordered a bunch; charcuterie plate, market salad, bone marrow, grilled octopus, duck fat potato croquettes, fried chicken thigh, pork belly, duck egg pasta, risotto, thyme cavatelli and rushing waters trout.  Everything was incredible, but my top three are as follows: #1 The brussel sprouts  I mean, dear lord these things were amazing.  The perfect mix of flavors with a splash of lemon juice that sent them over the edge for me.  I couldn't get enough.  #2 The cavatelli.  It was the perfect bowl of comfort.  The only thing that would have made it better would have been if I was eating it while curled up on my couch, with a big glass of red wine and a fire lit in the fireplace.  #3 The grilled octopus.  It was so tender, with the ends of the tenticles perfectly crispy...seasoned to perfection.  Just amazing....honorary mention goes to the fried chicken thighs.  I am a HUGE fan of citrus and the brine on them was so tasty.Side note to the charcuterie plate....the homemade jerky that they have on it is amazing.  There is only one other place that I know of that makes it the same way, and I travel all the way to up north Michigan to get it.  Simply superb. Ended the night with them bringing the banana split over with a candle.  The brulee on the banana was excellent and they brought over a menu signed for me too! Oh, and the decor is great!  Like, I basically wanted to take all the fixtures home with me.  Thanks for a fun and delicious birthday Two!"
"A gem. Beautifully executed interior design and dishes that piqued my curiosity rather than being the same old fusion on a small plate that tries to be clever but is really just a knock off. The bench of culinary talent is getting deeper in smarter ways while audiences are open to more interesting food experiences which is letting places like Two open in neighborhoods rather than having to shell out to be on restaurant row. Chef's are starting to understand the real nature of fresh ingredients rather than trying to apply palates dumbed down by ""food"" from Jewel and other big grocery chains to their work. At Two, the chef's are dealing with fresh food from the people who grow it and have the freedom to change the menu each day. It is how food is supposed to be made.I liked Two but am falling in love with it as I write this.Affordable, delicious, fresh and designerly, what's not to like?"
"Wow, Two is awesome!!  We took our out of town relatives here, and it did not disappoint!  There were 6 of us, so we got to order a lot of different things to share (they call them ""medium plates""), and all were excellent....heirloom tomato salad, lamb shank, hangar steak, butternut squash risotto, Brussels sprouts, grilled trout.  It was all great!  And then of course we had to try one of each of the 4 desserts!Wine was very reasonably priced and very tasty as well.  And the service could not have been better!  One of the best dining experiences I've had in Chicago in some time.  I've already recommended it to all of my foodie friends!"
"Went here with a large group over the past weekend. The owner of the restaurant was very nice and very helpful with our group!We ordered everything on the menu, but some things that stood out to me..Bone Marrow was delicious! It reminded me of Purple Pigs.The Mussels were also very good!The homemade beef jerky was awesome, and I finally got to taste non-gas station beef jerky!Their desserts were also amazing! We ordered all 3 on the menu, and they were all sooooo good! So make sure you save room for desserts! They had some banana bread pudding dessert that they are serving during Restaurant week that you HAVE to get!"
"I walked in with low expectations. At the end of the meal I was caught scooping up the juices of the chicken thigh dish with my finger. I was on a food high. And the whiskey spiced cocktail made me do a little dance inside every sip. The simplicity of the dishes was refreshing. The commitment to Midwestern farm-to-table food got me REALLY excited, however I'm a tad skeptical with the abundance of seafood on the menu. The mussels could have come from Iowa which isn't too far away I suppose, but the octopus? I'd really like to see more dishes that are for the vegetarians, but with the rotating menu I'm sure that is on the horizon. (The chard and brussel sprouts both had meat in them!)Looking forward to my next visit."
"Visited Two with my boo for a Friday night date night. We were looking for something a little different, and noticed this place had just sprung up in the neighborhood and decided to give it a try, I'm glad we did.With it's trendy yet homey ambiance, Two reminds me of Girl and the Goat,  but without the 3 month wait for a table. The emphasis is on small plates, American style food meant to be shared. And the cocktail list is pretty decent with a good breadth of craft beers as well.My boo and I sampled a variety of different dishes and there wasn't a stinker in the bunch. By far the winner was the mussels. They had some sort of chorizo sauce. I don't know how to describe it, but it was so good we got a second order for desert. I thought the fried chicken thighs were perfectly prepared, expertly seasoned and juicy. The pork belly melts in your mouth. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I enjoyed the duck pasta, although my boo found it too salty. We also tried a salad which was not particularly memorable, but then again, when is salad ever memorable? Service was great. Our dishes came out quick. Our server seemed very knowledgeable about the dishes and was super friendly. The host was also very friendly and we felt quite welcome and at home from the moment we stepped in the door to the moment we left. Note for the drivers: there is a valet for $7 but when we went street parking was readily available and free after 9pm on Grand (which means more money for food!).I definitely recommend hitting up Two. The food is great, the atmosphere unpretentious, the staff friendly and accommodating. Definitely get the mussels, but judging from what I sampled I don't think you could go wrong with much on that menu. Two is a great spot for a date or just to grab a bite with a group of friends. I will definitely be coming back."
Wonderful food and perhaps even more wonderful dining experience. We brought a group of 16 for my friend's birthday and they brought us all we could eat for $40 a person. The food was spectacular. The cheesecake and risotto were my favorites. Absolutely delicious!
"Just finished eating and wanted to make sure I didn't forget anything.  Any ladies or humans who like their drinks slightly sweet, have the September issue.  They compare it to a Cosmo but it is significantly better.  The octopus starter with quarter size pieces of crispy bacon was beyond belief.  I have never enjoyed octopus and this has flipped me.  The duck confit noodles and the roasted chicken, will not disappoint.  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Everything we had for dessert I would eat off of a floor it was so scrumptious.  Brilliant space and beautiful time for a lovely lady's celebration of her birth.  Thank you TWO."
"Arrived in Chicago and an hour later we were dining at Two. Local friends who lived in the area thought it was worth trying and boy were we not disappointed. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and was pretty packed and we arrived about 10/10:30pm but it was Friday night. The staff were were friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and definitely not your stuck up ""I am so much better than this"" LA waiters. This is your shareable small plate from farm to table establishment.We ordered loads of dishes but the stand out for me was the Pork Belly with whipped cauliflower. It was divine. I could have eaten one all to myself. The pork dissolved and melted in your mouth and was velvety soft. The cauliflower was better than mashed potatoes!I also loved the butternut risotto (but thought it was just a tad too al dente) and the brussel sprouts with chorizo and parmesan were another favourite of mine.We tried the grilled octopus which didn't at all taste like octopus which was definitely a plus for me though I only had the tiniest sliver. The Fried Chicken Thigh was flavorful and the Gritts were surprisingly good too.Hmm what else was there? I think there were a few dishes before we arrived and everyone was happy though we were disappointed the was no Raviolo - all sold out but more reason to return!We ordered all of the desserts but again the Whoopie Pie which everyone was eying was all out :( The Banana bread pudding was textually great - the only complaint was the temperature. Some hot some cold. It felt like it should have been hot. Apparently the P&J cream puffs were pretty spectacular. The Candy bar was very, very rich.Also, I was very happy with the Pinot Noir - very smooth. All the beers have their own special glass. Some were cooler than others.Anyhow, everyone had a great time and really enjoyed the whole experience. The food is amazing. We were the last to leave and it was great to see the staff gathered around the bar. Seems like a great place to work!PS - I wish I lived in Chicago!"
"I almost don't want to yelp about this place because I want to save it all for myself!  Great service, great food, and as an added bonus, ample street parking!Duck fat croquettes - perfectly crispy on the outside, with the savoryness that you would expect from duck fat, and amazing, soft, mashed potatoes on the inside.  I'm clearly a fan of anything that plays with textures.Braised lamb shank - literally falls off the bone, and is oh so yum.Homemade sausage - YUMMMM.  You need to order this.  I don't even know what it is specificially that I loved so much about this, but it is flavored to perfection.Brussel sprouts - unfortunately, this is the 1 thing we ordered that I wouldn't get again.  The only part of this dish I liked was that they were cooked with chorizo instead of the typical bacon preparation.  What can I say, Sunda has spoiled me with their brussel sprouts.Finally, I can't leave this review without addressing the service.  Loved the attentiveness of both the owner of the restaurant, and the waiters.  The owner came by on a few occasions to check on us.  They sure know how to make you feel special!In summary, check this place out (or don't, so that it's easier for me to get resos)."
"The restaurant has a nice rustic yet modern decor.  Everyone was extremely friendly from the bartender, to the hostess and waiter.  Our waiter, Oscar, even helped both my date and me put our coats on upon exiting the restaurant.  However, the food left something to be desired.  Two is similar to a tapas restaurant where you're served small plates and are expected to share.  The food arrives to the table as soon as it's finished cooking not all at once.  But the issue lies in the VERY small portions with a HEFTY price!  My date and I started off with the Mixed Green Market Salad which was pretty tasty, but the portions came on a saucer sized plate which was really enough for one person.  The next round was the Hampshire Pork Belly which was damn good but again the portions were minuscule especially for the price.  We received 2 slices of pork belly with a couple of spoonfuls of cauliflower for $20.  Next round were the Sea Scallops, which were pretty bland in my opinion but again 2 small scallops for about $20.  I started with the Breckenridge Whiskey on the rocks which came with a one huge solid round piece of ice (the way it's supposed to be served) and that was a plus.  Overall, we paid about $70 before tip and left unsatisfied and still hungry.  Although, the food isn't horrible I can't see myself returning due to the insanely small portions coupled with enormous prices."
"I drive by this spot all the time and wanted to check it out. Had the chance to do so for my birthday on Friday when we were redirected due to the unexpected closure of our original destination. I must say it was a great diversion!We were greeted immediately upon our arrival and were able to get a table despite not having a reservation. The attentiveness did not end there. The staff was wonderful throughout our visit. The wine list is spectacular and so reasonably priced. Many of the wineries I visited last year in Napa for my birthday were well represented - it was difficult to choose (Try the Biale - can't lose!) The menu is small plates but much more than your typical tapas. Great for sharing, so go with people who have similar tastes! We shared the heirloom tomato salad and the beets. Delicious. We followed that with a pork bolognese pasta that was amazing. Lastly, we had the hanger steak with sherry braised mushrooms. I felt fulfilled, not stuffed, and saved room for dessert. French silk pie and pumpkin moon pies were the perfect ending to a delicious birthday dinner.  So happy to have been diverted from our original destination. We will definitely come back!"
This place provided the best meal I have ever had. Service was impeccable food was unparalleled. I would recommend a reservation although walk ins seemed feasible. Wine selection was great as well.
"Came here for dinner for a friend's birthday. The food was good, but nothing mind boggling or amazing. They say all of their dishes are ""medium plates"" but this felt more like tapas but with American food. Would I come back here again? Not unless it was for someone else, for me it wasn't that memorable."
"Flat out the best tasting Pork Chop I have ever had. The Faro Salad was extremely tasty and fresh.Roasted Fresh Vegetables were excellent as well. They have an impressive wine list and offer a fair amount of craft beers. Great selection of single malts, bourbons and ryes. All food is locally sourced and sustainable. Someone, and dare say more than one, cares about the quality of the food, the beverage program and the service. All service staff were friendly, professional and engaged in the process of service to their guests."
"My friend and I sat at the bar and we had no plans to order food; we were just there for cocktails. But after looking at the menu, and seeing what other people were getting, we decided to split the heirloom salad (on recommendation from the bar manager). Oh. Baby. Jesus. The tomatoes were so freakin tasty. The cheese had to have been made there or someplace close by. Amazing. And the icing was the little pieces of crunchy sea salt sprinkled on it. I'm not a huge fan of salad but I would order it again and again. Wait and bar staff - super friendly and very knowledgable about the cocktails. Decor - comfortable, like a soft, fancy cloud. I want to go to there.Loved it."
This place is so good! Do yourself a favor and try it. You will not be disappointed. We found this place on Yelp last year when we visited Chicago. It was are number one priority to eat there again during our visit last weekend. The couple that joined us loved the food and were happy we took them there. The only disappointment is that Two is a 6 hour drive from my house :(
"Hey TWO.  Welcome to the neighborhood.  We're happy you are here.  Naturally - kudos for the work enabled by Mr. Larry Vodak - great style!We dined last week and had some hits and misses.  I'll certainly be back to explore more but thought I'd offer a few of the highs and lows in the event anyone is ready and looking to make quick fixes.1.  BAR/WINE:  The wine list is SO massive and clearly meant to impress.  Yet I had to let the bartender in on the meaning of 'Brut'. She didn't know.  I had no navigator and therefore didn't choose very well.  I thought the champagne/cava list left everything to be desired.  Beers are interesting, cool, hip in selection.  The specialty cocktail I ordered just before dinner (tequila something) ended up being a barley passable, unremarkable marguerita.  2.  LOVES: The salad, duck pasta, flank steak - all ROCKED.  Great portion sizes and clearly expertly crafted.  Delicious, delicious, delicious.3.  We had a couple of misses too.  The duck-fat coquettes were tasteless.  I went feeling around for a salt shaker when I tried them.  Then just abandoned. There was another...but I've already forgotten it.  Service was fine.  I felt they did a good job for a newly opened restaurant."
This is our fourth time back in the past year and everyone we have taken has loved Two.  The Bread Pudding remains the best desert.  Lot's of new items on the menu though the Duck Fat potato croquettes are still a favorite.  Really enjoyed the halibut.  We will be back.
"This place rocks. I want everyone to know about it and yet no one to know about it so that I can keep coming here without a wait! Made a last minute reservation for 2 on a Friday night as my sister was arriving into town famished (me too!). It was easy and we probably didn't have to- though I am sure getting a res in the future will be hard as this place inevitably gets popular. The owner greeted us like friends as we walked in, which was really unique and nice. The draft beer list was great (local!) and I will have to try a cocktail next time. They had a variation of a manhattan as a special that I wanted to try (but was driving). The dishes are great to share. I had the pork bolognese which was amazing, and the Brussels sprouts were awesome. Must have the candy bar dessert! It has puppy chow garnish! Will definitely be back.UPDATE: True to my word, came back with my boyfriend only a week later, and still give this place 5 stars! Made a res this time, and definitely glad I did. The Brooklyn manhattan was definitely really good, and the duckfat-fried croquettes were awesome (mashed potato fried in duck fat- sweet!). The scallops were great as well."
"This was a very nice New American; the duck pasta, farro salad, ribs and banana bread pudding were particularly great and I loved the 1132 cocktail.  I am not sure it is quite as good as the reviews pegged it, but I am in general low on New American.  Great atmosphere though."
"We went to Two last night with a group of 18 to celebrate my birthday. The reservation was made last minute and I was appreciative the restaurant went out of their way to accommodate us.Two has a lot of potential - decent location, great ambiance and a yelp-worthy menu. Unfortunately the restaurant almost didn't rise to the occasion for us last night - mostly due to the chaos that ensued almost immediately once we were seated. The waitress, who had zero personality, seemed overwhelmed by our large party and could not get our first round of cocktails right. We had a hard time figuring out what to order and she offered little help. One friend was a vegetarian and when our first round of food came out, the waitress proudly announced it was ""vegetarian minus the duck fat"". Ok?Thankfully the manager stepped in and took over ordering for our large group and rectified our drink order. He turned a dinner that could have been a disaster into an enjoyable dining experience. Everybody enjoyed the food that came out - most noteable the hanger steak, the sausage and the potatoes. Since it's hard to judge a restaurant when you're with a large group, I'd like to go back and see if the restaurant can live up to the potential and rave reviews given by the other Yelpers."
"Great atmosphere, great beer list, great time.  Can't wait to go back.Get the chicken for 2! One of the best takes on chicken I've ever had. The sauce was unbelievably good. Citrusy buttery goodness.    The chef (Kevin) came out and gave us a complimentary Duck Confit.  Everything was tremendous.  The croquettes on the beet salad were perfect.  The bread pudding was muffin-like and drizzled in caramel, awesome.   Highly recommend."
"Nothing about this place stood out in a good way. It was mediocre across the board (service, food, ambiance).  Not worth the first visit let alone a second."
"I came here for their soft opening and the followings are what I had:P.E.I MusselsSeared Scallops - perfectly cooked scallopFried Chicken thighs - a must have, crisp skin, succulent meat & great flavor Berkshire Pork BellyDuck egg Pasta - don't know if it's the duck egg but the pasta is a tad under cooked/hard, but flavor is there (reminds me of the asian bbq duck).Banana bread puddingAlthough the duck egg pasta under delivered, however, everything else is spot on. The flavor is recognizable and tasty.  I'd definitely come back for round 2 when they're done with soft opening. Cocktails here are really good as well. If you like a laid back atmosphere, enjoy some good food and conversation. This will be the place. Last thing to mention, the service is tentative."
"Recently opened. Server was awesome - great suggestions and explained everything as it was served. Medium ""share"" dishes..for the three of us we had heirloom tomatoes - the best! Carrot soup - chilled and sort of sweet. I liked it my friends not so much. I didn't care for the OX / very gamey and my friends that ordered it said the same - it was our least favorite. Loved the halibut and two desserts...peanut butter and jelly puffs / chocolate cake of some sort. Very yummy but the three of us were over stuffed. Staff was great but still learning (we had to keep asking for serving utensils). A little pricey but will definately try again."
"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Really great atmosphere, good food, and great service. The owner sat down and chatted with us for awhile. We got to talking about wine. He left for a moment and returned with a really great wine from the cellar. Five woofs for sure."
"I had been dying to come here for months. The food was delicious. I found the service to be too pushy, but attentive. Was sad they were out of the ribs, but the 1/2 chicken dish was so great as a substitute. The scallops were so flavorful. I definitely want to come back to try the duck pasta and ribs!"
TWO is the number of times this place charged my friend's credit card.TWO is the number of bartenders behind the bar who took forever to get us more wine. TWO is the number of times one of the bartenders came out from behind the bar to kiss his (I'm assuming) girlfriend at the end of the bar.TWO is NOT the number of times I will be visiting this establishment.
"This place is sooo good. Seriously...everything is delicious. We got the potato croquettes in chipotle aioli to start, which was beyond good. Then we had the bruschetta with bacon - their special appetizer. We also had the special pasta - a cavatelli with bacon, peas, and corn, which was perfect - not too heavy but filling. Finally we shared the half chicken in thyme gravy with mushrooms - super moist and flavorful. My fiancé had the flight of beers and I had the Moscow Mule. Can't wait to go back to this place our next time in Chicago. Yum!"
highly recommend!
"My wife and I went to TWO for the first time on Friday, January 25th.  As we got out of the cab, I immediately recognized that this was the location of the old -- and quite terrible -- Black Sheep restaurant.  My mind immediately went to horrible flashbacks of that place.  I was so mortified, that I considered ditching our reservation (I kid, of course).Alas, my wife (the ultimate encourager) prodded us through the doors.  Immediately upon walking in, I felt a warmth that was missing from the old decor.  TWO was simple, comfortable, and airy, yet refined and classic at the same time.  I loved the look of the bar and the red barn doors that catch your attention.  We were quickly welcomed and had a quick chat with the host.We were seated in great seats near the windows.  After getting comfortable, our server came over to introduce herself and give a brief run-down of the restaurant.  I understand that some people may be ""tired"" of the farm-to-table theme.  But hey... it is tasty food and who doesn't want to support some of our Midwest farms.  In any event, if a restaurant does it well, then who cares?  Also, I have seen some rumblings about small plates being ""played out.""  Small plates is just a form of dining.... just like ordering entrees is a form of dining. Anyways, our server was very thoughtful and informative.  She made some great recommendations and was very nice throughout the evening. We started with the French onion soup and the duck fat potato croquettes.  My wife loved the soup and I loved the croquettes.  Perfect match!  We then enjoyed the scallops and the trout.  Both were great; I particularly enjoyed the trout.  We ended with the Duck Egg Pasta.  Which was tasty and a good dish to cap that portion of the meal. Of course, we had to have dessert.  The server recommended the banana split.  It was excellent.  The beer list, while not massive, was decent size and had very good options.Finally, we spent a good amount of time speaking to the owner.  We spoke mostly about his old school car that is terrible in the snow... it was humorous and fun.  Good times!The only suggestion I have for the restaurant is to work on a little sound proofing. Where we were sitting, there was an awkward echo bouncing off of something.  We were able to hear a conversation of another couple about 6 tables away... but everything else was just noise.  Obviously we were in the perfect spot for the echo reverb.  Maybe padding under the seats or on the ceiling may help that oddity.Loved this place and will definitely go back!"
Tapas style American food...Good food but VERY pricey $$$Exquisite atmosphere and the owner was a pleasure! Tables are very tight together though.Great unique selection of beers and local brews.  Menu changes every week!!
"Went here on Saturday night w/ a group of 7 girls for a birthday celebration. The food was amazing. We wanted to order everything on the menu and would have if we could eat it all! The menu changes pretty frequently so not sure if the plates we shared would be there the next time, but I would definitely go back, I am sure all their small dishes are amazing! I would give this place 5 starts but we had  a reservation and had to wait 20 minutes for our table. Which was a little annoying especially since we were all there just waiting in their front room. It is a cute place and I will go back! I think it would be better for smaller parties though, but then you can't order everything on the menu and share it!"
"Found this place randomly on Yelp. Our server was really attentive, water glasses were hardly ever empty, dishes came out at a good pace. Duck Fat Roasted Croquettes- Pretty good, nice crunch on the outside while being plenty potato-y on the inside, a good texture contrast, Pork Belly- REALLY good, tender, you could probably just pull this apart with a fork. Similar in taste to Chinese roasted pork (this is a must try if you haven't had it) minus the crunch of the roasted skin. Hanger Steak- A bit salty, even for me (love salt), but really enjoyed the medium-rareness of it...if that makes sense. Duck Egg Pasta- Can definitely taste the duck in this and you can feel the residue of the fat used to cook the pasta on your lips after taking a bite. The skin was insanely crunchy as well. Banana Bread Pudding- I have a major sweet too and was majorly satisfied with this. Would order it again. The portions that come out are small to medium sized hence they recommend getting 2-3 dishes per person. They came out one at a time and was well-paced. The environment is pretty nice- small, but not too crowded. Where we were seated, we could see into the kitchen which was pretty cool."
"What a gem!  Food was awesome but service was even more impeccable.  As a NY resident, I found Chicago restaurants to be great value (quality and price), but TWO is certainly on the top of the list.   Potato croquette, pork belly, mussels, duck egg fetuccini were out of this world.  And the prices were VERY reasonable; probably 50% of manhattan price.   But what's even more impressive was the service.  Shamandew (not sure of the spelling), who is  one of two business partner and manager that night was very accommodating, allowing me to change the reservation three times and when I couldn't find parking he took the keys to my rental and found parking four blocks away (also retrieved the car at the end of the night.). That's humbleness and true dedication to serving his customers.  My family and I immensely enjoy the food, delicious beers (ginger and another fruity beer) were memorable.  I plan to frequent the restaurant every time I come back to visit my daughter who is starting her first year of college nearby.  Thanks again for great experience, Shamandew!"
"Wonderful dinner tonight.   The halibut was perfect - I could not imagine toasted oats on fish but it really worked.   Great pasta, great dessert - and just a taste of the Puppy Chow.  Really attentive service too"
"Just had an amazing dinner at Two.  We had, and absolutely loved, the duck egg pasta, octopus, charcuterie, halibut, and pb&j cream puffs.  Each item had amazing flavor, especially the duck egg pasta and the halibut.  The descriptions sounded so simple, but the taste was more complex and interesting.  Decor was also really nice.  Relaxed, yet well thought out.  I was surprised by how large the space is.  The open kitchen was fun and not too loud.  Overall, there are many similarities to Avec between the menu, the innovative flavors, and the decor.  The location is a little off the beaten path and I thought it was tough to find online (no open table, search engine on yelp and google returned poor results).  I think Open Table would be a great addition and smart way to increase awareness.  Looking forward to our next meal at Two!"
"Went last night and did the restaurant week menu.  4 courses for $33, 2 options for each course, so the GF and I just ordered the whole menu.  Everything was outstanding (but especially the risotto, the duck pasta, and the arctic char), and the portions were generous.  We left stuffed.The service couldn't have been better.  We were greeted by the manager (I think) with a handshake and sincere gratitude right when we walked in the door, and on our way out.  Our water glasses were never dry, and the food came out hot.  We will definitely be going back."
"Talk about a fantastic experience.  I went with my fiance' to TWO for dinner last night and I was blown away.  I started off with a cool crisp raspberry cider, perfect for a warm spring evening.  While waiting for my honey I ordered the charcuterie plate.  Once he arrived he went for TWO's take on a classic old fashioned and WOW was that delicious (I stole a sip).  Our wonderful charcuterie plate arrived and was filled with many tasty options, we particularly loved the chicken liver pate and homemade jerky.  Our next plate was the risotto with ramps and a fried egg on top...this dish was outstanding.  The egg really made the flavors sing.  The ramp can be overpowering but everything was PERFECT in this dish.  I will go back for this dish, they need to keep it around for a while.  After finishing our risotto, we refreshed our cocktails and I chose a tasty bourbon tea and my partner chose a manhattan style cocktail.  All of our drinks were very well made and the quality of the liquor really came through.  For our third and final plate we chose the bourbon pork chop with fingerling potatoes.  The chop was cooked perfectly and had the wonderful sear you always hope for.  The combination of sear along with the flavors really made for a perfect union.  Overall, TWO exceeded my expectations and I am excited to go back soon with friends and try some more of their wonderful cuisine!"
This is my new favorite small plates restaurant. I have been here about 3 times. Fairly easy to get reservations. Great mixed drinks. I love how they always have specials and the menu changes frequently. Shows that the chef has depth. If I had to complain about something it would be that there is not enough seafood on the menu.
"It's a little off the beaten path, but worth going to. The service was very attentive and it was surprisingly quiet given its openness. The ambiance is good for either dates or dinner with friends. Food was delicious and the portions just right.Among our favorite dishes were the farro salad, spring bruschetta, and duck pasta. The cheesecake dessert was amazing too!"
"Just down the block in a spot that has turned over a lot.  Love it. I had a nice variety of small dishes (which is what they do) and and was impressed by the quality and complex nature of the food. The octopus was amazing. The bar was very good, with staff that knew what they are doing. I wish the bar was larger so you could enjoy it more. All in all a top drawer experience."
"The food and service were impeccable. They serve puppy chow as a dessert! I loved everything I ate here. There menu is meant to be shared so you can taste a lot of items on the menu. I loved the squash blossoms, potato croquettes, pork rib and pretzel doughnut."
"Really loved this place! First time I've ever been greeted with a handshake. Excellent food and service. The decor of the restaurant is beautiful. It has a casual, rustic vibe. Thanks for a great dinner!"
"I have now eaten, drank and desert-ed at TWO!  It was fabulous. We were able to enjoy an early dinner on Mother's day before a concert date.  Our food was fresh, with clean flavors and very nice presentation.  I had the muscles ... very nice ....and the Halibut - the best halibut I have ever had.... Seriously.  We came back after our concert for desert.  YUM!  We had the banana bread pudding and I loved the texture, taste and richness of this perfect ending.  Our service was top notch and did not stop at the dinner table.  We had a challenge hailing a cab after dinner.  The owner of the restaurant did something I could hardly believe.  When it became apparent that cabs were scarce, he drove us to the theatre himself!  Not only was I super impressed with that level of customer service, but it was great to be able to chat with him while we made our way to the theatre.  I wish he and his team the very best as they share their talents with Chicago.  So looking forward to going back soon!"
"The two of us took brunch at Two a few (yea two) weeks ago. What a great experience! The ambiance was perfect, and the waitstaff was more than attentive. The food was delicious, and who doesn't like interesting mixed drinks in the morning - ahem - I mean pseudo-afternoon? I am definitely looking forward to dinner here!"
"nice ambiance, tasty food (smaller plates though), good restaurant."
"Love this place and the owner. It's a shame Zak's place in Hinsdale closed, but the tradition of great food and great service carriers on in Yamandu's ""Two."" Highly recommend."
"Went for restaurant week and was thoroughly impressed.  All courses were delish and I will definitely go back and order off the regular menu.  Also, the staff is fantastic, they are attentive, welcoming, and make you feel comfortable without being overbearing.  They make great cocktails as well, will go back soon!"
"Can't go wrong at Two. The food, drinks, and service are all impeccable. You can tell everyone from the back to the front of the house takes their jobs seriously. Whatever the occasion, Two's a great place to enjoy a nice evening out. Just steps from the Blue Line to boot."
"Definitely one of the better places I've ever been to. The owner or manager greeted us as soon as we walked in and was very friendly, the staff all seemed to be happy working there and gave off good vibes. And the food was A+, I didn't know I liked tomatoes until I had them here, also the duck egg pasta stuck out. It was an incredibly unique menu that won't disappoint. Will be returning here for sure."
"Excellent food!!! Good selection of alcohol, not crowded and very reasonably priced. You would be hard pressed to find a better meal even at twice the price."
"This meal and dining experience was as good as it gets! Tom, Kevin and staff were some of the most polite and welcoming people I have ever met.  Our server was Oscar, who in tow with the rest, made us feel as if we were family in this comfortable and warmhearted restaurant.Our dishes were the mixed salad, croquettes, duck egg pasta, pork belly, halibut, and pork chop, in addition to a desert of mango, strawberry, and lemon-mint sorbet, and ricotta cheese cake.  Each and every bite made me more than happy that the dish was on my table, and as I told the manager, ""That pork belly changed my life.""  I dare any person in their right mind to try the lemon-mint sorbet and not have their face pulled into an immediate smile.I wish I could say more good about Two with sounding over the top and cheesy, all I can say is ""go,"" I promise you will not be disappointed."
"The good food and service are covered by everyone else - there's nothing else I can add to that so I'll leave that alone.I'll review this from a different angle instead - the business info shows that it's not good for children. It's true from the menu standpoint - it doesn't have a kids menu like grilled cheese and chicken fingers, yet I wouldn't expect otherwise. Other than that, I thought it very kid friendly. Our server offered us bread for our toddler in case he was hungry while we waited for our meal to arrive. Another server brought him crayons and paper to doodle on. He was also given a complimentary scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream for dessert (which to my stomach's benefit, he was too full to finish)."
"My man and I just got back from a wonderfully tasty dinner at Two in the 1100 block of Grand Avenue.  For us it's a neighborhood joint, but I recommend this fine, contemporary eatery to any foodie in the metroplex.  Why?  Three reasons:  1) service, 2) attention to detail, and 3) flavor.  When we arrived (sans reservation) we were immediately greeted by an engaging gentleman whom I can only guess is an owner of the restaurant.  He shook our hands, helped me out of my coat, and damn near vowed to seat us personally.  Although we had to wait for another family ahead of us to be seated as well as a table to open up, the service and attention were greatly appreciated and put us both at ease.  It seems the gentleman owner knew well that a happy waiting patron remains a happy patron despite the length of the wait when treated well, and we were.  After about 5 minutes or so (by no means a long wait) the engaging gentleman owner showed us to our intimate little table in a nice corner of the full restaurant. After receiving our menus, the gentleman owner returned, sat down with us, and asked us what we were thinking about getting.  He did an excellent job of being engaging, but not pushy or invasive.  It is important to note that I don't care for strangers or forced conversation, but I found the gentleman owner to be genuine and easy to talk to.  Likewise the waitstaff was knowledgeable, friendly, relaxed, and accommodating.  We ordered cocktails and several of their ""medium-sized"" plates to share.  Specifically, we dined on Two's market salad which contained fresh mixed greens, pumpkin seeds, mandarin, shaved apple, and I think parmesan with a cilantro vinaigrette.  It was light and refreshing.  Then we had their mussels and chorizo, fried chicken thighs, braised pork belly with whipped cauliflower, duck pasta, and topped it off with a second helping of the mussels and chorizo.  Each of these dishes had a great mix of homemade flavors.  It was a delicious surprise. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the food far exceeded whatever I had anticipated.  And again, the service was sharp.  Inexplicably, we had two waitstaff at our disposal, one of which was named Christopher and both of which were very good.  The piece de resistance occurred as we were leaving.  The gentleman owner got up from his table (yes, he was seated at another table with his peeps, enjoying the fare) and asked us about our experience.  Again, he was spot on, without being pushy.  Attention to detail is clearly his game.Two earns 5 full stars for all that it brings to the table, pun intended.  If you are looking for a comfortable spot to share really good American cuisine with friends or loved-ones in an earthy, modern atmosphere, for a good price,then look no further than Two."
Amazing food and great service. Loved the steak and panacotta.
"I really loved Two. Every week I try to visit a restaurant in the city I've never been to. Even so there's always a place I'll return to once or twice a month. It shifts from one place to the next as I discover gems like this. For this level of excellence I consider this place simple. I hope you get what I'm trying to say despite the fact I didn't say it very well. My favorite dish so far is the duck egg pasta with duck confit and duck skin cracklins. That dish is amazing and if my words couldn't properly express how I feel about Two, go try that dish and I think you'll understand."
"Ate at Two with five friends and we picked a bunch of items to split. Every singe item was wonderful! We had a friend who doesn't eat pork and they were more than willing to accommodate items. The service was very attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. I would definitely go again!"
"went there last night for dinner with a friendWe were greeted by the owner right when we arrived.the service was very great and the food was awesome, even tho I didnt get to try the lamb t-bone that I was hoping forstarted off with the wet hound, which was very good and surprisingly strong drink from a restaurant kind of have the mojito taste to it.My favoriate of the night was probably duck egg pasta! I was never a big fan of pasta but so glad we ordered it, the pasta was cooked just right not too saggy, when the dish came out, you can just smell the flavor of the duck fat blend in with the egg pasta, they have the duck skin super crunchie and a little sweet that just adds so much texture and flavor to the duck pasta, I think I can just order that and be satisfied with the dinner!we also ordered the lamb shank since the owner recommended it, it was good, but I wish there was more sauce to the meat.also the steak was prepared just right, a good cut of meat doesnt need too much seasoning, so the steak was just simple and good.we also ordered chilled berkshire pork cheek crostini, the pork was soo tender taste very close to pulled pork, and on a bed of creamy ricotta cheese, simple delicioustoo bad my friend wasnt feeling well toward the end of dinner, so we had to leave without trying the dessert menu, but I will definitely come back and try other dishes and try their dessert menu. Overall, it was an awesome dinner that I haven't had in a long time :)"
"amazing dinner.everything we had was cooked to perfection, seasoned well, and overall fantastic. heirloom tomato salad was bursting with flavor and freshness, with an amazing cilantro vinagrette. duck fat and potato croquettes were sooo tasty we wanted more. sausage was good, maybe a little dry. risotto was flavorful and topped with bacon.dessert was great too. pumpkin whoopie pie with vanilla was light and refreshing, lemon dessert with graham cracker crust was even better.i would stick to wine rather than the cocktails, they were a little too simple for my taste. the gin and juice literally was gin with grapefruit juice. the drink with mint needed a little more sweetness for balance.nice too that everything is locally sourced, fresh and organic, you can taste the difference. supposedly their menu changes, so i can't wait to go back. this place is in my top five. better yet, it's reasonably priced"
"Modern American ""tapas-style"" with fresh, well-chosen sustainable and local ingredients. Prompt and courteous service and a stellar wine list. Great atmosphere! Farmhouse meets modern decor. I appreciated the acoustic panels on the ceiling to keep the noise level at a comfortable decibel. Love it and will come back for more!"
