Farmhouse
"Absolutely amazing, true farm to table. Summer salad was very good, if you want something light. Buttermilk fried Chicken sandwich was out of this world. Bartender was extremely nice, he said the pork chop for dinner is amazing and the peas and carrots app... Who would have guessed that. Enjoy."
"I stopped by for lunch mid-week, mainly because the name of this place caught my eye.Whatever you order, ORDER THE BEER-BATTERED CHEESE CURDS. They come with a small container of house-made ketchup and aioli. (Tip: mix the two together before you dip because it tastes sooooo good.) These are perfectly crispy and extraordinarily cheesy.I had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich for lunch. It came with a side of chips, but I wish I had the forethought to ask them to substitute these for a salad side like the guy next to me. I was surprised at how juicy and flavorful the chicken breast was. Definitely a solid choice, though it didn't blow me out of the water like the cheese curds did.I love how local-focused this restaurant is. The flowers on each table are sourced from across the street, and all the beers on the menu are produced within a 200 mile radius. I didn't get a drink, but scanned the bar and noticed that they didn't have the usual generic bottles -- all local! Pretty great place to get a taste of Chicago far beyond deep dish and hot dogs. :)"
"I came here at 11:45am on a Sunday, excited for lunch. But what? They only serve brunch? Until 3pm??? Wtf!Anyway, I ended up getting a coffee (nothing special) and a Pasture Raised Burger with bleu cheese. The burger was not bad. But the fries and ketchup... they were pretty tasteless (prob because they were ""healthy""). I was not a fan. I am rarely disappointed with fries!Overall, just OK. Prob wouldn't go back again though."
"So first of all, if you are looking for a place in the city with good food and your reservations to other restaurants have fallen through, check this place out. I was able to get a reservation for 6 pm in the early afternoon on the same day. On a Saturday. Maybe this isn't typical, but worth a try. They have online reservations so you don't even have to talk to a human. ha. ha.Anyway, we were running late. Our original reservation was for 5:30 pm. We arrived at 6 pm with no problem. There are booths, tables and seating at the bar for seating options. We had a table which was totally fine. Our waiter was prompt in coming over and helpful in suggestions of the menu. He was helpful without being too cheery.We ordered the fried cheese curds. Ok. I know EVERYONE has them. I don't care. These are delicious. The three of us agreed that they were probably the best we have had.We ordered a family size platter of mac and cheese and that was enough for the three of us. My husband had the largest serving. They had no problem splitting the veggie burger for my friend and I. They even delivered them on separate plates! So yes, the family size platter of mac and cheese is enough for 3. It would be excessive for one. The fries are also delicious FYI.They had a good dark horse ale for just $5. Always good to find a good deal in the suburbs or in the city. Their mixed drinks are about $12 but potent.The ambiance was really nice, service was prompt. There is paid parking right next to the place so don't freak out if you can't find any street parking. We would definitely come back if in the city again...and didn't want to try anything else."
"When my friend picked Farmhouse for dinner all I could think was ""CHEESE CURDS!""  I read about these many times in others' reviews, and even the girl on ""Check, Please!"" was convincing.  My opinion is the same; the cheese curds are heavenly.  Lightly, but perfectly fried, and served with two sauces.  I liked the horseradish sauce, but I did not like their homemade ketchup.  Some things are just better loaded with preservatives and sugar, and therefore are best left alone.I ordered the ""Jinx Removing,"" from the cocktail menu.  This gin and honey lavender syrup concoction is delicious, but I'd only recommend it if you like refreshing, but slightly floral, beverages.  My friend asked if it tasted like soap, and I insist, it does not.I washed down my meal with the (get ready for this long beer name) Spiteful Breeding God Damn Chocolate Banana Porter.  It smelled like a coffee porter, but I could definitely taste the notes of chocolate and banana.  I always say I don't like dark beers, but I suppose I'm full of it, because this was amazing.Following that beer (yes we ate too, but hold on a damn minute), I noticed all three of my friends were raving about their fruit beer.  OH. MY. GET THIS.The cocktails and beer at Farmhouse are terrific!  But the food was only so-so.  Those cheese curds make a great bar snack, but the burger I ordered wasn't worth the price tag.  I ordered it ""medium,"" but it was very well done and ended up being very dry.  They added lots of blue cheese though, which gave much needed flavor.Our group shared the macaroni & cheese.  I would have much liked this as an entree instead.  It's big enough to share and wonderfully creamy.Even though my entree was disappointing, I'm still giving Farmhouse 4 stars because of the great drink list and the cheese curds.  Two of my friends shared the skirt steak, which looked really good, so I'd just steer clear of the burger here.Oh, and our server was awesome.  She's an aspiring actress that needed a new dream, so we carefully jotted down some ideas.  Astronaut?  Girl Scout Troop leader?  The list was endless."
"The restaurant has a very casual atmosphere but better food than that suggests. The saddle of rabbit and chicken soup were excellent. Service is very quick and friendly. The berry pie was tasty and not too sweet, but the crust was a bit too thick."
"SO DELICIOUS. Made a reservation less than a week in advance for Sunday brunch and the process couldn't have been easier (it was through Open Table). I changed the res a few times as our party size changed and each time I was able to get another table. Plus, it wasn't crazy crowded even though we came at noon. Always a plus in my book!On top of that, the food at Farmhouse is utterly delightful. Everything is locally sourced but the waitstaff isn't snooty about it - our waitress explained a few things to us, told us her favorites and then gave us some time to choose. Definitely get the cheese curds for the table (or just yourself) because they're point-blank amazing. They lighten the batter similar to tempura batters, so the fried outside is thin and the curd just melts in your mouth. So, so good. I also had a bloody mary, which to my delight came topped with a skewer of an olive, a non-fried cheese curd, a piece of salami and a fresh pickle. YUM. I also got the farmer's breakfast which was delicious, even if it wasn't as fancy as their french toast or the chicken biscuit - a few of my brunch mates ordered those and they looked great too. The food is delicious, the ambiance cool but not too cool. I'm sold, Farmhouse."
"5 stars for you Farmhouse!  WHAT a treat. this is the coolest, most low key yet high caliber food & drink quality restaurant.. and for that I love it. I'm not really into stuffy restaurants and this is far from that. laid back & awesome.they have an upstairs as well a patio so wherever you want to sit, you've got it. so I had a salad.. because I was trying to be somewhat healthy. the salad I got had mixed greens, chicken, and pickled beets (can't really remember the name). I'm not really into pickled beets but if I were, they were really tasty! okay the chicken though.. EXCEPTIONAL flavoring = best chicken of my life. this is not an overstatement. and the dressing was baller as well.I had their sangria which didn't really taste like sangria to me- I probably wouldn't get it again but it was not bad.. I just wanted a fruity sangria. also had a local beer- they have a wide offering of drinks- beers, wine, mixed drinks galore.great service, fun vibe, stellar food.. it's all there folks."
"Came here just for drinks. Beer was good, our favorite was the bottle of Raspberry truffle from abduction. Eric was a great bartender!"
"Saw this restaurant on Check, Please so I had to try it out.  The restaurant is known for its cheese curd appetizer.  I'm not a cheese lover, but it was really, really good.  Light, fluffy with great taste.  Hubby had the fish fry.  He liked it, but wish it had a little more flavor.  He loved the homemade ginger ale.I had the pork chop.  My goodness.  It was tasty, delicious and very  seasoned.  And big enough for two.  The garnish was strange - popcorn.  No veggies.  Strange.The service was great.  My only complaint is there wasn't enough veggies on the menu.  Where's the spinach or collards?  To serve a pork chop with no veggies makes no sense.  Especially for a restaurant named Farmhouse.Regardless, I LOVED the food and will definitely come  back."
Get the Amish chicken. And the bread pudding.
"This is a fun and vibrant watering hole and restaurant for the neighborhood locals and workers from River North, so be ready for unabashedly loud bar crowd at happy hour.  Very friendly and attentive bar service from exuberant and joyful barmaid; numerous good if not downright great draft craft beers, and a lively crowd. A colleague and I shared the fries and a cheese & meat board to nosh on while we knocked back a couple.  All good except the salami was exactly what I'd picture as ""farmhouse"" meaning a lot of unrendered fat, but that's my only minor gripe.  If I worked in this area every day I imagine I'd be here a couple times a week. There is also an upstairs dining area but I haven't yet seen it. This is not a good date place (unless you're attracted to tight spaces and high decibel levels in a downbeat stylized farmhouse setting), but it is a great place to untie the tie and loosen the shoe buckles (or straps) with friends and/or colleagues. Looking forward to a return visit, and the only reason I'm giving 3 stars is that the food didn't wow me; will give it a try again and update this review."
My friend and I popped in for some dessert and coffee after having some deep dish pizza! I wish we had the chance to try some of their food cuz everything looked and sounded yummy! We had the bread pudding with ice cream and cream sodas. I love the atmosphere and the interior decor (cozy and rustic).
"Farmhouse was awesome for lunch. They were amazing with my kids, the Mac and Cheese was incredible, as were the cheese curds. Nice staff, great food."
"Very tasty food, and it was there, right next to Steve's Place!Had it a while ago with the following:Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich - very tasty and tenderHand-cut fries - also very tastyBeer-bnattered WI Cheese Curds - addicting!I think I ordered from here once before, but have no record - still all tasty. This place is a bit expensive but worth it, and will come here again.Its a bit of a walk from 600 West Chicago Avenue, but worth the effort."
"3.5 stars, rounding up for service, ease of making reservations, and overall a pleasant dining experience. Oh, and cute half-circle booths on the second floor. I recently came to celebrate a flurry of events. Mind you, it was 0 degrees outside that night and yet we still managed to trek out here to eat. Appetizers: 2 words. CHEESE CURDS. I am salivating just thinking about these. It was my first time trying cheese curds as I'm not typically a big cheese person to begin with. I popped one in my mouth and out exploded a bite of heaven. So delicious, so flavorful, so freaking amazing. They're like little fried balls of string cheese that tastes infinitely better than my description. Hands down the best item of the night! In comparison, the baked mac & cheese was underwhelming and I would not order it again. Drink: I got the seasons soda which was strawberry that day. It was refreshing, light and did not taste artificial at all. Main dish: Pasture raised burger which I added a fried egg, bacon, and muenster cheese. It was a good burger, don't get me wrong, but I think much of the credit goes to the fried egg and bacon which if topped onto any burger can make it seem much more tasty than it really is. The muenster cheese was also an unique add.I also returned for brunch (ok I confess, I just wanted to eat the cheese curds again) which I thought was also about a 3.5. You can literally taste the freshness in the ingredients though - my potatoes tasted like they were just dug out from the ground that same morning. It was a very healthy, simple, and clean brunch as there's no excess of oil or salt anywhere. Still, it seemed like they were missing a little spark. The spicy potatoes though...that's good stuff."
"I'd been to and reviewed Farmhouse in Evanston, but the one on Chicago Ave is different enough to warrant its own review.  I made the reservation here to accommodate an out-of-town friend, so neither of us had been here before. I was running ten minutes late, and just as I parked I got a text from Farmhouse politely reminding me of the reservation and providing a phone number in case I need to contact them. I liked that touch - it wasn't pushy or rude, just a polite, ""Hi, we're still here and we hope you can still join us"" kind of thing.This space is smaller than the one in Evanston, and decorated with the different demographic in mind, and it works very well. Our hostess was smiling and pleasant, as was our server.My friend and I both ordered the same brunch item, which came with housemade pickles, ham, hardboiled egg, jam, relish, bacon, and good sized piece of coffee cake. I thought everything was delicious. I had a latte, which was fine, but the size of a cappuccino. My friend and I stayed and talked for two hours, and no one rushed us. Honestly, I have no complaints, would recommend, and will return."
"Farmhouse...oh how you tease. I say this because my friends and I all felt the best part of our dining experience was the drinks, appetizers and side. The entrees and desserts were OK, but we expected more.What we liked:Drinks- The Cider Sangria was a cool spin on the traditional sangria. If this is on their menu all year round I recommend trying it.- Stacey Special (think it's called that) is a bourbon drink with ginger beer. I'm not usually a bourbon drinker, but drink was mixed perfectly as to where all the flavors blended so nicely the bourbon wasn't overpowering.Appetizers- I love pretty much anything with cheese so of course I recommend the cheese curds.- I'm not usually a fan of brussel sprouts, but the Brussel Salad is delicious. I like how they shredded the brussel sprouts and mixed in the kale, cherries, cheese and bacon.- My friend got the chicken soup and said it was the best she's ever had. I didn't try it and she's no chicken soup expert so try it if you want to prove her right or wrong.Sides- The Mac & Cheese was damn good! It's just cheesy goodness and it is delicious. Get it. Try it. Love it.Entree(1 out of 4)- The Grilled Pork was perfectly cooked, tender, juicy and definitely worth the $27 price tag so said my friend....the ""chicken soup expert""What could have stayed in the kitchen:Entrees- The Indiana Fish Fry was a negative for me. The breading on the fish could have been crispier. This dish (in my opinion) sounds better than it taste.- The Rainbow Trout and Lamb T-Bone were just OK. My friends weren't overly expressed with these dishes.Dessert- We shared the Apple Pie and Cranberry Bread Pudding. Both desserts were good, but nothing original. All and all I feel that Farmhouse is a place I'd go back to, in the distant future, for drinks and for more of the Mac & Cheese."
"Farmhouse you did not disappoint from the service to the food you came out on top. Called ahead for a reservation based on a recommendation and glowing reviews. Turns out when I arrived there was no need but it is better to be safe than sorry. Starting with a strong, yet short, list of drafts my bartender made a recommendation which was delicious. Fried Cheese Curds, how could you go wrong. Followed buy their burgers, so good. No complaints and a great back story make this a place I will surely revisit."
"Best thing we tried were the cocktails (cider sangria was quite light and herby, as was a gin drink I had) and crispy cheese curds. I wasn't a fan of the overwhelming char on the cheese plate bread and the Mac and cheese was nothing special. Fries were also under seasoned and not as crispy as I like. Our servers were great and very accommodating of our large group."
Not gonna lie this place was delicious! It's my first time and I had the lamb chop which was amazing and some glazed carrots which gives you a nice sweet taste and a plus is they have great local beer list yall should heck it out just saying.
"Restaurants like Farmhouse are the reason I trust my fellow Yelpers. Seeing 4+ stars usually means it's going to be at least good (and more often than not, great). I'd put Farmhouse in the ""excellent"" category. Given the concept (local farm to table seasonal food, craft beers, etc.), this restaurant could easily come off as stuffy and pretentious but does the exact opposite. It's warm and inviting, cozy but not crowded, with decor that strikes the right balance between vintage and modern. We started off with a couple of cocktails and an order of cheese curds. I had a Manhattan with a local bourbon (Few Bourbon) our server recommended, and it was excellent;  it's evident that the bartenders at Farmhouse know what they're doing. The cheese curds, on the other hand, were out of this world good - pretty much everything about them was top notch, especially the dipping sauce (aka crack). I'm not entirely sure what the dipping sauce was, but I know it had some paprika in it. We both ended up dipping French fries in it the rest of the meal until it was gone entirely. D*mn.The entrees also impressed. I had the burger with bacon added, and it was a generous portion (always a question whether it will be enough at a nice place like this) and cooked to perfection (medium, juicy, flavorful). I ended up only eating half of it before being full (partially on account of the cheese curds, partially because the burger was massive). The gf had the Roasted Amish Chicken, which also came in a very generous portion and featured some of the most flavorful chicken either of us had ever had.The only thing keeping this review from 5 stars was where they seated us. We had a reservation yet were seated at a table right below an air vent, which made for an intermittently uncomfortable experience (and resulted in the candle on our table being blown out). Eventually the air stopped blowing, but I'd think that Farmhouse could figure it out or not put a table in this specific area.I'll look to stop back in the next time I'm in Chicago once some other seasonal items are on the menu. Farmhouse is a winner."
"You had me at cheese curds! I really loved this concept, farm fresh, local food and drinks. I started with an old fashioned made with a local bourbon and luxardo cherries. It was divine. We split an order of cheese curds, which I could have eaten all on my own... Because they were amazing. Super salty, light crispy crust and a spicy dipping sauce. For my main I ordered the gnudi in broth. It was tasty, but desperately needed more broth and a larger portion. It felt more like an appetizer. (And, I'm not a big eater or a big person so that says a lot!). I wish I had ordered the Mac and cheese, it looked amazing and filling....maybe next time. Despite the slightly disappointing entree, I'll be back."
"Our experience here was a bit odd. I made a reservation for four of us ladies on a Sunday just before noon. As soon as we arrived, we were met with levels of unfriendliness and a lack of accommodation to which we are unaccustomed. It began with uncomfortable seating. There were two mature women in my party, and we were offered seating that was uncomfortable for them...squeezed up beside the bar with barely enough room to sit up straight, and then, when we asked to move, squished onto a bench that lacked adequate space for a normal sized posterior. When we asked for a nicer space, we were met with rudeness from the hostess, who seemed surprised that we wouldn't just be grateful to have any old spot in the place. Oh well, we could have gotten over that had our server not had a similar attitude. He was somewhat polite most of the time, but when my mom (who, I admit, is a bit more pushy than I myself would normally be) asked if our food would be out soon, he literally scoffed and said ""we're busy."" Anyway, once our food was served, it was enjoyable. The cinnamon roll with blueberry, oozy goodness? Yum. The cheese curds? Mmm. I didn't think there was a whole lot of food included in the farmhouse meal for the price, but what was there, was tasty.The restaurant had a cool vibe and enjoyable food. I wish the staff had come to work that day with better attitudes, but perhaps I'm just not used to farm fresh snobbery. The food didn't blow us away enough for me to even consider calling our visit ""a-okay."""
"Farm to table is becoming an irritating marketing bullshit phrase that often has nothing to do with reality or good food.  Not such the case here.  I had lunch with a friend.  Their menu is small and extremely affordable.  I had the fried chicken sandwich.  Juicy meat, some damn good secret sauce.  The side salad was divine.  It tasted like the greens had been picked within the hour.  The dressing so light and perfect.  Homemade potato chips - yum.  If I lived in Chicago, I would eat here regularly for lunch.  It was crowded around 12:30 but emptied out around 1:15 and was a great place to just sit and gab with a friend over wine and sandwiches.  Hats off to the Chef on this place."
"We simply could not have had a better experience here. Our reservation was honored immediately, we sat upstairs in a busy but not too close area, our food (including curds) was absolutely delicious, and the beer list proved to offer options that were just right to pair with our meal. In response to other reviewers who have commented on beer prices: we were impressed with the pricing for a nicer restaurant. They could have been set much higher and, again, care has been taken to offer flavors that are consistent with flavors in meals. Nothing too oddball and lots of variety. I had the newer gnudi and it was a perfect portion and delightfully earthy with the onion broth and sun chokes. Delicious. Though we didn't have room for dessert, I would happily return with a bigger appetite and enjoy more options. Very, very good."
"I really want to like this place, but the two times I've been there, I've been underwhelmed by the food. The first time, I had the burger, which is one of their key items and it was't that great. I DO, however, recommend the cheese curds. They are by far the best thing on the menu and exceptionally delicious. Get two orders. You'll need it. The second time I went, I got the pork hash. Again the meat was a little dry and I needed hot sauce to help add some moisture to the meal. Sadly, the hot sauce came out super fast saturating my meal, which was my fault. However, even still, not quite what I was hoping for. Service is average if not on the slightly slower side, and the drinks are good. Overall, I really appreciate their farm to table concept, and am a big fan of their messaging and mission. On the other hand, not the biggest fan of their food."
Being a Northern CA foodie makes it hard to be impressed and yet this place exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds.  Simply divine elegance with the freshest ingredients available made for a memorable meal.
"I came here with for a light lunch and wine (not one in the same...at least on that day!) and had a great experience. The server we had was very friendly and helpful at recommending a wine that we'd like. The food was quite tasty (salad & sandwich/soup, respectively), and the location (right off of the brown line) can't be beat. My only complaint is that at least where we were sitting, it felt a little tight...was just a little too close for comfort to our neighbors. But, it's not a total dealbreaker, just something I'll keep in mind going forward."
"The food was phenomenal, the drinks were fantastic, and the service was spot-on even when the place was packed. This is a great place for Brunch!!"
"I've been to Farmhouse now on a couple of occasions. I like that the menu items are seasonal, which usually means fresher food. Although the food here is good, nothing really stood out to me. On our last visit we had the Veggie burger. I liked that it sort of tasted like a hush puppie. Something was missing though. I wish the flavor was either more intense or spicy. The fries were okay, but I've definitely had better. Wish they were seasoned a little bit more. The restaurant itself is a casual atmosphere and there are two levels. Not my go to place, but still a viable option if you happen to be in the area."
"Very happy with my experience from making a reservation to service and food.  We came as a party of 10 and our server was helpful and graciously accommodated our request for separate checks.  We enjoyed the beer, app's, dinner and dessert.  You can tell when a restaurant cares about the food and the service and Farmhouse falls in that category."
"Delicious food, great service, awesome cocktails and craft beers. You won't go wrong trying this awesomely trendy and deliciously gourmet restaurant. Definitely try the cheese curds...MOUTH ORGASM!!! Enjoy and don't listen to the lower star reviews. I'm not sure what happened during their visit; ours was fantastic."
"This place is great!! Love the decor and sitting at the bar. My husband and I first came here so we could try their beer. We ended up also getting  some fried cheese curds which were AMAZING. The second time we came was with another couple for dinner. Everyone's food was great and the service was okay. I am very particular about my burger - always medium rare. My burger came out so over well- done I had to send it back. I normally never do that because I feel bad but there was no way I could enjoy my dinner. I sent it back and by the time it came back correct, my friends were already finished with dinner. I definitely wouldn't recommend sending your food back during dinner rush hour. We came back a third time for Brunch with 4 of out friends and had a great time. Sat upstairs and food came quick and was awesome. I got the Benedict and it was good, friends got the hash and flatbread and thought they were amazing. We also got bloody Mary's which came with beer backs - so tasty! Definitely a fun spot to try out."
"Overall, think it was kinda pricey for what I got (food/ambiance/decor)... but still a good meal nonetheless.You MUST get the beer battered cheese curds. I don't know how they make it, but I've never had it like that anywhere else. It was the most perfect little creation that I wish I could find back where I live. The waiter recommended the chicken .. which was pretty good. There was fried chicken and roasted chicken over some vegetable medley. However, I don't think it was worth the ~$27. Chicken was on the salty side, but its tenderness made up for it. My friends got the burgers, which they all thoroughly enjoyed (veggie and nonveggie). The burgers seemed more reasonably priced ~$13, so if I were to come here again, I'd get one of those."
"After hearing all the great things about Farmhouse, I decided this would be a good place to celebrate my sister's birthday.  I had made reservations for 7:30 pm for a party of 7 on a Friday night, but half of the party was running a little behind.  Farmhouse did not make a huge fuss and still accommodated us.Farmhouse's menu is always rotating (besides their appetizers) because they only use the finest ingredients from local farms.  They make everything from their condiments to their sodas from scratch.  We started with a couple of appetizers:Beer Battered Wisconsin Cheese Curds: cheese curds served with homemade catsup and spicy curd sauce.  The batter had the right amount of crunch to it, while the inside was still light and gooey.  I enjoyed pairing these curds with the spicy sauce for the extra kick.Jerky & Nuts: cured beef with roasted almonds.  I would never thought of pairing jerky with nuts, but the combo actually works.  The cured beef offered great flavor and chewiness while the almonds gave off that crunch.  The only complaint is the jerky is a little tough, even by jerky standards. Baked Cheddar Mac and Cheese: This is probably the worst mac and cheese I had in a while.  It lacked flavor and was really mushy.  Definitely pass on this.For my entrée, I decided to go with the old world grains burger (vegetarian).  It was accompanied with fries.  The patty was created with mostly quinoa layered with mushrooms, poblano pepper, garlic mayo, tomatoes, and onions.  The complexity of the ingredients complemented the burger well.  On the other hand, the fries were just mediocre and the housemade ketchup was lacking flavor.  I was expecting a hearty ketchup, but got a watery sauce instead.  A bit of a letdown because I love my potatoes.I enjoyed most of the food here, but didn't think it was mind blowing.  It is mostly due to the most basic things not meeting my standards: the mac and cheese and the condiments.  Overall, I wouldn't rush back here for another meal.  With the price tag on these entrees, I would take myself somewhere that offers more unique and tastier dishes."
"This was my first stop during a recent trip to Chicago and man, was it a good decision. I sat at the bar with a friend and was entertained and delightfully served by Stacey. We shared some of the fried cheese curds to start (a must have!) and both ordered something from the extensive beer and wine list. Being an out-of-tower, I was excited by the many local craft beer options on tap! Both of our mains were delicious and we loved the trendy, but not over the top, interior. A great place to get away from the tourist fray."
"Seriously fantastic, I love their food! Simple and delicious, minimalist and let's the food speak for itself. Highly recommend!"
"A great find! Amazing! The food is fantastic and the service even better. The cheese curds are crispy and fresh and delicious. They don't taste too greasy and they're super squeaky. Perfection! I didn't care for either of the sauces they came with, but they were perfect just as they were. My husband got the burger, I know kinda boring,  but he said it was the best burger he's ever had. I just got the mac and cheese and it was incredible! Probably one of the best I've eaten. It was creamy and cheesy and the noodles were perfectly cooked. I really wanted dessert but there was just not more bit of room. I also had glass of cider that was crafted specially for Farmhouse and it was the perfect drink to go with the mac and cheese."
"I went here for brunch the other day and I can't wait to try the dinner menu! They have cheese curds, instant luv right there. Everything from the decor , to the mimosas, and the food was on point. They didn't get the fifth star only bc our food took over 30mins plus for eggs etc... The table that was next to us ordered almost the same thing and their food came out a lot quicker and we were already an half hour in on our dinning, we knew something was up. But overall I left wanting to come back again."
"High hopes for this place and I wanted to like it and the food badly but.......We went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Seating was quick but we did have reservations. Loved the decor.Service - we had a cheerful waitress but food took a long time to get to us. Food - we ordered french toast and the burger. The french toast was way too sugary. Want to make it at home? Spread a lot of strawberry jam on some white bread and there you go. Did I eat it all? Yes, why? The wait made me hungry. The burger wasn't exceptional either. The ingredients seemed fresh but I'd suggest you walk up to the whole foods and try their sandwiches instead. Fries were so-so."
"Very good food besides the fact the waiter forgot part of my order, after he brought my food not once did he ask me how my order is so I can tell him that he forgot my meal. Once I brought it up to him he said ""oh I'm sorry I'll check with my cook."" Why would I want it anymore?"
"Two words: Cheese Curds. Love this place. Have been a regular here many times as I used to work right next to it. Beer and wine is good, food is solid, but the cheese curds will make you drool. If anything, it can be a bit pricey, but worth the money. Great for a start to your evening!"
"Farmhouse was a perfect restaurant for a perfect day. It was chill, friendly, and delicious.I was the only patron when I first arrived for my 11:00 AM reservation; however, the crowd perked up by the time we left over two hours later. The initial solitude gave me ample time to assess the solitary vibe of Farmhouse. It's rustic with a blatant locovore current; both of which are trending. I thought that it was nice, but my only concern is that it's peaking and may soon be out of style. Regardless of the staying power of trends, I think that the ambiance of Farmhouse lends itself for a casual drink or meal at the bar, a date, or visit with friends.I started with a mead recommended by my server Lauren. I explained my lack of preference and familiarity with beer and she, in turn, suggested the ""Kill All the Golfers"" mead. She explained that it was effervescent, which is is a word that tugs at my heart stings. I HAD to get that mead and I loved it. It was crisp, faintly sweet, and had delicate carbonation. I later followed up with the Wisconsin Old Fashioned which was the most delightful interpretation that has crossed my pallet.I ordered the Roasted Baby Beet Salad and followed it up with the Short Rib Pot Pie. My friend had the Chicken Breast Sandwich. We were both giddy from the experience.My Roasted Baby Beet Salad was light, sweet, and hinted at the earthiness that accompanies beets. My friend tasted it and quickly asked about the dressing. That's the pickled walnut vinaigrette you're tasting, my friend! Yeah - I didn't know that you could pickle walnuts either, but isn't it delicious! My my!I'm inclined to say that the salad took the spotlight over my Short Rib Pot Pie. The pie was savory, rich, and a lovely experience; however, my mood had me more inclined toward lighter foods today. I ate most of it but took the rest home for a later treat. Lauren assured me that it's one of their menu items that keeps well.My friend's Chicken Breast Sandwich was served with a side of mashed potatoes. I'm unsure if the mashed potatoes was Farmhouse's modification of fries (as listed on the menu) or if it was the unmentioned substitute. Either way, my friend made no comment on them. What we both loved was her sandwich. It was served open faced and was INCREDIBLE. I'm shaking my head while writing this because I am unable to conjure words to describe how delicious it was.We had *such* a positive experience at Farmhouse that we laid it all on the line. Well, at least my friend did. She asked to meet the manager. I've met many chefs and restaurant managers but usually only because they're making obligatory rounds. This was so terrific that we specifically sought out this one and invited him to chat with us for a few minutes. It was that terrific!"
"This place was great! We had a reservation (early, at 5:30 so we could catch a Second City show at 8:00) and were seated upstairs right away. Our server was great and made some really good suggestions.They have their own hard cider so we tried both of them. They were okay but we weren't in love with either of them.Per our servers suggestion I had the Primavera- it was totally unique and delicious! It's an app but that and a side of their house made potato chips was the perfect size meal.Hubby had a grass fed burger that he said was really very solid - and the French fries were amazing.Definitely enjoyed this place and its prime location across from the Chicago-Brown L station! Check it out, you won't be disappointed in their locally sourced, organic, farm-to-table food!"
"Farmhouse absolutely masters. In my mouth is a long, thick, juicy piece of hot meat that is slightly sweet, golden and delicious. Juices every whar.Listen.  Yes, their tartar sauce is blindingly white, slightly-whipped and delicious but WHATEVER that brown sugar, cherry vinegar concoction they put before you? Mouthgasmic. Might want to skip the tartar all together because it's truly unique and out of this world tart, tangy sweetness.It's another snowy, dark, cold Chiberian day and discomfort be damned, I was determined to get it on with an exceptional plate of fish and chips... at least that was the goal.After quickly scanning through my iPhone Yelp app for nearby white fish lunch options, decided to jump a quick brown line train over to Chicago to check this place out, since it seems to be packed for dinner service.It was about 11:30am and I was perhaps the only customer on this nasty, slushy day and that did not bother me because the nice bartender gave me great service and there was even a cute busboy darting back and forth behind me to make sure I was happy."
"I'm honestly a bit confused by the great reviews, because the high reviews were the reason we decided to try Farmhouse for dinner on a Friday night.Obviously a cool concept, and the restaurant itself has great ambiance. Service was also good. What was really disappointing was the food, which is kind of baffling.We started with the cheese curds which are apparently rave-worthy. The cheese was tasty, but they were so incredibly greasy that they were soggy, and the battered exterior actually melted and fell apart off of the cheese. Odd. I also ordered a cheeseburger and fries. The cheeseburger was very average, fries were bland but crispy, but I absolutely cannot believe how terrible the ketchup was here! If you can imagine unsalted, cold tomato soup (that tastes like the inside of the tin can), that is the ketchup at Farmhouse. It was really strange because it made me unable to eat the fries, because it would mean dipping hot fries into runny, bland, soupy ketchup. Seriously. What the hell. I will not be returning."
"We recently had a great brunch here while visiting Chicago.  We sat upstairs and were one of the only tables there.  Our server was a hipster, but I could look past that based on his GREAT table side manner.We started with the fried cheese curds.  Yes, this is an odd choice for brunch, but I'm from Boston where we don't see a lot of cheese curds.  They were freaking amazing but you can't really go wrong with fried cheese.  I got the veggie eggs with a side of toast and potatoes for my main course.  Everything was tasty, BUT the eggs were waaaaay too salty.  It annoys me when restaurants do this since it's so easy not to.  That was my one downside to the entire meal, though.  Also, the french press coffee is ridiculously good.Recommend!"
"I loved the decor and the theory behind the farm table concept. The brunch menu had pretty much anything you craved and it was fresh/ organic / local.I had the farmers breakfast and biscuits on the side which was pretty filling. I will say that our entire table added salt, ketchup and hot sauce to everything. I thought the food presentation could have been a little better.Aside from that, I would definitely go back with a group and maybe try their quiche or another dish."
"We made a reservation for two and so were quickly seated at a table. It was pretty packed so I understand why he service was a little slow. This place is known for their crafted menu, where all the drinks and food items are from Midwest breweries or farms. This place brought out some of my Midwestern pride because that beer menu looked fantastic. I tried a locally brewed American pale ale- Daisy Cutter- and really enjoyed it. We also started off with the beer battered Wisconsin cheese curds-- delicious, ygooey cheese that can be dipped in a ketchup or spicy sauce. They were out of the marketplace flatbread, so I'll have to come back for that! This place has many healthy dishes, but there seems to be only a few options to choose from for an entree."
"I got the fried chicken sandwich and my wife got the fish and chips. It wasn't a huge slab of chicken as you might think, but it was definitely one of the best ones I've had. The bun was amazing. Everything was fresh and delicious. Definitely would recommend."
Moving a a snail pace. Got here 2 hour s ago. Managed to get 2 drinks and greasy cheese curds split by 4.  Service and  food is bad.
"This place really underwhelmed. The farm to plate theme is something I've experienced in cities all over and this one really failed at execution The beer list -  pretty much a sampling of the same beer types over and over from different quasi craft breweries. The menu - sounded good although I opted for a burger. The thickest, most over cooked lean local beef I've ever experienced. Quite possibly the most tasteless thing I've ever eaten. The toppings add up quick and I found myself eating a very marginal $20 burger. The staff - needs some serious attention training. At my first bite I knew I was going to be unsatisfied, however, I didn't get a follow visit from our sever until I caved to my hunger and muscled through the awful dish. Possibly by design?  Who knows...spend your hard earned cash elsewhere!"
"Service wasn't great.  They sat us upstairs and then forgot about us.  It was 15 minutes before they even took drink orders.  However, we had some folks show up late, and they happily accommodated them even after we had already ordered.Food was good.  Wisconsin cheese curds are amazing, but a little too greasy.  My friends got burgers and they looked amazing.  I tried some of the veggie burger and it was surprisingly great - almost better than the regular burger....almost."
"Had the veggie burger and cheese curds, yum!  Humdinger was AMAZING.  Would go back just to drink the cocktails."
"Previously one of my favorite spots in the city is now probably the most awkward. We came one of their opening weekends years ago, chatted with the owner and were so delighted to have the spot in the neighborhood. Oh how the mighty have fallen. Came here pretty early for dinner on a Saturday. Restaurant almost essentially empty yet they say my husband and I in the most uncomfortable booth of all time. Upstairs. By ourselves nobody else on the floor. We asked to move to a more comfortable seat and we got a lot of huff and puffs even though we were the ONLY patrons upstairs. It was super awkward to be sat on our own floor like we were the ugly folks they wanted to hide. 10 minutes later they sat anther party upstairs. Right next to us. So uncomfortable seeing as the tables were inches from one another.Fast forward to the end of our meal - food still yummy as ever - and we say we want all three plates to go. The waiter stacks each plate on top of one another then dumps all three meals into one box. Gross! You dot put the bottom of a plate where waiters and food runners hands have been on top of the food I wanted to later eat. That's just like restaurant cleanliness 101. Yarf. Probably won't come back. Too bad too."
"What an amazing concept! Farm to table, locally sourced, antibiotic free, hormone free food. While the ingredients were fresh, the cooked product was underwhelming.Upon reading some yelp reviews, I ordered the Amish Chicken. The salad that came with it was so delicious. Too bad the chicken was dry and tasted like recycled paper in my mouth. The dark meat was slightly more edible. I had two bites of the chicken breast and it was dry and chewy. Beer selection was great and they have home made sodas. The service was spotty. I checked Open Table there were plenty of reservations available, but it was raining so heavily I didn't want to commit to a specific time and I assumed since they had plenty of rsvp available it would be fine. We walked in w/o reservation and the hostess was hesitant when we told her we had no reservations and told us we could sit at the bar or at the window table if we could so kindly leave in an hour and a half. Very loud music.Great concept of a restaurant but quality leaves much to be desired."
"Farmhouse has been on my list to try for several years and I'm happy I finally made it in.I went for brunch and was looking forward to some eggy goodness.  I ordered the quiche with a side of sausage.  On the side was a generous salad dressed with the one of the best vinaigrettes I've tasted.  It had razor thin slices of sweet onion and radish, which added the perfect bite.The quiche was a deep wedge of dense egg custard nestled in a perfectly crisp, buttery, and golden crust.Sausage was just spicy enough and worked well between forkfuls of that tangy salad.The server was quite congenial and answered my companions' many questions with ease and delight.Must go back for dinner!"
This place has so much potential...yet did not live up to the hype from other reviewers. Decor was awesome. Cool vibe. Huge beer list. So much potential...Husband and I both got burgers ($13) dressed differently ($1 for each extras and $2 extra for an egg). Burger was ordered medium...came out slightly pink but tasted over done...dry and blah. Bun was dry and flakey. Possibly the worst burger I've ever had (and I had a burger for lunch that was awesome-Epic Burger) No sauce. The fries were ok and they make their own ketchup which I wasn't crazy about either. Service was just ok. Nothing to write home about. Took over 10 minutes for our server to come and bring waters (which usually would not sit well withe). Other than that she was attentive. Maybe other menu items are better...I wouldn't go back to find out. Only giving two stars because it looks cool and the fish platter the guy next to me had looked 20x better.
"Smallish eatery focused on local (Midwest) fare. In that, they source almost all of their ingredients and offerings from either Illinois, Ohio, Indiana or Michigan. This includes a huge variety of micro-brews and hard ciders. I grew up with these things, so it made a lot of sense to me. They had Lake Perch which I must order whenever I find it on the menu. My meal was very good and the vinegar / mustard seed reduction was outrageously delicious.The service was pretty cool too. Paced, informative and helpful. I thought Farmhouse was very good and I intend to go back."
"Had brunch here yesterday morning with a few friends before the game. I had the Eggs Benedict that came with a side of spicey potatoes. One of the poached eggs was a little over cooked but everything was still delicious. Staff was friendly and attentive throughout our visit.If I'm ever in the area again, I'd definitely check it out again."
"I'm pretty into this place. My friend lives pretty nearby so I don't really know about the parking situation. The space itself is urban/cozy/country. If that's even a thing. I'm pretty sure it is a thing because that's what Farmhouse is. Things I discovered while there: 1: They have awesome homemade chips that come with a dill sauce. It's yum.2: Their beer menu is organized by state and lists the distance the beer had to travel in order to get to the restaurant. 3: The burgers are amazing. My two friends got the veggie burger and I got the regular burger (you know... representing the omnivores out there). 4: You can get mac and cheese on the side instead of fries & that was basically the best decision I made all day. It was delicious and pillowy-- like a cloud of pasta and cheese. The staff was also freakishly knowledgeable. Out waiter knew everything about all the ciders which was impressive. I'm not much for ciders myself, but one of my friends did order a cider with hibiscus and peppercorn notes. High reviews overall. I'll definitely be going back at some point."
"I had a bill last night for 20 dollars which I put on my credit card. We left a cash tip, so my card should have been charged for 20. But this morning when looking at my online statement, it shows that I was charged 24 dollars. Listen, I'm not one to complain about 4 dollars, but that is straight theft. We left the waitress over 20 percent in cash, so there was no need to put extra tip on my credit card. She was a female waitress probably in her late 20s, with dark hair and bangs. I will be calling the restaurant today to let them know about this."
"Farmhouse sounds alot better on paper than in reality-Farm to table, cute bric a brac decor, solid sounding menu.We decided to come in for Sunday brunch.  Service was prompt and courteous and we started off with a couple bloody marys.  Following the hipster trend, it was served with a shorty of Rhinelander beer.  I hope this never catches on as the beer is simply not good.  On the other hand, I thought the bloody marys were properly spiced and balanced.  Beware of the pickle they serve alongside, it was unexpectedly spicy but paired well with the drink.I went with the Farmer's Breakfast while my better half opted for the Eggs Benedict.  Neither of us were impressed with what we ordered.I thought the scrambled eggs (served with leeks and white cheddar) were fine and my nueske bacon was incredible as always.  However, the advertised spicy breakfast potatoes were a total let down.  Served with both of our dishes, the potatoes lacked any real flavor or spice.  The real letdown were my girlfriend's eggs benedict.  Both of her poached eggs were overcooked thus leaving no runny yolk to help soften the dry english muffin.  Hollandaise sauce was sparingly applied as well so basically it was an open face egg and cheese sandwich.  This is basic cooking 101 and they failed.Conceptually, I am all behind Farmhouse but with just an average experience, I won't be back."
"Finally came back here for the supposedly delicious burger.We were sat and told the kitchen was closing. We knew we wanted burgers so we ordered right then. Sadly my burger was burned on the outside and no amount of condiments covered up the bitter taste. I told my waitress and she said the kitchen was closed. She might as well have said, ""Tough shit."" But she was very nice."
"I had brunch here one late morning and hopped on the eggs benedict. I was concerned with the ""spicy breakfast potatoes"" it came with, because breakfast potatoes bore me and spicy breakfast potatoes just sounds like hanging out with your socially awkward cousin who's only form of expression is flipping his straight, black hair and mumbling the f-word. If you don't know what I mean, don't worry about it. Anyway, I was able to swap those out for some veggies of the day, and they were okay. The eggs benedict was the star of the show. If you don't read a word of this up until now, perk your ears up for this: ORDER A HOUSE MADE SODA. The flavors change depending on what's sprouting up in the backyard, but I sipped on the pear fennel. If they've got pear fennel, order enough to bathe in - it's that good, and I'm sure it's exfoliating, too."
"Farmhouse was nice, and TBH, nicer because I didn't have to pay. A group of about 15 of us traveled to Chicago for business and made a reservation for dinner on a Monday night here. The decor is very antiquey-natural, which fit the vibe of super local food and drink and farm-to-table cuisine. We started with drinks and I wanted to try local Chicago brews, so I started with a blonde ale that was delightful. We ordered a few rounds of pretzels for the table, and you just can't go wrong with knots of soft, delightful bread. They came with two sauces, and the spicy mustard was the best.I had some Amish chicken for dinner, which was nicely crisped and was a fairly sized portion. During the dinner course, I tried their local saison beer, which wasn't my favorite, so I switched back to the blonde again.I didn't try a first course (the beet salad was a popular choice for our table) or dessert, but the food was good enough that I might drop back in for a meal or light snack if I were back in Chicago and had more than a few days. I'd want to try other new spots, but if Farmhouse was in the neighborhood, I'd consider stopping in again."
"So much goodness here! The atmosphere was relaxed and nice. We were seated upstairs. The service was kind of slow, but friendly. The food was incredible. We sampled the ham hock, the burger, roasted beets, fries, fried rainbow trout, cheese curds, and Mac-n-cheese! The beets were kept simple, but they were tasty. The fries are hand cut, skinny, and delicious. The burger was tasty. It was slightly overcooked and I didn't enjoy the charred bun, but the meat itself was great. The homemade pickles were very tasty. The fried fish was good. Not very crispy, but it had good flavor and a generous portion. The cheese curds were really good! They were served with an amazing homemade catsup and another sauce I didn't try. We ordered the table Mac-n-cheese which was a very generous serving. Four of us couldn't finish it. It was rich, creamy, cheesy, and covered with more cheese. Highly recommend it. Everything on the menu sounded great and fresh. The story behind the place, listed on the menu, was interesting and inspiring. They had a decent selection of local and craft beers and wines."
"Business dinner there this past week.Good, attentive service....hipster environment but not excessively go....Excellent beer menu...this is almost a given these days but they had a few that I hadn't tried or even heard of....Surly Mild and Slapshot White IPA...both good.Menu was short but a good variety....my associate had the lamb chops...excellent while I had the short ribs...a little overdone but tasty.Will be back, I hope."
"Group tried the fried cheese curds.  Just not my thing. I Had the burger... add bacon and egg.  It's a big burger. Issue i had was the ""smokey burnt"" after taste I had when I bit into it. Meat was cooked the way I like it.  Fries were decent... but garlic mayo was key.  Service was solid but we definitely had to seek out our server to get the bill paid. It's cozy and had communal tables... not sure if it's a fav in Chicago though..."
"The ingredients were fresh, the menu was simple, and the food was good. The Mac and cheese wasn't my favorite, but the burger was delicious."
"I visited farmhouse for dinner with my sister to celebrate her birthday. The food was  phenomenal . We made reservations and had to change twice because we were running late. The hostess was kind and seated immediately upon arrival we were .We didn't order app. but the Mac & Cheese ........MUST ORDER One of the best I've had.I had the chicken, my sister had the trout. our food was fresh and cook to perfection.  For desert we shared a homemade apple pie ice cream.......soooooooo goodNext visit to chi -town will  make a pit stop."
"I stopped in for dinner last week when I was in Chicago on business.  The decor is shabby chic and I really liked it...very welcoming and makes you want to stay and hang out.  The service was excellent.  I felt extremely welcome and she explained the different items on the menu to me.  I ordered a rhubarb ginger housemade soda (so unique, refreshing and delicious) and the pork chop entree with cabbage, bacon and peanuts (flavorful and really tasty)."
"Ambiance is cute and trendy, has a very west coast vibe.Mac n Cheese: really tasty and highly recommended. I love mac and cheese but usually find it not done right in restaurants. Old Grains Veggie Burger: also very delicious. Non-meat burgers can be very hit or miss but this was done well. The grains and mushrooms gave it a very unique texture.Dry Aged pasture burger: my brother got this and he wasn't impressed. Average.Service: Had a bad experience. Our waiter was inattentive and I had little luck trying to do the 'creepy stare to get his attention' for several minutes. No post food check-in, and I really needed water for most of the night. Would've given 3 stars but the food and overall restaurant was good."
"We're newly transplanted New Yorkers and have been to many 5-Star spots back east but this place is a rare find. Their drink list was unending with special local brews to satisfy any beer lover's buds. Everything is ultra, ultra fresh with salad greens just picked off the farms that day. The glazed short rib entree was finger licking awesome and trout dish was carefully crafted with slices of a root veggie, potatoes, small slices of tangerines, a tartar sauce, and fresh greens. You can taste all the layered ingredients that make it magic. We ate ourselves silly, stuffed to the gills. Service was friendly and attentive. Great bar with rockin' music. Book early for Saturday nights. Sunday nights are easy walk-ins. We'll be back soon!"
"I was very impressed with both the food and the beer selection.  In order from most awesome to least awesome (which is not to say that least is not awesome, just not as awesome as most awesome):Trout - Cooked perfectly, very few bones, interesting presentation (with head-on) and covered in delicious arugula.  Burger - Seems an odd choice, but this was a really stand-out burger.  All of the flavors combined to form a mouth-watering, juicy burger. Beer - I had a toasted hazelnut from MI which was delicious.  My friends had all kinds which were all amazing.  And the best part was that the waiter was very well-versed and once we told him what we liked and didn't like, he was excellent at determining which ones would best suit us. Cheese curds - Eh, a bit too greasy in my tastes, but still cheesy, squeaky goodness."
"Came here for a work lunch with about 7 people.  We sat upstairs - loved the atmosphere.  It's a mix of urban and country rustic. Service was kind of slow but we had planned on a leisurely lunch so it wasn't an issue.  All the food is from farm to table - which is great!  I split the chicken salad sandwich and the ribeye sandwich with a coworker - both were very interesting - but the ribeye won out. Though I'm glad I didn't get a whole ribeye sandwich to myself as I would have A) eaten the entire thing and then B) needed to nap the rest of the afternoon.  They looked like they had a great selection of regionally sourced beers and wines as well, though we didn't partake at this time.Would definitely be interested in checking this place out for dinner or drinks after work sometime."
This place is amazing. Great craft beer and liquor selection. The hamburger was the best I've ever had. Seriously.
"I like the atmosphere and service. Food was just okay on my second visit. With so many options in town, I won't be back."
"Very tasty food, a great drinks list and friendly staff. One of the best places to take out-of-town guests who don't want to get trapped in a typical tourist restaurant downtown. I prefer sitting downstairs (it can get noisy on the second floor when it's crowded)."
"I came here with some friends whilst visiting Chicago. There was a discrepancy with our reservation (it was changed the day of from 4 people to 5 people, but they didn't have a table ready for 5 when we arrived), but the employees were very accommodating and kept us updated every few minutes on the status of our table, which was appreciated. Not being a native Midwesterner, I fell in love with the fried cheese curds. We also shared the mac and cheese which was delish. I love supporting local business, and this place was perfect for doing that."
"Brunch. The happiest meal of the day - at least in my opinion. It's the one time you can have booze before noon and have both your favorite breakfast and lunch dishes wrapped into one. And Farmhouse does brunch right. I went with a few friends on a Sunday afternoon. I was surprised to see how busy it was, but relative to the size of the restaurant it made sense. I'd be shocked if there were 10 tables. Regardless, we were able to get a seat at the bar, and our waitress was kind enough to move us to a booth when one became available. As for the food and drinks - Fab. Half of us went with more breakfast type items while the other half went for lunch. Portions were not small and we all left with leftovers. I personally went for the Farm Egg Scramble. I was happy they were will to sub egg whites for me - which not all places will do.Things you don't want to miss out on...- Biscuits and Gravy - Go with the side portion, it's still more than one person needs- Beer Battered Wisconsin Cheese Curds - light, fluffy, pillowy, cheesey happiness- Short Rib Hash- Bloody Mary- The beer menu.Fresh comfort food. A beer menu for days. And cheese curds fresher than even Wisconsin can deliver. Farmhouse is the spot for brunch."
"Enjoy farmhouse. Especially the craft cocktails. Had a steak that was on special. It was good, not great. My husband felt the same. Great atmosphere and staff."
"I have walked by this place a few times and decided to finally check it out. I love the concept, and the changing menu always looks interesting.Our server, Sam, was super friendly and helpful.  We chose to sit outside and for some reason they put us right next to the other party sitting outside, despite all the other tables being open.  It was kind of annoying to be sitting practically on top of 3 very loud girls next to us.We started out with the Stick & Bindle charcuterie appetizer - some very interesting items and overall a really good start to our meal.  For entrees, we had the Amish chicken and the Trout.  The chicken came with this delicious goat cheese panzanella.  Everything was very good and very fresh tasting."
"Probably the best cheese curds I've had- really crispy, gooey and delicious. I thought their cheese platter was pretty good and their pretzel was good too as was their small side salads.Be warned- their kitchen closes at 10pm. I do not know why when the restaurant closes a lot later. They should change this because if you're coming here to drink it's always good to have something to snack on at the same time!!!"
"Had Brunch and Dinner there in the same week. Awesome place, great food in a laied back atmosphere!"
"A total win! A great craft beer menu and tasty bar food. I've been a couple times and the service was just ok though. One of the servers became visibly frustrated when we had a large group who was placing orders and closing their tabs at different times. It's happy hour homie. Try the cheese curds, omg."
"We found Farmhouse on Yelp and were not disappointed. The menu is not extensive but the food was consistently delicious. We had drinks, a speciality cocktail and a  California chardonnay (I know...they have craft BEER)  and shared Stick & Bindle. Delicious array of cheese, meat, picked veggies and bread. Daughter opted for Fish and Chips which were lightly breaded and tasty. I had the Brook Trout. We both really enjoyed the meal as well as the atmosphere. Price was reasonable for what we had and we would return."
"My friend and I came here for dinner on Friday evening...We made reservations, but ended up showing up 30 minutes early..and they still seated us immediately..yay!FoodBeer Battered Wisconsin Cheese Curds ($9) - ""First Havest section of the menu,"" they were tasty and perfectly cooked, but a little too salty to eat alone.  Most cheese curds are salty though...Bone-In Ribeye ($32) - ""Main Harvest section of the menu,"" cooked to your preference, ingredients consist of roasted pearl onions, sherry wine reduction, swiss tuile..according to my friend.. it was tasty, but a bit difficult to eat due to the bone & the knife not cutting the meat to well...and since it was soo dark.. she couldn't really see what she was eating...Pan Seared Catfish ($22) - ""Main Harvest section of the menu,"" ingredients consist of white bean puree, sweet corn succotash, andouille sausage, and mini croutons..tastes delicious..the ingredients went well with the catfish..Brussel Sprouts ($5) - side dish, enough to share 1 side dish with another person..or if you want to order 2 side dishes and share amongst 2 ppl, but the entree alone was enough food for me..my friend who really enjoys brussel sprouts didn't enjoy this as much..she said it was a little off..Atmosphere: a lighting is a little too dim..maybe great for a date night..or if you are the type that gets really red when you drink or when you blush on dates ..and want to cover up that redness...the seating a little tight so you might be able to hear the conversation of the person next to you...Random --I thought the menus and checks were unique & cute! I would come here again to try drinks or another entree from the ""Main Harvest"" of the menu... :)"
"Cheese curds & beef jerky, not to mention not only a great beer selection, but a SPECIFIC beer selection. I've found some of the rarest of rare beers here......and they even save some of the better ones long after they were gone from every other bar.Most of the meat & cheeses are 'local' (meaning from Wisconsin), and although the place is a bit upscale, there is no pretentiousness from the wait staff.It is expensive, so I have limited myself to the apps and great beers so far - maybe I will treat myself to something more exotic in the future - I will return."
"OMG, I so glad I didn't make my decision based on the bad reviews I read about this place because there re some people you can't make happy no matter what. This place is GREAT. I had the rainbow trout, it was flavorful throughout the flesh, I even made a wish LOL. That glazed cider carrot was wow. I love this place."
"I've been searching high and low for fried cheese curds in Northern Cali, and with the exception of a local farmers' market and state fair, I've come up empty handed. These delectable morsels of salty goodness are definitely a Midwestern specialty -- specifically, Farmhouse's specialty. Suffice to say, no future trip to the Windy City will be complete without a plate of pippin' hot beer-battered cheese curds offset by Farmhouse's cool, rustic vibe.Note: You can only order off the limited menu during certain hours of the day (something like 3-5PM, don't quote me on that). Cheese curds are definitely part of that menu!!"
"We were walking by and thought we'd check out the place. The hostess was rude when we said we didn't have a reservation. Geesh!She has an aristocratic flair about her. If I'd known I would have worn a tuxedo or donned my hipster clothing. Once it's got busy we did not see our waiter. My hormone/antibiotic free burger was super salty. Sans the hormones in the food, I still had a restrictive blood vessel response. Beer was $7. Too expensive for local beer. How do you justify the extra expense?"
"Good food, good vibe, good service! I'm visiting from New York but if not I would be a  familiar face at this establishment!"
"The food here is pretty much incredible. I ordered the pork and every bite melted into my mouth. My girlfriend in usual fashion ordered the chicken and allowed me to try a piece..I wound up devouring her left overs.  We also got a couple drinks and they were equally as appetizing. The decor was very nice and features two floors. There's not really a lot to add aside from mentioning that the place is a little pricey but considering it's in the loop I guess thats standard fare.  I wound up spending around 80 dollars for two people minus gratuity. If I had a date I wanted to impress I would certainly recommend this place. If I'm a little short on cash, I would begrudgingly pass. Bottom Line: Great Food, Good decor, High Prices (But worth it)"
"Before you even walk in, the pitchfork front door gets you excited. The restaurant is a great space and inviting to patrons. The staff was very helpful and helps you find the dish that best suits your mood. The food speaks for itself. You won't be disappointed by anything and I want to keep coming back to try everything. I am thrilled I found this place!"
"Very nice ambience. Went around 5pm so the building was not too busy and it was quieter. Very friendly staff served us. If your not going here to drink craft brews or local wines then you might want to go someplace else. They take real pride in their drinks, so if you are going just to eat you might feel like your disappointing them. Burger I had was nice and thick but felt a bit overpriced at $14."
"Lively ambiance, food is good and they have some interesting house of recipes. I would like to visit again."
"Having just opened in 2011, this restaurant has some really great perks:1. 80% of the restaurant is made of salvaged materials in the Chicago area.  Make sure to take a look at their beer fridge from the 1930s behind the bar--really cool!2. They have 28 craft beers made locally (Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan)3. One of the owners just bought a farm in Wisconsin and the apple orchard he has there produces wonderfully scrumptious apples!4. The wait staff is EXCELLENT (I normally don't comment on the service so it must be good if I do). We had Mary and she knew everything about every single beer and hard liquor, every dish, the meat, the décor, EVERYTHING.5. They have their own pastry chef so everything is made fresh in house daily.  6. If you have people who are hard of hearing, ask for a table upstairs.  Drinks-5 Rabbit 5 Lizard (Latin-style Witbier brewed with spices and passion fruit): Mmm just the smell is heavenly. You can really smell the passion fruit.  As for the taste, mmmm it's an extremely refreshing wheat beer with wonderful fizz--a good mix of bitter and slight tartness from the fruit.  Starters-Cheese Curds: I can't remember ever having cheese curds so I wouldn't know what to compare them to (except for mozzarella sticks), however, they were perfectly flaky (lightly breaded) delicious cheese balls. The cheese was very rich and creamy.  I thought it mixed well with the ranch and not the BBQ sauce, yet Mother thought the exact opposite--so you decide. Worth trying?  Sure.  Worth getting again.  No thanks.Entrees-Grilled Ivory Char (red bell pepper romesco, haricot vert, toasted pepitas): the large piece of char (cooked perfectly) falls of the ""bone"" and mixes very well with the romesco which just gives it a sharp tomato/red pepper hint.  The beans are perfectly slathered in what I think is meat fat because they are some of the most delicious beans I've ever had.  And those pepitas were the perfect touch. -Fish and Chips (beer battered yellow perch, mustard seed gastrique, tartar sauce, tavern cut fries): these are very well cooked and battered.  The light battering made for a very flaky dough that just mixed so well with the flavorful fish.  And the mini fries were plentiful and cooked well.  -Farmhouse ""Classic"" Pasture Raised Burger (tavern cut fries, grilled challah bun): Woah!  If you like a traditional burger (like Dad does), beware!  This thick piece of meat is seasoned and marinated like a steak (so it's got a lot of added flavor).  It's delicious, but different.  And the ketchup is a BBQ ketchup.  Lastly, the Challah is very think and flaky.  Very nice. Desserts-Chocolate PB Torte (with caramel ice cream, nuts & caramel drizzle): interesting. It's like chocolate fudge with a hint of peanut butter (I would have preferred a stronger PB taste). It's deliciously rich and the thin crunch crust (made of nuts and graham crackers I presume) is nice.  The caramel sauce is not sweetened very much so you really have a pure, strong caramel that mixes beautifully with the glazed nuts that add a great crunch.  The caramel ice cream is just an ice cream version of the sauce--extremely flavorful. -Apple Crisp (oatmeal sherbert): cut up some apples, nuts, mix in a little brown sugar and voila.  There's no dough (hey! It's a lite version) and it's absolutely delicious (not overly sweet or anything).  The oatmeal sherbet has a slight hint of oatmeal that you can barely taste, but it adds a nice chalkiness to the crumble.  Even though I'm a PB girl, this would be my go-to dessert here. FINAL VERDICT: I LOVED IT.  From my drinks to my main meal to dessert to the décor to the wait staff.  It was just a nice atmosphere and a good way to support local business.  I'd like to try brunch and lunch."
"Ordered the cheese curds to start. These large gobs of beer battered curd were fantastic, though they did not squeak like mice... Came with a homemade ketchup and spicy dip. The ketchup was alright, but I was a fan of the spicy dip. Main dish ordered the burger, of course with an egg on top! This was alright overall with all the cheese and bacon, but seemed a little dry. As far as burgers in Chicago go, I wouldn't go back for it. Also sampled a chunk of the trout, which lives up to its reputation. Tender, juicy, cooked perfectly."
"This was our 3rd time here for brunch. I wish I could give it 5 stars. I would have given 10 stars if I had written a review for our first visit. Today, I ordered the eggs Benedict & my husband ordered the hash. He loved the hash. The potatoes that came with the eggs Benedict were perfect. Eggs Benedict was ok. They usually have a special cocktail but nothing new today, so I was disappointed with that. The atmosphere is nice but cramped. You are on top of your neighbor making it hard to not listen to their conversation. Service today was not good at all. It's a shame because the service is usually good."
"A nice little bar with a good selection if craft brews on tap. The food, however, wasn't great. We tried the fish fry (the mustard was the best part), burger and charcuterie plate, none of it would be worth going back for. The fried cheese curds were good though."
"I've been wanting to go to this place for a long time, and it surpassed my expectations. The decor is adorable and the inside was a lot classier than I thought it would be. I went with a few other people and we got the cheese curds and the macaroni and cheese for the table to share. If you love cheese, this place is a cheese lover's paradise. There is also a huge selection of wine and craft beers. I can't wait to come back again!"
This place is great. I haven't tried a lot of the food but the cheese plate is really good. Extensive beer list.
"A bit pricey for what it is but not shocking considering where it is in River West. Great bartenders, excellent beer list, nice ambiance and awesome fries."
"Did brunch here today. Menu was great with a lot of great options. The cheese curds are a must. I had the burger and it was good, not great (fries were great though!). My friend had the quiche and it was great!Hostess was rude and unfriendly. That earns this place 4 (not 4.5) stars #byefelicia"
We were first to arrive on a Monday.  We wanted their famous brunch but during the week it's the lunch menu. It was quiet but the staff were ready to go.  The place is eclectic and warm almost like a hipster cottage.  The service was prompt and immediately we got our drinks.  Mine was the Bloody Mary with beer side chaser.  It was without a doubt both delicious and very spicy.  We had the ham and Swiss on rye and the pork belly sandwiches.  They were both exquisite.  You know what Farmhouse? Were coming back!!!
"My wife and I came here for a late dinner last night.  The weather was great, so we opted to sit outside.  The seating area was nice aside from the bus stop being right next to it, so we were occasionally greeted by some bus fumes (no fault of the restaurant).  We started off with the cheese curds, which were fluffy, light, and delicious (if there are more than two of you, you'll need multiple orders).  They came with two sauces: a homemade ketchup that was a bit smokier than the traditional variety and some sort of aioli that had a little kick to it.  I didn't love the ketchup, but the aioli was delicious.  My wife went with the chop salad and chicken soup, which she thoroughly enjoyed.  The salad had a lot of great, unique flavors in it, like dried cherries.  We also shared a side of Mac and Cheese, which was some of the best we've had in the city.  The cheese combo was great, and it had just the right amount of creaminess while the top was perfectly crisp.  I went with the burger and added cheddar, pickles, and fresno chiles.  The meat and challah bun were both spot on, and the chiles added a unique flair.  The pickles were  a bit too sweet for my liking, but I took them off and still ended up with one of the best burgers I've had in a while.  The fries were freshly cut very thin, and they were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  While I love many different varieties of fries, I thought they were pretty much perfect for this style.  They had a great beer and wine selection featuring a lot of local options, and the service was great.  It was clear that the staff was passionate about the restaurant and its food.  We will be back soon!"
"We had dinner recently, and the food and service were very good.  I'm not a cheese curd fan and didn't think much of them, but I've never had a deep fried cheese curd that I liked.  Allie, our server, recommended the pork & peas appetizer which everyone loved.  The entrees we shared included the pork tenderloin, chicken and lamb.  The favorites were the pork and the chicken.  Both were very flavorful and tender.  I loved my Nordic Campfire cocktail.  I'd describe it as herbal and not the least bit sweet.  My friend loved The Closer which was good and on the sweeter side."
Disappointed brunch. Burger and fries was super salty. Orange juice was not fresh. Short rib hash carrot was undercooked. Flavor was wired.
"Come for the cheese curds. Stay for the cheese curds.Farmhouse landed on the lunch rotation list for our weekly Thursday team lunch, and I'd heard enough good things about it to be willing to give it a shot. I'm glad I did.The three of us split two orders of cheese curds. They are something of a miracle; instead of being dense and chewy like the curds I'm used to, these curds were light. The deep fry set the batter almost instantly, while the cheese melted away on the inside. So it's almost like deep-fried air, with a thin coating of cheddar on the inside of the deep fried batter. Amazing.There were two sauces that came with the curds; the ""ketchup"" is ketchup, I suppose, but with a healthy dose of hickory smoke. Maybe it's a BBQ sauce/ketchup hybrid. The other was a good, creamy whole grain mustard sauce.After that, one would think the schnitzel sandwich I had would be a letdown, but fortunately it wasn't. The pork with hammered thin and fried perfectly. I had it with a soft goat cheese, and the combination of flavors (cheese, pork, arugula, raspberry vinaigrette) was just fantastic. The crispy, thin chips were fried perfectly and salted well.The decor is best described as ""old world novelty"", with a healthy dose of farm implements and pretty cool glasses made from the bottoms of wine bottles. There's also candles *everywhere*, so I was curious if the place had almost burned down yet.I hope it doesn't, because Farmhouse has great food and is worth the splurge. I'd love to come back for more!"
Our service was great and the food was also very good. The fried chicken biscuit was probably the best thing on the brunch menu.
"I really really wanted to like this place. I originally had dinner here (burger, beer, and curds) and it was pretty alright, but $30 left a little something to be desired as I can find better burgers and beer elsewhere. The Cheese Curds were pretty dank, but not enough to be redeeming. I then gave it a second chance for brunch yesterday, and after a small mimosa, eggs, toast, potatoes, and bacon, I was still pretty underwhelmed for how much I was paying. It's understandable that the farm to fork concept costs a little more to provide, but it should also translate to better food, which it did not."
Friday afternoon came in for lunch. I tried your braised rabbit sandwich. Excellent. The gravy and slaw complimented each other perfectly. Always a pleasure.
"When we get a chance to try a farm-to-table restaurant, we do.  Farmhouse did not disappoint. The food was delicious. The portions were plentiful.I had the brunch hash. It was outstanding! The quiche was as big as a slice do NY cheesecake.I would definitely return for the lunch or dinner menu."
"Take your girlfriend, boyfriend, best friend, or anyone else you have in mind here! Ambience: Dimly lit, complemented well with lights and cutesy decor on the ceiling. There are two levels to the restaurant and somehow, the narrow restaurant just seems to fit together very well with a combination of booth sitting and long table community style dining. Food: I came here for a late Valentine's Day dinner and my boyfriend and I ordered cheese curds and chicken soup for appetizers (YUM). Amish chicken and the pork shank for our entrees. Both were soooo delicious! And for dessert we finished with a unique sweet potato cake with bacon crumble and blood orange sorbet. This was one of the best meals I have had in a long long time. Drinks: Seriously. They have an extensive alcohol beverage menu. We ordered two cocktails (gin-based) and a mead. My boyfriend was obsessed over his discovery of the mead. All three drinks were satisfying my taste buds.Service: Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly. We had complimentary house made truffles and I received a pink tulip in celebration of Valentine's Day. I couldn't be more happy with the customer service. OH and how awesome is that they also take reservations! Bottom line: You need to check out this restaurant and have a few drinks paired with some amazing food. I promise you won't be disappointed."
"This was my first stop on my food tour and it set the bar very high for one simple reason.My mouth is watering just thinking about those Beer Battered Wisconsin Cheese Curds. They are fan-freaking-tastic! LOVED them. Such a delightful little snack.The service, the decor, and everything about this place was on point.I'm coming back for more of those Cheese Curds!!!"
"Excellent food. I was with a group of 7 and everyone raved about their dishes. My mother-in-law got the cinnamon roll, which was fantastic (and I don't even like cinnamon rolls typically). The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I called on a Friday night for last minute reservations for Saturday brunch with no issues."
"Made a reservation for two based on other yelp reviews. The restaurant seemed fairly open when we arrived, so I was surprised by the extremely slow service. The menu brought together the best American foods from locally sourced farms and breweries. We tried the beer batter cheese curds, which were good, but nothing spectacular. A few of the items on the menu weren't available, so we ended up settling for a salad and a soup. The menu seems to be fancier on paper than actual presentation or quality of food. The menu is quite limited with only a handful of entrées. Check this place out if you are interested in local beers and apps, but skip on dinner!"
"Farmhouse is a fun 4-star restaurant with a local farm theme. The atmosphere is nice and light. We saw one of the servers taking a pig's head with an apple in it to a party table. (snort) I didn't see if it was just a garnish or if they actually ate it.The food is fantastic, and of course, their beer list is a multi-volume screed. I had the trout (our waitress warned me that a fishhead was coming if I didn't ask for pre-decapitation... phew, thanks) and Kim39 had the filet. YUM. And YUM! It was a pretty young crowd on a Sat night, we furtively noticed. More fun... on the back of some of the server t-shirts: EIEIO. Get it? Cha!The politically-correct local/green/sustainable/social blather is there, but it's not in your face. They're cool. Farmhouse has a very positive vibe.moo... yow, bill"
Burger bun is burnt and the fries are the bottom of the barrel and all stuck together. Still love this place and ranked #1 for me in Chicago. Just not up to the usual standards tonight.
Not even my mother can make a better grilled cheese sandwich .. Shhh don't tell her :)
"I'm a vegetarian who has had more than enough veggie burgers and normally I shy away from them but this one was honestly one of the best I've ever had!  Also, the house-made pickles and bbq sauce were divine!  Additionally, the rest of people I was dining with were all meat-eaters and they all raved about their food including the pork belly, short ribs, regular burger, mac 'n cheese and cauliflower.  Great restaurant!  I'll definitely return!"
"The good was delicious and the pink mimosas were great! Our waitress was very friendly and the service was awesome. The Chef, Ali, even came out to see how everything tasted! I'll definitely be back. Also, aside from great food, the decor is so cute. I felt like I wasn't even in the city. A great little escape with great food!"
"I was going to be in Chicago for the afternoon and Farmhouse was recommended to me by a friend.  After looking at their yelp reviews I made reservations.  The morning of dinner I received a phone call from the restaurant confirming my reservation and time.  I was glad to know they were planning on me and happy I didn't have to call them to confirm.Once we got there we were immediately seated at our table.  No waiting around.  The atmosphere is very nice.  Higher end eclectic and very comfortable.  Our server introduced himself, told us about the restaurant and their ties to local farmers and answered any questions we had.  He knew the drink list and menu very well.  We got pasta and trout and both meals were excellent!  We never felt rushed or bothered and had plenty of time to enjoy our time, drinks and meal.When our bill was brought to us, instead of the typical black fake leather folder, it was in an old meat market pamphlet from the 30's.  Very cool and it added to the atmosphere and authenticity of the restaurant.I definitly recommend this restaurant and will be going back in the future."
"Death's Tar is delicious if you're a dark beer fan.The staff is extremely friendly and refreshingly honest ;DDefinitely a great place to chillax, drink and/or/both eat cause the food is really good too.  Will be back when I visit my buddy who lives across the street or when I'm in the city.  Highly recommend the place!"
"Went here for my friend's birthday and was worth it. Went cheesy with the Beer Buttered Wisconsin Cheese Curds and the Baked Mac and Cheese, both of which were very rich. Half-chicken was alright, but the accompanying rice made up for it. Service was sub-par."
"Canceling reservation because we were there 10 min early and the lady at the door told us to have a seat and ""chill"" but the guy behind the bar was arguing with his own staff and telling us we couldn't be there for 10 minGet your staff together and ""get over yourself"". We won't be claiming our reservation in 8 minRude and unprofessional .., who cares if your food might have been good."
"Kid friendly, delicious Bloody Mary's, loved the use of salvaged materials in the decor!"
"Two stars may be harsh, but if three is considered average, I would say Farmhouse had the strong potential to deliver above average but just didn't quite do it for me. Menu was awesome, ambiance too. We got a last minute reservation on a Thursday night and they made it pretty clear they were busy. The waitor was short and frequently came by to try and rush us along and turn over our table. I ordered the Gnudi and have to say it was pretty salty and ""over-dressed"" to the point where the gnudi itself was lost. I was surprised given the positive reviews on yelp, but nonetheless it wasn't terrible, perhaps my high expectations were just too high."
Awesome spot but wanted to give a shoutout for excellent service.  Had a celebratory dinner last Friday night with a large group.  Forgot to mention that we had an infant in the party when I made the reservation.  The staff was super helpful and came up with a high chair configuration to work with the high top table we were seated at. Our server was super patient with the group.  Definitely recommend for anything from big group dinners to date night!
"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFULIt may have been the hangover, it may have been the fact that I was starving prior to going, but for some reason I believed this to be one of the best brunch meals that I have ever eaten. Farmhouse has all the fixins to be a warm, friendly, cute restaurant in the South, but its smack dab in the heart of Chicago which brought me home once I arrived. The wooden tables, the old yet modern country like decor and the country style menu all brought back my KY hometown memories. I had the eggs benedict and they were fantastic! yokes runny, biscuits were warm and fluffy and country ham cooked perfectly! The spicy red potatoes were out of this world...just all around delish! The service was nice and friendly. The food was great. not much I could say was a true negative other than there COULD have been more ham on top and maybe a few more potatoes....only because the food was a tad pricey and a lttle more food to feed a hungry hungover guy would have been respected a little more than what was served and for the prices...but other than that....AMAZING!"
Great food! Everything tasted homemade. Definitely recommend the braised short rib and Amish chicken. If in the mood for dessert bread pudding is a must!
"I keep wanting to go back! Good for lunch and dinner, with good local beer selection and an interesting menu of quality but not too fancy or expensive food. Always at least a few vegetarian options. I love the risotto and of course order the cheese curds to start. The servers are friendly and I love how it looks and feels inside. Rustic yet clean and comfortable. It's not huge and can get crowded at peak times, so make a reservation in advance if you can."
"My fiancee and I are regulars at this restaurant- the food just couldn't be better. The ingredients are fresh, the servers and waiters are knowledgeable and really care about your experience there. The drink menu is unique (I love the Swing) and their wine & beer selection is fantastic. They switch up their menu often so even if you go every few weeks (like we do) you are always in for a new treat (thank goodness they keep some staples like the Wisconsin cheese curds). I've brought my parents, my fiancee's parents, and many friends here and they have all loved the experience. Try it.. you won't be disappointed."
"Don't come here to have a meaningful heart-to-heart with your dining companions.  Farmhouse is crazy loud.  The acoustics are weird too. I could hear every single word the girl 2 seats over and across the table was saying (in fact, it was more like yelling), which was both disruptive and obnoxious.Do come here to check out the beer and food.  We kicked off our meal with an order of cheese curds, which were so-so.  Batter was not as crispy and crunchy as we would have liked.  Both of us ordered the burger and fries.  Needless to say, I inhaled both shamelessly and proceeded to roll out of the joint."
"Biscuit was delicious!!  Spicy potatoes were too much for husband. He wouldn't order them again but they come with all the egg dishes so you're forced to take them if you want potatoes. I went out on a limb at the recommendation of the waitress who described my dish as ""interesting"" and she was right. I had the ham hock & farina with peas and a sunny side up egg.  I actually liked it.  I'm sorry i didn't take a pic before I ate it. Initially  it seemed like a small portion but it was quite enough. I should have asked how the egg was prepared since I hate slim. If it had been cooked a little longer I would have enjoyed it more. If you're feeling adventurous and like farina (a smoother cousin to grits) try it. If you're  not have the farmers breakfast. You can't go wrong with their scrambled eggs. They're the best.  P.s. lunch menu is only available weekdays so don't go there hoping to get it outside of those times. Dinner menu starts at 4:00pm."
"I had mixed feelings towards this place. I don't even want to write a review for this place, I just feel everything was okay, not bad not great. I am starting to get yelpers writing block. The cheese curds were good, again not bad but not great. I ordered the fish, it was good. Not a lot of food but it was good. The fish came with mushrooms and something else, I didn't want the mushrooms. I really confused the girl when I asked to substitute. It was an ordeal, which saw me get kicked under the table by the girlfriend when I was rolling my eyes at the waitress. So un inspired at the restaurant so uninspired to write this review. I didn't order any of their drinks, some of them looked good. I probably wont be back."
"Deep fried cheese curds. Must-get app. They even added green food colouring in honours of St. Patty's weekend.Had a schnitzel as an entree that was quite dry though. Ambience was dimly-lit and hipster, but a nice place overall."
"This place was great.  Every dish on their menu is executed well.   It is nothing surprising here, for the true foodies at heart, however the quality and technique of food and its preparation is on point for the prices that come with it.Cheese curds were killer with a tall beer here.The grilled ceasar salad w/egg was really good.  The burger looked crazy and the fish special was also good.Our server was really nice.  Towards the end of the meal she seemed to keep disapearing at key moments when we needed her....It was a slightly loud in here but our table was nestled in a way that we could carry on a conversation still.I love supporting people and places who take seriously good food, where it comes from, and compassionate service to customers and what they serve.  Farmhouse rocked it!"
"I always want to check out the place as we past by so many times.  I was attracted by its decor and farm to table concept.   Then we decided to go there.Time:  around 11 am (an hour after it opens for business)Day:    Saturday people:  Just 2 of us - me and my daughter - 12 yearsLet starts with the positives:1) The food is attractive.  The quality of ingredients is good and  fresh.  I had a Porchetta Croissant Sandwich which I think the ingredients are fresh.  It is a bit too sweet for my taste.  Our waitress did want me that.  I wish the croissant was a warm up.  My coffee is ok.  The side potato was delicious.  My daughter like her breakfast flatbread and her cream soda.  The portion is not bad.  2) the decor and atmosphere is very nice.   It is very rustic and meet the theme.That is all the pros, now the cons:Food1) I did mention it is fresh.  But the marriage of the taste is ok.  I did have better and more memorable food.2) Price is a bit high with the taste but it is in an expensive location.  Our brunch is $35 before tips and tax.  If the service is better, I may not mind that much.  Service is not that attentive:Hostess -  1) when we walk in, the hostess asked us whether we had a reservation (similar to other review).  So it did not bother me.  But she took us to the second floor which I felt awe, as there were only couple tables seated on the ground floor.  2) When we were seated on the second floor, she led us to the table with a very narrow bench while there were tons of empty tables. Even my petty side 12 years old cannot sat comfortably there.  We then asked the waitress that we want to seat somewhere else.  Her service..... Waitress:1) She just said ""yes you can move"" in cold voice from far away.  No offer of moving the water or menu. 2) There was no explanation or introduction about the restaurant non the food until we asked after sitting for awhile.3) When I was tried to get her attention, she was chatting with the hostess or eating or folding napkins.  No offer of ketch up when our food was brought to us which including side potato.  No checking on how we were doing.  I could use a refill of water or ask to have another cup of coffee.  (There was only us on the second floor after one table left right after we were seated. And another table of 4 comes in after we ordered and then couple more tables later when we almost ready to leave).  On the plus side, with not attentive services, it did allow us to seat there longer."
Have gone here multiple times since the first review and it never disappoints. The beer selection is outstanding. He almost chicken favorite always tender moist and flavorful. The staff was attentive and educational. Don't miss this little haven of farm to table food!
"Amazing burger, cute atmosphere and nice location walking distance off Michigan. Translation: not bombarded with tourists."
"Yum!! Love this place. So cute and delicious! Minus one star for bad service.Food was great, small portion for the price though. I had the short ribs and my friend had the Amish chicken. Ribs were tender and delicious"
3.5 rounded up because of the conceptmy wife didn't really like itthe cheese curds were great as was the pork chop and steakthe mashed potatoes were quite earthy i;d go back w friends but not my wife
"We had a great time.  We started with the cheese curds that everyone seems to be talking about and we weren't disappointed.  The burgers that we got were cooked perfectly to order, and they refilled our water routinely before we asked.  Our waitress was attentive and charismatic and made the meal even more enjoyable.  The decor and arrangement is a little unconventional for my taste, but the food is what matters to me, and they deliver."
"We've been here quite a few times now and I can honestly say it's one of my favorite places in the city. We're big fans of sitting at the bar and have always found the bartenders to be overwhelmingly friendly and willing to share information/samples about the beer and liquor that they have available.This place feels like home. A place that you want to bring your friends or family. Great food, great service, great experience. Also, let's not forget about the beef jerky. It's AMAZING."
"I went here last weekend for a girl friend's birthday brunch and was impressed with Farmhouse. The restaurant is really cute, with farm animal pictures on the windows and a very ""rustic chic"" feel inside. We ate upstairs, near the bar on cool repurposed table and chairs. Our server told us that everything in the restaurant has somehow been repurposed, and looking around you can see all the creative ""up-cycling"" that has occurred. Our server was really sweet and helped us choose two killer breakfasts. I got the farmer's breakfast-scrambled eggs with onions and fresh herbs, served with breakfast potatoes and toast with sweet butter. It was so tasty and was made even better by the extremely spicy hot sauce! I wish I remembered what brand it was, I absolutely loved it. My friend got the breakfast flatbread-just what it sounds like, a flatbread topped with sausage, egg, cheese, and herbs. Everything was so fresh and just bursting with flavor. I loved that I wasn't over-stuffed-the portions were healthy but not overly large. Although I didn't get one, my friend said the bloody Mary was excellent, and she loved the beef jerky stirrer stick. I had a cappuccino and loved it. The only reason I am giving Farmhouse four stars is that our food took close to 35 minutes. I didn't have anywhere to be but I did look around and it was happening to everyone. The food was certainly worth the wait, and the time lag didn't impede too much on my experience, I will certainly be back!"
"Food would be great in a small city, alot of work went into it and its interesting but not worth another trip. I had grilled romaine salad with pork belly, mac n cheese, and fries.  Will not order either again, the salad egg yolk vinnegrette was supposed to be the highlight (reinforced by two of the staff at seperate times commenting that the sauce was out of this world) interesting but not delicious or out of this world by far. I sat at the bar, the bartender who served me was nice enough but answerd my question about what kind of wine the farmhouse red was with empty eyes and the stupidest thing ive ever heard "" its draft wine"" ok so first the menu clearly states this is a draft wine second if you dont know please offer a sample or ask someone else. He provided pretty subpar swrvice but the other bartender cleared my plates dropped of and returned check and checked on me frequently so all is not lost. Overall i would recommend this place for a drink and a light snack the ambience is great laid back but appropriate for a date. Other than that go back a page and find another place to dine."
"The website is somewhat deceiving as it looks like somewhere you'd love to go. However, like the rooms on hotel sites, it sort of looks like the photos on the website but not exactly! Menus is small; lots of fried food and heavy menu items. Had the green salad; it was ok but dressing too generous and that made it soggy. Waitress was not especially interested in our needs despite that it was pretty dead. In Chicago, you can expect that people will like ketchup with their fries but when I asked it took her 15 minutes to bring it. (the menu says the ketchup is house-made so maybe she needed to squeeze some tomatoes).As a 100K diner on Open Table take my advice and pass.."
"Like Uncommon Ground, the only other self-described farm-to-table restaurant in Chicago where I have eaten, this was a disappointing experience, though not as much as UG.I liked that Farmhouse is located farther west than many establishments in this area of town, so it wasn't noisy, crowded, etc. Yet my dining companion and I were sat right next to a group of three. Several other tables of many sizes were available. But we were told we had to sit in this spot because the two two-tops next to us were to be smushed together and were reserved for a larger party. (The same hostess, who without mincing words was a bitch, made sure to place menus on at those seats to convince us that yes, they really were reserved!) Fine. But why not the two-top in the next booth? Or the other? Or the other? Or why not sit the reserved party in the open 4-top on the other side of the room next to no one else? I don't know the answers to these questions, but that I was thinking them gave the meal a poor start. (And made me briefly debate trying an alcoholic beverage, but the price was not right.)Our server luckily was very effervescent and pleasant. We started things off with the french press for 2, which ended up being weak and bland. Maybe I'm to blame for that for not allowing the coffee to steep long enough, but it had been at least 5 minutes. So maybe I'm not to blame.The food was mixed; I tried the Veggie burger, made with ""Old World"" grains (predominately quinoa) and layered with tomato, onion, roasted poblano pepper, ""forest"" mushrooms, and roasted garlic mayo. I also added a fried egg to make the dish more ""brunch"" and less ""lunch."" The burger/sandwich was quite messy (extra because of the egg) but super tasty. So many layers of flavors that all complemented each other nicely. The patty was crispy and hot, the mayo was great and tangy, and the pepper and mushrooms added woodsy notes that I had forgotten about until I found them beneath the pattie. The toasted bun completed the positive notes from the burger. The accompanying fries, however, were less pleasant. I liked that they are fresh cut, but they were either fried too long or the potato was old because they were hard, and not extra-crispy crunchy hard but difficult and near-painful to eat hard. The housemade ketchup for dipping was as good as the burger, if only the medium for the ketchup was edible. My companion tried the corncakes, which were closer to flapjacks than southern herbs-and-corn savory style, but still good. The carrots and sauces on top also were pleasant, but on the sweeter side.No desserts, no extra sides, no drinks, nothing else special on this visit. I would guess they have good biscuits, but I could be wrong. Biscuits are easier to screw up than fries, and they botched those.I really like that they source local and throughout the midwest; I have a lot of midwest pride, and the abundance of MI, IN, and WI sources, drinks, and specialties pleased me. I also liked the ambiance; the tones were soft, the brick interior felt ""farmy,"" and the music really fit the mood and was the perfect volume, that is it actually served as background music and did not make conversation difficult. But the execution of some of the food, and the really frustrating seating arrangement--the first impression of the restaurant--strained our enjoyment of the dining experience. I may try Farmhouse again; the food was decent overall. But decent doesn't buy a great review or an ""I can't wait"" return trip.Oh, and that larger party to be sat next to us? The arrived just as we received our bill. And every other seat still was available. Thank goodness we didn't take their seats that they actually didn't need to reserve at all. Maybe instead of trying these urban ""farm-to-table"" places, I should just go to a farm."
"Had the grilled cheese and tomato soup for lunch. Also tried the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich. All fantastic. It puts you in a bit of a food coma before returning to work, but totally worth it. Love the atmosphere, too."
"Very cute place. Nice ambiance. Waiter was very friendly. Hostess had a bad attitude, very unfriendly,  seem like she did not want to be there, did not greet, and made no eye contact. Food seem fresh but lacked flavor for the most part. Portions seemed on the small side for the american standard but satisfying. The $6 latte that was the size of an espresso was very dissatisfying. In a city with so many good option I don't think I need to go back."
"This is another place that I really want to give that extra half star.  Farmhouse is 3.5 stars.   I was the first to arrive for dinner on a weeknight.  There is no good place to wait at the front and be out of the way and I wouldn't have enough time to get a drink at the bar.  Given that there were tables and it was not busy, I asked the hostess to be seated.  She gave me a hard time at first which was annoying given the number of empty tables.  However, she obliged and I was seated.  Our waiter was nice and knowledgeable.  However, I got the ""upselling"" vibe which I hate. I ordered a local cider to start, which was great.  They really do support the local and Midwest farmers and businesses which is really nice to support.  The food was not earth shattering, but it was solid.  We split the cheese curds and the mussels.  The homemade ketchup to the cheese curds was delicious and the curds were nicely done. I preferred the mussels.  They were cooked perfectly and in a nice white wine broth with some tomatoes.  For the entree, my friend ordered the burger.  Since the talking subsided while we ate, I think she really liked hers.  After asking the waiter for a recommendation between two dishes, I went with the fish.  It was cooked perfectly, but was underseasoned.  I also thought that the portion was a bit small for the price.  Overall I was not blown away, but it was pretty good.  I definitely would give them another chance and believe it is a good spot for locally sourced food and drinks."
"I took a trip to Chicago and had a big list of food to try (this is Yelp after all). Definitely not on my list was Farmhouse, a place near the train on the way to some other nighttime activity. Boy am I glad we chose it, as Farmhouse was the best restaurant of my trip.The service was friendly and knowledgeable, and they made us feel right at home. I appreciated their dedication to small business and local ingredients. Everything we got was delicious (one person loved the mashed potatoes so much she ordered a second one), and I can't stop thinking about the duck breast dish. Have you ever eaten something that was so good it crept into your subconscious? Like you wake up in the morning, hazily wander into the shower, and suddenly remember how delicious something was? The duck breast here is a shower dish. This trip was a month ago and I still randomly think, ""MAN that duck was amazing."" Put it up head to head with Girl & the Goat. I think you'll be surprised how well this place stands up; personally I liked Farmhouse better and it was not close. They even have a pig ear appetizer that is better than the famous G&tG pig face. I wish there was an exact replica close to home that I could eat at all the time featuring my area's food. From the service and vibe to the depth and breath of flavors, it was everything I was expecting G&tG to be and was disappointed it wasn't. In the conversation for one of the best meals I've had this year."
Nice place for drinks but otherwise too limited a menu. Another moderately priced item would be nice - only option is the burger. Brunch menu is equally lacking and portions are small. It does have a fun decor and the cheese curds are a great appetizer.
"I really wanted to like this place but there was nothing special at all about my experience.I came in with a friend Saturday around 1 pm. FYI they do not serve their lunch menu on the weekends, only the brunch menu. I think they should state that on their menus online so people are aware.I ordered the hoe cakes and my friend the eggs Benedict . It took about 25 minutes for our order to arrive. My friend said her food was cold. The hoe cakes were overly sweet and just nothing special at all. You get 3 measly pancakes with a blueberry sauce and glazed carrots on the side. I didn't like the carrots I felt they could have been cooked a little longer. My friends plate was extremely small as well.Just a very ""blah"" restaurant."
"I've been here twice now (Farmhouse is right around the corner from my place), and it's about time I review it! The Vibe: It's a lovely space - rather small, but two floors with tables and some benches). The bar is on the first floor and the host/ess stand can get pretty crowded right by the door. The decor is cozy and interesting, and the bathrooms have lit candles and unique re-purposed decorations. Can get pretty loud with just 1 or 2 raucous tables - so beware of taking big groups - you may not be able to hear each other very well.The Food: Cheese curds. All day, every day. Comes with two delicious dipping sauces. The white sauce has a jalapeno KICK to it that is fantastic. Pretzel - nice and pretzel-y. Pretty standard. MAC AND CHEESE FOR DAYS. Worth getting the portion for the table  - by the end you will be stabbing each other with forks for the last bite. Entrees are good. Friend raved about the veggie burger. Regular burger is delicious too. I subbed fries for the Mac and Chees.e Good for: taking a friend or date to a place with 1) really good food that is 2) not a giant restaurant 3) not super dressy and 4) not in the crazy hubbub that is Randolph St. area."
Very fresh and flavorful food. Service was amazing.
"Have been to Farmhouse many times for all sorts of occasions (work happy hour, friend's bday, midweek lunch, etc.) and it has never disappointed in the food and drink department. Love the fries and the many cheesy options as appetizers as well as the fact that they serve my favorite cava and Revolution beer. I really like their decor and, more importantly, that they offer OpenTable reservations. Given the choice, I opt for a table upstairs, but that's just personal preference."
Great food and beer selection. I've been here with friends couple of times. I'm also really fond of their desserts
The freshness of the food at Farmhouse is beyond none. The fall menu today was delicious and welcoming. We started with a couple of fall cocktails that we both enjoyed. They give special attention to the cider sangria. I had the Indianan fish fry and it was delightful and flavorful. My Sancerre cut the oilinesse.. The homemade mustard seed gastrique and tartar sauce were excellent. Love this neighborhood Jem. John & Jen were excellent too.
"I came to Chicago for the food. I hit up Girl and the Goat. I ate at Frontera Grill. My best meal was at Farmhouse. I can't eat gluten, so choosing a restaurant is always a little bit difficult from the get go. I liked Farmhouse's commitment to serving local food and their menu seemed worth a try...The gluten free options were a plenty and my server was quite knowledgeable and accommodating. The drink menu is quite long and I ended up choosing a local gluten free beer I can't get back in NYC. The pork appetizer and lamb entree were both complex dishes that satisfied. My sister ordered the mashed potatoes and thought they were so good she ordered a second helping! Overall the service was helpful and friendly, the food was satisfying, interesting, and delicious. We'll definitely be back when we're in Chicago next!"
"I was here the other day with my boyfriend. We ordered the 2 person mussels, a medium-rare burger and the grilled cheese with pork belly. My boyfriend is a huge fan of root beer, so he ordered the house-made root beer. He did not like it at all. He drank it all just so that he could get rid of it and drink water instead. It's not craft root beer. It's syrup that they pour into a glass and they have a machine that puts in carbonated water. We split the mussels and it was lovely. We love seafood so this was great, but I ate one mussel that tasted like it was rancid. All of the other ones tasted perfectly fine! But this single mussel made me spit out my food. It left a pretty foul taste in my mouth. But onto the mains! The grilled cheese was lovely. I think it was a bit TOO cheesy because it overpowered my taste buds. The tomato soup was lovely and I liked dipping my sandwich. I would come back for this dish. I don't think the main course food is meant for sharing because when I tasted the burger, I couldn't taste anything. My taste buds got such a shock from the grilled cheese that the burger tasted generic to me. What a pity. I was disappointed with the fries because they were limp and not crisp at all.I like this place because it has a wide variety of alcohol, especially the different beers on tap. The service was alright. Our waitress was friendly, but when they took away our plates with the empty mussels, they left the huge pot of mussel broth on the table. It sat there while we were eating the rest of our meal. I'm happy that I tried Farmhouse out, but nothing on the menu stands out to me. It all seems kind of average and overpriced. Our bill came out to be $50 without tip. I think that's quite a lot for a casual lunch. Also, is there a coat rack somewhere? If there wasn't an empty table next to us, my trench coat would have been dragging on the ground or people would trip over it. If there is, no one asked if we wanted it hung. Please invest in one. I don't want anyone to get hurt and winter season is approaching. Finally, there seemed to be a lot of fruit flies flying around. We kept on swatting the air while we were waiting for our food."
"Checked out Farmhouse for lunch, the menu had a lot of great choices, but ended up going with the Pork Sandwich (Slagel Farms Pork Schnitzel, Rooftop Arugula Tossed in a Raspberry Vinaigrette, and a Fried Farm Egg, served with Tavern Cut Chips - $14). Hearty enough for lunch, but definitely not good for your heart (ok, next time I'll go with a salad). My co-worker went with the BLT, but it was small and didn't look as appealing. Would recommend for a relatively quick sit-down lunch if you're in that area."
"Adequate, service was fast, price seemed reasonable, but 3 drinks appetizers for 2 price north of 140.00"
Excellent service price and food. Very convenient to the loacl art galleries.
"I truly loved the Farmhouse. First off, it was a beautiful pace (even the bathroom was nice). The host was very friendly, but our waitress was average. Although she did recommend the veggie burger and my cousin truly loved it! I went here because I came back from Madison last weekend and I was craving cheese curds, and I was NOT disappointed. I'm coming back to bring my boyfriend and our friends next week. Truly loved the place!I recommend! Cheese curds are delicious!"
Thank you for the delicous food. I would recommend coming to get very good food. I really like coming here. I think the  place needs little cheaper options but its certainly worth the price because its good! I would recommend you trying this place out.
"came here for breakfast/brunch on a weekend a few weeks ago and thought this establishment was just ""eh."" Parking - street, expensive metered! *(right across from the train so might as well take that if you're near a train line)Food - wasn't anything exceptional I got a breakfast scramble and it tasted ok but I felt it was something I could easily replicate at home. Mini scones came before our entrees so that was cute.. but they didn't taste that exceptional and a little dry.Venue - the saving grace and why I gave it 2 stars. Very cute venue and nicely decorated (like a ""farmhouse""). bright and sunny!Staff - also why they got 2 stars, the wait staff and bar staff were exceptionally nice. Price - med/high typical Chicago but for the type of food I'd say definitely overpriced.Given food is the staple of why you go to a restaurant, I wouldn't return since I didn't feel like there was anything special on the breakfast/brunch menu. Perhaps when I think of farmhouse I think whooo they are going to make some exciting breakfast combinations. No. I haven't have any of their dinner menu entrees so I can't comment there but with so many excellent options elsewhere I'm not sure I'd come back again."
"I absolutely love this place. I've only been for breakfast/lunch and every time I keep craving what I get a few days later. I've had the eggs Benedict and the farm scramble which has mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, kale and something else. It's my favorite for breakfast. The food is so good. They also have good mimosas and lattes.  The place can get pretty packed some days around 1-2 for brunch. Go for breakfast and it's nice and it's quiet and not too packed- still a bit of people there though. My boyfriend and I would go everyday over the weekend if we didn't want to go broke."
"Great beer, great food!I got the pork schnitzel with cabbage and apple butter or something like that. There could have been more apple butter because the pork was a little salty, but overall it was great.My boyfriend got the farmhouse burger. It was bland, not the best burger we've had, but it was clean and cooked with care.Our host, Brent, was very friendly!"
"Farmhouse gets a 3.5 from me.  I was SO close to giving it a 3, but farmhouse is, in my opinion, ultimately above average, so I'll round up.  I brought my significant other here for a birthday, and I must admit that I wish I had chosen a more intimate setting.  Farmhouse has an incredibly good beer list.  The only other fine-dining experience in Chicago I can think of with a beer list this good, extensive, and local is Publican.  They also feature farm-to-table (hence the name) cuisine.  For starters, we ordered the cheese curds, the farm green salad, and the pork rinds.  The cheese curds were really good, but I thought the price was a bit steep ($8).  The salad was great, and the pork rinds were ridiculously good.  For entrees we got the Pork Schnitzel and the Roasted Pheasant.  I found the Pork Schnitzel to be flavorful but a bit dry.  The pheasant was very good, and the wild rice was awesome, but the portion size of pheasant was seriously lacking.  It was 1/4 of a pheasant...this was not an entree.  Overall, the food was very nice.  Honestly, the only complaint I have about the food is it didn't feel like a good value for what was served.  The reasons for being so close to giving Farmhouse 3 stars are due to some awkward service experiences.  I made a reservation two weeks in advance and made a request that ""We prefer to be sat alone (not at the communal table). It is for a birthday.""  This was apparently interpreted by the host as being sat upstairs, next to the service station, on wobbly stools, and at a skinny uneven communal table next to 6 drunk people yelling at the NCAA tournament.  Ug, if I'm paying more than $50 a head, I want a back to my chair. Come on. However, I honestly can't fault them for the communal seating because, when making the reservation, you literally check a box that says ""In checking this box, I acknowledge my party may be sat in the communal seating area. Requests for private dining may be indicated (but are not guarunteed) in the notes field above"". Ok. Understood. But it was pretty grinding to be sat 15 feet from two 2 tops that were open for most of the time we were there. What I'm getting at is it seems the host doesn't look at the requests made in online reservations. I wish he would have at least acknowledged 'I see you made a request, but we're sorry we can't accommodate that tonight'. I'm not minus-ing stars because of communal seating as I read and checked the box, but I'm not ignoring how awkward the communal setup was. If the communal seating were like Publican (roomy and with proper chairs) then fine, but we were sat at an uneven counter right on top of other people on little stools with zero mention that we had made any request. Our server was a nice girl, but she seemed overextended. For both of our drink refills we had to ask a different server to send ours over. Conveniently, we were half a foot from the service station so we could always find one. The weirdest thing happened when  our entrees came out. The table was cramped, and I was trying to get my drink menu out of the way for the food runner as he was setting my food down. He was in such a hurry that he put the plate of food on top of my menu as I was raising it off the table. There was an awkward exchange, and instead of lifting it back up he looked at me funny and ran away. What? I guess I'll just eat my food on a menu placemat now...Overall, I'm happy there's something like this in the downtown area amongst all the soul-less crap. The vibe makes it feel more like it belongs out in one of the neighborhoods. I'll have to keep this place in mind for a group when we're around that area, as the wide array of beers, cocktails, and local wines are sure to please everyone. However, I suggest against any intimate dinners, and it's a bit pricey for what you get."
"Awesome atmosphere, superb beer list. and cheese curds that will blow you away! Only downside is it's a touch expensive."
"Farmhouse has a cozy atmosphere with an amazing staff. The only thing that outmatched the ambience was the rainbow trout- some of the best fish I have had in a long time. Fish and chips were good but the highlight was the presentation. Great beer selection and mixed drinks. The bittersweet chocolate tart wasn't as good as the consistency was a little hard. However, the trout and the ambience made this a beloved experience."
"The first time I went here service was great,  food was great. However The second time? Well all my friends and i got sick.  Every thing we got was super salty.  The service sucked. The eggs had oil dripping from them... ewwwWhen we told the waitress this.  She smiled and said that the new chef probably needed to lay off chewing too much tobacco.Are you serious....Next day ago of us got sick and promised to never return."
"I came to Farmhouse on a Saturday morning around 10:30 AM with a reservation. The restaurant has a great feel- very warm and welcoming. We were seated right away near the front door where the sun was shining in.I ordered the Farmhouse Hash. The potatoes, leeks, and lamb are such a great combination- full of flavor and unique. I haven't had something like this at brunch before, but it was a great surprise. I'd definitely go back for this plate!"
"juuuuust barely an A-OK in my book. I think the cheese curds go along way toward redeeming my review - as they are always AWESOME and I have a slight addiction to really worthy cheesy items! The ""no no"" for me is the fact that they create this masterpiece of lightness in the fried cheese and then bog it down with a side offering of chile-mayo. Or, you can opt for a thin version of ketchup that doesn't cut it either for me. These cheesy babies need no dressing though, so thankfully, I'm just citing these dislikes as a matter of caution so you don't waste a single golden curd!The service is usually pleasant and good, though we did have one female server awhile back who would only look at my husband and seldom at me which is always weird when that happens either way. Who can ever figure out what that's about but it happens infrequently enough to stick in your mind when it does happen. SEE? Here I am going on about it. Back to the review: Dinners (Amish Chicken & Whitefish) we've had haven't been memorable  is how I can sum up the evening dining. We did recall having one of those tall tables in the center across from the bar a couple times, and it goes from ""cozy"" to ""cramped"" pretty quickly.  Plus, prices kind of neutralize what would have been any ""wow"" factor - you kind of expect it to be good & fresh since it's slightly pricey. Last time I visited I got the curds and coffee and was planning to stay for a meal, but it was late brunch hour and truly, the state of the coffee turned me off. My server was great - I asked her to freshen my cup, but the problem was in the fact that they pre-brew a huge pot and it came from the same place. The coffee - overly steaming hot and tasting bitter - was just not to my liking. The French Press is the way to go, so should I return I will stay with that route. Surprisingly, I've never had a mixed drink here, so I'm going to do that one of these days - or the cucumber basil soda sounds refreshing.The decor and the bar area are truly wonderful - definitely gives the feel of city meets ""farmhouse"" kitchen. It's got a simple warmth.  The bar area is happenin' & the big open windows up front may give a whole different perspective, so next time, it's time to change it up! That is: except for the cheese curds."
"Had the pork belly sandwich here maybe two years ago, and I can't stop thinking about it!  Hands down my favorite spot in chicago. Good portions, the prices aren't terrible, fresh, and it went so well with their apple cider. YUM."
"The Mac and cheese was out of this world. The chicken was very tender and delicious as well. I gave 3 stars because my friend ordered the bavette steak medium rare and it tasted like leather. Also, as a big chocolate lover, the chocolate short bread cookies were disappointing."
"Cool ambience. I feel very ""Great Lakes"" whenever I eat/drink at Farmhouse. You MUST get the cheese curds.A lot of the seating is based on communal tables, so keep that in mind if you can't help eavesdropping."
"Week night dinner with some great friends landed us at Farmhouse! Our hostess was polite and sat us early while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. I didn't realize the restaurant was two floors! We sat upstairs overlooking Chicago Ave.The table split the cheese curbs which melted in your mouth, a perfect combination of salt, cheese and crunch. For dinner I had the classic burger and subbed brussel sprouts for my fries. The burger had great flavor not to mention HUGE!!I love that the produce is locally sourced and grown! I would highly recommend if you are in the area for a bit of local flare with great prices."
"Great find with local, organic food. Cool drinks (there's one with cucumber and pepper that's really tasty). Great food. Best cheese curds ever. Better than Wisconsin."
"Good food.  Good beer.  Was pretty loud. Not surprising, but not ideal either."
Delicious brunch. Loved the bloody mary's with the mini beer back. Service was wonderful. Will definitely try again.
"My husband and I tried this place last night based on my desire to explore the more hip dining experiences across the city as well as based on the reviews and it's location along our route from the loop to The Second City via the brown line.  Let me just say, we were NOT disappointed.  We chose to share a meal from appetizer to dessert, and each plate was better than the last.  We started with the cheese curds.  They were excellent - not heavily battered or over-seasoned. A portion size definitely meant for sharing with someone.  Alone, the little fried cheese nuggets were great, but paired with the condiments alongside them they were phenomenal. Homemade catsup - a less thick and sweet, slightly more vinegar-y alternative to the squeeze/pour-bottle variety - and a ""spicy curd sauce"" that  I can't quite put my finger on but would slurp out of a straw no less - ranch-y, tangy, goodness in a little cup. Next up we ordered the Indiana Fish Fry.  A heavier beer batter than on the curds, but EXCELLENTLY seasoned.  Could have eaten it without anything on it, but, once again, so glad I did try the condiments on the rustic board it was served on: mustard seed gastrique, and a house made tartar.  My favorite was the gastrique.  I would have literally jumped in and swam around if someone would have told me I could!! It takes the place of your run-of-the-mill malt vinegar but really shouldn't have even been mentioned in the same sentence together.  The tartar sauce was awesome as well - my husband's favorite accompaniment.  Lighter than a typical tartar sauce and flavorful.  The large portion of hand cut fries were a great match for the fish and were crispy and chewy and perfectly salted.  Last, oh but CERTAINLY not least, was the dessert.  We tried the Chocolate Budino, according to our waiter a newer addition to the dessert menu.  Oh. My. God. It was a bitter stout toffee ""pudding"" - a deep chocolate color and rich dark-chocolate-and-toffee kind of flavor.  On top was a scoop of malted banana ice cream which was, for whatever reason, the perfect flavor to put on top of that pudding.  It wasn't overwhelmingly ""banana"", but cut through the richness of the pudding in the most perfect way. This hipster joint is expertly devoted to the farmhouse theme in a fun and interesting way.  Their farm-to-table philosophy was appreciated and every menu tells you where its main ingredients came from (even the massive selection of craft brews and liquors). I had a Une Annee Dubbel from Chicago and it was a perfect match for the curds and perch.  I will definitely be back!!"
"the cheese curds were great, probably some of the best I've had, the regular cheeseburger was really good and decent size, the fries were just all right, but the garlic mayo to dip them in made them good, really nice beer list as well, they even have man o awe from 3 floyds which i never see anywhere, if i do go back i wanna go for brunch because that menu has a lot of good looking things on it"
"Easily deemed as the best chicken I've ever had. The cheese curds are also delicious, but best when eaten fresh out the kitchen. If I lived in the area, I would def come back, but for now, I'll just daydream about that night when Farmhouse's chicken and my tastebuds met."
"I came here after work one Friday, around 5:30pm.  Two of us got in and were seated upstairs, right away.  There were more people there at that time that I would have expected, which is good for them. I was told to try the Cheese Curds...and boy did they not disappoint...in fact, they were amazing!  I also got the fish and chips, subbed chips for the french fries, where were also great.  The fresh dill dip that came with the chips was incredible, the other two dips with the fish were also great.  My date got the burger, which he said was good.  They had a good beer selection and I will absolutely come back.  Loved the rustic atmosphere of the place."
"Disappointing.The forest mushroom and poblano burger was essentially fried - you could hardly taste the mushroom and didn't notice there was any poblano. The fried breadcrumbs masked everything.Fries were soggy and not in a good way either. You could tell these things were sitting out for a while.And to rub salt in the wound, the bartender took away my beer though there were still a few sips left. I suppose he was eager to get me out of there. Did I forget to take a shower? I thought I did =)There was one bartender on a Thursday night for a 30-minute period = poor service."
"My husband and I went here after work and it was amazing! We shared a brussels sprout salad and the Indiana fish fry and both were very, very good. We got the chocolate chess pie for dessert, which is one of the best restaurant desserts I've had. They have a great craft beer menu, and I got a really great cocktail. Our server was really nice and attentive but not pushy. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
Eric the bartender is awesome. Amazing beer list and wonderful suggestions. Food is brilliant.  This place is a #hiddentreasure. Come here for good beer and food in a welcoming atmosphere. FIVE STARS.
"3rd time here and 3rd time disappointed.  We ordered cheese curds- not bad a little salty!Not much on the menu that was either not fried or did not have pork, so i ordered the pheasant.  Our server brought the food and then was gone for at least 25 minutes. the pheasant was overcooked and so over salted it was inedible.  he came to clear the plates, asked how everything was- I told him about the pheasant and he had no response.  Did not ask if I wanted something else- just nothing. He brought the bill and said he had taken it off- but no apology.  There are many better options in the city!"
"Great brunch and they take reservations!   We were seated right away, Service was exceptional, even though they were busy, we never felt rushed.   The ambience is great (fabulous, cozy décor) and the food was very good.  Don't miss the cheese curds, just like everyone says!"
"One word: Mediocre.  For the price, I expected a bit more.  The only tasty thing I had was the blue cheese. The cheese tray was a pittance. The burger was ok. The blue cheese redeemed it to making it to the ok status.  The pork chop was not really a chop.  It was more of a slab of un-seasoned gamey meat.  DO NOT GET THE MAC AND CHEESE!  I MUST REPEAT - DO NOT GET THE MAC AND CHEESE.  IT TASTES LIKE AIR. We were hoping the desserts would save our meal.  But alas the bread pudding and sundae were just as sub par as the rest."
"A solid 4 stars for the warm autumnal ambiance, delicious creamy mac and cheese, and fantastic Bloody Mary with all the fixings! Service could have been more attentive, as we had to wait a while for ketchup etc before digging in. And they forgot the chicken on my side salad which made it boring at best. My boyfriend and I still had a really fun, laidback weekend lunch and we will be going back to try the curds!"
"Awesome food really nice server! We had the cauliflower and the cheese as appetizers both really good. Then we had the chicken and the pork loin. The chicken stuffing was amazing, I could have had all the  veggiea that come on the side as a main dish!"
Amazing food. All locally produced and organic. The trout was very tasty. Carrots were awesome. Wisconsin cheese kurds were great. Really cool rustic atmosphere. Very friendly staff.
"I don't know about you guys, but this B brakes for beets. So sweet. So juicy. I could eat them by the barrel-full. They be my fave, yo! So naturally, when I see a farm fresh beet salad offered I slam my menu down, signal the garcon and scream at the top of my lungs: Beet me, Baby! Beet me till my cheeks turn red! (beet red, hehe)Anyway, I walked in excited because I'd done my research and saw that Farmhouse has quite the menagerie of super cute animal decals on their front window. Score for this bestial babe. They had me before I even walked in, but still kept me a comin' with that gat damned delicious beet salad. Also noteworthy- based on my reading of the menu and the my dining partners accolades, the veggie burger is both huge and flavorful I'm not gonna lie, I was kinda tempted to cheat on beets with the burger. Next time I'm in I'll be sure to take part in their beer cocktails, although their house-made sodas (Team Gingerale!) aren't too shabby either. Quick tip: Do make a reso. I hear this place can get pretty busy most days and evenings."
Great cocktail menu and loads of spirits and beers from the general area....had a BLT at the bar for a late lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it...our bartender was not only well informed about their offerings but very perky to boot! Highly recommended...
"After my first visit to Farmhouse, I probably would have given this restaurant only two stars. On my first visit, I was seated at a low to the ground table, received a small, overcooked burger, and a sad excuse for Sangria. A couple months later I went back, just for the bar, and had a much better experience--the service is excellent, the atmosphere is very unique and charming. It is a happy place to sit and have a drink and chat with friends. Farmhouse makes ""cute"" (for lack of a better word) design choices like showing their drink list (extensive) on clipboards and mismatched chairs at the bar.I just got back from my third visit to Farmhouse and couldn't be happier with the experience all around. My bf and I stopped in for a quick lunner (just, it's a thing, okay?) at around 3:30. We each got our favorite brews and I took the opportunity to try some menu items I was unfamiliar with. To start, we ordered the pig's ears. These, luckily, don't come out looking like actual ears, but are long pieces of ear that are fried and served with mustard and pickled vegetables. The portion initially looks relatively small, but the dish is rich and we didn't receive any more than the two of us could have eaten. It was good and we were glad we tried it.For my main dish, I got the leek and mushroom risotto. This was phenomenal and I would highly recommend it. I got perfectly cooked mushrooms in every bite and it was so filling. Whereas I remember leaving my first visit slightly hungry and dissatisfied, tonight I was served rich, flavorful, perfectly balanced dishes that I almost couldn't finish. My bf got the fish and chips and loved the mustard it was served with along with the fact that the fish wasn't too heavily battered (it felt light but was filling).Service was great as usual. There was a mixup in the bill, but once I pointed it out, the server was happy to make changes.I think Farmhouse is a great choice and is on par with other restaurants at this price point. For what it's worth, I saw bigger, juicier looking burgers being served today, so perhaps my first experience was an off-day. I will be back next time I'm in the area."
"Amazing food and drinks, cool decor and friendly service! The BBQ beef short ribs with corn fritters were phenomenal! Defiantly a must anytime I'm near Chicago."
I loved everything about Farmhouse! The beet salad was amazing... The drinks were delightful... The commitment to local farmers  is what puts Farmhouse over the top for me.
"Lacking on the customer service for sure.  We made reservations for a 2 party on a Friday night.   Besides the bar, the restaurant tables were vacant.  They sat us at the smallest 2 top possible and while we asked to sit at a more cozy table, the hostess responded rudely and said they were ALL under reservations.  We chose to sit at a shared bar top along the front window instead.  I feel the need to mention here that non of those tables sat any parties what so ever the entire hour or longer we were there.  My husband thought his meal (the chicken) was mediocre meanwhile I got severe food poisoning from the Gnudi.  Vomiting for 2 solid days not to mention while I was in my 2nd trimester of being pregnant.  We know for certain it was the Gnudi as my husband and I mirrored every meal and snack throughout the entire day.   If you've had food poisoning then you also know what was the culprit because you can almost sense or taste it.   My husband called the next day to advise them of the situation and we didn't even get an apology.  We more or less got the ""well it couldn't have been from here because we had no other customers complain"" and ""it had to have been the pregnancy"" and ""well hope she feels better"".    Ummmm, no...you don't violently vomit for 48 hours randomly in a 2nd trimester pregnancy and THIS is the ONLY meal that wasn't shared with my husband.   The appropriate thing to do is apologize and maybe offer a refund on the meal?   To this day I have never been able to gut an onion broth or ricotta cheese...nor will I ever gut Farmhouse again!"
"This place was cool! I loved the ambiance and the staff was really excellent. Our food was yummy and the wine was good, too (all locally sourced). I would say I wish the menu was a bit larger, but with all the food being local it could limit the selection ;) It's totally worth checking out, but it can be pricey (a lot more than we expected) so bear that in mind."
"Go with the chicken dish it is top notch, the burger is average.  Excellent selection of local brews as well."
"Absolutely fabulous place to have brunch. The food was delicious, the Bloody Mary was scrumptious. Really loved the atmosphere and the staff was really friendly and attentive. Can't wait to return!"
Very professional stuff: knows the menu in every detail and give great advises on food. The food and beer is very good. I loved the blueberry cider. Definitely a go!
"We have been waiting for this place to open, and were finally able to try it this week. It was pretty good! We were seated right away, and our waitress was super friendly. We ordered two beers- the Rosa (a hibiscus ale- try it!) and the 5 lizard- both craft beers from Illinois. I wanted to try the Ginger Peach cider, but sadly, they were out. Oh well, next time! For food, we ordered the Cured Beef Jerky & Roasted Nuts (5), Beer battered Wisconsin Cheese Curds (9), and the Farmhouse ""Classic"" Burger with smoked Gouda (13). We found it a little strange that they waited and brought everything out at once, instead of starting us off with the appetizers, but that's okay. The jerky and nuts were great- we ended up taking most of it to go since we were so full from everything else. I love cheese curds, and these did not disappoint. We probably won't get them again though since they were kind of salty, and there are so many other things we'd like to try! The burger, however, we would definitely get again. It was so good! You should get it with the smoked gouda- it made it perfect. The meat was tender and juicy, but not greasy. The fries were also tasty. Finally, we got the lemon cornmeal cake (9). Unfortunately, we would not recommend this. It was not that great. Maybe we were just annoyed that we weren't given fresh silverware?Overall, this is a nice restaurant with great decor. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Oh, and the bathrooms (which are upstairs) have peppermints, and  fancy soap and lotion, which I appreciated."
"Had the Stick & Bindle platter, Blueberry & Beat salad, and Veggie burger, all of which was wonderful. The servers were knowledgable and funny. The service was excellent."
Amazing.Honestly one of my favorite atmospheres in the city.If you enjoy great unique beer: GO if you enjoy a small but great wine list: GOif you enjoy bomb ass whiskey: GO GO GO I really enjoy a good atmosphere and a great beer. They had me satisfied from the moment I walked in. Great staff too! Really friendly and knowledgeable. The food looked great coming out of the kitchen so I grabbed the classic burger. I was sorta underwhelmed with it. it wasn't bad..but i didn't get a wow factor i usually do from a burger in the city. Maybe it was an off day.I'll be back for sure!
"Went here with a friend on a Sunday around 9pm for a late dinner.  Place wasn't packed and we were able to get right in.  We sat at the bar and had great service from the bartender.  He seemed new and could've known his stuff better, but he provided such good service it didn't matter.  Appropriately timed his check-ins, constantly refilled my water without interrupting, and overally kept us really happy.I got the burger (on challah roll) and it was good but there was too much bread and it simply wasn't juicy enough.  The cheese curds we started with were AMAZING.  So is the gin selection.  Tons of gins.  I'm a big gin fan and I didn't realize they specialize in gins.  Easily a few dozen options behind the bar.I'm definitely returning!"
"Good food, albeit a tad overpriced for what you get.Excellent drink and beer selection.  Great decor as well."
"Nice farm-to-table gem in River North.  Windows facing the street, exposed brick, low lighting, and consistent ""farm"" theme make for a great atmosphere.Known for the cheese curds, I had to try these delectable goodies and was indeed pleased.  Tarra T. went with the veggie burger, while I went for the traditional burger.  While my burger tasted a bit overdone, we were pleased with the meal overall and will eventually make it back to try some other items."
"Whether it's sitting at the bar in front of the Bevador or lounging on an eclectic mix of chairs upstairs... Farmhouse has quickly earned a special place in my gastro-heart. While I've yet to delve into their list of midwestern crafts, their house made sodas are just as great for non-alcoholics or the rare social drinker (aka me). The ginger ale is my go-to and favorite: crisp and refreshing. The cranberry spice is snazzy and is best described as Christmas-in-a-glass... delicious! The cheese curds are a MUST. Every time I order, the anticipation alone elicits a twinge of excitement. They come hot, crispy with oozy-gooey cheese that strings out after you take a bite. The adler smoked catsup is something I've yet to experience elsewhere and is a perfect pairing with the curds. Be prepared to order more than one!I'm still working my way through their menu, but some Main Harvests I've had/tasted:AMISH CHICKENsucculent and juicy with a yummy lemony-citrus sauce. If you're looking for your fix of protein, look no further!GRASS-FED BURGERorder it with gouda and a fried egg-- tops the list of burgers I've had thus far and sufficiently satiated my burger cravingsSHORT RIBScomfort food at its finest... VERY tender. I loved the accents of carrots and the horseradish mashed potatoesGRAINS BURGERour server recommended it with smoked gouda and I obliged. It definitely added more dimension to the burger, but I was expecting more bites of poblano and mushrooms. The patty was a little too moist and sticky for my liking. Usually we're too stuffed to order dessert, but we decided to go full-out once and ordered the carrot cake. I liked the carrot shreds and chunks of cherries. I couldn't get enough of the sweet cream cheese-esque drizzlings on top. I was also eyeing their lemon blueberry whoppie pie-- if only I had more room!Even though it's a little further from my usual walking radius, it is definitely well worth the trip! Can't wait for my next Farmhouse venture with more friends in tow!"
"We love this place. Its so simple making a reservation on open table for this place but its always packed. The food is great, drinks awesome, service is fantastic."
"I live two blocks away and have sprinted past this cute little spot several times during the summer and immediately noticed how they made great use of the limited space in front to add some seating in order for folks to dine al fresco.  That being said, I finally made it inside.  It was only for drinks and, quite frankly, I don't know how we were able to sit there for 3 hours without ordering everything that danced from the kitchen to the tables and teased our senses along the way.Let me start with the bartender.  She was a tiny little thing but very vocal about her favorite brews.  I started with a Cider and she warned me it was pretty tart.  I tasted another cider first but I was afraid it was too sweet so I opted for the tart cider.  Boy, she wasn't kidding.  Upon my first sip, I said to my friend ""this tastes like vinegar.  I feel like I'd drinking Easter Egg dye.""  I think he thought I was crazy but that's besides the point.The bartender looked at me and took the cider away.  She said ""I don't want you drinking something you don't like.  What can I get ya?""  So, I went for the cider I originally tasted.  I'm really not high maintenance, I felt bad, but she was super cool about it.Wednesday night at 8:00 p.m., this adorable little gem is packed and I was able to smell, it was for good reason.  Not only is the entire idea behind Farmhouse fantastic (everything is local), but each and every plate that skipped its way past me was whispering ""i'm tasty. i'm tasty. i'm tasty.""  Everything smelled incredible.So, as we proceeded to close down the bar and several ciders later, I left with a desire to return and actually order food next time.  OH - and the music is excellent.  They scored major points as everything that came on was as organic as the entire experience and environment...I look forward to my next visit."
"Interesting / confusing decor that is somehow charming. Good beer list and really great appetizers (I'm looking at you cheese curds). Also, I'm a sucker for any place that sells beef jerky as an appetizer. So there's that. It is perhaps a bit overpriced but what place isn't in River North?"
"We stopped in on a Friday night, the place was packed and we didn't have reservations.  We checked upstairs and there was a perfect little coffee table that was available immediately so we took it!  They have an amazing selection of local beers and beers from the surrounding states.  We had the cheese curds which were delicious and for dinner the risotto and trout.  Both entrees were outstanding!!!  The hostess and server were both super friendly, very refreshing!  I would highly recommend this place as a visitor or a local."
"One of my favorite restaurants in the city.  The food is really really good, the wine/beer/cocktail selections are great and the atmosphere is really fun.  This is a great place to go with a group.   Get the cheese curds.   Actually, if you're ever somewhere and they have cheese curds on the menu, you should always get the cheese curds."
"I was visiting Chicago Memorial Day weekend and because I am a chronic planner, I spent time 2 weeks before our visit reading different review sites on restaurants near our hotel. Farmhouse was one of the ones that stood out to me.  Baltimore has had a rush of restaurants that have surfaced producing Farm to Table style menus, one of the main reasons we like these style of restaurants is because they all tend to do food really well. Farmhouse was not the exception. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly host and sat in a section directly across from the bar. The ambiance was romantic with dim lighting  but not so dim that you couldn't see your meal. There was a hockey game on at the bar (directly behind me) so there were some patrons who were excited about the game...they were solely responsible for the noise level (which still wasn't bad).As most Farm to Table style restaurants, the decor was modern Americana. Nice enough to wear a dress and casual enough for jeans.  Based on the reviews, we had to order the Cheese Curds!  After about 3 or 4 apiece, we'd had enough. They were delicious but very rich and fried. It didn't really fit into our workout plan.  For our entree, we both ordered the trout.  It was served with Mushrooms and was DELICIOUS! We were concerned about how fresh seafood could be in Chicago, but after having the trout, we were pleased and sold.Now for the important part...the drinks! I ordered the Old Fashioned with bourbon (not rye) and it was perfect! I am usually a Manhattan drinker because I prefer less of a sweet drink and more of a robust and flavorful drink. All in all, I would highly recommend Farmhouse if you are ever in Chicago looking for a casual hip environment with wonderful food!"
"Local, Organic & they make their own sodas?! I loved Farmhouse! We walked in at 5pm on a Saturday afternoon, I had just got off of a 4 hour flight and was completely famished! We made a reservation, so you gotta do that!We sat upstairs right by the beautifully stocked bar. We were greeted by Lance, and he sure was helpful! Knowledgable of the menu and cocktail list, and had patience to walk through it for us. We started with the Wisconsin Cheese Curds, complete with housemade catsup. HOLY *&^%$#@!@$%. I couldn't believe how sinful these delicately fried bites of cheese were! My main plate consisted of the fresh trout. Winter coleslaw topped off the filet of flaky fish with toasted hazelnuts under a bed of fingerling potato gratin. I inhaled it! I am a huge fan of trying local goods and cuisines, and this was a great way to introduce me to the local catch of the day!"
"This place is awesome. As a beer loving tourist from NY, I have recommended this place to several people who have planned to visit the area. My fiance and I were out and about on a Friday night looking for a good beer place and came across this place on Google. It was pretty crowded at the bar so sat back in the other sort of awkward bar in the back of the place.Enter our waiter, Andrew. In NY we can't get a lot of the beers on the menu at Farmhouse so we let Andrew pick two beers within a range of styles and told him we were going to switch half way through. Three rounds of drinks and we could not have been happier. He was friendly, very knowledgeable and gave us some great beers! I wish we were hungry because the food looked awesome. Next time I'm in Chicago I will definitely be hitting this place up for dinner!"
"My wife and I are foodies, so we were excited to try farmhouse but were let down by the food. My wife had the risotto which was way over cooked and covered about a 1/4 inch in a small bowl...a very small portion. Taste wise it was just meh nothing to write about. I had the fish and chips but aside from the basalmic sauce it was also very disappointing, kind of long john silver-ish the way it came in a paper cone. These were not cheap meals by the way 20-30 range. The dessert was bread pudding and it was almost OK. This place could be good in the hands of the right people but the current management is not it. The service was good though.Afterward we went to the Capitol Grill and got some drinks and appetizers."
"No one here knew what'sup - half the restaurant was empty but the hostess sat us in between 3 tables with loud conversationists arranged close to each other Manhattan-style. When we asked to move tables, they said they were't sure whether they'd be able to - who are they saving the other half of the restaurant for? Queen of England? Well, as vegetarians, we had limited choices - mac n cheese made of wheel pasta, veggie burger which was okay, cheese curds and and okay salad. Their beer selection was phenomenal so I'd recommend going back just for drinks and skipping food! Their selection was local and my ""flannel PJs"" was a good stout!"
"CHEESE CURDS. I'd never had them before, but now I want them every day. Food is good, drink list is awesome. I had a great beet and rocket salad that I'd totally order again, and my friends who ordered the Amish chicken ate almost everything on their plates.They have a coat/bag check, but the staff is a little hard to catch when you want to pick up your stuff at the end of your meal. I think it's confusing that they give you your check and receipt by stuffing them into books. Cute decor, but hipster staff so service is a little slow."
"Already exhausted from the gastronomic and alcoholic tour to date, we went into a Sunday evening dinner with little expectations and no reservations. Like Anthony Bourdain in his completely bizarre holiday special, I summoned up the willpower to scrounge up a suitable dinner experience. Whereas Anthony has his multitude of restaurant industry friends to do his bidding, I have...Yelp. It pointed me to Farmhouse, and voila: an OpenTable rezzie later, and we were in business.Farmhouse is located slightly off the beaten path, eight or so blocks away from Magnificent Mile. It's also not a farmhouse. It is a cozy, locally sourced, midwestern friendly restaurant that tries dang hard to impress. I liked that.We arrived a little early, and with a big party, had to wait for previous patrons to leave. No worries: we sat at the bar where our fine bartender (apologies to the gentleman, but I by now forget his name) promptly helped us choose the right beers. He asked us what we liked, and offered samples based on our palette. Had we been more conniving diners, we could've played this game all night long, and he likely would have remained amiable to the cause. As it were, I quickly found a favorite or two on their stout beer menu, akin to a slimmed-down Publican except focused on Illinois and bordering states.After sipping on some suds, we were seated, but not before the bartender left us with a tip: cheese curds and amish chicken. Done.My first foray with cheese curds was a successful one, fried bites of gooeyness with a respectable homemade ketchup (or, per them, ""catsup""). Our friendly bartender made sure we were hooked up with some limited edition hot sauce--a gamechanger, he called it. Seriously, add that to the ketchup, dip a cheese curd in, and prepare for the gates of heaven to arrive. It's a phenomenal combination.With a table full of mac & cheese lovers, we also started with the Mac & Cheese Fritters. I preferred the curds, but the BBQ cream sauce that accompanied the fritters were awesome.Despite the Amish Chicken suggestion, I went with the Farmhouse Burger, my only real disappointment of the night. I added smoked gouda and a fried egg, both amazing and my preferred way to eat a burger. However, the beef patty itself was pretty much devoid of flavor, a surprise to me. The fries were fine. The table was also served short ribs and river trout, and I had bites of both and approved.The winner, of course, was the chicken. I remember one chef telling me never to order chicken at a restaurant, because anyone can make chicken. That's true, but I consider chicken a paramount dish, because so few make it phenomenally. For one shining example, check out the Chicken in Clay Pot at Takashi. Back to Farmhouse: the half roasted Amish Chicken was perfectly seasoned, cooked, and presented. Along with a forkful of cracked pepper spaetzle and rosemary gravy, it was undoubtedly the best bite I had all evening. I only wish I had ordered it for myself.While the beer menu beckoned, I just had to try their house made soda, and the root beer didn't disappoint. Likewise, my friend went with ginger ale. Both hit the spot, and make it really hard to pick between refreshment and intoxication.We tried to save room for dessert (I was eying the strudel), but we were all simply too full to indulge anymore. That, my friends, is what they call the sign of a fantastic meal."
"Disappointing dinner. Dressing on salad very salty for all 3 of us. Burger ordered mediumvcame with substantial raw meat in middle. Sent it back, but it came back same in new bun. Scraped out raw."
"Can't believe it took me over a year to get back to Farmhouse.  This time around I brought my little lady as farm fresh cuisine and craft beer are right up her alley.  I'm pleased to say that Farmhouse has won me over and the problems that I had the first time around (crap table, off service and unmemorable food) have been resolved.  We had a cozy table for two tucked away from the rest of the place.  It's still a bit loud in here and I struggled to hear our conversation.  Brewery Vivant's Farmhand Ale for the lady to start, I had the 5 Rabbit 5 Grass Pale Ale.  We liked both of those.  The draft list of about twenty on tap, like the food menu, highlights local purveyors.  I spotted many of my local faves like 3Fs, Greenbush, Revolution, Goose and Bells, but in the end tried a few I don't often see or drink.  Second round for us was the Revolution Double Fist Double Pale Ale (hers) and the Darkhorse Scotty Karate Scotch Ale (mine).  I also liked that our server, who had earlier fixed our wobbly table before I even said anything about it, corrected his slip up of taking my slowski wife's beer before she had finished it and replaced it with a fresh one to make up for it.  Nice touch.  As for the food, it was outstanding.  We split a few salads, both had mains and split desserts.  Yes, we like to eat and drink.  Roasted Beet and Baby Rocket Salad, Goat Cheese, Salty-Toasted Walnuts, Honey Grain Mustard Vinaigrette Farmhouse Chop Salad, Tavern Nuts, Prepared Vegetables, Michigan Dried Cherries, Creamy Herb Cider DressingHalf Roasted Amish Chicken, Buttermilk & Blue Cheese Smashed Potatoes, Frisee & Mushroom Salad, Rosemary Corn VinaigretteBraised Pork Shoulder, Herb Spaetzle, Cabbage, JusWagon Wheel Mac and CheeseBrussel SproutsDeep Dish Brown Dog Farm Cinnamon Apple Walnut Pie, Burnt Caramel Sauce, Maple Butter Walnut Custard Salads were fantastic.  I really liked the dressing for both of them, as mustard is without a doubt my favorite condiment.  My pork was outstanding and reminded me of the kind of dish I would have in some quaint little place in Bavaria.  The sides were tasty as well, brought most of them home.  The mac was sinfully good, give that a try.  Saved room for dessert and the apple pie was a perfect finish.  Date night success at Farmhouse.  Back in my good graces and my wife loved it."
Merely mediocre. Not worth the price.
"One of my favorite places I have been in my travels. Great farm to table locally grown food and wonderful selection of draft beers and spirits (lots of gin, my favorite). Service was wonderful. Only thing I would like is to see a longer good menu. Only good things to say about this place."
Farmhouse has a very friendly staff and great comfort food! The menu is seasonal and fresh.
Cool vibe.  Blood Mary was horrible.  possibly the worst ever and I am not overly picky. Just learned that they use Stu's Bloody Mary mix.  Had farmhouse bkfast and food was a 6/10.  Not worth the $55.  Server was nice.
"My first cheese curds experience - fantastic. Local beer selection is great. Decor was very interesting, and done tastefully. Our server was a nice guy, with a good balance of being attentive without being overbearing."
"I really enjoyed this place!I came with my friend and her parents and we feasted. Great ambiance - a tad dark, but super cute!!! The bartenders had a couple sticks up their asses, but I overlooked that because our server was so great and we had a wonderful time. Fried cheese curds - say whaaaat? Yeah... they were delicious. Chicken was perfectly cooked, but WAYYY too salty - definitely needs a recipe adjustment. Salad was yummy and I think we had something else, but I can't remember. The wine was flowing freely.... I'd definitely go back. Great location - stumble onto the el to get home ;-)"
The food was phenomenal and decent sized. The restaurant is adorable and cozy. I did have to wait a while but it was worth the wait!
"Came on a cold evening with construction on the outside, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the inside was busy and crowded! Luckily, we were seated rather quickly and our drinks + appetizers came out speedy quick as well. The cheese curds - yum yum yum! Tastes like mini cream puffs but filled with cheese instead of cream.Homemade sodas - when I found out they made their own sodas, I had to try their version of a root beer. It rocked! Fizzy, not too sweet but sweet enough, and didn't have the funky aftertaste like you'd expect sodas to be if they're not the brand name ones.Mussels - there's so many that it could definitely be an appetizer for 4+ people or a meal for 1! Flavorful broth, nice touch with the added toasted sliced baguettes, and tons of mussels in one order.Burger - a little too overcooked for my taste, but it was a large portion and the side of brussel sprouts it came with was really good!Overall, a good experience! :)"
Great service and a delicious meal. My sister and I split a simple salad with perfect greens and just the right amount of fennel. The Amish chicken was delicious (a little too salty) with a panzanella that balanced it nicely. Both cocktails were imaginative and not too sweet. Overall delightful.
Just came here last night with one of my girlfriends who is a very picky eater. The food was great. We started with some cheese curds then I had the short ribs while my friend got the burger. To top it off we got the apple pie...heaven!Our server Justin was great and knowledgeable but we often found our drinks empty and we had to look for him a few times. Maybe it was just a busy night so we can't really hold it against him.
"This place is NOT a farmhouse! A farmhouse is located on fertile fields of green. This place is surrounded by the urban towers of River North. A farmhouse has live animals: cows, chickens, and pigs. This place has none; and no, the animals painted on the front glass window do not count. A farmhouse is owned by a man who dresses in overalls and has a name like Old McDonald.  This place has a stylish owner who introduces himself as Ferdia. A farmhouse is quiet and peaceful with occasional chirping of birds and mooing of cows.  This place is loud and vibrant.No, Farmhouse is not a farmhouse.  However, they do serve a succulent roasted chicken with a delectable rosemary corn vinaigrette that would put Mrs. McDonald's farm cooking to shame. And their Humdinger cocktail would probably have Old McDonald permanently tossing aside his jug of moonshine (I assume that's what they drink on farms).  Farmhouse may not be a farmhouse but their food and drink leave nothing to be desired.  If you are looking for rolling fields, live animals and country fresh air, this is not the place for you. If you want tasty, farm fresh cooking from locally sourced ingredients, toss aside your jug of moonshine and get yourself over to Farmhouse ASAP."
"I went to the farmhouse during restaurant week for the second year in a row and sadly I was not amazed, again.  The first year I tried an few items on the restaurant week menu and I though they were OK .  This year I ordered the burger and cheese curds off of the normal menu......the curds were awesome and the only reason I would ever go back....the burger was well done, I asked for medium.  The meat was decent but not a $10 burger standard.  The atmosphere is fun but doesn't make up for the food."
"Easy to miss so you have to pay attention (especially since there is construction on the outside).The decor of the place is very cool and had a clear rustic feel to the place.  We just walked in on a whim for dinner on a Saturday night (no reservations) and did not have to wait too long to get seated.  We ended up eating upstairs which again had about 5-6 tables plus a bar.Our server was awesome!  She was engaging, funny and really good at explaining the menu.  She made some great recommendations that led to a very good evening of food.We started with the Mussels, Wisconsin Cheese Curds (which were green in ode to St Paddy's Day) and Tavern Cut Fries.  The mussels were amazing!  The broth was was sweet and savory which was complimented with the perfectly charred toast.  The mussels were almost not the star of the dish but just the right accompaniment.  The Wisconsin Cheese Curds were addictive and something I think is a must to have!For my main meal I got the Grilled River Trout.  The fish came out charred to perfections (I love my fish slightly crispy).  The lemon-rosemary oil was amazing with the fish.  The meal looked small but packed huge flavor and did a great job filling me up.  It was one of the better fish meals I have had in recent memory.Between the amazing food and awesome server this was a solid 5 stars for me.  Its a place that will stay bookmarked until I come back!"
I'm from Wisconsin. And this place is legit. Cheesecurds and a bloody mary with a beer back. Sold.
It was very good. Service and food all very good.
"I waited too long (a couple months) to write this review so I can't recall what exact dishes we ordered but I do remember all of them being tasty. I do remember we enjoyed the appetizers more than the entrees though. Like many others have said, their drinks are great and unique.  Our server was knowledgeable on both the food and drink menu and just really had an awesome personality. Loved the vibe of the place as well.I would definitely not mind coming back if friends wanted to go."
"One of the distinctive things that make Farmhouse great is the interior. I find it somewhat edgy and ""hipster""-ish, and at the same time, quite home-like and warm. It's also currently decorated for the holidays so that may be part of the reason why I enjoy the warm vibe. I went for weekend brunch recently. We were a table of four. We were greeted by our sever. She was friendly and peppy (and by ""peppy,"" not like ""Jesse Spano on pills peppy""... just the right amount of enthusiasm.). I ordered an organic breakfast tea. It came in a heavy pot so you could just continue to pour more water instead of constantly asking the server for more hot water. That's always a plus. Two of my friends ordered the eggs benedict. They reported to me that it was tasty. My other friend ordered a hamburger with cheddar. She liked the burger, and the accompanying fries were pretty good. (You know all of us were digging into her fries. I mean, if only one person at the table has fries, you know the rest of us are staring at it and wanting some!) Anyway, I ordered the farmhouse scramble (I think that was the name.) It was scrambled eggs with sun-dried tomatoes, kale, and mushrooms. It was seasoned just right. Yummy! I also had the choice of sausage or bacon. I said I wanted sausage, but received bacon. I didn't want to send it back since I like bacon anyway, but that was noted in my mind... You also have the choice of choosing white or wheat toast. I ordered white bread toast and it came with a sweet butter. I don't know what was in that butter, but if it weren't so bad for you, I'd slather it on EVERYTHING!!! There was also a substantial amount of accompanying breakfast potatoes with roasted onions. Loved it. One of the things that did irk my friends and me was regarding water. Two of my friends arrived a few minutes earlier so they received glasses and a bottle for water. When my friend and I got there (and the restaurant knew it was a table for four people), we never had glasses brought out to us. When we asked when we ordered our meals, they said they'd bring glasses and they didn't. We asked once more 10-15 minutes later, and they still didn't come out. We asked another person for glasses again another 10 minutes after that, and when it came out, mine had visible lipstick marks on it. Eeek! I mean, it was quite obvious. How could anyone miss that huge imprint of lips?! Yikes. They quickly brought another glass out and apologized. It was already the end of the meal so it was slightly annoying that we waited thirty+ minutes to just bring water glasses (let alone ones without lipstick marks) out. Other than that, we had a lovely and delicious meal. It's a great brunch/lunch spot. I recommend it. Why wait in crazy lines at neighboring ""popular"" brunch places? This place takes OpenTable reservations and the food is just as yummy and substantial --- if not more elevated!"
"Great food at a cool place with a fine list of craft beers and wines. Food: [Brunch]The Midwestern Benefit was awesome; eggs were cooked perfectly and dressed with lemony hollandaise. The only recommendation would be to eat it with a side of veggies/salad to cut the grease and starch (it's $14 and you can order a side at $5 each. My opinion is that it should come with a cup of fruit or side salad).[Lunch/Dinner] The Classic Burger was amazing; probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was juicy, nicely seasoned, and served on my favorite bun (Challah!). Service: friendly but not as attentive as I'd want it to be. The bench facing the bar on the first floor was jerky; I can feel it moving every time someone got up or sat down. It was pretty distracting and annoying."
"I live in the neighborhood. Every time I stop by Farm house I am hopeful. However, these guys are always trying so very hard with their hipster bullshit, that NOTHING is actually good(!). Take it back to the farm."
"Great place for a good meal and craft beers. Not an extensive menu, but their selective approach shows in the quality of the food. Out of a party of four, the only mentioned low point was the fish and chips. The pork shank I had was great, and the meatloaf and chicken dishes others in my party had were highly regarded.Good selection of local beers on tap, and a solid bottle selection as well. Our server was knowledgeable about the beers they had, and was able to provide direction toward, and samples of, the style I was looking for. This is one of my biggest pet peeves, servers in ""beer"" establishments that have no knowledge of beer, so our server here definitely earned points for being on top of it!We got in easily for an early dinner, but it filled up quickly, so a reservation during prime times would probably be a good idea."
"I've been here for both brunch and dinner.  They have excellent beer on tap, and you must try the cheese curds!I like that the menu changes from time to time.  All of the entrees are fairly simple, some too simple - I would not recommend the burger.It doesn't try to be over the top or too impressive, but overall a great place to enjoy good food and beer!  Be sure to make a reservation if you can as it can get pretty crowded quickly."
"I live in California but was visiting Chicago for a work conference.  Friends of the family invited me to dinner out. They suggested this restaurant based on its reputation.  We were very happy with the waitress who made excellent suggestions from the menu and even beer pairings.  The restaurant was very noisy but we sat on stools by the window, which made it cozier. It's one of those places that tourists might not know about but well worth trying.  You won't be disappointed."
"I love the idea of this place - local! The beer/wine list even has the distances listed. The interior is simple yet nice with some beautiful exposed brick. Dimly lit and very cozy..the crowd on Friday night was lively too so it made for a fun dinner.The tap list had a nice assortment of local brews along with some ones from far away.. but the real drink winner here is the mixer called Hair of the Bean. Its iced coffee, bullet bourbon, maple, and brown ale... garnished with a delicious slice of BACON. Yes, bacon. It may sound a bit odd reading this, but it was a damn good drink!I had the portobello burger and it was honestly of the better burgers I have ever had...and it didnt even have meat on it! The fries were also very good....the ketchup (house made) was even fantastic. I also split an order of cheese curds with my friend. Best I have ever had...they were still squeaky even after being breaded and fried! Yes, I have been to multiple places in Wisconsin and had curds there. These are better.The portion sizes are not huge, but just right I think. Prices are a tad pricey but thats on par with the rest of the area. Get a reservation because this place is exploding in popularity!"
"We were met when we walked in (about 20 min early to our reservation) by a friendly hostess who asked if we would mind waiting at the bar as our table was in the process of being cleaned, which we were fine with doing. We didn't even have enough time to order a drink at the bar before she came back and said the table was ready--great! She led us upstairs (didn't even realize the place was 2 stories), which I really preferred to downstairs as it was a little quieter and chill. The decor, as others have pointed out, is shabby-farm-chic which is fitting. Our waiter was very nice and welcoming. We both ordered beers which were tasty. I ordered the Amish Chicken and my husband had the fish and chips. The night started to turn south when the food came. First let me say, the food was by no means bad. Was it worth the $20 plus price tag for each dish? No. My chicken was cooked well, but the panzanella salad underneath left MUCH to be desired. It was literally tiny cut up pieces of raw squash and zucchini, which did not appear to have been marinated at all. The ""biscuit"" pieces were also crumbly and flavorless. So essentially, I paid $24 for a well cooked chicken breast. As attentive as the waiter was prior to us placing our order, he could not have been more MIA afterwards. He didn't bring out the food (which was fine), but not once did he ever check in to see if everything was as we ordered or follow up with drinks. He walked by the table at least 7 times but never came over to us. Our food was off the table and our drinks were empty as he came over to give us the dessert menu. Sufficed to say, we were done at that point. Would not recommend. We have plenty of other great dining experiences during our trip to Chicago. Won't waste time at this place again."
"First Visit was this Friday as 'date night"" with the wife, for restaurant week menu ... or that was the plan.  Envisioned something different in terms of the decor, was neither disappointed nor impressed, guess I was expecting something along the lines of the Southern's decor ... but anyway.  Hi top tables didn't do it for me, but we were basically seated in the bar I discovered when I went up stairs to the bathroom.  They have some great Gin selections, Wife stuck with the restaurant week menu, I went with the amish chicken which was absolutely phenomenal (wife had trout). The bar area is nice, except for the hi tops off the bar, pretty noisy and dark, but the food was good, definitely ail go back when it is less busy and lighter (thinking lunch), but was not disappointed."
"Kicked off 2013 with brunch at the Farmhouse on New Year's Day, and it definitely made me want to go back again to try their dinner menu. Loved the layout and the décor, and the service was friendly and attentive.We started our brunch with an order of the Beer Batter Fried Wisconsin Cheese Curds...possibly the only thing on the menu more unhealthy than bacon...but oh so good, and totally worth the guilt! (I admit, I was glad I hit the gym before brunch, though!) My nephew and I then split the Farmhouse Benedict and the Short Rib Hash for our main courses.  Both were quite tasty, but paled in comparison to the Cheese Curds, of course. (Would it be wrong to order just a huge basket of Cheese Curds for breakfast??)I'm anxious to return and check out the extensive beer list, also...so, we'll be back soon!"
"A friend and I went to Farmhouse on a Saturday night with reservations around 6:00 pm. We were able to find street parking rather easily and close to the location (which is a huge bonus)!We were seated right away at our reservation time, which I appreciate. Our waitress was wonderful, she was very informative and made great beer recommendations based on what my friend and I enjoyed. I love the concept of local products. The beer selection was great. I loved the variety. Do yourself a favor and stay for dessert and a glass of mead! I don't know many places that offer mead as an after dinner drink, so my friend and I were happily surprised. We started our meal with the cheese curds, which was a must for us. For dinner I had the catfish and my friend had the pork chops. She enjoyed her pork chops and said they were cooked to her liking. The catfish was fantastic. After looking over the menu I was pretty set on the chicken, but a the last minute I wanted to try the catfish. So happy I changed my mind! For dessert we split the carrot bread pudding, it was heavenly, especially paired with the meads we both had.The atmosphere is very cozy and the decor fit with the theme perfectly. It was a little dark in there when the lights dimmer, but not a big deal at all.I will of course be heading back to Farmhouse in the future. Maybe if my husband's lucky I'll bring him."
"The food easily speaks for itself.  There is no doubt about that.  The BLT I had was bacon lover's dream! And my husband's stuffed french toast, or whatever that creamy, buttery, fluffy creation they serve that somewhat resembles french toast is called is out of this world.  Ummmm...last meal maybe?  And this place is insanely easy to get to!  Steps off the brown line at Chicago, there's just no excuse not to give it a try.  Definitely a place I would go out of my way to visit again.  While the food could be pretentious, the ambiance, the farm-to-table casualness, and the napkins that my grandfather used to use on the farm make it very approachable.A gem, especially for brunch!"
Saw it on Check Please and decided to give it a try. It is a long narrow room with a hipster / green acres vibe. We sat in a nook across from the bar. Lots of people at the bar  it was packed by the time we left. Service was very good and the food above average. Had the fish and chips and a wheat beer the server suggested. Will go back.
"We love this place, it's very modern and old world decor makes for a really comfortable dinner.  The consistency in excellent service and quality of food is what prompted me to write a five star review for this establishment.It is easily accessible off of the Chicago Brown Line stop.   All of the people that work here are knowledgable about the menu and any question about any drink you might want to have.  The entire staff seem to go out of their way to make sure everything is enjoyable and perfect, we love Andrew he is awesome and is one of our favorite servers. They have an extensive wine selection and support local's like Deaths Door and Koval Distillery  which are appealing to us.  I have my favorite dishes and am never underwhelmed by anything that has been recommended in the year we have regularly frequented Farmhouse. I continue to recommend and refer friends and out of town guests to this place because I know they'll have a great experience."
"I'd been wanting to check out Farmhouse for a while, despite a couple of poor reviews from some credible friends.  My girlfriend and I sat at the bar for a weeknight dinner.  We ordered two salads, the mussels, and a burger.  None of the dishes were that good.  Salads weren't anything special, mussels were fishy, and burger was over cooked.We're thinking about giving it another go.  We really want to like this place given the theme and proximity to our place.  Do us right next time Farmhouse!"
"I do not have much more to add that all the positive reviews of this place haven't already said better than I could, but I still want to give this place a positive review.  Yes, it's that good!  It's good enough that there are tons of reviews telling you how awesome this place is.  That's basically like there's a crowd of people shouting EAT HERE!  And it's good enough that I'm willing to be a part of a crowd that's saying that.  This is not a great place if you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner.  For those of you who care too much about hearing other people's conversations and can't hold your own without being distracted go somewhere else...this place is not for you.  The food and service were both excellent when we were there.  I had the duck over sweet potatoes, kale, and cranberries.  Each bite was like the most excellent bite of gourmet Thanksgiving you could ever imagine.  I don't really like turkey so maybe that movie that's out right now that is about the turkeys trying to get turkey off the menu on Thanksgiving is really on to something...bring on the DUCK!  My brother had the chicken which also brought all the components of the dish together for mouthfuls of well thought out excellence.  Bravo, Farmhouse!"
"Perfect atmosphere for a Sunday afternoon. Terrific decor to match the Farmnhouse name. The breakfast flatbread is delicious, all the elements of breakfast on a perfect flatbread crust; crumbled sausage, scrambled eggs with melted gruyere, and the fresh parsley on top adds an extra fresh taste. Their spicy breakfast potatoes are one of a kind, we will crave them. We ordered the French Press coffee for two, deep rich flavor and hot refills at the ready."
"Love farmhouse!  for the beer!  for the cheese curds!  for the meat!This spot reminds me a little of Monk's Kettle in San Francisco but it's bigger and has more of a midwestern vibe.  It's farm to ""farmhouse"" style and I love places that support local growers/breweries as Farmhouse does.  Some good beers on tap and I had my first friend cheese curds here.  OMG they are so good!  My Illini (is that what you call people from Illinois?) friend Andrea who accompanied me here said they were really good too and since I never had cheese curds before, I am totally sold on them!!!The meat of the day was filet mignon and we both got that too.  I ordered mine Medium Rare and when it came out my server asked me to go ahead and cut into it to make sure it was MR. I did and it wasn't quite as pink and juicy as MR should be and he immediately offered to send it back, although it looked almost ok to me.  However, he was adamant that if I ordered it MR i should get it MR and I was pleased that he had no qualms about sending it back to get it right. We weren't in a hurry so I really appreciated the care in that move.  A great spot and my favorite meal in Chicago this trip!"
"Great atmosphere, great drink choices, and pretty darn good, fresh food. I was very impressed with the menu choices. While somewhat limited, everything looked really good, and I struggled to make a selection. I went with the burger which was very good - and the best part is you can customize your toppings, so the pickle/bacon crazed people out there (like me) get to go to town. Fries were delicious as well, and they make their own sauces (ketchup, garlic mayo, mustard, etc.) YUM.I would definitely make my way back here.Tip - make a reservation. They treat you better."
Best chicken salad sandwich and side salad I've ever had in my 25 years of living. Simple but very delicious. Massive selection of beer and drinks.
"We ordered the highly acclaimed beer-battered fried wisconsin cheese curds with alder smoked ketchup. (OMG. YUMMMMMS.)We shared a pork chop that was incredibly tender and flavorful. This won over the whole fish (I think it was trout) that I ordered. That was a bit bland and still had the bones in so I had to be careful while eating. We ordered some decadent and rich dessert and waddled out, stuffed and unable to move. The drinks were delish as well! From local beers to crafty cocktails. This place was great because they specialize in locally sourced food - everything was organic and sustainable."
"Great service, nice ambiance, amazing food. Get the cheese curds - everyone recommended them to us, and they were right. Seating (at least where we were upstairs) was a little tight, but it was quieter than downstairs, which I like. The food was very tasty, well presented, came out quickly. There were lots of fun and inventive combinations, but they all worked really well - at least everything the 3 of us tried. The desserts were fantastic. Very pleased."
"I was in from Miami and really wanted to check out the local organic food scene. This place was pretty awesome- service, quality and taste of food were all great. Ambiance was super cool. I had gluten free beer, a lovely salad, and a pasture raised burger with portabellos, house-made (I believe) pickles and local cheese.  All delicious, all nutritious. One recommendation I would have is to have gluten free buns in the house."
Fried cheese curds!French toast!Burger!Amazing.   Great service. Warning :will run. Out of popular items.
"The attitude that the staff has is not worth my patronage, especially for mediocre bar food."
"Didn't live up to the hype for us! We stopped here on a random date night and ended up pretty disappointed. We looked at the Yelp reviews and menu and thought this place must be worthwhile, but by the end of our meal, we were both pretty let down. Service: I think the service was the biggest let down for us. Our server was friendly, but distant. She didn't come around too often and she coddled the table of 4 that was right next to ours. The water glasses are short. Both of our waters were more than half empty before our food came and completely empty while we were eating. She never refilled our water. So, after she asked if we would like to see a dessert menu, I asked if we could please have more water.......I'm pretty sure this irritated her because she wasn't friendly after that......not our fault, we just wanted water. To aggravate the situation, we noticed her refilling the waters for the table next to ours and she gave them a carafe of water so that they can refill themselves. We noticed other tables had these bottles of water as well. Another issue is that after we ate, it took way too long for someone to clear our dirty dishes. However, we watched our waitress go to the table next to us about 3-4 times to clear plates, refill water, shoot the breeze, and etc. before she even attempted to clear any of our dirty dishes.......REALLY????Food: The food tasted OK, but as other reviewers have said, it's not worth the price and the portions are small. We had the cheese curds, which were ok. For entrees, I had the fish and chips and my husband had the burger. The fish and chips were pretty greasy, but tasted ok. The portion of fish was adequate, but I only got about 10-15 fries??? My husband said his burger was solid, but nothing to write home about. He had the mac and cheese, which was just ok as well. In the end, we probably won't venture into Farmhouse again."
"A fresh idea, and fun place to eat.  Who can complain about a restaurant that supports local suppliers, and with the goal of providing natural tasting foods?!?"
"My wife and I absolutely love the Farmhouse.  Admittedly I am no Foodie so therefore I'm not going to go into great detail about all the local ingredients they use to make they're amazing food.   Rather I'm just an average local who loves great food and sincerely appreciates wonderful service.We've been to Farmhouse many times for brunch, lunch, and dinner and each time the food is consistently good. Nowadays it seems that good service is tough to come by no matter where you go.  At the Farmhouse I know that we'll get friendly and professional service every time we dine there. It's my go-to place for client lunches and dinners as well as a night out with our friends.So do yourself a favor and go see Michael, Annie, David, Marcos, and the rest of the very nice people at Farmhouse."
"Ugh.  First, a quick lunch was an hour and a half deal.......after ordering only two fried dishes.  (Which should have not taken more than 5-7 minutes to get to the table) They have a sous chef, a chef de cuisine, an executive chef and a pastry chef and their menu consists of essentially 5 versions of a burger, fish and chips and a grilled chicken sandwich.   Really?  It took that large of a chef brain trust to come up with that?I ordered the veggie burger.   It came with mayo on top, which I asked that they leave off.   I thought this may be a healthy option but it was deep fried and I'm guessing the fryer wasn't hot enough because it was greasy and mush.   The fries that came with were not hot.  I ordered an ice water to drink.  They brought water.  My lunch date had the fish and chips, she liked, but they looked greasy to me.  Would not go back.   I think there are too many cooks in the kitchen."
"Tried Farmhouse with Rachel D. on a Tuesday night and had an excellent time! The ambiance is super warm, I loved the decor inside; their ""farm to table"" theme is very clear. We were seated at a high top table towards the back which I really liked, minus that the stools don't have backs. I felt like I was constantly moving around to help my aching back during the meal. Our server was incredibly friendly and helpful in recommending what to order. We actually stopped in during Chicago Cocktail Week and they had an extensive menu of craft gin cocktails for $7. I tried one with elderberry, thai basil, and other flavors, it was refreshing and delicious.For an appetizer, we had to go with the cheese curds. They were awesome and went very well with the house-made ketchup and aoili that were on the side. These come in a big portion, it would have been too much for the two of us if they hadn't been so delicious. Farmhouse's menu has a ton of great looking options, but neither Rachel or I could commit to one of the main plates. For dinner, we shared the PEI mussels, side of mac 'n cheese, and side of brussel sprouts. The mussels were prepared in a really tasty white wine broth and had plenty of sun-dried tomatoes, these went very well with the mussels. The mac was cheesy goodness, but very typical baked mac 'n cheese. Both of the sides were large portions, great for sharing. Now, my biggest disappointment in Farmhouse...I will first mention that I am not typically sensitive to salty foods. If you look at my reviews, this is rarely something I mention. However, our food at Farmhouse was incredibly salty. Like drank a ton of water during and after the meal, woke up in the middle of the night parched kind of thirsty. I know we ordered items containing salt, but this was a little cray. Overall, I'd definitely suggest it for the tasty cocktails/appetizers and the ambiance!"
"The first time my better half and I went here, the food and service were good, but not great. I had the duck, which was tasty, but a little undercooked. We didn't like that one of us had to sit right in the hallway, but it was not a big deal.We wanted to give it a second try this past Saturday. We called in the early evening to inquire at what time their kitchen closed and were informed ""11pm on the dot."" The statement seemed a little forceful, but we did not give it much thought. Having looked at their menu ahead of time, we knew what we wanted to order. We walked in at 10:35pm and were told their kitchen would be closing in 10 minutes. Strange, we thought, we had been told 11pm before, but no matter - their hostess sat us. As we sat, my g/f tried to re-assure the waitress not to worry, we would be in-and-out quickly. The waitress ignored her and walked away. Suffice it to say we did not feel welcome at that point and decided to leave.In retrospect, perhaps we were being too sensitive, but to be frank, this place is too expensive for us to go there and not feel welcome. Don't think we'll be back."
"I give two stars because we've been here two other times and it was a normal dining experience. The food is decent. There are definitely many better places for food in the city but the atmosphere is laid-back and fun. We're right down the street and we like to pop in from time to time.  Now a little anecdote:I grabbed a friend for a little catch up brunch at 12:30 pm on a Sunday and we decided to go to Farmhouse because as mentioned, it's right up the street, I'd not had the brunch there, and my companion had never been there at all.  We walked in and were greeted by a hostess that asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside, we chose inside because it was pretty hot outside to be baking in the sun. To this choice we were told for a party of two (2!!!), we could either sit outside or at the bar.  Mind you, upon looking around, there were about three tables sat in the entire restaurant and about 20 empty seats at tables around us, but a full bar (clearly, we weren't the only people that were given this choice).  A bit befuddled, I asked if there was room at the bar and after the hostess went to peek, was told, ""yes, you just have to go toward the middle"" so given that there were only two of us, we headed toward the bar....and found an open seat, two people sitting together, and another open seat. Um, wait, what? Are we thinking that the party of two doesn't want to sit together??We assumed that she meant the bar tables that were across from the bar and went to sit at one, at which the hostess came hustling over and said ""I'm sorry, these tables are for reservations."" I was literally at a loss. She made no move to assist us to get two seats together or move the stools around. And so after we'd collected our thoughts, we decided to leave.  As we were walking away, I checked Open Table to see what kind of reservations Farmhouse had and they had an open 12:45,1:00, 1:15, and 1:30 pm, so it appears that perhaps they didn't need to hold every open table for reservations.I said this recently in another review, but hosts really need to understand that they are the first impression that diners receive and they have a real impact on a customer's experience, especially setting the tone for the entire visit to the establishment. I'm certain that my friend has no compelling reason to go back and I'm definitely leery to return. I understand if there is some restaurant strategy to holding tables but why would you literally send paying customers away, to hold a table for a ""what if"" guest (or multiple tables)? In addition, the hostess' complete lack of assistance and/or interest in our wanting to dine there was especially disenchanting."
"What a perfect evening to celebrate finishing the marathon that afternoon.  We wanted somewhere that was casual, unpretentious, and still enjoy great food and drink.The fried cheese curds and pretzels were the best I ever had!  I only wish the mustard was less spicy.  For entrée I had the chicken.  The flavors were lovely.  But I would have preferred less chicken and maybe a garnish or something to accompany it.Lastly, we enjoyed pumpkin doughnut and bread pudding.  The bread pudding was the star.  So flavorful and light.  While the sauces that accompanied the doughnut was excellent, the doughnut itself was quite dense, even for a cake-like doughnut.Our server suggested wonderful beers based on our preferences.  He was wonderful and attentive.  What a great night!"
"I've now eaten at Farmhouse for every meal of the day and I have to say, it's a solid choice.  Lunch would have to be my favorite.  I love their burgers.  Brunch is a close second.  And the drinks take the top.  I love the atmosphere here.  It's great spot for a date and equally great for a group."
"Delicious food and friendly staff.  Just loved the Amish chicken and cheese curds.  I also tried one of their gin drinks and loved it!  No playing around with white meat for the chicken.  Just yummy, deboned, flavorful, and juicy legs and thigh.  I loved the crispy liver and the plating.  The cheese curds were the best I've ever had.  Light batter with chewy cheese.  Yum!  I definitely will return."
"This place was such a disappointment.   I went here eagerly anticipating a good meal.  The mac and cheese was gluey and dry, completely tasteless and the pasta was mushy.  The burger was nondescript with a stale puffy huge bun.  So gross.  Oh, and the ketchup had a strange aftertaste.that everyone commented on.  Perhaps the Evanston site is better, but I'm not willing to find out."
"So I REALLY wanted to like this place. I'm from Texas, so farm food, hearty dishes, and real country food is my jam. It's like my love language is meat and potatoes. That being said, I cannot think of a single reason to rate this place more than 2 stars. Service was slow, tables were so tightly crowded we couldn't have a conversation without inadvertently including strangers at the next table. And the prices? Ridiculous. We started with the cheese curds (decent, but they don't squeak!) and ordered the fish and chips and catfish gumbo. The fish consisted of 3 tiny pieces of greasy fish. The 'chips' were so greasy they were soggy and tasted of way too much salt and old grease. The 'gumbo' was a joke - hubs counted the grains of rice for kicks. There were 9 total. The rest of the entree consisted of a bed of wilted vegetables and a small piece of grilled catfish. This place is trying too hard. It seems trendy and was definitely busy, but it was a miserable flop. $70 later, we left still hungry and wholly irritated. Never. Coming. Back."
Very good Pub/Farm-to-Table restaurant. The fries were ridiculously good. The beer menu was outstanding even if they didn't have Allaghash (Hitachino does the trick). I made a huge miscall on the pork belly. I'm sure any sane person would have enjoyed it.Worth checking out.
"We sampled the cheese curds at Taste of River North and loved them. Sadly that is the best thing we had when dining there. I appreciate the local efforts and the atmosphere was great. However the rest of the food we had was bland. I had the cauliflower appetizer and the chicken soup. The soup was super bland and the vegetables were not cooked. My girlfriend had the hamburger medium well and added an egg... It came medium rare (like really pink) and no egg. They brought her one with an egg but it was still under done. And our server was not attentive. She didn't fill all the waters at the table in the beginning and the water jug sat empty all dinner after the rest of the table filled their own glass. The tables around us were served inconsistently, for example guests who arrived considerably after us got food/check before us. It's not as though they were busy, the restaurant was half empty. I had higher expectations for this restaurant so maybe my they were too high."
We love the food here and outstanding service
"Local ingredients, great beers, and the best cheese curds ever made.  What more can you want?"
"Service (Sam) was excellent! Food was average. The food was cooked to order, but the flavors were bland on the basic burger and the porkchop."
"Farmhouse nails the authentic decor & overall ambiance. The cheese curds were great, turkey hot brown was delicious & great staff. A must do while visiting the city."
"Well well finally found a place in Chicago that is soooo delicious and great that it makes me begging for more!! Everything about this place was perfect and straight up my alley. The whole farm to table concept is great but when it includes the wine and beer, awesome!!!Walking in we were greeted by the host/hostess and were immediately taken in by this cozy farmhouse feeling, muahaha. Hardwood floors, antique looking decorations that were cozy and eclectic in taste. We were seated upstairs where there are comfy chairs and tables. We got a seat by the window which made for some great people watching. We started off with a tomato salad and a french onion soup. Both were superb in taste and presentation. It's great knowing all your food came from nearby and it really tasted like the tomatoes had just been pulled from some garden out back. And I don't even like tomatoes a lot.Anyway~I ordered the filet which was the cut of the day while the hubby got the ribs. Both were presented nicely and tasted oh so delicious. I just wanted to keep eating!! I also enjoyed the beer selection. I was able to try a new cider from a brewery I wasn't familiar with.This is definitely a place I will be visiting again and will be telling people about. Everything was great for a date night and I just wanted it to keep going!!"
"It seems Farmhouse had a bad night friday, as upon coming back the food wasn't as good as I had remembered from a couple weeks ago. Positives: We had the cheese curds again which were amazing as usual, and our server was really nice like last time.   Also more great beers!Negatives: It seemed there was a completely different cook Friday night than the last time I was there.  Got the chicken soup again, as it was delicious two weeks ago, but this time it was heavily reduced and had bits of chicken skin in little slivers floating around in there.  Maybe if crispy that would have been good? Veggies didn't seem as fresh either this time, maybe from cooking longer or something.   Also forgot the dumplings in the chicken dumpling soup.. Then we had the fish and steak for our dinners.  The fish was so salty it couldn't be eaten.  Kind of made you not want to eat anymore after taking the first bite. My steak was cooked perfectly, but there was a big vein of fat down the middle of the filet which made 30% not edible. Had the gratin potatoes as a side, which really just tasted like a plain undercooked potato with no seasoning what-so-ever.  Salt, pepper, and possibly cheese would have made these much better.Not sure what happened, but I am saddened to think that this place became bad over night.  Maybe just a really bad night for the kitchen, but I won't be back soon to find out."
"Go here for drinks and the bar snacks, but that's about it.I took a friend here for her birthday, and I wish I would have realized how pricy it is first!We had 2 drinks, the cheese ball (total waste of time) the beet salad (super delicious, but how can you mess that up) and we split a burger that came out COLD.  Like it was forgotten about.Our waiter was a sweetheart, super great, but the food was so lacking.  My favorite part of the meal were the tavern fries and ketchup - honestly the ketchup is delicious.Great beer and liquor list - I will totally go back to hang at the bar and eat snacks and drink beer, but not for a full meal again."
"Have walked by here several times and finally had a good excuse to dine in. If you're looking for a hipster-ish joint with foodie fare and friendly service, this place will serve you well. I think we all liked what we ate. Friend got the flatbread and other friend got an egg scramble (? I think, I can't remember now). I got the farmhouse burger. The service was friendly and I liked the atmosphere. I want to say my burger was good but a little on the dry side. Originally about &13 or $14 I asked to sub my fried for a side salad and asked for extra pickles. That bumped the price to $18. Salad was good and pickles were plentiful, but I'll probably never gonna do that again as I wasn't looking to spend that much on a burger. Overall this is a 4 star joint and is recommendable but I think I'm a little sad my burger was dry and came with such an uptick in price with the subs/extras. So maybe better luck next time."
"I went here just for a beer and a snack (I'd already committed gluttony at Custom House) I don't know what beer I drank, my friend ordered it for me, but it was good. Mainly this place gets 5 stars because its got an awesome, low key ambiance (Hip without being pretentious) and fried cheese curds. I love fried food, but I understand sometimes it overpowers the actual flavor of what is within, not at Farmhouse! Their cheese curds were lightly battered to perfection.I'm definitely going back to the Farmhouse, I'll get dinner there this time!"
I had a chance to check out a few restaurants in downtown Chicago this week and was very impressed with Farmhouse. I haven't spent much time in the Midwest so I was surprised to see the amount of artisan liquors and craft beers that are locally produced. Founders and Jolly Pumpkin were familiar but there were 20 other beers that were new to me. The coffee stout by Hinterland was very good. The staff here was very friendly and helpful which is how any restaurant experience should be. And the food was outstanding. I highly recommend the fried cheese curds and the burger. The burger was cooked perfectly and the beef was very flavorful. I'd give the burger alone a 5 had it not been for the bun. The kaiser bun was just a little too chewy for me. Keep up the good work guys.Oh and the Bevador refrigerator is pretty awesome.
"Overall good food, lively/crowded atmosphere, and knowledgeable service that was a little on the slow side.Went here on a Wednesday night and got an upstairs table that was supposed to be ""less noisy"".  However, this is one of those restaurants that cram a lot of 2 seat tables next to one another in a small space, so you're literally dropped in the middle of your neighbors conversation.  (Our neighbors switched to Spanish when we arrived).  Plus, with all of the background noise, you have to speak loud enough for the person across the table to hear you, so there really isn't much privacy while dining.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, recommending some good beers from their draft list that hit the mark.  For food, the ribeye was excellent, cheese board hit expectations with a very good homemade jam, and the jerky with nuts could have been a little more jerky and less nuts, imo.  For dessert, the rhubarb pie was very good and a refreshing change from standard fare, with the homemade root beer to wash it down a nice touch.Since the place was crowded, the service was a little slow and the waiter was not able to check on us very often.  We were almost finished with our starters before the waiter came back to get our entree orders, and the drinks ran dry for a bit longer than I was comfortable with.  However, overall it was a good experience as long as you're prepared for the minor inconveniences."
"Recommended by a friend from California with his own restaurant.  Super, super good at Farmhouse!  Great brews, great folks behind the bar ready to pair the brew to the food.  Wow.  And, some guy that worked there said most all the furnishings are salvaged.......score!"
"Good place for domestic craft beers on draft, decent place for food.  If you are looking for a healthy meal, this should not be your choice only because some of the most appealing items on the menu include cheese curds, pretzels, burger etc.  All delicious."
"This place is awesome, great food, service and even better Bloody Mary.  It kind of ruins my workout across the street but it's all good!"
"My husband and I made our first visit to Farmhouse a few weeks ago and had a mostly good experience. The food was very good indeed. We had the cheese curds to start (they were so good, we could've had two orders!), and I had the catfish for my main, which was clean and fresh but maybe not earth-shattering. My husband had fish and chips because he wanted fries and enjoyed his meal. Our waiter, though it took him a while to get to us initially, was very pleasant and knew the menu like the back of his hand. His service was very good once he finally got to us.However, the lighting (or lack thereof) put a real damper on our experience. I have an eye disease and cannot see at all in low light. Our waiter brought us a bunch of extra candles, but it didn't make a huge difference. Even my husband and the people dining next to us had to read the menu by the light produced by their phones.Farmhouse staff: this means it's probably too dark."
"I came hoping they would have the short ribs. But alas, it wasnt on the menu.Got the cheese curds, mussels and the fries with garlic mayo for appetizers and ribeye for the entree. Friends had fish and chips and the pork chops.The cheese curds were indeed great and so different from other cheese curds I've had. Most cheese curds had a rubber-like texture to them and that was the reason I was never fond of them. But the cheese curds here had a newly chewed bubble gum texture to them, so much better (perhaps it was due to the fact that it was fried) Also the flavor of the curds was a but more accentuated that most others I've tasted.The mussels and fried were good, But nothing special here.The fish and chips were bland. The batter was fresh but not flavorful, even with tartar sauce and lime it was just ok.The pork chop on the other hand was good. It was cooked very nicely, not dry and the trotter demi glace gave it a nice flavor.My ribeye was probably the best entree out of the entire night. Together, the sherry wine's acidity and the ribeye along with the onions produced a unique flavor that only sherry wine could produce.Overall it was a bit disappointing, perhaps it was because I expected so much more.PS: Our waitress (Emma) was very nice and so accommodating. She even gave us a dessert on the house. The dessert (the tart with salted caramel ice cream) was good. I especially like the graham crust."
"fresh ingredients...especially for a bar :)...as a vegetarian, the ""mushroom"" is oftentimes the ""burger"" choice offered to me and i usually pass.  i'm not a huge portobello fan.  i was convinced by our server/bartender to try the mushroom piquillo pepper burger and i'm glad i did.  it wasn't quite a burger but he gave it a good description of it being similar to a falafel.  the patty was good on its own and really didn't need to be/was kind of odd sitting on a bun.  the side salad (subbed for the fries) was crisp and vibrant.  i feel sort of silly for describing a simple salad that way but you can really tell the difference between costco lettuce and fresh from the farm ingredients - i was very pleased!i was a little upset with the hostess.  i had a kiddie cocktail at the at the bar while i waited for my husband to meet me for lunch.  right at 12:30, the place filled up but there were clearly several 2-tops available.  the hostess asked if she could have the bar stool sitting next to me but i had asked if it would be ok to save it in case the place filled up (we'd just eat at the bar).  when she passed by again, i had apologized realizing that there were several open tables but she didn't seem to be concerned.  when my husband arrived a few minutes later, she promptly told him that there weren't any tables available?  i had grown too attached to my barstool to care but am not really sure why we were refused a table..."
"Poor brunch menu, the place was practically empty.  Although the food was good, I will not be coming back for brunch.  Ordered the French toast and it was very very small.  was not filling what so ever."
"Been to Farmhouse three times.  The first time was 5 star, the second time was 3 star, and the third time was 4 star, averaging out to 4 stars.  Best cheese curds I have had outside of Wisconsin and it seemed the serving size got bigger the third time I went versus the first two times which is a plus.  They always have good unique sodas for the teetotal crowd like myself as well.  I like that they use locally sourced food, so their menu will vary at times and they will have new items.  Since it is called Farmhouse, you will find heavier foods, but I usually order light entrees like grilled fish after eating the cheese curds and they've always been good.  If you do go, even if you're a health nut, do not pass up the cheese curds."
"My review will be mostly based on beer, cocktails and appetizers. I've been here for after-work drinks and appetizers 3-4 times. Their beer list is extensive and the staff has great beer knowledge. I've had their cheesecurds for appetizers and they are a must-try as many people have said. Personally, my favorite part of their menu is their cocktails. I usually order the Humdinger and I've never been disappointed. Reasons why I gave it a 4 stars, instead of 5: Prices are higher than normal across the whole menu (standard in River North) and long lunch experience (It took 1.5 hours the one time I went there for lunch, but they were short-handed). Overall: I will still come back for drinks and apps."
"Another restaurant week place. I absolutely dug this place. Great vibe, awesome drink menu (I would go back simply to get my hands on more of the Local Option Kentucky Common), and front runner for the best soundtrack to a meal award. Cheese curds were very good, although my personal preference is for a slightly heavier batter but they were very tasty. Only negative and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the meatloaf. Dry, kinda like eating a brick of hamburger. Mashed potatoes that came with it were very good. If you're listening Farmhouse, get in touch with me I have a delicious meatloaf recipe for you. I'm not a big dessert guy but it too was solid.A very neighborhoody, although upscale, place in a very unneighborhoody part of town. If you're in the area, this is a great place to hang out, enjoy the awesome beer list, the atmosphere, and the great soundtrack. The food isn't half bad either, just avoid the meatloaf."
"The last time I was here, it was just a weird night for me(though nothing weird about farmhouse) and I couldn't fully get ahold of myself to properly review farmhouse. So, I finally got myself in here for lunch. I had to have some of the food and I had a rough idea of what I wanted to drink. I got the chicken sandwich. I had mussels from here previously and enjoyed them. Well, I really enjoyed the chicken sandwich. There were a ton of fries, which wasn't a bad thing either. The chicken itself was really damn good. There was a lot of it as well which meant that the sandwich needed to be two fisted. The amount of ingredients is no joke on this, but it also tastes that complex as well. It's one of those things that I always love, take something as simple as chicken and create a bunch of great flavors with it. The beer list is very true to farmhouse's ethos of focusing on the midwest. So, I naturally had to get a hinterland oktoberfest. That accomplished both the midwest and us being in the oktoberfest season right now. There's really not a bad beer on the list and it's a lot of fun to go over. The service was really good. The bartender was easy to get a hold of and  was nice. I like simplicity+friendliness in my service and they did that in spades. Farmhouse is a place that I would venture out of my way for. It really isn't at all like one would expect in river north. Yes, there is a slight price increase because of the area, but farmhouse is one of those places that just make me want to kick back and have a few beers."
"This place has an exceptional beer list.  I had a lunch that was pretty good, but it's the beer that really stands out."
"I wanted to like this place because I strongly support the idea of locally-sourced ingredients and recycled building materials. Unfortunately, I was completely underwhelmed by Farmhouse.A friend and I were meeting there for dinner. I arrived first and, even though there were several open tables, the hostess refused to seat me as an ""incomplete party"". I decided to wait outside rather than loiter in the entry way. When my friend arrived, we were seated upstairs. It reminded me of my NYC days because the tables were thisclose together. Plus, the waiter was ... well, kind of a jerk. Aloof. Condescending. Rehearsed. I wasn't a fan of him at all.Farm-to-market restaurants tend to be mostly gluten-free, but not this place! There were only a few things on the menu that were or could be made gluten-free. Such a disappointment. I ended up getting the char with green beans. Okay, but not special or exciting.What a let down."
"I put off writing this review for a very long time (for me) because it was such an amazing meal I got a kick out of whenever I was writing other reviews and Yelp reminded me to get off my ass and write this one too. So today I'm finally caving in and singing the wonders of Farmhouse. How I loved thee... let me count the ways...1. it was easy to get a reservation (open table ftw!)2. it embraces the 'farm to table' concept without trying to make it a bigger deal than it is or overemphasizing.3. the employees (at least our server) was an obvious food lover himself and was passionate and enthusiastic.4. the 28 craft beers on tap. and the cocktails... Hair of the Bean = genius. Coffee, bourbon, maple, stout, and bacon. I could bathe in it. And then drink it.5. everything from burgers to sodas and condiments is made from scratch.6. salvaged materials, furniture and Bevador for about 85% of the build-out makes for a warm, inviting space.7. farm animals in the window. 8. chalkboard drink specials.9. mood lighting.10. the food.But of course I can't stop at 'the food' though I also don't know how well I can begin to explain the night of gastronomic delight (not exaggerating) we had here. It was honestly one of my top meals of all time.We started off with the cheese curds - how could you not - Wisconsin Cheese Curds, Alder Smoked Catsup. I pondered if we could get another order and just make a meal of these alone, but knew we had to move on.My main course was the Chicken Pot Pie Pastie: Nueske""s Smoked Ham, Root Vegetables, Wilted Chard, Herbed White Country Gravy. This was comfort food of the best sort... but somehow also high-brow. With all the food and drinks, we unfortunately did not have time for dessert (well, unless you count more drinks as dessert). But I'm dying to get back here ASAP before word gets out and I won't be able to get a reservation anymore."
"This is a wonderful place for lunch and dinner. Three of us came for dinner and I had cheese curds for the first time in my 22 years of life. One of the cons of growing up in the east coast. I don't have much experience with them, but these were delicious and we gobbled them up. I ordered the pheasant which was absolutely delightful; fresh and juicy with a crispy exterior. Four stars was possible but the portions were definitely lacking. Nothing super creative but everything is cooked very well and their standards are high. The decor is welcoming and service is great as well. Great place to meet up with a small group of close friends or just a dinner date!"
"I like this place.  It's casual feeling, comfortable citified-farmhouse tavern, nice long bar on main floor, and cute second story.  We've come twice, and the food has been good if not particularly outstanding.  The cheese curds and the duck were more memorable.  The service was very helpful and obliging, even dividing beforehand a couple dishes we wanted to share.  Nice."
"The food was excellent, if a little overpriced.  However, the same cannot be said of our waiter.  He forgot to bring out drinks (for 30 minutes), we could not find him to order, he rarely checked on us, and I'm convinced he forgot to put in our order when we made it because it should not take 70 minutes to cook what we ordered (and it wasn't even busy that night)."
"Recently, many of my followers have emailed me to ask why I haven't eaten in almost two months. Illness? A bad meal? Lent? The truth is - I just wasn't hungry. That all changed Monday night. I was very, very hungry. So I went to Farmhouse. What transpired was one of the most inconsistent dining experiences I've had in my life. Let's start with the good. The Good:-The Barn: I enjoyed the interior of Farmhouse. I didn't love it. However, I am not an interior designer, I'm a food critic.-The Livestock: I ordered a grass-fed hamburger; on it was some very good bacon. One of my companions ordered a short rib. Another ordered chicken. Some ordered fish. The chicken and short rib were well-received, but the others suffered from careless preparation. We also ordered beef jerky, which was fabulous. If you are a jerky fan, your best move is to get four orders of jerky and call it a night. Next, I am going to talk about  the bad.The Bad:-The Well: There were about 15 local craft beers available. I didn't try them all, but the ones I did try were average at best. I lived in Wisconsin for many years.-The Farmhands: The staff were polite and friendly. Their service was awful. It takes a lot for me to complain about nice people, but incompetence was everywhere. Our six entrees arrived in pairs, five to ten minutes apart. One entree was forgotten. I mentioned earlier that I ordered a grass-fed hamburger (check The Livestock section of thisreview). The menu calls it the ""Farmhouse ""Classic"" Grass-fed Burger"". When you go to a locally-sourced place like Farmhouse, and it is serving $15 grass-fed burgers, you can expect a correctly cooked burger. I ordered mine medium-rare and it came out well-done. A long time ago, the Great Chicago Fire started on a farm and proceeded to overcook everything in its path. Another farm is threatening to do the same. Its name is Farmhouse."
"Wisconsin Cheese Curds + Mussels + Beef Short Ribs = A GREAT DINNERI'd recommend this place to carnivore and anybody who loves a good gastropub. We came to Farmhouse on a Yelp recommendation, looking for a new place to eat. We were very impressed with the service at the host stand and at the bar, the hostess has a sprinkling of courtesy and we appreciated it. This place does get full, but the bar is always available (personally I like sitting at the bar whenever I can for faster service).Don't forget to try there strong beers! Food and beer is so good I can't wait to repeat this experience!"
"Having recently returned from California I have learned a few things.  We are approaching a point in Chicago culinary history where there is a mass proliferation of gourmet burgers and good craft beer married into one venue for all to drool over.  Farmhouse take a different spin on this because everything is sourced locally!Shop local! Get your eats at Farmhouse! If you would have told me that a locally sourced burger would knock the socks off of some of California's most renowned burgers, I would have scoffed at the notion. Stopping by around 9pm on a Thursday, we found Farmhouse to be crowded but were still able to be seated upstairs without having to fight our way through it all.It was quaint and the tables had a rustic feel being carved out of wood with maybe a layer of stain. A friend ordered the fish, the other three of us went to burger town and I had mine with some smoked gouda and bacon, a decision I would not regret later.We ordered cheese curds, beer battered and with a saltiness that screams for more we suddenly went and ordered another batch of these magic miracles. While crunching away I had a stout of some kind and enjoyed it while our food came out in quick order. The buttered bun worked its flavor and I don't know what they spice the burger with but it was fantastic. Smoked gouda was tasty and cheddar or bleu cheese would have also been good but the gouda was what I needed. Bacon was crisp and smoky and even the lettuce sourced locally was a revolution from standard burger garnishments.The best dessert was certainly the pudding and we found ourselves plowing through most of the desserts even though we admittedly weren't all that hungry. Farmhouse? This is not your average spot and the locally sourced aspect of it means you get to support the Midwest!"
"Great theory, mediocre execution.  The idea is locally sourced reasonably priced food, however the food itself just wasn't that amazing.  My bloody mary was so thick that it was more tomato smoothie than cocktail, and I ended up pouring my whole beerback to thin it out (it helped!)  I ordered the Buiscuits and Gravy (Country Venison Sausage Gravy, Fresh Baked Sweet Potato Biscuits).  I felt that there wasn't enough sauce, and it didn't taste at all what I would expect sweet potato buiscuits to taste like.  I had a very heavy, dense grain flavor to it, which made it both the wrong texture and wrong flavor combination with the gravy.  I will say that my fellow dinners enjoyed their meals more than me, so I would definitely come back and try something different, but as it stands, there are so many excellent brunch joints in Chicago, farmhouse does stand up to the competition."
"Chicago virgins, Last night after marathon weekend...simply sold on the farm animal window decals on Yelp photo.Drink menu was Stellar, lonely Shepard, the swing, pumpkin ale...yum!Service, excellentJerky & nuts went well with our drinks, deep fried cheese curds, salty, and perfect with cocktailsShort ribs were tender and rich, Mac n cheese, just the right amount of cheese and creaminess...Then sadly dessert arrived and my 5 star review took a turn south. Maybe cuz I'm a pastry chef and I'm a being a bit too harsh? The desserts menu read well...too well perhaps...the apple walnut pie to bready...the pumpkin toffee cake, just dry and boring.Overall, I really loved this place, just wish the desserts could have provided a happy ending to a fabulous trip!Btw...""darling #4"" will def be back for a second try :)"
"An update to my last review; savvy business move not to mention classy, Aaron, the GM, contacted me to remedy my previous visit. And so we gave it another try; delighted we did. Not only did we get everything we ordered, our server Jessica was friendly and attentive. This go around we had the roasted beet salad again and let me tell you, so good. It was lightly dressed with the honey grain mustard that all the other flavors came through perfectly.The cheese curds were love in the form of fried cheese. The mussels were hearty and the grilled bread perfect. I do miss the original preparation which I think had an orange zest to the broth but none-the-less tasty!  Lastly, the grilled steak with creamed spinach in a red wine sauce and paprika butter was a treat to the taste buds, seriously, butter on steak is like the mother ship calling me home. We substituted the gratin for the smashed potatoes and with all the savory flavors we had taken in, this was a good call! So Farmhouse, thanks for reaching out to this girl and bringing her back in. You'll find me bellying up for more soon!"
"I was in the mood for a light lunch, so upon my server's suggestion, I ordered the Roast Beet and Rocket Baby salad + grilled chicken on top. My friend had the White Fish sandwich and Tavern Cut chips. We agreed that the ingredients were very high quality and the cooking was clean and fresh, which made sense considering the decor.When walking into the restaurant, I noticed right away how local food plays a big role. Artistic portrayals of the Midwest states were on the exposed brick walls and the menu boasted numerous craft brews and artisan ingredients from each of these states.The add-on of chicken was not an option on the menu for my salad, but the restaurant accommodated willingly. It was seasoned well and juicy. The sweet roast beet complemented the salty-toasted walnuts and creamy, tangy goat cheese. I LOVED the honey grain mustard vinaigrette because of the unique texture for a salad dressing and the combo of sweet and acid worked well. The greens were crisp and gave a good bite in the background - I also like how it's a more unusual choice.In the end, I'm not giving this restaurant five stars mostly because of the price. For the price of my dish ($10 +$4 for the chicken) and the price of my friend's dish ($11), I did not think the meals were the best value based on the paltry portion sizes."
Unimpressed.   2 people ordered the burger & mentioned that it was the worst burger they have ever ordered.  Yikes not a good comment to have shared.  I had the fish and chips and they were tasty but the batter was a bit on the heavy side and a the dish was on the pricier side  Communal tight seating where your neighbor may or may not leave you enough space to enjoy your meal and the bar stools don't have a back so not very comfy.  Step it up as you have a great name.
"My husband and I went to Farmhouse for brunch on a very cold, snowy Sunday.  I love the space and the warm, cute decor.  The place was pretty empty (probably due to the terrible weather) and so we were seated immediately. We had to wait a good 10 mins+ for someone to bring us water and take our drink order.  Typically when you wait 10 mins or more just for water, it is a reflection of how the service will be for the rest of your meal.  To my surprise, this was not the case.  Our server, Marcos (I think), was very friendly and turned out to be very attentive throughout our meal.  He was also very passionate and confident about the food and drink they served there which was refreshing.  This usually comes across as up-selling but he seemed genuinely excited for us to try the food and drink we ordered.  I thought he was very pleasant and he really turned my mood around after being annoyed about the wait time in the beginning of our visit.The drinks were a hit.  My bloody mary was very good and my husband was very happy with his beer selections.We were boring as far as food choices went and both of us had the Farm Egg Scramble (mine with sausage, his with bacon).  It was pretty good!  Nothing special but it definitely had good flavors and was something I would order again.  I was pretty annoyed at how much food was on the plate, though.  It was literally so full that I couldn't stick my fork in it without something falling off onto the table. To make matters worse, there were two slices of toast balancing on the top of my heap of eggs, sausage and potatoes.  I had to ask for a side plate to accommodate the overflow.  While I appreciate the generous portion, no one wants their food spilling all over the table.The biggest complaint I have is with the seating.  We were at one of the tall, two-person tables in the middle of the restaurant across from the bar.  One side of the table has a stool, the other is a cushioned bench along the wall.  I sat on the bench and it was very very uncomfortable.  The seat portion of the bench is about three inches too short and there is no bar or anything to rest your feet on (which leaves the edge of the bench cutting into the back of your mid-thigh).  My legs fell asleep twice during my meal.  I really recommend adding a bar or reconstructing the bench to be the proper size.  I heard the two girls on either side of me make comments about it as well, so I am confident that the awkward size of the seat is noticeable.Overall, my experience at Farmhouse was decent.  I would go back and try it again.  I've heard great things about the burger so I would like to check it out for myself and it's always refreshing to see a good, craft beer list."
"If the food and drink weren't so great then I wouldn't be back.  The interior is not good.  I met a friend here right after work.  We got a 2 top in the area that's in front of the bar.  The table texture is not conducive for putting things like drinks on it.  Its a textured sheet metal?  Also the bar has purse hooks but in the table area you're on a backless bar stool.  You're crazy if you think I'm putting my handbag on the floor!  So some design flaws that make my experience a little less desirable.Our waiter was great.  He was just attentive enough and gave us a lot of info on the menu and the gin drinks.  The menu is seasonal so if you're picking things out from the web site they may not be there anymore.  Do not fret.  They've got you covered esp if you were thinking about a chocolate dessert.I tried 3 of the gin drinks and they were superb!  And I'm not a gin drinker!  My friend and I shared the muscles for a starter.  We loved them.  They had fennel, and orange and an unexpected but welcomed kick of heat at the end.  Perfecto.  The bread for dipping was super fresh.I had the mushroom burger with goat cheese.  The fries were thin and crispy and had skins on them.  Yummy!  I know that's a lame main but I was saving room for dessert.  My friend had the braised pork and said while it wasn't the best that she's ever had it was tender and delicious.Then something weird happened.  My friend showed up so she stood at the side of our table and ordered a drink.  The couple that was at the table next to us left so we grabbed a stool.  We were like that for awhile.  Then a lady comes over freaking out that she needs to seat people next to us.  I'm not sure what the deal was because there was room.  All she needed to do was find another stool.  I hope that she was not suggesting that we give ours up!!  So to appease we scooted our table a little bit over to give them more room.  It was quite odd.Friday after work gets crowded and is very loud and lively.  If you're sitting with your back to the bar, as I was, then expect to be bumped into.  No biggie for me but I did see a guy who made his date sit on the bar side (why would you do that??) move her over to side saddle like my friend who came late was doing."
"I have a couple of friends who spoke highly of this place so maybe I came in on an off night. It was OK, but of all the great places in Chicago, I wouldn't recommend it to others.  I am a very big fan of farm to table and restaurants that strive to use fresh local ingredients.Granted, we had a quick and simple meal - one glass of wine and the entree.  I had the chicken which was an ample portion.  The problem is that the menu listed as roasted...but it was almost to the point of being fried.  This made it very dry and not so good.  The barley and  demi glace were very good.  Probably a little pricey for $26.The service was  good - at times a little slow - but we were in no hurry.Overall, I think that there is better in Chicago..."
"The drinks are good, the food is great, but the service is what makes it 5 stars. I made a late reservation on a Friday evening for me and an out of town guest. When we arrived at 9pm, we were informed that unfortunately our table was ready. Yeah, that blows, but the front of the house went above and beyond to compensate for that. Free drinks at the bar while we waited, and a manager stopping by twice to assure us that the table was coming. Impressive--that's how you take care of your customers.Once seated upstairs (it really wasn't that long of a wait, and we really didn't mind), the drinks/food/service was impeccable from start to finish. Despite the fact that I live here, my beer knowledge is really confined to the Northwest and West Coast. Boy's knowledge was confined to East Coast. With that in mind, our server (dammit I wish I could remember his name because he ROCKED) made excellent recommendations, catering to our beer preferences. I went with the trout for an entree, boy with the steak, and both were pretty damn amazing. (But really, let's be honest. I was most excited about the homemade ketchup. I ordered a side of fries solely as a vehicle to try the ketchup. Boom)By 11 or so, the upstairs had completely cleared out, and we stuck around, drinking and chatting with the server and the manager. They must have a policy of hiring great people, because it shows. The crowd was a bit more trendy than I expected (I was thinking it was pretty casual), but I think that just may be because of its proximity to River North nightlife and the fact that we were there on a Friday evening.Overall, it's a great space and a great concept, and I love what they have done with it. It's exactly what River North needs, and I'm excited to go back."
"The best compliment I can give Farmhouse:  I probably have taken a dozen different people here in the past year, and every single one of them couldn't wait to return.The food is rustic, locally sourced, and reasonably priced.  What's not to like?  The beer and cider list is phenomenal and also mostly local.  They typically have a couple of rare items on tap that you cannot get anywhere else in Chicago.  You could come here just for the drinks, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice.  I always get at least one small plate, usually the beet salad.The staff is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic, which often is not the case at this kind of restaurant.  Located right next to the brown line with ample street parking, and not too far from the Mag Mile.My only criticism is that sometimes the food is seasoned unevenly--too much salt on one dish, far too little in another.  Got to keep an eye on that."
"The cheese curds are AMAZING. Great sauces that come with it. Everything there is farm to table. Very fresh and healthy.I had the farmhouse scramble and I didn't like it. My friend got the eggs benedict which was awesome. The staff is great and really friendly. I don't think I would go back though for the price and the taste, just didn't hit the spot."
"Yumola.This was kinda like the Minneapolis restaurant Spoonriver, but with a twist of molecular gastronomy.  The craft spirits were very impressive.  Super delightful pink gin and tonic.  Really well chosen booze.  Love the selection of beers.Cheese curds were outstanding and melt in your mouth.Mac and Cheese rad as hell.  wow.Flatbread addictive.  Fricken desert........baked Wisconsin....their twist on a baked alaska obviously, with a little dried fruit powder on the side...really well put together desert.  Nice coffees..of course... new roaster I had not heard of ""Big Shoulder"" or something like that..will have to look them up"" and Intelli.Bartender at lovely Hotel Felix suggested this restaurant....really good suggestion.Service was attentive and fab."
"Great place, easy to make reservations (I'd recommend getting a table upstairs, as downstairs is even louder). Our server was friendly, helpful, and kind. Good whiskey! Tasty food! Great ambience."
Been here.  Straight.
"Cannnnot wait to go back again.  I've been waiting nearly two years to visit this place, and I can't recall why it has taken me so long.  Once you get past the awful construction going on in the front (but it's Chicago, so what are you gonna do), you're welcomed by this homey, non-chalante... farmhouse.  It's much smaller and cozier than I had imagined.  That midwest hospitality saturates every crevice of this place whilst maintaining the Chicago flare.Lovvvved the staff.  Alex and Sean know their beer!  All I did was mention some of the beers I loved and hated, and they were able to offer me a sample of a new fav - Furthermore Make Weight.Once they sat us down into our nice little corner, our server (erg, I wish I remembered her name, b/c she was absolutely adorbs - blonde hair) spoke intelligently about the menu, allowed us to take our time, offered tons and tons of beer samples, and was able to shoot the shit with us.  Maybe it's in the name, maybe it it's in the vision itself, but they blew the farm-to-table trend, that is sweeping across Chicago, out of the water!  It's simple food done well.  I had the mussels.  Melt-in-you-mouth for sure.  My only wish was that I could've swapped the bread for the veggies instead.  This place is definitely not for the calorie counter.Even the check presenter was absolutely adorbs.  Nice and neat in a little book.  Everything about this place was considered and was very intentional.  Honestly can't wait to go back."
"Recently, I've been to Farmhouse for brunch twice.  Farmhouse has a small but substantial menu.  Cheese curds are the best I've had.  Eggs Benedict was good.  Burgers great.  Pork sandwich was a delight.  Great service.  Atmosphere is warm and inviting.  I'll be back!"
"Last minute reservations, pre-theater, on a Thursday night led us to Farmhouse.  My expectations were tempered...and then exceeded.I'm from Wisconsin, so cheese curds are not a novelty to me.  That said, Farmhouse does them quite well.  I would say an ""A-"" in that category, only the ""-"" because there are one or two places I can think of where they are slightly better.  The spare ribs were quite good:  well-seasoned, nicely presented, and an appropriate portion.  The sides were a little unremarkable, but fine.  Service was excellent and quite jovial."
"This is a great place for a drink/appetizer, but not a full mealCome here for only 3 things: deep fried cheese curds + the beer selection + customer serviceDo not order anything else off the menu because you will be as disappointed as I was. Regardless, this is a 4 star place if you stick to my menu recommendations.The deep fried cheese curds are plenty for 2 (or 3 who just want a few ). The garlic aioli that comes with it is just heavenly."
"What a find! This may well be my new favorite brunch place in all of Chicago! The service was impeccable and every bite of food delicious. The beer-battered cheese curds are out of this world--unbelievably light and delicious! I had the farm egg scramble with sausage, and it was phenomenal. The eggs were moist and flavorful, and the sausage patty clearly made in house. We also had the short rib hash, which had root vegetables cooked to al dente--so unique! The cocktails were perfect and the local beer and wine list very impressive. We will absolutely be back!"
"Quite the cute spot.  The soft lighting contributed to a casual atmosphere and the exposed brick and salvaged furniture went well with the farmhouse vibe.  I think it is great that this place is made up mostly of salvaged and recycled materials.  Aside from that, they also only source locally or within IL, WI, IN, and MI.  Pretty cool.  We were greeted right away and the friendly bartender took our drink orders almost immediately.  After that though we had a hard time even flagging him down for glasses of water...and it wasn't even busy.  Good selection of wine and beer on tap.  They also have wine on tap.  I am a huge fan of this concept but was disappointed with their farmhouse red blend on tap.  It was a little overpriced and it tasted a bit watery.  Like many others, we tried the cheese curds.  I liked the light breading and the cheese was melty.  Didn't care for the ketchup-like sauce.  It had a weird smoky flavor to it?  Others may like it, but I don't know.  I like a basic ketchup with my curds.  Overall they were tasty but not sure I would trek up there just for them.  I would give this place another try if I'm in the area."
"Yes, I agree w/everybody else here and do recommend the fried cheese curd.  Everything else I had that night was lack luster.  Unfortunately, I'm not a drinker.  They had beers on tap up to the wazoo."
"Looks cool, sounds awesome, feels hip, but the actual food does not deliver. Pairings and mixing of ingredients leaves dishes too tart, too salty or too fishy. Not worth the money or the hype. Server was great though, we left a good tip."
"I saw this restaurant on Check Please - all 3 people loved it, so I decided to check it out on Sat. Nov. 22.  I had a reservation for 2:45.  I got there at 2:30 and was seated which was fine.  Then, everything fell apart.  I ordered a bottle of cider which they were out of.  I saw rave reviews about their food, especially the cheese curds - not!!!  They weren't cheese curds at all - all they did was fry mozarrella cheese - not cheese curds I had expected - Culver's were better.  So, we ordered food.  Much to our dismay, we were told they only serve the Brunch menu all day Saturday & Sunday - no lunch or dinner menu - which was the second disappointment.  Proceeding - I ordered the eggs benedict and my husband order the burger - Terrible - the eggs benedict were served on an overtoasted (almost burned) English muffin with krakus ham lunchmeat, an over cooked poached egg (it was basically hard boiled) and about 1/2 teaspoon of hollandaise sauce that you couldn't even taste.  The burger was worse - as we were expecting a nice fresh, burger cooked to liking, it was like a frozen patty that was over cooked on the grill.  A great disappointment for $50.  Never again."
"I freaking love this place.  Delicious, Midwestern food... farm-to-table concept.  I'm seriously confused by any of the negative reviews here.  I've eaten here three times - 1) Date with the bf - 2) Lunch with a friend/colleague - 3) Dinner with a prospective client... all three times have offered unique experiences that feature delicious food and local drinks.  Items that I personally recommend; raspberry beer (can't remember the name, but if you like a light, slight fruity undertone to a beer... YUM), cheese curds and pork chop (cooked w/ chef recommendation) sooo good.  I don't even like pork chops, but this is really fantastic.I also work in River North neighborhood, so I hope this place continues to innovate their menu and stay around for a long time!!!  Yay! I'm a fan."
"**** 1/2I adore this place. The only blip Saturday night was that we had an 8:00 reservation and didn't get seated until around 8:45, possibly even later. The staff was really apologetic, but they were overbooked and we paid the price. Kindly, they brought our large group complimentary cheese curds and they graciously handled our separate checks without a complaint. They were also WONDERFUL about working with my and my food allergies. I'd mentioned it when I made the reservation and our waiter had it in his notes when we were seated. They made a special salad dressing for me and could not have been more attentive. Chef even came out to ask the table (and me specifically) if everything had been okay. Our group was thrilled and all expressed interest in dining there again. (I reviewed them on 5/17/12 and have eaten there nearly every time I'm in Chicago.)"
"It is a good thing I don't live near here. Arrived early for our 7PM reservation and they were able to seat us. Wasn't sure how I felt about the tables when we were first seated - ours backed up to the bar and the stools had no back so it wasn't the most comfortable or spacious.My attitude changed when our waiter greeted us and we immediately started talking about different Brooklyn Brewery beers we enjoyed once he heard we were from NY/CT. Started out with the cheese curds - holy yum! We seriously contemplated ordering more they were so good! For something fried they had a lightness to them!For entrees we both got the filet mignon with brandied mushrooms and truffle fries. I love truffle. My steak was perfectly rare and a very decent portion for the price, about $26, I think. Most places in the east would be a la carte for over $40 for this! Also loved that it was grass fed! The fries were hot, fresh, and crispy, just how they should be!Mac and cheese was the only disappointment of the meal - seemed to be an afterthought, a little on the bland and watery side.Loved the beer menu, they just added a bunch of gin cocktails which were also delicious. And beer cocktails? How fun. I tried the hairy bean - iced coffee, stout, bourbon, maple bacon syrup, and a piece of bacon. It was different, in a good way! For dessert we shared the farm bar which was again, delicious. Reminded me of a much crunchier compost cookie from David Chang's Momofuku Milk Bar in NYC.All of these food/drinks were reasonable - 2 drinks each, 1 app, 2 entrees, 1 dessert for about $140 with tip. I love Chicago!"
"We took a chance and came here for Restaurant Week and I have to say it was exactly what I was looking for. I personally enjoyed everything about my experience. I made a reservation through Open Table for Saturday lunch and was accommodated when we arrived early. We were seated upstairs near the window which offered great natural lighting and it really fit the motif (it was almost planned that way).Our server, Jonathan, was very friendly and had great suggestions for both food and beverages, so we were pleased with that. The fixed menu included a three-course meal so we both had the salad (instead of soup) and I had a patty melt, and there was a dessert. Salad: Not a huge 'order a salad' kind of guy, I usually eat them at home. I can dig starter salads though. This one was for the books; great layers, nice elements, great dressing. Everything was incredibly fresh (hence the philosophy of the entire restaurant) and I found myself slightly embarrassed for wolfing my first course. I should mention the salad had greens, cucumbers, carrots, green pepper, candied almonds (I think...they could have been honey roasted) and my favorite part, dried cherries. Melt: I'll admit that I read reviews before checking out the Farmhouse and I have to say that there are a few I agreed with and a few that I did not (and didn't quite make sense). But I'm glad to report that my opinion is correct so if you read this review, you don't need to read others, this is your one stop shop. Alright seriously, this melt was awesome. Marble rye, medium-cooked grass fed beef, Wisconsin cheddar, and onions. I'm salivating this very moment. The fries were equally as impressive and very delicious. My dish was cooked perfectly, the cheese was melty, and the flavors were all there. I'd have a tough time going back and not ordering the melt.Dessert: When I thought it couldn't get any better, they brought out dessert: Toffee/caramel bread pudding. Holy cow. I recently jumped on the bread pudding bandwagon, and I'm very happy that I did to enjoy this dessert. Delicious pudding topped with cream, toffee bits for a sweet crunchy texture and slivers of dates. Needless to say I cleaned my plate...they didn't even have to wash it.If you couldn't tell I loved the farmhouse and would like to go back. It's a little tough because I'm a suburban Yelper but I would gladly make the trek. I have been in the neighborhood many times and it would seem like a perfect chance to check out the galleries in the area and then eat at the farmhouse. Gotta love restaurant week and the new opportunities in dining which it lends itself to."
"Excellent!Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning. Service was fantastic and they were very friendly. I had the benedict and it was great. Also ordered a blueberry muffin that was divine. It was fresh baked for me, and came with a great lemon marmalade on the side.The atmosphere is great, loved the interior design. The lunch/dinner menu was extensive and looked amazing, will have to go back and try the next time I'm in town.If you're looking for a great brunch place, this is it!"
"I have been wanting to try this spot for awhile and I am glad I finally did!  I had the Grilled cheese with pork belly and a side of tomato soup.  The sandwich was the bomb, but can you really go wrong with three cheeses and an healthy dose of pork belly?  Nope.Good, not great, selection of craft beers and I chose the dreadnaught double ipa which was stellar.Atmosphere and service was great. I am already plotting my return for dinner."
"I gotta start out by saying I absolutely love the decor in this place. Technically, I'm a farm boy first and a city boy second, so anything that tries to even remotely emulate the good ol' country, I'm all about it (that sounds pretty hick, I know.)This place is not too far from my work, so when we're feeling the need to break out of our bubble, we head to new, adventurous places, a.k.a. restaurants that take longer than 10 minutes to walk to.I've been here on a couple of occasions and both times it was extremely crowded. I'm not quite sure what the overall attraction is at lunch time besides the fact that it has a trendy name and there's not much else around.  But don't expect to roll in anywhere during the lunch hour(s) with a group of people and get seated in a short period of time.I tried to get past it by ordering multiple items, but overall the food was pretty salty.  The cheese curds are tasty, but the sandwiches tended to have more salt than Angelina Jolie in a high-octane, government action thriller (get it??)They make their own pop (or soda as you might incorrectly say) which is pretty solid and the beer list is not too shabby.  They also serve your check in a Farmer's Almanac which, I have to say, is a pretty classy touch.It's nice to go here every once in a while , but I generally emphasize the ""once a while"" bit."
"Everything about this place is wonderful: food, drinks, service, staff. I came here after work to have a drink while I got some work done. They have free secured wifi! So nice to enjoy a beverage after a work day and getting more work done NOT in the office. I ordered the Hair of the Bean...Oh....my....goodness. This is in my top 5 cocktails. It has iced coffee, bourbon, maple, stout, and bacon. I love all 5 of those ingredients separately, and together, it was heaven. The bacon perfectly complemented the drink like a medium-rare porterhouse and cabernet. I wanted to order another, but switched to beer so I could be coherent during dinner.I ordered the trout. The trout was perfectly deboned and kept in tact. Cooked spot on, moist, tender, and flaky with a crisp salty skin. The accompaniments worked well with the fish, too. Vegetables were not overcooked.The service was great. The bartender made good recommendations and the staff is friendly and personable. I would definitely go back! I need to try the cheese curds and I want another Hair of the Bean."
"I've now eaten brunch or dinner at this restaurant over 10 times, and the quality of service, food and value have remained consistent.  Last night, I had the pastie, while my wife had the short ribs.  As it was busy, we ate at the upstairs bar, where Cicero provided excellent service, despite it being his second night.  The beer selection is outstanding, with lots of local brews.  In any case, Farmhouse is a winner."
"I was really impressed with Farmhouse.  The farm-to-table concept was well executed, the menu (both food and drink) were great and the service was fantastic.  Like everyone says, it's small and busy, so arrive early or make reservations.I arrived before my friend so I sat at the bar for a drink.  The list of local brews is overwhelming, so the bartender asked what I normally drink and made some recommendations.  He let me try a couple samples before I found one I liked (a refreshing rye beer).For dinner, our waiter was really knowledgeable about the menu and helpful with suggestions.  My friend is not a gin drinker (you'd never guess since they don't show the cocktail menu online, but this is a gin-focused bar!  There are about 30 kinds of gin on the shelves.  YUM!) so he made some suggestions that she really liked (Martinez and something else smokey).  I tried the drink with yellow chartreuse and the Gin Claude Van Damme.  Both were delicious.  She finished with a boozey rootbeer float that was to die for.  Save up your calories for this one!The food was really yummy.  We both really enjoyed the plump mussels in spicy citrus beer-based broth.  Both the citrus and heat were unexpected and delicious.  We polished them off in no time.  I had heard good things about the shortribs, and ordered them.  So tender.  They were cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth.  The flavors were good but not the best I've had, but I don't think I'll ever have anything more tender.  My friend had the grains burger, I didn't hear anything good or bad about it except for her rave reviews about the fries!  We ended with what they call their version of the Whatchamacallit? which tasty too.A note about the space - it's hopping with activity.  We were seated at a little table with backless stools next to the bar, which was a little frustrating for my friend who kept getting banged into by patrons.  It's loud so I wouldn't recommend for a date, but it was a nice girls' night out.  One other note - it's a pet peeve of mine when the online menu does not reflect the current menu.  I love seasonal menus and am happy for fresh, local ingredients, but when I'm looking forward to something I saw online and it turns out they don't have it anymore, it breaks my heart.  Please update your website!"
Good brunch menu and good bloody marys - they use McClures mix. Reccomend the cheese curds for an appetizer. Good food all around and good service. Nice atmosphere and was quiet
"Absolutely fantastic.  High quality yet simple food without snobbery.  Had a great glass of merlot here, but since I failed to ask the name of it, I have no idea what it was."
"Farmhouse was a comforting meal in a warm and inviting surrounding.  We came here before the Illini game at the United Center and at least the day started off great!I had the homemade Ginger Ale but it was really GINGER Ale.  I absolutely adored it, the Ginger was outstanding.  We then split the cheese curds and Mac n Cheese Fritters. I was sortof annoyed we split them because I wanted them all for myself.My daughter and I shared the Fish Sandwich which I found mushy and the Chicken Club which was good.  I then had the Chocolate Pastie for dessert which was really just grease and chocolate, not that I don't like those two ingredients but they needed more pop to them.I would come again and repeat the first three items I reviewed but I don't plan on sharing them with anyone!It's a cute place, you should check it ou!"
"I was looking for fresh comfort food and Farmhouse delivered.  I had the fish sandwich.  I liked it but, would have liked a slightly larger portion.  The beer list was great and my husband ate his mussels at light speed.  I didn't get to the mussels quickly enough but I did taste the sauce.  Tremendous.  We were searching the table for more food to use as vehicles to get the sauce to our mouth.  So good.  For dessert I had the bread pudding.  It had good flavor and a huge portion.  I just wish I had asked for ice cream."
"Walking in on Saturday night, they didn't have tables open, but did clear a spot at the bar big enough for our group of 5.  The decor is industrial vintage, which more times than not comes off gimmicky, but their attention to use of - rather than just displaying - the vintage pieces, gives it a genuine and unpretentious feel.  Upon sitting down, we were greeted by the head bar waiter who was abrasively sarcastic, and quite funny. Both he and our barmaid/waitress were both extremely good at their jobs, fast at answering questions, and were prototypically Chicago - hurried, nice, ironic and engaging.  Starting off, the menus were comprehensively laid out on clipboards, making the wine, beer, and food easy to navigate. The beer selection was outstanding, and the craft beers were organized by state - even by mileage away from our current location.  For someone who loves to have the most local beer possible whenever in a different city, this was perfect.  Our bartender allowed us to sample several of the beers before we made our choice, which was especially useful for the non-beer snobs in the group (basically everyone but myself).  We ordered beers and then split some cheese curds, which were excellent. They were accompanied with the home made ketchup.The menu featured quite a few intriguing items, but I settled on the burger because I rarely if ever get a burger anywhere anymore because most beef is so sketchy.  They promised here, however, locally grown grass fed beef, which I felt made my decision a no-brainer.  The food came out in a reasonable time, just as i was diving into my second delicious craft beer.  The burger was one of the best I've ever had.  It was prepared medium-rare upon my request, and had a delightful flavor. Accompanying it were delicately seasoned fresh cut fries with several dipping sauces for both fries and burger - all made in-house.  My group all enjoyed their individual entrees, and we felt satisfied. I could have stayed there for another beer or three, but I had been fed two imperial beers - an IPA and a Stout, so it was time to say goodbye.  I will definitely return, however, next time I come to Chicago.  From atmosphere, staff, decor, beer and food, this place is one of the better that I've visited in a long time.  Do yourself a favor and try it out."
"Got there on a Saturday night after making last minute reservations via Yelp and Open Table. The place was surprisingly empty for 7:30 (and for a place with such good Yelp reviews), and so we thought it was especially strange that the host tried to sit has at a cramped table, upstairs, all the way in the back, near the kitchen. When we asked to move, the host asked my friend, ""Have you been a good girl today?"" That weird and slightly uncomfortable exchange aside, the food was pretty good. Deep fried cheese curds. Amazing. Hands down the best I've ever had. They were light and fluffy, with pockets of air. The farmhouse burger was good. I asked for it medium, it came out medium rare, which was fine. They do nickel-and-dime you with the toppings. Lettuce, tomato, and onion are included, but the cheese and other additions are $1 each. I ended up borrowing some of the dipping sauce from the cheese curds to liven it up, although they did provide some BBQ sauce with the burger.  The accompanying thin-cut fries were SO SALTY.  Definitely too much salt, so it's good they offer a fantastic beer selection."
"I often get the question ""been to any good restaurants lately?"". Clearly people don't realize how little I get out with a 1 year old. However, in the past week I've had an enthusiastic answer for this question. ""Yes, Farmhouse!"" I took one look around Farmhouse when I first walked in last Sunday night and was immediately a fan.  It's inviting, cozy...and nothing like it's Bar Louie predecessor. As always I did my Yelp research ahead of time so ordered the cheese curds right away.  My party of 4 also ordered their chips with the dill dip and beet salad to start. All were amazing...those cheese curds are a must. Chicken isn't typically my 1st choice, but at the waitress's recommendation decided to give it a shot. It turns out chicken would be my 1st choice if other restaurants made it this good. I ate every last bite and loved it all. Unfortunately, this left no room for dessert, but probably better for the waistline. Beer lovers will be very happy here as well, but I was quite satisfied with my glass of riesling.  The overall service was a tad on the slow side, but amazing food more than made up for it.  Go now, but perhaps make a reservation first because they were pretty full for even an early Sunday evening."
"Oh no!  I was 0-2 for restaurant week visits on Friday after my Farmhouse dinner.  I hope that we just visited on a bad night - as there are so many good reviews.  I'm just sad I didn't get to experience what everyone else must have.  I was so looking forward to Farmhouse...and shout out to Amelia B for letting me know that the cheese curds were delicious as this was one of the better parts of my meal.Visited for an evening reservation on Friday.  We only had to wait a few minutes, so we didn't have the issues others had with seating.  We even ended up at a prime table upstairs.  The atmosphere is really the best part of this spot - it's warm, lively and just a really nice space overall.  I really liked the pitchfork as a door handle on the way in.  A definite 5 for atmosphere.On to service.  First of all, let me state that the reason I visited during restaurant week was for the restaurant week menu.  However, when we were greeted, our server let us know that the dish I wanted (the trout) was already out.  ON THE FIRST DAY...ok, I'm all ok with fresh food, but I was really disappointed.  So...the chicken didn't interest me, so we decided to order from the regular menu.  We shared three appetizers (2 were specials) - cheese curds, duck flatbread (with blue cheese, balsamic and fig), and oyster sliders (minuscule sliders with apple smoked and fried oysters, beer barbecue sauce and coleslaw).  Our server was great until he didn't hear us order a main entree.  He asked us ""aren't you going to order entrees"", to which we replied, 'no, but we'll order dessert"".  Our previous 5-stars for service switched to 4 after that as we seemed to get less attention.  So...the food....  First of all, the timing was a bit off with all three apps showing up at the same time (not what we asked for).  As to taste...the cheese curds were delicious, but a bit greasy (I know...I know, they are cheese!).  I could have done with extra ketchup on them...we got a tiny little container of about 1mm of ketchup.  The flatbread, while ok, was a bit dark in the crust, and the duck was not identifiable as duck.  The oysters were supposedly in a quantity of 3...but they were 6 absolutely minuscule bits of oyster.  Taste-wise, this was probably the best item, but so tiny and not enough bbq sauce and coleslaw.  I think the execution could have been better as a larger sandwich or on a lobster roll type bun.  I was so looking forward to the fig bread pudding, not only because of the excellent reviews, but also because I love figs.  First of all, the salted cream was inedibly salty.  I love salt...but this was like salt water - absolutely awful.  The dish wasn't warm and the bread pudding tasted stale with figs a la fig newtons....not fresh figs.  We told the server about it and he only said that it should be salty...and I like savory/sweet combinations but this was seriously not edible.  He didn't seem to care that we were disappointed (so, service to a 3 from the 4 above).  With the pretty good appetizers, food goes to a 2.Bathrooms were pretty good - a 4.Value for food is good - a 4."
"Fresh from the farm it is. If you've been eating processed food for a while and have forgotten what fresh, organic, real food tastes like, come to Farmhouse. After a few visits, I have to say that absolutely everything I've tried has been outstanding. The chicken dumpling soup is wonderful, the whole thing is made fresh when you order it, even the dumplings, there's no pot of soup sitting back there in the kitchen. I know because I asked the bartender and that's what he told me. I've also had the chicken BLT which was fresh and delicious. But my favorite on the menu so far is the Farmhouse classic grass-fed burger on a grilled kaiser bun served with fries. Awesome burger, seasoned and cooked well and didn't make me feel overly full after eating the whole thing. Fries are the kind where you can't just eat one, or 10. Cheese curds are good, but don't feel obligated to order them, they're just basically fried cheese balls, so perhaps you'll want to save on the calories. There is a price to pay for the freshness, the food is a little slow to come out of the kitchen. Service has been good for the most part. There's a bar area upstairs, the main level downstairs is on the small side. Cute farm-appropriate decor. Great beer selection. Everything from IPAs to seasonal local beers and everything in between. Farmhouse will be herding me back soon."
"This review is only for brunch.  I went on a Saturday between 1100am and noon.  There were probably about 25 customers at Farmhouse, so it was not crowded between the two levels...we were one of three tables on the 2nd floor.  The service was good.  Coffee was solid.  Two complimentary mini scones were a nice touch.  I ordered the Short Rib Hash.  There was hardly any short rib in my portion and the vegetables were hardlycooked (I think they were supposed to be cooked...especially the onions).  The eggs were overcooked too, as the yolks were supposed to run over the hash and they were about 90% cooked and as a rsult, they did not add their intended effect.  The wheat toast and butter were very good...but they couldn't save the meal.  This plate off eggs, veggies, toast, and a tiny bit of beef was not worth $13.I have a feeling Farmhouse just gave me a badly prepared version of what is normally a very good dish.  I'll try to come back and give them another try but for now all I can give them is 3 stars..."
"This was a great restaurant with extremely friendly and helpful staff. When they didn't have a drink that we ordered they brought out an house-made basil cucumber soda for free, which was an unusual blend of flavors that quickly grew on you (surprisingly). When I couldn't decide on which beer to get they brought me out a miniature flight to try a few beers. They definitely have a good local beer selection.The food itself was very good, as long as you're into meat, which I am. I got a farmhouse burger with blue cheese on top medium rare. They brought me a burger with Gorgonzola on top (not a problem at all, technically Gorgonzola is a type of blue cheese, but I think its distinctive enough so that I consider it a separate entity. Even so it was extremely good, just wasn't what I was expecting) that was cooked medium. This slight change from what I was expecting didn't end up mattering much as the burger was amazingly tender. The mashed potatoes were a little over-garlicky for my taste, but still quite good. Before we started on our dinner they brought us out some house-made potato chips with a brilliant, subtle dill dip. This is a great place to go for a casual dinner with friendly, young staff. Its a little on the expensive side for a purely casual dinner but the quality of food is worth it. It didn't quite merit 5 stars but it really deserves a 4.5."
"Awesome. Love the fact that they try to source all of their ingredients locally and the fact that their menu changes constantly.I came here on a recommendation from a coworker, since a travel to Chicago and eat out often. Please visit this place. The food was incredible, our server was pleasant and attentive, and the prices were extremely reasonable. Try the cheese curds as an appetizer."
"I have learned a very harsh lesson in Chicago.  Chicago LOVES dressing.  See my reviews on The Florentine and Grahamwich.  And by that, I mean they love to douse a surprising amount of dressing on salads and sandwiches which is both unnerving and impolite.I went to Farmhouse for lunch with colleagues.  I ordered the beet salad which sadly had small and few beets but boy oh boy did they put the tangiest mustardiest dressing ever known on a beet salad, so much it made me uncomfortable and hungry.  I only ate the beets and called it a day.  I will never order this again."
"I'm sad, I love farmhouses, I love to eat animals that live on farms, I love places that take stuff from farms and make them awesome. Unfortunately Farmhouse didn't.I came during restaurant week and 3 out of 4 of us go the restaurant week menu.I started with cheese curds, entree - short ribs, and desert - bread pudding. The cheese curds were mediocre, super hot, but the batter didn't have a ton of flavor leaving on greasy gut bomb. Wisconsin would be sad. Short ribs are my absolute favorite, but these were a disservice to the poor cow, pretty dry despite being braised. The bread pudding was good but nothing too memorable. I'm giving them a 3 because service was pretty solid, the ambiance was cool, but the food laid a goose egg.  Despite this, I may check it out again because restaurant week is well restaurant week..."
"I don't know, guys.  Something just didn't sit well with me my second time around at Farmhouse.  Yes, I enjoyed my meal after my first visit that much that I thought it would be fun to recommend it to a different posse of buds for a dinner out on the town.I called to make reservations, which was fine, but when I called a few days before our dinner to see if we could increase our table from 8 to 9, the host was VERY rude.  He shot me total attitude saying, ""Well, if it was a Friday or Saturday there's NO WAY I would ever help you.  But I guess we can work it out for a Wednesday.""  Um, OK, buddy.  No need to get testy.  Just trying to bring a large party of drinkers/eaters into your establishment.While the cheese curds were still tasty as ever, the mac and cheese bites were not.  The lack of flavor in the mac and cheese combined with a weird BBQ sauce on top didn't sit well.  And actually, neither did my mussels this time around.  My tummy was not so happy.  We'll leave it at that.  I'm not going to blame Farmhouse because two other people at our table ate mussels, too, and they seemed fine, but I don't know... I had a serious reaction.Service continues to plague Farmhouse.  Food took FOREVER to come out.  Our server, while very nice and friendly, was very absent.  My gal pal put it best, ""If I would have needed something with my dinner, I'd be upset right now.""  Word, girl.  Word.So yeah... I think I'm off Farmhouse for now.  It seems like they need to really get into their service groove and they're just not there yet.  I really like their concept and some of the menu items.  And let's be honest: The Humdinger cocktail is up there as one of my favorites in the city, so I know I'll be back eventually.Another note: Please get rid of those stupid, uncomfortable high top tables.  NO ONE wants to sit in a backless metal stool for the better part of a two-hour meal.  NO ONE."
"Our experience at Farmhouse was great all around. We had a reservation for 8pm on a Friday night and were seated immediately at an upstairs table. I love the vibe of this place--the wood tables, low lighting, and personable staff. We ordered several bottles of wine for the table and all were pretty cheap--I want to say less than $30 each. The meal kicked off with the flatbread of the day which was arugula, pork belly and blue cheese and it was honestly to die for. By far the favorite thing we ate the whole meal. The rest of the food was also solid, albeit slightly less memorable. We ordered short ribs and a pork shank, both of which were really tasty and well-prepared. The wagon wheel mac and cheese was the only lackluster item for me, but I will admit that I'm not really a mac and cheese enthusiast so it may be just me. I would absolutely frequent Farmhouse again and would not hesitate to recommend it."
"I have been to Farmhouse three separate times, so its time for me to write a review. The wait staff has always been in a good mood, which is a big plus for the ambiance. All three meals were enjoyable. I will say that I was disappointed in my last visit as they only appeared to be seating people on the main level. This meant sitting at a ""high top"" table. These tables are incredibly small & with the decorations they place on the tables, little room for drinks & your plates. Overall, its a solid restaurant, just make sure you are clear about where you want to sit if the place is not busy."
They do the whole farm to table movement.  They take it seriously.  The food is good here-I love the side of brussel sprouts instead of french fries!  Fish is good and so are the other dishes.  The beer list and many of the spirits are all local too.  It's not a huge space and can fill up in a hurry.
"I only save my 5 star reviews for the best of the best, but Farmhouse isn't far from that distinction. It's located in River North, but, thankfully, isn't REALLY part of River North.The service here is always top-notch, their food very tasty, and the drinks creative.It's easy to get a reservation and very cozy (albeit a bit noisy) inside.Highly recommended for a place to go for a casual dinner or a date night."
"Incredible. I was giddy throughout my meal at Farmhouse. Our meal started off by sharing the cheese curds, which are all kinds of amazing. I'm not at all sure how you can take cheese, fry it, and still somehow have a final product that is light. I expected that they would settle like bricks... not the case. You'll still have room for your meal (if you split them anyway).I had the braised short ribs, and it was spectacular. Salty, a little sweet, and fork tender-fall-apart goodness. And paired with a a great beer? You can't go wrong. Save room for the sweet stuff! The toffee bread pudding was the perfect ending to our beautiful meal. Warm, comforting, and not too sweet. Perfect for sharing as well. The staff was so friendly and seemed very enthusiastic about the various Farmhouse offerings. Just a fun and beautiful meal. I can't wait to go back."
"Good food, bad atmosphere. We were seated upstairs, packed in in a row of very close seating. Forced to listen to the tables next to us screaming at each other the entire meal, because the acoustics are TERRIBLE. I couldn't hear my husband, I couldn't hear our (kinda snotty) server.Food was good, but probably doesn't warrant these AMAZING OMG-OOZING REVIEWS. We had the cheese curds (hot, fried cheese. Where can you go wrong?), the mussels (good, spicy), the short rib (purty tasty), and the whitefish (good, but the pork belly was rubbery). A'ight!"
"My friend and I decided to come here for an early dinner - and boy we were not disappointed.  I am a fan for many reasons - the first may be because you are supporting local business owners since all of the food is locally sourced. So you can eat well and do good at the same time.Now the other real reason I am a fan is because of the Wisconsin Cheese Curds, Alder Smoked Catsup, Tavern Cut Potato Chips, Fresh Dill Dip, and the Maple Margarita. Oh my goodness, these things combined is disaster for your sanity and your diets. Everything was crafted with love and happiness and I was a happy recipient. We also had the Grilled River Trout which was tasty, but had nothing on those cheese curds.A bonus is that its steps from the Chicago Brown line, so you can easily drink to your heart's content and then walk the area OR get back on the ""L"" and get to your final destination.Can't wait to go back!"
"Came here for my anniversary dinner with the husband.  We are all about the concept of this place...farm to table, craft beer and quaint setting.  It satisfied all of the above.  We enjoyed a few appetizers (mussels and a salad) and then split an entree.  It was all good.  Nothing stand out but good, better than average let's say.  The ambiance was on point and our server was also on top of her game and very knowledgeable on the food and beer menu.  I won't go out of my way to come back but if I am in the area and hungry I will definitely stop in."
"Came this past Saturday for lunch and left pretty impressed. First off, our server was great. Not only was he very friendly, but he was very knowledgeable about their beer list. We had a hard time narrowing down our decision so he brought over a few taste-sized beers for us to try based on what we were in the mood for. I had the ""Trippel"" pork belly grilled cheese with tomato soup. The pork was a little saltier than I like, but then again it is pork belly. The three melted cheese brought a nice tang to the sandwich and with the tomato soup, it was a perfect pairing. The soup was topped with a couple of fried onion straws, which I've never seen before, but it only added to the great flavor."
"I went here last night at 6:30 for a meeting with some BU alumni (the owner's wife went to Boston University!) and was blown away by the decor, the food, the service, and the crowd! We were seated right away and ordered the cheese ball and cheese curds to start. I absolutely LOVED the sharpness of the cheese ball. I didn't try the cheese curds cuz I'm still dieting, boo, but they were devoured by the other 4 people at the table so I can definitely say they were delicious. I ordered the hamburger with a fried egg. The egg was cooked perfectly as was my medium rare burger. The fresh mustard was a fantastic accoutrement. Other things ordered were the chicken soup and a beet salad. All of the ingredients are sourced locally so we felt really good supporting Midwestern farmers and artisans!!!The beer selection is out of this world, especially if you love local brews from places like Bells, Two Brothers, etc. There is also a very nice cocktail list. Now I definitely want to go back when I'm no longer dieting so I can try their beer float. That's right. Not root beer. BEER. Oatmeal stout with vanilla ice cream and bourbon. Sounds right up my alley.I should also mention that all of the decor is recycled and rehabbed from junk yards and other warehouses in the area. It's very rustic and really fees like you're in an antique farmhouse. I loved it! Cozy, warm, a great place for a date. Just be sure to make a reservation!"
"I'm torn between 3.5 and 4 stars.  I attended an event during my first visit and was very impressed, particularly by cheese curds.  So I wanted to go back the next day.  Unfortunately, during my second visit, while cheese curds were just as good as the first time, I was not impressed by much else.    The mushroom burger and smelt sandwich were certainly good, but nothing overly special.  But I have to rave about The Mad Botanist gin cocktail.  It was superb!  I will certainly be back for cheese curds and gin cocktails."
"I came here for Easter brunch with a few friends. As soon as we sat down at the bar, the bartender Alex gave us samples of beer to try and made us feel instantly welcomed. I can definitely say he made our brunch experience there a great one! He kept telling us jokes, as he was also a stand up comedian. The food speaks for itself-hash, egg scramble and cinnamon rolls are amazing! My Bloody Mary was super spicy and delicious, along with the beers Alex recommended our group.Definitely coming back here soon!"
"I love this place!!! I love that the cheese curds have a light coating, which is crispy enough, but gets you straight to the point: the melted cheese. The amish roasted chicken here is probably one of the best chicken dishes that I have ever had. So succulent and juicy. The chicken soup with dumplings is a light, delicious soup that they make TO ORDER for everyone. Great. The pot pie. I'm not a pot pie person, but this is on another level. really flaky, delicious crust with a filling that highlights the ingredients (not just an nondescript mush), and a very flavorful sauce. The fig bread pudding dessert with toffee was out of this world, and that is said as a non-lover of desserts. I enjoyed this thoroughly. Throw in a few great cocktails (the humdinger, a fragrant little number is my fave), and beer list that is a beer nerd's paradise, and this is a truly wonderful dining experience. The owner, TJ, is so warm and friendly, and will tell you all about where the food (and even the decor!) comes from. Can't wait to come back!!!"
"A Bevador and fried Wisconsin Cheese Curds with some smoked ketchup.  I dig it.  Their Bevador is pretty cool, which looks like a nuclear fallout steel nuke, which is basically a refrigerated lazy susan.  A lazy susan that holds 500 bottles of craft beers.  I recently tried the Three Floyd's Jinx Proof.  Good stuff.So back to the cheese curds.  The fried cheesey nuggets are delicious.  A perfect beer snack and could eat those all night.  The fries were tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I also tried the Amish Chicken and Beef Short Ribs, which were both solid.Bar seating was only available on a weeknight, but I didn't mind.  Faster access to beer.  They have a great selection of craft beers, plus a cocktail list that sounded pretty good.  The bartenders were friendly and the service was great.I enjoy places with good food and beer."
"Welcome to River North, Farmhouse!  (we needed you!) I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here today, and was so happy to check this new place out and learn about their eclectic salvage-heavy interior decorating.  We were told their pride and joy is their awesome, circular, old metal beer cooler behind the bar, which they found somewhere in the city and revamped to use as a modern day cooler.  I appreciate the unique, oldschool finds this place has incorporated into their space.  SO much more character and charm than your run of the mill new cookie-cutter bar/restaurant.  My group of three started with some of their house-made sodas (cherry-thyme & cream soda - very tasty, light and refreshing) and their cheese curd appetizer (big hot hunks of fried cheese with a nice dipping sauce - what's not to like?). My entree was the whitefish sandwich:  Soft brioche-style bun, nice big portion of fried fish topped with melted cheese, lettuce, tomato + onion, served with a saucer of vinegar sauce and house chips.  Really good.  The best fish sammy I've had in a while!  The other diners ordered a chicken soup, beet salad, and the chicken sandwich - all of which got a good response.  This place has a great looking beer list.  I'd love to return for dinner to try more of their food and get some good beers.  Food was great, service was great, and I really like what they did with the space.  I shall return!"
"Fantastic.  My girlfriend and I went here during our day trip into Chicago.  It's a little off the ""beaten path"" and is a decent walk from the Magnificent Mile, but it's well worth the trek. We were not disappointed...except in our stomachs for not having more room to order more food!  They get their food from regional farms, and have a menu that changes.  There were a lot of great options, but we opted for the fish and chips (which was amazing) and the Amish Chicken, which was also amazing.  We left stuffed, satisfied, and wishing we could go back for another meal. It was a little on the expensive side, but most restaurants in Chicago were...They have communal tables in some parts, but we got there before the rush and had our own table.  Once the crowd built up, it got a little noisy, but it was still a great atmosphere."
"Lovely dinner there tonight! The cheese curds, as suggested by other viewers, are divine - incredibly light, but still retain a touch of curd "" squeakiness"".  I had the  world grains burger, which is unlike any veggie burger I've ever had - the outside is a crunchy panko style crust, but the inside grains  are a creamy, risotto like texture- like a particularly decadent and light potato pancake. The brioche is unnecessary, but delicious, and the addition of goat's cheese was perfect.  ( the egg add-on was perhaps not needed, but hey, extra protein for us veggie types never hurts)  The house mac, in an era of  doing the most mac & cheese was expletive inducingly delicious.  My companion enjoyed every bite of the Amish Chicken, although it was a considerably smaller plate. We chose the sweet potato cake with  blood orange sorbet, lemon curd,  & candied bacon crumbles at the server suggestion that it was the "" best bite on offer that night"".  It was interesting, with individually delicious components, but all got a bit lot together. The Chocolate Espresso Mousse with cherries and flourless chocolate cake crumbs however was insanely decadent and HUGE, in a small mason jar - it easily could have served two people who like each other very much (who won't squabble over bites) or one particularly indulgent person.The drinks were expertly prepared, and showcased a vast array of locally sourced spirits. I'm not a fan of bar stool style seating, so I was glad we'd arrived early and could secure a booth for just the two of us ( I'm sure later diners wouldn't have had the luxury without a larger party)All in all, great Chicago spot,  where casual diners can enjoy first class food."
"Went there on a whim just because they had pheasant on the menu - we were pleasantly surprised by the whole experience! A great bottle of Sauvignon blanc ( which they finally found after our cheese curds were already devoured) went perfectly with the pheasant and my trout. I do wish our server had suggested a side, but bringing us some bread was greatly appreciated. Try the bread pudding with French press coffee - the perfect end to a nice meal."
"I ate here one year ago and loved it, so was a bit surprised by inconsistency this time around. Mixed drink was solid, nothing special but then again they are known for beer. Flatbread was just bad,  which you can't get away with in Chicago given its on most menus. Overbaked to the point of almost being burnt on the edges, and meagerly dressed with pulled beef, goat cheese, a few peppers, and a dijon sauce that was a bit too sweet. Dessert was the best part of the meal, a rich bread pudding with salted caramel ice cream. The wait staff were five star- everyone was both friendly and intelligent, and most importantly didn't treat me like I was weird for being out alone on a Saturday night. (Its called business travel, people)"
"Wow - I never thought I'd love fried cheese curds so much.  I was here for a conference and looking for a craft beer place downtown and came across this gem on yelp.  The price was reasonable, so my boss couldn't throw a fit when I expensed a bunch of beer along with my dinner and the food was local and unique. A lot of great craft brews from Illinois and surrounding states (including an awesome sour), which I could never find on the East Coast.  Along with the cheese curds for the table, I ordered a cheese plate and salad which were both delicious.  The cheese plate came with candied hibiscus, which was a unique touch and something to make it stand out from other gastropub cheese plates.  My friends also enjoyed their Trout and Bone-In Pork Chop (which I will admit did look amazing and had I known this colleauge for more than 4 hours, I would have asked for a bite!).  The staff was friendly (did not seem put off when one of my colleauges accidentaly broke a glass vase on the table), provided good recommendations on beers, ciders and food and allowed us to take our time, depsite it being a fairly busy weeknight.  Ambiance was urban-hipster, yet warm and friendly."
"Best servers in Chicago.  They are friendly, knowledgeable, and offer great suggestions.  Definitely the best service I have received in a long time.I returned to Farmhouse eager to try their dinner.  Our waiter was full of suggestions, which we followed.  We started with the fried cheese curds - which were not has heavy and greasy as one would expect.  They were popcorn sized nuggets that melted in my mouth.  For entrees we had Short Ribs and Roast Chicken.  I love that the entrees include potatoes and vegetables.  The portions were a hearty size, and I managed to eat almost all of it since it was so tasty.  The chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside, and full or flavor.  The short rib was tender and slathered in sauce.I will absolutely be going back."
"I just came back from this place and loved it, let me tell you why.1. Upon walking in, you can really feel that everything is reclaimed. It's comfy, it's cozy, it's real. It's also small to, so for those of you with big parties, consider going somewhere else. This is a great spot for a small table or just a casual lunch with a friend.2. Our bartender/waiter (we ate at the bar) was really awesome, funny, and polite. We also had a manager (I believe) come by and check on things and when  our food came out before our cheese curds, he immediately went to check on everything and we got them immediately.3. As someone who jus read ""Eating Animals"" I'm becoming increasingly conscious on where my food comes from, so I was incredibly relieved that products were listed on the wall, on the menu, and on the website. This place clearly has nothing to hide and in fact, they are proud of the places they obtain their ingredients from. I find this invaluable.4. It's so close to where I live and work, double bonus!5. The menu is great. The food was even better. I was really happy with what I ordered (I got the veggie burger if you must know) and was even secretly eyeballing my friends orders as well.So... I think you should go!"
"We stopped in for beers and snacks mid-afternoon and enjoyed this new find so much will be back for a more substantial meal, and more beer. We sat at the bar where service. Both bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable of the beer selections. There is a large selection of beers on tap from Illinois and surrounding states. Do try the cheese curds, they are excellent. Fries are also yummy, the skinny kind with the skins on, served with a garlic mayo.We will definitely return to this cozy place."
"Here is Yanyao's guide to having a good time at Farmhouse:1) Make reservations, or have awesome friends that do. This place is pretty small and was totally packed on a Tuesday night. Once word gets out, it will be even more packed. 2) Look for the barn animals! If you walk into Bistro Voltaire, you have gone too far. 3) Drink the Humdinger cocktail. 80% of our table was drinking it after sampling mine. Or, opt for one of the many beer choices - on tap or bottled. 4) Bring friends with appetites and order at least 4 starters. I will go ahead and rank them for you now:i. CHEESE CURDS. Do I really need to say more? Actually, get 2 orders of these.ii. House chips with dill dip. I love these chips so much that I would crush them up and snort them. iii. Mac and cheese fritters. A fried ball of noodles and cheese?! I must be dead, or dreaming. Nope. Still alive and very much awake.iv. Cheese ball. Most cheese balls pale in comparison to my M.I.L.'s cheese ball, but this one was very good.5) Order the chicken. I know, I know... chicken? Really Yanyao? Have you become THAT boring? But seriously, this is a beautifully roasted half chicken - juicy, succulent, with CRISPY skin. Served with a mushroom and frisee salad, buttermilk blue cheese mashed potatoes, and rosemary corn vinaigrette. CORN. VINAIGRETTE. PEOPLE. I'm told this dish is a labor of love, and you will taste this love in every.single.bite. 6) The ""Not a Brandy Alexander"" will get you drunk. More desserts should involve ice cream + stout + bourbon. The lemon and almond bread pudding with macerated blackberries will make you comatose... in the best way possible. It you want your eyes to remain open, it is a dessert best shared with friends. 7) Take the CTA here. Farmhouse is located directly by the Chicago Brown line. There are also buses and cabs. You will want to drink at Farmhouse.8) Take public transit home. After multiple drinks, food, and dessert... your head may swirl and all your blood will have rushed to your stomach to aid with digestion. Do not operate any heavy machinery.9) Remove any restrictive clothing (once at home).10) Pass out. Sweet dreams everyone! ;)"
"Wow! Went for lunch with my sister and not only is this place SO cute the food is just as good. They also have over 30 beers on tap mostly local!! The Waitress, Allie or Abbie?? was super funny, friendly and helped up with the difficult decision of what beer to choose!"
"Went here for a celebration dinner on a Friday night.We had reservations for 815.  I walked in at 815.  They said to head to the bar for a beverage because it would be awhile.  Wholly moley this place was packed....the bar-every inch was taken.  The problem was that you couldnt even stand behind the people sitting because that was the walk way for patrons and servers to get through so it was a bit of a cluster.  By the time I was able to get the bartenders attention to look at the beer/drink/wine list, our table was ready.So its definitely tight quarters in this place.  Almost communal dining because your table is so close to the people next to you....wowsers.Our server, Andrew was pretty good and he went through the whole spheel about the local stuff, which was actually really neat to hear.  We werent in the mood for beer so we decided on wine....although I definitely want to come back for beer and bar food soon.We started with the beet salad and the cheese curds.  Both great.  The cheese curds were really good.  How can you not like fried cheese!  HAHA.  The menu is small and I really didnt know what to get so we looked to Andrew for suggestions.  We ended up with the trout and the short ribs.  Both again were good.  I went with the ribs because thats what he said :)  I think that in general, I am just not a huge fan of ribs.  Good but not fantastic to me.  It was just the right amount of food.  Since it was a celebration, Andy (we started improvising with his name after awhile) talked us into dessert....he said that the bread pudding was great so we did that and the ""Not a brandy alexander.""  Bread pudding was good....(my favorite is still at Markethouse...weird, I know) and the ice cream drink was STRONG!  It was good but whoa!Overall, it was a good little spot to get a bite.  I liked it.  Jam packed to the brim on a Friday night.  They have a little chalkboard where it shows how far each of the items is from...ie I think the trout was from 83 miles away...kind of cool."
"We came here for Restaurant Week, as we were looking for somewhere we had never been.  This was a solid choice, although it may not be right for everyone.  It is a restaurant/bar and is loud.  The tables were mainly high tops with stools.  Our server, Andrew, was helpful and energetic.  He gets an A+++++++, as he would be an asset to any restaurant with his great attitude.  They have food and drinks from MI, IL, IN. and WI.  My cider was great, and my husband tried two types of gin that he enjoyed.  The cheese curds and jerky were great appetizers, and the amish chicken stole the show for entrees.  The bread pudding was a good finish.My only complaints:  a long wait between the entree and dessert and how loud it is in this place.  Additionally, Farmhouse attracts a younger crowd, so BEWARE if you not 25 (which I have not been in quite some time!!!)."
"Farmhouse has a Bevador. What, you say? You don't know what a Bevador is? Ha! Well neither did I until I walked into Farmhouse, the newest reincarnation of this old Bar Louie space on Chicago Ave. A Bevador was manufactured in Buffalo, NY back in the 1930's and is a cylindrical cooler (looks a little like a space ship) with lazy Susan type shelves that hold up to 500 bottles of beer. Cool, eh? What else is cool about this space is that all of the decor came from salvaged from old buildings in Chicago. Look around and see what you can find; the hostess stand is some kind of an old steel cart, the walls in the bathroom old tin ceiling tiles, and if you ask nicely, the bartenders will point out pieces here and there that have come from old bars in Chicago. But decor aside- what I liked about this ""Midwestern Craft Tavern"" is that all of the beers (and there are plenty of them, 28 on tap, the rest in bottles) come from Illinois, WI and MI. And they even have a Michigan wine on tap (a little warm in temperature for me but okay with an ice cube in it!) And all of the foods are locally sourced, along with in house made burgers, sausages, condiments and sodas. We had the cheese curds to start (light breading- nothing like the ones you get at a some sports bar in town) served with some really great catsup. For our entrees- my friend had the burger, served with a choice of cheese and I had the half of chicken based on our server's suggestions. While the burger was good- the chicken was delicious, boneless with a crisp skin and served over a bed of blue cheese mashed potatoes. We didn't save room for dessert but there was a bread pudding and a root beer float on the menu that were calling our name! Service was good for a place that has been only open for 2 weeks as of this writing. The bartender, Scott went out of his way to find me a beer that I would like, and our server, Stacy was quick with suggestions. Dinner for two, with drinks ran about $60 with entrees in the $13 - $18 range. Parking is pretty easy as well along Chicago or Franklin. Oh, and make a reservation for while this is a bar, the space is small and you will want to sit and linger awhile.It's a little hard to find on Chicago Ave, but the best way to explain it is it's right by the brown line or just east of Franklin St.as signage is minimal. But if you look for the chicken and cow graphic posted across the front windows, you'll know you are in the right place. And the right place is just what Farmhouse is!"
"This place has delicious burgers, delightful cocktails, lovely atmosphere, and very pleasant service. I really don't have too much else to say about it. My favorite drink that I've had here is called ""the swing,"" but I also enjoyed the bourbon-y seasonal one I had last time I was in."
"Was here last night for a delicious meal.DECOR: I'd consider this industrialist country chic, I guess. The lighting is dim, there are many mason jars about (but they still give you a regular glass for your drinks), and there were a lot of fresh flowers near the bar.SERVICE: Staff is extremely knowledgeable and willing to walk you through their menu. The menu, I suspect, can come off as a bit confusing for first timers, so once we admitted that it was our first time, our server explained how to ""navigate"" it. She helped me order my drink, which I really appreciated, because she had to walk me through the four gin drinks and compare them.DRINKS: Apparently, they are known for their craft beers and their gin drinks, so I tried one of each. I tried the cheaper of the gin drinks, as well as a black ipa called G.F.Y. that was delicious. My cocktail was also yummy, but it seemed like I finished it in 5 minutes, and I think there was just too much ice in it for my taste. Don't be stingy, guys. Come on.FOOD: I ordered the half amish chicken, simply because of the delicious sides it came with: brussels sprouts (gets me every time) and pecan gruyere cheesy sweet potato grits. SO GOOD. I wish I could have had more of those grits. The chicken was also good - very tender. But really, it was all a bout those sides for me!Overall... hipster central, fun and intimate decor, can be extremely crowded at night on the first floor, delicious locally sourced food."
"The food here emulates the concept this tavern tries to have. Cheese curds were the best I've ever had. The trout tasted as if it were just caught. Fresh, farm to table. Reasonable portion size, too. Def left full!The ambience was REALLY loud...aka impossible to hear anything the first time I came here. I think management responded to the plentiful reviews that said this as the music was def toned down when I returned 2 months later. Either way, the food here does not disappoint!"
"Came here on Restaurant week to check out their restaurant week menu and ended up wishing that I just ate off their regular menu. I Think if I did that, I probably would have given more stars.Their burger looked epic (which I did not order), their mac n' cheese was delicious! (pin-wheel pasta lets you really load up on the cheese and it didn't have the weird iron skillet taste like the iron skillet mac and cheese from lillie q). But also, I didn't order that. Because neither of those things were on the RW menu.What I did end up having... that I truly loved... was the Sarsprarilla soda. which was SO GOOD that I'd even go back there again just for that.The best thing off of the RW menu was the toffee bread pudding dessert, which was magically warm and gooey and delicious. TRULY loved it. I vaguely remember the salad which I thought was delicious and would eat again, but I don't dream about it after the experience or anything. Don't get the chocolate pasty- that was a disappointment... lol.But BIG PLUS to their friendly wait staff! And they've a great selection of beersOverall, my first experience didn't blow my mind but I'd definitely love to give this place a 2nd try."
Good Food. Fun Vibe.
"Have been wanting to check this out for a while, as I like supporting farm to table establishments. I had the (beef) burger and fries, which was tasty, but did not knock my socks off (they also have a veggie burger).  The coffee was EXCELLENT (random fact). Really nice assortment of teas, if you're into that. The craft cocktail and beer menu looked amazing but I didn't drink that night. I would go back for that and also to try a main dish, just to see if the burger was maybe not the best option on the menu."
"We came for restaurant week with our daughter. We opted for lunch and were excited to try it. They sat us earlier than our reservation, which was great. They were soooo nice.  We sat upstairs and were the first ones there. Our waiter was great. He was very friendly and we loved his energy. I encouraged the hubs to get something off of the brunch menu instead of the restaurant week one. Their brunch looked great. But we both opted for the restaurant week choices. I wasn't thrilled that we would both get the bread pudding since that would be my last choice of desserts. I got the salad to start with nuts and dried cherries  in a citrus vinaigrette. The hubs got the tomato soup. The soup was delicious. The salad was ""meh"". Nothing special. I got the chicken sandwich with Swiss, mustard, and bacon on rosemary ciabatta. Served with fries. I thought it was very tasty. But just a chicken sandwich. The ketchup for the fries was interesting. Not as tangy or savory as ketchup should be. Hmmmm. I saved half of my meal and ate it the next day. I thought it tasted better the next day. The hubs ordered the breaded whitefish sandwich. Blah. He said it was just a fish sandwich. It was kinda soggy. No crunch to the fish at all. (not like at Bite cafe, which we both rank as the best breaded fish we've had).  For dessert we got the bread pudding with toffee and dates. I immediately sent mine back to get wrapped up. I was stuffed. The bread pudding was thick and dense and rich like you'd expect. But I enjoyed the toffee chucks with some sprigs of mint to cut the richness. I don't think we'd go back. Restaurant week is to show off highlights of your menu to impress people and get them coming back for more. But I wasn't impressed. Sorry. I liked the decor. The farmhouse feeling with the old scales, tractors and lighting you'd find in a barnyard. Very whimsical.  But woo us with a great menu."
"Restaurant week!!! One of the best times of the year, IMO.  I love the idea of this restaurant, I know the idea of locally sourcing foods is ""trendy"" but I am on board with this place because of their local sourcing.  However, I'm sad to say that things were just ""meh.""We had a 12:15 reservation and we were seating right away.  Actually,  I kind of love when restaurants do this, a member of our party arrived first and was able to be seated.  The rest of us arrived within 5-10 minutes of the reservation so it was great to be seated at the table right away.The restaurant itself is cozy.  It's not too big and not too small, and though the aisle to get to and from the tables were a little tight (granted, I had a baby in a car seat and a diaper bag) it never felt like I was sitting on top of someone.We all went off the restaurant week menu and added in the fried cheese curds.  The cheese curds were delish, but how can you really go wrong with fried cheese?  We all went with the salads, patty melt and the dessert.Salads? Fine, it's salad.  Nothing spectacular, but it wasn't bad.Patty melt?  Not melty. It was weird.  The server mentioned the kitchen was ""slammed"" and we waited a little longer than normal.  That's fine.  I don't mind it when that happens, it's understandable, but really appreciate when the server comes around and tells us what the hold up is.  Ok, back to the patty melt, two of them were melty, two were not.  Mine was not melty, the meat was a little dry and the rest of it was just a little blah.  I was really excited for the goopy, messy, hard to eat patty melt, but I was able to successfully eat this one handed with my baby in my lap.  Weird...not how it should be.I really wish the meal I had here was awesome so that I could go back...but it wasn't. I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again if someone wanted to try it, but there are other restaurants on my list to go to first."
"Went for brunch on a busy, nice Saturday. Surprisingly, we had no wait, and we were able to order drinks right away. The food was noticeably fresh and delicious, and the portions were a good side, not too big and over-the-top like many brunch places in the area. I would recommend it for a quiet, fresh, and relaxed brunch."
Short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth phenomenal -- definitely recommend!  Great beer list with cool twist to show how far away they were brewed.  Young professionals crowd and quite busy on a Friday night.  Make reservations!
"Farmhouse, with is its amazing beer selection (28 microbrews on tap!!), inventive mixed cocktails and delicious food, is a place you can bring your family, friends and clients. With its chic rustic decor and attention to detail, it will blow you away! The servers were friendly, attentive and knowledgable about the food and drinks.This is simply a great space to spend an evening with people you like and have a great time!"
"This locally sourced tavern style restaurant next to the Chicago Ave brown line stop has a cozy rustic atmosphere.For lunch I ordered the short rib sloppy joe with blue cheese and caramelized onions and a bowl of tomato soup in hopes of keeping the winter chill away on this snowy day.The soup was well prepared; a velvety bowl of tomato puree decorated with chives and crispy friend onions. The housemade potato chips, unfortunately, were a little overdone. I asked the waiter if that was how dark they were usually prepared and he said they were but he would bring something else if I wanted. I got an order of fries instead and they came out quickly and were excellent. A few minutes later the waiter arrived with a plate of chips explaining that the chef agreed that the first batch was a little over done.Carbs help you stay warm right? That was my excuse for polishing off two plates of crispy potato goodness anyway.The sloppy joe was very tasty but I thought it could have used a little more blue cheese and onion as there was a very small amount of each in the very center of the sandwich. I ordered a side of blue cheese but it never made it out to the table. Oh well. It was still a tasty sandwich.The beer menu looked really interesting and I will have to return some evening to investigate further."
Very good food and great beer.  The decor is cool but it does become a screaming match because of the poor acoustics.  I would definitely go back again!  Excellent place to go for dinner and a night out.
Emma and Maggie are simply great at their job.  Try the specialty cocktails.  Cheese curds are a must.  Wonderful atmosphere.  Great mead and moonshine options to go with dessert.
"It's been a while since I've given a five star review, but I must say that this place is totally worth 5 stars. Not only are the food and drinks fresh and fabulous, but the interior design and style is right up my alley. If there is a place in your heart for the Midwest, Farming, Nature, and Chicago, then you will probably like this place. Plus, all the staff is super nice yet laid back and cool.Came here for a private event on the second floor - but I had a good sampling of their food and drink. Farmer's Daughter cocktail:Pulpy and fresh. The Gin really brings out the blackberry and peach. Beers: Two brothers Brown Fox English Brown Ale, Metropolitan Flywheel Bright Beer, Darkhorse Reserve Special Black Bier, Local Option Gose Salt Bier. The Black Bier and Salt Beer are different and unique. You may want to taste before your get a whole glass. They have interesting selections. Snacks: Potato Chips, Cheese Ball, Cheese Curds ... all fine choices for bar snacks. Just get what you want, everything is bound to be good. Food: Grass Fed Burger is AMAZING. You can taste the freshness. And mine was cooked to a perfect Medium. Flatbreads are tasty as well - the Pesto really popped on mine."
Deep fried cheese curds.  MmmmmmMMMMMmmmm
"Brian the bartender was a most gracious host, he showed me where all the bar is sourced from the surrounding states with the exception of a scotch from Portland. The menu changes regularly based on ingredients which I love! I had the pork shank with, white bean and swiss chard, it was a perfect away from home meal. The wines were good too. All around it was wonderful and I can't wait to visit again when I'm back in Chicago. Decor was fun, restrooms clean, staff very pleasant."
"We came here on a Friday night and I totally loved it! The atmosphere is fun and hip and the food was great! I recommended Martha D. to come here, but it looks like she didn't have as great of an experience as us :/ We started off with the Cheese ball and it was a mixture of blue cheese and another cheese with crispy flat crackers. It was sooo good. The ball was smaller than expected, but for 2 of us as an app I thought it was perfect. For my main, I had the veggie burger, and it was quite tasty. It was made with mushrooms, quiona and was flash fried at the end to give it a crispy texture. They make their own ketchup, and I wasnt that big of a fan, but I still dipped my fries in it. The beer menu was extensive, especially with the IPA's (I hardly drink beer), so after my first beer I was ready for my white wine. Unfortunately, their wine list is pretty minimal, but I get it, its not a wine bar! I would definitely come back here for drinks or dinner again. I just loved the atmosphere and wouldn't mind sitting at the bar next time around!"
"Farm-to-table and the use of  the word ""House"" in the restaurant name are, or at least were, the rage of the last few years.  I'm waiting for the table-in-farm andapartment-name trends to start.  Chicagoans now leave their houses todine in other ""Houses"".  The decor is what you would expect:  lots of wood and littered with rustic antiques.  No complaints with any of that.  But I'm not here for the decor.First, let's take a look at drinks.  Everything is sourced locally, for better or worse.  Worse, being the beer selection.  I've come to the conclusion that most beer made in the Midwest sucks.  Any attempt outside of an IPA-style, which I don't care for anyway, is like throwing a bunch of high-school kids in the basement with a homebrew kit and expecting magic.  There's a reason the Europeans have been brewing beer for hundreds of years.  Do you really think you can outdo all those monks?  Ok, there's a few good beers from Goose Island, Revolution and 3 Floyds but none of the good stuff was on offer at FH.  I settled for a clumsy ""Dubbel"" from Michigan and a watery ""Hefe-Weizen"" from Wisconsin.  The former was passable but the later was like light beer gone wild.  And to add insult to perjury, they were both north of $7 each.  What?  Need to cover all transportation costs across the state lines?The cocktail list was your standard gin & whiskey selections that every bar in Chicago has these days.  Yawn...       So how's the food?  The food is actually pretty solid but not spectacular and certainly not worth the exorbitant prices.  $24 for Trout?  Ok, not a lot of restos have it but for $24, it'd better be superlative.  It wasn't.  It was just good. The cheese curds were the standout.  Lightly battered, moist inside and the accompanying sauces added a new dimension to the curds.  They may have justified their $9 price tag.My escort of the evening had the fish-and-chips.  I sampled both.  The fish was perch and was expertly fried.  Unfortunately, a sickly, brown gravy was poured over the fish-and-chips that only made both soggy and unpleasant.  Why?  The fries were really mush and cold by the end.  Shame.  Service was a bit perfunctory and distant.  The cocktails took a coon's age to show up and  the appetizer arrived before the drinks.  Flash-fryer 1, Bartender 0.  A second round of drinks were ordered mid-way thru the meal and didn't arrive until meal's end.  Bartender was really off that night.  Maybe he was helping those Midwestern teenagers brew the basement beer?  FH makes me long for another dinner at the ill-fated and closed Erwin, which did the same thing - only better, cheaper and more elegantly.  Sigh..."
"Excellent! Went here on a girl's night dinner with a bunch of friends from work. We were able to get the last reservation for 5pm (but at least we had to be somewhere at 7 so an early dinner was okay!). While most of my companions had the burger (which they all loved- each one got a different kind of cheese), I had the half Amish chicken, grits, and brussels sprouts which had just appeared on the menu the day before. It was DIVINE. Succulent chicken, a wonderful take on grits with pecans, and caramelized brussels. I might have been dreaming of this meal since we went. Don't forget to get the cheese curds to start!The drink selection is also wonderful- we all had the Humdinger to start, which contains their own special creation called Hum. I don't remember what exactly the other drink I had was called (it had scotch and apples in it), but I also tried my friend's sangria and it was spectacular."
"BF: Wait, you ate all of those?  Me (shifty eyes and sly grin): ugh yes apparently.....you picked the wrong time to go to the bathroomBF: Dear, youre a piggy!  Me: They are so good!  Basically, if you are a fan of cheese curds, don't even bother trying to share them. If it weren't for my Wisconsin bred boyfriend understanding just how good curds can be, I could have been clobbered for my inhalation of the heavenly cheese curds. The gooey cheese is lightly breaded and served piping hot right out of the fryer. The interior is intimate, eclectic and complete hipster. The menus are served on clipboards, the tables are picnic style, and the waiters are shaggy and wear Andy Warhol-like glasses. It's a small joint so be prepared to cozy up to your neighbors and maybe make a few new friends.  The Farmhouse's MO is fresh, local ingredients and brews. Their beer menu is a pleasure to browse and it's fun picking out a new local brew to try. I savored my Revolution Cross of Gold Beer, a blonde ale with a slight hoppy flavor. The cheese curds and beer consumed 3/4 of my stomach and I filled in the rest with the flatbread. The flatbread was delightful with puree squash, goat cheese, and few other toppings I can't recall.  I look forward to returning to Farmhouse. Next time I'm not messing around. Definitely ordering the curds for appetizer, dinner, and dessert. This joint is easy to find. Hop off the Franklin/Chicago brown line stop and look for the cows in the window. Moo!"
"I found Farmhouse on my yelp app while staying in Chicago and made the 1.5 mile trek from my hotel to enjoy dinner at their bar. They have an awesome gin bar, and although I am a gin drinker I opted for a craft beer. I started with the beet and arugula salad. It was a lot bigger than what I expected so I barely ate half in anticipation of my entree. The trout came out soon after I gave up on the salad. Perfection! So light and flaky, perfectly cooked and seasoned. I could eat this every day! Portion size was also very generous. I couldn't finish the trout either, although I reallllly tried. Service was attentive and the bartenders were friendly without being overly chatty. Would love to come back with friends on a visit catered to fun rather than work."
"Great, sincere service from someone who clearly enjoys her job; admirable and important local theme; excellent food; great atmosphere. Every menu item including alcohol is from within the region, the menu even gives you the source and mileage (how far the source is from the restaurant) for all items-pretty cool, all restaurants should do this. It is nice to sit down in a place where you feel comfortable and know you're not eating a pile of Sysco slurry! This is a must try in Chicago."
"We were visiting CHI.  Had a reso. We're promptly seated. Our server was awesome. My husband ordered the muscles and they were okay. He also ordered the short ribs and he says they tasted like pot roast. Four stars because the beer/wine list is AWESOME, and they were super at accommodating our dietary limitations. Ambiance is relaxing and trendy. We really liked this place!!"
The experience was good... but it wasn't amazing. If the price point were lower for the quality offered I might go back.
If this review were just about the food - then it would be 5 stars.... but the service was HORRIBLE.  Our server took at least 15 minutes to come to our table once we were seated and another 15 minutes just to bring back the 2 beers we ordered.  We were seated upstairs so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it.  The food was very good.  The beer selection was very good and I had a pumpkin beer that I really enjoyed.  I had the vegetarian pasta which was delicious and my boyfriend had the burger which he really liked.  The menu had many items on it that looked appealing.I would give it a second try at an off time but the service was just so bad on the Saturday night we were there.
Excellent cheese curds. Great ambiance. Just loved the feel walking in. Would be a great business lunch or a wonderful dinner with and out of town guest!
"Such a unique place for River North! Classy and really nice ambiance without pretentiousness. Local Chicago feel and not overrun with tourists (though I'd definitely recommend to tourists bc of the local beer list and food.) The food and menu speak for themselves. Such great quality.I'll keep coming back for the ambiance, food and beer list! Don't miss upstairs!"
"Went here with my Nouno while he was in town for a business meeting. He had the short ribs and I ordered the half amish chicken. The amish chicken was very good, and the potatoes were killer. But the short ribs were MUCH better in my opinion. The portions were more than enough for two hungry men.The service was a bit slow and they didn't keep the water glasses filled. The food here is all local, and I think they've done a great job putting together delicious meals while keeping to their commitment. Would go again."
"Made a reservation for four at 8:30 on a Wednesday and when I showed up, I wasn't even on the list.  I do not want to forget the 10 (maybe even 15) minutes we had to wait for someone to greet/acknowledge us.  Perhaps I should've reserved on open table and not over the phone? How could I be skeptical to make a reservation over the phone if the hostess repeated my name, party number (four guests), time and phone number? My boyfriend and I ordered the fried cheese curds, roasted beet salad, chicken and dumpling soup and farmhouse burger with smoked Gouda (extra $1).  I was worried about the cheese curds being too salty based on prior reviews, but my entire table thought they were delicious.  The chicken and dumpling soup was bland and needed better flavor, while the roasted beet salad was average (basically what you'd expect to taste for a roasted beet salad- nothing unique).  As for the farmhouse burger, I was thankful that the cook split the burger in half (as well as the fries) since the bf and I were sharing it. At first glance, I already got disappointed. The burger did not look like a mouth-watering, juicy burger with the melted cheese pouring down the sides of the patty due to the residual heat of that off-the-grill freshness I so desired.  My smoked Gouda was barely, if at all, melted. The bun was nicely toasted and a good serving of fresh veggies atop of the cheese. The patty was just all right.  Perhaps if the burger got to the table sooner and if the cheese was even slightly melted, I would've enjoyed it more.  I had higher expectations since many were mentioning the Farmhouse burger's greatness, but I was just left disappointed.  If you really want a good burger, go to Au Cheval. Service was average, not too spectacular. I didn't have the best experience from start to finish. I didn't have a bad experience, but certainly not a memorable one.  I probably wouldn't come here again because it wasn't anything special."
"I loved Farmhouse.  Local, fresh, ingredients made into mouthwatering dishes.  My lunch was SO good.  We started with the cheese curds and I had the burger.  The beer selection was VERY impressive.  The atmosphere and decor is very pleasant; light and comfortable, yet rustic.  I heard complaints by others about the service, but we didn't experience this at all.  Our service was very good!  I will definitely come back here when in Chicago."
Food - 3Service - 4Atmosphere - 3Value - 2Will I do again?  No
"Long overdue review - This place is great. Across the street, friendly, and always great food. Oh yeah, great beer as well. 10/10, would dine again."
Great Food! Great Drinks! Great Service!
"The man behind the bar has got to be kidding me.This was my first time at Farmhouse. I made the mistake of telling him that.  I came in for lunch.  I ordered a diet soda, and he said, ""I'll totally get you that, but do you want to try one of our craft sodas?"" I forget what they are called.  I guess it's my fault, but I really felt (as did my co-workers) that he implied the drink was on him.  So I said ""Sure!""Later during lunch, he asked me if I wanted a refill.  Not thinking, I said ""Sure!""I'd encourage you to ask more questions than I did, because I ended up with $8 extra on my tab.  $4 for each glass."
"Farmhouse is a new farm-to-table tavern in River North. Everyone in our party was pleased with their entree, but neither the concept or menu is particularly revolutionary. Its good, hearty, local food, so this is a good place for the eaters with ""limited palettes."" We started with fried cheese curds. Yummy, but a little greasy (as expected). My trout was fresh and paired well with the creamed spinach. My friend raved about the Short ribs. The Amish chicken was also favorably received.The beer selection is quite extensive, and the staff is super friendly and attentive.I will go back to Farmhouse, but not before trying a few more adventurous menus."
"Came here with a colleague during a business trip.  Everything we ordered was fantastic.  The rustic hip decor was beautiful.First off all the alcohol & beer &wine  is local. Cocktail menu is fantastic. Dinner was delicious- the cheese curd app is a must. Pork chop was perfectly cooked, and bread pudding was to die for.Can't wait for my next trip to Chicgo! Or better yet- relocate this place to Philadelphia!"
Fried Cheese Curds...nuff said
"Great local food. The only downside is that the majority of the tables are high top farmhouse tables, which they expect you to sit on metal stools without a back. I know this seems like a minor thing, but when you're paying for a relatively nice dinner, I'd like to also be comfortable. We asked to be moved to a regular table, which was not a problem. Just be forewarned, that you may end up sitting in metal backless stools."
"fried cheese curds! best item on the menu! pairs well with a nice beer.shared the trout and ribs.  -trout comes with this green bean salad, which wasnt my thing.  trout, itself was fresh and nicely done.-ribs were really tender and sweet from the apples.service was nice.  our server was attentive."
"We've been to Farmhouse twice: once for dinner and once for brunch.  Within 1 block of an always-busy breakfast favorite (Yolk), Farmhouse is nearly empty for Sunday brunch.  Although I like Yolk, Farmhouse is now my go-to for brunch.Our group had a variety of brunch items: french toast, frittata, and the pork belly grilled cheese with tomato soup.  This stuff is hearty...you'll need a nap afterward.  Isn't that what Sundays are for?Service was super-friendly both times we've been to Farmhouse.  The staff seems to genuinely enjoy being there."
Came here on a whim with my brother-in-law and hubbie.  It was honestly forgettable meal.  The cheese curds were great but that's all that I really remember.  The mussles were cooked in beer which really was overpowering for the preparation.  I don't remember the entree we had... We will be back at least one more time to give it another go!
"The service here was fantastic. The waitress was very informative and passionate about their selective beer list. The cheese curds lived up to the hype, they were a delicious appetizer. The only reason I have to leave out the 5th star is because my main dish, their burger, lacked taste. I will admit that most of the blame falls on me for choosing the burger. The rest of the menu was filled with great dishes. My gf got the pork chop which was delicious. Next time I go back and have a different meal, I'll raise this to 5 stars."
"Have been wanting to try this place for a while and went with three friends during Restaurant Week. I think a group any bigger would have been difficult. From start to finish, the whole experience was great. Our server was friendly and helpful in our wine selection. I started with the potato and bacon soup, which had an excellent flavor. For my entree I had the short ribs. They were so tender it fell apart with a fork. The sauce was perfect.For dessert I had the chocolate pie with frozen chocolate pudding and brownie crumbles. I could have ate the pudding all night. The rest of the group had the bread pudding which I didn't have because I usually don't like the consistency, but I had a taste and it was delicious. We also had to try the beer battered cheese curds. light and crispy. I would definitely go here again."
"Toasty, warm, and great atmosphere.  Server was very knowledgeable.  Everything we ordered was excellent."
"Such a great little place! I dined here once last summer and it was good, but not really worth ranting on yelp about. But then I went back a few days ago and Wow! Things have really turned around! The service was wonderful, we had a server named Andrew and he was so friendly and attentive to us all night, even though they were super busy, he treated us like we were his only table. The food was also great, certainly better than I remember from last summer. I had the walleye with black lentils and I could seriously eat it everyday for the rest of my life. SO GOOD. All in all, this was a great dining experience and we will definitely be back!"
"My review is based solely on the fish and chips I had for lunch, it was very underwhelming.  I also didn't care for the extra sticky table we sat at, had to put my napkin down on the table in order to rest my elbows.  Yuck."
"Here's the deal: there is both indoor and patio seating, the food is very fresh and delicious, the place is clean, service is decent and bathrooms are small and homey(yet strangely chic).The bar has quite an excellent selection of beers, cocktails and ciders. I had some sort of ginger cider and gosh was that good. Atmosphere is loud on the weekend which I'm not too hot on and the burger I had was $$. All things considered, I would return to farmhouse."
"Farmhouse was amazing. Every little detail seemed pretty great. It's kind of got this dimly lit, cozy feeling to it that works so well with their food. And oh that food is good. All the ingredients were so fresh. I had a tomato salad and the tomatoes were a perfect deep red all the way through. For my entree I had the braised short ribs, and they were so tender. You can't believe how tender they were. They were eat with a spoon tender. On the plate with the ribs were carrots, greens and apples, and it went together perfectly. They also had a really good beer selection, and for those of you who are interested, multiple ciders on tap. I highly recommend this place, it is awesome."
"Amazing farm to table concept!  We are also regulars here.  We love pretty much everything here from the roasted beets salad to the burger.  The cheese curds are amazing - their pork belly also rocks.  The amish chicken was very good, we haven't gotten this since the first time we came in, but I remember the taste was very tender.  I mean this place is just FRESH to death!  I think they have a garden upstairs where they grow certain greens/herbs.  It's really impressive.  We are just obsessed with farm to table restaurants like Farmhouse, Ruxbin, Grass Fed, etc.  I'm glad we have this movement towards organic and fresh approach to food.  We are what we eat!  Oh, they also have great beer.  I'm not a beer drinker, but I tried one my friend got and it was pretty good, she's an avid beer person and she loved it.  So I guess that's her review sort of :) I HIGHLY recommend Farmhouse, it never disappoints, time after time.  And now they have brunch - so it's totally sweet.  Although their brunch menu isn't huge.  :-/  Wish it had little more selection - but they just started it, so lets wait and see!  :)"
"I ordered the BLT and it was a little over priced for the size, but the grilled chicken sandwich was huge. Other than some questionable pricing I had a nice experience, and wouldn't mind going back."
"Being first-time visitors to Chicago, we didn't realize that so many places were closed on Sundays! But we did a little light research at our hotel (thank you magazines at Wyndham!) and we found this gem of a restaurant. Everyone from the hostess to the waiter to the bartender were incredibly friendly and warm, and the restaurant itself was extremely inviting.The food:Fries w/ Garlic mayo = way to my heartMussels in Supper lager = mussels were really tasty, and the sauce was great for dippingGrilled trout = we expected a filet, but got a whole fish! Almost perfectly deboned too! It was flaky and melt-in-your-mouth butteryOverall, fantastic place to go for fresh, delicious food."
"Meh.... cool concept but totally lacking when it comes to the food. We ordered the cheese ball as an appetizer and it was WAY too hard.  Everyt ime I tried to spread it on my cracker, the cracker would crumble.  It felt like I was trying to spread frozen butter on a saltine... just didn't work.  The mac and cheese was terrible, I mean it almost tasted like they made the cheese from some sort of powder.  It had the consistency of water with some crumbs on top. I was pretty disappointed.  And then my burger was very undercooked.  I ordered it medium and it came out rare.  They fixed it, but I still wasn't impressed.  Oh and the bun was stale. Bummer, because I really wanted to like this place. On the plus side, the Ohio wine was good!"
This place is fantastic. Traveling in from Massachusetts and really wanting to taste something local means this place is a gem. Fried cheese curds? Schnitzel? What is this amazing food I've never had before? I'm so happy yelp led me to this place. You owe it to yourself to eat here. Or just come drink from the long list of local beers and craft distilleries. It's so hard to find new things in the world of food. This was all a discovery. I loved it
"Walked in here one evening during the week and asked if we could be seated.  Hostess said they were completely booked but we could check at the bar.  So we looked downstairs and upstairs but they were both full. But there were tons of empty tables....SO...I then checked open table on my phone...and whaddaya know? Reservations available every 15 minutes for the next two hours.  Went down and told the hostess how we now have a reservation and she bitchy-il-y tells us how she hates open table and it doesn't do a good job of pacing tables. Um you had at least ten open tables, why did you not want to seat us? We smiled...we were friendly... So we end up getting seated by a much friendlier hostess and end up having a really nice waiter who answered all of our questions and made some drink suggestions.Ordered cheese curds which were good but kind of greasy. Think my boyfriend got a shortrib dish or a steak...can't remember...wasn't memorable, and I think I got sole which was mediocre.Doubt I'd go back unless a friend really wanted to try it."
The food was great!!  Service was prompt and friendly.  Offered beer samples to my friend who wanted to try something new.
"What word describes this place, yum!  This is an outstanding place. Went there on a Friday night with my wife and a friend. We started out with fried cheese curds, wow, so fresh and lightly breaded. I had the burger and it was so good. The beef is fresh and the buns are outstanding. One of the best parts of the fine establishment is the long list of local micro-brews from IL and surrounding states!  The service staff is awesome. Go!"
"I went here last night and snagged a spot on their small sidewalk/patio area. The service was friendly and attentive and the food was great! I ordered the whitefish which was hearty and light at the same time. The fish was delicate and perfectly cooked and it sat on mushrooms, beans and a light sauce. Perfect meal for a 75 degree night. My friend got the chicken soup and chopped salad and practically licked the plate clean. They have a farm to table concept so the menu changes all the time which gives me plenty of excuses to come back!"
"I am big fan of the concept of this place, locally sourced foods from the midwest and fun gastropub.  They play a lot of 80's music so if you are from that era its a lot of fun. The location itself is in trendy river north, a great part of Chicago and located directly across the street from an El Station. Plenty of parking on the streets around.  The physical look and feel is very barn/famish with a bit of an industrial touch. For instance the stools look like they were all bough at estate sales or reclaimed from barns or farm.. each on is different which gives this place some real charm. I am pretty sure the waiter said that most of the materials in the place were reclaimed.. On to the food, its good, not great, good.. I had the trout and my partner the short ribs.. THe desserts are good as well. We shared a goat cheesecake with a strong basil flavor to it.. Overall a good place.. The cocktails are made with local spirits as well. I recommend trying this place.One negative note is the acoustics are bad and this place is incredibly loud.. Might be hard to hear each other in a big group setting."
"It was my first time there. We went for brunch and were seated immediately. We sat outside. The service was terrible. It took 15 mins just to get a waiter out to take our order. The coffee is not good. It took another 30 mins just to get our food. When it finally did come it was surprisingly good. I asked if it was always like that and our waitress said no. It took another 10-15 mins for us to get our check. When it finally arrived, the manager brought it out and asked, besides the wait, did we enjoy our food. We both said yes. He apologized for the wait, said our brunch was on him and he hoped we would return. We definitely will! That was great of him."
"Great food, service and a unique environment. Sat upstairs with my spouse last night; tables are close but their site tells you it is group seating, so don't expect a lot of room (we actually had a nice conversation with the table right next to us. They were visiting Chi from MI for the weekend). Beer list was great and our server, David, was friendly and helpful. The food was amazing, from the cheese platter to the steak special to the bread pudding dessert. And food was not over priced. Thank goodness we walked home! We will definitely make this place a regular on our list."
A friend took me to Farmhouse for my birthday dinner on a Wednesday night.  We had no problem getting a table and were seated right away.  The server was efficient and knowledgeable.  I drank a couple of Three Floyds Dreadnaugh IPA's the server recommended which were great.  We shared Seasonal Whole Wheat Flatbread which had delicious goat cheese pepperonis and brussel sprouts.  The flavors were wonderful together.  I had the Tender Boneless Short Ribs which was simply incredible.  The beef was the most tender I've ever had and the creative flavors complemented each other nicely.  My friend had the Half Roasted Amish Chicken which was equally great in its' own way.  The decor was great and ambiance was pleasant.  Well done Farmhouse.  We'll be back.
"Okay, let's get this out of the way: Farmhouse is very small relative to the interest it has from customers. This will result in a wait even when you have a reservation. If you are prone to annoyance at such things (as am I), it's best to have several friends on hand who can, and will, ply you with alcohol to dull your senses and reaction time and food to stuff in your mouth once you begin to get lippy. Think of this as the farm-to-table version of Odysseus desiring to be tied to the mast so that he may hear the siren's song yet not fall to its evil spell. Or, something. You'll walk inside, be overwhelmed by how tight everything is, walk upstairs, ask for a beer, get a nice red, side-eye a few workers, have your friends start plying you, and finally, sit down for dinner a half hour after your reservation.This better be good.Thankfully, it is.The chefs have taken their time to come up with a thoughtful menu that really reflects the farmlife of the region. This is not a restaurant that would make sense in Florida or California. This is good ol' Midwestern f-t-t goodness. Being the Midwest, you need to start with cheese -- a lot of cheese. The cheese curds, cheese ball and mac & cheese fritters are way too good to not inhale. Carefully considering ordering EACH of these SOLELY FOR YOURSELF. I'm not selfish, I'm just sayin'. Sharing these bad boys will not lead to anything good. It won't. The chips with dill were a winner as well but, really, it's all about the cheese. It's also all about the chicken. Yes, chicken. I know, I know: chicken? Yep. I don't know what they do to this bird but it's succulent, wrapped inside crispy skin (yes! The skin is always the best part!! Why doesn't someone come up with fried chicken skin chips? There. I just gave you a million dollar idea) and adorned with bleu cheese mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and corn vinaigrette. With every bite, you won't believe it's chicken.The drink menu is every bit as well-curated as the food. I mentioned earlier getting a beer. Do this. You'll be drinking regional brew, whether it's from IL, IN, MI, or WI. Very cool. And the best part is if you find something you like, odds are you'll be able to find it at your local liquor store and you'll be supporting a local craft brew. Win. Laughing in the adage of 'beer before liquor..."", settle in with cocktails for your meal. Order the Humdinger. Be woo'ed by its fruity flavor and purple color. Be knocked out by whatever's in it. What is hum anyway? I think it's a lab experiment. And, because you can't get enough booze, order some for dessert. For some reason, I thought the Brandy Alexander was a cake (or a... um. Nothing else. I have certainly never ever ever heard of the name in any other context or spelled just a wee bit differently at the end. Ever.). It's not. It's ice cream draped in bourbon and topped with stout. You will pass out. The good news: your friends will enjoy the silence of your earlier complaining lambs. And, Farmhouse's location on Chicago makes it easy to catch a cab or the Brown Line... once you're semi-ambulatory.Happy birthday to me -- again!"
"Went with a mixed group from work, with a wide variety of tastes. We ordered a number of different items from the menu and found all of them to be good but not particularly outstanding. Portions were surprisingly smaller than I expected. Service was fast and friendly, and the beer selection is great. The cocktails were outstanding as well.All things considered, it's an ok place."
"Went with a group of girlfriends for my birthday dinner.  None of us had heard anything about the restaurant before we went, but we were all pleasantly surprised by our experience! We ordered the cheese curds for an appetizer, which were very delicious. Two of us ordered the beef short ribs, one had chicken, and two others had fish. The short ribs were probably the most tender I've had yet. Dessert was also great. Atmosphere was nice. It was a little loud, and the seating next to the wall in the front of the restaurant isn't the most comfortable, but I would eagerly go back."
"Super friendly staff, fresh, local ingredients, good beer selection...will have to come back to try the food (we were just here to start our Chicago Craft Beer Week journey). We did try some cheese curds, which we all loved.  Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable."
"I grabbed some dinner here after work with a friend, and as you can see from my 3 star rating, I thought it was OK. Nothing great, but not awful. The decor is original and  lives up to the name/theme. The best menu they have is their beer menu; the food menu is small and doesn't have much variety....It's also grossly overpriced.  My friend ordered the white fish for $19, and he ate it in less than 5min. If it came with a side there wasn't much of a serving. Immediately after he finished, he asked the bartender to see the menu again so he could order an appetizer  because he was still hungry. All in all, he spent $27 in food just to get the serving of an average meal. I ordered a burger because it was the most reasonably priced option on the menu (after seeing my friend's white fish, I'm glad I did). I don't mind spending $14 on a burger, but I expect to be more flavorful and bigger than what was served to me. Bad Apple and Kuma's can justify charging $14 for a burger, but not Farmhouse.  Go for the beer, but save your money on the food."
Love the smokey Willard and the other great gin drinks. Pretty pricey though considering they're not super strong. FYI service is kind of slow at the bar even when not too busy so get up there and ask for a menu right away.
"Scrumptious! Love the menu selections and specials! Our friends all met up to celebrate a recent engagement. Our server was tentative, knowledgable, and overall wonderful. The food was tasty to the last morsel. Everyone raved about their dish. My food was cooked, prepped, and seasoned perfectly. My husbands steak was Devine! We had a wonderful evening! Can't wait to return!"
"Incredible drinks and beer list. Burger is pricey, but maybe that's cause I told them to put EVERYTHING on it... AND it was off-the-chain-delicious!!!  Worth every oz.My forkfull steals of everything else people at my table ordered were really good too!  But, I didn't give up a morsel of my burger. Yumm Yumm."
"The Farmhouse theme is appropriate because you have a goat as your upstairs bartender.When I arrived alone at the upstairs bar I sat down at the end. The Rob Zombie clone bartender took 10 minutes before he even acknowledged my existence. It took another 7 minutes for him to ask me if I wanted anything. If his goal was to make me feel unwelcome than I would give him 5 stars. I ordered a housemade ginger ale and he made sure to comment to his coworkers about me ordering that. There were 5 or 6 staff members standing around talking to each other. In the meanwhile, I had no water or silverware.The food was good but really nothing that amazing. I feel like they were trying to steal the Amish Chicken at the Bristol but it fell way short. Who know's maybe I just got the upstairs B-Team but on a Friday night but that just doesn't seem possible.My suggestion is to get rid of the bartender upstairs who has a lot of hair and grooms himself with his hands every 5 minutes. You are serving food and pouring drinks so stop touching yourself."
"Not impressed. The atmosphere was great, the place is super cute, but the food leaves much to be desired. Overpriced for how disappointing the food was - very bland. The server was attentive and friendly but didn't offer much guidance when we asked questions, just kept saying everything was great. I would not go back."
"My husband, my friends, and I came here for a late dinner (9ish) on a Saturday night. It was busy and they do take reservations, but we were able to walk in and get a table for 5. Even if the food and drink were crappy, which they were NOT, I would still support this establishment for pursuing a local focus. Everything you eat and drink in this craft tavern (as they call themselves) is local - Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, etc. It was refreshing to see a ton of craft on the beer menu - Solemn Oath Brewery out of Naperville, which has only been open for 2 months, had THREE taps. So awesome. It was also neat to take a look at the unrecognizable liquor bottles behind the bar as they were all from local distilleries. My friend tried a bourbon at the recommendation of our server and he was blown away. In terms of food the highlights include: - cheese curds (a very generous portion, huge chunks of warm soft cheese, light but flavorpacked breading)- house cured beef jerky (holy moley!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) - chicken dumpling soup- flatbread of the day- lamb ragout pastaI was very sad we were too full for dessert, but I'm sure it is fabulous."
The starter salad could use some tweaking but I had the duck breast on polenta and my spouse had the steak and both were fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place. The service and atmosphere were both excellent as well.
fantastic place! went one time for drinks after work with a friend and had the greatest server. Definitely have a variety in choices of wine
Love the local fresh menu!  Fresh and local food always tastes better. Great burgers.  Really good cheese curds.   Love the local beers!
"Farmhouse is not your usual pub style restaurant. This is a high-end establishment featuring very fresh and flavorful dishes with an emphasis on quality. The ambiance was pub-like being dim, noisy and somewhat uncomfortable. However, you quickly warmed up to this as the service was very thoughtful and intelligent and the music being played in the background was inspiring. First on the beers.... Farmhouse has truly a great beer menu. I was able to sample several unique micro beers, including one from Baltimore that was truly delicious. The server was extremely knowledgeable about beers and guided me patiently through the various choices. Try for something unique when you visit Farmhouse. My meal was excellent. Here were some of my dishes:Appetizer:Wisconsin Cheese Curds, Alder Smoked Catsup. A wonderful, home-style dish that you likely won't find anywhere else. The cheese curds were done perfectly and it was perfectly displayed. Truly a fun dish!Main:Tender Boneless Beef Short Ribs, Horseradish Whipped Potatoes, Brussel Sprouts, Crispy Buttermilk Onions, Natural Braising Jus. A wonderful assortment/medley of ingredients generating a tasteful, fresh dish. The short ribs melted in your mouth. The natural braising jus was perfect. I highly recommend this dish.Please visit Farmhouse. You won't be disappointed. Please make a reservation as it gets very busy!Enjoy Chicago!"
"Oh Farmhouse, you had me at cheese curds! Where else in the city can a Midwestern girl get her fix (seriously, where...?).I'm digging this new addition to Chicago Avenue and looking forward to a return visit. The cocktail/beer/wine list is long and lovely. The space is very sexy with two stories of exposed brick, low lighting and interesting decorations. And the food is something to talk about - especially the short ribs (I mean, melt in your mouth goodness).All in all, a bullseye for Farmhouse."
"I decided to come here based on other yelpers reviews and wow, I'm so glad I did!  I decided to eat a burger with a fried egg, the Wisconsin cheese curds (MUST HAVE!), and a martini!  The place is packed, but since I was by myself, I just sat at the bar and had my meal.  All food is from local farmers and from what I had seemed fresh.  The staff seemed to be all friendly and attentive.  Definitely will come again to try the other menu options!"
"I've been to Farmhouse a couple other times but only because it's so convenient in proximity to where I live and it's right off the brown line across the street if I'm coming from somewhere else on my way home. I would not go out of my way from other neighborhoods for this though. I was on a meat eating hiatus and it didn't make me miss meat at all. My hiatus is working! and so is Farmhouse's cooking. First off, we had reservations made well in advance- weeks ago. They don't seat you until your entire party arrives which is fine but the restaurant is small, feels cramped as it is and when we're all standing around waiting for our dinner companion(s), tables, it gets a little awkward because the space gets tighter, then it just gets more comfortable walking outside (which I did), and how about just to another restaurant altogether. Don't even get me started on where they sat us.. a tiny, cramped table squeezed in between two other tables. Reservations aren't necessary for this are they? The food I think is pretty average. Recently I had the short ribs and they're pretty dry, flavorless. Of course they're tender, it doesn't take rocket science to make short ribs tender. I love short ribs but this rendition didn't do the meat any justice. It was like eating pretty much flavorless fibers. Made me glad I'm on my way to going completely meatless forever. The trout was just okay. The potatoes underneath it were better. I get their whole schtick is regionally/locally sourced food but c'mon, how about doing it some justice and make it taste fucking awesome. I'm not new to this, the west coast has been doing this for decades now and have got it covered. Their cheese curds were pretty good even though I usually hate cheese and have never had cheese curds before. The batter on it was spot on and really good. Their sticky toffee bread pudding wasn't great.We were really excited to see a good amount of Oregon wines though. If anything I'd come here for a drink or bottle of wine. We recently had a bottle of one of the Oregon red wines and it was fantastic and very reasonably priced. Other than that.. I'll pass on Farmhouse. For me it just highlights how average and pedestrian the midwest can be."
"Excellent burgers and beer list, staff up to par. Wish they had the pig ears, was not big fan of the home made jerky. Def will be back."
"I've wanted to try Farmhouse many times, and finally did with a  friend on a burger and beer craving whim. The beer selection was awesome, and I wound up going with a sour beer from Wisconsin. I ordered the classic burger, medium rare, no cheese. The burger was cooked perfectly, and it was seasoned well, but that was about it. It was't terribly thick, juicy or beefy. The fries were good, but I had to ask for more salt (I guess all the reviews that said their food was too salty made them dial these fries way back), and the bbq ketchup sauce combo thing was watery. I love ketchup. In fact, I feel that fries are really just a vessel for good, thick, rich ketchup. Alas, this ketchup sauce stuff was seriously lacking. My friend and I split a french press coffee and chocolate bread pudding for dessert. Both were tasty enough but certainly not worth my return any time soon. Sadly, I guess one has to be a cheese curd fan to appreciate this place. I will add that our server was excellent (I didn't catch her name), and she alone is a 5 star review."
"I LOVED Farmhouse.  Maybe it's because I was celebrating a big deal, maybe it's because I was hungry, maybe it's because I was with my best friend, but I loved Farmhouse.  The space was very cool, very warm and industrial.  Yes, I know it's weird to say that, but that's how it was.  The music was on so you could hear it, but it wasn't so loud that you couldn't hear the person sitting across from you.  But it also was loud enough that you couldn't really hear the people next to you.  I'm a big fan of the farm to table concept and this did not disappoint.  While I was waiting for my best friend to arrive, I decided to start off with some champagne.  I got the ""Sex Brut Rose"", it was delicious, especially since I'm not the biggest champagne person, but I was celebrating.  My best friend when he arrived, got some sort of pilsner.  I'm not a beer person, but I know he loved it.  For starters, we got the cheese curds.  They were delicious, but who doesn't love a little fried cheese?  For dinner, I had the steak, holy batman was it delicious.  The truffle fries, also amazing.  He had the short ribs with the horseradish mashed potatoes and he thought they were great.  The first bite he said to me ""this tastes like Passover.""  We didn't get dessert, we had more drinks, but I'm sure it would have been great.Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  She was attentive, but not in your face.  I can't wait to go back, it was that good, I'm trying to think of excuses to get back there ASAP."
"We were looking for a not-too-dressy place to hit up to celebrate Valentine's Day the weekend after the holiday.  Farmhouse exceeded our expectations.   Definitely make reservations as it gets super packed on a Saturday night.  Our waiter was friendly, relaxed, and very helpful.  We ordered the cheese curds as suggested by other yelpers (yum!),  the whole trout, and short ribs.  We also were intrigued by their homemade sodas so we each snagged one.  Everything was delicious...short ribs were tender and fell off the bone...the trout though was....WOW....so so so so good.   We both agreed that the trout definitely stole the show and would be a re-order for us.  Sodas were also unique and worth the order."
"Great servers and great beer selection. I can barely find 3 Floyd's beer, and this place had a whole host of different types. I left satisfied having tried four different types of 3 Floyd's.  We also enjoyed fried cheese curds and french fries, they were delightful."
"Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. Thank you for proving grass-fed options! Their cheese curds and housemade chips & dip are also outstanding. Obviously I'll be back to try their other food and beer.A few things I would change: give us the option to have regular ketchup (their house ketchup isn't bad, I just don't want it with everything on the menu), put salt & pepper on the tables, add some chocolate options to the dessert menu, and get rid of those nasty hanging, county, cluster-f*ck decorations scattered throughout the space (just my opinion!)."
"My burger was burnt and it tasted burnt. The *friend cheese* is delish....I really liked it but darn, bad mistake, haha!Drinks were good and priced okay. Overall, the dishes were mediocre and I think our waitress were high. At least she gave us a good laugh.Although, I do appreciate the use local produce and meat. That's a plus."
Came here on a Saturday with a party of 6.  This place doesn't really cater to larger groups.  I don't think I'd come back with anything larger than a party of 4.  The place was loud and the biggest table was right by the door so we were freezing every time the door opened.  The food and beer was fantastic though.  The Amish chicken was right up my alley based on the sides.  I rarely order chicken and I was a huge fan of this dish.  I didn't get to try much of the other dishes though I would have liked to.  The cheese curds were ok and the beef jerky was almost impossible to eat.  The vegetable was brussel sprouts and they were cooked to perfection.  The bread pudding for dessert was good but nothing like Branch 27.
"Went here for brunch a few weeks ago with family.  Service was pretty lackadaisical, and I was startled by the disparity between the price of the entrees (rather hefty for what they were) and the size of the entrees (somewhat stingy, for the dough).  The food was tasty, but we all wished there had been more of it."
"I've been to Farmhouse a couple of times.  The first time was for a birthday celebration.  We had a reservation, but still had to wait another 45min to be seated.  The staff was so accommodating and provided several comped apps and bubbly.  It was awesome.I love how they highlight all their farmers on the board.  It's really cool to see and know EXACTLY where the food you're eating comes from.Holy cheese curds! The best appetizer in my opinion.  Being asian, and completely lactose intolerant, I am typically wary around dairy.  But not for these little nuggets of chewy, gooey perfection.  Comes with a homemade ketchup, which I would eat on its own.  Definitely recommend this appetizer.  Also had the steamed mussels (cooked perfectly and served in a cute black, rustic-looking pot), roasted nuts, and jerky.  Dinner was amazing. I had the fish. (And on the 2nd visit had the pork chops with RAMPS, short ribs - cooked to a melt-in-your-mouth goodness.)Dessert - FARM BAR! Wow. I don't even know what's in this concoction, but it is definitely something that comes from the culinary heavens.  The textures and flavors, all mixed up with vanilla ice cream, are familiar yet kicked-up.  Crunch, chewy, hot, and cold all at the same time."
"I love the concept behind Farmhouse, and it was really well executed.  I had the farmer's daughter cocktail and a glass of sangria to start (kicking off the Memorial Day weekend!) and both were very good.  I'm not a gin drinker but I loved how both drinks came together -- there were some unexpected but very welcome flavors.  Then, my brother and I split the amish chicken and hamburger meals.  You really could taste the difference in quality between the meat here and at other establishments.  We also had a fantastic waitress who made good suggestions and was all around pleasant and helpful.  Very nice!  See you next time, Farmhouse."
Sat at the bar and enjoyed the beet salad and burger with blue cheese and two beers (great beers!). This place is really great and I urge people to check it out. Spoke with the bartenders and it's been open for less than a year so great to see so many people are already fans. -1 star only because my salad and burger came at the same time which was a bit odd...
"We stopped here for a late dinner, 30 minutes before closing time. We ordered three appetizers and the food came out really quickly. The Mac and cheese was good, the fried cheese curds were really good, and we enjoyed the fries as well ... and the garlic aioli sauce was awesome.My husband liked their beer selection, and I got two homemade sodas ... the basil cucumber soda was good, and the root beer was great.Service was really good and the bill was reasonable."
"Good spot with a great wine and spirits selection.  The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable.  The menu is good for meat lovers, it has a decent vegetarian selection as far as restaurants go.  I would give this a 5 star but some nights the service is off.  Overall it is a great place that I have continued to go to."
"Yum!  We came here to drink and scored a few seats at the bar.  Bartender was awesome, we had a yummy housemade soda, a nice local beer and the Mac & cheese, housemade beef jerky, and the apple pie.  Everything was delish, and I love that its all local."
"Great ambience (Friday night). Lively, but a bit loud. Music is nostalgic for 30-somethings since they play New Order, Cure, Depeche Mode, Smiths, etc.  I actually liked their mixed drinks more than their beer.  The appetizers were so-so.  Main dish (I had whitefish) was excellent.  Staff was excellent too.  The price is right for the entire experience."
"JUSTIN S, server extraordinaire - but not in a good way - you get minus one hundred stars. Farmhouse ambiance, Farmhouse food, and every other employee of the restaurant that we interacted with - besides JUSTIN S - you get 5 stars! From the very beginning JUSTIN S (and this was the name on the receipt, so I really hope he wasn't working under another server's account) had attitude. Which is fine. We chalked up his terseness and lack of patience to maybe him having a bad day. We were a little indecisive about the extensive beer list and he gave the impression that we were inconveniencing him by not knowing immediately what we wanted. The same kind of valley-girl eye-roll gum-popping impatient attitude was back when it was time to order dinner. The food, by the way, was totes bomb. I had the whitefish and pork belly with an amazingly magical parsnip puree... jesus aytch christ. If I deign to visit again - which I likely will not because I couldn't possibly stand the condescension and outright hostility (still to come) of JUSTIN S - I would likely order this again. My other friends got the burger, the quinoa burger, and the spare ribs. All delicious. The brussels sprouts - as a side to the burgers - were SOOOOO good. So we're meandering our way through our meal and each have either 2 or 3 beers... and about 8:50 JUSTIN S comes up and asks ""Another round or just the check?"" Which is fine but pushy. And a table mate responded, ""Well, we may order another round in a bit"" to which JUSTIN S shot back with ""I'm not sure if the hostess told you or not [she didn't d-bag] but we have a reservation for this table at 9:30."" Dude. It was 8:50. 40 MINUTES AWAY!!!!!!! So then we say ""Oh, yeah, no problem, we'll be done by then."" And then - I kid you not - he comes back about 10 minutes later and barks ""Are you all set with the check!?"" At this point his attitude was completely intolerable. So I look at the time (9:05) and I say to him ""You said the next reservation is at 9:30. It's only 9:05"" and he replies ""Well the party is already starting to arrive."" At this point, I can't even make eye contact with him because I'm absolutely FUMING that he been so rude the entire $150 meal. After I shot off my 9:05 remark he cobbled together a half-hearted stammer of ""Uh... Uh... We could move you to another table if you wanted... "" but it was too little too late. We had gotten the clear message that we weren't welcome any longer and that we were BARELY being tolerated the entire evening.JUSTIN S left our entire party resentful of the evening. What should have been an absolutely enjoyable and memorable meal was marred by the same kind of prissy attitude and lack of professionalism I might expect to find at a mall food court staffed by high school students who don't really want to be there. You people at Farmhouse should trim the fat of servers like JUSTIN S because he did not represent your wonderful restaurant in way that encourages repeat business. I hope you check your attitude at the door next shift, JUSTIN S."
"Overrated and mediocre.  The beer, wine, and cocktail selection was very good.  The appetizers were nothing special - the thin-cut fries were okay, but too salty, the cheese curds were nothing to write home about, and the pretzel was even less interesting.  On the entree side, the veggie ""burger"" should not be called a burger.  Described as a ""burger"" of forest mushrooms, poblano pepper, and ""old world grains,"" it was a mushy mass that had been deep-fried.  I tasted none of the mushrooms or peppers.  And, I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known it would be batter-dipped and deep-fried.  I ate half of it, because I was hungry.  Very disappointing.  Service was fine.  Pleasant, if not quite sufficiently attentive server.I'm not likely to return."
"This restaurant has a phenomenal beer menu. Sorry I can't comment on the wine, I was in the mood for beer. The food is simple and the chef mixes flavors together that worked well.  On Saturday I had the walleye and strawberries. Go figure.  Great flavor. Went back on Tuesday with a group. Cheese kurds; no brainer.  Beet salad; refreshing. duck for dinner,  perfect.  I will be back."
"My wife and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. We were seated promptly upstairs, at the table immediately at the top of the stairs (weird) overlooking the Walmart Express across the street (yuck). Our server, Jessica was pleasant and welcomed us, explaining the local philosophy of their food and drinks. We ordered: Fried cheese curds- good, but a bit oilyBurger with egg, shaved ham- ordered medium, it arrived beyond well doneSteak (8 oz filet that night) with truffle fries, mushrooms- ordered medium rare and it was perfectMistakes happen in the kitchen- I get that. What I don't get is why our waitress disappeared on us once our food was delivered. My iced tea sat empty for about 15 mins, during which time I decided to eat half of my burger, rather than wait for someone to stop by and cook a new one. I eventually got up to get iced tea at the bar. Summary: food was ok, service was a disaster. Yes, the owner/manager stopped to check on us and comped the burger and some dessert (cherry pie- yum!). We will likely not be back."
"Our first trip to Farmhouse was in the fall of 2011. We truly loved our experience. The food was amazing, the beer selection was solid, and our service was strong. With that being said, every subsequent trip diminished my feelings toward Farmhouse. Our next trip we brought my sister. We got there on time and our table was not ready. That didn't bother us too much, considering it is Chicago on a Saturday night. However, in an effort to seat us, we were stuffed at an awkwardly large table for three right by the opening door in the middle of winter. The food was good, which made up for the slow service.Our next trip was last night. Let me preface this by saying, we understand that Farmhouse has no control over the city of Chicago, but the DEATH TRAP walking into the restaurant was terrifying. One too many drinks and you run the risk of falling into a 10 foot hole in the ground. They put up a shabby wooden 'foot bridge' with a shaky hand rail over a gigantic hole in the ground. Again, I know this is the city of Chicago's hole, but I would have been less hesitant had they done a better job securing a path into the restaurant. I would have also liked to be informed of this when they called to confirm the reservation earlier in the day.Our service was poor. The waitress was very friendly, we have had her before, but we just weren't happy. To begin, there wasn't a chair at the table for my husband. Not a big deal, they brought one right away. We ordered our food, and they initially brought us someone else's (I see this has happened to many other people). Our salad was brought out (which they split for us without us asking...nice touch!) however, we were never given silverware or napkins. Several servers walked by, looked at us sitting there, and never once brought us eating utensils. We had to stop someone who brought us utensils, but not napkins. My husband had to get up and ask for napkins. When you are eating beet salad, you want a napkin. In the end, our food was great. The beet and baby rocket salad was fresh and a great way to start the meal. Our beers were solid, wish we would have been asked if we would like more BEFORE our meal was over. We ordered the Illinois grass fed steak which was cooked to perfection. We also ordered the St. Patrick's Day Irish stew. This is a restaurant that we want to love so badly. Our first experience was great, but things have just bothered us. The people sitting next to us complimented us on how we handled the bad service because they are also in the food business and stated they would have been much angrier! If they can get a few things together, we would like this place much more."
"Enjoyed...and we went back for a condo association meeting during which they offered appetizers and the upstairs for a small fee, very nice."
"I made a reservation here for a Thursday dinner to celebrate my husband's promotion. We had a 6:00 reservation and we were seated right away in the upstairs, which was fun and cozy. We started with the cheese curds. They were so yummy. It was my first cheese curd experience, and I'm definitely a fan. The catsup was good with them as well. I didn't expect to like that. For entrees, the hubby had the burger and fries. Seriously the best fries ever. Crispy. Great seasoning. And that garlic mayo...I could just do shots of it.  I had the trout and it was solid. The fish was really good. I wasn't a huge fan of the spinach and other side. But the fish was tender and cooked perfectly. I will definitely come back here. And I need to get a homemade soda next time!"
This place is cute.  Had chicken noodle soup and fish and chips -- perfect for a cold evening.  Good wine and love the atmosphere.
"When I'm in town for work I'm 35 minutes west in the burb of Elmhurst. What a bummer. I envy all you Financial types who are based primarily throughout the downtown areas of the nation. While I'm trying to find something edible in the burbs you're walking past all sorts of amazing restaurants with all locally sourced foods and house made ingredients. Farmhouse is one of these places. You should be eating here if you're not already.The big chalkboard on the back wall shows the sources of what you'll be eating that evening. Nice to put a name to the farms supplying the fare. I counted about ten but that was just a glimpse.We sat at the bar in front of one of the coolest bartenders of all time. With his help, a coworker who really didn't know much about beer outside of Budweiser was guided to two different bottles he really enjoyed. He also told us about ways he was able to save money on expense reports from back when he was a personal assistant. I wish I could remember his name. He was an entertaining, attentive and personable guy. Key bartender qualities, you know?Farmhouse's bottle selection is pretty impressive. I would say about thirty bottles exist on their menu and if you're looking for tabs, they have about ten featuring mostly local (to the region) brews.Food wise, I don't think any of us were disappointed with the fare. Two of us ordered the farmhouse burger which we were told would be extremely lean. It wasn't the largest burger I've ever eaten but definitely one of the best. I don't find myself savoring burgers too often and this one made me want to take the smallest bites ever to make it last as long as possible.We never made it upstairs (or maybe it was downstairs) to the extra rooms where we were told a band was playing that evening. No need, I suppose. The bar had everything we were looking for and the food came out relatively quickly for the small kitchen they've got."
Great food and great service! Lovely night out. I highly recommend the Wisconsin Old Fashioned!
"Cool spot, great decor inside.  Had a 7:45 reservation and didn't end up getting seated until about 8:15, which was a bit annoying, but overall a good experience.  Great local beer list and the food was solid.  Cooked zucchini was stellar."
"I'd say 4.5 stars with the potential for getting bumped up in the future.Great place.  Local and fresh food that doesn't come with an overwhelming price tag.  A welcoming and casual environment also make this a place we can't wait to return to.It seems to have found the perfect niche in between all the places serving up ho-hum ""upscale"" bar food (for essentially the same price) that litter the city and places that you need to make a reservation at weeks in advance that cost a fortune.Looking forward to going back often."
"This restaurant is a little of the beaten path, which is exactly what I wanted.  We celebrated my brother's doctorate graduation here, and it was the best meal any of us have EVER eaten!!  Just looking at the menu got us all excited and salivating.Our waitress was EXCELLENT.  She knew tons about the food and was passionate about the local focus of the restaurant.  All of her suggestions were on point!We started with the gin drink ""Farmers Daughter"" which is muddled strawberries and rhubarb with gin.  Not too sweet, but just perfect!For appetizers we had the cheese curds and mussels.  I am not even a fan of mussels and I devoured them!  Of course, the cheese curds were delicious!We got an array from the menu for dinner...the grass fed steak, pork, trout, and short ribs.  Hands down, the steak was the best, but all of the others followed a close second.  The perch was so flavorful and fresh it tasted like I was eating Lake Michigan, in the best way possible!  Desserts were also very delectable.  Their signature dessert (can't remember its name) was the best.  If you live in Chicago or isit Chicago, you MUST eat here!"
Owner took us through a beer sampling and recommended other restaurants when we told him we weren't staying for dinner. His recommendation was excellent as wellTry the cheese curds.
"Went for restaurant week with the wife, and had an absolutely terrific experience.Decor was clearly midwestern-inspired, which I loved.I started with the Humdinger cocktail, made with Hum (apparently similar to rum) and lots of infused herbs.  Very yummy.  My wife had a beer, and their beer selection is a veritable who's who of microbreweries from the great lakes area.  Fantastic.  For the first course, I ordered the cheese curds and my wife got the soup (potato, leek, bacon).  Cheese curds were great!  Soup was very good... don't think I'd call it great, but can't complain.  I mean, there was bacon in it.Main course, I had the short ribs... sooo tender and delicious.  My wife had the duck shnitzel, also very good.  I actually really liked the potato salad that came with her dish.  Dessert? I had the bread pudding, my wife had the dark chocolate pastie pie.  The pie was good, but the bread pudding was fantastic.I also had an additional cocktail, called the Shepherd or something.  Made with scotch and tart apples: wow.We will definitely come back.  Service was attentive, ambience was comfy, we really liked the experience."
"Great ambiance and very lovely crowd on a Friday night. They have a decent wine collection. We had a full-bodied Bordeaux and a rose. I definitely recommend the steak, and the tartare."
"The waitstaff and the beer list are fantastic.  The actual food is lacking.  I came in one Friday night and was told the wait would be 15 minutes (no reservation).  Almost 1.5 hours later we were seated, apologies were given, but come on you can't throw a free round of beers onto the check?  Our server was great, but the food was bland and very expensive for what you got ($18 for a pot pie...).  If you want to check this place out, I suggest going for a few beers and ordering some items off the appetizer menu, the cheese curds were great, but don't waste your money on the main dishes."
"I tried to make reservations at Farmhouse for my birthday, and was told they would not accommodate my group of ten people.  What kind of place doesn't want business?!  Even though I emailed them and called weeks ahead of time.  Oh well, their loss...I have stopped by for a beer. The atmosphere seemed nice, the service was mediocre at best.  After my experience and bad reviews from friends, I will not be trying this place again."
"Two visits = two thumbs up!First visit was a date night with the husband. It was relatively dead on a Sunday night, so the atmosphere was a bit more relaxed. I liked. We shared:-Cheese curds. THE BEST I have had outside of Wisconsin. And I know m'curds, m'kay?-Beet salad. With goat cheese, pretty typical, but still tasty.-Steak for him. Cooked well, the fries were good...but nothing really that knocked my socks off.-Chicken. Hell yes. Crispy pan-fried skin over some luscious spaetzel. Do it. Do it hard. -Not a Brandy Alexander. A fun take on dessert and booze. We enjoyed.Pretty fabulous for a date night, actually. I did hate the high table though. Entirely too close to the other tables, and not really comfortable.Second visit was ladies' night to celebrate a birthday. The place was popping on a Thursday night and much, much louder. We were seated once our entire party had arrived, but not before ordering much-needed drinks at the bar. We went off the menu and ordered Manhattans (perhaps subconsciously in honor of our missing gal pal...)...not bad at all. We enjoyed:-Cheese curds. Still liked.-Mac 'n cheese bites. Skip. Not really special.-Short rib. Good, tender, delicious. Good comfort meal.-Trout. HUGE portion. Well-presented and seasoned. YUM.-Bread pudding. GOOD.-Chocolate...something. It was like a chocolate empanada that was very rich. Good stuff.-A bottle of cabernet franc. Too good. Perfect for a blustery November evening.Both times, service was good, relatively attentive, and definitely informative.Better for a group outing than a date night, I wouldn't mind coming back here. Not a bit."
"Bacon beer.... Need I say more.My roommate and I went here the other night and were very pleased with the food and service. We had the braised short ribs, and the trout, both of which were fantastic! Our server, Emma, was friendly and helpful and we adored her, and I would recommend any of the desserts, Yum!"
"When I was just a wee one, I wanted to be a farmer when I grew up. Anyone who knows me and read this just spit his/her beverage of choice out of his/her nose. I'm *such* a city girl. But when I was a kid,  I liked the idea of fresh air and animals for a career. At some point, I realized that farming requires things that do not sound like fun to this urban dame. Like, invoIved touching of said animals. If Old McDonald wants it, Old McDonald can have it.  But I love the idea of farm to table dining...And this is where Farmhouse enters my life. A gaggle of pals and I met here for dinner.  Overall, it was a positive experience, but there were a few things I took issue with...This is not the fault of the restaurant, but it was LOUD in that place. They should really change the name to Loudhouse. Anyone who works there is surely on the way to a hearing aid. There were six of us, squeezed into a table for four. It was manageable, but the kind of situation where you hope you don't have to go to the bathroom because you'll have to make people move. It was like having the window seat in coach....you don't get up unless you really have to. Most of the time, I have a bladder of steel, but ya never know.I liked the appetizers...we had fries with a garlicky mayo, and fried cheese curds....both were awesome. I ordered the roast chicken, and I enjoyed it, but the apps were better, I think. Dessert choices were too few. Granted, this is not a place with a big menu to begin with...but  I would have liked to see a couple more sweet selections. None of the options wow-ed us, so we passed. Service was ok...our waitress was very nice, but we didn't seem to see her too often. The place was packed, and maybe they were understaffed that night. I get it, it happens. If our server was not pleasant, I would have been irritated.Would I go back to Farmhouse? Sure. Would I run back? Probably not. 3.5 stars rounded to 4."
"A wonderful place for food and drinks.  The cheese curds are killer.  There is no reason not to get these outside of a lactose intolerance.  My bartender, Alex, was informative and held just the right amount of attentiveness.  My sandwich choice was a the melt with was definitely one of best I've had.  Not too greasy and full of taste.  I really wanted the Sloppy Joe, but I just had one the day before at Longman and Eagle.  And the brussel sprout side was perfectly cooked and the sprouts were extremely fresh.  The beer selection was fantastic for a smaller bar.  I had one of their house made Root Beer and it was very refreshing and complimented my meal well. Not too sweet.  You can't go wrong with a visit to Farmhouse."
"Just moved in across the street and now Farmhouse is (thankfully) our new neighbor!We wandered in last night for a beer and were so happy to see such an amazing selection of carefully chosen beers and spirits. The bartender J.R. immediately asked us the types of beer we normally drink and chose us each something that matched our taste perfectly. We munched on the cheese curds which were delicious and being from California we are thinking this is a midwest appetizer we can totally get into. We mentioned to J.R. we are going on a brewery tour in Wisconsin so he introduced us to the most knowledgable beer man we've met around here, Andrew, who guided us on all the places to check out next week. Getting a local's perspective always makes a trip better!All in all, this will be our new spot to come into and hang out at the bar or bring friends to for dinner. Love the atmosphere, the people, and the booze. Cant wait to try more of the ever changing menu of food and beer too!"
"Amazing!  From the cheese curds to the burger (with goat cheese) it was fantastic!  I did the buttermilk smashed potatoes, instead of fries and wanted to lick the bowl clean!  I will return and I highly recommend!"
"I reallllllly wanted to like this place more. The whole concept of most everything they use being locally grown and raised appeals to me. It's nice to know where your food came from. But unfortunately there were just a few things wrong IMOStrike one: Almost everything was waaaaayyyyy under-seasoned. The mac and cheese fritters had a potential for greatness, but were so bland that our table did not even finish them. A little salt goes a long way. Also, the BBQ sauce on top of them was in one word, weird. And I am a girl who likes her BBQ sauce. Too bad. A sampling of a few other items, and I think most of our table of 9 agreed, everything just wasn't seasoned properly. Strike two: The place itself is cute but a little awkwardly designed. Our long metal table and stools were just not comfy. I don't mind occasionally bumping elbows, but nobody should have a difficult time eating their meal due to lack of table space. Especially, when we had reservations for over a week. They knew we had a large party coming! Give us some room! And if you do happen to sit near the front, don't pay any mind to the farmer with the large bulge painted on the wall (as one of my lovely dining companions pointed out). Awkwarrrrrddddd.Strike three: Random service nuances that bother me. The server was nice enough, but there were times where he over watered us, vanished into thin air, and took away plates before people were finished. I still had my knife and fork in hand when he tried to take my chicken! For a place that pushes local, ecologically sustainable dining, they sure are quick to throw away food that isn't finished! I don't know that any of us felt that we got our money's worth. If the dishes had been perfectly cooked and seasoned, maybe. But (and I understand that local organic food costs more) I felt it was a little overpriced for what they plated out.The third star from my review solely goes out to the roasted Amish chicken. This dish is the stand out star at Farmhouse and an absolute must try. I wanted to roll around in that perfectly roasted  crispy chicken skin. And I am not one to usually eat the skin. Served with it were cumin carrots and spaetzle. This would not have been my choice of sides, but they were ok.Another plus was their wine and beer selection. Fantastic. But when you come to a restaurant to eat, you can't expect the booze to save the place from poor execution in the kitchen. Although it does help a little... Maybe it was just an off-night for Farmhouse, which can happen, but three strikes doesn't make me want to come back anytime soon. I'll give them some time to get their stuff together, and maybe come back for that chicken. And a drink. Maybe."
"Wow - possibly the worst experience ever.  My girlfriends and I arrived for a 7:30 reservation only to have to wait over thirty minutes to be seated.  Once we were seated it took another thirty minutes to even place a drink order, we still had not received water or had our order taken.  Although they gave us a bottle of champagne as an apology, the situation never improved!  It took twenty minutes for a bottle of wine to be served, and we still had not received water.  We finally received a few appetizers but then waited some more to place our dinner order.  We finally placed our dinner order after physically hunting down our server.  By 9:30 we finally said forget it and talked to the manager.  He apologized some more but by that time we said if our food wasn't on its way out of the kitchen we wanted to leave.  Our food order had clearly never been placed with the kitchen because no one knew when it would arrive to our table.  We finally just left hungry.As an aside - the one star is for the cheese curds as an appetizer which were phenomenal."
"Yum! Came here on a Friday and loved the food. We delved right into entrees, with the white fish and bone-in pork chop. Portions were huge, an entire white fish (deboned of course) sat on a bed of flavorful butter and fingerling potatoes. The fish was so tender and delicate, yet with perfectly crisped skin. The pork chop had just a hint of pink and was tender and flavorful as well. I have a pretty healthy appetite for a girl and could barely finish the white fish. We ended up sharing the pastie pie which was not my favorite as it was too rich, but that's personal preference. Though I enjoyed the energetic vibe, it was waaaaay too noisy for conversation, I found myself hoarse at the end of the meal. Next time I'll just use my mouth to chew. Looks like a good place for drinks too (after which you can just hop onto the brown line and spare everyone a DUI!)."
"This place is overpriced for the quality if food. I ordered a chicken dish that was so salty, I couldn't eat it. We also ordered a flatbread pizza with blue cheese that was disgusting. On a lighter note, the cheese curds and margaritas were good. Not a good place for dinner, though."
"Cute farm animals in the window, and sensible farm-to-table Midwestern grub... what's not to love here? I'm going to get right to the point here: CHEESE CURDS! CHEESE CURDS! I've lived in the Midwest for the past 3 years and I am a little bit grumpy that this is the first time I've had them. And they were good, SO GOOEY-GOOD. Yum. The grass-fed burgers are notable as well. You can definitely taste the difference in the freshness of the food, which I appreciated. This is a little bit off topic, but I loved the bathroom. It was total barnyard-rustic-chic. Does it make me a bit of a yuppie to declare my love for fresh, organic, farm-to-table food? Oh well, I don't care! Love you, Farmhouse, I'll be back!"
Love decor but not the service. Service was slow. Food so so. My favorite is roasted baby beet.
"Awesome food and the service was great. Probably one of the best veggie burgers I've had. And I like that you can actually have a conversation and not talk over loud music or the people next to you. I'm going there again so that I comment more on this place.. but so far, it's good."
"A+. Farmhouse is reminiscent of an old farmhouse and is warm and cozy on a cold winter night. We came here with a big group a few weekends ago and had a wonderful time. They have a great selection of craft beers and the bartender was really knowledgeable and has great recommendations. The food is fork to farm and delicious. It's a small menu, which I like, with specials which consist of what the chef finds locally. Farmhouse is a great, refreshing spot for a mouth watering meal."
"After the rave reviews from Colleen C, the wife and I decided to come here for a celebration on a Sunday night. We arrived a few minutes early, but the place was not crowded and we were seated right away. The decor of the restaurant is aged and a mismatch of furniture, to give the place an old, rustic feel, which I thought was well executed. The waitress came and explained that Farmhouse tries to only work with local wineries, breweries and farms. Almost everything comes from Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Indiana. They have 25+ beers on tap, all from one of those 4 states, plus a ton more in bottles stored in a 1934 Bevador (google it if you don't know what one looks like).We started with the Wisconsin Cheese Curds which are the best cheese curds I've had outside of Monroe, Wisconsin. They were fantastic. We also split the beet salad, which was delicious as well. Usually I find beets to only be OK, but the beets on this salad were great, and all the flavors blended well together.For the main course, the wife had the roasted chicken. Rarely would one of us order chicken at a restaurant, but it sounded good. It was beyond good. It was cooked to perfection, was super moist and flavorful. I'd say it might be one of the best roasted chickens I've ever tasted. Rarely does chicken wow me over, but this was excellent. I ordered the steak. The steak was very good (of course, rare is steak not) and could rival most steak places.For desert we split the ""Not a Brandy Alexander"" which is ice cream, stout, and a shot of bourbon. This was excellent. I love bourbon to begin with, and the ice cream mixed up with the bourbon made a excellent, but not overly sweet, desert.The only reason this place gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because of how close the table are to each other. We had a table for 2, and there was a 2 inch gap between the next table. We didn't really notice, until another couple was placed next to us, then it felt like we were having dinner with another couple. That being said, until I get my own Bevador, I'll come back here again."
"Food gets a 3.5 star but the service was terrible and that completely ruined it for me. A restaurant with great food and poor service is not somewhere I would return to. Service:Took our waiter 20 minutes to greet us and get us some water on a Wednesday night at 8pm - point being it was NOT crowded. He was also kind of rude the whole time and seemed like he was not interested in serving us - huge turnoff. He seemed much more interested in the guys on the other side since he spent WAY more time talking to them and coming back to their tables. When we ordered dessert, it didn't come for a good 30 mins. We finally waved him down and when I asked when our dessert would come, he SNAPPED and said ""Well we bake them fresh so it's going to take a while"". At that point, I was like, EXCUSE ME? First of all, he did not tell us that the particular dessert would take 20 mins to make (usually restaurants tell you ahead of time or in print). Second of all, there is no reason to be so rude when we're asking a perfectly reasonable question. To top it off, he took forever to get our checks. But of course, when we were done signing the check, he was very quick to grab it and bid us goodbye. Terrible. Left a bad taste in my mouth.Food:Cheese curds: Expected much better so was a little disappointed. The batter wasn't fantastic. It was soggy and meh. But I love my cheese so I still ate it all up. Trout: Fantastic. Can't really complain. Generous portion of fish, very nicely done. Apple pie dessert: Fresh baked (apparently) with ice cream. Not spectacular but enjoyable. It was a regular baked apple pie. Nothing special.I'm not even motivated to write a review of their food because the service was such a turn off. Overall, the food was good and with good service, I would have definitely come back to try other items on their menu. But bad service like this is unacceptable. Especially on a Wednesday night at 8pm when no one is really there. I am very disappointed. Will not be coming back."
"I left Farmhouse on Sat night frustrated and hungry.I had heard such good things. What had I done wrong? Well it must have been my ordering...Mussels to start - weak amount of broth and I'm pretty sure there this dish contained pepperoni. Pepperoni or not, the tasteless meat looking disks were totally unnecessary. That said, the mussels were delightful compared to the grainy mustard soaked beet and rocket arugula salad. Oh man that is bad dressing.My dinner companion had the ""classic"" burger which was small enough to be a slider. Would have been better off served with two friends in appetizer form.  In fact, every plate seemed tiny for its price tag. Oh and they don't have any pickles here. That should change. Two stars because this place is cute, our waitress was nice and the beer was decent."
"Excellent burgers (and not overly expensive) and a nice local beer selection. I just wish they had more Wisconsin beers. It's got a really nice ambiance, if a little narrow. Definitely a good first date place. Next time I'm trying the cheese curds."
"Somewhat of a hole in the wall place located in an interesting spot (near the tracks on Chicago, across from Lightology).  Adorable place that looks like it should be just a bar (actually, it IS a bar too), very good food, made with high quality ingredients.  My husband had a burger and he rated it a 4 out of 5 because he thought the burger was too small a bit over done.  He asked for Medium Rare and they made it Medium.  He'd come back though.I had the veggie burger with smoked gouda cheese.  I loved the burger but thought the cheese overpowered it just a tad.  The cheese curds are a MUST.  DELICIOUS!!! A bit salty but still so tasty.I wasn't a fan of their homemade ketchup and mustard but I like the fact that it is HOMEMADE.Sodas were great too, we had cream soda and ginger ale.  Authentic tasting but $4 a small glass, filled mostly with ice-kinda pricey.Overall, thought this place deserved a 4 star based on the high quality of ingredients used, friendly staff and tasty meal we had.  I'd say 4.5 if there was an option but there isn't.For 2 burgers, 2 drinks and an appetizer for lunch, we paid around just over $50 w/tip.  Pricey for lunch but these days, all these fancy burger joints charge the same $10+ and charge extra for toppings, that's where they make bank.  Kinda like Best Buy selling all the accessories to you when you came in for just a phone.You'll enjoy this place, check it out.  Casual yet urban."
"Fantastic Service.  Very Good Food.  Did I mention fantastic service?  If you like good food and great service in a fun atmosphere, you must try Farmhouse.Went to Farmhouse for the first time tonight.  We arrived a little late for our reservation so we had to wait a bit for a table to open up.  The hostess offered the bar downstairs or upstairs while we waited.  The limited space downstairs caused us to try the latter.  Turns out there's limited space everywhere but we were able to make our way to the end of the upstairs bar.We were warmly greeted by one of the servers who showed us their extensive beer menu [gold star].  Even though we were standing at part of the bar were the servers have to get drinks for the tables, the staff was very nice about working around us [gold star].  When I suggested the beer list looked longer than the amount of taps behind the upstairs bar, one of the other servers said they would run downstairs to get the beer for us saying, ""we are here to serve you."" [gold star].  The two beers we ordered (she a Finch's Golden Wing and me a Half Acre Over Ale) were, in fact, only available downstairs, but, after ordering, it was only a couple of minutes before our server appeared with the brews [gold star].  I like how they note the distance between the restaurant and the breweries on the menu.One of the hostesses found us upstairs just to give us a status on when our table would be ready [gold star]; made me feel like they hadn't forgotten about us just because we were upstairs.  We were eventually sat downstairs next to the bar.  The decor is very interesting [modern farmhouse chic?]  Our food server came by promptly after we sat down [gold star].  We ordered the Cheese Curds right away based on recommendations from others.  They were great with a very light batter.Our server was very helpful with questions about the rest of the menu and checked back often to see how we were doing throughout the meal [gold star].  We ordered the Burger (+ blue cheese and bacon).  It was properly cooked, well seasoned and tasted char-grilled.  The ketchup is and tasted homemade.  It was a bit too tomato-y for me, but I had requested some of the Roasted Garlic Mayo from appetizer menu which worked well with the ketchup.  The Shoestring Fries were good but not memorable.  We also ordered the Pulled Pork Pastie.  It was a bit on the dry side (which can often be the case with pulled pork; our server had told us before we ordered it might be a bit on the dry side; she brought us extra sauce which helped).We each ordered a House Made Soda (she a Ginger Ale and me a Root Beer).  Both were good although the root beer was a bit too light on the caramel flavor than what I prefer; I would order it again.We finished up the meal with local Mead (from Beverly) and a Pumpkin Whoopie Pie dessert special (new this week).  The mead was quite good.  The dessert was 4 small, two-bite-sized pies with homemade filling.  Perfect size and not too sweet or rich for my taste.Throughout the meal, we were visited by many different people bringing the food and drinks and clearing plates and glasses.  All were friendly and had a smile on their face [gold star].  The folks who brought the food and drinks did so while explaining what they were bringing (I think this is a great way to make sure you receive what you actually ordered; it would also decrease the time you'd have to wait for help if the wrong thing was brought to your table) [gold star].We had the chance to met Ferdia tonight and I'm glad I was able to tell him in person how great the service was."
"Oh Farmhouse. You seductive temptress. I worked next to you for MONTHS and never walked in...how could I have been so misguided? Anyway, due to the wisdom of my fellow yelpers, I made a res for Saturday night since I am not a fan of sitting at the bar. I was immediately seated and given a menu. When I perused the menu, I wanted to order all of it. No joke.I started off with the House red on tap (they have wines on tap...omg, have my babies) and tried to narrow down what I wanted. Amish chicken? Poblano pepper and mushroom burger? HMMMM. Choices, choices. I liked the idea of the chicken dumpling soup & beet and rocket salad. I can sort of be healthy and enjoy myself too, right? Just kidding about the healthy part. We started off with the fried cheese curds.I guess you can never really go wrong with fried cheese and homemade catsup. Salty, crispy, hot cheesy goodness. Bliss in a bowl. Next I received the soup and the salad.The chicken dumpling soup was very disappointing. I should admit here that I make a phenomenal chicken 'n dumpling meal, and I judge everything against that. It's not terribly fair. Anyway. It's not that Farmhouse's version was bad, it was just really boring. It was a standard chicken stock with carrots, 4 chunks of chicken and 3 dumplings. Based on the other things I ate at the Farmhouse, I know that's not the best they can do. Shake it up guys. This dish needs an extreme makeover.The salad, on the other hand, was delightful. It was huge (piles of rocket and roasted beets) and the entire salad was doused in a mustard seed vinaigrette, which would make anything delicious. There were touches of roasted walnuts and goat cheese, but the beets, the rocket and the vinaigrette were the stars of the show.My husband ordered the burger with gouda cheese and he dove into it with no condiments, which was rare. ""If a burger doesn't need condiments, you know it's a winner,"" he said. Aye aye, captain!For dessert we split the toffee and fig bread pudding with a salted cream topping. It came out piping hot.DIE. OMG.I love bread pudding and this didn't disappoint. I love figs and the dessert was wonderful. I would eat this again.Aside from one misstep, our dinner at the Farmhouse was tasty and we would definitely come back. The wine on tap is calling my name..."
OUR WAITRESS WAS THE FRICKIN' BEST and the food rocked.  All around 5+ stars.  I will go again for sure
"i went here to celebrate my birthday last night and I really enjoyed it. First off, the space is great. If I'm not mistaken it used to be a coffeeshop I went to from time to time. Exposed brick, great decor, well done washrooms (although no paper towel, which I know is environmentally friendlier, but I hate touching a doorknob after people cause y'all know half of them folks didn't wash. yucko.)the menu is interesting and there were lots of great choices. We had the cheese curds to share, which were perfectly salty and fried, and gooey. My friends also had their special on offer, a salad with eggplant and orange zest and all sorts of other goodness, which they loved. i had a regular old burger, but the meat was really good, and the marinated chilies were a perfect addition of sweet and spicy.Three of us had one of their specialty cocktails, the ""Humdinger"", which was, well, a humdinger. It was floral and light and all around great. We had the sweet corncake with strawberry crumble (dehydrated strawberries, I think - tastes a bit like Captain Crunchberries, which is actually pretty awesome.). i was skeptical as I come from a southern family and it's really easy to mess up sweet corncake, but it was good.So why the 4 stars? B/c if I could I'd give it 3.5 for the service. It took forever for someone to approach our table and tell us any specials, and doubly long to get water.  We had to ask twice for water.  We came in staggered, with two people arriving ten minutes later; they ordered their drinks, and all of our cocktails came out before the water. That's about 25 min waiting for water. ugh.My burger came out almost raw and I asked for it to be nuked. My friend who wanted her burger to come out raw, hers came out overcooked. The bight spot is that they remade my entire burger, which actually made me feel a bit wasteful, but at least I was able to eat it.  The fries were good, but there was no pepper and salt on the table. I need pepper on my fries. but i figured the fries would be dead cold by the time we got the server's attention, so I left it. but here are the two big problems that everyone at our table had an issue with: my boyfriend was served a glass that was spotless but smelled strongly of mildew. More than likely someone had inadvertently wiped the glass with a rag that wasn't clean. Four of us smelled it and were repulsed. The waitress says, ""I don't smell anything, but I can get you a new glass."" I thought that was incredibly unprofessional. Also, when we were choosing desserts, we settled on the corncake and the smores sundae to share and she waits until after we've said to tell us, ""y'now, unfortunately, we're out of that one."" Waitaminute. You didn't even check with the kitchen, which means you knew you were out of that dessert, so why didn't you tell us earlier? She just sort of had an attitude and was less than friendly (although friendliness isn't required, it is appreciated) about it.Overall, the service leaves something to be desired, but the food is great. Just bring a water bottle with you in case you get thirsty."
"Excited to try Farmhouse, because of the locally sourced, fresh food model, and they served WI cheese curds.We arrived right at our reservation time, but had to wait about 15 minutes for table for 2 to open up.  Similar to other reviewers, if you come with a small party, it is a bit more difficult to be seated, due to the large amount of family-style benches.  But we were ok with the wait, and enjoyed a beer.The tables and chairs were cute, rustic, and mis-matched.  However, the tables were metal (and thus cold when setting your hands or bare arms down on them), and the seating was not too comfortable.  I had to actually move myself from the bench along the wall to a chair.  It feels like they tried to cram a lot into a very small space.Regardless of the seating situation... hands down - Farmhouse has the best, most authentic cheese curds in Chicago.  I was smitten.  I could have eaten 4 orders of them.  The pot-pie like dish, which I believe is no longer on the menu, was filled with pork, and it was a little dry.  So we asked for more of the sauce that was on top of the pot pie, and that solved the problem.  The farmhouse burger was spectacular, freshly prepared, full of flavor, and did not leave us with anything left to desire.We loved the atmosphere, the excellent service by both our waitress and the owner, and will be back to try more local goodies off the menu."
"Ok wow! This place has top notch service. From the hostess staff to the wait staff, bartenders, managers, everyone. Fabulous customer service! Now on to the food.... It was wonderful. Very fresh ingredients and you can tell that everything is made in house that includes their condiments. I had the patty melt and the tomatoes soup along with fries. One of the best patty melts that I have had in a very long time. The soup was amazing and the fries were so fresh and tasty without being overly salted like most places.  I highly recommend this place! It's sooo hard to find a place that has both exceptional food and customer service!"
"Cannot speak highly enough about this place!! The food is awesome, the service and ambience excellent... farm to table, that's how fresh the food is!! Get the cheese curds, beer nuts, tavern fries for appetizers, you won't be disappointed... wide selection of beers...On different occasions, I've had the fish, chicken and short ribs... I've also had the burgers... and everything was so tasty!! I went there for brunch as well, and am so glad I did!! This is THE place to hang out with friends, to relax, have a great meal and a great time !!"
"Great service, great food and a fun atmosphere. Awesome spot to catch up with friends."
"Without any backstory here is a solid review.  Friday night, 7:30, no reservations, walk over from a few blocks away, no seats, 1 hour wait, walk to the bar..guy gets up my girlfriend and I sit down...perfect.while looking over the menus we start chatting with a few different bartenders who are all on top of their game.  I was almost sold on the trout after being told it was so fresh it was literally swimming 36 hours ago up north in Wisco.  After ordering a good bottle of wine we decided to start with the flat bread of the day.  while we are waiting for the flat bread my gf & I continued talking with the staff at the bar.  we were both extremely pleased with not only how knowledgable everyone is about what is being served but how genuinely happy and excited they are to talk about it.  i truly appreciate that about FarmhouseGF orders grass fed skirt steak & I went with half roasted amish chicken...both were nothing short of amazing.  the food was every bit as good as the service which is what we were hoping for...lastly, as we were finishing up our meal we got to talking with TJ one of the owners and his lovely wife Molly.  What a wonderful experience when you can sit at a bar on a Friday night with the owner of the restaurant and listen to how he dreamed this place up.  . decor picked from a south side scrap yard to the old Charlies up in Lincoln Park...  A great bar/restaurant with awesome food and service... I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.-make a reservation or be prepared to sit at the bar ( which is totally fine for full service)-sneak in on a week night vs. saturday or sunday-come for lunch-great mixed drinks AND on tap beer selection"
"All around fantastic dinner!  They had reservations open on a Friday night (it was kind of an early dinner reservation though, so I don't know if it is a normal routine, although they seem pretty busy, so I'm sure if you can get an RSVP, go for it!  The server was very knowledgeable about their selection of beers on tap, and was able to suggest at least 2-3 options based on what the members in our dinner party liked.  She also mentioned what was not available upfront, which was very helpful.  Based on other reviews, we HAD to order the fried cheese curds and homemade ketchup.  AMAZING.  The ketchup was top notch, and cheese curds were just the right amount of chewy, salty, cheesy deliciousness.  Had to eat them quick though, not the same texture when it gets slightly cold.  For the main course, I ordered the beef short ribs with some kind of cheese-based gnocchi, root veggies and apples.  It was very tender and the meat just flaked with a touch of the fork.  My friend who ordered the pork shoulder dish was very pleased with hers as well.  Definitely a great gastropub, and the decor is very cutely hipster and farm like, if that combination makes any sense :D"
"Very nice experience. We had delicious cheese curds and a pork belly flat bread as appetizers, an they were tasty and interesting.  My entree burger was cooked a little more than I requested, but was nonetheless a quality burger, better than most in Chicago. I had four interesting local beers, although one was not the one I asked for. Our bartender was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. I look forward to going back."
"Great beer selection, entertaining waiter, tried the Shepard's pie the first night it was on the menu, the crust was a little charred, but the flavor was spot on. Finally, a restaurant that really channels hearty, Midwestern foods."
"My boyfriend and I took his parents to Farmhouse to give it a try last Saturday for lunch.  We were excited to have a new place right around the corner from us and were eager to try it.  We definitely were mistaken and would NEVER go back.  Honestly I don't get how this place has so many 4 and 5 stars unless these reviewers either work there or are friends with the owner.... just saying.  It started okay enough, the hostess and our waitress were very friendly.  We were literally the only people in the restaurant and it seemed like they had far too many workers there on a Saturday afternoon, mostly just standing around.  Our waitress took our order quickly since we had to catch a volleyball match in an hour.  We figured 1 hour would be plenty of time for lunch...   15 minutes into waiting for our appetizer, she told us that the chef was having ""issues"" with the kitchen and things weren't working properly.  That was interesting... we asked her if we should go somewhere else and she said no, no, just another 5 minutes.  It ended up being an hour of her telling us just another 5 minutes...  At that point we decided we could no longer wait and got up to leave.  She didn't even come to apologize or offer to get the manager... NOTHING!  We had to tell the hostess we were leaving who got our waitress from the back.  She said she was sorry but it wasn't her fault as she can not fix the kitchen.  Not the appropriate response in my book as a former waitress.  That was definitely a manager situation and she didn't even offer to get him/her.  She was even going to make us pay for our cokes, until my boyfriend said the least you could do was pick up the $10.  She ended up agreeing but didn't offer a gift certificate to come back or anything.  This was one of the most disappointing experiences I have ever had.  We were embarassed that we took his parents there in the first place.  This is the first and hopefully last time I ever leave a restaurant hungier then when I arrived.  Farmhouse you better get your act together and quick otherwise you will suffer the same fate as Bar Louie."
"This makes me sad since I had my birthday dinner here. We made a reservation for 8:30, got there a little early, and went to the upstairs bar to have a drink. The bartender seemed extremely busy, even though there weren't that many people around. He finally came over and asked for my id, then we waited another 5 minutes, then he came back and asked for our orders. We ordered and he made some comment about how it was going to take a long time since we all ordered different things. What does that mean? Kinda rude. Also, 20 minutes later I still didn't have a drink since he started pouring beers for other customers. Dude! Its my fucking birthday! Give me my drink! Then we sat, waited 10 minutes for a server, who actually was really nice. But the food was meh. I was really disappointed. The bacon mac and cheese fritters were only so so. And they were warm, not hot. This was the theme for the rest of the meal. Four of us were there, and two entrees came out 10 minutes before the other two. Also they were tepid at best. The burger was good, but not hot. Also only warm. The short ribs though - they were cold. Really? for $21 you can't cook warm food? Then one of the owners cam over and said hi, and they gave me a birthday bred pudding (which was tasty), but I didn't want to complain and make everyone uncomfortable. To summarize:Nice atmosphereOk drinksDecent burgersSlow bartender (and I know those drinks are handmade, but really)Cold foodBad kitchen expoNot recommended. Actually at the table someone said, ""Well we're clearly never coming back,"" Thats not too good.I did give it 2 stars though because the server was nice AND they had trick birthday candles which provided us with endless amusement."
"Let's get my two minor complaints out of the way: It was a bit warm on the second floor, where we were seated (it was nearly 100 degrees outside, so I may have been hypersensitive to this factor) and they didn't have any bourbon. That's it. Everything else was great. We were welcomed and seated very warmly and immediately and our server was extremely friendly and engaging, if a tiny bit too talkative initially. He was very warm and definitely both knew and liked the food and cocktails Farmhouse offers. We started with the french fries w/roasted garlic mayo and a beet and rocket salad, both of them delicious. I ordered the beef short ribs and my wife had the trout and both were delicious as well as locally sourced, like 90% of everything they offer. For dessert the bread pudding was wonderful and considering the area and quality of the food, I found the prices to be quite reasonable. No question we would return to dine there again.Also, we found a parking spot right across the street. That's pretty rare in downtown Chicago."
"Nothing but great things to say about this place.  Great experience all around for our dinner with a group of 5.  We got a table near the front and prompt and attentive service all night.  The waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable about the details going into the food and the local sourcing of said food.I thought the menu was delicious.  We started off with a few appetizers, the stand out were the Wisconsin cheese curds, deep fried in beer batter as is the Wisconsin style (at least in my family).  They were probably my favorite version of fried curds I've had in Chicago (Bad Apple is a close second), because the batter to curd ratio was pretty much perfect, and it was a tasty beer batter.  We all ordered a different item and we all tried each others dishes, and everything we ordered - Amish Chicken, Beef Short Ribs, Chicken Pot Pie, Pork Chop, and the Steak - were all really good.  I ordered the steak, which I have to say I was really impressed with.  This wasn't a super rare cut of meat or fancy preparation, i.e. no aged 75 day ribeye's, but it was juicy and tender, cooked to my specifications, and joyously flavorful.  It was also only 27$, which is so reasonable for a steak of that magnitude, another reason I think this place is great.  Most of the sub-30$ steaks I've eaten required so much effort to chew them that I forgot to enjoy them.The beer list was another win for this place.  While it's not as extensive as some craft brew specialty places, the reason for that is clear and understandable, mostly everything is locally sourced.  Still, there were over 20 beers on tap, they were all 6-8$ per glass, and they contained lots of my midwestern favorites.  Overall a delicious meal and a great experience.  If you enjoy supporting and enveloping yourself in the charm of the midwest, while paying midwestern prices, Farmhouse is for you."
"I wanted to love this place, but my overall visit was just ""meh"".I went during Restaurant Week without making a reservation (oops!) and sat with a friend at the bar.  Because the hostess said that eating at the bar was an option, I was surprised at the lack of service my friend and I had there.  While the bartenders meandered back and forth, we had to flag someone down every time we wanted to order something and they never checked in on us.  A bit frustrating.As for the food... meh.  In all fairness, I'm not a huge seafood fan, and I ordered the trout which tasted super fish-y to me.  The slaw on top was AWESOME though, as was the potato gratin it was served with.  My friend ordered the short ribs, which I REALLY wish I had ordered, but c'est la vie!  Our split dessert, the trifle, was hands down my favorite thing that was ordered.  I loved all the different flavors, and they played well with each other.  Lastly, the drink menu was great.  I loved the beer choices, and even though their cocktail ""menu"" is small, they have a variety of tasty liquors behind the counter if you know what kind of drink you'd like.  I paired a chocolate ale with the trifle and I'm not sure I've ever picked a better combination in all my life.  Next time I'm in the area looking for a watering hole, I'd come back here."
"Local food, local beers, and local atmosphere.  This place feels like Chicago.  We were able to get reservations here through a friend.  We were lucky because they were slammed.  It's cozy in there a little tight.  You might as well greet your neighbors, they will be hearing everything you say.  This adds to the home cooked feel of this place.  They have a good selection of local beers on tap.  I was especially happy when I saw they had Flossmoor Station Pullman Brown Ale.  One of my favorites and I had never been to a restaurant that has had it on tap.  They also have a wide variety of cocktails and fancy drinks for you non-beer drinkers.  The food is great. I had the beef short ribs.  They are served on top of wild rice and lemon asparagus (never heard of that before, but boy howdy did it ever dance in my mouth) . Served with a mustard jus.  This tastes exactly like my Ma's brisket with mustard  jus.  Which is a compliment of the highest regard.  The beef was tender and screamed flavor.  The rice was a nice compliment to the beef and like I said the lemon asparagus was off the hook.  My one complaint would be they only give you two ribs, which for 21 bucks, is a tad small.  My dining companion had the roasted chicken and was served with blue cheese mashed potatoes.  The bites I got were delicious.  Chicken was well seasoned and roasted to perfection.  And those mashed potatoes is something I am going to have to steal from them.  For dessert we shared a 'Not a Brandy Alexander'.  Oatmeal stout with ice cream and a shot of whiskey,  good. Very good.Everyone from the hosts to the waiter to the busboys were friendly and helpful and we never waited to long for our drinks, food, or refills on a extremely busy night.  Well done Farmhouse!"
I had one of my best experiences here the other night for dinner. I absolutely love the locally sourced farm to table concept and my meal was top notch! The atmosphere is nice and inviting and the service was excellent. Great wine selection and the drink menu and local beers looked great too. I will definitely add this restaurant to my rotation and frequent often!
"I really wanted to love this place.  Farm to tavern restaurant.  Everything made from scratch and local.  Comfortable atmosphere, friendly service; I would love to support them but the food is subpar.  Had the fried cheese curds.  I could barely taste the cheese.  It was mainly fried batter.The burger was a salt lick.  almost inedible.  Maybe they just had an off day or someone a little more heavy handed that day.  I might give them a second chance but it would be tough."
"Went here for dinner on a friday night with the boyfriend.  We arrived early because we didn't have a reservation.  We were told by the maitre'd that  it would be a 45 minute wait.  I was ok with that, until we went upstairs to the bar and watched all of the empty tables sit empty for two hours.  We eventually ate at the bar.  Apparently, they wouldn't seat parties of two at the bigger tables.  The waitress told us that we would have been expected to, um, sit b***h on a long table between two other couples because there were only two of us instead of 3 or 4.  It really doesn't sound like fun, and I'm not very excited to come back.2 stars for grass fed beef though.  We need more restaurants serving grass fed beef."
"Friendly staff, tons of craft beers, quick service, but I wasn't impressed with the food.  I ordered the short rib Sloppy Joe.  It sounded good on the menu and it looked good when it arrived, but I found it kind of bland and oily.  The Chicken Noodle soup, however, was decent;  homemade with fresh veggies and chunks of chicken.  All in all, though, I don't need to return.  I'll keep sampling the other neighborhood options."
"Eaten here on 3 or 4 occasions now and would highly recommend it. The food is good, my favorite being the Amish Chicken, really tasty if not very slightly salty. Beer selection is ok, always seem to be out of lots when I go! Missing a good ale IMHO."
"We have heard good things about this place and finally stopped by on a snowy night.  Yes, it tries to source local and make as much in house as possible.  For example, they make their own condiments and sausage, etc. The beer, wine and cocktail list did not disappoint, eclectic and local.  I swear every table got the fried cheese curd app and it was right the right thing to go with drinks.  You should be glad they don't sell entree size of them, because you will gladly order them again for dinner.Salad was crunchy, burger was delish, mussels were tasty but on the small size.  Bread pudding had to be ordered and the salty whip cream on top made the dish!The decor and service was A+, the food and drinks were solid, and we appreciate the local sourcing. We would gladly come back with some friends to share more entrees. Very enjoyable, but not a destination restaurant and don't expect to be blown away by the food."
"I first noticed Farmhouse while passing by on the Chicago Avenue bus several weeks ago. What once was a small coffee shop now bore a large ""Farmhouse"" sign with barn animals and a warm glow of happy people eating emanating from the front window. I was intrigued.So a few weeks ago, we ventured over to check out Farmhouse on a Sunday night. We weren't sure if we needed a reservation, but we made one anyway -- and good thing, too, because the place was pretty crowded for the end of a weekend. The noise level, coupled with the TVs at the bar, actually made for a much more boisterous night out than we had anticipated.Our server, too, had lots of energy, and was super-enthusiastic about nearly every item on the menu. I ended up trying a skin-on trout fillet with leeks and potatoes that was moist and flavorful, and my date loved his burger, which was cooked to his ideal level of doneness.Our two-top table was so close to the next one that I often felt tempted to interrupt their conversation, so I wouldn't recommend this place if you prefer more privacy when dining out. Otherwise, it's definitely worth checking out while it still has the aura of relative obscurity."
Great atmosphere. Friendly staff.  Classic Farm Burger was averages. Egg White frittata was good. Bloody Mary was sub-par.
"I had dinner here last night with my wife. First time for both of us. We were impressed. Generally excellent farm-to-table Midwest-style food and a great, if not encyclopedia-extensive, beer list, focusing on Midwest microbrews. Michigan wines on tap! We had the beer nuts and beef jerky and cheese curds appetizer. You see cheese curds a lot these days, but these are better than most I've had in Chicago. Then we had the roast chicken (excellent and succulent, not boring at all) with cumin carrots and spaetzle and the pulled pork shoulder pastie, also terrific. Nothing mind-blowing, just very solid American food.Service was outstanding, friendly, on top of everything. Decor is fun, I guess a meld of rustic farm and modern/urban loft styles.Convenient location right near the Chicago Brown Line stop. Will definitely be back."
Overrated. Had the trout. Was good but not spectacular. Beer selection was nice as was the ambiance. Not sure I'd be back unless I saw a crowd of hot mommas in there. Would be great if they offered a flight to sample all the different beers they sell.
Meh. Maybe because some friends hyped this place up but I thought it was below par for the price point they have set.
"I live in the neighborhood and noticed Farmhouse Tavern on my way to dinner last Saturday night.  After dinner, we decided to stop in and have a drink to check the place out... what a pleasant surprise we had!  Not only was the menu simple, but classy, the decor was very comfortable and welcoming.  We instantly knew that we would be coming back on a regular basis.The downstairs was fairly crowded having only been open for less than a week, so we decided to have a drink or two upstairs at the bar.  The bartender was more than friendly and was happy to educate us on all of the local spirits that Farmhouse Tavern has to offer; all of the vodka, gin, etc. is local.  There were a few drinks on the menu that were interesting.. such as the ""Hum-dinger""... made with Hum spirit.  The tantilizing smell of the drink alone will leave you wanting to try more.All in all, this is not your 'typical' Chicago bar.  Frankly, a breath of fresh air in the midst of a neighborhood filled with late night dance clubs.  Cheers."
"Great meal and great experience.  Love the ""rustic chic"" decor.  Also love the emphasis on local ingredients, from food to wines & beers.  Our server was knowledgeable and attentive.  We sat in the upstairs dining room, so it took a little time for our drinks to reach us, but it was quieter up there so it was ok.  Food was delicious, especially the beer-braised short ribs, which were thankfully not very fatty but full on flavor.  It was a very good meal so we'll definitely return."
"My 3 star rating may simply be due to the fact that I'm a Veg.  So, meat eaters, just stop reading!I work in the area and stopped by for lunch last week.  The staff was super friendly, service was quick and atmosphere was great.  Food was average.  I spent $16 with tip (so a bit pricy for a weekday lunch), but was excited to try out the new kid on the block so willing to pay the price.We started with the Wisconsin Cheese Curds which were fantastic.  I'm not a big fried food person, but the batter was so light and airy they almost had no grease.  The homemade catsup (ketchup, whatever you please) was a surprising combination of smokey and sweet...a perfect pairing for the little cheeseballs :)Since it was a Friday, I thought I'd treat myself to a Veggie Burger as opposed to a salad and this is where I think I went wrong.  The taste was not bad, but the consistency was weird....falling apart, greasy (like it was deep fried).  The menu said it was a mushroom based burger, but I think I had one mushroom and (maybe) quinoa as the base?  But, like I said, it tasted fried.  So imagine fried quinoa....strange.  The other strange thing: my second round of catsup/ketchup was runny and had a completely different flavor...fail.  The garlic aioli on the other hand was a great complement to the crunchy and yummy fries.I think I'll definitely give this place another shot.  Maybe for after work drinks and apps since they have a very overwhelming (in a good way) beer list.  Or maybe a salad....But, Farmhouse, if you see this, switch to a just a veggie sandwich.  Fresh seasonal grilled veggies would be, oh so much, better and healthier!  I'm rooting for you! This area needs more lunch/after work spots."
"WINE ON TAP!?!?  Yes sir!Delicious burgers with gouda, blue or cheddar!?!? Yep!Amazing cheese curds?!!? You got it!Chips with fresh dill dip? You betcha!A nice owner that came over and introduced himself and asked how everything was?! YES!We were really happy leaving Farmhouse.  Three of us paid about $40/each with 2 glasses of tap wine each ($6), 2 bar snacks, a burger each and 1 bread pudding.Decor was super chill and really comfortable. Highly recommend a reservation. The first floor was packed when we got there at 7p last night (Tuesday), but luckily there is a whole second floor of tables/bar and we had a reservation.  By the time we left people were waiting for tables lined up blocking the front door..hard to get passed them, but no big deal.My only complaints:Bread pudding was just eh.Service got slower as the night progressed, but my guess is they're still working out the kinks.Menu is really small and limited. I'm pretty sure the entree options are as follows: roasted chicken, short ribs, burger, veggie burger. (don't get me wrong, all great options, just limited)"
"Our evening started off on the wrong foot.  We walked into a semi full restaurant.  The host staff was not on the ball.  The three people there seemed overwhelmed and weren't that helpful.  After standing there for a few minutes staring at the empty seats at the bar, we had to suggest that we sit at the bar.  I was on the verge of turning around and leaving thinking that this didn't bode well for the rest of our visit.It was a whole new world at the bar.  The bartenders were really pleasant.  The drinks and food were delicious!  I had the chicken.  The chicken was so good, but I wasn't a fan of the mashed potatoes.  They tasted like there was a lot of rosemary or some herb that I don't like.  My husband loved the mashed potatoes.  He got the yummy burger, so I ate his fries.  Eventhough I didn't like the mashed potatoes, I would order the chicken again because it was that tasty.  We will go back."
"Good, solid food. Farmhouse is a great neighborhood spot with great farm to table dishes, friendly service, and unique cocktails. The humdinger, Amish chicken and the cheese curds are must haves."
"I'm a fan of Farmhouse. They have comforting comfort food! They have a nice waitstaff! They have beer from exotic locations, like Michigan! Do note: I've visited on both a Tuesday and Friday, at 5:30 p.m., and the restaurant was relatively full. We were asked if we had reservations, we did not; we were told we could have the table for a couple hours. That's fine. But you might do well to make a reservation?"
"I really wanted to like this place.  I love the idea of local foods, and the menu looked delicious.  Our appetizer of fried cheese curds was pretty good, but not great.  I ordered the chicken and dumplings soup for my meal.  I thought it would be hearty and rich, but instead it was clear broth with a couple pieces of carrots and 5 marble sized pieces of dough.  Gross!  I think Farmhouse has a wonderful concept, but needs to work on the quality of their food."
"Everything was fine and satisfying, but I can't see going out of my way for this neighborhood bar/restaurant. All the sides are delicious; the mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts and fries are all good. It was a Tuesday night and the waitress was also the host, she handled the front well."
"The burger was good, but overall I wasn't impressed."
"Wow, this place has a fantastic beer list first off, with some hard-to-find beers on the list.  The menu has some great selections.  We started with the Wisconsin cheese ball, which is delicious, and we shared the roasted chicken, short rib, and burger.  All three were good, but the fall-off-the-bone short rib stood out as the best.  We finished with the bread pudding.  I am not a sweets person, but this could easily become addictive.  The service was attentive and personal, and the owners both give thoughtful suggestions and check in regularly to see that everything is going as it should.  Don't forget to try the wines on-tap either!This is a great addition to the River North neighborhood, and to the Chicago food scene as a whole."
"Get the cheese curds! They are delicious & fried lightly--similar to tempura style. The Mac & Cheese & asparagus is great too. I come here about once a month. The service is a little slow but overall, this place is great."
"Boyfriend and I wanted to go there on Friday at about 5 but ended up rolling in at 9pm and it was insanely busy.  We went back Sunday around 4, kinda confusing because of the time change, and they were still serving the lunch menu.  We were excited for the chicken and short ribs on the dinner menu, so we were a bit disappointed.  I think they are supposed to start serving dinner around then, but we asked and he said it was still lunch and the kitchen wasn't ready for dinner. I had the hum dinger, I think, with hum and sour...very good, but $10.  Also had a ginger ale...very good, but $4.  Boyfriend was very happy with the on tap wine...$5.  Chips and dill...good, but not hot.  Beet and goat cheese salad...very good, but kinda small for $10.  Boyfriend had the burger, it was good, but not hot and the Gouda cheese wasn't melted.  There's lots of good burgers around...flemmings, capital grill, 25 degrees...difference is that they are served hot!  I had the whitefish sandwich which was pretty tasty.  Upgraded to the mac and cheese since we already had the chips...it was pretty mediocre.  Server was very knowledgeable, disappeared at the end of the meal...took a long time for check, I think it was shift change.   I like the concept of using Midwest products.  Lots of micro brews on tap, If you are a beer lover.   Overall, the atmosphere was cute and warm.  Lots of high top stool type tables, not a fan. Food was a bit disappointing.  Service was pretty good.  Wish we could have eaten off the dinner menu."
Flatbread was great and great unique beers. Now that the weather is nice it's a great location to enjoy eating outdoors. I'll definitely be back.
"I live a couple blocks from Farmhouse and was happy to be able to check it out on its second night out of the gate.It has a massive list of beers on tap.  That alone deserves recognition.  And if you like urban views, and appreciate the irony in sitting in a place called Farmhouse and looking out the window at an ""L"" station, old warehouse buildings and a few new highrises, it's good for that, too.The beer I had was recommended by the server, and I liked it.  The food was good, too.  I had a beet salad, which was capably made.  I eat a lot of beet salads, and usually the idea is to just let the ingredients shine, which they did.  It didn't make me swoon in awe, but it was executed exactly right which is a good thing.As my main course I had their trout.  The trout was well-handled.  Perhaps ever-so-slightly overcooked, as the thinner portions were a bit dry, but the flavors were really nice.  Some of the accompanying potatoes were roasted to the point of tasting burnt.  And whoever deboned it missed a section of the spine and ribs.  But at their price point, that's not a big deal in my book.From a service standpoint, I do prefer when restaurants replace used cutlery between courses.  I don't think you have to be fine-dining to do that, and washing a couple hundred extra pieces of flatware over the course of a night probably doesn't even require any extra water, so I'm not convinced it has any eco-value, either.  So why not just replace the forks?So I enjoyed my meal.  The waiter was friendly and helpful, although I got the sense they could easily veer into condescension if they're successful and it goes to their heads so they should watch out for that.Four stars for a great first meal there, missing five due to the fork thing and the missed piece of backbone in the fish, and being a little slow bringing me the first beer.  But I will definitely be back."
"Mr. B and I went here on a Saturday night.  We had a reservation but did have to wait at the bar for about half an hour.  Normally would have bothered me but the manager and host came a couple of times to update us on the progress.We ordered:Wisconsin cheese balls-They were very good.  The breading had a taste of a savory funnel cake and they had great quality cheese.Chicken soup with dumplings-Mr B felt like this was the best thing he had all night.  It's easy for a soup to be over salty and that didn't happen.Pasties-I had never had a pasty before which is a northern delicacy.  It is basically a meat filled pie.  I really enjoyed it.  Mr B felt like it was a little salty and thought the cheese sauce on top was strange.  Of course, I will never complain about too much cheese.We also had a root beer from the soda fountain that came out clear but tasted great and a drink that I cannot remember the name of but while we were sitting at the bar waiting for the table I saw the bartender make a beautiful drink with fresh rosemary on top.  He would burn the rosemary slightly and it was a lovely smell.  So much so that I ordered one for my after dinner drink at our table upstairs.  It was a wonderful drink but I was sad that the bartender upstairs did not enhance the smell of the rosemary with fire like the bartender from downstairs.Overall, it was a great restaurant with beautiful decor, friendly staff and delicious food with local and fresh ingredients.Thanks, Farmhouse!  We'll be back!"
"Work down the street from here, and decided to stop in for lunch.I think this used to be the old Bar Louie, right by the Franklin Street El. It's got a simple, nice atmosphere. The food was excellent, as was the service. Food was made from local farmers, etc. and they had a good selection of American fare on the menu. Overall, it was a good experience, and I'll return."
"Amazing fried cheese curds, imaginative and fresh salads, creamy macaroni and cheese and pretty good mussels. Our waitress was helpful, attentive and upfront -- we asked about a particular bottle of wine and she suggested another instead."
What a cool neighborhood bar and restaurant.  Great Bloody Mary's. They make their own mix! Veggie Burger really tasty. New on menu is a Whitefish Cake. Wow!  Great atmosphere and great beer selection. Very knowledgeable bartenders.  Go there!
"This review is long overdue. I came here with a girl friend a few months back. We made a reservation for 7pm and were seated right away. The tables are so close to each other that we had no choice but to listen to what the people sitting next to us were saying. I had to get up out of my seat to let the lady at the table next to us out to go to the bathroom. Overall, the seating just made everything really awkward.The food however was pretty good. We started with the cheese curds and the potato chips with dill dip  I'm a fatty and love cheese and fried foods and was not at all disappointed by the cheese curds. So crispy and delicious. I'd go back just for these. The potato chips and dill dip were just ok.. nothing special and I dont really remember much about them except that I probably wouldnt get them again. We split the trout for an entree and it was really good. Very flaky and the potatoes were delicious. You could definitely tell it was cooked in a lot of butter, but after downing an order of cheese curds, worrying about butter was the last thing on our minds. The beer selection was great and is one of the main reasons I'm sure I'll be back to this place."
"Love everything but the seating. Waiters are amazing and great, food is awesome, just a little uncomfortable and squished. No place for a purse - under table hooks would help. I suppose space may be the price you pay for a place you like, but there are times I want to go places where I don't feel so crowded when I eat."
"great place they make there own grass fed burgers, condiments and sodas from scratch. They also offer craft beer"
"After a hard week, wanted to try someplace new with my hubby who likes local//vegetarian fare, and this was a very nice, rejuvenating experience.  The best part was the service; our waitress and the hostess were SUPER nice and friendly, they made sure we were seated in a cozy, romantic spot when I asked, and they never rushed us, even though they could have seated more than two at the table.  Much appreciated!  The rustic environment was very pleasant; I really liked the WPA-looking mural featuring Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan.  Felt right at home!The food was a solid good:  rocket salad with beets, goat cheese and mustard dressing was the highlight, and the desserts are lovely.  My burger with cheddar and bacon was cute (read: smallish) and could have been seasoned more.  It was not too juicy; definitely cooked more well than medium, and not warranting the $14 price tag overall, but whatever, when you're near downtown that's how the organic cookie crumbles.  I don't know if I'd go running back for the food, but I wouldn't say no if a friend wanted to go.  Nice joint."
"I usually enjoy restaurants like this and went into it expecting a lot.The ambiance is really nice when you walk in. Small and cozy.The restaurant prides itself on its unique beer menu from local breweries but it's the same selection seen at every other restaurant in Chicago (i.e. Metropolitan, Allagash, Goose Island, Three Floyds, etc.) in that area.We ordered a few appetizers. The cheese curds were NOT good. It's hard to mess this up. I agree that the gastropub style of farmhouse attempts to modernize comfort food but it was a total miss.For entrees, the chicken dish was rather ordinary. It was good but there was nothing unique about it. Surprisingly, the vege burger was delicious. It compares to the one at Sable and is unique in it's own regard.Why three stars? Because the vege burger was really good, beer selection was ok, and the ambiance was nice. I'd return with a group of friends as a nice place for dinner but would never order out (if the option existed) as the food is mediocre."
"I love the decor and service here! The waitstaff and bartender were all extremely friendly, and the bartender knew about each menu item to the smallest detail. I am not a pop drinker (I find it disgusting, syrupy and gross) but their homemade soda is really refreshing and tasty. Their veggie burger felt as if it was missing just a tiny something... an oomph, but was really enjoyable and super filling. The BBQ sauce served with the fries was fantastic, too. I'll definitely be back here for lunch, only this time with a reservation. I didn't mind sitting at the bar though- so many cool things to look at!Other than the loud obnoxious jerk sitting behind me, eating at Farmhouse was a great experience that I'll definitely repeat."
"Tried this on A Sat nightThe cheese curds were pretty goodgin cocktails were hit or missThe burger was meh.The flatbread was sent back by our party- it had pumpkin puree and no cheese on it!Arugula salad with walnuts- waaaaay too salty.Overall, not too impressed."
"Bottom line: good but too expensive (3 beers, 2 apps, 1 salad, 1 entree for $90, and I left a bit hungry) for a return visit. there is not enough vegetarian food.solid beer list, but could use some written descriptions so we don't have to ask what they are.Staff friendly, but not well trained. He couldn't tell us about the beer we asked about, and the coursing failed when our fish/salad landed when we were 1/4 through the apps. So much for a leisurely meal.. at least it was pretty tasty."
Ambiance was great. One of the best meals I've had in Chicago. Get the steak! All local produce.
"We didn't make a reservation but they were able to seat us immediately at the bar which was perfect because we got amazing service there.  Loved the beers since I'm a Midwest native.  We ordered the cheese curds to start, which I thought could have used a little more flavor.  My entree was the short ribs and I cannot say one bad thing about that dish.  It was cooked perfectly and the flavor was spot on.  It is quite loud but became better around 8:30 p.m.  It's also a little on the pricey side so just come prepared."
"Wonderful. A totally perfect brunch. Really cozy place. I love gazing at the bar with all locally sourced booze and the world's nicest bartender letting people sample some of the awesome beers they have. They have a beer list that puts a lot of places to shame. Great whitefish sandwich and perfect breakfast potatoes with onions. The fries and short rib sandwich are great. On one visit the burger I had was a little over cooked - not medium rare at all as I'd requested but the World's Best Bloody Mary I had allowed me to overlook that. This bloody Mary beats ALL others. Great spice and dill and loaded up with olives, jerky and even a cheese curd. I want everything on the menu and plan to continue making my way through it this year. Really friendly service. It's places like this that make me love living in Chicago. Oh, and the fried cheese curds. Wow."
"We had reserved a table for 7:15 but part of the group at that table decided to stay for an extra half hour.  The hostess was very nice about it, but usually management would offer to buy the remaining members of the party a drink at the bar.  Overall the food was good, the service was good, but the noise level off the charts.  It is like lots of other restaurants springing up.  I ordered a hamburger and instead of medium rare came well done with a crust on it.  Why ask if the only temperature was well done?  Price point was reasonalbe on the entrees but it added up to about $70 per person between drinks at the bar and dinner.  I won't rush back, but might try it on a quiet night."
The chicken. Get the chicken!
"Cool spot with a great ambiance!The craft beer list is unbelievable.  My buddies and I stopped in for burgers and were surprised to find Three Floyds Zombie Dust available.  I think we drank every last Zombie Dust they had!  The burger is delicious and a must try.  Also, be sure to grab a bunch of the appetizers as well.Stop in to Farmhouse for a great dining experience!"
"My bf had previously been here and enjoyed the food.  We came on a Monday night at 6:30.  There was 1 party at a table, the rest were empty and the bar was almost full.  We told the hostess party of 2 and she really tried to push the bar seating on us.  I asked if we could get a table bc I don't like being squished with a bunch of other people when there are many tables open and I'd rather sit across from my bf and talk than have to sit right next to each other.  I asked the hostess for a table instead and she snottily said all the tables had reservations on them, but there were a few open bar seats.  We then left because it seemed so ridiculous.  I pulled out open table on my phone and could have made a reservation for 2 at 6:45 pm.  And every 15 minutes after that.  AKA, those tables were not being held for reservations.  We considered making a reservation for 6:45 and going back in but decided the hostess would probably make up another excuse.  I never got to try the food and have zero interest in returning. I have no idea why you would turn away people coming to eat in your almost empty restaurant."
"Visited the Farmhouse for a Saturday date night. We loved the place instantly on walking in. The decor and vibe was rustic but not twee. Just casual and inviting.We were a bit early for our reservation so we found a spot at the bar upstairs and sampled a few of the tasty beverages on offer. The maple margarita was absolutely delicious. The bartender was fantastic, funny and helpful, recommending a couple of local craft beers and they definitely hit the spot.Our table wasn't ready on time but the owner apparently let us have a round on the house, which was appreciated.Finally we sat down to eat. After reading everyone raving about the cheese curds I had to try them. To be honest I couldn't see what all the fuss is about. They're basically fairly bland gooey cheese balls deep fried in batter. Nice enough, but nothing to rave about.Mains arrived; I had a pork chop dish with veggies which was quite nice but the meat was overdone and a bit tasteless. My partner had the chicken dish, and we followed it with a shared white chocolate trifle.Although the service and atmosphere and other factors are really important, ultimately you go to a restaurant for the quality of the food. You want each dish to be special and to treasure it later. And unfortunately I didn't find Farmhouse quite lived up to that expectation.The food was nice enough but really just a bit bland. Good ingredients and well prepared, but lacking any strong flavour. This is particularly noticeable when served with a strong craft beer.In summary: great place but disappointing food."
"Another great night sampling a new spot! Thanks to all who were able to join. Scale= I would rather go to 7       Eh      Good Enough       I'd come back        This is GREATOn atmosphere - 4 ""I'd come back"" and 2 felt ""This is Great!""

Love the whole local flare.I felt very comfortable. Very diner friendly, single digit wines-love it!Great, friendly service.Fun for sharing-would come back. Better winter spot."
"The food was a 2.5, but it doesn't make up for the waitstaff who are the most poorly trained in town.  Management should be fired"
"Decided to eat dinner here on a whim - there was just something about the vibe of the menu and website that pulled me in. I made a reservation about 30 minutes ahead of time and was happy I did - we were a party of two around 6:30 on a Thursday and the downstairs was pretty full even that early. Everyone around us was only drinking, not eating, so I was getting the vibe that this place was more bar-driven. They have a great beer list and the waitress gave me some great suggestions when the beer I ordered was out. Pleasantly surprised with the food! We ordered the fries to start, then I got the oven roasted chicken and my boyfriend got the trout. Both were really tasty, but the chicken was the winner of the night. It had a crispy crust but still juicy inside, and the blue cheese mashed potatoes and corn vinaigrette were perfect compliments to each other - SO tasty. Loved it.There was a small problem with our order when the food runner brought out the trout before it was plated with the sides and sauce. The server noticed us examining the plate hunting for the potatoes under the filet, and she immediately apologized and swept the plate back to the kitchen. Then on top of that, the owner came over to apologize which was not necessary but I obviously appreciated. After that the fish took a while to come out because they insisted on cooking a new filet. We are fairly easy customers and didn't mind the mix up or the extra wait (we were enjoying our beers and sharing the chicken plate). However, they handled a could-be terrible situation so well - and actually made the meal more comfortable and memorable. On top of it all, they brought us a free dessert!Overall, loved it and will definitely go back for dinner or just drinks. Love the service and the decor - curious to see what the upstairs is all about..."
Great beer choices but limited dinner menu.
"What a disaster. I ordered the cheese plate to start which said it was served with olives and other accoutrements on the menu. What arrived were two types of cheese with crackers - one was a bacon cheese and the other was blue cheese on a bed of ... bacon jam. You'd think the waiter would have let us know that the cheese plate was not the same as listed on the menu - and not vegetarian (as we are). He didn't even remove this from our bill (!) and said that there were no other cheeses in the restaurant to substitute. What's more, he was completely unapologetic. I then proactively inquired about the ingredients in the salad with ""chopped seasonal vegetables"". He replied with ""lettuce and sliced carrots"". Seriously? How about reprinting your menu if you have zero veggies for your ""chopped vegetable salad""? At one point during our meal, we hadn't seen our waiter in over 25 minutes (and it was pretty dead at 6:00 on a Monday), so we had to go to the bar from our table in order to order drinks which took another 15 minutes to make it to our table. I like the ""locally sourced"" mission of this place, but the food is uninspiring and service is terrible."
"Cool atmosphere and what a great concept-- farm to table and locally sourced ingredients in everything here.  Even the extensive beer and wine selection was local (all from Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Indiana).  We went for a weeknight dinner and brought my dad-- a real beer snob.  He was pleasantly overwhelmed by the beer menu and all of the great IPAs they had to choose from.  The food was also impressive.  The portion sizes were just right and everyone's meals were delicious.  Would especially recommend the short ribs and the beet salad!  And don't forget dessert-- we sampled three between the four of us and the bread pudding was far and away the favorite of the table.The only downside here was the service.  Our waiter was great, but I think he was handling the entire downstairs area so things were a little slow as he was being pulled in a number of directions."
"Farmhouse is a new bar/restaurant in the old Bar Louie spot on Chicago avenue near the brown line stop of the same name. It has a pretty nondescript facade, so keep your eyes peeled for the sheep on the windows or you'll miss it. The ambiance here is pretty casual with a slight hipster vibe. Lots of warm wooden everythings, with TVs at the bar with the volume off, and music by Springsteen and Rod Stewart before he got crappy, set the mood off right for some working class boozing. I really liked the drink selection here. Two Brother Atom Smasher on tap? Sign me up. They had a bunch of beer cocktails that mix beer with rum and all kinds of liquors I've never even heard of. I was thoroughly impressed with the extensive beer and cocktail menu.Unfortunately as extensive as the drink menu is, the dinner menu is the opposite. Very few choices (I think just burgers, chicken, and short ribs). Portions are also on the small side. Most of our group got burgers which while looking to be kind of on the small side for $12-14 burgers, were pretty decent. Two of the four burgers we ordered didn't come with the correct toppings but I'm going to chalk that up to new restaurant jitters as they did a fine job of correcting their mistake. At the end of the day, I'd rather have a manageable burger than some huge burger that falls apart while I eat it, but if the burger is going to be $14 or so once I start adding toppings, it should wow me. This burger didn't.For now, I'm filing under needs improvement. The bar was great, and I wouldn't hesitate to meet friends here for some happy hour or post-happy hour drinking. The service was also very friendly. It's as a restaurant that Farmhouse just doesn't quite bring it. If you're going to have a limited menu, make sure it's awesome, not just ok. Right now just come here for drinks and eat somewhere else."
This might be our favorite restaurant.  The menu is authentic with creative specials.  The food comes from local farms and is prepared to perfection.  The prices are highly reasonable.
"This place gets points with us for locally-sourcing their food, even in an Illinois winter.  The steak and short ribs were fantastic.  We also brought our kids, despite the yelp warnings, and they had a great meal.   It's a good place for your kids if they are well-behaved...Butterscotch pudding for dessert was fantastic!  Only thing that dropped it down a star was that the bartender would not make Shirley Temples, and directed our kids to their house-made sodas instead.  Not the best-tasting.  But everything else was amazing."
"You may remember this place when it use to be Toast. Sorry to see Toast go but happy it now houses Farmhouse. I give them kudos for embracing local ingredients, beers, and alcohol from the sistering states and for doing it well. My recommendations for starter would be the mussels and a side of the fries or curds. You also have to just get the cheese ball just for nostalgia because who knows when the next holiday party is when you'll get to have one. For dinner, the burger or the boneless short ribs are the way to go. Chicken was also good.I was also surprised to see my friend working the bar. If you happen to go you will easily spot him. He looks as if he lives in the wilderness amongst the wolves and just comes down to the city just to sell furs and tend bar at the Farmhouse. In all seriousness, he is a great guy so treat him well and I'm sure he will return the favor."
"If I could sum up my experience at Farmhouse in one word, it would be, simply, ""Meh."" The beer list is easily the best thing this place has going for it - I had an old Chicago standby (Half Acre's Gossamer) and an excellent brew out of Maryland (Stillwater Autumnal Saison), both of which hit the spot. Our meal started auspiciously - the mussels were excellent, and served with an appropriate amount of bread and an unexpectedly spicy sauce. The rest of the offerings were hit or miss - I had the pulled pork pastie, which had a pleasantly crispy crust, but had a disappointingly bland filling. Likewise with the short rib entree, which was woefully underseasoned and looked like it came from an army chow line. The burger was the one standout among the entrees - perfectly cooked flavorful grass-fed beef, topped with an oozing fried egg. I should also mention that the service had a SNAFU - we had to wait around 25 minutes before being seen by a server, and practically had to jump on the table and wave our hands to finally get the job done (the restaurant not being crowded, mind you). However, once we flagged down the server, she was rather pleasant. Pricing was reasonable for this kind of meal (Entree, half an appetizer, and two beers for $40 after t&t is pretty standard for a gastropub these days).All in all, this meal was solidly pedestrian. I would not raise arms against the idea of coming back, but with so many awesome gastropubs in Chicago (and with one of these (Gilt Bar) in FH's backyard) I can't envision myself being inspired to return of my own volition."
"I love the energy, the drinks, and the food. Great place to have good food and drinks with friends."
"This place was a great alternative to nearby Yolk, when we were looking for breakfast and didn't want to wait an hour. The food was good, and the service was excellent. Oh and they have this spaceship looking lazy Susan that holds 500 beers!"
"This is a cute, cozy spot to get some great burgers. I came here with some coworkers at lunchtime, and was definitely impressed. The food is sourced locally (states bordering the Great Lakes) and you can taste the difference. Even the lemonade was made from local lemons. Amazinggg.  The potato leak soup is also delish. The only drawback was that our service was a bit slow.Atlhough the menu isn't terribly extensive, it's still worth the treck. Just make sure you make a reservation because this place is small."
"Great ambience but the main courses and waitstaff left something to be desired. We started downstairs where we had drinks and a delicious flatbread with goat cheese and mushrooms. Then we went upstairs and ordered short ribs and the Amish chicken- maybe I've been spoiled by living in Northern CA too long where the farm to table movement has it down to a science, but given the hype, I was expecting much more.  Dishes were pretty average. Waitstaff was super slow (not entirely his fault - they only had one guy working all of the upstairs on a Saturday night!)  We finished with the goat cheesecake, which was extremely thick and trying too hard to be the atypical cheesecake.  Was disappointed as I was really looking forward to this place, but still like the farm to table aspect."
"This place is incredible! I was excited to go knowing the idea behind the restaurant of fresh, local food and resources being used to create delish cuisine.  I was surprised to find out that they make their own moonshine and have every Gin known to man.  My fiance and I met up with his old roomie on a busy night so we decided to sit at the bar.  I got the Wisconsin Cheese Curds since I was pretty hungry (followed the advice of fellow Yelpers :)) and while we waited for that we got some yummy drinks.  I started out with the ""Hearthwarmer"" which was definitely warm going down (temperature and the mellow burn of the ETOH) and tasted like Christmas.  It was Whiskey with a cinnamon stick in it with some other clever ingredients that I can't remember.  I also tried the Strawberry Moonshine at the suggestion of one of the barkeeps when I asked which one was his fave.  It was waaaaay better than I thought it would be! I was afraid that Strawberry meant it would taste like cough syrup or artificial but it tasted like homemade Strawberry jam without the overly sweet finish.  The burn from the Moonshine was almost undetectable and I was pleasantly surprise all around by it.  It was definitely busy and crowded but it was an expected busy night so I didn't take anything away from my rating for that.  The staff was pleasant, pretty good mix of people, and it was an adventure to sit at the bar and marvel at all the distinct and delicious booze they had on hand.Oh yeah, and the cheese curds were great! I wouldn't say they were my favorite but I think that's because I'm such a fan of the raw squeaky version of them :).I would definitely give this place a shot and if you aren't in the mood for a full meal, the bar is a great alternative!"
"Eh. It wasn't bad, but I'm in no hurry to come back. I had the fish sandwich and my fiance had the grass fed beef burger. I thought my sandwich was okay, it wasn't amazing, just an average fish sandwich.  My fiance hated his burger, he couldn't even finish it. I have never seen him not finish a burger before. The salad i had as an appetizer was bland and boring. It was literally lettuce and a few drops of dressing already mixed in. The redeeming qualities of this restaurant are the cheese curds. Without the cheese curds, I would've given Farmhouse 2 stars. The toffee bread pudding was good. I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding, but I do love toffee. I haven't met a baked good that I haven't liked so I hesitate to give it any credit for that."
The cheese curd was yummy! The stew was ok. Very cute atmosphere with a pitch fork as a door handle
"I went to Farmhouse for dinner last night, and had mixed feelings. First, let me say that their cocktail menu is refreshingly creative, and really distinguishes Farmhouse from gastropubs like Hopleaf that focus almost entirely on beer. Let me also say that this the local-food vibe here is real and deep: just about everything, even the gin, is locally or regionally sourced. Heck, even the decor is all salvaged from local buildings. I went in wanting to love this place. The cocktail I had--an enticing combination of Farmer's gin, lime juice, and frozen fruit--was awesome. The cheese curds were delicious.  But then...the salad was good but so very small for $10. The veggie burger was dry, and the toppings showed no thought at all. My boyfriend had the meat burger, and found it good but unexceptionable. Hasn't Kuma's taught us that the choose-your-own-topping is lazy and unimaginative?  I LOVE fries, but these were bland, insufficiently seasoned. For dessert, we shared the waffle cone sundae, which was decadent but uninspired.There were other issues. The menu is not enormous--maybe 6 or 8 main courses. When we arrived, they were out of 2; when we left, 3. The couple next to us left after a drink because so much of the menu was blacked out. Yes, it was a Sunday, and yes, they source their food locally, but again this says lack of creativity to me. If you don't have enough steaks, or burgers, or what have you, then come up with something  that uses the ingredients you do have.  To top it off, the hostess seated us directly under a very energetic air conditioning vent. We asked to move, and proceeded to watch two other parties be seated there and ask to move. One poor sap finally endured that seat--but he looked like he was on a date and didn't want to look like a prima donna. What I didn't understand was that the staff just kept seating people there, as though no matter how many people asked to be moved, they just didn't get that there's a problem. Seriously--just rearrange a bit, and make everybody happy.I won't go out of my way to return."
"I've been to Farmhouse twice and both times I suffered through HORRIBLE bartender service. It's the guy with the grey hair in a bun and the ZZ Top beard.  Wow. Did someone chain him to the other end of the bar? I practically had to BEG for a new drink after my first beer glass sat there empty.  This guy sucks.  If I ran this place he'd be out on his ass.  Oh his prison tatts and long hair are sooo cool, maybe that's why they keep him?"
"Had a HORRIBLE experience here.  Had a 7:30 pm reservation for 3 people on a Saturday.  We were there on time and the restaurant was pretty empty still.  The hostess took us upstairs...past LOTS of empty tables and sat us at a table for 2 in the corner and said she would get us another chair.  I was like WTF??   I questioned them about this and they moved us to a slightly bigger but still awkward table for 3.  I have never experienced this type of treatment...a) we had a confirmed reservation b) the restaurant was pretty empty and c) even if they did f* up their reservation timing they didn't even offer us a free bottle of wine or appetizer to compensate us for the inconvenience. Needless to say we left and went elsewhere.  I did ask to speak to the manager and he was not available, and he did later attempt to contact me to deal with the situation.  I chose not to call him back though.  There are plenty of awesome restaurants in the city and I don't need to waste my time on one with dumb hostesses who don't know how to treat customers!"
"My husband and I went a couple weeks ago; early on a Friday night around 6:30 or so.  Lots of families and a very nice atmosphere/vibe.  Food was very good and service was a little slow at times, but nothing to write about since we were enjoying the opportunity to sit and talk, etc.  I'm pregnant and asked about non-alcoholic suggestions, and tried a house-made soda.  Very nice that they have options.  Portion sizes are what we loved best - not too large so you don't walk out feeling like Violet from Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.  Would go again!"
Had lunch there recently. GREAT staff!GREAT food!GREAT owner!GREAT atmoshere!Love this place.Nuff said.
"Went for Sunday brunch and was very happy with this restaurant. As many people have already mentioned, the decor in this restaurant is pretty cool. It's a trendy restaurant with a cozy feel to it. Not a super packed brunch place which was great since we didn't have to wait 45 min in the cold. We had the cheese curds to start, best cure for a hangover and I had the eggs benedict as my main course. Food was delicious, specially the potatoes that came as a side. Service was great, refilled coffee often and very attentive. The one thing that I truly disliked is that the server offered to get us more OJ, but she made it seem like it was complimentary so we all said yes (otherwise we would have politely declined since we all know that OJ at restaurants is a high commodity).... Check came and surprise you've all been charged for 2 OJ's at 4 bucks a piece. Not cool, in my opinion she should have warned us...Overall great though and would definitely go back for dinner."
"I almost feel bad for downing this place after all the great reviews, so I'll keep this brief.  What I liked - the service.  Waitress was great.  Very nice lady.  What I didn't like - everything else.  Beer menu - yes is local - but not very good.  The cheese kurds were WhiteCastle-ish.  Food - I literally could have pulled everything my wife and I ordered out of of a microwave box and got the same result.  The duck was near flavorless and made my wife sick.  The chicken pot pie I ordered, was literally a very bland hot pocket.  Seriously, it was a hot pocket with a brick hard bottom. The ambiance, is just a bar room.  Nothing bad, nothing great.  For the people who work here or own the joint, I mean no harm in the review.  I just won't be going back here ever, unless I'm looking for a late night drink.  Absolutely horrendous food."
"Short ribs are fantastic! Skip the beet salad, it's nice but everyone's doing it, and it's really a stand out. Great beer selection, super friendly service, and comfy atmosphere. I'll definitely be back and will try dessert on my next visit!"
"Mind you, this was my first visit, & my meal choice was simple, but I was delighted by the atmosphere, and the cozy place that is FARMHOUSE.  I had the chicken soup with dumplings, and mashed potatoes. The soup was hot, and fresh, and yummy. The potatoes, different-- not typical, and good! We'll try again, and get a proper meal...and sample some beer. The servers were all knowledgeable, and sharing info on brewing and beer. They were all engaging, and seemed to be enjoying working there. I'll go again."
"I came here for a late dinner with a girlfriend before a night out and we had a great time. Sure, a bus runs right by the patio, but hey, that's urban al fresco, right? There were some issues with coordinating beer and food arrival times, but we had a great server and really enjoyed what we were sent, so I'm still a fan. My friend had a salad, which she thoroughly enjoyed. I had the grilled river trout, which truth be told was a little bit salty, but that's what we had an amazing beer pairing for! FYI: Farmhouse has an awesome and voluminous beer list, great cocktails, and though there were some kinks, the our server really went out of his way to make up for the snags. No four stars because we never received out whoopie pies (which we were SO excited to try) But I am hopeful that there will be some redemption soon."
"Went for lunch.  Friend and I ordered the Riesling, cheese curds, chicken sandwich, and patty melt. Total was about $47.Server was Lance - very upbeat and friendly guy.  Talked about the local ingredients and gave us a run-down on what was good on the menu.Friend and I disagreed about the cheese curds.  I loved them because the breading was light and airy.  He prefers the denser style, and thought they were a bit too ""adult"" for him.Patty melt was pretty standard.  My chicken sandwich was good.  Fries were okay but needed a more substantial salting.  Would have been good to have a shaker on the table to season them up a bit.I'd go again if I were meeting a friend in the area, but not sure I'd make it my first choice of a destination."
"The food was solid and the cocktail one of the best I've had in Chicago.  Portions were a good amount (they don't skimp) and the atmosphere was really welcoming.  I would recommend the braised pork shoulder, fries, and chicken soup!"
"Briefly, here are the pros and cons:Pros: Truly fantastic food and gin cocktails. The trout was to die for.Cons: Very disappointed in how we were treated. I made a reservation for 5. When I arrived, I was basically told that the only table was this dark corner of the upstairs room next to the bathrooms. I was very unhappy with this, but it would have been a considerable wait for another table and there were 2 hungry teenagers involved. Things got worse from there. A group of about 16 men sat at the table in front of us and were literally yelling at the top of their lungs. There we were trapped in this corner with all this shouting reverberating around us. Flat out weird behavior for a restaurant. After about 40 minutes of this, we asked the waiter to talk with the group. He wouldn't, presumably because he thought he'd get a better tip from them. The manager also refused to help. I finally made headway with my Marilyn voice and a bit of flirting, but that shouldn't have been necessary. Upshot: I'll eat here again because the food is great, but I'll ask a lot more questions about seating arrangements next time.What you should know: Ask for a downstairs booth. With that, all will probably be well."
"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday in November. We were visiting Chicago for 4 days and this establishment was our favorite.Farmhouse received 5 stars from me for the following:Electric atmosphere, though not too loud or busy.Great service with great recommendations from server.Great menu. I figure if you have good food, you don't need a menu 10 pages long.Food was awesome. Like everyone says, the cheese curds are ridiculous!We ended up shutting down the bar with the employees and the owner (think his name was TJ). All of which were very friendly and welcoming.They need to open one up in the Bay Area!"
"Came here for lunch for the first time.  Great experience!  I inadvertently reviewed this place for my Marketplace visit, so I wanted to make it to Farmhouse to make up for my poor review of the former.Food: Per my server's recommendation, I got the chicken sandwich. It was delicious.  The mushrooms, cheese, chicken, and sauce went very well together.  It had just the right amount of salt. Service: Very casual and friendly. The server said, ""What's up"" when greeting me. I wasn't taken aback. I think it's appropriate for the type of restaurant. He recommended the chicken sandwich, saying it was the most popular. Atmosphere: Really cool. I love the Mismatching furniture, warm tones, and appropriate lighting. Fits well with the entire theme.Pricing: Fair for what you're getting.Overall: I will be back for brunch or lunch!"
"I want to like this place. I really, really do. So much so that I went back 2 weeks after my first experience (which was not great). If this were a bar and not a restaurant I would give it a much higher ranking but the fact that they are trying to be a standout food establishment means they've got to really step their game up. This is Chicago, not a second tier Midwestern city. The food is decent by Chicago gastro-pub standards but certainly not outstanding. Cheese curds were the standout of the meal. Chicken dumpling soup was heavily under seasoned. The fish burger was lacking a standout spice or bite. It was all creamy and mushy with no balance of taste or texture. Both times I've been they've been out of items on the menu. I understand how this plays into the locally sourced theme but one visit was for lunch at 2pm in the afternoon. ???The wait staff has been very upbeat and friendly but the speed of the kitchen is amazingly slow. On my most recent visit the waitress went out of her way to tell us about everything in the restaurant including the history of the repurposed table we were eating at. However, when our meal (burgers) was being delivered to our table about 45 minutes after ordering she was short for words. The beer list is very good. They have a great selection and they have firkins of local beers that will blow you away. If they paid a little more attention the actual taste of the food and the operational side of the restaurant they could really have a gem here."
"Wow. I just got dinner here with my boyfriend and parents and this place really knocked it out of the park. Great service, great food, lovely ambiance... There was nothing off about our evening. We got the steak, short ribs, and braised pork shoulder and I feel like that pork was one of the best things I have ever eaten. On top of that they have a local food philosophy which is a bonus. I recommend asking to sit on the top floor if you want to have some quiet for good conversation."
"Had high hopes but was underwhelmed. The chicken soup and tomato barley soup were both very good. They have a decent local craft beer selection, and the house wine wasn't bad. However the entrees missed the mark big time. We had the chicken, filet, and pasta special. Not a horrible spot, but not a top 5 neighborhood choice. Weight staff is very friendly, and super knowledgeable on their food and liquor."
"I only go on yelp if I really love a place or have a terrible experience.  I literally just got back from a work lunch at Farmhouse and the first thing I felt compelled to do was go on Yelp and write a review while it was still fresh in my brain.  My co-workers and I were out celebrating the end of our audit and wanted to get out of the office for a nice reward.  We arrived on time for our reservation and were sat right next to the door.  Mind you, the restaurant was empty at this point before the lunch rush came in.  I had to wear my coat the whole time while seated because every time the door opened I got a draft of the 13 degree air.  Let's start with the service. It was mind-blowingly ridiculously slow.  I'm still trying to comprehend what in the world the problem was.  Our first round of drinks came after ten minutes of waiting.  There is only ONE bartender which I think somewhat contributed to the problem.  Then, when all of us were finished with our first round and ready for another our server was MIA for about ten more minutes.  Seriously, no exaggeration.  When she came over to deliver our food we had to ask for another round because clearly she didn't see that all of our drinks were empty.  The round came......AFTER we all had finished our entire meals.  Total we each had two drinks.  I'm not saying we are a bunch of lushes but our typical lunch outing consists of us each having at least four (if not more).  Let's just say our drink bill always outweighs our food.The food was meh.  The chopped salad was not by any means chopped.  The pork sandwich came with 4 sprinkles of blue cheese which was not worth the dollar that was charged.  The Burger was ordered medium rare and came out medium well.  The chicken sandwich was just ordinary.  I mean nothing stood out as fabulous.  We go out to work lunches often and this was the second time we have been to Farmhouse.  This will now be crossed off of our list and we will not be back."
"We had an enjoyable experience at Farmhouse on a Saturday night...just wasn't completely blown away by the food. The beer list is, as everyone has mentioned, outstanding and our waitress was helpful with helping us pick a beverage to compliment the meal.Shared the cheese curds which were very tasty, indeed (deep fried cheese, what's not to love?!). For entrees, I had the pork chop which was just...fine. I felt the meat was a little overpowered by the sauce it came doused in. My dinner guest had the short ribs which were reported to be quite tasty. The decor is cute and cozy and the service is friendly. What I also appreciate is that they don't pressure you to immediately leave your table after your meal is over. All in all, an A-OK (3 star) time. I would go back again but perhaps for lunch."
"A wide selection of specialty gormet burgers and sides.  Nice ambiance and great food!   Service was a bit slow, though."
"I've been meaning to get over here since it opened, well now that I've been there i can't stop raving about it to anyone who will listen. The beer list is nothing short of spectacular! if you like ""Three Floyd's"" and I DO you will be in draft heaven, there are literally so many great beers on tap I'm afraid there's not enough time in the day to get to them all. My fiance and I went in with every intention of having a few beers then getting dinner, however we just got some appetizers (cheese curds and 2 orders of house chips) and several rounds of delish brew. if you go be sure to call WAAY ahead to get a reservation or plan on sitting at the bar, also they've got some awesome hot sauces from CO-OP behind the bar.. just speak up."
"I really liked Farmhouse the first time we visited. Unfortunately, the menu is kind of small and it just got boring the next couple of times. Not only is the menu small, but a lot of the dishes start off promising and then contain a ""twist"" within the recipe that renders them unattractive. On the upside, the staff are all really friendly and the atmosphere is cool. Large beer list of local and imports too! I would recommend this place once a year."
"Really cool spot with very unique menu options. Lots to offer here, most of which are very tasty. Huge craft beer selection, also house-made sodas (a little intense for me but the table generally liked them). Fries are killer, cheese curds highly regarded on Yelp--liked em, didn't love em.  Delicious short rib sandwich, pork belly sandwich way too salty.  Overall a must try for those craving American food with lots of neat options."
"Went there on Friday night for dinner.  I'm guessing it's the last time we'll be able to get in on a Friday night without making reservations a week ahead of time, so we're lucky :)First off, the space is awesome, great decor, very cool.  Clearly a lot of work went into it.The drinks were amazing.  We only tried one with alcohol, but it was awesome.  Incredibly interesting, we just took turns passing it around. We also had a cream soda that had the perfect amount of sweetness and carbonation.The food is where they lose a star.  As the hostess told us, they are a bar that serves food.  I think they need to rethink their focus, the place is setup like a restaurant, it acts like one, and it should be one.  Now, we were there on their first busy night, so I understand there were problems and hickups in the kitchen.  I'm fine with that.  My brother had the trout and said it was great.  we had delicious salads and the addictive and yummy cheese curds to start.  My wife and i had veggie burgers.  She loved hers, mine was raw.  But more than that, it was missing something.  The bun was too big for the veggie burger.  I added cheese, but you couldn't taste it.  I think they need to add some more veggies to help with the burger.  Some large tomatoes or avocado would fit perfectly in adding something with moisture.  My brother's girlfriend had the chicken and said it was just average.The service was good, not great.  No complaints, I just saw a lot of the waiters and waitresses chatting with each other.  The owner came over and introduced himself and apologized for a minor mistake with one of the meals (and offered to buy us a round as apology!).We will be back.  I think this place has some serious potential."
"I guess they take their name to hear be cause this place is about as bright as a farmhouse. The lighting was far too dim, I struggled to read my menu by a small candle. My app was the roasted beet and baby rocket salad. If by roasted beet they mean just cutting a beat and plating it, then yea, I had roasted beets. The salad was far too large for a salad portion, let alone an app. The honey mustard vinaigrette was good, but because the salad was large, was too much handle. It said it came with goat cheese, but I had only, no kidding, 3 small curds.The grilled river trout entree was a meaty fish, but bland. My waiter said it would come with crispy skin, but I'm pretty sure it was like a damp paper towel. Some of my roasted garlic fingerling potatoes were under cooked and didn't taste like garlic. The dessert was a butterscotch pudding with vanilla cookies. The cookies mashed in the pudding added a nice texture. The description said it came with crumbled dried cherry, but there were so few cherries that when I did eat one with the pudding, I resented it. Overpriced for it quality and overall experience."
"Well, well, well. This place was definitely a pleasant surprise. We were looking for a place to eat during the holiday season. All the small, good restaurants I wanted to go to were closed, so I yelped and found this spot. Lucky me!The cheese curds were delicious! I had no idea what they would be, but they're basically similar to mozzarella sticks. Crunchy on the outside, chewy and soft on the inside. For the main course I had the beef and roasted root vegetable pastie. WOW. I was extremely impressed. I wasn't really expecting much, but it was very flavorful. I thought the cheese sauce was a bit too much though.. I would ask for it on the side if they'd be willing. My date got the Farmhouse classic burger, (with bacon and cheese) which was also good. It's pretty simple but we all know how wrong you can go with a burger. The service was okay. We were seated in a small nook area in front of the bar, and things seemed a little crowded. Our server walked by a couple times and ignored us ): It was busy though, so I guess I understand.I would definitely stop by again. Seems like a fun place."
"I really don't want to write some bitchy review about the server or the hostess because that wont really help a future patron. The place is very nicely finished and has perfect lighting. The sever and staff were friendly enough too. That is about all the nice things I can say. The menu looked really good, but the food was ALL off. We had the beat salad which was way to tangy. For a main course we had the white fish and the egg noodle and pulled chicken.   White fish - for a farm to table place the fish tasted old and the risotto which sounded great was super bland Egg Noodles - very undercooked and seasoned with beer lager. Again sounded ok on the menu, but in reality it was terrible. Very bitter and when mixed with the sundries tomatoes it just was a bad combo. Lastly the wine selection was kind of weakI should have sent the food back, but at the time it seemed like a lot of effort. Will not be going back and would not recommend this place either. The only reason I gave it 2* is the room and ambiance was very nice"
"I am not from Chicago. But I wish I were sometimes. And if I were, I would probably go broke eating at Farmhouse. Perhaps it's that we live on the East Coast, not exactly land of the delicious beef and pork. Perhaps it's that we were hungry and really, really excited to be on vacation. Or perhaps Farmhouse's filet and pork tenderloin really were that good. Honestly, I'm going with the final option. They were delicious. The filet was tender and perfectly medium rare, and the fries it came with shoe-stringy without being that McDonald's style boring and crispy. The pork tenderloin's name speaks for it- it was tender and juicy and just as pork should be in the current age of medium rare, plump pork. This was not your mom's pork tenderloin from 1989 (bless my mother, who is a splendid cook. But that method of cooking pork to well done actually convinced me I hated it for years and years.) This convinced me otherwise. With its perfect bed of spaetzle style dumplings and greens, it was the best meal I've had in months. Beyond that, I give Farmhouse serving size credit: when one orders a meaty entree in the Midwest, a girl can get a little nervous. (I know, I'm from there.) But no nervousness was necessary. These were edible, perfect portions of meat and side.Beyond the entrees, we also had dessert, a carrot cake bread pudding that was scrumptious. I've honestly never had carrot cake anything without a ton of cream cheese frosting, and it was perfect. To add more sauce than what was dolloped on the plate would have ruined the moist, spicy flavor of the cake itself. And you know something is good when my partner in crime devours it, and it's sweet. He of no sweet tooth whatsoever only gives that honor to some things. And this earned it.The beer list was great, and our server was kind enough to offer assistance. We both tried new things, and I began my weekend-long Goose Island special bottles tour (even if they are owned by Anheiser Busch). The only thing that went wrong in our Farmhouse experience was probably a saving grace. We tried to give in and order the fried cheese curds as an appetizer, as the partner in crime had never had this Midwestern delicacy. They never arrived. We weren't charged for them, and I don't know what happened. We never heard another word about them after our order. But as much as I love fried cheese, not having them probably meant we got to have dessert, and I don't love any fried cheese anywhere near as much I loved that dessert.Farmhouse is busy, and it's loud. It's maybe not the spot to just hit on a random night without reservations, and it might not be the place for the most romantic dinner of all time. We were seated upstairs, and in the corner, and it was actually pretty perfect for the romance and whatnot. But in any other position, I would imagine that would be a little challenging. However, with beer and food like that, romance is bound to blossom no matter if you can hear each other or not.The pride on local was great, although I'm not sure I needed to have that fact announced to me by the server. I guess I feel that farm-to-table concepts and locally sourced foods are no longer so special as to require a line from the server. But whatever. It obviously wasn't enough to take away from the absolutely awesome, local pig and cow we ate. Thanks to them, and thanks to the Farmhouse chefs."
"If they have the pasties on the menu, make sure to give it a go. Awesome!  The beer selection is good and the Midwest sourcing of most of their food & drinks is a nice touch."
"Came here for the 1st time. Cool vibe and nice atmosphere. Service was awesomeLike the philosophy of the restaurant. They had a great cocktail menu. Nice gin selection along w/ beer and wines. They even have wine on draught. Braised short ribs were money! No knife needed. Wife got amish chicken and that was spectacular. Only thing I didn't care for was french toast bread pudding, but that was only b/c I don't really care for bacon in my desserts. Definitely worth a try."
"good food, warm and genuine service...a bit loud."
"Waited 1hr and 20 minutes to get food to the table, amazing!  When it finally came it was good, but it did not leave an experience that I am willing to repeat."
"Love love the roasted chicken from Farmhouse!  Want to love this place but it was so loud I thought I would lose my mind!    And we went on a Tuesday night cannot think what it must be like on the weekend.  I don't mind some noise but this was incredible.Wait staff on top of there game, the poor bartender was in the Weeds until the manager finally  showed himself  to pour wine for the BT.The food is great I will be back for more Chicken and burgers but I will have to go at 5 or when they open to have a calm dinner."
"Excellent beers on tap and a VERY knowledgeable staff. Even though we were just sitting on stools having a drink, a waiter adopted us and made sure we were always taken care of. The bartender also knew her beer and talked with us for a while.My only complaint is that the bar juts out and makes it a very narrow passageway from one end of the bar to the other. Not a huge criticism so make sure you go here!"
"Aaaaamazing. Great food, great service, all fresh and locally sourced. Why oh why did I wait so long to go!!"
I loved everything about our experience at Farmhouse.  Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable.  The food was AMAZING. I still think about the short ribs...  They have a great cocktail menu and I love that most (all?) of the products are from local farms or distributers.  The atmosphere was lively but it still had an intimate feel.  It was great for a grown-up date night with friends.
I really liked Farmhouse. The atmosphere is great although can be noisy. The staff was nice and knowledgeable. I would recommend making a reservation so you don't have to wait. The food was good (not AMAZING but really good). My step mom was in town a couple weeks ago and I sent her with a friend. They loved it. I'm looking forward to going back soon.
this place is super close to home and not only reasonable in their price points but delicious!!!! not pretentious or snooty... no noses are raised high here... unless it was cuz you were trying to catch a whiff of the food being dropped off at another table.they just switched up their menus for more of fall items... but during the summer they had these mussels in this orange / citrus broth that were delicious... went back the last time for the mussels and it was equally delicious but not as sweet and more pickle-y... still yummy though!!!love their farm to table goal and def love brunch and dinner there!! whitefish was super tasty and they had a blueberry hard cider that was super good when i went last time. chicken dumpling soup was good!!! fries with garlic aioli = yum!!!!for brunch i think i got a scramble with sausage and breakfast potatoes... love love love!!! its my go to place for yummy food and drinks!! sometimes i forget about it being soo close by!!!
"Everyone raves about this place and I'm not sure why.  My friend had the char which was tasty but I wasn't quite as lucky.  I had the mussels which were cold, about 1/3 of them were completely closed and a few had a very bad taste that led to me to believe they were not fresh.  I was far from impressed with the service.  When I expressed my dissatisfaction with the mussels, they took my wine off the bill.  My wine was $10 and the mussels were $22...thanks?  Needless to say, I won't be going back."
"Four stars for atmosphere and potential for a tasty meal, three stars for what I actually ordered. Don't order the salad like I did. The burgers and sandwiches looked far more appetizing and probably a better value. Loved my half ginger ale and half lemonade, both of which are made fresh in-house."
"I have been to Farmhouse three times now. It is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Originally went here after reading several reviews on Yelp. The experience was beyond my expectations. Staff - Amazing. They are so helpful and go out of there way to make sure you are satisfied.Food - Simple and delicious. The menu is not overwhelming, the sizes are reasonable and the pairings are awesome.Atmosphere -Young(er), energetic, with eclectic decor.Bottom line: Give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed. Make your reservations a few days in advance."
"If I lived in Chicago, I would be a regular to this restaurant as well. I came here 8/30/12 and the waiter was enthusiastic, food was great as well as healthy and local and the drinks were really good as well, I had a beer from Michigan and this dessert drink called ""Honey Mead"" which I highly recommend it is from  fermented honey, a must try if you like sweet wines or liquors."
"I've been here several times for the Artic Panzer Wolf and the Sloppy Joe.  Alex is probably the best bartender in the city.  I always sit at the bar usually for the shift change.  The servers are cool I like how they interact with the bar patrons without thinking.  Lance and Emma were my favorites.  Good food, great place coming from the burbs this is my favorite."
"Yes im a fan!This place is cool - done!The bartenders are cool! The food is cool (and great), the beer selection is cool, the interior is cool!Went there Friday afternoon without reservation, but was lucky enough to get a spot at the bar (make reservations). After less than an hour where we had some great beers (perfect recommendations from the tender) and some bar food, we were so pleased that we started texting everyone 'COME TO THE FARMHOUSE'... 6 hours later we had to leave as they closed! The hangovers from all the great beers are forgotten - next time we will make reservations. Now go make yours!"
"Miss, great beers and staff was terrific.  Was here on a Saturday night at 10 pm.  If you sit upstairs at a two top you will not hear your partner more than one foot away from you.  (high ceilings, exposed brick, hardwood, all cool but makes it tough to talk, even the waitress couldn't hear us) I got the trout and my date had the short ribs and a side of the blue cheese potatoes.  They made the fish last while everything sat on the counter.  It was served cold.  The broccoli rabe on my fish was super bitter too. Not bad for pub grub and beers but nothing more."
"Great neighborhood brunch place. I had the steak with eggs, and they were absolutely amazing. so were the donuts and veggie burger ordered by my friends."
"We were visiting Chicago and came here based on a recommendation and am so glad we did. Our entire experience was excellent. Morgan, our waiter, was incredibly friendly and helpful. My mom requires a gluten-free diet and he helped her select an excellent trout dish. I had the pasta with lamb sauce and it was rich and flavorful. The dessert I had (Farmhouse brownie) was delicious as well. I appreciated that much of the menu was crafted from local, midwest goods. I'd definitely visit when I'm back in Chicago."
"Can you say small portions and not so nice bartender?! I ordered the chicken soup and beet salad to go at the host stand, I was then got sent to the bar to pick it up. The bartender looked and talked to me like I was stupid saying he didn't know the take out order I was talking about. After he checked his attitude and cleared up the confusion I left with my food. It all tasted good but there wasn't enough, they were both miniature. And the herbed dumplings in the chicken soup were way too herby."
"Really fine regional flavors, especially the chicken and dumplings. Love the support of good breweries and selections that are a little off the beaten path. Always great service and engaging banter."
Incredible! Amazing food and excellent service. And it's so cute inside. Extensive beer list which includes all local beers. Must try the cheese curds and crispy pig ears! Delicious. I wish we had more places like this in NY. So good!
Good Duck Pasta. Great truffle fries. Shirt ribs were a-mah-zing!
"We recently made our third visit to Farmhouse.  While the food is generally very good, we had a bad service experience.  My husband (who has been drinking beer for 40+ years) reported that the beer he selected tasted ""off.""  The waiter took it away and brought the coffee that we requested as a replacement.  We were charged for both the beer and the coffee with no acknowledgement that there might be something wrong with the beer.  We were stunned to see that they did not remove the beer charge from the bill."
"My favorite small town feel restaurant where the servers could not be nicer. I have now been twice, the first time Spring and last night tasted the Fall menu. Each time the cheese-ball (an absolute must and only $5.00), the wine and entrees are always impeccable and delicious. The deserts are perfect to share! I love the knowledge all of the servers have and give great pieces of information of how the dishes have developed different flavors transforming from the Spring Menu we tasted to the Fall menu. My husband adores the pork chops and while he liked the Amish chicken last night he regrets not getting the pork chops. We always have gotten reservations but it is highly recommended to call for because I've seen people at the door turned away on busy Friday nights. I haven't tried one of the themed nights merely due to schedules but that is next on the list!"
"Great experience.  I truly appreciate the local concept and will do my best to support a business that supports the local farmer.  These guys really get it.  The food and beverages are all sourced locally and their origins are all noted on the menu or wall.  All purveyors are within a couple hundred miles of Chicago and ingredients are all fresh and seasonal.  The ambiance was a bit less cohesive than I would have expected nut not uncomfortably so.  The  staff and bartender were engaging, friendly and knowledgeable.  Each dish was remarkably crafted but not pretentious in any way.  All said and done I'd recommend this as an experience for anyone trying to eat healthy...I mean within reason...if you're going to eat a large steak at least it can be organic and grass fed.  Support the little guys and make a stand against large inhumane meat purveyors and foreign produce."
"Had the pleasure of eating here while in town. The burger was quite tasty, although at a starting price of $12 it seems odd to charge $1 per topping. I skipped the bun on mine and thought they'd take that into consideration and not charge me for the egg I chose as a topping, but not so much. That being said, the burger was cooked to a lovely medium, was well seasoned and a delight to eat. Staff was very friendly and attentive. We'll definitely be back here the next time we're in Chicago!"
"Came here for brunch today with my husband and some of our friends...it was amazing!  We all loved everything we had--I had the farmer's scramble with the sausage, my husband had it with bacon...incredible.  The bread (multi-grain I think is what I chose) that came with it, was so good, too.  My friend got the baker's breakfast, and she said that was very good as well, and our friends had what looked like eggs benedict of a fancier sort....everybody loved everything.  Also, we had bloody marys along with, and they were very good, and with a piece of cheese curd as part of the garnish.  Great job, I love the local concept.  Also, our server was nice (I forget his name) but very nice and attentive."
"This place is FANTASTIC!  The food is excellent and the value is good as well.  My husband and I ordered the cheese curds, amish chicken and braised pork shoulder.  All three dishes were fantastic.  I usually don't order chicken but so many people raved about it, I had to try.   It's so flavorful and has great accompaniments. The pork shoulder was so tender it fell off the bone.  We also had bread pudding for dessert.The local beer list is great and our FABULOUS waitress (Ashley, I think) was more than happy to recommend beers and let us try some out.  We also had some friends show up late and she helped us get a larger table.  She was extremely nice, knowledgeable and accommodating.  We will definitely be back here!(My only complaint is the noise level. The music was extremely loud.  With such a small place, the noise of the customers would keep the place lively.  They can definitely turn down the music a notch.)"
"The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is consistently good on the inside.  The food quality and presentation do not disappoint.  They have simple dishes such as chicken, burger and steak, but they are fresh and well prepared.  The fried cheese curds are a fun touch (as well as tasty).  The desserts are delicious.  The servers are friendly.  The owner stopped by our table, talked to us, and was very welcoming.  The brunch menu has a good variety and did not disappoint.  The place does get crowded on weekend nights, so make a reservation."
The best breakfast I think I've ever had.  A meal where every bite was savored.  We had the pork sandwich and the farm scramble.  The hostess wasn't too friendly but the waitress more than made up for her.  We will definitely return.
"My friend and I went to Farmhouse for dinner on a Wednesday night back in March.  I love the atmosphere!  The decor is very shabby chic and inviting.  I also thought the beer list was pretty fantastic.  We ordered the Wisconsin cheese curds to start.  They were totally delicious, probably completely unhealthy, but delicious.  I had originally planned to order the half roasted Amish chicken, but when I got there, I had such a taste for a burger.  I ordered a burger medium-rare, and unfortunately, it came out more medium-well.  I was so hungry that I didn't send it back.  I really wish I had though because the meat was kind of tasteless and dry.  I would like to come back and try the Amish chicken sometime, but I definitely don't recommend the burger!"
"I enjoyed our waiter's theatrics, but the food on father's day was meh at best.  Burger was overcooked, fish was overcooked, pasta was overcooked--it's like we got our food about a minute too late.  Nice atmosphere and would possibly try again as it wasn't overpriced like a lot of places."
"Love this place.  Great vibe, interesting, fresh food, friendly service.  Only regret is that they didn't have the carrot cake bread pudding that was on the menu!"
"I have been here twice, dined upstairs both times. I appreciated the local fare and the rustic ambience that complements the menu's locavore selection. I enjoyed a local brewed IPA with a burger. Also enjoyed a house brewed cream soda, very delicious. Good food, mediocre service, easily gotten to as it is right on the Brown line in River North."
"My friend and I each ordered a salad and an entree. With all off the dishes, most elements (such as the fresh and flavorful beets in the salad, the *perfectly* al dente pasta with rich sauce, and the ultra-creamy gnocchi) were incredibly delicious. And some, mostly minor, elements on each plate were just plain gross (such as the apple compote, and the sadly soggy baby rocket). Service and atmosphere were both excellent. Seemed to have an outstanding selection of beer and cocktails. It was their 1 -year anniversary the night we went, so they gave us free champagne. Nice touch."
Solid might even be 5.  Good food good and good style.
"Wow.  I'm pretty blown away.  You know, it's always the simplest ideas that are most beautiful.  Think: You guessed it, farm food.  Down-home, good cooking.  Fresh, local ingredients and thoughtful, yet casually simple combinations.  And, the prices are on point for area and quality.  My dear friend and I started out with a very quality press of coffee for two, and shared the mac and cheese fritters  - They were subtle, warm and delicious, a bit crispy on the outside, served with a creamy barbecue sauce.  For my dinner, I had the ""Forest Mushroom and Old World Grain Veggie Burger, with Roasted Garlic Mayo, on an Egg Bun.""  $10 price?  Amazing.  The burger was point on - once again, not overwhelming in flavor, in a GOOD way.  Often, I find places add too much, in the belief that more is better.  The burger was soft and fell slightly apart when taking bites, but that's fine by me.  The house-cut fries complimented perfectly.My friend and I shared the bread pudding for dessert, (""Lemon and Almond Bread Pudding with Salty-Sweet Cream and Macerated Blackberries"") which happened to be a mutual favorite, so an easy decision.  Fluffy, sweet, and roughly elegant.Wow.  Kudos especially to chef Eric Mansavage.  His hand is definitely in every dish here.  I will be back!"
awesome!! Great!! Happy!!
"Great atmosphere and good selection of beers. Friendly and attentive service, but the downside is the price of the food. At first when you see the prices, it appears quite reasonable but portion size do not justify the cost. Also, food is just ok - nothing that makes you say 'I have to come back and eat this again.'"
"What a wonderful dinner! We arrived a bit early and were able to grab a drink up at the bar. I was immediately impressed by their ""gin cocktail"" section on the menu and got The Swing, which was a take on a gimlet and wasn't too sweet. Excellent start to the meal. Once our party got there, we were seated promptly and got the menus. In order to maximize our tasting potential, we dediced to share a bunch of different things. For appetizers, we got the heirloom tomato salad and the flatbread. Both were good but not overwhelming. The tomatoes were very fresh, however, which was a major plus. For entrees, we got the chicken, short ribs and pork chop. As someone who is not a huge chicken fan, I can honestly say that I was blown away. It was so tender and juicy and the smashed potatoes were top notch. The short rib, likewise, was delicious and disappeared quickly. My only regret is that we didn't discover the apples underneath it until we had finished more of the meat. Finally, the pork chop was intimidatingly large. Perhaps because of its size, or maybe the fact that I don't like pork, it was not incredibly memorable and our whole table voted it to be a solid dish, but not amazing. For dessert, we got the peach pie and the ice cream sundae. The homemade waffle cone on the sundae was amazing! Seriously, probably my favorite part of the meal. Overall, an excellent meal in a cute setting."
Dang. Make a reservation and just go.
"This is a 3.5 rating rounded up to 4 because of the quality service and convenient location right off the Chicago EL stop. Cute two story place, dimly lit, great beers on tap and unique cocktails to compliment an assortment of fancy bar food and entrees. We sat on the second floor and our table was a spinning wheel. We had the famous Wisconsin Cheese Curds with Alder Smoked Catsup and Mac and Cheese Fritters with Tavern BBQ Cream Sauce to start. The cheese curds were delicious, a good mix of salty, sweet, then salty again (all these flavors happening as you continue to chew and swallow); the Mac and Cheese frltters were meatball-sized fried balls of mac&cheese. Between the two, would definitely recommend the cheese curds. Additionally, we shared the Tender Boneless Beef Short Ribs with Horseradish Whipped Potatoes, Brussels Sprouts, Crispy Buttermilk Onions, and Natural Braising Jus in addition to the Pork Chop. I personally preferred the pork chop. My one complaint was that the entrees weren't served super hot. For dessert, we had the Spiced Apple Walnut Bread Pudding with Cane & Abe Rum Caramel Sauce and Salted Sweet Cream (good but I personally prefer my bread pudding a little more moist) and the trifle (my trifle-loving mate loved it, but I thought it was a little too sweet). I loved my double hard cider! Great assortment of unique cocktails. Would definitely come back in a small group. Lots of people at the bar -- would make a reservation if you want a table."
"The ambiance is great, the beer selection is fantastic and the food is delicious. Our waiter was super awesome and enthusiastic about pretty much everything and he was spot on with his descriptions/thoughts on the beer/food we were asking about.I had the burger with cheddar and my girlfriend got the veggie burger which was delicious (had to try a bite). The Cheese curds were unreal, reminded me of summer camp in Wisconsin.My only ""negative"" thing to say, the way it's laid out, some of the tables are a bit awkward to get to. Specifically the high tops in the middle of the place that run along the wall...Check this place out for sure!"
"What a find! Simple, friendly, welcoming decor. Outstanding beer list, including many local breweries. The food is fantastic. The roasted beet salad with mustard vinaigrette was absolutely sublime while the hand made pasta with pulled lamb, peas and mint pesto was out of this world. Apparently they grow their own herbs and greens on the rooftop. How cool is that? Reasonable prices to boot. For a restaurant in this price category, you really can't get much better."
"Stopped in here for a couple of beers and an app. Originally wanted to get fries and jerky, but the staff convicted me to get the cheese curds-very good! Staff was super nice. Everything is locally sourced."
"Very interesting, well done combinations.  I would say not the greatest I have had in this genre but I would def go back.  A+ whiskey selection gets the fourth star from me."
"good food, good drinks, very knowledgeable staff. I definitely recommend Farmhouse."
"Faced with a Monday office closure courtesy of the NATO conference and related protests, I decided to make a same day dinner reservation here for my lady and myself.It was a relatively early reservation (relative to the time I placed the call), but I was graciously and easily accommodated. We were promptly greeted and seated upon arrival at the specified time of 5:15. The interior's welcoming and quirky in an interesting way with styling that evokes a bit of rustic nostalgia (it is called ""Farmhouse after all) with a dusting of hip/sustainable-sensibility. The look and feel is achieved through the liberal use of many re-purposed materials. I like...They're really into the locally-sourced, sustainable model and my bet is that your server will take the time to mention this fact. Our server couldn't be any more enthusiastic and sort of worked the ""we're total strangers, but I'll act like we're not"" angle, which can be a double-edged sword. Lucky for him, my girl and I are pretty laid back and were amused by his antics. It was obvious that this guy had a routine or script of sorts as we observed him run the same canned material on every table he waited on. We were amused to say the least. Dude's table service was actually enjoyable once we got used to his personality.Okay, so with all that aside, let me get into writing about the food. We started off with the House Cured Beef Jerky and Farmhouse Roasted Nuts which was an interesting combo. The meat was good, but a little tough at times, even by jerky standards. Beer helped. By the way, this place has a nice array of locally brewed craft beers as well as locally-distilled spirits on the menu to enjoy. The almonds were nice, but not mind blowing. We also shared a Roasted Beet and Baby Rocket Salad with Goat Cheese, Salty-Toasted Walnuts and a Honey Grain Mustard Vinaigrette. This salad was pretty much perfect. The beets were super-duper fresh and combined with the goat cheese and toasted almonds, offered some really great flavors. Wisconsin Cheese Curds - the beer battered, deep fried variety - were up to be devoured next. These were irresistible, gooey, delicious and accompanied with a spicy catsup of some sort or another. We decided to split a Grilled Bone-In Pork Chop with Caramelized Parsnips, Sweet Onion Marmalade and Sherry Mustard Seed Gastrique for the main entree and were left very pleased by doing so. The chop was juicy on the inside, with just the right amount of fire-flame roasting on the outside.  The portion was generous and the accompaniments perfect! At this point we were starting to feel the imminent food coma (encouraged in part by the many beers we consumed) that wanted so badly to settle in, but we pressed on and ordered dessert, which was a Spiced Fig & Toffee Bread Pudding with a Rum Caramel Sauce and Salted-Sweet Cream. We also had to go with a French-Press for Two. Perfection.After it was all said and done, we were left pleasantly stuffed and satiated. The lady and I agreed we would need to go back again soon. The main thing that made a huge impact on us is the freshness of the ingredients. This translated into some very good, robust flavors. Also memorable was our server's ""act"" for lack of a better word - comical without trying, yet solidly professional. The dining room is a bit on the small side, but spacious enough to not feel cramped and the bar is pretty decent. I think they have a small patio as well. I'd definitely recommend Farmhouse for a date night dinner, or drinks and possibly for a group of up to five. I'll definitely be going back."
"had a lot of recommendations to try this place out, so my fiance and i went for a dinner date. we were expecting to feast on some locally sourced food. however, for a restaurant that promotes its midwestern roots, we were quite disappointed. the portions could barely feed a runway model. the pork tenderloins had good flavors but the entire dish was luke-warm. the half-chicken was...more like half of a cornish game hen as we snacked on it like vultures. we're not very big people nor do we expect ridiculous portions, but for $50+, we expected a lot more. the saving grace was the fact that the kitchen put the lemon dressing on the chicken (and my fiance is allergic to citrus) so the waiter was very nice by complimenting us with a side of seasonal vegetables (again a very tiny fistful of sauteed spinach) and a surprisingly crispy pear dessert. overall, nothing special. but at least they serve local foods."
"I visited Farmhouse at the recommendation of a friend, and it was good. The food is all organic and local, hence the name. I tried the cheese curds for the appetizer, and they were just sinful. Fried cheese with housemade ketchup... Very good. I  had to stop myself from eating too many. I then chose the trout dish with the cabbage slaw, which had a hazelnut vinaigrette. I had to balance out my indulgent entree with a healthy meal. The trout was from Door County, WI, and I could tell that it was fresh. I enjoyed my experience, and I plan to return to try their burgers."
The bartender let us try a flight of beer. Loved 3 out of the 6 and the bartender was knowledgeable and funny. Had the mussels and cheese curds. Both were amazing. The mussels come in a spicy broth with garlic bread. i'll be back to try more!
"Service was impeccable from start to finish.  The hostess sat us 30 minutes before our reservation with no problem.  Our server was friendly and personable without being weird.  She brought us tastings of different wines before we chose our bottle and walked my husband through beers he might enjoy.  She was knowledgable about everything on the menu and made great recommendations.  The bartender had a great sense of humor and entertained us during dinner by carving an orange into a pumpkin.  From appetizers to dessert, we were thrilled with our decision to eat at Farmhouse.  There's nothing like real food, and that's all you're going to find at this restaurant."
"Farmhouse is one of our favorite restaurants in Chicago.  The food is always delicious and we enjoy the beer/drink menu as well.  We have a 10 year old son and the staff at the Farmhouse always make him feel welcome.  We have always had great service, but Emma stands out as she is always friendly, attentive and has great recommendations for food as well as beverages.  Try the Farmhouse-you won't regret it!"
"We were very excited to eat here, and didn't leave with a bad taste in our mouths -  but overall it could have been a much better food experience. Ordered the burgers medium, but came out almost well done. Service was good though, which always makes up for lacking meals. We might stop back in for a drink sometime, but probably wouldn't eat."
"The atmosphere and service is great. The food is good but nothing special, had the cheese curds, mussels, and beef short rib."
"Went this for their first ever brunch service. It was amazing!! Keep this good thing going, I say. I love how everything is farm fresh and local. I got the eggs benedict and I think it had the best hollandise sauce I have ever tasted. Their beer selection is limited, not in the fact that they do not have a lot of options, it is that they just plain old run out of the good stuff fast. I had this happen each time I went so just have a few options ready that you are willing to try. My mom had one of their gin cocktails with tarragon and it was incredibly fresh and yummy. Be sure to save room for dessert, I recommend the carrot cake bread pudding."
"Perfect casual-nice burger/comfort food spot. We started with the curds, which were light and served with a housemade ketchup (I prefer marinara or ranch with curds, but it was good). He had the chicken pot pie pasty, which was savory and warm and comforting. I did the burger, and it was great. The food was solid, local, and totally delivered. Our waitress was fantastic--she advised us on beer, our meal, and was generally awesome. We'll definitely go back."
"This was our first time here. We started off easy with a reservation through Amanda. When we arrived, Scott made some great suggestions from the bar, better to let them find you something tasty cause the selections change daily. Then upstairs for dinner. At our table was the Pork Chop, the Burger, the Prix Fixe Trout and I had the Prix Fixe Amish Chicken. Wow, how about that!? Our meals were incredible. The service was remarkable. The decor, comforting. The parking, flawless since we walked a hundred feet from the Brown Line. This was an awesome choice. We'll be back!! I promise."
"An oasis of authenticity in Chicago's faux-Italian-heavy downtown restaurant scene. Big barn atmosphere, local ingredients, and lots of craft beers. The plain old burger, cooked to medium, was fantastic, and the lamb pasta with peas was an interesting take on comfort food.This place ain't particularly cheap - mains are around $20 each and the $12 burger is probably a bit small for the average Midwesterner - but given the local-sourcedness of all the food, you're probably still getting good value for your money."
Good american food!!
One of my favorite places in Chicago! Love the local fare. I've come in for just a quick bite and drink as well as dinner and the full deal. Highly reccommend to anyone in the area.
Everyone I bring here falls in love with this place. It's the perfect environment. And the food is consistently good- especially the Amish chicken and the burger. The beer selection also never fails to please! Hopefully they open their new location soon...
"The perfectly tart pear cider from Michigan and a rich Wisconsin porter, sampled within the bar's farmhouse-chic and cozy interior, raised my expectations about the food that I would be eating there. However, the results disappointed. The menu offered standard pub fair. The dishes were uninspired, and in a few cases, poorly executed. Rather than being hearty and rustic, the chicken soup with dumplings that I ordered turned out to be a thin broth dotted with a few bread-like balls: perfect for curing a severe cold, not a healthy appetite. The steak was large but tough, and the cooks had failed to trim off the gristle from the cut. Instead of being accompanied by fresh produce, it was served with lackluster fries. Likewise, the bread pudding was not a rich, creamy and booze-soaked comfort dessert but a heavy and dried out brick. The salted whipped cream that was dolloped the top, however, was delicious. We so desperately need places like Farmhouse Tavern in our community, which offer alternatives to corporate agriculture and increase public support for sustainable farming. Unfortunately, the restaurant fails in its goal to showcase seasonal, local ingredients."
"Finally tried this place after many friendly urges to check it out.  One word: fantastic.  Cozy atmosphere, great bearded bartender, and cute waitress with just-right-attentiveness.  Great Chicago restaurant find.  Good experience.  They've really branded their image well from the menu to the decor to the old tables to the check cover books.  And, of course, they have delicious food and an extensive draft beer list to back it up.  Bonus points - they do taster glasses if you're choosing between a few of the beers (nothing worse than experimenting withe a full-size beer that you aren't totally into after the first sip).We had:- wisconsin cheese curds with SMOKED ketchup...just what we needed while we decided the rest (they are fried and prepared more like mozzarella cheese stick, if you accept a diversion from more traditional WI squeaky curds)- mussels...seriously good, perfectly prepared, great toast, delicious sauce- amish chicken...so tender and wonderful, served with spetzel (huge fan)- burger...didn't taste this, but it and the fries looked good- the bread pudding...came out scalding hot, but it was incredible and a perfect choice for a brisk fall/winter nightHands-down, we will be back."
"The Hair of the Bean is a must-have drink: Iced coffee, Bulleit bourbon, maple and a bacon garnish. We had the flatbread, which was a mound of fresh arugula, pork belly and delicious barbecue sauce. For my meal I had the Amish chicken with roasted forest mushrooms, brussels sprouts, cumin carrots and cracked pepper spaetzle. (I have the description memorized because it was amazing enough that I'd like to recreate it at home, although I doubt I can come close.) I would highly recommend Farmhouse. The food and drinks are amazing, and the atmosphere is wonderful. I can't wait to go back."
"We had a great experience here and the food is fantastic.  I would definitely go back.Points of interest:  The service was some of the most polite service I've had in a while, but it was noticeably slow.  They actually comped one of our meals because it took so long.  The speed of the service wasn't more than a mild inconvenience though.  We weren't upset but they went out of their way to apologize and offered the comp without us asking or even hinting.  The manager or owner came over a few times as well to see how we liked the food and also to apologize for the speed.  The food:  Everything I tried was good.  I'm not sure if it's quite worth the price, but even at their prices I would go back.  They source most of their ingredients regionally, so I'm sure their costs are higher.Advice:  Make a reservation.  They had the table ready when we got there and we would have had to wait otherwise."
"5 stars. Had a great time and would definitely go back. Farmhouse serves up great, locally-sourced, Midwestern menu in a cozy and friendly two-story place a brisk walk from Old Town. This place is great for dates (love = sharing cheese curds) or also would be a good excuse for friends to hang out and try out new craft beers or Farmhouse creations such as the ""HUM DINGER."" Speaking of cheese curds, they were awesome! Shared those and then enjoyed a pretty darn good, unique veggie burger (Forest Mushroom and Poblano Pepper Old World Grains Burger) and a nice beet salad."
"Great atmosphere and overall neighborhood, also like the selection of beer and alcohol not to mention the food."
"Went to the Farmhouse on a recent visit to Chicago. Had a really nice meal. They where accomdating to my wife who is lactose intolerant. Enjoyed the lamb pasty, braised short ribs, and half Amish chicken. Enjoyed the house made sodas. The cranberry spice really tasted like Christmas. Would have been nice to have a bread basket or something before the meal though."
"Decent ingredients, but result was nothing special.  Waiter was a bit strange."
"I visited this fantastic restaurant with some friends who know the owner, and we had a wonderful time! The food was fantastic, the beer was delicious, and the service was excellent. I even had the bar tender reach over and give me a special drink. Who knows what it was, but I sure would have that again when I return! A return is definitely in my future. The dumpling soup and chicken dinner were to die for!"
"We tried Farmhouse last week for some drinks after work. We had a great time. We tried a sampling of the menu including the cheese curds, bacon mac & cheese balls, and mussels. Everything was extremely good. The extensive beer list of local and import brews was impressive. Our waitress let us sample multiple beers before ordering. She was also very knowledgable and friendly.I also returned on Sunday to grab a quick bite and tried the grass fed burger with smoked gouda cheese and a fried egg. It was a great burger.I definitely recomment this new spot and plan on returning soon."
"Farmhouse is exactly what the neighborhood has been waiting for: a local tavern with great booze, a midwestern slant, and comfortable atmosphere."
"This place is wonderful.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  The beer menu is very extensive as is the drinks menu.  We ordered the cheese curds, chicken soup, sloppy joe sandwich and fish sandwich.  The food was extremely fresh and the flavors were amazing and simple.  The prices were very reasonable and the decor very charming.  Most of the decor is reclaimed and from various flea markets.  It is cute and cozy!  We will be back."
"Great food (I had the Short Rib Sloppy Joe).  Great beer list.  And, Alex is a very knowledgeable bartender."
Absolutely delicious! The farm to table concept is beautifully displayed and represented at this little gem. Can't wait to go back!
"Unique earthy-nature food.  I think the chef feels there should be something crunchy in everything, which I loved.  They have their own wine on tap -- the white was good. I'll be back."
"Cheese curds, beer and non-douchy people. Do you really need any other reasons?"
"Excellent service, great food, wonderful selection of beer, knowledgeable staff"
"great mussels, good wine, food lacked flavor and over rated. small tables and set  too close......"
I. love. Farmhouse.Unique.  Tasty.  Convenient.  Crowded.  Small menu.  High quality.  Comfortable.  Food.  Drink.  Reservation.Thank you.
"Food was pretty good. We just got a couple of small plates and shared them. The mood and atmosphere is cool but beware- it is quite dark and often noisy in this restaurant. While we were seated at the table nearest the door, my friend's purse was stolen off the floor during our dinner. Definitely put a damper on the whole experience. If you eat here, keep your personal belongings next to you at all times. Unfortunately they said that wasn't their first experience with theft. Management was nice and helpful but they could have picked up our check after that ordeal."
"Awesome food (Pork Shoulder, Yum!) and service, from the start of the meal to the end of our evening."
Fantastic! Great food and perfect atmosphere. We'll definitely be back!
